That’s fine I’m 73 lol

That's reassuring to hear. Yeah, I guess the dds is an extreme example, since hitting double 48s is 1/2401, if we assume 100% accuracy. If that happens, I suppose - congratulations, you've won the lottery

With clients you can tag items that you use often with tags like that. Then you search for the tag and it comes up w all the items you have tagged with that word. Nice for gear/inv setups for bosses and clue scrolls too

I started using it because the default one was annoying. They had the orange one but it didn't look as good.

Then that is the answer, you don't need more than .6 seconds to fullfil its purpose.

2004/2005, can't remember exactly but there was an advert for it or something in an issue of Toxic, which was some shit magazine for kids in the UK.

That would be super broken, no thanks

Considering how rarely used these items are I don't see any immediate drawbacks of it's properly implemented so that the item that combines them holds value. Might give a good buff to the value of the warrior ring too

If you're smithing addy platebodies at Varrock naked you run out of run after like 25 trips at 75 agility. With graceful you get enough run energy back while smithing that you never run out of run.

Working tech will be the first target of the second faction.

This ring would still be outclassed by the berserker ring. So no it wouldn’t be broken.

* Combo eating: Eating multiple food/hp restoring items in a single tick. Commonly shark/manta -&gt; Karambwan -&gt; Sara brew -&gt; Guthix rest. Normally you can only eat one food every few ticks but these food can be combo'd together to heal a lot of HP. 
---
* Vengeance(venge): A Lunar spell that rebounds 75% of the next attack you are hit by. Taking off one's armor makes you more likely to be hit by your opponents next attack, which means you can more likely proc vengeance. Comboing this with an AGS hit is very powerful since you can easily rebound 20-50+ damage on a good roll. 
---
So anyways; OP is getting shredded by his opponent and says "fuck it" takes off his armor, venges up, combo eats and goes in for a yolo AGS spec

King Arthur is funny because humans coming from Britain makes no sense in the scope of the rest of the multiverse lore they pushed heavily in RS3.

OSRS technically doesn't have a multiverse confirmed yet, but they've admitted to a couple of the other realms existing in lore, and the Abyss is freely available.

I enjoy MTA since they fixed how bad the enchantment room was, and now the only bad room is the tele grab room but idk how they'd fix that to be better.
---
lol pretty cool. must've missed it in the CC :p
---
It approaches a particular number as x tends towards infinity and (for x trials). It's definitely a number that depends on x.
---
Here's some examples. With an item that has a drop rate of 1/2, you have a 75% chance to get at least one drop in 2 trials. Here x = 2 and the percentage is higher than 63%. For x = 10, the percentage after 10 trials is 65%.
---
Probability to get item exactly on the drop rate:
---
P(at least 1 drop) = 1 - P(no drop) = 1 - (1 - 1/x)^x

Looks like it was made for Thurgo.

runescape IS a nutshell

I thought I had the stats to get my first Zulrah kill but now I’m second guessing myself. I’ve learned rotation 1 enough to the point where I can survive past the jad phase and all the way to the end when it becomes another rotation but now DPS seems to be my issue. I’m using EVscape’s guide with the exact gear and inventory with 84 magic, 75 range, and 75 melee/prayer stats. Do I just need to spend more time grinding my range and magic up to get a kill? Do people that kill Zulrah before the end of a rotation do it that quick because they have maxed stats?
---
So no head?
---
Holy shit man swiftswitch what a nostalgia bomb
---
Ohhh yeah definitely try a higher percent haha. Some people recommend keeping it at 98’ish for better chances of not hitting the runes reward. I’ve done like 60 runs on my pure and got 3 or 4 pieces

What exactly do climbing boots do? I know they have stats and they're used in the troll questline for traversal. Do they have some effect on the rockslide/piles of rocks that you have to climb? Are those bits impassible without climbing boots, or do they drastically raise the chance to succeed at doing them?
---
Yeah I realize I’ll have to do some quests but that’s kinda the opposite of what I wanna do, which is anything other than quests lol.
---
thieving is literally one of the fastest skills in game. up to 250k xp/h
---
Get agility up so you don’t struggle with energy all the time xD also make for tellys and if you have money to transfer from rs3 I’d suggest construction. Then quests to skip grinding early level grinding
---
Is that a mortar? Lol

Haha that’s awesome! Hopefully some people get the reference when they see it

I knew that name was familiar

Yeah fair point

Got mine on 880. Had 2 onyxes and 3 helms until that point. Stay strong brother.

Man sick skiller account! Grats.

You keep it at 88 so that you do hit the rune reward lol. You don't want the karil bolts

Wanting to make a manual edit to a character's appearance and thinking the only way to solve it is a re-roll is so odd (not to mention, there was no initial roll so what is to be "re-rolled") that I actually think it's a understandable mistake on the mod/whatever saw the term "reroll" and thought "account rollback".
---
there are certainly some who have. you also don't need to be 100% perfect to not be able to get hacked, and you can change your registered email at any time and add a unique password to that which removes the problem anyway.

replied one time before runefest telling me to file an in game bug report. Have heard nothing since then

Can't tell if bait. But in any case, yes you did
---
But what about... karamja
---
I’ve been using those for the past couple of hours and I can survive to the end of the rotation but I can’t seem to do enough DPS to kill Zulrah. Once the rotation ends I get thrown off and rapidly lose focus on what I should be doing. So I’d really like to get my kill in before the end of the rotation.

Well I know people who couldnt kill Zulrah if it werent for twisted bow so maybe try it with a tbow. Apparently its way easier.

I would set barrows gloves as a goal for yourself. They're a great strength upgrade for a long time and once you complete the quest you'll have a much more well rounded account. You'll be at/close to the reqs for most of the things in this thread.
---
I'd start by looking up the efficient quest guide on the wiki
---
How did you know it was a ranarr weed?
---
“Character creation options can be changed later, but if you want a new look now then it would be easier to make a new account” would be a much better explanation

Keeps the username, funny story about having to save up a couple gp and sport a ponytail for a little bit.

what CC if you dont mind my asking? I have fire cape and barrows gloves and im almost cb100

And not even 300 boltracks. Fucking brutal

You’re literally speaking from a place of ignorance and it shows. Farm karma from people on their 12th fire cape attempt all you’d like but reality is far different than your inexperience.
---
Farming is expensive, but tree runs give ridiculous amounts of XP.
---
Another commenter mentioned that if you don't count the down time between runs, fruit tree runs are like 1.5m xp/h.
---
Na I specifically remember being dumb and mistaking it for 3 mil

Lol, I mean you have the right to think that. Some kills were done pre log but not much.  However this was the first whip that I got on this account, feel free to not believe me but its the truth. \*shrug\*

lumbridge explorer's ring from the achievement diary, sadly only p2p now.
---
Congratulations on Lvl. 99 Car Accident Evasion
---
u got wooshed m9
---
It’s the explorers ring. You get it from doing the lumbridge achievement diary. I think you get the teleport function after conpleteing the medium diary and the higher the diary you complete the more teleports you get per day. With the hard diary done you get unlimited teleports.
---
Alting is gay. Just play one account for more fun

Not true.

You do not, that's completely false.

No, if on dwh?

You just want more Krystilia hentai
---
I wasn’t driving, but it’s alright. We have air bags equipped and that gives us 216 car accident defense.
---
That's the lumbridge ring, gained from doing the lumbridge achievement diary. It's locked behind members in old school, though.
---
Got my gloves 2 weeks ago and just got my torso and firecape the other day. Working on void now, one helm to go.

Never run into him on 2k or 2.2k world. Train up

For RS3 &amp; OSRS it is the Explorer's Ring, which requires completion of the Lumbridge &amp; Draynor Diary. However for RS3 it was F2P and OSRS its P2P.
---
He's literally like 100kc from mutagen drop rate.

Max cape from 2011 crazy. This one is poo
---
Like I said its the best upgrade in the game. That said when your account is only 100m, 60m is a lot to spend.
---
You using swamp trident and blowpipe currently? May be a bit of a struggle at your stats, but it should be possible. Check your max hits in the dps calculator, if you're really close to a max hit with mage then consider using divine mage pots
---
Unrelated to the proposed sword, why use hasta over tent whip?
---
You're not half drop rate, you're very close to on drop rate.

Even not using the same password, you have recovery questions, personal information on your email, etc.. Your challenge is almost as dumb as you.

Already have prims, tort, tassy and godhides.

Here's my setups so far:

Melee: max mid-high level gear (Max gear but fire cape instead of infernal, bgloves instead of fero, d def instead of avernic, torso instead of bcp) + prims, tassy and torture and bring(i)
---
Ranged: full godhide set + fury + archers ring(i) + avas (missing armadyl, anguish and pegs)
---
So I still miss a lot of shit but i heard rigour is good aswell..

i fucking love this, please jagex add :)

why would u even fight someone risking the same with so much better gear

I’m coming back as well. About to get membership
---
jrein0 said "something" to combat freezes. What if there was a 2-handed weapon that had an ability to cleanse a freeze that had a cooldown? Or if there was a spell that you could only cast if you're not holding a 2h weapon? This would make it impossible to use while holding a Dinh's Bulwark. You're right that it would require balancing, but there should be some kind of counter to almost every mechanic. At least, that's what made combat in Guild Wars 1 great.
---
I get your point of view, but I fully believe this customer support guy has never played the game. That said, it may be an unrealistic expectation to have every employee of jagex to have played the game fully. I think, if anything Jagex needs to train their customer support employees better.
---
I had a 95 mage pure as an alt and I just realised I didn't like PKing. So I've turned it into a Slayer alt with the intention of killing kurasks until I max melee combat. I've really on quested some 15 minutes or less quests to get an efficient NMZ and with that I can get pretty much max melee gear except for barrows gloves. 
---
I just used a dragon sword on Slayer and obby sword in NMZ to power through to 70 attack. It's not a very long grind at all.
---
It is. You lot are a joke.

I added your discord

collection log, get it from your poh bookshelf or talk to The Collector in varrock museum

---
Hell, could even outright explain that there are methods available in game to change player clothes and base wardrobe, where they're located and that using the world map they could both be found. Or even explain that once they obtain and equip a helmet, the hair would be covered as is so shortly after starting they could hide it.
---
Weird flex...but okay
---
Did you do multiple appeals? I botted last year because I’m a scumbag and got perma banned in a day. Which blows my damn mind because of how many bots are in this game with millions of Xp
---
  
---
It also happened to be linked to my RS3 account which I don’t play anymore but I was 500m+ XP on, so like a year of my life
---
Everyone would have glasses on it to make it look like swamp man
---
It's also possible your account has hi-jacked, botted on and picked up by the system fast. If your unfamiliar with the game it's easy to fall for a phishing link or something similar. On the other hand why would they want to bot on a pretty fresh account.
---
fuck off with your compromise bullshit, this is reddit there's only up or down
---
I just watched the video of my kill. It was rotation 3 followed by either rotation 1 or 2 (killed it on the first tanzanite phase). So I was wrong about me using 2 and 4. Try 3 :).
---
Yeaaaahh...I would suggest you not wear that in public
---
They should also remove Stam pots from the game
---
Something like a gargoyle alt, longterm maybe a brutal black dragon or runedragon alt

its 2019, women should be allowed to have beards smh
---
What if you're spec-tabbing to pool between spawns?
---
People can still get bound/frozen as they run to the teleport spot and they can't be deactivated from far away. TBs still work. Just makes it so they're not panick clicking on the obliesk as they also try and run onto it. For an extra 200k always dropped on death I think thats fairly reasonable.
---
Its *powerful*, yes, but not *over*powered because they still need to get there and get on it which is the hard bit.

I thought this was a Spinner and was going to smash it before the portal opened 🤷‍♂️

Considering I'm not the OP and therefore not the one who teleported to Castle Wars, it seems you might be the dumb one.
---
But yeah sure, fuck him for not playing the game how he wants, it sounds like he had fun that he wouldn't have had if he'd went to Clan Wars. Brainlet.
---
Didn’t even see the subreddit or the title and instantly thought of the quest
---
Fremmenik isles is a quest in which you help 2 kings of neighboring colonies fight a group of ice trolls. You get a real nice helmet for completing it.
---
Google fremmenik isles guide for a more in depth look, but it's pretty simple and doesnt require much to start.

Fuck you im 1000+ kc on each one  and im still dry...
---
Reroll is often used in WoW, also pretty sure you can't change your appearance there so it fits the assumption too.
---
A complete void of moisture is hitting 200m exp farming and still no Groot.
---
Both of those things are wrong. People who die to the "timer" risk it. You can tell if the stability is dropping low, and tab out if you don't want to risk it. And die in one or two hits regardless of hp? The max you can get stacked for with prayer on is way less than your whole hp. Either you haven't seen volcanic mine since before it was made easier (I never saw it beforehand), or you're just straight up lying.
---
"forced to tap an air rune for an hour"
---
This idiot was using the rune on the chicken.. Sure he's new and all but the tutorial introduces you to the tabs on your interface one at a time with magic being last. He would have to be speeding through it without paying attention.
---
I’ll definitely look into that. Thanks!

Good job c engineer

Nah, takes like 10 minutes, kill a dog, kill a dude, find the priest, bring him 50 unnoted rune essence for some reason, and then you have some prayer xp and morytania.
---
Just need some varrock tabs and a stamina potion
---
Andrew's spaghetti?
---
I mean, I did so I don't see the point here.
---
Train your combat at the Nightmare Zone. You earn solid XP and earn points for that can be redeemed for herb boxes.
---
You can only purchase 15 per day, but at current prices that's around 160k on average. Save up a few weeks of points and open them every day.
---
Bossing usually requires stats in the 80s and 90s, but there are some lower level ones worth trying. You may have some nice success fighting the giant mole, or Barrows if you also have a decent magic level.

Wait, they do? I'd kill for that. Do you know what it's called?

amazing

nope, because I still haven't heard back from them about my support ticket 6 months ago.

What is the lore reason behind ancient staff having negative prayer bonus???
---
I explored the game, you know, like you are supposed to. also thanks for the downvotes guys, you really showed me my place.

Just do 3 skeletons (because of salve amulet), imo. The reward chest will be around 1k less on average according to the calculator.
---
!kc pb zulrah
---
Huh, does 880 rewards points not correspond to 88%? I've never personally gotten bolt racks when getting 88%.
---
A long time ago in galaxy far far away...
---
It's not 88%. 88% rolls for Bolt Racks. 87.9% and lower doesn't, so if you get 86.2% by killing two skeletons and a bloodworm, you're getting the best possible amount of runes without risking getting Bolt Racks.
---
I'm also down for customer support job. Hire me.
---
He didnt say stats.  I think its a decent idea since it keeps the item relevant.  There is next to no use atm for said item.  Even the bonecrusher isnt really useful outside of Ironmen and not much even for them.
---
But you're going against your own argument. You're using a late game based ammy attachment. And now you're talking trash mobs. How would life leech bridge the gap vs trash mobs when melee gets defensive armor that already mitigates most damage (in comparison to range). The places where the ammy attachment would actually be an impactful benefit, melee is already competitive.
---
Cool idea, I'd be for it.  Both seem like relatively dead content atm so this would be a nice buff for such a late game item.

Let me get this straight- you’ll bring some guthans with a spear switch in place of max strength so you could spend even more time and effort than just simply banking in the first place. If you’re going to get sweaty you might as well do the 5 way. “1850 total and think you’re hot shit” lmfao

Granted that if u try to air strike the chicken thats literally marked with an arrow above its head, your character will run all over the place. Any other chicken will work fine tho.

Awesome, thank you. I'm doing the same route and noticed a lot of people dropping gems, but I prefer collecting them.

Thanks, yeah same here. I like watching those sapphires go up!
---
Agreed. I’d vote for Stealing Creation if the reward System was reworked and steered away from exp bonus items.
---
It would be $55 lol
---
Damn you played an average of 9 hours every day.. I respect the dedication

You can do the previous stuff without the 70 cooking because you can boost for it. Must have skipped a step or something

No joke my friend falls for catfishes all the time. I feel so sad for him because he’s never been kissed and is so desperate, but like dude you’re 28, 260 pounds working 3rd shift at a gas station escaping your reality with video games. A 20 year old girl 3 states away you talked to for one night isn’t the one.
---
Also I say friend loosely. This dude I’m nice to I bond with over WoW and OSRS

You shouldve made 500 accounts with 500 bonds and vote to balance out that 0.3% so technically this is your fault

Nice

Where the fuck did that come from? Most pvpers just want to at least break even and not go into debt even if they lose most fights.

Turn in your parts, you probably going to make more money by having a chance to receive expensive seeds :).

Re-roll is starting to be used colloquially in MMOs,  and other game genres,  as a general term for starting a new character.  Even if there was no initial roll
---
God damn I miss SwiftSwitch/SwiftkKit. Miss using the IRC chat on the bottom and how cool it was to have the stat look up without going to the website, having the skill calculators with your level already there and stuff. Definitely some of my fondest memories was during that time.
---
This is really cool. You should make one for clue scrolls, I know the input variables are much more limited, but the drop rates and expected averages always seem to be disagreed upon.
---
Spacebar holders but they don't read anything in any game cuz this is just the 14th mobile game they downloaded today

This is fantastic!

150k were bots tbh

yeah for sure, collection log should have been implemented with a kc before log

In the early levels the best way to get experience is from questing.

If you go to a skill page on the wiki, it will show which quests give that xp. There's also training methods linked at the top of each page too

You don't want a Dragon Warhammer for a very low level boss that should be brute forced with even more sources of damage.  If you really want to spend the money, a damage spec like Dragon Claws is better with your Dharoks than going for a Dragon Warhammer.
---
Even if you wanted to go the defense draining route, I'd rather use a double BGS as that's way more accurate and his defense is low enough to make a couple strong BGS hits more valuable for specs overall.  DWH is miserable in accuracy; just because it's a meta spec for high level content doesn't mean it never misses or it's as good as you think it is for the Giant Mole.
---
There's more consistency in just shaving more way more bulk damage long term with a pair of Dragon Claw specs versus trying to lower the already average 200 defense of the Giant Mole with either DWH or BGS.
---
Eventually in high level bossing, you will actually come to terms the fact that going to raw damage route is better than defense reductions.  It's very situational but usually it is because your accuracy high and/or the defense is trivial to even worry about lowering it, plus wanting to skip over a phase or hopefully reduce the time taken to kill it directly with a lucky damage spec.  DWH is great for most high level bosses with absurdly high defenses, BGS is used for some unique cases like Vorkath or to finish off an already DWH-weakened boss in teams because of diminishing returns, and Dragon Claws is a valuable option to hopefully take a large chunk of HP off a boss real fast with the specs and resume with normal gear.
---
Yeah me too people who value their time and play the game different are so dumb haha.
---
Loving the Penance gloves addition. They seem forgotten with Graceful around. I got them before I even got Torso.

No I am following a guide that told me to start as a woman for the recruitment drive quest. It saves some time and money

"So why didnt you do 99fm at wintertodt?"
---
"Oh, I started as a F2P ironman because it was fun and I saved gp/bonds"

"Thats super inefficient"

"F2P ironman was really fun until the mid 50s"

"No, waste of time"

Only to realize your money is still there
---
Loving every single one of these!
---
Yeah,  but it's starting to be used across the genre as a whole,  and branching into other genres.  Just because one a playerbase from 1 game used it doesn't mean it was a popular thing to say about every game
---
I'd just like to point that 
---
1. That's a client even in 2006 for everyone pretending like its new 
---
2. Somehow that was better than what Jagex has to this day by default. That's so absurd to think about
---
Why not have more than one that the player can collect?
---
He probably knows this. However it is harder to explain to him how to do this than for he him to create a new account. However silly it sounds most new players don't know where Falador is.
---
I mean it is technically inefficient. But you also did it because you enjoyed doing it. The same way efficient players do stuff efficiently; they enjoy it. So I don’t really get your point.
---
Some maxed sweatys in-game were saying there is nothing wrong with that. I personally say **bullshit**. Skilling pets should almost be guaranteed after every single action once you hit 200m.
---
Nah it's not medieval. This game is set in industrial age because archeology has been discovered.
---
how about every attack functions like  a snare that lasts as long as the wepons attack speed
---
Yeah long bone is 1/400
---
Friendly reminder that only pkers are toxic.

Yeah I came here from RS 3 and I loved Imsikofit also but I agree with the others, slayermusiq1 has a way more user friendly format. Hit play and go

Wow nice one thanks so much for writing this. Loved it.

Me either. Im over 300 kc and never received racks
---
Mad lad
---
So I work in the support industry and don’t know everything about what we support. What I do do is find out shit before I send it to the client. On the other hand why didn’t you just go straight to http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?429,430,thd,241,66004737 to log your issue.  Instead you post your mediocre response on reddit.

You can do that whilst also really wanting the poster, wtf?

This is a seriously HD screen shot
---
You did good, I like it.
---
First complain about lack of customer service, then complain about said service?
---
The customer was asking for a re-roll. Not the location of a makeup artist. It's also a brand new player. Chances they'll make it to falador are basically nonexistent, and they're going to spend a whole lot of time playing the game before thinking of such things.
---
How about BGS?
---
A compliment from a whore that hands out congratulations like they're free newspapers is worthless. Congratulations, your words are empty.
---
So they ban those people and can suspend them in runescape as well lol sounds like a win win
---
Hp is a factor because the set bonus is based off percentage of hp loss.
---
You can buy bonds with the money you make doing your job though.
---
Well you won’t get those from clues
---
I used to actively PvP before EOC, but haven't done so in the current game because the focus on tick manipulation is a lot more refined now than it was back then.  
---
(when the scariest common thing was a Dclaw/DDS spec out)
---
In terms of the hat, that was a little pain, but I used a $2 halloween witches hat for the frame, and then layered the blue cloth over it, then sealed it with strips of yellow/gold cloth for the brim and the base of the cone.

Technically, this is what the forums are for, it's just  no one uses them. A brand new Mobile user isn't going to even know they exist.

Mostly duos or trios

Cursed suggestion

There is no such thing as an account build that includes Construction. - huh..
---
You can trade in mole parts to Wyson in the park above the mole, you get nests in return. Not sure how the gp compares, would be close either way.
---
Really unlucky.

Lmao why even offer that. People would do it for free just for a little hat or icon so they can think "look I'm better than you" to other players

Do contracts and a daily fruit tree run, I usually get 2-3 a day from that.
---
Cool idea. Benefits pvp and pvm as well
---
Username checks out
---
Like this is like a 1 in 8 to go this dry.
---
Going about 24,000 dry is the same probability of getting one on the first kill
---
I was thinking other monsters from the Vampyrium origin, such as the arachnids that originated from there. However, unfortunately there wont be much use for this weapon anywhere else. :L
---
you do know what NH stands for right?
---
Oh thanks, I thought that there is some hidden image made from those red crosses, or something like that 😃
---
Gz dvs
---
If it makes you feel any better you're no closer to the pet than I am and I've never killed the mole
---
Thank you for reminding me of this fairy ring code, I need it for diary but forgot what it was
---
But how would we cross the bridge?
---
And explorer's ring
---
how about where the special attack makes it so that after casting, every 10 seconds your magic attack accuracy increases by 10% until the monster you are fighting dies.
---
Not even a curved bone, get out  of here
---
Only one of you can mine the final ore that depletes the rock once the timer has run out. If you hop on someone else's rock, and you get the final ore, you've just wasted their time.
---
Also if I wanted to afk to take a piss, and I see that you're on my rock, I don't see any problem with hopping to a next one over to get a full timer. (unless the mine is packed with players, but that's your fault for choosing a bad world)
---
Ah cool, thanks dude
---
Yea I completely forgot about barrows, what's the recommended levels to go for it at?
---
But you'd never know if someone is wrong or trolling. And trolls would act like they are serious.
---
I just go a bit further where there's no people when I mine since it's a bit more afk than hopping on other people's rock
---
Pretty sure the mod just understood the person complaining; Detetmined it was better to just let the customer be right, and have their "way".
---
When people get upset, they stop listening to genuine advice.
---
Wiki quick guides are your friends
---
How do you turn this on?

My favorite review was of the guy complaining that a character named Highway Man killed them.

Slap a high req on it, like 1750 or 2k total level, and have a review process where 5 people have to accept your response before it goes public, with the ability to report it. Make enough trolling comments, get your account banned.
---
They're collectors. Like... for example, why do I have over a million feathers? I dont know
---
Same with armor.  Just take it off.
---
no one uses master wand anyway rofl
---
You gotta just own up to it at that point mate..... it’s for sure a repost
---
Source of that info?
---
That's Rs3 though, barely anyone plays that, and there's a lot of MTX whales so it makes sense.
---
Cc 'Thievinghost' is always active.
---
And they know this damn, I always thought people got perm banned... guess it's time to make money
---
Jagex can't detect things like overlays and entry swappers as they can't detect right clicks.
---
thats literally one in a billion good job
---
that's dope, i'm jealous!

i think it's one the coolest easy clue items, especially for the skull ability when you equip it. i am trying to get it myself but no luck yet, clue scrolls are great content for developing an ironman as well

On the contrary, I think it makes budgeting all the more important because you want to get as close to 11 HP as possible without going over before using the lamp.
---
1337 total, has god revived himself?
---
Well if the game was going down (which it isn’t) then the best time to get in to it would be now.
---
Yeah! If you coat/spray the inside with cooking oil, then it will last much longer

I'm shocked no one has tagged storgie yet

Possible? Yes, it’s a thing in RS3. Can you do it? No.

You can just do each thing and then use a lamp.

Ah my bad, I wasn't 100% sure about guthix rest tbh. Thanks for the correction

No! I THOUGHT WE USED THE DARK ARTS TO SEAL THIS MONSTER!

That's all you do? I read some article of someone doing a really extensive routine to preserve them, but if I can just spray it with cooking oil I'm definitely gonna try that

I only play an hour or two a day over weekdays, I already answer questions in my cc, might as well get paid to do it.

---
You've gone from saying they can't detect it, to saying they can detect it at the same time.
---
Nobody has been banned, because jagex didn't take control or the situation as soon as it arose. If they banned everyone who has used it in the past, they would be banning huge amounts of players. 
---
It has become obvious that you're just an idiot. 
---
I'm out.
---
why do you want to keep your creation date so badly? one of the biggest cons associated with this, is that a lot of people get hacked and a lot hackers find it funny to drop untradeables etc just to upset people, so being able to reset their entire account back to tut island would be another thing they would enjoy doing to hurt people.
---
Welp should have been paying attention bud
---
Ponytail
---
I didn't they can detect it, all I've meant the entire time is that they dont get the difference between left and right.
---
Swampman good
---
Osbuddy bad
---
Oh
---
Right, my bad
---
The randoms sometimes appear as you enter a bank and instantly leave.
---
This wouldn't hurt your experience, you're just gatekeeping qol for others who want it.
---
Sins of the Father, the new Myreque quest
---
i would suggest aiming for a completely different goal, or style of gameplay, so everything is a newer experience, requiring you to think differently to achieve those goals and the satisfaction from doing so will be like it used to be. a lot of people get burnt out because things become repetitive, no progress etc  
---
i'd suggest trying out ironman, if you don't like it you can try something else, but we never know what we will truly enjoy until we give it a try ourselves!  
---
you might just be tired of runescape and need a new game or hobby to get started in, remember that dopamine and that feel good feeling can be achieved in different ways to just osrs
---
Why isn't the fairy ring on Miscellania marked out?
---
its an old map
---
Which Minecraft update is this
---
I’ve never had them instantly leave as I enter a bank. And not gatekeeping I feel that it’s a useless need for an update when the dev team could be working and spending there time somewhere else because one individual didn’t pay attention to their monitor.
---
Removed my comment as you already said what I was thinking. take a upvote.
---
&gt;They would be another great way to show that you've grinded out a boss like pets, and be able to show them off in your house.  
---
if you add a collection log to your house and you can let people see all of your drops that way, it also lets them see all the other drops you have earned, not limiting it to just the jars visible in the display case
---
Mage pots only give +4 so id say definitely not worth the invent spot, as the other guy said prepotting with heart is viable cause the cooldown will take most of your trip anyway
---
&gt;, don't wanna get obsessed again!
---
Then fucking don't lol. Use your impulse control and stop giggling about it on Reddit. Either play or don't. You're literally sitting here recognizing your own problem and talking about it as if you've got no control over it.
---
Simple choice: do you really want the rest of your precious free time going to this game doing shit you've already done for likely thousands of hours?
---
And honestly your excuse not to make an iron is pretty weak. You can make an iron in casual gameplay just as easily as you can rebuild a raiders bank on casual gameplay. They're both huge time commitments. Unless of course you're a staker. Well that just has its own issues.
---
You say you want dopamine. Well as a runner you should realize RuneScape isn't the only thing in the world that does it. And it certainly runs out and as someone who has returned to the game multiple times seeking that old rush, well it doesn't come back like it used to be. New games give new feelings.
---
Because they're not broken, when they realised they stopped working for anything more advanced than autoclickers they changed them to still exist because they were a fun distraction. There's no easy way to detect bots through a skill test nowadays, bots are better at doing most things.
---
I know it sucks that sometimes they appear when you're about to enter a bank or teleport but it happens, calling them broken because they don't stop bots is missing the point of why they're still here.
---
This guy has a 5 leaf clover
---
Went through this exact scenario in 2010-2011. I would suggest starting an Ironman and drop the botting. As great as the progress can be there is 0 sense of achievement and it completely ruins the experience.
---
In my experience I always finish an inventory with extra food so there's not a lot of reason to increase magic defence further
---
COUNTRY JIG INTENSIFIES
---
The whole reason they got rid of it and reintroduced tutorial island was because the amount of people completing the tutorial part of the game dropped significantly after learning the ropes was released.
---
Ouch...
---
It already did! Youncan find the whole set with all old DLC include for 20$ on steam. they even added a new KI and new smaller dlc tonthe game with new colonies! its SO insanely good :D
---
Thank you!
---
&gt;HD
---
Doesn't Song of the Elves confirm it for osrs? As it tells of how Seren lead the elves from a different world to this one? I wouldn't be surprised if other pieces of content have confirmed other worlds existing.
---
ZULOL
---
In reference to my "OSRS HD sneak preview" post.
---
Maybe if the target is over 50% Health it does dmg based on its Max Health. When the target goes under 50% it does dmg based on current health. Diminishing returns but a really useful opener weapon.
---
Looks like a 10 hp ironman pure being trained up and not finished yet.
---
Just dont play then. Be decisive.
---
If you send me your username, password, bank PIN, and social security number I can turn it on for you.
---
That is genuinely sad
---
For more context, Visage is extremely rare and the drop rate was unknown, so people started theories after being dry for easily thousands of dragon kills
---
It's only 25k lol
---
153 chests dry, but thanks for the information!
---
Thanks for the help. Around what stats should I be able to expect a kill before the end of a rotation?
---
Its way easier than with blowpipe, search a tutorial. I'm sure you'll learn in no time

Jeez I wonder if anyone will actually read this dumb text haha ILY :]

Shortsword over Scim, everything in the game is weak to stab

nice

As much as I love 25buttholes, I think it’s hilarious that everyone is saying it looks like him. It’s an old ass mmo, there are like two looks in the entire game. You crushed it, looks awesome!

This looks like AoE II! A classic game

If there's any kind of advantage out there people will abuse it. It's on Jagex to fix it.

No, 88.1% rolls racks. If you kill skeleton, 2 worms, and a rat you roll 88.0% and won’t get racks
---
He probably thinks 500gp is an outstanding amount of money
---
It's a rabbits foot with 5 leaves
---
Who tf cares
---
A knight rush is really only effective if you start archers and m@a, click up right when you start to hassle then move into knights when they start to bring out skirms and archers.
---
Prevent it with a trush!
---
If I'm remembering correctly they were untradeable to start with and then they changed it
---
Its beneath the lumber camp, sadly.
---
Click
---
They really do, I'm so lucky I got my scroll below the drop rate
---
Build a pure from scratch. Or an ironman. I did the same thing when eoc was released and was banned but meanwhile I had alot of maxed stats and I felt the same way. Today I don't bot or do anything illegal in the game. I have more motivation to play my ironman acc. Try making an ironman and a pure. That's what I did and the spark is back.
---
Sorry, am I missing something? The new player will be unfamiliar with falador, much less how to make 3k, despite how easy it is for us familar with the game. Making a new character is probably 20 minutes at most.
---
Yeah but fuck reading a book homie. When’s the last time you went to a friends house to read
---
After it goes random how do you figure out what the new rotation is? I think my biggest issue is the period between.
---
Magic is also pretty good for mobile, as well as range, attack and strength though not so much unless you're doing cows or crabs. Just splash if you want afk xp, or if you want more gp and less xp, telegrab wines, or just pure xp you can kill hill giants or something, I never really did much but splash so I dunno. 
---
But magic is really easy on mobile just cause you can filter spells to take up like half of your screen, rather than having to precisely click.
---
Disease isn't great but it's easy
---
That's impressive itself, not the drop.
---
I just copied other guy title lmao, im not surprised of this backlash because 2007scape is one of the worst communities
---
If I didn't play runescape I would have no idea what a macro was
---
So they can not detect menu entry swaps?
---
Your gf is really a man who is actually a bot
---
Anything goes in the wild bro, that's what nobody understands
---
Oh cool I thought recoil didn't work since they "have to be damaged" by god spells. What about food? I tried brews but I was taking so much damage that by the time I was healed my magic level was like 7
---
You can trade the mole parts to Wyson in Fally Park for seed/ring nests...or you can sell them on the GE to people who want to do the same. At current GE prices, [it is currently not profitable to exchange them yourself](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Exchanging_mole_parts), but you might not actually get to sell them at the displayed GE price
---
Is that a unicorn wolf in the tree lmao
---
I will throw many GP at whoever will sell me this item.
---
i knew about that
---
No
---
Also ape atoll and house arceeus
---
Seconding what this guy said. Whip/BP/Trident first...then B ring...then Fury
---
They would get a more helpful response at the GE in a pvp world.
---
Back in the day a scenario designer called Basse made a multi-player RPG in AoE II of the F2P RuneScape areas. LudiKRIS map size probably allows more distuingishable objects and places to add. Just a heads up aswell, the compability moving from AoHD to AoDE may not be 100%, but from AoC to AoDE should be 100%. Nevertheless, good luck with the project.
---
If you're a member, you can start doing Barbarian Fishing for much better XP (faster Fishing xp and it also gets you Agility and Strength), but no profit
---
if they add a helmet from this i'd want it to be pointy nosed like the original concept for what turned into justiciar
---
Yup, clans can operate up to 100 or more scouting bots, meaning they have almost every world covered at almost all times. The scout bots give them real time info, such as names, combat level, items worn, and if skulled or not. It does this all instantly. So the only lag comes from the person reading the bot reports, then that person sharing the info with the clan, and then everyone hopping. AKA not enough time to react to seeing a scout login, which is almost constantly. 
---
Yet these fucks defend it, claiming they aren’t hurting the game. “We’re not bringing any new items into the game, we already manually scout so it’s not like we’re doing something we weren’t before”. Which their right in that regard, but operating tens to hundreds of real time scout bots is an INSANE advantage that even the largest legit clans do not have.
---
also honestly i think this content would be good to drop accuracy melee legs and chest.
---
Lucky!! Finally got mine now at 823KC. I have no need to go back either now. I can just kill the normal ones for some quick xp.
---
Youre lucky, theres no efficiency mindset on this game. Except for like a few players u can count on a hand.
---
Is it better AFK though? I've found early fishing to be poor profit anyways, but my cooking lvl is keeping up.
---
Yes.  But you also bring max strength gear if you know what you’re doing.
---
two favorite games in one. brilliant.
---
The thing a lot of people aren't seeing is that the game will never be like it was in rs2. When osrs didn't have a ge most people were using zybez forums to buy and sell.
---
and hard no on the melee weapon being AOE, we just need a standard, normal, literally just a vanilla no special attack mace that's 6 or faster speed and about as good as a whip, so tier 70.
---
It's just so stupid. If I get killed in wildy. Fine. If they wanna rag me. Fine. But if you and your 30 boyfriends have to use scouting bots to make it literally unplayable so you can hold revs down. Fuck you.
---
Feels
---
A player with little to no experience (3 days) should by that time frame killed a few chickens/graduated to cows, done a few shitty quests and have made their way to varrock and died to the mages... Shouldn't have that sort of money at that point and it's down to intelligence not experience.. if I went into an auction and said to the seller "how much will you sell that for" and he gave me a price, I'd be pretty stupid to give him whatever he demanded rather than take literally 5 mins to ask around a bit lol? 
---
Plus when you get scammed you learn from it, cry and try again lol...
---
Do research on osrs.wiki and then think for yourself or try different combinations for an hour each
---
The wilderness is still subject to the game rules. Exploitation of botting is not acceptable anywhere, even the wilderness. It’s on the clans that think it’s okay to abuse the game/community and it’s on Jagex for their lack of enforcement of their own rules. It’s killing the wilderness.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/E4kmB6S](https://imgur.com/a/E4kmB6S) \- My setup (not max efficiency, but pretty convenient/slightly more afk)
---
Could probably boost the XP by quite a bit if using an alt to trade all the supplies and by using the cannon.
---
I don't see anything, someone explain?
---
Sometimes even with reliable internet your requests can get blocked by one reason or another. Trying another source of internet would be good to check if that's indeed the issue or not.
---
As for the login thing - if you created a runescape account first, I'd recommend just using that to play in the first place. It's still stored on the cloud so you don't have to fear losing it when switching phones. The original game was already decades old when mobile was launched, so the compatibility issues with Google play and Apple ID are somewhat understandable.
---
already done it for giants 👊🏼
---
That's not the way you want to go about it. If it starts becoming a recognizable pattern again...you're gonna die. See the initial rotation, have a strong start, maximize DPS. When that rotation ends, go into "improv mode" and just change your prayer/weapon/gear accordingly to whatever she does
---
Do normal slayer?
---
I love this idea
---
Personally i regret starting it late. At first its kind of slow since you constantly need to check wiki for what to use against spesific monsters but once you get used to it that downtime getting new tasks is nothing and its way more fun to train against different kind of monsters. As you asked for money maker skill, there is not better than slayer after you get like 75+ slayer. So yes, you should start slaying straight away.
---
Around 6.4 atm compared to like 10.4 with drake bones (less xp, but a lot more afk), saves you millions.
---
Here's a spreadsheet with some amazing calculators - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit#gid=1432395404](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/edit#gid=1432395404)
---
Thanks!
---
I've always loved how that flail looked since West posted it, so I wanted to find some kind of use for it. I felt that the Bludgeon/Elder Maul already kind of filled the uses as standard weapons, so I tried to come up with something a bit more niche. The idea was to put a bulk of the XP gained in the spec so you'll be spending more on charges and have to pay attention for higher rates. At the end of the day it just comes down to if players think that upping the best melee xp/hour is something the game needs.
---
Have already followed on spotify so should get notifications for future releases ☺️
---
Got a cc name for this??
---
well i did karamja hard diary and mined gemstones for 52-70 mining and got about 7m cash from that and it wasnt that slow
---
But they're in the right to complain so I don't get your point. 
---
PKers have been begging Jagex to deal with the risk fighters abusing AHK &amp; the cheat/bot clients people have been abusing for months now. As for toxicity, no one is really complaining about being called bad words on Runescape. Everyone knows there's huge ego-wars tied into PKing &amp; it's been that way for years.
---
No one is asking Jagex to referee PKing. All the people are asking is for more than a blog post, empty promises &amp; to ban people obviously abusing clients.
---
Tbh my friend has these stats but he has 98 Slayer
---
Tough call. Username implies tank alt, gear implies bonds
---
I slid into your DM’s!
---
Thats where I say "Don't go into wilderness if you arent prepared to die"
---
runecrafting, mining, smithing bars in blast furnace and darts, farming. 
---
there's a lot you can make out of runecrafting but somebody already mentioned it. mining at motherlode mine gives you a great amount of ores which you can smith or sell and its often less than 1 click per ore. there are alternatives, though. you could do karamja hard diary and go after gems from the dairy gem mine.
---
You could do moss Giants. They drop mossy keys, so you can fight bryophyta. She's a little harder than obor.
---
Alright i'll do that then, slayer it is i guess haha. i'll be having the wiki open permanently on the side!
---
I hate the Steven bots, they get hired to spam out areas, wrecking any and all conversation.
---
Oh wow, that sounds really good.
---
Is there anyway to fix my audio issue on mobile? I just got a pair of new bluetooth earbuds and the audio is choppy through them and my other bt earbuds. Game isn't lagging at all, audio sounds fine through my phone speaker. It's just with wireless headphones.
---
Woah. Iv always been scared id meet someone irl that plays and fucks me over like that cx
---
Haha, me too but with nail clippings
---
Oh nein
---
I thought I was on /r/AoE2  lol
---
Got me confused for a sec.
---
Recreating the entire game with new graphics/music/sounds/animations + new expansion 
---
All for only $20!
---
What it actually looks like is a green dragon bot that a credit card warrior bought from some rwt site. Then used his wallet weilding super powers to acquire the justiciar.
---
Haha, me too but with gamer girl bathwater
---
I miss AoE of course I'm more of a star craft or war craft fan myself
---
Man, I'm right with you on this lol. I played "back in the day" and I'm just returning. If there are more of us out there we should get a clan going or something.
---
&gt;Okay i'll look into all that as im not familiar with the terms, but it sounds like you know what your talking about haha. Thanks!
---
if only there were a way to get a picture of your screen without using your phone.
---
Bruh y’all making me wanna play age of empires lol.
---
Ya. Gonna agree with everyone here that it's probably an alt to tank gwd
---
snapdragon is 1/766.5, no?
---
&gt;The year is 2004.
---
Stopped reading right there. It's 2019. Downvoted.
---
With agility potions you could kill blue dragons in Taverly.
---
Personally dont like the looks and its gonna ruin all the map projects everyone has made / has going on.
---
Inb4 shared bank for all
---
This guy knows whats up
---
BIG BRAIN.
---
That'd be cool, Have it as a passive instead of a special attack.
---
Says the person with the "Quit" flair. How can you be in touch with the game if you dont even play it anymore?
---
That helm sounds like the bloodborne story
---
I said 1/10. My bad if the wording was bad. 9/10 are silent.
---
Singles is dead due to teams, add a pj timer
---
Probably hit with lightning if I were to guess. The current probably made the wood grains curl.
---
Rsn?
---
I like this idea also
---
I remember that post, lmao. It's why I shared this. I probably wouldn't be getting downvoted by dozens of maxed sweatys feeling insecure about their high-level alt accounts if I had shared some of his comments. He couldn't explain how he made the money with those stats, and then he logged out. It's not an alt. If it is just an alt, he clearly RWTs on his main as well.
---
It's fake
---
Same thing
---
bot runecraft and agility then play normally, op
---
I hear you have lightly used ggbw available?
---
&gt;funnel for years
---
If you're going to say this, it's a lie by omission if you leave out "since the beginning of the game" because the first bosses abd tune rocks were wild only. It's core to the games design, not griefing
---
I think they should of been originally. I would only be okay with them changing it if there was some way of removing only ones people bought and not ones as drops. But as far as I know, it wouldn't be.
---
not as bad as [this](https://i.redd.it/n3hu2cln8ox21.jpg) 55k hill giants 120k cballs
---
Yea most seems to like the look of the staff and thats great. Special attack however not so much and that's why it's a work in progress. However thank you for the compliment
---
Agreed you have to pay. More often than not the joke is awful, but you genuinely laugh regardless as a compensatory mechanism, assuring you that your 10k was a wise investment.
---
Jagex's latest stance mentioned that they don't approve of any third party client feature that allows you to perform actions in less than the intended amount of clicks, making Menu Entry Swapper against the rules.
---
Will you get banned for using it through Runelite? Almost definitely not. But as per their latest statement, it's against the rules.
---
Is there something wrong with your eyes? No? Get out...
---
My dick is thick and meaty.. Has two veins running down both sides.. Both thick af.. Mushroom head connected to 8 inchs of a meaty meat stick..
---
Hope t90 has a runescape community game!
---
I mostly do bounty hunter and the majority of players are begging jagex to ban ahkers. A lot of us have come together and are more than willing to compile what evidence we have for ahkers.
---
As for toxicity- theres usually only the same handful of players in bh that are toxic. They are also usually the ones who AHK. 
---
Whenever I do pk a PVMER /skilling who is on the bh world they are usually VERY toxic. A majority of pkers I see / play with are very kind and just want to have fun in this game. I have accounts in the 50-80s brackets.
---
I don't actively partake in deep wild because I prefer only single pking so I guess I cant comment much on the scouting bots.
---
I guess you are singling out clans in the post but the title makes it seem it extends to all PKers. Clans are generally very toxic in any community from what I've seen.
---
sure buddy
---
the UI, player and moneys are all upside down please fix that
---
Which we will continue to do until the PVP rule-breaking and cheating is taken care of. Skull tricking alone should be a permanently bannable offence, and I will continue to vote 'no' on anything that crosses the ditch until Jagex addresses it formally, let alone all the other problems like the scout botting.
---
Took my non ironmeme buddy to DKs the other day, I was killing Supreme and Prime for my Seers ring and placeholder archers and he gets a Zerker on his 2nd kill. Pogs were had.
---
Issue is, no one will continue the account after it can’t make money, it won’t stop bots. Why waste that Dev time for an update that just stops that account playing... that’s what a ban already does.
---
Scout bots should be banned and all the clans that use it should be banned as well. It is blatant cheating. Ahk as well. Jagex simply cant because they dont have the capability. And even if they had the capability, they dont have the spine.
---
Nmz with DH is 140k rn, flail should be 200k+ if it uses charges
---
The distinction is irrelevant. Everyone who votes 'yes' to non-PVM content that crosses the Wilderness ditch are all in the same camp as far as the majority poll voters are concerned.
---
This way the playercount flex doesn’t drop and the economy gets better! especially for new legitimate players competing against these bots for materials. Genius idea dude
---
Haha haven't heard that one before
---
Just make it so you can only trade while in the GE. This way it's much easier to spot bots. Less people to hire for bot busting.
---
Farming guild interactions are some of the best
---
It's bankstanders and the active chatty person every once in a while because they teleport in. The dynamic there is valuable.
---
I don't even fight back or try to run half the time,  cause I'm usually just doing scrolls.  
---
It's funny how often pkers say "sit kid" or something after I just let them kill me
---
A very small minority of PvP'ers use AHK + scout bots.
---
Why should the majority be punished because of the minority?
---
Imagine if Skilling never recieved another update because of yew tree botters.
---
Why is it so tilted
---
No, the brim ring is a tribrid ring, this is for melee only.
---
Currently level 60 Slayer, 83 combat (void pure), 91 range. Would like to train to 69 Slayer for MM2. 
---
Ive been doing exclusively wildy Slayer, but wondering if I should switch to Konar (or other?) Slayer master.
---
Mostly after fast xp and cannon-friendly tasks. Don't really care about drops. Thanks!
---
sorry we can't do that because somebody told jagex' current set of mods that tiers are a thing in this game and 80 is like 50x 75
---
Tbow should be 90 but then again doesn't really effect loads of people considering if you have a tbow you're eitehr one lucky fuck or you already got 99 range.
---
I think he's referring to the texture detail rather than vert count.
---
time zones man
---
I mean, not replaced just moved to the dormitory.
---
Suffering every time
---
No it's not, it's 1/3.2k for any muta look it up before replying dumb shit
---
i mean blame rs3 the base of it is from the current version of their tetsu. the point is that because the boss is from the east it has drops from the east, and this is like the eastern armor we have in osrs already mixed with the nicest rs3 set.
---
Cosmic crafting? I would want to die also.
---
Nope, but neither do you apparently. His assessment was pretty spot on to what is currently happening in the game. And instead of providing any legitimate counterpoints, you just insult him.
---
As someone who got a jar of swamp and no other uniques during my zulrah stint, support
---
Runelite loot tracker plugin.
---
from a fundamental standpoint i feel as though pking is broken. i had two friends doing callisto for fun over discord stream, and then they got attacked by a dude in a salad robes who managed to kill one and escape from the other using almost nothing but ice barrage. then when my other friend had him on the ropes he runs away and tps out
---
and i wouldn't be that angry because the wilderness is an "anything goes" area, right? nope, pkers complained about bulwark helping people tank in exchange for not attacking back and got it nerfed. and when you try and say "you should have to risk an equal amount to kill someone using an expensive shield," they will then complain about how going into wildy with ahrims will get them jumped on in multi by clans with scouts.
---
wildy pking is just fundamentally flawed, i don't think it's possible to "balance" it.
---
pk worlds are fun though.
---
Well over 1k like 1.2 to 1.5k maybe.
---
Got wizzy boots 17 clues in and rangers 19. Just get things bro.
---
If a bot is scouting and posting information in a locked cc I think that at the very least the clan leader should be held responsible and get a ban, or even find accounts on the same IP, if in the same clan then ban. There is no consequences for using scout pots so obviously everyone is going to do it.
---
🦀🦀🦀🅱🅾✝✝🅾Ⓜ ✝📧❎✝🦀🦀🦀
---
did jed work on raids
---
But why would you want to grind out the gear again?
---
I imagine this would be beneficial if the bot had no way to easily figure out they were restricted in this way. The bot would continue for a while instead of just making a new account, effectively hindering the person in charge of the bots from making more money.
---
Thanks a lot man, this advice was actually helpful. I was able to find a group who let me pay for the first few kill count. 3 completions in 6 attempts, and I gained a lot of valuable experience.
---
I'm going to check your clan out today :)
---
day and night cycle when
---
@jagex please give us an HD mode
---
bots usually drop trade or table trade
---
Good karma does exist, gz
---
What? No lol
---
Fishing infernal eels is great! Don't need to drop a thing and very afk/ can make decent money there
---
More of these please
---
I bought the same key chain a while ago. My now ex gf just rolled her eyes at me.  She would always be irritated if I brought up things that I enjoyed like OSRS and sports.  I envy guys who have gfs who like you.
---
Nieve will probably be best for xp. Konar is good for points and gp, but the tasks can be very slow
---
But I did make it a thing
---
This is partially the reason why pvp polls get voted against. Jagex needs to fix core issues like these ones before updating pvp again.
---
Makes revetments much less profitable, and therefore much less active.
---
It is currently easily e most active spot for PvP because it’s so profitable.
---
Brilliant
---
But quests suck :(
---
Ya I did a couple vorkath kills on mobile when I was bored waiting for my ride to work. The spiders are definitely the hardest part about it. Other then that it's cake.
---
I don't think you can make them. They're given out by the tutors in Lumbridge.
---
they untradeable at least
---
1/350 for a specific piece or did I miscalc?
---
Dead people are losers
---
Ive seen this so many times, so i gotta ask, why did you black out the ring and feather counts?
---
It's completely unnecessary, if anything we should remove the wildy weapons. They're practically free and make anything wildy related fucking cake. With the amount of gold sinks we have nowadays the raw gp from revs doesn't do shit. Even if it did, they should remove alchs from Vorkath and Hydra not revs lmfao
---
&gt;  fully remastered graphics
---
Just means they gonna fuck up the artstyle.
---
Same str bonus but one costs 2k and the other costs 15
---
Yeah fuck off with your generalisations please and thank you.
---
You lost out on some profit, but you can keep collecting rewards. It's not a one off thing.
---
If you want to play offline try Ironman mode that is as offline as it gets but seeing as the game is a mmo you know that it’s a massive multiplayer online game. Back in the day when the game was seriously thriving everyone used to be very talkative but now all anyone cares about is efficiency and no xp waste not everyone but the majority of people in my opinion. Try members for a month you will find more players but there still will be bots running around who don’t talk for obvious reasons and as for gold like others have already pointed out you will need it sooner or later to gear up your character and progress to end game content.
---
&gt;Omfg
---
&gt;What
---
Lmao
---
I can (and so can who you're responding to) because it's super vague and leaves a lot to interpretation
---
Age of empires 2.
---
thanks for the idea https://i.imgur.com/CyY6uC3.jpg
---
Personally don’t think the setup even makes that much of a difference. My main at 90range/mage in elite void range/ahrims setup gets completely destroyed by my maxed zerker running it in enchanted robes and black d’hide. Main roughly 2-2:30 minutes per kill. Zerker 1:45 or below for the majority. Just my experience and I could be wrong but to me it feels stats make a bigger difference than the gear.
---
Just draw some lines with a marker on your monitor, I don't see the problem...
---
Looks like he’s ready to spill guts &amp; fuck sluts
---
Make sure you complete quests as well. Priest in Peril is tricky with a low HP level, but it's doable.
---
Dandies are such a strange phenomenon.
---
They're the ultimate clout-chasers.
---
Just remove trading
---
[I got u dude](https://i.imgur.com/szXkINI.jpg).
---
The problem now is that these advantages are just metagaming and not using in-game tricks. It's not as easy for Jagex to ban with something that's technically not against the rules and abuses things outside the scope of the game. AFAIK, scout bots to automatically post player info to another chat was either non-existent or very rare in the earlier years. No bonds meant monthly membership had to be paid, scripts weren't as advanced, etc.
---
But now, the technology is there. The playerbase nowadays leans towards efficiency than just doing whatever they want for fun. So a lot of these PKers care more about getting a kill than having a good fight hunting someone down.
---
Wait so the difference between killing 2 skeletons and a bloodworm and doing nothing is the potential of 50-60 blood runes (0 blood runes for not killing anything but brothers) and ~10 death runes extra (potentially)? Or does the overall quantity also increase? i.e if it says 168-210 chaos I'd be more likely to get 210 with a higher %?
---
They're bad at pking and it's a lot of work to hop through all the worlds. It's way easier to use a bot to find people then just hop in with 50 people and delete them
---
What do you mean? It’s an ironman, that means the world is open
---
Yea maybe, maybe not. There isn't really any proof just lots of anecdotal experience. Some people will tell you that the pkers they meet are really nice. Others not so much. Are they lying? I'd like to think they aren't. Is their experience not valid because they didn't have the same as yours? Of course not. If people say "I had a bad experience in the wildy" they are just as valid views as "I had a good experience in the wildy". 
---
And personally I haven't experienced high levels toxicity in the wilderness, I had someone tease me for getting skull tricked as they killed me but it was like "hah skull tricked" which to me is just banter. I have seen very bad toxicity in videos/streams and it just makes everyone look bad. If there was more pking clans that were adamant about "no toxicity/being friendly" I feel like pvp would have less of a stigma against it. Though like I said they probably don't care.
---
Scout bots are fucking cancer but coming from someone that used to clan "pk" I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Its not fucking hard to find someone to fight, stop pretending like it is. Fucking clanners lmao
---
underrated comment
---
Like has been said above, its a data storage issue, if the game was offline capable then all the game data (your weapons, items, stats, monster drop tables, random number generators for EVERYTHING etc.) Would have to be stored locally on your computer making the game files huge, not as much of an issue for pc but mobile would be way out of hand. Not to mention the botters could run their games non stop farming massive amounts of resources with no way to be detected and then they could hop online and sell, wreaking havoc on the economy (more than they already do)
---
I was burying bones at the chaos altar by the lava maze and I swear to you the same lvl 27 was scouting me every world I hopped because soon after he'd login in 3 others would login and attack me. Luckily I was wearing full black d'hide and I knew wtf I was doing, I'd always run towards the Chaos Fanatic and since they're technically not in combat they aggro the Chaos Fanatic and I just run to the Kbd lair and house tab. I always bring a stam pot, 2 sara brews, and a ppot/super restore for these situations.
---
They followed me for over 30 worlds and for nearly 2 hours. 
---
They couldn't kill me lol, and thank God too cause I was using superior d bones lol
---
Similar to all social media :(
---
Jagex is referring to plugins that dynamically mark squares for you based on in-game events. 
---
Its completely different from making squares yourself that don’t change.
---
Well now that's concerning haha. Now I'm not sure what to do. Maybe it's safest to just do Canifis 57-60 (because I would like 82 fishing eventually), and do Seer's on medium diaries until Graceful, which would hopefully be at around 70.
---
Pretty damn neat!
---
This is sweet as hell
---
To retain my identity, I wont post IGN, but Jagex previously curated a list of Community Helpers which have a special title in RS3 and on the forums with extra privileges. They were talking about making the community helper role an ingame role similar to Pmod but because Jagex never talks to their volunteers and doesn't follow through on promises to us, the program kinda stopped with mostly everyone going inactive. It's kinda sad what that could have been.
---
Probably should have specified that it’s a Dodge Viper that shoots and kills everything.
---
It sounds like you've never done any of these bosses
---
I don't recommend using wireless headphones for gaming. Bluetooth adds an unavoidable delay, causing you to hear the sound 200-500 milliseconds after it happens.
---
You won't notice this when watching a movie because your device will compensate by sending the audio before the video. Games are real time, so this isn't an option.
---
Would love to see a daytime/nightime plugin. The skies and light changed as the day went on.
---
can u actualli play like this or is this just some photoshop
---
Oh wow...... This really happened..... Falador HairDresser is common knowledge of this game. I mean, cant blame a nooby for not knowing because runescape is jam packed with content you have to discover. Yeah they should hire Q and A team formed from veteran players who are willing to spend an hour a day on forums, just a eough draft of the idea
---
What? It's  Monty Python and the Holy Grail
---
He probably practiced with markers for a long time before removing them.  Also, the tiles are much more distinguishable compared to the mole and also need a lot less accuracy.  As you can see he clearly clicks past the olm hand multiple times and uses clicks on the hand to reengage and stop his movement.
---
Is that legit?
---
Only a goblinboy would spite vote.
---
no those are unstatic ground markers that change based on game inputs, these are just tiles highlighted.
---
Slayermusiq1 my man. His guides are easy to follow and make quests extememly bearable for people that don’t enjoy them
---
Try a slayer staff switch makes it pretty easy.  Don’t even have to switch tabs.
---
Sell enough items to buy yourself a bond. Then you can give me the rest of your items ^_^
---
Those are all dead as fuck lmao, enjoy pking at vene for 200k loots
---
you don't have to imagine, its right in front of your eyes
---
No, if you remove revs pkers will all quit cause pking at wildy bosses is boring as fuck. How clueless are you lmfao
---
Love me some regex, this is a piece of art
---
Reddit's PvP experience is limited to YouTube videos.
---
it would be interesting if they added jars 2 dks corp kq kbd and so on and made them and all jars from future bosses untradable. 2 atleast give those some sort of value
---
I come to reddit to get away from this
---
This makes me want to buy a Scythe.
---
Tiers have become irrelevant in this game, we already have several items that could very well be t80+. It's a shame that t80 items will get less supported than t75 despite being identical, and that the tier will be used as an argument by those who don't fully understand how good this item is. 
---
T75? Sounds fine. T80? No, that thing must be op.
---
I've talked with one of my buddies about this before. Have different levels of multi. The further into wildy you get the higher the multi ratio is. Certain areas could have no restriction but others  no more than a 3 v1 scenario etc..
---
I’ll give you an one for effort but rest of it sounds non funny.
---

Me too but with war crimes

aren't the basilisk knights basically just glorified superior gargoyles?
---
Rl takes all clue screenshots i think
---
thank you for your service
---
Mine just goes all black
---
''I'm being slaughtered!'' LMFAO!
---
That’s what I’m doing
---
&gt;Yeah, some people just like to grind
---
Sure, but that's abnormal. That's what makes it strange to do rfd that late.
---
Do you play on mobile exclusivity?
---
You guys are fucking with my nostalgia
---
Change it to a mensis cage
---
Because it's interesting and it was fun figuring the method :)  
---
I'll probably never use the method anymore because I've already had the mole pet :P
---
Can't. It's all mems
---
Make their iron man helm a dunce cap
---
You’re still not going to realistically yank 10 people unless you’ve got a ton of tank gear and get super lucky. Even 3 is hard if they’re not shit.
---
Oh no, I care about game integrity and clearly you don't. Sorry that hurts your brain for whatever reason.
---
&gt; This is categorically wrong. It's one player fighting another. Regardless of if someone chooses to make the mistake of not fighting back, it's still a player versus another player.
---
I think we'll just have to agree to disagree here. I don't consider it a "fight" if only one party is participating. You wouldn't call someone hitting a punching bag a "fight".
---
Also, the player being killed isn't making a "mistake" by not fighting back. You, as the attacker, are at a huge advantage because you brought gear specifically for killing players, while the other player brought gear for killing NPCs. If the target player decided to bring PvP gear as well, they would still be at a huge disadvantage because of the loss of inventory space.
---
&gt;He can just be honest and say he gets upset when someone kills him in PvP areas. He doesn't have to pretend like he's being antagonized when someone is doing PvP in a PvP area. That's so ignorant.
---
I will address this (indirectly) in another point.
---
&gt; You might have seen the people talking about basilisks parroting the sentence, "they were designed as mid level content!" when that had never been said in any of the blogs. They just heard other people whining and lying and mimicked it.
---
I actually completely agree with you on this. The reddit hivemind is pretty ridiculous. However, I don't think it really applies here. The OP is talking about their personal experience in the wilderness, and it's an experience a lot of people have (including me). And the "just don't go into the wilderness" argument doesn't really hold up because there's so much content forcing players into the wilderness. Clue Scrolls specifically force players to go into the wilderness. It's even worse for ironmen, the dragon pickaxe, odium and malediction, and all the unique rings are all content that force ironmen to spend large amounts of time in the wilderness. Avoiding the wilderness altogether is just not a viable option.
---
&gt;Wilderness slayer, demibosses, resources, and revs would all be insanely op if they didn't incur the risk of player combat. It encourages the use of non-bis gear, and it's more engaging because of the risk involved.
---
I agree, they would. But personally, I don't think any of this content adds anything of value to the game. I'm for all of this content being removed, and the unique drops from them being moved to other places in the game (except for revs which should be removed entirely.) The unique drops are not what make this content high-reward, it's the large amount of resource drops you get from doing them. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion,  but the friction between the PvP and PvM communities is not healthy for the game. Separating these two communities would allow them both to thrive independently from each other, while forcing them to interact with each other is causing nothing but conflict.
---
Lots of games may, RuneScape isn't one of them.

Lvl 99 virgin
---
&gt;i played with a friends account 
---
&gt;hes account made 2.1b,
---
&gt;I passed myself the gear
---
to jagex that looks like you hacked him and took his stuff
---
Hosidius in the early morning.
---
People forget that a lot of slayer monsters and regular monsters have higher level counter parts to kill, like bloodvelds, dust devils etc that offer higher xp for low/ non existent slayer requirements
---
Yeah the collection log is pretty useless tbh
---
Nice how you blurred your name in chat but not on the drop. KekeHands.
---
Do canifis. You will miss a lot of marks if you skip canifis.
---
Could literally use any program to draw the markers. Could literally draw dots on his screen. Could drop freaking vials there. 
---
If you think tile markers are cheating you have issue.
---
Sweet, I might just do that then!
---
Got this pet at 73 woodcutting. Never wanted him, still dont need him. Unlucky everywhere else though which is nice.
---
I could absolutely be mixing up my dates then actually. It could have been a few years later. But honestly, anything before 6th grade for me was a bit of a childhood blur lol
---
Ironbot BTW.
---
Not only this, but most players will not support bringing those OP equipment down to line to t75 stats because they adapted to the powercreep or already bought it and at the same time vote no to any t80 gear.

As long as the methods dont exceed 40k an hour in rc experience cuz reeee
---
i do not ever want to see wings on an osrs player ever
---
I'd prefer something similar to Turmoil, but toned down. Its maximum boosts could be lower than those of Piety, but paired with the reduction of the enemy's stats it would be better than Piety for extended fights against a single target.
---
Nice work man that’s pretty neat and funny. Not sure why people are flaming or calling you sweaty. It’s really a cool idea and not that hard looking.
---
Go for 70 att 60 strength. Get straight into warriors guild and grind for dragon defender while working on 60 def (to be able to equip it). Use whip to train defense here, and when you achieve it, swap to training strength up a whole bunch. Ideally you go for like 75 att and 75 defence and then work on strength into mid 80s. You can leave defense alone after 80 because nothing else higher to equip, and magic casting during slayer can level it a bunch as well.
---
*Literally* running circles around the enemy.
---
He had me in the whole part, what you mean the first half?
---
been waiting over 6 months for jagex to get back to me about a hacked account(Authenticator was removed yet my 2FA email wasn't compromised?) Good luck my dude.
---
Also salve ammy for the skeletons
---
If you're just looking to do pvm/bossing and aren't interested in anything else, just stick your account at sand crabs until base 60s, get obby armour/berserker neck/obby sword, then stick yourself in nmz until like base 90s.
---
If you want a rounded account which lets you do more content, questing is a good way to start. Check out the optimal quest guide on osrs wiki
---
didn't know that they had electric lights in middle ages
---
More like lumbridge
---
That's fucking awesome, wow.
---
You need to get the torso and d skirt though.
---
It’s true, but there’s people like that in every community, and if you spend a whole night in the wildy, you’re more than likely to come across some extremely toxic pkers 
---
Spend time in the ge and you’ll probably see toxic players in there occasionally. Difference is that the ge has significantly more people that you can see at a single given time, so the overall proportion of toxic players is far less outside the pker community
---
I was just opening the idea for discussion feel free to speculate, I’m not assuming anything.
---
“Hey, players have been asking for time and seasonal effects for years, should we give them that?”
---
“Fuck no, make Crafting 2.0”

&gt;83 combat

Prayer SkillCape emote, checkmate bucko
---
Edgeville at dusk, when the baddies come out
---
Like around the zammy mage
---
If you can get a craw's bow, I think wildy slayer can be pretty ridiculously fast. Otherwise you don't really have any good xp slayer masters.
---
He can go for 1 scroll for the music track, or all of them for the champions cape
---
Your client only sends packets of information like where you flicked, and what pixels needed to be displayed. The game is being ran on a server elsewhere. When you click your client is asking permission from the server to make that move. It it make sense then it goes through with the action then sends that info back to your computer and you see your action played out.
---
If you where to play offline you wouldn't get passed the login screen. Well you might say well adapt it to be able to play offline. Well there's no anti-cheating checks that way, so you could just go offline cheat your heart out and come back with whatever you want. That and you bi-pass many of the resources in this game that are meant to be limited. Like rune rocks, or revenants. Why get pked by losers If I can just play offline and not worry about pkers at all?
---
So a offline mode would not make sense in any regard to this game. What would make more sense if jagex let you host your own server (cause the game engine itself is a server side port) and charge you money for that.
---
The examine text: Some form of ancient terraforming device. Oh deere it looks broken.
---
Perhaps I am :)
---
The wise old man probably took some from the cave goblins
---
Rigour isn't a waste. 1 kill trips definitely are a waste.
---
If you can afford rigour and DHCB you should use both. As you will get far more kills per hour. Rigour is the single best dps increase in ranged over absolutely any other piece of gear. It even trumps being higher level in range in situations.
---
And DHCB is just undeniably better at vorkath, and you don't need to BGS spec then.
---
So if your question is just "is better gear and prayers not worth the money to me if i don't care to do anything better?". Than no, probably not. But I don't really understand your mindset.
---
Called Hydrocephalus for those wanting to know more
---
Don't know, but I'm sure that where something can be exploited, it will be
---
Edit: maybe they buy stacks of pvp supplies before they get the bot ironman status
---
I don’t get it. Why are mid-level players suddenly feeling entitled to BiS items? The basilisk knights should be harder than the regular basilisks — kind of like Demonic Gorillas are a harder option for Black Demons. No-one’s forcing you to do the Knights. 
---
The way mid-level and/or simply unskilled players are now whining because they can’t just afk their way to a BiS item is kind of amazing. Should they nerf every boss in the game too so you can afk your prims, blowpipe and infernal cape as well?
---
Yeh you lost some potential this time around. But no biggy, next collection will just be a bit better now :)
---
ive been playing the same account for 3 months how does a transfer after 3 months look like a hack wow....
---
max str with scythe is better than elite void with scythe
---
WeDoRaids discord - there you can get into raidz
---
my account only had like 8hrs made i was starting to play at midnight so i just started with crafting
---
Reminds me a bit of Ultima Online. Looks sick.
---
noo pls, reddit karma us the only thing my kids eat, ur taking away MY lively hood
---
brews are most likely your best option, bring normal restores to get your magic lvl back up. may want to check out rendi's video of lowest cb ma2 cape for ideas
---
yeah i dont want to see anyone doing that emote, i bleach my eyes frequently when visiting the ge
---
safe/dangerous death is about whether you lose hc status though, in this case that's different from whether you lose items
---
Well, there goes your chance at a record.
---
Yep, just a few thousand big bones haha.
---
I don’t think this is OP’s fault and you’re direction is fucked.
---
Or we make it part of the Eagle Transport System... Yah, Slayer would probably be better.
---
im an ice poseidon subscriber
---
Good thing there will be mods.
---
But he said pet for the second one
---
Hey yeah!
---
Nezzy/Serp DPS. Guthans for range defense. Verac for prayer.
---
My ign is: TrollerVn btw
---
Drop but don't show. Just disappear
---
It's not an impressive achievement, but, it was my first ever cape and I got lucky enough with a pet for it, too. I play on mobile 99% of time, so I put it off until now (106 cb) as this was the first time I got to play PC in months
---
Thats my favorite one 
---
(Time to go kill vorkath)
---
RIP drop parties, iron's dropping items to their main, sharing supplies with your group while bossing
---
Lol, you’re blind then
---
Fantastic!
---
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Didn't ask.
---
Runelite plugin mate, all that data is there for you.
---
Congrats on getting that kill! A PB is a PB is a PB...and as time goes on, you'll get better at switching, better at adapting, and better at everything needed for kills. In my experience, OSRS PvM has a steep learning curve to begin with, but it levels out. It's hard to go from 0 kills to 1 kill, but it gets pretty easy to go from 1 kill to "I can do this easily." If you think you'd enjoy it once you get the hang of it, go grind out a few more kills and see. You'll be surprised with how quickly you get comfortable. All that said, it might be worth it to get your ranged lvl up, since BP quickly starts to out DPS trident as you get to higher lvls. Mage-only Zulrah isn't super efficient long-term
---
If you're short on cash at the moment, there's nothing wrong with going to back to your own personal "Old Reliable" money maker. Just be sure to have some fun!
---
I got no idea as to why those scouting bots are level 12. 
---
Edit: Weird how im getting mass downvoted for just having a conversation. I really dont get it.
---
Should I post Everytime I do cooks assistant on a new account?
---
 Fuck off with these karmawhore posts
---
They still flower in the GE.
---
or do it like rs3 where you can toggle what time of the day it is. Of all the shit in rs3, that's one of the few good things that I'd like in osrs too.
---
RS3 also lets you put filters on like the warm filter so that my eyes don't burn from playing for more than 20 mins
---
So you're telling me that pkers aren't actually toxic from your experience
---
Is that meant to be a way of mentioning auto switchers etc?
---
Shilo Village might be pretty neat!
---
If you want good pvp come to albion online
---
thats actually cool as fuck
---
i like the risk vs reward of pvming in the wildy its a great game design tbh and its a classic very few gams have nowadays
---
Ladies and gentlemen your average pker.
---
idk if it has to outstrip bandos in dps. could just be similar. already said in another post here because it's sleeveless and chainmail the only thing it should shine at defensively is crush, and since it's zaros-eastern it'd be negative prayer bonus, probably allowing for better stats.
---
Is making fun of someone trolling them now?
---
this is peak fashionscape material right here
---
I’ve failed my last two times and I have plenty of stats for it. I’m just a scrub and can’t prayer flick properly during the healer phase. I think this is a great achievement, gratz man!
---
3 months ago they removed XP from splashing in the Lumbridge area. This guy was still doing it.
---
So close to greatness lol
---
If you played WoW or any Multiplayer Source game you would know.

I thought for sure it was another ad for a site selling bots lmao
---
No. This level of awkward is perfectly adorable.
---
tablefish... i love it
---
Lvl 91 atm, ugh

Bwana
---
I like this idea way too much. 10/10 would play
---
You should look up the b0aty zilyana method
---
This is great.
---
Pk'ing was fun when I geared up years ago and faced off against people my age, who had hodge-podge weird setups like mine. 
---
Now? All the fun has been sucked out of it. You either follow the established meta builds/account builds or you aren't going to PvP. You either have the money or you don't. You either spastically obsess over gear switches etc. beyond special attacks or you don't do it at all.
---
No fun at all. It's like Sand Casino.
---
I kinda like wing cosmetics in most games. Wow has a cool set of priest hear with wings and a good iirc that looks really dope.
---
However, I hear that rs3  has wings and they aren't that great. Is that why you do not want them in old school?
---
Or do you think wings just don't fit the style of OSRS? I can kinda understand that, I'm not sure how they would design them to look good.
---
If by close you mean not close then sure.
---
This should be written just like that at the top of his wiki page
---
Borderless water and overlapping buildings... nice! OP definitely knows their way around the AoE2 map editor
---
What have you been smoking?
---
Are bank sales filter by this?
---
Mod Ash did respond on twitter last night, said their are a few other acc's with similar issues. Should have a mod and their team work on rectifying it when they're available
---
are you that cunt that stole the 50 dollars mum gave me for the town show when i was 12?
---
i was going to buy gravitron rides and a shirt with that you absolute FUCK (pretty sure it was you brother you know who you are fucking comment on me when ive got 2 dollars becuase of your mother and you dont want to share a tin of fucking tuna ull get urs)
---
I don't know the exact most optimal, but I like to keep my attack/strength around same level. If you just go straight for attack you'll be missing a lot of strength levels that make leveling faster. 40 defense is fine for a good while. Level that up last
---
Wut? I'm sorry I don't get the reference
---
I mean this isn't a problem nor an abuse of any 3rd party client plugins. It can easily be done with a bit of practice just like people did for tile-specific movement in the old days. This is just some really big brain controlling of movement.
---
Why are you wearing boots of stone and not d boots?
---
I mean sure it might, but at the same time, is it as easy as right clicking the world map button and clicking one of the options?
---
Also, you can edit skyboxes and such, so you can actually set it to noon/dusk/night/dawn or other things.
---
Read: "You're not leaving me enough loot."
---
Post ge history

Damn im moist

Not real I had one in for 100k for months now and it would’ve bought before 119 gp
---
if you're doing things properly it doesn't really have a good use apart from milking the inferno. Dks, inferno learning, and solo tob are the only places where there's a decent argument for using it. Everywhere else you should just be taking claws/dds. If Prims give you a max hit then it's a no brainer, sell the SGS.
---
*me turning SkyBox on and off*
---
This is an awesome drawing
---
No. Really, no. In any kind of dungeon the skybox defaults to 'so fucking dark you can't see shit'.
---
9/10 people play with the skybox set to 'daytime' so they can actually see the floor.
---
Honestly it's more believable like this than with a (possibly edited) screenshot. Grats.
---
I just need the average viewer count to be able to submit my request :)
---
The pvm side is toxic too so calm down bro, i got my fair share of toxic pvmers that were mad at me because I conplained about something. And it's the wilderness, if you don't want to get tea bagged then don't go there. And this isn't just about making money, it's about the thrill of clapping some idiot that was doing a task.
