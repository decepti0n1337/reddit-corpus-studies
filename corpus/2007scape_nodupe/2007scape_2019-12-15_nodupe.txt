Ya it's weird it logs me in and then logs me right out. It's probably blocked on their wifi. I'll just have to do the christmas event on the long ride home!

---
Thank you sir! I appreciate it
---
I’ve done almost 1k zulrah, just did ds2 today and started vork. It’s infinitely easier IMO.

[removed]
---
what?
---
It looks like the skull from the victors of the fight pits.
---

---
Edit: caves -&gt; pits
---
That sounds a lot like regular game mechanics to me. I see how it's kind of iffy but not enough to fault someone for using it.
---
This aged out well.
---
It is and its the fight pits, you dont get a skull for killing jad.
---
I downloaded the apk for mobile its confusing as fuck to me so I just sit at the GE opening my free presents every day.

the shield of arab! a fine quest indeed. good luck on your travels.

You watching the heismen trophy award tonight?

Hey you died an honorable death, time for wilderness content!

I agree with you though not sure what he thinks we are going to think happened.

Hey diddo!!

It’s funny I came here to comment that was my platoon at boot camp lol. 2111 btw

I've had no lag at all today, minus the quick disconnect this morning, other wise it has been smooth sailing since. Maybe its your connection? do an internet speed test.

legit the most intense rs clip i ever saw

no the sigils that you attach to the spirit shield are all different shapes

Costs so many bonds to make 2 new f2p accounts huh
---
A persona that never turns off?
---
This is so dumb but I’m cackling
---
Think you need prayer, I don't see how people can take a mage, range hit with no prayer.
---
what kind of utopia is this?
---
Thank you :)
---
Thanks mate
---
Anime is for pedos
---
Don’t you need at least 40 prayer to survive jad? Or is it possible to tic eat all his attacks
---
Did you actually have any basis for it though? Like calculating xp or knowing the suffering/recoil method?
---
Everyone is focusing on the air rune, I think they look amazing
---
Tick eat with the ring of recoil bug?
---
Lol. I mean it shouldn't have mattered since  I was never supposed to go there
---
Big mad?
---
Hell yeah, I'll take a free bond every time I have to refresh my quest cape! EZscape for life!
---
I would love dragon tier next league, this league I’m too focused on working towards maxing my main so I have only being doing afk stuff on leagues while runecrafting on the main so pretty much no combat and no clues and combat and clues make up 47% of the tasks so there’s no way I’ll be able to make dragon lol. Ideally I’ll have enough for two slayer helmets or maybe one helmet and the outfit if the slayer helms aren’t worth much on the ge
---
Top mad
---
Twitter replies said his total combat xp totaled to 492, this really isn't far away. 172+172+80 is 424 xp. (edit: 432xp actually, you can fit two extra hits if you go for 1 atk 3 def instead)
---
All is left is to find a way to use the recoil trick to tick-eat for the entire game. This sounds impossibly complicated though...
---
I have a 2014 and use RuneLite and it will crash after a bit if I’m watching YouTube as well
---
which you could build for a fraction of the cost lol
---
Does anyone know how to calculate the accuracy of vorkaths mage attack? I was 78 magic and felt like I was taking a lot of damage. I trained magic to 92 and now I’m wondering if getting to 99 would make that big of a difference.
---
I need to do this quest. You wanna team up to get it done?
---
LuL yOu GoT mE GoOd
---
Well yes, this is Apple we’re talking about
---
LOL no
---
World?
---
So is tick eating bug abuse? What about inventory stalling? If someone had just discovered one of these today there would be people arguing about it just like this. The severity of a bug doesn't affect whether it's bug abuse or not, just what level of bug abuse.
---
I was just saying it as a joke I respect a 14 cp fire cape I’m just not dedicated enough to even try something like that
---
make a main first
---
then experiment with builds
---
nah lol
---
That is very weird.
---
Those options are listed in order of both fastest xp and highest cost
---
Go down the list if you don't want to spend money (obviously knife/dart depends on what tier you use, rune knives or mithril darts are probably the highest you want to go unless you choose to use bp)
---
Check out the dps calculator by bitterkoekje to see the theoretical xp/hr you'll get
---
If there’s someone I can get in contact with that y’all know if it would be greatly appreciated

Blast furnace requires half the coal amount. Steel bars is 1:1 mithril 1:2 instead 1:4 etc. Plus you smelt literally 4-5000 an hour. Thats where the money is, quantity.
---
Personally I havent gotten there yet - but I have read enough about it. Im 55 smithing now and plan to smelt all my MLM ores there ive aquired from getting 31-72 mining.
---
Use optimal quest guide for quest, take advantage of any high rarity herbs by using them in undiseasable patches when you learn farm locations are weiss,troll stronghold,and hosediuis 100% favor, also do all the achievement diaries you can for supplemental cash on bow strings battle staffs etc
---
Pretty sure the Nightmare is going to be all of those things and more. Not sure what you’re getting at here
---
Just did the mud rune grind to 77, made close to 40m too, thanks due to pvp updates, even at normal prices they are very profitable
---
i dont have that much time to commit to this game. ive capped all skills at 70 besides combat, along with construction at 83 and maaaybe agility in the future. ill probably just stay 60-80-70 and enjoy the lower cmb
---
You are. Panic isn't something people decide to do.
---
outer ring of chaos rune needs to be orange, very nice
---
I remember somebody posting a while ago that rendi also sold inferno capes but stopped once his YouTube channel started taking off.
---
I s the why Jad keeps killing me.... -.-
---
Outrage culture is the norm for everything now, it’s not limited to this sub and it’s not going away anytime soon unfortunately.
---
did you even shffldrlshn the 360s?
---
Okay then why did he get 5 defense? This would mean 8 combat fire cape is possible.
---
Donaldfire shield
---
Get fucked no one can get a fc at 7 combat not even rendi. @ me if this gets proven
---
If I was rich id gild you
---
To the top my bwana.
---
You aren’t wrong because you’re stating your opinion, but the vast difference in general popularity between Verf and Settled definitely demonstrates that the opposite opinion is way more prevalent
---
Level 2 combat firecape is inevitable
---
Helmetscape
---
Can someone enlighten me on the source of this meme
---
[deleted]
---
Maybe people assume you are an NPC? Wat.
---
Kemp F
---
The ring didn't have recoil effect on release so that's not entirely true
---
Huh?
---
From what I’ve been told, get suffering (i) -&gt; torm -&gt; anguish. Worked well for me!
---
Would the LMS 0 xp method be considered as an oversight as well then? Since you gain no xp in LMS to avoid anyone from getting xp (skillers, obby maulers and so on). They fixed it by stopping the cannon from rotating when you enter the minigame. They stopped you from being able to get extra brews by not being able to use mole packs in inferno.
---
Do slayer and change based on the task. Use a cannon when possible
---
Safespottable? Magic shortbow (I)
---
No safespot? Rune crossbow and best offhand you can use
---
Blow pipe once you’re able
---
Right so then it would be completely arbitrary to decide who has the "real" record, and would ultimately come down to a popularity contest, which would be silly

Very nice vid, makes me wanna start and ironman

Umm i wanna get max melee work on my depression and maybe 95 slayer
---
From gargoyles, not just grotesque guardians
---
Where is this patch located though
---
tiny tip that might be useful relatively soon: you can buy pineapples from the charter in brimhaven then note them at the tool leprechaun next to the fruit tree patch just south. Grab a knife then you have a (mostly) stackable food source for wintertodt
---
lots of huge things like zulrah banking and looting bag and nmz money storage etc but those are covered pretty extensively by uim efficiency guides, if you want to seek those out
---
You sure? Tried that and the healers keep healing him to the point where I can't kill him, even when I try to lure them, I die lmao
---
Jagex reported attacks on their servers after the mobile crisis bullshit
---
I've been 76 99 75 for along time. I will say it is not excellent for bossing, you will struggle just a little bit more at bosses because of your low attack and low defence..dont get me wrong you can tackle anything you want. You just wont last as long as a main. 
---
Looking at it from a medium do it all build, I'd say it's the way to go. Pretty much everyone at your level bracket on pvp is going to be a dharoker. 
---
But dont listen to me. Play like you like, personally I've made the decision to go 99 99 75 and I'll probably go ahead and max when I get there. Cheers
---
Hence the humor tag
---
Yeah I agree the PvP thing isn’t a huge issue, but still shit like that shouldn’t happen
---
Reminds me of the vengeance dungeoneering saga kinda
---
They should invest in DDoS protection
---
lol only 14 cmb?
---
Agreed, but its Jagex, you gotta remember that
---
HE FESTIVE!
---
Where was it reported/announced? Just curious you’d think they would make an announcement on the main page instead of leaving players who pay money ($11 btw) in the dark
---
My secret is to overlevel the F out of it. Screw doing it at 26 combat when I can do it with 90+ combat stats and a blowpipe. Even then it took me around 3 tries.
---
Unless they find a way to beat it without overhead prayers.

My teacher set up Prodigy a few days ago me and my friend have been grinding since two days ago and I’ve reached level 50, he’s reached lvl 60. 
---
You can get a 7 day free trial by linking a parent account, I’ve done that and it help you level up faster and the higher level the harder questions I believe it is.
---
Prodigy is from 1st grade math to 8th grade which is really good.
---
It was on the main page iirc edit : https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/old-school-connectivity-issues?oldschool=1#_ga=2.92502558.2039690708.1576371774-147928588.1576184823
---
Im just gonna r/woooosh myself.
---
Pretty funny how servers crash and rendi magically has new fire cape record the next day. Pretty obvious rendi and company is behind the server attacks.
---
You're 100% correct. Zezima isn't even close to the level of modern day maxed sweatys. EHP wasn't really even a thing back in the day. All his XP was simply time investment.
---
Lmao they removed random events that can kill you why not that too
---
update graphic drivers
---
Wish I had the patience for questing
---
&gt;either way. the spear is an overall better option than the dagger
---
No it isn't, stop acting like you know shit, do you really think you know better than people who have spent several hundred hours on this stuff?
---
And to think that they fucked up on something as core as their weapon is just funny.
---
The spear has a higher max hit AND only allows you to train on shared or defensive, since shared gains you way more cmb levels it is absolute trash, and increasing your attack is strictly better than defence, hence why the dagger is the preffered option.
---
I came here to say this. Never noticed any issues other than the soul rune colour. Like you said, could be lighting cause of the tone.
---
Just log in and find out
---
I never get phishing emails, now I feel left out.
---
Would been nice seeing Woox and Mudkip on league. Zezima back in the day; still have the screenshot from when I was like 9
---
100% real, go for it
---
What exactly is going on with the sustained DDOS attacks on Jagex servers? What are they trying to accomplish?
---
weird cause I just got forced logged out on my computer
---
I'll pay you 10k
---
Lowest level fire cape record
---
Same king
---
m8 that’s 1k points. And with slayer, you have to do atleast 1 damage to have it count towards a kill unlike fight caves. This will raise his combat significantly
---
I’m sure you’re an expert in Tibetan symbols and don’t just recognize this one because of its use in recent history
---
recommend learning how to screenshot first
---
Yes level 3 required,
---
I just took a pic on my phone.
---
I don’t use Reddit on my computer
---
You can if its in your protected item, but they only got a value of 1 so i dont think anyone can survive before dropping everything
---
This is oddly disturbing..
---
From someone that did 1600 zul kills without suffering, I’d get it first. Won’t take to long to make enough for another Zenny
---
Like Jiglojay
---
sigh
---
No it's a similar oversight to pray flicking, tick manipulation, and flinching. The mechanic is working as intended, it's just effectively unnoting recoils.
---
True, didn’t really think of the xp
---
Thanks! You can add me if you want, my name is yuyuzar15
---
don't forget the tricorn hats, they'll be a massive pain in the ass.
---
Make sure you can get Khazard helmet iirc you can't get post quest
---
lol people saying you can't ignore healers even though you can realistically dps down jad in like 10-20 seconds with dragon darts and you could even bring claws, as a very generous time frame
---
It's true I saw the screenshot before he deleted it.
---
most servers are fucky right now I got booted off 421. 329 has been fine since.
---
I agree, I only go with trusted friends
---
This can be spoofed
---
Laughs in toxic blow pipe
---
Is that what I'm experiencing right now? Getting random disconnects
---
Nope.
---
If you died in pvm you have an hour to get back to where you died and grab your stuff. Hopefully you remember which world you were on.
---
Did someone say moms credit card?
---
Your best bet is to look up pvm clans on the osrs forums and see if there is one that does learner raids that you meet the reqs for.
---
Ring didn't recoil on release. The recoil ability was an afterthought.
---
Well he's not wrong though. A lot of great items and character upgrades are locked behind quest. Things such as barrows gloves, ancient magic spells, fremmy helmets, etc. Setting goals to unlock these things is a great way to progress through the game.
---
ah fuck, this is gonna be fun
---
Oops
---
Edit: You can get the helmet again, I just went over and picked it up out of the chest :)
---
Anti-Fired Shield
---
Oh you're right :D ty
---
It’s true, I did misspell dumb. However, your comment is still deleted. At least for me and whoever commented on my last response. Tbf I think autocorrect got me.
---
How bout they're all great and I looked forward to all of their vids
---
Don’t forget Castle Wars as well. Can’t imagine all those tickets will be easy.
---
Yup just died at vorkrath 😔
---
Would you be willing to share the document you made in planning this guide? The video was great but if following I'd love to be able to use the written guide and then refer back to the video if needed.
---
307 just went off too rip my hc probably
---
It won't be, but it'll definitely be a story :D
---
I remember being (very) slightly annoyed that the drops weren’t highlighted on the ground the way runelite highlights my valuable drops (like 20m+) since the value wasn’t supposedly over 20m as concidering the GE price. It just somehow feels even more awesome to get something like a GWD drop to have the highlight being so pretty.
---
Edit: God do I sound nerdy..
---
Not sure why he's calling the previous cape bug abuse but the level 9 cape is abusing a bug with ring of recoils/ ring of suffering. I tested the bug and it does work but Its not confirmed that's what rendi has used yet. 
---
Still very neat to use a bug to achieve something like this. Its not like he's impacting anyone elses gameplay.
---
sucking dick is perfectly fine, idk what that guy's problem is
---
You don't have to pay the foreman anymore as soon as you hit level 60 :) just need the 72k/hr gp in the coffer :)
---
You really learn to appreciate it even more when you try to use wikis for other MMOs. They are total shit with tons of info just not there. RS3 and OSRS have by far the best game wikis ever.
---
I like to imagine the shield is sentient and part of the Gnome Child's soul, sort of like a Horcrux.
---
No man, I know exactly what you get! It’s all about the highlights!
---
Aww cute noob lvl3 painting runes
---
346, got me during Olm
---
Haha, nice to know I’m not the only one! Good luck on your future adventures, hope you get lots of those highlights!

Not allowing noted items would basically block UIMs from doing fight caves

I seen it first!

Rune scim higher dps
---
61 att scrap acc
---
I think there’s a lot left out here but that’s an insane goal good luck
---
What the fuck.
---
I kind of agree they need to spicen up revs a bit. Remove cave and allow them to roam freely in the wild is a great idea. That’s how they were initially in rs2
---
Well I'll be damned completely worthless
---
Goodluck getting the IM, UIM, HCIM helms.  Kidding of course. Cool goal, good luck for real
---
You chose to limit yourself
---
still, theres still gonna be a lot of people who didnt know of it and have the means to ddos regardless so theres definitely a larger stress on the servers than before.
---
oh look another expert
---
thanks for the feedback man. i have been working on it myself for a bit so its coming along great! tough but fun.
---
What do you mean lmao , i’m not an iron man
---
Lucky man
---
It's not working on mobile for me either and I tried to go on website to get on to Aus worlds to log on! fucking sick of this shit now. spent over 6000 hours playtime to have this shit!
---
what even happened here
---
Exciting :)
---
if everyone was rich then prices would go up  to reflect the economic change?
---
I thought the rapid fire pace of the video worked well with the quick clips. If something like this had been out when I started my iron I would have been I. Heaven! I’m the one dude tho just followed the quest guide  but didn’t really know why or how to do it faster :/ 
---
That being said I had a difficult time hearing what you were saying. It may have been the modulations in your voice or the background music competing either each other. You could try tweaking your tracks; increasing the volume of the voice track or decreasing the volume of the music track. This would help ensure that everything you are saying doesn’t getting muddied by the background. 
---
Just my 2¢
---
I get that every now and then, but also not being able to log onto a handful of servers. I personally can't get on 330 or 337 but other people I've asked can get on those worlds without issue.

No exceptions for copypastas, downvoted

nice joke, downvoted for fcape reference

No.

Alright but you heard of Dr Mundo?

Perfect time to smoke, an afk HashCatt will be there waiting for you!

Yeah that’s crazy, I can’t complain yet but dunno if my rng is good or not
---
Fk yeah you the man
---
No. He didn't. He chatted privately to try and exploit a bug for his own purpose, someone took it for something malicious, and he did the right thing and alerted Jagex.... *After it happened*.

Pshh...

logged out to take a pic, that's xp waste.

Less view, more yew.

Can i get downvotes too please
---
It's the same integer combat, but decimal wise it's lower?
---
Ehh, I don't think so. Benefiting from an item without it's stat requirements screams bug to me

Saw this too late, but congrats on the achievement! ☺️
---
Awesome! My name is Bobbyv206 I play on my phone sometimes at work to check things but I won't be on for a few more hours.
---
Don’t fret man. Got my first firecape at 91 range, 90 hp, and 106 cmb. It’s easy if you don’t choke on the switches during the healer spawns, which I did every time until I didn’t.
---
Bout to do it rn. Come here! 5-10 min from now

Theres  also that headpiece that costs like 200m?? Some halo right...

The dialog in Doric's Quest is the best, if you bring the items on first contact

Same sometimes it'll change tho if I change world's or randomly when I log in :/

What the hell are you wearing lol

Love it, nice one :)

Who cares.

I did always love the first week of dead man mode.

Tbh I thought if you just forced everyone onto one of three teams that you'd be able to maintain that same feeling you got in the first week for a little bit longer.

Beauty of a username there

Why? They are great prayer xp

Assuming the "found a level 9 . . ." post was the first post that saw the cape, it appears to be around 12 hours, 40 minutes.
---
I like the cut of your jib
---
Damn it! I'm going to be asleep at that time :/

They won't actually be that bad. Just bring an alt in for the other team and dump buckets of water into the vats for easy tickets

What elven helmets?

It'll be easy. Just afk

Arcane spirit shield doesn't need to be better though, like why power creep shit for no reason.
---
That’s the new elf town right?

Did the Quest darkness of hallowvale after a few years again on my iron man. Already had a headache thinking about doing the Quest but your quick guide made me rush through it. Only hassle was finding the fireplace a second time (think it was more my fault though) but real well done!
---
&gt;Noone would play TL if it dissapeared without rewards.      
---
Again, you're wrong there, champ. You really think no one would play this new, fun game mode if there were no rewards? I guess you're psychic if you can tell everyone's intentions for playing Twisted League.
---
You could but it would require a second member account :(
---
There's no way he's above drop rate for the 3a sword or the dragon chain at least.
---
Maybe next time don't do high level boss content while servers are constantly getting hit offline. Jagex released more than one statement saying they were/still are getting direct server attacks. When Jagex is forced to make a statement about server attacks then you know it's time to stop doing any dangerous content on your hardcore until they say it is resolved.
---
i wouldnt do pyramid till 75 still can fail that 1 type of obstacle so do barb fishing till 75 agility
---
agility can be done whenever- id suggest at least like 76 out of the gate.
---
thieving is good- depending on your pathing master farmers (90+, aim for ardy hard long term) is good.
---
fishing imo is a little scuffed- fishing is pretty inferior to just buying food and karams are great to fish even with poor fishing level- i'd say at least get like 65~70. 
---
can start progressing for rune gloves, bit of slayer, then barrows gloves.
---
&gt;Go for 75 agility at pyramid? 
---
would not do agility pyramid. just do rooftops. you have your early game money maker @ 99 fm, that gp should last you till konar slayer.
---
Is this a perma change? They should make pets tile block pvm. I usually kill varrocks guards and feed him good Boi bones so I can stack followers with my lovely beaver pet girlfriend I've nicknamed roadkill cause everyone keeps stepping on her. Also call her a him because I respect the trap beaver GFS pussys pronouns.

Tehnoobshow is teh only show

Wow, I have never heard about this until now. That's crazy

No as in you think its a bad idea? Im open to suggestions!

If you do a series. I’m in!

I'm going to put junk in the chest because I'm the Grinch and I want to ruin Christmas

You should have checked potential tasks before hand, you're a HCIM, you need to be careful.

I don't. Teeth rasping for 3 minutes followed by their jaw locking is not sexy. Just skip it and do something both actually enjoy

that’s fucking rough

IM?

Watching his technique made me understand why I haven't been able to ever do shit effectively with a scythe.
---
I always went for the bottom instead of trimming then going for the bottom when trying to use a scythe.
---
Time to create 1000 bots, and have them stand on every square and spam click. Ty for the mills
---
not sure if a joke, but axes were called axes from the start. They were changed to "hatchets" somewhere in like 2010 or something, to which I objected. "Axe" is the oldschool name for them.
---
I swear that would be the funniest shit ever. It would really show the rest of the world how dumb  most Americans are lmao.

Bp for vork then some kind of crossbow with ruby bolts (e) for galvek

Very interesting idea, good luck :)

They shouldn't

“Pretty shit game knowledge” about SKIP farming? When I boost slayer points I don’t reset. Why the hell would I do that when I can boost and hit 250 or 500 completed tasks? I deleted this shit show thread and people are still commenting. No wonder everyone talks so much shit about this sub.

Yea you can, you just make whatever element tiaras you have the talismans for
---
Well golly gee
---
Ok but I'm not suggesting that you should get a KBG slayer helm for being an ironman. As it is certain colors are much harder to get than others so I don't understand how this is a valid argument. Btw I don't even have an ironman so please stop flexing at me.
---
I've been on temporarily this morning and took numerous attempts over several hours to get on. I've just went to log on again, having abit of time to myself and it's still not working. This is on mobile, but nonetheless it should work!
---
Impressive.
---
Blast furnace can be unlocked in a day or so and that can make like 700k-2m/h whilst getting some really nice xp.
---
People focus a lot on combat and having higher combat and unlocking zulrah or vorkath will be great money makers but skilling can be very profitable with only 30 smithing and a little mining.
---
is your phone a literal square
---
Ooooooooo baby!!!!! That’s my fav one
---
12.9 inch iPad
---
Also I hate to break the news to you if you haven't been keeping up, but in roughly a month, hundreds of players are going to have a slayer helm cosmetic that's much easier to get than a slayer helm on an ironman.
---
Maybe, maybe not. There's no way to come of as not bragging, but I have just accepted that I'm on the larger side and wont get good head.
---
Is that a WiFi rune?
---
What's next trimming clothes?
---
And please can we get the heads back when we take them off the wall!?
---
Crystalmathlabs is the answer. Much better site.
---
Why is it even possible to recolor a standard helm?
---
that means give strangers your gp and rtey gonna complete your quests.
---
We may wanna start downvoting him again so his proof survives....he’s running out downvotes
---
What do you mean it's "not that bad". The 340+ k/hr method is easily the most "afk" method of doing them. Go to furthest west from south of castle wars with 26 or so bellows and fill them up, pick up chompy, put it down immediately, rinse and repeat. The birds come flying in.
---
People exaggerate chompy hunting for literally no good reason, you could get the elite kc done from hard diary in 2 hours.
---
I know it's picky, but I feel like the Nature rune (the upside down noose one) should be a lighter green too
---
If I see your notifications I’ll click fast as I slap green dragon bot back to lumby
---
Hyahyahyahya o wow
---
My man. Love it
---
wish i could make artwork like these.

You can just buy the branches from the GE. Unless you're an ironman, then you need the farming level.

High risk worlds with 30m+ risk. Do it! /s

I always remember going and doing stuff like that while doing boring grinds. Just try out through trial and error what a bunch of the alt+###s were.
---
In like funorb/arcanist I'd type out stuff like ≫-&gt; whenever I was using elves, and a bunch of dumb stuff like that.
---
There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself.
---
You can literally google the term in less time than it took to make your post. How are you this technologicaly illiterate?

should be changed to hard imo then id stop skipping them every time
---
It would be nice for slayer tasks though
---
More wasted accounts I see
---
No my original comment still stands as it affects pures only
---
Spark up a conversation based on their stats, gear or whatever you think will be interesting. 
---
Some people when they are training or skilling do prefer being left alone however to focus, for me it's when I'm training but when skilling I'm a lot more social.
---
Something people also seem to forget is that there are House Party worlds, POHs are generally very social and have a range of activities to do while there if they have a decent Construction level.
---
Anyone know the approximate GP that all these items would be together ?
---
if youve seen this 8 times that might be a good indicator you spend too much time on reddit
---
Give me your Gucci belt and I’ll give it a nice gold trim

Flashbacks to the 10def dudes with turmoil, storm of armadyl, b gloves etc. They were extremely aids but god damn do they looked fun to play.

Tbh private servers lol

Repost but nice

I think your rs has a virus might wanna let that get checked out..

I know, I didn’t want to say he was wrong flat out. I wanted him to realize he was wrong with my findings lol
---
Yesss bro
---
“On items they set the stats and requirements for when creating” lol
---
maybe i am blind but i didn't see the fighter,healer,runner,ranger hats in there from barbarian assault.
---
What goes through your head before deciding this is a good post?
---
What are the ones to the let of the gilded full helm? They look like trimmed gilded or something but I'm guessing they're from some minigame or quest.
---
Congratulations on your kid! You should get him/her a music box that plays the login music from osrs! ;)
---
I thought I was going crazy when I couldn't find the load balancing setups, they really removed them because they technically weren't allowed?
---
I don’t get the joke You can’t just buy barrow gloves
---
wait. do you need to do nightmare zone for everyone of those helms?
---
Bigger size for bigger loot :)
---
After doing so many of each level there is a reward. 500 easy caskets is a large world able spade. 400 medium is a wieldable casket. 300 hard is the URI emote.

Who would have the resources to DDOS servers every day all day?
---
Slayer is the worst skill in the game.

The clan chat can only have up to 100 people and it's already full. If someone isn't able to join are they just out of luck?

This is awesome. Where can I find that document shown in the beginning of the video?

It's spec just drains the swamp.

Good luck collecting the iron man helms

RS3 boi, eh? Looks like *somebody's* in the wrong part of town...

Also, grats \^\^
---
The final fight is super anticlimactic for that quest, all the sub quests and the fights before the culinaromancer are all harder than the culinaromancer.
---
Ohhh yeah I know what you mean now. You gonna try to get em all at once? That would be really awesome content bro
---
Try w425, there are usually enough people for casual games. Unfortubately it is an Aussie world. You can also try w2 clan wars portal
---
Not op, but I occasionally get over 200 by collecting from the stream that's gonna run out first, and then instead of moving right away, wait to see if one of the other two will replace the first one.  I also often just try to predict where the next one will be.  As there are always 3 blue 3 green and 3 empty spots, your odds of guessing which empty spot is going to turn blue aren't bad at all.
---
&gt; they want me to recite the exact date I created my acc and so on which I simply do not remember
---
Easy. Go to your email that you use to login and filter by "jagex". You should see an email from Jagex when you first joined.

---
1. I have played since around 2005-2006
---
2. My cousin showed me the game and I just had blast playing it. Would log in for the nostalgia every couple years and eventually logged on to find it was now RS3. Didn't touch the game after that until I heard of OSRS, started playing in 2014 again.
---
3. Probably a 9-10. Depends heavily on my RNG how good a mood the game puts me in but it's always a very rewarding feeling when i accomplish what I've been grinding towards
---
4. I don't plan on quitting at all. This has been the longest streak I've gone on without taking any breaks as it's been almost 2-3 years with OSRS being the main game I play.
---
5. If I were to guess, I'd say $100 at most. I only purchase membership with irl money if all my in game money is tied up in members items when my membership runs out.
---
6. Socializing with clan members/friends/streamers is definitely one the most enjoyable aspects of the game but also being able to consistently set goals and attain them is the best part of this game in my opinion.
---
Don't forget the different colored graceful helms! Good way to get the 99 agil for that cape hood as well.
---
Iron dragon?
---
Took me a while to see it LMAO

why is my pic not showing?

Nobody does Karamja elite to get access to noted steel bars. It's a qol unlock that you only get when you are at a point where there is little use for it. As it is, it's basically a useless unlock.
---
And how does that work? Everytime I try to recover it, it just redirects me to the recovery questions/informations without any option to just do it through email.
---
No I think he means the dragon. It took me a while to find.
---
Bottom next to the chat box.
---
so weird you have to click the icon instead of the check box...
---

---
For those who can’t find the Drag it’s on the bottom between the chat box and inventory
---
Efficiency is though... Why bother botting flax picking when you can bot something else for much better money in the same time?
---
Crappy stat barrows is like 600-700k /hr long term, max. Vetion is like 1m an hour in max gear. Just cuz you can sustain a bond spending 2/3rds of your playtime going for it doesnt mean you should
---
You could check to see if go for post 99 xp in skills and get supplies for the ones they have been doing. If they enjoy clue scrolls could buy some implings for clues. If they only really boss/pet hunt could buy bossing supplies
---
I’m a 2001 total nitwit thanks
---
Both CCs are full
---
While that is ,theoretically, a good idea there is just one problem. The email provider I use automatically deletes older emails after like half a year, so yeah.
---
What are your stats? Are you an iron man or regular? Cheers
---
Issues like these are genuinely why I feel nervous investing thousands of hours into this game.
---
Wow that's pretty convenient
---
They already have visage%
---
It's  1 m/hr without uniques and 2 m/hr with uniques

Every time it tells me my account is locked all I have to do is receive an automated email from Jagex then click on a recovery link where I login through the site and Im done.
---
Looks good. Now we just have to wait three years for the web team to figure out how to change it.
---
Don’t worry I had the same issue. Dc twice on w420 while doing rc but my stream stayed up and I even sent my friend screenshots of the dc and he was like yup I’m gettin 20k ping rn. The worlds were being hit off
---
mad props to money snake for all its sacrafices to feed the bot owners' families

Are you going for the level 9 fire cape?
---
You see posts like these every day on this subreddit, people here love eating this same story all up. Come back in 24h to see the truth. It's like watching news these days on tv, you'd think a terrorist is around every corner.
---
Same I've had similar trips where I went to France and played it the next morning on the same device, something else is probably going on here.
---
Bait and switch.
---
Took them long enough to fix the order of the clue scrolls, so this will probably take much longer to get done
---
Level 8 is possible
---
Thank you. I usually get around 180 tears at full QPs.  I try to predict the next stream too, but I go for the last stream to spawn instead of the first; I'll have to give your tactic a shot.

---
If you just need steel bars, Zalcano is probably already a better option than noted bars.  There are more requirements for that, but a bunch of 70 stats shouldn't be too hard to get and are in general great to have anyway.
---
I feel you bro. I started playing again 2 months ago after not playing since 2013 and I am so hooked. I work at home and can have my iPad up all day as well lol
---
When you do get online, you can go to Hans in lumbridge to check when you first joined. Then just do the math based off the info he gives you to get the date. Good luck getting your account back. :)
---
4 man is optimal for rewards, the Venezuelans get annoying though.
---
If you’re after a good task that gives noted steel bars go do gargs tho.
---
Is mobile Hydra ok? Just got my first task ever and gotta go out of town for a couple of days. Wanna get some kills but don't fancy planking tonnes
---
They've been kind to give us polls? We've been kind that we came back after EOC. Polls are there to check devs that don't actually play the game they work on and see what we, the paying customers, will and won't pay for.

People crying on all social media the item was broken if you cant see that I dont know what's wrong with you. This game isnt just pvm slayerscape items that break pvp are just as bad as items that would break pvm. Plus jagex doesnt internal playtest much if at all that's why we had servers, only a minority of players are willing to test hence a smaller group saying it's broken. Imagine all the tears if this would've made it in. Everyone getting owned in the wilderness would be in crying on reddit.

Can you slow down a bit? It’s hard to find the time to watch all these videos
---
Yep with easyscape updates theres almost no difference between maxing a main and maxing an iron coz resources have become such non factors anyway.
---
Maxing two ironman accounts in 2019 takes almost the same amount of time as maxing 1 MAIN account in 2013. That is absolutely insane to think about. This is why maxing isnt just maxing, it can be two completely different animals.
---
🤣 My bad man, I forgot about all the other game devs who let their angry man children community vote on (and for the most part) pick and choose every single thing that goes into their game. Ffs people bitched about the way one insignificant npc looked in the dialogue box and they let us pick and change that out too!

wehhhhhhh

Honestly mate I'm not trying to be right about this, I'm just trying to make a point.

The what? Whats the last word u just said?

Unless they didn't realize it was going to be too strong until people pointed it out to them because they are (fairly, it's a huge game with a ton of interactions) a little out of touch with specialized aspects of the game.
---
Because they're an emo for life.

thank you for spoiling :)
---
Who tracks their kills per hour? Lol

Your point is bad, the item was changed because of outside playtesting by the community not a small percent crying on twitter.

All bosses work like that. I think it's so that you can't scam a split by pretending you got nothing. It sure does have a nice side effect of putting a big old target on your back for wildy bosses.

I only played in mobile while traveling across 3 different continents over 2 weeks and wasn’t banned. Didn’t touch a computer tho. That’s just my anecdotal evidence. I think they can tell which phone you have so if it’s the same phone it shouldn’t matter. The CPU might be a little risky. No one is sure how their not detection/RWT detection system works but as long as you have 2FA you might be alright

Everyone draws the line differently as to what's acceptable and what isn't. Personally, I voted for the item to be added because I see power creep as inevitable in games and I thought it was a cool concept.
---
I'm not particularly annoyed that it was scrapped but I just feel a bit disappointed that they put it to a poll (presumably to see if 75% of the community wanted it) then gave up on it. Either poll things and respect the result or don't. Either way is fine.
---
Conceptually, I don't disagree.  The current American president is a testament to the fact that giving stupid people a vote can have consequences.  I just think it's funny that any given individual seems to think that they're outside of the group of "uninformed voters" that they always complain about.

I don't think "those" mean, what you think "they" mean

to add to this, afk with yourself on an alt so you can get 3 tickets per game, and if you really wanna try hard you can set up a second world. As long as you get in before 15 minutes you get rewards so you can skip 10 minutes per round and get like 13 tickets an hour

Obviously this post touched your feelings enough for your to respond to it, otherwise you would have said nothing. I’m pretty relaxed so you don’t need to worry about anyone but yourself. 
---
This little java game from 2007 has real life implications and people spend real life money on it. It even has a black market. People are greedy, and the lag you and thousands of others are experiencing are most likely because of a few greedy people trying to make real life money off this game. 
---
&gt;Also it's probably bots that are tanking prices not Venes
---
Yeah you can’t bot Zalcano effectively, not that Venezuelans are incapable of creating bots. Besides the fact that the items crashing happen to come from Zalcano, every world is almost always full during peak hours. It is very much a Venezuelan problem and I’m sorry you don’t want to believe it.

Rhetorical or not, it's still a question.

When osrs is as small as it goes, you can't fit two on your screen at once? What is your resolution

Yeah, me too. It's hard though unless they're actively on top of it. When they did that big sweep like a month ago I noticed a lot of regulars disappear in the pk scene, especially zerkers and pures. As of the last week or so they've all been back with capes

Can only tell you as much as I've seen in the 30 other threads in the last 24 hrs: apparently there was a bug that allowed you to teleport from your PoH to someone else's caves.

im confused. what spell is unlocked with lumby hard?
---
You'll probably be fine. I've played from a variety of places without anything happening to my account.
---
Not at comp rn but afaik right click on RL Launcher, click properties, there's a box for dpi scaling. Check that.
---
politely turning someones meme down is savage?
---
Slayer has enough buffs, if you don't need the points from the fast task just skip them. Noting the bars won't affect who does the task at all, it just makes the task slightly better for the subset of people who already do the task but don't have kelite.
---
Incredible event for the community. Deserves more upvotes
---
It may? There are roughly 550 obtainable head-slot items and 816ish bankspaces. So plenty of space!
---
&gt;My main beef with the activity is how unfun it is, 
---
brother have you done ANY of the zeah favor things? theyre like intentionally a chore. library w/ plugin or excel sheet is way better than any of the other zeah activities cuz theres so much that goes into pathing efficiently.
---
if they wanted zeah library to be as you describe they wouldve just strictly randomized the books. but they didnt
---
Yeah all 2% of the playerbase

As a note, I made originally made this without the intention of sharing it, so it's not exactly polished in a presentation format. Some steps are as short as moving 50 feet to do something, whereas others are "Start and continue [Quest] up until XYZ point", or even just "Continue [Quest][" without mentioning when to move on to the next step. The idea there is to just have the Wiki quick guide open to figure out how far to go before moving on to the next step. 
---
I'm also updating it as I go, so a few things might change in the earlier steps, but I'll also be adding on things to the end as my account approaches that point.
---
wrong
---
Better mark this as NSFW...
---
Thbbbbt!
---
Thank you! I had no idea that nearly 500 people would watch it in the first 20 hours, and the positive comments have been very motivating.
---
1366 x 768 and I'm on a laptop at. I've seen in a vid someone running 12 accounts at same time and they have them shrunken down clients somehow
---
Recording and working on the second video right now! :)
---
I literally stated 3 reasons why it's broken.  You just ignored them.  If you want me to get into specific numbers I'm not going to do that it doesn't add anything to the conversation.  There is literally nothing you could do with the stats to keep it added you either nerf it into nothing or leave it as is and as is is broken content.
---
Multiply all money by 0.5; 1 trade
---
Thanks dude! I remember your name, I think you won several times in the Hide and Seek... good job!
---
A sideways WiFi rune
---
That's not what QoL is, noting the Steel Bars is a pretty straight buff.
---
got that double xp tho?
---
Thank you.
---
Truest statement I’ve ever heard
---
All of the original Zeah is like this. Super unfun. Look at the Hosidius and Pisc favor, the Shayzien before gangs...
---
Look at the rewards. Tithe Farm (cancer), Anglerfish (zzzzz), Shamans (why is this not a boss w/ a 1/512 hammer drop???)...
---
Zeah sucks. It was rushed and they tried to fill it up with boring shit.
---
No, if you want the reward from the diary, do the diary instead of suggesting easyscape updates just because you're too lazy to get the stats.
---
Damn, had no idea. Wish I hadn't got mems either. Just bought 3 months :(. Thanks for the info
---
Glad to hear it! In the next episode or two I intend to unlock several more methods, some of which normal accounts haven't used in years, like the canoe system. Once I get enough law runes way later on, some of those methods will probably fall out of use for the sake of saving time.
---
Wtf r u talking about
---
1. Off and on over the past 12 years.
---
2.  Helps me kill time, but it was also the game I played through my childhood.
---
3.  Depends on what I’m doing. If I’m playing on my Ironman I go with a 10, because I’ve been enjoying that a lot lately. If I’m on my main I chase GP so I get burnt out fast.
---
4.  It’s a possibility,  because I’m getting married next summer. I’ve always come back though so who knows.
---
5. 🦀$11🦀 but in reality it’s been probably $100’s just from membership.
---
6.  I enjoy playing with friends, but none of them play anymore so I do PvP and play my Ironman.
---
Shouldn't the content of wilderness be that you can go there to fight other players? And no other "worthwhile" content should be placed there. Change my mind.
---
Weird how ads are also based on browsing habits too? Jeez, fuck jagex

And just to answer this one, rune scimitar seems to be significantly higher in dps

Judging by the other comment, does the BGS and DWH spec not work on Sotetseg?
---
70 prayer, cannonballs, whip, fury, guthans, potions, sharks, planks
---
if you are interested in slayer i would get the range level for a blowpipe and maybe pick up a whip, would also get some supplies pray pots/range/super combat. But really spend it on what you want to do. Im a fan of slayer so i would go down that route but do what you want to do.
---
Would you consider RS Classic the identity of RuneScape? Gotta progress a game at some point ..
---
The checkbox means something else
---
lol
---
Ehh just because something passed a poll doesn't mean it's s good idea. Players actively vote for their own selfish interests, ans it really shows in the last year or so of poll results.
---
The boss had 7 rewards, they said a few times on the qna this was the biggest factor. Thats way too many rewards for a non-raid boss
---
Idk I feel it's a good thing jagex can step back and realize that the polling system is flawed, and take those flaws into consideration. 
---
**Everything pvm passes, that's just a fact.** Pvm updates passing a poll isn't hard, and bad ideas pass all the time becuz of this.
---
 I'm not saying the tome is a bad idea, but the whole concept of "it passed a poll you have to add it" could one day ruin this game...
---
🦀 🦀 Mods are powerful 🦀 🦀
---
Farming xp has overtaken it by now but rc was my first 99.
---
On my main anyway, I made a fresh iron man as I was going for it and got 99 firemaking, thieving and fishing before I managed to finish off 85-99 runecrafting on my main.
---
Memes aside though, it's pretty chill once you get to 77 :p still slow.
---
[Jojo is ok too I guess](https://youtu.be/tk4NU2k1-vY?t=12)
---
It certainly won't hurt to try, and you will see whether it works for you or not. Ironman modes are way slower in all aspects, and require you to do some crazily mundane stuff you''d never do on a main account. The question is whether you can deal with it or not.
---
Lol, that's exactly what I'm saying.
---
What’s up buddy, welcome to the club! I would recommend trying every skill, they’re all unique and fun in their own ways so play how you’d like. Questing and Diaries will help you get a lay of the land! Feel free to add me for any questions or anything: FeralDNA. 
---
I’m not sure about clan chats though. Hopefully someone else has some good ones.
---
Ye, there's 2 options. 
---
1. Auto Group which organizes your tabs by Pots,Runes,quest items,combat items (by type).
---
2. Templates, so that you can take a snapshot of your bank and it will reorganize it back when you want to. If items are missing, it'll set a bankfiller to retain order. 
---
Neat right?
---
Yeah, I agree with this. I flip between the meta and just killing the thing as many times as possible.
---
Like fucking hell, it's hardly an obscure meme is it? Am I that old?
---
yikes, found the liberal
---
Hey bro, I’m legit from swampletics discord, sounds like a cool and unique series, definitely glad I subbed :)
---
How did you make 30m with those stats?
---
Because ever since the early days of RuneScape, "worthwhile" content has been placed in the wilderness because of the "high risk - high reward" balance. Powercreep means worthwhile content from the early days is now dead content, but Jagex has obviously always intended there to be good content in the wilderness, so this argument that there shouldn't be any good content in the wilderness is just stupid. You're saying that something that has always been designed into the game, shouldn't be in the game.
---
Yeah everything I've seen said its 4-5 hours for a new player, which isnt awful. Just wanted to confirm before I go spend the time
---
Hey :D I'm Ferrariic, a mod in swampletics discord actually. What's your discord? I'll @you in \#general @Ferrariic#0001
---
Ayy it's a dds(dragon dagger superpoison)
---
They never changed it. They said they'd have it require normal membership only to begin with and that it'd change to an extra fee requirement, but with the greater amount of players than expected they ended up never implementing it at all.
---
According to the wiki, the item will not be discontinued, and it will also be available to be bought even with points from future leagues. So it won't be super hot.
---
As for the GE price, I can't tell you because I don't know much about those things, but it will certainly cost a bit. 6000 league points requires some decent grinding in the league, but then there are those items that require a lot of effort and don't cost much. If I had to take a guess, I'd say 20mil would be the bare minimum, but I may be completely wrong.
---
450 kc and only a peg :'(
---
I'd just keep doing slayer, then you'll make more gp through it and have the combat levels to make good use of that gp.
---
no its not normal do you work on computers i can show you the bs proof they showed me
---
That's before splitting.
---
Ehh that's mostly gold farmers
---
So it's feeding the vene's families... Literally.
---
rich friends lol
---
F2P pking isn't meant to be profitable. It's a warmup for the real game.
---
I agree that top tier money making methods  should require more skills and effort ...
---
kk thx
---
Can you ellaborate what worthwhile there was in the early days? Runite rocks have for a long time been found from other locations if thats what you are refering to.
---
If you're playing on a lower resolution, you will just have to bear having the clients overlap each other a bit. Try to position them in such a way so it doesn't prevent you from playing. My laptop is also 1366 x 768  I think, and I could have sworn I could fit 2 clients on there at least, maybe with small overlap
---
I think we can all make a reasonable guess of how.
---
PvMers  vote down PvP updates so they don't die in the wild... PvMers also vote in a staff to make magic hit 80's making it easy as fuck to kill them in the wild. Defiatley not a hatred for PvP btw
---
1. 1 year
---
2. i played a bit on my fiances account and then made my own
---
3. 10
---
4. nope
---
5. 1 year of membership, i never buy bonds with irl money or gp
---
6. the delayed gratification from setting long term goals and accomplishing them

I was doing a clue scroll... and being a 10hp hcim a mugger will agro you.
---
I was running past it then my character stopped and would not respond to anything I clicked on. But the npc and damage were still hitting.
---
Thanks
---
And with the money they make from slayer start training con and building up the house to transition into bossing
---
The granite long sword is only effective with a full granite wizard build. Stick to the scimmy.
---
thx for the sentiment lol, didnt do that but i totoally get people who do. if i didnt have rich friends i would, as i have disposable income
---
But you can ask the book lady where to find your book. It doesn't point to it like runelite does, but it will give you an indication of where to look.

Then again, there is nothing wrong with her receiving backlash, because if someone is hired as an artist to something with an already established style, then that new hire is expected to follow that style.

Be mediocre your whole life and make one mediocre act...who was I talking about again?
---
I bet your dick is huge.

in the same boat with my 3 1/2 month old :p congrats !
---
This is nothing new, they are just wearing an outfit now.
---
&gt;Because jagex goes against poll results about 5% of the time, and only in specific very obvious circumstances, polls are completely useless
---
So basically if I’m investing 1m into an item or items as long as I’m making that 1% that’s a good tell that I’m on the right track?
---
I’ve used GE tracker in the past but the prices on the items I use seem to change the next minute. I usually used the suggested items, do you recommend I stay away from those? I watch FlippingOldSchool which is what helped me learn how to flip it’s just finding higher cost items that have a decent return seems to be where I get stuck but I’ll check for the items you suggested.
---
This is peak redditor behaviour.
---
We'll all gather round and reminisce of the good old days when we didn't knew what we were doing and everything was an adventure. And we'll complain we cna never go back because we know how inefficient that is now.
---
Than we'll turn around and yell at someone having fun for not being efficient.
---
Steel heraldic helm is in the middle and on the left is probably the rune heraldic helm but it could also be adamant since they are identical.
---
op is just racist lol
---
monkaHmm
---
Couple suggestions, considering one of your comments said you're getting combo'd out:
---
1: be super paranoid about your recoil running out. Most of the time I die at zulrah, snakelings killed me when my recoil shattered and I didn't notice. That might be happening to you, it might not. 
---
2: get ahrim's. It has way more defense than mystic, so you won't be stuck eating as often. 
---
3: Make sure your prayers and switches are on point, prayers especially. Mistakes can cost a lot of health = eating = low dps.
---
its like having 4.6 anguishes equiped

It isn’t a *weird* question. It’s just a question.

What does that even mean here? Ironically you’re almost implying only liberals have etiquette.

It’s actually HO HO HO

I was wondering about that, do you know how long the limit lasts for?

Then there was the guy with both kinds and dupe red muta at 41 kc.

I'll pm it to you

It's amazing for semi afking  skills
---
Agree steel dragons aren't exciting atm
---
but that said I really hate idea of noted drops in general, and hope it's used as little as possible
---
Looking back on fightcaves that was a really fun grind. It was challenging and I spent all day on it. I was stoked as fuck when I killed jad.
---
I try this but they send me to account recovery and say they’ll email my old email

Konar has a higher point reward than duradel

My first bossing pet! 444kc. Was complaining to my brother about my lack of drops 2 kills before this. Holy shit
---
Isn't there a farmer north of lumby doing this all day in a grain field
---
Seems a bit rough. Depending on how you define major city things like questing or slayer would become massive grinds. It appears like the only slayer master you go to do without having to grind money would be Konar. NPC contact would obviously make this easier, but then you'd be locked onto Lunar's the entire game. And then you really have to define what make 500k means. Could you stock tons of items in your bank and just sell them all to a general store to make money? Do you have to grind resources within the area to generate money? If so then you would need to dictate how far away from the city are you allowed to go. Do you have to go from city to city or can you travel in the neutral zones, because if so it seems like it would be better to just never go to cities unless you needed to for questing.
---
Personally I'm not a big fan because there's a lot of rules needed to make it function, but if you're having fun then more power to you.
---
I appreciate the generosity but I am not one to shy away from a grind. Thanks for the offer tho kind stranger. May your christmas be merry!
---
Because this is called Social media by two people does not mean this is Facebook or instagram. 
---
Reddit’s own rules, specifically reddiquette, state that’s not what it’s for. Go argue with mods if you wanna use the downvote button as a dislike button. 
---
I don’t care about internet points or how many I have, I just don’t like stupid people who use internet points as a way of disagreeing with someone. You could make your argument and simply not downvote someone, but you have to take the extra step of downvoting them too, and to me that’s pretty stupid. 
---
Gold farmers have a marked effect on the economy. Regular players don’t tank items as fast as gold farmers do, it’s very simple. They also don’t tank items as far as gold farmers do. Tool seeds leave the game when they are used. They cannot be re used once they are used. Your point makes no sense.
---
Definitely something cool from clue scrolls. Most of it is cheap and makes some top tier fashionscape.
---
What elven things?
---
Nice. Good luck my dude.
---
his point is that jagex doesn't have to respect polls if they don't want to.
---
so if they wanted to go "full rs3" they could do so no matter what u vote for.
---
Yeah that's what I tried. I've tweeted at Jagex support now. I've gotten a response so hopefully they help.
---
are you gonna watch the whole thing? i watch these on the toilet

Wait they share a streak counter?

think the item value is 0, priority is under pretty much every other item except diary reward armours and probably a few others
---
thanks!
---
you're right actually, didn't really know what to have at the ends of the hammer just to have it flat or include something and later tried to keep that pointy thing from the mace.  
---
EDIT: words
---
Alot of people stopped playing because they hit the points for the reward(s) they want. Go look at how many players stopped at exactly 6k points.
---
Happens to me when WiFi lagging
---
Nah. It sucks the fun right out and you'll just lose interest and stop playing. Grinding PVM to build up your gear all the way to BiS is way more fulfilling.
---
The "data" for combat balancing is already out there.  Players are too lazy and stupid to figure out what it means.  You can do dps calcs for the new shit and figure out some of it was retard powercreep that the game didnt need.
---
Jmods only removed the tome because they were butt hurt about the twitter roasts.
---
&gt;Well i know what im doing
---
Based on the fact that you can’t kill zulrah I feel like that’s not entirely true lmao
---
Choose which one sounds more fun 4head
---
Hundreds of hours grind until endgame content like bossing, or fun with friends without 15 hrs making potions and being anal about farm patches.
---
Running back and forth through Aid of the Myreque really sucks IMO.
---
You're fun.
---
I completely agree with this. Back in the day I was way too scared to go into the wilderness, so I don’t remember if f2p had worthwhile content in the wildy. I feel like the teleblock being added to f2p is underused, because there is nobody there except people doing arranges fights
---
OK maybe there is one quest that I kind of hate.
---
Damn I was trying get the whole lederhosen set but I don't want to steal your style.
---
nah dude! my best tip for you is learn solo saradomin god wars. it's a very basic fight but teaches you how to manage movement and combat, as well as being a great intro boss for figuring out saradomin brews and super restores. the gear required is cheap, just some blessed dragonhide and some veracs. you can do it with a rune crossbow and enchanted bolts. drops are rare but very lucrative, the more people you go with, the less resources you'll use, the more kills you can get per trip. I killed her 500 times and got an armadyl crossbow, a saradomin hilt, and several blade shards.
---
Yeah absolutely. I can afford dying lots of times. I thought it was an instanced fight and any death meant it was all gone. Not worried at all now. Thanks!
---
Power creep isnt inevitable and has been stopped at times.  In 2016 we also had baby soul split added to zenyte jewelry and it failed a poll by just 5%.  It took another 2 years before sang staff gave us a mage-only consistent heal method that couldnt be used in pvp.  We've done well at preventing some forms of powercreep but players generally enjoy seeing max hits go up for whatever reason.
---
Is being bad at Jad the same as being bad at PVM?  At least with other bosses, you go right into the fight.  I think I'm bad at Jad only because of the thought of doing the first waves over again bothers me.

If she got the reference I assume her reply would've also referenced the meme, but ok.
---
Yeah I feel that. You might want to ask again next time this post is pinned so you can get more answers from more educated people than myself haha.
---
Couple of hours and im gonna make 5m lol?
---
Great idea. The only reason it's not implemented is that Jagex wants money
---
Fuckin baited me
---
In the same trade?
---
In many ways
---
I was going to say the same thing
---
It is an0 extremely difficult boss and the majority of people you see killing it at 75/75 already have hundreds or thousands of kc on other accounts. There are lots of great tips and guides but ultimately it demands a lot of repetition, engagement, and counting. Efficiency-wise it might not be worth it at your stats, even if you become successful. Definitely a great feeling to kill it though so best of luck whatever you choose!
---
The fight caves are very entry level for bossing considering 90% of it can be safe spotted and 100% can be prayer flicked. 
---
If your struggling with that then yes gear isn’t going to help you. 
---
This is a game where practice makes perfect.
---
That’s not how the saying goes.. it’s “you build one hundred bridges and fuck one sheep, they’ll call you a sheep fucker”

If someone built 100 bridges u bet ur ass they’d be called a bridge builder lmao

Where exactly did I make this claim?

&gt; They said "It's all (i.e all criticism) is unacceptable"
---
No they did not. They said, in direct quotes, 
---
&gt; She has received some really nasty personal backlash which is not acceptable.
---
You literally asked how this was legal. You’re dumb.
---
compare it to wow doing stuff like waterfall quest and witches house as a noob felt a lot more interactive. and the fact that a lot of quests have crucial items/features locked behind them makes it feel like they are worth doing instead of just a flat xp/gp reward or a gear reward that you will throw away in a few levels.
---
Really makes you realize how unfunny/unoriginal most people are.
---
Depends, how long ago was torvestas last wilderness video?
---
I am Hispanic. I speak Spanish. I have noticed that every time I am in Zalcanohost and doing Zalcano I play with Spanish people. I ask them where they’re from, they say Venezuela. Some of them don’t even need to tell me, they have it in their names or speak in a way only Venezuelans do. 
---
I am speaking about Venezuelans. It is undeniable they are a large source of black market gold. It’s not racist. I don’t view them as lower than me. I’ve never said they were.
---
Nothing I’ve said was racist. You’re just assuming I’m some white guy complaining about Spanish people.
---
That picture doesn't have my current collection: https://imgur.com/a/FJYs2sR
---
Ah. My apologies , good luck then.
---
Can somebody help me on the math revolving around the statistics of this occurring, I'm getting around 3.5% given the number of trials but that seems like a very high estimate.
---
Edit: actually seems to be right. To expect the drops you have received  in 436kc with 90% confidence  you would need 27800 kills.
---
I want a quest to adopt the good doggy
---
Anything with baby yoda is gold.
---
It's understandable though. People don't want to have to grind for the White Knight store unlocks.
---
I feel like your rules will make this very hard to have fun with. I get that fun isn’t exactly the point but you need it to be something that you can see through to the end. Anytime you try to do something, you’re ultimately going to end up just trying to make money over anything else which will just slow you down immensely, Imagine doing a quest and having to hop from city to city, it will make the quest take significantly longer. I think you have a good starting point for how you broke up the map, but maybe a different sort of challenge would be better. Maybe something where you have a decent mid-level account and you do everything you can in those areas to make as much money as possible and give yourself a time restriction in each area. You can set specific goals for an area as well. For example, not leaving a certain area until you’ve cleared that areas agility courses. But again, things like that will just take away from a main goal, if that itself is not the goal.
---
Thanks i really hope this goes through if not my family and I will not have a good venezualen Christmas.
---
Yeah, most people just vote yes to more money, more slayer or anything that makes their life easier. The old way death penalty needs to make a return, the game is only hard/fun when playing hcim now
---
Thank you :D
---
Whether it is legal or not has nothing to do with Reddit itself. All I said is that maybe moderators have any control over it. 
---
Besides that, I'm sure that the owner of the gold-selling website is infringing on Jagex' intellectual property _in some way_, making it actually illegal.
