Cool! Watched the rangers game today, Kreider out there not wasting xp today.

Little dude wants a few pieces of candy

How about a yak pak. A yak that follows you and has an extra inventory, the downside you cannot run.
---
i think the likelihood of getting a barrows piece is about 1/17. if you want to make money keep doing what you're doing but some good goals at this level of the game are getting a fighter torso (which you can do for free), getting a helm of neitiznot by completing the fremenik isles quest, and getting barrows gloves (or rune gloves at least) by doing recipe for disaster.

At level 22 he could have 5,624 xp - 6,291 xp. Silk stalls give 24 xp/theive so ~250 theives to this level. Rate of pet is 1/68,926 so chance of not getting pet in 250 is (68,925/68,926)^250 or 0.9999854917. Subtract 1 gives the chance of getting at least one rocky in 250 silk stall steals (~level 22) which is 0.0000145083 or 0.00145%.

Tried to buy a girlfriend in the town square. Ended up in jail for a few nights. 0/10 would not recommend.

yeah use burp suite to intercept the udp packets and get ida pro to decompile the html to pass it into adptool which will list you all the ads on the site
---
Yes it is. Of you want to kill the game for a quick few bucks. The sooner the gamemode dies the better off the future of rs will be.
---
Step 1: stop botting
---
Step 2: dont use your accounts on the same IP
---
Step 3: stop botting 
---
Step 4: play the game legit
---
Yep lay in bed playing my brand new GameBoy SP till they both go to bed. Then slowly creep downstairs to turn on my dad’s laptop and game all night.
---
I even remember downloading battlefield 2 on my mom’s computer so I could play that at night... till the day my dad caught me. Him Being a Master Sergeant at the time, to say the least my dad was furious and retired my RuneScape career.
---
It really is luck. I got the RC pet while getting fremenik exiles prereqs too. 
---
That being said, fuck the sand casino.
---
&gt;cause I KNOW it *isnt* fake
---
There's no way to get one in Twisted League.

can u ELI5 this joke? what’s with kempq?

Oh yeah def just rng lol. And out of thousands ofc some are gonna get luckier than others haha.

Get a job and buy gold lmao, who tf grinds for gp these days as an adult, are you 12?
---
I only play it on Double Weenie Wednesdays, I swear.
---
your braindead kek
---
Then lvl 2 would be tempting. And super risky. There are some level 2 accounts (with hp under 10) from legacy bug exploits, they go for good cash. This is unless something was done to patch them but I'm not aware of it.
---
Yeah servers are fucked rn
---
Roll tide
---
Go until you get a dope helm and then try to get barrows gloves!
---
Just double spec -&gt; kill -&gt; pool -&gt; tele back with boots -&gt; repeat
---
People have multiple accounts and or can flip/merch. Even if they bought bonds it supports the game so who cares?

pretty obvious when you realise AdBlock doesn't work on this one ad, and it's a unique ad that you've never seen before.

With how easy it is to farm reddit karma it’s actually impressive they were able to do that to themself

Its fine that you're wrong, everyone makes mistakes

but dont be rude about it

Swampman good

There is then a link in the video description that will download a keylogger or virus on your computer.

Haha what?
---
The falling rocks during dragon slayer 2 cutscene had it too, made me laugh.
---
Why did you do MM2 on a Rune Dragon alt? Not done a ton of research in to it so not sure if there's a reason.
---
Vorkath rolls two drops, if you just get one drop of the table it means one of the rolls was an empty roll on rdt, if you get nothing like here you rolled twice on the empty table.
---
No she found a new man who has 99 attack
---
Zulrah farms got banned, real players stepped in since scales rose and farmed the fuck out of zulrah, scale prices crash due to more scales being brought into the game than leaving the game
---
Will do. Thanks for the help

post karma is worth at least 100 times more than comment karma tho

It wasnt funny and really bizarre so yeah you probably will lol

Holy shit i can relate.
---
Last night I muted 4 of the “pum814” bots all within about 2 minutes. Jamflex make the ignore list infinite
---
It unlocks dragon javelin head drops, over time you make more money so its worthwhile.
---
Yeah I have one so I don’t need to do any switches on Zulrah and the supply cost is tiny (it’s basically only like 30-40 gp per shot with amethyst arrows). The pattern does change each kill but I have enough kc to know where to move without paying much attention beyond the first few colors of each phase. It’s literally just move, change to mage prayer when he’s blue, and switch between ring of suffering and archer ring if there’s snakelings or not. 
---
I understand Vorkath’s attacks too but it feels like I have to pay more attention to not risk getting KO’ed, and god forbid I lag a little when he does a special attack. Then I’m definitely dead and gotta cough up the 100k (I think collecting at Zulrah should have that 100k fee too though).
---
Keurig.

I thought it was hilarious but I understand it’s a lot of plebs here so no worries :)

If you use `a::Click`, you'll be able to hold down the a key and click will spam (which is bannable). If you use `a::LButton`, it's identical to just pressing the left click on your mouse, and holding it down will do nothing except click once.
---
Why did you chocolate the frogs legs? I don’t think there’s anything that implies they’re coated with chocolate. They’re probably just fried lmao. Especially given the description.

You are allowed to use AHK to rebind keys, look at the blogpost.

What’s the difference between a::click and native keyboard functionality that spams characters when you click buttons?

Gratz. Cool account

why cant you just use the phone app for that though?
---
Lol. Tribrid. Look at this linguist.
---
True. Not the first time this subreddit has had egg on it's face. Remember all the "rendi on suicide  watch" comments hours before the lvl 9 dropped?
---
I think he’s saying grinding for gold isn’t worth your time if you make a decent wage at your irl job. Buying a bond and selling for gp is way more efficient. Buying from gold sellers is even more efficient lol
---
At 100 hour attempts I think 2 weeks.
---
Kind of same except when i was doing it there seemed to be a minimum 20 other people doing that same quest at any given time so i would just beg other people to show me how to do it until someone gave in and showed me lol
---
I actually enjoy grinding alts I have 5 atm, doing quests over and over sucks but its very rewarding having your own little army.
---
10/10
---
A shitty one
---
Had no idea lol
---
Did they abduct you though?
---
Thank you!

If you're talking about 9hp then they're still combat 3.

Took me long enough but I finally finished!

This is considerably more effort than just normal maxing.

It's always great to see a fellow classic vet. Those were the golden days..

I would cannon range to 75 and then just flex in red armor all day at the GE
---
Neither did I... I just popped in to see a fucking cannon
---
Hey /u/ssj7blade can you help this homeboy out?
---
Cannon for range, pest control for melee. Also methods like pump in blast furnace, etc.
---
Thanks! I did a combo of pest control and organized crime for my melees.
---
&gt; Except rs3 isnt really pretty 
---
Uhhhh [if you say so](https://imgur.com/a/tiEvfDN)
---
Is this the end of evolution or just the beginning?!
---
Obly stat you have at 99 is jealousy
---
Uhhh
---
Ok this is getting ridiculous someone just get the lvl 3 fire cape so we can be done with it lolol.
---
BRO, don't you remember that twitter drama thing that happened months ago that no one besides this subreddit gives a fuck about? Also did you hear the rumor that he RWTs (and by RWT I mean: used to sell fire capes)? Just horrible. I'm going to make a comment about it in every fire cape thread to spread awareness!
---
Did they? 😶
---
Mad at a seller when there’s a market for it is the dumbest thing I’ve heard. From personal experience a VPN with multiple mules and a decent bot army farming good, there’s about a 99% chance the mans only gunna be taking a momentary hit.
---
Your checkmated. I’ve used scythe before way waaaay back on RS3. Not only that but once some of those bots reach higher XP, they sell them off for profit too. I remember when they made a runecrafting mini game where you could bot to 99 within the 2 week free trial. Some guy was selling several 100 a month for like $10 a pop. Faster than dubs on the corner by the night club. Then buy bulk good for like 80% market price and sell that 2bill at market price. It’s like $250/billion. 
---
Like GF bro.
---
Because he has the best chance of hitting it......
---
Ill show my self out
---
That's ugly lol
---
This makes me so mad. During my noob days, I fell for this dumb shit. Dont even wanna think about it. This was like 1-2 yrs ago
---
Bad bait try harder next time
---
Yes
---
range tank. the idea is to have a very high defense bonus, while not lowering youre ranged too much and still being able to do quite a bit of ranged damage to carry the fight (assuming ranged is not your KO method in this gear) while still being able to get very high KO potential from Melee spec. its very good for high level tribrid(nhing)
---
kurasks, cave horrors, dragons. at higher levels wyverns become available.
---
Runelite says the same combat level as what he was in-game, aswell as the barrows gloves which someone else pointed out!
---
Yeah that's very odd, just noticed too.
---
no one is even capable of doing sub 75 range inferno capes except xzact
---
It’s extremely profitable at higher levels
---
Except those were in the past and this is now? No I didnt.
---
Yeah, I'm incredibly  confused by this, it really doesn't make sense. He teled out when I attempted to question it.
---
Not as much as you show people with your name
---
Looks like I won the debate gf
---
lol this is a thinly veiled advertisement for gold selling. I'm betting this guy will get a huge influx of buyers PMing him about rates.
---
Cooking was my second! Gratz man.
---
He’s said he’s not gonna try and beat the new record of 14 or whatever too and he’s said he wouldn’t try and beat his own 16
---
You can just click anywhere outside of it, or, if it traps you against the wall run to the exit tile, then back one space when the fire goes down
---
Ah that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. Another question, what’s tribid?
---
Imagine linking that toxic sub
---
What potion makes money?
---
Loved the video! Short and funny.
---
Not to detract OR insult but in this case I'd split not FFA loot I know it sucks but still the couple hundred mil is LONG time sub cash
---
Look up a guide on completing Recipe For Disaster which unlocks barrows gloves. It will list all the skills and quests you need to do. 
---
I would say your combat stats are fine for now. Focusing on questing will make you train certain skills as requirements for the quests.
---
If you really don't want to quest then just get 70 attack and def so that your 85 combat and then start slayer with Nieve.
---
Slayer will make you money eventually.
---
Ring of the gods i also gives the effect of a holy wrench, so a few extra pray points goes a long way there sometimes.
---
I do like 29 min caves with max range and t bow without chins or anything fun.  Just saves on pots and is nice for afk/trip extension for other places.
---
Only if it's like the rank 1 spot. The absolute winner
---
He found a way to break out of last man standing?  Possibly
---
If you're asking for help getting it to run better you're probably out of luck. OSRS runs on a single CPU core and you're not getting very far on a single ARM core in a Pi 3.
---
I would sell it but make sure you use a different IP than your main.
---
But their kick max hit is double his hp
---
yeah I've done about 150 chests and I've definitely made good money off of it, but a lot of that was just getting lucky with Karil's tops and Ahrim's robes
---
Hopefully you will get enough gp in members from the bond that person gave you to keep it going but incase you don’t a good f2p money maker is buying items on the ge and selling them to shops like armour stores and jewellery stores. Just make sure you check the prices to make sure you will make profits but you should make 300ish gp per item.
---
Another option is he botted and was rolled back the levels.
---
More. More videos. Get off reddit and go back to work
---
This is the base gear from LMS mini game. Maybe found a way out of the mini game?
---
That’s true, I never thought of it like that. Well thank you
---
Lol fair enough
---
Why the A, i never understood
---
Even stranger! I honestly haven’t got a clue
---
Runelite hiscores have been fucked for me for days now, not updating.
---
Complete some quest in p2p such as grandtree, tree gnome village, monkey madness and waterfall quest. These are just an example, but there is plenty of other quests that gives you a lot of xp. When you get your stats higher up from these xp, it makes it easier for you to make money. I would recommend start training slayer even if the money isn't great at the early levels. The time you put in slayer for the early levels is an investment for your future gold making. When you get 75+ slayer, you will be making a lot of gp.
---
Beside doing slayer, i would also recommend training farming. With farming you can easily make money even if you're low level. Planting herbs such as ranarr gives you some profit back. You can do herb runs every 50 min (this is the time it takes for your herbs to grow fully. I've looked you up and seen your stats, and currently you have 1 farming. You can actually quest up to 32 farming or 35 without even touching farming, you can look up farming guide on youtube. 
---
The skill hunter is also a very good way for you to make money, when you use your bond. Catching red chinchompas (level 63 hunter) gives a good amount of profit. If you make it to level 73 hunter, you can start catching black chinhompas, which is better money than red chins. The thing with black chinchompas is that they're placed in level 33 wilderness, so you may be attacked from other players since wilderness is pvp. (Player versus player) 
---
Overall member's world opens up a lot of opportunities for you to make money, and explore the rest of the game. I wish you good luck on your runescape adventure, and i hope you're ready, because its going to be one hell of a ride, when you redeem that bond.
---
Maybe that works now, but in the past that would never log you out. Your character would remain in game even though the client was closed.
---
HYAHYAHYA HAHA WOW
---
I honestly feel really bad. Sire sucks. I would have given up by now if i was you. Once i have bludgeon i am never going back
---
Very nice
---
Can you crystal saw boost, POH tea boost and spicy stew boost all at once for construction?
---
maybe get a proper job and play in your free time?
---
Pudding.
---
Yeah my 5 noted sardines says it all...
---
No, spicy stew doesn't stack with tea but both stack with Crystal saw.
---
I feel accomplished for sure! and thank you!
---
tyty!
---
What is tea boost +3 right?
---
If you dont use standard fire attack spells you basically have infinite fire runes for teleport/high alch with just 1 page
---
oh yeah definitely there's zero reason to do sire once you have bludgeon, abyssal head dagger and orphan are just bonuses. if my sire grind keeps going like this i might have to force myself to get a dwh
---
Congrats man. Makes me want to continue thieving on my hardcore.

---
I think you will neck rope if you are an iron man and need to do a shaman grind to then go back to sire grind. Even if you get bludgeon piece on your next kc you could be at 1k kc or more by the time you finish bludgeon. Dont do this to yourself :(
---
My god. I can’t imagine doing that many kree’arra. Mostly solo?

Nice

Blocked as in jagex has blocked the name.

wow tbow takes longer than bpipe.. surprising. Do you use bp on waves and just tbow the mage/jad?
---
Playing the game at all is a waste of time by that line of thinking, so at least he’s wasting his time doing something that requires skill and ingenuity. Spend 100 hours doing slayer and that’s fine, spend 100 hours doing something noteworthy and you people shit on him. Lol.

Says a lot about how insecure you are that you'd just assume these low level capes are to "flex on other people".  Some people enjoy a good challenge with an impressive reward, it's no different than going for an infernal cape on a maxed main, just a bit more unique.   
---
Just because you're not personally interested in doing it yourself doesn't mean it's a waste of time.  Stop bringing other people down because you can't be happy for an achievement that you'll never get.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't RS font monospace, meaning that every character has equal spacing?
---
Hopefully this is true. Imagine if someone finds a way to smuggle VLS out of LMS.
---
If you honestly believe that then more power to you. I think you will be hard pressed to find someone in the game who enjoyed every single aspect of this game and wasn’t bored at any point in time .
---
Risk it.

And people say pvming requires more skill 😂

You’re wrong

Are birdhouse runs for gp even worth it post nerf? I know they're good xp but do they offer enough gp to do it outside of just herb run integration

Well let's read the blog FAQ again that's being referenced. 
---
&gt;Q: If I don't compete in this league will I still be able to get the Twisted League rewards in the next league?
---
&gt;A: You will be able to obtain league rewards from previous leagues using the points you earned. **Some of the rewards are also being polled as tradeable** so if you don't want to wait until the next league you can always try your luck at buying one. We will not make discontinued rewards with leagues.
---
They say **some of the rewards** will be tradeable, which implies that **some of the rewards** will not be tradeable, right? The only untradeable rewards are the trophies, so are they not stating here that trophies are also considered "rewards"? Wouldn't that include them in the ending statement "We will not make discontinued rewards with leagues."? This is on top of them saying all over the place that they won't be introducing discontinued items period.
---
If you're saying the blogs don't matter, then idk how you can also say the info in the poll question matters if it's based on and references the blog. But if the potentially ambiguous questions are all that matters and nobody reads the blogs/watches Q&amp;As, then can we at least not be so adamant that the people who did follow the blogs are wrong?
---
The answer to your question about how they would be available in the next league is that they didn't even know for sure if the trophies would be the same across leagues. If they were the same, then they wouldn't be discontinued. But they changed their mind for some reason. They admitted in a [Q&amp;A](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e6o1ci/old_school_developer_qa_transcript_05122019/) two weeks ago that, "... **we had not considered whether or not they'd become effectively discontinued and whether they'd be different between leagues**. We fail to agree on what the best approach may be...".
---
You forgot to max you HP, silly goose.

Or use HWIDGEN and get rid of it for free

been nice so far :)

sorry bro it isnt that hard to get one ya just gotta stick with it

at 90+ you'll get avg 8 nests iirc, which is 40k not including any seeds you might get. From one minute of work, that's 2.4m/hr effectively.

Its not better, its worse, because if u mess up and let the equipped recoil break, you cant get another one and your noted stack is useless.
---
&gt; so I wouldn't call it obvious from the beginning if they didn't even know 
---
When the league ends, how did you think people would get a Twisted League trophy without participating in the Twisted League?

The trophies were inherently going to be discontinued because you won't be able to get a Twisted League trophy once the Twisted League is done. Any further League will have it's own version of the different trophies. They didn't say "Twisted League trophies will/won't be discontinued" because it's pretty obvious that they would be. If an NFL team wins the Super Bowl, are they going to get last year's rings? No, they're getting that current year's.
---
&gt; They even mentioned making the trophies available elsewhere should the Leagues mode as a whole be scrapped. 
---
Well luckily for everyone, the Twisted League seems pretty popular, so there will most likely be more opportunities in the future, so maybe they will add a generic trophy in two or three years if/when Leagues end. But right now, there's no need for the misplaced outrage people have about this.

Opening the map used to take a minute to load. And then a minute to load the game once I exited out of the map. And then for some reason I was always slightly zoomed into my browser so I could only see 3/4 of the screen at any time. If I wanted to see the chat or the radar I would have to scroll and wait a minute for the black nothingness to show the game.

Well never mind, that’s definitely not the main bulk of people who buy it lol. Just looked and daily volume was 117k. That’s a lot lol. Maybe they just sell for less than it says
---
Its much harder, but depends largely on the individual. If you use the same password for your email as you do for your Runescape account, that is gonna be a big problem. A lot of people fill out their recovery questions with super generic answers which becomes an even bigger problem. 2FA definitely makes the job much harder though, and most people who just steal accounts to use as bots don't want to bother with cracking it and just move onto something more difficult.

Flex value is limited beyond the combat level. Only way I see that happening is if some scoreboard actually forms with total combat xp at the moment of obtaining the cape.

The way I see it in this game is there are some bosses you have extremely good rng and the others are terrible rng... I’m at 1800 kills and have 3 claws but like 21 leathers.. and then there is barrows where I get an item every 80-100 chests... I’d say find the boss that give your good rng and farm it

honestly just keep playing on ur ironman, i feel like its better to use resources on an iron than to practice on a main. for example, doing jad on my maxed main with blowpipe was a breeze, but doing it on my iron without brews/restores and a rune crossbow was a completely different experience. same with zulrah, i can do zulrah easily cause i have maxed gear. but on my iron with decent [stats](https://i.imgur.com/2pQYiJ3.png) and gear, i still fail half the time. as long as u do consistent farm runs, you shouldnt ever run out of supplies tbh.
---
Increase heap size. It should be using way more RAM than that.

void + salve ei bc slayer helm dont stack with salve

i dont think so. or at least itd be hard. you could if you could ensure both range and mager were on tick (example: https://streamable.com/ugovj ) and just recoil the whole cave but idk if thats viable.
---
That’s like 160m?
---
There were far more in the stream than watching that particular clip. Also, they posted the same thing in the Twisted Leagues FAQ pos on the website. So if you did keep up with Twisted Leagues, you would have known they did not plan on adding discontinued items. If you only read the Dev Blog or worse, only read the poll, you might not. But that doesn't mean that the poll intended for discontinued items.
---
Key costs 3$ on ebay, worth it
---
DA tax wasn't polled and 100% there needs to be a GE tax.
---
In case you didn't know, you can give Scraps a bone by using it on him :)
---
Because you kill at max like 30/hr roughly. You have to use rune darts or dragon to consistently skip healing orbs, the uniques are 4M, and 1M each, the common loot is like 40K. I’m grinding the pet using scythe/ddarts and max melee/range and claws and average kill time is 1:40-1:50 and using 800M+ in gear. Now take zulrah for example that shits out GP, you get faster kills and it’s like 4x the profit, you’re going to get a lot of people complaining. (I’m not complaining because I know what I signed up for before starting so it is what it is) That being said I wish the transition phases like when they fly back to their spots, or when the pools on the ground despawned allowed you to instantly attack vs waiting 3 seconds that would be great. Would probably add 1-2 kills/hr but also make it less annoying. I too enjoy the mechanics but in plain they’re just shit GP/hr and not really worth it for profit.
---
dont tank the healers lmao, they heal jad if they manage to attack you. if you wanna tank them at least lure them so only one attacks you at a time
---
Big if true.
---
But that is not how they were polled. The OSRS Team said multiple times across Dev Blogs and Livestreams that they would not introduce discontinued items with Leagues and they even specified that applied to the trophies too. The Trophies were polled with that being true.
---
It is fine to offer discontinued trophies, but it needs to be polled clearly as such. And I know this is changing arguments a bit from arguing the concerns over discontinued items to why discontinued trophies should have been polled, but that is because it is fine to prefer discontinued trophies. It is just that some players would rather not have discontinued items in OSRS and that has been part of the appeal, so changing that without giving the players a proper say in a poll as they've done in the past can feel like a betrayal of that.
---
shit account neph
---
It should. Skilling content is very abusable by bot and gold farms and so is a lot of PvM and PvP and really anything in the game. But my point is say killing Zuk was 20m gp/hr long term for people that can clear inferno in 60mins. You wouldn't see this content being farmed by venez or gold farmers, because in all likelihood, neither industries could reliably do this content. The same can't be said for skilling.

GWD drop tables are lindy, survived decades. 10% gp 10% resources 80% of profits uniques
---
How? that 20% of not uniques is barely 400k/h (not worth doing for just that).
---
So if uniques drive the action, their price wont drop below a minimun in game wage where there are no people bothering to farm. Supply is elastic and matches demand. Thats why all gwd bosses are around 2m/h per account.

What time is it? Time to hop kiddo

I'm looking for a community (clan?) where I can hang out on irc or discord and talk about the game. Something similar to SwiftIRC from 2006. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Think he meant "use points on XP"

Wowcha baby, rule 1 of being a grinder is say no to the birds. It's amateur hour out here.

You can know exact spawns for entire cave after first 2-3 waves.

Don't really need to rely on them if you know what the spawns are.

As i said, it does not make sense to be as grindy as it is.

Ranging IRL is a lot harder than ranging is OSRS but it's really fun! But the leveling is the same. You hit a TON of 0's at first and then you eventually start seeing 1's and you start progressing.

I've never done a rune dragon alt but I have a hard time believing this takes anywhere near that long if done remotely efficiently.

ok who cares

You can put one load in the hopper while the wheels are broken. Most people only repair when they have already done so and have no chpice but to repair. That way you lose less xp/hr

If it was adsense it would be totally forgivable because google doesn't filter that shit at all, you have to manually file complaints for every problem advert. That's not the case here though, they intentionally chose to host RWT ads.

Assuming this is real, it's probably a graphical glitch or something minor. Ever since the old days of item smuggling from minigames, Jagex use different ID's for items within minigames, meaning if they were smuggled somehow they can't be traded or sold.

Before ring of suffering an 8 cb cape was probably impossible, you have no idea if there are any undiscovered mechanics or future updates that could change things again

Power Mining or Woodcutting are great, as you can just tap the tree/rock and then item in inventory to drop. Same goes for Fishing although new fishing spots can be sorta tedious.

Hunter's ok with nets and ropes, if you limit yourself to three Yung tree's, it works close enough to Power Mining or Woodcutting.

You do realize leagues aren't just 'area locked ironman gamemode', right? They could do literally anything, like making an OSRS randomizer similar to the pokemon/zelda ones, or entirely change the way gaining xp or levelling skills work etc, not just 'Oh you're now stuck in X area, next year it will be Y area' - That would get boring **really** fast
---
If I were you I’d use melee while cannoning, that way you’re training both skills
---
I make it through the waves easy, I get really spazzy at Jad and get hit by him. Just gotta find a way to ease the anxiety I guess.
---
I asked a friend of mine how this could be explained to people who havent tried double speccing, this is his answer :
---
“So if your doing camp method like he said then you'd be getting 1:40ish kills which means you would have ONE spec 3/4 kills. Whereas your method you'd be speccing 2 times per kills- since average bgs is about 40, that decreases vorkaths def on average about ~50 more (130% more) than camp method which would result in an average decrease in kill time of about 20ish secs. That would mean if it takes you 40 secs to tell poh and get back your looking at 20 secs per kill.... So 60/33= 1:49secs per kill and adding 15 per puts you at 2:09 per kill so 60/2.15= 27.9 kills p/h”
---
Toxic how exactly? Because they make fun of people like you?
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
The comment was edited
---
I didn't realise the difference before friend told me at like 300kc
---
In quest it's your first kill so of course it takes long, second time you know things so it makes it easier even though boss is harder
---
I just hit level 100 and no firecape.. it’s intimidating to me and I’ve never been good at PVMing.
---
What do you achieve from completing Fight Caves on a level 14? A fire cape, bad example, but clearly in gear where you have virtually no stat bonuses it’s impressive. Its basically the equivalent of doing one without any armor at all. Dont be daft.
---
i’ll be your friend

Money is money. Call it whatever you want but it's not as if they are advertising a hitman for hire or something terrible... It's a gold selling ad for an online game, get over yourself. This is the real world and business is business

Sup fellow ironman.
---
But in all seriousness, everyone wants a money sink, nobody wants it to be *their* money.
---
Well that's disheartening. Thanks for the info.
---
But you don't unnote them, you can just add charges to your already unnoted rings, if they break you are stuck with bunch of useless rings

$7 USD for 5M with Bonds
---
$7 USD for 14M from goldselling websites
---
Missing your chance is a very valid point. However I just disagree. I don't think discontinued items/achievements/whatever should be in the game. I believe a *game* shouldn't impose any real-world restrictions (e.g. limited-time events) on you in order to complete them.
---
The problem is I don’t know what parts are good to pick
---
Seeing a lot of comments calling this a scam. It's not. He said can someone nice GIVE me x amount. Not loan me, not trade me for something, GIVE me.
---
Bonds are a necessary evil for the greater good though. It also serves as a gold sink while helping increase the longevity of the game by giving Jagex extra money...
---
Thanks!

Why not? The entire game is based on using your real-world time to complete tasks. If you're saying that the dragon rank is unrealistic for a normal person to achieve under such constraints that is something I might be able to get behind though.
---
This is a scam.
---
Yes, it was clearly a mistake.
---
&gt;The entire game is based on using your real-world time to complete tasks.
---
Well sure, but that's inherent to gaming. It's not Jagex deciding to do that, whereas these trophies are Jagex just arbitrarily doing it.
---
I don't have enough IQ to understand this joke....
---
There’s a really good video on YouTube that has just the sounds of bad and what you should pray during it, when I first learned to do it I watched that and practiced switching prayers beside an altar to get used to the atmosphere. 
---
You could also just say to yourself what to pray if your on the wave right before Jad.
---
I thought so because of dear player instead of dear cf11
---
Torture amulet, primordial boots, bandos chest and legs, neitiznot faceguard and a rapier or blade of saeldor depending on if you like quests
---
That's an expensive meme. Nice.
---
Jagex will never refer to any of your accounts as "pures" and whatnot. Theyll also never email to Junk. If it was legit youd be banned already so if you're not banned you're good
---
Rick? More like RICH with that 3rd age robetop.

Do people actually struggle to get fire capes in 2019 on accounts with 70+ def? Mindblowing to me, the fight caves are so trivial with defence and prayer 43+

It reads pretty poorly. I was thinking fake the whole time
---
If you recieved it in your junk mail. It's probably a scam. jagex doesn't email people telling them that they are going to ban all there accounts if they don't appeal the offense. They would ban the accounts and then you can appeal the offense afterwards.
---
Yes, it's virtually riskless if you aren't buying / selling billions at a time and would vastly speed up their grind.
---
I predicted a few months back when redi did his first jad video that level 8 is the lowest firecape possible, now lets see me get proven wrong :)

I was banned because someone high jacked my account jagex looked into it and un banned me because they could see that the up adress was over the other side of the world

Good luck, use some relaxation techniques near the end, you don't have to be fast wit da switches.

Not bad, good size!

I got to the jad phase and thought he always spawned in the middle. Turns out he spawns in one of the 360 locations and he maged me from off screen. Felt so bad, man..
---
You just discovered one of my favorite under 2m flips. You can get 20%-50% ROI on them all the time.  300% ROI is jackpot tho gz.
---
You could play Runescape on a Raspberry PI. Just make sure you parts are compatible.
---
I started with doing the waterfall quest, and slayer to level my combat level, i also did alot of hunter, i hunt red chins and I'm trying to get 99. Clue scrolls are fun, especially you need certain requirements, you can work towards those requirements to finish a clue scroll. minigames like barbarian assault
---
&gt;I was banned because someone high jacked my account jagex looked into it and un banned me because they could see that the up adress was over the other side of the world
---
Then the people hacking it are probably sending you a spam email, to get your details again, to then use your account again
---
50/50
---
Questing is a great way to start building your account, there is an efficient quest order list on the wiki that shows which quest rewards give lvls needed for the next quests on the list. Also don't forget to check your diary requirements every once in a while because if you start questing you Will get to the point where you Just have all requirements and can do them in 1 go for some Nice rewards.
---
Remember you can use other people's maxed houses to teleport around the game if you're not an Ironman. World 330 in rimmington always has people hosting.

Grats with a nice cape!

Jesus go to bestbuy and get a $150 Asus.

why no attempts? You can def do it and it’ll help u a lot

Thanks, i am now in the mainframe 😎

Bring some sweets
---
What’s happening?
---
Yes! Gratz dude! Click on it before the time runs out though
---
From my perspective the skillers are evil.
---
Gratz man! I’m 6 quests off. Did ds2 yesterday and kinda sad that I’m nearing the end. I like osrs quests.
---
0.00000065% chance to get pet + smouldering from same kill, 0.0000026% chance to get pet + any crystal/stone, and the rng kept coming. WTF.

I was posting it on my phone with bad signal, I can't actually delete the 4 posts as they don't show up on my account. It bugged out, check the time they were posted, all within a few seconds of eachother but you can only post once every 10 minutes.
---
I don't know what you mean by "xp earned under the character." If you're talking about the XP tracker in the top right of that screenie, that's just a feature of the vanilla client (click the orb by the minimap labeled 'XP'). The rest of what youre describing is Runelite.

The same casino alone can prop up these gold sites. People make a fortune and sell their gold for cheap to the selling sites. The people that lost their fortune buy more gold from these sites for a higher price.

Bigger raids arent harder
---
You got to be kidding lol. It's not even close about being an iron man. It's dead content for normies and irons. Or are you telling me you are doing The Gauntlet on a normal account? Don't lie to yourself.
---
wow you said the thing
---
It's not really a glitch. It's a mechanic of the Ring of suffering that's overlooked. I don't think jagex meant for this mechanic to be valuable.
---
Absolute madman
---
It stops really being impressive when you think it’s literally 30+ hours of sitting in your chair, tick eating. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a really cool accomplishment. But man. Not realistic
---
You said yourself that you want it for fashion, and not because of the stats. So you're choosing to go out of your way for an item which has a very small upgrade compared to other options, then complaining about it knowing you went for it in the current state. You could just not go for it? 
---
Full runs can be done in 7 minutes. Let's add some downtime and say even at 8 minutes and an avg of 540k/kill including shards/uniques, it's 4m per hour. It doesn't really need a buff, just stop dying lol.
---
Look @ the streamable i posted?
---
I mean, you'll still end up on the regular Ironman hiscores anyways?
---
You don't need them for anything it's just helpful
---
What
---
Mod Kieran decided to pay W390 ge a visit
---
Or maybe he doesnt buy his gp who knows ^.*
---
Haha let me tell you about corp. A kill takes roughly 15 minutes tops (solo), with a chance of a 800 mil shield. So it only takes 2-3 minutes longer each run with almost no chance of death (and therefore wasted minutes) while the normal loot is probably very similar. Corp is semi-afk and not intensive at all, while The Gauntlet is...
---
You're really really really reading way too much into this. And you're overestimating the value that people put on "being a failed HCIM" in the hiscores way too much. People do it because you might as well. Nothing to lose.
---
Probably just not worth the time to learn for them. Fight caves is not that hard. I only do it for the Slayer xp because Jad tasks are amazing. Fire cape is very unnecessary.
---
Poll booth made me vote

Poor use of supplies, bad at flicking jad.

Don’t trust anyone who makes these kinda posts. Just fucking show the names lmao
---
one idea is to go to f2p world by draynor bank, collect the logs bots and cutters drop then bank them and fletch those
---
You'd have to nap it out so they are hitting you on the same tick ? Or stacking them so only one hits. I'm not saying it's reasonable. None of this is reasonable. But ya know
---
It's entirely possible - Joe rogan
---
What plugin shows pt/hr
---
Get to jad and sit in a safe spot. Have a few beers, have a YouTube video playing in the background.  It’s just a game of controlling your nerves.
---
Just got my first ever fire cape this weekend, took 11 tries. Constantly reminding myself in my head it was done at 8 cbt. Still proud.
---
because between all my accounts, i have nearly 90 jad KC. I've done it enough that everything is just muscle memory, theres no panic, etc
---
Well no someone getting good rng doesn't cause someone else to go dry. They're statistically independent. The game doesn't say "I am only going to give out 1 sigil every 4000 kills" and then force those odds by limiting the drop for others. Each roll on the table is done independent of every other roll.
---
Shit my bad CARDI B ES MI MADRE
---
Yeah just gotta PAFT
---
I go in phases with this. So far I'm in the passive phase where I just view RS content but don't really feel like playing it.
---
Most high level players have the money to get the best gear that money can buy. They're not debating whether it's worth it to make 20M more for tassets or do the fight caves.
---
Cuz after one hour of glorified nmz palms start to sweat and when your only experience with prayer is offering bones to an altar suddenly you dont flick so good and jad maxes 97, meaning a trivial mistake can send you back to lumbridge.
---
Why is duos better for pets?
---
&gt;Scammers
---
Actual question how is giving someone saying "pls give me 500k" the money that they're asking for, then watching them disappear a scammer? Do they expect the person to just give them 1b in supplies?
---
what do you mean unknown, it was Kob who did it
---
This is SO me when I play. lol I wasted all my saved time on Netflix and Pornhub while I afk. :D Law runes are cheap, might as well use 'em!
---
Please don't bot
---
Amulet of bounty, Amulet of chemistry, Dodgy necklace, Binding necklace, Ring of pursuit, Ring of forging, Ring of recoil - All witg exact same mechanic.
---
😂
---
How tf did anyone get scammed here? Dude was just asking for 500k, got it and left. If anyone expects anything outside of just being generous they're entitled
---
Just. Ignore. Beggars.
---
Took me 20+ hours to get a fire cape (and maybe 10mil+ in resources) and I almost never use melee for anything anyway, so it's quite literally useless to me. And even when I do use melee I generally prefer the ardy cloak for the prayer bonus, so I can camp my protection prayers longer without pots.
---
Only reason I wanted the cape was so I could get access to the inner part of the Tzhaar city and fish infernal eels (and access the shops).
---
The fire cape is pretty much fashion scape.
---
What an absolute god. Mod ash gets me wet
---
I spent close to 3 hours in the caves on my main a year or two ago. I didnt understand the prayer switches with Jad. Died only  like 30 seconds into the fight.  I am ashamed to say that  ive been playing since 2007 or 8 and that is my ONLY attempt i have ever made. Now have my iron man at 105cb and still feel like im not good enough to make it. almost 100 levels on that 8cb fire cape and still feel like i cant do it. smh
---
Probably Barrows with those stats in terms of PVM. Unless you have Mory hard done you'll not be making nearly as much though
---
you can imbue black masks as well
---
first I thought sailing was dumb. then somebody pitched it as a minigame where you can upgrade like construction on your PoH, and add cannons of different levels (bronze to rune etc.) and it made me think sailing would be dope.
---
Imagine PVP comes back to life, as a sailing minigame?
---
You learn to safespot on tutorial island...

I read on another post that they post the four digits to screenshot when real world trading. Maybe someone here can give more insight.

Hi I'm new to the community, can someone fill me in on the crab meme?
---
Welcome back to os, hope you had a good fap
---
log out on the wave before the double magers, and let your heart slow down. I had that problem too and had to reset myself before the jad fight. alternately safespot jad like the other guy said and just wait to calm down.

---
what do you mean, wintertodt is a perfect skill. 
---
TBH i think needing a light source in dungeons should have been a more explored mechanic for the skill, and getting cooking boosts from different fires, or needing different fires for different foods, maybe needing a FM level to use a range for cooking.
---
Make sure you’re using the F hotkeys to switch between tabs. Makes swapping between inventory and prayer way easier.
---
I give u 5gp if u do the emote.
---
Downvote because I’m sick of seeing Kemp q
---
you sure? i mean im pretty sure they were just whatever shit food he has in the bank. he did a few rounds with sardines and half pizzas too.
---
How do you not burn your house down?  Osrs just absolutely puts the processor on blast even with max fans (2018 mbp here)
---
Osrs is the name, cause it isn't 07Scape anymore. Sooo yeah. The name stays even if they add new models.
---
do u even lift breh
---
im pretty sure you can just rock cake and tick eat the rock cake provided things are offticked, and i think you can get a rock cake on a lv3?
---
https://streamable.com/ugovj
---
example
---
Never heard of anyone stopping early 90s some people stop at 96/97 melees. The range is so high because i got 70 before firecape then did blowpipe/cannon for slayer lvls.
---
don’t train on pvp worlds?
---
just get lucky lol
---
Depends on gear/levels. At lower/mid levels with budget you'd expect 5-10 kills per trip depending on supply drops, but at max levels in max gear you can get up to 30-50 kill trips easily, as you take basically no damage (and any you do is healed back with SGS/BP) so you only bring prayer
---
Im working on a 3rd drag account atm so im the opposite I find them relaxing and rakes in gp
---
Sorry but you're wrong, the normal gargoyles are undoubtedly lower gp and xp per hour, either do a task or even just check the wiki before making false claims
---
Could you explain what is wrong with this picture? I don’t play LMS and don’t know what I’m looking at
---
Or just have an inkling of self-control?
---
This is not a pvp world?
---
I didnt say this was a perfect efficiency time taken quite the opposite I suck at speed questing and did stuff like mlm for mining. You could take literal days off my time.
---
What did it say
---
You craft stuff to mine stuff and mine stuff to craft stuff? Who made that game, Jerry?  
---
Wait there's a skill you have to run across the world for to get a tiny bit of xp and then go back to the other side of the world to bank? Who made that game? Jerry?
---
Easier version, against gorrilas you have to flick, eat, move, and at the very least one way switch. On waves 1-62 you just have to sip ppots and camp a certain prayer, and vs jad you just swtich prayers and aggro the healers and thats it.
---
rotate cam 180
---
Lol?
---
Ridiculous PVM drops catered to ironmans is why the economy sucks for skilling
---
I was the same exact way, I know it sucks because it feels like a giant time waste when you lose.. keep trying, you will get better, it will get easier. I got my first fire cape on a main after failing like 10 times, I eventually got to the point of finishing it on pure within a week. Hang in there. (:
---
&gt;u/cokebrowedder
---
I don't get your point, you told them you were banned for macroing, they confirmed you were banned for macroing. What else are they to do? If you appealed that you weren't macroing then maybe they'd care to look into it and unban you, in any other case a permanent ban is a permanent ban.
---
I've heard of starting at 96 but never that early haha, Either way doesn't matter the combat is afk the questing/skilling is the bitch.

probably magic levels. and torm brace. you didnt show stats.

Soon i'll have 3 rune dragon accounts, a gwd alt, def tank and my main.
---
“This is the best comment ever”
---
Join the gear discord and ask in the question channel
---
plug a mouse into your phone
---
And that's simple enough they could easily do it... accept when they get banned and perpetually start world war 3 over Runescape GP.
---
The beegees method works the best imo
---
Not really. Even on an early ironman you just wait til you collect enough essence from that wizard with time. Bosses drop so much essence now too that its not even worth it from a gp perspective for regular accounts.
---
Are you sure they aren't selling blood and soul runes?
---
i'm 99 ranged and 93 magic. i think getting 99 magic will help a lot so ill probably do that first. thank youu
---
For a rune drag alt unlocking those prayers and construction would be a big waste imo, You have to bank anyways so the house barely saves time, and costs gp and time that should be invested in my main.
---

I read this in Rick’s voice and it made it even better

I would like to say yes but I have zero faith in Jagex when multiple max cash stack bugs happened.

Good luck!

The gear he is wearing isn't possible with his stats (the stats on the right are his) they are also up to date based on the combat being matching. People theorised that he is taking items out of LMS some how being that this is basic tank armour, or something? I've never played it myself. You have max stats in LMS which is why he'd be able to equip these items so that's why it makes the most sense to have been smuggled through LMS, but it could be something else entirely!
---
24 hr in game, gg. RIP your xmas event items.
---
He is very handsome
---
Side note - the tea can still be useful.
---
When the stew brings your con below your base level, it would be wasteful to try to stew again since that +5 boost would partially be used to bring you back to neutral. However, the tea is a cheap way to bring your con back to neutral so you can keep stewing for that real +5.
---
Super restores work too, but hey, I'm cheap
---
He’s wearing a black dhide body and barrows gloves with low skills (black dhide requires 70 ranged)
---
Can't believe they turned the By Release intro into an emote
---
On the website there is a place to appeal for bans and mutes that you have already tried to appeal (at least I recall since I attempted to appeal this last week.) it asks what you were banned for, and it asks why you’re appealing. It clearly has a option for I’ve changed as a human being. I clicked that as my reason for appealing my account that was banned 8 years ago, when I was 13. I didn’t need a confirmation that I was banned for macroing.
---
It's a courtesy at this point
---
You'd be limited by food at that point. You'd also need very specific setup to make sure enough all possible hits are on the same tick, because 1 hit offticked just enough could hit you for 3 right after healing.
---
Likely you'd be running sweets, RoS, noted rings, spare Recoil, rock cake, and rest brews. You'd only be able to reliably tick eat multiple hits 92 times without prayer so everything is luck at that point.
---
That about tracks with your stats. I get 10-12 kills per invent with 75 ATK 80 STR 87 range. Tbh I'd just wait to do them until your stats are closer to mine. If you have to spend 15-20k in supplies per gorilla then it's not worth the effort.
---
But Reddit said that those people only use Twitter!
---
Yeah but you still can't look at 1 example of good rng and say that it directly causes bad rng. It may look that way on a large scale but they actually have no influence on each other. I know I'm just being an ass at this point lol
---
Like Pocket Mortys but in Runescape?  
---
So, RickScape?
---
He should have been mine yesterday, however I have a cold at the moment and while on jad I had an uncontrollable sneezing fit. Needless to say I missed my flick and got ranged into oblivion. 
---
But I didn’t know that where the orange 360 spawns is where Jad will spawn, that’s a huge help! Thank you

Get your combats a bit higher (especially attack and str maybe magic too), get 50 firemaking for wintertodt, get some extra 200k-300k. Then do some quests and do birdhouse runs when you are a member. Also finish all of the free quests
---
i do, but im also a skillert so that kinda took that option away fairly quick
---
That's just Australian christmas, don't be racist.
---
I'd be happy to link the screenshots of drops haha.
---
20m for box grants access to more teles than just glory and it’s a one time fee. You spare yourself having to buy scrolls every so often, you don’t have to use ring slot for ROW, and over time scrolls add up, especially if you use that (or any of the other teles in the box) often, which you absolutely will. 
---
Arguing that recharge scrolls are better than the box is funny because it’s considerably worse in every way unless you rarely teleport to the places the box offers teleports for

i gave it an hour and figured as much, if i didnt have to wait the 1 min for next ticket i would have stuck too it but since its 1 ticket per min it takes at least 1000 min to get the 1k ticks which doesnt sound #worth anymore + I was failing way more often than expected with 91 agility (dont recall failing this much when i got the brimhaven graceful)

Seriously sick of these posts. Make a new account and move on. No sympathy here. Make a new account based on the new person you are today and there shouldn't be any issues. If Jagex felt like your account was worth unbanning, they would have done it. A reddit post won't change their mind.

I don't want to call it QoL because it's not really, but the 2 requests that players have been making forever is 1 or both of:
---
1) Alter the orb phase in some way, players shouldn't be punished for interacting with the mechanic the intended way but rewarded for just ignoring it. Change the orb attack to 2 forms, first form damages the boss instead of the player when you pick it up, second form damages the player when they pick it up, then it fires at the boss to heal. The attack should trigger faster overall so people don't just ignore it but it should always be possible to get all 3 orbs in the first form, maybe spawn them closer to the player?
---
2) Let us attack during the phase where they're doing nothing but maybe make it something like you take massive damage if you stand beside them for more than 1 tick
---
Not this s#it again. You do realize this isnt 2001? You can literally train your stats. Why are you showing off such shite account? You can train prayer by killing skeletons. Aint that fuckin complicated.

I'm like 4 off now. I'm saving DS2 for last but I just can't bring myself to do the others.

I dont think rune dragons were "catered" to alts, its just a simple fact oldschool combat is click and wait therefor that caters to alts.
---
And I say that only because I find it hard to believe somewhere along that painstaking grind... you will have a moment of weakness and finish 99 strength
---
Yeah they’d have sent the bailiffs round fucking hell

So this video was my introduction to your content and I just binge watched a bunch of your other videos. All I’ve got to say is outstanding job, my friend, and please keep it up. Your content, aside from being entertaining, is great for this game we all love so much. It makes this game feel more unique and special than it does on its own. 
---
Thank you man, sincerely, for what you do. You’ve gained a new subscriber and a new fan.
---
I got it to on android, have to download a program called octopus or something it's kinda shit cant right click either.  
---
But Jad on mobile isn't to bad as long as you have decent stats. Got mine the 2nd try at 110 combat lol.
---
He has a firecape

Call it whatever you want, I'm on my main that isn't banned :)

They are probably targeting you for a reason

---
I don’t even play iron but Ironman has sorta exposed how reliant normal accounts are on bots to provide all the annoying as fuck items to get. I mean who tf is actually going to do runs to charge air orbs consistently or do plank runs.
---
Season 1 DMM, no GE, no “safe” spaces for mules where teams of players could for a cost of dying themselves suicide on people like in eve online.  Brutal deaths.  I’d say maybe keep the exp regain multiplier, the rest needs to be brutal.
---
I thought it was a good theory
---
Lmao who's the troll that sent the fake message
---
I have rigour, but dragon darts and that's not a garenttee skip, that's ridiculous
---
&gt; how is it possible that herblore isn’t profitable 
---
That’s pretty specific. You can also farm shards both literally and at zalcano. If op wanted tips on cheapest method to exp op would have asked.
---
&gt;why do people make potions if they’re going to sell them at a loss.
---
Again, a specific question. That question asks about rates vs profit. Faster exp = cost, slower = profit. Changes some at higher level potions.
---
I don't play RS so this could be a dumb question:
---
You need to take damage to dish damage using ring of recoil. You are tick eating to prevent death while dealing damage. The old strat was poison and prayer flicking. Do you even need prayer anymore using the new ring of recoil strategy?
---
People been saying never for the last 5 records lol
---
It is considerably harder than the waves up to that point. Just got my first fire Cape just a short while back. You pretty much need to have mage prayer on at all times (unless you are absolutely sure the mager can't attack you from behind a rock) and you might need to tank some melee hits from the 180s.
---

If you had to get 99 IRL, how would such an accomplishment be measured? For example, 99 cooking. Would getting a Michellin star signify that?

You dont have to prove ownership to change a password, you only need your password. How did you find the link to change your password? Was it in an email?

I use ely on the main, alt uses a justiciar helm and buckler, both use rigour. I usually have an inventory full to the brim of food too.

Cool man, what can you tell me about drugs?
---
Watch the video you're commenting on Christ
---
Yo something I actually don't see said much is that the wiki has a list of all possible rotations. Once you know which rotation you're on you can tab out to check what the next waves will have every time you're safespotted. If you take a sec to plan every wave there is basically 0 chance you die up to jad
---
go take a nap
---
I do hope it gets looked in to, it could be incredibly game breaking if not.
---
Adwaam has kc on mobile
---
There is one but ok
---
It does... lol there are sources.
---
Not that much harder honestly. You just pray mage and try to kill the rangers first. The safe spot on the west is super easy to use. I used the blowpipe with 75 range and used just under 10% scales.
---
Hahaha i know, they got me good
---
I mean it's not so much an achievement as a silly thing to do purely for the fun of it
---
No you're right you get max combat and that gear set up. Whether youre a lvl 3 or 126 in game.

I'm on attempt number 15 on a computer. First 11 attempts I kept getting nervous and Miss clicking my prayers. Attempt 12 I ran out of prayer, 13 I steps next to jad trying to hit the healer. Attempt 14 everything was going peachy until the f****** healers poked me to death. no joke I eat some food I'll do an exercise I play some calming music in the background I have a fan blowing on me and I even pray before I do this s*** to try and stop myself from being too nervous. I know exactly what I need to do I have really good gear for it I just got the big suck 😭
---
Yeah it's a scam

no!

Are you daft or just pretending bud? He's not saying he thinks the record will never be broken, just that as far as this method is concerned this is the bottom. Just like how rendi only got to 9 by using a new strategy and went from 14 to 9, if someone were to find a way to do this without prayer, it'd drop not to 7 but to like 4 or w/e the min cb exp req would be.
---
Woox only plays like 2 weeks a year for major events/bosses
---
you can msb/broad bolt all tasks and profit
---
just get 200m fm xp at wintertodt solos and youll get around 94-95 construction
---
He’s not saying it can’t be broken, but that if it’s broken there’s no reason it’s be broken by 1, when it could be broken by 4. Read.
---
Umm 199 and I thought I never ever play

You can safe spot black demons and blood velds. Save up some of the drops and buy cannonballs. I was similar to you and didn’t want to burn GP, but I made a decent amount of money saving all my drops.
---
Are you upset at the fact that your lvl 100 combat bracelet account is still stuck with obby cape?
---
I guess i asked for it and the community does not disappoint
---
Good video, but it could be better. More!
---
I never said vangs weren't fine and I do them in 3c cropes. I said they're slower than other rooms. In solos, you have to take extreme care to not reset them since every weapon is so strong and that feels slower than being in other rooms. I'd rather the room be more like something where you off tick them all and can prayer flick them all while max DPS them down, not needing to be concerned with resetting with a random high hit.
---
Justiciar with the set effect helps you get longer trips while using less supplies, although slightly longer kill times.
---
It is worthless at Vorkath because you will fill up your inventory with loot before using all of your supplies, and it is very quick to travel back there.
---
Twisted league wont even be out for that long in total. And it still has like a month left
---
This comment is not funny
---
Well to suddenly make them discontinued doesn’t make sense.
---
The original poll in 2013 was very close to passing.
---
There’s a space between iron and man. That’s 8 words.
---
TECHNICALLY you can die in an unsafe way. It’s extremely rare and with death mechanics as they are it wouldn’t matter unless you’re a hcim anyway.
---
But you can lose all your hp to jads healers after killing jad, get teleported out and die.
---
All that is to say it’s like a 1 in 1000 thing and you’re entirely right it’s a safe mini game.
---
My point is that people have said that after every new record, and that’s a true statement. Read.
---
Which are slower than rope and crab rotas.
---
The high demand for potions makes it very cheap to train, while the high demand for Herblore xp works in the other direction.
---
Care to explain why? It makes perfect sense to me. Is it because language barrier or what?
---
sure but thats solos, theyre one of the fastest in teams. cox really isnt balanced around solos, it just happens that solos end up being very good pts/hr. in teams you can basically just max dps down melee+ranger with scythe and bp down mager without holding dps at all. solo vangs actually just got harder with higher tier weapons instead of faster, which is just a downside for them basically giving you a full prep worth of food.
---
how valuable that is depends on your skill, ofc if you have 0 need for supply drops they arent gunna be a great room.
---
You mean I have to spend 10x as long for 1 level???
---
Ironman in RuneScape is generally used as one word.  I used englished captions on the videos so I fixed the other two problems but figured this would get mentioned as well
---
yes, it's basically a magic version of the rune thrownaxe spec. 
---
this built-in spell has no base exp so barraging is still higher max hit and exp per cast.
---
Just be the first one through and close it on everybody's face
---
/s ?
---
I really don't understand what you mean by this reply. I think some words are missing.
---
whatever you want, ill message you my user name easier to talk in game.
---
was about to go to edgeville from ge and was right b4 entering the tunnel shortcut, ran all the way back to ge, bought a glory, and teleported instead.
---
Rendi who?
---
they said if they ever stopped making leagues they'd make them obtainable
---
Haha I figured. Still works. Proud of you.
---
how so?
---
Are any WR times set with a vanguards rotation?
---
So you just have brain damage then.
---
Which is the same location that the orange 360 spawns so no *
---
well, cannonballs are super cheap, using them will break you even and even profit in the long run
---
Only rich players say that. I’d take the GP any day.
---
You think he’ll be done theorizing by then?
---
is that a serious question?
---
I always viewed it as a sign of commitment towards pvm. If I was running a learners raid, I’d rather teach the person with the pizza cape because it showed that they spent the time to learn and complete the challenge.
---
At this rate which would be some pretty try hard efficiency from my experience doing Corp you would still be waiting 70 hours if you hit a sigil on drop rate. Although I have been a part of three sigil splits so I still do it but I could never solo for big chunks of time way too slow.
---
Time to invest in party hats
---

I don't know why you got downvoted, you shoot through the fence so it's a mechanic they obviously built certain areas around
---
Spawns aren’t random. You can choose the spawn layout of the waves based on the specific time you enter the cave for the first time.
---
Bro, Rendi literally sells infernal capes...
---
Sounds like someone doesn't own a firecape. :/
---
the game is like 20 years old dude, I don't know what you expect
---
it's not "dying" it's just existing, you really want people to play forever?
---
they just think they're right because they've been following the wiki without thinking for 5 years, and to admit they're wrong in any way would make them feel dumb
---
Waow
---
Imagine convincing yourself unironically that its basically the same thing
---
Welcome to the club, king
---
I didn't know that but if you're rwting you shouldn't be allowed to play anymore. Im actually surprised this is even a debated sentiment.
---
Seems pointless.
---
If an iron gets a bow or God forbid a scythe everyone else loses.
---
But the iron can't benefit even if everyone else is splitting.
---
So goodie! then there is me who has been playing for 15 years and I still haven’t got fire cape :(
---
I've been doing inferno runs last few says and last night I didn't spawn them and just about had time after healers, now didn't overperform but hit fairly well in regards to timers

Most of my attempts though I've been spawning second set to be safe

If you were able to log in on a specific tile after a wave, like inferno, would that help the level 4 fc? u/xzact7
---
I took a break and when I came back I tried cerb and got 2 prims in 10 kills. Needless to say I'm playing a lot more again
---
Cut oaks/maples so you get better rewards from wt. That and you could use oaks for con or maples for fletch
---
You’re right the opportunity cost is too great 
---
That’s why people buy accounts even though they know it’s going to get recovered 
---
*They rent an account with the possibility of maybe keeping it*
---
The parent comment was saying "lvl 7 fire cape when". The record will **never be lvl 7**, because should the record be broken, it'll be **even lower** than 7, since it'd be done without all the combat levels gained from prayer.
---
You need to look like a pain to attack, you should always be 3 iteming with a reasonable plus 1, for example I bring crystal shield dharok legs guthans helm and bgloves +1, I wear phoenix necklace(to counter claws) and ring of recoil I use seed pod or glory as Tele, you should bring brews a few good food antivenom and stamina, bring an rcb with dstone bolts to attack back while frozen, no one should kill you, tbers you just run south and tank, ancients you wait out freeze and run to 30 and Tele the only time I've died is when a guy spellbook swapped just make sure to stay high health and pray swap correctly
---

Good to know. Watched a couple videos with the over heal thing... wasn’t sure how difficult the process was. Thanks mate.

And now I owe /u/HEXAG0NY 10 mil... these lower and lower fire capes are costing me too much in bets.

Make sure you have your F1-8 keys set to make it easier, you won’t miss one single prayer switch I swear to god...

You think this is impressive? I'm working on my 2277 total level with no fire cape account lol
---
If you trade em to me I can trim that armour real quick for yah
---
This is my 3rd task and they must be a very different thing for anything below endgame.  For me, they are just an xp task and maybe 3-400k/hr profit when not afk'd.  I'm sure they are neither for any zealous mid or even high level slayers.  I would disable the ability for later masters to assign them if these weren't pretty good xp for me.
---
Built in zammy flame makes it so you would only need to fit what, 6 runes for dps, entangle and tb that's pretty big, plus if its auto charged would mean u dont manually choose the spell, I'm sure there's more applications to where that would be pretty strong
---
Ah, I wasn’t sure
---
Where are all the mods? They say botting is a big deal, yet there is no one monitoring on the big servers at the GE for bots clogging up the chat, and right now there are a ton on the PK free world between the fountain and bank chest in Lumby, that I can't even report because I left click in one spot and the screen is full with "Attack .... (Level 3)" option.
---
Level 7 specifically is unlikely because the prayer requirement gets you to level 8. If you can do it without prayer (which nobody said is impossible in this thread) you would be able to drop to level 4 or 5.
---
You don’t need to spec it a billion times. There’s a point where you can eat a few times and last through a kill with way less specs
---
You can make this account in less than 30 minutes of gameplay. Prayer is ez cayse no one goes to hill giants anymore. Firecape is easy too. Specially with rigour. 37 is noobish and lame. Get better stats bro and then flex
---
damn with such reading comprehension, I sincerely hope you don't vote in polls lol
---
Two quick ones. Body armor.
---
nah mate, you're wrong
---
Maybe you meant rigour but you don't need to buy piety. Just have to do the knights training on the top.floor of cammy castle. Use full guthans as it has all attack styles each knight is weak too.
---
Unlikely
---
You have so much hp xp that youd have to cannon a lot
---
And that would give you range xp, which you also have a decent amount of

Ok jagex

That sawmill operator must be the richest NPC in the game. Not only do we pay crazy amounts of money to him, we give him multiple individual logs and receive a single plank in return. What's he doing with the rest of the logs?

Okay kemp 😂😂

I 100% expected this to be a hoax/some kinda meme. Wow, well done
---
What are your combat stats?

&gt;I did not play this game and I hated it

So it would save 2-3 inventory slots? Is that a big deal?

Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

probably just as likely to have a bit flip on jagex' server and set your cb to 4
---
I don't see why we need discontinued items. It doesn't make sense to have an item be worth 1b+ just because they were only obtainable in 2001.
---
i have the spec restoring pool but not high enough con to upgrade to hp healing.
---
Are you sure it will take 45 minutes?
---
Just do MM2 and chin in the tunnels. Will save you a load of time in the long run.
---
Next year is technically a new decade :0
---
I found watching a video of someone doing jad and prayer flicking on your client as if you're the one fighting him worked for cooling nerves/ getting used to the rhythm
---
You can even add something to make it more complex in between flicks, like fletching or firemaking
---
That and knowing earlier in the animation if he's gonna stomp or lift up to mage. If you see the bottom of his paws, he's gonna stomp. If he tucks in, mage. :)
---
I agree it would be very different but at the same time some serious shit would have to change. I kinda meant that Ironman has exposed how poorly planned some aspects of the economy are, and are virtually reliant on bots because who is seriously going to do extremely monotonous and boring tasks that are horrible xp/hr and at best alright gp/hr. Classic bot stuff like zammy wine telegrabbing, plank making, air orb charging, spinning flax or fishing stuff like lobsters. Heck even filling empty jugs with water and there are bots that literally drink wines so they can sell the empty jug for a profit. These are all rubbish xp/hr (if they even give xp) and bad gp/hr. 
---
The gp/hr would have to go up significantly to get someone that can afk brutal black dragons for 1m profit an hour to start charging air orbs(not afk) or fishing lobs (way worse xp than barb fishing). The economy is literally reliant on bots and that’s why they will never fully disappear.
---
Yeah. Without hp restore you have to go to the bank, take out food, eat food, take out more food, back to poh, then Corp. not only will it be longer but now your supply cost has effectively 5-6x’d in price. You’d only make profit if you got extremely lucky at that point
---
Inb4 w00x combat level 4 run with a rubber chicken

Basically he had a video series theorizing a 19 CB fire cape but never actually did it. And then Rendi took 18 CB fire cape with a different method. It was from quite a while ago.
---
Imagine 10 years ago saying some1 could get a fire Cape on lvl 8
---
eulC looC
---
I used to be against a comp cape in osrs, I thought that honestly there's so much and max is so hard, it's a bit overkill.
---
Having gotten my account to where it is though, I honestly think a comp cape is a good idea, my only recommendation for a guild is that there is none. Because is there's no guild for most things, just as we have no max guild or quest guild. Champions and heros guilds dont get a ton of use and I do see your point about completionist youtubers doing the generate task method, but I don't know how you would want to build a guild around that, would love to hear more.
---
And for cape, I agree with option two, it should be just a cosmetic but a powerful one.

im also still wanting for champion max cape &gt;:c

Rats in wildy drop them. Recoil ring with a lot of food should do it

Jagex had actively worked against cml, and all 3rd party fan sites/apps using highscores, for years, by putting in random incredibly dumb rate limits on the API, randomly reordering the API output with no notice or even message, and right now their own highscores are incredibly laggy, and multiple highscore categories completely dont work (some boss categories show TL points and some show nothing)

Just got my first basilisk task today after finish exiles last week. Mid level account (80s melee, 87 range, 86 mage, 103cmb)  and I'm burning through ppots on them, but still making a small profit. They're pretty chill even if the xp is slow, but I can see how after a few full tasks with no jaw it would be pretty lame.
---
Why would they provide you with a paid service for free?
---
Yes we do, if someone is banned you can still add them to your friends list but they dont show up on highscores
---
Since when you try to add the account you can't we know its a double name change
---
And here's my dumb ass wondering why they're in that order. Who puts Bloods and Astrals near the Air Runes? &gt;!Someone listing them in alphabetical order, that's who.!&lt;

the aim of snorting it is so it gets absorbed in your nasal walls. it gets absorbed very quickly there. the best way to do it is to crush the powder really fine for the most surface area, and gently snort it. you want to create a cloud in your nose essentially so the most can stick to the walls. instead of one fat like try cut it in half and do one in each nostril. you only have so much surface area in the nose so its better to do more frequent smaller lines than massive lines less often. though with speed it's fine to take orally so this is moreso advice for coke, ket etc

It literally tells you when you change name that the old name will be locked for 30 (?) days to your old account in case you change your mind and want to change back.

Never mind, I confused Chestbrah with Jasper S (35 combat 99 slayer guy)

Oh wow. Thanks for the explanation!

Just curious was it my name that made you think I'm some famous person?

I get what you mean, but people are also allowed to play for only 1-2h and be turned off enough to quit.

This happened before I even knew about the stronghold security. I only found out when I kept seeing rainbow boots and wanted them lol.

I mean you’re pretty close. Rendi was not the one who discovered it, he was just in a call with the people who discovered it while they were testing it. And his video about exactly how to replicate it didn’t come out until after jagex had patched it not before. Quit trying to act like Rendi is the responsible party here.

I'd say I have good subjective taste. Kemp's recent videos are no different to ANY other rs account series. Literally skill, quest, do some pvm. Wow. 
---
He was very rude to Rendi, blocking him and talking shit on discord. He's incredibly arrogant, and has accused people like Rendi of bug abuse, because he's too much of a shit head to admit that he's very mediocre at this game. 
---
Finally, I'd say the biggest thing he lacks is humility. Look at players like sick nerd, Mr mammal etc. They're not the most skilled players, yet are genuinely warming to watch, due to their charisma. Kemp is fucking DULL. Absolute snoozefest. 
---
Feel free to like him though.

This is very likely one of the abusers, or friends of the abusers.

They are seriously trying to get this thread taken down by any means. They are very concerned.

That’s the setup to the scam. The video you watch is a fake video. Look at the amount of views and number of subscribers on the video. You’ll also notice comments are disabled.

The scammer wants you to watch this anti-scam video and then try and scam the “scammer”. The whole time you’re watching and doing the anti-scam tactics but the scam they are doing is different and you’re just walking into their scam. The video could also have a link to the RS forums which isn’t really the RS forums and just a hacking site.

Definitely a scam. Just take the free Varrock tele and dip.

I want to throw up reading that
---
No. In my experience you typically get the free noted essence combined with slayer drop essence and that tides you over pretty well. I’d mine here and there in the early/mid game, which I don’t think is peak efficiency but also isn’t that bad.
---
Once you get to the more late game bosses though it’s pretty needless to ever mine it

1hp firecape inc.
---
What? That doesn't answer the question at all. Other than those four items, what is worth getting that costs more than 1m?
---
Only the best for God Ash
---
Runelite is a resource hog. Play on the official client or get a more powerful computer.
---
Mains being catered to by forcing Devs to make all new content rewarding past the pre existing content in order to keep the new content relevant is why the economy is fucked up. There’s enough skilling methods that irons would do to sustain themselves if PvM drop tables were nerfed but you and the other brainlets would lose your shit at the thought of bosses only dropping uniques vs 3M in common loot + a unique.
---
Absolutely should not have combined best in slot stats. Max cape variants are best scenario, cosmetics upgrades to show achievements not grind thousands upon thousands of hours for best gear. It may not raise max hits with best combined stats, but if im doing dagganoth kings, im wearing an assembler the whole time. A fire cape switch isnt worth it and mage cape absolutely isnt worth the inv space. If i have all 3 in one equipment slot that still raises my max hit of what i’d be able to do otherwise. 
---
Im not opposed to a cosmetics upgrade to the max cape variants for players who have done everything, throw in other stuff too like miniquests, random post quest achievements and stuff like that, but the functionality and equipment stats should not be any different than a regular max cape/max cape variant. The amount of time required is absurd to lock best in slot items behind and thats coming from a maxed iron.
---
People were alting gargoyles, nechs, and Aby demons long before rune dragons were relevant. The content isn’t be catered to considering alts have always existed.
---
Oh. Then dibs
---
it's less about not killing the crabs and more about not puncturing the tires on the vehicles.
---
However, basilisk knights have a 30m drop from a low level slayer monster. They should buff the drop table or nerf the boss to be honest
---
are you just staring at the screen while you play? just do it mindlessly while you do other work / watch movies/shows. 
---
if you want to actually play and focus on the game do something you enjoy more
---
Ironic how the ring of suffering actually prevented unneeded suffering in this case
---
Rendi had a 25 with pre nerf serp; moqi has a 29 with conventional methods but that came later.
---
Ok now I’m back to being sad
---
Reported for tongue
---
i'd love to, but the college kid budget isn't allowing for it right now sadly
---
Obby cape is just the fire cape but cooler.
---
You can turn off the bond icon on runelite in the options menu. I forget where but it's there.
---
92 to 99 wc in 2 days?
---
You talk about being unable to afford things yet you live in Minnesota hahahahaha.
---
Nah, some people actually play the game and enjoy the grind. Buying gp and skipping the grind (a major part of the game) is retarded. Just play a different game if you either don’t like the grind or don’t have time for it. It’s the reality.
---
do void range with dhcb and rigour, way better than melee
---
I'd probably cannon part of it if I were you
---
sire gets me high
---
Yster saltier than the dead sea omegalul
---
Multiple? I only know about the coin pouch update max cash bug
---
i was too
---
He may have got lucky but to say that infernal capes shouldn’t be awarded to people who get lucky is beyond stupid. This game is built on RNG and luck.
---
By his logic no drops would be earned because there’s always an element of luck.
---
Rendi's video explains trains def first, then gets to about 80 attack and strength exp.
---
lmao you'll be okay.
---
I am a narcissist. I won't deny that.
---
okay
---
taking back my comment, damn son...
---
Everyone has something going for them. :/
---
You can't 100% osrs anyway. You will never complete the collection log with third age on the clues. The fact that people are whining this hard over a useless cosmetic is ridiculous.
---
huh? I don't live in Minnesota. and what does that have to do with money?
---
Don’t forget to do the Xmas event before it goes away!
---
Hes using tank gear to tank? What a pleb his cape should be removed /s
---
They said on stream that's what they did. This came up when they were discussing the GMaul spec and how the LMS gmaul was just a copy of the real one.
---
&gt;how do you expect an ironman to get gear when somebody just turns up and steals their kill.
---
Because not every single kill is going to get stolen
---
also off-peak times exist, loads of bosses are instanced (which is bad design), and not playing iron man exists
---
you chose to play a 'challenge mode' and then complain when theres challenge
---
The helm really makes that much of a difference?
---
There’s a couple good online tutorials for breathing exercises.
---
Nice.
---
It's an MMO. Nobody is entitled to any spot whether it is killing a boss or cutting a tree. Sure you can view it as rude when someone comes to contest a spot at something but that is how the game is designed.
---
You must be an Ironman because everyone else just buys air orbs(better xp than fire orbs) and buys battle staves from ge or stock piles them from zaff.
---
So I'm having fun with the The task, but for a lvl 60 slayer monster they do take a while to kill. I think I'm averaging around 2 mins a kill. I think an average geared player of my stats should be able to kill a lvl 60 tank slayer monster in a min to a king and a half, so I do see why some people think they're too tough.
---
The problem seems to stem from the relatively low reqs compared to the BIS drop they have. Which is unfortunate. It seems either they stay tanky and rake a while, or the BIS melee head slot becomes obtainable for not a lot of gold. Rock and a hard place and all that.
---
I have no proposed solutions, just offering my perspective from 80 kills on task. So pretty much not too much weght to my opinion.
---
Pick a gathering skill to try out like woodcutting or mining. Learn everything you can about Varrock it will be your main City for a while.
---
Sorry I shouldn't have said that.
---
In my mind it had happened twice in OSRS for some reason.
---
also the guy who swapped a noted rune scim for noted mith scim at the last second. that fucker stole half my bank
---
Yeah. Kinda the theme of this..🤯
---
i am of course interpreting it in a more loose way, but the melody is there. it's probably the rhythmic displacements that make it harder to hear (do you listen to much jazz or stuff where well known tunes are often altered?). just gotta listen to that right hand. the melody is there but just rhythmically displaced and altered a bit. i guess i am just used to hearing tunes get really messed with.
---
How was song of the elves
---
Found the guy from the screenshot's reddit account
---
sit kid
---
Money isn't something inherent to you though.  It's not internal capabilities or personality or whatever you can derive genuine confidence from
---
Just chill with the wealth signalling and let your persona soften a little.  Presently you sound like you're not secure so you wealth signal to cover up for it.  That's not a sleight against you, it's a common occurrence 
---
Let this persona soften up a little bit, try just being yourself without letting your wealth be known and you may find you're even more likable that way
---
I mean its not bannable but it is kinda cunty, also how tf do you do dks on 3 worlds?
---
m’lady
---
The helm is meta.  This guy was clearly so eager to type his story that he didn't bother to actually read your comment.
---
They either die or alcohol poisoning or live long enough to see themselves get banned by jamflex lol
---
Wait true I'm dumb apologies everyone have a merry Christmas
---
yikes
---
How do you know if your getting bullied when you are splashing if you are afk
---
Vengeance combined with these new charged staves for basically no risk
---
Name fits
---
you can also just not unlock tzhaar tasks lol
---
Who’s that Pokémon?
---
Bandos is fun with friends
---
What does him being a PMOD have to do with anything? Why does it matter? Doesn't matter if you're an Iron zim/Iron zir/Iron non binary. If you're getting crashed and can't compete just find a different world. Waste of time to post on reddit about it.
---
Bold of you to assume I have friends
---
Yeah could’ve worded it better just meant so I’m not gaining range levels from hp and keeping hp gains in line with my combat xp
