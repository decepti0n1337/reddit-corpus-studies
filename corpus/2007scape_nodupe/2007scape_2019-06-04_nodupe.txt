&gt;the only reason they would bring void range with it is because it's awkward switching
---

---
This is just false the reason people being void range is because it's much much better than Arma on the bosses you range in tob.

If bloods then souls it’s going to somewhere around 65-70m

At first I thought it was a joke post about people actually socialising in W330 POHs.

Which one though?

My mom got upset with me a couple times yelling at my screen. To which I pointed out she does the same when watching political news channels

---
Or yknow they think that a word shouldn't be an insta mute and should always go off the context.
---
Picking and choosing what words are okay is a slippery slope that I'm glad jagex doesn't want anything to do with anymore.
---
 90% of players are over 18. Most of them are mature enough to deal with some taboo words.
---
Those people are still edgy fuck heads, but they have a right to be that way. Just as we have a right to ass them to ignore and call them pieces of shit.
---
Yeah it warns you, I use the spell to get my alt to wildy course
---
I have fond memories of beating Galvek and quest Vorki with the rcb and other welfare gear. 
---
getting the ruby spec was exhilarating compared to the piddly shit damage you otherwise do

Yeah.

it is absurd because most of the time they end up selling it for -5%, so it’s even less close to 10m

You can profit with ice burst and spend half as long. Profit with either is negligible regardless.

Thank you for the detailed response!

They're to weed out the noobs

Umm it's pronounced ranarr...

Yaya. Also alch is hp free
---
rich is kinda relative. I've got like 10m right now because I bought rigour and an ornate pool, spellbook swap and construction levels. It's going to take a bit to get back to where I can upgrade to dhcb
---
PM me your RSN I’ll and you and buy you a bond so you can get started on members.

If the left was Dharoks instead, I would see no difference between this and the original.

Listen here. We all know you're not getting laid.
---
Nice
---
Having high agility is nice though, so many shortcuts and quicker run regen. I used to hate doing agility back in the days, but the rooftop courses are pretty nice because they sprinkle Marks of Graces for you to get.
---
I've been doing vorki all day. I've seen 2 people with dhcb, and the other 50 or so were all using the same bgs+bp setup I was
---
Get Runecrafting up a bit so you can use Diary rewards on it.
---
Get 75 combat so you can do Konar slayer. I've been doing it on my alt and it's  a lot better than Chaeldar. At 85 you can use Nieve who generally gives better tasks.

Start Fairytale part 2 so you can use fairy rings.

You realize Jagex was one of the biggest driving forces in big game companies actually starting to listen to their game influencers on social media right?

Most likely not and definitely not "extremely easily"

Good luck bro, I believe in you. Don’t be discouraged if you fuck up, you’re supposed to fail. Whenever you die, look back and ask yourself why and how you died. Then figure out a way to not die the same way, what to improve, etc. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get it by your forth or fifth attempt, I promise you though going through with my method will 10000% help you a **lot**
---
Dog did you just comment on a four day old OSRS Reddit post.. the fuck is wrong with you

Seems kinda worthless on a regular account.

Thank you for your service

---
&gt; Shitty post with a shitty attitude. Don't snark at people offering you info you asked for.
---
Lol, did you not read the post either? Or are you completely blind? The greater demon task is an EXAMPLE. I already know where to cannon that, if you actually read my post you'd know that. 
---
Kind of frustrating when every single commenter is too lazy to read a post and just says where the greater demon task is, which is completely fucking useless info to me. But yea, thanks anyway!

Is jagex the government? No so they can tell you what you can say while you operate within their platform.

I’m about to do the same thing in two hours but imma try to finish my quest cape on my 10 hour flight lmao
---
Do you minimize all avoidable damage? The only time you can not avoid damage is when their next attack style is between range and mage. In that case you pray mage since range isnt as accurate. However like i said if one of the 2 styles is melee, run away a little and pray the other style it has up. If its melee then you can flick on melee pray before he reaches you. 
---
I usually end a trip at around 35 kills, which is when i run out of my range/super combat pot and my boosted stats get low. I bring 10 p pots. 5 way switch + SGS, super com/range pot, the teleport pod thing, and 4 sharks in case. Tho i rarely ever use them and usually just dump or eat for space lol.

You have members and cant afford a rune set??? Bro make some varrock tele tabs or something you can get it in like an hour of grinding those out

I used DrewG for 3 months straight to get 99 farming. The guy seemed like a bit of a twat but his house had the right teleports for farm running.

Shitty people exist, add them to ignore and move on.

agreed. those are huge money sinks but 17619061x more worth than dhcb.

Can message you our conversation if you dont believe me, he said he wants Acb and some gp. Kinda piesses me off hes doing them for free and charges me.

Do you work in the plastic field as well???

He had a post on the dead osrs subreddit complaining that someone was "defaming" him (they made a post on that sub about how he was having weird convos in game while hosting). I was one of the first to reply and got into an exchange with him. He's a strange person.
---
He drew so much attention to it and blew up that the mods of a dead sub didn't remove a post and that he's going to start posting things as well. He was insistent that what the other person said was defamation, when it wasn't, but he didn't reply when I told him to go to a lawyer with his "defamation" case.
---
People are fucking strange.
---
It's... odd. 
---
He certainly targets, but he only targets people doing it when he sees you.  As in, if he catches you doing it, he will target you when hopping unless he lands on a world where he can crash somebody else, in which case he follows them until he finds another person in the middle of it and vice versa
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
he himself said this yields the highest kc because you don't waste time scouring empty worlds
---
I disagree with the idea of alts but the rest of your points are spot on. Wealth in this game takes a lonnnng time to acquire.
---
Yes and no. Strength level scales in a line. But when you factor in potions and prayer, 79-89 will be a smaller boost than 89-99. 
---
You get a 23% strength boost with piety. You get 5+15% level with a potion. Because you boost to higher levels with pots and prayer those levels mean more
---
Make Agility a F2P skill and all non-rooftop courses available to F2P.
---
Keep rooftop courses P2P.
---
Thanks! :) That's good to know.
---
Is this meta now? because I totally am not seeing the improvement on my herb runs with attas/ultra/sectuars.
---
Deep mid game but you can't charge a glory or craft one? Hmmm
---
All he did was massacre people with no chance of fighting back.
---
That's like 75% of Wilderness PKing these days!
---
yeah it's called fun, as I stated, and that's my opinion sorry you're upset u dont actually get anything tangible from playing osrs lmao again coming from someone with like 1400 hrs over 6 years. I'm just not delusional and I play a healthy amount. and yes I can kill vorkath and snakey boi, and yes I buy bonds with gp. maybe that's why u guys r mad? bcos u pay like 120$ or something per year? damn that's rough
---
He should be banned.
---
You should! This would be amazing
---
The crafting grind is AIDS, which I do inevitably plan on DOING. The fact is it should count mate
---
I don't believe it's been told us exactly how the levels affect the drops. The mods just said they do.

---
According to the wiki:
---
&gt;The player's skill level determines the rewards the player gets when opening the supply crate; high levelled players will get rarer materials, while lower levelled materials become less common the higher the player's level in that skill is. At the highest point, low levelled materials are removed from the drop table. While players with low levels in those skills can get rare materials, the drop rate is very low, but will increase with that skill level. According to Mod Ash, the herb, ore, fish, uncut gem, seed drops and logs are based on the player's Herblore, Mining, Fishing, Crafting, Farming and Woodcutting levels respectively.

Are you referring to the battlestaves? If so, I guess you're not wrong. However problem is I already don't do daily things like that. I'd rather just throw my money at useful 99 capes like construction or crafting.

The differences can be subtle, varying per individual, and most not notice them, but there is recorded evidence that reading accuracy increases with light background dark text.  Part of this is how light reflects off text into it's background, and also partly how a bright screen can dilate the pupil.  I'm not an expert on it by any means, but it's interesting to read up on if you ever have the time!
---
wot if... all the pellet went in a circle _around_ your 'ed?

I guess you just admitted I was right, *to save a miniscule amount of time*.
---
Argue the max rs community and their efficiency game, not the messenger.
---
The ones with ornament kits are kept in pvm, but in pvp the killer gets the original item + the ornament kit as separate drops. Same thing with the black mask. I guess it’s that items that are made with tradable components are dropped
---
Dunno, he said he was training STR so idk. He was regular account as well.

Hey OP, [MMK weighed in on this occurence a few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/470i1e/can_we_address_the_player_harassment_against/d09c009). Looks like you can send a tip to Jagex. Best case they investigate, wost case nothing happens.
---
If you don’t want to get just 72 mining master clues don’t sound like your thing lol

That was me today 😩 2 hours overtime tho, extra membership incoming !

What level of doubling is this?

yeah don't be stingy, take it from me lol

I stopped around 10-11 minutes in.. not a bad idea, but I couldn’t physically handle the “comin in hot”s

Dont worry there fixed in the next video...I heard everyone's complaints

Downgraded.

Never heard cockflute before, that’s quality stuff. Can’t wait to use this one on my friends lol

I was in your same boat. It is required to talk to the girlfriend. I even started the quest and completed part of it but you can’t get to girlfriend without 69 mining and D pickaxes boost.
---
Huh?
---
I'm not trying to used the pic as proof, Im saying I literally have got 5 D picks in 127 kc. Sorry to not meet your high standards of literally taking the time to use snipping tool on every D Pick I get and waste valuable time in the wilderness with a D Pick on the ground.

The defence formula for npcs uses both defence level and the bonus for the specific style (with the exception of magic which uses magic level and magic defence bonus).

Blue dragons have a defence level of 95 compared to black dragons 200

Unless you snag the closest ones they are programmed to hit. Then it logs or world hops the bot. It’s the only realistic thing you can do to bots.

I don't want to be rude, but seems like only one of you guys is actually pulling his weight

If you enjoying leveling up alongside a constant sea of bots by all means wait and level up in f2p

so close!

Same, man. Well, my wording was misleading but I'm Midwest as well. Initially, the ping readings for the worlds are fine, but as soon as I do anything they always spike to 300-500ms. Raiding and pvming has been cancer as of late for me

Took me a day or two of afking sandcrabs to get to 70 from 30ish (quest exp) with bone cbow and leather gear -&gt; green dhide. Not "efficient" to some people, if you care about that, but hey I'd still be level 30 with 0 exp gained if I hadn't afked so it's infinitely efficient in my books.
---
Xp waste
---
Wait until OP finds out his now wife I assume have twins.
---
dude. same.
---
It's a roller-coaster
---
Mate, you can just show me that your other boss kill counts for everything that can drop a Dragon Pick is 0.
---
Are auto clickers bannable?
---
Yeah because they played runescape as if it were a normal game.  Normal games last ~200 hours max before boredom.

I did until 77, then agility

The bitch in the Sara trimmed rune with the maple bow lmao
---
Sure, it’s a lot. It’s also probably below average for the type of player that’s grinding TOB to 1bil. So it’s a moot point.

Here, how about you tell me all the bosses that drop dragon pic and I'll post an image on imgur of all the possible bosses and show you that I literally have 0 kc

Rune ore good money making method? What?

OP’s looks better

There*
---
Sean was just in Chicago for a hot sauce event.
---
tbh man, back in the 2007~ days when i was just a youngin i probably filled over 20k vials of water in fally over my days, more often than not doing trips of 1k+ in a sitting, it's something you really can't just ban across the board. Like, for example what if a new player saw a bunch of bots doing it, and they're like huh i can make money doing this and they just start copying the bots, does he deserve to be banned?
---
Players grinding tob are not even remotely close to the average runescape player.
---
Are mort myre fungus still a decent low lvl money making method?
---
Just google Dragon Pick. Please stop. I'm about to delete my comment so I don't have to read your yikes responses ..

Would you suggest swapping to a bcp and assembler? I'm currently using range cape and ancestral.

I started yesterday ds2, did not had time to finish but oh boys it was fun. And what comes to mm2. I enjoyed the fuck out of it. Was it nostalgic vibes from mm1? Or just fun and nice lore?

Enable gpu rendering. osrs by default runs on 1 core. Laptops are shit at handling 1 core games. gpu rendering will support multicore
---
I was just making a joke. I guess I should have said it first. I figured people would get it though.
---
It’s basically a free 20k gp every hour just off birdnests, plus extra gp from seeds. Pretty worth it in my opinion
---
easy there bud
---
jyes
---
Legend status
---
yeah i was planning on doing that as well, haven't tried it myself yet since I don't think I have the levels to be consistent but from the videos I've seen it looks like 
---
knife &gt; fish &gt; eat &gt; click on the spot 
---
to the same rhythm works you just gotta make sure you have the two fish/roe or whatever first and replace "drop" with clicking on a blank inventory space whenever you don't have fish to eat/cut
---
could be wrong though, give it a try and lemme know if that's wrong :)
---
Upper decker pooper. Nice
---
Not much point having 99 hitpoints if I can't keep it above 0
---
The whole point is to safe bankspace lol. But i guess when you dont have much in there its hard to imagine the nuances huh :) cya
---
But if the lyre is that easy to craft...
---
Then this is simply a QOL change?
---
The skeleton is blazing.
---
Good luck with the herb runs, hopefully they turn out good.
---
OP is right that you should do as many quests and diaries as possible to progress your account. Once you've got all the content unlocked, you've got access to a lot of crazy moneymakers. Demonic Gorillas after MM2 is an underrated one. Even if you don't get lucky on shards you're still looking at 1m per trip. Vorkath and Rune Dragons after DS2 are huge. Obviously there's Zulrah after Regicide as well.
---
Otherwise, just train your slayer up and the money will roll in. Gargoyles, Dust Devils, Smoke Devils...all great money. If you kill bosses for slayer xp eg. Kraken then you're going to make a lot of money that way as well. Mix in your herb runs in between and you're saving far more than you're spending.
---
That wasn't him iirc. I'm pretty sure I've seen a video that interviewed him and gave some type of proof that it was really him in the video I'm talking about, but in the video im talking about it also said the video your talking about was made because his password got leaked on a forum and some guy just got views by logging in and faking being him. I saw it a while ago and can't remember what the vid was called but hopefully someone can back me up.
---
he realized all the time he spent on that he could have mastered about anything he wanted to do in his life.
---
I don’t think people understand there are thousands of people running multiple bots in poor countries with the opportunity to make more than a doctor does in their country . This is their job and they all probably have the determination to find and exploit any possible way to bot and farm gold. I don’t understand the hire more employees mentality, do you know how much time it would take to ban all of these bots manually. You may see a lot of bots and think you can just mass ban them easily but the person running them already has 20 more accounts lined up to ship out and scatter throughout the worlds.
---
“Theoretically speaking”
---
Runescape is labelled as an mmorpg. No mmorpg aims to be that amount of time. That would be a horribly poor amount of content.

Dammit you're right, I should just stick to beating my meat

I see what you did there
---
damn there's a sub community for everything

Switching to p2p is worth it early. Can knock out a bunch of quests in about an hour that get you at least 40 attack
---
good fertiliser there mate. sometimes a body usually a dead dog
---
Huh, something similar happened to me like 2 days ago. I was chatting to people in the GE for a good 20 minutes, then all of a sudden they ask how old my account is. After giving a vague answer they proceed to say shit like "Hans says my account is 4000 days old, what about you?". Instant red flag.

Windows 10 1903 has a sandboxing now, open it up in sandbox. Lol

Most people don't alch to 99 but it's extremely easy to do you don't even need to look at the screen, you can just mindlessly click with one hand while you do whatever else (watching movies etc) you could even click with a wireless mouse while in a different room

A major tech company was doing a Neurodiversity program in my hometown - basically a recruitment drive for people on the spectrum. I was one of 16 people who made it through to the trial (and later, one of the 10 that got the job), and a national news program wanted to cover the program and interview some people. They liked my background story and I ended up being the focus of the segment.
---
It's my all time favorite by a mile. No quest comes close to how well designed it was.
---
Sorry but i dont want to put protect from range/melee on and play an alt at bandos anymore either. Shits too easy and boring

It's not clans, it's the game. Most people care about being as efficient as possible so those events are considered a waste of time.

Only around 700k for all 3 pieces
---
LooniesRS never forgets :)
---
I'm sure Mystic Might did more for him than steel skin lol
---
Raids have a highsr skill celling than most solo bosses. I think thats why most clans seem to focus around them. Speed runs, solos, masses, etc have a lot more variety than grabbing max melee and whiping bandos for 4 hours. Also it tends to be more group oriented content. than dks, slayer bosses, etc
---
ha best part is its printed on a gaylord. we were this close to perfection!

I’d shoot someone so they just send me to jail instead.

I think dupes are allowed; at least some dude posted double ranger boots a week or two ago.

I'd exclusively do smithing just to get the pet.

Lol, no second GE so everyone just stands in Varrock and Prif is dead
---
Just did the same but had to sell all my bank lul
---
Uhm what?
---
So much drama at POH lol
---
I'll take em all!
---
You could just train combat on green dragons and make enough for a bond in a few hours. Could also just use the bones on the wilderness alter and sell the dragon hide for a bond. Either way I suggest killing something that will make you a bond if your wanting to treason combat :) hope your next feels better soon man!

You can do birdhouses starting at 17, idk how you’re doing 1-9 in 1 run.

True. Big ticket items that have been dropping are almost certainly going to shoot back up when this Twitch deal ends, could be a good investment.

Its a pretty profitable alt if you want to invest like 200m into it. Plus deal with all the fuckery.

Bullshit excuse since they filter words anyway, if they wanted to do something about the account name blackmarket they'd just blacklist the text string(s) and force account renaming.

It's actually wild that you keep arguing diff things to me lol

This is efficiency at its finest
---
Probably the blast, because pest control you have to do damage  and you can't do damage with out gaining hit points
---
Blast furnace is about 10k xp/h if i remember correctly, dunno about pest control at that level.

Probably got sick of how much the game consumed his life. The thing is as an achieved hardcore, once dead most of them just quit playing the account all together. Look at every single big steamer and top ranking hcim that’s died. Guy probably knew if he died that’d be his way of just quitting the game for good.

If that’s what it took for him to quit, I’m happy for him.

Yeah I keep getting that, especially when I was a lot lower stats but at the end of the day runecrafting easily got me 30m+ worth of gear and I did 62 Slayer and 75 Range with cannon'ing in a single day. IMO it's very worth it. Oh and 70 prayer!

What the point of the point is the last path he shows is very fucken hard where if you go around it’s really fucken easy I was stuck on it with a friend and a random for 2hrs before switching paths and doing it instantly obviously his path is fucken retarded
---
99 agility so yes it’s true
---
Thanks! :)

Yes the hackers always find a way to have access to our accounts! Thank you for sharing your experience
---
To make it harder for random people to notice the pattern.  It increases by 4 unless it crosses the 100 mark, in which case it increases by 3.
---
You're probably going to be buying and reselling gear (especially more niche slayer boss gear) as needed.
---
Sell SGS and Bludgeon. Buy DWH and D pick.
---
Consider Lance - Its really useful in CoX (olm melee hand, vasa crystal, can put it on crush for tekton), can use at rune drags or melee vork (things to do outside of raids if you're on and friends aren't) Hell you can use it for dragon slay tasks. 
---
You seem fixated on ACB. You don't need it. IF you must have a crossbow (which they aren't that useful lol) just get a dragon cbow so you can use dragon bolts. The increase in dps from not dragon bolts to dragon bolts is much much larger than rcb -&gt; acb. 
---
If you don't get a lance, you'll want a hasta or abby dagger for CoX (if your team does vasa ever). 
---
If you're ever strapped for cash and are close to buying a good upgrade, sell ahrims/eternals/torm. I'm semi surprised you keep all this mage gear but don't do raids/zulrah. Its tying up a bit of gp you could use elsewhere. Then again if you're slaying a lot you probably just keep it for metal dragon tasks? 
---
Make sure trident is toxic trident. 
---
If you get into ToB - You'll want DWH and Claws. Elite void. Chally is nice to have along side claws. 
---
I feel like im missing mentioning something...ah well.
---
I know this community has it’s all good and bads but high level ironmen and pure clan pkers seem to attract the most racists 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yeah also because there’s no TB and entangles are weak.

bruh melee's sick wym

its like osrs compared to rs3 tbh LOL

That defence tag doing work

RL GPU rendering is broken for me on newer graphics drivers. Probably a different issue than you, but it would sometimes produce surreal graphics. Walls having blank white textures, player models being replaced with trees, and other weird stuff.
---
I'm Midwest, too, and haven't been able to do raids or Hydra lately. I sit there getting pounded by crystals at Olm. Or, when I try to switch prayers, Hydra is already going back to ranged by the time it finally switches my overhead to mage. Figured my internet has just been bad lately, but maybe not?
---
Thanks man, any other goals?
---
I just started it after F2P. Honestly been enjoying it a fair bit
---
nudes.jpg.exe
---
So glad I’m not the only one. Completely ruined the immersion and flow of the quest for me. First 3/4 I thought were amazing. The final 1/4 with the agility, halves etc was tedious and boring
---
Ha! Thats for a girl you doofus!
---
Becaise I feel it gives the ring way too much versatility. Also if it were 5 times a day most players would never need a dramen staff nor the elite again, since 5 fairy ring travels a day is plenty.
---
Also, there should be no correlation between the quest and the diary since they are two completely separate things.
---
You eat to continue the cycle, cutting fish just doesn’t interrupt it so it’s a way to get rid of the fish and get more food to eat. You can maintain a 3t cycle with purple sweets and dropping the fish (although there’s no reason to do that)
---
Send me link I want that shirt now
---
Is that 200 dry in your name? Or 200 without splits? (Obviously in your name if you solo)
---
Current dry streaks for me right now is...

1020 WT kc no pet

300+ abyssal sire kills of an unsired
---
250k+ fishing experience just hunting the big bass (big net fishing
---
~250 Zulrah kills without a unique aside from crystal seeds

He was banned during his rampage, doubt he made bank trips. He did trade the phats he pked to a friend who scammed him lol

Thank you, you doing my part.

Pretty insane. Especially considering how rare it is from ham members lol.
---
Name it Greg 😬
---
Happened to me earlier, just click login again
---
Thats like saying I know roughly how much a scythe/twisted bow is even though I haven’t bought one. It’s really not far fetched at all, most players that pay attention will know
---
200 without splits/in my name.
---
I agree with the last sentiment, but for that to apply the elite reward needs moved to FTP3.
---
The idea is for this to be an alternative to the dramen staff, but it's very obviously not an alternative to the elite reward.
---
Ultimately, this still takes up a slot. You still have to remember to carry it. The main difference is that it's a more convenient slot, rather than the weapon slot.
---
The Elite does not take up a slot, which no matter which slot that is is a huge improvement. Plus, there's no requirement to be carrying anything, which is a colossal convenience over any alternative.
---
If you want best points its not really afk. You have to change styles/put on ice gloves sometimes etc.
---
But its 1mil+points/hr.
---
That’s a weird title for a show
---
Reported
---
'a recruitment drive' , I see what you did there
---
That’s awful. The longest I’ve gone without a split was 39 raids. Then 19. Only 411 CoX kc atm though

you're just going to 69 right? it's an ez boost for making friends with my arm with a dragon pick

Can't speak for the latter, but for people on the spectrum we're often engaged by repetitive/mundane tasks when neurotypical people wouldn't be, and seeing as Runescape is about how many hundreds of hours you can spend doing the same thing, it's not surprising there's a big overlap between ASD and Runescape.

I asked for the executable from OP and it was a zero byte file, scanned in virustotal and got confused when it said it was related to all types of different malware yet had zero detections, turns out it's the same exact hash for every single file that doesn't have content inside of it.

So in conclusion, the person who messaged OP didn't legitimately have malicious intent but was most likely joking around and or trying to scare people.

Sorry, maybe I miss understood but 100 mill feathers for how much each? As you said "3.3m each"

hey girl can i seriously have a hit off of your toes my addiction is causing me to have massive withdrawal and I genuinely think i'm going to pass out if I can't get a hit. It can be a quick slurp I promise you it's only one, girl please i'm begging you. I'm actually having a breakdown over this, last night I was shaking uncontrollably due to how MASSIVE my toe addiction has gotten. Please for the love of god just one SUCK.

Did that with my last iron man 2076 total .... here i am 1 year and a half later with a new iron and 1980 total lvls ... it will for sure help him quit but he maybe will regret it like i did lol

Shoulda photoshopped a logout button under his hand

All they asked of him is One Small Favour.

And what happens if you go over a certain combat level, can you not kill people if there is too big of a level gap?
---
This is an idea I made and I'm just curious how the community thinks about it.
---
This is a form of modern art.
---
you can check out why on combat level calc
---
Warframe is fun wtf
---
Bis is serp+salve ammy even on slayer task.
---
Yes. The further north you go in the wilderness increases that gap above and below your cb lv.
---

F E E T
---
you can't attack at all.   
---
In pvp worlds you can fight with people 15 combat levels in your range. In wilderness this range dependa on how far you go, the level of wilderness you're in is the range. People usually fight people close to their combat level if they can choose anyways.
---
Different pk builds will have different stats they'll want.
---
Other than that, to stay within a certain combat bracket, or in specific cases to literally stay at a specific combat level.
---
Niceeee!
---
mota kasi
---
I get your point, but I think this isn't the right way to go.
---
Sparc Mac has 50k+ more yt subs than a friend and is currently the biggest osrs yt channel in term of subs, hes also the second biggest osrs twitch streamer in terms of subs. You can tell anyone involved in this argument is shitting out of their mouths as sparc isnt mentioned once
---
"Largest" might've conveyed that better w/o confusion.
---
Great
---
In the wilderness, each wilderness level you go to is the +/- levels you can fight. At level 20 wild someone with combat level 70 can attack anyone from 50-90 combat level. Keeping your combat level low while having high offensive stats (like strength) means you will have a distinctly higher damage output than those in your combat bracket. In PVP worlds there are level brackets but im not sure what the +/- is, same idea applies though. Pures generally refer to players who maintain 1 defence to focus solely on offensive stats or '1 defence pures', the term is thrown onto a lot of builds though. Also, pures are gay.
---
Holy shit tag your fcking spoilers

I don't like that, but some match ups force me to, I prefer good wave control and farming under tower which works well on some bully lanes where their kit force them to push

Ur either lying or ur unintentionally clueless, but u def didnt 'just buy a bond', u bought more than just that
---
Why does it matter what other skills xp rates are? I can get 1m+ xp/hour fletching darts but that's irrelevant to Hunter. 
---
Also the 58/60 minutes afk is a downside not a good thing. If it was a good method you would want to do it 100% of the time not only once an hour.
---
The last flight i was on it was free
---
It isn’t worth it if you singles pk. Stay 1 def if that’s your primary pk style. 
---
13 def is basically a useless build since the slayer helm update which made black mask drop on deaths instead of slayer helm staying as an untradeable. 
---
If you clan pking 13 def wouldn’t be that big of a deal. But once you’re singles pking those 3 extra combat levels will actually matter.
---
Just do like 20 minutes of wintertodt and you can solve one of those problems for a long time
---
Probably would've been funnier with something low-mid level like 23 or something
---
I find it more interesting that the results came back pretty normal and the weirdest one is "Cutting Firewood"
---
Seems the translations are more literal descriptions than names
---
Do 75 atk 77 pray 70-75 def.
---
Not if you hate it : ^ )
---
Yeah you're right on track. It's a tiny bit faster if you prioritise attack and strength over defence, but you'll need defence to hit the combat req for chaeldar
---
Keep doing what you're doing, making sure you have the important gear upgrades like Rune Boots, Glory and Combat Brace. Warrior ring and zerker helm are cheap too for a good damage boost. 
---
Black make is the most important though, get that ASAP
---
That would be amazing.  I'm saving up for tickets at the moment hoping to afford it.  Thank you so much!

The feasibility isn't the question. It's a cost-benefit analysis. I'm sure you'll find that most companies can feasibly give away this or that for one reason or another. The more important thing is to find a good reason to give the thing out in the first place that is likely to somehow earn them back even more money in the long run.
---
Without sitting here and going back and forth all morning over what-ifs, I'd say that it likely isn't a good financial investment for Jagex in neither the short term nor the long term.
---
Damn, just missed a golden opportunity

I got the fruit tree seed last night too 😪

Rune with pray mage is better. He has 99 mage, if he uses dhide he either takes massive melee or ranged damage
---
I will leave my shame out there for all to see.
---
What? All of your questions were answered by the one clip.

Less weight for a good form next time!

He needed a cosmic rune for that.
---
Your slayer helm and ornament + the item is lost upon death if its your 4/5th item in the prot list.
---
Untradebles such as void/fcape/imbued magic cape are kept on death under lvl 20.
---
I think they are referring to the no runecrafting skill.
---
No, forcespawn dharok in one of the corner rooms or side tunnels and safespot him. No ppots needed
---
So you would rather spend 30-50 hours in game doing extremely tedious money making methods instead of just use an hour of work irl (assuming you have a job, if not mow a lawn)?
---
There aren't any great ways for new players to make that sort of cash in f2p anymore.

Hate questing, a lot of other stuff is more fun

Cannon as much as you can. I like doing wildy slayer myself as they are basically all cannonable. (That said I'm 1 defense so I don't have the best task masters outside of wild)

---
Yeah because they are alching...
---
It's also possible they aren't bots since it's super easy to alch without paying any attention (mousekeys for example).
---
Slayer is slow by nature. 
---
Prioritize burst and cannonable tasks and use bracelets of slaughter to extend tasks that are good xp. Use expeditious bracelets to get through bad tasks fast.
---
Homeslice looks like he escaped from Banjo Kazooie
---
Tele-grabbing nature runes because killing ogresses gives excess law runes but not even nature runes, so the most efficent way for f2p ironmen to train smithing is to tele-grab the nature runes in the Wilderness and use them to cast super-heat for smithing training.
---
Exactly
---
Oi oi oi

To add to this, instead of tele out just log out if the 2nd  form isnt to your liking and just log back in and youll be right next to the boat again

It's surprisingly small, even for the most popular game in the world - league of legends - the NA server has far less players than even Turkey or EUW/EUNE servers, and even those have way, way less players than China and Korea. Like a gigantic majority of players are from the east.

I heard in China in terms of BR they preferred pubg over fortnite for the most part, and even still, the mobile versions of both because mobile gaming is more massively widespread over there too.

Brew/restore/SCP, pray magic/piety, go down and kill Supreme as quickly as possible. If you're using SotD, it's a good time to spec if Rex gets on you. Then, continue praying magic and kill Rex via the safespot. Finally, kill Prime and restart the cycle.

You would know, of course.

I got 4 combat 3 combat 99’s
---
Independent extreme btw
---
3.
---
No it's going on the GE.
---
get a better bday suit then
---
1 step closer to your account :&lt;)
---
orange arrows to the left
---
Oh that is a fact. Condoms reduce the sensitivity by alot, so obviously you last alot longer. 
---
I personally dont use condoms with my girlfriend, as we both absolutely hate how they feel. We used the pullout method for about 5 years with no issue after doing some research on it. When we decided to have a child, she became pregnant immediately, so clearly our organs work as they're supposed to. 
---
Obviously the pullout method is awful in a lot of scenarios, its just not this evil awful thing that doesnt work at all, that some people paint it like. If you wish to avoid STD's its probably best to stick to condoms.
---
I'm down, I want to raid more but the clans fill up so fast. Not maxed but have a few kc under my belt.
---
Next you're gonna be suggesting we add a Stam pot bridge with the GE on it and dark wizards everywhere
---
But there's an easier safespot on the other side of the room, by the entrance :/
---
Wasn't aware the helmet justified an LOL?
---
high bulk illegal trading? you didn't need to try to sound smart lol you could have just said RWT.
---
Thanks man! Stick with it! For awhile I wasn't sure I was ever going to get past the waves.
---
Thanks for the reminder
---
Where everybody judges each other.
---
Sand crabs.
---
Be sure to turn off MSAA in your driver settings. The MSAA in runelite likes to conflict with the Built in graphics MSAA
---
Turn off MSAA in your driver settings for your graphics card.
---
Interface setup will take awhile, be ready for that. People diss the interface but it’s really one of the most customizable ones in any games. Everything’s moveable and resizeable they just plop it all in front of you in the beginning. 
---
Oh and read the quest dialogues. Happy question :)
---
What's UIM then?
---
Team Paradox cc :D
---
Not really. High bulk is the only way you would get that rate , and the illegal part was to emphasize between bonds because general context against rwt being vague to some. Don't be dick kid
---
Looooool!!!!
---
I may be mistaken but I believe it was originally P2P only but then F2P was added later.
---
My main man lucien house be there. I do not condone the excavation of his property.
---
Im member since 2013
---
I am in some small cc but people do not really talk. They do raids but not often I guess. I would be up for starting a small cc or something with you. That might be the best way to get a small raids group.
---
Tbows do not have real wprld value.
---
It's the Ourania Altar, ZMI is just a shorter name for it.
---
Eh I'm still a pretty poor noob and 70 herblore wasn't too expensive, think it only cost me like 3mil-ish?
---
OSRS can be both F2P and Members.  
---
   
---
F2P Players get less skills they can level up, less quests to do, and less methods to level up their skills. Overall, just less content. Being a F2P is a good primer into understanding what the game is. Though keep in mind that F2P has tons of bots and beggars.   
---
Member Players get everything of course. The game is more fun and more efficient to be a member right off the bat, but of course there's the cost to be a member. 
---
Since you've already gotten the membership, I'd recommend just paying for it, if possible, to enjoy the game to the most. But if you're not sure or can't keep paying, I'd recommend leveling up skills efficiently through membership while you can.
---
Is your connection dropping? Only other cause of your issue I can think of
---
Enjoy bud
---
The problem is if you log into a combat situation, would probably die before puting pin on.
---
She definitely squats
---
Move falador to the ge
---
How do you get the hp/prayer bars on the side of inventory? I have runelite, but no clue how to enable them
---
Yo dude! Good on you for taking a moment to get away from the meme and address the real life issue here outside of OSRS. I find that out of context our sub can be seen as insensitive and childish but I always hope that that is not the whole picture.
---
I'm a special Ed teacher in the States and a long time player. It's very nice to see people in this community be able to talk about it openly and responsibly!
---
Thank you.
---
So, whats the account differences. Not going to be impressed if hes 60cb and your 126?
---
which is why he said blame jagex....
---
Not worth in any scenario really, pushing it to 20 for mystic can be ok for tribrid but at that point you might as well get 40, and at 40 you might as well go to meta med level.
---
you'd be a bit weak on the baby pure bracket cause your prayer is higher than most pures of that bracket, but its not cripplling
---
Right now I'm making a pure that can pk in total level worlds. Playing efficiently is boring, but it's the only way I can see to build this specific account in a timely manner. 
---
On the flip side, my main is 125 with 1860+ total and I can just play raids for fun. But then you have those efficient players there too that freak out if you're 1 tick off on the olm fight. Or take too long to complete the raid.
---
the fact you commented twice makes me believe you don't know what you are doing...therefore I say your drops are legit
---
I'm trying really hard to commit to learning and not care so much about what wave I get to, but it is sorta demoralizing haha.
---
Honestly I wouldnt even fight them at all without the antifire potions. Do you not have enough points to skip them?
---
I would definitely do that on any account. No worries there.
---
100%, ,I neglected the 0xp methods because there is often better ways to do them later on when your account is better and maybe you have some diaries.
---
Complete diarys, get all hard and then focus elite steps 1 by 1 thats what im doing mostly
---
Not the cost buddy its the principal
---
being honest, i used to host a lot in the past and i havent done much recently but i have been coming back. to put into perspective, its peaceful inside the house, but it's a warzone at the portal with the ADV's. every host is trying to have as many adv as possible to get people in. competition is fierce. 
---
even if i was there for hours, i would need to be there wayyyyyy longer in the hopes that the first person who has all the people closes and the people are sent to other hosts, and pray they come to my house. 
---
sometimes its worth it in fact. i remember making 13m in just one hour once. but some days like 2m only but im still grateful!
---
Nah I already skipped em, just curious if there were ways to make it better.  Especially cuz my next task was steel dragons and I said fuck that too.
---
I disagree, I think the discussion is about how *efficiently* make money on lower levels
---
RC fun
---
volume and consistency maybe but jakeyosaurus' season 1 'taking noob' series is the best osrs shit i've ever seen
---
Because lms is f2p
---
:)
---
Stop making me feel things.
---
you’ve got a point lol, shit was pretty funny.
---
You'd be surprised. I've gotten my med-level friends into alting and they love it. Maybe base 50s is a bit early, but not by much. Once they get to dust devils, having an alt to just alch+bank drops is almost 0 time to make and really good difference in xp/gp. That's how I got two of my friends started.
---
i am 99 in the creation of runes
---
Honestly I'd support this because I LOVE the party room, and i only ever see drop parties at the GE these days. Giving those GE people a place to host their drop party literally directly next to where they would be hosting it anyways sounds like a great idea to me! 
---
I just fear for lag...
---
Wait there's people who hate BA?
---
I’m an Ironman, and I don’t have the herblore to make antifire potions, nor access to the GE to buy them.  I was just going with what the wiki said which is “If they are fought without complete dragonfire protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use Protect from Melee, to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken.”
---
So many of my old rs friends will never log on again :/ but I’ll keep them added god damn it!
---
Good idea, though I think the only way to convince players that it's not a 100% accurate replica of Summoning would be to give it another name.
---
Is it a waste of time to train range with a rune c bow while doing slayer? 78 range
---
Other than that example and maybe a couple of other scenarios I welcome anyone to come up next to me and skill / slay and enjoy runescape with me!
---
It's not that bad, now days you can just chop some oaks and kill some hill giants for pretty quick money.
---
Anyone know the requirements for the new upcoming quest Song of the Elves?
---
Part of the early experience is poverty. Actually, the first grind I remember personally was picking bananas so I could buy a steel longsword from the sword shop. I also remember how excited I was to get a good bar from goblin diplomacy.
---
You can't say the very beginning isn't fundamentally changed by drowning it in cash. At least they should earn it by doing the stronghold of security, which is kind of an adventure.
---
Yes. If you want to do range slayer without a blowpipe the second best option is magic shortbow(i)
---
sweaty muscular female... thats every no life weebs fetish.
---
It's 1t before the chatbox message that you can click. It's the tick where the spawn gets to it's final tile and stays still 1t
---
I think you're conflating the magical fresh noob time with the early game where you're still getting your bearings.
---
We went to the same primary and secondary school. I had to double check with someone else that I wasn't going crazy recognising you.

---
My worst was 18k earth warriors, and you?
---
That's decent for xp but not really for points
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_Elves
---
Requirements are on this page, stats are not boostable I believe.
---
I got work at 5-10 today, I already know they are going to say “can you stay till close”. No I can’t, I’m a student, osrs time is precious.
---
You can do this how the hell they gunna know anyway
---
I highly doubt it's possible too.
---
I've used dragon darts on my pure with 99 ranged, on slayer task, with eagle eye, and only managed it twice out of five attempts.
---
I mean unless rigour alone beats eagle eye and slayer helm combo but I doubt it.
---
The only way that I have been able to consistently out DPS healers is with tbow though I've not tried it off task. My buddy who has 99 ranged and rigour has done it off task and said it was pretty easy.
---
I'd guess that with rigour and 88+ ranged you could out DPS off task with a tbow maybe even a bp if you get lucky with hits.
---
V-daddy with rcb is fun as fuck. I just finished a whole blue drag task there on my iron.
---
Cut your hand off. Get mechanical prosthetic
---
It's a bot you won't get banned for
---
I want the kite shield but 200 clues later I still don't have one...
---
Very nice account, now for some numbers!
---
50 to 90 firemaking all at Wintertodt is only between 1/6 and 1/7 chance for a Phoenix pet. Definitely lucky there.
---
When cannoning everything, the ranged exp you get assuming you get a scroll after 5,000 kc is ~3.5M, so I'm assuming you got slightly unlucky with one or a few of the higher HP NPCs, which is why you're close to 6M ranged exp (could also be totally unrelated).
---
I don’t think this will have the respond you’re hoping for...
---
Agility gotta be the worst especially after I already have graceful so there’s nothing left but damn werewolf course
---
It would depend a lot on whether you used afk skilling methods or tick manipulation. I'd guess around 3 years, less if you were super efficient.
---
Start: 1 def pure builds
---
Build #1: Obby mauler - 1 attack, 60+ strength, \~50 ranged
---
Build #2: Gmaul pure - 50 attack, 60+ strength, \~70 ranged
---
Build #3: Low level brid - 50/60 attack, 70+ strength, 85+ ranged and mage
---
Next: 10-20 def build (slayer helm/mystic pure)
---
Same as low level brid but use a slayer helm +1, or proselyte/mystics
---
Then you're pretty much at zerker once there's 45 defence and torso
---
It’s not customizable. I want to see regular swears but no racist shit. Filter is useless.
---
I left my most hated skills for last. So if anything I felt relief instead of happiness.
---
QUESTS QUESTS QUESTS. DAIRIES DAIRIES DARIES
---
Do you know a better and simple program to compile images into one?
---
Yeah, and?
---
I would love some kind of upgrade that makes it into either a fully defensive cape or a crush cape.
---
How much Agility xp do i get from 1 brimhaven ticket at level 96?
---
Its probably being driven by a computer.
---
Filter is a blanket on all swears. I’m adult enough that I wanna see “fuck” and don’t think racial slurs are funny.
---
Something I created myself
---
It depends a lot how efficiently you use those 2 hours a day honestly. There’s a lot of variation in xp rates that directly correlate to effort and methods used. At an absolute minimum it’s calculated to be 1500 hours for max total level, but thats assume you use at least one alt to make money and sometimes to help with slayer. Look at crystalmathlabs if you want the breakdown for optimal rates for each skill at different points. For the average player it’ll probably be more like 2000-2500 hours, depending on how much you spend bossing for money, or pking/minigames for fun.

Holy shit I never noticed it. I was always running to the farming guild bank. RIP.

Black mask, the black mask and slayer helm are essentially the same thing, it’s just that the slayer helm provides protection against monsters like abby spectres and dust devils

My husband drew most of it, because I do not have any drawing skills whatsoever. However, I helped decide what to draw and handed him the colours because he’s colour blind.

This thread is for asking other players questions. You can ask the Jagex Moderators questions in the weekly Q&amp;A, which should pop up Wednesday/Thursday in time for the Q&amp;A on Thursday evening.

But if I use a mouse key for sticky shift, then click the other key for dropping the item, that makes it 1:1. Is that okay?

Well... they do have minds. Just no bloods so are they really even human?

Looking at their points he needs them lol

Lol that was my first 99 like 15 years ago congrats!

It's a case of earning the money then.
---
Find which task you do the most and work towards the optimal (or close to optimal) gear. Then, earn money through that and try to work towards other gear.

If you're flip-flopping between the two, then you need to decide which is the priority.

You won’t be making a shit ton of money fast at all at the beginning, especially in f2p. You’re better off spending your time leveling your skills up and learning the game mechanics during your time in f2p.  If you really want membership asap just use the twitch prime free month if it’s still available or download the mobile app and use the one week free trial it gives you.

It's definitely worth it.

Would be nice for mlm

If I was bored and a hard-core hacker I bet I could find your account by looking at all ironmen with 14 hard clues done and comparing it with the hitpoint and prayer level, get hacked ez kid

There is something to be said about using broad bolts instead as they're very very cheap.
---
Move mole to blue dragons.
---
Yea 1:1 is okay. Dont try to do anything that might be crossing that. You will get banned instantly
---
1. Switch to high pop worlds for quests and non competitive skills.
---
2. The game has massive design issues that were just the result of naiveté in the early 2000s. It has a certain charm, but it's broken
---
what's the optimal route fighting vorkath with fremmy elite ? I'm about to finish it up, and right now my route is going  house for the pool &gt; lunar isle tp &gt; bank &gt; get kicked out of the island.
---
so with this in mind, how optimal is it with fremmy elite ?
---
clan vs clan

I'd be the former, haven't seen sgt on in a few years. Always see ex members coming and going though.

I did mort myre fungy but i got 300k/h...
---
With 80 magic and range with med level gear would I be able to kill zulrah regularly for profit?
---
congration
---
The joke was because Runecrafting is 1 and Herblore is 2 so slayer would be 99 because “HAHAHA isn’t slayer ALL PvMers do???!! Amirite guys haha haha it’s so funnny!!!!!”
---
“Aw shit! We can’t access the party room! Guess that means we aren’t paying for subscription anymore!...oh wait, we don’t pay anyway”

The accomplishment is having a 1rc pure.  He had the good sense to not taint his account

It was. The world 1 trading area was varrock west bank and surrounding area
---
I'm mining gem rocks in underground shilo trying to get pet. I have 99 mine, and dragon pickaxe. People come in and mine 2 ticks max on each rock, meanwhile I sometimes take 15 ticks for a rock and it takes much longer for me. Wtf am I doing wrong? I wear full prospector, mining cape, and dragon pick.
---
Good lucking data!

Basically confirms what we already know - its ranger boots or bust

what armour should i use for mole?

wooosh

I accumulated a nice chart of the drops our clan achieved over the month of March while running a competitive PvM League for the clan.  
---
I thought it was a pretty cool chart at the end of it so I wanted to share it.
---
The colours represent the first player to get the drop (and subsequently a points bonus in the league)
---
The censored part is the names of those players.  
---
I'd be keen to show you some more of how our league works if anyone's interested, I have good fun running it and it's a great activity for the clan.
---
So glad I've finally saved enough for a Twisted Bow!!
---
Aaaand it's gone.
---
that sounds like a dream, i literally have no IRLS who play osrs, only person who still occasionally plays is the one who got me into osrs a few years back, but thats once in a blue moon, cherish that shit dude.
---
Who would have thought that this community would be wholesome.
---
At least isn't the regular wholesomeness of reddit "man that couldn't afford insulin donates kidney to his wife that couldn't afford a new organ and dies"
---
Literally had no idea this was a feature the first few months I was back into the game. It's such a hidden feature; I used to only go to the quest tab to do...quests..??.. I doubt genuine F2P players will have a greater intention than that.
---
You don't have to do nmz/kraken either, ammonite crabs work too
---
I agree. Pre GE, Fally was the HUB of all trade. Fally was the GE.. so to speak. It was fairly organized. If you had specific things like Rune armour, arrows, runes, Glories, Dchain, barrows, potions, herbs, sharks, holiday rares.... there was a designated spot where people were buying and selling. Weather it was outside the bank, or somewhere in the park, or by the fountain.... there was a designated spot.       
---
    
---
Varrock West didn't really... there was hella fucking people, but it was just a shit show flurry of spam.       
---
      
---
I will say though, there were others spots on W2 that were good for trade. Camelot bank was good for bow strings, and fletching type goods.... and Cathrybye was good for fish and misc. food.... Varrock East for Pure essence.... Edgeville for misc. pking items...    
---
          
---
        
---
Can't remember many more spots.... but I'm sure there were more. You could also go to a less popular bank like Ardougne south, or Yanille, and there would be maybe 50-100 people trading misc. things.     
---
     
---
If you needed something very specific... like say an addy warhammer or some random shit.... you'd have to hop from bank to bank... and post up spamming what you want.. or hope you find someone selling.     
---
The old concept of player to player free trade is something I miss about RS. The GE is fantastic too....  but with price manipulation and trading clans.. I almost prefer the old way.
---
Effective Hours Played, as I said, is 144, it doesn't include downtime by definition. But irl, it is 58 minutes to do whatever you want to your Hearst desire, making it AFK.

A bowl of paint chips

Can anyone explain this one please?

He’s named Karil the “Tainted” for a reason...
---
Thanks for the chuckle! I like it
---
I get the point but this looks god awful, consider a different format.
---
I would vote yes on a poll, it would lure the shitty annoying beggers there instead of ge as much. great Idea man
---
Pretty shit joke tbh
---
EHP to max is about 1500 hours. This assumes you use the maximum efficiency training methods all the time, and basically requires you to either have an alt funding your account or to buy a ton of bonds.
---
On a fresh account, assuming you avoid the ultra-sweaty training methods, don’t have an alt, and don’t spend a ton of time doing stuff that doesn’t progress your account, I’d say you’re probably looking at 3000-3500 hours. So at 2 hours per day that’d be 5 years or so.
---
You say getting as if it’s ever been any different.
---
👏👏 you learned something in school and decided to use it for runescape...go buy a cake for yourself young man
---
Black demons are one of my favorites for straight melee training - snag a task of 250 from duradel, head to the catacombs with prayer gear, only have to click like every 5-10 mins to refresh pots, pray, and aggro. Low def, high hp. Whole task probably takes like 2 hours and you don't have to do a thing.
---
Bloodveld in the catacombs would be another ideal task. Hellhounds too.
---
Nice suggestion but move it next to the GE on stampot sink bridge instead
---
ive finished dragon slayer 1 a long time ago. Is it worth safe spting them?
---
penta drop in one chest from barrows? :o
---
Ty
---
Seconded. Almost always breaks even, usually light profits, really solid xp. Bonus is that they're a fairly common slayer task.
---
The title says "me and my cousin have been griding..." on the first line. Jeez...
---
You're beautiful and so is your sense of humor.
---
wasnt aware you couldnt pick up items in ba when did that happen?
---
Only ever done 1 task from this chad for a diary requirement. To bad Swamletics couldn’t use him at least.
---
Fair enough, just seems to be an odd way of defining it. Splashing is almost infinite xp/hr in that regard
---
Wait what black demons are in catacombs? Oof. I went to chasm of fire...
---
They are so cheap these days, I remember them being one of the most coveted shields back in 2007scape :(
---
I don’t have an issue with selling my gear. I can’t afford max gear for everything, but my bank is large enough that I can usually liquidate gear that I’m not currently using to get near max gear for whatever I want to go do.
---
Coldfingers is an absolute legend. An absolute madlad how long hes in the boneyard

I had to add an extra listing when someone got double magic fang at Zulrah, that one surprised me!

I'm not exactly sure how, but I feel like this would instantly turn into a scamming den

Looks like RSC textures iirc
---
Support! This would actually encourage its use, considering how many people are chilling at the GE.
---
World 2!
---
Not sure if that was supposed to be looking or lucking lol but thanks either way!
---
For medium clues it basically is rangers or bust, but because I was able to complete the Masters, even without rangers I would've profited but only barely and not enough to justify 15hrs lol
---
Is that a bad thing?
---
It was 99 hunter, but thanks anyways.
---
And not another soul in the bank to share it with :(
---
Gratz!
---
Is I smart now?
---
Use an item on them when you are right clicking next time so that we can see more names. Right now your screenshot is probably missing a ton of the farm

Hey man, forgive me for my ignorance on the autism spectrum, but you seem to be communicating pretty well. 
---
If you didn’t tell us you were on the spectrum I would never have thought you were, based on how sociable you come across in your comments. 
---
Is this something that you’ve had to develop gradually over time, or does ASD affect you in other ways? Or am I completely simplifying it altogether? 
---
Also, do you mind elaborating on the “different ability” your ASD gives you?

This is said by people that think playing 2007scape at rank 43 HCIM is a part of any healthy persons life. Do people in all different walks of life play 2007scape semi-efficiently? Yeah sure. Would every single one of them be better off not playing? Yep. When rank chasing, and playing this much, it is literally a game about grinds, not excitement, entertainment or fun. Pretending otherwise is naive. People who play it, like me, use it to soak up excessive amounts of free time. Disagree? You're either a noob who doesn't grind or lying. 
---
Note: noobs can enjoy the game, I'm not saying they can't, they can spend 3 hours spread over a week doing shield of arrav with a mate and enjoy it. But people who are chasing ranks on the highscores need to sink excessive amounts of time into it - to the point it heavily affects your life. Source: I died as rank 42 HCIM

Isn’t full dragon more expensive than bandos? He’s probably pretty rich
---
Imagine if they actually did stuff like this. We get angry when they add a dock to draynor.. not to mention stuff like this
---
Yes I realize. No idea how your mind instantly jumps to "incest xd" by reading that.
---
Waterfall will  get you some great early combat xp (though be careful it's easy to die with low hp if you are new). The cold war series are great fun, though the rewards aren't so great
---
A password?
---
I'll get my main goblin boy
---
I’m definitely going to get a ring when I can afford it
---
Ill quit if I get hacked for my bank lol
---
wows popularity decline has nothing to do with the levelling process and still has more players than all the other mmos combined so yes I guess you can whine about it and jerk yourself off over how hard you can autism grind
---
I always went to Varrock world 1
---
The price of snapdragon seeds dropped the herbs stayed the same but sold immediately everytime
---
Bingo
---
Why
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Still grinding QPC, never did get my dragon defender despite burning 1.5k tokens (I don’t know what’s average and I’m not too worried about it, dungeon cyclops aren’t too bad), 8 quests to go now, did Regicide, Roving Elves, and MEP1 this morning, waiting until I get home to do MEP2, seems a lot easier than doing it on mobile
---
I'm gonna suggest something stupid.
---
Scatter those "pricing experts" across the f2p world and have them be the GE-equivalent places to sell goods for their respective fields and misc items, and use any bank as a collection spot. Would mean more walking for people trying to unload inventories of different types of items, but could encourage regional trade hubs for people wanting to sell sooner than making the walk.
---
Ex: Farid Morrisane could be stationed outside the bank in Al Kharid. Here, players can sell ores/bars and misc items. Here, players can place orders on any other items. Should sales go through, cash/items can be collected from him or banks like it is now.
---
My dumb idea for the day.

It was never a problem before it was moved to Fally.
---
It's only gielinors moon in rs3, nothing references this in osrs directly
---
Enough to pound his booty?
---
Holy fuck I can't breathe
---
Maybe 25-30 depending on which tasks and quantities
---
I do for my raid/slayer gear. I don't when I'm doing farm runs.
---
I’m bringing my willow LONGbow and coif!

Where are the titties?

Only real bwanas remember his pre g/e house

13 def is as useless as 4

Really sucks that people always prey on the gullible in this game.
---
Tell you what mate, I recently hit it big at the duel arena and made 7b. I'll give you 1b since I feel bad for you. Just trade me your valuables first so I know you're a good guy.
---
Please respond.

Sell MacBook, buy PC with money, play game better.

This guy knows
---
Yes. Obviously way less efficiently than someone with max stats and gear, but zulrah is one of the top money makers available at any point in your account basically.
---
Awesome!
---
When you have to log in to your rs account 3-6 times to change anything some people say fuck it. Having said that I got 2fa'd out of my skull after getting hacked for bank :-)
---
Range voiders a pretty op imo. Also easy to use.
---
Own a blowpipe for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my POH. "What the dustdevil?" As I grab my slayer helm and blowpipe. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot back in lumby. Draw my dds on the second man, miss him entirely because it's thrugo and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with balls, "Cor blimey mate" the cannon shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix dds and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the guards to arrive since triangular dds wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.

I can tell you're a very well adjusted individual.

Audiobooks are GOAT when training non-afk but super mind numbing skills like agility.

I used this YT channel to find a bunch of interesting audio books for free

Wait, they removed that??

Overdone

Calling stronghold an adventure is using the word “adventure” very loosely. at that level it’s “be pelted by annoying questions while running for your life”
---
I like calculating odds so I can multiply the xp/kc I need by 10 before I can start expecting a pet.
---
If your getting hit by magic while he is in green form then it sounds like your having trouble with jad phase, it's the only time it uses mage. the only unavoidable damage should be snaklings and mage phase range attacks. I hope some of this helps and doesn't come across the wrong way :)
---
I am no longer an ultimate Ironman, in an independent Supreme!
---
I did acid last year. About 240ug. Maybe I didnt get full blown hallucinations, but there was a picture of a sunflower field in the house, and those fucking flowers were absolutely blowing side to side in a synchronized dance. I tried changing a song on my phone from spotify and the whole screen kept moving around and it was extremely difficult to hit the "shuffle play" button.  Ive played WoW years ago on acid and just took flight paths around everywhere, listening to the music. I had it hooked up to my TV so it was a big screen with surround sound. Goddamn that was beautiful. Until I was in Orgrimmar and told the chat I was on acid, and someone told me "get a job". Ruined my vibe and I logged off to do something else.

Bad bot
---
Looks like I need to spend more time at hill giants lmao
---
Awesome! thanks I'll look into 'em!
---
I mean is it really spoilers if you already know he isn't uploading until he has 85 slayer and a whip?
---
Yea man, thats cool. I am not currently raids ready (sold gear for some upgrades) but I am not too far from being ready. Def add me though, would love to do raids in the future with ya :p
---
Aint got shit me on me kid

Why do you hate on a skill that isnt even out yet?

Uhhhhhh respond boi

Dude... Wiki

Btw? Btw BTW!
---
The reroutes trigger temporarily when the servers think they're getting ddos'd, and then it goes away after a while. You can't contact anyone to change it, no. This happens every month or two and then goes away on its own. 
---
The alternative to this is that whoever is ddosing the servers succeeds, and instead of having 200 ping you literally just can't play. Enjoy the 200 ping and thank jagex for preventing server ddos tbh, it's better than it would be otherwise.
---
this lol
---
Some random youtuber made a video about botters and suddenly everyone loses their minds. To be fair there are way less bots now than there were 12 years ago
---
How is that toxic? It’s a mutual transaction that’s beneficial for both parties. 
---
Honestly better than begging tbh since that’s a one sided deal and a pain for everyone else’s screen.
---
Gz dawg the grind never stops. What’s next for you?
---
Can I get that banana?  Need it to tele to Ape Atoll.
---
The last line tells us that the challenger got defeated. Or are you saying both of them are losers?
---
Only thing I don't like is insta kill mechanics it bugs me on any game
---
That's like 30 times the amount of gold though lol.
---
You leave my man 10cleverdad out of this.
---
Did he say where he got the bot
---
I’m maxed but if I ever care about post 99 xp I might go back there :)
---
Be careful. I did quests on a plane and dc’d during a boss fight. Gogo is spotty as fuck. It went down for like 20 minutes several times. 
---
Got the cape though.

Months later...

Many months later.

Normal username, find a new slant
---
You're pretty dumb but I'll help you out. 
---
* Yes a PIN is essentially a password. 
---
* Normal accounts therefore have two passwords. 
---
* UIM don't, so OP is suggesting a bad fix for it.
---
Ahh okay , thanks 😁.
---
This same exact thing has been happening to me! Hopefully a fix is put out soon, I can’t be going through slayer worried about if my OS is going to freeze in the middle of a kill.
---
Damn thats some good luck. Didnt get my 1st pair of rangers til clue 250
---
That’s the meme format. Music is part of it. It’s pretty popular on Twitter rn.

I love it!

Lol yes. It's a life saver.

Where would they move giant mole then?

Why is there no list of bosses on the wiki?  Or at least, why is there no list of which bosses are multi combat and which are not?  My buddy and I have 70+ combat stats and we wanted to try duoing some bosses.  So we went out to Crazy Archaeologist only to then find out it was not a multi combat area when we got all setup and got out there.  Pretty frustrating how hard it is for me to google/wiki something like "list of multi combat bosses".  Can anyone give me an idea of what we might be able to duo with 70+ combat stats? Venenatis? GWD? KBD? Dagonnoth Kings? Callisto? Zulrah? K'ril? Raids? No idea if these are even multi combat.
---
Ty!
---
22 ads scattered through. Fuck that.

The technology is not there yet

I still log into my account with the first username i ever used on the account. Which is a far-cry from the username i tote around today.

Lololol
---
Maybe it should stay there
---
Trying to get the motivation to finish out requirements for Ds2.  Have an elite clue and it’s my second to last quest to do before quest cape.

There's a pretty big difference between a pin and a password. Have you ever used a pin before?

The elite set gives 2.5% magic damage. Overall the only use of mage or melee is just to reduce switches, non-void setups are almost always better for either of those 2 styles. That's not a problem imo.
---
Without context, it does look a little silly
---
I think this was supposed to be a reply to another comment, not the post itself
---
To clarify, it becomes an extra option. You can also still do jad as your task.
---
Grats
---
But bro he's rank 1 bro..
---
Brought 400 hydra bones at a time, never died. Dinny B + high magic + hides and augury makes you basically unkillable if you can switch prayers properly and don’t brew your mage down.
---
The best place to stock up on rare fossils for whenever they finish the boss
---
Yah, splashing rats in lumby cellars is the current meta
---
Durial321 did nothing wrong!!
---
Kbd is probably your best bet with those stats
---
No problem! Good luck and have fun. It'll be great going through it all and you'll have tons of fun with your Ancient spells after heh. 
---
Tip: After the quest, you can change your spellbook at people's houses on world 330 instead of going back to the Ancient Altar. =)
---
Wowow your using torture with obby? You need berserker necklace for the set effect. I could usually last 5-6hr standing in the middle with absorbs at full hp. That was with 90 def but you should be fine in the middle.
---
I remember how crazy-packed every bank was before the GE. Even the east Varrock and edgeville banks were jammed full
---
Why wasd? Doesn’t it move super slow compared to middle mouse button
---
Well don't autoban, just flag the account and manually review it.
---
No legitimate player is going to create their first account and do nothing but instantly begin filling thousands of vials.
---
What's so bad about it?
---
I love data, and therefore I love you. Amazing way to put the data into figures, does well replacing looking at a white Excel sheet :)
---
Glad you got so much profit!
---
I mean it's probably fake lol.
---
They didn't continue on private chat for a reason.
---
Not to mention even if it is real, who cares?
---
Boy do we have scumbags
---
Holy shit dude.  These are absolutely amazing.  Do you sell them?
---
Oooh thanks bud gonna try this one out for sure
---
No worries. Good luck and have fun, feel free to message me if you have any other questions
---
That doesn't necessarily make it true, although perhaps it is. If you're getting more kills per hour that usually means you're making more profit per hour, unless they also did the math difference on the bolts
---
I love Lichteinstein's style aswell, and I attempted to use his style for these paintings \^\^.
---
Yeah, and it feels a lot better if used with a stylist
---
Yeah 30k/h is about what I am getting alongside 1.1m/h making Astrals. So it's not bad at all IMO
---
This. It doesn't concern you what they're doing out of rs and if you don't like the convo they're having, ignore list they ass :)
---
There are exploits they can do to immediately attack you without the chance of logging. Most commonly sit very far back and tilt screen down to see people beyond minimap, cast Veng and attack player. Due to the cast animation of veng, they will attack you before the white dot is on your screen.
---
It's bug abuse but I guess it's ok since the cool youtubers all do it too.

Today was a good day to be home sick.

Shoutout to BBWLover69

Thank you!!Yes they are currently up for sale on etsy \^\^.
---
Honey, you can’t keep spending our savings on mahogany tables... they’re so expensive!
---
People in my clan are in other merching clans and they say they are currently doing Sang the most because it's the easiest profit.
---
Yes it’s really hard for you to google an entire wiki that hundreds of people have contributed to that has given knowledge about the game.
---
It’s a wiki, not everything about Oldschool runescape is added in there, but it is updated frequently. 
---
Don’t be entitled to information you think should exist.
---
Why don’t you go ahead and find every boss that is multi combat or not and add it in?
---
I dont get it
---
100k really isn't that much
---
Bandos, Zammy, KBD, Giant Mole are your best bet.
---
That's another good way to do it. I'm just a school kind of gal.
---
Lol that shit could not have been more obvious, literally stared at the payer screen for 3 seconds with nothing on
---
Lol, its a fancy sandwich with an extra middle layer :p. Bread , ham bread, lettuce, bread. The last layer of bread is not in sight. Also I used yellow instead of brown to follow Lichtenstein's yellow + blue + red style.
---
Move the GE close to the Party Room

Ouch shitty luck on the boots. I had 2 pairs within 70 clues

You could just splash on a fucking chicken, right?

I don't like these memes much. He probably feels bad every time one pops up. And if he feels pressured and starts putting in more hours, he's just more likely to burn out

I kinda started seeing the episodes as a surprise treat instead of a scheduled thing. Worked well for me

Choose one. Dumbass.

read the chat

you cant effectivly switch againts more then 4 oponents, tanking with rune and 99 magic is way better, magic is inacurate in f2p and most of your magic defence comes from magic level anyway.

I also have no loans because scholarships. I wouldn't have gone to a school that put me into a ton of debt. If I hadn't received financial aid from that university, I would have picked a different one.
---
K. Didn't say it was hard for me to find the wiki. Or that it should be in there. It's just suprising to me that it isn't with the number of Reddit posts/questions just like mine that people have.
---
My mom just last week was about to send money to these weight loss wrap people to be apart of their "faboulous team" and "make money while doing nothing". I read the comments and the person was begging her to join. I told her no one just straight up begs a random lady on facebook to work for their company.
---
I do this to beggers.  Stand 4 tiles away and see them run to me makes me laugh.
---
The points are at the top in the tier lists. Rated on difficulty and rarity.
---
If drop is got in a team the points are split by the number of members equally, rounded up to the nearest 5 and not going below 10 points.
---
Bonus points are awarded to the first player to get each drop in their name for the month.

the grind is the fun, keep training (:

Buy raw lobsters in Fally, cook them and sell them in Varrock at a crazy profit level. Those were the days.

Don't u pretty much neeeeeeed the fally 3 shiled to do giant mole? Never tried with or without
---
Yeah not me lol

Shit this is looking more and more viable as gp income every day

70% of magic defence comes from magic level anyway.

Asking the real questions here

It's about time someone posted a door opening guide, I've been having so much trouble with them!

How necessary is the fally 3 shield for giant mole?

Same. Graphs and data are my thing lol but thank you very much!
---
It's Mod Ash
---
This is a text-book example of why you should always play with your public chat off. People suck.
---
i'm very turned on!
---
I need to do this before everyone stops splashing on rats, sounds like a fun time
---
The master farmer bots have been horrible recently. My guess is a farm of them got banned and the owner is starting up a new one with these guys. There were at least twenty of them. It’s insane to see.
---
Yes. That’s exactly what they think. They think they’re big and bad so if they were in front of you they would hurt you but in reality most of them probably avoid any form of physical conflict out in the real world.
---
Dude that's what I ended up doing. There's so many hards I didn't know I could do
---
Theres no reason to lock gear in lol. Thats exactly why we have the GE.
---
We’re talking about the party room, not the ge, you mongol 😂
---
the poor elf on the floor
---
not at theGE

Did alfie rwt while he made actual money from streaming? Also isnt he drug addicted?
---
No sane streamer with an actual viewerbase should risk their career for a weeks worth of donations. That makes little sense.
---
1.9k total, 269 qp, 300m bank
---
I don’t get why people are upset about them playing the game, and even making money off of it... like they give as much to the game as any other player and just cause some kid has more money in his allowance jar than their whole family may have in the bank  and wants to spend it on internet gold... I really don’t understand what’s wrong with it. I can understand jagex not wanting it but at the same time if it’s giving jobs to people lol.... I’m partial on it.
---
Supreme is ultimate, extreme is hardcore
---
&gt;Bis for over 109 bosses
---
Hmmm
---
If they switch, you switch back? Basic NH lmfao, it isn't hard. P2p is 10x harder to tank in f2p and this isn't difficult in p2p when you are drinking potions, prayer switching and combo eating. 
---
It's better to not switch if you aren't that good I agree. Perhaps for HCIM it's better not to, but if you are capable of doing it, then it's retarded not to bring it.
---
Getting to 97 combat without Barrows Gloves means you've already been leveling combat skills less efficiently for a long time now. Stop everything else and get rfd done lol
---
Mystic armor providing better stats is outdated. Void got updated and now void is always better than mystic without a torment brace. Its even better than ahrims without torment if ur magic atk bonus is 79 or over.
---
Gonna need a full body pic of nieve in the same style pls bby

pretty sure its 1200casts/h

Its a peninsula you turkey

Is there any place that has lots of guides put together for different topics. Like levelling up a specific skill or the fastest way to get something as an iron Man.
---
Literally unplayable.

Because that island is my favourite piece of content!!

I prefer Glory, as you don't need to burn three inventory slots.

Hey I'm not that skinny
---
Move it to Camelot
---
0.144% chance, ouch
---
They should only hit 0s if you drink an extended anti-fire potion and wear the anti-fire shield. Literally should just be an afk task where you take no damage.
---
becouse not all of them will switch and thos that dont will bang you out becouse you are no longer in tank gear.
---
LOL
---
What s twisted bush man.
---
I logged in in mobile for the first time in years and had 1 mill on me so i gave the guy next to me 200k... Started playing a bit and decided to skill n kill for a bond and now i kinda regret it lol.
---
Is not that what the majority of new players do anyways, though? I know for a fact that I never intently grinded money in my F2p days, and I've completed all F2p quests on multiple accounts. The only way I ever got money was selling logs or bones or or fish whatever when leveling. Never with the express purpose of making money. This means I don't believe I ever had a stack of cash larger than 50k at a time.
---
The only way I see a f2p account using too much more than 100k by the completion of Dragon Slayer, is if they were doing buyable skills.
---
Other than Dragon Slayer and buying armor, what singular F2p quest is there that a player would have to spend anywhere near like even ~10k? Im throwing a blank here, the majority would at most be like 5k, and only if you bought every single item.
---
Neo is that you?
---
You can afk range corp at corp FFA07 cc
---
Some people can't quit if there's something to go back to, I've done the same with games in the past. 
---
Some people can't walk away unless they can't go back to it, you knaw?
---
They're arguably the worst ones at that: they don't drop anything good, spawn only in awkward spots, have high HP and are generally annoying.
---
This would devalue my agility shortcut at GE only iron man
---
That's what I've been doing it on, haven't quite been able to finish Jad off yet
---
Who the fuck pays that

was hyperbole...

Ah well it’s definitely worth getting used to middle mouse button. It’s much faster and doesn’t stop you from typing

I'm certain that Settled will find a way to utilize it, and Rendi will find a way to sneak into the Swamp with less hassle.

---
rapier is literally the last upgrade you get for slayer
---
I like the idea of a smaller GE with the party room close by. The GE is unnecessarily large and it would make the party room much more useful since most people bankstanding or Skilling in the GE go bonkers for the unofficial drop parties that randomly pop up there.
---

i hope this EP. is long as hell too

Still free lamp exp
---
I think reporting them is more efficient than JamFlex's bot detection system, but it still takes them half a month to ban their accounts! SMH
---
its a runelite bug, everyones been having similar problems.
---
Warding is fine if they remove all the unnecessary and complicating stuff (monoliths, soapstones, runic energies/vis, area buffs, battlewards). The altars already in game are fine. 
---
Could be great even if it interwines with the skills players like the least (Agility, Firemaking, Runecrafting) and actually makes them more useful while also maybe introduce some new ways to train these along with Warding.
---
lol what
---
I don’t know exactly which plugin you are describing, but searching “XP” into Runelite will be probably show what you are looking for
---
we play a fucking game where an evil chicken used to wreck players you're dumb
---
For the music, duh.
---
i am using the bracelet. it only works like 1/8 kills tho i swear. it almost feels like the range bonus from green bracers would speed it up more... idk tho. i might just be getting done dirty by RNG.

I still don’t get what the crab emoji and crab background is with osrs

The game isn’t the same without it. Too much freely flowing water in that area now.

You ought to use tge ring of wealth of you arent already. I got 3 wyrm tasks and 2 swords. Goes from 1:40k to about 1:2000. Also makes it a shit ton more profitable. My average take is about 700k per 130-ish kills.
---
There was a time where all worlds had an active CW game. It's just a change in the community that you, OP, perfectly encapsulate.
---
That makes sense. Was the first time seeing it since my pickaxe is usually charged. Thanks for clearing the air.
---
Daang looks amazing, keep it up

Don't you have work to do. You can't just sit on reddit all day posting in runescape fan art threads.

Now you may as well grind out the kq head for the desert elite diary.... right? :D
---
Using Dharok set is most common because you can keep protect from melee up while at really low healthy for massive DPS. That’s 70 defense and a little uncomfortable for some people though. 
---
I’d recommend whatever you got for best in slow melee armor, with a defender or any strength boosting items. Dragon scim, whip, and abyssal dagger are all doable options with the scim being the weakest. 
---
You can also just do a full prayer setup with proselyte or monks robes. Regardless of what you do you should be praying protect from melee.

Grinding through my skotizos because I just got all hard clue reqs :D

"after completing graduate school, you have done nothing with your educated mind, but waste it away on a children's medieval clicking game... and i have never been more proud. I am god, and i am the one who DDOS'd you earlier."
---
Ba us very fun when your team isn't shit
---
For any future attempts, I just make sure the lvl 111s cannot hit me, the little guys basically do nothing
---
No. It’s worth it to pay for the Gardener
---
"lesser exchange"
---
That's about the levels I started with.
---
I recommend getting used to F keys to make gear switches and prayer changes easier.
---
Zulrah is kinda tough to learn at first, and you'll die a bunch. But once you get the hang of it, she's a good time.
---
Im doing this right now, currently 7k kc in. Hosidius rework kinda fucked over the spot by placing dead trees on the edges of grass/sand. Still around 350-380 kills/hr.
---
Ring of wealth has no effect. It goes from 1/10k to 1/2k when you’re on task to kill them. OP was on task but got b2b 1/2ks so it was 1/40k essentially
---
Gamers rise up
---
sometimes, you just gotta grind it out bro.
---
It's fine for me
---
Buying and selling has a cost to it.
---
I was just recently doing the same on a Delta flight. mlm'd a few levels during a couple flights! feels good man
---
That’s what I heard too when I played back in the day but I don’t think there’s any evidence, only speculation
---
I dont think you fully understand the intent of this meme my friend
---
You did in another comment that you save 15m but it takes 25 days longer. To decide if that’s worth it add up how much time you save with 25 days without farm runs and multiply that by how much you make an hour. Given that you’re doing magic trees you can probably make enough that the time you lose not paying the gardener is not worth the money you saved
---
Used to sell a lot of gold back when flower poker was a thing. Those “popular” shops have insane markup to make $$. They buy for a fraction of what they sell for. To get the best deals you need to find a mm forum and you’ll find a scythe for a lot closer to $600. Not that I’m advocating that at all - done cheating with this game
---
Might finish off 70 agility lol, should’ve done that a while ago, might start mm2, might honestly just farm herbs and collect secondaries like I have been for weeks now
---
I'm all about those Girros and Tzitzi-Ya-Ku
---
RC bad
---
A bit, but the cost is smaller than the value of doing things with better gear
---
Just Google him bro
---
25
---
Check out onekikrick by 9rain, small channel but hilarious content!
---
I think that's shortsighted. Barrows can be done at crazy low level, where Zulrah can't.
---
I would say that’s a decent strat. I did the same and I learned it from my cc where a few people had done it. Went from 50-65 agility using it and made a decent profit and xp gain.
---
Clickbait thumbnail
---
Good bot.
---
chug it down
---
I think duradel is better. Assuming you don’t mind doing bosses.
---
Slayer.
---
Cool but also ew vape
---
Probably not, the second a woman gets the title of wife, she also gets the title of bitch. It's a win win for her, either she gets to spend all your money or she gets it all in a divorce anyways.
---
it needs to be clicked on that way it isn't traceable through various forms of hacking. I understand your sarcasm, but account security is a real problem in oldschool runescape. People put thousands of hours into their accounts. They shouldn't have to be worried about jagex letting someone recover their account and them subsequently get locked out and robbed of everything they spent time obtaining.
---
**indecipherable "30 something" range mumbling**
---
Thank u
---
It's like fire cape people trash talking obby cape people
---
Can confirm, I am your wife.
---
Because jagex may not have the resources to establish or maintain such an expensive feature?
---
Ill pretend to be your girlfriend for 1m.
---
Ur welcome
---
Sees Like someone forgot timezones were a thing
---
Any decent chef would be missing all of these cuts. 
---
Any commited chef would have only callouses on the pads of the fingers from willingly burning themselves on things in order to make service run smoothly.
---
You mad bro?
---
It could include all the bloopers and the clips of when he finally gets something after a long grind where hes going "holy fucking shit it's about time," aka the part right before he records the clip for yt.
---
For real? Man, i always thought the ring of wealth was doing the magic for me.
---
Well, TIL i guess
---
I feel personally attacked with that title.
---
Its not MY fault i have atleast double the exp in farming than my next lowest!
---
/s
---
Yes we all know that spoiler, but 85 slayer isn't all that hes been doing.
---
The cooldown makes it muuuuch better
---
He's going for the long road for the high msintance bot.
---
Shouldn't it be the mist battlestaff?
---
What a way to end finals! The one way to make me feel like I haven't lost hope in myself.
---
Funny thing is Mog is legit brain dead enough to actually do this, I would honestly doubt that it’s RWT. Crazy bastard
---
When he got the blue cape he joked about how people would talk about how red cape was the best and how the series went to shit after that.  The OP is just running with the joke by making the very claim Settled said would happen.
---
I'm super used to f keys because I do a ton of demonic gorillas. I'm okay with dying if I know that getting decent will let me profit. I've wanted to do it because it's a challenge rather than afk or mind numbing, thanks for the help :))
---
Noon here. What's splashing and why are they so upset here?
---
If you play an ironman you never have to see it so whats the problem, its a win win
---
An item sink would be great yes, but not if it was all as complicating as it is in Rs3. Maybe if all weapons/armors dissolved would give some raw materials back along with a very small chance of just one kind of special material used for imbuing.
---
However rare clue scroll items would yield a very high to a 100% chance of said material, and even rarer more powerful would give multiple of this material. Needs some good balancing, but this item would be tradeable, and consumed when used to imbue.
---
Said special material would then be used to imbue either the NMZ items, some of the new magic armors to unlock their niche bis that were proposed, or even the now very common god rune sets. Those being so common now begs for them to be craftable somehow, a la armor trimming.
---
I'm kinda iffy with items degrading over time or use though, would rather just see them degrade if lost somehow (death, trade, drop, stake)
---
Why would you drop it?
---
And not know it? Yes
---
Go find a beaver and put it on his front porch for his hard work
---
Some things don’t though, which is weird. Ranger boots are still the same price as when I got one like 4 years ago, if not more expensive
---
anddddddddd the clip is gone. *puts on tin foil hat*
---
Can't get pregnant if you've never had sex.  🤔
---
i did not believe it for a second, like, i wouldnt even post a pic like that lol
---
Go 75+ atk and 75+ def and then make an alt to pk with that you can just slap in NMZ overtime. 70+ prayer on a main is always good too.
---
you guys are making me regret spamming my spacebar while i watch slayermusiq
---
People still do that, yes.
---
Thank you both for your input!
---
is there even a reason to want to host? Do people want to be "cool" or something? I don't get it lol.
---
probably a bot
---
This is really well done, love the style looks super clean.
---
I like that he plays RS3 on lowest detail to make it look like 2011scape. I do the same thing.
---
Did he mean saying yeeehaaa like cowboys do? I am sorry english is not my native lang. L.
---
Imagine having the name 'bigdaddyy69' and calling literally anyone sad....
---
I'm refering to non-combat skills. And no, not a single slayer monster drops non-combat skills.
---
Lol no, the new RWT is you poison a target and then send them to die on the frogs in Sophanem.
---
Gratz, I got mine yesterday as well. It felt damn huge 🙏.
---
New chest piece upgrade, dragon lungs.
---
I'm referring to non-combat skills. Slayer monsters don't do shit for non-combat.
---
In the official RuneScape 15 year documentary, Jagex staff says the contacted him and thoroughly reviewed his account over the years, and there was never any evidence it was more than one person. He never had 20 hour averages over long periods.
---
Smoke devils will drop all to 1
---
Didn't hide how long your anti lasts? thanks for the clue scroll enabled ironman, noob.
---
Runecrafting is fun.
---
So it's not really a thing then anymore? Now that I am older, I am realizing the MASSIVE advantage to odds staking haha, wish I could go back
---
*mine
---
But then I can't prank people anymore by saying there's gonna be a drop party and then walking from the GE all the way to Falador in a train of people.
---
Thank you! Work was slow so I threw it together this morning haha. I definitely own some credit to 7thSleeper though, he started to crossover art trend!

Isn't basking in things that are no longer fun what this whole subreddit is about?

~~I'm kidding, please don't kill me.~~

The real money comes from hijacking accts and RWTing the gold.

It might be a slight benefit due to being able to take advantage of your mains blocks (alt probably hasn't got as many block slots) but you will have to have other things for your accounts to do during downtime so that they don't waste time waiting for the partner to finish a task.
---
Overall I don't think it would be worth doing as it would just make it more tedious for minimal gain
---
I play on ultrawide but just on half the monitor usually.  I watch twitch or whatever on the other half
---
What the fuck is this and what the fuck are you people talking about?
---
Why was that the most stupid question you’ve read today?
---
Honestly making a new pure could end up being the same amount of time you’d spend on making your current account a PKing account. 
---
The first thing that you’d need to do is decide whether you like high level PKing (fix your account) or low level PKing (make a pure).
---
If you want to high level PK and make your acc a beast, train your mage, because you need Vengeance. The quest Lunar Diplomacy should be a priority for you (as well as Desert Treasure). 
---
You’ll also need Barrows gloves. Finish Recipe for Disaster. 
---
Keep your 70 Attack and Defence. You can choose to get 75 Attack at any point in time for all of the options you’ll have down the line. You can also choose to get 75 Defence at any time. 
---
You’ll need your range over level 90 for the HP levels it’ll give you.
---
Prayer, you could keep 52 for now. And decide on getting Chilvary/Piety down the line. 
---
Train your strength up, obviously. 
---
However, with base 70 melee stats, Vengeance and Barrows gloves, you would be decent at full Dharoks PKing if you pick your fights right. You could also gear up in regular gear (Fighter’s torso, Neitiznot, etc) and bring a D scim to AGS/G maul/DDS. 
---
This is not the most efficient guide to making your account viable for PKing (I’m not a God at PKing or an OSRS know-it-all) but it’s a perfect road to becoming a strong PKer on your own accord. What would help would be if you actually did make a baby pure, but solely for the reason that it helps keep your nerves at ease, helps you learn the mouse movements, etc. It would be less of a hit to die on a pure and lose basically nothing rather than learn to PK on your main and die losing hundreds of thousands of GP each death.

Gains a massive cult following of groupthink numale redditors, proceeds to make tens of thousands of dollars in weeks off views and merch, videos aren't even that great 
---
Is worshiped by hundreds of sycophants 
---
Suddenly content slows down, "muh burn out, playing runescape in an air conditioned room all day for 6 figures is hard man, haha, buy some of my merch why don't you"
---
Bing bing Wahoo playing redditors keep sucking his dick until the end of time
---
Vorkath, ToB, and chinning are about your only uses of void. If you plan on doing any of those three things it's definitely worth it. If not, no harm in skipping it.
---
Hell yeah. A 532 hour long episode.
---
IT'S A REINDEER!
---
I was looking for this
---
2nd part is true
---
532 Hours is fairly long.

only on task though

Bob, can I get a refund?

aberrants drop agility for sure dunno about others

"Hand it over, that thing, your rune scape."
---
I mean, its not all bad, he hands over the loot when he 'crashes' so its not a total loss. He has several people hes 'crashed' that dont care and he sets up something with them where the pm him when they get specs up so he can come in for the kill. I guess everyone here is gonna say theyve never stolen a kill from anyone ever?
---
unless you know a way of aggroing them off task
---
By 98 you mean 99 with 2 000 000xp right?
---
The presentation of your photo sucked. You should crop your screenshots

Jardflox
---
get disease and never let it run out maybe? don't know the mechanics of that very well
---
Legit question, how come he never went for a Barrows weapon like Verac’s flail when grinding for the whip. I know all Barrows weapons are slower than a rune scimmy, but I imagine the major increase to damage is worth it.
---
You goofed
---
Get diseased?

I just cross the bridge and splash on goblins

Nice.

Please explain the meme where you are asking for more swampletics videos because they are like crack

Please break down this reposted garbage for me then?

I can help you to break up but can't get rid of dad. Maybe send him to buy cigarettes.
