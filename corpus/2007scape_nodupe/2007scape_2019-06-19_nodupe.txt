I’m in a position right now that I can’t purchase a bond. I think I’m just gonna grind it out and get it eventually, this post was out of pure frustration. Thank you for your comment and insight

---
Ayy
---
Why do u have 1 hunter and farming though
---
Holy shit, it's almost like account are being phished and bots are being made faster than it takes to confirm they're bots. Maybe players should stop getting phished so their accounts can't be stolen and used to bot. Do you honestly think it would be better if they were more so liberal with macro bans that legitimate players would get banned?
---

---
Always report, it helps.

Your comment

&gt;There is never a reason to do Konar other than for Hydra tasks. It’s worse points and XP per hour than Dura and Nieve.
---
Let's take a closer look! 
---
&gt;***never a reason other than Hydra***
---
Well there's point boosting, so you missed that one. There's a use, when you said there wasn't.
---
i did figure it out on my own, suck yourself off some more
---
Yeah some things are just like that, like the Lunar staff for example. Kinda sucks but at least you can get it back without too much sweat
---
Wow!
---
I just feel like it doesn't do enough.  Like how is there so many 100m+ range exp accounts doing this, with the bare minimum skilling levels, and all have 77 slayer...  How is this not a red flag?
---
Fk this is so funny, osrs leaks at almost every major festival now
---
What the fuck is that prayer book layout
---
Seems legit
---
This is probably the unfortunate truth
---
Greetings from a Manchester native. How did you enjoy the festival?
---
you can probably afford some summer pies by the time you're done at least
---
0/10
---
Old people get phished too. And honestly you're right. Grandma is a piece of shit for being ignorant and not understanding that people lie on the phone and online. Old biddy needs to starve to learn that lesson.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks dude. Going to a music festival this weekend and a sign like this would be perfect lol
---
There are literally players in this subreddit who post their accounts with 99 combat skills and 99 slayer with sub 20 in most other skills. They have to take a liberal approach with autobanning players as to not ban legitimate players. Would you it rather be the opposite, where training certain skills for consecutive amounts of time would get you autobanned?
---
Just the standard normal rumble with Absorptions and Rock Cake and whatever gear I have at the time. Currently invested in the Obsidian set.
---
how do you know they aren't alts?
---
No one makes you use a guide you know....
---
Please read the text.
---
I noticed this too, I think it's because the vessel with a karambwanji in it is a different item to an empty vessel. So when you catch a karambwan it unloads then auto reloads again and the vessel is basically a new item.
---
Just my guess though
---
Counterpoint: The randomized puzzles make the puzzles simpler and less enjoyable for people who actually like completing the puzzles, because it generally just becomes trial and error instead of actual problem solving. So everyone loses.
---
If your connection goes out because you're traveling and your signal drops momentarily between towers you get force logged, it sucks for mobile on the train sometimes. 
---
when i was afking nmz while at work I actually ran the client on my home desktop and used chrome remote desktop to click every 10 minutes or so from my phone.
---
I don’t think autobanning for basically ANYTHING should be done.  I think certain things should be red flags for investigation.  Like always being logged at brutal blacks, with 77 slay and 100m+ range exp.
---
Idk man 200m rs3 only converts to like 50k osrs. So glws.
---
That's means a JMOD is shadow banned lol.
---
Yah... Trying to support your argument with a fallacy only hurts your argument.
---
I’ve already had two smouldering stone drops at 75 slayer, so I’m not entirely sure what’s going on with my rng
---
depends on the boss. Bosses like zulrah and vorkath use lots of food. Loads of people kill rune dragons and that uses a shit ton of food. Also general slayer im sure tons of people are using karambwans and sharks. Anyways the main reason is because theres only 2 or 3 worlds with people pking using sharks and then for pvm its every world. ALSO, alot of pkers use dark crabs or manta rays instead of sharks.
---
It’s not against rules to transfer. Just need to find a trusted person.
---
FWIW, not making mistakes and not talking aren't proof. People alting bbds are the same people doing 3t4g for 16 hours a day with 0 fuck ups. Dropping the black dhdide is a clear giveaway though lmao
---
Inventory spot saved also
---
IP addresses don’t mean shit. They aren’t unique to computers or your connection as many people, myself included have a dynamic IP. Rebooting your router can change your IP, them warning you that your account has been accessed by a different IP doesn’t help at all. If you went on mobile you IP would even change depending on when you last hit flight mode or changed location. Sure if you suddenly logged in with an IP in fucking Cambodia then yeah, however it’s easy to spoof an IP and appear elsewhere. 
---
Also there’s no chance in hell that your bank pin was removed in two hours. Runelite, whilst I use it myself, isn’t official and is still technically a risk to your account security. Are you saying that your bank pin is gone? Or just they bypassed it? Which implies a piece of malware that watched you input your pin and screenshot each click. 
---
Change all passwords on a phone, take the pc off of your network, scan and fully clean and then you can go back to normal. Malwarebytes is a good cleaner, AVG always did me well too.
---
nah, still comes from fish skill
---
Thanks a lot guys! :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I know, I'm not looking to buy any fancy stuff. Just needed some cash to level smithing/crafting  for  mm2 and Vorkath. Since those are the content I really want  to see!!!
---
That would literally flag every bbd alt.
---
That’s like 19m in osrs.
---
This is not true for SoA, only Heroes.
---
That’s how you tab back and find yourself in lumbridge
---
Can we get osrs HD someday?
---
F
---
Yeah, I'm the opposite. I almost never use my phone at work otherwise, so I use it about ten times as much now than I did before AFK NMZing. I'm still the most productive fucker in the building though, so no one really gives a damn.
---
Nice
---
If you're saying that the fight is very robotic and instead of reacting to the bosses attacks and interacting with what is going on you're just clicking back and forth at the correct time, then I kind of agree.
---
after the deadman change, it said it changed from 1/100 to 1/50...?
---
Is there not a sufficient team to sift through probably less than 5000 accounts??  A lot of whom are bots???  Like..  it’s pretty easy to distinguish between the two even as a normal player, not a Jagex employee, with insight into hidden machinations.
---
RIP to cannonball profit in the last couple months.
---
Yeah i play diablo 2 and 3.
---
Yes, it’s considered a trust trade
---
Transition into path of exile.. it’s Diablo 3 as it should have been
---
For deadman mode, yes

Best early game grinds on ironman? My goals are qpc, 99 fm, 99 fishing and maybe 83 hunter for prayer/glory. Any other recommendations?
---
Gotta work on separating the text. My brain died trying to read his
---
I know 2 people irl that had 1337
---
Cerberus is a male. In Latin, names ending with -us are typically male and ending with -a are female, e.g. Cornelius/Cornelia Julius/Julia.
---
Imagine dying because you joined the military due to an Agility meme.
---
Or people who want to say "I've completed the quest" should actually complete the quest instead of whining for shortcuts because they can't be assed to stop their 16 hour slayer marathon to do one piece of huge content
---
For keeping an untrimmed 99 Cape do you have to drop and telegrab it when buying other 99 capes or just when you get the other skill to level 99? TIA
---
.     W
---
Thanks for the feedback, I have blurred out the kill count in the thumbnail so you can't read it. Might look like it is there but it's blurred out. Cheers.
---
And you're the loser to crosspost this here. 
---
Nice.
---
Good to hear. Didnt mean to come off too aggressive but from the title i was not expecting a live doggo at the end.
---
GAMERS RISE UP

If you’re trying to go efficient I would follow the optimal quest order thing

Happy cake day!

Could we have the option to combine the Crystal Coif with a Slayer Helm so that it has the bonus damage/accuracy when used with the Chest &amp; Legs? It could serve as a niche option for people that can't afford a Twisted Bow on things like Sire where Long Range weapons are favored for killing the Vents in the first phase.
---
depends on if you are comparing like arma set, switching archers ring etc or just rag range bp rigour but ye, not wrong.
---
or zogres for a disease splash
---
yeah that’s what i’m planning on once i finish the 99 fm grind.
---
Thank you!
---
When you get the other 99. Buying the cape doesn't trim your existing capes.
---
Careful not to pick them up normally, it also always trims the cape.
---
just when you get the skill
---
6 hour logout timer question. 
---
I’ve been AFKing NMZ for about a week and I have no problem with the logout timer I’m just a bit confused. 
---
Does the timer only happen when doing combat? I swear I spent like 12 hours doing agility like half a year ago and I don’t remember getting logged out. Does combat initiate the timer or what? Thanks!
---
Is that weed?
---
Increased resource also come from: Kourend and Kebos 8% chance to catch 2 fish at once/5% increased yield at Hosidus/10% additional blood runes, Varrock 10% chance to mine two ores, Ardougne 3 10% increased chance to pickpocket.
---
Suiciding is 100% worth it while learning. You're gonna die anyway, why waste points by dying when you're almost done?
---
No one cares about your wall of text
---
hey I'm not complaining
---
4:1 is a thing in group raids too
---
5 minutes without interacting with the client if not in combat, 20 minutes if you are in combat
---
If you're interacting with the client in any way (moving the mouse over it, even) then you only get logged after 6 hours
---
Yess, revitalizing content! YES!
---
Lol
---
They're good to do in the catacombs multi. When one gets venomed, go after the other one. Speaking of which, I should unblock it and replace that block with something else.
---
I’d probably stop fm around like 80-85 since the rewards are really bad when your other stats are low. Just grab a bit of starting cash
---
Well done on taking my statement literally.
---
A lot of monsters commonly assigned as slayer tasks also drop hard clues, but have actual decent drops alongside them. I have hellhounds blocked until I unlock cerb and am interrupted constantly by hard clue scrolls.

I might go past that till 90 for the clue step as well as money for more than 200k feathers for 99 fishing.
---
This meme is fantastic
---
What that pking should just be in pvp world's? Na why not most people play for the pvm anyway and this way pvp world's might see an increase in use plus more opportunities to find someone to fight if they are all in the same world's
---
Interesting one, the 6 hour timer (from my experience so don't take it as gospel!) is like this...
---
At roughly 6 hours you will get instantly logged out if you aren't doing something. If you are in constant combat you'll get instantly logged out during a random time in the next like 15 minutes. 
---
If you did agility for 12 hours straight it's likely that you may of hopped worlds or even had a lag spike that disconnected you temporarily then regained connection - technically resetting your timer.
---
Just max every skill except mining, rc, and agility. You’ll burn out instantly
---
SPOILERS!
---
Going to poh after each kill? Those are 1 kill trips lol
---
Fairy rings are most gp per kill but less gp per hour
---
At least this KC at Hydra you’d make bank. Thermy isn’t great money.
---
Weak to crush apparently, so dwh and bludgeon. Plus there’s talks of it dropping a unique crush weapon that would be bis against it.
---
I haven’t noticed that yet but I’d be shocked if there wasn’t a variety of scripts available, and settings within those scripts.
---
It would also flag every bbd bot. Why are you so defensive about just a flag? Are you concerned about your bot farm being flagged?
---
If you have a bbd alt it's not using a damn rune crossbow for artificial level 113 or 121 range xp.
---
That the dude who doo doo on himself?
---
It’s weak to crush so probably bludgeon. Depends on it’s stats
---
I haven’t noticed that personally but I’d be shocked if there wasn’t a variety of scripts, with different settings options.
---
Gotchu fam
---
Everytime you walk into the rev caves
---
I remember going to kbd at 75ish range with a friend who was 85ish att/str. 
---
I got every single drop by a long shot
---
I've been mentally building up to this so good to hear it's not impossible.
---
I couldn’t do it because the muscle memory
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
part of their advertising tactic is hoping people post this shit to reddit, don't give them any free publicity
---
Do you need to barrage it more than once per kill? Or is one enough with max mage
---
If you the rs community bitches about entering wildy 0 chance they’re entering the next war for that sweet sweet oil.
---
No u
---
It’s the best way to do easies
---
Try putting it in the ge for prices you're looking to receive
---
Oh wow thanks for the tip! But yea actually my acc is on a break rn
---
Can’t lose what you don’t have
---
117 with absolute BIS gear for vorkath and can’t kill him I tried and when I realized I was down 5m from paying 100k to get my items every time I gave up and went back to slayer
---
Take some heat...eat a sweet...suck a camel teet?
---
Thanks pal.
---
It definitely deserves a perm ban in this case. He's a bigoted piece of shit who got multiple warnings before.
---
I’ve got 600 sharks if you want a clean 8k... hm ea
---
Didn't they do that with that strykwyrm in the wilderness in rs3?
---
Most likely the Sarachnis’ Cudgel which the boss drops, but the update doesn’t say if it will be bis versus the boss. 
---
There are better crush weapons out there based purely on stats.
---
I'll buy for 97k, much higher than you'd get in the GE
---
That would cost money
---
Lolol this is great
---
Zero Imagination
---
Yeah, I love Skilling. I've done every quest and it just wasnt a good time. Needed the Cape for the diary, though
---
Zybez, baby.

I mean, if you have ever been to the UK, it is pretty fucking cold most of the year. Lots of people that live in colder areas tend to not be able to handle the heat.

Could we get a release date for the Song of the Elves content?
---
I wanted to take some time off work to play the new stuff ;-; selfish question, but yeah
---
They have a good reputation iirc but you're definitely vulnerable w/ no recourse if they do scam you
---
this man cant stop
---
Lol Twitch doesn't care about social justice, they just don't want to be associated with bigots because it loses them money.
---
Perhaps
---
Can confirm
---
1) IP address is literally meaningless. 
---
2) If you have never had another instance of card used on the account, it's not possible for Jagex to tell if the new card is legit or not.
---
3) Per the ToS of basically every MMO out there, you are responsible for the actions of your account. This includes unpaid debt.

Are there any plans for Arcanists or any of the popular Funorb games to be revived, or have they been shelved entirely? There appears to be a decent amount of community interest around them, and it would put minds at ease if we got a definitive answer.

For those who care, he did announce today that it is only a 30 day ban, either way, hopefully he'll use this as a opportunity for improvement and be more careful about what he says.
---
Shit like this scares me. I wonder how many people don't even comprehend what's being polled
---
Convenient, sure. Worth dropping Dev time into? Not in my opinion.
---
What's so great about a loot log? I'm being downvoted in the comment before so I assume people think it had more functionality.
---
It just gave you an RSS feed of their valuable drops, and skill increases. We have a site that offers the latter, and the former just isn't that vital to me as a long term player. I maybe looked at the adventure log twice back in the day.
---
Was there more features to it that I'm forgetting? Or are people riddled with nostalgia just downvoting me because they don't like what I have to say. If it's wrong, tell me. If it's not, you're simply saying "I liked looking at it" and I'm saying, "that's great.. but what does it offer?"
---
Got it, thanks for the info! That probably makes sense, I was tired as shit that day just working so I wasn’t paying very close attention to what was happening.

Okay thanks!

Or you can just not judge people by how they enjoy the game

This statement is entirely an opinion. And the entire paragraph is structured around it. It's an opinion I disagree with completely given that I love nearly every change that Jagex has made to osrs. An argument made solely on an assumed opinion is bad, especially to people who have differing opinions.
---
No I do not
---
It's sad that this is an unpopular opinion, or people think that this is an unpopular opinion  
---
People can't seem to handle difficulty nowadays, runelite has really spoiled everyone. Oldschool btw.
---
I had no idea osrs was in the festival community. I wanna get a party hat and specs for my next fest.
---
No, not everyone does. Also, being willing to do a job doesn't mean you're actually lucky to have to go and do it.
---
Imagine not having a shitty alt made just for nude exchanging.
---
Sulliusceps are the shit, I'm mad I didn't try these earlier. They're faster than 5t teaks, arguably just as afk, the fossils give free passive runecrafting xp, and if you have a poh with a pool and mounted pendant you don't even need to bring food.
---
Wish there was something similar for fishing
---
That's not how drops work bro
---
There is a huge difference between the shadows and portal 1/half life puzzles. You can avoid the portal and half life enemies. Be sneaky, take them out. How to deal with enemies is part of the puzzle. 
---
The shadows in the temple of light respawn quickly and interrupt the interfaces of interacting with pillars. It's unnecessarily frustrating. They're only there to make you need to use supplies and make the puzzle last longer, they aren't something you can be smart about to avoid.
---
damn can't believe trump himself personally cleansed northern syria of isis. couldn't possibly have been the sdf, thats liberal propaganda

Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of radical right-wing, authoritarian ultranationalism[1][2]characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[4] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries.[4] Opposed to liberalism, Marxismand anarchism, fascism is placed on the far-right within the traditional left–right spectrum.

potions make up like 150
---
all blessed d hide and rune armor make up another 100
---
all teleports is like another 100
---
got ur 100 fashionscape items you rotate daily
---
then ofc you have your actual gear
---
then ofc theres other shit you pk like 10 emblems, rev cave drops, neitz helm, rune crossbow, water staff, yada yada. like 150
---
yeah it's not hard to hit 816 bank space. just checked and my pk loot tab is 378 items and it doesnt even have shit like mith plate in it. glories take up 7 spaces, combat brace takes up 7, wealth takes up 6, burning necks take up 5, games necks take up 8, duels take up 8, like holy fuck. no point selling em cuz ur gunna pk all of them back within a day.

Anything with the word Dank or 420

How about 420dank420?

What stat levels will be necessary to complete the upcoming Prif Gauntlet at a reasonable rate? I am planning on grinding it for the new sword and would like to know what stats to shoot for.
---
this is great hahah
---
You can do that?!?!?!?
---
I'm in the same boat. Started them today to try to speed up the 85 woodcutting grind for the kebos diary. From the guides I'd looked at, I thought they were going to be really click intensive, which was why I had put off doing them until now.
---
If it’s really a she, she’ll be training agility for both.

Everything is actually in an underground vault, like in Harry Potter. Run by the dwarfs. I thought everyone knew that?

I’m pushing 800 cerb kills and still get occasionally fucked by the ghost + lava pool combo.
---
How about a staff that amplifies the standard surge spells. Each spell would have a certain effect when cast with the staff:
---
Air surge: knocks back the opponent a couple tiles (not sure if this should interrupt combat Incase of pjers) 
---
Earth Surge: Slows down the attack speed of weapons by one tick for five seconds 
---
Five Surge: Has a bleeding effect for a certain period of time 
---
Water Surge: Heals 25% of damage dealt. 
---
....this is solely from a pvp perspective. Wouldn’t really work in PvM
---
Same lol that was tough

You realize US politicians are beholden to AIPAC and Jewish donors, not the other way around?

Last time I read Times of Israel or Haaretz I didn't see any European names authoring their articles. Yet, look at the journalists in American media and you will find an abundance of Jewish names.

Do these facts make me a member of a political movement that has not been in power for over 70 years? No, but keep overusing that ad-hominem until it completely loses all its weight.

Second, I bought that book 3 times at my middle school book fair, everytime I came back to the game I had to get a new book. It was like the original Wiki :)

You can watch shows and movies while doing ardy guards with 100% focus on the show/movie. Not proper afk but it's still 0% focus on the game.

Definitely weird how some things are like that and others aren't. That's $11 for ya tho

You can space out even at seers while watching a show and keep full agility efficiency after just a little bit of doing it. It's nowhere near hard to watch something during it.

You want me to feel sorry for you as you sit there in a bill+ gear?
---
It’s a sign/pole/something people hold at festivals mainly to serve as an identifier for people to find your group. It’s very very easy to lose your friends at these festivals and finding them after in the seas of people that are bonnaroo it can be very hard to see them even if they’re 10 feet from you. What the totem does is generally is taller than most people so you can spot it from very far away. People generally do funny, ironic, shit on their totems for the laughs.
---
God knows why it hasn't been updated in 10 fuckin years lol
---
I use a app called "floating apps", you can watch videos while grinding too very useful

---
Is it possible to get membership for life without having to pay for each month to year? I love this game and i always play it. But when friends want to play a different game, i see that as xp waste. I think it may be due to the fact that im spending money monthly to play the game. Can i just pay a lump sum to have it for life or something? This way i wont feel like i need to get my moneys worth each month.

I have a feeling you actually know just as little, if not actually less, about Syrian geo politics and the US involvement in defeating ISIS than the guy you replied to.
---
Trump absolutely can claim a very significant role in defeating ISIS
---
I bet Henry Ford was memeing when he wrote his book "The International Jew" or maybe former U.S presidents: Harry Truman &amp; Richard Nixon were memeing when they made remarks about the Zionist agendas in America. :thonking:

they ban over 100k bots a week

just because the bots you see arnt banned doesnt mean they arnt banning bots. the problem is they come riiiiight back with2 more bots. its not as simple as having someone sit there and ban bots.

Like pottery, people upvote my argument, then when somebody mentions an entirely unrelated thing such as my username it gets downvoted. Meanwhile SickFez's does the inverse after bad name man being mentioned. Guys, I have a great idea, let's base the interaction of our conversation off of these little uppy downy things, so that even those that have nothing to say in return can still show emotional dislike of it. Also, if we're being clear here, I love to see people bring it up after simply getting their shit pushed in so they have to deflect to bad name. It's a really good indication when they have no argument left, which is pretty well shown by the fact neither of you have talked about the initial subject after my first comment.

Think of a soda brand. Fifty bucks says Coke or Pepsi just popped into your head. That's how advertising works. It's not about selling you something the second you see an ad. It's about making you think of THEIR product versus anyone else's when the time comes that you want it.

It'd be relatively easy with el wire, hard part is getting it to survive the whole fest without coming apart.

Get 2 rune defenders or 2 dragon defenders if you do deep wildy/think you might lose it.

Really not, your shield left half from bandos is just the same as rolling any other rdt drop at bandos, comparing it to bandos regular drops, such as the pet..
---
Wtf, must have gotten it on the tunnel between the GE and Edge

The light puzzle is probably one of the more frustrating things in the game. Also theres an agility section you have to pass at least twice that even at 70 agility you have roughly a 17% success rate.

Woah that's a lot of typing of some dumb shit that doesn't matter. Whole thing is pointless in RuneScape. Let's take dead content and make it EVEN deader by limiting your match up. O and also there's plenty of people smurfing or using friends accounts so these limited number of match up you get aren't even going to be an accurate representation of skill. Have fun lmao
---
No just an anti-semitic dog whistle a la 4 chan breeding grounds
---
Less so but still yes
---
Always has, always will
---
I guess because smithing, crafting, herblore, cooking, firemaking, and construction don't drop clue scrolls?
---
everytime I mention a festival at the GE someone usually chimes in that theyre also going or going to another big one thats going on at the time haha. its pretty cool
---
How do you know the name you want is owned by a banned account?

From the Q&amp;A, it seems like it won't be locked behind a key each time like the giants.

i just used them in place of regular cannonballs
---
if you really want to, just make sure you use for something like slayer, and not on some menial task.
---
Runecrafting, Smithing (Blast Furnace), and Farming (Herb Runs) are the only skills with profitable methods worth doing at early levels
---
Thieving and Agility are technically profitable but not by much, it's just that you profit while doing the best XP/hr method
---
Hunter becomes the best moneymaking skill (unless you count Slayer bossing) after you get Black Chins but it doesn't profit early on.
---
Yeah the luring part with Zanik is one of the more fun "challenges" even if it isn't very difficult.
---
Maybe he's jealous

It was about bringing political stuff into the game not necessarily that Wolf was tryna force gay acceptance down peoples throat

You can trivialize any game by watching a step for step walkthrough, if you want to challenge yourself then just don't use the guides.

Think about all the gear you don't have and need and all the players like you that are in that position.
---
it's kind of hard to see against the ui border, but there's a little clue scroll bubble that points you to the exact spot you need to dig. drag the map in that direction to see where you need to go. you then go to that spot. when you're nearby, runelite will highlight the exact place you need to dig.

for whatever reason you get less points if you have dream mentor bosses enabled without having the desert treasure bosses enabled. i'm trying to find an official source but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4tiztt/so_just_did_dream_mentornmz_now_sucks/d5hpq6w/) reddit thread is the only thing i can find, sorry.
---
I had my account recovered about a month and a half ago through authenticator and I lost everything that I had on me which was a tbow and a lance. Turns out they didn't get through my bank pink so I kept my cash stack and all of my armour and stuff. And I'm not the only one, many players with big banks have been hacked recently. Right now nobody wants to take big ticket items out of the bank unless you legit have billions across multiple accounts. Many of my friends sold their scythes and tbows about month ago and spent all their money on buyable skills because it's safer since it's harder to get through the bank pin right now than authenticator. 
---
This is an example of what has been happening for the past 2 months or so.

---
Yeah dude, just a different political opinion, Jews controlling America is just a difference in opinion my dude.
---
Honestly, we should just debate Nazis in the marketplace of ideas just like the Americans did in the 1940s.
---
So, when you open the minimap somewhere on the borders will be a clue scroll, follow it until you can see its location
---
For example, if the clue is on the eastern border, keep moving the camera east until you find where it is on the map
---
Yeesh. No ones bagging on the soldiers, bud. Obviously the focus is on US military recruiters and their sketchy tactics. No need to show us all your hard-on for the soldiers, we can tell you’re plenty patriotic.
---
Pity, it looks like you got the account after they cashed out.
---
You can save the crates in your bank as well, the loot is decided when you open the crates as opposed to when you earnt them. So feel free to smash out 99 fm straight away and you can open the crates later on when your levels are higher for better rewards. 99 capes give decent defensive bonuses and while fm isn't too useful I guess the infinite light source is neat for the qpc grind.

Not brain dead enough to get tobacco in my eyes.

Logged out 36 hours ago in the middle of a slayer task and when i logged in again, half my gear was gone, but someone had banked my inventory. checked my bank and half my money was gone and there were like 20 placemarkers in bank for bonds. I have now added an authenticator and changed password. have i been hacked? I can see no reason how this could have happened.
---
Nah people are blatantly anti military in this thread when it’s the same army that saved half the world from evil and poverty. Every moron who thinks otherwise and repeats age old lies about this country deserves a lot worse then to be called mean things online.

---
Yeah you’re way to into this. Go do something with your life loser. You literally went scrolling through my profile to find some shit to comment about lmao. Fucking nut.

30% of people who volunteer for the US military do so specifically for killing innocent people? that's quite the statement.

As a filthy alt player, there are certain things that seem abstract when you go about designing an alt. Mostly you adapt a common alt to you play-style.
---
E.g. a garg alt, you take a nose-peg to the tower, drop it when safe, camp full guthan's on crush and don't over invest in gear/time, that is, glory/dragon boots/cb brace obsidian/skill-cape. 
---
Practically you look like a bot, but the time spent questing or getting a fire cape is mostly never worth it, and even though the profits mean you could easily use a tort/prims that money is often better spent flipping/on buy-ables than sitting on a semi-afk alt gaining only a +1 max hit.
---
I'm only putting this out there because I've talked about this A LOT with other players who have no idea people play alts at all, in-game. 
---
That isn't to say these aren't bots, i don't know personally, probably are. But there are A LOT of alt players who look like bots.
---
Ye just gimp that
---
Wait, can you not use diamond/ruby dragon bolts with a such?
---
Wouldn't you like to know what I'm doing with my meat. You nosy Bastard.
---
I think this is toggleable so it might not be there for the guy you’re replying to
---
Full time for now, unless I happen to get a job IRL then I'll probably still be grinding but streaming less. Oh and I might slightly shift focus to classic WoW once it's released, at least for a while. But I have no interest in it's beta.
---
But if you're still interested the channel name is "DelVision", currently main focus is on Ultimate Ironman, but I also have HC IM, Normal Skiller and couple pures under work (atm Magic and Melee, might add ranger to mix soon).. Just recently got back from not playing the game for 10 years, and been enjoying my multiple projects so far.

The U.S. military is the biggest social welfare program in the country right now. Might as well be pure Socialism. Join up, get free job training in a career of your choice, food and housing and medical care is paid for, and you can get a guaranteed education on top of all of that. If you want to cry that the American military is evil you still can't deny that military is a great ticket out of poverty for millions of Americans. And it also provides an excellent path to citizenship for foreigners. I feel like more people should look at it from this point of view. But nah they also expect you to do a bare minimum of work to recieve these benefits so fuck all that right? Better to just got right into college and get debt and whine online about how unfair the economic situation in America is.
---
What about the wiki?
---
It doesbt make it better  it would be an inconvenience to their user base

I believe the reason they don't stack is because they all have a different amount of rolls. I might be wrong about this though, someone should check it.

It's not for everyone but shit, I'm halfway through a degree, able to save a decent amount every month, paid off my car, and by the time my contract is up, I'll have enough experience for a decent job in the aerospace industry. Not to mention I have no debt whatsoever.

That was the plan.

---
And no, I'm not a spoiled shit who got everything for free in life. I've been completely independent since I turned 18 and I've sacrificed a lot to get myself to the position I am in today.

It's possible to do, I've dabbled in app development myself. Not a conventional thing to do, though.
---
When I was using konar and got dags at waterbirth I would look for this small room Midway through the dungeon with two ranging daganoth in it. Bring melee gear with high prayer and a cannon and just attack those two over and over while praying range. They drop untradables that alch for 50k and some hides that are worth a fair bit as well as the fremnick helms that are all worth a fair bit. Could break even on task.

Not sure why you are getting downvoted. The importance of energy security has played in determining US foreign policy is notable and the effects that energy independence will have over this is the whole premise of [The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMq-OREx5Zw&amp;t=), although this ignores lobbying.
---
Yeah I recorded it, I’ve done it on my zerk/main/med
---
This was the first time I had to do the agility route through the dungeon, of course I had the longest path known to man. Basically I had my main follow under whatever tunnel I was jumping across incase I did fall, and the monkeys would be aggrod on my main -all fine and great until the last part of the dungeon with the archers, if I fell I pretty much got one hit by them
---
Took like 2-3 hours just to get to kurk, the fight lasted about 30 seconds lol 
---
Platform went slow slow slow and didn’t get caught once, uh killing the Gorillas before glough easy - just let Nieve kill them and hide behind the wall... glough was simple hit and run. 
---
Hardest part was the first dungeon w/the agility
---
Looks about right
---
People are upset because this came out of nowhere, they can't discuss it with jagex or offer feedback before the poll going live. Voting on a poll is not giving feedback. This is also making quests significantly easier for no reason, which has been the only consistent thing jagex has done since runescape was conceived
---
Bored, and time to kill at work
---
Unrelated but how do you change your tab graphics? (invent,friends list,skills, etc.)

How do I do that. Suggest some money makers.

Hmmmmm it's really weird how the more we invade these countries the more terrorist cells seem to be created and go on to attack us. Really helping to support your argument there.
---
I agree. Anyway war is life and death, not a fucking computer game. The male body can do things the female body can’t in war I.e. greater power, endurance and speed....this is science and biology not sexism, it only makes sense for the fittest to be enlisted. If your a trans on cocktail of steroids I’m pretty sure you’re not going to perform at your best.

While I am definitely not on Israels side, you are very poorly informed on the Israel situation.
---
Yeah all those engineers and healthcare professionals tick all of the boxes above don't they. Honestly it's such a dumb assumption, makes it very easy to tell you've never been involved.
---
&gt;You don't care about the military or the security of our country
---
Hi. I spent 6 years in the Army and served one 9 month tour in a combat zone.
---
What have you done?
---
I have my positions based on my experience in the military itself. I have seen how readiness standards have fallen through the years first hand.
---
This is just perfect
---
So kids make up stupid names and then these funny pictures pop up?
---
Imagine women are literally **half** as good at everything in the military that men are. A military force made up of 1 million men and 1 million women is still going to be 150% as effective as a force of just 1 million men.
---
Reported for stealing valor, I'll see you on Fox News buddy.

Morgan Freeman once said:

“How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time.”
---
It got absolutely nothing to do with your post, but I find it amazing! 
---
Oh yeah, I hear the picture too btw :’-)
---
Considering the enemy uses underhanded means aka using civilians at meat shields, you think the enemy gives any less fucks than those “30% of American soldiers”?
---
Nice additions to the Lumberjack outfit, looks nice
---
this comment betrays your utter lack of knowledge on this topic
---
What's their alternative? Record obesity levels plus young men are a little more emasculated than they used to be. So it's difficult to recruit, godda find them somewhere!
---
Are you still collecting data on a drop table rework?
---
 The jmods said multiple times as far back as 2 years ago they begun collecting data on the drops.
---
Yea, some talking skeleton will say "you have to conquer this maze which has taken armies hundreds of years!". Then you see a crack in a wall and behind it a button which clears everything.
---
It's not a fact most people like to accept though for some reason.
---
Sorry what I meant was orange man good, make america great again.

Level 125 here, still using Torso

I think part of the charm is the basic graphics, keep that kind of shallow stuff to RS3 i think

Some would say paying for membership with RL cash is a waste of time.

Is that you Rainforest

"Botting clients" everyone just uses mirrors these days anyway.

u/La-z-OSRS any comment?
---
This is misleading, some gamers are actually fairly educated.
---
F2P player, with most of my skills hovering around 40 (except runecraft and mining), just started the 7 day trial. Advice on things I should do, especially to earn gp?
---
Can you link it
---
weed helps with staying inside
---
I mention that so fresh accounts cant abuse a max house with all the teleports on w330 for example.
---
Of course you will not do barrows if you're a main with stats to farm zulrah/vorkath. The point here is that a free teleport to barrows in a maxed house would be a straight upgrade to the gp/h and would kill making  the teletabs as an alternative training/money making method
---
I see you bought the “Extra Hours in a Day” pack. It’s so damn sad that this game is slowly getting filled with MTX.
---
Very cool overall, but the cape is boring. It's so lifeless and bland with 100% single colour. If Brimhaven blue cape is already one huge pixel chunk, I cannot imagine how completely black looks like.
---
If I have to tweak black graceful cape, I'd change [graceful cape's black silhouette](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/b/ba/Graceful_cape_equipped.png?7e071) to red and white template to black just like on the picture. Result would be similar with Obsidian cape but way fancier.

When doing limpwurt roots during your herb runs, is it more profitable to use regular or ultra compost?

That shit don't kill you though

I failed GCSE maths bro don’t do this to me
---
I'm 4.5 put of my 5 lol. I feel your pain. And I just extended for another half year last month. I should probably talk to someone for the abuse I just put myself through lmao
---
He last messaged me 940 PST.
---
I cannot imagine the dedication how much crap you went through to accomplish this.
---
But it was worth it - you did something which many cannot even imagine doing. Well done! You got an amazing Void ranger build done! :D
---
Not at all lol?
---
It took you a week of gathering wines to buy a 14 day membership, but working 1 hour IRL could buy you a month of membership. and give you the other 6 days to do what you want on the game. Unless you want to collect wines of zammies?
---
A recruiter once tried talking me into signing up via Tinder. Told her I can’t because I have webbed feet and a huge cock. She told me to prove it... so I sent her an X-ray pic of a foot I found on google
---
You do know the "real" black market exists where legitimate people actually do firecapes and inferno capes for people. Why would you trust some random bum on the internet. If you would have actually researched yourself about the blackmarket you would have found a ton of trusted and vouched people, some even holding world record firecapes with unique accounts. Hell if you even know rendi mento who achieved the lowest cmb lvl firecape, he himself is on the black market!!! Doing firecapes for people....so i dont see how you can just trust someone without any vouches or anything
---
This is why you have a trusted website do it for you. No need to give them your pin either.
---
Yeah, on an ironman you wanna pool between kills to save on prayer pots and food, so you lose scrolls overtime.
---
18m and those stats eh
---
That's how I feel too. I don't like the idea of glorifying the military. You sign up to be a hero, but then you see first hand what kind of shit you've gotten yourself into. Not exactly what you might have had in mind. Of course not all, perhaps mostly all, soldiers have been scarred from the military. Even so, I quite dislike how they advertise it. However, recruitment should absolutely be voluntary rather than a draft. I'm pretty much 50/50 on the military... advertising to be a hero is bullshit (mostly?) but voluntary participation is necessary.
---
imagine posting edgy comments unrelated to the OP on a subreddit for a childrens game
---
Wow. That's fucked up. I'd recommend directly contacting a moderator and ask if there is anything that can be done and stay off that account until you get a response - given your account entirely unique and insanely progressed I think it's worth an attempt. Best of luck mate
---
f2p clanning is actually in a good place
---
These are all good points. There are 1000s of things I should have done, but as the post says, it’s my mistake and I take responsibility for it. My experience with people from this sub have been really awesome, and he used the guise of this community to make me trust him. I appreciate your feedback though man. I hope it helps someone
---
I’m an idiot man. I know I know I know I know
---
70 def, not 65. Med levels are about 90-106 cmb, what's the point in the best armour you can wear being Bandos? Barrows is the norm for meds.
---
You couldn’t win a fight if it was with your kid sister over the last juice box. There’s more manhood and gusto in the taint hairs of one US army vet than in the entirety of your male lineage. I bet you keep a stack of Seventeen magazine under your bed to look at after you and your girlfriends are done braiding each other’s hair.
---
Exactly. Medium level account, 90-106 cmbish.
---
They are likely goldfarmers from Venezuelan/Indonesia/China etc. with limited knowledge of the game
---
Pretty much the only farming I do, I visit the guild 2-3 times a day to finish contracts and check my tree/fruit tree/herb/Hespori when necessary. I'm at 92 farming atm.
---
Bro I'm just hovering my mouse over passerbys, and I have drop party experience.
---
And get pets to be more realistic, pure genius mr bots
---
Ahh makes sense. :)
---
Compost does not affect yield from Limpwurt roots, so it's only about the effect of the plant dying or not.
---
Jagex haven't released the disease chance for Limpwurts (or other flowers), but [this](https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/905855565137633287) may be of use.
---
In short, probably best to use Ultracompost for better chance of the plant surviving and you being able to get the Limp Roots.
---
I've seen you in the high risk world a few times. Wish they weren't so dead.
---
The 70 def is for piety, not barrows. You can use it but you will be a magnet for high level accounts and lower levels wont fight because they cant hit.
---
You you
---
I’m not going to entertain this bullshit.
---
Range is waaay waay better. I had a black dragons task and took lance, slayer helm, etc. I also brought my low-mid level alt with a DHCB, to help out and carry extra supplies. The instead of making the task go faster, the alt kept getting the kills...
---
The downside is you have to carry all those expensive bolts through the wildy.
---
What’s their to discuss?
---
A lot of people on this sub lack basic reading comprehension...
---
I replied to one kinda recently, but if you watch the new section it happens a lot.
---
I just assumed as with most sub-Reddit’s that names / photos have to be blacked out so went with that.
---
A new day = atleast 1 new ignore in ge.
---
Why waste tick when few word do trick
---
Those could just be alts
---
Can you not see how this would mess with Skilling rates? Imagine mass dropping iron invs in one click, and that's just the first thing that popped into my head.
---
Calm down Satan
---
I read to always use a slayer helm (i) for slayer tasks, except when you're fighting an undead monster and can use full void with a salve ammy (ei)  
---
Is this true in all cases? If so, should I just be switching combat types where it's relevant to, like if I am fighting something that would be best killed with melee, should I do that?
---
Haha not sure if I could function playing video games on weed
---
Nothing will happen and rightly so.
---
Why do you think mainland US isn’t getting invaded, we’re out there stopping them before they get the chance
---
Sorry, just trying to give you the dad perspective, or speech. Honestly beating yourself up is almost enough I think to get you to learn. No one can be trusted. It sucks it hurts, but you can do it, watch some streamers. Btw I'm mostly deaf myself so I can understand part of the issue in just completing the game, I spend most of my time gaming in utter silence.
---
And yet the spoilers are on a reddit post hmmm
---
sulphur lizards in konars dungeon counts as lizards and doesn't require ice box
---
can we impliment a thieving NPC in prifdinnas that offers medium clues, it wouldnt impact current methods too much as it will be locked behind such a high requirement.
---
Perfect? I would say it's far from perfect.
---
I like it
---
The irony of the OSRS community shitting on the US military.
---
And that opportunity cost is entirely unrelated to the EHP of tree runs.
---
Had this when i used to play call of duty for a long time of period.

I would see like through the sniper scope.

I think it's sort of your breain remembering and imaging while still being occupied with the load of pictures you gave it of just one subject.

Ive had it before with FIFA game, as well as the chicken factory i worked in. Seriously id see the passing band with the chicken when id close my eyes at any time during the day. It was horrible
---
How about a direct link from the post login page that brings us to the poll?
---
\*login, click a button, poll interface pops up\*
---
Yes I know but I was just talking in the sense of armour because 65 def doesn't unlock prayers :) and it's pointless have 65 when you can get 5 more def lvls and get tank armour etc. can't say I've ever seen a med level with 65 prayer and no Piety, renders the account pretty useless unless you just wana bully pures.
---
I have a Piety med myself, 95 cmb and I fight pures and higher meds to maxed mains(doesn't go too well vs maxed mains most of the time aha)
---
Drops? Could be instant delete all instead.
---
You can't use overheads with 22 prayer
---
fast theving xp I'm assuming for knights or something.
---
If you’ve done a few hundred kc of vork he has given plenty of head ;) no need to worry about losing one
---
I wonder if you know you're LARPing or actually buy into this stuff. Hilarious either way.
---
They do but not using other already available colours I think, just lighter and darker shades.
---
Exactly. The Army is actually building “competitive esports” teams. I’m in the discord. They’re putting it as a USARC assignment (Recruitment). Shit one of my soldiers was going to go TDY for a fortnite tournament down in Dallas this month but got cancelled cause not enough competitors.
---
400+ and counting, was gunna buy white graceful today but I’ll hold out.
---
Only 90/90/83 in melee and 99 ranged so not sure it would be better but will give it a try, thanks
---
Yeah I'm speaking for *all* gamers though, not just the osrs community. This community is particularly bad about that kind of thing, although I still believe that "Easily manipulated ✅ Hate minorities ✅ Lack of education ✅ Lack of direction in life ✅"  is a huuuuge over generalization. I mean yeah its common to see someone being racist online but it's not like the majority or even anywhere close to the majority of players in any game show these traits, plus I would be willing to bet that in many cases the person is just trolling and not actually a hateful person. I believe it's just a vocal minority that gives that impression
---
memeing, its something redditors say on a lot of left wing subs which i frequent.
---
Jesus Christ dude 107 slayer and not even reading the dialogue for xp rewards?? Come on..

Boys and bois.

Please, can I just take your order...

You don’t disagree then, you just didn’t get what I was saying

There are soooo many hcim who restart when they lose their hc status.

Not that I would want to restart...

Or you could just call it advertising.

Recycled post

what brand of peanut butter do u bathe in?  Do u use a kerosene powered or electric heater to melt it?

No I see the puzzle as the whole scenario including getting agroed. It's testing your patience and ability to think under pressure.
---
We’ve fought nothing but proxy wars in the Middle East for the the past 15 years. We’ve fought insurgencies with practically no projection capabilities, that’s way different than fighting a war with a functioning, organized military that has the backing of Russia and China who imports around 9-11% of their oil from Iran. That’s way different than fighting ISIS or the Taliban in a country that is theoretically on our side like Iraq or Afghanistan. Do you realize we haven’t fought a war against a country with a functioning air force or navy in that amount of time?
---
Just because our public probably doesn’t want a war in Iran doesn’t mean Iran isn’t prepared for one. It just means that if there is a war we won’t be as prepared. This oil tanker is just one incident in a long history that builds tension.
---
God forbid the Marines try to recruit new men/women by appealing to their interests. Must be some evil propaganda so we can throw them into war like soulless bodies.
---
rapid heal pure I see! Good choice.

Yeah but the difference there is Vorkath would be 2-3 hours for a bond in comparison to the 7 days of zammy wines.

### AN ILLUSION,WHAT ARE YOU HIDING!?

Damn, it took me 1500 from bronze to rune lmao.

duuuuuuuude

This is exactly why most people dont understand efficiency.

Yet you post a bunch on t_d without being banned. It's impossible to do that without joining the circlejerk.
---
Time to leave the house
---
yes please
---
So tell us? What reason would he have to pick you of all people and just make up this story, while submitting proof of messages that match your exact username? I was expecting your first response to saying something like, "you have the wrong person" or "this isn't me" but providing no reasons why this post is wrong and instead trying to pull the you can't prove it was me honestly makes me believe this post more.
---
I mean it’s a pretty low fence
---
Hi, i wasn't being totally serious.  However, I said if you think advertising and not a specific advertisement that you are aware of and rebelling against because you noticed it.
---
When you saw this reddit post, did u immediately think "I will never join the USMC because of this ad!" or even think of it as an ad?  Well most people didnt and some of those people are going to join the military and some of those are going to be picking the USMC because of ads like this one.  The people who think theyre too smart to fall for marketing tricks are the ones who also think they just know best and dont need to consider alternative options.  Theyll just go with gut feeling and that gut is partially the product of advertisements.
---
but this is lumbridge
---
I bet your family indoctrinated you with nonsense since you were a kid.
---
When you say "thank you for your service" to a vet, you're actually thanking them for gunning down all the tower defense enemies before they get a chance to reach the mainland and steal a life.
---
Notice how you aren’t providing any evidence to anything you’re saying? That’s called being ignorant. Go shine some boots, soldier boy.
---
honestly not much of a spoiler, this man max a UIM and got 85 slayer through temple trekk, we knew the moment he hit that 29 hunter he'd be 99 in no time
---
So true
---
Can't wait for the PK vid! This is gonna be a SICK account
---
Thank you for spelling it out for his stupid monkey brain.
---
This ain’t madden Devil.  No one gets lvl 99 agility and only one player ever got 99 speed.
---
bro people here still think mep2 is hard
---
this shit would make the quest cape almost respectable
---
obviously group ironmen i swear
---
This is correct
---
Yeah it is, bud
---
Fair enough, completely forgot about chivalry. Have you ever actually seen one of these builds? What do they wear pking, Dragon?
---
Honestly can't say I've ever seen this build.
---
It's called RNG and averages.
---
80 revs is a tiny sample size, especially when big drops like the Ancient Relic are super-rare (1/44k from Imps, 1/8k from Dragons, both unskulled).
---
I always pick everything on my ironman since I can probably use it to protect something else but on my main I couldn't really be bothered except for coconuts.
---
Agility every 10 or 20 levels you have a new set of options to train. 55 do you wanna go wildy for no money, canifis for money, or falador for somewhere in between runecrafting you can craft bloods, lavas, steams, tiaras, or use abyss or zeah library all using pretty different methods but in the end I get to choose how to train. With slayer you're going to go to the same master every time to give you a task you have to do what they tell you. Whether you get to get the monster you want is completely up to rng and if you don't like it well you better be down to temple trek to 99 at 7k xp/hr. Even fm you can choose what you're burning, even at wt are you gonna be healing the pyromancer? Are you gonna be fletching or going for just straight fm xp? It's your decision.
---
Whether or not slayer could be called a "minigame" or "miniquest" or "sidequest" or whatever just a different way of training combat is a more complicated question of game design and the exact definitions of those things but the reason I called it a minigame was because its just a specific way of training combat with a reward system for doing so. What do you call the patrols in destiny? idk but other games have stuff like this and it's never such an integral part of the game nor does it deserve to be one in rs.
---
And if you don't think I'm right that people wouldn't train it if it wasn't good money just look at any noob. They don't train Slayer cause slayer sucks and most people only start training it when they find out it's good money.
---
Why does this remind me of squidward lol
---
I suppose you missed the point where i said, you adapt alts to your needs - I can only spare a few clicks per min to interact with an alt so a Garg alt hits those reqs easily, anything more BBD,RD,GWD,raids etc isn't viable. As for Fcape/gloves - that's a no from me, my current Garg alt build gains only 1+ max hit from a FC, and the time sunk into questing will take something like 40m+ exp across all melee's (shared) to recover. Neither are worth it on a macro level.
---
Def a scam, I've already won and got all the money
---
According to the poll its a course that maxes out around 62k an hour at 90 agility. I assume it will be at least partially roof top because in the rs3 (hiss, I know) version, you climb around and reach the roof tops in theirs. 
---
I only mention the rs3 course because we are getting a chest for Crystal Keys with better items in it than the original which rs3 also got. It will require upgrading the keys first at least. More parallels and what not.

Question regarding Zulrah on a Zerker - Should I sell tormented bracelet and buy an imbued heart? 
---
I have 91 magic and therefore would be able to cast venge, plus the more consistent hits. Assuming torm bracelet is essentially for the higher max hit? I pose this question as I don't have the monies for both.
---
Tormented bracelet or imbued heart (and venge) at Zulrah on a zerk?
---
Add 6 Jad challenge to the puzzle but you can't attack the jads, you have to tick eat and recoil them down 1 by 1 while solving the puzzle
---
Mistakes happen in the form of misreads all of the time.  It doesn't mean he deserves to lose the progress from thousands of hours on an account.  You say that like he had it coming.
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I'm looking for!
---
Have fun fighting diabetes in your mum's flat
---
OVL was not tradeable back in rs2 so i probably thinking it will be the same.
---
But why 20 black pickaxes?
---
I was today years old when I learned that.
---
Just plug it all in and use octopus. It'll work
---
Yup same. Last run got hit for 30, 28, 30 then my phone didn’t register my click and I didn’t fully dodge the sky meatball. Still haven’t logged in to collect my shit 😂
---
Looks like a lost Lt to me.
---
4?! I thought i had it bad at 2. Still haven’t got dwh too so best of luck to the both of us.
---
It'll stabilize around 1-1.1b.
---
Tbow around 1b. 
---
Don't panic sell. People are selling gear to rwt aswell as more people bossing so price usually dips around this time.
---
Shilo gem bots drive me insane. Trying to get some quick jades for necklace of passages and they log in with their 80+ mining, clear every rock and instantly hop. They usually have just the stats to get shilo village quest done.
---
I tried it for a week when I was making my acc from zerk to med. Literally the only thing I changed from 42 to 65/70 def is helm to neitiz and def to dragon. Dont need anything else for pvp if you wanna profit a bit without trying to hard. I pk like this [http://prntscr.com/o3vu3c](http://prntscr.com/o3vu3c) or msb to ags/maul/claws.
---
Haha oops yeah I screwed up. I was supposed to talk Snowflake, but I just did both the quests so it's all good now.
---
Sure, if you exclusively do gatherers a gargoyle alt is better. If you can't do ToB while doing crafting on your main that's your problem lol
---
how was odesza?
---
I love how he's introduced in this episode by PKing Rendi.
---
Why not bring a magic pot?
---
You only lose that money if you sell it...
---
&gt;i would try and match the shape of my shit to an item
---
like with your hands?
---
Of course and I understand that but I am not talking about rare drops, I am talking about regular drops with a 1/6 chance. I seriously get nothing and lose money due to supplies.
---
This is taking place on the 2200 total worlds, that's why this interaction lacks social cues
---
Never sell when the item tanks this much. My only hope to make that much back is a duo scythe split. So hold I shall.
---
you would if you could too
---
The titles literally says "when was this even a thing??", it TELLS you what XP it will give you and he seems to have ignored it more than once because it sounds like he's done it on another account with prayer and not taken note of what it does and he's done it on a 1 prayer account because he didn't take the time to read it properly. Can't see any reason for Jagex to reset his XP.
---
the man has like 150m in bird nests wtf?
---
I see a lot of people meme 2.2k worlds for being antisocial/elitist.
---
I maxed last week with fletching as my last skill. I was impatient and decided to blast out the last 300k with addy darts but hit my limit. I asked people at the GE to help me get dart tips and there ended up being like 5 randoms who hung around and Gratzed me and went to virgin island after etc.
---
I didn’t plan on having a max party in 2019, but it felt nice.
---
I do tears to level mine lmao
---
Let's face it, 99% of what people call "AFK" is not actually a task you can do away from your keyboard.
---
I did it on mobile two days ago. 
---
2x times tabbing to wiki for under 30 seconds killed game app
---
Like 10x times gorillas would spawn out of nowhere or teleport to you
---
The prayer flicking for ranged attackers was very difficult, mistapping sent you into danger unprotected.
---
I burned two rings of life 
---
But all and all it wasn't the worst. Can totally be done. Just takes a bit longer.
---
[tip.it](https://tip.it) used to be pretty good too
---
My naaaame is Count the Count
---
Which drops are 1/6 other than the Bracelet (Dragons)?
---
If you can't handle missing out on drops on a tiny sample size, then you're best off sticking to money-makers which have a regular rate (e.g. Skilling/Green Dragons/Farming).
---
I doubt 10% of the player base flips
---
Bro how high are you
---
Good point
---
I get that when I play puzzle games. I had one game in which you had to move certain blocks to complete a puzzle and that's all I saw for days
---
I'll let 1st sgt know you want to reenlist again
---
This was literally me when I tried to kill Jad the first 3 times. My hand legit shook like I was about to be hung if I failed.
---
God I love trailer park boys... hahaha
---
A new chest for Crystal Keys in OSRS? Better buy them out then
---
How did you manage to not get 1 shot? Without overheads isn't his max hit well above your hp level?
---
Nope, I am Greek Australian, not Jewish!
---
This might actually be the only thing that makes sense in the game.. I mean look how low that fence is
---
Fuuuuuuuuuucccckkkkkkk oooooffffff nazi
---
Everyone's bad at some point, just takes practice. It legitimately took me, without exaggeration, over 80 tries to kill Zulrah for the first time. Now I have over 1k kc. Most pvm in OSRS is just muscle memory.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀I know right BRO 🦀🦀🦀🦀🙏🙏😌😌😌😂😂😂😂🙏😂😂🙏🙏😂😂🙏😂🦀🦀🦀🦀

Rendi and Swamp are easily the best osrs content creators atm imo

The only other scenario is you playing 2 or more alts, which you never mentioned. Either you're shit at the game or you're incredibly socially inept (probably both).  The fact that you're alting gargs in the first place tells me enough tbh. Keep inbox downvoting btw, it's really aiding you in lookin like an autistic manchild.

Curious what you're using gear wise and food wise. I don't get hit by ghosts or pools and still don't generally manage more than 11-12 max a trip because of running out of supplies.

Not necessarily but the US military should not be glorified in any way. Plus I don't think they need any bootlickers like you defending them on reddit.

I HATE YOU

Have fun. Enjoy every shit like it's your last. That bathroom is your kingdom now.

I think he meant that now it will look like the stats he already has were obtained with the use of protection prayers

Holy shit they actually did

True, but the guy I am replying to is probably American and cares about American values, he should be reminded that Americans killed Nazis in WWII

With all the sitting on ass, mobile OSRS must’ve been a god sent

Why dont you fuck off back to your clown hovel nazi

Literally all four of them have fire cape though.

With a minimum wage effectively half of most of the civilized world, and no guarantee of any benefits such as health insurance. And that's assuming you actually get a full time job and not some "gig economy" fake-freelancing work that allows companies to effectively pay even less than the minimum wage, work that one third of all US workers are now reliant on, and yet our corrupt bureaucracy doesn't include all those people in the unemployment/underemployment stats because of the absurd notion that an Uber driver is an independent contractor.
---
Just get an education, so that you can get a better job, right? Assuming you can even qualify for the loans in question, and survive while juggling work and education with whatever other responsibilities you have, then you get to enjoy a practically lifelong debt.  Another thing people in other countries find absurd.

I would say: Why should a method that involves Hunting Birds and works very much like Hunter not give Hunter xp? Only because it happened to be released before Hunter was?  
---
It's also worth noting that I did say XP when plucking chompies, which is not required nor efficient if you are doing the hat/diary grind. But it'd be something extra you could do if you want a tiny amount of xp and feathers.
---
So how would you tackle the botting problem if you were in the position to make changes?

Nice ty

Thanks for the reply. I also read that magic void is shit apparently. For tasks like dust devils that I use mage on, should I not use mage void? And instead just use regular gear with a slayer helm (i) please?

Yeah because after Trump is gone your LARPing group will just dissolve into the ether like the Tea Party and other sad reactionary movements that flare up and die off after their doomsday predictions don't pan out.

Yikes yeah you should probably just end you’re life at that point.
---
Yeah i realised lately PvM weapons have been dropping rapidly including the blowpipe from 6m to 3m lol. Thanks a lot for the feedback, glad you enjoyed the video :)
---
Rooftop agility course in Meiyerditch or on top the vampire castles in that area is the only fitting content i could see this coming from. Would be cool to have a new high level agility course in that area and also would make it not super common like white grace
---
Well, the levels can always be tweaked. I figured this should be a very high requirement, since Spirit trees start at 83 (91 to plant two, and 99 for 3+). Making them part of the regular spirit tree count would also be possible.

I game on a laptop. Alt tabbing out of games is annoying cause they struggle to play in the first place.
---
I stopped using the radio in high school. I listen to what I want to instead. All streaming services I use are ad-free. Haven't lived in a house with cable ever in my life because I was poor as a kid &amp; now cable is declining.
---
Parents muted the TV during commercials as a kid (religiously) so I guess it just kind of stuck. I avoid ads like the plague. They're specifically so annoying because the format can't sell me on anything. It's flawed from the ground up for me.
---
I used to say "tip dot eye tee."
---
Nah man, I've just been around plenty of guys like you, and I used to want that too. Then I realized how lucky my guys and I were that none of us got shot at. Sure it meant I never did my job, but it's not good to need to patch your friends up ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Yeah, I try not to talk about military shit outside military subreddits because most people have this twisted view of the military, especially the US one but sometimes it just gets to me lol.
---
I would like to see clue scrolls added to Hunter and Runecrafting
---
Easy to reach isn’t really a justification I think. If it was me I would do Konar until you hit 100cb. Slayer doesn’t become consistently profitable until 70-80s. With Konar you get brimstone keys on task which allow you to open a chest with rewards ranging from 1-700k and you can get multiple keys per task
---
Well of course, I  feel lucky in that I didnt get shot or see my friends die. But I also really wanted to fight.
---
Isn’t a poll’s literal purpose to hater feedback?

Grats dude. I'm sitting here waiting on mine to be born also.

I don't get what's funny or hard to believe about that.

The strenuous part? You don't think marines work hard?
---
The traumatizing part? You don't think there's a high prevalence of diagnosed and diagnosed PTSD in combat veterans?
---
The life threatening part? No marines ever get killed?  
---
If you're a marine and it's actually a cake walk I'd love if you could set the record straight
---
I can’t see the black fitting in with much in the elf city though, with everything being crystal and green and shit. Black I feel would come more from the Tzharr, maybe Lunar/Frem, or the vampyres
---
lol yeah man, totally a nazi. 100% no discussion.

because nothing says 'nazi' like interpreting the facts slightly differently than you and walking away with a different conclusion. You're whats wrong with this political climate. You're the problem.

Does it really matter when you can drive from Digby to Sydney in a day?

Eb and flow is perfectly healthy yes, but only when eb comes with flow. If we are experiencing deflation at uncharacteristic times, for uncharacteristic durations that could well be an economy health issue, for example, Summer and the lead up has always been an inflating force, it is very unusual to still have deflation. 
---
I wonder what the cause could be, bots is potentially a contributing factor but in no means a valid answer for the whole question, is it saturation of irons and lack of mains? Mobile player bubble slowly bursting? Seems unlikely to effect high end items. The deflation alone is not an issue, but uncharacteristic deflation points to something unusual occurring, potentially something problematic for the health of OSRS’s economy
---
It's crystal math labs thing

&gt;Personally I'd rather play one hour (or less) extra per week to make it a free game. 
---
He didnt farm zammy wine for an extra hour though... it was much, much more than that...
---
Skips some of the time leveling stats, less likely to be reported or banned due to likely looking more like a regular account, and most importantly: what else are you going to do with an account after you've cleaned it? Might as well put it to use
---
Yes because that’s exactly what the military is like. Drill Sergeants yelling at you all day every day.
---
Best idea yet, agility with a bit of danger, maybe the vampires could come after you so it’s hard to AFK.
---
That skeleton is the derpiest skeleton of them all
---
What is the meaning of life?
---
I thought about this, actually. They could just be a part of the same 'spirit tree count' and require the same levels (83 for the first one, 91 for the second one, 99 for the rest). I'm ok with either!
---
Gz man. No xp waste
---
Pmod here what’s up

Just want to say if any of are are in 2nd mardiv stand the fuck by for some more fun that's about to come down the chain

I think a Tzharr one would work, not sure about lunar as I see that as light grey but the vampire idea would work also

Or equip the mirror shield and win the game.

It’s also probably nothing to do with “osrs” team. They’re great and I think a lot of people instantly look at them for answers in which they have no control in. But I wouldn’t even say that is a tinfoil theory. It’s pretty likely.

I was actually thinking about this whole thing earlier today wondering if everyone had forgotten already. Not disappointed, Reddit.
---
How can you say we paid for it, yet it is superior? I guarantee you I know more about the IDF and the Israeli cyber army (Unit 8200) than you.
---
Their fighter jets are all manufactured in the US by Lockheed Martin, Boeing and McDonnel Douglas. Their missiles are made in the US by Raytheon. Their tanks come from the US as well. Their standard issue rifle is the FN FAL which is made in Belgium.
---
Did you know their soldiers are issued diapers because they had such a problem with soiling their pants when they actually experienced fire fights? Sounds formidable huh?
---
Sure, they have special forces that are comparable to those in the US,  Russia and China. However their infantry doesn't hold a candle to the other super powers. Hell even untrained civilians with AKs and unguided artillery were able to hold them back from occupying territory in Syria.
---
Historically, if Israeli can't use fighter jets or missiles to take out their targets they rely on US ground troops to do the dirty work.

I’m currently F2P and run wines to fund myself. It’ll take about an hour and a half a day to maintain a bond.

Obviously if you’re P2P you would have far better options, but as a free account it’ll take about 2 weeks with 2 hours a day to get a bond.

Personally I want all the skills to eventually have a pet linked to them. Maybe not the combat skills, but every other skill deserves a pet.

Also this isn't new

That's by far the biggest perk of an overload, being able to brew without repotting. Stripping that away just makes it the same as other potions without repotting, but it wears off so fast you are missing out on an average of 2 levels over the course of 5 minutes. Not even remotely close to what ovls do to combat.
---
GL man! Runescape honestly motivates me. It sucks to play when you know you have something pressing that you're putting off, so I try to get shit done so I can play guilt-free. It also requires a *lot* of focus and discipline. You're completely self-directed and have to set and achieve goals all on your own. I've taken the skills I've learned and improved in runescape and applied them irl.
---
I would love them tbh, would be cool to see fm cape for black chin hunting lol
---
Def cape seems bit op maybe.
---
Might have to give your set up a run just for extended trips. Never really thought about guthans. Hydra has ruined my on trip lengths for things, though.
---
I don't like that I understand this.
---
did it was 86 agility (boost to 91), quest was a cakewalk
---
Why is there a 4 minute video for what is essentially 3 lines of a wiki page
---
And it's already outdated lmao
---
&gt; Except it's not 'blindly-trusted' - being open source means we can literally verify the entirety of the code and see it's not stealing our information.
---
* The only way it isn't blind-trust is if the user personally verifies the source code, and (in the case of no reproducible builds like with RL) manually compiles it; most people are just downloading the pre-compiled binary (some even incorrectly as-per this thread), installing it, and leaving it at that, hence the blind-trust
---
* Most people aren't verifying jack. I'd even go as far to say majority of RL users don't even know where to find the source code at or even care
---
* There's no guarantee the pre-compiled binary and updates people obtain for RL are from the public source code, and afaik RL doesn't do reproducible builds
---
&gt; Again, when people are losing their accounts to a plethora of fake streams, ads, emails and everything else, the problem clearly isn't just a third party client.
---
True, but 3rd-party clients in this case are an easily controllable factor by Jagex. Simply don't allow them. They have a hard stance already on mobile clients and apps which shows they *can* do it.
---
Happened again. Something I’ve just learned about/watched and it makes its way here literally straight after. Just learned the existence of RBMK reactors if anyone’s wondering. Doubt it but, y’know. If anyone’s wondering.
---
Your dad probably did!
---
There's a lot of money in botting so it's a constant arms race and at a certain point a good bot will be nearly indistinguishable from a real player.
---
That's not to say that Jagex is doing as much as they possibly can to combat it, but it's not as simple as it may seem.
---
Niece
---
Just apply to work at Jagex and ban all the bots for them.
---
You would access the dark spirit trees from regular spirit tree network, but they would only allow you to teleport *to* them.
---
The locations could definitely be tweaked. For Ape Atoll, maybe close to the tunnel to Zooknock? For the wilderness, it's been suggested to move it close to the poison spiders.
---
This topic has been beaten to death time and time again. Here is a summary of the results:
---
 - The game's engine is shitty and primitive as *fuuuuck*, so freely-customizable cape colors are not a thing they can do. If anything, they'd have to add a new version of each skillcape item into the game with all the different color combinations, bloating item id's by hundreds, if not thousands.
---
 - It messes with the consistency (and iconic/nostalgia-ness) of the game and dips too far into rs3 territory where everyone's wearing cosmetic overrides and you can't tell wtf is going on anymore
---
 - Why stop at skillcapes? It's a slippery slope. Once we can recolor one piece of gear, people will want the same ability for others. It's a development nightmare and a headache that will never end.
---
 - There currently is a way to keep your first cape untrimmed post-multiple99s, but it's not intended and is a complete oversight by the developers. They've known about it for years and refuse to fix it because it's more trouble than it's worth.
---
The end.
---
Get the Galaxy Fold for easier insertion. At least then it would have an actual use
---
Lmao
---
Really?  Any situation that could use a 20+ heal on a minute cooldown?  That has unlimited uses?  I'd 100% bring it to demonics and vorkath, let alone almost every Slayer task I'd use an SGS or guthans for.
---
I was wondering if it was supposed to be some sort reflex test that looks easy but is actually incredibly hard, but I have no idea what the source is so I can't check. Why else have it outside like that.
---
Either way, still good to test older people more thoroughly on their driving skills to make sure they aren't a danger.

---
I love osrs, but the one thing that is severely lacking for me is the graphics. Yes I do love the nostalgic graphics, but its 2019 and would love to play my character in full HD. 
---
I actually have a near max combat on rs3 that I keep trying to get into for the graphics alone, but rs3 is so bad I just cant enjoy it no matter how hard I try. They really did completely ruin the game. But the graphics of RS3 are so immersive that it makes me jealous playing old school.  Jealous that the garbage that is rs3 gets to bare the title of the main game and be the graphically and engine superior game.

Good question, it’s an inconsistency but the white knight initiates use a white full helm, the same one players can get. We can “cosplay” as a Proselyte with the initiate or Proselyte helm, or the last rank with a Shield of Arrav painted helm.

Obviously it's someone getting rune dragon alts

No other service has a delay but they all require 2fa to remove a 2fa. Jagex only requires 1 to access your account. You can always access any acc with just email access or with a recovery request. Other companies straight up wont let you recover your account without access to two other authenicatoons.

Yeah you definatly should be getting your slayer up. Broad bolts are as strong as addy but much cheaper. A would reccomend looking at afk nmz for training range with a shortbow
---
You have to keep in mind that the effect has a good chance not to trigger before you die, since it requires your hitpoints to be below a certain threshold. Yes, it's powerful, but I'd say this puts the cape in the same class as the more useful skillcapes (Mage, Construction, Crafting...), not strictly above them.

Be able to make cannonballs faster, using the metal press machine used in swan song quest. Can load it with steel bars (300 max) and coal to power it. 1:1 ratio coal:steel bar at a 2.5x faster speed? Can also leave the area and come back later to collect balls when done. Must have ardy hard diary complete or any other. Would help make the process faster for players and not somthing bots could easily get to.

dang i missed it :(

Sorry for your loss, man. I'm sure he appreciated having a friend like you.
---
To be honest, the chance to get the same task again feels odd and against the spirit of slayer. Instead, why not something like being twice as likely to get a boss task while wearing the cape? As a master slayer, you need a challenge!
---
Is it a trick or a glitch? I’ve had hydra drop me an empty jug supposedly
---
Thanks for saying that. I haven't done it on osrs yet, but remember doing it on rs2 and thought it was way overhyped for difficulty.
---
You're trolling... Your account is mobile/shared PC only?
---
Whats up with that anyway? Is Slug Menace the last quest in that line?
---
Like, it literally ends by saying Sir Tiffy will tell you what to do next, and then bam, nothing.

Big reee from me. 55 raids with 20k points and still nothing

Yes. Old people should not be allowed to drive.

lmfao what did this guy think 2k world is kids standing around ge talking about their kill counts

Did you get the pet?

Who could have guessed that references to the biggest tv show so far this year would show up in SEVERAL places?
---
This one hits home. Its not even funny.
---
Yeah, it's the last quest in osrs. RS3 has a few more parts (Kennith's Concerns, a slug mention in Hunt for Red Raktuber, and the widely disliked Salt in the Wound), but they screwed the finale. 
---
Osrs has the chance to do it right a second time, and tbh Dragon Slayer II and Monkey Madness II give me a lot of hope that they won't mess it up in this version of the game.
---
Working on this alchemical hydra task, hoping for a good drop!
---
No. Artificially inflated items are not good
---
Yeah, I figured it was an RS3 thing. The way they leave it off is like a massive cliffhanger, I hope they make a new quest with it :)
---
um
---
I once pooped my pants playing RS back in 2004ish? Was playing super late at night so parents wouldn't know and badly had to go. Being like midnight, I didn't want to wake them up, and I was really into killing some Varrock guards, so I tried my best to hold it in until I had a feeling it'll be a fart. Big mistake.
---
That's true, but the way a part of this community reacted to the event was quite disgusting and reflected badly on the community as a whole with news articles being written about it and the like.
---
looks like you just linked the stream, which is offline lol
---
Thanks man I’ll give it a go after work

Lol your ass is lucky your mom didn’t have this attitude. But if she could foresee your dumbassery maybe she would
---
what does this do when people are phished/keylogged? You should never get keylogged or phished anyways but the fact is, many people do and there are even MORE attempting to do so to others.   
---
the company Blizzard for example: I could put my username and password out right here and now and nothing would happen to my account. I could even give the password to my email associated to my blizzard account, It wouldn't matter without the authetication code, nobody is doing anything.

---
Yeah for sure. One of my best friends in high school failed the asvab twice before barely scraping by with the minimum score for infantry lol it's certainly a thing. I was just saying that there was a waiting list once for infantry mos. Also I wasn't the original guy that tried to argue. He was a little offended I think

Better off going to sand crabs, with those stars you get 30-40k an hour. Only issue is you have to re-aggro every 10 min

Quite a few people have had this for a while. Make an honest title like come and look at my shitty picture please.
---
I did an account recovery on my account due to forgetting the password to the email address i chose when I created the account. 
---
I got an email from jagex asking me for the specific details they are looking for to prove that i owned the acc.  
---
I provided that information and within 3 days I had my email on file updated to the correct one. 
---
They did a great job in my case, I hope your account gets returned to you bud.

Good luck with this, I hope what you're saying is true, however I do also enjoy a good smackdown.
---
I've done the same thing except 60 def, gonna go for dragon defender now.
---
I recently got one from noreply.@jagex.com
---
This has been the most confusing element to me.  The only issue I see is that I added the phone-based 2FA on the same day the hijacking likely took place.  It required it from me to log in for my stream, but if I had "save computer for 30 days" and they spoofed my IP then I'm not sure how that system works.  Like maybe they make the account think it's my computer?
---
All these bots, rwt... only solution I can see it remove free trade and wildy
---
Did the same shit (except my stack is 12m but still I freaked out when I realized (pulled the edgeville lever, slash the web and realized it)
---
Does he have a shit bucket?
---
I was def a wannabe pker back than haha. Post free trade and wild I will agree the game came back a lot but you can’t disagree that at least half of the accounts were bots (see the bot nuke update before and after)
---
Perhaps osrs is getting too big to where the majority of the community no longer generally agrees with where the game is going. Unless all you do is slayer of course haha.
---
It is set to a phone.  I legit might have not even been hacked.  It could just be that something got fucked up with the password change (even though I used the new password to successfully log in on Monday).  The main issue for me now is that my recovery attempts are being denied.
---
Maybe if your maxed and rich. Certainly not 15 mins for everyone.
---

I'm legit unsure of what to do moving forward, especially with my stream.  Do I pick a new game?  I'm somewhat willing to play a HCIM but then what, I get a tbow after 2 years of grinding from CoX and then I just get hacked again?

Not RS related but I once tried to scratch my back with the tip of my mouse. Like, the tip of the mouse arrow on the screen.
---
ELE guys cmon!
---
no exp waste, good man
---
AFAIK account based 2FA can be turned off as long as they have access to your e-mail
---
and if your e-mail pass is compromised they can spoof your ip and log into it.
---
But if you have 2FA on your G-MAIL, i don't know what happens when they spoof your ip while they log-in to your e-mail.
---
I don't think g-mail 2fa should be able to get breached by spoofing an ip, that would be hilarious.
---
Op meme format plz???
---
Can confirm.
---
I'm an ironman without a trident and it takes me around that time dude. Have you ever actually tried using magic on them or are you just repeating how much people hate them?
---
thanks bud.  At least if I get smacked down I'll know for sure what happened.  The reality is I haven't clicked any links or gone to any sites lately because I've been streaming OSRS for 8-10 hours a day every single day.  I haven't even looked up porn (except on my phone).
---
Thank you so much! I always appreciate the kind words!
---
Good luck, looking forward to the outcome, be it good or bad

---
there you go, GGWP. If this is the case it goes so so so fucking deep.
---
Dude, I feel for you. I’m devastated by the mere thought of losing a TBow, AND my precious account. I don’t even know what to say about your stream, I’m sure your fans are torn about it. All I can suggest is to maybe take a short break, explain to your stream that you need some time to recover, they’ll understand. HCIM doesnt sound like a bad idea, those are very popular to watch.
---
Why?
---
Look at someone's in-game name and tell me how you could hack them knowing that? Literally impossible unless you've compromised your info some other way in the past.
---
Q
---
At 91 agility you'll never fail the hand holds.
---
I have 90 and never failed but maybe I got lucky
---
So you can't actual confirm you've been hacked yet? Are you sure that the reset emails aren't going to spam/some other folder you aren't checking? I've had this happen to me before.
---
You'll get it easy! I got it in 2 tries at 85 ranged 70 def, the first time I thought jad spawn where you KILLED the orange 360. Didn't find him in time and got 1 shot lol but second time I got it easy.
---
We’re talking about him so it worked. He came in 2nd but I know his name and not the other guys. Who’s the real winner here?
---
After my first two trips getting 5ish I finally learned to count to 3 and got the electric boogaloo down. After about 100 kills I got the confidence to do the attack move during fire special, it’s sped up my kills a lot and only took 1 trip to get the timing down. I only really take damage in phase transitions where I forgot which # I’m on. “Oh darn that wasn’t a 3... so 2 then move on his 3rd to avoid lightening.. shit it was 1... alright start over at 1... shit forgot about moving from lightening.” And I’m out like 50 hp haha.
---
Checks your message lol, looks like you're banned
---
And, Oslo is the capital of my country, which probably makes him a fellow Norwegian, which brings shame to the country’s name and I want to move to Sweden.
---
Back when MM2 was introduced, fixing the mechanic was polled and failed because people have an unhealthy hatred of the pure community. Wouldn't locking it behind a level 90+ (since it could be boosted) requirement really be so bad?
---
I'm not willing to turn X hours into either 2X hours or 0.  That's such a shitty gamble.  You didn't mention how many hours you've put into PvM but good items have drop rates of like 1/5000, you're not going to get them often man.  Would you like 100 hours of PvM to suddenly turn into zero progress towards anything?
---
Nieve was a useless POS for me, multiple times
---
oh sorry, i don't think i made it clear, but i played osrs when it came out. my quest cape was on 2007scape not rs3 i achieved it under a year when i was in freshman year college.
---
Man you parents really are so miserable and pathetic that you have to huddle together like sheep. "OMG YOU'RE A PARENT? I'M A PARENT TOO!"
---
&gt;OmG so much XP gainz whilst feeding my kid!? Wew lad! Who knew that having children was the fastest way to max!!?
---
Sure you didn't get good one hand playing RS in the dark in your mum's basement? ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)
---
Straight up man 😂
---
ahh someone was in his stream last night saying they sold their entire bank for tbow and they are rebuilding now. Guess its a pretty common thing. Good luck brother, hope Jamflex helps you out.
---
Why there is a spider? Who invited him? We need to decide the colour of our new unfirom. Spiders don't wear uniforms
---
Boo
---
Lovely stuff, cheers. Just killing cows atm to make some starting cash/get combat stats up
---
Yeah I literally set up phone-2FA and a new password before my stream, and was "hijacked" sometime after my stream, presumably on the same day.  Seems suspicious, ngl.  That's the fishiest part of all of this for me tbh.  Why didn't I do it before?  Same reason as anyone right?  "Eh, I'll get to it"
---
I'm not here to cry about losing my tbow.  The bank is probably gone, that's fine.  I'm mostly just upset that Jagex is telling me I'm a liar when I'm sitting here ready to email them my fucking bank statements and driver's license lol
---
Yes, Jagex should definitely improve their recovery system. There is nothing we can do to protect us from an account recovery done through the recovery form. We need more control about the process and Jagex shouldn't heavily rely on old account details.
---
One of the problems is that Jagex, compared to other companies, doesn't seem to have a lot of information they can use to verify the account owner's identity. I mean, when you create an account what do they ask of you? They don't verify the login email nor the registered email. All they basically have is the creation password and the IP/ISP.
---
I believe that Jagex said somewhere that they don't keep the identity of whoever paid the subscription. Not sure why, might be because they have to adhere to UK/EU laws. Regardless, you can't verify your identity with an ID, because they don't have anything to verify it with from their end.
---
You know what fucks up people's accounts? The fact that they login with e-mail as the username. The moment this e-mail is seen by the public, that e-mail becomes a timebomb. I feel safe for having a username as my login instead of my e-mail, it's sad that not much can be done about this apart from censoring this e-mail on the login screen
---
Just like the thousands of others that have posted this here, I expect an out pour of praise and congratulations /s, thank you &lt;3
---
Lel 1v1 me u dont even know bro u dont even knooooow
---
It's crazy, I've played WoW for almost as long as runescape but I've never feared my account getting hacked. Every time I play osrs I'm afraid my password suddenly won't work and all my stuff will be gone.
---
Yes of course, thanks though.  I also checked for forwarding settings, auto delete settings, alternate logins, etc etc.
---
But ya i do need to get on that 😂
---

Long grind awaits you my friend.
---
honestly trying to sustain bonds and progress your account is really going to make it slower to progress since almost all your money will be going to bonds, you should just pay for membership if you can afford it (less than 40 cents a day) until you get to a higher level with significantly better money makers
---
It’s 6 seconds, pretty big difference tbf
---
Fill it with lava and have there be a 1% chance on jumping over that you fall in and insta-die, all your items get consumed by the lava.
---
Someone already commented about a "sink" system whereby you could (for example) make your Tbow untradeable, unusable in pvp, unalcable, etc. Thus "locking" the item.  Seems cool
---
Upvoted, personally I like a happy ending whether that's getting your account back or justice for whatever you did wrong :P
---
Btw, this is the only way to sell off gold without getting a ban, pretend you're hacked, lose a valuable thing and then come to reddit and explain how IN NO WAY YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HACKED, BUT BY SOME MIRACLE IT HAPPENED ANYWAY.
---
There have been thousands of similar posts of people getting unfairly banned/recovered/hacked etc, and it can be counted on one hand how many times it has been jagex's fault.
---
Glad to see people in this thread panicking and contemplating quitting as getting your account taken out of thin air is likely. Lmfao.
---
Don't know a single thing that's going on but take my upvote.
---
That’s crazy high, that’s higher than any shortcut available in the game. Now I’m convinced that Song of Elves will totally have an obstacle that you can fail even at 99 agility.
---
Fuck ya man congrats! Got mine recently at 125 combat lol. Put it off way to long. Feels good man.
---
You can never change the login name, your login email or username will always be the same no one can change it
---
I'm afraid to start a HCIM because what's to say it just won't get hacked anyway when I get lucky at CoX
---
Did you read?
---
I did the jig emote in front of sire. Got b2b heads.
---
Same. I thought of this one because I had moved my house to Hosidius, and used it recently. Looked really out of place compared with where I'd just been!
---
Look at how dire security is on RuneScape, and hlc nerds are complaining about 3rd party clients. Get your priorities right people....this is what scares me more
---
I was at 68 agility when I did it, I failed about 10 times
---
Very solid suggestion!

I played an in progress MMO years ago that did text recognition for NPC conversations. If you understood the keywords it was parsing for you could get pretty creative with the responses.

Sounds like a total insecure dickhead. Easy way to throw any amount of trust they built down the drain. GG burning bridges.

This pic was taken hours before the president referred to Al-Kharid as a "Shit-hole Area." What a cretin.

Why lol. Sounds pointless
---
I understand this. Just please try to follow along.
---
I tried to log in through the mobile app. It asked for an authenticator that does not match the one on my device, so I clicked the "forgot my password" button.
---
I was IMMEDIATELY taken to Jagex's site, where it said a password reset email would be sent to 1*****@****
---
Naturally because it's censored I can't tell what the fuck it is, but I do know NONE of my email addresses start with a 1 so that's not my email.
---
I then hit the button that said "I don't have access to that email"
---
And then I was taken to the account recovery screen. I filled it out and it was denied. I fleshed out the extra section a bit more and added another password to the password section, after remembering that I had in fact changed my password once for this game.
---
Now I have an email saying my appeal was accepted, and I need to reset my password.
---
BEAUTIFUL! Let's get right on that! 
---
Nope. Password reset link takes me to [this screen](https://i.imgur.com/HSdqTFp.jpg) where my username and email, or the tracking ID is invalid.
---
Isn't it birdsnest that normally says that?
---
Ooof!
---
I need to see this
---
I think its about unpopulair clients that have questionable plugins. Autoswitcher zulrahelper etc

That’s a good question, because it would answer that means it depends on what tile you stand on or it depends if the tree has the boost property itself

While you're not wrong, it's still the second best crush weapon in game. I don't think that should be nearly tied in offensive strength by a weapon dropped from a mid-game boss being pitched as the new meta for red spider eggs.

Lies, a Drill Instructor from STC told me that there is no Echo Company. He said it’s a myth by 2nd Batt. to get more funds than the other training battalions in an attempt to be the best, even though that’s clearly 3rd Batt. I don’t see why he would lie to me
---
He had no pin and no 2fa.  I had 2fa to phone, 2fa in game, pin, etc.  Also, I didn't ask for my items back, I don't give a fuck about the items.  I only care about Jagex giving me access to my account.
---
Even Mod Ash roasted him

Fuck trump, but the meme is undeniably dank as fuck.

I also received a request a for password reset on June 17th, about a week before that, I received password resets for a fresh account that wasn't mine that somehow was setup using my email. I have every safeguard in place, but I am still worried as it seems all of that can be bypassed.
---
Good n you?
---
There's basically no point to rushing getting normal void, it's pretty shit.
---
Don't bother doing PC grind til 100 cb since elite is the only one you want to ever use.

The ditch takes something significant from the atmosphere of the  wilderness. I get why they decided to add it but I never liked it. 
---
Before, wandering into the wilderness from civilization had a gradual, ominous feeling. You felt it build up even before you were actually inside, then the sense of danger got stronger as you got deeper and the landscape changed.
---
Now it's sort of an all at once feeling. This side good, that side bad.

Just max lol

Idk why there's literally only 1 upvote when multiple people have said they've upvoted... This is a serious problem that should be rectified immediately by the company that's being paid by a consumer to play their game.... Seriously people...
---
Upvoted, go in peace. Good luck homie
---
d hide, anguish, and assembler will be the best you can get until arma, yes.
---
at 92+ range (and specifically 92 range lol, there is a sudden jump in dps between the two lol) elite void will out dps d'hide, but any levels before that the difference is so minimal you're better off with a normal switch. (the extra dps from void comes from the increased max hit -- d'hide has better accuracy by a long shot but a smaller max hit, so really it's all up to what you prefer) this, of course, is assuming you're potting and praying rigour for the entire kill.
---
at about 93 ranged full arma will out dps elite void and i cba to do all those calcs again for ancestrals but i assume past ~90 mage you'll see the same thing. 
---
TL;DR: switch to elite void past 92 range/mage, otherwise stick to a d'hide-ahrims switch. past 93 ranged and ~90 mage, arma-ancestrals out dpses elite void.
---
also in general if you ever have a question about gear and what's better at dpsing you should use the [calculator](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/64wtan/dps_calculator_by_bitterkoekje/)
---
Long story but here goes:
---
So for what it's worth, this happened to me a while back too. They got into my account through my email, as it had been found on haveibeenpwned.com -- apparently it was in some leak and they got into my RS account through it. I should've used a burner email but I didn't.
---
I did *not* have 2FA on the email itself, which is how they got in (the same with you, considering you said you added 2FA on your email address later on in the post).
---
Ironically, I got those same fake appeal emails from a 'legit' Jagex email -- which was signed by Mod West asking for certain specific login details. The phisher/hacker rerouted his email to my RS account so every time I sent in a real appeal, he would get a message that someone was 'appealing his account password' -- so he could send me a fake 'appeal denied' email -- which is how he kept me going. The first four were sporadic, two minutes, five minutes, 20 minutes, etc. He even added 'if you have any questions, feel free to contact customer support' and he even added a legitimate Runescape website link in the fake appeal email.
---
I eventually got a real Jagex email that my appeal was granted (it took an entire day to process) and I still had everything on my account and my bank, as they could not get through my bank pin -- something the fake appeal also 'suggested I put in my appeals for clarity that I am the legitimate owner'. I got my account back within a day. I suggest you try and have some faith, but you did get hacked through your email as account login on the RS website requires no authenticator.

Nah, can we remove quest? Too complicated for me slayer brain /s
---
I mean honestly I would skip them since brutals are trash for both xp and gp, but if you’re going to kill them melee is not the way to go
---
Norwegians shitting their pants, or the relationship between Norway and Sweden?
---
Pretty sure that’s how mutes work anyway. I was muted back in the day and I could still see what I typed and had text pop up above my head, however no one else could see it.

I actually dig that idea, would be pretty cool

Either, but mostly the second part

Yeah did that yesterday

You can pick any world you want. All of your stuff will be the same between worlds.

When i kill has this will be my favorite meme
---
#attempt18 failed
---
The lore is what makes runescape runescape and rs3 continues that tradition far better than osrs does. The story got more complex, multi-layered and interesting and quests as a whole are a gem. Can't say the same for OS, its lore reads like fanfiction. 
---
Everything else is just window dressing, and rs3 does that better too.
---
Then why mention them?
---
I think it’s a meme that Swedish people shit their pants, kinda answered both questions there
---
Depends on what you mean by viable. is it going to be remotely efficient? fuck no, but I do all of my farming at the guild anyway because it's manageable and all in the same place. I'm not getting 99 any time soon, but I still level every couple of weeks depending on how hard I go (88 farming). I just don't enjoy running around the map doing herb/tree runs, trees are expensive and I'd rather just use what I get from slayer/contracts, plus I only enjoy spending like five minutes on farming at a time and this is the perfect amount of shit to do.
---
Honestly though.
---
Woah thanks for the anonymous silver and platinum! :O
---
I'm really hoping they do make an upgrade from proselyte, but I doubt it as proselyte is already really strong in terms of prayer bonus, unless they only increase defense.
---
It seems that once you buy a Tbow its just a matter of time once your account gets stolen :D
---
After some uses it turns to dust.... to keep an item sink going ofc.
---
You don’t technically need to do rfd since the ferocious gloves with ds2 req are better than b gloves for melee and really cheap. Doesn’t hurt to do for the quest points though if that’s what you’re mainly after. What do you need high agility for?
---
dude no doubt.  my friend got lured for his within a week of getting it by a "friend"
---
dam lmfao
---
Whoa, you got that far with your sister?
---
I still think it is a crime they added the Wilderness GWD without putting a boss in there. 2 potential ways I'd like to see the frozen door utilized:
---
a. Put a boss in there that requires a certain KC of all GWD bosses to enter. Kills don't have to be in the same inventory or anything like that. Possibly let people accumulate GWD boss kills for a week and then charge 10 of each boss kill to enter the frozen door. This would also include a new GWD boss that is put in the Wilderness GWD.
---
b. Use the same mechanic I previously mentioned with boss KCs to enter the door, but have it lead to the Wilderness where people must navigate through some obstacles where PKers could possibly be waiting to attack. At the end of these obstacles is the final GWD boss (could also potentially be in a pvp area, but this might get a bit sketchy if this is the case)
---
Third option I am not personally a fan of but could see happening: a future raid is behind that door
---
It's the tile you stand on, so yes
---
&gt; but when you have the same play time as me and a 1/4th the total level and like 1/10th the bank size u gotta think youre doin somethin wrong? 
---
Yeah, their chairs are a lot cleaner and don't smell like feces.
---
This title is the ultimate clickbait. Sure fire way to get upvotes to help your cause...
---
I PEED and SHIDDED and CAMED
---
But then again how efficient was he?
---
That's nothing. Last week alone I recruited 32 people from my clan chat and they're in the Navy SEALs now.
---
Yes, we understand you can _choose_ not to use them.  But other people won't know that!
---
Agreed.  The animation simply were not designed to be keyframes for higher frame rate animations, and end up looking unnatural if not broken.
---
How to you avoid taking so much dmg from the swamp monster things? I gave them a go recently but just found myself taking loads of damage on every run
---
I recently started playing again after a decade or more.  I was amazed when I learned you can't use special characters in your password.  Like seriously Jagex, it's 2019, get with modern security practices.
---
🦀?
---
Remove non bis quests
---
Hello fellow worker who gets paid to shit.
---
I mean its not going to impact the mace. Mace is really just used in the wildy, but if a mid tier account can't afford hasta/bludgeon to do this boss (who its designed for), the mace is usable and is only 4m (compared to 14m hasta, 27m bludgeon). If they can't afford that, they can try the leaf bladed baxe, but obviously performance will take a hit. 
---
I don't think anyone cares its better than a dscim dude. They're a t60 weapon and literally alch price. Whip blows it out of the water at t70 when its suppose to be a t65. Like its suppose to be better than a t60 dscim.
---
It'll probably impact hasta the most, but the primary function and use for hasta is stab+off hand. It just for whatever reason had crush stats and filled that niche because nothing else did for a long time. And as you said, crush weapons suck, so this helped keep it competitive. You could make the argument about if it should even have crush, or if we should care about its crush uses, when maybe it shouldn't have to begin with?
---
Bludgeon is still bis by quite a bit and as we see with other bis items, even bis items that only give a marginal increase over the 2nd bis, they stay valuable. Maybe it drops slightly due to the nicheness of crush weakness, idk. But quite frankly bludgeon is overpriced for what it does/useful for, it probably mostly keeps it value due to sire being a PITA. 
---
The purpose of the Cudgel is to literally fill the gap between basically nothing for crush and hasta/bludgeon lol at t65. I think it'll do just that. 
---
I guess I just fail to see what you have an issue with, when what you seem to have an issue with is literally what its meant to do and fill? without stepping on the whip or hasta/bludgeon. And it does that?
---
So idk.
---
I use to fill in surveys for membership money at some point when I was older. The guide came with a browser bar that auto filled in info for me like billing address first and last name, but all the surveys worth more than like 2-6 cents each required a credit card. I searched for weeks on ways to get credit cards or find another magical browser bar that would let me auto fill them in, to sign people up for horrible services they never would want, so I could of made 30 cents. 
---
I googled so many bad things as a kid. Like I remember thinking regedit was a utility program for hacking RuneScape. I am pretty sure I followed a guide to delete system 32, and another to fuck up all my registries. Luckily I was too dumb to get too far into them.
---
An... untradeable item sink?
---
Barely over rate
---
or just fix account security 4Head
---
Lmao you have my clue rng. Keep it rolling, i got 3 pairs in 250 clues. Thats less than drop rate for 1 lol
---
this
---
So am I a breeder or stuck in my mum’s basement? It’s hard to take an insult seriously when you just contradict yourself
---
And it’s fine to not want kids. I’m glad you aren’t going to. It’s judt too bad you think your mum’s life was over when she had you. But then again, it makes sense that you would think that if you’re able to look into a mirror
---
this would be sick with some fresh sharpies
---
This is not what an item sink is
---
This, and also the Underground pass question. Why? Annoying and tedious stuff is an important part of this game, why would anyone from the dev team even consider removing it?
---
It's an economic sink. Just like the Avernic items.
---
skimming through the guide, this is precisely what i'm looking for, thank you! it being 2/3rds NMZ is also fantastic, lol. passively training stuff up while i do other things on my main sounds perfect.
---
honestly i was just looking for an excuse to train afk skills on my main (which i normally loathe) and RDAs seemed like the best use of my time and money lol.
---
some more questions if you don't mind:
---
* what's the profit like, and how long do your trips normally last? what are they normally ended by? (running out of inv space/pots/etc)
---
* how *actually* afk is the gameplay, like, on a scale from splashing to demonic gorillas?
---
* should i bond the alt up or pay for a membership? i don't have a problem maintaining a bond at this point in the game, but i'd rather not cut into profits that much if it's going to be that big of a deal.
---
* are the drags normally busy?
---
Epic boomer roast! Owned with facts and logic!
---
You can use Google to see for yourself if you want your precious sources. You really think I pulled all that out of my ass? IDF diapers is just a few keystrokes away.
---
Pures don't need to be any better than they already are.

Adding things like this for pures is just like adding (big) stuff for snowflake ironman accounts.

Wait... I'm planning to get nbn soon. Right now, without nbn, i have a delay on every 4th tick. I was really hoping it would change after upgrading to nbn. Fml.
---
I’M CLOCKJ G THE MISIC BUTTON BUT I CAB STILL HEAR IT
---
upper management and ruining runescape name a more iconic duo.
---
It’s like saying “no offense but ___”
---
Controlled isnt faster. It's slightlh less xp per damage, and getting higher base stats for more accurate hits and max hits will win out over controlled. 
---
Granted you need to own an abyssal dagger for strength training. 
---
The real big dick training method is barb fishing until 99 fishing, chinning on defensive until 99 ranged, bursting on defensive until 99 mage, and then training from there
---
That trigger discipline though.
---
too many teleports? Right now it cost about 15k to teleport there. Hardly that hard to get. I think it would be better for teleport to require high stats rather than easy obtained teleport scrolls.
---
Same, though it was actually having the bladder of a child and a long stretch of Texas countryside without gas stations.
---
Could've stopped in the side of the road but ~~xp waste~~ ain't nobody got time for that and it's probably safer than stopping a few feet away from highway traffic.
---
I love jagex but I wish they took customer service as seriously as Blizzard does.
---
The fires are also the one reason I don't use animation smoothing, they look soooooooo bad with it on.
---
When you see him do the white cast on you, you need to click the floor to cancel any of your actions and then crumble undead the spawn :)

A rune scim vs tank armor and no shield isnt a solution lol. The problem is with current dinhs and pvp mechanics u can literally tank a 30 man team and not be a pro. The solo pkers literally stand no chance killing someone wearing dinhs/ely other than if the person disconnects. A rune scim isnt a solution. U can already walk from lvl 1 to lvl 48 to lvl 1 to 48 to lvl 1 in f2p armor vs rune scim. Add all the extra hp u get from brews, ur wep wont do shit. 
---
If u want a better solution, make bulwark double pvp damage when praying the wrong style. So if u pray melee, they could dbow u a 96 96. So in the right hands its a good ass tank shield. But if ur a pleb who just prays magic ur gunna get slain 10/10 times.
---
Farming was one of my favorite skills coming back to the game. 96 farming atm. Cant wait for that untrimmed cape. It will be my first 99 ever.
---
Why is this for you the best quest?
---
Slayer cape perk is already good. Just the chance of back to back hydra or cerb is good enough.
---
I splash via remote desk top while I’m at work 50k exp an hour is better than 0 xp.
---
I use Duradel and recently I've had a shitload of Fire Giants and Kalphite basically every other task. It's probably just a coincidence. Last week I got Gargoyles twice and Kurasks once in the same evening, so it's not like he's only screwing me over on the "bad" tasks.
---
If you're concerned, start blocking tasks you don't like that have high weights (check the wiki).
---
Just watched the vid, some thoughts:
---
I think 15 minutes or so is the sweet spot - try not to go past 20 as it seems to get slightly "rambly" at times (although this is only my opinion, others might enjoy it).
---
There's also some dissonance between what you are talking about and what's happening on the screen. Particularly in the first half of the video, there's clips of you unlocking chunks with yellow text explaining it, meanwhile your voice is talking about the hunter grinds or something. This makes the narrative or progression pretty hard to follow, as a viewer.
---
For the chunk unlocking clips, you could do it "montage" style like you did later in the video - just have some music playing for 20 secs or so while you show the unlocking, and have some YellowText™ explain details if necessary (no voiceover!). This would give a slight break from the continuous stream of explanations and naturally segment the video. Though I've never edited a video in my life, this is just an idea.
---
The dramatic random event failure was quite funny. Definitely include some more casual humor/drama if you find the opportunity (But dont force it in! Only if you think it makes sense).
---
at 99 farm with relevant diaries a 9 patch run is 173k profit rn

Go to the wiki and search the task weight. That is why you get some tasks more frequently
---
Same!  I want Jamflex devs and Blizzard CS.  Plzzzz can't some company out there just give us everything we need to have fun?
---
they are not good money at all if you dont get lucky and dont have noted dagg bones. I have done 3 entire tasks at DKs (each 150+) without noted bones and so far I have 1 berserker ring to show for it. not worth the effort
---
Yeah jagex really do be like that fam 😂😂😂👌
---
Not sure at all.  No idea if my bank pin is holding up or not.  I'm saying I don't care either way about the tbow, I care that I'm getting denied access (for a 3rd time btw)
---
They also have some serious money coming in and out of other games that they can overlap customer service for. Not to give Jagex an easy out, it’s inexcusable how horrible their current setup is regardless of company size
---
Upvote, good luck man, there’s no way they read the appeal
---
Could also be that this person is a streamer and talks too much about him/her self. Recovery questions are personal but easy enough to talk someone into answering or finding old social media accounts/posts set to public. Place of birth, mothers maiden name, first car, bedroom color, googling their last name to see previous addresses and relatives. People put themselves out there way too much.
---
Wait... So you unlocked being able to get lizardman for a task then you blocked them? seems a bit inefficient
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-post.

Finally, a post that I can relate too!

What do you mean a world where they change one after the other? I feel like they always do that?

Sorry but where is the proof of that in the last year, I would believe membership and bonds could easily rival RS3 mtx right now.

I only ever had this issue once with Blizzard and they just asked for a copy of my driver's license checked my last login from my ip then gave me everything I lost back and my account with a temp password. I get that it could be abused but it's a game and a buisness, nothing more. It should be treated as such imo.

This is like a nightmare scenario for me. Goodluck dude, wish you the best.

Wouldn’t mind nex if it was rebalanced around tbow and bp. Also the armors could use some rebalancing or degrade and need some form of item to recharge them similar to zulrah scales.

Its just luck really. When i first started with Duradel i had 
---
Wyverns, Bloodveld, Fossil island wyverns, Fire giant, Wyverns, Blood veld, Fossil island wyverns. 
---
I was pretty tired of wyverns.
---
Avantoe is also good, especially when you dont have a ton of cash. The margin is a bit lower but you dont lose so much when one dies.
---
The uniques come with time. I'm ungodly lucky at hydra though. I've been doing a lot of skilling since I bought my bow, though. Had to take a little break from the PvM grind lol.
---
Thanks for the feedback dude, really appreciate it! What happens during my editing process is that I watch over the footage, then write down what I'm going to say in the voiceover. I then record the voiceover and fit the video to it. The past few videos I started doing the leveling-up montage-style sections when it was a lot of grinding. 
---
I think what happened with the dissonance is that I tried too hard to fit the voiceover I had already recorded to the video, when that was definitely not the right way to go about doing it. I think I could benefit from another step where I make sure it fits properly and make sure it fits the narrative. I'll definitely try to do that! Thanks so much for pointing it out, really want to make the videos as good as they can be and stuff like this really helps me know what to improve on.

Because otherwise to flex pet we have to stop killing the boss entirely or in the case of skill pets stop training that skill entirely. This obviously isn’t preferable.

I know what you meant. The owner can then use it risk free deep wildy all the time

that's fucking bullshit tbh
---
I don't think Soul Split and Turmoil will be possible since they don't exist in the game. I also don't think she could use Wrath at the end but rather will have to use Retribution. They can give her blood spells for healing at the end instead of Soul Split and they could just give her Piety with a cool animation.

I mean I did the same thing.  I staked away my bank on my main and started an ironman.  Playing an ironman changed my perspective on the game though.  I find getting gear upgrade drops are more exciting now and more worth while.  Thats just me tho.

God they fucked the wrap up of that quest line in rs3 too.

I'm not sure why having a low kc/lvl pet is a "flex" it's nothing to do with skill and it's not an earned achievement. You just got lucky. Either way the game hasn't recorded when players got pets so this couldn't be implemented plus it would be aids when trying to click on something on the ground
---
Just an FYI, when it asks you to reset your password, and you didn't request it, don't open the link. They are waiting for you to open the link so they can beat you to the reset. Call support and work from that point.

It's one hand hold, it's not that bad lol. Underground pass has like 10x more agility checks.
---
Only problem I can see is skulled revs? Or wildy pvm in general, can now bring an extra item risk free if tbow cant be lost, would probably need a BIG fee to recover on death above level 20 wildy or something to balance it.
---
This is too long. 
---
We just need everyone to say yes, doesn’t matter their affiliation or their decision to make it or not. That’s the only speculative part, cause apparently the motto goes “if the community wants it, sure”.
---
Why would a low killcount be a flex. If anything the higher the killcount the more of a flex, so it would be a win situation to have it NOT display at which kc you got the pet. 
---
 if you’re into flexing killcounts anyway

Who the fuck remembers the exact day and time an account was created? Do businesses think I care enough to remember such a detail? Do they think we keep every single email? Companies, Google included, who ask that question as part of the recovery process are seriously out of touch with how a real user behaves.

Real talk though, what were you doing to make enough money to get a tbow in such a short amount of time?
---
This one was 100% done through the recovery form that Jagex has for people who don't know their email, reasoning being that OSRS authentication works on a device by device basis so IP addresses have nothing to do with them. Email authenticators, at least Outlook does the same thing.
---
You can't? Huh, well I still stick by it needing a massive recovery cost to be balenced.
---
I think more people should be encouraged to play OSRS, it gets really fun, you just have to give it a chance :)
---
Jagex is so pathetic.. the least they can do is improve account security and allow players to contact them.. Definitely not worth $11 a month

Hey if you don’t want to or can’t come up with a response don’t blame the length.  It’s a Reddit comment tread, jump in and out whenever, no cop out needed.

Yes. Runelite+, I wouldn’t trust it though, not actually affiliated with runelite.

Management is prolly what caused this. Not too surprising, Jagex probably has a lot of internal decisions that us plebs will never be aware of.

But on a serious note this is great for boss items and rares. Just make it 10% of the items value to do so. 
---
That's an amazing item sink and gold sink
---
tfw when you automatically believe a post, for whatever reason. What if this is the hacker trying to use reddit to steal an account?
---
For the record I have no idea what happened here as its been conveniently [removed]
---
Can you link a source to any of your claims? The Jagex post I read regarding this said that he was released from Jagex due to him stealing accounts.
---
Holy shit I just realized that. The Jagex security team must be run by a baboon
---
Damn upvoted hopefully you get you account and tbow back
---
I don’t see an issue with people WILLINGLY training past 99 for a cosmetic upgrade, if they didn’t find it fun they wouldn’t bother. 
---
Besides that it keeps people playing which keeps money in Jagex pocket. 
---
But personally I dislike the idea because it’s a bit of a waste of time
---
If I had to guess it would be the mass botting issue going on in p2p due to free membership options. I'm open to other suggestions tho.
---
Holy shit thanks for the link to that website.
---
Apparently I got screwed by Adobe and MyFitnessPal in their breaches.  
---
Is there anyway to go after those large companies for their breaches?
---
Sorry for long comment I tried my best 
---
There are six streams, 3 blue and 3 green. In each world there is a different order in which the streams cycle. The streams will always cycle one at a time, one tick apart. You'll never see two blue streams chance locations at the exact same game tick! 
---
The idea is to find a world where the three blue streams change location in order, one after the other. Every world will have a different order, but to get the best score possible you need to hop worlds to find this 
---
Once you have one of these worlds with this order, gather tears from the first blue stream (first to change locations). When it changes, don't move from where you are. There's a *good chance 
---
* that the following two blue streams will change and spawn into the location you're still gathering tears from. 
---
The reason you hop worlds is because of this *good chance*. There's 9 spots the tears can spawn in, 3 green 3 blue and 3 empty. When the first blue changes spots, in can only spawn in one of the three empty spots. When the second blue changes spots, there are 2 empty spots from before, but the previous blue streams' spot just opened up so that's now empty (this is where you are still gathering from). There's a 33% chance the stream will spawn in the same spot. Similar scenario for the third blue stream.
---
Are we sure that "remember for 30 days" goes by IP address? If my harddrive dies I can still reinstall Windows on a new drive and have it automatically verify itself because it recognizes my motherboard had Windows installed before. Going off of the motherboard of some other unique system identifier would be much more secure than IP. And don't a lot of people use dynamic IPs anyways?
---
Right?! Is that like 3 days worth of samiches or wank tissues in the background or something?
---
Don’t be stupid player 15 year never been hacked don’t even use 2fa if your not a retard and made your account you aren’t getting hacked how is anyone gunna even get your login email if it’s used only for osrs and your not stupid 😂
---
Can you teach me?
---
is that the best place to kill ghosts? I usually just kill the 2 in taverley
---
BS. Prove it, log your account and take a photo of your levels and reddit username, and don't even think about linking me a screenshot without actual evidence that you're maxed.
---
Also weren't you going to block me dumbass, or did you not realise that you can't block someone who hasn't messaged you LOL?
---
Anyway we all know the only thing you will be maxing is going to be your credit card after the next kid ROFL
---
Root kit on PC?
---
Mine took longer.....because I forgot to buy more cannonballs before I went lol.
---
At least their quality control is on par with their customer service 🦀🦀
---
Just tossed in a pic of my stats for ya
---
My best guess is someone got a group of people or bots to mass report the name, seeing as it's not on an account it doesn't seem like it's been stolen by a jmod (has happened i the past)
---
Not really. I'm sure I'll live my life as normal.
---
The health bar is making me uncomfortable.
---
Go and work out
---
My guess is that you are the legit owner but you are not the original owner so it doesn't recognize you as such. I've recovered my accounts in the past many times, the only time I've been rejected almost instantly is when I wasn't the original owner.
---
Moderation in everything I guess
---
The ending got me. Take my upvote
---
That’s true.
---
*7 days for pin removal
---
A good house is BIS
---
&gt;Idk if OSRS does or not
---
I can confirm OSRS does let you, I once accidentally said my password out loud since I was accidentally focused on the client window. (Thankfully it wasn't in a populated place so no one probably saw it, and I changed it immediately and don't use the same password for several things anymore)
---
Seriously lol that shit is retarded
---
Zulrah one would be pretty broken imo. House teleport &gt; Pool &gt; Zulrah, repeat. The Zulrah teleport would be a waste of money because house tabs are like 500 each. It's a good idea that can be explored for other places, but not for Zulrah.
---
just get noted bones? the requirements are next to nothing lol. obv its not worth doing without noted bones.
---
Huh, I use my email only for my osrs account, literally nothing else ever appears in the inbox since I never enter it anywhere other than the osrs site. The only osrs fan page I visit is this subreddit, and I never click on any links outside of osrs wiki or the official runescape website. My computer scans for viruses every night. I do not have 2FA, but I have a bank pin. Never been hacked.
---
Sorry bro, I’m not on Reddit 24/7 like you are
---
Take a break lmao I feel the same way. I get more enjoyment browsing the Reddit than actually playing atm.
---
Walk? There's a lever in edgeville that takes you there.
---
Are you using ultra compost?
---
&gt;hashing every possibly consecutive password-length string of text in every message everyone sends (literally hundreds of hash operations for even just a short half-sentence message that everyone sends on every world in every chat window), 
---
This is almost certainly how they do it, you say literally hundreds of hashes like that would take a lot of time to process or something but a modern computer can do hundreds of thousands of those every second; and it could all be done client side so no need to worry about the servers' cpus.
---
I respect everything ash does for us but you gotta admit, he’s kinda strange lol.
---
yup, and using the magic sepalepacurs
---
Try out "Divine Valor"
---
What can I do to resolve this? I'd really like to have my name back again, and I don't have a Twitter lol
---
They’re not.
---
So what do you do in the case where you don’t remember any of your creation details?  I created my account almost 20 years ago when I was like 10.  I don’t have a clue what I used as a password or what my IP address was.  I vaguely remember it being sometime around summer of 2002 or 2003, but that’s about it.  I’ve never had to do an account recovery, and I don’t stream, but these posts make me scared shitless.  It almost makes me never want to take my tbow out of the bank because it makes you a walking target.  I mean fuck man they’re worth like a grand online.
---
Yep they chew through those balls. You almost get a shot off each tick it has the chance to.
---
If it's really an issue, try doing it mage only. If you dont get rotation 3 just log out and restart from the boat. Rotation 3 starts with 2 range phases so you know which it is right away. Just hide during the blue phases and DPS during the magma and range phases. Shouldn't be too bad and no need for switches so you can bring tons of food.
---
My main and both alts lost all bank and main + med level dropped infernal capes all placeholders gone same day June 17 I came home from work to my mains credentials being invalid. Alts were fine then after numerous recovery attempts main got locked eventually med and pure also hacked for banks and main cleaned. Main recovered after simply asking for normal password recovery.

Ok yeah, I checked the bank and I was using super not ultra. I got the two mixed up. I feel dumb now. But I least I know now.
---
shoulda enabled 2fa auth. uninstall your whole hard drive you have a keylogger
---
All good man! I knew it was :D I just thought it was more funny that it wasn't!
---
Upvoted and fingers crossed for you.
---
You can't bypass 2FA through IP spoofing though can you? I'm pretty sure the remembering for 30 days is actually just a cookie.
---
Is this repost week or something? I have already seen 6 reposts on the front page alone...
---
Hi, noob here. What’s 2FA
---
Easily. Recover the account via old/inaccessible email. Recovering the account this way, while you provide a new email, allows you to bypass the security measures of the old email, or needing to be logged into it. It also bypasses 2fa on rs.
---
Your total level is 619 higher than mine. My only suggestion is take a break. Whatever you once enjoyed isn't there anymore. Or take on the role of helping a new player or friend get into the game.
---
I can see myself getting easily bored at that point as well so my advice isn't very meaningful.
---
I teleport free to clan wars...
---
i don't know if it's the best but it's quick to get to and it has 8 spawns, i think
---
nah I for sure made this.  It's associated only with the email I created at nearly the same time.  I made it when my IRL friend at work told me he was playing and I wanted a break from WoW.  It's mine.  I just don't remember when I made it cuz like I said in the edit, I only played like a week then went back to WoW.  It wasn't until December 2018 (much later iirc) that I actually picked up the account for reals.
---
They really should not be dying that often also, keep track how many die in your next 5 runs
---
Since you seem to think I'm wrong, can you prove otherwise? 
---
It's not released and that's exactly why it needs to be questioned.
---
No one knows but Jagex and they have been silent since their announcement of his termination. 
---
Glad you could add so much to this conversation though!
---
Guild Wars 1 has a "customization" option for all weapons in the game. For a fee, you can customize your weapon to your account and make in untradeable for a 20% damage boost. Brilliant idea and I wish more games did it.
---
Twisted bow bug in-game and in real life.
---
it would be useless at vorkath lol, but i do agree it would be busted as hell overall. Big no from me on that one.
---
I would rather have it be 2 rolls on the pet per kill to get out of the stone prison faster. Over 5k kills dry there in not fun.
