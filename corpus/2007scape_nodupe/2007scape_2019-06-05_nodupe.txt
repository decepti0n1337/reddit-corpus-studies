July 4th must be a double exp weekend every year in the US.
---
---
---
The task
---
That's what I did. Took 2 months at most to get 99 str and att.
---
[removed]
---
Fally (cheaper stuff but less selection)
---
V West Bank (General stuff)
---
Catherby (lobby’s, fish, and food)
---
Seers village (General stuff, glory ammy, and FLAX or whatever I spent hours picking and spinning)
---
Ardougne had cheap cakes and other items people would spend their time stealing. 
---

---
I was a noob back then, well I still am, but I was worse back then so this is from a young noobs perspective.
---
Lmao
---
How about 2 minute videos checking in?
---
Can’t unsee.
---
Usually they charge 250-400k gp/h for advertising. I don’t mind that tbf but I can also give them a cut if they want. Can be worse or better than the regular wage depending on how much I made.
---
Revs, zulrah, lavas, green drag in rev caves, herb runs, alot of ways
---
Why?
---
Engine work.
---
wew, you put a lot of energy into this didn't you.
---
Ah yes, Good old scamorrock west! Where I put up 32k for rune scimy and then fast trade 3.2k...good old times
---
What's your favorite skill in the game?
---
Hilarious as always, loved the song too!
---
28, kids, wife, dog. Started in 02 😂
---
wc lvl?
---
Ye bonus feature is all 532 hours all in one long ass video uncut and #raw
---
Why is dds spec better??
---
10k dude? I’ll give you 20k
---
HAHA
---
Ur a special kind of stupid
---
Ehp?
---
Try the way back machine
---
Yeah, i was 12 back in 02...
---
As a F2P noob, not much.
---
Put it in the Grand Exchange in the Falador Party Room that’s next to the Grand Exchange
---
Don’t accept too much money though. Sometimes people can be too generous and give so much that it ruins the early game.
---
How would I be ruining it? Surely it's the botters that are destroying the game.
---
too broke for that but i'll try it eventually
---
It’s a mix of things usually. 
---
Very wealthy stakers that sell their wealth (how Cursed You was banned back in 2006).
---
Venezuelans grinding like crazy. 
---
Accounts getting hacked. 
---
And, of course, bottling.
---
Firemaking 9000
---
I'm hoping to do this as well with 10k eclectic to bank 99 con. I hope I get your luck. It took me double the drop rate for rangers.
---
Good old scamorrock west! Where I put up 32k for rune scimy and then fast trade 3.2k...good old times
---
Thank you also why tf would someone downvote this post. Lmao not that I care just curious.
---
Move the party room to the wilderness volcano so party goers can get lit
---
Seen this a billion times already on this subreddit
---
From what Jagex had said, that BA code is some of the worst spaghetti, so this makes sense
---
Silence! Turkeys can’t talk!
---
Nice
---
You’re such a funny troll. Grow up.

That's carry weight not actual weight
---
Pretty sure the DDS max spec hits are much higher than the Abyssal Dagger plus you get way more spec energy value.
---
I think the sub requires me to say Slayer haha
---
I like a lot of things about different skills so it's hard to say my absolute favourite. I think Woodcutting will always hold a special place in my heart because 99 was my goal back when I was a kid, so when I got it I felt like I'd achieved a childhood goal and it was really fulfilling.
---
H
---
can you spot me a couple mil bro?
---
What are you talking about
---
My last 99 was Slayer so my final skill was very representative of the picture :)
---
Someone care to explain this whole crab jagex meme?
---
Yes. I shall call him... Danvil.
---
99
---
The bottom right ones the wrong way up though?
---
For a second I thought you were trolling
---
Nice man. Congrats! How was the ds2 fight for ya?
---
Will you provide food and tasty beverages?
---
Solid line Bobby B
---
Lol *another* boss? Didn’t mimic come out less than a month ago?
---
The games a joke. Fuck bossscape.
---
UwU
---
Lel
---
Wasnt bad after I learned the phases took maybe 3 tries I think.
---
Maybe I should give it a fair shot.
---
If you dislike the graphics and you're not interested in doing switches or flicking, RS3 has better mechanics on their bosses so just play RS3 on legacy mode or revolution.
---
Look at the losers downvoting you.
---
Fuck yeah, thanks for contributing.
---
My plan after diaries is to learn as much PvM as possible, make a respectable amount of money, and grind out as many buyables as I can to 99.
---
Lol
---
Thanks for the reply I can respect that
---
It’s not crazy profit but like 50k a day isn’t too bad for little effort
---
Dude, you can't put 100m, bop, taste and two third age items in the thumbnail and not expect people to downvote. I legit signed into my YouTube account specifically to downvote this video.
---
I see I can get behind that
---
Yeah I remember CW being active quite a bit I was always a balance boi.
---
The damn cocoa cola factory ruiNing our game
---
I think this was a 1 time thing, the man died to a DC, had to continue temple trekking for 500+ hours, and lamping until 27 hunter. If he posted 2 full length videos people would say he was milking it for the YouTube money. Let the man be
---
Can anyone sell me 350 more compost so I can finish hosidius? I hit the buy limit. Lmao
---
🦀EXTERMINATION🦀
---
I dont plan to max, i figure i dont actually need 99s, as long as i have like 95 or high enough to be able to boost to last available thing in the skill list i really wouldnt ever need to go any further, 
---
But yeah iv been pvming, and learning new bosses, i was just wondering what other people do after diarys so i can get ideas of what i might wanna do,
---
I'm honored but you must not know how youtube works
---
I’m not sure what it is that you’re looking for. There are tons of awesome bosses, but they have mechanics. It sounds like you just want to click on it and sit there until it dies with no interaction at all?
---
This is incredible. Never stop these.
---
Swamp man deliver to you just be patient
---
How did you arrive over 12 years ago? OSRS came out in 2013
---
Avernic should be last thing to buy as you essentially loose your money on it. Rapier first
---
Waiting for a power leveler to get my new account to 70 agility
---
I can't even beat some quest bosses in rs3....maybe I'm just bad haha
---
The most hectic account of all time
---
I want a documentary with interviews and shit of all these players with insane achievements now
---
Nice, good plan, i do plan on doing the coin grind now that iv done majorty of the skill grind out the way.
---
Party room?
---
I don’t see a dragon spear in there. Crack on.
---
If you’re that bored you can grind my RCing to 82 for Fremmy diary... js
---
Tzhaar caves
---
They ban a bunch of bots at once in waves. Even if their system detected them for cheating they won’t get banned until enough bots are collected to ban them all at once.
---
If I understand it right, with full obby and bneck the obby sword effectively gets a 30% boost in damage?
---
Yeah, I’ve been told that about 25 times already
---
nice,  but riddle me this, type ur username and password in a message to me!
---
Maybe it doesnt matter.
---
Maybe Jagex should give us A REAL FUCKING CASINO FOR IN GAME GOLD ALREADY SINCE GAMBLING AT THE GE AND SANDCASINO ARE ALREADY A FUCKING THING.
---
Lmfao is this circle jerk still going on after i left for like 3 months?
---
Not gonna go for graceful?
---
Makes me wanna suck him oh god yes mmmm
---
How about we dont?
---
This is actually a great idea. Casually chilling, playing games while others skill or afk. They should brighten the colours a bit.
---
People will legit stand there doing nothing and wait for someone else to fix it.
---
Ouch.
---
Nah. I don’t know what I would use it for as rc, quests, and agility make me not want to continue playing osrs.
---
Well, it still picks up coins automatically for lazy people. And teleports. I use it on gargoyle tasks.
---
Exact same thing happened to me 5 weeks ago. I hate it and love it
---
really shouldn't stream wildy content on hcim rip
---
Ok
---
Die in the wilderness, then take the dropped items. Why no profit?
---
I thought he was black
---
This would cheapen the value of the agility shortcut if it's placed like that.
---
Wouldn't be the first time unfortunately. Even when I blend it in smoothly some people just... cant give credit I guess. I hold on to my PSD's in case I ever have to prove ownership at least.
---
I agree with this post. We should bring back Soul Wars.
---
Especially date rape.
---
And their accidental love-child’s name? Albert Einstein.
---
You probably have a shitty total level :/
---
:)
---
Stake me
---
Not sure the exact amount but it's significant, yeah.
---
Even at near maxed stats (a little under 20 hours to 99 hp woohoo) the xph difference between Dharok and obby for me is about 10-15%.
---
In comparison in full str gear that xph is cut by like 15% even more. Full str is way worse than obby.
---
Keep in mind obby can be played super afk as well; atm I'm almost completely afk, pressing locator orb/rock cake every few minutes and no interaction aside from that. I didn't really enjoy doing overloads as it really ties you to having to press that every 5 min no matter what else you're doing.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Staking is one thing but they really just need mods on shifts to banhammer the RNG bots and their spammers.
---
Nope not in inferno.
---
Rune essence mine. Once a bustling hub of f2pers and bots, now a ghost town useful for nothing outside of a couple quests and diaries.
---
To RoT as well. Sigh.
---
Psst 
---
Plank make
---
You don't really need to "flick" prayers but a lot of endgame PvM bosses require you to switch between different protection prayers as well as gear, sometimes almost simultaneously, very often.
---
A lot of OSRS bossing is interface management so I'm not really sure if it'll be up your alley.
---
He was just one level away from 99 prayer ouch
---
I was telling people at fishing trawler to type ::bank. First person to respond is an UIM saying he hasn’t got a bank.
---
Once it really sunk in how much of a 3 brain cell move this was, I closed RS and went for a depression nap
---
Shit I never knew how much I wanted this until now
---
He also died for full ancestral max set the other day in two claw specs, it's pretty obvious! He's just trying to do it in a way that he can justify if he gets looked at. No one in the history of runescape has put on redemption risking that much, especially someone who has PKed since 2004.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good on him, runescape's gone to shit.
---
&gt;One Kick Rick
---
I genuinely have no idea what that is, sorry. Is it the guy who makes Ironman videos or something?
---
Low lvl with 1b got lucky with a tbow split change my mind.
---
Well you bought yourself an afternoon at pest control, in terms of items lost that's not terrible to get back.
---
dude is in multi and has like 5 seconds of warning too
---
They plan something, probably planned it out for a while, just to ruin someone’s day. Also rot is known for cheating in osrs so... 
---
Also, you sound like a rot member
---
Doesn’t make sense
---
sounds gay
---
Been doing it over the last 3 days, and I’m stuck on Dragon at about 3k tokens dry. Pour one out for me 🙃
---
no, because they're actual neckbeards
---
hi ilovezezima,
---
thank you for your questions, I will attempt to answer them below
---
Accidentally shift dropping helm thinking they were arrows
---
Absolutely no reason at all
---
Multiple baccy cones
---
May as well, everyone trying to play games with my money.
---
Christ has returned boys.
---
You were trying to get a Clue Scroll. Just like us, and that thief over there.
---
Well now I have nothing to cover up my hairline so very embarrassed, haven't logged on since
---
absolutely not
---
What is the context? How is this even applicable to other situations ?
---
I’m lazy and don’t read the comments but I’d suggest working on getting a dragon defender from the warriors guild
---
Luring noobs to the monks north of falador. Telling them if they pick up the wine of zamorak they can sell it for 100k and when they pick it up u could close the door so he would die inside to the monks..
---
Planned to ruin someone’s day aka PvP in the PvP zone lmao. If you don’t want to die to pkers don’t go into the wild.
---
I don't know if hiring a guy to constantly shift between worlds banning people would really help that much.  The bots would just all log off when they know that guy logged in or bans one of them.
---
Wasn't the guy who got 99 construction, and literally did nothing wrong perm banned along with Durial? I don't understand why that guy got banned.
---
Haha yeah I'm def not 920 kills in without a pet this is fine
---
Yeah, the HCIM series. I just watched the whole thing, so seeing the demon mask and claws and all that reminded me of it. Pretty good.
---
Grats
---
Had to do it to em
---
HOLY FUCK LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF ADS, THERES MORE ADVERTISEMENTS THAN FUCKING CONTENT
---
It doesnt even need to be decent to run runescape. I've found outdated 50$ laptops at swat meets that can run it lol...
---
Inferno healers heal too fast to out damage
---
That’s not even the point I’m trying to make. I couldn’t see a rot member understanding anyway
---
He did some commentary on Caveman Only's podcast. If you haven't seen it
---
no more questions please just f
---
Yes OP reposted it ofc
---
I gave 10K away yesterday on the North side of the GE!
---
Or maybe his pc is crap
---
Gujuo gave me the pass, I swear! He told me to say it really loud in Shilo Village in front of the other natives instead of using my bull roarer
---
idk how else to explain that in saying if u have fun you're gaming for the right reasons but it's obviously a waste of time because it will never further your real life ? hey man maybe if u get that twisted bow drop u can sell for 1000$ but if that's y you're playing I'm amazed
---
F2P ran out of ess so they just stopped training mage.
---
Can i reanimate bloodveld heads and have them count for my slayer task?
---
Which quest did he ask about?
---
Which you could make in less than 15 hours.
---
OSRS is a game that needs hundreds, or thousands of hours.
---
Lol rc xp
---
They’re pretty afk, and you never have to bank or drop fish, you just use a hammer on one and it breaks them all down into stackables
---
That’s the thing, if I put payed members with bonds it doesn’t give the option to put my card info in.
---
Pissing me off lol
---
I met n0valyfe in the Lumbridge castle basement. Will never forget.
---
Welp, I'll just say it. 
---
That was fucking dumb and among the lowest of quality "me ea" to ever grace this sub. Couldn't even be bothered to add video to the video lmao.
---
Slayer is slow?
---
Give a man a gold and he will be rich for a day, teach a man how to make gold and he will be rich for a lifetime
---
Can you get a Rune kiteshield drop or a rune square shield drop from the zombies Rare drop table in the Stronghold of Security?
---
I love the young people
---
But they did tell you how to improve and then downvoted when you ignored what they said.
---
ya but 35 xp per
---
That was sovereign
---
Skill may have.
---
Literally just found this series and finished the 18th episode this afternoon. Extremely happy to see another episode is on the horizon :)!
---
In fairness the 111s have fairly poor accuracy as they rarely hit me even on my pure
---
Yep, [totally not real](https://preview.redd.it/186jy1msg1o21.jpg?width=1000&amp;height=523.560209424&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614d941d1c9c7594cb86355d6dc687f93c165cf1). [Not a single person traded there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwHBzjs88dg).
---
I play on the phone every day to and frm work and sometimes when I'm out. Uses 20.5mb per month
---
Where in the post does it say he owns a car you idiot
---
I don't get it? :(
---
kodai is a pretty big upgrade. ely is not.
---
bow makes 68 &amp; 69 much faster/easier.
---
**Swamp man good**
---
Honestly bro, whether its the CEO, the cleaner or anyone in between I'm happy that they took five minutes out of their day to do something kind for me.
---
I said stream sniping is griefing so they’re breaking the rules, no need to think if it should be against the rules or not because it already is. 
---
Stream sniping is griefing in every single game out there.
---
In conclusion, my dick hard
---
Dope style, very very clean
---
you could just try it in nmz and see if it gives the message about "despite not having a stake" etc
---
aww
---
He has risen from the swamp.
---
Kbd/zulrah/vorkath. Wont be the most efficient due to stats but theres no stopping you really. Go for it
---
Its the stam pot bridge all over again
---
Almost all banks had some trade. Getting into W2 took time (it was always full, so you had to keep clicking log in or use something like swift kit to do it for you), so unless you needed to buy something special there was no reason to go to w2.
---
Hard disagree. If you're happy with where you are in life then its defo not a waste.
---
Sounds like you aren't though.
---
Have you checked you haven't hidden attack npc option? Youd be surprised how many people forget and blame jagex.
---
Where did I say that?
---
Thankyou
---
I shouldn't have laughed as hard as I did
---
I know dude it’s insane. I might go pro in RS. See my secret is I look before I right click
---
Don’t tell anyone though
---
we need to get everyone to send an email to [tipoff@jagex.com](mailto:tipoff@jagex.com) with the subject "RSN: Lunatic Levi" and file complaints. I'm personally going to hop worlds and find people who he has griefed and ask them to submit complaints. He is a toxic player that is ruining the fun of corp for the community.
---
i want one

nowhere is safe

aw fuck man

The perfect strategy for Connect 4 has actually already been found. So if you're using engine help, it's essentially 50:50, winner being who goes first.
---
Hello! I am in a similar situation as you. I am a 21 year old man that also has Autism.
---
Is there any advice you could give me in regards to getting my foot in the workforce door? I try not to think of it as a disability, but sometimes, it feels like the whole world is against me. Not to mention the high unemployment rate (85%) of individuals with Asperger's/Autism.
---
Also, do you have any motivational philosophies you follow that keep your spirits up when it all seems so grim?
---
The prospect of independence is appealing, but getting there seems impossible.
---
Thank you, and much love.
---
As a man with large fingers missclicking can be a serious issue on mobile.
---
Why would rot kill a hardcore ironman innocently streaming his deep wild adventures? Fucking no honor clan.
---
and it's almost over :(
---
This is classic
---
I was doing fire wave for a bit. Ended up around 70k per hour at 6gp/xp. Didn’t feel like the cost was acceptable when I can do plank make for free/slight profit or go burst for 300k an hour for like 3.5 gp/xp. Didn’t feel like the extra 20m price of afking was worth it. If I finish maxing melee while at work and mage isn’t done then I’ll reevaluate.
---
Wat
---
Castle Wars.
---
One of the things that appeals to me about both the gym and RS is that both are low mental effort. I have enough anxiety you'd think my middle name was panic, and really at its core anxiety is: you think too damn much, about everything, and it spirals out of control. 
---
So activities where I can make slow but consistent progress just by putting in the time, without having to do crazy amounts of thinking, can be a bit of a relief. Gym, meditation, and on the more fun side of things, RS. 
---
I think that also explains the drug connection. When I was younger and smoked weed I loved playing RS high for the simple reason that I didn't need to think, I could just click a tree once a minute and chat with friends in the mean time.
---
Up to you in terms of how active you want to be and what kind of cost is acceptable. Afk plank make is around 80-85k and free.
---
Hope it’s 30-40 minutes and on HB... oh wait D&amp;D would have settled De-Ironman his account and become a poetic pker..... 
---
LUL
---
Stringing is more afk but you break even with mahog. The most efficient way is through bursting slayer/ just getting xp by playing the game.
---
3 take it or leave it.
---
This gives me war flashbacks of a goblin who will remain nameless and his accursed wheel

we need to go deeper

Are you the lowest Ironman with champions cape?
---
yes
---
bro message me ig ink doubt
---
Crandor
---
40 hour weeks @ $70/hour even if you worked 52 weeks all year is only $145,600.  How is that pushing over $200,000/year?  Just like that, I no longer care to try to explain this to you.
---
Only sort a video yesterday were he survived and why he turn off protection prayer
---
What the fuck is going on. It's not even Monday my man
---
You can't afk kraken because itll eventually kill you
---
K
---
I like how part of you disappears outside of the tile you're standing in when you fall down lmao
---
Only trails is good. He can only progress the account for the clue he has at the moment except hunter for imps to get clues, combat also for clues and construction that has no clue req for hidey holes.
---
"Making 120k is shit for a big city"
---
why not
---
Hey guys, noob here
---
Could anyone tell me roughly what fight caves are and how easy it is to get the fire cape?
---
Ive got 85+ melee stats, 92 ranged, 67 magic, 89 HP, 46 Prayer.
---
Is there any stats i should improve before going for the fire cape?
---
Thanks
---
Can the Blade of Saeldor have a re-polled spec (or potential passive)? The weapon seems a bit bland if its just a degradable slash weapon with the stats of the Rapier. Currently, there's nothing different or unique about it seeing as its just a slightly upgraded Tent whip that'll cost more and have involved maintenance because of Crystal shards.
---
Hey look, it's will smith!
---
anyone else think he was spammed so much because he did it on stream?
---
Although I don't doubt that he would be assaulted by pms off stream.
---
The other commenters didn't mention it, but here's a decent start, with improvements in the comments: 
---
https://youtu.be/9b27yBAurx4
---
(The kraken boss whirlpool they mentioned is great too but has a high requirement)
---
damn I didn't even notice the helm on the ground!
---
How is that on purpose? He was just used to people attacking him all the time and thought he would easily get away like other times
---
ayy thanks fam
---
Do mine now!
---
I got tangle root at 82 farm on papayas, then giant squirrel at 80 agil on relekka course.
---
I tried to do some rough math on the squirrel myself, think it's a. 3% chance of having got it when I did? But I don't know how accurate that is. How lucky was I and can I ever expect anything good to happen in my life ever again?
---
Sry but someone explain the origin of this crab thing and what it has to do with jagex? I don’t understand the meme, thank you.
---
But what do we put next to Grand exchange inside the party room next to the Grand exchange 🤔
---
Maybe just call it an exchange
---
America has more than one time zone, brainlet
---
Here are some tips:
---
I don't agree with people saying to not use pots on certain brothers given your stats.
---
Maybe consider not using prayer on Torag. Otherwise I would personally.
---
Don't use prayer on the regular monsters in the tunnels.
---
You mentioned you use magic shortbow. Consider imbuing it if you haven't already.
---
Consider putting some money into prayer levels as the restoration of ppots scales with prayer level. (You save prayer pots if you have a higher prayer level)
---
Learn to prayer flick. Even lazy flicking can save you quite a bit of prayer points per brother.
---
I've found that killing Ahrim drained a lot of my prayer when my range level and gear wasn't so good. Getting a higher range level and better gear will help with Ahrim.
---
If you consistently use 4 ppots per run and want to make money from Barrows, I would come back when your stats are higher.
---
Then we have a good system.
---
YOU ARE HIDING A CHILD
---
Leaving aside whether he should have been streaming or not while on multi in the Wilderness, it is so sad because he was so close to 99 prayer and leaving Wilderness for a good while
---
jagex is really lowering the player skillcap here. this game becomes more casual every day. tsk tsk
---
only the smartest and most skilled deserve to click on the bank deposit
---
75 is fine for both, 85 Range makes DS2 a piece of cake.
---
It's obviously fake. The value doesn't even add up. You have 1.7b in ether but it says 304b
---
I finished MM2 on my ironman recently who is around base 75. You'll be fine as a normie because you can dark bow the boss and take brews (probably won't need them). I strongly recommend the agility route for the tunnels.
---
Medium treks you have to kill some of the enemies before evading so you can't do the 30-40 treks per hour that easy trekking lets you do.
---
Evading also doesn't give you reward score, so he'd have to actually complete the events - adding more time on top. Medium reward tokens only give twice the xp that easy tokens give, but they take much more than twice the time.
---
guy probably subconsciously wanted to get a life, lol.
---
more of these! ed would make a great meme
---
My last uni exam is on Friday and now i have something to watch in the exam

Uwunar?

The just ok exchange
---
Then use a better algorithm to generate credentials you goon. Or use previously leaked credentials on many of the publicly leaked files as well as an algorithm.
---
This guy isn't a genius, or he wouldn't use an obvious .exe
---
Nah
---
28 yo, first rs experience 03/04 ish, started playing seriously 07.
---
Kind of is an accomplishment because he had to make a bazillion cannonballs to do this.
---
and turn off magic prayer too cause that's for pussies.
---
Glad the guy got what he wanted, he can finally have a break
---
We want in game poker. Many other games have done it, it would be fun, we could socialize, and be a nice gold sink.

Yeah but official client is literally garbage, zero features and runs terrible. I've spent like 1.5k+ hours on this game but would quit in a heartbeat if I was relegated to having to play on the official client

Theres a reason this game is known for having the worst community in gaming history

---
First off (and kinda unrelated), even for an F2P pker you'll want it to be P2P. Training is so much quicker as a member, and you may even end up needing to remake account if you don't properly calculate quest rewards into your build when you make the transition into P2P pking.
---
As far as stats... Check out a combat calculator. I think the meta for F2P is range (Shortbow + arrows) --&gt; R2H for KO potential, so something with 1 defense / 40 atk / X str / X range would be best. Your str and range levels depend on what combat bracket you're aiming for, but overall you should have them both as high as possible without effecting your combat level (So for example, with 40 ATK 60 STR 60 HP you could have up to 67 range while still staying level 47). As far as prayer goes, you'd have to do the math with a dps/max hit calculator since it'll heavily depend on your gear / stats / etc... But in most cases it's better to have some prayer than none.
---
After you get comfortable with F2P pking you'd want to decide what kind of build you wanna go with. I'm not a PKer so maybe someone with more experience could chime in... But I think it'd be best for you to decide on a strategy first then build your account to maximize on that strategy.

Remove the duel arena and you will see a decrease in people buying gold.
---
Lets test it
---
You know you can just splash them all in the arena and afk it if you have the correct staff for the spell
---
I don't know why people are down voting you. It would certainly benefit the FBI, having everyone's RuneScape details.
---
If you use runelite you can set left click to pickpocket.
---
Is honestly the only feature I think is too strong
---
Remember when you could do nmz/splash for 6 hours while you slept?
---
Pepperidge farm remembers
---
dds max hits are much higher, and it only uses 25%
---
You not having time to play does not mean the game should be easier.
---
I see this way too much here
---
"I can only play 1 hour a day, I should be able to get the progress of someone playing 6"
---
The average rs players IQ isn't high enough to detect sarcasm
---
Found someone in the end thanks man
---
I doubt that they would instantly sell their massively awesome collections.
---
Isn’t chally better in some instances though, when the target is larger than 1 tile.
---
Yeah man I don’t have the best luck in the wilderness tbh I play mainly on mobile so logging out quick enough when I see someone usually results in my death so a bit sceptical
---
Because theres no way to check if someone is a dude or not in a game and its only safe to assume its a dude. Irl its easy you just touch the crotch and scream MY BAD that was totally intentional btw.
---
You're rarely going to find straight answers here. I suggest using the wiki for questions like that, it's correct the majority of the time
---
You're most likely going to train these some day anyway, so why not train them now and enjoy the benefits already? :)
---
If they did tho... that would be crazy. Ironmen have white stacks of resources just chillin in the bank.
---
Most annoying question.
---
The two of you there would be great
---
I would wager that we have a lot of Sheldon's in here.
---
Look at the people with people pets
---
Yeah it's annoying, but this is not what gives the community a bad name lol
---
The guys wasting his time trolling(baiting a reaction from people), it's best to just ignore and move on.
---
No need to stoop to their level
---
If you splash then you can just x log since you’ll be getting attacked by the mage, it’s single way in the arena
---
The Karamja Party Pack.
---
*-Double takes-*

F..Fuck!

I wasnt suggesting that this single act is what ruins the game... it's the mentality and demeanor of most of the people who play including the guy in this post

---
I get this a lot ever since I changed to my new computer and I find it takes ages to log in onto my main.. however any other account it works perfectly fine strange shit
---
Probably, chances are that a lot of resources will shoot up in price too as a result of the skilling bots being harder to make.
---
I'm a grown ass man and that sound stresses me out lol
---
No every youtuber does not. I also believe clickbait thumbnails were made against twitch tos a while back. The difference between other youtubers thumbnails and yours is the one you used is 100% fake and making it look like something that happens in the video. 
---
With your ideas on YouTube and attitude towards people I am not surprised you get downvoted to hell. The other subs just never downvote you because literally no one even looks at your stuff. You can tell by the 0 upvotes and 0 comments
---
honestly it's because most people try this boss once or twice and never go back cause its kinda shit.
---
are we not going to discuss the penis shaped air bubble
---
It's also worth mentioning that easy custom rumble is a **lot** better for afking, assuming that you don't care as much for nightmare zone points.
---
Hard rumble gives more points, but the monsters attack and strength levels are much higher so you'll have to re-absorbtion a lot more frequently.
---
armadyl best god actually.
---
Lmao I just realized this wasnt the thread about runecrafting. It isn't worthless its called fun ya dingus.
---
I don't think that's how it works
---
Let’s put a dungeon on it that gives you polypore staff
---
This is so bad. In the collection log yes, but I pk people all the time and get over 100k in coins..... so bad
---
Weird flax but okay
---
Because cb thumbnails are literally against yt TOS. Why would someone not downvote you if they click a video expecting 1 thing but you actually did something else? That is the exact reason it is against tos. If you want to be a youtuber let the video grow and be good on it's own merits not by lying to get view counts.
---
I did not even bother watching the video once I saw you just lied about what the content was so now idk if it is good or not. If you were honest in the thumbnail maybe I would have enjoyed it and subbed and watched your other videos but there is no sense in wasting my time.
---
Must be some broken bot cuz I shit you not every time I go by that bridge above the arenas he's sitting there at the same angle and everything and never moves.
---
Nope. CHally hits higher but it is so slow that the dagger is still better DPS on most things.

Ok , so why is this one downvoted then. Lets start on something else. Not clickbait , still downvoted
---
Am definitely not twelve.  Runecrafting is bad, warding has potential, $11 is a lot of money.
---
Project much, or are you 12 and don't understand money at all?
---
Because people didn't like the video. Idk haven't watched it and I cant specifically say why people disliked it. All I can say is what you did wrong in the video we were discussing
---
No one saying anything about the guy that got skull tricked
---
Don't forget you can also report it for misleading/fake thumbnail
---
2k kills in 3 minutes total is even more insane.
---
Varrock was overhauled (late 06?), lots of minor layout changes like the fountain, it also added the npcs in the church, the stray dog, newspaper seller. Probably some other shit too
---
Pretty inaccurate and unspecified question?
---
Not as dumb as the guy who dropped his Tbow at Zulrah and then died. 
---
Value warnings exist for a reason!
---
spooky
---
I mean he obviously didn't care that he died.
---
I have one employee under me at work that does this all the time even though I've given him literal lists of everything that needs done. So sick of it lol
---
Best way to protect yourself is to just bring 3 valuable items that you will keep on death, and super budget items for anything else you might want to bring. This means even if you get pked you only lose like 100k and some of your time.
---
You can still get them from bh store, unless emblems go up there’s not much room for gains on the seeds tho

Hey bros. Just wanting to know the most efficient afk melee NMZ method for mobile. Currently doing ammonite crabs at work for my 12 hour shifts but having to check every 5 mins is hard. 75 base melee stats.
---
Love it
---
Rot's 100? I'm struggling to find the other 70 you saw
---
What would you use the points on instead? If all your weapons/jewelry were upgraded already
---
So you say pet every kill?
---
Nope, very rarely do I call a drop but as soon as I said pet I just knew in my feels that it was coming.
---
I'm calling bullshit; lava EHP sub 99 without runners is 72k, which is with crafting cape and just using giant and large pouch. With using all 4 pouches and 2 duelling rings you wil require to use the bank 3x per run instead of 2x. 
---
You're getting 50k at best, and even less without the huge pouch.
---
Vorkath isn't the difficult one anyway
---
Sounds like you’re just projecting

probably obby set with absorbs and normal rumble, still go down to 1hp but just locator orb every few minutes when you can pay attention.

Download runelite and turn on the nmz notification feature. It’ll tell you in your chat box when the boxes are ready and it takes 30 seconds to do
---
Ofcourse it's a personal choice, agreed, given the state the game is in, but can we agree that's it's not necessarily right/fair that if they want to keep their status in tact than it's a wise choice to avoid some content such as random events like a disconnection from the game server side?
---
I agree it's not possible to make it 100% but I'm more than confident that there's much more room for improvement. I'm sure more HCIM would be willing to risk their status at TOB if disconnections were significantly decreased and weren't such a factor in many of the top HCIM losing their status because of this.

Before I saw the name of the sub, I was like "no way!" And then I realized it actually _was_ an intentional reference to the Karamja smuggling.

The servers are severely bogged down, I have been terribly inconvenienced anytime I try to hop, usually 10+ seconds, logs me out to relog to wait another 10-15 seconds. Outside of the 1/3 chance of error loading profile I also got a new one, no reply from login server. please wait 1 minute and try again.
---
The reason to do normal is to be able to afk without having to lower HP without it mattering much. On normal, you can set 4 bosses that only have a max hit of 3.

---
Honestly your idea sounds like Calvin ball. You make up whatever you want whenever you want. It's the same thing as people saying "why can't you scale raids to the person's level, that way newer players can experience the continent". Having no limitations on a game about progression and the journey defeats the purpose of the journey. Why would I do a quest to unlock a new piece of content if I can just make the piece of content and enjoy it outside of the original game? All of what you're suggesting sounds like you want a new game, you love RuneScape but you want something different. Don't shoehorn something that is working and isn't dying for the sake of your boredom. It sounds like you want to play Minecraft or Gary's mod with a OSRS skin overtop. This isn't a suggestion for quality of life changes, this is a make a new game plea
---
I just created a new account to test the process for you, it worked fine for me.

Could you take a screenshot of wherever you are trying to change your name?

That’s what I just said
---
To be fair, there is already pretty real item sink in the form of high alching. It doesnt really work well for the super high tier items since their HA value is always quite low compared to their realistic value(yo lemme just alch my rapier for a sweet 2m real quick), but why else would something like a rune 2h still be 37k?
---
 If the value of any item drops 300 below its HA value, people will start buying them up to turn them into gold.
---
Wildy boss that requires you to be skulled, full item risk
---
You're not alone - I've experienced this too
---
I mean the "worth" is your own perception, I can't tell you whether you'd enjoy something or not.
---
"End" as in "close to nothing left to do" is 2000 hours of playing, so there's plenty of game to play.
---
I'd suggest playing the game for a bit and seeing how you like it, otherwise it's hard to gauge whether you'd enjoy the grind or not.
---
I have to agree. RS is a different game when you don't have to worry about actually losing anything
---
Honestly, not a bad idea

Why not just solo on your birthday
---
if you dont mind taking 2 hours to do caves you can do it basically afk with guthans. if you can borrow gear you could probably nmz a fight caves ready char (for noobs, not like 1 pray shit) within 2 weeks
---
Sitting on offensive prayers drains too much imo. Plus it's more to switch between phases. The loss from that cuts out a lot of the theoretical gain. If you're going to pray, I would just prayer flick during parts where you don't need to switch gear or defensive prayer to avoid the drain.

I’m a bit out of the loop on scape, are they getting rid of dhide and gmauls or something?
---
I get not polling changes that are from updates or development that was already polled and not released as expected, only within 1-2 weeks, as a patch fix. Anything after that, they are causing more harm. Especially an item from the legit 2007 version of the game. Whoever does this, I hope gets fired for being a moron.
---
I’m just glad no one is pointing out the Dick Bubble in the bottle.
---
They are making them less overpowered as black d hide has insanely high mage def and killing someone with a gmaul is very easy
---
It's the first thing I saw, then was thinking no it's a bubble not d***o stuffed in a wine bottle, then saw its 2007scape sub, and that this is meant to be rum...

Let's be honest, you can implement the entirety of this change just by swapping the house music track to Sea Shanty 2.

Hey I understand a reference on this sub finally!
---
No, changing spec and changing dhide so that it hurts melee when worn. Which makes no logical sense in the first place. It is a more agile armor with less defense but more magical defense for a reason lol. It fits lore, and common sense.

People who comment on every meme/shitpost to declare it a repost: What is it you are gaining from that? I see it all the time, and I just don't understand what value there is in going into a thread and saying "I have seen this before."
---
There is extremely high level content that players need to invest 1000's of hours to reach. There are end game raids and challenges like Inferno that very few players complete. 
---
That said, this game is about enjoying the journey. The grind is absolutely enormous and nobody would spend 2000 hours to reach Theatre of Blood (raid #2) if the 2000 hours themselves weren't enjoyable. The grind takes different forms through the game's life, but it's meant to be enjoyed every step of the way. 
---
There aren't really builds in this game. With few exceptions, every character uses all three combat types (melee, range, mage) and may even need to use multiple within the same fight. Weapons and spells are stats based so any player with a certain magic level can use a spell, there are no skill trees. Damage is based on stats and gear, so players are looking to have the best gear possible, there is next to no room for customization. Builds really aren't a thing.
---
If you want builds, this isn't the game for you. But if you like building towards and endgame and progressing a character, this game is fantastic. As your character levels up and acquires new gear your power level goes through the roof, but there are always bigger and badder (and more rewarding!) things to fight. 
---
I absolutely recommend giving OSRS a try. It's a niche game and not for everybody, but if it clicks with you it's phenomenal. Fun community/memes, developers are active with the community, and I find the game super rewarding.
---
I mean that's pretty irrelevant. An unskulled death in wild vs a regular death in terms of lost items are pretty much the same, the difference is who can see it and the timers. What you lose is irrelevant.
---
 I was just looking at the thread MattK had the other day for some reason. It's the most controversial post on this sub I think. It's hilarious how people were saying , "I'm not homophobic but this has no place in my game!!!!1!1!1!" 
---
Really opened my eyes up that a majority of the osrs community on Reddit is homophobic
---
Of course not!

Yes I've had it 2 days ago, tried relogging again, no problems, so don't worry about it.

You can't buy bonds with GP on an ironman

There are a couple variations.  60 attack and either 70 def or 75 def, or 75 attack and 75 def. the latter is 109 combat thought so that’s approaching main status.  Always have 77 prayer though for piety/rigour/augury
---
unskulled wild death and regular death are not at all similar in terms of items lost
---
Put the ge inside the party room and just make a bunch of party portals in good locations
---
And obviously the untradeables are different but that's not what this discussion is about. I'm asking if npc vs player source of death affects the timers used.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Thanks you too!
---
retweet
---
I'd definitely rather have the accuracy over hitting an extra +1 with the FC
---
Damn just wiped on jad 2nd run. Seems like my ping is high when it comes to switching prayers.. lol
---
Yes they are haha. This discussion is not about the effect on untradeables. So barring that, tell me how they are different? I'm not trying to argue about something that my post is not about. I'm asking about timers based on source of death
---
Mom said its my turn to post this shit meme
---
The idea is to get rid of prayer pots in a useful manner for more drops
---
Ziggys comment gave a good break down of the GP P/H you can expect :)
---
And by  meet me I mean I wouldn’t be geared just with loads of food to survive the journey and to pick your stuff up if it’s like the PvP (don’t worry I’ll get it back trust me)  and if it not than either I’ll wait for you to come and get your things or deliver them TO you... wouldn’t be an asshole and take your things especially since I didn’t kill you and it was to test a theory
---
Dang, that's commitment to the raid
---
Tbh I fucking love my Herb Sack. 
---
But yeah, slayer points eventually just stack up and there isn't much to spend them on other than skips or rearranging your block list. I've got like 2500 right now and I can't see it dropping any time soon.
---
But did you drink it?
---
LOL I aint worth it, 3 fire runes for me
---
You answered your own question, you can go for a serker or any other kind of pker or just go full main and go pk at 126 😂
---
mind telling me how you got the health bar by the inv there?
---
If it's so easy, do it yourself.  I think you will find that it's extremely difficult to get to the top level, where you have to consistently produce interesting and high quality content.  $25k is poverty level even for a single person.  If any person is providing entertainment for hundreds of thousands of people then it seems reasonable to expect a decent income.  $100k sounds reasonable if that's what he's making.  It's a free market
---

Are you using the browser version or a phone? Recently they switched to what they call "fancy pants editor" which is like MS Word, you can highlight stuff and click a button and it will make it bold. You can't use markdown (the thing you're doing) in the new one. There's a way to switch back to the old one though! Theres a button on it somewhere. Or you can Google it. Idk how exactly. I use an app mostly. I just try to point this out to people when I see stuff like like that! I got your back.

Doesn't even have to be untradable just make it rare as fuck so it will be expensive and then people will bring gmaul only as a +1 which will help deter the overpowered ags/claws + gmaul combo unless they want to risk losing the Gmaul attachment/ags/claws.
---
I would fucking quit.

100k for maybe 3 minutes of your time each Day is bad?

CoX alt for when I'm doing less intensive skilling on my main. This turns into a rune dragon alt when I'm doing more intensive skilling on my main.
---
Should get the slayer for BBDs though.
---
2 bottles per hour maybe
---
Since your account is still low level and not near maxed yet for a pure, I’d recommend making a separate account for defense- a zerk or med build or even a main for example.  
---
I currently only play on one account that is a pure, but in rs3 pre eoc I had two accounts, a zerker and a pure.  That way you can enjoy both aspects without ruining the pure
---
Took me 74 games to complete it on my Ironman all the manga rays and other fish I got made it somewhat worth it

Did you seriously just argue that $11/month is a lot of money when you add it up over time? Wow, with big brain logic like this, you must be going places in life. Everyone watch out for this mathematical genius laying down this heavy bit of knowledge for us all to bathe in. No shit, you can use the same logic for haircuts, gas, or any other purchase. When you break down the cost against the time most of us spend playing, it's really not that much. But, I guess that's subjective though. If you increase the frequency of $11 to weekly or even daily, then it adds up to be a lot of money to me. But subjectively, to me, $11/month isn't much compared to the entertainment value I get in return.
---
Yes, I called RC boring. 90% of this game is boring. With a few exceptions, Runescape isn't exactly known for its engaging, exciting, dynamic, gameplay. You click your mouse a few times and watch Netflix or do some work. RC isn't any more boring than catching chins, rooftop agility courses, or WinterTodt. Even farming Vorkath all day gets boring.
---
You don't need to locator orb/cake every minute/every 5 minutes for hard rumbles.

I have been doing the exact same thing on hard for hours. It's objectively more xph. The only proof he provided was of respawns, but even with acceptable respawns, your xph drops by 20% or more doing normals.

That sounds awesome! Glad to see that the RNGods have rewarded you for the DOLO effort!
---
Rune dragons seem like a good shout but you may need to get the meee stats to base 90's to see a real good profit.
---
Saying that, Dragon Hunter Crossbow at Rune Dragons may be a nice idea!
---
That's 100k/day for just using minigame teleport and running some squares, it's faster than buying Varrock diaries battlestaff, also buy you half of a bond every 14~15 days.
---
Honestly the Galaxy S4 was my absolute favorite phone. If they made that exact phone with an updated processor I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
---
Balance changes follow under integrity fixes, which is understandable as most votes for thier own interest instead of the game's. However, in this case, gmaul and  dhide being overpowered is highly debatable. Gmaul is terribly ineffective against reasonble defense adn they should not be trying to balance the game around pures. As for d hide...it's simply too cheap, but the same goes for xerician so if they nerf it based on its price, then that should be nerfed as well.
---
No.
---
Could it use a nerf? Yea, probably
---
It's also a bummer that the majority of cannonballs and provided by bots
---
But all that being said, the cannon is a critical items for pures and low-mid lvl accounts training slayer. Many tasks would just not be worth it if a cannon couldn't be used

You can’t get a bond because you can’t use the ge.
---
But in terms of money making most ironmen I know power to 50 firemaking then do wintertodt to 99. Decent drops, will get you a fair amount of ores/herbs/seeds for later.

No, just downloaded it on my PC and started a new account. Its when you have to pick a name on tutorial island

No pvm counts. If the guy killed you doesn't pick ur stuff up it stays there for you like pvm death up to an hour and other players can't see it

You have a problem

How did he have a death count of 4 and still have his HC status prior to DC?

It’s more like virgin fire cape vs Chad infernal cape

I'd love to train runecrafting on a pc in runescape
---
It was pretty responsive to be honest, the times I died were definitely my error. I use a pixel 3, i do notice worse performance on the game on my old s6 thought, haven't tried had on it. It's more awkward than mouse and keyboard but didn't have to work on reaction time really
---
What the fuuuuuuuuck
---
The price probably changed.  Adjust your buy or sell offers to the new margin to buy and sell quickly.  You have to get a feel for items and how the margin moves.  It's possible that the volume dropped but I wouldn't try to attribute that to anything other than chance.  With high volume stuff it takes a few people dumping millions worth of the item to cause a significant change.
---
Yep, that's basically how I think of it as well. I'm not going to spend the time grinding for bonds because I value my time outside of work, but I also refuse to stoop as low as just straight up buying bonds. I'm sure you could calculate it out how long you've been paying for membership vs how much you could have spent on just buying bonds. It could be worth looking into short term, BUT goddamn is it addicting/satisfying to get those fireworks above your head.   
---
Even just thinking about it a little, if my alt has been around for \~10 months, that's only $100 in membership, but i've made probably 200m+, so it's not even close to paying for that with bonds.
---
I’m 70/90/70 with 80 range as well. Got about 50 mil but money is not an issue, Ive been making a good few mil a day flipping so i can make more in no time. What’s something fun I can do? Is this a decent PK build at all? Can I do any bosses? My slayer is only 40 unfortunately but I don’t really want to grind it out. Just looking to spice things up a bit and have some fun.
---
Fuck I feel this shit to my core, took me around 90 games for that awful ugly shit green set. minnows are so nice though
---
Bless this crosssover

But they can only run RuneScape Classic

Desert bandits with full guthans is easier to afk with, although not quite as good exp rates. You can only do shared or defense exp though. You can afk the full 20 minutes to issue. Wear a ring of life for if you forget to check sometime.

Here to comment that the cost difference between black d’hide and mystic is about 106k. Much more than I figured, although both items are sitting basically at alchemy price. 
---
If mystics were cheaper maybe there wouldn’t be as much roar over it.
---
I read somewhere that someone suggested to keep god d’hide at its current stats and nerf regular d’hide which I am a huge fan of. Blessed d’hide is likely over 1m for the set so it seems just.
---
As someone posted here, magic defense armor should help you escape, but I do agree with others saying not at a cost of 8k for the gear.
---

Should I prioritise going from a rcb to a bp, over reg. trident to toxic trident at Zulrah?
---
My stats are 84 range and 82 mage, 71 def, 60 pray and 81hp.
---
Gear is mediocre at best and I want to know which upgrade : bp or toxic trident is better for me right now (ofc my 2nd upgrade will be the worse weapon).
---
Thanks in advance.

It isnt true and has never been true that crashing is a bannable offense. It is an mmo where resources are competitive. If someone has higher dps than you and wants a location it can be theirs no one has any claim to a location

Ikr. OP wrongly assumed based off the name.
---
Whats your mage lvl?   
---
A keen suggestion is to do Fight Caves and kill Jad (for that SWOLE looking Fire cape)
---
Don’t use a serp helm. It’s more expensive than using antivenoms and lowers both your range and mage. It’s a bad item for zulrah

Forced? Jagex forced you to participate? No they didn't, it was optional, like all holiday events. No one complains about Christian holidays being celebrated in rs, because it doesn't matter to normal people.
---
I agree. Some people here view RWT as the greatest sin imaginable and say shit like they hope the RWT and their family dies. That’s pretty fucked up imo. Seems like one of them already received their ban and that’s a punishment that fits the crime.
---
I don’t see anything wrong if someone wants to quit the game for good and sells their GP and takes the ban. If they wanna come back, that’s their own fault and they take responsibility.
---
&gt; Two weeks to get 130 combined stats between attack and strength isnt crazy, but I would think someone new to the game wouldnt tunnel on a dragon defender from the get go

---
I think it's a skill thing. 2 weeks ago I could only do 1 kill trips or none. Now at 200+kc, I am squeezing out 3 kill trips with the same exact gear. Start counting the attacks to prepare for phases and you'll take no damage from the specials. I did 50 kills with a rune crossbow.

Rune pouch with slayer points isn't worth it if you're not an ironman, as most bh clans only charge 1m for a rune pouch. Definitely buy the herb sack instead.

---
Looks good. Not a lot of homes for elves though
---
someone’s gunna give you free shit now, dw bro.
---
Yeah, RWT isn't a bad thing, the only bad thing about it is that it encourages botters to ruin the game. If a legit player wants to sell their gold I don't see a problem with that. They'll likely get banned and the economy of the game remains untouched.
---
Chad!

It looked fine in the app but i edited it so hopefully it looks fine everywhere else too now

Yes but we’re bringing it back into the spotlight

Weird im on the app and it didn’t look right. Thats strange

Imagine not bringing veng and the lumbridge diary ring for alchs
---
Fire battle staff most minmaxed for that -1.67 weight
---
the vambraces aren't bad enough. if you're still having trouble you can also splash with the cursed goblin staff from diango which has no bonuses but it will use more runes.

Such a waste...

Step 7: have friend tb and spec out when you lose
---
I don't know, I just assumed it was random. I haven't played runelink in forever either.
---
I think the defence from the Ward is it's greatest asset. The ability to switch from mage pray to ranged is huge imo, and ended up allowing at the very least an extra kill every trip.

There's about 30 viable ways to train magic depending on how fast you want to do it, how afk, or how expensive you want it to be.  Bursting is probably the fastest.
---
Aren't they just scams anyway?

*cries in Brazilian*
---
Nah that's pretty good. Faster than most people.

Getting them doesn't take 8 minutes. If you have the points saved up it's one quick teleport, grab them, you're out. Gone in 60 seconds.

It quite literally isn’t a political and contentious issue at the moment. It’s been federally legal since 2015, and the US was one of the last developed nations to get on board with it.

The only people who make this a “contentious issue” are hypocritical conservatives who scream “over-reaching government bad, don’t tread on me” yet are mad the state governments no longer have the ability to determine who can and can’t get married.

---
This is the straight up benefit to power creep that very few acknowledge when talking about new bis items. It's true that adding item sinks can accomplish this goal, but to continue your bcp example: what if they added a new boss, with a +5 str bonus plate? It is true that this is an upgrade to current bis, but the advantage is that it entirely resets this problem. The supply of bis plates immediately plummets to zero and this problem resets.

I think as long as the new areas are separated to some degree from the old areas (think Zeah) it's not much of an issue as you can play it off as simply the flora/fauna/architecture being of a different style due to the distinct nature of the region.

---
That feeling when you miss a huge unlock screen (like 60/70 attack, 60/70 defense, etc...) really sucks.
---
Looks dull, and looks almost ghostly. Not a fan at all. Might be one of the worst designs in the game.
---
It's a little mean to do this on his birthday :(
---
Great idea, it would have been great for QoL month. Hopefully they do it down the road
---
Yeah I think the same
---
alt\^2
---
Nice edit kiddo.
---
Thanks! I wasn't able to hear them clearly on that part and thought it was a world they made up.
---
I’ve gotten 5 pieces in 7 games
---
Sounds like a great plan man, thanks for all your advice!
---
You must be a mod in the chat
---
Dark Souls 2 and DmC Devil May Cry.
---
Monster.
---
This product isn’t meant for the average consumer so most people actually will not buy them. Production and photography businesses might.
---
uhm? not everybody is gonna 4 item it. theres always gonna be players with confident
---
M8 theyre literally depressing
---
ATL F4 doesn't duplicate items. It closes the window you're on 😂
---
minnows are the most gp/hr by quite a bit.
---
If you want to have a 0% burn rate 89 with gauntlets and the hosidious range is when sharks stop burning.
---
Even though rs economy is quite different from the real world one, i feel like playing the game has still taught me some basic understanding for the real world market.
---
Its a trap
---
Looks like someone needed a tbow to get his cape.
---
learning how to merch sparked my interest very young. I have a couple websites that sell random shit and some that sell stuff I'm interested in and I've made a great amount of money for my age doing that shit. s/o shopify
---
Our stats are almost identical, that gives me a little hope :)
---
Yeah, yeah, yeah big heart... but how big is his dick?
---
I like trains
---
Eh not really, I got cleaned by a keylogger as a kid after buying my first whip, so that taught me to not be a dumbass I guess lol
---
How’s that possible when the full set is 4 pieces? Can you get duplicates? If so, why would you continue lol
---
Or it's another alt he made to defend himself, like in the rs3 sub
---
I like its look. It's pretty much a crystal sabre and the slash equivalent of the rapier
---
I can't tell if they mean they are too young and their brain hasn't developed its full learning potential, or they are too old and their brain has already passed its full learning potential lol
---
Nahhh
---
Well if it doesn't have a program to pick up it's loot that's gp removed from the game so still a win
---
If you want to worry less about food I’d bring veracs helm/skirt. Otherwise it looks fine.
---
UPDATE: https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bx5yu2/update_the_dice_bot_has_been_terminated/
---
Haha yeah, I did become a little worried for a second. I read a lost about it being some kind of rollback and I got hella nervous because for the last 3 weeks I have been camping gargoyles 8 hours a day...
---
Yea I was getting that a ton yesterday. I even had one today that just said “cannot reach server. Try again in 1 minute”
---
maybe level to 85 but honestly I sold my bank for dhcb, using reg void, archers (i), salve (ei), bdhide boots, avas, anti dragon shield at \~88 ranged and it was the best decision I ever made. 3-4 kills per trip 2 minute kills on average, easily 2m+ an hour with garbage drops. I'm rebuilding my bank then going for ward and rigour.
---
Ah I didn't see that, czechmate Polak.
---
Lately designs have been horrible, basically everything after tob has been shit
---
I struggled quite a bit with jad at first, but now I can easily do Vorkath/Zulrah/CoX, and this was within a relatively short time span.
---
I am interested in leveling an alt for PKing, but my main is still a noob. I am still a noob. 
---
Any suggestions for getting into pvp as a new player? Are there any resources on the current meta and what kinds of builds can be effective? 
---
Right now I am planning on making a tele-tab alt for money, then converting the account to a pvp account once I have enough magic level.
---
 'Gamers' just have to realize that supporting gay people is not a political ideology.
---
😂😂🦀
---
I'll start cooking them right at 80. I should burn less than 8,000 or so total. With 115k raw sharks, I'm fine with that.
---
Imagine being so broke that you can't afford a Tbow in 2019 oh no
---
When should I change from Vannaka to Chaeldar?
---
I'm at 69 Att, 65 Str, 60 Def, 64 Mag, 43 Prayer and 55 Ranged. I just feel like every task I get from Chaeldar is super over my level or requires a lot more money to do the task with pots for prayer than what I get back from it.
---
I know what she did, and how awful it was, and I never watch her content, and I know you can't express anything but furious, passionate hatred towards her in this subreddit, but --
---
-- it's really starting to feel like 'runecraft bad.'  Like yes it IS bad, but after seeing the 10,000th "haha indeed RC bad!" or "Ugh indeed Emily bad!" thread get mass-upvoted it starts to feel like this sub is just repetitive zombies.  
---
Which, I guess makes sense
---
I edited it for fun, also blocked HP and prayer for the memes.
---
Same here
---
Fuck this picture, i cant get off unless i see that dirty little hook...nude hook, or atleast a stub, this picture does nothing for me.
---
can I wring her sweaty panties in my mouth when she's done slaying
---
Modern Christmas isn't a religious-exclusice holiday but nice try
---
ur a gay
---
Now **THAT** Blade of Saeldor I can get into
---
Not a big fan of the asymmetric design of the crystal armour, especially the female version. Something about the right shoulder being completely exposed just irks me
---
This^
---
She said she had cancer on one her streams for sympathy money. Then later on when questioned about it denies everything.
---
Is anybody else already starting to feel MEP2 PTSD from what looks like an agility obstacle in the quest sneak peek? Might have to train agility form now until is releases...
---
basically use a crystal on a dragon axe
---
[It's already in the game.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/e/e2/Enchanted_chicken.png?0b9b3)
---
It’s wonderful that they’re able to offer the full prize pool. 
---
I hope it’s run like Winter 2017. That one was excellent.
---
Yes, you get a roll for the drop after the kill too.
---
Loving everything but the armor and the blade. Tools look decent though. Guess we'll have to wait and see how it looks once it's added to the game though.
---
Can't see the Blade of Saeldor getting much use unless it's either better or cheaper than a rapier. Never really liked the whole charging gimmick anyway.
---
It'll also be cool to see what use the new crystal armor is gonna have.
---
My point is more that I didn't think it belonged there, not that they didn't have the right to out it there. They can do whatever they want but just because it's theirs doesn't mean I have to agree with it all
---
Am I being downvoted because I'm wrong and you actually **can't** win gp from a dice bot or because people don't like that you can win gp from a dice bot
---
Cows aren't real, you can't fool me
---
Wish my goals was this bad aswell...
---
I'd disagree. By explicitly stating he doesnt agree to the terms, I'd say he didnt agree.
---
All praise god ash
---
Love the perspective here
---
I haven't see as high as turn over than when I worked in a warehouse.
---
Where is this?
---
To "hack"? doubt it.
---
Your posts are removed because the mods run the dicing games. /s
---
I would try privately messaging them or maybe wait for a new questions/issues thread to surface and try there. I think privately messaging would be your best bet though.
---
I agree with you, pretty nice body, really nice small boobs, and then you see her face in like the 3rd pic and it kinda ruins the pic lmao
---
I mean I get it but also, ...bruh
---
I've done Simpsons crossovers too, haha. If you do see it on a bootleg merch shirt, snap a pic, I'll get a laugh out of it 😂😂
---
Unironical support.

TIP: wait for saturday night, you will be carried easy.

Would be too much like summoning maybe

Suspicions are high that he recently came from Karamja too

that's not how "hacking" works though.

you have a username, but you don't know if it's different from the login name, or the email, ect.

&gt; Suicide isn’t funny man.
---
A man walked into a library and asked for a book on how to commit suicide, the librarian responds with ”f... off you won’t bring it back!”
---
The more suicidal people there are the less suicidal people there are
---
Why did Hitler commit suicide? He saw the gas bill.
---
This is actually true tho.
---
Especially knowing that the more people see him responding to complaints, the more complaints he will receive for responses. We are truly undeserving of him.

Really nice. at this point jagex should just ask for community suggestions first before even making a design
---
So do I get 4x XP if I play on the in game computer and on that computer I play on the in game computer for that?
---
Yeah but that's going to be the case for a lot of people as they get older. Very few new players that are young play the game
---
It's supposed to be a crystal "long sword" why does it look like a mix between a scimitar and a machete.
---
27, fiancée and two kids. You're never too old to enjoy your free time in a way that you enjoy.
---
Have fun.
---
idk what you mean permitted, jagex has never explicitly okay'd any third party client. like runelite/osb/rl+/lyzrdlite/etc use at own risk.
---
Hm, interesting. How many crystal seeds for a new seed?
---
So this girl posts a pic of her tit on Twitter and has people in the comments saying “ew” and “what a perv” when the rsgloryandgold guy follows her?
---
nice
---
Dude don't listen to anyone saying is a bad investment, trust yourself and your gut, nothing great comes with no risk.
---
Just for inspiration, my uncle really wanted to start his own bar in the city he lived, it was his biggest dream. He sold his car, got all his money from the bank and did a couple of loans. His wife ended up divorcing him because of the many fights they would have because of money and financing the bar, he spent basically everything he had in his life in his dream.
---
In the end his bar had to close due to debts and no customers and he killed himself by jumping in front of a bus, but at least he never gave up his dream and that is the message I want you to keep.
---
Cheers mate and good luck.
---
We need 9/11 strike on that tower but should happen in 7/3
---
I disagree with this, they aren't all perfect the first pass but a lot of the new designs are really nice.
---
can i shit and cum in ur ass?
---
Imagine bragging about a runescape bank
---
Kruk's Dungeon. You visit it shortly after starting Monkey Madness II. It's the best place to train magic and ranged, with bursting and chinning respectively.
---
Then you meet the guy two weeks later, make friends with him, ask his dogs name etc.
---
Theres a reason guys like this exist and look for big RSNs:

lol, good luck :D

and when it arrives... ill SMASH IT WITH A HAMMER
---
Do normal nmz with the 5 weakest npc and just absorb. Youll have 20min of training (max u can ever do), then u just reabsorb when u check or restart dream
---
pass
---
can I get a nude Saeldor?
---
I'd drop some brews and restores for prayer pots. 8 brews and 4 restores should be plenty. Otherwise, I'd drop 6 restores for prayers. You'll need the prayer more than HP, and they are a good bit cheaper.
---
Mat K was her White Knight for a while iirc, banning people who criticized her for the whole cancer thing.
---
Shit bwana, that's all you had to say!*
---
Med just basically means 70-75 def. somethines higher
---
 Why would the owner have to win? They can just claim any win they want, nobody can verify it.
---
The issue with gambling is that they're player run, too many people got scammed; doing this they could add a tax and people would be able to play without middlemen
---
Sweet thanks, sounds like I'll do seers to 90 then brimhaven after that
---
Man this image reminds me of my early years of playing, no idea what I was doing and just mining rune essence.
---
Thats a man with a lady's bottom
---
I guess that’s probably why people traded at fally park at first.
---
It just means that it's very easy to get far fast if you know what you're doing.
---
Imo it's the shape of a leaf-sword, which has 2 edges designed for slashing. Think of 2 katanas taped back-to-back.
---
All the way from varrock?
---
Whyyyy couldn't this be a longsword instead? Jagex just why!
---
Why work on a gmaul pure when they are about to nerf the gmaul?
---
i consider myself lucky cause by the time i got to my 9th game of fishing trawler i got the full set....what are the odds lmao

2147m, nice

People without SGS, Guthans or any healing items

PLEASE JAGEX

Best of luck friend, I hope I never have to go down this road.
---
You must be partially or fully retarded, do you even know what fios is? Literally, you can not oversubscribe the nodes because it would take half the city to plug the bandwidth. I literally pay what you probably make in a week for my internet so rest assured. If you are going to be throwing stupid fucking statements out at least know what the fuck you are talking about. This is not comcast/xfinity shit that the whole neighborhood pops on and kills it at 5pm. I get \~880-950mb up/down have an amplifier in my house for wifi and a hard wire running to my Ethernet port on my desktop. This has happened at 3 locations and on mobile, so again retard boy take another shot.
---
ChadMatK
---
I didn't know this either... I thought they upgraded, it seems to be implied
---
this is 100% false
---
You can be overpowered but its not the same. 
---
So u can be OP in pvp but ur combat level isnt gunna be maxed so you will stil be weaker than max all stats. This is because u cant attack everyone in pvp, only those ur levels. Google “osrs pures”
---
Or u can be OP in pvm which requires just getting max combat skills and buying the best gear (expensive tho). In pvp u wont have any advantage cuz everyone will be maxed. Tho ur real life skills will carry you (like being good at the game).
---
He's taking Route 1 - it lets you evade any encounter. Route 2 you can only evade some, and Route 3 you can't evade any. The chosen route determines the colour of reward token you get. 
---
Whenever I do treks I take an Easy companion through Route 3 and just slug out the combat events. It's not max-efficiency but it makes the "time spent fighting" vs. "time spent navigating bogs" ratio more enjoyable. 
---
Off the top of my head I think the Easy/Medium/Hard companion determines the level of the enemies you encounter, which in turn determines the quantity of material rewards you get from picking anything like lobsters/bowstrings/coal+iron/etc, but you only ever get one tome of experience and the XP from it is random within a set range, so you might as well pick Easy companions if that's what you're after.
---
That’s what I said? The bot recognizes the owner trades it, then the owner inputs a value on the bot for how much was “traded”, faking the entire thing and giving it an insta win. That’s how the guy I knew did it
---
Best not to walk in at all then, I think
---
Really? To me, their's looks like crush. It's pretty rounded. Looks blunt. This at least has clear, sharp edges. 
---
It's also got a reasonable stab bonus, so a pointed tip makes sense.
---
Is this BDO?
---
Assuming OP wasn’t up to shady stuff, these kinda posts are actually scary to some extent.
---
Imagine just wanting to log in one day and you across your account being locked for no visible reason.
---
I really really like this design. Seeing as this is going to be a BiS weapon, it should really have a powerful looking design like this.
---
How do I private message them though? I don’t know where to find their names. Can you help me out?
---
NGL vastly prefer the existing design for the weapon. Your design is cool, but this isn't some mythic blade of man, it is elf made and elf based.
---
cmon man my brothers name is hitler
---
IMO it should remain asymmetrical
---
mate you take advice from wallstreet bets, I bet your portfolio is similar to your connection speed, SHIT LMAO
---
It's the only way to make some bosses less affordable. But doing demonics i gotta charge my blowpipe my Arclight, my barrows. Every other trip i gotta go recharge something which gets annoying haha
---
personally, and i mean no hatred by this, i feel like it looks somewhat uninspired and kind of typical. yeah the original looks bland too but maybe a mixture of your design and a different unique blade shape would look a bit better?
---
Looking good
---
You will not have the drink kimi
---
He tried to tank it and misclicked a ton.
---
U want to make a 40 atk/str 60 range 1 def f2p pker or multi pk in p2p. Dont try to just jump in and do what the streamers do. Work your way towards edge pvp then when ur confident u can do bridding.
---
Jagex's design reminds me of the orichalcum swords in skyrim
---
Ah, by "giving an insta win" yoou mean what the bot is putting in his chat output? I never realised the bots are that sophisticated, I always assumed they just take the money and fuck off.
---
Opened this when my boss walked past lmao I need to remember to not click on nsfw tags
---
Happens to me a lot
---
A lot of people paying for runners have also gotten a lot of their money from alting on different accounts at places like rune dragons for close to 1.5m / hour
---
Classic dev tactic, reskin existing models. Smh.
---
I give advice, that's what you do when you're a boss.
---
i like the baldness.
---
pretty sick art tho, thumbs up.
---
Str ammy has a +10 str bonus while glory has 6, glory is only better if the extra str wouldn't bring you to a new max hit
---
This guy is a shitter lol.  He's the type of guy that is the reason grinding should not be part of jagex's e-sport push.
---
Thanks, any idea how much gold I'd need to get from 77 to 94?
---
Just range the tasks. Skip metal drags. If u want money back, do wilderness slayer as everything drops 180k emblems.
---
It definitely looks like a slashing weapon to me, the hilt looks heavy, the blade looks wide. You definitely would not be thrusting with a weapon like this, for the most part you would want to swing this sword.
---
I feel like making that alt would take sooooooooooo long. But I've thought about it
---
Demonic gorillas on task would be fun
---
You send me a paycheck stub from one week and I'll send you one :-) sound good?
---
And btw if you wanna dick measure, lets see your portfolio? I spend more then a month then you save in a year.
---
KEEP THE CURVE!

"Instead of fixing the issues as a company and a whole, we'll just let you bitch at us one by one because that's better."

---
I basically alt them on my main when I'm playing my iron it's really afk and great extra cash
---
Scrolls of redirection maybe? I have no clue
---
What's the requirement like 80 or 90
---
Why do you think I came all this way?
---
Why is the freedom tower visibly shorter than the one on the right
---
“Much harder” even though mechanically it’s the exact same as normal Ironman LUL
---
Well, uhhhhhhh
---
it pauses the script so i can type
---
A but I ain worried bout achievement
---
On mobile at least, the sidebar has contact information for the sub mods.
---
Why so you can do a pathetic attempt at a Dox/Swat? LOL, boy you have to have something better to do then cruise everyones reddit and low grade troll. I get more sad the more I watch your profile to see what dumb shit you have/are commenting on.
---
thanks
---
Could be, yes

Not my proudest nut
---
Making average money doing something easy is often preferable to working really hard to max out your income in.
---
I envy you
---
I've had diarrhea for the past six years
---
For some reason it always follows when I consume milk; but fortunately my doctor confirmed I'm not lactose intolerant nor am I allergic to milk
---
But you left the spirit tree, you can get there with that
---
Sure but you’re not obligated to take an imbued ring at the same time. I’m rather indifferent either way I always end up needing NMZ points for one reason or another so I never buy herb boxes, but I can see an argument for why people would want to buy them.
---
Warding is the skill for making mage robes, so BiS magic stuff could be the end-goal of training warding. Ring imbues would also be pretty a worthwhile reward.
---
Used to get hired on forums to mine inventory then trade to people picking up. Made it so you never left and made cash. Used to be 70 to 90gp that way
---
And they leave you with 1 hp constant teleblock+snare
---
This is the reason why he's God Ash, humble, patient and forgiving.
---
That isn't true. The wiki's notes are confusing, it's only the Brimstone key that's unique to Konar tasks. Konar didn't even exist when Rune dragons were added.
---
Oh no! Sorry to hear that :(
---
It’s an external, real life, political issue. Not “Who’s going to be the king of Runescape?” Or “Jagex still doesn’t have authenticator delay.” Or “warding.” You see how those are relevant? 
---
Just because there’s gay characters in the game, doesn’t make that LGBT parade relevant.
---
No xp waste
---
Do certain weapons handle better with certain attacks?
---
For ex. Sword is better while slashing and Warhammer better with crush?
---
I think I'm not getting it back it was 12 years ago so i can't remember anything of it
---
and i lost the registered email
---
btw why does jagex have no phone number?
---
I personally like the curved blade more than straight one in a weapon designed for cutting. What comes to the hilt on the original design, bulky hilts/cross-guards doesn't fit for elves if asking from me. Their weapons are more nimble than heavy.
---
Besides there exists ton of a weapons without any cross-guard. Therefore along with my thoughts about elven weaponry, I'm not supporting with any cross-guard whatsoever to a weapon used by RuneScape elves.
---
I didn’t ask to be attacked like this.
---
Piety is incredibly powerful. You should train str higher before using a whip
---
I tried out rune and quickly switched to addy. You get 1 max hit going from addy to rune and imo it's not worth the cost.
---
Stick to addy, might lose you 5-10 seconds per kill but you'll be saving a lot of gp
---
Wich corner is bad?

Needs more muggers

Recharge your prayer and you got it bud!

I was wondering how to put together my inventory for my first attempts at a fire cape.
---
I'm only one level off from broad bolts, which I plan to use for the cave itself and diamond bolts (e) for Jad himself.
---
I just wasn't sure how many of which potions to bring considering my relatively low defense
---
15 brews 13 restores
---
This makes me feel so cozy
---
exactly
---
UM
---
I hope one of the rewards from the Gauntlet is the ability to cosmetically enhance the crystal armour outside of the minigame perhaps based on number of completions etc. They would make for awesome fashionscape with the Quest Cape (t)/Elysian/Vorkath pet.
---
Man you're real invested in this huh

Some black chins for the healers and maybe some purplesweets too

world hopping is laggy as hell also, sometimes disconect while hopping. Jaxed could you please adress the issue?

Hmm, weird. Guess I'll continue killing them, if the wiki is wrong.

Only one that might be better is elite and that definitely isn’t worth the time
---
Then lodge a toothpick under your big toenail and kick a wall
---
lets meet up bro, we can max cape emote together!!!
---
Dis.
---
Yeah most people don't do it, but all you really need is one crazy person to go do it for it to matter. Making the higher leveled items the only way to get the best stuff kind of forces people to disassemble the it too.
---
Dude this whole game is about getting dopamine hits from seeing numbers go up. If gay pride is supposedly about virtue signalling and getting dopamine hits, then whats wrong with having that in the game?
---
All these people telling their fav pet...i just want a pet

Agree, they look horrible.

I once knew a man who shipped something. The points the above comments made were as spot on as a spottier cape.

Is this done digitally or by hand? Either way very nice fanart

It looks cooler uncharged tho.
---
Yea - unfortunately, apart from nostalgia and replay value of the game, the content creators are pretty much shit. The game has gotten more expensive, but try to stick with bonds to get more bang for your buck. I don't condone RWT but you can get membership for like 5$ USD if you just purchase your gold/buy bonds. Making enough for bonds is easy after you finally get membership and better stats.
---
The username thing, ya. I know that they did release a couple of thousand in-game names a few years back, but they were taken by RWTers/Bots within a few minutes of release. I remember logging in right on time, wanted something like Tarzan as it was going to be released and within 1 minute, it was unavailable.
---
Quit your bitching, it’s a joke post. Relax
---
I thought so too. Maybe pure essence was that price back then, as it used to craft the more expensive runes?
---
shit i thought this was the beat saber subreddit and these were custom sabers i would have downloaded them

Back in 2015 there was a real problem with people DDoSing so others would die and they could loot their items. To combat this Jagex made a temporary change to death mechanics: you keep all untradeables and your grave (dropped items) sticks around for an hour, after that everything just de-spawns.
---
Four years later we're still using these temporary mechanics. So aside from select instanced areas, PvM has no real risk of losing items. PvP works much as it did back in the day (it's visible to your killer instantly and to everyone else after a minute), except the grave still lasts an hour and untradeables are converted to coins. The 'Items Kept on Death' screen doesn't mention any of this ergo it has been wrong for years (think of it as 'items kept on PvP death').
---
Jagex released a survey last year about changing the death mechanics, I've heard nothing about that since but I don't keep up with Q&amp;As etc. The death mechanics will never go back to how they were, most likely we'll end up with a game-wide death tax based on the value of the loot. At the moment there a few instances that tax you 100k for dying - Vorkath and the Theatre of Blood.
---
Something else that you're probably unaware of that may have been part of this change: if I drop something and you log in, it'll never appear for you. So don't try to drop trade on one client (or at all since multi-logging is fine nowadays).
---
This whole format is fabulous lmao
---
Sure kid
---
One of my accounts gets this all the time, and the other one never gets it.
---
Yeah they tried to with rs3 and look how it turned out. Kind of looks cartoonish and doesn't have a signature style. OSRS's style is quite unique and anyway allows the development team to focus on quality content and bug fixes as much as possible. The need for an expanded revenue stream (for bigger budgets + making investors happy) is what brought MTX to RS3.
---
The stream
---
I found that using DHCB with max range and ruby bolts for first few phases and then switching to BP with rune or dragon darts for last phase was actually better (and cheaper) than using BP for the entire time when the boss just came out. I would get much more consistently lower times with that setup. Now I just use lance though until I can afford tbow.
---
Gz. Still grinding mine
---
I'm sorry that you feel personally attacked online.
---
Yea, I've noticed this. I'm definitely going to take the bonds route. Thanks!!
---
I'm on your team brother. I say this as someone who's done many variations of NMZ over years of AFKing (for 200m melees) as well as maxing melee on at least 10 accounts.
---
My final NMZ favourite is Full Obby, BIS anything else, B-neck but swap DDefender for DFS. Just tanks me up a fair bit and shaves a tiny DPS off the total, which is fine because over the course of 60-99 it's only an extra few hours and over the course to 200m it's only a few extra days.
---
The point of over-killing and spawn mucking around that /u/kangamooster brought up is relatively valid. Though if a player selects bosses that aren't all the easiest of the easy, they shouldn't be faced with many issues (unless they get unlucky and 1-2hit each king or vampire spawn and the respawn is way out the edge of their map). 
---
I use King, Vampire, Tree spirit, Warlord and Treus Dayth. I self-host as I haven't done any other quests and those were the standard bosses to use back in the day - Treus Dayth's moving mechanic is annoying but whatever.
---
I personally don't think the marginal exp gain is worth it choosing hard over normal. The difference for me is that using hard means I die a lot more often and once you're over a certain hitpoints they just start shredding your absorptions, then the previous gains in exp are wasted restarting and logging back in. 
---
One of you mentioned that they might go AFK for 30-40 minutes, I agree. I need NMZ to be SUPER afk because I'll forget or people will be near my desk or I'll go out to lunch. 
---
The last thing I want to discuss is that we're potentially talking about AFK in a different bracket to these starters. I think OP of this post was base 75's and you'll often see 60/60/60 asking about NMZ too - the easy bosses would be great for them. 
---
Using normal rumble with medium difficulty bosses and Obby, I'm on 83k/hr and I have a Regen bracelet and no primordials!
---
Kiss your sister
---
Steve's better anyways. Nieve was a hoe. Talking to all those men.
---
Current design looks like a friggen machete. You cray cray
---
I'll defend him as well, every time I've tuned into his stream he's been nothing but awesome.  You and the other haters can go fuck yourselves, if you don't want to watch him just fuck right off
---
Yes thats completely fine, I do something similar with my 60% mech keyboard since it doesn have f keys.
---
The picture is from this subreddit dog
---
I'm disappointed that people had to ruin the old mechanics like that. Thanks for the in-depth explanation.
---
Thanks. I've seen some posts just saying to go with bonds. I figured as much.
---
Customizable Rumble Hard.
---
Not this ^
---
Every world you enter is a beta world lol
---
Would be nice if you had any sources to go along with those accusations instead of spreading shit with 0 sources.
---
How are you gonna assume that elves have a western tradition? Maybe they’re more similar to middle easterners.
---
a little sad he misclicked and didnt get a good chance to tank. but thats whats full screen resizable does for ya.
---
Blood runecrafting is the MLM of runecrafting and requires 77 RC.
---
The other benefit is for diaries, there's a huge jump in xp required after getting Fremmenik elite at 77+5, the next runecrafting diary is at 88, so even boosting from 83 requires nearly double the xp that fremmy elite required.  As a result it tends to get put on the back burner
---
One day. Osrs. VR. I believe.
---
!remindme 2 months "I told u so boi"
---
and because jagex is giving away trial memberships. normally u wouldnt see them in member worlds
---
You can have multiple, he was just unlucky
---
don't tag me, you eat out of trash cans
---
Idk why this made me think of Kirito's weapon.. petition to make next rapier resemble Asuna's
---
And reset your Runecraft xp back to 0
---
He's in his birthday suit
---
Yeah you're right, him saying "look at all those 0's" made me think otherwise.
---
4 doses to drink: do plants drink as much as humans? more?
---
That or within a hour or so of update release. Otherwise gg.
---
Naes?
---
I just did Mournings End p2 *with a guide* a couple of nights ago
---
I'm not strong enough for this
---
I am F2P :(
---
Oof, sorry
---
Thank you!
---
AFK teaks are 95k/hr? That doesn't sound right.
---
Be careful of the dark wizards as well. They are mean to new players
---
Glough was the hardest part, just remember for his final phase to pray mage and and spam click while in his melee area. Other than that bosses were easy with 89 range and 75 defense.
---
It just looks so... *basic*.
---
Nothing about this makes me think it's BIS slash one hander. It could easily be on the level of a brine sabre in terms of stats and it wouldn't look out of place with that tier gear.
---
Back in the day when we thought mining rune essence and picking flax were the real money makers
---
Surprised no one on twitter said this
---
Way to go, bro.
---
You had me at "I'm on your team brother."
---
Haha, but to be serious, this was really informative and I really appreciate your input!
---
Not sure what this post is about but if its taking a while, walk around with your kitten for 2.5 hours and feed/interact with it every 20 minutes and it will be an adult cat. Not sure if this will help or if you need help buuut ya! Gl
---
I think the blade is fine. I wouldn't be personally against any more intricate designs on the handle and other parts that aren't the blade
---
It's entirely based on clock speed since it's single-core rendering, so it doesn't surprise me that yours would be good.
---
Devs ask for feedback and then get mad at critiques tho.
---
He left jagex?
---
kids with 10m banks getting worked up about something they will never have the opportunity to do themselves smh
---
That's not an argument.
---
afk teaks is nowhere near 95k/h, unless you're measuring at 99wc, which is pointless here
---
and Sulliuscep is not afk
---
Back in the day when you got a level up the skill icon would flash and you'd be able to click on it to see what all was unlocked. This is basically the same thing but wouldn't trigger my OCD so I support.
---
&gt; allows people to virtue signal and get their rocks off by policing wrongthink. 
---
You know that isn't what OSRS is for.
---
I like jagex's more
---
Yes unless one of the deaths is an "npc death" in which case that player wouldn't lose anything and would be able to pick it all back up.
---
Got my prince around 250 kc
---
Afking teaks can get up to like 80k/hour. Redwoods aren’t best afk xp/hour either. They’re just more afk than teaks and make a little money too.
---
1/32k drop.. I pooed
---
What’s your WC lvl?
---
I dunno. I think the feeling of completing small goals every day is worth $11 USD. Much, much cheaper than the fast food I used to use to fill the void of life created by depression, abuse, and other fun things. There is nothing quite like RS to give you that. 
---
Also, RSN applies to RS3 as well I believe. A single account is tied to both.
---
Not confirmed to my knowledge but most likely it will require the quest.
---
I have actually and the ones I've seen look normal. I bet you haven't though.
---
I agree, seems like people want some out of this world shit, like i said, it is what it is, even if it was dog shit we would end up having to deal with it if we decided to play the game,
---
 idk why i got so many downvotes tho, but its cool, id rather speak what comes to my head freely, then to restrict my thoughts for an upvote from some sweaty runescape fuck.
---
These aren't bananas from Karamja... Smh.
---
Perhaps a little vendor gnome we carry in our inventory and can set up anywhere.
---
Great, now how am I gonna hack your account?
---
Mat is a gift we should all just appreciate and learn from given these situations.
---
Yep takes me a long time to log into initially to, just started happening today.
---
Any requirements?
---
I bet that bad boy can even run minecraft at a solid 25 fps
---
It has nothing to do with the price of the food, lol. It shortens your trip because you have less food, which results in less gp/hr overall. When you compare the gp/hr of modern bosses (2m+) to the food cost per hour (&lt;200k), food is essentially free. 
---
To each their own, but I learned to juggle and not lose ticks back in the day at Bandos, and now it's completely second nature. I can see
---
Or maybe just report rule breaking as you see it, to be a useful person and help the game that you spend so much time playing. 
---
Not directed at you OP, just people in general
---
The GPU plugin is great, but Fossil Island (in some areas) is an exception. If I'm not zoomed in, my fps drops to 10-15 and it affects all OTHER programs that use the same GPU. It's the only place where that happens.
---
Isn't that only low alch
---
Still just seems like a huge hassle to do it on the reg. I do it sometimes to extend a kraken task so I don't have to go back as much but otherwise I usually cba.
---
This
---
But it asked for an NPC in WEISS! 
---
Aka 72 mining 67 agility or something 
---
Two terrible terrible stats combined
---
&gt;agex saying you can't get banned for using OSB
---
is not approval.
---
&gt;The mods have been caught using RuneLite during the occasional QA streams as well
---
&gt;https://twitter.com/runeliteclient/status/997551276027195392?lang=en
---
is in the context of "jagex is no longer taking legal action to stop us from shutting down"
---
Elite diary makes it high alchs
---
This would be a great april fools from jagex
---
Yeah I always report but it just seems futile after a point , when you see the same exact accounts back the next day or next week :( I feel like a few others would agree. But lots of people just don’t you’re right too for sure
---
It’s profitable about 90gp per bracelet. More xp and better margin than high alching
---
these were designed by a woman tho so it's all good
---
Yeah, I can see that. For a boss like Kraken, each kill is about a minute and drops stay for 3 minutes. I just drop at the start of every kill and pick up at the end. As long as I'm not losing ticks, it doesn't bother me, and the time spent in between kills is dead time anyway.
---
well I agree with him and with you. this design is bad and machete like but OP's design ain't elf-ish.
---
He streams for fun but he left because he got another job offer, not to pursue streaming
---
Did you sign up for some recurrent monthly payment? Did you use something like Twitch prime free month?
---
Lol not even maxed.
---
jk gz
---
It would be an alternative to speccing the def down, but it would do no such thing to devalue it. The DWH would just be an alternative for using different weapons. DWH is mainly for Corp and raids anyways, it does not have its value because of Bandos
---
I'm a super casual player anyway. I don't even care about losing ticks or anything, Sometimes Ill just reddit in between kills since im instanced and know no one will show up lol.
