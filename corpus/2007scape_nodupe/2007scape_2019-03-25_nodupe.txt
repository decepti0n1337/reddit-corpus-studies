The discord invite is invalid for me :(

---
---
No, that's not correct. JMods can pm even if you put them on ignore. PMods cannot PM if you put them on ignore. Funny story, I actually ignored Mod Craddock on FunOrb once, and he sent a snarky response back lol.
---
The other person claimed they were ‚Äúunreliable‚Äù though, which is my point, so by your logic they‚Äôre incorrect too. 
---

---
Except, there is legitimate evidence that they ban tens of thousands of players per their claim. You can easily just add bots that you see in-game and you‚Äôll notice them eventually get banned. 
---
Karamja is so much easier than the other diaries though.  Like compare karamja medium to kandarin medium.
---
Just so you know, and I'm not sure if you were implying this, you can't lose your streak. You can cancel tasks and get tasks from other slayer masters and the streak will continue.
---
Why was everyone there? Did they just all happen to search for digsite amulet at the same time?
---
Never said I wasn't one
---
Bots will typically move around. So if some dude is just walking around while doing whatever and not responding to a jmod pm, he's most likely botting. 
---
Where do people go for middlemen to facilitate the swap, if at all? Also what‚Äôs the best way to make some money on DMM for someone who hasn‚Äôt tried it before? Lol
---
Dude this isn't anything new. For damn near everything that has both a free and a paid version, the paid provides perks. Its how it is and always will be idk why your so offended by this.

I wouldn't say lazy, I'd say cheap ass. I want to spend less on house teleports and redirect scrolls by using the spirit tree instead. This route would probably take longer to run than house tele.

This map is a very large part of the reason that I type 160wpm.

Because people over exaggerate. If you spent 2 hours to buy a set of rune it's cause you're a cheap fuck

---
Slayer for a long-term investment. You don't really start making money from Slayer until 70+.
---
Farming is good since you can do herb runs for safe profit. Most people will advise that you do ranarrs but avantoe is more consistent profit at lower farming levels since you usually end up breaking even or losing money on ranarrs below 75ish farming.
---
At 75 hunter you already have access to black chinchompas which are super good profit provided that you don't get PK'd. Red chinchompas are a safer alternative if you don't like going into the wildy
---
I personally would not recommend Barrows as a moneymaker until after you finish the mory hard diary
---
well rune lite could have a dps calculator in it fairly easily 
---
I love raids, probably my favorite content in the game. I enjoy duo/trio/4man etc. However I started learning solos recently and the feel is 100% different. They are mad fun. I'd suggest giving them a try. Suiciding to olm while learning is annoyingish but well worth it when you get it down.

Primordials and a torso or  Torags chest

That‚Äôs look really nice! Do you plan on expanding?

Ddosing with ice barrage is the new meta apparently
---
Its drops were either resource dumps or things that were used to skill and create alchables
---
Okay! Thanks for responding! 
---
I burned my foot!
---
Neither were most of us, a friend just tells a friend. Basically WooX from RS2 or some equivalent would come around with a meta and because things took way longer to disseminate people had to manually figure out the tricks or hear word of mouth.
---
However as someone who loves the age of information I prefer modern OSRS and it's discussions then people being cute noobs but there being a distinct lack of depth to meta conversations.
---
I've never had a problem finding a spot to mine iron in the members worlds. There are other good ways to train, and also way more places on the map with good configurations of iron.

Getting pushed out of certain spots by bots and or Venezuelan gold farmers does happen in members worlds, but at least in my experience only in a few places.

Add a red battleaxe to Draynor village where it gives you -15% strength when you use the special.
---
Downside is people might use it to low level one tick combo. Upside is you can now say "rawr :3".
---
if a giant rat were to fight a goblin... who would win? 
---
Male ducks are called drakes
---
That‚Äôs just my opinion tbh
---
If you‚Äôre killing them off-task, yes.
---
Canifis is useless after 60 agility. When you‚Äôre 20 levels over the course min you have 20% of the marks dropping.
---
Abyssals are unrealistic to burst because of the amount of people in the rooms so you can't always expect to do the task, it's especially problem because the task is so common
---
For cannoning, Black Demons are outclassed by Drake tasks that are shorter, Demonic Gorillas are ok if you need money but you could just raid, do Zulrah, or unblock Hellhounds for Cerberus in that case.
---
ikr LOL
---
Two sentences into the thread you linked and the values arent even close. At least put some effort in if you're going to waste our time and try to get the details semi similar sheesh

Jmod will never ask for password I believe

I thought this was dumb, but yeah, bank space. Any workaround to help relieve that is more than welcome.
---
We don‚Äôt deserve Mudkip. The guy is so pure and kind. Can tell how genuinely thankful he is to everyone and his speech about how much the game and the people mean to him had me in bits
---
Considering the slayer requirement I would say they are definitely lacking. When you get a task weighted 10 with that requirement you should be happy, not go ‚Äúugh I guess I‚Äôll do it‚Äù but that‚Äôs just my opinion, they aren‚Äôt that shit
---
I mean..... kind of a meh ending but aight
---
Does the Olm have to die to get any CoX points?
---
Cerberus is garbage gp
---
I've been following the mudkip fellow for quite some time and my lord is he a cute little twink! I really think he should do a porno with mod as and b0aty. 
---
Ah. Assumed so because karil top is one of the best items for ironmen but only 1.8m for mains. 
---
shut up you bwanner 
---
RNG being RNG. Got mine on the 2nd kill. 
---
I have a question. So, for example, when bursting/barraging smoke devils and you get more than one kill in the same spell cast, Runelite will track the drops of all monsters killed, but only register it as 1 kill.
---
Will This type of thing skew results for some monsters? Anywhere you get multiple kills in the same tick like Nechs, mm1/mm2 caves etc.
---
Not sure how to tag a user in a post but maybe a good question for The wiki admin in the above comments or the Runelite dev.
---
Are you actually stupid or what?
---
Yer fucked m8 gf
---
Thanks for the speedy reply! 
---
I'll sub and give it another shot, thanks, kinda confused why my post was deleted but I guess that's reddit haha.
---
Generally 60-70 combat stats, same as skills.

That would be Mac Miller. Can‚Äôt think of the exact song but it‚Äôs off his latest album ‚ÄúSwimming‚Äù. I would highly recommend checking him out. His music is great. RIP Mac.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a known bug, pretty annoying.
---
Yeah dude make sure you aren't trying to get the d defender in the same place you for your rune from, it's a different area in the guils
---
I have fuck all. I tend to save them for clues.
---
Would say a big reason would be now the Lance is out and bis for raids (besides Vasa) which is why it's dropping 
---
You can 1 egg her but communicating it to a team with randoms can be challenging l.
---
a more excruciating agility method than the bridge 
---
What reason is there to not highlight them. Sure, it's not hard to switch without highlights. But if I can make it even easier for myself, why not do it really...
---
He said his task is in brimhaven which makes me think he‚Äôs on a Konar task, if that‚Äôs right would the slayer helm still work with Kril as that seems over powered as you could use the boost at gwd for aslong as you want as the task is in Brimhaven so kills at gwd wouldn‚Äôt count? If that‚Äôs the case this is good news for me :D
---
I'm a simple man, I see Josh being trolled, I up vote

I mean, this doesn't necessarily sum up everyone. Can anyone truly say that they've always been a complete saint on the internet? I'm mainly talking about people who constantly act like an ass on the net. If you actively practice something enough, it's going to be embedded in your nature. This is literally just how humans work.
---
Seems that way unfortunately 
---
I don‚Äôt think I actually played rs before GE, or if I did I just don‚Äôt remember this cause I started so young. This is incredible to see.  
---
Indeed. It‚Äôs an inevitability of online gaming. I don‚Äôt mind some cheeky taunting, that‚Äôs how it is in real life too with sports and what have you. It‚Äôs just unfortunate seeing a part of the game experience soiled by a bunch of immature twats haha. 
---
I just came back from a fairly long OSRS break so I‚Äôd forgotten how toxic pking clans are. And here I thought MOBAs had the most toxicity in gaming lol

---
Question: Why did splitbark spike so much in the last few months? The boots have doubled. Worked for me because I had a bunch but still.
---
I just require maxing all roles in BA. Max is at least 1 full year or more away for me, and I'm at 2110 total, with about 20 levels or so across a handful of skills from being base 90. 
---
I don't want to max. I do skill casually when doing other things, but I try to set random goals in between skilling goals. Not sure what I'd do when I max, since I don't like pets. I'm hoping they come out with group ironman by the time I max so I can try that out, because ironman now is too time consuming for me. 
---
how do you do that
---
They don't tell you right away.  We usually can guess what the rarity will be, but it takes a few days before we have data to know.  Then 2 weeks later they give us the exact drop-rate.  Recently with high level pvmers pooling drop data the jmods are just confirming the exact numbers.
---
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è whats that
---
Hell yeah!

---
Yeah honestly I didn‚Äôt understand half of these ‚Äúburns‚Äù. A lot of em kept saying something about his hair and I‚Äôm just sitting here waiting for the punchline haha. 
---
Maybe if this was 2008 and Torvesta had a Bieber haircut I could understand. But as of now it just looks like incoherent nonsense lol. 
---
I remember the crazy forum threads too from peoples 'shops' where they'd have like 40k yew logs, 100k maples, 500k willows, etc. In hindsight, they were probably just botters or people buying from botters but holy shit those were were something to aspire to back then.
---
I mean, you'd still have to repeat the same function (checking the banned name in players' ignore list) for every account. May seem small, but every account has a max of 100/400 ignored players which all need to be cycled through, and considering I'm sure there are hundreds of bans per minute, you would be cycling pretty much 24/7.
---
dont practice in FFA, too much uncoordinated shit you won't learn anything and your chance of reward is based on your own points, you'll just keep dying and never get items. Start with small trio raids. WDR discord allows you to raid with a bare minimum 45m setup. Highly suggest you join it.
---

I'm pretty positive that's what they still tell people.

---
Hey op do you have farm pet yet
---
Thinking about doing more FFA ToB instead of just split runs... Are dragon darts / scythe worth it in FFA? Mostly going for pet, but if it'll improve my chances of getting a purple or pet then I guess it'd be worth it. Not sure how much MVP weighs in for in-name drop chances.

No you didn't you reposting sun of a beech. You knew what you did and liked it.

---
Pulp Fiction I do believe.
---
Because its bis at like 1 place in the entire game which vasa crystals. You can argue its BIS for slayer if u don't like the upkeep of using scythe but then again if you can afford a scythe you probably won't be doing slayer as your main source of money.
---
Gz 
---
You can knock out 66 agility in a relatively short amount of time at the seer's village course. You can boost from there to 71 with a summer pie if you don't want to do the entire grind.
---
If you get a couple more magic levels (alch something like gold bracelets/necklaces or yew longbows), you just click in the same spot for a while and should get 75k+ exp per hour. When you get to 75, you can use a trident of the seas at barrows and it should be a pretty big decrease in the amount of time it takes to do barrows.
---
As far as quests go, you might as well do some if you haven't finished RFD yet, and as far as I remember the quests in Morytania don't take that long, nor are they demanding.

Pretty sure ironman ehp is also based on dropping from gathering skills? The main difference is mains can just buy skills like prayer, crafting, herblore while an iron spends several houndred hours more just gathering these supplies. Most skills are the same except those you need supplies for, and is mostly just affected by those 3 skills, construction and smithing and cooking are also slighly slower but not much, fletching is close to the same if you go for the faster methods. 
---
Wc, mining, fishing you can get the same xp rates so the ehp is basicly the same
---
Heya, we know the data gets presented that way and so we parse the data taking this into account and so that usually shouldn't pose any significant difficulties
---
that really depends on your stats, gear and tasks you get, most slayer tasks are between 20-40k xp/hr unless your doing a burst task in the catacombs like dust devils or nechs.
---
you should be able to rip through that xp pretty quick if you get cannonable tasks 
---
Hey it‚Äôs the guy from the picture. What size hat do you wear?

I love him.

they seem to correspond pretty well though to what's above them, and most dungeons are all on the same underground map layer? keldagrim probably extends to under part of the wildy as well
---
CBA raiding with anyone that uses 50m gear
---
I think it‚Äôs interesting that the herbs have very different drop rates, always thought they had the same statistics. 
---
Overwhelming majority of people are negative towards these posts, which is understandable. But I never RWTed or broke any rules. 
---
Actually, no type of security measures work anymore, 2FA included. A few hours ago, a trivial solution to the index function was found for a number modulo p, where p is prime. This is important because modular exponential functions were used for encryption algorithms because they were thought to be one-way.
---
Ah yeah the rhythm is something I find pretty easy. I can't do it consistently with 3-ticking because it involves a set of actions as opposed to a single action. I do want to learn it eventually.
---
You make it sound so easy =p it's crazy what reflexes can do though, yeah. I often do rooftop agility while not even paying attention to the screen. It's just muscle memory after 50-60 laps.
---
You are correct. However, iron ehp takes into account the time to gather resources for skills like con and prayer. On a main not so. 
---
Vorkath and revanents drop them like crazy.
---
1/2k sounds right. Was too lazy to open the wiki.
---
Nothing wrong with playing inefficient, its a journey not a race. Also almost nobody is able to even reach 80% ehp overall over time, and as ironman you kinda have to go out of your way a lot to progress which hurts ehp. I prefer not to look at ehp unless im doing a method that is #1 xp and see how i do
---
i am level 65 agi with 4 missing pieces
---
Yeah exactly, that's a good example.

Will this mean some items will be removed from the drop table? I feel like some items can't drop from certain mobs, and the wiki says they can
---
You‚Äôre a literal brainlet

Actually a 2% drop rate with the bronze-rune defenders, Dragon Defender is 1% drop rate.

Okay? That seems pretty darn rare?

So is it something like you see that "1" dust devil dropped a battlestaff and dust runes and that gets translated into 2 dust devils since they have 1 drop each? Or maybe if "1" devil has multiple drops, just scrap it completely so only real single kills are counted?
---
You got me even more curious how this data collection works now haha, answer if you can spare the time but my original question has been satisfied. Thanks!

2 years ago a pmod joined my cc and asked me to add him to send pm.
---
The best tasks to block are non-cannonables/non-burstables with a high task weight. Look at your slayer master's task weights and block the most common one's that are poor xp.  Preference also plays into it if you're not about efficiency
---
construction for max house, slayer, farming, hunter
---
&gt;How much is too much?
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs just money apes, brother
---
You're under the average daily playtime across all players (about 4 hours), so I would worry about it too much.
---
You are killing it dude, keep the grind going.
---
Can use the binom.dist excel feature to quantify your dry streak depression
---
Correct
---
No doubt they both played
---
LOL
---
Warding won‚Äôt be polled until after song of the elves is released, and that‚Äôs probably scheduled for June, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect a poll until after summer at the earliest. We might see a test server for it before that though.
---
Responding on a dead thread days later to an unrelated matter. Oof someone's butthurt.
---
I don‚Äôt go that far haha. Standard pkers are fine. It‚Äôs just these edgy toxic maggots that are a problem. And unfortunately the loudest usually get the most attention, even if they‚Äôre not the biggest group.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna vote no on PvP polls just to spite these guys. Especial since that punishes regular pkers who just want to have some fun. Guys like Torvesta and T0ken deserve some more good PvP content to do. 
---
Amazing 
---
Don't you have to drop seeds though? Not dissing it otherwise i much prefer them but there's more seeds than inv space right?
---
Clearly outplayed.
---
Lol really? That's weird. I don't remember it. You should've seen the shitshow Varrock was in Classic Runescape back in the day.
---
For this recent project, the wiki is using a huge set of samples from Runelite. Jagex primarily doesn't give us the rates because calculating them is nontrivial. Take a look at how a drop table is written in the game code: [https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/771695256261853184](https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/771695256261853184)
---
Each time Ash answers a drop rate question he has to read through this and figure it out manually.
---
Only in this game do people figure out shit like this but refuse to bot
---
Yup. Halfway done with skills

I did the quest cape grind in about a week I went from around 100 QP to the cape and the only thing I remember pissing me off was the stupid island with monkey sentries in MM2 and that fucking ledge 
---
What'd you do? 
---
How about don't be retarded? I got scammed once in middle school and never again, I'm 26 now. How are there so many retards nowadays that can't be bothered to just check what they're trading?
---
Can I have my 4 seconds back?
---
But gambling is fun.. 
---
Yeah, back in the day having a pmod in your clan was a big deal because they could see anyone's world.
---
Friendly reminder WE VOTED FOR THIS SHIT.  Jagex polled an absolutely amazing trading booth system back in 2014 which got removed for this shit. 
---
I got a dragon sword drop on my 4th kill at Wyrms. That explains where all my RNG went while doing barrows...
---
Simply kill monsters while enabling the loot tracker, and checking "Submit loot tracker data" in the plugin's settings will allow your data to be submitted anonymously.
---
When I very first started in classic they sold upwards of 2k on world 1 f2p
---
The rat has rat meat which acts as a full heal. It doesn't even need to be cooked because the rat's stomach is conditioned for raw meat. If he gets hurt, he can just eat a toe and be full HP.  Rats have lots of toes.
---
Loving the series! Looking forward to the next episode
---
Lulz
---
Well fellas. They‚Äôve censored their hat and hp. How‚Äôd you reckon we go about this one?
---
U ok bud?

Rawr xD Im so random haha
---
Nice
---
A Nieve cape.
---
I started getting bored of my main and I made an alt with a specific goal for money making in mind and I‚Äôm 100% more committed to playing both accounts now. It‚Äôs really a lot of fun to be able to switch between accounts when one gets boring. 
---
Lol reminds me of the episode of Trailer Park Boys where Ricky gets them out of being arrested by talking his way out by saying something about Frank. The police officer was like ‚ÄúYeah Franks my dad‚Äù And then he just bullshit his way out of it lol. 
---
Download link ?
---
Swamp man good

the guy who provided the link is a different dude

all he was doing was providing the link, not taking a stance

the dude saying about it deleted his comment.

If you can do morytania hard diary, you can get a [flamtaer bag](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Flamtaer_bag), teleport to burgh the rott, buy 60 bricks, tele home and use them. Pretty cheap and best con exp for UIMs.

They hate pkers because they kill them
---
Is the overlap between OSRS hackers and people who buy email/password combos on the dark web really that big? Or am I just naive 
---
they warn you to not use 3rd party shit to play osrs. thats your own fault
---
you literally admit to playing the game on a  3rd party app, which is bannable even if its not giving you an advantage
---
see this is the bs with all these ppl that dont "trust" the system 9/10 they got banned for legit reasons and are just butt hurt. the system works, and are upset it works.
---
Ahh!!! The good old days... where if you didn‚Äôt have 1k or multiples there of, back to the grind you go! I remember spending a STUPID amount of time in Camelot spinning flax... I can still see it on my dreams
---
Can we join if we just wanna look at the progress 
---
Yeah, I'm currently barb fishing on the HC, don't think I could stay sane while doing it on 2 accounts. That's the perfect time to grind! No exp waste 
---
What a coincidence. Same here bud 
---
Anyone got a link to this image?
---
No thanks
---
Dude ur just an unpleasant person. I figured I'd point out how you're completely contradictory. And a liar at that.
---
he didnt just ban the dude due to not replying, how are there so many people hhere that think this??
---
he most likely teleported to him, tried to talk to him, then did something to mess up his bot. once his bots messed up, its pretty obvious if hes botting or not.
---
like come on, use common sense here guys... you dont just get bot checked in ur pms then get banned. -.-
---
@ran@ buying rune skirt
---
Were you getting ireate yet?
---
I'm gonna be honest with you bro, I took your tbow. Don't @ me.
---
This information is all unnecessary. I already know the chances of me getting any item is 1/2. Either I do get it or I don't. 
---
I want a rolling cannonball that just rolls behind you
---
Blizzard employees used to have something similar, (maybe they still do, idk), Sometime back in WoW's history, I think during BC, people found a way to force the symbol in front of your name in chat. That has always made me a *little* suspicious.
---
how much brain power does it take to kill a naked guy holding a spade and a clue scroll? 
---
just enough for a single left click I would guess
---
Oh sweet, I actually wanted the levels for barrows later on anyways!  That way I have a tele to barrows and easy restore without having to make tons of rings. 
---
Can someone explain how I can start fishing infernal eels without doing Heroes‚Äô Quest? I‚Äôm very low combat since I‚Äôve just been fishing and woodcutting. 
---
A pure is exactly what the wiki describes it as if you simply type "pure" into the search bar.
---
I can get 2-3 kills pretty consistently at vork, but I‚Äôm using sharks. should I use manta rays instead to get 3-4 kills a trip? They‚Äôre just quite a bit more expensive over time so not sure if it‚Äôs worth the investment when I get back so quickly (POH, pool, lunar isle, get kicked off)
---
Nice. What about an ags to the face
---
What there's a general store in the wildy?
---
TFW you already nutted but she keeps suckin
---
It's its own reward.
---
Most OSs have a setting to invert the function keys so they act as regular function keys and you hold down the Fn button for their secondary use
---
It‚Äôll be available once the world is complete. I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I can convert PS4 worlds to pc either so that might be an issue
---
Or just gamble outside of the actual game client 
---
2min kills
---
3 min bank
---
thats only like 500 mins if youre going ham
---
which is 8.3 hours...
---
okay he played a lot
---
im actually a dumbass its steels you do
---
here i am with 900 hydras and no claw
---
I think you're fudging the numbers there a bit champ. 
---
Or you did Karamja course for 6 levels and wondered why you weren't getting marks. 
---
‚ÄúPure‚Äù is generally 1 defence. You have obby pures, zerker pure, range tanks, range pures, etc.
---
Nice alts

I'll be ok if u gimme a bond

They do it to spite people lmao

When do Americans use base 12 other than converting inches to feet?

How did you do this ?

Im at 2400 no claw :(

oh god i hope that doesnt become me

If they had ended up removing random events completely, area-only Ironmen who rely on exp lamps and books to even be able to do certain skills at all would have been screwed.

Remove GE and make normal banks have GE options.

Does anyone have the recent APK for osrs mobile on android? Im on an S3 and unfortunately it wont let me upgrade to lollipop 5 (even though the systems supports it) and I dont have the tools to use a community rom.
---
Can he get the dscim in Mauritania?
---
Can we get ToB approx drop rate
---
I'm not offended. I think that dicing bots shouldn't be a problem after the game being around for this long, for anyone. 
---
Playstation still runs on Java Minecraft, PC and Xbox have moved on to bedrock edition so you've got a playstation exclusive here man

It's the brick age. Little brick, you see.

congratz, Im going for the same thing on my ironman. How did you avoid the burnout? I have 173 qp and quit for about 6 months just recently getting back into it.
---
rs3
---
Played Flower poker with a guy back in the day.
---
I never spoke to him except in game chat, but he was pretty chill and when we made bets we always paid each other. 
---
Eventually, he went on to become a host in one of those clan chats and he was never the same. 
---
I didn't wanna play with him because it felt like he went from being chill and just having fun to being purely about money. I swear tried to squeeze every single gp out of me at some points. 
---
One point he was being mad sketchy. He told me his clan was having a Christmas event and he wanted to borrow my santa hat. I said sure I will lend it to him using the lending feature that existed, but he told me that I should just straight up trade it to him and than he will trade it back when he is done with it. Yeah, I am not stupid fortunately. 
---
No you'll very quickly run into issues with captchas. Maybe try quick-fire checking a short list of names manually and I'm sure it'll come up.
---
I think the other people that do this sort of thing do it in-game on RS3? Or maybe via bot on OSRS, the name-change function is the same but it just means you don't have to go to the main site and I think it's perhaps a bit faster in-game?
---
Though above all it'll still be botting and unless you can check dozens of names each minute then you'll likely come into issues of some sort (or just not be fast enough to get one?)
---
Yours is much better than what he recommended. 
---
i'm a pmod and you've literally not been able to see people with pm on friends unless they have you added for at least the past 5 years
---
You're not doing that unless you also have access to the registered email. Which you don't if it has proper security on it.
---
is pretty good for using dhide melee and food. take 8 to 14 monks and you'll fill your inv with bones nicely before running out thanks to the bass drops 
---
I think people just want to be offended... like everyone knows pvp flame is normal in any game. Also those people in clan are probably the most social people on rs. They are always in voice and playing together. This is a mmo that was born from pvp. 
---
Recreate f2p, so get that bar north east. Then get everything south towards lumbridge. 
---
This is actually good idea and selfexplanatory. I my self found it weird when noticed those lines.
---
No he cannot.  Hence why the hammers or flail will be bis until he can kill abby demons. Then he can get a whip and hopefully blessed enough for the dagger.
---
So, I‚Äôm assuming in this sense that if you write one to do it in game where there aren‚Äôt captchas you will probably have a good chance of being banned.
---
Of course!
---
Lol because people flame you think you should remove the core part of the reason osrs was born. Have you ever crashed an ironman doing slayer??? Should we remove ironman mode because its toxic af?? No.
---
Can confirm made 40,000 light bulbs
---
Meanwhile i message jagex for weeks on twitter and they still havent reverted my pure. Can you please contact me? ‚ÄúDo you bleed‚Äù i 100% qualify and can proof anything and everything about it. Ive been 1 xp from max total since weeks just waiting to get this sorted. Going to sleep now but pm me tomorrow
---
Petition to remove the G.E.!!
---
&gt;Good opportunity for parents to teach their kids about security as well.
---
Yeah but since when do parents nowadays want to do proper parenting?
---
Popular torvesta meme is that he has birds nest hair.
---
I guess a lot of people are just coming to not trust anything Jag says or does. Which makes sense if you've been dealing with them for as long as some have.
---
Well most of the Dice bots are in members worlds, so they are actually contributing money to Jagex! The old flip-a-roo.
---
ha. thats edgy as hell. now im wondering if its posible to get a screencap where they say like, two contradicting racial slurs or some stupid shit
---
I'm not joking. I'm very very confused right now because the rest of my bank is still there. 
---
Obby maul is really strong especially with necklace. Rune knives-obby maul is great combo
---
Easy ass task
---
give temp bans to players who use them

Being told to kill myself os the core reason osrs was born? Got it

---
To take on of the gyms biggest challenges- the squatbar
---
It must be nice to have movie references going through your head rather than the immediate existential crisis and self-loathing slowly descending into suicidal thoughts.
---
&gt; There needs to be a way for people who lose access to their  authenticator to get back into their accounts. You can't just make it  permanently unremovable, or require access to the authenticator to  disable it. 
---
Yeah, the remove authenticator option via account settings.  Not to be confused with removing an authenticator via account recovery.
---
The bad situation you're thinking about is if someone coincidentally loses both their phone and login details at the same time.  REALLY unlikely.  They need to keep auth on an account that gets recovered (since you can still login to website and thus take steps to remove it).  If you lost both your auth device AND your account details, you're probably a hacker.  
---
Situation 1: I lose my phone.  I log into the runescape website, send a request to remove authenticator, go to my email, and it removes instantly (this is not where the "delay" people are asking for would come into play).  I start playing.
---
situation 2: I lose my login details.  I should then be able to recover my account (maybe even use the current auth code as one of the recovery details?? :O)  After i recover my account, the authenticator is still active (this is where currently the authenticator is instantly removed, and where the delay people want to take place happens). This isn't a problem because i simply lost my details somehow - i still have the same auth device to log in with after recovery is complete, so the 2fa isn't a problem.
---
situation 3:  A hacker recovers my account.  If 2fa stayed on the account (as i've said, it's currently removed instantly when an account is recovered), or at the very least yielded a delay and subsequent notification to the synchronized email, then they would not be able to get into my account.  They *would* be able to log into the website, and perhaps try to ruin my account from there, but i can only hope that any account changes like assigned email and such, would also require 2fa to be passed or wait for the removal.
---
situation 4:  I lose my auth device AND my login details AND access to the email.  First of all, this will never happen.  Let's suppose it does, though.  I take a long hiatus, get a new phone, and then forget my details and the strange email i used to create the account.  I then recover the account.  My recovery is successful!  I'm still going to have to wait X days before the auth is removed, but that's fine!  It's the least i can do after forgetting all that information.
---
I don't know what situation you have in your head, but the above 4 are the only 4 possibilities for genuine account security.  Nobody is gatekeeping anyone from their account.  The only waiting period of these 4 situations is the 4th one of high improbabilities where you are paying a small price of time to still gain access.  Every other situation has no bad implications attached to it.  
---
Well, when I log in on the Runescape Website, I don't see anything about there being an appeal. I don't know if they WILL show anything about an appeal or not. I don't want to click the link at all to see, so I'm hoping someone here might know for sure. 
---
I have Authenticator enabled on both my email and my account, so they will have a really hard time of getting that password changed, but its still something I feel I shouldn't take too lightly.
---
I remember when there were actual designated zones in the GE. All I can basically remember was top left near the shortcut were always god swords being sold or lent.
---
Can you post the full finished image my friend? 
---
Did you speak to Oziach? 
---
Lol dude, you had to expect this was going to be the response from folks.
---
I just got it...... its over. Oh my god fucking finally
---
There's at least 7 people in the screenshot, and it looks like closer to a dozen in the video (hard to tell for sure). Still a larger amount than 99.999999999% of PvM teams will ever be, let alone ones that will crash.
---
What probably happened is one PvMer was toxic when they crashed/were crashed and the guy I originally replied to is comparing the situations regardless of language used. 
---
They should make it so we can use seed pack on seed vault when it comes out.
---
You should be scouting

---
Congratulations dudey
---
As a complete rookie programmer I would assume that your first assumption is correct. It recognizes that a dust devil can never double drop, do it splits the drops and logs 2 kills.
---
bless up
---
Yeah saying something like that with zero source or elaboration. No wonder you‚Äôre downvoted
---
I love you
---
Why did you go out of your way to hide your other skills? 
---
That makes so much more sense but damn its a rare baseball game i guess
---
League, bronze 5.

---
C-Engineer is part of the holy trinity along with Settled and 25 buttholes.
---
Who is this guy?
---
I think it might help to add that this is my junk email. It WAS my Runescape email for some odd 15 or 16 years around, though I did change it a while back for added security due to the fact that the first email was now filled by junk for 1,000s of sites. 
---
I don't know if Jagex would for some reason send in emails to the first one, but I'd rather not take a chance.
---
I feel like an entry level stats course should be a requirement to complain about a drop rate. I can understand the frustration if you're 6 sigma in the upper limit. 
---
dunno, just felt everyone did that? my total level is below 750 for reference
---
I honestly doubt it, if mechanics like tick manipulating is allowed then i don't see why.
---
\*pls don't jinx\*
---
It's slowly coming out already. We are prioritizing popular monsters (mainly because they have the most data, but also because people want them the most).
---
They require an Oily fishing rod to catch.
---
- Buy a Sample bottle from Rasolo or the store in Canifis
---
- Buy or obtain Thin/Fat snail
---
- Use a Pestle and mortar on the Thin/fat snail
---
- Use the Blamish snail slime on a Harralander potion (unf)
---
- Use the Blamish oil on a Fishing rod
---
They also require you to wear Ice gloves. These are dropped by the Ice queen, who is found in the dungeon north of White Wolf Mountain. 50 Mining (or 48 with a mature Dwarven stout) and a Pickaxe is required to enter.
---
Just like the last beatdown?
---
It doesn't take as long as you would think to get back to where you were since you know better ways to do everything now
---
tl;dr?
---
I would say half of 2277 is mid level :)
---
If you forget your pass you're boned anyways. Just do a password reset to your email
---
^-^
---
Happened to my 2001 HP 
---
Everyone deserves a second chance good luck dude.
---
played league since season 2 anyone ive seen say shit like this ive reported and gotten feedback on the reports. its been non-existent for years now though.
---
That's going to make me feel heaps better about myself when I get those shit drops that are rarer than the good one I want.
---
In court, over a secret child
---
rawr ;3
---
*glomps*
---
A no hitter losing to a perfect game would be funny.
---
Just have to walk/hit 4 guys in the same inning.
---
Fandom, yes, but it only shows up on certain pages.
---
What's even worse is that these bots remain ingame for months and months. 
---
big ye
---
You just need to clear the junk out
---
Agreed. If Jagex ever decided to ban it, I think I would quit. I can't go back to the vanilla client.
---
If I ever got banned for botting I'd take the chance to just leave the game and move on with life tbh. 
---
Man the goal isnt to die, then the series ends. The goal is to make an unpredictable series where at any moment a pker could come and fuck him up, just a normal hcim with a little spice added to it
---
One has three heads, the other has three legs
---
Doesn't help that loot is pretty much non existent when your in the pure bracket. It's just a money dump for people with mains. 
---
A guy from my school did this last year:(
---
Situation 4 is highly probable, actually. Runescape is an old game, lots of people have old accounts they want to recover
---
Thank fuck someone actually understands this as opposed to taking it seriously. Rarely do you go positive when group pking, it‚Äôs just for shits and giggles (almost like it‚Äôs a game). Although I understand having toxicity spewed is pretty aggravating, I can‚Äôt imagine how these people deal with real life encounters if they‚Äôre hardly able to suffer mere shit talk online.
---
A lot of the people "using" them are alt accounts pretending to win big to give credibility to the bot.
---
Clean your first/home tab and move the second tab (all the holiday items) to the last tab or remove it completely, it looks cool but they are worthless in OSRS and are probably never gonna be taken out.
---
I play DotA 2 all the time and the shit I see on OSRS is genuinely worse than it. With DotA, reporting people actually works, and will get them muted. DotA also has behaviour score, which is something OSRS doesn't. 
---
Yeah he is comparing them in terms of the underlying mindset that allows people to join these groups, but he obviously isn't saying pking someone in osrs is as bad as beheading someone.
---
But that is pretty self explanatory if you read the post and aren't retarded.
---
They do take a long time, but I think I was averaging about 4k per wyrm. Guaranteed 1k with their bones and frequent stackable and alchable drops
---
Well my Strength and Attack is barely Lvl 10 so I probably need to just train
---
he's using the only weakness of pkers, their low iq
---
Falo only gives clues where you need to give him an item, and he gives you a new clue if its the correct one. This must be Sherlock. 
---
emblems are great if you're a low level in edge.  
---
too bad the ping is shit for 2 weeks a month.
---
Or just never give the gamers rewards because they don't want to see them? 
---
If your account is built purely to be a tank (ie no other non-combat skills or non-affecting combat skills), it's a tank pure. If the stats are built to be a zerker, it's a zerker pure. The words your using (tank, zerk) are just shortened versions of it. There are multiple different types of pures, mainly built for higher DPS at lower levels, but there isn't one "true" pure, that's just your opinion.   
---
This is from the old wiki, the new wiki has multiple different pages on pures if you want to take a look.  
---
&gt;  
---
A **Combat pure** is a character whose [combat](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Combat) stats are specifically trained in order to optimise performance in [player-versus-player](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Player-versus-player) scenarios ([Wilderness](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Wilderness), [Duel Arena](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_Arena), etc.), often prioritising offensive stats whilst maintaining a low [combat level](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_level). For instance, someone with 70 [Attack](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Attack) and 70 [Strength](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and only 1 [Defence](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Defence) would be considered a pure (more specifically, a [Whip](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Whip) pure). Though the concept of a pure most commonly refers to an account with high offence and low Defence, there are other types of pures, including "[Berserker](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Berserker)" pures, "[Barrows](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Barrows)" pures, and even [Defence pures](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Defence_pure). Still, considering the diversity of PvP-oriented accounts, there are almost countless variations‚Äîsome accounts are primed to work specifically with particular [weapons](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons).

Mate I get wyrms all the fucking time?! Blocked drakes after 4 kills (and got the claw on 2nd lol), they are just pure pain and anger.. Drop table sucks for the amount of effort.
---
There's an NPC at the Grand Exchange who has a right click "Decant" option that does this.
---
I got the same setup, however my laptop still works and I use a huge 4K TV. I sit on a little lounge chair with the laptop on my lap and I either watch YouTube on it while I AFK grind on the TV or I have a quest guide up on the laptop while I quest on the other screen.
---
One click needs to equal one action. You‚Äôre clicking once with an endless amount of actions proceeding. This is technically a bannable offense :o
---
2.1% of Nigerians have internet access, so I highly doubt the people that do would be using it to play OSRS. Plus, you do realise you can appeal a mute, right? 
---
This is a really good idea!

Not if you have elvarg in the right spot. A lot of the spikes and whatnot don't work but there are a couple corners that do.
---
Yes, this is very low.  Try going back after getting better armor and 20 atk/str

Telling someone to kill themselves surely is fun and just banter.
---
Just trying to help. 
---
Wow, it's 74, dumbass.
---
Yup
---
&gt;This was a daily thing for me when I played cod from ages 14-18 getting called a spick all the time.
---
That doesn't mean it's okay, but no, it's not something I've experienced. Being called trash, retarded, whatever, sure. Racial slurs? No, because most games either autoblock them or actually deal with reports relating to them. 
---
&gt; because they know it‚Äôs the internet and they‚Äôll get away with it.
---
Yeah, and this part is bullshit. There's no reason to let them get away with it.
---
Practice in unrestricted world (if possible, haven't tried). Could help you get olm down easier with max stats and gear.
---
Then why would they act that way? Why would a "caring and considerate" person shittalk and try to put someone else down when OSRS pking? I don't buy it.
---
Use a scimitar if your not already using one
---
Let alone dude is over 15 so should have money to pay for membership if he really wants it. If he is in University he should be about 21 **assuming** he originally played at 6.

Yup u hit the lotto

Pkers talking shit when they kill you, sun is shining, water is wet.
---
Use the report button and suck it up. Nothing else is gonna change.
---
People like you, who freely admit (or at least imply) that they spite vote are the reason I kill every PvMer any chance I get
---
why are there Leafs fans on MY runescape subreddit
---
Oh thanks mate, I was just gonna hop on runescape and gamble my GPs, but thanks to you I will be upvoting this post for the GREATER GOOD of Runescape. Thanks again, pal.
---
Translation: I want free shit with little to no effort/risk
---
gzz man!! im about 350 dry of a claw :(

I don't have premium and it works. The only time youtube won't mini-vid the shit is for really popular music, in my experience. So like put on some Drake and it won't allow the mini-vid, but say Bassnectar or OSRS videos I have no issues getting it to work.

No extensive testing but just some stuff I've noticed anecdotally.

What‚Äôs it called?
---
It's very easy to talk about things in black and white, but ok, since you clearly have a plan in mind you can implement, break it down for us, because literally every other platform practicing censorship fails at it.
---
Let's start with point 1: what constitutes toxicity?
---
Report all the alts and anyone who trades them
---
cringe
---
Im not really a pure kind of guy. But I think youre talking about a main? If youre including all skills then thats most likely a main, especially all 99's
---
If you meet graardor, he‚Äôs an Ourg, not a goblin

Banter and racism do not go hand in hand.

Roughly the spawn time of an XP random?
---
Looks like an average day at barb fishing, wintertodt or any slayer location while you're hopping for a world
---
Staying true to the osrs nostalgia, the unregistered hypercam
---
You‚Äôre belittling racist talk as if it‚Äôs typical trash talk. They aren‚Äôt the same thing, or maybe in your eyes racism is fine. A good example is just recently a white man in Utah was banned from NBA games for bigotry. Heckling/trash talk is allowed, but racism or homophobia hate talk is sad. Quit justifying it cause it‚Äôs only online 
---
I only have like 100 hours on Dota 2, but I‚Äôve never been flamed even a single time and I suck at the game
---
The thing is that agility is one of the most heavily botted skills and also holds the highest ban rate, majority of botters use the same free scripts, which are probably very easily detected by Jagex, because the "behavior" of the script is known to them.  
---
Bans are usually also delayed, so that the coders wont know what made the anti-bot system pick up the script (unless you just received a manual ban, which is unlikely in your case).  
---
Could be possible that your account got already flagged while you were botting agility, and then a full ban while you were botting cooking (also a free script, I suppose?), because that gave your account a second red-flag and was confirmed as a bot.
---
Ok mate thanks for your help 
---
The amount of false self esteem this game can give people is actually quite scary. 
---
Toxicity is pretty easy to define in this context since everyone knows what swear words are. Besides that the words which are being used are so far into the "that's offensive" territory that it ain't hard to punish those people. (It's already against the rules anyway).
---
Also Jagex has 100% authority to decide what they deem toxic and don't want into this game. You should ask Jagex what they think is toxic since that's the only opinion which matters. 
---
Chip was from a tree turning feral

What damage at olm is unavoidable? I‚Äôm working on CoX solos, but I still need to suicide an inventory of brews into the arena and I usually use at least 20 in the fight. Not sure what I can improve on and what is just undodgable.

*feedback*
---
Not going to lie 99 HP is one of my top capes I want. I love when I can find uses for the regen bracelet and the fact it stacks with the prayer cape just tickles all the right parts, ya know.
---
My main is a trade account so things like thieving aren't very high and I like to pray rapid heal with +32 prayer gear while thieving ardy knights solo, gives me 45 minutes of prayer time and I usually can do 2-3 hours of this with a inventory of 12 dodgy necklaces and 10 saradomin brews.
---
If I had the 99 hp cape imagine the effectiveness increase, it'd be I daresay *massive*.
---
Haha but I'm almost there about 3.4m xp left to go.

Would honestly like to see accounts that say this at least once after first punishment to be perm banned. No place in this game they need to step up and tackle this issue because it‚Äôs so so ugly to new and existing players

You look like a bot with bond money armour
---
I'm not saying that at all - I am saying the way people act while PKing doesn't indicate what kind of person they are in real life. Feel free to actually read what I said. And no, I'm not belittling racism - the comment I am responding to made the distinction between it by saying "*There's also a difference between some harmless trash talk back and forth like you're talking about versus actually going out of your way to be as toxic as possible towards other people*".
---
there
---
Yes they do, because they were the very ones who created the concept of a pure. A pure exists within pure clans and pure communities that define the terms they created. 
---
Again you can use pure as an adjective as much as you want, but there will remain a set criteria for what a ‚ÄúPure‚Äù really is. 
---
Anything you describe as a pure thats not what the community has defined as a pure would be more accurately described by a different single word or word modifying pure, which makes calling it simply a pure misleading, inaccurate, and entirely silly. You would call those accounts tanks, zerks, def pures, mains, meds, piety pure, or what have you, but not as simply a ‚Äúpure‚Äù (one word) . 
---
If you call an account the single word ‚Äúpure‚Äù it must adhere to a certain set of restrictions and attributes set forth by the community that created this account build- never to exceed 39 def and usually has 80 atk or lower. Anything else would be described by a different singular word lest there is a failure to communicate. 
---
Op asked what a ‚Äúpure‚Äù is, not what a ‚Äúcombat pure‚Äù or ‚Äúdefense pure‚Äù is.
---
Lol he was talking about doing it in the cc. Also your camera is very nice 
---
That‚Äôs how Mafia works
---
I'm gonna fuck your dad weeb

They crashed heavily because of the Divine poll (which failed) and now they are on the climb back up to where they were, and are likely gaining a bit because the likelihood of any future polls including a Divine is now basically zero.

I think you had to log in daily for a week or something during this current event. In case you dont get it from a single log in.

PvP Communities' guidelines on recruitment do not affect, or dictate, what a "pure" is. There are **multiple different types of pures**, as described above in my OP or on the official (and unofficial) wikipedia. There **are not** any official or unofficial community guidelines that specify what a "pure" is. Some "pure" communities have guidelines on their recruitment, due to the vast amount of different types of "pures". Most "pures" follow a specific build guideline to maximize DPS at a certain combat level, which also backs up the fact that there are **multiple different types of pures**. Your opinion of what a pure is, while not incorrect, is not correct either.
---
Op asked what a ‚Äúpure‚Äù is. Not a tank, not a zerk, not a ‚Äúcombat pure‚Äù.  Just a pure. 
---
Therefore, my definition is more accurate, and yours is very misleading.
---
No, it isn‚Äôt just semantics and because you have said it twice in response to two different responses I am gonna assume you have no clue what semantics actually means.
---
Ignore report them and move on. This happens on every pvp game. Spite voting because people say mean words on the internet is stupid. 
---
Wyrms can be blocked without being a "bad" block. [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Duradel](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Duradel) look at the wiki of Duradel and order by task weight, you'll see that an optimal blocklist (for xp) would be:
---
Abyssal Demons, Hellhounds, Cave Kraken, Greater Demons and then two tasks from the tasks that are weighted 8.
---
Since both Wyrms and Drakes are weighted 8, they are worth blocking if you are going for xp. I am not sure if it's the same if you go for gp with slayer though.
---
Yeah but for todt it‚Äôs reasonable to just turn public off. There you go.
---
Also not relevant to this discussion really
---
What kind of dumb donkey would continue botting on a glitched account? 
---
A "pure" is an account "purely" based around a specific attack style, combat level, stat level combination, gear build, etc, to maximize DPS at lower combat levels more efficiently than a main, generally for PvP.
---
give us the agility course that gives us 40k exp/hr just so its atleast something we can do while waiting for a team
---
Lol. He had 2fa on, and the site doesn‚Äôt need 2fa to log in to sooo... changing his name was the only thing I could do :D
---
Jagex is pretty unclear on alot of things, but this is on you tbh. If you gave up after a single attempt of using the clue on the shop owner, you can‚Äôt blame Jagex for not being clear.  
---
In the time I got quest cape, I ran into some instances where I thought things were bugged, turns out they weren‚Äôt. If you really want to find glitches or bugs, you have to try very hard to do so. 
---
Op asked what a ‚Äúpure is‚Äù, not about different kinda of pures, tanks, or zerks. 
---
You‚Äôre providing irrelevant information while I‚Äôm giving the most accurate and realistic definition of what the single word ‚Äúpure‚Äù is in runescape, and where it came from. 
---
No shit, I'm saying your analogy is trash lmao. You dense?
---
Still easier to use a phone hahahaha
---
Pvp games always have people shit talking, it‚Äôs not up to the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù to clean anything up. It‚Äôs up to jagex and their incompetence at dealing with in game toxicity. Just do as most pvpers do, ignore/report move on. Simple. 
---
what kind of horrible tragedy did this to such a beautiful girl with pretty little bows in her hair

Make bosses that reguire pvp kind of playing, switching gear, prayer, freezing etc. Then pvmers are ready to fight back when pker comes.

There are multiple reasons  to why items fluctuate in price. Depending on demand, how many are in game and how useful they are will depend on the price with of course, other factors too. Estimating future prices correctly is very difficult without a lot of knowledge on the game. I believe ely will stay between 450-650m until a new shield of the same or better quality. The scythe is bis for a lot of bosses and so until other items are buffed or there is a huge injection of scythes in the game, it'll stay that price or rise slowly for some time :)
---
Note this is not factual and is purely subjective. 
---
sorry my englsih bad sorry no understand you

yeah go on. Try this banter in real life basketball pick up game. See where it goes.

the authenticator doesn't do shit if you account gets hacked. Last weekend my account got cleaned while I had an authenticator, bank pin and a new password which i never used before. Truth is that if they manage to login using the account password reset feature and bruteforce the random generated code (which they quite frankly do), they can bypass the authenticator and just register a new authenticator to the account (which is a huge breach of security btw). Furthermore, the bankpin can be easily bruteforces (since its only 4 digits).
---
Truth be told, Jagex security is below standard and (more importantly) Jagex has a HUGE security issue which they really need to deal with.

I love anitpking while chin hunting, and revs was a great way to introduce tanking and small man teaming to non-pkers like myself. Voting no to wilderness content because u don‚Äôt enjoy the wilderness isn‚Äôt a genuine way to vote imo. The wilderness is a unique and great place to introduce risk-based content into an almost completely afk/blowpipe scape game. It‚Äôs sad that people don‚Äôt enjoy the wildy just because they feel ‚Äúforced‚Äù to go there when they can easily just not participate and continue their efficient afkscape elsewhere. 
---
not with that attitude

well im stuck at galvek and i die the whole time to those 1 hits and the 3td phase i use full blessed with dragon cb  with 84 ranged so thats the issue 3td form and luck

They are not a necesary evil, a gold sinks are a necesary evil.
---
Pvp died in rs3 for a different reason, eoc gave players the chance to fight back on an even field with defensive abilities and ofc the average brainlet did not even try to adapt because pking actually took skill.
---
In osrs we have pvm content being shoehorned  into a pvp zone for no good reason, its just predatory content so pker wannabes have something to kill. The whole "muh risk vs reward" argument used to defend the predatory content isnt even good. You can go to the profit snek and risk absolutely nothing for even more gp/h.

NO, NO I AM NOT, you clearly don't understand this thing called human interaction and how you are allowed to communicate with someone you have a lot of human interaction with and how you are allowed to communicate with someone you have a little human interaction with. It is NOT semantics which means you have confirmed that you have no clue what semantics means.

You don't think spite voters just love it when pkers make posts about them and when every comment section of a post that has ANYTHING to do with wildy hates on spite voters? It feels like they're actually achieving their goal: Pissing off the PvP community.
---
I'm not saying spite voting is justified nor am I encouraging it. But I'm also not going to write it off as "They're just stupid." There is a real psychological aspect to it, wheather you like it or not.

If they logged in using the password reset feature, your email was compromised. They didn't "brute force" 2FA because for the most part that is impossible due to rotating codes and rate limiting on Jagex's part. So if your email was compromised, the 2FA was disabled that way and it really isn't Jagex's fault (despite maybe adding a delay to remove 2FA).
---
As for the pin, there are prolly a hand full of pins most commonly used, id guess 2010-1990 for birthdays, rotating 1000 and up and the same number four times in a row. 
---
Truth is, brute forcing isn't just a magical way to compromise account security and is, in fact, the absolute worst way an attacker can go about gaining access to an account. Bottom line is, set up 2FA and secure your email and that makes your account pretty much impossible to compromise outside of human error (or some sort of reused password plain text data breach that you can't/don't react to)

You're right, I returned after a few year hiatus in September of last year, and learned Raids 1 at the beginning of this year. It was difficult at first, and I was excited at the opportunity to learn from someone with more knowledge than I. I have, however, played this game just as long as you. The worst part is, after all of this, you still think you're right. That's fine, your idiotic comments have been downvoted to hell by the community (no matter how hard you've tried to downvote everyone disagreeing with you), and I've edited my upvoted top comment to make sure nobody that stumbles upon this thread reads your bullshit and takes it seriously. Now I'm going to ignore your account, while it settles in slowly that you've lost this argument, publicly.

and why else would they cater their update to either ironmen or slayer for years lmfao
---
What should I use for other atk styles?
---
Yes and no. More people making them might make the supply slightly higher, but they will still be held mostly by the cost of rune bars which would be unaffected. Plus, even if prices were to fall, its a tier 40 ammo. They should be like half their cost. Everyone gets a rune scim at 40 attack yet the majority uses addy bolts all the way to 99 range because their cost does not align with their tiny increase in dps. 
---
Which like, you haven't used all those resources and you can collect them from any bank or chest, just leave the buy order in and go do your thing

Do your friends poop so much?

They all say the same things over and over, it should be ridiculously easy to detect and ban them nearly instantly
---
I always thought that there should be like next to no multi pk areas and some activity similar in essence to BH (longer you stick around with high value items the better) focused more around going to certain hotspots on the map that changes location.
---
Like say there are magic shards or some shit that instantly drop from your inventory if you die, world hop, or log out. You get like 2-3 per hotspot (after you stick around for a little) and once you hit 10 they morph into something you can carry out and trade. Perhaps fragments to a worthwhile boss (located in or out of wildy- as long as the fragments can be seen as valuable)
---
Perhaps introduce a low risk ("free") "wild only" armor option (maybe through SC re-introduction) that gives your average PvMer unfamiliar with pvp something to throw at it and try out. The moment they actually get away with a kill or two on scrubs also using the armor, they feel compelled to ugprade to "real" much better gear.

It's not a phase, mom

90 herb helps, but you don't need it. You can scout for rooms that drop overloads. Other than that as high cb stats as you can get. And 115+ cb for points I believe

You're right. I'm terrible at explaining and also on mobile. I do however believe in using the search engines we have at our finger tips to seek the answers. We should all learn the ability to find out information on our own and then ask questions after that, right? Wiki has a much better, far more succinct explanation than I could ever try to give, anyway. I'm a bumbling fool.

100% agree gambling bots are bad for the game, but it's not an easy fix. If bots were easy to detect that would already be removed from the game. With botters getting more and more sophisticated and the threat of false positives jagex won't have an easy time of this

Lol. See this is the problem right here. You pvmers think this is some kinda attack on your very soul when in reality it‚Äôs just a game. There is no who threw the first punch. They are pvping in a pvp zone, what they are saying is irrelevant with all the content filters we have. If you don‚Äôt like people talking to you in the wilderness then why not set your pchat to off? Do you really sit there and wait to have pleasant conversation in the wild? Or do you wait to get hate baited by a clan and then white knight on Reddit about it? 
---
It‚Äôs just a game bro. If it upsets you take steps to prevent it. Spite voting or ‚Äúpunching‚Äù back is not one of those steps, but if it makes you feel better about yourself and what the mean pkers said hop to it.

Mining, rc, fishing and agility are the 4 you need to tackle before maxing is easy. So far I've done fishing and rc. I did fishing first for that sweet 74 agility. Now I'm working on mining. I've been addicted to volcanic mine lately, so maybe it won't be as bad as I expected. 88 mining so far. Agility this summer. 2110 total so far.

The barrows wiki explains it properly.
---
The summary is:
---
Barrows items are only affected by killing the 6 brothers.
---
The % affects all of the other loot (runes/bolt racks etc)
---
For maximum gp/chest you want to get it to about 87% - this gives you the maximum runes without polluting your loot with lots of low value bolt racks.
---
The fact this even has 5 upvotes is telling as to why pvp is in the state that it is.

Seriously man. You should be glad you're able to even play at all. I wouldnt blame you for not wanting to restart. But you shouldnt of botted anyway since you risk getting hacked OR banned

GS‚Äôs are incredibly slow weapons. You will always get significantly better dps from whip+defender. And SS for strength simply due to speed out damaging power 10 times/10. It would be nice if this wasnt the case but its or reality. Abby dagger and bludgeon will out dps SS for strength but only slightly and imo not worth their price tags, especially if its at the expense of BIS ring/ammy. 
---
But at the end of the day, it is a game and you should do whatever is fun for you and makes you happy. I think this community gets a little too hung up on efficiency scape sometimes and its led us to grinding the game rather than taking the time to enjoy it. 
---
Hope that helps you out

yea SGS is only good for the spec, for training your better off with a whip/dagger.

 We Do Raids: All raids with exceptions of raids found in the #lfr-ffa-and-iron channel within the We Do Raids discord are by default split if the split would be more than 1 million gold pieces per person. This raid was scouted in the #lfr-standard channel so it would have been, by default, a split raid. Technically no, but due to the medium of which the raid was done, splitting is assumed.

I personally got to over 100 within the first 2 hours, that's how I released a Telos guide almost right after release for 0-99, only died once figuring out font mechanics on p4, then climbed to probably 200 without another death. You may be remembering incorrectly, but it's also variable now. With guides, I've known friends to go to Warden with prior PvM skill with very few deaths.

Back in the day we had SwiftKit/SwiftSwitch. Everyone was using those. RuneLite is just the evolution of that same technology, fastforwarding 10 or so years.

Why retaliate? Let the noobs kill you and have fun pking some bones and food.

How often do you play? Because it‚Äôll only take max 6 hours to earn 3m for a bond when you‚Äôre a low level member so if 6 hours is nothing to you over the course of 2 weeks you can earn a bond in 6 hours to pay for you next 2 weeks of member ship and just cycle it. I only suggest this because members is so much better than f2p it‚Äôs like a new game entirely 
---
86% left of the 200m reward
---
Coin pouches have to be one of the most useless updates in the game 
---
Bones and food? you know he's in revs right? most people have ~200k on them at least. The real mistake is not spotting the obvious skull trick gear they're wearing and the fact that they're trying so hard to make it look like they're a slow/bad player.

I was nervous as fuck for robert the strong and vorkath for some reason, but once I got to galvek I was totally cool and calm. mostly because you don‚Äôt have to do any bullshit once you‚Äôre there. it‚Äôs a quick fight and if you die, you‚Äôll be right back within minutes to try again. Just use runelite and scroll out fully. It makes seeing the bombs easy. And for phase 3 (the hardest), just get on the right line of tiles and run towards them. Phase 4, just shoot and move. bring 2 stamina pots just in case, the rest brews and super restores.

The formulas that govern hit chance are kinda funky, and I don't think it's ever been published _exactly_ how they work. However, some people have come up with very good approximations based on a lot of collected data.
---
Ignoring stuff like set effects, the overall effectiveness of attack &amp; defense are calculated as (8 + level) * (64 + bonus); and then your hit chance depends on the proportion of those values. This makes it rather tough to get an intuition for how important weaknesses are, as it depends a lot on both parties levels and bonuses.
---
You can use this calculator to work out your accuracy in specific circumstances:

---
No.
---
Pretty much any task that you don't want to pray against but do have to eat a lot to complete the task.
---
You could use tank armour to fight hellhounds for example instead of praying.
---
Above all, it is best to save up for guthans and just use that to heal, that way you hardly ever need to eat or pray.
---
That's a maple tree I think.
---
The point of warding from what I've seen isn't actually the armour. The armour will be quite useless. The point seems to be adding dissassembling to the game, something that rs3 added with invention. It's a great mechanic for the economy, but I really don't see the point of adding it attached to a otherwise useless skill. 
---
IMO, if you're investing time into playing the game, it is absolutely pointless playing F2P. The obvious exception is if you're making a novelty account which is F2P only. 
---
Gain more money, gain more XP, and basically unlock 90% of the game. I don't see how you can play P2P content and then go back to F2P. Just food for thought. 
---
So?

---
The only time I've ever seen Monni is in the Runescape Highlights vids and he is always dying while PKing and yelling about it. This photo makes sense.
---
Okay so I'm gonna explain this so you can try it yourself. Open up setting, change it so you can hide and show inv/gear/prayer/spells/etc. Now go into fkeys settings and rebind inv to esc (you don't really have to do this, you can use the fkey that it is default bound to). Now try holding that key. Jagex has purposefully put this mechanic into the game, if you're rebinding any keys outside of the game client, you're doing something wrong. 
---
Side note: It is okay to rebind 1:1 with 3rd party programs, as long as you're not moving the mouse with keys (this is okay with your OS build-in mousekeys).
---
That's real FUCKIN' NEATO.
---
RS3 has a similar problem. There was a post a few days ago where someone killed another player and then reported them for getting angry.
---
He later admitted in the comments that anyone who doesn't want to die is entitled and "minding your own business" doesn't belong in the wildy. And he doesn't like PvP near the wall since it's "ego-fueling content" and he prefers going after skillers and other people who can't fight back (he didn't say the second part but you know that's the truth).
---
He also said that the insults don't hurt him but he reports them anyway. And this: "Griefing to you is simply pking to me,".
---

I think the correct answered is it is sold on the GE, but the price started at like 1m when it came out, and the price in the GE cab only go up or down by a certain percentage every day. Basically look at the official GE tracker there are close to a hundred trades every day, it‚Äôs just limited by the GE on how much the price rises everyday.

I don't know about using a page to create the super prayer potion, but the idea of one is great. I think it would make a better market for the prayer potion, giving players the option to save some gp or pray longer at slayer tasks to reduce banking.
---
Holy shit
---
"youtube" alone would interfere with actual conversation
---
So essentially you want the game economy to be even more flooded, because this would make botting even more profitable.

---
What? 
---
Id laugh even if it wasn't a bot. I'd probably laugh if I watched it happen to me
---
Shitty PKers. I want Jagex to feed me people who don't want to actually PVP. No one cares if you enjoy PVP. But pushing content into the wildy is going to piss off more people than it appeases. 
---
You could just hold esc down manually. Theres no way jamflex to know if its manual or a coin
---
&gt;I did this once before with only 256m and made like 15m/hour until i lost 8 times in a row lol
---
That's the reason martingale doesn't actually work. You're just lumping your entire risk into the 1% chance you don't lose.
---
Since this method only "works" if you keep on going and going, you will eventually hit that 1% and you will lose.
---
The only way to win at gambling is leaving when you're ahead. Anything else is a trick.

If they don't Jagex will get flamed for releasing OP/dead content in most cases

I got a 2 day ban for botting. I botted 73 √°gil 70 fishing 85 range at ogre cages. It‚Äôs been 2 years since I‚Äôve botted and my account is over 2k total. It‚Äôs not that uncommon for people to bot when they first start playing again. But the 2 day ban scared me enough. I think a perm ban for botting just encourages more botting in a way
---
it‚Äôs 10 now sit kid 
---
Freddo!!!!
---
Back in the golden age of YouTube.  We need Franku back.  Nice runescape themed filthy frank cover.  Take my Karma.
---
True man, and I do regret the botting. But damn some skills are just tedious to the point of annoying. But I did all enjoy a lot of the questing, slayering and some minigames. 
---
I never made the alt with the intention of botting on it to make money. I made an alt and looted at greater nechs lol. and then splashed magic until like 40 and killed lava dragons. Which was fun but died way too many times from pkers. 
---
I was just about to start barrows and had almost 70 slayer. I almost had the taste of true money making lol
---
Anyways I'm not salty about it. I deserved what I got. but damn if I got another chance I would be so damn happy haha. Just praying.

Haha good eye! I literally just got the top on my last task. Will assemble next time I‚Äôm on :)

Cheers for the irrelevant reply
---
Based aetas
---
Thats not accurate though. And no one said anything about the purpose being to make profits better. Thats just a byproduct. The balancing to because it makes no sense to require 99 smithing to make a crap rune plate. This made sense when rune was first released, has getting it was like buying a new cadillac. But its since depreciated to that of a 20 year old civic.  Like you said in your last comment: an items value is determined first by supply/demand and then by alch price. Only when supply significantly outweighs demand, does an items alch price matter. In the case of rune items (ammo exempt), there is almost no demand. People getting rune drops from slayer alch them during their task because it sells for the same price (actually slightly less) on the GE. So no, a rune plate can be smithed at lvl 1 smithing and it will still hold its alch price. 
---
Now, if your argument was that more rune plates would be entering the game, thus more would be getting alched, thus more gp entering the game, thus gp value depreciating, then yes I would agree with you. However, this would be slim. There is more gp entering the game from ardy knights on a daily basis than ever would be from a smithing rework. Also, I dont think anyone is saying to make rune smithable at level 40 like rs3 did. I think it can be more difficult than that. 40 could be enough for a rune dagger but rune plates could be in around 70-80 and still be locked from most players. I can tell you that 99% of people with 99 smithing have not smithed a rune platebody unless its for a diary. Why would they? Theres literally no reason to. So its completely dead content.

Yeah good idea. Then when you get hacked you get your bank wiped and character reset lmao

If rune darts lost 50% of their value that would make the blowpipe even more OP. The one reason people use to claim it‚Äôs not broken as fuck is that it‚Äôs got a high cost, which is right, because every shot with rune darts is like 300 GP. If rune darts dropped to 600 that means its cost would be like 175 per shot and it would just make high end PVM way more profitable.

You're drawing a parallell to people joining "extremist" groups or terror groups. You're assuming that the clans has an ideology, or a purpose in addition to being pkers loyal to each other. You're also assuming that people join the clans to fit in with a group of the same ideology. People join clans to make the game social, have people to do activities with. Clans shittalk because of the competetive elements of clans.

Wildy areas being unlimited multi combat is the real problem. If you got attack by a single pvper or maybe even two you have a chance to do something about it but when you get attacked by 5+ people its bullshit. Jagex has a system to partner up for slayer, why not partner up for pvp so two people can attack same target and remove the multi combat otherwise so at most you can get attacked by two people at once. #ProblemSolved.
---
Cor blimey mate!

And what do people who don't have max gear do? Just not raid? lmfao

Eh to be fair it‚Äôs his own fault for trying to fight back the odds of fighting off a pker in pvm gear is already low should just have the attack option on hidden and try to run or die. I usually 3 item when I do wildly slayer and just let auto retaliate do it‚Äôs thing make them waste some food and respawn.

Jagex report system doesn't seem to be very reliable as a whole in my experience.  They should really increase the number of player mods in certain areas, but I don't think that answers the question of people being rude assholes for fun in the wilderness.  
---
If people can't be mature enough to not be toxic perhaps we should remove pvp and the wilderness.

The new runelite chat filter plug-in works amazing for filtering out the bots. The plug-in info on rl's website has a default regex query which has worked perfectly for me so far.

u can raid just u'll risk getting scammed
---
Thought you were speaking French there for a moment. 
---
Comparing Xeric's to a god damn pet is a bit far fetched though.
---
Imagine not getting accepted into raids beacuse You killed 10k Graardor and did not get the specific pet so You could bring two more Items. Having a Pet does not mean You are a master of said boss, you could get Lucky on kc 7 or kc 7 000.
---
All your suggestion would make is so everyone is forced to grind out hundreds upon hundreds of hours to get a boss pet, which again makes the pet super common and at that point the pet loses its original value, serving as bragging right. And after a while we'd complain that two items is not enough and then boom,  we are polling Pak Yaks. 
---
Now,  if the only change is cosmetics, like color scheme or whatever, or stacking of hats then I'm all for it, as Long as it does not make pets have any use what so ever.

I just finished the quest today as a level 94 with 79 range and 70 defense and 71 prayer. I used a whip on Robert the Strong with average melee gear and it only took me two tries because I went in with the wrong gear the first time. Vorkath only took me one try with a blowpipe and addy darts with god d‚Äôhide. Galvek took me 5 tries, but two of them I lost on the final phase because I got hit by the rock move and he fire bombed me. I used rune crossbow with ruby bolts the whole time for him. If you‚Äôre willing to put in the tries you‚Äôll get it.

Light bulbs is pretty good gp/exp even for normies. It's not insane xp/h, but 120-150k is still faster than most skills. Definitely viable if you're on a budget

Have the Jmods announced what tier of clues the mole slippers are going to come from?
---
I'm not as worried about it being bypassed. There's honestly only so much you can do for a kid. If/when they decide they want to try out the adult world there's not much to do about stopping them other than hoping you prepared them the best you could as a parent. I wouldn't fault jagex (or whoever owns the game now) for my kid getting around it. However if it's tied to their birthday and the parent sets up the account there settings could be locked based on age, they may be hesitant to create another account (resetting their stats etc).

Nmz with blowpipe is decent and cost effective. I‚Äôve gotten 700 ranars from daily herb boxes and I‚Äôve gone through maybe 500 with slayer. Still have 6m points and important imbues done.

yeah :D

Thats why u do scaled large raids to hit the avg gp/hr faster. You get approx 1 tbow split every 350 raids if u do 4+1s

Jagex could also start muting people again. I'm pretty astonished that in 2019 people like this exists in OSRS. Don't most of us have careers? Or possibly families, I'm sure these same idiots would be furious if someone was flaming their 13 year on and online game. The worlds already overpopulated, we could do without the shit heads.

PvM is just as toxic as Pking. Most of the toxicity comes from single/ multi clans just spamming dumb shit.

At the end of the day they‚Äôre words on RS, get some thicker skin, stop SJWing everything.

If youre low on cash sure, but on normie you kinda wanna do the fastest methods, best methods are 2-3 times faster. Normies get cash for that through slayer and hunter (assuming they are going for max here)

Sure but being skull tricked should be out of the question anyway assuming you're not new. I was just pointing out that rarely will you kill a rev killer and get nothing, people like to downplay how much they lose whenever they die so they feel better about themselves, it's always worth killing rev killers.

You can only query a leaked database if it's already built as such. Most runescape-related leaks I've come across are in non-standard formats and sometimes are scattered across many files, many of which contain duplicate, redundant or incorrect data. What exactly is *your* background in cyber security? 
---
You're correct, you don't need 100% of the information. You need to build a case that the account belongs to you. Jagex don't weight recovery answers as highly as you might expect, nor are they as discoverable as you may suggest.
---
I guarantee that if 30 minutes of googling is all that's required to discover a player's recovery answers from their runescape username, they have bigger issues with their footprint than their GP being stolen haha
---
I'm not saying it's not possible, it definitely is. But it relies entirely on the target to have open profiles with a single concurrent username across many platforms and services, which are all available for you to acquire very specific information from. 
---
So, you lead me to what you've already discussed - persistent and targeted attacks. The target must reveal sensitive data about themselves to other people in order to become exploited.
---
The target must join specific channels or register with unofficial OSRS forums using their sensitive data in order for it to be compromised by an attacker.
---
I only mentioned random hacks, because that *is* an extremely resilient narrative on this subreddit and it felt fitting to close on.
---
I am really not sure what your gripe is with me?
---
I refuse to accept that if you get hacked, you were flawless (with exception to Jagex staff abuse, or Jagex server leaks).
---
That isn't a personal attack, you don't need to behave so defensive against me. It's a fact. It's not even a small margin of accountability, it's usually an ongoing trend of mistakes which ultimately lead to the event occurring. 
---
This is true. Bones, normal logs, and wheat are all great early game tricks if you know how to get to varrock!
---
I recommend new players do wheat first though, as running with logs is too heavy. Once at the GE, sell the wheat and buy an iron axe and cut/sell the trees near the GE for even more money.

It is farfetched, you're right but both are untradeables and my point was excluding drop rate they're comparable types of items. I do see owning a pet as mastery as much as getting a 99. You can buy 99 cooking or fish it, both give the same result but are you a master of buying a skill? 7kc does not make you a master and nor does 7k, but having 7k kills generally means you are a master of that boss to achieve such a feat. From everyone's feedback I agree maybe perks are a bad idea, cosmetics would be awesome but a teleport to said boss if you get 2 pets would be a good potential too. Ps sorry for walls, mobile don't let me use paragraphs
---
Did I say any of that?
---
And crossdressing
---
You literally get your levels slower, this isn't debatable since you only get 1/3 of the XP for each level, so you hit any specific level later, meaning you delay the benefits for that level until later and end up taking longer to level overall.
---
Defense XP is less valuable than the other melees because you can Defensive Chin/Burst for them, and you defensive burst Slayer tasks for an even spread of XP across your skills.

---
Defense xp is not less valuable. And training on shared with a whip is actually better than training each stat individually if ur going for all 99s. The reason for this is because the strength training weapons have worse stats than a whip. Unless u want to buy a rapier then whip on shared xp is a very good option.

1/3000 with 3000 KC is about a 63.4% chance I believe.

You don't have any idea of efficient training, defense XP is certainly less valuable than the other melees because of chinning and bursting 
---
Whip is not better damage than all strength training weapons, Obsidian + Berserker is more DPS (XP/hr) than whip and is considered the best way to train Strength before Dharoks.

Group/Tribeman mode has been mentioned but its really low on the priority list.

You can buy sapphires and emeralds in Mor-Ui-Rek (iirc about the name) and cut them. It's pretty cheap and fast exp.

NZM with blowpipe is about same cost in gp/xp as chinning and about 6-7x slower. Ye 100% not worth.

$11

I‚Äôm most excited for this to show drop rates for formulaic items like brimstone keys!

Plus the Filthy Frank voice was ruining his vocal chords, and he said making the videos just weren't fun for him anymore. I get it, it had to have been a lot of pressure.
---
You can't do that til 61 woodcutting
---
is it though? Rune knifes would still cost like 250k/h
---
Feeling like leaving WT on my HCIM and start playing with it. Currently nothing interesting to do on my main.
---
Damn dude, that's a lot of herbs.

He right clicked and saw both of them lol

Getting my first account banned and raising the phone bill was mine. I think I went through about 5 accounts before I finally stayed on one account to call my main lol.

Right click the public chat stone beneath the chat box. 
---
About 8-9m/hr for efficient solos or raids with DPS alts, so about 2x the GP/hr of Vorkath at max efficiency
---
If you're new, you'll probably doing maybe 4-5m/hr, so about the same or a bit more than Vorkath.
---
i did unpowered orbs until 85, then did gold bars -&gt; gold ammies/bstaves from dailies/slayer till 87. Now im stacking seaweed for higher lvls :)

What the fuck is this reasoning, Ironman would still be a grind and a fucking chore to play with or without a friend. All it means is that you might grind less.

There‚Äôs an NFL reporter out there who‚Äôs last name is Barrows.  I tried to bring OSRS up everytime his name shows up in /r/nfl

F... Next time pal

Lul, just messin' with ya. At least it's not an untrimmed *cooking* cape! ;)

The client isnt 100% accurate since it cant check to see the actual state of the tree, it only uses the theoretical time it would take for your patch to fully grow. 
---
Same, iPhone 8 and it started doing it instantly in last RS update
---
If you let the actions of a few dictate your opinion toward the rest of said community. Says more about you, then them.
---
This with gem bag, if you don't mind a bit more loss take the rubies too. The process of buying and cutting can be 80k +/hr crafting and you end up with loads of cut gems banked 
---
I'm gonna get downvoted for this but:  I have no interest in the concept of relevant non-pvp activities being in a zone where people can just show up and mug you, where the mechanics of the game make it impossible for you to properly counterplay it.  I'm never gonna spite kill pvp polls in general, but any poll which adds more wilderness content for pvm I will downdoot with maximum prejudice.

If you're gonna have a piracy mechanic, make it so the galleon can reasonably fight back.

Right on, we need more people like you. 
---
Skull = you lose all items on death instead of protecting 3.
---
If you kept his protect prayer on he would have protected 1 item.
---
You skull by attacking a player who has not hit you.
---
They began the fight by having one person attack the streamer.
---
The person had a friend sign into the same spot that he was standing and the streamer went to attack the person who hit him- but hit the other player- causing him to skull.  He got 'skull tricked'
---
He did right click and see that there were 2 players right there. Sucks to be skull tricked regardless of how obvious it is.
---
Cheap idk. Fast for sure. But I dont like spending a lot of gp/xp. I need the money for trident casts and herblore kingdom.
---
The silver method actually makes you money over time. 
---
Glad you mentioned this. It's amazing that people still don't realize DDOSing is very illegal. It's always satisfying when a script kiddie gets rekt by the feds. Don't understand the reprecussions? Don't do it. DDOSing is up to 20 years in prison incase anyone didn't know. 
---
Its more then 10exp per fruit, know your facts.
---
250k/hr is still &lt;2gp/XP, so it's still very cheap and noticeably better XP/hr than MSB (I) + Rune Arrows
---
Stay 10 hp for Wintertodt. Do solos so you get a shitton of construction exp. :)
---
I think that when we have an activity not tied to any skill, such as collecting sand from a sand pit, and a resource from a skill that has no practical use, such as granite and sandstone, it makes sense to try and match the two together.
---
They've been doing this kind of thing with secondary herblore ingredients for a while, makes sense they do it with sand too.
---

I dont go in the wildy for that reason, to expect pvmers to not get rubbed the wrong way by being used to make pvpers have content to not be annoyed by it is a little idiotic 
---
Those who do revs etc are mostly Venezuelans- normal players generally find it too packed and too annoying to deal with.
---
Regardless the content should aim for pvpers to attack pvpers not pvmers.
---
how about a glory when slaying rune craft runners lol.

Yup and we've had about 10 posts since then.

I'll tell you the same thing that I and others have said the past week;
---
* Jagex is aware. 
---
* Not every mobile phone is having an issue. 
---
* Anecdote: My Samsung Galaxy 8 i is working as usual. 
---
* Due to the discrepancy and it being an issue with potentially IOS or specific phones no ETA known. 
---
* Jagex has no timeline on a fix. 
---
* Assumption: in about 30 days or 3-4 update cycles.
---
You don't really know your audience, huh?

I thought I already had it but then, in my moment of joy, clicked to attack and it dragged me out. I 100% blame myself.
---
Tomorrow the cape will be mine!
---
Anywhere other than multi you can easily fight back you're just terrified to try. 
---
It really isn't. mine got hacked and im not retarded.
---
(also i am retarded because i had my 20m cash stack on me...)  \*\* PS they dropped my defender :)
---
Do non combat stuff first. I personally did wintertodt till like 90 and then said fuck it and did combat. I'd say getting 85fm and full graceful is a good start. Don't worry about grinding for until you have both. When you get tired of one jump to the other and when you can't take it anymore just start doing combat related stuff and quests.

its 100% worth if u are not comfortable flicking the 50 and 60s waves. some might judge you for doing it this method cus its "too easy".. other than that, go for it.

1)it‚Äôs really easy to escape barrows using ladder...this isn‚Äôt dmm

2 from his 200+ barrows chest i don‚Äôt think i saw 1 serious attempt to kill him

3) nobody in their right mind would camp barrows pvp world without knowing when he‚Äôs connected + when he actualy does barrow that‚Äôs just stupid

I had a lot of trouble reaching zuk consistently without justiciar. With justiciar in my last 3 runs I reached zuk twice and died once very stupidly cause I mistimed the mager twice (justiciar wouldn't have helped there).
---
Justiciar really helps in the 5 or so waves where it's a clusterfuck and you will have to tank multiple monsters (usually when a mager + ranger + blob or more is present). Unless you prayer flick very well it's amazing to just put it on, pray mage, and run to the other pillar/safespot.
---
I would definitely recommend using justiciar but will give a warning that you won't learn advanced prayer flick mechanics. 
---
Damn this subreddit gobbles up reposts

Why are ankou a task extension over much better and more practical tasks? Can we make dags a task extension instead? We could call it "daggy please" if you need ideas on a name for it.

Usually you see a them on your way to east green dragons from Corp cave and say why not maybe they‚Äôll have something.
---
Source on this? This is fascinating
---
Moving the player to bot Island would be a pretty big tell. No way to not notice that and if they keep moving around or prayer flicking then the jig is up 
---
You do realize the idiot who posted that got smacked down again in the 2nd thread where he asked for an apology? He was never the account creator.

I mean technically isn't the distinction here that one sits at the GE and only over trades GP to the main while the other account is used to hide the best items in a safe zone until the very last second?
---
Kind of like how Torvesta always has a cannonball alt or something with no issue. They don't care if you pay them extra membership to try and get an extra item or two for the last day. They do care if you save a full set of insane gear and transfer it right before the fog rolls in.

Lol, I literally got mine an invent after this. Unlucky. Maybe they inadvertantly buffed it in the update that allowed you to clean more finds at once?

Horrible? That was a great quest

You are walking, not running, right?

Idk where your getting any of your information from, but the only reason scripts get banned is either the nature of the script and the resulting data that gets sent back looks similar to other profiles they already have, or your script makes mistakes caught by their system automatically.

---
Clearly you guys are doing something to look shady. If jagex doesn‚Äôt have time to ban actual rwters why would they ban you over 20m. 
---
No, Thieving is mostly that, all you can do is get items that will let you grind less or do less repetitive methods that require more attention and are slightly less mind-numbing.
---
My recommendation would be to not play this game at all honestly. All skills are like that
---
I think it's better than drawing Death run 5 times in a row.
---
I use a IPhone XSMAX and still have issues. 
---
Would be better if it was Agility and RC
---
yepp learned that within first 3 kills lol. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better at it, still just need some work. I basically get 2-3 kills based on RNG from that blue fireball thing. Ill try manta rays tonight and see if I can slip in a 4th kill every once in awhile

I don‚Äôt think a Vene account is a high priority target for people who social engineer their way into an account. They are looking for 1b+ banks i.e. someone posting a tbow/scythe drop.

That's because Ubi is dealing with it in an incredibly stupid way.

You can still teamfire all you want, even with the new update, most real toxic people don't even use text chat they just micspam...

Throwing is the biggest issue, even in gold games I get throwers 24/7 and it really only stops in plat. Ubi has done NOTHING to adress this issue
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to agree with him on this one. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if it works then great by all means but in terms of mice the price itself can be the difference on the lifespan.

How did you come up with 'Staff of the void' and not Staff of Balance bro
---
This has nothing to do with the recent sever rollback. This was a separate update recently that changed each weapon to remember what attack style it was on previously(to benefit mainly pures and pkers). When pures logged on alot of weapons defaulted to attack or defence exp and without warning lots of pures accidentally "ruined"(hard quotation there) their accounts. Jagex accepted the fualt and promised to restore xp to what it was previously to effected accounts.

&gt;the PVM opinion on this is p set, no one in PVM tries to bring counter-pk gear
---
Yup, just refer to like 80% of the playerbase as a singular entity with no variation in thoughts. Very accurate.
---
You're like 90 combat, constantly making threads to ask advice about the most basic game content, so I'm not sure why you're so confident in your knowledge.
---
That's how a troglodyte eats a banana
---
That's not true you only really need a tbow for zuk. Blowpipe with ddarts is mad dps.
---
I had one and only really used it for jads and zuk.
---
On mobile I don't think so. The only way I know to reorder interactive options is through the menu option reorder plugin with Runelite. Since mobile is a vanilla Jagex client it doesn't have that option.

I would go for Blowpipe kills over DCB. While you may be getting better GP efficiency from your supplies, your overall GP/H will be lower depending on the difference in your kill times. With decent BGS specs I think Blowpipe would probably be considerably faster kills.

You only get DDoS‚Äôd if your IP was seen by somebody, which means you were on a forum or website where your IP was grabbed.

If you're skulling with a blowpipe without protection anyways you're kind of making a mistake imo. Not using Salve (ei) seems like a huge disadvantage to me and if you skull you can either keep the Salve or the Blowpipe.

She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Mueller to impeach Brampf. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was full of evidence from raiding Paul Manaforts house 37 times???? This is so fucked.

This doesnt really make them any easier...
---
Insulated boots reduce the damage to 1 anyway..
---
It stops the rare 2 hit and start 3ish hit.

And you get a tiny def bonus.
---
Good idea my man, this is why I don't agree with the idea that you should "always start as a HCIM because you've got nothing to lose". Being a HCIM changes your playstyle, even if you don't realize it, and losing status late into the account can be demotivating.

&gt; iOS Mobile Update rolling out today, to fix the remembered logins problems that have been occurring over the last week, expect to see the new version from apple sometime over the next 3 days.
---
&gt;Voting no to wilderness content because u don‚Äôt enjoy the wilderness isn‚Äôt a genuine way to vote imo
---
It absolutely is. Everyone votes because they want to drive the game toward their ideal version of osrs. My ideal version just so happens to have the wilderness removed entirely and pvp restricted to bh and pvp worlds 
---
I have started streaming recently, and my friend and I learned Bandos for the first time a few days ago. Since then when I am streaming we have had a few people who were watching the stream meetup with us, and we actually got a BCP which was an awesome split!
---
We plan on taking on basically all the bosses you can do as a team in RS, and want to have people who have the levels but perhaps not the experience or friends join us so the whole community can experience parts of the game they otherwise may not be able to. Feel free to shoot me a DM if you/anyone else is interested, we can get you added in our discord with other people in the same position and build a little community for ourselves. Goodluck my dude!
---
Yeah my friend with a total level of over 2k lost his Tbow like this.  The guy was his "friend" for over 5 weeks before they attempted the lure.  It happened in the Al Kharid bank on a PvP world, but same exact setup.  He thought for sure he was safe because he understands the game and knew he was on the game tile inside the bank.  Sucks.  Really fucked up too because it's so intense and manipulative.
---
Use your blow pipe, but don't use void. Using a BP with dhide, neit, and bgloves you'll trade dps positions with elite void, often swapping out every level and even changing spots based on prayer.
---
The ranged defense increase is worth it, makes surviving for 2-3 kills much easier.
---
Using a bgs is also a good idea
---
Am I missing some context here? Why are you trying to sound like you have 200IQ in an OSRS subreddit, doesn't that make you a Serene alt?
---
Solidly cementing /r/2007scape as my favourite subreddit is this magnificent weapon of a comment 
---
What sucks is some nerds can be such elitists. "Oh we didn't finish maiden in 2.5 minutes? We're 100% planking Verzik I'mma leave"
---
As a side note, its worth bringing a bgs if you can afford it and be sure to pray mage when using a bp

Thanks man, I try to only put the spiciest things on Reddit. I feel like its less of an oldschool reddit, and more of a meme reddit

I personally really enjoy black jacking

It counts down from 100%. I think it's just a weird way of numbering the videos.

Lol.  Tree runs are incredibly simple to do, and powerlevels your farming.  Just buy Willow saplings, baskets of apples, then do a tree run once a day.  
---
or just keep playing the game for another couple days and buy a lance instead of panic selling your gear lol. never understood that. when i buy gear, i generally dont sell it. its nice building a big collection of bis items. also he did just get a twisted bow, so he probably can afford that lance now anyway lol.
---
That's about the same percent of the active population as all ironmen combined. 
---
wtf are you saying?
---
Can't afford a bgs, sadly, otherwise I would
---
Me doing me
---
Its amazing the things people can figure out in this game, i can't say that enough.
---
However if this becomes popular it'll kill the prices of seeds, if it gets to that point jagex should look into patching this and the similar thing you can do at ardy knights.
---
How am I the retarded one for saying having your rsn broadcasted on reddit is probably worse than people seeing your rsn in game? I'm not even being a dick about it lol just saying it's lame, might as well cover up the other dudes name

Do birdhouse runs. Seriously theyre amazing. I'm 67 Hunter from basically nothing but Birdhouse runs.
---
Make sure to get the free 9 lvls from Varrock museum 
---
Yes I totally agree.
---
You're just wrong. Anyone with 75 defence and reasonable combat stats will out dps any pures. Pures are made for ko potential, not dps, and once again you show your lack of knowledge by talking about 99 attack pures as if it's even somewhat viable.
---
Besides, the original point was to just fight back, we're not talking about an even fight or deathmatch. You can literally stand there with an msb and auto retaliate while you're frozen and dps pures enough to make them eat/stop smiting. That alone provides more benefit than simply running away would do.
---
And that post was 1 month according to what it says for me. If you want I can use your most recent post as an example instead, where you ask for clarification on how chambers of xerics are a high level activity when you can fish food at lvl 10?
---
I just don't get why you're so cocky. You clearly don't pk - your only experience of what you're talking about is being the victim.

get good at real pvp so you don't have to PK people who have 0 inclination to fight you. Sorry that real PK kick your ass that you only feel big beating up on nubs with shovels.
---
someone give this guy his acct back!
---
The money from the inevitably alched longbow comes from the logs though. Same as with battlestaves. That is of course unless someone burns it.
---
Which they should
---
Almost literally anything with blowpipe makes it stupid easy. You're good with that gear.
---
A tb in multi and taking multiple people isn't very viable, plus boxing being a bannable offense... as for revs, they offer great xp and potential to get rev weapons, ontop of supply drops, emblems and being in the wilderness the increased chance of pvp weapons
---
Which is crazy cause the gp/hr over 400 hours is still nuts with a tbow drop. 4.25M/hr
---
You can‚Äôt watch a 1 minute video?

Where is the best ranged xp/hour with a cannon?

That is the staff of agility and it gives you a 10k agility xp bonus for every lap you complete successfully.

It‚Äôs for my hardcore Ironman BTW
---
I have both of them already, I usually take them but need the extra space for brews when I'm teaching the boys. Didn't realise it was so small the damage increase though, thanks for the info. 
---
Draman staff, which is needed to use the Fairy Rings, which they probably used to get to Canafis. 
---
I had the worse zulrah unique rng of anyone I ever talked to on that account, I just grinded 400k slay xp in 2 days to get 87 for trident to start zulrah to try and get blowpipe specifically and decided to try it out before I got off
---
Probably use ddarts on jad since cost isn't a big issue for you, and maybe use a veracs skirt or helm for the defense+prayer boost (but if you can manage the waves fine then no need)
---
You do realize that by escaping from a pker you win. Are you saying you should be able to take gear to pvm and pk gear as well? Lol you can‚Äôt have it both ways. 
---
Dramen staff needed to access fairy rings before lumbridge elite is done. Maybe people use fairy ring to get to canafis and then don‚Äôt bank it before getting on the course. 
---
Im assuming thats an emulator? I would not have the ram to supporrt both an emulator and a game at the same time

Barrows is entirely in single and boxing npcs is definitely not bannable lol. 
---
Hi :)
---
I just came back to old school Runescape too. Searching for friends that I could do quests with, or just talk with when not killing Zulrah. 
---
My in-game name is Kate.
---
Honestly probably not but a lot of people use bp. I‚Äôve got max vork gear, just grinding out the rest until I‚Äôm 99 ranged.
---
Because shit gets stale. 
---
Loot in PvP worlds and get bitched at by other people because they're meanies.
---
You really feel a type of way. Your flair says &lt; 99 farming aren't people.
---
Maybe you have an issue with elitism and can't see why rapier is one of the best non degradable weapons still.
---
Maybe it isn't #1 anymore in a lot of things but being #2, #3, or #4 is still worth it.
---
Sorry people don't conform to your way of paying oSRS.
---
not an argument!
---
&gt;I propose we have a dmm tourney in which jagex filters out all known clan affiliates.
---
This is retarded and you are retarded for thinking it would work.
---
...how are those two things diffrent?  One involves having an account getting gear for you, while the other involves... getting gear for you...
---
Having multiple accounts during DMM shoudl be banned, period.  It gives unfair advantage for those who DONT multi account, and allows for literal cheating since one player can trian only combat, while another trains herblore, or crafting for high end potions or items.  It shoudl not be allowd.
---
mage accuracy on olm is near non existent, hence if you are taking mage cape you need to take hat at the same time since you need both at once for a max hit.
---
by default you have 98%+ accuracy on olm mage hand, so stuff like augury, ring etc have very minor dps increase. only thing that really matters if max hit
---
Dagganoths under the lighthouse are like 100k exp/hr
---
Most if the time email addresses and passwords alone don‚Äôt make a strong appeal.
---
Were you able to provide creation dates, payment methods for membership, the ISP you created the account on, etc?
---
Ahahahhaha what... people..waste money on a rsn 
---
I got them today on ironman 41kc

If I have to go to the wilderness for something and I don‚Äôt want to, why would I vote for something that would make it harder for me?

Plus even using them is aginst the rules and is ban-able.

Can I get the music cape without the Christmas songs? Or do I really have to wait until December to get that cape?

2fa is great if jagex didn't give hackers a backdoor to walk straight in and take the 2fa off..
---
He didnt have membership never. Creation date yes. November 9th 2008, isp yes. First password yes
---
i feel dumb for thinking this, but i just realized that the cats aren't just being turned into death runes. my idea was cruel, but yours might be worse
---
you became the very thing you swore to destroy
---
I upvoted you, then noticed your name had "Rawr" in it which is next level cringe, so then I downvoted instead.
---
Level 1400?  WTF (sorry I'm a noob)
---
Fucking hell, guy looks 15 going on 50. 
---
Ironman dmm would be fun to watch imo. Removes muling and new strategies would come up
---
iirc, he was a victim of the rollback. He died and retrieved his items, but the server rollback put his character into the state between him dying and getting his items back.
---
Muling in DMM means transfering your expensive shit to the mule and then logging out so you can never lose them if you die. Completely different to a mercher alt that is constantly logged on and sustaining its own wealth.
---
Gratz on the drop and all, but why would you take a screenshot of your loot in mobile, and then take a screenshot while horizontally looking at that screenshot? ü§î
---
You hate them because you get pked while bossing, slaying and doing clues under the delusion that the wilderness is a safe area from pvp. 
---
People also generalise the  entire pvp community because a few toxic teams like this one exist
---
ya man, jagex tells him what he's doing is ok, but sure I guess he's muling because you think so
---
I can‚Äôt believe people clap between each word irl unironically
---
I think part of the reason I am doing that is because 2t ticks is legitimately free as shit and imo everyone should do it haha. I get that in general tick manipulation seems scary and sweaty to some people but 2t teaks is soooo easy and literally twice as fast. 
---
Also pretty sure just regular old teaks are like the same exp and way more afk at that. 
---
Last I heard he was suing for wrongful dismissal. Shame there weren't criminal charges. 
---
ty gave me some new lines to use when killing people
---
killing people and watching them rage is hilarious, in any game
---
its when pkers turn extra toxic with the racism and dead mom insults that kills it
---
While I can't say I'm a fan of how alts are used in the Tournament, this still seems wrong to do. If they were going to change where the line is between alts and mules, they should have announced it with the other changes in advance. And while discussion of other PvP issues distracts a bit from the primary topic, it does seem like they are pretty strict for DMM Tourny and then too lax outside of it.
---
We at Jagex Inc. love getting our boy pussy penetrated by PvP clans! It's the best we can do to support their community.
---
Toodles\~
---
No its not against the rules to share account.
---
That's how it was when I pulled it up. I ain't working extra hard for a quick Reddit post.
---
Not Nice 
---
2FA can be removed without needing the 2FA device if your email is compromised, rendering it pointless. 
---
Half of the people who were hacked have had their login credentials at some point in time in the past 10 years leaked from various database leaks. This usually would not matter, IF the player also didn't have poor security habits (using the *exact* same password for almost every account ever, in addition to the same handful of emails).
---
The player then gets their 2FA removed via email, which makes the device null and void. Player then reports to reddit that there's no way they could have been hacked because they had 2FA and never clicked a phishing link, though they never seem to state that they've used the same password for 20 different things and also in most cases fail to even have the most basic of security features in game, which is the bank pin.
---
Jagex clearly don't think what he's doing is ok because he got banned from the tournament for it. 
---
What's the definition of muling? 
---
Oh man. I can see why you play runescape bro.
---
That just shows the mentality of people who play this game, scared of words.
---
Are their any real benefits from leveling the skill? 
---
That's what he's telling himself to feel better.
---
The reality is he wasn't cut out for HCIM like most people in OSRS as it's a different playstyle so after getting pked he comes around here for some karma and to try and convince himself "worth".
---
Like a lee sin who does 1v5 but gets a cannon minion and says "worth", no it wasn't.
---
Certain monsters (like I believe jad) are unflinchable because there's nowhere close enough to hide behind or because of the way they are designed. Some of these monsters can be killed with other mechanics that take little/no damage such as venom or walking under after each attack. These methods are what enables 1 pray fire-capes etc. The monster in question (elvarg) IS flinchable. There are videos on YouTube of how to do it. Seriously pussi_destroyer666, before you comment, maybe do a quick google search or look on the official osrs wiki to check if what you're saying is correct. 
---
No it‚Äôs not lol it was against the rules now it isn‚Äôt 
---
Time to not watch DMM
---
Again
---
for the 3rd time
---
Ye but, couldn't you just post the regular screenshot? Or am I missing something?
---
Not trying to be a smartass, just wondering.
---
they dont enforce it. because its not against the rules, except for when used as a means to cheat in competitive scenarios (includes inferno).
---
Redwoods. They're so AFK that I often 5 minute log while cutting them since there just isn't any need for input. 
---
Perfect for doing housework. 
---
Pretty tame reaction from what I hear about him not gonna lie. 
---
Yikes
---
Outside of Diaries/Quests not really. But birdhouse runs are so quick it doesn't really make sense not to do them
---
I only really cared to see torvestas content so no point watching the rest of dmm
---
There is a password reset option...
---
and mine too 
---
I find it surreal how useless jagex is and how many mistakes they make 
---
I agree but when you kill a player there still has to be some sort of reward system to encourage pvp.
---
So let me get this straight... A clan full of people who just feed a few players and also have people in the GE constantly flipping, getting gear, and holding the wealth for the clan since it wont leave the safe zone is fine but having your own alt that you are also playing to do the functions as a solo player that the clans are doing is not fine? 
---
And they wonder why fewer and fewer people play DMM
---
Bro its okay keep lyin' don't forget guys vote no on pvp polls! :D 3===d :P gottem'
---
I asked him, I talked to him a little before the pker showed up
---
didn't intend for there to be any...i was just stating facts.. :/ the devs can't even QA test their own code :shrugs: 
---
IDK how much further I could go from "that's how it popped up". I opened my photo, but edited out anything identifying, and posted. Zero extra effort/details I could possibly include for how it came out.
---
If you have medium done you can keep 5 and make your 210k back from only 25 staves
---
&gt;Players may not sell, share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else.
---
You make a salient point. Unfortunately making any rational argument for PvP in this subreddit gets you downvoted. 
---
While I would say it is good to be open to possibilities, this does seem pretty clear. He had a message saying he was banned for muling and he described what the account was being used for. It seems like a pretty straight forward conclusion and we shouldn't need to wait for a J Mod before having an opinion on the issue; especially since most the video isn't even about DMM directly but the state of PvP in general.
---
Appeal through the proper channels - the recent blog post implied they won't be doing this kind of thing on Reddit anymore and I don't believe I've seen a response to this type of thread since. 
---
Is this Animal Magnetism?
---
I‚Äôm curious how you came up with those percentages.  I‚Äôve never been great at statistics.
---
ü¶Ä11 fucking dollarsü¶Ä
---
If he has 2FA on his email the only way to disable it would be through recovering the account. Either his email security isn't good enough or his recovery info in compromised. 
---
Did you watch the video he asked a jmod last tournament if it was ok and they said yes. Then they banned him this tournament.
---
read comprehension isn't your strong suit. The PVM would then be required to bring both PVP (Defense) and PVM gear. Why would someone who does predominately PVM want their shit so they have to run past jaghoffs that just want to gank them.
---
So PVMers don't want to deal with trolls and shitty PKers that want fed, because they can't beat legit PKers in a 1 v 1. 
---
????
---
Jagex - If you want to make DMM a full Esports like your news announcement suggests, then you need to make clear steps to curbing clanmanmode and stopping stuff like this from happening.
---
An Esport shouldn't have grey areas. If there are, define it and post the new ruling somewhere easily accessible. I recommend a section on the oldschool site specifically for DMM that all players can access.
---
In my opinion this is a disgrace for an Esport, you banned a player for a rule he thought was ok after asking a Jmod. My guess is that question was never documented, so no one knows it actually happened. This is a failure on Jagex, not Torvesta.
---
DMM is dead man mode, not dead clan mode.  only option to put solos on the same playing field as clans is to not allow trading in dmm.
---
Lmao what the fuck was that
---
He was banned today for it
---
I'll have a bit of free time here in April, but probably not over the summer. Is it too late to get into this game and expect to progress significantly? I've played a healthy amount of RS in my day but I don't have a good OSRS account currently.

ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
He can also hit 255 or something so he 1 shots you pretty often when he hits you. 
---
exactly, they drop in 3s, meaning that he had the scrolls before the log came out.
---
Because they're in the wilderness, a PvP enabled area. If they want to not need to defend themselves they can do PvM literally anywhere else in the game.
---
Very sad to hear.
---
The only reason I begun playing Runescape again is because Youtube  randomly put one of Torvesta's DMM tournament videos in my recommended. Was hooked watching his entire series ever since, and even started my own OSRS account because of it.
---
Truth be told, the best thing about DMM tournaments is watching Torvesta bust his ass trying his absolute best to get to the 1v1's - Everything else about it is 'meh' - without this series myself (and I assume many others) have 0 interest. Not a good idea Jagex...
---
Let's make Jagex aware of this post.
---
Join 'Jedi CC' for a fun, laid back group. Focused on events, PvM, PvP, and chat. 
---
He states later in the video that the alt goes into the wilderness to hunt for PvP weapons as well.
---
Aaah you wanted to take out identifying parts! Ye that makes sense! 
---
Again, sorry if I appeared as a "lol ur so dumb learn to take screenshots" kinda guy, I just get curious when I see less common screenshot situations :P
---

---
Damn, I was GENUINELY looking forward to seeing Torvesta's content. 
---
‚ÄúLast tournament‚Äù 
---
It's against the rules on paper but the 07 team has come out and said they won't enforce it as long as you aren't account sharing for rank/competitive advantages. 
---
As someone who's not well versed in DMM in the slightest, what's the difference between Torvesta's alt and solo missions? 
---
What the hell is Zulrah Helper?

Where can I appeal? I'm not aware of this.

---
This is the old rules you get them from fandom wiki, check the good one or in the oficial website.
---
Also, you can flinch Jad in a way. You still take hits but you can run out, hit, get hit back, eat to full, run out, hit etc. etc. If you do this with purple sweets, as long as jad can't hit your entire hp in one hit, you can't die. This is also how people venom him. No this isn't true flinching, but it is still a form of flinching
---
I wouldn't want to appeal in this way but it seems the only way to appeal this kind of offense. 
---
We need some profitable minigames for PvP (an extension of what there is for BH) like there are bosses for PvM and resource gathering for skilling.
---
That would encourage more PvP. Pkers are pretty fed up of pure food chain content too and BH is outdated in its rewards.
---
So they dq him for muling but tell him in the message it's because he harassed Skill Speccs? :thonking:
---
Also, everyone seriously playing DMM has someone doing this shit, if they do it on an alt or have friends doing it. What do you think the clans are doing?
---
Just tell em that their nerbs are like seaweed

Can confirm, am his Brass key.

I'd be down to watch all ironman DMM. No drops from kills so the only reason to pk is to set people back. Basically no one will have black d'hide which is great because that shit is op. Just a bunch of dudes in rune crossbows, green dhide, and rune, with a handful of barrows pieces here and there. Will eliminate swapping, muling, etc. and be a content treasure trove.

\&gt; If you want I can use your most recent post as an example instead, where you ask for clarification on how chambers of xerics are a high level activity when you can fish food at lvl 10? 
---
It was a valid question since I haven't tried CoX at that point, not that has anything to do with pvp, so yeah you can use it if you want.  Keep grasping at straws trying to state how I know nothing about pvp while blabbing out objectively wrong shit about pvp. 
---
\&gt; Besides, the original point was to just fight back, we're not talking about an even fight or deathmatch. You can literally stand there with an msb and auto retaliate while you're frozen and dps pures enough to make them eat/stop smiting. That alone provides more benefit than simply running away would do. 
---
...  The goal isn't to have a cool fight, it's to win.  That was the original point of my comment, fighting back is useless if the end result is still inventory loss.  I'm not going to win just by msbing the guy doing 42s, unless that guy is at least half as dim-witted as you.  You're actually fucking clueless and you should really stop embarrassing yourself.
---
\&gt; I just don't get why you're so cocky. 
---
We've established there's a lot of things you don't get but I'll try to explain: because you're being an imbecile.  And the more you respond the stupider your points get.  You're trying to argue a point that's already settled - virtually no one counter-pks.  It's not worth it.  You've at this point subconsciously realized that you've chosen to adopt a factually wrong argument, and the only reason you're still here is because you're trying to heal your injured ego, relying on deflections, circumstantial unrealistic scenarios, and awful insults (calling me a victim?  Do you need a few hours to come up with an insult that actually hits at all?).  
---
I'm smug because you're headbutting a concrete wall.  Take a walk.
---
Surprised they changed their stance on GP flipping. Regardless, no one gets banned for muling as long as u don't record urself doing it to 100k+ people.

Might as well just have a clan only tournament at this point /s 
---
I started playing again about a year ago after watching some DMM in hopes that I could get enough game knowledge to participate some day. Over the last few DMMs its become clear that no matter how much game knowledge I gain (I could know the entire source code for goodness sakes) I'd still be unable to play DMM as a solo player against clans. Furthermore, it sure makes it boring to watch 3 zergs of players run in circles. I want my FFAs...

It makes sense that they changed their mind because GP flipping is literally muling. With that being said, they should fucking tell the players that it is now bannable. Everyone did it.
---
LOLLLOL
---
Haha sorry! I had no idea we had a home world
---
Look the new video by torvesta
---
They tried this already in either season 2 or 3 and it was the fucking worst season ever. Sharks were 3.5k ea.
---
Here's my idea on how to stop Clanman Mode
---
- Change the usernames of all people to something generic.
---
- Remove friends list on these worlds.
---
- No more green dots, no team capes either.
---
- No clan chat.
---
Sure some small clans can band together but it'll be a lot harder for massive clans to organize.
---
I generate eternal kebabs on purpose just to make people WTF.
---
It's actually still just slayer
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs a bad move by Jagex. The whole point of the tournament is to advertise the game as he said in the video. By banning one of the most watched players they‚Äôre really making themselves look bad here.
---
While streamer favouritism is also not liked by the community, they could have at least warned him, or even banned just his alt. Especially if he had a JMod say he wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong in the first place. 
---
YAHOOOOOOO
---
how about you fuck off if your going to be rude 
---
I dont have a login setting in that spot
---
That isn't a donation? That is just being a part of a clan which is literally the only option.

... i mean... How long has dmm been like this? Why isn't there DMM Ironman only to prevent such mules and bullshit? Pvp reward for ironman? Convert them into currency based on value of items (Idk) something like that and buyable from special npc vendor with items u want to buy (REASONABLE ITEMS, Not like twisted bow and lol ez gears) specific combat level to get those? (idk just a thought) Idk i bet tons of us have valid ideas but jagex isn't trying their BEST to make DMM more entertainment cuz most dmm i have been seeing (honestly i'm sick of clan mode)  Kills the fun and defeat purpose of dmm. This is just disheartening to see dmm's direction going to wrongful path. Jagex, i guess you proven yourself useless.

Just got it done, thanks for the tips mate
---
clans aren't "the issue", solo crybabies are
---
It's amazing how jagex can literally keep fucking up at every chance they get.
---
It has to be intentional at this point I refuse to believe any company is terminally this stupid
---
Yeah a cc full of randoms that quickly got over-run by a better clan. Where were the solo players?
---
What a shame
---
It amazes me how incompetent Jagex is
---
It wasn't meant to be rude though.
---
It's a sub to see people learning like we did back when we started.
---
Google search: OSRS clan
---
Dude the point of dmm is to risk items for reward, having an alt is avoiding that 
---
Theyd all just use discord to communicate rather than clan chats and just mass suicide to the person they want to win
---
Finally Jagex outdid themselves*
---
It's also funny how they have twisted the rules of the game for DMM so much that it is basically impossible for anyone to learn quickly. All they do is a newspost on announcement of a season that gets buried within a couple weeks, and you're lucky if they even list all the changes to the game, not just the changes from last season. They're making it really hard for new players to get into it.
---
Hell, not even the wiki has a lot information about DMM-specific rules beyond the very basics...
---
Only difference is that he does something with it. Clans have people that do the exact same thing and its fine.
---
Sad day honestly I was stay excited for it
---
Not for 700 hours.  Like, rolling back 700 hours of work, that's pretty much an account deletion already
---
Thats a clan full of randoms that were only there for that 1 reason.
---
Is it edible?
---
Damn watching Torv play DMM got me back into RS had no clue what was going on but just looked like a blast. It‚Äôs crazy they‚Äôd ban one of their top content creators without even talking to them. What‚Äôs next swampletics for cheating the big? #freetorvesta

Thanks, I hate that I love it. 
---
Pvp has been dead for a while in osrs, since when range tanks were supreme. Like around zulrah release imo.

Started playing the game with a range tank. Turned it into a main, play pvm exclusively except for some wildy roaming sometimes, never looked back.

But then people still will feed accounts.
---
Torvesta and everyone else who mules should be banned from the tournament. 
---
Prims are only -1 range though ü§î
---
The reason Torvesta got banned was because he didnt train his alt.  
---
Last time he was chopping oaks in varrock while flipping which means he's actually playing the account more than just buying selling. I'm pretty sure this is the reason he got banned.

---
Aye that makes sense. I was just musing that at the very least if the game mode was based around clans then that design would seem more balanced with the removal of alts, but if they removed the benefits of a clan without touching alts then alts would seem to be a pretty big design problem. 
---
Thanks! Actually found someone to watch now

Wait you mean you put extra restrictions on your account but don't constantly complain on reddit how the game is unfair for locking you out of stuff, What is your secret?

I would say some quests that reward defence xp would be your best bet man, off the top of my head I can think of a souls bane, nature spirit and dragon slayer, you‚Äôll maybe get like 20k defence xp in total from those which will boost your level a good bit. Although dragon slayer does reward strength and attack xp too iirc.

Content developers shouldn't get special treatment regarding breaking of rules. 
---
Looking at your replies u sound like the biggest fucktard in all of osrs reddit
---
Yes, not (true) flinching. Just like if the definition of safing was eating to full, eating to 90% hp wouldn't be (true safing) but would still be deemed safing. With purple sweets and a max hit that can't 1 hit you, it is effectively the same thing. Also I'm not sure if you read my last comment correctly but what I described is not tick-eating. What I said was taking a hit, walking back into a safe area and healing to full, before walking back out. Tick-eating is where you eat in the same game tick (0.6 seconds) as an attack animation where the calculation of the attack damage has already been made. It used to be that if you were on 1hp, an opponent could only hit 1 or 0. Therefore if you ate in the same tick as the attack, the hit would register as a 1 and you could heal just before the hit and always be hit a 1. This meant as long as you timed it right, you could always heal above the hit because it could never hit above your hp (1). They patched this a while ago because while it was considered somewhat controversial in pvm, it was extremely overpowered in pvp because using dharoks, you could stay 1hp and always tick-eat your opponent's damage while hitting huge hits (due to the dharok set-effect). This was also because pid changed non-randomly so could be accounted for. This essentially meant you couldn't die in pvp if you always timed your tick-eating right, (different from safing because you can spec anyone from max hp with the right gear).
---
His name is literally ‚Äú82% black‚Äù and South America has interesting race relations to say the least.
---
Lmao the clans do this too, just on a larger scale....might as well ban whole clans and their reps
---
It's weird now. Some pures seem to be lower how some seem higher. I would see range = cannon magic=splash or alch just quest to get initial melee stats then train normally melee wise for hp.
---
Lmao I vote yes for all pvp updates. You are just mad cause you suck at dmm and now you want the rules changed to benefit you. God you are such a lil baby!
---
Someone muling who was stupid enough to record it got banned?
---
What's the problem?
---
(2999/3000) ^(x) = % chance of not getting the drop
---
X is the kill count.
---
Example:
---
3000 Kill count
---
(2999/3000) ^(3000)  ‚âà  0.3678
---
(1 - 0.3678) = 0.6322
---
So at 3000 kills you have a roughly 36.78% chance to not have seen a 1/3000 drop, or a 63.22% chance of getting the drop.
---
You'd never imagine! Before I started this account I made the decission that I wanted to play the game in the way that this gamemode offers :D
---
Who remembers CALLING for membership?
---
Except every large clan has a multitude of mules who sit there flipping all day as well with no repercussion, the only difference is torvesta was doing it on 2 accounts instead of having his friend Jim do it exclusively

All memes aside, how does anyone prevent DDOSing? Especially if its one player DDOSing another player? Jagex can protect its own servers, but how does it protect other players from getting DDOSed? Even if there is a solution, is it easy to implement? Will it be expensive? Is it in the budget? Would it require the entire game to be uprooted and rewritten or would it be as simple as updating "Anti DDOS" to version 2.0?  
---
Jagex isn't powerless against clans. EVERYONE is. You can't stop people from working together. Some of these crab memes really shame Jagex for things that are clearly out of their control. This wouldn't be an issue for years if it were easy to implement.
---
UIM Karamja is my go to

How is one related to the other? They're different offences.  I do agree that Torvesta shouldn't be DQ-ed for that.

It isn't pay to win. It's pay to be slightly less disadvantaged. The games so unbalanced that you require alts to even have a chance at competing, and even then you're still minor next to a clan. This isn't pay to win, it's just poorly designed content

I usually dont care...about anything really. But this makes me quite disappointed.  Jagex‚Äôs inconsistencies w/ pvp and clans is on full display and I hope they get bent over by the community for it.
---
Thats Why they would need to find a way to solve this. They being the people that get paid to work at Jagex
---
It doesn't matter if he broke the rule, the point is that the rule is unclear, is not being enforced with any consistency, is harmful to the tournerment in the first place, that torvesta didn't get a warning, and that torvesta is making a high profile youtube series basically advertising the game and giving thousands entertainment.
---
There's so much wrong with this beyond the superficial "it's technically breaking a rule" argument. And keep in mind this is a video game, not a law that needs to be enforced.
---
This is why I‚Äôm happy the add fluoride to water..

Jagex really doesn't give a shit if you cancel your membership. Chances are you'll probably end up resubscribing in a week.

Basically what they're trying to push is clans clans clans, don't even bother if you're a solo player, it's not worth the struggle.
---
More like if one police officer said it was ok last week, and now someone else is arresting you. But who am I to argue, the hoard has already made up their minds.

Didn't they already do this and it was still broken? A clan of irons can still hold down a GWD world etc.

---
If you look at what they're doing the accounts are technically different. If you look at their purpose theyre the exact same. Torvesta had his account making money to feed his main. Clans had their crafter there to make gear/money to feed its members. Its too arbitrary to say "Oh hey this guy didn't train any skills therefore hes a mule" because then people can train to (for example) base 30s combat stats to get by it.
---
I'm not saying torvesta is not using that account as a bank as well as a moneymaker, but if jagex's rules do not allow that, then clan skilling accounts shouldnt be allowed either. 
---
Torvesta is one of the reasons I still watch RS videos ... smh jagex you never cease to disappoint

---
Untrue, as a streamer is in a position to influence other people through their own actions.
---
Mate they literally did this (but with the GE as well). Swapping and feeding was still running rampant and all it did was kill the game mode for actual players. DMM is a pking game mode, not a skilling game mode.

The GE is the critical difference maker, though. You can't just say "it was like ironman but with the GE".

Well for starters rot getting feed information about safe zones for dmm and getting ip info so they could ddos opponents.

Hes been doing this and recording it for the past 4+ DMM tournies lol. This is just Jagex arbitrarily banning him for no reason, stop making excuses for them. It's not like he was trying to "hide" the fact that he used this account, he's literally done it forever. The fact that they randomly decided to ban him now, without warning, is complete and utter bullshit. But I mean it's Jagex, that's to be expected.

The only issue with WoW pvp is how much you need to know to understand what‚Äôs really going on for the most part, and WoW is finally starting to hit a wall in its popularity. Even WoW pvp in its current state is 100x better than rs pvp though, at least Blizzard doesn‚Äôt straight ignore it and not fix major issues, some of the updates and patches may not be well received at times but WoW pvp was INSANELY popular back in the prime days, the only issue us streaming didn‚Äôt exist like it does now nor did the same esport market. If it did though, wow pvp would have been massive. I without a doubt had far more fun pvping on WoW during its 6-8 year hayday than RS, RS PVP is just far too neglected and broken in many ways to EVER be anything that Jagex claims they want for it. There‚Äôs plenty of times when a player with better gear and better stats is attacking someone in considerably worse gear and considerably worse skill(sometimes just doing nothing right) and yet that person isn‚Äôt punished for it and lives and the better pvper is just splashing or hitting 0s/low and that just isn‚Äôt acceptable in the least bit if they want to be serious about Pvp becoming something in this game, and of course that just scratches the surface of the issues in PvP and just general lack of attention/updates/fixes to gameplay. They‚Äôve been handing out this lip service about PvP about how they‚Äôre listening and want it to flourish etc FOR YEARS now, not going to believe them nor or ever until they actually show a tad bit of competency. Pretty sad since, with fixes and an overhaul in some aspects and a new enticing way to PvP would make it really blow up again kind of like how it was back in the day, but I won‚Äôt hold my breath.
---
Dude he worked hard for that bronze.. thats a weeks wages irl for him!
---
Both of those have been handled with Jed getting fired. They clearly didn't ignore it.
---
Unfortunately you're wrong. Couldn't give a shit about the tournament. What I do give a shit about though is this place of discussion being turned into a place for you to spam retarded nonsense and drive some sort of personal agenda. Instead of spamming shit, email a jmod asking them to fix whatever the fuck asinine bullshit you're trying to push. Please don't be a sheep. Think for yourself and stop following the herd.
---
He ain‚Äôt even do shit tho
---
God yes, this is the way.
---
Vorkath is just great for all around skilling drops. Lots of crafting and prayer xp in bones/hides, it drops addy ores, dragon bolts/darts/arrows which can be hard to get a sizable amount. The ward and dfs are just a bonus in my eyes. 
---
Personally i melee him, ive preferred that over blowpipe even before I upgraded to a dragon hunter lance. Never felt that dumping that many scales was worth it. 
---
Even if you don‚Äôt camp him, getting the assembler is a huge upgrade. Its better accuracy and damage over the accumulator and it never drops ammunition to the ground. Its 80% reused and 20% destroyed instead of 72# reused, 8% on the ground, and 20% destroyed. Its absolutely worth doing the 50 kills (or less if you‚Äôre lucky)then coming back later when you‚Äôre better geared
---
It's as ironman as a PvP game mode can get. It's literally referred to as the ironman season of DMM. You can make a pvp gamemode with ironman restrictions when you cna kill others for their loot. Just doesn't work.

Yes they do make more monsters the more players you have, it's fucking hectic with a full team.
---
No, nobody really plays it as there's no point. I think maybe some very niche scenarios when you'd want to (think like points boosting if everyone stands in the middle and pro-melee while another guy barrages or chin's). There's just no real benefit to playing full team.
---
Why not? 
---
 No plz no
---
Assuming he plays the game outside of just RC'ing nats (since he just wanted to do RC to "sustain" his account), Graceful is 100% worth it. It will reduce the weight in all other aspects of the game, and help out in almost every skill in the game.

But how many dmm tournaments did they get away with it before they did something? And they also did nothing for all the dmm tournaments they finally did it once he was hacking accounts to rwt
---
I agree the jmod should be held responsible, it was probably negligent for him to tell Torvesta what he was doing wasn't bannable. Regardless imo playing two accounts in dmm is pretty iffy anyways, it's certainly an unfair advantage for a true solo player. 
---
He's probably using super combats
---
I qualified 2-4 accounts every DMM Seasonal I played in. I was nowhere near competitive either - I just felt like it was the only way I could even participate, lol.

I would say 2-300 could be pretty accurate.

Because there was little conclusive evidence that it was actually him leaking stuff like IPs and final locations. Even now there still really isn't, it's mostly circumstantial. It's pretty convincing, sure, but not enough to ban the clan over.

It would, but what happens if someone changes their phone and forgets to deactivate it? Then they cant get access to their account.

Thanks a bunch!! Appreciate it.

Wait a second. Let me get this right.
---
You think that it is perfectly valid for that account to play in complete safety and let tens to hundreds of other people mule resources on it as no problem, effectively giving the entire clan the benefit of a perfectly safe permanent mule, because it is one person benefiting a clan and providing some crafting services.
---
However, if any single random person thinks 'hey, it might be nice to do the same thing so I can keep up with the clans,' then it's a grievous game-breaking offense?
