My accounts so old you cant use an email to access it username only that I made in 2005 when I was in elementary school

It's the animation for the lunar spell so it'd be misleading to have it used for both things.

Yeah thia guys bitter, i made about 5m on my first 15. Hit an ahrims top on 7kc
---
I find it strange that many don't. I check regularly. Felt a weird hump on one my balls a half year ago and got kinda nervous. They put gel on my balls and echo'd it just like they would on a pregnant belly. Luckily it was only a cysts.
---
Just finished getting auto weed, never going back 😩
---
Hey man, thanks for your message. Just more about varicoceles, good to know what's up. I'm from Lithuania and studying in UK right now. Hope that is enough information and appreciate your help!
---
Can you? Yes, but you’ll hate the game forever. You might as well get 56 for the next quest.
---
Lmfao I read it as that too and was 300 confused 
---
You've unlocked:
---

---
Nothing of value
---
Ench Zenyte
---
Ice Barrage
---
Skillcape
---
Someone is better than me, I don’t like it, wah wah wah
---
The only exp waste that's worth it
---
F u.... I'm like 175 with no uniques
---
Why is this meme resurfacing again in a lot of places? I ain't complaining tho. You got me.
---
Lmao 240 and u bitching gtfo my first shard was 430 second like 900 n third was 1400 i jkilled 1700-1800

Method for agility or runecrafting? For Lava runes it was fire tiara with graceful and ring of dueling. Inventory of just an earth talisman, fire runes, and all essence. Tele to duel arena, slightly north enter the fire altar, use the earth talisman on the altar inside, teleport to castlewars, bank, repeat. All that for maybe 40k an hour not including the times I misclicked and just made fire runes like a dumbass. 
---
Fishy as fuck lmao, not gonna go that site
---
Well that depends
---
Yes
---
What happens if an Ironman and a regular player drop something on the same spot. How does the game differentiate between what the Ironman can and can't take?
---
They're both a slog, but I try and keep the silver lining in mind for both. For RC I know I'm making a shit ton of money, and for agility I know it's such a helpful high level skill for basically every area of the game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Between the two, I think agility is easier to mindlessly grind for hours, and the monkey part of my brain learns to get hyped when I find a mark of grace, so that's neat.
---
So only player 1 would be able to pick up any sharks?
---
Hmm I’d like to know the story behind girlfriend/step sister. 
---
/r/noisygifs
---
Literally my thought as well. 
---
You don't have to go in defenseless. If you want to rag vetion in monk robes and not put up a fight back thats fine.  
---
Generally people who think people who think the wild should be risk free played after they removed it. 
---
Jagex "encouraging" people to go into the wild is a scapegoat argument. Content should never be balanced for ironmemes. Nobody needs to kill these bosses. They can just buy a d pick if they want one so bad. 
---
The aspect of getting pked is what makes these bosses exciting, it's what makes the wilderness exciting. Could you imagine if callisto wasnt in deep wild?  Shit would be fucking stupid. 
---
Do you think green dragons should be safe? 
---
Because it makes those skills a combat skill
---
A G G R E S S I V E
---
Organ? 
---
OSRS memes give me life 
---
Quick, drown him in memes
---
No, agility. 
---
Tile skipping the fire wall shouldn't be needed in most cases, just when rng is against you.
---
Pettition to bring back the removal of the wilderness
---
I smell some juicy sadcringe up in here
---
Reeee that's like. All I can feel though other than balls. I dont know what I'm looking for.
---
Can you come do it for me? No homo ;)
---
I don’t play RuneScape a lot just if I have a few hours my character is always the same as I left it and I don’t have to worry about being out of touch with the meta and I can do whatever I want to do.. 
---
[removed]
---
I found the image in r/teenagers and cropped out the text above
---
You have to kinda fumble it around. On top of your nuts are 
---
epididymis so you shouldn't worry about those unless they hurt, and around your balls there can be a lot of vens deferens. Sometimes i think shit that's a hump on my nut, only to feel it's just the vas deferens kinda being in the way. What you should worry about is if you feel things on the side of your nuts.
---
Sadly rng can go both ways. 
---
61 magic, the guide I had just said wear Ahrims which with 51 defence cant happen lol. I'll try it with Splitbark I guess? I can do Mystic if that's better but I cant afford Infinity. 
---
pretty awful to be honest

You say that, he's only number 16

Wow so new and original

---
Inexcusable 
---
New skills should be introduced that make left or right handed characters more powerful for certain tasks, maybe dual wielding could be introduced but limited by your strength skill, 15-24 daggers, 25-34 swords, 35-44 long swords and maces, 45-54 warhammers and battleaxes, 55-64 scimitars. 65+ 2h weapons able to be wielded in only your main hand and the ability to equip a sq shield in the offhand. Etc
---
I'm thinking weapons would suffer a power and speed deficit of 12.5% each making dual wielding 75% faster attack speed overall with a 25% power reduction making dual wielding 50% more powerful than single wielding while also suffering the loss of a shield. Maybe lock the skill behind a quest requiring a bunch of stuff that's kinda hard or a skill that needs to be leveled above the Varrock castle with the guards or something.
---
Idk, someone smarter than me could flesh it out better.
---
Valv... Jagex, please fix.
---
Should have more upvotes 
---
This man speaks the truth and I gotta say I’m grateful to people like Settled that condense 40+hours of grind in a single high quality video.
---
Really? Thought it did. My bad. Not sure where I got bad info from then.
---
I mean if it just outright beats the rapier and competes with scythe for time at cox it’s not just a dboot-&gt;prim boot increase in dps 
---
Seers village
---
Back in the early days of RSMV's, had a couple plebs ask me to help them with a video. They were attacking each other in the wilderness. Nbd. One starts dying, asks me to help out, BOOM skulled, RIP the 5k I had at the time. 
---
Good guide but a small little correction:
---
&gt;If their account has 2fa on it, then simply insta-disable it, since the e-mail is now registered to yours.
---
If you recover an account, the 2fa is disabled.  The 2fa should be disabled by step 9 of your guide.   A successful recovery request disables 2fa instantly, no email required.  
---
Jagex have had way worse bugs than a simple enemy not showing up and they're still doing fine
---
king arthur strikes again
---
Glad to hear it man thank you &lt;3

I mean, if your employer requires you to use it I get you. If not then whatever program you're using likely has an adequate program to do the same thing on Windows is all I'm saying.
---
yellow on yellow :/
---
That wildy one could even go up to like 96 range/str/agi
---
Maybe needs some level tweaks but good post overall! Hope you get more votes so this gets seen by more people! 
---
And they should also be a little bit squeezable. Very hard balls aren't a good sign.
---
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNNNNNNNNN
---
The loot tab we never asked for, but realize we needed all along.
---
Even that still exists in the real stock market, it's called scalping
---
Woot, gratz! I failed that fight a few times today. Any tips on killing the gorillas? 105 Cmb btw
---
Been training a low hp pure for first time since I got base 90s on main. Honestly had a ton of fun grinding out some of the content I thought I’d hate. Went from afking castle wars for decorative to trading over range gear and messing people up (or other way around). Anyways ye the grind to unlock it is very reasonable and you learn to enjoy it, who would have a problem giving them more content to enjoy that doesn’t affect people like me and my friends who Pam. Hope y’all continue to get support so I can make one too eventually 
---
What about using wildy altar?
---
Tried that yesterday, the guy logged with my 10k lol
---
Please explain how zammy is more money per hour than zulrah/vorkath 
---
I just use the Google password thing since I only have Android/Google devices.
---
Nah I have no idea, would hope he got what was comin to him though. Could’ve fucked up a huge portion of that dudes life.
---
I alch while doing agility because it makes it slightly more rewarding getting two things I need to do done at once. Ironman so I can't just sell my alchables on the GE. 
---
whynotboth.gif
---
only 4 times? im at 52 and im at like 6 or 7. 
---
What you can do to secure you account after being hacked? Absolutely nothing.
---
Whats the highest level someone has gotten without actually training runecrafting? So far I’m getting diaries for the xp lamps (up to hards now) so that at least when I have to train it, I can make a slight profit. 
---
Slayer was all rapier. Bandos was straight up just rapier with ovl and turms after the first month of dung once people realized CLS bandos was false hype. 
---
I killed them one by one and then focused back on jad. Took me a little longer but got the kill. Try that
---
Chain contracts are amazing. My record for chain completions is 4 so far. Snapdragon -&gt; Potato Cactus -&gt; Poison Ivy -&gt; Snape Grass -&gt; White Berry

Yes every 3 failed attacks that the gorilla makes, it will change its attack style. For ex: 3 failed mage attacks on you will force it to change to range or melee. Another trick to find out what its next attack is (when it has to change attack styles) is to take one step away from the gorilla when it is about to change attack styles. 
---
Fyi: i let nieve kill the gorilla in mm2 quest LOL. I hit the gorilla once or twice for some damage then hid behind the wall and let nieve do the needful
---
I love it too, but recently converted just because of how annoying herblore and runecrafting sadly is. And the whole lootbag shuffle just isn't fun gameplay. But admire people that do!
---
with a farming contract, do you have to grow it inside the farming guild?
---
You can try lining them up so you only get hit by one of them, if youre good at prayer switching you can pray melee between jad hits, or you can try to get them stuck behind jad by going through jad. 
---
Yes to my main, but i do want to stay at 70 attack and defence 
---
I keep it on to help cc members out if they need it, have made good friends this way. I remember it was a chore early last year to have it on because of the spam bots but honestly I haven’t gotten pm’d in 6+ months with any of those offers. Forgot they existed, even. 
---
Gmaul smacking thru that ely dam 
---
Pretty prettyy pretttty ... prettty good
---
Did this when I was a noob. In my defense though I was in 4th or 5th grade and didn’t know what would happen.
---
Why do I hate agility?
---
The games necklace list is literally aids.
---
Once you get past mid game it’s just a worse grind than normal mode. Solo zammy Bandos arma isn’t really fun. Really people only have fun when they hit good rng and get an item early on but going dry on a shit grind blows. Having to get a dwh is a bitch 
---
Up to you though. 
---
Obby    
---
If you do NMZ, do Dharok at 91hp
---
Can you still afk bandits for hours?
---
Try swapping a verac skirt in if you have the money. Also make sure you brew and restore before the jad wave so you get the defense buff. I did it with only 72 defense so the healers cant be smacking you THAT hard. I left one or two healers on Jad while I killed the ones I aggroed just to be safe since they wouldn’t heal him to full in the time it took me to be ready to aggro the ones I left
---
Surprisingly, neither my junk e-mail nor my main email have been breached and they’re both a couple years old. Good shit gmail.
---
Only 37 alts? LOL good luck maintaining optimal exp rates bud
---
im kinda new to osrs, will summoning/dungeoneering ever be in osrs or is that too new?
---
Terror dogs are their own thing though and require a higher slayer lvl to kill. I do kinda get them also counting as dogs likehow lots of demons can count as black or greaters.

Two more shoutouts from me:
---
[Draizard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4379Q4Z_IBWOj8x1HsKFsg) He's also doing the UIM for morytania, around the same time as Settled so its possible he was inspired by Settled's goals and followed. Up to 7 or 8 episodes, personally have not gotten around to checking him out but he has good like to dislike ratios so figured I'd point him out.
---
[Tedious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AIgiLpkg-w&amp;t=) Is a Kourend only UIM. I find his videos are not as fun as some other content locked ironmen because of his personality, but he's an amazing player and perfect for background video while you grind out content yourself. I want to point out Tedious is a cool dude in my experience and I am not ragging on him, he just doesn't show as much excitement as some of the other personalities being discussed in here.
---
You can buy a rake from the gardener, along with other gardening supplies, if you speak to them.
---
Just turn on the withdraw all feature at the bottom of the interface? 
---
Beta males fapping all day.
---
More like number 11
---
would full guthans be better xp per hour than using a d scim with the armor alone?
---
I got to level 69 with only xp from rewards and tears of guthix. 
---
yes
---
All I know is it will be worth more than what it currently is....I hope lol
---
I wish I could have 2 clients open. lol
---
because it’s not fun and it’s *just* active enough to where you can’t really afk it 
---
&gt;  I do know for a fact that the email is correct and is the same one used to log into the account.
---
How do you know this?
---
Like have you seen a page from jagex saying that "we are sending e-mails to this address: ....."
---
If not go to your account settings on the main website and request a change of e-mail. You should get a page like this: https://i.imgur.com/UmSW2fU.png
---
Verify that the e-mail matched the one you think it should be. 
---
Yep, there plenty of available resources. But if this is toggleable, which is what I support, y'all would still cry over its existence.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ can't make everyone happy
---
Then abby bludgeon, Abby dagger, Sara sword, then d scim in order of descending gp. Be sure to go get your d def if you haven’t already 
---
This. I feel like NMZ was literally a completely different minigame from what they intended. It was supposed to be a way to re-fight quest bosses at harder difficulties or en masse. But it now lies as a best EffXp/hr for late game (while still being weirdly and extremely AFK!) And also being a super essential jewelry upgrade content is weird and seems super tacked on/ unthematic.
---
This hurts my balls
---
Yes. All contracts are done in the guild 
---
I killed myself 3 times to be on the safe side but I only gained like 6 xp? Am I missing something?^^american btw
---
Same with 60 thieving. Fuck master farmers.
---
That's a thing?
---
Why am i always downvoted? You guys are mean.
---
holy fuck. thanks for the memory flash back 
---
literally running to bank and accidently dropped the wrong seed
---
She killed one of mine and then gave up :c she refused to move, not sad she will soon be gone kek

Sick editing bro
---
uh yeah
---
I'm not sure why you're getting down voted.
---
People have proved that you can compromise an entire network through a fax machine by faxing it a malicious image which is treated as a firmware update. Not much is off limits if people REALLY want to go the distance, but effort vs reward
---
Maybe if they don’t mention it people will think it’s some secret thing 
---
I know this because it is the same exact email I used to both register and login.. And I can't gain access to my account because I can't get past the validate my account screen.. 
---
I’m sitting on a 96m bank going off of runelite (if it’s accurate), they said to aim to get range up so I can do bosses like zulrah and that dragon slayer 2 one
---
Well done, but were those big bones, spongebob?
---
Perfect, thanks! Haven't had time to get the d defender yet. How many hours does it take? Would you know
---
I found this out today too, it’s amazing 
---
Humble brag
---
Faster with wildy altar
---
No? The bank is a specific system /interface. 
---
I don't understand what that means. Sorry, I'm only playing 3 months 
---
wow thanks, i hate it
---
Honestly, not sure. I'm more in to passive income (birdhouses, farming) than active. Green dragons are probably around that at your level, but you're also in a prime level bracket to be PKed.
---
Hunter would also be good but it takes time to level. 
---
Runecrafting through the abyss (natures, or cosmics after 59) should be above that too.
---
&gt; I know this because it is the same exact email I used to both register and login.
---
This can change. The e-mail you use to login with isn't always the same as the one you have registered. 
---
And the e-mail you have registered can be changed at any time. 
---
Is this a newer account that you created with the iOS game center by any chance?
---
Valueable drop: x 3 Feathers (9gp)
---
It is a thing! But still, allowing us to Shift-click for this, still speeds things up. For example running runes through the Abyss, it lets me withdraw a stamina potion, fill my inv with essence, back out, drink the potion bag the essences, then withdraw it all a lot faster.
---
I started an UIM a week ago, im up to 555 total and 37 qp. I love how it makes you appreciate and reevalute the value of your carried items. I am however changing to normal ironman because how how annoying RC and Herblore is looking :(
---
dangit.jpg
---
Finally, some good fucking art
---
It's how it should have worked in the first place, rather than the interface buttons. Probably won't happen now though.
---
Could always tele grab, not the best fix, but atleast it's not as bad as "the items are gone forever!"
---
any way to contact Jagex to lock your account out from ever being recovered?
---
I believe the pieces of the ring are around 1 in 200, leather is 1 in 500, and claw is 1 in 1k. So by drop rates he should be close to finishing a ring, and have a leather by now. And probably should have a spine too but idk the drop rates on that. Either way hes had some wierd luck.
---
Lol, maybe change the title. Unless it’s accurate, then cool man...
---
It's a newer account (literally 4-5 days old) but it was created via the website on my laptop. 
---
We will see how it goes? I have been in a meeting and I will be there in the car for the help with a couple of weeks and I haven't had time he has to the store.
---
Are you able to log in to the website or not?
---
Full obisidan with a obsidian weapon and beserker necklace is very good strength for low defense monsters.   
---
Otherwise get a sara blessed sword or abyssal dagger if you're just looking for a good strength training weapon.

Yea that’s I was feeling too. Early game was fun but I don’t see myself really putting the time into this account. I bond it every now and then but end up not playing it.

Someone asked about this on a Q&amp;A. Iirc they said it would take a lot of work because the bank can't register shift clicks or something.

lucky you!!!

Wraths are pretty good if you have 95. Think around 1.5 to 1.6m. Not bad for rc anyway 
---
O? First time hearing about it..
---
While these items seem great, having them be seasonal is a horrible idea, putting useful items on an unstable market.
---
Same, shot up 5 str levels
---
Why do you type like an asshole
---
joel u there
---
A GPU mode that actually works and a scalable interface 
---
if ur training magic then it isnt worth to just sit and alch. do ur best money maker and then start tele alching
---
Because it was supposed to be a fun cosmetic silly weapon, but it turned out to be BIS for obby maulers.
---
whip controlled is absolute shit even as a main. attack and str first will significantly boost the exp rates when training defense. get an abby dagger for str or bludgeon first. controlled used to be "meta" when neither bludgeon nor abby dagger existed. 
---
Do you really think that youtube cares than an add is breaking the rules of some random game?

No.

So the only reason you use it is because you're too stubborn to change? r/suicidebywords
---
You came here to try change people's opinions anyway 
---
You should he blocking jad behind some sort of wall if rng goes in your favour. Once healers spaw  tag them all once so they aggro on you before they heal jad to full hp. Once on you run behind the boot/wall youve used to block jad pray melee and kill them all then back to jad. If jad hasnt been healed to full hp they wont respawn again
---
Just wrap the doors in vines, and you have to unlock them once (like the farming doors in dungeoneering) so you would only be able to permanently open the 85 farming door if you prune the vines at the doors, which would require you 85 farming.
---
This new barrier system is terrible.
---
if you have a  lot of money, rune legs/2h/skirts is profit, there are people smithing them so u could buy bulk. I sold mine to a friend to alch.
---
No, but I figured that maybe jagex has some sort of team that would look out for stuff like this to contact people. Though thinking about it now and the state of the “customer service” I’m not sure why I did lmao
---
Exactly, anyone looking at the graph without looking at the last year is missing the picture.  There have been a number of things requiring more blood runes, the slayer meta, new players bursting, TOB weapons, increased price of trident charges, and merching.  They needed to drop a little and will probably rebound.
---
The 73's tho, impressive
---
I remember when my gmail was hacked, it was logged in from Japan :Ooooooooooo 
---
Eloquent and well spoken. You must have the smallest wiener go outside brother or stop wasting that xp 
---
The 85 farming area must remake pure. No normies allowed.
---
Upvote because this shit needs to be at the top
---
Gratz!
---
Jatizso!
---
They kind of do. I remember Mod Stone posted something on Twitter about a team working to remove fake ads off of Facebook. But that's different, because those Facebook Ads were of people pretending to be the official OSRS page, giving phishing links that said "Get access to osrs mobile BETA" or some shit like that. 
---
But anyway, your best bet is to tweet @JagexSupport and tell them to have a look
---
I've never received any emails on that account from Jagex or RuneScape so I've gone and done exactly that and just went through the recovery process and am now waiting on their reply.. Assuming I should give them 48hrs on this and hopefully get an email of sorts
---
Don't worry! I'm here to upvote you!
---
There's probably more reasons, but "the defense bonus is the *exclusive* reason primordials are expensive" wasn't the argument I was trying to make, just postulating that it was a relevant factor.
---
I'll counter your question with an additional one though; if there were a version of boots that had the same strength bonus as primordials without the defense, do you think they'd still be 30m? Do you have an alternative analysis as to why you think the gloves are only 8m?
---
The fundamental value of the gloves I think comes from how much people want them, which is derived from factors such as rarity, and utility; and their rarity is fairly comparable. Primordials are strictly better than dragon boots, where as there's a trade-off between Barrows Gloves and Ferocious Gloves. I'm not really deciding that the defense is what makes Barrows Gloves (or Primordials) worth it, only using it as the potential explanation as to why the gloves are 8m instead of 30m when the difference between the two comparisons is the defense bonus.
---
Does that sufficiently articulate my perspective?
---
With a slayer task? Probably.
---
Not super easily though, might take a long time. 
---
Extraordinarily more difficult to contextualise but I applaud your knowledge and application of RWT methodologies. However, even scalping does NOT guarantee profit - however, it certainly does meet the time criteria.
---
Or bursting dust devils to ~break even and get decent xp
---
Because we don't use text authentication, I'd reckon it's a lot harder to break Google authenticator than text messages

just leave a rake at the leper

You can change your character to female and watch her mine while you play with the trouser snek.

Disgusting
---
Hey thats not too bad! Saw someone posted something like this about 6 months ago, he had 3.2k torstol potions (unf) 
---
Vork is easier than zulrah for the grind? I’m considering switching to zulrah cause I can dump this stupid fucking dhcb and start up zulrah for only like 12 mill
---
i guess thats what happens when you are 640kc dry at vorkath
---
I want to add this as a togglable feature. I just sadly had no time to do it when I added the Farming Guild teleport.
---
It ain't a quick job, but hopefully will find time to look at it at some stage soon.
---
Depends on the girlfriend.
---
A lot of people dont, that's why looters exist. If people are going to leave stuff on the ground why not pick it up.
---
Congrats. I hope I'll do my 1st jad soon
---
Your post history HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
It's not user error. Just go to the farming guild and look at how it functions. It will be fixed. 
---
Very important to make sure your accounts are secured with 2fa, including your email!
---
Most importantly it's important to __REMOVE AND DELETE__ old accounts you no longer use. For example Zybez recently closed but you can still login to accounts there (Curse.com). Most websites you can login and see the FULL email address, IPs you used, and other useful information to compromise you.
---
Neitiznot!

I fell for the w325 raids1 pre-scouted scam before. im just an idiot, and i blame myself.

I went to their world in their cc and thought they had a good raid ready.

---
A lot of people have been doing Blast Furnace which brings a lot of steel bars into the game.

*as he does, ya dumb broad. no wonder he's ignoring you
---
Amazing. I'm trying to level up my slayer (only level 24 right now) and it's slow as hell.
---
Just start working on reqs for all quests. It’ll give you a goal and a variety of training
---
Thank you!!!!!!!!!
---
Cunts that pull trade scams, I love to go along with it right until second trade window then just sit there not accepting and ask some questions/chat to bait them along. Some will just sit there for minutes.
---
Yeah, it's slow at first, speeds up around 65, then slows down again around 80-85. I suggest swapping to Konar as soon as possible to get money out of the low level slayer grind, at least.
---
Turn on gpu

Craw's bow and chainmace can be used anywhere in the wilderness for the multitude of different content that exists there. It's completely different to weapons or armor that can literally only be used on task. Also they are balanced in a way that they are the absolute best weapons to use in the wilderness for pvm, but at an extra risk of ether. There is no such risk as this outside of the wilderness so any gear for slayer only that was bis would be a straight up boost in slayer xp for no risk or cost.
---
It's such a shame it was nerfed. I would have loved to see the potential there. Jagex the pures community needs some love!
---
What the fuck. 
---
I think you're on to something there genius.
---
At that point why even have the northern wall of the GE?  If you keep adding shortcuts and transportation nodes to an area, it devalues each of them.

Entering a password you actually use anywhere is retarded, but the website is run by a guy named Troy Hunt who(last I heard) is pretty well regarded in network security and IT circles.

Did you just say the fucking GE wall will be devalued? LMAO

So you're saying the players who put more time/effort in shouldnt be better than you?

Not OP, but I have experience with this:
---
#Precautions
---
- Don't make your email the same as your username.  
---
&gt;  Example: Usernmame: BigDick69 should not be using the email: BigDick69@gmail.com
---
- User a different email for login and account details.  Jagex gives you the option to use 2 different emails which seems a lot of people don't take advantage of.
---
- 2FA on everything if available.
---
- Never lick shortened links.  
---
&gt;"Bit.ly" 
---
- Never click Runescape related links that aren't on the runescape site.  If you see an offer for something runesape related, you'll 100% find it on the Runescape site itself being promoted.
---
- Use a password generator.
---
- Don't use the same password on every site you login to.  Deviate everywhere.  Password saving isn't just for convenience, but it enables convenient security by combining it with password generators.
---
- Don't post progress pictures featuring Hans that showcase your account creation date.
---
- Don't use free public wifi without knowing its' association.
---
# Jagex
---
Outside of data breaches / rogue mods, Jagex's security is perfectly reasonable.
---
People completely exaggerate how easy it is to recover an account even with loose info.
---
&gt;Back in 2017 some guy even offered a challenge with a 100mil reward to anyone who could hack his account: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5x02bz/come_hack_my_account_for_100mil/
---
TL;DR?  No one was successful, even with a previous email and password provided.
---
Outside of a data breach or second coming of Mod Jed, the only way someone is going to access your account via Account Recovery is if you give them your information yourself.
---

City / Town | I can look up available ISP's in that area and drastically limit available choices through process of elimination.  No one needs to know your approximate location as detailed as a city.  
---
ISP | Especially if it's not as big as Time Warner.  I can approximate a location based on ISP alone.
---
I never understand why there was a mute for cussing if there’s a toggleable profanity filter. 
---
Wear the god robes + mitre instead. I forget your stats and can’t seem to find out how to get to your original comment on mobile, but if you’re 70 def, use a veracs skirt, god d hide chest, and mitre. You can also use the explorers ring from lumbridge easy diary which gives a +1 prayer bonus. I believe if you get 44 prayer as well your ppots will restore 1 more.

---
Well I know that Matthew and perhaps other devs for osbuddy are in contact with the team at runelite and has for a while now. This whole idea of OSB VS Runelite is just typical online bull shit. OSB wants and needs RuneLite to be successful as does RuneLite needs OSB. Without that competition they become stale. I know that since Runelite has been more mainstream OSB has been better at getting problems fixed and being more active with the community.

I find grinding agility surprisingly easy personally. I always end up grinding into the 70s early on. Mind you, getting my graceful set got me to almost 74 because I quested the early levels and didn't camp at Canifis from 47 :|.

As many worlds as there are that very well could be close to a realistic number. With over 100,000 people playing at one given time. It was a decent starting place to get people visualizing the change it actually has on the economy.

Osrs team out smoothing hills while active poll results are still visible (failed 3 times after being polled) and the security team of jagex still hasn't implemented 2fa removal delay.

Wait did they nerf the drop rate?

Well that’s enough for one day good night 
---
I respect the feel and wish you luck. Friends and I did 40 raids and got 3 dragon harpoons. That was the end of that. I went back a year later with one friend and in 70-90 raids got dragon sword, dragon claws, ancestral hat and leg, and 3 dex scrolls.

That said, all the portals (or nexus), garden right next to teleport in with pool being next to where you saw,  jewelry box situated in the room directly next to the pool in the adjacent room. Spirit tree fairy ring and occult altar are really the only other necessities.

Started my account 1 year 2 months ago and got quest cape ASAP (with diaries for max xp). I used optimal quest guide and leveled up rc to around 60 mostly with fossil island fossil experience at the museum it’s like 140k total. I can complete all the elite diaries still which is 600k rc xp but right now I’m at 71. Biggest regret is not doing all the museum fossil island steps sooner to get more out of tears I get 12-13k from around 5k for a while in 40s without runelite and not many quests gl friend

So everyone seems to really love farming contracts, and the guild in general. We've been down the Artisan road before, and sadly didn't get to see it.
---
But what are the chances of a guild revamp in the future that adds contracts to existing guilds? Sort of splits the difference, and adds Artisan without adding a new skill?
---
Slayer, specifically Konar, and the farming guild has proven that varied content is engaging content to a large portion of the playerbase. And that content can have its place without replacing the best xp/hr methods

No
---
... He added pretty thorough explanations of the utility of each shortcut, and I feel many of them are valid and would give the grapple some expanded utility (something that the devs already want to do, since they added observatory).  
---
Also, shilo to nature (even if it was gated behind like 90 agi) would actually dumpster the nature runes market (and probably other runes with it), and as such should and would never be added.  If your idea of valid shortcuts is one that break the game, then no, I guess this guys suggestion isn't what you're looking for.
---
Why’s that
---
This is so simple yet so smart
---
What's even spookier is looking through these comments and then the history of the commenters.

I mean it should be in the base game to be perfectly fair. In fact I don’t see a reason why it isn’t other than maybe it being easier to do via a 3rd party client than firsthand.

&gt;The fact you think that 90 something upvotes means something is a good idea is actually hilarious.

What's actually hilarious is that you think that anyone that disagrees with you is insane, which is what you're suggesting.  You don't sound like you have a lot of friends.

[CML currently put the number at 1559 hours.](https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/suppliescalc.php) But that is quite unrealistic, and even the most efficient players won't be able to do that.

I like this idea and want to further it with my input:
---
Altars are built similar to portals, requiring 100x the specific talisman AND 10,000x the runes
---
Only one can be built per POH at a time
---
They are degradable but can be repaired with runes (otherwise they would be OP as FUCK and shit all over the economy)
---
Basically there has to be some kind of deterrent to keep runes (especially nature runes) from crashing. 
---
I've gotten a chromebook for $88 off of ebay. It was refurbished but I could browse internet and everything, only difficult thing is that it's a chromebook and last I remember you have to install some stuff to get to boot up ubuntu which will allow you to run osrs. There is a couple guides on YouTube that can give you the step by step. It was also refurbished but factory certified.

I wouldn't even have to consider quitting because jagex would crumble under the pressure in like a day and revert it.

Nats crashing was the main one. I won’t go into detail about how the effects can be detrimental to the economy, because my reasoning is purely subjective.
---
With regards to combat runes, I expect one of two outcomes -
---
1. mid level money making methods that involve runes such as barrows and runecrafting will become LESS profitable, while high level bossing becomes more so. This furthers the gap between the rich and the poor.
---
2. Runecrafting becomes MORE profitable, and becomes the money making meta forcing other important methods extinct. Imagine if BP and scales were twice as expensive. That would make late game inaccessible for poor players, again furthering the gap.
---
I think it’s important to consider the effect on the OSRS economy.
---
Well fuck you, now that shit will bother me for an enternity

I was reading up on some old threads about this the other day. One person suggested using the BGS spec on accurate style. Not sure if this is any better but it could be worth a look.

You could try bringing a warrior ring(i) to help with accuracy too. Most people bring a zerker ring but hitting higher aint much use if you can't hit at all...

For what?
---
This guide is build from my own experience of being hacked via. account recovery several times (bypassing all secure measures that exist) and researching how this is possible. This is to spread awareness on how pessimistic this can be, since there is literally nothing compromised logins can do to secure themselves further once they have been breached once.
---
Have access to database breaches, billions of e-mail address/password/name combos are open source. https://haveibeenpwned.com
---
Find a victim’s e-mail address that is used as a login. E.g. searching reddit posts of a user and their linking to other accs/services. A wide enough search of this will turn up several viable logins. Alternatively you can brute force likely e-mails from database breaches to see if any are used as logins (this is easily checked via. Jagex’s recovery system).
---
Use database breaches to find old passwords used. Even though most people will have unique passwords NOW, in the past they likely will not have (especially high-profile accounts, which are often old and created before account security was a forefront concern. So often are created using main e-mail addresses and had a shared password in the past.
---
Same breaches often contain location data (LinkedIn had a huge breach years ago for example, meaning any RS accounts using the same email addresses as these have this data readily available now), you can google where said email addresses have been used, or simply get the victim to go to any link you host. The IP gives enough information to identify country.
---
Make an educated guess on recovery info. E.g. only a few major ISP’s exist, start with the largest one. CML can be used to estimate the age of the account (exact age not needed anyway, especially for high value, older accounts).
---
Other information can be deduced with educated guesses. E.g. looking up social media trail on whether or not victim moved house (probably not), can assume an acccount bought bonds at some point (easily socially engineered anyway).
---
Spoof the victims IP address via. VPN.
---
Submit recovery requests via brute force. Jagex doesn’t notify them of unsuccessful requests anyway.
---
When you get a successful recover request then change the registered e-mail to very similar e-mail (same 1st few characters, almost identical length, don’t use exactly the same length as his seems to throw red flags for recovery). This will confuse the victim since it will appear that their e-mail address is still registered to the account.
---
If their account has 2fa on it, then simply insta-disable it, since the e-mail is now registered to yours.
---
If successful, clear inventory and bank, or attempt to brute force bank pin (1/10000 chance with multiple attempts for a few tries, if the drop is worth 1b+ then it’s worth trying).
---
If brute force pin attempts fail then place authenticator on the account.
---
Attempt to phish the bank pin by sending bogus “account recovery denied” e-mails with fake (and convincing) links. This can be automated to send whenever he victim tried to reset his password (since you will receive an e-mail from Jagex if the attempt, which is your queue to forward this).
---
Repeat for as many accounts as possible.
---

No, you need the slayer level to kill the monster.

I agree, I must look like Shrek to them. And you know... it was ogre since the beginning.

You can't damage them without the proper level, but you can boost it with wild pies if you are close. 
---
Thanks dude, I'll give it a shot. :) 
---
Stay positive. We are all deserving of love and respect.
---
I personally did wilderness slayer to 75. Now that konar is out I use that master (req 75 combat). Other then that, maybe nieve with 85 cb. not sure which would be better. Takes a while to get to the good tasks, but so worth it when you finally do get there.
---
Might depend if you havent done some quests first idk make sure to check the quest rewards for def xp
---
Sick account man. If I were you I’d do some quests then some bosses. Watch YouTube vids on how to do it. Skilling in the game is completely pointless. 
---
&gt;pmods friend verbally abuses, let's it slide
---
&gt;No need for verbal abuse in this game.
---
&gt;Sounds like a good pmod
---
Are you slow or something
---
Yeah I agree that using the spec on a non-boss dragon would be pretty useless.
---
My original idea was to power up the weapon for 10 seconds after you do the spec, so the bonus goes from 20% to 35%. I doubt they'd be able to implement it without *engine work* so I scrapped it.
---
No..no, you're wrong.

I just finished 100 molch pearls and grabbed my pearl fishing rod.  A little bit disappointed, though. I was hoping to make it an oily pearl fishing rod as the blog post said we would be able to do.  However, it does not work. You do get a customized error, your character will say "I probably don't want to oil this rod up..." Boy, is he wrong.
---
I might try to report as a bug or something. Was really looking forward to using this baby on infernal eels.
---
Even if they ban them though it doesn't make a difference. They should just disable the fountain there
---
This is engine work, not even memeing you.
---
Any links you may have clicked or anything downloaded? If not, probably looking foul play.
---
If you haven't changed your password or pin on a semi-regularly basis, then that increases the risk IMO. Though that would still leave the pin as an unbreakable thing since it changes every time, which would only leave RAT's
---
Cool thanks man. Im mostly interested in bossing/pking aswell.

You won't be seeing good money until 70+, the higher the level, the better Slayer becomes. Out of the skills, it's probably the best money maker barring maybe RuneCrafting. Another benefit to Slayer is that you train combat with it, and there's plenty of opportunity to train all skills as some monsters are better to be killed with ranged, others with melee etc.
---
And by training combat, you'll get access to the best money makers which are raids and bosses. 
---
What part of the quest are you talking about? The rotten apple?
---
Okay first if all my sexual identity is NOT a hunter training method

You need al the reqs for his sub quest, not all the reqs for legends quest because you only have to do 1% of legends quest(where you obtain the map thingy).

Rock/sand crabs then!

I spent about an hour making a rough autoclicker with a range for min and max interval between clicks and made an alt to see if I’d get banned. Currently sitting at 21m magic xp.

Although random functions in computing are only pseudo random it’s still enough to be believable as human interaction. And any kind of botting detection to determine if the pseudo randomness is computed is a lot more advanced than anything I imagine jagex is running
---
Correct, the event RPG exists, and its dirt cheap and available instantly. The rare fish is not, and should remain a cosmetic item not a niche item for a PvP build. You're the one saying your priorities are the most important and should be designed for.
---
Yup. The idea is your killing someone, not that they're fighting back.
---
I've heard some girls refer to their friend as girlfriend so maybe she's just really good friends with step sister.

As long as Netflix has Trailer Park Boys on it, I'll keep my subscription.

Yeah that sounds pretty good, might require a bit of engine work to change the colors though. Don't know if any other weapon does that.

I'd trade you some stuff to rebuild, but I'm an ironman.

Jep, easy way to get a maxed melee account.

No ones said it? Get good bro!
---
Yeah it sounds super fun. I'm a bit lower than you at combat level 57 but my pray is 51 and Mage is 59. My range is 45, def is 43 and str/atk are both 45.

In-game is 13utts. I used to play a lot in 2004-2007. Started playing a bit after Runefest 2018 and downloaded mobile, only play mobile now if you don't mind (no computer with wifi but unlimited data plan)

Moving around the farming guild feels so clunky now. I don't know how the developers could come up with this and go, "yup, this'll do".

Bandos kc takes less than 5 minutes to get. And to any higher lvl that knows they can out dps you, you just look like an assistant for then to use to get more kills during their own trip. Sucks, but your only option is to train your CB stats higher. If people will struggle to out dps you, they won't bother crashing. As far as expecting jagex to change anything, that's not going to happen. If you want to do gwd at a low level, sara or arma are better options, as the kc takes longer to get and people dont usually waste time crashing. 
---
What's a jad practice tool?

Should this not be “TzClock-Jad”?

A. Even if it was his step sister, that would still be weird, but wouldn't be incest since there's no blood/dna relation.

B. Doubtful that's even the even, it's either a joke, or they mean it as a friend, that is a girl which happens to be his (step sister) and everyone is just being too immature to just appreciate the post itself instead of the title :\
---
still can keep 3 gloves/3 torchs coz u cant get them again once u have 3 of them they end up changed to torstol/mage seeds when u roll them again doesnt discount gettin these types of seeds without having 3 either just an addition

I’ve got this quest to do tomorrow. I remember it being one of my least favorite back in the day

So one t bow

Seed box is great with herb sack for slayer. Chuck in a gem bag and you're great.

Nty range is op as is.

OK I'll find it and buy it

I'm pretty sure that jagex is monitoring runelite and will request plugins to be removed if they don't want it there, just like they did with the zulrah helper.
---
That's the name? 
---
What about like a little bridge that you have to click over? That functions like a staircase?
---
That would be really stupid if Jagex did that.

That’s awesome to hear, thanks!

Use the whistle on your equipment and nieve should appear
---
2 pets and a tail?
---
yes, you roll for each fish separately, highest level first. so you only roll for the lowest level one when the first two fish both miss.
---
this is u OP
---
Pretty sure stop rate is 50/50
---
Now do nieve
---
if it takes you longer than one full pattern zulrah will enter a rogue phase during the next pattern at about the 4th phase. during this rogue phase its best to hide behind a pillar until it ends.

Whats the name of the lvl 73 skill again. I can't remember what its called?

I'd like to imagine Ash drinks ayahuasca tea.

Nah it's not low/mid level content, it's not going to get a nerf.

You actually get 3 per day for hard, which is pretty decent
---
Hmm, I'm not really sure I can afford a blowpipe, but I just got Iban's staff today and I'm hoping to also learn how to do Barrows in the near future, so if I can manage to get that down then it should help solve that problem.

They already said that there is no way to tell what type of contracts you have completed only the total number.

Are we sure nests are fixed? i had 3k left because I stopped opening them when the post came about no chance getting new seeds because it was broken, I have opened another 1k and got 0 new seeds? don't tell me that it wont give me them because i got the nests before the update that fixed the boxes...if so thats a joke and another gp loss for me due to this update.

I've used the mith grapple several times on treasure trails.  OP says he'd use them for this.  So would the hundred or so people who upvoted this/commented their support.  Just because you can't see a reason to do something doesn't mean no one else does, princess.

89 combat with 99 range and 50 def. I’d love to practice on mobile. Duel arena it something. 
---
Repost for like the 10th time.
---
Cetain tasks can get you a lot of money, especially once you unlock bosses. Smoke devils are the first decently profitable task at 65 slayer. Kurask are next at 70. Wyverns at 72. Gargoyles at 75. Brutal black dragons at 77. Nechryaels at 80. Krakens at 87. Cerb at 91. Hydra at 95. Those are some of the main ones. Up until then slayer is pretty bad for straight profit. The main thing is you are making money while getting pretty good combat exp. Like most things in this game the good stuff isnt available till you grind to it. And for most people 150k/hr slaying is more fun than 500k/hr doing nature runes. Just keep the grind up and you’ll get there eventually. 
---
You’ll come to learn through time of playing this game that, the possibility of things are endless. From getting your first pet (as you so have) to trying to get that damn dragon defender (you know who you are). In the end it’s 50/50, you either get it or you don’t
---
They'll cut off your balls
---
Robin that logic is so annoying. Well it's not actually logic, considering most of the player base is of college age or slightly older. It's not too difficult to log significant amounts of play time in that period of one's life. Not to mention that settled is either a senior in Hs or a college freshman. Lol. He managed to entertain thousands of people, make money and have fun with it. I don't really like writing long defensive replies to idiots online but based on your comment history you're kind of a dick. And I hope in the future people will disregard your opinion on this sub. 
---
Agreed, I liked the old one not taking up your screen
---
I swear down, i don’t even play the game anymore, but some of the memes i’ve seen here are some S tier quality memes, that one where Mod ash asks “whats the drop rate on your panties” sent me to the stratosphere
---
Bandos is a nice example. The Boss is so overly crowded. People arent crashing to be dicks. Sure some or even most of the are dicks, but theyre not dicks or crashing. If someone hops 25 worlds, and 24 of those had level 125s in them and one had u, a level 100, then ur the obvious choise. If u cant take part in content because of ur level, then maybe the content is too high for ur level. Sure ur able to kill it, but obviously ur acc isnt ready for bandos if u cant even do more than one kill a trip, even if this is caused by competitie rather than the difficulty of said content. 
---
Dont be a retard, fkn complaining on reddit to make urself even weaker than u allready are. Pathetic little spastic. Get good or log out

Scam usually goes in the way that they'll buy it and mention that their gp is on their alt in Camelot, so offers to give them a teletab to go straight there, the person forgets hat is in trade and accepts it

It was my turn to post this this week :(

Something can be done. Its called getting ur stats up

Elite void = 68

Ah didn't see it sense it's not inside the dairy ring. Just used to that I guess.

Btw

Slayer.

Overall just best in slot equipment that you can afford. Scimitar, eventually whip. Work on getting bandos gloves, fighter torso, fire cape. For range shortbows, unless high defence enemies then crossbow. Work on getting ava's devices.

At least its a good pet. I got 3 at the same total level but they are all hideous and sit in the bank.

What a fantastic video, GJ dude!

Til you blow 50k bones and still have no pet :/

Yeah

what if aliens actually visited earth like some people believe and gave us something that might look like steel but is actually the strongest thing in both of our worlds way stronger than rune or dragon

Hehe dicks

I love his new series but I honestly like his normal UIM series more because it got me interested in the game mode.

With just clicking in the same spot? Id love to see a video.

This is my account and no it's not. I don't really have time to play the game anymore and just wanted to max at abbys when I can lol

Yep.. you use the pressure plates

Eyyy he is still here

Hey man, what decided you to do blessed dhide rather than void? Going for my first few attempts at jad tomorrow, gotta get some info.

I hate getting 1 ticked by weeds

You can reduce CPU usage with FPS limiter (set it to like 30, no difference between 50 and 30 really). For the CPU usage issue, Java usually really sucks on Macs for some reason, unfortunately

I'm happy to get so many replys. I'll be on pretty much all day tommarow, I will add everyone who dropped their rsn (:

The joke is that RuneScape players don't have girlfriend so when some post is titled with "my girlfriend made this for me", we comment that's nice of your sister. I'm fun at parties btw.
---
Gotchu brother 
---
No, they didn't work for me.
---
Maybe he just really... really likes to watch agility 
---
Fyi theres a rl script that does exactly that. It's not allowed in the public repo though because jmods said it's too OP.
---
That’s a semi valid reason. Thanks
---
Blocking attacks is only acceptable when deep wilderness pking. If I do that in a pvp world everyone's gonna call me a cunt and no one's gonna want to fight me lol
---
I’ve seen a Ford Focus with the plates zezima in Frankston lol
---
I'm used to it by now but I think I have a problem on my end cause I actually get kicked out of the game and get an error when I try to log in then it says my account is logged in. Happens once every hour or so
---
Sure but semi valid? Void can get you started in pvp, pvm , Corp, raids1/2. You need the farmin lvls trust me

I have normal void. How much of an upgrade is elite?

how do u do that thing where u copy someone's piece of text in light grey so u can reply to a specific part

Lol thanks stranger, a sleepy mind is not a smart mind.
---
Being BiS at rune drags isnt exactly a strong sell point, its a piece of content that a small percentage of people literally just AFK. And its not just a little worse than DHCB at Vork, ive got over 2500 vork KC and the only way it can consistently come close to competing with DHCB is if you get some good BGS specs while the DHCB still does more DPS most of the time WITHOUT needing that spec. If the weapon was so good, why is it so dependent on BGS spec to even compete on boss content when its counterpart doesnt need to and has the benefit of being a ranged weapon on top of that which will lead to better DPS by default regardless of the fact its simply more pure dps too. 
---
I dont think it should be better than scythe on Olm (although that would be literally the ONLY PvM content it would be better than, and it wouldnt be by much while scythe is still BiS everywhere else so its not like it would really be devalued) but that doenst mean its not underwhelming other places. Im surprised youd be so against it being a little bit better on one single boss that is the only type of mob it is even viable on when we have things like the BP that is near BiS (usually only out dps'd by t-bow) on everything for a mere 6m. 
---
Ive used it, and have had it since a day after release...outside of Olm its not anything amazing like how DHCB is and DHCB is a good deal better on most things. Melee weapons NEED to do slightly higher base DPS by design because of the major advantage ranged weapons have on survivability, mobility and therefore actual DPS when mechanics are involved otherwise ranged will continue to dominate this entire game. And the fact it NEEDS to have DHW spec on content to even make it comparable to DHCB (and BP on certain things i.e Hydra) just literally proves the opposite of what youre saying, if it was actually OP and didnt need improvements outside of Olm (where it still needs DHW spec btw) then it wouldnt so heavily depend on having another weapons spec. 
---
Usually when Jerryanthrax asks us to report bugs, I usually keep in mind to only report ones worth their time to fix.
---
No , even though every other weapon in game rolls to decide if you hit or not the ballista doesnt work against karils+dihns thus you will never ever be hit.
---
"Its usually a 6 month wait for approval."
---
"I play OSRS."
---
"Right this way sir."
---
its like osrs wants to be more like rs3
---
Did you boost for elite diaries?
---
"You have fallen as a Hardcore Iron Man, your Hardcore status has been revoked."
---
Thanks man. Long way to go yet. Kinda wish I made a Zerk though. Had a maxed tank in rs2, never made a zerk. Next time haha
---
Drastically better. The prayer bonus helps a fuck ton when doing actual pvm like vorkath, raids, corp, etc. 
---
But regardless, every skill you should thrive to hit 99 in.
---
Ah of course. The real solution.
---
That’s awesome. I’m someone just coming back. Where in the game do you go to see the breakdown of your task like that with the KC and all
---
New slayer master is fun. 
---
421? FUCK SAKE

Don’t be demotivated! I had shit luck with bosses before I started killing gorillas. You’ll find Lady Luck smiling when you start hitting dem drop tables.
---
I think /u/Gluby3 was referring to 'locking' your account so that it can't ever be recovered. So if you forgot your pass and can't get into the email you had no chance to get back on the acc.
---
Iirc they did that for some streamer, but was a few years ago, so not sure what their name would have been.

Why did I almost legitimately shed tears at the end of this video? Awesome man. Absolutely awesome.

It is the path from Lumbridge to Draynor Village. Pretty sure that's a path of some sort.

---
Makes sense, thanks bro
---
She got slayer wrong.
---
I did boost. Got varrock and lumb elite 
---
I'd probably quit. Just for the agility and fishing spots alone.
---
Like it or not, CoX is one of the most popular pieces of content in the game so the weapon needs to be balanced around that. A good compromise is to reduce the stab defence of vork and hydra. It’s stupidly cheap atm for how good it is at raids
---
It's being merched a ton while the the item still goes through balancing tweaks by the devs
---
i don't know what is it there is just something so pure we can really trust his dedication. Others area restricted UIMs have all the conditiona on which they can leave yet there is settled who refused to do ghost ahoy just to stay true to the grind

Decant jewelry with the ‚runes‘ guy at the GE. 
---
Your bank should look like ‚full charged/using/empt‘ rather than 8/7/6.. ect
---
&gt; I just don’t think the damage modifier needs a buff
---
Well yeah it doesnt need a buff at Olm but, its tough to make it less underwhelming other places without touching the damage modifier and removing the requirement that it needs a DWH spec currently to even compete with DHCB/BP on things. If there was something tied to the spec of the weapon it would likely create a big problem with consistency and not have a terribly big impact on overall DPS. 
---
Oof my bones

I was on mobile and got my angler's outfit out the bank forgot I was on click to drop..... Dropped my anglers and teleported away..... Only noticed like 20 mins later

Do you have a step sister as well?

Just seen another comment on reddit saying you can open your ornate jewelry box and type the letter reference to Tele instead of tapping it. Thought mobile made that harder until now.

How do you access the collection log?
---
I got a lava dragon task, but I was wondering whether mage bonus is negligible on them. I was wearing d’hide and still had +20-ish mage bonus and like 120+ mage defence (in case pkers rush and barrage me).
---
So am I good camping d’hide?
---
Use a knife on them to cut away the paper
---
Had one aswell and only minions counted
---
But why is it so dark? I can't even see some of the items. 
---
Is there a DH str method using a house? The method I know is using dclaws/d2h with spec-transfer. You can do that on any world, though.

Ur gonna be able to trade it for 100 molchs which is a piece of angler so its pretty good if u dont have angler

You do understand that the word "million" and its derivatives are not always referencing the six million Jews right?

Total level is irrelevant when you’re under level 80 in any of the skills that actually give pets (besides farming)

Nice.

Excellent at everything? A melee weapon specifically for killing DRAGONS shouldn't be good at killing DRAGONS? You say not every weapon coming into the game should be best for everything, but want to keep the same weapons that are already best at everything, best everywhere and not give a chance to niche items.
---
Personally I play in bouts: I’ll get burnt out and sometimes not play for multiple months. In that time I have absolutely no desire to play, but eventually the urge always comes back somehow. If you’re feeling burnt out, my advice would be to listen to that feeling and just do something else for a while and see if you enjoy it - there’s no use in banging your head against the wall because you feel obliged to play! 
---
Beside that though, my main motivation to play comes from constantly setting and reaching targets; there’s always a bit of a void when I actually hit a target and realise the journey was half the enjoyment 
---
You assume my gender and assume I'm still using my childhood username. You assume a lot and this is probably one of your biggest faults in life. My username on reddit is named after my old wow character that no longer has that name as I've grown in the last 15 years maybe you should try some personal growth.

I can’t do it I’ve done it too many times. Your butt is taught yet malleable.

Should use castle room spawn area doors
---
I would argue its easier to get to where u can do raids then it is to get 95 slayer.  Raids 1 isnt much harder than the hydra boss tbh, all the bosses are pretty easy after you've done like 5 kc.

woosh

No worries, I'll hopefully stumble across it that sounds like hell doing that

Damn. I'm closing in on 1500 with three pets. Now I know why everyone hates me.
---
hey thanks, I do commissions if you are interested ;3
---
It is already good at killing dragons and insanely good at olm, so I don't see why you're complaining. Making 1/1000 slayer boss weapon that will ultimately go to 40-50m the ultimate bis at every dragon makes absolutely no fucking sense.
---
I only ask cause I think I’ve seen skillers with them and they have no attack level.
---
How long did it take?
---
You doubt it, yet people can and do get hacked through reddit post history. A lot of people don't have the conscious thought that a reddit account is to whatever degree you decide; a public insight into your thoughts and interests spanning back as long as you've been posting. A lot of seemingly irrelevant things can amount to a surprising amount of information about someone. 
---
Ah, thanks for filling me in
---
On the current poll they're hinting to a seed bank in the Farming guild which should alleviate the amount of seeds taking up space in your bank.

Yes, hes 80 slayer because he enjoys other things more. How hard is that to understand? The only trash thing here is your intelligence. Can you be any more of an autist?
---
atleast 3 hours
---
I've almost exclusively used mobile since release,  I would use my computer if it worked, but mobile is a great alternative. There's only a few things I truly miss about runelite, I.E  drops appearing on the screen and bank value
---
Old but gold I guess😒

That’ll cost you $7.99

Actually LOL'd. Truly a sick world we live in
---
hey, I am on artstation as Leander Kiers, I havnt posted too much though :) It is mostly portraits aswell ^^
---
Me and my cousins did the same thing.  We were less organized and you would have little 5-8 year olds sort of larping just swinging sticks at imaginary enemies and eachother for in the "wildy" (the woods behind the house lmao).  
---
When we'd get a "kill", we'd just scream an arbitrary amount of xp we earned lmao.
---
The only disadvantage it gives you is at vorkath, because he melees you. You also don't normally dhcb rune dragons or olms melee hand, so yeah it doesn't really put you into too much of an disadvantage.
---
No matter how many times this gets reposted it's still too relatable. 
---
It seems really hard to attack and tele on the same tick constantly for as long as that's going on.

For anyone having issues with getting into the jungle (route wise) see;
---
 The easiest way to enter the jungle coming from Shilo Village is to stand north of the bush just south of the village entrance. All it requires is to cut 2 bushes in front to enter the jungle. Players may also use two vines on either side of the jungle that require 79 agility to pass. 
---
Yeah, I hate when people try to pull ajlquixk switch in the trade window irl
---
I probably wouldn’t stay because even back in the day i used to think “this is missing something but i dunno what” then when i started using RL all the QoL things just made life so much easier and it clicked “this is what it was missing”. Probably gonna get shit for saying that but idc. I’m a grown ass man with shit to do so to have some nice farming timers and shit like that is great.

You can use any tool as long as you have the required Skilling level. You only need the att level to equip them.

1/384 for specifically either a helm/acp/acs, you roll each per kill so it’s 3/384 for any arma specific item = 1/128. Same for bcp/tassets/boots, all are 1/384 and therefore 3/384 (1/128) for any specific bandos armour piece. The drop rates are the same for bandos and arma, but arma is more expensive gear.

Just found his channel and series yesterday, powered through all his swampletics videos in 1 sitting ( and I watched in 1x speed not 2x because I was enjoying it so much - thats a pretty good compliment)

Right click on the inventory icon and select "Save Shift-Click"
---
Yeah, there's the possibility - there's also the possibility that if he asks Mod Ash on Twitter, Ash will add a new item that gives him a bond every time he clicks it.
---
But we don't just pretend like that sort of edge-case is realistic.
---
Yeah , my bad I was thinking bandos was 1/128 for a specific item.

Its probably the best time to get back into the game honestly.

I wonder how bosses get noted stuff anyways, do they take it out of their bank?

Thank you,  this made my day.

My back hurts from watching this
---
had to flex the stats real quick 
---
Because the boss variation is the only option for those creatures in those locations. 
---
Basically, if Konar assigned blue dragon on Ungael then your only choice would be to do vorkath. That would be a bit unfair to people that don't have the stats, gear, or inclination to kill bosses, but still wish to do slayer.

I guess nobody saw the stream so if you wanna link a clip. we can enjoy whatever your talking about.

Do I use stab for obsidian sword or slash? It looks like the lunge (strength - stab) would be the best because the sword has the highest stab attack stat?

I understand your logic, but the authentic feel does not necessarily make it the most user friendly. But I respect your opinion for sure. I think a lot of Runelites plugins are OP, but a lot are also there to make the interface more user friendly. It's a tough choice.

Lol you do understand that this is obviously not a properly balanced idea right? The overall idea would be good if balanced right. Even a simple max fee on more expensive items like that.

---
why are more gold sinks better? thats what hes asking. what does "balancing the economy" even mean? 
---
Long term item surplus is far more of an issue than gp, gp just gets consolidated in the duel arena and leaves via staking tax, rwt bans, goldfarmer bans etc.

40 ping doesn't really mean a lot more than your click would registered later than others by just barely. A tick is 600ms. So unless he's reacting in the last 40ms of 600ms it's not a huge advantage. Anyone with a stable 100-200 could flick bandos easily with practice.

I wanna know where the Boss Bank is like where is it located they obviously go there when they get killed to restock 
---
buying items outside of the ge is absolutely aids, remember the 3 months where scythe was off the ge? people would legit just camp flipping alts at tob bank and never sell it unless they were making at least 50m a flip. These flippers could afford to hold the item for 10s of hours because its still an easy 2.5-5m an hour even if they only trade once a day. P2P trading without a ge would be no different, you'd just get flipped even harder as a player who didn't want to use a merch alt to buy stuff because otherwise itd take forever to get your item.

&gt;I'm wondering how he got the money for 99 pray and con with 80 slayer. I can only assume raids from the 90 herb.

I’ve fought Staking addiction for a LONG time . Truth is , you only stake cause ur bored and don’t enjoy the game . 
---
Once u enjoy the game and find fun and use out of ur items , you’ll feel less intrigued to go launch them at the arena . 
---
There are plenty vids on ytb describing what task you should block/skip depending if you are aiming on profiting from tasks or getting best xp.
---
I think you should as a new/top-level comment for everyone's benefit who see the post
---
No I honestly don't think it would be a good idea in any facet or balance.
---
We can and do make goldsinks in other places. The duel arena removes hundreds of miles daily.
---
My reasoning for not wanting to tax ge is because players shouldn't be punished for using something that was introduced to combat the complete shit show that was item trading pre ge. Spending hours to get one item, getting scammed left and right? Fuck that the ge should remain free from any reason not to use it.
---
IKR they should get sued and shut down
---
I feel like the previous ones reminded me of spined gloves that don't really cover the hand either.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Spined_gloves
---
changes like this won't really affect the underlying gambling addiction a lot of people who make suggestions like this have. Don't want to stake your valuables? then don't. Can't control your staking impulses? get actual help.
---
I agree completely that item sinks are needed way more than gold sinks, but they are also more complex to balance. Which is why I said gold sinks are the easiest to suggest/implement. 
---
Even with those happening, there is always a lot of money coming into game. Additional gold sinks leave a little more room for devs to work with drop tables. Them worrying about bringing in more gold has led to ridiculous resource drops lately.
---
Just FYI, I'm not saying this is a perfect plan, but it's sure as hell not terrible.
---
Lol it was pretty funny man. He looked anxious as fuck after he banned me lmao... I thought he was going to snap his keyboard again. 
---
Seems kinda silly that any mob would drop flax. I wish Jagex would overhaul drop tables to stop dumping mass skilling resources into the economy. A few unique pieces of equipment, pets, and gold/bones is all that should come of killing them. 
---
Guess it's better than mass noted bow strings or x2500 sara brews though. 
---
One question in this sheet, is there a way to see the NMZ stats for set 2? It only shows set 1 for me.

CML is a site that tracks xp: https://crystalmathlabs.com/tracker/
---
You would need to know the display name of the account in question. 
---
CML only refreshes when manually tell it too. Someone could have gained xp yesterday, but it won't show that until you refresh.  Because of that it's not enough to show that xp was changed at a certain time. 
---
You need two data points, one before and one after the time at which you wish to check. That how you would determine if someone was playing and gaining xp during a certain time.

Not really, i got it at level 58 so you're a bit better than average 
---
Good points brother, but this is not the only effect it could have either. It would maybe also be cool and feeling of uniqueness of items, much like the feeling of ironman gameplay, just without the countless boring grinding hours getting supplies for the fun stuff  
---
The legality of alcohol analogy is invalid though, making an option to make an item untradeable for each person is very different from making something illegal for everyone.  
---
Responsibility is fine, of course we do as we should, to some degree. But free will is an illusion in the bigger picture, you cannot account or your parents, genes etc. Would you argue that genes/heritability do not play a decently big role in addiction for example? (this is just one point about the free will illusion)

You shouldn't get banned for someone else botting on your account, when I quit for 6 years I came back and noticed my account was banned for botting, I appealed it and told jagex to check the IP of whoever accessed the account during the time of offense, and they completely removed the mark from my account and deemed it "suspicious activity". I logged back in and noticed the person botted green dragons and brought all my combat levels from 72 to 90/91 (and GE history showed he sold 240m worth of dragon bones)

By the looks of it he means elemental spells on the standard spellbook not ancients

I know they are just trying to do their part to help with the lumbridge rat population but they are doing a very terrible job at it. My cat is much better at it so I do the work for them so they can rest easy

I think it's Shaq
---
Yeah &gt;:)

PATRICK NO
---
you needed runescape to teach you a pretty basic life lesson?
---
How the fuck did you even get 2 levels per year??? Do you even have a life?
---
Maybe? Usually they are very swift for banning for botting so if you arnt now then you should be good
---
Git gud bro

I’ve had two clues in wildly and got pked both times. I don’t try to fight or run if I’m in deep and I’m losing a spade and a stamina pot. With all the content in the game if someone is choosing to kill bare ass players doing random shit just because they can then they’re losers. Real Pvp and pvm is too hard for those players but I guess it’s all fair. 
---
Why isn't it reasonable to kill skillers or clue chasers for practice? 
---
That makes for an interesting idea. A difficult boss that collects items from the people it kills into a ‘pot’ and then drops them when killed. Unfortunately i think it would be too difficult to implement
---
Go back to rs3
---
Good points, I have found myself feeling this too brother.

Oh shit! Thank you!

In order to hunt blacks you gotta be black

High level players who play the game 16 hours a day will be online more than little jimbo who just got 1200 total, meaning the percentage of people online who can rc bloods will be bigger than the total percentage of people who can do bloods.

Idk what’s the point of this post if you didn’t have 2FA or a bank pin. You clearly didn’t take the steps to secure your account so why make a Reddit post if you already know what you did wrong? Recover the account and secure it.
---
I agree. B ring isn’t doing much for you for two specs. It’s more useful for when you’re actually training.
---
What this sheet is mostly telling me is that most training methods are within ~3k xp/hour of each other, but boss selection can alter xp/hour by up to 10k/hour, so boss selection is far more important than gearing.
---
/me_irl

I mean you could count that up from the co rewards on the wiki pretty quick. But do you count quests where you must do something that gives you xp, like fighting something?

You only need to tank 3 wilderness levels. Shouldn't ever be that difficult.
---
 thats literally my worst fear 
---
Prayer is much easier to train after you become a member. Hill giants are less crowded or you can just go to the ogres by Yanille and collect the bones left by the people who are cannoning. Then you get 3.5x experience for each when you offer them at a guilded alter in someone's house. I barely trained prayer at all when I was F2P and then got it up to 43 in no time as a member.
---
There are several people who have successfully gotten the quest cape at the lowest possible combat level (85) which is essentially what this would be.  IIRC, there are a few instances where one would have to actually train a skill to get to the next quest requirement but it's all on the wiki. 
---
Think the pic on the right is legit photoshopped even 
---
I would count the xp from fighting as well since it is necessary for completing whatever quest it is
---
Low key not much to complain about here
---
I completely agree.  If you get scammed, you deserve it.
---
Just got back into OSRS.  Slaying while training combat stats right now.  I am at 60 attack, 51 strength and 48 defense.   Trying to figure out best route to go for next combat training. Obviously strength is important but not really much I need it for right now until 70 with Barrows weapons.  I was thinking of going for either 70- attack or 60 defense first.  Reason for 60 defense getting access to another tier of armor beyond rune.  Reason for 70 attack is access to whip,  sara sword and zammy spear. 
---
But as I increase my slayer level, I'll be fighting harder monsters and feel like i'll need the defense to last longer in tasks.
---
If ya'll had to prioritize, what order would you put 70 attack, 60 defense and 60 strength?
---
Right now, I am feeling:
---
1. 60 defense
---
2. 70 Attack
---
3. 60 strength
---
You should never use trident for training mage.

Does anyone know of a world where people host houses with rejuv pools in  Fremnick area?  I've checked the house world a few times to no avail.

What's there to break down? You just put all the teleports you need in your house (except Catherby) and bring house tabs.

That Abby sire change also needs to be applied to skotizo for catacombs greater demons tasks

It says saving all of the runes of the cast.

An interesting comment.
---
From a thematic standpoint no resource drops make sense - the only drops should be the Fangs and the Visage. And I guess Snake Hide.
---
Get a Camelot and Troll Stronghold portal in your house.
---
Every other teleport is done through items (Explorer's ring, Ardougne cloak, ectophial, xeric's talisman etc)

I watch 99% of videos on x2, more efficient

I'm pretty sure the higher level shades can drop rune scims

OP didn't even bother with subtitles this time around.  Not as funny if you don't know what they say to each other at the end.

Did OP say the co worker is “wasting time” because he’s playing osrs? Absolutely rude and I’m offended 
---
Wow, I am just seeing this post now and it gave me the warmest feeling ever. Thank you so much! I could not be happier with the reception and feedback of the new videos it's been wild. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!

Also it's the same picture

I’m guessing 73 is your favourite number
---
Lol, this gave me a good chuckle. Thank you. 
---
Can I at least get barrows gloves first.. 
---
Yea, should have been just killing NPCs with magic instead, whether it be blue drags, Rex, Krakens or whatever.
---
Currently, there aren't really any cheap ways to cast combat spells (relative to melee and ranged at least).
---
I think elemental spells should be a cheaper alternative to other spells. 
---
Obviously this idea isn't everything that needs to be done to make that happen, but it's a start.

You couldnt finish all the quests that qay as there is a fair few that require you to train skills to meet the minimum requirements to do the quest.

You can find a jad simulator online to practice the prayer switches

Prims look like lebrons way more lol
---
Are you asking what you use the Spellbook for? You could use the Fertile Soil spell with stacked Volcanic Ash to save inventory space if you don't have Bottomless ultracompost bucket, you can teleport to Catherby without going to poh, and if you have the mage lvl you can spellbook swap to Arceuus and revive plant if you have a dead patch.
---
I don't really think any of it is indispensible, especially w bottomless bucket and how many disease-free patches there are + Anima patch. 
---
Evidently not 
---
The volcanic whip animation does not work on mobile- the area where you normally see the fire animation is just transparent. Is this a bug or is it intentional to increase mobile performance?

Yes, but its only 2 uses are olms hand and rune dragons. I dont know why dragon hunter lance has worse stats than  zammy hasta, a nice small buff would be to have the same stats as the hasta at least.
---
If you're not trading to get it then why do you care about its monetary value? 
---
Couldn't you say the same about the Rapier? That is already a replacement for the Whip so the Bone Whip could do a similar thing where it is better, but costs enough more that it isn't common.
---
No lance is already insane, why would they buff it more?
---
But if I’m using say a water spell I’m gonna use a water staff to save the runes every time.. would make more sense if it saved all runes maybe? 
---
Two pets and the MVP didn’t get either. Rip

Assuming you are still in grade school, you need to meet with your principal or reach out to your school corporation's central office and ask for help. Most of us on OSRS reddit aren't equipped to help you and you need some serious help.
---
The embed leads to the live broadcast and not the actual clip, whereas the link I provided you embeds the link into reddit properly. 
---
Is there any hope for the dragon hasta to be given an str option to be usable in pvp?
---
I like it's unique spec idea, but can't help but feel that it's dead content.
---
Also, why was the mystic recolor added without a poll?
---
What I did for my last black demon task because I wasn't in the mood for demonics.
---
Yes sell those prims, get torture. It's better damage. You can use world 330 for free maxed houses. Might be handy to get the stam+spec pool, and an altar in your house, also some teleports. Thats around 66 construction iirc, wont be too expensive.
---
its 2019, get over it.
---
abby whips are for plebs now.
---
What do you mean? You can sit there praying ranged with proselyte on just fine, their melee attack is infrequent and inaccurate. You just take food.
---
Yeah, it’s almost as crazy as when mayweather fans said that he could beat  mcgregor in a real fight.
---
You'd do well in reading into the context of the situation, because un-ironically, the insinuation is more than apt in this case. Had the swearing been appropriate in response, then I can see where you'd be coming from but unfortunately in this case, it was completely unnecessary.
---
Going to lose the Whip as the staple of OSRS.
---
I mean - I understand it.  But. Damn :( 
---
I hope the bone whip doesn't pass
---
Yeah he’s definitely not a good streamer, don’t get me wrong I don’t hate the guy. I just think he’s annoying and doesn’t belong in the rs streaming community. Have you seen that video of him beefing with some other dude? Total cringe.
---
Not sure where the "fill a gap" aspect for the bone whip comes from. I do like the idea, however, there are several weapons which requirements are way underleveled for the power they have. Tbow, scythe, sanguinesti staff are all weapons where the requirements do not make sense at all. Sang staff is better in every single way compated to toxic trident, yet they have the same requirements. 
---
We should revise the requirements for those weapons first before filling in gaps with tier 72 weapons.
---
Got em bois
---
Nothing about the dragon hunter lance? Kind of ridiculous that it drops from a boss that realistically cant be used against or is so sub-par to even a blow pipe. The lance is only good at rune dragons..
---
I'd honestly like it just as much as a cosmetic, my comment was just about the looks
---
Might be worth tweeting about.
---
Idk feels like i struck a nerve, sorry if i did :)
---
Jeez yeah that's super unlucky. The variance on skilling pets is annoyingly high. My only one is sire from an unsired so still never seen "you have a funny feeling" in game, the hunt continues. I do quite a bit of bossing too.
---
Any hydra drop is gonna be cheap too. We're gonna have every fkin main in the game running around with a bone tail wtf..
---
No. It's all based on the drop rate of the pet. Increasing your levels doesn't do anything.
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
I remember when my brother would let me play on his account when I was little. All he would let me do is kill chickens the whole time for bones. Then he let me play Ocarina of Time for the first time and told me to do the same thing. I will never forget that day of betrayal

Nah it kinda stays in one place

Its just a lazy upgrade to a not very useful item to create an itemsink for itself, so that the gp/h of hydras gets buffed.

---
Wow something that doesn't effect me in anyway, let's bitch about it and take the bait.

Related somewhat but my first arms task on rs3 looked very similar to this. I got two chests plates and the chainskirt and 25 KC.

same lmao

88 agility for something that isn’t a shortcut? Okay... that benefit of skipping trash on the way is definitely not 88 agility worthy imo.
---
Yeah I don't know why I wasted my time on it TBH I guess I didn't expect a response to this meme via twitter so he kinda drug me into it.. Got my YT channel more views though :) 
---
He can do barrows as well, unless I’m missing something
---
Was it fairly easy for you? I'm in a similar boat as OP.
---
Curious as to why orbs and volcanic ash didn't make it on the kdt. These are regularly botted resources that would have been a nice useful drop rather than the regular boring alchable drops like rune armor.
---
It's actually the amount assigned (still) and how long they take to kill. The drops are fine, not everything needs to be as overpowered as gargoyles. 
---
this may be the actual fix to normal spellbook pking
---
Back then people were way less efficiency focused, multi logging was against the rules and so on

Your basically saying why not just be able to choose your slayer task? Defeats the point of slayer then because I would just choose dags and afk cannon then till 99.

Your good, and im 88 slay, i make dec money but its not about the money, i think its cool they used the last slot they didnt use before with the diary ,  and i was half joking about the nerf part i was making fun of anyone who ever said anything about the konar table
---
You have a point about the rapier.
---
But the rapier is much, much rarer than the whip, or hydra tail. 
---
Basically, since the hydra tail is much less rare (than the rapier), I can't help but think that the bone whip will become a very common replacement for the regular whip.
---
It all depends on the cost of the tail, as you said.
---
I did Ratcatchers before either MM, and that quest made me fifty-two flavours of mad.

Bonus shoutout to getting spotted through a wall, teleported outside to ground floor, then climbing up to reset and seeing that shit-eating guard just camping the top of the climb-up spot.

Yes I fucking love the bone whip!

How about locking favour to only go up in a certain house after its novice quest is complete?

It looks weird

Now you can beat the shit out of people with an abyssal demon's spine and wait.. there's more.. also a hydra bone (probably the spine too lol)
---
ez clap
---
take my gp 
---
Clearly photoshopped, girls don't play runescape, only guys that pretend to be girls.
---
I would say the DHCB shouldn't come from Raids and be placed on a different drop table. The crossbow and lance shouldn't even work on Olm as it isn't even a dragon in a sense.
---
you can make the money to afford all that fishing? 
---
minnows or monk fish or what?
---
It’s so dumb I don’t even remember what they were fighting about but they were in a discord call screaming at each other on stream like spazzes
---
Bone Whip should have a new special attack, ANYTHING better than the Abyssal Whips special attack will be fine.
---
Those marks it's going to leave on your opponent are going to look weird

[Attas seed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Attas_seed) increases the yield of all crops when planted.

---
bruh that part took me 2 days (obviously it was because I ragequit but still)
---
the difference is that people wont stop playing runescape. not because of some throwaway amount of money anyway.
---
runescape is a unique game to which its playerbase is deeply attached and borderline addicted to while netflix is just a platform for watching shows, theres nothing about it that makes the netflix experience irreplaceable by something else.
---
No, the higher your level the higher your chance is of getting a pet. Idk about OPs question though
---
I used DHCB for first 500 kills, wish I hadn't BP is way better IMO kill speed over halved since.
---
Trade ya 2/3 of my prims, both jars, eternal, peg, and all 3 smoldering stones for a pet. 
---
Still only pay $10
---
I understand your sentiment, but i thin is unfortunately long past being relevant. Ignoring the tent, We already have the rapier, the abyssal bludgeon, the abyssal dagger, Zammy Hasta, and Saradomin Sword(blessed and regular). There's a glut of choices that are better  at certain tasks then others. The whip has lost some of spender as the iconic weapon of choice.
---
If the appearance of the bone whip were to change slightly to incorporate some more of the iconic look, would that satisfy you?
---
I recommend taking a moment to think if accusing the developers of a game of being pawns to a Chinese company with no free will is warranted, or really a good way to get your point across.
---
Looks like anal beads? Are you gay
---
Yes you can boost to use the patches, been using the fruit tree patch since 80 farming just by boosting through the door. 
---
I'm gay.
---
Because liquids can't be wet, they only make solids wet.
---
How many times was this shit reposted?
---
I wasn't okay with the bone whip until I realized that it would be a pointless upgrade. 
---
I feel like a lot of people who are max melee use abby whip, neitiznot, f cape, torture, bandos, ddef, ferocious gloves, and berserker(i). This is a total of +138 str, and a max hit of 34. Increasing the whip str by +1 doesn't increase the max hit at all. The tent whip in that setup can hit a 35.
---
I've been playing around in the DPS calculator with different setups and I can't find any setups where the +1 str actually increases DPS. In almost all common setups the max hit stays the same. So essentially the new whip will only be good for adding a very very small accuracy bonus.
---
straight outta lumbridge would have been better but not bad
---
That's the coolest pet as well. Nice 
---
Still no herb secondaries absolutely a shame. This is one of the biggest things people wanted.
---
Correction: you don't care
---
They’re gloves now. Sorry about that! I made them on stream and the chat said it looked better that way :(
---
Just normal range void atm, but I do have salve(ei)!
---
Why exactly? +1 att range is optional to use, just stand closer if you need to be.
---
Fuaaaa. Call in them Bone’s baby. 
---
Panic but hydra tails!?!?
---
Until it's funny again
---
I would just like to say, wow, you read the threads and everything on this subreddit then adjusted everything in a timely matter. Whether everyone agrees or not, it is quite amazing compared to other games devs how fast the response team has been. I know its a "thanks for doing your job" but everything people wanted you added as a poll. Neat stuff. 
---
Why are streams so boring
---
Wait. How did you take this photo?
---
Fuck man I've been caught. Slam the door on me jamflex.
---
You’re not even half way to the drop rate, how on Earth are you gonna complain about not having the pet at 1300 kc? Come on dude. 
---
how detrimental to my dps on vasa/tek (no dagger or bludg) is -5 str binge? (Considering making my only hasta into lance) 
---
Haha it legitimately does
---
Also great for slayer tasks, steel/iron/blue/black dragons
---
Konar's Drop Table is still missing Volcanic Ash, looks good other than that.
---
Meet Swampletics \*waves\*
---
Jingle Jangle...
---
It wouldn't be replaced as the standard. Tentacle whips are already much better. The Hydra Tail could potentially end up costing 6m which means new people won't just skip over using the normal whip to get this.
---
Then at the end of the day there's the rapier.
---
You wish brainlet 
---
noted hydra bones or riot
---
are you some iron who used their only hasta on a lance or something lol. It doesnt make it worse, hasta is bis literally nowhere, unlike lance.
---
8-12 torstol seeds lol 
---
It wasn't ever funny
---
Good thing some of the hydra buffs like faster respawn times and noted bones with diary were withdrawn from the poll. And with a lance buff in the talks, I doubt the hydra claw will crash anytime soon.
---
And the people love them so I must provide 
---
World record for the highest up person to play osrs?
---
If Veos is going to stick around and not be just a one off character used in Client of Kourend, could we at least give him a character model that isnt just the Mysterious Old Man?

Idk who is crying - the lance is better than almost everything vs dragons, I really don’t see the problem

reminds me of rhino cape from rs2 on the rightmost pic, gross

I mean the 5 jars lol, i know it's 1/1000 and the pet is 1/3000, but if I can get 5 jars in 400kc I could have also just got the pet.

Just don't call it a whip then, it's a flail

Im glad the drop table is not catering to ironmen... if these drops would be added they would crash like crazy, thus only remaining useful to ironmen.
---
jumping from a leaf? wtf
---
I don’t get why you’re coming across so butthurt - the lance is good as it is. Reduce vork and hydras melee defence to make it more viable there and that’s all you need to do imo
---
You make my solid wet
---
I don't think he was suggesting changing it to barriers, but Jagex could definitely fix the pathing issue. The code for pathing via minimap clicks likely considers the invisible gate as an obstacle, which is why right now you get stuck. The code could very likely be altered to not consider those invisible gates as obstacles, yet do an check&gt;interface if the farming lvl isn't high enough to pass.
---
Big support. This is exactly what I think should've been done instead of the current hack.
---
Nerf tears of guthix. That's too OP for 520 uses

No one would use that spec over SGS, but I like the strength training option idea. 
---
Volcanic Ash on Konar Table PLZ.
---
Volcanic Ash may have been excluded since it was meant to be unique to Fossil Island.
---
Your point would come across better if I didn't need to stop every other word to wash the salty taste out of my mouth. 
---
Cause if you are paying attention to a piece of paper than you aren’t paying attention to the furnace or the anvil. Do you want your character to get burned?
---
Lmao i thought the same thing :p
---
I could see that argument but whips also often times have slightly larger pieces in the end.
---
Superior kc 152 btw.

I got my pet on 330 kc, was my first unique
---
Don't get too excited, people are super butthurt about it. Questionable whether it'll pass. 
---
Feelsbadman
---
Why is he pking if he only does slayer?
---
This new droptable is even worse than the one live? You literally took nothing from clouds suggestions. Definitely wont be waisting time doing konar slayer if this goes through.
---
And me!
---
Name checks out.
---
Its a tail. Its in the name. Sheeeesh.
---
I almost spent my bank on them before they changed the alch value. Shoulda bought like 300 of those cunts
---
Nice man :)
---
I got 20kc pet :)
---
Did you read what i wrote?
---
Lol yeah I'm conflicted on that. I loved the random events but I play a lot of AFK now sooooo.....
---
Edit: ANOTHER LONG BONE
---
if you’re pking a skiller/cluescroller then you’re just a loser. You’re not getting better at PKing and you’re getting nothing out of it other than the satisfaction of killing a helpless player. i’ts a waste of time and people should be allowed to have the opinion of shitting on it.
---
My god... 
---
Ok, thank you!
---
What about the thousands of lower lvls who would sell whip to upgrade?  Would cause a huge price dip if suddenly 100k whips enter the market without equal demand.
---
Dhc is way better at most of those.
---
They should move all of the NMZ secondaries over...
---
Which episode is it in?
---
No shit right? God forbid someone wants to rock some cool armor while they train.
---
If i had to guess it'd probably be 30
---
my point exactly, i'm mainly clanning its so annoyinh
---
Not a spineeeeeeeee. Elvarg 1 point.
---
Yeah. I’ve been in some ba speedrun groups and the level 3 would either be a healer spamming the heal pool or would need basically a healer to just themselves. It’s not that hard with a team of maxed accounts besides them but just the amount of times they’ve gotten a pet on a level 3 shows a lot of dedication. 
---
I believe the queen is also among the rarest/longest pet to get as you can’t just grind out a kill every few minutes like a normal boss. 
---
I swear to god I reached level 40 in only two years! /s
---
Yeah, probably.
---
I enjoy some weird ass tasks like (non-extended) wyverns haha.
---
This is why I unlock the monkey caves and leave this quest unfinished.
---
Oh also i'm 1 def.
---
Its impressive but this guy is a real asshole in BA. It's all he does and takes it way too seriously.
---
Not real obviously but of course Ian and Skiddler reply to it, do these cunts ever get off twitter lmao. Have a wash you greasy cunts. 
---
Thank you i was unable to read that in your post. ( sarcasm )
---
50 cooking for the best healing food is low. 
---
I love lawbringers as much as the next guy, but they use poleaxes 
---
Shoving people with a lance would just be silly
---
This shit is bananas.
---
):
---
Yeah, that's why I'm 99 fishing and WC'ing already. RC is a strange beast because 99 RC gives me the gold I need to finish herblore. 
---
I also really really enjoy me some chill zeah RC while chilling on alts.
---
I remember someone lured my ass for a Dragon Battleaxe back in those days. 
---
God I loved Meganium
---
Correct.  Stab is the way to go.  Always best practice to use the combat style you have the highest bonus in.
---
Right isn’t the whole point of a whip that it gets smaller towards the end? Hence it makes a whip sound?
---
When you want to \]: like the picture but you can only :(
---
Isn't it an upgrade, not a replacement? If anything I think it should have a higher atk req, maybe 75 or 85 even. 
---
At Duel arena - “Boning 1b”
---
Why
---
Does the F2P quest give a little RC exp? If yes u got my vote
---
That's all I have ever seen. Only last year did I realize it was a saw and wood
---
this is so sad, Cornelia. 
---
Nah, this would just lead to extra bag spots and clans locking down bossing locations on those worlds.
---
30% of the time it works everytime 
---
I approve
---
I mean theres the arguement that atleast with the jugs someone made them and the bots are taking one item and making another instead of just bringing in an item. 
---
Caught this live completely by chance after seeing a clip of him on here earlier. Couldn't have had a better start to the rebuild really.
---
thank you, not many people realize this. Oddly enough, if I ever mention to a white person that I don't consider myself white, they look at me like I am crazy or delusional or trying to be a special snowflake. But when I've mentioned it to black people, they seem to understand and can relate. 
---
LOL..Watch out for the boner scam
---
I did realize, but I lowballed literally every other number to account for this. There's way more than 2 million member accs, I used the 100k number even though thats only on peak time, I said 25% of the RC'ers have done kebos elite which is probably WAY less in reality, so I reckon it all equals out roughly. 
---
The other day I went to the PVP world to get gear back from one of my friends. Afterwords I fully geared up into ToB gear. Teleported with the ectophial, Took the boat to ToB, and then finally realized. 
---
I'm not butthurt, I just think its retarded that its always more effort to melee things but melee gets shit on by range lmao
---
If you're pooling everytime that's 6 trips. That's 4-5 minutes of banking. Blowpipe method is aids for this reason alone
---
A few hours in and I forgot how addicting this is. My combat level is currently on 11 and I have work today but I don't feel like going. 
---
Weird how a 6m weapon on 200 gp ammo out dpses it
---
ok i updated the link so hopefully  you can see it now but thanks for the advice
---
Nobody knows what a naked person is actually risking.. for all we know u may have opened a clue chest and have 500k on u
---
Could insulated boots be made to reduce the lightning attack damage from Alchemical Hydra? When meleeing Alchemical Hydra, you have to choose between standing still for 6 seconds and lose quite a bit of DPS or take 3 lightning hits to maintain DPS during the lightning special.
---
Man that 'fight' was the most boring thing I'd ever seen on TV. 
---
so... clan wars were dope in 07.. if you recall...
---
exactly its mostly useless for targetting someone specifically, and with these large data aggregations you aren't going to find much use in using them for that because often times the extreme size makes grepping them impractical when you could just have a large group of smaller ones.
---
There’s so many other variables to be concerned about. 6 hours is nothing in the long run.
---
DHCB is more than 2x more effective than lance at hydra.  It certainly isn't bad, I've had 1:30 min kills with it, averages 2-2:20 mins though.  Lance on the other hand its 3-4 mins average, despite being much more effort.
---
Vorkath DHCB averages 1:30 or so, lance is 3 mins.
---
DHCB hits 70s+ with the occasional 100.  Lance does 50s and its less accurate.
---
DHCB combos with void range quite nicely as well, making it insane with free armor.
---
Whats daily scape?
---
Best pet with the new hydra
---
Yes I totally agree I was just responding to these trolls saying durr what you want to raise it to max level 400 mil xp yada yada. Like no dumbass there is certainly a good middle ground, it is crazy to have people who gain like 10 level and play for 1 day to have the same input as everybody else on content they are months and months away from accessing or forming an opinoin about.
---
Except for 99 Firemaking (Wintertodt) and Thieving (Ardougne knights while being in the cc) no one was at my 99 party :\^)
---
And I had 12 99's ._.
---
I'd be fine with that, just tone down the seed quantities and drop ash/cballs/orbs
---
only the normal/tent whip looks good.
---
the recolours and this "bone" thing looks like a fucking abomination. please stop. 
---
How about i vote no to this post?
---
It isn't superior to BP at hydra.  Have you even tried it? You'll get 3-4 min kills.  I've tested it for 10 kc and its complete shit everywhere but olm hand, and even at olm hand. 
---
Cannot wait for streamers to stop mattering
---
Or worse, they simulcast in some countries and arbitrarily hold it back in others because fuck you.
---
Yes, I'm still salty about Violet Evergarden.
---
Because everyone wants to make the guild more user friendly by getting rid of doors. Thats ezscape got to make everything a challenge! 
---
probably when they fix the chat log missing messages
---
so, soon ™
---
Ranged is MUCH better.  You get kills 2x as fast, safely. 3x if you're on tbow.
---
Boxing is boring. Boxers play for points which sucks ass
---
Are there any intentions to make melee a more viable method for the Alchemical hydra?
---
With how the hydra mechanics work atm, players are required to lure the hydra to different vents and run around the fire in the 3rd phase.
---
Players using melee loses many opportunities to attack as they have to have to lure a ranged monster onto the vents and during the 3rd phase, they must walk around until the fire stops.
---
With the current defence values of the hydra, even if the player didn't have to lose opportunities to attack, range would still out DPS melee.
---
I skip wyverns as I think they’re too far away and the colors in the dungeon hurt my eyes. Which level of disabled am i? 
---
it's going to be double whip price and not everyone will have on most will but not everyone
---
Suggestion: one free 99 when I finished tutorial island pls
---
I see this as an integrity change. Consider it done.
---
Does Hydra agility shortcut *really* need to be level 88? The highest agility requirement shortcut in the entire game feels a bit harsh to avoid some minor damage, why not just make it a hard or elite diary requirement?
---
Question about the seed vault - would it be designed like a second bank or would it be closer to an interface that has all possible seeds already in their placeholder positions? Mainly asking to see the extent to which it can all be customized :)
---
I would be 100% for this, but I'm afraid the cons might outweigh the pros :/
---
Isn’t the tail used on the whip? Therefore people still have to obtain a whip to add the tail to it?
---
Of course I never said anywhere that database dumps were only useful stolen creds. 95% of database dumps you can find for sale are already pilfered for their Credit card information. 
---
With that being said, These database aggregations are often nothing compared to the originally dbs because its often just email:pass or user:pass combinations making them essentially useless. In fact the db in question is a collection of combos essentially from bigger databases.
---
The only information you'd get from most dbs is like a username, ip address and maybe a fake DOB. I can tell you with certainty After someone came to me selling a database of large size that was essentially just that, no passwords he was offering to sell me it for a paltry amount.
---
Yea and I’m saying that this change isn’t “designing around ironmen”. The only difference between ironman and regular accounts is that the ironman isn’t going to ge to buy resources. The items come into the game through the same method, and a regular account can choose to gather resources just the same. If the method of gathering a resource is bad enough that it’s primarily botted and legitimate players don’t do it themselves, then there’s objectively something wrong with the way it comes into the game
---
“He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.” - F.N. OP, your state of mind moving forward will dictate the outcome. If you see this hardship as a death sentence, it will become one. If you see it as the breaking of the last straw leading to your glorified emergence, so it shall be. The closest thing we have to free will is in the configuration of our lens, of our perspective. No matter how dark it gets, glory is a breakthrough/dogmatic shift away. You just have to let go of the fear. Stare it in the face. Then stare it down. Curb stomp the cunt.
---
I tried doing this too haha
---
For people who play on spotty internet/servers, you could die at the boss and dc at the normal hydras, in which case you probably die and lose everything in the chest.  This shortcut prevents that
---
They should rename Boxing to Hugging. 
---
So what happens to those dusk robes?
---
are you on mobile or have extreme latency issues
---
ok :P
---
Do you still need an empty inventory space? Such as picking up arrows when you are full?
---
Maybe the special attack could unleash lightning as a form of attack like the hydra boss does.
---
WHY DONT WE HAVE THIS
---
anchovy pizza is a f2p food, heals 9 per bite for 18 total and requires 55... apple pie requires 30 and heals 7 per bite for 14... 
---
I guess you are right though.. because those are multi bite foods... '
---
Monkfish requires 62 and heals 16.. so maybe something like 58
---
Ironically, choosing not to add resources because they would benefit ironmen is literally designing AROUND them. 
---
The game shouldn't be designed for them, which is more or less my point.
---
I truly believe this is one of the main reasons I love strength training so much. Grind grind grind then it pays off.
---
Personally I'd like to see something else for the hydra tail.. Theres already abyssal whip and tentacle whip.  I'm kind of scared to vote no though as it'd make the item useless once again.
---
Here's an upvote 
---
Haha yeah, not the first time i get corrected 
---
Doesn't take much to trigger people on this sub
---
Definitely the most early 2000s skill in the game... not modern at all
---
I, too, wonder why the Y chromosome is shrinking so quickly 
---
2005 total lvl, only have Rocky.
---
That is simply illogical. Wet things make dry things wet. Water simply is the most concentrated wetness there is. 
---
Also in your definition only water that is absoutely pure is not wet. Since that practicaly not excist it is pointless argument in practice. Water contains impurities like minerals, dust and gasses. So yea mineral water are just wet minerals, any water that is exposed to air is just wet air. So the only 'dry' water you find would be in a labratory.
---
But hey even then I would argue only 1 atom of water could be considered dry, after all a decond one would make that atom wet. 
---
In the QA I believe they said that it might not be possible.
---
It's a 20 year old game written by a bunch of 20 something new programmers in the early 90's .... 
---
nobody can be asked to make them into cballs though, thats what the bots do lol
---
Granted. Starting gp increased from 25 to 99.
---
What happened with the discussion on dragon hunter lances? you seemed so open to it and said there would be discussion on ways to make it more useful at something other than ONE olm hand, and rune dragons when compared to DHCB. No possibility of it being viable at hydra at all? i get that you guys don't want to buff hydra but nerfing its melee stats so something other than Tbow(1200m) or blowpipe (6m) is better is out of the question?

Your username is the solution to this problem

Kind of hard to be black and consider yourself white so makes sense that they can relate! 
---
you need a abyss whip to make the new whip, dummy...
---
They stay
---
Okay, but if I pick up a whip, I'm not going to hold the end and hit you with the handle. That's not how a whip works. 
---
Soooo is DHL not getting buffed then?
---
S1E7 iirc
---
Alch it
---
You don't have to for this to effect the usage of the spells. They already have a large amount of use.
---
Looks like something actually from 2007 so I like it.
---
Shit, if I'd known it was going to get me karma I would have posted my 1kc bucket.
---
Nice
---
Its non degradable and can be resold. Anyone who has a whip has no reason to not grab one regardless of the price.
---
actually im an anime girl, just like you
---
You dont actually need a hydra task to get the music cape, you can walk in the lair to unlock the track.
---
make sure to check your lemons regularly for cancer
---
Ores are safe due to the alch price. 
---
It needs +2 strength, exactly half of the tent whip and a special attack!
---
I flew united the other week and the greedy jews tried charging me 30 bucks for wifi
---
Compelling argument.
---
I also heard an equally convincing one: "Don't."
---
Definitely the debate of the decade.
---
oh shut the fuck up, it doesnt need to be buffed.
---
I don't mind slayer, but I also don't mind people playing the game the way they like playing the game. Not sure why some do.
---
What exactly is the problem?
---
Wouldn't the nails damage the cannon or cause the cannonballs to not fire correctly? We can't have lack of realism. (nevermind the 10,000 cannonballs in my inventory btw)
---
what
---
Nope, it works with a full inventory. Super nice 
---
Just quest
---
Sure it’s rare but my point is that the jars have nothing to do with the pet. They are completely unrelated 
---
Paying too much money for an inferior product sounds more like apple users to me than RL users...
---
Wish they'd find a different use for the hydra tail.  I'll vote yes out of fear for the item becoming useless though
---
Nvm almost to the quest cape. Lol. 
---
2064 with Phoenix (129kc), Kraken x2(400ish and 1000ish kc), Skotos (1kc), Beaver (86), Golem (79), Chompy. I have more KC on Thermy and Vorkath than other bosses and 99 Thieving and Farming with no pet. I have got literally every pet I don't want, and haven't got my two favorite pets of Rocky and Tangleroot. 
---
I'm not a Conor fan but he would be heavily favoured against the mountain in a real fight unless the mountain were to receive some mma training. Freak fights like this have happened in the early days of UFC where Royce Gracie was consistently managed to beat people twice his size, and MMA has come a long way since then. Conor just has to play smart and tire the bigger guy out by dancing around him, the only way the mountain wins is if Conor messes up and the Mountain manages to get a hold of him.

When you forget 200gp to tell the tree to fuck off.
---
That's a funny way to spell Tzeench.
---
Uim lose all items upon death
---
But the market for it will be much larger than the tent whip since its non degradable. The same way that most people who use the whip aren't 85 slayer, its a good drop for people with 95 slayer to make some coin off of
---

I thought the same thing, it looks upside down please fix so it's fat around handle and thin at end u/mod_ry

I mostly have confidence in him but every damn time he says "okay now head west" I have to go double check that the fucker is actually heading west

I wouldn't say bone whip will be "basically bis", abyssal tentacle and rapier are both better stat wise in every way, not to mention depending on what you're doing, other weapons would be better than the bone whip such as hasta for dragons and bludgeon/abby dagger for strength training.

new = bad REEEEEEEE

How is that even a bait though? A picture of a dead hcim photshopped

Is this a joke how rc is slow to train???

Kieren said they're still there, they just showing the regular table.
---
you sound like you have been through...and come out the otherside of a lot of shit. Just keep going, things can improve. It sounds like you need to get yourself to a bigger town with more prospects. As others have said if you are considering harming yourself please talk to a profeasional, death would be a huge xp waste! but in all seriousness you are worth more than that.
---
Happy to gift you a bond to keep you scaping with us for a bit longer....
---
&gt;tldr
---
just lemme use my d scim
---
Well you need the Western Provinces Elite diary completed before you can even attempt to get one which will require 1,000 chompy kills to do among other tasks. I think it took me 25 kills and plucks to get the pet once I had completed the diary though.
---
Its non degradable making it useful for people who don't want to consume whips while doing slayer, that's a decent sidegrade to tent.
---
Agreed. We’re all here for you. You need to make it to a larger populated area, it might be easier to find a job and a place.
---
I dunno, showing how long they were offline makes more sense to me than showing "8hrs, 11 mins ago"
---
Gotcha. Smithing in F2P is abolutely an awful slog. 
---
no, not really. There are black Italians, and mixed Italians, but most are not.
---
Always remember to check haveibeenpwned because this dude clearly was lol
---
/u/JagexGambit please read this

What's more crazy is the fact that the Imp dropped it, right? O: 
---
Don't correct me when YOU are wrong
---
All of my in laws are this giant.
---
This gif is really me, trying to get my phone back from BIL.
---
If you want to make the dragonbone necklace useful just give it glory stats
---
Honestly yeah. Not sure drop rate but hella rare
---
The wording is inconsistent. 
---
You either get it or you don’t
---
There really is no reason for this to even exist. This does not feel well thought out at all. I'm okay with it as is because it's a minor accuracy increase, but I still don't like it. Adding +2 str would make it a no vote from me. Adding a special attack is a hell no.
---
I agree. The drop table has so much room for more exciting things than alchables. I do like the dart tips, magic logs and steel bars (instead of cannonballs) all being on there. I'm really glad they removed the unfinished rune bolts. Too many things drop rune bolts for little they're used.
---
I think changing the alchables drops to water orbs or even just battlestaves would be really nice. Id rather see gold ore on the table as well instead of several types of coal/iron/steel/cannonballs.
---
Could really use volcanic ash.
---
Sure but Konar is on a volcano. It's not a stretch to say that volcanic ash is in the area, considering the farming guild is also located there because of the "fertile soil".
---
don't even poll it; it's vital for the gnome war
---

People looking to boss generally aren't trying to have a clan fight.

---
Attach hydra tail to dragon mace for an epic flail
---
I was on my phone and I have enough shame to not look it up in public lol
---
Ahh well I must be thinking of someone else then.
---
Can we have the Volcanic whip mix and Frozen whip mix cosmetics work with and be polled along side the bone whip? The 2 cosmetics were a fun alternative to use with the standard method of training combat. It would become almost useless now since the bone whip only requires 2 more attack levels and would be the new standard for training. :)
---
And it's even greater when you become the man you always aspired to be
---
but it does... 
---
That’s fucking insane bro...
---
Now a 2k law rune? That was nice
---
Rip oldschool whip :(
---
A whip is already 2m, no one knows the drop rate of the Hydra tail but a direct upgrade replacement for a whip will have extremely high demand and a limited supply. I predict itll be over 10m
---
I generally don’t like them either, I don’t find any interest in “no quest UIM” or “boss only UIM” but area locked ones are different imo, maybe it’s just because I used to think about that exact concept as a kid, and seeing it popularized now just fills me with nostalgia.
---
These are great revisions.  I went from being a no vote on pretty much everything except for the slayer helm, to being a yes on most of these.  I still think that Angler should only come from Trawler, because IMO xp boosting outfits should be annoying to get.  Not a *huge* fan of making it so you don't need to be 100% favour to gain favour in other houses, but honestly its such a minor update that I don't really care if they add it or not.  Could we maybe add a vote on graphics for the bone whip?  The current model doesn't feel very runescape-y.
---
by what logic would it make abyssal demons dead content
---
Jed=ded
---
Out of curiosity why no ash or orbs?
---
My suggestion is to go play rs3 I’ve only been playing again for a few months and I can say that osrs is not osrs it’s more a moddified rs2 the power creep is unreal and people are still complaining it’s not enough 
---
There is no arguing that the game has recently moved to a more resource based drop table instead of toward high tier drops - this is to placate IM. Come on man, Ironmen to play like loners - the game shouldn’t cater to them. 
---
I'd imagine so but hopefully you can have an "unlimited" amount banked. It'd be cool to take a bunch to her at a time.
---
What if the bone whip could train str (instead of shared) but had the same stats as a normal whip? Would make for some interesting pking account builds
---
Decent idea tbh
---
nah m8 the majority of Italians are III on the Fitzpatrick scale, with lots of I and II, and not so many higher. 
---
See comment lower. CBA copy and pasting on mobile. 
---
I think this whip should have a lower accuracy with a higher max hit. I have always seen the abyssal whip to be a gossamer thread of razor wire with spikes and a barb on the end, which would be much more accurate than a heavy link of bones.  
---
I don't even use the lance it's just a suggestion I thought would be cool
---
FOUND THE BLACK CHINCHOMPA PKER
---
I promise you won’t regret it Mat.
---
Am I color blind? I've never noticed a pink dildo look. 
---
You get paid to play Runescape? Do tell how one can acquire this kind of career.
---
I don't really care about my XP rate that much, I care more about the passive income from doing slayer and Konar helps with that a decent amount. It is also interesting to go to different areas instead of just grinding at the same location like you normally would with other slayer masters.
---
But why????
---
Sold a hydra tail for 950k earlier....
---
I think that if the bone whip is added it should be locked behind a quest similar to the ferocious gloves. I think its a cool idea but could be tied to the game's lore better and not just a quick fix.
---
Purpp on Twitch is actually just about a week into a wilderness-only ironman if you want to see one.
---
How is changing the lance to be on-par with the range variant a powercreep we already don’t have?? My issue is focused more on hydra and why they make range(tbow) bis and weapons made for fighting dragons is USELESS there if you have even a blowpipe.
---
that's alot of spades you guys just earned
---
rc bad xd
---
well not the way things are set up right now there not... but if they had a chance at better drops they would get geared up differently and it would add a much broader verity of people coming together into a new world full of adventures in my opinion it should at the very lease be beta tested for a month or or something and be voted on. 
---
Runelite has everything and it's completely free
---
I'm assuming it's safe?
---
Just logged on and drank 3 more beers and got off. Thanks for covering fam 
---
Yeah that quest is shit, couldn't fucking find anyone because there were literally no hints as to where they might be. Just "go find them glhf". I kept talking and re-talking to the same people, hoping something i did would trigger some sort of hint. Then i tried for a while to pick the locks on the other guys in the jail. Finally ended up googling it after being jailed well over 73 times and making 0 progress.
---
you talking about clans running over people as its set up right now clans are just fucking everyone at revs non stop... it would take pressure off that spot alone. 
---
I think its crazy that people dont know what this is. I mean it may have different artwork but I had to go to the store all the time as a kid to get these membership cards. It is a 1 month membership car btw.

Go to where Bibila says, not rune lite. The runelite plugin works properly for assisting librarian customers, not the quest.
---
Weird flex but ok.

Yeah and they work closely with jagex just like osbuddy, but is 100% free.

Can we just remove the fun weapons option from duel arena and make all fun weapons have 0 stats?

---
Honwstly my main problem with RC is what I hate Agility for even more: It's kind of boring.
---
I can't exactly explain why I feel like that. Almost every skill is equally boring, but these two I physically cannot make myself do without watching something as distraction.
---
I peraonally don't care that it's slow. It makes me want to fall asleep. I decided to play OSRS because I'm lazy to learn for exams, I actually started studying because my character was left mid-RC session. That's how boring it is for me.
---
Bloods are I guess a variety on it, but besides that I'd definitely love a different, not necessarily faster way to train RC.
---
Ahhh the days of party hats being so expensive but completely worthless, The aspirations of young me wanting that fashionscape so hard, The long hours spent grinding pointless skills to try to accomplish that goal , putting off school - girls - social interactions just so I could acquire one of these beauties just for them to ultimately fall into a black abyss of decline. 9000/10 would do again.
---
only about 20 exp away from lvl 2 in each. normally you can whack a monster for 1 hit and then recoil to death and get the kill. not with sand crabs though

Good joke, got the name wrong, 4/10

Barrows shouldn’t be to hard at your level. I suggest topping off your agility to 70 and meeting the requirements for morytania hard diaries as the increase from runes will rack in more profit(bonecrusher is nice too) if you don’t feel like doing the above, slightly higher range and mage levels will suffice at zulrah. Might cost you some gp to learn the boss but once you do it’s pure profit.
---
No, that would make Abyssal Dagger and Bludgeon crash price extremely hard.

No, I do not want an HD update to a game called "Old School Runescape", and I frankly do not see the need for it. The main appeal of the game is having the old school-esque feel of old runescape, so why all the talk about an HD graphics update?

I was doing a nechs task earlier and got 2 noted rune full helms and a 100k+ cash drop. OK they are a nice bonus, but what value is that adding to Kebos than just raw GP? Let’s take a bit of time and bring in some complimentary skilling items to slayer, given the other cool new content from Kebos.

Hey man, I know what it's like to deal with thoughts like yours, and I know how much it can help to talk to someone. Ideally a professional if things get dire, but for just everyday conversation, people online who just listen work too. You can get through this. This bad mental episode will pass and you'll be in a better mindset to look at the situation and start on improving it. Life can sometimes just pile up with one shitty thing after another all at once, but you can get through it. If you ever want to just message someone and vent, you could PM me. I know what those thoughts are like and that it can seem inescapable, but it isn't. 
---
The fact is no one is forcing you to pay it. Osrs is thriving right now and if this trajectory continues and the devs bring more updates as successful as mobile then no one will complain.(mobile itself contradicts your main point)  I used to pay the 9/10$ every month for membership becausei could see the devs genuinely care about the game and the community, they gained my trust and I parted with the cash. Having played for 2 years paying for membership I am rewarded by being able to play my favourite game endlessly without every worrying about running out of membership.

If its undegradable and cheap it will be a replacement. Nobody will use a regular whip if you can spend 1m to make it permanently better with no downside. Tentacle and rapier are much more balanced because they degrade and are expensive, respectively
---
What's the point of making a straight up upgrade to the whip? Just because the necklace isn't good and you guys set the alch value high doesn't mean we need another weapon upgrade, especially not one as ugly as that

I saw a guy running numbers on the other thread and said that, as is, the stats on the bone whip change literally nothing on a well geared max player outside of an extremely tiny accuracy boost. No boost to max hit, etc.

I think it should just be a cosmetic option. I don't want to go down the Vine Whip descent.

Jesus christ a new variant on an item is proposed and all you people lose your minds. The way it's proposed makes sense, it'll balance the cost of the spine, while keeping everything else relevant. Quit looking for reasons to complain about things and instead look for the positives, or here's a thought, give constructive criticism instead of just REEEEEEEEEing all over the place.

100% agree. I assume it's because very high level players and probably most importantly streamers play so much and demand so much new content, especially high level. Frustrating to see the way it is going at the moment because power creep was inevitable and necessary really but it's happened much faster than i think it needed to

&gt; In response to the community reaction to the above table, we have opted for a new table which has taken the feedback on board. Key changes include an increase in the number of seeds dropped
---
But the seeds listed in the table above was for example, 6-10 ranarr seeds, and the new one after saying " include an increase in the number of seeds dropped", is 3-5 ranarr seeds. Any plans to increase this by chance?
---
I have to admit that making the hydra's fire attack dragonfire wouldn't be much of a stretch at all, and I'd actually be okay with that. Considering that they're looking to do that for drakes anyways, and I'm in favor of that, I'd be down for giving hydra that change. I still don't think changing mechanics to force underpowered weapons to be good is better than buffing them a bit so players will sometimes choose them on their own.
---
Do your homework before calling things trash, dhcb is the second-best weapon at hydra right now. Bow &gt; dhcb ruby + bp at end &gt; dhcb ruby/diamond &gt; bp &gt; lance in raw dps, with lance also losing extra time to luring and such, as it should.
---
Wear a granite ring if you have a lower defense. I think it really helps tanking the ranged bois chipsticks

---
&gt;I think it's okay to have some slayer monsters that are not AFKable...  
---
I don't disagree, but their drops should scale with how active they are and right now they don't even do that. As a hyperbolic example, you can't have something that requires the focus of demonic gorillas but the drops of bloodvelds.
---
Straight upgrades are a pretty common thing in OSRS. Defenders, Rapier, Cerberus Boots, and more are direct upgrades like this. As for why wouldn't you just upgrade it, cost. Why do players use Dragon Boots instead of Prims? Because Prims cost more... Also higher level but that usually isn't the reason for most players. It also wouldn't make the Whip irrelevant since it requires a Whip to make it. So I'd say this is in a similar spot of D Boots to Prims; both are similar minor stat upgrades and both are base items from Slayer that upgrade with drops from higher level creatures.
---
It really depends on how high the Hydra Tail would rise in price and how popular it is in PvP. If it is a popular PvP weapon, that would remove Hydra Tails from the game to keep up its price. But it could end up being a 2M upgrade or a 20M upgrade; it depends how highly player value the upgrade and that is not something we can probably judge after a few hours without the drop rates.
---
lmao the thought of his mom writing that and giving it to him as a treasure hunt is too good
---
Agreed. I'd rather just have a nerf to the packs rather than a change to the entire system.
---
Almost at 100 contracts myself, and I really like the current system.
---
whats up with all rich folks getting hacked recently
---
Seriously though isn’t it about time we get some quality of life buffs on RC? Even if it’s something like filling pouches when withdrawing essence or automatically using the runes from your rune pouches when at runecrafting at the altar? 
---
depends if you like doing quests. if you're one of those players who only does quests to see what rewards you can get out of them then it probably isn't worth it. 
---
but if you have qpc then clues become really really easy and profitable
---
Bots are already hammering the prices of ash and orbs hard enough, another hit to low/mid levels trying to make money from those activities doesn't seem warranted.

Go watch thurco's guide, it doesn't need xp increased.
---
At 99 fishing and hunter Aerial fishing is:
---
75k xp/hr fish
---
95k xp/hr hunter
---
It won't be, the tails are pretty common and each person only needs one. It won't be long before they are about 50k for the tail, with the whip staying reasonably similar to what it is now.
---
I'm not sure if this will help influence your decision, but looking at the price graphs, DHCB might be on its way back up.
---
It is also a lot easier to make money with a DHCB than ancestral since it can be hard to always have a raid team when you need one. I don't have a lot of raids kc, like 110, I've used max mage there and then had to downgrade to ahrims and i didn't see that much difference.

---
very tired of hitting people with parts of animals, really hope designs get more medieval
---
Weather can be wet, cos water is involved. Weather is not a solid. Ergo your definition of wet is flawed. 
---
Of course, there is a reason to use it over the Abyssal Tentacle; that degrades and the Bone Whip would not. And if you don't think it is worth using over the Abyssal Whip, then I guess you also think Primodials are pointless because they are a similar stat upgrade over D Boots. A +4 Attack and +1 Strength increase is reasonable and it doesn't need to be buffed just because you don't understand balance...
---
Weird flex. But okay .

Haha anytime brother. Pisses you off now but it will come in clutch in later situations!

Damn dude you got those super early on

Zulrah look like he's going to take you to flavor town
---
Hence why this set wouldn't be usable for bosses/demi-bosses or pvp. In reality the most it'll increase someone's max hit is by 3 or 4 compared to normal gear with a slayer helm. Someone wearing BiS gear with a slayer helm on task will still out dps this gear, short of maybe mage, which I honestly don't know a ton about because mage is underwhelming on this game so I never really gave it the light of day. What would you suggest changing the buff for the mage to?
---
Why

---
Restart your computer and when it’s turning on you can hit and switch that gives you access and you can swap it around where you f keys are first and you hold down FN to use the other features. Google it for your computer, a simple easy fix in 5 minutes. 
---
The fact that scythe still beats it on olm just means it needs a buff. Scythe does need some love too, particularly in the prohibitive use cost. When people are willing to pay 1b to use an uncharged item you know there's a problem.
---
Idc how it looks, I don’t want it in the game. If this is put in the game, people will no longer use whips. It’s a direct power creep that’s completely unnecessary. Furthermore, it kills a level of nostalgia and an iconic weapon. THE iconic weapon arguably.
---
Whips are already good enough for what they are, they don’t need a replacement. If they want to buff something, buff mage. Shit is dog trash. 500-600 gold per cast, less dps than range and melee, doesn’t get used anywhere. Mage needs buffs
---
I’m not just saying names. Im listing off items that made power creep a thing and a rs3 weapon.  If you constantly want more or less,” BiS “ items you’re going down a slippery slope. Yes the rapier is better but you probably can’t afford it otherwise you wouldn’t be posting about this lol
---
I'd be for it. I'm definitely buying that trim kit though.
---
Nah the stats are fine but definitely a useful special attack. Tbh Abby whip may as well not have one
---
Can you guess?
---
What, is your mom not around or something?
---
only gaining  half a level a year??? your not taking runescape as seriously as you should be man.
---
I mean how many accounts in general get one?
---
I know quite a few just in my clan chat that have one
---
I'd settle for "more than like 400 xp from a whole inventory and a half of supplies". 
---
I have several questions
---
the whip will not be BiS it'll just be an upgrade but alright dawg have a good day &lt;3
---
Poison damage doesn't provide exp so preferrably a normal dagger.  
---
I believe the short sword is best for exp.  
---
Note the obsidian armour and necklace only provides damage increase for obsidian weapons.
---
Besides rapier what’s better than tent
---
Deez nuts.
---
ZMI is easy af (even easier now that you can 1 click to the altar) and semi afk and zeah rc is afk
---
I'd rather have a tome for the other three elements like the tome of fire. Same exact setup, add pages to add charges. Charges are only used up for combat spells, etc. 
---
You’ll be lucky if you get the beaver before 15-20m exp
---
Came to this
---
What the hell are you talking about? We literally just had tons of QoL changes for it. 
---
TIL :o
---
What's there to think about just hit accept alredy. 
---
Have you done MTA? Could use a lot of Alchs in there to get some items, I did 72-77 in MTA getting B2P, wand etc
---
Yes I was going to say the same thing! Abby whip may as well not have a special attack because it’s so damn useless. People (me included) would pay just to have a useful spec + cool cosmetic upgrade
---
Blowpipe also out dpses tbow most of the time but we’re not planning on buffing that are we
---
Looks better than the other abyssal items
---
I believe so. You need to select low-defense monsters for it to be most effective     
---
Stab.

1. I just started playing again
---
2. It’s still as slow and shitty as before. 
---
There’s room for improvement.
---
I just read the word bananas again.
---
No it doesn't. Scythe is 1.3b item, so of course it beats generic item obtainable by slayer. Lance even might be better at cox solos, so no it doesn't need a buff. 
---
If it's his first time. The longer range will help him greatly in learning.
---
That is among the most beautiful sentences I've ever read.
---
He just got an item worth 16m GP traded in with the Emblem Trader on a BH world which is invaluable to rebuilding after losing everything on his account to a PK.
---
Okay, so then you don't know what the phrase "speak for yourself" means. Got it. 
---
firstly, if you think power creep single handedly ruined rs3 you're wrong. and secondly i just said it wouldn't be BiS and you bring up the actual BiS that point is null and void. lastly, i said have a good day. stop responding lmao.
---
Nieve/steve yes, duradal no, konar hell no
---
Geomancy btw
---
We'll allow it
---
Mining guild gives invisible 7 mining boost so coal is fastest there, esp with varrock diary armor and mining gloves
---
It's an untradeable,  cosmetic, zero value, zero high alch value item. It doesn't affect the economy at all. Players afking gargoyles effect the economy in a more harmful way than anyone farming bryophyta for a pet. You also have to keep in mind it has the same key system from obor, 1 key per kill. Adding a pet wouldn't do shit to the economy.
---
where did you just steal this from? I know I just saw it somewhere other than reddit
---
Well tent is 75 so it can’t be higher than that. And let’s be real, level reqs on high level gear in this game don’t mean anything, it’s all about cost
---
What if the elite diary reward gave the player a 50 percent chance of receiving noted hydra bones after a kill. Idk how hard that would be to implement but I feel like that's a good compromise if it's possible.
---
Ahhh, can’t trust anything you see on the internet
---
&gt;The majority of the suggestions that get upvoted here suck ass.
---
They absolutely do, which is why I am so proud of the community for putting so many good ideas forward in regards to the Konar drop table. I've seen a lot of really creative ideas about how to improve that. It's kind of nice for a change
---
Hey doofus, making dead content doesn’t do any part of the game any service. And you didn’t even know what torva or drygore was so don’t tell me about rs3 lol 
---
If you ever need to vent or need someone to talk to. Just DM me. I'll listen.
---
jokes on you I have two dads 
---
the mystic colors are awesome i love it.
---
&gt; Hence why this set wouldn't be usable for bosses/demi-bosses or pvp
---
So random gear dropped by stuff like bloodvelds should be more than twice as good as raids gear? That's a fuck no from me.
---
&gt; Someone wearing BiS gear with a slayer helm on task will still out dps this gear, short of maybe mage
---
Not maybe, it is flat out better. No one needs mage accuracy since pretty much every target you fight with mage is likely to have 0 or less defence.
---
&gt; What would you suggest changing the buff for the mage to?
---
Not making the set at all. We don't need another broken void set in the game.
---
Preferably stab since it provides the most attack bonus with the sword. But I believe monster weakest and focused stat takes priority.
---
Yeah they're pretty useless
