Pkers fighting other pkers would make for better streaming content than pkers hunting for spades.

This is adorable

Don’t go there then. The wildy is also pretty much completely dead, seeing another player while doing a clue is rare, let alone a PKer. Your exaggeration is pathetic.

I though 25 buttholes was the OG little timmy who due to his goblin boi antics killed himself. The true 25 buttholes descended into his body to proclaim the savage prophecy. And now he is the sole ruler of the wilderness due to his savage methods. Wow

I love Prif, but you only make that much per tree if you have 97 herblore lol... as someone with 70 herblore idk how to effectively convert my shards into cash

Hot and spicy meme here, come get it while the dank is fresh.
---
Yep, didn't do anything
---
Too cute
---
Could I ask your method? I tried soloing yesterday for the first time and got like 5 kills. I used the method of clicking meleer and then kree right after to keep melee attack frequency down. I still just feel like I get the shit beat out of me. Is blood barrage worth bringing?
---
I don't get it are those legit RuneScape tubers
---
Hahahahahahhahahahha
---
The three items I am missing are: ranger boots, crier hat, and a white elegant skirt
---
Well it's a suggestion. I know that it would affect very little in the grand scheme of the game, but it might keep the ~pigeons~ looting noobs away from the ge
---
Had a guy get 99 at Wintertodt earlier, obviously people were doing the whole Gzzz and @@@@@@@, pmod then threatens to mute anyone spamming. :)

Escaping pvpers is INSANELY easy in wildy as long as the level difference isn’t too big.
---
Go into your mobile settings, click on the joy stick and look at your Player Attack Options. Chances are, you have them on hidden.
---
I like Serp and Torags legs. I don’t skull so I don’t worry about losing anything. I usually bring a chaps in the invent for switches if I gap them. Always run for the trees.
---
Glad I’m not alone
---
Pvpers voted yes
---
Google cb Calc and find out yourself
---
What kinda of jobs do you people have where you can play rs all day?
---
Google an OSRS combat level calculator
---
Sounds like you need to change your settings. Open your settings (the wrench) then click on controls (the gamepad). You should see an option to change player attack options. You can change that to 'Left click when available' to be able to attack people.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fair warning, this is dangerous because you can be skulled easily and lose all your stuff. I recommend setting it to 'always right-click' so that you can still attack but you can't accidentally attack someone.

I wouldn't recommend stopping at barrows gloves! Doing the grandmaster quests each unlock amazing money making methods, and you need tons of gp to pregress into late game.

---
I wouldn’t use BP since scales are really expensive and you won’t break even from it. If you want the most afk what I did was use and imbued magic shortbow with rune arrows. Easy mode I wouldn’t even use overload potions I would just drop your health to 1 and absorb up. Every 10-15 minutes just bring your health back down.
---
I’m 83 cb with 3 def RIP lol.  Been doing wildy slayer and it’s not too bad.  Slayer pts rack up fast and larran keys and emblems aren’t too bad.
---
I prefer burstlimit
---
cool
---
Everyone here is right the pmod icon only shows there are unreal uim accounts that people don’t know are ultimates because of pmod status
---
I gave someone 1m in varrock in f2p when I was leaving for 2 weeks to a vacation.
---
bp is not worth it, use void and msb (i) with rune/amethyst arrows. Normal mode, usual bosses. 1hp is not needed with this method but you may want to bring super def pots to make your absorbs last longer
---
It’s only in lumbridge area so go literally anywhere else and your good

after you make your post, you comment a single letter (H for humour, A for achievement etc.) and the automod bot flairs the post for you and hides the comment.

Spade hunters only pick on targets that dont retaliate, ofc they are not going to risk item against well prepared pkers

Once you're below 0 going any lower doesn't help. Or are you suggesting everyone carries 20kg worth of items in their inventory?
---
Do you not see tekton's rock hard penis that swings down around his knees??? Or is that supposed to be his quad separation...?
---
I was in your shoes over a year ago and i has my doubts as well. I ended up doing it and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. After buying the bow I went on to make close to 500m in 3 months because I was super motivated to get my gear back. I mainly did zulrah and raids 1 and I can tell u it was a blast getting drops and buying my gear back piece by piece.
---
Why you gotta treat your butler like that.

I havent seen that episode in at least 5 years. I got it right away and and scared my dog from laughing. Well done

Yeah theres only like 7-8k max accounts, and I know atleast some of them wanting warding because it was more content and another number to get to 99

Jesus, the mental gymnastics. At this point you might as well just suggest a PK toggle so people can be completely safe in the wilderness at their leisure and bring whatever they want, whenever they want.

Alright fine I guess I’m someone that ships osrs boss relationships now. It’s cool.

Because he doesn't look like someone who has the teleport so he has to walk.
---
Sure, in that situation it's possible. But when people just say "lol obby cape and rapier stop using mommy's credit card," they're just being toxic. So as I said, it's entertaining to watch people immediately get toxic over what setup somebody is using. Wanting to help is great, but I'm not referring to people that are genuinely trying to provide information.

Id say i was pretty lucky, I know it says ‘rare’ on the wiki but no actual rates yet. It was 66.6m though after selling the new Dstone armors. Normal loot alone was 35.4m, w/ 10m spent on crystal keys(25.4m profit).
---
I would consider this more than a doodle
---
I mean, probably, but you can probably get by fine at almost any boss with revolution. The bigger issue for a bot is dealing with all the phases and mechanics all the rs3 bosses have, i think that'd be a lot harder for sure.
---
Hmm?
---
Super ranging pots usually work fine and let you be a lot more afk, but overloads would technically be slightly better xp per hour if you feel like paying more attention. Either works, it’s more of how much effort you want to put in. If you want you can still stay as close to 1hp as possible, it’s just not as big of a deal with normal monsters since they hit a lot less.
---
Alright settle down mate
---
My dad was a 10hp UIM
---
Separate instances for **anything** wouldn't be doable or pass a poll unless they removed the ability to ditch Iron Man status and made it permanent only.
---
Claw at 46 kc git gud
---
fun runecrafting
---
Wish they could fix mvp loot. Currently getting MVP gets you lower value loot than being runner up.
---
Lmfaoo truu
---
Thank you. I wonder how op is doing.
---
Eclectics
---
every computer has snipping tool
---
Time wise? Maybe yes. But it's also a skill that is giving you profit up till that point.
---
There's also slayer bosses that offer more gp/hr than this boss, with the same investment involved that unlocks thermy.
---
So it's not like you invest in 93 slayer and JUST get thermy out of it. SoTE you do.
---
Run faster
---
he's got the power of God and Anime on his side
---
For range you can also AFK in NMZ doing normal monsters with super ranging potions/absorption’s and a magic shortbow(i)/rune arrows and get around 40-60k xp an hour. It’s extremely AFK and pretty cheap and the xp rate is pretty good compared to other methods.
---
Under this new system I might actually spend the time to make a pking account. I have a 60 attack piety account actually built up decently right now so it'd be cool to have a reason to finish off all the skilling and training to make it actually competitive.
---
Exactly :c
---
i rarely get MVP i didnt know that
---
it's not very funny even with context
---
Can we just make it one of those moving sidewalks so I can afk my way to Kourend?
---
I am 23/25 with 660KC....  
---
Damn, u mean i have 879 chests more to go? GASP
---
How about doing some bosses? DK's? barrows? Heck i can even try and take you to bandos or zammy
---
Ah the ignorance of people who haven't done Desert Pleasure.

I want to fuck that demon

Damnit, he stole a minute of my life too. I saw words, but I didn't understand anything.

Right? Who would've thought Zalcano and Tekton could be so cute? Great work Zuhaar! :)
---
Yup, that explains it.... the loot doesn't add up.  
---
958KC x 150scales (being modest here) = **AT LEAST** 143k scales.
---
u dont have to learn it, just watch the pattern while its open in a pdf and kill it, after like 50 kills u will know the pattern by heart

easy

Not put my protect item up while hopping in rev cave skulled with zgs.....
---
RIP zgs
---
hahaha, and I'm still suffering with a stupid obby chest because I'm too broke to do the same :'(
---
Nice source on that ironman claim. There is no way its 1%.
---
What are they asking?
---
At least it isn't a mundane grind to play lms like kicking monks are, you need some serious skills to get the best xp rates
---
Lol no its just butthurt pvmers that don't want to risk anything and get nothing but rewards like they use to. The game switched from pvp focus to pvm and that is why pvmers can sway poll, there are more now because pvp doesn't get any updates except broken weapons being added.
---
I'm all for dungeoneering, however it's not a skill, it should be added as a raid. Dungeoneering and slayer to me, should never of been named skills.
---
I don't have a fighter hat because of no reason
---
Ill fucking commit to that
---
If you're using abby dagger then fighter torso with obby legs would be better. Obby should only be used with the full set + berserker necklace
---
Why not combine staff of dead, void knight mace, and maybe another 200 points?
---
Woops, my bad. I misinterpreted for Nightmare Zone somehow. But you can disregard what I said. Strange indeed.
---
stick it out for the elite diary progress
---
No
---
Other way round bro
---
If I were you I would look up speedkills of the bosses and weigh them by that, and optionally you could weigh slayer task only ones higher because they take longer to get

Considering how important beer is to sailors, I feel like the big pub should be a little bit more central, like a bit further north west, right on the edge of the water and easily accessible by everyone wherever they are
---
This is the guy they call when they say they're going to beat the devil out of you.
---
Of course carebears don't. Its like saying there should be no skilling or pvm because I don't think it affects content. The truth is pvp vastly affects the economy and is such a gold sink that it would cripple the economy if people stopped using consumables. Basically pvp is the incentive that gives most items monetary value. All these 2012ers thinking they know what is good for the game when people that been playing for 17+ years like myself literally seen the game evolve then devolve.

Never stop flexing

I used to make Skyrim memes like you, but then I took an OS to the RS.

---
in lore they are brother in sister so... maybe dont.
---
What reasons beside going back to 1 def are there?
---
Raids require high stats. I want a low level cooperative thing to do.
---
Powerlifting doesn’t involve Overhead Press. Strongman does.
---
Why?
---
FYI lore says they are brother and sister.
---
For a main the rune pouch is something you buy off the ge for a mil or whatever. What regular account actually gets all 24 emblems themselves, really?
---
For irons it's a long grind doing wildy Slayer, which is awful since wildy content is miserable in an ironman, or an absurdly long grind doing regular slayer.
---
lmfao jagex loading the RNG to get your 10k
---
Also, I’m willing to wait years without any updates to get it done.
---
ommmmggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg thankyou for bring back those memories
---
I'm trying to play the game, but either I play in a super small window or I play on fullscreen but with awfully small HUD. Is there a way to play this game with decent resolution without changing the resolution of the whole PC?

I'm glad you left it

Same. I've been saving my afkable skills for classic
---
Good one buddy! You got me!
---
Is the stuffed bear supposed to be Callisto? Lmao
---
They want to nerf everything.
---
For the granite maul, it's not even nerfing....  
---
Basically nerf g maul's spec to 60% spec bar from 50%.... then add an item that once u attach it it will go back down to 50%. Adding an extra step for the heck of it.
---
Damn  boi....that's some luck
---
Strongman is literally carry heavy shit of different shapes (sandbags, stones, racks, etc) for distance and time. How is that less functional that doing snatches or cleans in positions you’d never be in outside a competition???
---
I go out of my way who have vulgar and disrespectful comments. Thanks man. It’s one thing to debate but another just to shoot down ones idea
---
Sauce?

its a shame the render distance ruins the whole city
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
You will be able to use them for a limited amount of time

It's not difficult to spot, but if your semi AFK this helps a lot.

Holy fuck that’s dedication dude. Im impressed!

Fair enough, good tip for multitaskers!

Tbh, that's not bad. I personally have only like 2 other flexes on my account and nothing else lmao.
---
Are you paranoid schizophrenic?

Thermy loot is just shit in general tbf, even compared to other slayer bosses.
---
What do you train on for medium clue scroll drops? (Kinda new to the game, sorry if it’s a dumb question)
---
I going too do this
---
Yeah my account is pretty rough lol, think my best luck was at CoX early on but an 80 dry streak made up for that pretty quick lol.
---
Pretty sure i've been getting around 15k mining, 3k smithing, and 2k rc xp/hr from Zalc
---
If the boss was almost an exact copy of another boss then yes I would probably vote no. Sorry to go against the "new skill pls, who cares if it's actually good" hivemind.

As with all things, it's nuanced. Rounded is far more dangerous if you're lifting heavy. If you're a weakling you aren't going to pull enough weight to herniate or smash anything.
---
Zuhaar never fails to disappoint
---
If you have been paying for 1 membership for OSRS since release in 2013 and you aren't grandfathered in then you have spent $720. 
---
 Over the next 10 years, you will pay $1320 dollars while he spends $600. That is if they keep membership at $11 for the next decade.  
---
Total price for your 16 years of membership: $2040
---
Total price for his 25 years of membership: $1500
---
I'd say he is winning.
---
2t teaks you have 2 birds alternating attacking you.

It would be nice if the filter had different levels. I agree that there should be an option to limit more hateful words like slurs while being able to see curses or such.
---
Idk MATE warding’s body is just a little too warm still
---
To the top!
---
Just use slurs yourself, against them, r u new?
---
Trying to learn zulrah, over 100 tries and still can’t kill him. I need tips, using a rotation sheet helps to a certain degree but doesn’t exactly help with building the muscle memory. Any tips would be great.

90 mage, 90 def, 88 range.
---
Definitely voting yes cuz u guys failed 2 skills polls and paying venuzalens to make accounts to vote yes to all these nerfs
---
You know....we never hear from giants. We interact with ogres, goblins, etc, but never giants. Maybe a new quest line?
---
You're getting downvoted because you're just wrong lol. Most joint issues are caused by genetics and can be exacerbated by lifting (Ronnie Coleman), but lifting itself, with proper form, actually strengthens your joints. Stop making excuses for being a weak ass man.

Or play for just 4 more minutes goddamnit

That would be dope. Kind of like khazard armor

---
I thought the whole point of playing as an ironman was to make the game harder, so why should there be updates to help make the game easier for them ?
---
Similar thing with pures, I think the coolest thing about 1 defence pures is that they have never missclicked or w/e trained defence, and yea if they do ruin their account why shouldn't they just make a new one? I mean these guys are playing OSRS, not like they have anything better to do.
---
 How many of those restrictions are _actually_ impeding on your gameplay though? Which ones specifically?
---
they're siblings, aren't they?
---
Full dharoks would be best. Use overload potion and get your hp to 1 then just flick hitpoint restore so you don't regenerate hp

1 Kc black mask (was exciting at the time) and 2 kc magic fang!

---
Tbh that's cool as hell that theory and simulation came to the same answer. Awesome job OP.
---
Gotcha. I was thinking bandos + whip would be best because bandos attack str bonus, and whip because insane dps. Do you have a suggestion on the top bosses I should fight against, which give quickest xp?
---
Nonono, it depends on the skill level distribution :3
---
get base 55s
---
Cant use glory to panic tele out of edge anymore. I look away after teleporting and look back and im dead because i used a spear spec seconds before. Anglars in combat for multi pking. I used to make baby pures in like an hour to pk like every month. Cant loot on pvp wo4lds untill it shows up for everyone. Crystal shi3lds dont stack. People cant tag raggers off you in pvp worlds or bh anymore. I could go on for ages but im working rn.
---
Let's not forget that he started the Potato Only HCIM series. Give me more than 5 series that is more grindy than that.
---
It's because people were on their alts luring targets. Then they'd have their max main waiting to kill them when they tele up. It was just so abused, and this is their way of solving it.
---
I don't know what I'm looking at but this is art.
---
They always use the worst naruto opening for this meme
---
&gt;Also I don't get why you're bringing any brews/restores at all for a clue.  It's just a clue.
---
then how do you deal with enemies like the triple purple mages?
---
Just did cooking doesn't take too much capital and doing sharks you will make money. You need cooking gauntlets and Hodisius favour to use the Hodisius kitchen for lowest burn rate but it's worth it.

added. Mines “mellow mood”

I feel like the only reason people think it's OP is because it puts skilling closer in GP/hr to pre-raid PvM and even then even pre-raid PvM is better.

---
ohh oversight on my part lol
---
Can we swap, I've gotten like 10 crier hats from 55 or so fucking clues, its insane
---
How.. i said 5% and i can tell you right now 95% of pkers arnt in bh or pvp worlds.

Yeah its been fucky all day, working fine last night. Earlier this morning I could connect to certain worlds fine, and others would DC me. I had to really struggle just to get in to the game. Now I can't connect at all. Tried a whole array of stuff, reset internet, added runelite to my firewall, and i still can't launch OSRS on the official client, runelite, or osbuddy. Hopefully someone here knows about networking and solves this

Holy fuck.. it got worse and worse each time I read it..

Now someone explain why it's intentional?
---
These have been around for a long time. They have tons of viewer bots and twitch can't really do anything except ban them. They are on the OSRS and RS3 streams almost 24/7.
---
AKA the only reason I haven't leveled agility in fucking months! My *favourite!*
---
thanks mom, i love you
---
On task with the best gear it's up there in the 5m/hr average mark, so it's on par with raids.
---
You can literally put MMK's faceoverlay on any piece of gameplay and I will laugh.
---
Never keep chucking lol
---
I will never understand why people turn authenticator off. You are just asking to get compromised sooner or later.
---
Thanks just wanted that clarified
---
logs been out ever since I started then!

&gt; Would be no different ot the fact you can do BA
---
Depends what kind of rewards show up in those loot boxes.
---
get firecape
---
Just got 99 about a month ago and I did amethyst javelin heads all the way. Sold them for about a 5-10% loss and just did agility while they sold. If I were to do it again the javelin heads alch for a small profit. Each amethyst goes for about 3500 and each javelin head alchs at 912, so you’d be fairly close to breaking even and likely be close to 99 mage when you finish crafting
---
Yeah, people get salty over people crashing, but i love pvm crash fights. rs is pretty rng based so even if your gear isn't top of the line, you have pretty good odds of securing a kill, so whenever someone is crashing i'm pretty confident. Then there's a bunch of shit you can do, like trying to force bandos on the void crasher, then see them planking to a 50 melee. And sniping tassets right under their faces, makes for some quality rs content.
---
have you been watching fake boaty stream?
---
I mean these things are all over the place. They do it with framed, woox, boaty, the weekly jmod  stream, he’ll ive even seen them do it with ffxiv streams.

Trust me, we all already know lol

REAL
---
unironically ye
---
Can't imagine!
---
Filter uims, then filter with 1 def. Then sort by highest slayer level
---
Just depends on the player and how much gp he has. I use this method and this method only and that’s just because I can afford to use the pots and it’s the fastest method to kill them.
---
I upvoted this
---
I only need it do it once as it's the only thing I have left for the medium diary but don't want to mess anyone up by being new to the game.  Maybe I'll even enjoy it like some other minigames and try to learn all the roles.
---
you’re after runelite’s resizeable mode
---
Let this be a lesson to you to keep it on.
---
Once you start putting points into the roles it becomes so much more enjoyable
---
VERY yes

Tbow multiplies damage based off magic level and vorkath is one of the few pvm money makers where tbow is not bis.

I want to finish RFD first then I'll get back to diaries and give it a shot.  It looks kinda cool from youtube videos.
---
By far the strangest god in video games I've come across.
---
Oh. I thought it was a troll post bc a lot of people want black chide top nerfed (I personally think it needs to stay how it is). 
---
So yeah, when you ask “hey what’s good for mage def” after a lot of.... “discussions” on black dhide top almost felt too aware
---
You are at a slump when it comes to slayer. Push through, get bank and everything will feel better in a little while
---
each shard right now (using magic pots as the solution) makes about 3600gp/4 or about 9k gp per shard, so you can assume each elven crystal key is 1110k (roughly).  20k gp for a crystal key and 90k gp for the value of the shards   
---
690 x 110k is 75.9m  
---
So assuming the values of the loot tracker are correct, you only made 31.3m when you could have potentially made 62.1m   
---
If you want to take it a step further, you get .5 xp per dose of magic potion (78 herblore req) which means 5 herblore exp per shard. This means 34.5k herblore exp missed out on (6.9k shards x 5). Past level 70 herblore, the gp/xp is 13 gp/xp or 16gp/xp depending on if you make magic potions or brews. So that's another 500k or so missed out on from herblore exp.
---
Yup, i get that perfectly. But the way i saw things, posting this on reddit and **not** reporting him in-game is worse kind of snitching than just reporting. OP's downvotes and the others' comments really seem to suggest this
---
UwU
---
exp is almost entirely based off of how many blasted ores you put in the sack so efficiency is quite important - you also have to concentrate for a longer time than with other mining methods because missing ticks during the chiseling/blasting process can lead to dynamite or ore despawning
---
I did about 2 hours of 8-shot blast mining earlier this week and found that at 75 mining I was barely getting 50k xp/hr (along with 15k firemaking xp/hr) and was profiting about 200k gp/hr including the cost of dynamite. I think the profit is lower than people expect because Zalcano has caused ore prices to drop around the board
---
I'd recommend learning Volcanic Mine if you have the time, as it's a great low-intensity way to train mining - or if you don't want to, the gem mine below Shilo Village is also good exp and better profit than blast mine, at least around 75 mining

Check out bud brigade cc
---
Gratz bro! One question regarding the Yanillian hops. Did you prot them or used ultra compost? Im 89 farming atm and curious whats the best. Thanks in advance!
---
That isn't accurate at all. Zulah has easily been 3m+ an hour for a very long time, might be a bit less these days with some price dips... but still not even close to 1m/hr.
---
Because you can evade a ice barrage + teleblock :)
---
Why should the wilderness be limited to PKers?
---
There was an unintended bug introduced to the wiki article when crystal seeds were removed. It should be fixed now and is ~500k more per hour.
---
I see no reason to ever go into the wilderness. Poll it out of the game.
---
Tek gonna need to ask daddy zuks permission to smash
---
Experiencing catching chins in the Wildy *is* what you are describing in your entire whining paragraph. That's Wilderness content for you - big possible reward, but again, risk of being killed. Beautiful way to balance content if you ask me. 
---
If you dislike PvP, don't opt for the content that is specifically placed in the PvP area (and more importantly, don't come crying on the forums afteewards).
---
So I can't do content in a skill that has nothing to do with PKing unless I become susceptible to PKers.... Hmmm
---
is it my turn to post this yet?
---
Have you ever considered... Looking it up
---
Have you done varrock medium diaries?
---
To be fair, you are the one complaining about being PKed in a PvP area... Honestly, what kind of responses did you expect from this post?
---
The wiki assumes a low amount of kills per hour. Check the wiki article on zulrah as a money making method.
---
Yeah...
---
It's not - hence why there is content in the wilderness for everyone.
---
I took a pic of that place too! Also ran into a guy chopping maples with a max cape for the scenery while I was doing a clue https://i.imgur.com/YlrmCCp.png?1
---
the wiki does not focus at all on optimal rates for pvm. if you want max effort setups/kill stats etc check out the gear discord run by oblv.
---
it displeases me they go by some really arbitrary "average player" thing instead of just listing max kills/hr and gross value per kill.
---
I actually have [evidence](https://i.imgur.com/R7WEGAw.png) for this.

Looks like another unpolled change to the Elven Quest Line.

[*The ICU Team are looking at it and they are getting banned.*](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/467120056?t=01h05m42s)

I went through my ignore list searching Every.Single.Account on the highscores and removed the ones that were 'removed from highscores'. 
---
The Red Square on the right shows all the accounts that were reported in the past and that currently remain on my ignore list, and I decided to do a larger check today, and well yeah. 
---
**They are banning some accounts.** 
---
I have no proof these are bots other than the stats and that they're 'camping' Zulrah and I could be wrong for some accounts.
---
Jagex. You shouldn't have to have your paying customers (playerbase) reporting these bots for you.
---
tell that to my no zulrah ironman, there's alot of stuff people tell me i can't do and never will be able to without a blowpipe
---
Zulrah bots. Price of scales are veeery low, used to be stable 200ish gp per scale, now its 150. Price of scales also affects the price of uniques AAAND vorkath and zalcano, new bosses which share some of zulrahs side drops, like grapes (used to be 250, now 86 gp/each) chaos runes (from 99gp each to 76 gp) law runes (fromm 200 to 150) and the good ol onyx which. So yea, bots and jagex killed zulrah
---
Dream bigger.
---
Dank gets cured, not ripened.
---
It’s like somewhere there’s some code that’s supposed to turn on which allows for a unique, and these people didn’t get it turned on. Suddenly they post, Jagex sees it, and quickly corrects it
---
Watch a youtube vid which shows you which tiles to use and you just repeat the identical process every round
---
Yah
---
ooft
---
Correct, the daily mail (as you can see in the corner on the meme) is a shit tabloid and never gets anything correct. Pulling planes and lifting atlas stones like the one the guy is holding is 100% strongman and most definitely not powerlifting.
---
&gt; join a squad of people that know what their doing
---
if they know what they're doing, they would have a squad already.
---
Interesting thought but a word of advice; if youre going to suggest something to Jagex maybe try not insulting them in the first sentence
---
Lolz
---
You could make get lifetime membership in an hour at the GE

Vet’ion comes to mind
---
yeah, negatively, you absolute banana peel
---
loser
---
Changing the pvm meta that has existed for 15 years. "small game updates" btw
---
How long will the beta be out for?
---
There are beta worlds, I’d say if you’re familiar with Vet’ion, and it’s mechanics, go try it out and see how different it is.
---
Genuine question; if everything drops onyx bolt tips, but noone uses them, why are they still so valuable?
---
Currently in the live game the line of attack between two points is not symmetrical. What this beta does is make that symmetrical. It doesnt mean you can see further or click further. Its a combat related algorithm.  The place where it will effect is PvP where players are able to stand in specific spots in relation to their opponent and not be able to attack back.
---
In theory this is the only thing it should really effect, but in order to allow people to understand or have a look for themselves this is why the beta is active for players to go and see for themselves.
---
I do not mind getting clues etc from skilling, but I do hate getting beginner clues all the time. Anyway to turn that option off while still receiving the other clues from skilling?
---
Nice! Hardest part done
---
 Q
---
Also good for ourania altar runecrafting. I wouldn't use it at vorkath.
---
Grats, man guys what are we doing wrong me and a friend keep doing one raid 2 hours. at olm we die each 1-2 times. current KC is 16 ^^
---
any tips?
---
Can someone post a mirror, ironically it cannot be watched from weeabooland.
---
Really the only thing at the moment is a portal room with some teleports and a mounted glory. The items with a +5 stew boost and a crystal saw are the occult altar and ornate rejuvination pool (82), top tier jewellry box (83) and portal nexus (84). The first three are absolutely amazing and definitely worth grinding out once you can afford the planks while the nexus is more quality of life.
---
Probably from membership trials
---
Ideally the only thing it affects is one-way safespots. If that's all it does, it seems that what they put in there is enough.
---
&gt; Why would you ever mine for ores when Zalcano is a big loot pinata that showers you with hundreds of ores and bars a kill? 
---
Thats is true for all pvm
---
Is this some kind of casual joke that I'm too high level to understand?
---
How are they above 99?
---
You can buy 4 players and they will carry you while you afk and pay them gold
---
Part of the problem with that in Runescape specifically is that you can use it to try and work out certain patterns that get picked up, after being reported to develop the software further to prevent bans
---
Appreciate you taking the time to check it out. Let us know if you have any feedback!
---
You pay a team of nerds 20-30m to carry you through each wave until you have enough points for a torso.
---
If you don't do them, you will never get another drop if you have it in your bank or inventory. So just file it away somewhere in the bank and forget about it forever.
---
You fucks should have listened...
---
Ya dont say
---
I've never done it before but would love to get my torso, pm me if you wanna do some! :)
---
That's not a bad idea, but you're turning an almost guaranteed 70k+ slayer task, plus larrans key loot risk of up to 300k, plus normal loot, into no guarantee, and the massively increase in camping of those 3 spots. Larrans keys are okay now as no one camp's them because most pvmers don't think they're worth the risk. Either a new slayer alternative to emblems should be on the drop table or perhaps it should work in a simar way where you can get bh points/rewards (at a similar scale to what a tier 1 could get you currently.... Thus linking pvp and pvm rewards.
---
The larrans key will just mean less people do wildy slayer. Ergo less pvmers to pk.
---
Yea I miss his content
---
I feel that too hard.
---
I think I’m at about 50 tasks now without Black Demons
---
Just to clarify that these changes are only on the beta worlds right now, so if I wanted to do MM2 or level thieving right now all the current strategies still work?
---
All that means is I *really* need to finish MM2.
---
I’m glad they did this change too. I tweeted that suggestion out to Ash on the 26th of July and he said he’d be up for it if it were made retrievable. It’s great that they went through with it not long after!
---
Gotta get 75% to pass those slayer polls.
---
Its kind of hard to skill with huge lvl differences, but reply with your runescape name and I'll add you.  I dont mind giving you advice and talking when I'm on, but idk if we'd actually skill together.
---
I wonder who decided that ultimate strength icon would be a good  indicator for sacrifice
---
Absolutely add me: dorf main
---
bro you just made because of two overweight 42 years old males are having a relationship through the java game from 2006 bro just deal with it
---
You can just bank inventories of eclectic imp jars and bank stand open them for clues. Still takes a good while to catch 28 imps, but you can spawn camp them and get a few in a row. Much more efficient than doing 1 clue per poro visit.
---
Create a bot that creates obvious bots then create a bot to report those bots and get free membership to bot with.
---
This ones difficult obviously and I'm not sure. Maybe a blood money type of currency again that can be used to get those non tradable supplies? I really dont think that EVERYONE would flock to do lms for a few hours to go get some sharks and potions to pk with. It would either be for lower/newer players, or it would just be dead content. But I like the idea if its fine tuned.
---
Because it isn't meant to be hugely game impacting. All it is supposed to is fix PvP one way spots.
---
yes but im not getting 100ms to australia anymore, currently its 300ms how are you getting 100?
---
As an ironman 400kc without a dex, i third this.
---
Hey I've got an idea, how about some sort of a "trade limit"? Would have to do away with Wilderness but I'm sure people wouldn't mind.
---
You can't karate chop a tree in half, what are you a pussy?
---
I don't wanna dox myself but my country is one of your neighbors, Ill be honest I haven't done a ping check in a while but it was 100 for sure at least a week ago
---
The second sentence looks wrong to me ?
---
Focus on learning the rotations and which tiles you want to be using, after you've got that down then focus on the switches &amp; damage.  You'll very likely die a bit learning but just don't get mad because literally everyone has been fragged **hard** at one point by zul lmao
---
I hate you too *proceeds to cry in a bathroom*
---
.. did you even stop to think that quite a few of these could be dedicated zulrah alt accounts?
---
I don't have anyone to share it with my mom died after maxin her credit card. RIP
---
Is that dude still at it?
---
Again, in English.
---
Xx Itachi xX ...... oof
---
i see im in malaysia and its not possible to get below 300 here, and like i said its not my connection ive done a speedtest and a latency check imgur link in the post
---
Full guthans hasn't been meta since afking NMZ/Bandits for 6 hours lol wtf you talking about?
---
I found out today that if you cut logs in priff you get crystal shards passively. It's slow but it's kinda neat that things I had to do elsewhere now give me crystal key upgrades
---
He's 5k master clues dry of the bloodhound atm
---
That doesn’t mean you make less because you got MVP. You still get an extra roll. It has 0 effect on your regular rolls. I don’t get why people keep saying this.
---
Because I can't afford the crystal shards at the moment. Just asking if someone else is interested as well. I don't know why people are hating on me for this, if you don't want to do it then just don't send a response.
---
Love the fixing of Line of Sight to remove one way safe spots. Are these changes also implemented in the new LMS beta as well?
---
I don't understand why you removed the Occult though. A 4-way switch with amulet seriously increased the skill cap, and made using magic for DPS actually viable. Now it's going to go right back to the bolt ragging with non-stop melee meta with no one even bothering to pray magic.
---
Project leader at civil engineering  firm, i do about 2 ish hours afking on most days. But there are long busy weeks where i have no time for rs.
---
What proof do you have that these are botters? Looks to me like you're just reporting everyone who kills money snake with magic.
---
That demo is brilliant please add to rest of wiki &lt;3
---
i got lvl 5 all + torso in like 9h ppl exaggerate how bad it is
---
You can practice triple jads for free. Which saves a lot of attempts.
---
I'm interested to know if jagex staffs gets benefits/incentives proportional to increasing the number of memberships...
---
If so, we could have a corrupt setup for them to design all p2p free promos without any requeriment like completing dragon slayer..
---
I guess I should've shared more of my stats because I'm a long way from any of the things mentioned here. Later game farming with lunars and bottomless bucket etc. sure seems to make sense, but right now I'm only level 20 farming, 50 magic, less than 1000 total, and like 90 quest points. Obviously I'm continuing to do more quests and will get a bunch of farming XP from that and various other helpful unlocks but want to still be able to do half decent herb runs.
---
I'd pay for this
---
Jagex have outlined these changes are only intended to impact PvP, and the reason they have the beta worlds is to make sure they don't impact anything else.
---
How come you don't play it in Rs3? Legacy mode is a thing.
---
Of course nothing is free, but you aren't getting anything out of this worth any gp in return. Costed me less than 50k to learn Chambers of Xeric, costed me nothing to learn the Gauntlet, costed me a few hundred k of death fees to properly learn Vorkath post quest, costed like 25k to learn zulrah, but at least I'm getting something back in return that can increase my bank value except for the 200k in pots/scales to learn fight caves. While I agree it shouldn't be free to learn Inferno and you should be losing some gp, its not fun when your 10m cash stack can be gone in just a few hours of attempts.
---
This game has 24 underpaid developers. Many of them don't work on anticheating. I'm surprised they are even doing this well.
---
They're live?
---
When your salaried it's saves to go at home
---
Yes. Go to login screen, and it’s the blue highlighted worlds

🦀DELETE MONEY SNAKE🦀
---
I dolo it with 2 accounts and its around 7m/h. U need max gear on both accounts to get that much money
---
What do you mean? I don't think I will have much problems with the Jads as I've watched videos and practiced quick flicks in sync with videos, but the waves before are quite challenging for myself as I'm just too demotivated trying.
---
Why dont u join us in ParadoxCC \^.\^ have fun with us skilling/socializing/pvming every1 there is happy to help and we have a nice discord server which is always active
---
The solution is prosperity irl so there are no poorfags irl doing this for a living.
---
Prospects are bad on that tho
---
I borrowed dhcb and full arma about 2 years ago from someone that's basically been on a 2 year break since then. Should I get banned?
---
GE and slayer expansions helped make the game feel less like and MMO and more like an achievement conveyor belt for me. Not arguing against you because those aren't your opinions, but it is what it is.
---
Pid swap is completely up to the game (there are a few ways to try to force change Pid like stopping your attack and delaying it one tick and such) but is no more bug abuse than tick manipulating skilling. It's not bannable as it is just part of game mechanics. Just using it to your advantage. Sometimes Pid does switch mid combat but nothing to worry about in the sense of being banned.
---
He's just manipulating you into returning his loss.
---
lol ok
---
Dates for the beta?
---
Trident of the seas. There are is also trident of the seas (e) which can hold more charges. 
---
The upgraded versions are trident of the swamp, which has higher accuracy, max hit, and can venom, but also requires a zulrah scale per cast.
---
Will this also affect safe spots in the inferno?
---
I suck at defender but i managed to do it anyway, got torso on 4 accounts
---
Morytania hard diaries are worth doing if you are gonna grind Barrows.  And Idk how you are losing money, I've only done, like 100kc but I made upwards of 4-5m(though with hard diaries and 3 uniques I believe).  
---
I read your other comments and you seem to be doing the run itself pretty well, but just been unlucky I guess.    I'd say keep doing it unless you have another moneymaker because Barrows is still like 500k an hour from the runes alone most of the time if you are doing enough runs per hour.
---
Auntie Mabel has been way luckier than this at arma
---
League of legends has a system that when you log in, you are often given a message thanking you for reporting someone, that the person got punished. Knowing that i did something to better this community is much better than what we have.
---
Just checked, unfortunately I only have 70 magic, being 5 levels from the required 75 :(
---
Wow. I got my rangers on my 3rd clue.
---
&gt;If we had access to the inferno on beta worlds then I guarantee the infernal cape market would drop drastically.
---
Holy fuck you are dumb. Typical retard pvper. Good thing ur never getting the cape you autist fuck.
---
Vhelm , zammy blessing,  karil top , tassy , tant whip , dfs , fury/tort ,  prims , zerkr ring , barrows  gloves and bgs for spec
---
Is there a way to get untradable items on the beta servers? Such as hydra tail to make the prayer necklace or boss heads for slayer helm recolor. 
---
For some reason, Serp helm has its variants but no other iirc.
---
Just something cool i think should be added :)
---
Dont forget fire cape as well
---
You use archer ring at hydra dont you?
---
Yes but sometimes the DPS roles get ahead of themselves and click the boss as soon as it spawns, not giving the tank the chance to get aggro
---
Well now I do know I didn't need this sea shanty remix
---
yeh im doin it but gonna take 8000 hrs
---
Barrows r ez gp ! And if r into higher tear pvming feel free to join us in ParadoxCC :D social/pvm/skilling clan
---
Bondzzzz
---
99 slayer before from trials
---
Just got expert gloves. Feels good man
---
pretty sure they are gonna unlock it in the future to the players that have completed it the Inferno on the real servers.
---
1,33(3)M per kill lol
---
Pick your own teams and don’t pick noobs. It’s not that bad, I got lvl 5 all roles that way.
---
Im just being realistic :D the boss is REAL easy compared to other similar moneymakers and all the other drops kinda fit well in with the smithing/crafting theme. In my experience onyx bolt tips makes up for at least 25%of the total profit (not counting shards or uniques)
---
It is going to get nerfed, and the most useless drop for the economy as a whole is definatly this "camouflaged cash" drop that they put on every new droptable instead of pure gp..

It's like the old days of watching fifa videos.
---
Yes, i used to do that. I was in a dark place.
---
There are definitely some that will try, but as long as you wear tank gear they should never really kill you. Sometimes pkers won’t attack me and will even have a conversation with me. I think most of them would rather fight someone who fights back.
---

I'm on a Galaxy S7 and mine are at the edges. Screen too large maybe?

How does it devalue the cape by getting it on the test server if it won't transfer to main though? It still requires time, just because someone can complete it with max combat/tbow on test server doesn't mean that they will be able to get the cape on the main game where it counts.
---
Should reverse the meme to show the perspective of the people of the outside world.
---
Get rid of RC you say? Hmmm....
---
It's the hardest to master. Definitely not easier than Attacker and Collector.
---
Sayed god damn you. I want that mutagen so fn badly. Maybe proof read what you are censoring in the future.
---
I'm slowly chipping away at it. Just finished my first elites being lumby. Close to morytania and karamja now
---
and my axe! 3k kc no mutagen
---
zulrah is still easily 3m/h if you do like 30 kills/h, ofcourse if you're low lvl and barely get 10-15 kills the profit is a lot lower.
---
Any people from aus/nz willing to take 0kc to ToB?
---
Yes, you can have a gold farm account and transfer the wealth to your main. Virtually all of the top streamers have alts running to generate gp passively.
---
max cape is way grindier than his potato only hcim lol
---
Because you will be better equipped with the mechanics to complete it on your own build. Experience tops gear in all aspects. Have you learned nothing from our lord woox soloing stuff with flowers and only using potatoes to survive vs corp? Why do you forsake him so.
---
Some people run all of their internet traffic through a vpn for security, using one isn’t an indication of anything else
---
Best of luck with the grind! Lumby is a good one to get done, the ring is great! Plus no need for a staff at fairy rings is so good! You're close to morytania and karamja?! You animal.
---
This is awesome
---
How do you afk guardians?
---
Some of these dudes have way past 99 in ranged/magic. What kind of requirement do you think will deter them if they're willing to get up to 30M exp in a single skill?
---
I can get behind that.
---
[deleted]
---
How do you know he’s not practicing lol
---
I appreciate your cautiousness. I've moved that and even much higher amounts of GP before and every time it feels risky even though I know I'm not doing anything wrong. I'd rather see 10 bots go free than 1 legit player get wrongfully banned.
---
Keep them and use them
---
The argument that more pvmers should vote yes because pkers will focus on BH is a bad one.
---
The BH rework will bring in more people into the pking community and pvmers will likely have to deal with more pkers after the initial hype of BH dies down.
---
I’m not telling you how to vote I’m merely pointing out that it may make pvming even more cancer in the wildy.
---
Didnt see guardians sorry. Guardians are a horrible comparison cause no one does them or kraken for gp/h . If all Skilling updates had to be on par to them money wise then they wouldn't ever be done.
---
Did you see and pick up all those nests?
---
First I always thought I missed the second one, but then I realized RuneLite put’s in a second notification when afk.
---
😥 F for my man Lennie
---
 at abyssal sire make us able to re-stun (reset sleeping timer) before he wakes up so we can kill the respitaroy systems quicker and not need to wait untill he wakes up so we can stun then go to the next group of respiratory systems or else we wait 10 seconds for nothing
---
With bank pin and hopping and then hopping back to get stuff. It seems like it longer and more of a pain.
---
I don’t know, I thought barb assault wasn’t tooo bad. I mean it could be better, people could be a lot less selfish and help out more. But I don’t think it’ll ever top being as bad as fightcaves are for me. I cannot get a firecape for the life of me. I just don’t know how to prayer flick.
---
But he's saying it could effect things in a negative way without it being a bug but rather instead with the regular intended effect of it.
---
I wouldn't say that the firecape market is "booming" at all. I know of a lot more players that have purchased infernal capes than fire capes since the inferno's release.
---
The beta servers aren't available for long, so personally I don't see the issue. It's better to let players practise legitimately for free, rather than allow sellers to make hundreds, if not thousands a day.
---
The inferno is daunting in itself and disheartening when you've invested into a twisted bow, spent weeks learning the mechanics, spent a fortune in supplies &amp; keep on failing, when you can pay somebody else to do it with an armadyl crossbow on the first attempt for a third of the investment.
---
can just use ranged, it's incredibly overpowered even at low level
---
nah eoc takes the cake
---
DAT’s why he got killed with the quickness
---
Hmm okay I understand it now, thanks for the clarification. I did not meet with this occurrence since I'm not a PvP er myself but makes sense now.
---
More serious than your comment.
---
Ppl that **are capable** of learning inferno and getting their cape on their own don't care about supply cost, its a non issue.
---
Ppl that buy capes are *incapable* of getting it.
---
Quit being a baby and get good.
---
lmfao
---
I'm not going into the "I've got nothing to hide, vpns should be banned" discussion.
---
So you wanted free practice and got disappointed?
---
This is why, in my opinion, we need progressive RNG. Not to make things easier to obtain, but to clip the tail end of normal distributions that are bound to house ridiculous outliers considering population size. We've got 15x rate after 200M exp, but that's honestly a tremendously shitty solution that basically no one ever benefits from.
---
I'm at roughly the same odds with a skilling pet: Over 180M exp across Runecraft, Agility, Mining, Firemaking, Hunter, Fishing, Thieving, Woodcutting and Farming (all 99+). Calculating it straight up, it's actually lower at 99.93% chance of having a pet by now, but some exp I got as bonus (infernal axe/harpoon, questing, etc.) so it's probably closer to just 99.5%.
---
Yet everyone I talk about pRNG to tells me I'm entitled for trying to make pets more common. :)
---
sometimes he would turn his private chat on and then off again real quick and I would try and send him a pm
---
"Supposed" is the key word.
---
This is the company that put a fucking Twisted Bow spawn into the live game remember.
---
Odds are it's going to affect so much other shit that they didn't know existed or didn't even think about.
---
Whoever owns that domain is a literal legend
---
What is your prayer level? I am around 74 and typically only use like 1 or 2 food a run if that.
---
yeah would like to see too.
---
That's like when super Christian people try to get around the no sex before marriage thing by doing oral and anal. Like okay there I'm sure God is okay with anal before marriage...
---
It's also based on report volume and other factors such as pings and the amount of (non-constructive) messages sent in a game (bonus points for containing trigger words) as there is generally a correlation between spamming the chat and running it down. It is obviously much harder to get restricted if you spam passive aggressive messages with ":)" at the end of them, but that being said, it's also a lot less toxic than busting out [ol' reliable](https://i.imgur.com/0elv06K.jpg)
---
Most interfaces stall actions, and are cancelled by combat. The world map was re-added in oldschool and was implemented differently from older ones such as the report screen, skill guides, reading a book, activating a locked prayer, etc.
---
I mean his logic isn't wrong. The odds off flipping heads or tails for the last flip is 50/50.   
---
However the odds of getting 4999 rolls with no heads is like .00000000000000000000000000000001  
---
So that means his odds of getting at least one heads is .999999999999999999999999999999999999999  
---
In runescape you calculate chance by at least one drop in 5000. OP has already stated that 4999 tails are heads.   
---
Kacy technically still only has a 1/1000 chance to get it on the next roll. 
---
OP is just using the wrong stats, as we calculate her odds of getting it from the beginning, not the from the next roll
---
Thank you yeah I had a little giggle after seeing the totem drop
---
BA services prices are steep but avoiding this headache is completely worth it.
---
I don't get what's going on? Are there bots at Zulrah?
---
/u/Fe_jk 's observation also fails to account for population size. It's normal that there are more people dry of a Dragon warhammer than people dry of a Bloodhound: there are *way, way* more people attempting to get a DWH than a BH.
---
Runescape is intended as a grind in general so that's a pointless reason. And sure they're still spending their money I never said they needed to work for the gp if they wanted to spend over 100 dollars then that's their choice. Even if it's in the beta you're arguing it's a waste of time you're spending the time either way you're obviously just concerned about the money so like I said spend the gp and learn it or give up inferno wasn't made for everyone so it doesn't matter about your clan, just you.
---
The problem with melee is you'll be attacked by 3 styles using melee rather than 2 using range. meaning you can only protect yourself from 33% of his attacks rather than 50%. Melee is viable but range is so much easier and efficient once you learn his mechanics which doesn't take long.
---
Compared to zulrah I find vorkath a breeze.

Yeah true

Why do people use VPNs?
---
I'm about 300 ehp from maxing because of mobile. No chance I would be anywhere close without being able to skill on my phone/tablet while doing other stuff.
---
That's kind of the point why I'm bringing this up. It's not like it hurts those with infernals in any way, but would allow people to actually try out inferno who struggle on the main servers due to it seeming like a waste.
---
Until he finds a way to code html, then php, then a phishing replica of runelite.com
---
Do other races use more VPNs?
---
How much cash did that save you on brews? You're like halfway to a Tbow now, right?
---
Hmm. I'll have to try the beta worlds. I feel like this will absolutely effect safe spots/bossing to some extent. Even if it gets reported in the beta, the way to fix it will be slight changes to scenery, which will change spacing.
---
Just discussion though, i'm going to play around in the beta worlds tonight and figure it out.
---
So what was the major issue/reason this came up? Why is it needed?
---
∞ kc

The current system honestly needs extreme bad luck safety nets, because some people will grind their entire life for stuff without ever getting them. It's really sad.

---
Yes, hence why I i stated it's strange that the mage defence is what's being nerfed, as that isn't the issue with the shield. I assume they just want it to have a clearer weakness (because it is OP), one that's made up for by black d'hide and mage defense calculations.

No confirmation, but if you're putting this number of hours into it then training up a bit and doing vork or raids would probably be better money even with the longer skilling time/gear reqs.

I would always fashionscape on Seers. You stay at 100% run energy if you use the teleport anyway, since you gain run back on the obstacles.

You do you..

Pets are orders of magnitudes rarer than any other items and that causes a new issue which didn't exist before: a linear drop rates for extremely rare items is bound to create scenarios in which people grind for thousands upon thousands of hours without getting *any* reward, whereas before the 99.99% 'soft cap' in grind was barely breaking 1,000 hours. It just absolutely sucks for the few poor shmucks who aren't doing anything wrong apart from being extremely unlucky. Furthermore, it's not because 'things have always been this way' that it doesn't have to change:
---
* Splashing had to be changed
---
* Random events had to be changed
---
* Authentication via email instead of username had to be changed
---
There are plenty of other examples of these integrity changes, and it's honestly infuriating to see people constantly throw the argument around that progressive RNG isn't needed. 99% of the population will not get to experience 'real' dryness, yet every single interaction I've had with people that were even just within 1-2 time over the drop rate have admitted that the system sucks. There will always be unreasonable outliers in the pool of hundreds of thousands of people grinding, because that's how flat statistics work. It doesn't *have* to be flat, though.

Ironically Android has native mouse support but Jagex forced it to disable when the client is running, so they went out of their way to stop you from being able to use the hardware their game has been played with for decades

This is why in my opinion people just need to be okay with the idea that they will never fully complete a game with 1000s of rng based goals. It’s probably healthier and more reasonable to just accept that.

A while ago there was some post about bots, and an active bot coder replied and said himself reports are the way to go if you wanted a bot to ever have a chance of being banned. Since then I try to take some time to send some when I see obvious bots with scrambled and meaningless names.

---
Well, mr.genius, I pointed out that 1m gp/h is not real and I understand it's a glitch, but overall, profit made from Zulrah is at an all time low and that is hugely influenced by bots, aswell as other popular content that share item drops which are also on Zulrah's droptable. Ofc the alltime low price of scales can't be put on 1 single reason, but a huge part of it is Zulrah and sacred eel bots, believe it or not
---
48s here
---
House in rimmington, you can bring all of your planks noted while training and just hop out of the portal and unnote them at phials in the general store for a small amount of gp. Eventually you can get butlers that will grab planks out of the bank for you, and that's faster than phials. At that point house location doesn't matter and you can move it around at estate agents for a 5-50kish depending on where you want your house teleport to go to. Moving your house around is pretty common for different tasks.
---
Unfortunately 2m is basically just enough to get started with leveling. Eventually you will want to aim for rejuv pool, occult altar, fairy ring/spirit tree, jewelry box, and portals/portal Nexus. You might be able to craft a couple portals and a mounted glory but that's about it with 2m. I'd get those but focus mostly on leveling.
---
Planks (mostly) give static exp, so you want to build whatever requires the most planks for the fastest exp. Oak larders will be your main go to once you hit 33. You'll probably blow through your 2m pretty quick just spamming those. If oak larders feel too slow you can eventually spend more money on teak planks for faster/more expensive exp. The only thing that will give you more exp for a specific plank is a mounted mythical cape(123.3 exp per teak plank instead of 90), but those are a pain in the ass to train with.
---
Build anything that's beneficial to you as soon as you can. There isn't really any reason to wait. The house viewer in your house settings tab let's you move rooms around so you don't have to rebuild things if they're in an undesirable place.
---
Construction is expensive. It's going to cost all of your money. It's just a question of what you want to build with the money you have. As others have said, a functional max house can cost 100m+. Just level as much as you can. You'll eventually want to get to 83-84 to be able to boost for everything useful with spicy stew+crystal saw.
---
If you dont mind my attempt to explain it, ill give it a shot. If you ever use magic or ranged, you will know about safe spots. These are small alcoves, rocks, objects you can hide behind such that the enemy you are killing cant reach you. Usually this only works on an enemy that uses melee only or your attack style out ranges them. Based on the blog descriptions, there appear to be really specific examples of these safe spots where the NPC would not be able to attack you even if they were in range because of the way their code works. The game would think the NPC cant see you to attack, but you can see and hit them. This opens the door for melee safe spots, where you can smack an enemy with melee and they will just stand there, angrily staring at you.

&gt;When Corp was released, people came running in their d'hides, neitiznot helms, darklights and climbing boots. Is it difficult to solo in that gear? Sure
---
So you insinuate that people are soloing with that gear but then say
---
&gt;Besides, I never said people would solo Corp in d'hide and Neitoznot
---
Yeah ok. And you're fucking stupid saying im the reason RS is ezscape.  Nope sadly I'm not.  I said if this is how Jagex wants and has designed Corp to be with a tele straight there and no running through the Wildy then it is not really a Wildy boss and should be removed from it.   KBD at least has the risk of getting there, but corp doesnt.  
---
Please tell me how many people do you see doing Wildy bosses in Dhide and neitzy?  I literally see none.  People do Callisto in Veracs.  not sure on Ele, Venenatis is done usually on task, KBD isnt done with dhide, Vetion isnt done in dhide.  
---
Sorry Wildy bosses arent designed to your liking, but most content in the Wildy is dead and a lot of bosses arent being done in groups with absolute welfare gear when you can do it much easier and faster in decent gear solo.

---
I got mine at 30 master clue caskets. Big yeet for me, F for Kacy
---
Others would say definitely dont if you have the cash because they're great xp per hour
---
Pet at 40 kc.
---
Fully complete a game? Mate, I'm not advocating for tweaking rates such that completing the collection log or even just collecting every pet becomes a feasible endeavour. I don't have a single fucking pet.
---
&gt; It’s probably healthier and more reasonable to just accept that.
---
So you're asking me to bend over and ask for more. Ok. People on here come to complain about ~100 hour projects like grinding for rangers and they get sympathy, but I suggest that maybe, *maybe* we could add safety nets to prevent a 3,000h+ grind from yielding absolutely nothing and my real problem is my state of mind? Sure. If you say so.
---
^^
---
Not the best but very underrated update no one seems to mention is the collection log. Every unique you get from anything feels way more rewarding just because of this 'simple' book.
---
I know right? Companies only do open betas because their qa team is lazy.
---
I don't know how to make graphs with data on them, so just use your imagination here.
---
Imagine if we graphed out every skill with one axis being how click intensive the skill is and the other being how fast the XP goes.  On the bottom left we'd have fishing and woodcutting; fairly low xp, but you click once and then just sort of chill for a bit.  On the top right we'd have construction and smithing; very fast XP but if you so much as glance at your phone to read a text message your XP/hour suffers.  
---
Then, there's Runecrafting.  Lower on the graph for xp/hour than any other skill, and damn near as click intensive as construction.
---
I find them to be safer because generally pures can't meet the requirements. I always seem to get pked by someone who somehow has a lower combat than me yet has like 99 range and 99 mage or some shit. But most of those people focused on training up a pure pker don't level up like farming and shit.
---
A zerker might have difficulties at dks lacking tank pieces but otherwise all bosses should be available
---
I don't think 99 slayer is comparable to any of those, way too fucking easy and good
---
i’d say cox and ironman mode are in the top with mobile
---
Out of the loop, what am i looking at?
---
I don't disagree that podcasts are easier, but even the most rudimentary video content would allow people to actually see the designs and changes that were implemented through over a literal decade instead of just vaguely describing them.
---
It's a meme you dip
---
did you talk to the king lathas?
---
I had the opposite happen in a run this morning where my patch went to stage 2 immediately after planting the seed.
---
Does that include house pool?
---
Yeah a lot of focus and tapping
---
Looks like you answered your own question there pal.
---
That was the plan but I side tracked and done fishing
---
Even with scalable RNG (like 15x after 200M), there remains the chance that you'll never get it as long as there's no single roll with a 100% chance. I'm not advocating for that, and I never have. I want progression, not free pets.

Skilling isn't inherently exciting, that's a fact. People skill for a reason. The amount of players that achieved 99 firemaking skyrocketed when WT was released, showing that the significant profit and afkability behind WT incentivized firemaking training. Until then (and it's still kinda true), firemaking was and still is a dead skill.
---
I don't skill more than I need to because I don't have any goals that require additional skills atm. I'm not a maxed player and I don't feel like I need to max atm because I'm already raiding pretty efficiently. If there were an update that boosted my raiding efficiency and required a logical reason to grind (such as summoning being released), sure I'd put in the time to grind. Warding doesn't change the game enough to be logical to lock content behind for the reasons I have given.
---
Unless you can counter the examples I have provided in the linked thread, warding has no place in runescape lore over being placed as a rc expansion. Unless you can explain otherwise, warding would also not function as a good item sink.
---
thanks boss
---
2m? just wait until your more wealthy and use other people's houses on 330. Only level it if you need it for quest requirements or just because you want base stats. 
---
Construction is expensive as fuck and everything worthwhile is going to cost you 10m+
---
I was thinking of doing all the achievement diary’s
---
Yeah I'd say do on on PC before mobile for sure, until you get comfortable. But yeah it happened to me once and I got wrecked. It was demoralizing lol
---
Whether or not it takes time or takes practice is the same thing here, due to the nature of this analogy. They both take time to grind. The inferno is a grind. That's it. And even if you don't like the analogy, my point still stands. Again, there is no content locked behind the cape. It stands as an achievement for people who are willing to put in the time and effort to get it. If there was content locked behind the inferno, then yes I can see it being a problem. However, that is NOT the case whatsoever. You went into the inferno for ONE day and gave up, and now you're complaining about it on reddit. That's literally an insult to people who have grinded the inferno for 20-40+ attempts, and some even over 50, with 2 and a half hours per attempt, just to get the cape. If you really wanted it,  go grind it in actual servers like the rest of us.

50 rc NICE! Thats halfway to suicide

Good luck making the jump tho

didn’t know u had 4.8b xp, quests/diaries done &amp; all 45 pets so fast bro do u have any tips

Common problem.  Theirs been something up with it for a long time.

How long did it take aprox?

Oh nice an hour or 2 is totally worth it

Is zulrah hard to learn? I’ve watched videos on it but I feel like 80 range and 72 mage is a bit too low to attempt it.

Wait WHAT

Wait are we doing the keyboard or the alphabet?

Enjoy the agility. LOL.

Found the idiot with fucked eyes in 5 years.

They’re actually a solid spec weapon in a lot of pvm scenarios as well. Granted he wont be in those situations for a while but yeah they’re great in pvm too (situationally)
---
Ok. Well it takes a long time i can agree on that. I'm level 44 and would like to hit 50 because of the potential gold making, but the altars are so damn far away

Tears of Guthix and genie lamps needs to be below the water also for the RC

Mostly just grains that I had around the house. That was another good reason to get her to a better home, can’t imagine that’s the best food for chickens.
---
&gt;yes we are since its a side thing bonus that made to show off your investment.
---
How is a pet supposed to show off investment when the majority of people with the pet have gotten it far under rates and have basically no investment? Almost any single pet on its own isn't worth showing off because the far majority of people you see with the pet have actually just gotten extremely lucky while those who are "showing off their investment" on the other end of the normal curve are extremely few in comparison.
---
If I see someone with a pet it's far more reasonable to assume that they got very lucky than to assume that they made any considerable time investment because that's just how the distributions are, and because there is no way to distinguish between a lvl 1 pet or a 200m xp pet.

Pretty sure how it works now, is the raid scales to the player with the highest combat level, so if he goes with someone level 126, the raid will be scaled to level 126. But that isn't the case in a solo, if he's the only player at let's say level 105, the raid will be scaled to level 105
---
I will be voting No on my accounts to all poll questions until Warding content is revisited or implemented into the game.

It has brought a lot of people to the game. However there have been a lot of controversial updates or attempted updates to cater to the new players.

He's probably flicking quick prayers that have rapid heal on as well

It's certainly a good deal more difficult than Zalcano.

So does this mean he's called 25buttholes because he has touched 25 underage buttholes?

Well it brought in your standard mobile "gamers" so there is that downside

Listen to Macdady, he's on to something there. I quit long ago before OSRS was revamped with regular updates. That is the version that was dead at the time. When did I ever say OSRS is currently dead? lol...wtf
---
No no. See it'll take time to finish so in that time you can focus on those XP gains. Once it's finished continue with the steps and then go to lunch.
---
Yeah I just gotta learn to stay cool and go slow, thanks man
---
The sheer amount of time it takes to do that many master clues is insane, there's not even another person close to that many. We're talking thousands of hours
---
You've got an hour to pick them up where they were. Good luck!

Haha yeah my original hunt since release was for the pet, that was achieved by 2329 kc. After i got the pet i decided i wanted to see how much money i could make farming her to 99 mining. Currently at a total of 395.7m in loot from Zal including the Elven Crystal Chest loot. 
---
So far I’ve gotten from 77 to about 30k xp from 86 mining here at Zalc.

why spec with whip when a dds is 20k and has amazing spec

Here goes nothing then:

"As usual, the Inferno is closed on these worlds, since we'd prefer not to enable free practice runs there for all players. The Inferno itself is still being adjusted to handle the line-of-sight changes, since we would prefer the update not to affect how players fight Zuk in there. **However, these changes are not yet ready, and when they are, we'll need to arrange a more selective test, rather than sending in the entire community**"
---
Back in like, 2003 I reported somebody for something and I received a message saying thank you for reporting that individual for whatever it was. I wish I still had access to that account for a screenshot.
---
The best update this game has seen was the rs2 beta i.e when it moved from rs1
---
Basically, the answer you're gonna get is quest quest quest for barrows gloves or even quest point cape, and if you start to feel burned out at all, then go do something that you want to do in game

I have the exact same thing. Lag nowhere but on Fossil Island.

How is bossing on mobile?

You don't HAVE to.

Are high total level worlds also safer for wildy slayer or wildy bosses?

Man that looks like Tas it was so smooth

2 weeks ago I had a bond in my bank ready to use. When i logged in on my android mobile i was already f2p. A message popped up to check my bond pouch/upgrade to member using bond pouch, so I did and it worked.

Not looking forward to it at all xD remember underground pass all to well and I did that quest over a year ago LOL heard this is way worse too

I'm somewhat of a noob and all this slang is pissing me off, I even went to a runescape slang site to decipher your comment but it says revs are holy ones and doesn't have anything for BP. So could you possibly fill me in real quick?

Just add the to your friends list or ignore list and report them when you go bank 
---
That's what I do anyways cause adding friend is just a right click
---
Really? Jesus, that's some elitist bullshit, everyone has to learn at some point...
---
I thought the whole point of that discord was to be welcoming to people just starting out with raids? That's definitely the way they advertise it at least, really disappointed to hear that they handle it like that
---
Dont sweat it. I did mage only for my first 100 kills or so to get used to the rotations, correct ticks, when to move, etc. Made doing switches a lot easier when I transitioned.
---
You can do Zalcano with a 32k pickaxe and graceful. Varrock armor D pick is just making it slightly faster. In what world is getting graceful (which everyone already gets at the start of their account) comparable to getting a loadout for consistent Vork?
---
You recommend the dark bow method? I have 99 range and saw in a guide to use a blowpipe
---
id like to flyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
The way free to play is gated helps new players learn the basics. Try the free quests and build up to dragon slayer :) gives you a good goal to go for when starting g out! 
---
Good luck!!
---
Not sure if they edited the news post since you posted, but they literally stated that it could affect things besides PvP, and encouraged people to test PvM or line of sight based minigames in the beta worlds. That's why there are beta worlds. If anyone can find adverse affects they won't apply the change or they will tweak the new algorithm until it works as intended.
---
You don't need to change prayers before jad. Keep pray range on while it's only ranger, then when the mages show up, keep pray mage on the entire time. THE ENTIRE TIME.
---
Jad is fairly forgiving. That's the only time you'll need to pray switch. All I did was pray range, and when I see the animation for a mage attack, I swap to pray mage then swap back. If you default back to pray range you can kinda avoid having to switch back since his range attacks come out faster than mage
---
quest a shit ton, also get some varrock diarys for battlestaves for bond money and farm runs going
---
Verzik is a big one even tekton has situations where claw spec can be better than another dwh spec though I don’t remember the numbers for when its viable right now
---
That normal harpoon instead of barb tail harpoon ruined it too
---
It was the shit back in 2003/4, WAY better than DDS against full rune.
---
Nice! I usually quest when I feel an urge to do so. Right now I'm working toward desert elite for a KQ pet grind however. SOTE looks super fun though! Plus, 69 stat, gotta hang onto that as long as I can. :P
---
Why should the game forgive these accidents? Making pures has always been like this. You make a mistake and level up defence, either make a new pure or train it up to a different bracket pure. Why should pkers be exempt from easyscape?
---
Rip to your RNG friend
---
Perhaps grinding for them,but if you have all the stats and requirements and items for a clue why would it take longer than any other clue steps? I doubts it's thousands of hours, a couple hundred tho probably.
---
Click bait. Has nothing to do with random events.......
---
Theres an option that let's you one-click drop. You can toggle it on and off. It's just as easy, or easier, than shift clicking on desktop. I actually prefer fishing on mobile!

I think he was joking about completionists
---
Just tried this and they opened it again until eventually it wouldn't let me close it again. "The door seems to be stuck." W329. So many bots. They could be a tiny bit less obvious.
---
And the top reply posted at the same time got this wrong. IDK why its this hard to understand.
---
Though its kind of misleading to look at the odds of a rune battleaxe and dragonstone specifically. Like, he'd still be posting here if he got any combination of rune baxe, rune spear, rune 2h, rune sq, rune kite, d med, d spear, shield left half and dragonstone.
---
I think its called the sharpshooter fallacy or something, because its like shooting a bunch of shots at a blank target, and drawing the bullseye where they hit afterward.

This game is all about setting and achieving goals big and small. I'd say the first big goal is to obtain and wear a rune platebody.

Good luck!
---
Idk if you've seen Lord Shayne's guide on YouTube but you should check it out, takes all of that stuff out of the equation. There's slight improvements you can make on it for speed runs and stuff but as far as just carrying teams in w306 you will actually never mess up if you follow that guide.
---
I like the old interface's aesthetics, but it could do with a slight rework to it's functionality.
---
Haha it's great you can just like crazy. And way less carpul tunnel inducing than clicking a mouse.
---
It's a bad joke. It's redundant. That's what I'm pointing out when I say "as opposed to?"

I dont really consider mobile an update, but rather platform extension, but undoubtedly the single biggest thing for the health of the game

Want him to quit playing two days in? Lmao

You think you do.

So I’m not sure how you are doing it but approaching the jad wave if you have a couple of restores left I highly recommend the lazy approach. Invest if you haven’t already in dragon darts for jad. During wave 62 when you turn off auto with half health on orange jad left... you get yourself settled with a sip of brew to over hp then a sip of restore and sip of range pot and stamina if you bring that... unequip bp and unload addy/rune darts for dragon. Kill the orange and start with range pray while listening for the sound... the lazy approach consists of only 1 action between prayer switches. Ya be killing jad and get him down to 50%hp and as healers start coming you pray switch if you need to then move to a location that seems ideal to stand and aggro the healers without having to move to much as you aggro each and that’s it. Don’t worry about hitting them... just switch prayer. Now you aggro one and switch prayer... and now don’t worry about attacking another healer, check prayer level and then pray switch... aggro another.. prayer switch if needed... aggro another and prayer switch and now again check prayer level... and switch and aggro last and prayer switch and now kill jad. I should mention 2 things I forgot to mention nope 3. First up until jad I keep bp on rapid and have auto set to on. 2nd walking into jad I mentioned a few restores, if you have rigour then once you have jad to 50% turn it off till all healers are aggro and you back to killing jad. If eagle eye then ya could keep it on but you’ll know that. 3rd after all are aggro drink a sip of range pot and if you feel comfortable with the pray switch sip of brew and restore to over hp so tanking healers is not a worry in the back of your mind.
---
Runecraft was such a shitty filler arc
---
When you deposit your pay-dirt into the machine before you reach the limit (81 with non upgraded paysack or 162 with upgraded paysack) you ideally want to deposit an amount that is under such as 161, 160, 159, etc so you can deposit another inventory essentially going over the limit.
---
It's why we need *very slow* progressive RNG for pets.
---
Sayings it's below Arma xbow means you think xbow is better lol
---
The esoteric shall inherit the game.
---
The site owner could automatically direct you after x amount of seconds or an URL that directs you to the correct site. Since it's a site that's there to educate you in the first place, him telling you to type it yourself is another lesson. I think it's fitting and funny; to each his own.
---
Yeah, I’ve found that too. I don’t worry about it most of the time because it’s faster and easier to just do a farm run without looking at the clock and rake when I need to, rather than worry about the timer.
---
The game will shut down eventually and thousands of players will realize (and probably regret) how much time they wasted completing the same repetitive tasks over and over again just to have it all disappear. Harsh reality
---
In fact the opposite, if you want a really good lookalike, it saves a lot of time by crawling all the links and downloading all the pages for you
---
Will these settings always be tied to the email?
---
Also in regards to tunneling, it’s why I mentioned when they show up ditch attacking jad altogether and pick a spot from where you see all four, I prefer using runelite bird view to make this easier and also I forgot to mention turn off rapid and switch to defense for jad with bp to give you extra distance from it
---
I would much prefer smaller buttons with better and clearer information than those giant blocks. Infact given how blocky their icons actually look, they'd probably look better at a smaller scale anyway. The new interface shows the runes needed and as far as i can see the only option for amount appears to be "all" instead of numerous options like other interfaces. The new design is just better looking, more functional and shows its information clearer
---
And on mobile there is a function key at the top of the Left column. Just keep it set on drop mode for tap to drop
---
It’s strong, not insanely strong, and it’s also inaccurate so you’re not always gonna hit that
---
Mods have actually acknowledged that the BP is hard to work around because making anything stronger is hard unless its filling a niche. Goes from a half decent drop from zulrah to over a billion gold for a twisted bow and even still theres cases were BP out dps Tbow. I think theres an issue, but also would be sad to see it go. Im all for integrity but it's a hard fix

I couldn't find anything about it in the discord server, so I just took them at their word. I don't care that much but I just want to know where 0 kc people can actually practice ToB. WDR only seems to handle 0 kc people for CoX in those Saturday learner masses. Everyone says "Find a team of noobs and just try ToB until you get it", which I would do if I knew where to find a team. 
---
Clans on the runescape forums seem to be the only way to find ToB teams, but I don't play enough due to work to want to deal with clans.

There are all quanity options if you have supplies on you.

&gt;The new design is just better looking, more functional and shows its information clearer
---
Dont you have to select the tab and then press create on the left interface? That literally requires you to click twice as much as on the right one which makes the left one less functional than the right interface lol
---
Personally the only time I make tabs is when I do them on my ironman and I do large quanities while afking so I dont see the point in seeing how many runes the teleports cost every time I open the lectern. And since I always play on my main when I make tabs it would be annoying as fuck if you have click twice every time.

1 trillion cows would drop 1 trillion cowhides. Making leather gloves provides 13.75 crafting exp each. That'd be enough cowhide to get 99 crafting on 1,054,898 accounts through leather gloves alone. Yeah I don't think it's been a trillion lmao. Maybe a billion, if you count rs3 numbers as well.
---
No, accounts with the best possible stats in the game are actually worse than account without the best stats in the game. /s

would be better if it named the people banned, feels like telling 'one or more' kinda diminishes that.

Regarding mobile table sorting...maybe? I know Wikipedia also doesn't support mobile sorting, but it might just be that we need to be more permissive about when we allow that JS to load. It might end up being too taxing on phone processors though, table sorting is notorious for being really DOM-movement heavy.

You have any links? I'm morbidly curious.

wow, misinformation about RS3 on r/2007scape. What a shocking development.
---
Honestly top notch content. 12/10
---
Well, it's not completely irrational. It'll shut down eventually. It's definitely much more popular than any other projects Jagex has ever had, but just about all of those projects have been shut down now. I put a lot of time into FunOrb personally before they stopped updating the site. Knowing FunOrb was going to die didn't make me go back and finish all of my goals even though it was a few years before it was officially shut down. I don't view it as wasted time though. I don't ever plan on going back to RS3 but I don't view my pre-invention maxed account as wasted time. It was fun at the time membership was cheaper than buying new console games all the time.
---
I wouldn't worry about osrs shutting down before you achieve your goals though. It's currently a healthy game and you can max easily in the life left on osrs if you put in the time on your end.

Damn game never gives me a twisted bow
---
yeah agreed. I didn't mean to make it sound like the drugs itself were doing it. most people who use stack gear usually take substances that aromatize into e2. (ex: high amounts of test  will convert to estrogen). this can be undesirable for many reasons. but usually closer to competition time, bodybuilders will either drop those kinds of compounds or start going crazy on ai's to give them a "dry" look which crush their e2 to 0. That's all nice and dandy for stepping on stage, but you really need estrogen for basic ligament health. With 0 estrogen, their connective tissue will be extremely brittle. Pair that with insane strength and lifting heavy, you have a recipe for disaster. It's super common to see body builders hurt themselves for this reason, not as common as powerlifters and strongmen. iifc ronnie did powerlifting and bodybuilding
---
It's not any less impressive as a result. Someone with max combat and tbow on the main servers wouldn't be any different for someone who completed it on beta. That's just practicing over and over till you get it, that honestly sounds like a lot more work than needed. You'd be doing more runs to figure out the perfect balance than you otherwise would have just going with what you originally have, is what I imagine. It's like a temporary boost, except you still can't take it with you when you do the real thing. You could even have more trouble being used to stronger gear to carry you through, so it could even teach bad habits such as tanking certain waves rather than dealing with proper actions. It is true that it could help some people though, or it could hinder them as well.

Mod mat k would never bot

Don’t ever use being an Ironman as an excuse for anything. You can easily trade lower tier implings for jars.

Oh yeah that’s efficient isn’t it, spending hours trading in implings for jars. Pointless reply.
---
I mean you sound pretty toxic as well. Just ignore people like that instead of going off back at them
---
Nah, Bro. Don't worry so much. Most of the "ez" things from it are just long overdue interface and auto v manual click things.
---
Cerberus is too good
---
Hitting Ctrl + S on a page saves you the trouble of inspecting element...
---
I wouldn’t last the full 6 hours without being on the spot. After a certain time if you’re not in combat you log. If you’re in the corner and kill the ranger without anything else being near you because they spawned in the middle, you’ll log
---
Dunno why I’ve been downvoted your method seems slow af 😂
---
Coming back after a decade and using runelite is like a fucking revolution revelation lol it’s amazing

Runescape site &gt; forums &gt; old runescape clans &gt; write in the search bar "ParadoxCC"

Or u could just join the in game clan chat - ParadoxCC

And some1 there will get u in our discord and help u with forums
---
There is a lot of Castle Wars going on in the official world, but everyone there has near maxed stats/gear
---
Fucking Cerberus had me rolling
---
No you need the quest to do the boss
---
Get 83 cons asap. Go to clan wars

It seems you lack inventory space to pick up a certain item

Are the 2000+ or 2200+ total worlds safer or more dangerous than the 1250+, 1500+, or 1750+ total worlds? What about the high risk wildy worlds?

---
Fucking R I P

No it’s costing him billions
---
Those 2 rings are used for the prayer bonus, not the defence bonus
---
because you can't just get a master easily, it needs to come from either doing another clue or combining every other tier together. He didn't do them all from just imps either so it is easily over 1000 hours
---
Use steel platelegs instead of the ardy platelegs on your armour case. It works
---
That guy was literally like 25 times the drop rate or something like that meaning it was millions to one. People have gone a lot drier than this for other pets (statistics wise, time investment wise Kacy is definitely the number 1)
---
Well shit I'll give Kacy one imp then
---
Saucy.
---
It's high end goals to work towards. While they are not something everyone can do right now its still something to aim for being able to do in the future when you have a maxed account.
---
A front hole\*
---
Saw a guy just spamming "healer, good teams only" like I get that you've probably had a bad experience in certain teams, but also fuck picking that guy on my team cuz if theres even a slight bit of turbulence one wave they fucking leave.
---
Only fucking himself by making the process longer by being an impatient douche. Too bad these people are so focused on blaming everyone else that they don't realize they're the problem.
---
🦀META🦀
---
Big facts
---
I just raged and quit the game because of this. 
---
See you guys tomorrow!
---
Grand Exchange changed the game forever. Mobile is in second place though.
---
Sarachnis rate is going to get changed?
---
I believe you calculated the odds for a pet at 1000 KC, not 5200.
---
You are just as bad...
---
I only use the super restorer in the 2 specials, because vorkath takes a few seconds to attack again
---
Lmao
---
eh...most max account just stop playing.
---
100% worth never having good rng again
---
I’d rather rake weeds after every harvest for the rest of my life than play that trash mini game for even one minute
---
No, dolo, it’s playing on 2 accs at once to kill a boss
---
I am aware of the mini quests and achievement diary. Even if the quest isn’t entirely centered in the wilderness, I just think there could be more content there That isn’t just pvp and pvm. I mean I know people hate the wilderness for the idea of getting pked.
---
You were a mistake
---
Dope
---
damn love the idea, should do the same  
---
nice
---
Because if you set up the custom rumble correctly, on Normal mode, you can go 20 minutes without touching the keyboard. At sandcrabs you have to come back every 10 minutes. Sand crabs is only better for pures and people with &lt;100qp or so, depending on the quests done.
---
NMZ is a trade off between points and afk. If you want points, then yeah do the hard rumble with lots of high-level bosses enabled, but you can only go two or three minutes without guzzling rock cake
---
Really? Sorceress' garden and some other minigames will be affected, and also all quests and puzzles where you have to evade guards. Like getting a goutweed at the Troll stronghold, and Ratcatchers, and Witches house, I suppose. This isn't said, but about Sorceress' garden - is said plainly in the news. So no, it is not a PvP update, and not even combat only!
---
No. It's just not worth it and it's a cool item to get if you play casually.
---
It's not meant to be a grind to get every single pet. The game isnt meant to be played as an autistic grind for 100% of your time playing.
---
It's a cool feature if you're lucky enough to get it.
---
You in no way benefit devoting that much time to get a purely cosmetic item.
---
The phone screens are small tbh, on my phone I only do skiling and safe combat stuff as slayer or brutal blacks, on tablet however everything is a lot better due to screen size, I have no problems doing zulrah/vorkath on it.
---
How much did all of this cost together approximately?
---
Why did you post this 4 times.... they are the same thing.
---
It's a mechanic, but it is not really "known" like you think. The general public does not know how to do it, mostly only people who use specific clients that tell them where to stand. There is no counter play if you do not know where you can and can't stand.
---
It doesn’t matter if you haven’t killed anyone or not, you’re equally as guilty and you have just as much blood on your hands. 
---
You can say that you don’t support the atrocities that the military perpetuates but as long as you’re proudly wearing your drone uniform, we all know what you’ve really been trained to think.
---
I know 5 bosses, maybe I didn’t play enough
---
I’m 21m farming xp and still haven’t unlocked it. Fuck tithe farm
---
Those kills (even with Eagle Eye) that have 3-4 ruby specs are ridiculous. Is the Ward worth getting? I know its BiS, but is it worth 10-12 hours of grinding?
---
About £170. Normally up to £10 per item from backsteetmerch store.
---
Poor kacy
---
Who doesn't have adblock? Also the ads are clearly labeled as ads and not real results
---
-.-
---
So youre saying i need to get my FC ASAP?
---
Literally no person does 8m+ of range xp at Zulrah, and uses none of that money to improve their acc. Don't play dumb.
---
Yeah we’re talking about now tho
---
Lol congrats
---
Yes it works. Edmond doesnt want to polish them.... on the other hand, I learned about this polishing thing only after the quest anyways :). But, well... but... would be fun to have such thing as steel-color untradable iron platelegs lol )).
---
Why not its thier game and they can choose how to play it.
---
Jagex said they won't update it for things Ironman already had pre-collection log, because normie accounts
---
Another related question because I just started using the DHCB instead of the blowpipe: does your Crumble Undead sometimes not go off? Seems like that happens sometimes with the DHCB.
---
There's not 0 pkers, but the risk is just so much lower because there are no spec weapons, no ancient magicks, etc, and there's a max of like ~200 people on a 750 total
---
Dude you're seriously at an absolutely unhealthy level of aggravated about this.
---
If pets didnt exist, you wouldnt have tried to grind for them in the first place. Seeing as they serve literally zero benefit to you in the game aside from just simply *having* it, it makes literally no difference to anyone whether you fucking get it or not.
---
If it were to be necessary, jagex should just remove pets all together because it appears it severely detrimental to peoples mental health and for the 5th or 6th time, serves no purpose in the game besides being purely cosmetic, and getting you to play thousands of hours to pay jagex
---
Yea don't worry about them they are just the scum that gathers at the bottom of any community
---
Lying to yourself won't make these accounts any less of obvious bots, it just makes you unwilling to accept it. 🤷

I always think that if you are a snitch online you also are one irl.  If you’re really that offended just report the man in-game and move on. Why post it so everyone can see?
---
U...........
---
Yes, they're only intending to change one-way safespots between players in pvp, so anything unusual in pvm in the beta world should be reported (right click the report button)
---
So this trick works only for characters with 1 Def?
---
Why would you get reported if you're not doing Zulrah? The literal express reason he's reporting these accounts is because they're Zulrah farm bots and they're leeching ALL of the profitability with the way they've devalued scales.  Yeah there are definitely going to be some regular players in the mix but at this point in time there's literally nothing else being done about the tremendous harm that bots are imposing upon the in-game economy, especially for a high-level boss like Zulrah.
---
Just buy them from ge lol what you mean
---
" not to affect how players fight Zuk in there.”
---
Haha equally as guilty? Man you’re too far gone. I genuinely don’t care what other people think I’m trained to think. I have my own free will. And the military has done wonderful things regardless if you’re willing to acknowledge it or not. 
---
Have a good one bud.
---
That's no excuse. If you play on your phone to have the Internet literally in the palm of your hand.
---
Has been happening to me too. My fps are fine, but I'll lag often while switching gear and see my XP drops will stack. Haven't seen the issue anywhere else.
---
You rock, thank you man!
---
Damn killing black salamander hunter with nothing 😂
---
I'm not being sarcastic :D
---
What about the people that pk daily/weekly but don’t prefer BH in its current state? Should they be “banned” from voting because they don’t have 10 Target kills yet they have a high kdr and are knowledgeable about PvP and want to participate in BH if it was reworked?
---
Which app?
---
Amethyst broad bolts if I remember correctly. Nearly as affective at lower cost. NOT good enuf for vork but great for everything else.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t bis in lots of places. I said it wasn’t worth using in many places, because of how much you’d be spending to use it there. Only really worth it at tob or Cox if you’re trying to make money, which goes back to my original point
---
Where did they say what he's saying?  The blog states:
---
&gt;The reason for making these changes is to have more accurate and fairer PvP and PvM challenges.
---
Doesn't sound like it's PvP only to me.
---
? why are you looking at month old threads
---
LMS beta for practice
---
 Got back into this game last year in November shortly after I heard mobile was released. I've never ever gotten this far back when I was a kid. Been playing on and off and have never been more satisfied with my progress to this total level. I've met my goals of maintaining a QPC from level 88 CB level and completing all hard diaries at 100 CB level.
---
For now, I'm focused on building my cash stack, completing elite diaries, and reaching 2000 total. Wish me luck :)
---
Gotta be some kind of psychological issues at play in those type of people.
---
DUDE
---
Oops I guess I replied in a new comment somehow. You'll see it :) (added below)
---
Maybe it is, or maybe it’s 50/50?
---
Dad bod cosmetic for your character/every body slot
---
"What sense does it make to give people that don't contribute to the PvP community a say in what happens to it?"
---
The very same sense why 300 total lvl accounts can have a say on whether a whole new skill would be added into the game.
---
While it most certainly would be beneficial for every category of players to have some sort of requirement to vote in polls regarding content dear to them,  deciding the appropriate level/amount of certain activity completed when one would be eligible to have a say can prove a bit difficult.
---
Average kill time is \~2min I'd say. Definitely quicker than the BP.
---
I remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer
---
Why would anybody be jealous of someone staking?
---
I got pked there yesterday too! Was super confused on what was happening lol
---
Distractions and diversions were the best part of rs2/3 for me.

Bold of you to assume the goblin boys in this sub know how to read.

Tbh I’d rather do the masters.  Corp is aids and assuming he’s doing the medium method, those 500+ ranger boots would be tasty
---
Ernest the Chicken tho
---
Great first comment.
---
tdlr; don't panic sell it will rebound.
---
I never ran out without the teleport and no graceful
---
This is why the 1/1k bloodhound rate is very stupid**. The only other questionable pet rate is the Corp one (which Kacy also went super dry for).
---
I once was to stoned to actually play so I stood around at the ge giving everyone salad shields and green robes and made a small army it was fun
---
If somehow your password lists gets leaked and your own account is on there, nobody will suspect it was you.
---
Graceful is for betas :)
---
Ash clarified it in the Q&amp;A
---
Care to elaborate on the 93 herblore?
---
Grand Exchange.
---
Nothing has topped that, and I'm pretty sure nothing ever will.
---
So leave then
---
Take this down haha theres so many details here
---
+1 to the chins idea. If your defense isn't super low you can also just tank them after hitting them and just focus on jad.
---
I would advise blocking out that personal information.
---
What about Alaskan bull worm = QBD?
---
You're part of the wrong community bro.

j/k

If you use this account, def delete this post now

Yeah he's fucked
---
You're more like breaking into the mid game :p
---
Keep doing your runs, that's all good stuff.  Consider adding in Yanillian Hops and Cactus Spines to your runs.  
---
Generally it's gonna be better to sell the drops if you don't already know that you want them.  The full sets are typically only used in niche situations.  
---
It's better to have a smaller stack since that means you're spending/using your wealth to advance.  Sometimes you might find you've purchased a lot of gear upgrades that you don't actually use that often; I've cleaned my bank out of items like this recently, twice, and generated extra millions both times.  Look over your gear and consider if there's anything you only use situationally that you could do without having all the time (remember it's OK to buy and sell items as needed, you lose little to no money doing this).
---
Also, just my personal observations, Barrows is a pretty lack luster money maker at the moment.  In general the attack runes have all lost a lot of value over the past few months which is where most of the consistent money came from.  Obviously you can always get lucky with lots of armor drops.  
---
You're probably better off looking for other money-makers, or just carry on with the passive money making in-between training up your other skills.
---
I get that, I just hate seeing it go down long term and think to myself I could have sold it and trained soemthing els then re bought at a lower price when I want to use it
---
That's not an excuse, only an explanation. When on mobile most don't wanna swap between app and look stuff up, idk why.
---
My buddy just asks players questions or closes the game and moves on.

Welcome to the low Kc club :)
---
Not the same thing
---
Double dad double kamil
---
Dam i thought my RNG was good getting the pet at 415kc. Thats insane RNG gratz bro🎉
---
I feel like there should be more proof, youre essentially reporting someone just cause you can, botting or not, i feel you should require more proof and this isnt me approving botting im just saying more proof would lead me to actually report, someone could just be sitting there and actually be good enough and have the patience to do zulrah that much with low stats in other areas, i wouldnt jump to conclusions that fast. Like me or hate me im just spittin some facts.
---
There’s a lot of assdicks out there.
---
Read the rest of it:
---
&gt; As you may assume, unintended and to be reverted. 
---
Will be fixed before it's released from the beta worlds
---
House pool doesn't lower raised stats so I don't see why it would
---
this is how you make a real life zammy brew
---
Based on your username that was just God feeling bad for you
---
Lots of games have this, PUBG, Rocket League, etc. I agree though, it definitely motivates me to report if someone is cheating or being ultra toxic
---
snitch
---
They do this on Xbox too
---
Xbox is pretty strict surprisingly
---
Aside from the extremely clever oohoho "Vagina" jokes the armor doesn't look bad.
---
As an owner of a zerker, you end up having about 3-4K till you level up defence to 46.
---
oh no
---
Yeah that makes sense. All I need left in the game is a scythe and an ely :P. Don’t have to worry about spending money on skills or other items
---
I see this causing way more bugs than it resolves as a developer. Glad they're doing beta testing for this, but I see this having a lot of issues down the line in PVM mechanics and how mobs behave.
---
I hope it'll be heavily tested and polled instead of hotfixed and breaking a ton of shit. It's not the first time a hotfix for a "small" bug caused unpredictable problems. Rolling back the server is not a viable strategy for addressing bugs.
---
[Theoretically, we would desire it to do nothing with existing interactions other than fix the issue where in some player vs player scenarios some people are able to attack while others can't.
---
It's very possible, however, that some safe spots may have broke in the wider game - or weird interactions like during MM2 and the Sorcerer's garden may have broke etc.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cqmysj/small_game_updates_and_betas/ewxie7u)
---
Get a thicker skin
---
Learning to attack while in the poison phase is what bumps your kills per trip by 1-3 generally, and kill times by at least a third (from my tests anyway with rigour) and yeah kills per trip on average are 4-5 with good rng ruby bolts it can peak at 7, anymore than that and your inventory fills up too much.
---
No?  
---
Of course he's the first person there, and it's solely because he doesn't have the pet.  
---
If he got the pet earlier then he wouldn't have done that many clues.
---
Thatd be an interesting concept for agility. More xp for more weight but higher chance of failure.
---
Friggin ironmen man, we get it ffs
---
And you need 2 spears, rough. Wish I had internet atm to try that shit, did some routine Skotizo for hard clues the other day. My computer froze when I was going to kill a pillar, and due to mage pray, he splashed and it booted me from the instance. Saved my rune pouch, my ornament d boots, and karil skirt with that luck lol.
---
I'm at over 180m across all skills that give skilling pets. I would definitely welcome that update. It only helps people who are already dry. Why would I want anyone to go through something I personally hated? It's a bit sadistic that people would want others to suffer simply because they have had to.
---
It sounds like you were toxic and got reported honestly
---
Idk man, he seems like a cool down to earth guy. You missed out
---
He locked the donation prize pool at 1b. The rest has gone to increasing each imp from 3m to 5m.

---
What order should I level up my melee stats? Currently at 70 Atk, 78 Str, 70 Def. 
---
I heard that going above 80-something strength had serious diminishing returns on dps as compared to leveling up attack after hitting 80. 
---
How would you break it down if you’re eventually going to 99 all 3? For example 80str-&gt;75def-&gt;80atk-&gt;85str-&gt;99atk and etc
---
My account is for slayer btw
---
The relevant code was eventually updated in 2009 to fix these line of sight issues. The framework is already there, I’m sure that makes it a ton easier to bug fix and think of overlooked aspects since they probably patched a bunch the 2009 update missed in the years following.
---
Lmao irl saying +15 range attack is only valuable enough for 1 extra kill per hour, you are doing something wrong then because it's a noticable difference in a 1 hour time frame.

---
You think a gap of over 3,000 between 1st and 2nd place isn't rare? Ok. Of course he hasn't stopped *because* he's looking for the pet. What does that have to do with anything? It doesn't change the fact that his 5,200+ unsuccessful rolls are a statistical extreme.
---

I may not like what someone has to say, but I would give my life for their right to say it.
---
That is **not** hyperbole.
---
Because they either have an autoclicker or bot and it messed up. Should be easy to detect/report but I dunno why they don't get suspended/banned
---
My Mancunian brother, they down voted you because you didn't address the point. 2 pray doses and a few shark and youre looking at spending like 10k per kill and a lot of the time the profits from salvation army snake are shit so the cheapest way is clean wars portal or ornate pool.
---
I voted you up again hope it helps but every time I come on you've been down voted for being a bad wool, I even recognise your name every day. I can't do it all the time though, soon you'll have to start spamming nice to get back on top.
---
Yes, but no. We are talking artificial value deflation due to merchants that manipulate the market by lowering demand to avoid risk while people panic. So yes, higher risk lowers value, but the underlying asset might not reflect that perfectly, hence why he suggest holding out the storm
---
I think you mean a 1/200 chance of not getting it.
---
Lol, I guess players aren't real unless they only play for a little bit per day. I guess this explains why you are so defensive of Zalcano. Don't want anyone questioning your easy money method lol. Also explains why you find a 70 skill requirement to be so daunting. We probably shouldn't be making the game super easy for the sake of casual players like yourself and people shouldn't be able to get an easy 2mish an hour because they skilled for a little while.
---
As for the other bosses? Vork is locked behind a difficult quest and requires high stats and good gear to do consistently. Zulrah is difficult to learn and is a massive roadblock to new players trying to get elite void. It takes a lot of practice and plenty of deaths to manage routine kills. I do support making Zulrah harder to access though because bots are inhibited by things like learning curves. Demonics also should be harder to access because MM2 is broken and all the bosses can be cheesed to effectively bypass the intended difficulty of the quest though it's worth mentioning that the airship platform alone is more difficult than SotE lol.
---
I'd say it would be better to find one or two others to do a trio or 4-man with while you're learning. If you're set on doing duos just try some, and if you think its too slow, grind some levels.
---
Look at the quality of lines on the railing on the house or the quality of lines on the bridge. I guess if you look at the picture zoomed out it may be difficult to pick up on the differences. Maybe you have to zoom in on my examples at the bottom of my picture, but they are easier to see in game when you have a phone/tablet in your face.

Lazy? I have rigour after farming vorkath. I got the pet drop and now I'm just not motivated to kill it anymore, plus I don't have as much time in the busy school period. I couldn't think of anything worse than farming vorkath for 30 hours to get a dhcb

I've sent you a dm regarding my thoughts, I don't want to post them here lest they be construed as an attempt to manipulate the prices.
---
You're right. Let's just make all of our favorite games look as shitty as possible. Asking for all my pixels to form straight lines is asking for WAY too much. You never know who's trying to play OSRS on an old Nokia phone.
---
The difference is that at that point it was funny.
---
Theyre not 1/1k, they're 1/512. Zulrah gives 2 rolls.
---
Man.  My heart races even when doing earth warriors for slayer.  I couldn't imagine being that deep for so long.  Kudos man.  I kinda can't wait till I die so I can feel more confident doing all the wildy activities
---
How do you explain a house on your calf to someone you dont know? Lol
---
Can't wait for your first time making a screenshot
---
Lol keep trying
---
agility is like 200k-300k gp/hr
---
Just quest the rest of your defence and u will be fine. Look of zerk def quest guides
---
more like 1,116th
---
Adopt is in the cc I run with lol 😂 I logged on while at work and told him, and the cc lawl this is funny he's a cool guy really.
---
to add you get shards from doing agility in prif, which are even more gp(even at 12keach) than marks of grace
---
I don’t actually have any of them blocked
---
Pwople these days
---
And people crying about pointless shit ... Dont forget about that.
---
Wholesome art in this subreddit?! 
---
About time.
---
Yikes you must be new here
---
Just keep doing them man, if your using a regular trident your making money regardless, just gotta have some faith in RNGesus and be blessed in your journeys!
---
They are that uncommon that it’s a skip task, not a block
---
Darude sandstorm
---
That’s still almost a 600 hour grind.
---
You know what man, you're right. Instead of being pumped we can now play our favorite childhood game on our smart phones, let's be fucking miserable because the graphics aren't exactly the same as the desktop version. My bad
---
r/woosoohhshshshh
---
Why, OP asked why you would do with account. I dont pk so I answered.
---
How do you have 18m xp and this is your first medium clue lol
---
If your stats are high then it's easy. Attack Jad normally. Once healers spawn, switch to chins. They get up close to him and get hit by the splash. Even if they're on the opposite side of Jad, it's still fine.
---
Just tank the healers and focus on prayer.
---
This is my Lab!
---
Nah homie, you can 2 tick harpoon fish on zeah. It's pretty damn fast
---
Be careful, they already kidnapped sir pugger, they can do the same to you
---
Cheer up bud, one day you'll find what you're looking for.
---
Mate Im not here to argue just providing the math. Ward is 2% better dps at most, still a good upgrade, but I just wouldnt prioritise it is all I am saying.
---
They are locked from the normal max cape though
---
i really liked the name though. I was surprised using bot in your name at all was allowed, guess I found a loophole name for the few months i had it
---
Grand Library Optimization
---
The Grand library of Prifddinas has been improved graphically to help with frame rate issues some players were experiencing.
---
Actually, it was the music track "song of the elves" causing some sort of memory leak or something that made people lag.  If you had music off or selected a different song it wouldn't lag.  Not sure if you guys addressed that yet.

Literally nothing compared to 5k masters
---
"it's from an old game I've been playing since I was a kid. It's a tablet that teleports me home which is where you heal and recover. Just like my real home."
---
I did exactly this when I fucked yo my pure and it’s going fine at 43 def
---
I always thought the way they held the branches it looked more like fishing poles instead of dramen staves, hence the barbarian fishing stuff nearby
---
Watch xzact's inferno guides, I know you want to know about the intricacies of combat in general but nearly all of them are covered in the Inferno. I think the only one that isn't is just this mechanic that affects some enemies like Cerberus to skip the ghosts phase:

---
that's better than what i'd come up with manually
---
Looks pretty cool
---
Used moms cc to buy full ancestral.
---
Seems silly to force a name change for that one imo. Its not offensive in anyone
---
I saw it and Tale of the Righteous is the only Kourend quest I have done. You go to the tower of arcuess to look up something about an old expedition to that mountain where CoX is.
---
I was under the impression that sand crabs tops out at like 80k. Training def with 99 att and str gets me between 75-85k depending on how good I am about re potting, and obviously less than that if I'm going over the 20 minute mark.
---
Of course with dharoxks and absorbs, you get well over 100k, I just mean for afk.
---
It seems like sand crabs would only really be ideal in specific situations like if you're going to AFK in exact 10min intervals
---
I think it's 50. Not 100% sure though
---
Trusssss bruv
---
Well I know that, but that’s not nothing.
---
2.147b boy good
---
Tldr?
---
nieve for exp, give the most cannonable/barrageable tasks. Duradel for highlevel moneymaking konar for lowlevel moneymaking and task streak boosts
---
Shouldn't be polled. Just force this in
---
I got 70 thieving yesterday. From 55. I'm not arguing nothing.
---
Sharon is Karen. btw, what was the name of your ISP when you started dreaming?
---
Support!
---
Go back for pet mad clout awaits
---
All they ask for is the cost of the item, which is pretty terrific in itself. Tips are of course welcome. I don't know how anyone can complain either.
---
I may have worded it badly. I have an imbued slayer helm and 99 slayer but it gets so lame always using the same helm with every combat style.
---
minion  btw
---
As soon as it got taken over by Nexxon or whatever it was completely dead. I mean they couldn’t even properly transfer accounts over.
---
nice job!
---
I was a CQC only player for the most part. We did some Urban OPs tho. I miss that shit
---
Yep everything is fine here.
---
New OSRS questline where you choose your goddess (Karen or Sharon). Make it happen Jagex.
---
Looking awfully close to goblin boy village there biker boy, did you forget to pay your taxes?
---
I’m a casual do only have one account
---
So I wanna do both pvm and pvp
---
Current stats attack:62 str:66 def:45 range:73 prayer:45 magic:48
---
I was setting up for a zerker but would also like to do pvm.
---
Are there any bosses I could do soon while keeping a zerker?
---
Also any good lower level bosses that make decent money me and my buddy could duo other than KBD?
---
What sites is safe and legit though? Just curious.
---
If you can’t find it on the wiki(it is there though) look up a YouTube guide
---
Quite the opposite. Bans are very rarely manually handled.
---
Now do Zyliana
---
That completely defeats the purpose of an imbued slayer helm bro
---
Oh lol when I made the meme I was like “hmm 36? That sounds like something someone who’s good at this game could hit”
---
My max hit rn is like 26 cuz I’m noob
---
90k
---
okay, but the blue fog looks so wrong :-( Black skies ftw
---
No need, a couple people commented with the answer
---
Yeah I got 83 a few hours ago! I enjoy the pool to much
---
Or his Savage Lordship
---
ah
---
Nice what world you in I’ll come congratulate you
---
C H E S T B R A H
---
I never directly stated that you stated which demanded more effort.
---
Honestly man I can hardly hit on 45def with the gmaul. I fight piety builds sometimes and I just grab knives and a ballista because I know my maul will hit nothing at all. 
---
I'm 1def in a bracket where everyone is 90+ strength, I've been fucked up many times by massive stacks. You just can't get mad about that shit though, RNG is a big part of this game and if you can get that 1tick on me with some lucky hits then you deserve the kill. 
---
I think a lot of people want to be able to sit full HP with literally not a single chance at all of dying. That's lame, it's a luck based combat system and sometimes you're going to die when you don't want to.
---
Ok lol
---
not allowing splashing on rats in lummy was unpolled and doesnt affect game in a bad way
---
:P well "good" really just means "has gp/time to play" haha. I just got 99 range since ive been doing hydra and you get a fuck ton of range exp (4500 per kill). But i was upset that with rune darts your max hit doesnt change from 97-99 (maybe even 96 I cant remember) range with range pot :(. Only with dragon darts does it change which goes to 34. Which i think is kinda dumb.
---
Been on the mobile flex for a minute eh
---
Id say not compared to other bosses of similar profit
---

---
Costs money, you ain't doin it
---
Red over purple. The purple just looks lame IMO.
---
Nice guide! Didn't know number of armour upgrades reduced the max hit, not the armour itself. I use similiar strats, except i leave food for last as you dont need to drop and pick it up later (also helps with inv management).
---
Boy I hope they don't keep it like this. Knowing a monsters safespot-able tile and luring it there is a pretty big part of PvM like Fight Caves, Inferno, Quest bosses, etc. It's definitely an extra layer to a combat system that is pretty bare bones.
---
Incoming year long forced name change
---
Isn't that part of the "skill" though.
---
This is hands down the only reason people pk clue hunters... anyone who was going to stop.. will never now lol 
---
Nice risk. Love it
---
The NMZ is an instanced event. If you want to see what it looks like, you can look up videos about it.
---
When you die in the event or the event ends, you keep all items and respawn in the exact location. The said character is in.
---
One common thing people do in the NMZ is they flick prayers to avoid taking damage, sustaining they’re longevity in the NMZ instance. 
---
If someone were to leave the NMZ accidentally while running an auto clicker or a bot, they’re bot/autoclicker would continue to do the same action indefinitely; a bot/autoclicker will continue to prayer flick if he is taken out of the NMZ for any reason at all that he is not programmed to handle.
---
Since this specific character is standing in the exact place to leave the nmz, he is prayer flicking and has total level 1100 with 3 level 99 skills (all very bottable skills btw), it is very likely he is a bot.
---
Shoudl
---
Currently doing Ratcatchers for the first time. Nothing in this game has made me rage like this goddamn stealth section. I want to choke whoever designed it
---
nice tourny world lmao
---
Uses phone to take picture..still has to edit said picture lmao. You're on a desktop mang. Runelite even has a SS option built in. And reddit you can literally just drag the file to upload. 
---
I always bring blowpipe and 2 pc dhide, sometimes will take glory off to look noobier.
---
I don't get these Mat K memes, can someone explain :c
---
not /s
---
Pretty sure it's just a brightness difference. If there is a graphical downgrade then oh please cry me a river, what a tragedy.
---
Moving the goalpost? We're talking toxicity not convenience...
---
I bet you’re a real fun person to be around..
---
But the inferno is closed in beta worlds.
