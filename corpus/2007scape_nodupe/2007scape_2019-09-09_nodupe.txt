Or maybe imbue a runite grapple at nmz, or a new quest that gives you an unbreakable grapple? Something blessed by Armadyl, or an ancient relic from zeah.

---
This guy slaps your girls ass in the club, what do you do?
---
Yes and no. Starting Barrows is definitely easier but Construction is passive and fast while grinding enough Barrows chests for a full set of specifically Guthans will take a while.
---

---
If you just camp teaks in kingdom and grind 87 Slayer, you'll have enough teaks banked for 83 Construction most likely. And enough GP to pay for planks + butler costs to get the levels. So overall around 10 hours of active Construction training (including making the planks) while grinding full Guthans will definitely take longer in terms of active time spent on Barrows.
---
Karils top/bottom and Ahrims top/bottom are more useful than Guthans to me right now anyway. I want to do Zulrah and GWD. Torag top/bottom or Dharok top/bottom would be good for Bandos as well. Guthans is OK for healing on minions but B2P or blood barrage is better anyhow since you'll do it way faster (i.e. before the bosses respawn).
---
Nice
---
You can’t lmao unless you’re at the Ge constantly flipping for 15+ hours a day. Realistically you’ll make more like 5-10m a day flipping semi passively
---
My gf doesn't play but we race on own phones and it's really enjoyable, thanks for this!
---
Shouldn't even be a priority anymore
---
I went there on the weekend to afk for for my pure, ended up playing every game fully. Its amazing fun.
---
Nothing, that’s the point. It won’t get used. 
---
Even on pvp worlds, MOST banks are a safe zone.
---
For anyone else having trouble reading the fine print its 180m profit on 507,000 blood runes (I think)
---
Look at jad, react to an attack, do one (1) thing, then repeat. That one thing can be sipping a potion, tagging a healer, moving yourself, or simply just continuing. 
---
Don't try to sneak in too many extra actions.
---
Gz!@!@!@
---
Great advice, you fuck
---
It’s not a 14m margin lol. He just lucky and the items rose in price over the course of a few weeks. The actual margin on a t bow is like 500k roughly
---
Or you know use the fletching cape. Let’s just add a home tele to the fire cape while we are at it
---
People who are ignorant will still accuse you and assume. You can have 3k+ vork kills and loads of other things to show you've made at least half of your money and people won't care. You can show plenty of game knowledge, have quest cape with loads of diaries done, have relatively high total (1800+) and know hot to raid and people won't care. There's no line in the sand its just people pouring their insecurities and jealousy onto you.
---
The fact is it doesn't matter how anyone makes their money these days, people just choose to be mad about it. If the guy in the post made his gear through buying bonds who cares, he at least knows better than half the people on this game who actively RWT.
---
Was there all weekend. Games consist of randoms, high level max gear flag runners. A shit load of pures getting halos.
---
The game is actually insane fun.
---
Bringing life been would Heber to mean it was alive once
---
WildCC, everyone is welcome and we chat about pretty much anything :)
---
SotE is worth doing anyway in my opinion. It's a great quest and I enjoyed every second of it!
---
Autoclick rock cake
---
Thats actually an amazing idea.
---
You aren’t really that good with rhetorical devices are you?
---
You're supposed to burst Abbys?
---
Ok
---
Did lvl 5 all roles only one person left all other rounds went good :)
---
I find the easiest way to do jad is to have him spawn south of italy while you're on the north side, then when the healers spawn you can tag them one by one and lure them north of italy to kill them without worrying about jad. Where the wave 45 on wave 3 spawns is where jad spawns.
---
For range you can only look at his feet, the sound happens too late. With mage the sound is instant. Listen for mage, constantly watch his feet for range, and only do one other action (like tagging healers) between each attack.
---
In the first place I really like to pk for the sake of playing advanced Rock Paper Scissors so it’s kind of irrelevant to me but with the bh rework it will hopefully be fun to start from scratch and pk for money. The game has so much potential to be good but jagex caters to the short term rather than long term quality.
---
Up to mazchna for dogs, but yeah, still pretty niche unless you are grinding out points.
---
Come for the nostalgia, stay for the sweaty chair
---
This is so sad. Alexa play despacito
---
[removed]
---
Rapier plus 10m in gear is more dps than whip and max melee gear. So if you think buying a rapier is going to lower your dps then you're definitely comparing it to range.
---
Nice selfie you got going on there...
---
Silly argument , there is no reason that a piece of low level content which is extremly dead will not be revived just because you don't want to to hurt a very hard to get cape's ability that almost no one uses.
---
It makes much more sense to just replace the Fletching cape's ability with something else.
---
This is really cool, I’d absolutely enjoy something like this
---
Now for the 100cb diary cape!
---
Bro you can make that back ezpz don’t give up. Change your email and password, set up a new pin and get Authenticator. We can get that money back for you fast and you’ll be right back on your feet. Don’t let some fucking asshole ruin your experience. This game is great and you’re not going to want to miss out, especially over less that a mil.
---
I got hacked.. luckily they missed a couple items so I’m not entirely fucked.. my question is how did they get past my bank pin?
---
Best 2 options are nmz or ammonite crabs. Both with obby setup
---
Frog and snail is delicious, but fucking maggots? euuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
dragon grapple sounds dope. i could totally see it having a duel use as a ranged weapon that is a one-shot ammo that pulls enemies into melee range. but that would be strong.
---
It would be nice for Arma, 1 more inventory slot saved
---
If people keep panic selling them, they're just gonna keep getting more merched than they already are
---
No xp must be a beginner quest smh
---
LMFAO so true. If everyone just looked at the guide for 5 minutes they would save 2 hours of time.
---
You ever wonder why the majority of high-level players attack in teams, because it’s impossible to kill anyone with a brain with that “idea”. 
---
If you only use Ancients they can easily reach level 30 or a teleport lever with food, easy escape. 
---
If you only use Standard they can easily run away because you deal less damage and your freezes used to last nothing, easy scale, 
---
The way it is now Ancients is still superior if you’re in a team but solo Standards is actually viable.
---
Mining exp
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Source?
---
A source. I need a source.
---
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.
---
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.
---
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.
---
Do you have a degree in that field?
---
A college degree? In that field?
---
Then your arguments are invalid.
---
No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Correlation does not equal causation.
---
CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.
---
You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.
---
Nope, still haven't.
---
I just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter. A moron

64 minutes on first completion isn't bad at all. Nice man, grats!
---
Your iron, go get it on your own
---
Kbd is easier but your point still stands.
---
Next people are going to want tools on their belt
---
That's fair enough. I'm certainly open to the idea of non-MTX worlds, in the interest of bridging any integrity gaps. It's something I've been mulling over, in one form or another, for much of the process.
---
You’re a parody of yourself lol
---
Just-ah-sheer gang reportin'
---
What's the necklace?
---
ironman btw
---
SotE, MM2, DS2, Jad.
---
Jad itself is probably easier than everything but SotE, but it takes 40-80 minutes to get to before you can even attempt him and everyone is nervous when they get there.
---
Imagine thinking its not. Smh bro. Paying money for exclusive content has no place in osrs, even if timegated. Take your asain mmo shit elsewhere.
---
Im right here.
---
The toxicity!
---
Yes.
---
I think I’ll always feel a little like 12 years old as long as I’m playing this stupid game
---
When the fuck did you eat dolphin?
---
“It’s only midlevel if you’re good at the game” LOL
---
Wife low key reminding you that you have a wife damn
---
I'm using full obby, berserker necklace, b gloves, prims, berserker ring (I), firecape, avernic defender and a blessing just to fill that slot. I use supercombats instead of ovl and absorptions so I can afk longer at work.
---
I thought he was talking about split screen. The OSRS app is one of the few that is very unstable when using the split screen function of Android.

STONKS
---
People always say it wrong, they always says just ishi er, or justicar, both of which are wrong according to the wiki. But then we have shit like prffindas and ardougne that people couldnt give less fucks about
---
They are banning guys like those because they rwt their gold
---
I seriously doubt a bank would revive wilderness.
---
Frog burger looks really good ngl
---
think of firecape as a 10 hour grind. its like you go in there to get some ranged xp, and at the end you \*might\* get a fire cape. BC honestly it sucks but the first time you will probably get 1 shot by Jad's first attack, because he's fucking difficult. But you get better at clearing the first 60 waves more efficiently, try to do them with using the least amount of prayer/ food that you can, and you end up getting a lot better at pvm in general, learning some of the game mechanics better. And if you're lucky, maybe you get it on the first try, maybe attempt number 6, so it doesn't really take the whole 10 hours. But its worth in the long run bc you get plenty of xp, get better at the game, and a really really powerful cape. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ps I just got fcape this weekend. I got quest cape like 3 weeks ago. cb101 and it still took me 7 attempts. It was fun tho.
---
This is true. I tried to buy some a few days ago and had to get up to 3k to get 4 for birdhouses lol
---
loot tracker bug
---
Probably aisa
---
Imagine thinking it's okay to add elitism and exclusives to a game entirely based on spending time for status rather than money.
---
Let's be real, did fletching cape have much value to begin with?
---
But the mana sign says I have 1 point
---
[throwback to this](https://i.imgur.com/dJiZQw5.png)

That feeling never goes away, no matter how old you get.

Imagine still taking shit for playing video games at 28.
---
I took shit like that when I first started working cause I didn't know how to handle it and I was young (like 18), now I just laugh at people who try to make fun of video games and tell them to have going home and watching TV for 4 hours before going to bed.
---
Isn't getting ferocious gloves more strength than tassets?

What does your collection log say?

I'm saying pkers would be there. It would be extremely risky.

I came very close to making this exact same post last week because the Zulrah kill was the last thing I needed to do to have the Hard diary done. I also threw all my money at it after like the 30th try but I watched a video of a guy doing it in regular Void and the 2nd try after that I got the kill. I honestly died right as it died, too. But I still got the achievement done.

Then I found out that I needed 400 more pest control points for the elite set!

I use it for going from catherby tree patch to taverley tree patch but tbh it is faster to telly of course if you did nmz and got teleport scrolls.

Yeah, rather go dds gmaul with b-ring and firecape. But if im in the ballsy nh risk of a few mil anyway ill go claw maul with maul risk now.
---
When you get member you should do Quests, And work towards Herb runs, Bird houses and Varrock Diary for Daily profit. Barrows too is great money maker with low requirments, I touched upon all of these in this list. 
---
(You could also do blast furnace if you get coal bag fro MLM) 
---
 Smaller list of useful member Quests:
---

---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The\_Dig\_Site](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Dig_Site)  After doing Druidic ritual and training Herblore till lvl 10, Tourist trap (Enough agility xp for this quest). This quest will unlock you 1. Abillity to do the Bone Voyage quest (Unlocks fossil island for bird houses) 2. Abillity to do the Medium Varrock Diary. 3. Free mining and herblore xp. 
---
 [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bone\_Voyage](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bone_Voyage)  This quest unlocks you a easy way to get passive hunter xp and money. (You need to do Dig site before you can do this one) To get enough "Kudos"  
---
 ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kudos](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kudos))  I would recommend doing: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Natural\_history\_quiz](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Natural_history_quiz) (Gives enough xp to get Slayer and Hunter to lvl 9) [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock\_Museum#Specimen\_Cleaning](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Museum#Specimen_Cleaning) 
---
Then some quests that give Kudos when turned in one of the NPC's in the museum. (F2P are Demon slayer, Rune Mysteries and Shield of Arrav which also gives a 1k xp lamp for a skill over lvl 20) Now you just need to do 2 memberones I would recommend doing The Grand tree (gives good rewards) and Preist in peril (Its easy and fast, Also unlocks Morytania)
---
After doing Fairytale I, You should start doing tree runs. After getting to lvl 26 start doing herb runs with Harralander and limpwurt roots (Use Ultracompost on herbs! and Supercompost on Limpwurt, switch to rannar Herb when you unlock it) At lvl 31 you could start planting strawberries, its free xp and smaller profit.
---
After you did Bone Voyage and unlocked the Fossil island you can start doing Bird houses. 
---
Since you are lvl 9 by Doing the Quiz you can use the normal birdhouse.
---
The way you do them is , you 1. Make the birdhouses and put them in their spot. 2. You put some seed in them (hops are the cheapest way to fill them so buy Barley seeds 4 gp each.) They take 10 seeds per one birdhouse. 3. Wait a hour before comming back to get your xp and loot. 4. Repeat (Also look out for when you can use a better birdhouse (Oak at lvl 15 etc.)                                                                                                                   ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird\_house\_trapping](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird_house_trapping)).Before you start doing Bird houses, You should unlock [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mycelium\_Transportation\_System](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mycelium_Transportation_System) (Unlock every single one other than the "Sticky Swamp" one.) 
---
Then using Digsite pendant which you get by enchanting a ruby necklace (After you found a clean necklace while cleaning Specimen in the Varrock Museum.) You can teleport to one Transportation Mushroom and set up the bird houses around the island.   ([https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Digsite\_pendant#(5)](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Digsite_pendant#(5)))
---
Other than that I would recommend working towards doing barrows so, Underground pass for ibans staff  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Underground\_Pass](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Underground_Pass) Atleast Level 50 range for magic shortbow with rune arrows. And level up your prayer to atleast 45 for protect ion prayers. Wear tank gear And mage all of them other than Ahrim, which you use the Magic shortbow on. If you run out of prayer/food you should bank at castle wars using Duel ring, restore your stats in the portal and bank there for more supplies, Then just teleport back using a barrows teleport tab.
---
Another thing is that NMZ (Nightmare zone) is great for training melee stats, You get points which you can turn in for Herb boxes (Free money/herblore xp) and also special potions which you use inside the minigame. 
---
Now, You should also aim to complete the required quests/skills for Varrock easy and medium diaries. It allows you to buy discounted battlestaves daily and then sell them on the GE for profit. Also allows you to teleport directly to the GE with Varrock teleport
---
If you need help with anything just message me and I will try to help you out :)
---
TL:DR: Quests, Herb runs, Bird houses, Barrows. Varrock Diary
---
I could go for a pepperoni staff night now
---
I still have fun, maybe you're in a shit bracket.

at that point there's almost no point in having it break. it's just a grapple, they cost nothing - it's just ironmen that this would impact really, as it would be a steep level requirement to smith an addy or rune grapple. 
---
Really don't know about dragon grapple. Maybe we're getting a little carried away now lol. I don't know if having 'dragon everything' is a good thing (I'm aware some people want dragon nails etc). We started making Granite everything a couple years ago and now we have a bunch of ugly/niche items in the game.
---
As you get to the higher 80s you start to unlock the barrage spells which is helpful for fast xp and at 88 is smoke barrage for abyssal sire
---
82 (or maybe 83) you get magic imbue which is a good passive way to get magic xp. 
---
85 is teleblock if you're interested in pking
---
And as you level you will unlock teleports in the ancient, lunar and arceus spellbook you can put into a portal in your PoH. 
---
So yes, there are plenty of useful spells but nothing you need to quickly rush for. It's all dependent on how you play and your goals. I'm personally pushing for 88 right now
---
You should be fine man. BP spec using accurate with prayer on against the 180 for great heals. Save the specs for the 180s when you need them. Their def is super low I hit 30s on them sometimes (81 range). Bastion pots will help a lot too
---
Honestly, your comment sounds SUPER salty, lmao. People aren't ripping on him, just having a laugh at some obvious RWT. Also, your claim that everyone here has a rune drag alt is completely, utterly, entirely, 100% without evidence and you know that. Or did you check everyone's post history and see their posts about rune drag alts?
---
I don't mind questing. I just hate agility and getting 56 for regicide was painful enough lol
---
This and ironmen. I paid for mine on ironman early at level 30 or so.
---
U got Alzheimer’s?
---
Can we bring back EOC too please. #makeOSRSgreatagain
---
Yeah by the time you've got both you can get around without the grapple shortcuts. Cant tji k of one bar the observatory that is useful
---
DS2 was much harder in hindsight, but if you fail at DS2 you pay 100k to try again, and if you fail at Jad you pay by grinding ranged for an hour wasting a few prayer potions
---
As much as it is meme. This does devalue fletching cape perk.
---
Thabks
---
Dang, ive spent about 800k on it so far and then gave up and now im training str up to 70
---
Bart Simpson lookin ass
---
I wouldnt bother with the crystal shield and use a defender. You should be protecting range which nullifies is the crystal shields specialty (high range defence). And the defender helps kill the final phase faster which I feel like is better than going tanky since you'll take damage anyway.
---
I personally use blood burst (86 magic dont have barrage either) and it works for me just have to run south a bit to kinda avoid the melee spawns. 
---
Once I see myself at ~40 hp, I run south about 10 squares, then burst the group. Then I run another 5 or 10 and burst again. At some point, the spawns start turning around and ignoring you and then I run back to the boss and do another burst on my way back. 
---
I usually last 3-4 kills a trip (sometimes it's because i run our of magic doses that I use for smoke barrage). I didnt really get used to it untill about 60 kills in. Just keep trying things untill you find what works. 
---
I also recently started using a crystal haldberd as my spec weapon to just nuke the final phase.
---
I used arclight for my first 180 kills and a friend suggested trying crystal halberd to just nuke the final phase. Works really well for me I recommend trying it out
---
It fires men
---
I imagine outfit first for the achievement diary, then sell it to buy the top floor
---
My first 2 attempts i got smacked a bit by the rangers though it may have been bad luck i guess, was about 75 def i think using a similar setup but with a d hide body instead
---
Same here
---
I'm not currently using magic potions. Right now they'd only boost me from 86-90, meaning the only spell I'd pick up is shadow barrage. It's more expensive than smoke and with my current equipment isn't actually a max hit increase. Magic potions are honestly kinda the short straw of stat boosters, since spells have fixed max hits.
---
Shoulda been your age from hans inside!
---
I heard sanguinesti staff &gt; blowpipe at lil mut, dat true?
---
I really liked Cold War, those clockwork suits were awesome lol
---
I feel like we should eventually get a dragon grapple which is unbreakable.
---
Oops
---
Less clicks, can already have your spec locked and loaded.
---
I wish that 85 combat req on dream mentor was removed so people could try to go for lower than 85. Grats.
---
Bots don't get banned per IP address. That would mean, that the bot could, like you said, still log in on other IP addresses, which is not possible. I believe if a bot is noticed on a certain ip address, and only plays on that and then becomes banned, they'll probably monitor this ip address a bit more closely.
---
If you're asking this, because you want to bot smth: it's not worth it.
---
Was it tasty? I imagine it with garlic mayo and cracked pepper would quite nice!

You can buy reindeer meat, just google reindeer mince and you will see places that sell it. I think its most popular in Norway
---
random lucky impling flew by, pretty rare!
---
Scythe is like 50k now
---
What if you want to skull for better loot
---
Could be really early levels at f2p. But minotaurs are for ranging only so idk
---
Of course it’s sarcasm. But it could be interesting to see, like with the 6 jads, a mode with like 4 zulrahs
---
Gotta get into the groove and do it for 18 hours straight.
---
If you only need the diary kill, do a mage only kill. It simplifies things so much. Hide behind pillars during blue phases and attack the green phase. Beware of jad phase. It'll take a while for a kill, but it's a lot less to keep track of, and it'll work.
---
What are your stats? Also, I'm assuming you're f2p? Have you done vampire Slayer? Good atk exp for low leve
---
I know you think you're talking about that, but it only saves you money if you compensate with stamina potions, so you're wrong there.
---
Training agility for general benefit is different from slayer monsters directly dropping runecrafting xp lamps for absolutely no reason, lmfao.
---
Me too, it would open up pretty interesting account builds. Thanks :)
---
But how many hours?
---
I'm f2p haven't done vampire slayer and has 15 att, 15 str, and 11 def
---
I feel that man, but Lucky for you the tournament worlds are up. Its a really nice way to practice since you can set your gear and stats while also getting unlimited supplies. If its not up, then I would suggest getting 77 agility and an ornate pool/fairy ring in your house
---
The ones running big farms all use paid vpns with different ips for the bots
---
Yea the exact recipe i used was Toasted burger buns, beef tomato, red onion, lemon &amp; mayonnaise mix with capers and spring onions, lettuce and frogs legs coated in garlic butter.
---
Good luck for that ahaha I got the 85cb quest cape too, but diary cape is something else. It's probably something you can do at 100 cb, but you get above 100 so quick and bossing with 100 cb is hard
---
Like decent combat levels (90 95+prefferred)
---
They could have spoofed your IP address. No idea how hard is it to do. Just checked for virus and did you play on a public PC?
---
ezscape smh
---
Even such  a large company as Blizzard has stated that they have lost the source code for some of their older titles.
---
That sounds sweet
---
Anytime i hear someone say "my wife" i think they are in their 30s-40s. Having a wife at 25 seems so weird to me (22)
---
I can’t get over the lil amount of rune ores from 85-99 ... I just feel like it shoulda been more? I’ve seen a few loot to 99 MLM posts, and there is always barely any rune ore.
---
Thought my rng is shit for not having rangers at 105/115
---
i mean really all they can do is put out another blog that says "yup we're working on it" until something is actually done.
---
there's already been 2 blogs like this, and its only been about 3 months since the last one. i'm guessing they're holding back on putting out another bullshit nothing blog and waiting till somethings done.
---
although, this is probably wishful thinking. :(
---
DiNhs iS rIsK fReE bEcAUse YoU pROtEcT iT
---
Ely + sotd is allowed to be so much stronger because it's expensive. But also the price of dinhs doesn't matter because you don't risk it.
---
you don't need karil's since the only major advantage karil's has over black d'hide is mage def which doesn't matter much since you always pray mage when zulrah is maging you
---
How to make reset left click?
---
Yeah you don't get very much. I'd like to see a 99 MLM post with fally elite done as it gives you a better chance at higher level ores
---
Construction is buyable, and at its cheapest, it's over 400k xp per hour. It's definitely not fair or honest to compare cons and rc.
---
The core of this suggestion is wanting runecrafting xp lamps as drops from slayer monsters for no reason other than for another way to level rc without actually training the skill. Just curious, what's your rc level?
---
Also, maxing takes along time cause of the slower methods at the beginning. Going from 13m exp to 200m in cooking and fletching isn't relatively time consuming.
---
Dont have any specific request, just seems like itd be interesting to mess around with. 
---
I'll keep an eye out for a release, thanks :)
---
If I say it backwards will jamflex censor it?
---
I also choose this guy's wife.
---
Not really. You *can*, but most people don't for 2 reasons.
---
1) Splashes on nibblers. If you're in full justiciar + pegs, then even with a kodai + torm + occult you're still negative mage bonus. Nibblers have 0 magic defense, so it's still possible to land a freeze in this setup... But the chance to splash is much higher. This means it's generally better to unequip armor before trying to catch the nibblers, then re equipping it, and doing that whole dance... Or just deal with the splashing and spend more time in the middle tanking everything while trying to kill the nibblers.
---
2) Pride. There's a certain stigma about people that use full justiciar to do the inferno, and some streamers have even went as far to make entire meme streams about it (Praying mage and running south every wave, pretending to freak out or not notice as they just casually tank a melee/ranger off prayer, etc.). Because of this, a lot of people want to get their cape without justiciar just so they won't have to deal with the occasional "Yeah but justiciar cape, undeserved".
---
110 combat, no torso. Fuck minigames
---
What’s your total level?
---
Hcim btw
---
Veracs helm actually has more prayer bonus (+3 on Veracs v.s. +2 on Justiciar)
---
Doesnt matter. Zeah runecrafting at 45k an hour made the skill afkable so I dont get why your against a littlr passive exp that would amount at most 1 or 2k per hour
---
No.

New content: Dragon grapple.
---
 
---
Drops from: BottFace PooNose
---
Special attack: Dragon grapple special attack had a chance to grab a jagex support ticket from the mini game Gold “wallet sink” Grab when collecting cash stacks from the pay per play mini game.
---
Uses: use these tickets to appeal a false ban, hacked account, email change, etc.
---
“Please note that these tickets do not have a 100% success rate and should be used accordingly.
---
Try and find mod skynet on jagex staff
---
That happens to me with gpu rendering. It just crashes randomly, sometimes after like an hour and sometimes it works.

I ate gator sandwich at an airport terminal once. I had gator before, but I don't know what the hell I was thinking getting it there; it was oily and nasty AF and I had to fight the urge to puke the entire flight.
---
It's like the Verac's helm... But better defense, comparable prayer bonus, and doesn't degrade. The offensive stats (or, rather, offensive penalities) are identical so yeah.
---
It's a kinda niche use, but mostly for people that want to tank stuff in range armor (Like when doing fight caves, inferno, solo sara/zammy, etc.). Kinda loses its point if you're really good at prayer flicking, but for the average PvMer it's the best option.
---
Would be hell for ironmen because I’m pretty sure the meta for obtaining obby armor requires Fire cape if not the entire store and dropping monster
---
Fresh outta 2006
---
^^^ also obsideon cape
---
Are you going to use seaweed on that eel sushi, or are you going to use genuine swamp weed?
---
Also, is it even possible to eat eel sushi?
---
Double ds
---
Honestly cant deal with doing barrage tasks. Im just trying to get 99 the fastest way  possible for raids.
---
One solid question my man, "u mad bro?"
---
&gt;30k is a lie and you know it
---
Yea man I have got nothing to do but lie to people about my barrows runs on reddit. Average means nothing. I can see each chest loot on runelite. Believe what you want.
---
you are literally the best. this is exactly what i needed. i didn’t even know where to start &amp; this helps so much. thank you so much dude
---
As described the entire problem is how he reacted. Own that shit. RS is awesome and he should play it up and talk about how awesome it is and take all insults as compliments instead of moping around as if he got caught crying over a broken pencil or something.
---
Also- 
---
Anyone know of a pvp cc that would welcome a noobie who will probably ask a hundred dumb questions?
---
the sad part is that he didn't take their attempted insults as compliments and immediately beam with pride "fuck yeah I play OSRS. that game is awesome."
---
Teasing only works if you're willing to let other people dictate what you should be ashamed of.
---
Surprised this one got so much attention. Hope Jmods take notice.
---
Guess I gotta stick to my recent name
---
costs a lot to use, not so much better than the alternatives that it justifies the cost, not as rare as previously thought
---
Nah rune pick was the highest I used
---
Sounds like you need a better cc if they cant even tank gwd
---
birdhouses? what are the requirements for that? &amp; how exactly do you profit from that?
---
1. We don't know they don't
---
2. Pretty sure it isn't actually that hard to spoof MAC addresses (never done it myself tho so idk)
---
You think this is a fucking game?
---
Lms is probably your best place to learn, and good tribrid setup it gives you as well.
---
Higher strength and range will do, for learner raids if you trying to do cox asap.  78 herb will help also so you can contribute and make revites and aids. 
---
But base 90s is also reccomended.
---
just buy one
---
good times
---
Link?
---
Boots and ammy before chest/leg armour! Torso is bis for melee dps so definetly upgrade that after everything else is maxed. Obsidina platelegs are cheap and the upgrade to tassets is way less of a gp/worthwhile than primordials or torture
---
Don't lose hope! One of my old friends with a placeholder name actually came back.
---
I swear I've gotten a clue reward identical to yours earlier
---
Spoken like sometime who can't afford a scythe in the first place. All you need is for the scythe to break even and it's more than worth using for pet hunters. Gp cost isn't a relevant resource when you own all bis gear.
---
Economics are ruled by laws indeed, but gp isn't the main resource for a lot of players (especially people who own scythes, they're far more likely to value pets and XP rather than gp). Scythe is probably the item I use most outside of raids excluding tbow, it is absolutely overpowered and destroys the next best melee option by a landslide when it's bis. Scythe, tbow, and bp are all equally busted.
---
Honestly killing jad is like the intro to your first real pvm challenge. I just did it for the first time and am very proud. I’m learning zulrah now. I also safespot Callisto a lot lol.

Ok aside from my full novel of a reply ill take the bait.

What was your acc like?

How long did you try for?

I finish work in a couple hours and if your up for it, im keen to have a full discussion on this in DM and i wont call you kid or disregard any point you make.
---
He's known for going to vegan protests and just chomping down on raw meat and organs in front of them.
---
[Here is the clip](https://youtu.be/CvIYB5ahxio) . He says some white supremicists talking points, specifically the, “great replacement” or the “white genocide” argument
---
Would I be correct in assuming that you're concerned that it they could be misleading, or immersion-breaking? I'm actually inclined to agree when it comes to *gear*, as exotic otherworldly apparel tends to obfuscate the character's strength, resources, progress, etc. I was leaning more toward the idea of cosmetic *animation* overrides. Things like emotes, teleport animations; somewhat inconspicuous things that generally aren't seen for more than a moment. I don't know how close I am on that matter, but I certainly hope I can assess the impact properly as things develop. If it becomes apparent that something is going to confuse or mislead players, that's definitely something I'd have to reconsider and take back to the drawing board.
---
I'll be considering various monetization options throughout the process, hopefully I can devise a decent number of benign revenue streams :)
---
Probably had a CB and Obby Cape on.
---
Headed straight for Zulrah i think
---
Rock a strength ammy and assert dominance
---

Hey that's pretty cool

I have to update my eye prescription after that
---
No one will buy them from BH store until seeds are like 150k+ gp, but you're right.
---
Password wasn't obvious at all and i wouldn't fall on a phishing link so i don't really know how someone got it.
---
If possible add 2FA to yout email or change email to ine that has 2FA like gmail or some others.
---
If you’re in f2p then nobody gives a fuck. High level bots in p2p altering the economy is a different story.
---
I still wish people wouldn't crash upstairs either if they can help it. Yes, for those 15-27 seconds, everyone can mine all they want, but the lead-up to that timer triggering is dependent on when anyone mines their first ore, and after the timer the vein goes away when someone mines once. This means that with multiple people, you're at a disadvantage if you don't get the first ore or the last; first since you had essentially been wasting time up til then, and last since you had been wasting time swinging at an empty vein at that point.
---
how do high risk worlds even work? are the bones enough risk ? 
---
I am pretty good about logging quick enough, but that seems cool to have the bank chest at spawn
---
Potentially, but it wouldn’t make sense for someone who has end game content gear, barraging a monster you’re supposed to melee... probably bonded that gear
---
I imagine that probably came forth only due to the mass immigration as more and more ppl come to eu countries they tought mmmh why do i see so many arabs around? And why do whites get less children? They want to replace us!
---
I mean yeah in those countries they are becoming minorities in some parts but thats due to the mass immigration/refugee crisis. Just look at russia or other countries that are still completely white almost. That conspiracy is just grounded on no proof
---
There is white racism in africa going on tho, like in south africa or zimbabwe etc, but thats another thing and there is no white replacement in first world countries lmao.
---
I'm doing mlm for the diary and coal bag for training smithing. Where do you mine in general then? I was doing 3 tile iron and was gonna do granite after 75
---
We can always have a new monster drop it
---
It's a lot easier to manual ban the amount of bots that would end up at zulrah after such a change. Right now there's almost no pre reqs so there's definitely more bots at zulrah this way.
---
Are you sure you changed your password on the runescape website
---
afk, relaxing, non intensive way to skill and passively get good rewards
---
all teh way to 99? fucking insanity lmao
---
He rolled potions its on the mega rdt
---
I think the problem with the idea of grapple shortcuts is that in any place where you'd use a shortcut is when you are passing through a area and don't have teles. Otherwise if you need to visit a bank, you'd bring a tele. (ex: maybe the 2 useful ones i've ever used once walking through was catherby to taverly once, to explore and do tav dung until remembering "Oh wait, poh tablets are 1 slot and better too!" and watchtower yanille to ogretown for watchtower quest. (Oh wait.. i just ran all this way! i better go run back to bank without a tele to skip a 3 second walk around.. Gee that looks tempting, but nah!) \*does quest and never uses again.\*
---
Look lets face it, in any situation where you'd consiously bring a item slot to save time, you either would A: bring a closer tele/fairy ring (which are more abundant and usable anywhere and more convient), or b: use a normal shortcut because it's convient. Grapple shortcuts are cool thematically but neither of those things imo. They're often A: Obscure B: Minor time savers C: a waste of inv space and D: Stash units don't exist, if they did, they might see limited use like how rs3 let people build stash units for them.
---
I got shit once for having a fire cape and rune gloves because I dont have 175qp yet. 
---
Took the gloves off and put on the crab claw to pretend I'm fashionscaping because I'm self conscious about it now. That shit cut me deep man.
---
they also use melee, and dhide has higher melee defense bonuses so the marginal difference between karils and d'hide is minimal
---
LOL
---
When i had to do it for diary i practised in tournament world with all 99s and max gear, still couldnt kill it lol. So i account shared fuckin checkmate snake cunt
---
I like this idea a lot. Kill multiple zulrah's for multiple gp / hr rates. 
---
Anyone want to join my newly formed bot clan ?
---
Nope..
---
Too easy for woox
---
With your tbow on the ground
---
Smh

How's about you get a fletching cape
---
What is the quickest way to get a fossil on Fossil Island? 
---
I’m a fairly experienced player but have only just completed Bone Voyage to access the island. Right now I’m just trying to complete the task lists for the different areas. The last task I need for Northern Reaches is feeding an enriched bone into the machine on the House on the Hill. I spent a solid hour swimming around collecting mermaid tears to trade in for one fossil. When I used the fossil on the mycelium pool it dissolved and was lost, even though I was adding calcite and pyrophosphite like the wiki suggested. I’m pretty frustrated and the prospect of spending a bunch more time swimming around collecting tears to get another fossil makes me want to leave the island as it seems full of boring grinds...
---
Bahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha
---
So you blindly trusted the man. Even if he follows you to the chaos temple, someone else could just run along. 
---
You’re a complete moron and shouldn’t get any compensation. 
---
Stand by your own actions kid.
---
Im pretty sure anyone smart enough to breathe would know better than to drop their twisted bow and teleport away from it... lmfao you a troll? Or just dumb as dirt?
---
What do you mean?
---
Down-voted for making a funny. lol rip.
---
Did lose my slay helm which was imbued. No fc tho just got 75 ranged.
---
How do you know their bots?
---
CoX drops are better but they're not the difference between scythe and tbow that would make scythe 500m less. 
---
Defender - BiS everywhere
---
Justiciar - Inferno/rune drags/wildy/bandos
---
Sang - Solo raids/kraken/thermy/zulrah
---
Rapier - BiS slayer (one handed weapon anyway) / cm raids
---
Scythe - both raids/bandos/cerb/sire/thermy/garg boss/skotizo/
---
There's alot of niche uses for the items but it doesn't really take anything away. CoX drops are better but raids 2 ones aren't bad despite Jagex being incompetent when making them. I mean, just with all the ToB item prices alone, there's no way scythe drops below 500m at worst.
---
Fighter torso is going to be your BIS str bonus until you can afford Bandos and then quest for a berserker and then helm of neitznot
---
1 iq
---
So you haven't got an actual answer?
---
Nice.
---
Thats the worst scam i have heard about
---
That isn’t how it works
---
Or he's just 70 defence and can't wear prims yet. OP didn't show any combat level or stats lol
---
My current stats- 
---
[Stats](https://imgur.com/a/EpIIpLF)
---
Exacly, it sounded way better in my head
---
Immersion-breaking is probably closest to how I would describe the problem. In addition to what i already outlined the other problem I have with cosmetic MTX overrides is they are not diegetic. I think some games and other RP systems frame it so you're receiving divine favour or like, and while it's more favourable than the items arising spontaneously it doesn't solve the problem so much as kick it further down the road.
---
Short animations are definitely less obtrusive, but by that virtue they're less marketable
---
You’re 15 years late. There have always been bots yet the game lives 🤷‍♂️.
---
Jokes aside, I always get much too excited when there's a new episode
---
Idk, i"m a 28 yo teacher aswell and play runescape, my colleagues know and my students as well, I ain't promoting it and I ain't hiding it. As long as I assume it, people don't care about it.
---
So what? What was your plan to get back til your tbow before it despawn?
---
well said...
---
That my friend is why I traded my Bandos in for justicar. Ring of suffering i, zammy hasta, Slayer helm, guardian boots, furry, barrows gloves, super defense potions. 1 inventory of sharks last over half a task.
---
Judging by OP's post and his repsonses to the comment i can safely tell that he is an inbred.
---
Im very happy with the new elf character looks and the pvp updates. nice job.
---
I’ll take all those DHCBs, thanks.
---
Those gloves are even more beta than the cape lmao
---
Make it a diary req, uselessness solved.
---
I need 4k for that

What’s significant about 92 other than being halfway?
---
Yeah my goal was to keep all the Rune items to atleast 90 or 92 slayer, but i need the money now for miscellania and construction. Im in a pinch
---
I bet hes wearing eternal boots
---
Never heard that one before.
---
Low quality bait. Not even worth a PSA because literally no one is stupid enough to do that, especially someone capable of building a bank that could liquidate for thow. I don't believe this happened at all.
---
Only 3rd party training wheels can relate or detect that
---
 As its history indicates, the popular use of the word *racism* is relatively recent. The word came into widespread usage in the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism), which saw "race" as a naturally given political unit. It is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word, but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is and what it is not.
---
Haha, added. Don’t worry, nothing offends me.
---
Oh, are these the ones beneath MM2? Makes more sense lmao
---
About as true as anything on 4chan.
---
Which is to say, there's some truth in there and a whole lot of throwing in confusion and hate just for lulz.
---
If they found a permanent solution they would be the first to stop cheating in the gaming industry. They already ban about 100k bots weekly which is quite impressive.
---
MLM is more relaxing, and doesn't force the player to interact with teams or  undesired zeah.
---
4200kc here, no pet, I just wanna stop :s
---
You could have atleast thrown the salamander at him
---
The western provinces diary req would be horrific
---
Honestly put it behind song of the elves and buff the gp drop again. I went yesterday and the 30-60k drops felt weak - de-motivated me to do zulrah. Off to vorki I go!
---
Agreed.
---
Is the staff too much money for doing zulrah? For good profit
---
That's part of the point. Using the completely wrong gear with confidence.
---
There's a shortcut?

Sign up for https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it's free and will tell you if your email ever ends up in a breach or list, check your passwords against it's database, use Keepass or LastPass to manage your passwords, use 2fa for every account you can, especially your email, and especially don't use the same password multiple times.

You know the scene is obscure and unrelatable when no one has responded 11 hours in on a gaming sub
---
this, if you need a client to 1tick a dds gmaul you're not gonna kill anyone anyways lol
---
It literally says the same thing, except is out of date. Each 3rd age item is 12 times less likely than potions, but there's 12 of them so the probability is the same to land on 1 non-specific piece
---
yeah but maybe, just maybe, this post was a joke?
---
Would adding summoning ever be considered? 
---
Currently the meta is to use your alt as a beast of burden to bring supplies to your main and or restore spec for your main as well.
---
How do you have a tbow and fall for this
---
Why bother even submitting questions when they're completely disregarded. You should ALWAYS address comments that have the highest upvote given that people share the same sentiment or want to know more.
---
My b I thought they added in something so you can’t just go in the wild and keep changing, gotta pick between the two? 😔
---
What exactly was the thought process of suggesting the unskull scroll as a LMS reward?
---
The reason for removing the ability to unskull in clanwars was because it was really shitty to have people pk unskulled with 3/4 good items and now you just bring that exact same issue back if you now add a scroll that allows you to unskull.
---
If you justify adding the scroll by saying that it will be somewhat uncommon and expensive you also miss the point of PvMers asking for a way to unskull because its not worth a lot money to them to unskull. The only reason they care about unskulling is because of potential back to back abyss clue scroll steps because they dont want to bring an abyssal bracelet with them.

\*kharazi
---
Drop it and keep grinding xp
---
I would not attempt to use void with your defence level especially. Raids scale in difficulty based on the stats of the person who started and the amount of people. Even a budget setup from the we do raids discord is in most cases a lot better than void. Void is only really good in masses.
---
Id say get 90+ mage and range and 85+ in all melee stats. Your prayer is fine. 80-85+ in farming and 78 herblore is only used in preparation and assuming you wont be soloing these would be stats to train on later as you can just try and volunteer for scavs/ running gourds.
---
Youll find a lot more beginners information in we do raids discord although i do think joining mentor raids requires a minimum of higher stats.
---
nobody ever asked for your input either
---
potions. and so on.
---
This means:
---
gilded platebody = 12/42,120
---
third age platebody = 1/42,120
---
super energy potions = 12/42,120
---
(chances of getting a megarare item that is not third age: 108/42,120. Chances of getting a third age item 12/42,120. As you can see you're more likely to get potions or gilded, than third age)
---
That's why I paid someone to get the kill. Cba to fucking learn that shit. $5 and saved me the headache.
---
When is the game coming out?
---
Suggestions?
---
2 hydrogen 1 oxygen lmao
---
Make crackers for christmas lmfao

Talking about the runelite kc command not the OP's post, since you can't change the game chat kc message you idiot

How many people duels take place daily?

 For someone to hit 2^15 is expected eventually.

Same guy btw
---
Can you address the frame stuttering that players get while inside the demonic gorilla cave? This has been in-game for over 3 years now and 3rd party clients shouldn't be the fix that players have to rely on. Jagex, plz fix.
---
Absolute unit
---
This is sick, you should actually make more of these dude
---
Can you explain why you keep adding mechanics that work different in the wilderness. They are hard to keep track of and most of them are never explained inside the game.
---
I’mma let you finish, but Settled has some of the best videos of all time
---
lol
---
But can you actually click in game? on the android app they don't handle mouse events only tap events
---
Why not?
---
It was just sarcasm my man
---
Def don’t play the lottery, you just used all that luck on the pet lmao
---
Sounds like you enjoy skilling tho why not play a like you normally would?
---
Been saying this since release. The scythe value only exists for getting more scythes. Scythe bis for tob that gets more scythes. Scythe goes down tob is less gp per hour people sell scythe as it's primary use is for tob and that snowballs.
---
(I paid 1.5 for mine boyz)
---
congatz ;D. Farming should be the hardest skilling pet since you have to wait for your patches to grow. Farming pet is also my first pet @ 85 farming from a papaya tree.
---
Why is this here
---
Replace the mith grapple altogether with this new item. Have it require 98 smithing and no drop sources so Ironmen can't do medium diaries.
---
The blowpipe is expensive too y'know? People use that legit everywhere even if you aren't making anywhere near the amount of money back.

Could a shortcut be added to the first room of the cave from the legends guild quest to the cavern below it. Requiring completion of either dragon slayer 2 or elite karamja diary. 
---
There is a master clue scroll step there and it is one of the most annoying steps. Not only do you need multiple items to get through the cave rooms + a long run, it is only 1/3 of a master clue piece. 
---
If it was a full clue step of its own rather than being 1/3 of a step that could be another way of fixing the problem instead of a shortcut
---
😭

Imagine holding this opinion knowing full well what you risk upon entering the wilderness. I think that you should re enable the warning screen that you get upon crossing the ditch just to remind you as getting upset and spiteful at someone who’s playing an element of the game as it’s intended is just simply retarded.
---
This makes me happy and warms my heart to think about
---
Do check out newly update kourend
---
nah cause people are trying
---
Too much.
---

---
Already exists, just talk to Oziach first
---
I found it easier to just ditch the pictures and do it reactionary after like 10 kc, I found myself dying because I was looking at the picture and trying to think ahead a lot more often than from the extra damage I took by having to do stuff reactionary
---
We should get gilded one, from clues
---
im on mobile but yeah u think I could do that
---
With Warding failing at the polls, has the team put any thought into other ways mid/high level pvm gear/alchables and clue items may be removed from the game?
---
Perhaps it could just be a "well of goodwill" type of thing (change for legal reasons) that shows who puts in the most items and the most gp value of items per day/week/year.

Nope, I took out the bones

Indeed
---
Ah you mean the idiots of Reddit who complain about people who enjoy PVP or PVM :') Not to mention another version of the game.
---
I would so fucking play a Pokémon remake if every sprite and item was changed into RuneScape theme. CAN THIS BE DONE PLEASE
---
It's also really really good when it can utilize it's 3 hits.
---
RWT the acc and the bow, no way someone whos actually quested barrows gloves + assembler is wearing that

Still an amazing job though.

hydra being locked behind Konar is pretty much the only thing holding its uniques' prices high.

I bought frozen ones online from the same place that I ordered a load of RuneScape fish from

The whips sort of balance out the costs. it definitely goes faster than using melee, but feels bad until you get a whip drop for sure.

This is why I get sad when people say “at least you’re making good money!” When I show them my 10K Thermy KC without the pet. You’ve killed less than half of my Thermy KC and you’ve made roughly 130M more than me lmao. Good luck, brother. Soon enough you’ll have it.
---
Is there an exact formula on how combat level impacts the scaling of raids bosses stats and points?
---
Could this scaling down be toggled off via an NPC, similar to how you can toggle on slayer assignments that are normally inaccessible at lower combat levels.

Where can i find the screenshots?

There's a huge floor in your argument.

Again, without knowing what your screen looked like, I couldn’t have given you useful examples.

Now that I do, why are you using 130% UI scaling? Hard of sight?

You’re going to get issues on most games with an 130% UI scaling, that is what’s wrong here most likely.

When I did my PC grind for elite I started getting bored and wearing fashionscape and troll gear. As long as you get the min dmg it doesn't really matter, and if you get a few people questioning your dumb gear choice it just provides some much needed entertainment
---
Volcano mine giving a meta shifting amount of gold ore would be overpowered given that its meta for exp unless you do granite.
---
lmao just make Jagex move countries
---
You missed the part where he says: ‘L0000000000L’
---
Bots arent the only problem, also shopscape in general is universally reviled.
---
So over the course of 3 months, it's about 5.5 days, assuming a roughly similar amount of XP each day. Not a huge amount, but definitely enough to consider going and getting that D pick with the 5.5 days instead.
---
Honestly I think that him being monotone makes it better because he sounds like the burger king foot lettuce guy.
---
In all seriousness it makes me incredulous when he figures out how to break stuff, especially when the solutions are so obscure, and still sound like its no big deal.
---
These are so well done!
---
Well we need visas to travel, i dont think runescape is a viable reason for visa at least the ambassador will think like that 😄
---
Fuck off, dude
---
No idea.
---
Coal was the definitive 10 pick for Kingdom, as it would net like 60-75k a day.
---
Now, mining isn't even top 3. It's frequently below 20k/day at kingdom.
---
Isn’t this witch hunting?
---
burst nechs for sure, dust devils will give you slightly longer trips if you're not high alching with an alt but also slightly lower xp/hr.  Nechs should also profit slightly where dusts will be more breakeven.
---
If you want afk, the big bloodvelds are probably the best.
---
I just run to a portal, double claw spec and go afk with auto retaliate on lol

That looks like it would heal way more than 2 hp, well done

Mediocre??

This is straight off google so I’m guessing maybe you’ve tried it, but this is something similar my friend had to do:
---
Open Play Store App.
---
Tap Menu -&gt; Account -&gt; Country and Profiles.
---
Select the country of choice.
---
Follow the instructions and add a payment method.
---
Wait up to 24-hours for the change to go through.
---
That's an interesting strat that I woulda tried but thank God I have no reason to ever go back there.
---
I can't say for sure but it seems likely that's the case.  Perhaps not even combat, but just being in the middle of an uninterrupted activity will delay the log out timer until you become idle again.
---
Coins going straight to your inv is from the ring of wealth :P

There's people in this thread right now who **don't** think J1mmy's By Release is the best osrs content on youtube right now.
---
smh my head
---
Examples would have been along the line of 27" @ 1080p, 32" @ 1440p+ (IIRC those are the recommended "ideal" sizes for the respective resolutions. Seating distance does also come into it though). You don't need to know what someones monitor looks like to give examples for what sizes work well with what resolutions and if we're honest isn't really even relevant to begin with.  
---
Though obviously OSRS isn't going to play nice with higher res monitors being that its an old as shit game. Hence the runelite UI scaling to compensate.
---
I'm having literally no issues, I just jumped into the conversation.
---
130% scaling because that puts the UI at roughly the same size as it would be on a 1080p panel. Just what I'm used too.
---
Agreed

I’m 81 range with full god dhide and can’t

Perhaps he made a screenshot, pasted it in word, took a picture of that with the phone, transfered the image back to his computer and uploaded it to reddit?
---
You wont get a rollback even if you do get ahold of customer support. They just dont do that
---
Well I think those requirements are ridiculous. Completionist cape was never meant to be that difficult, but to each their own
---
How it drops is debatable but I think that's a pretty sweet idea tbh
---
Can you revive some of the dead content coming from rev drops? Such as the Amulet of Avarice, Thammaron’s Sceptre, and Ancient Crystal. For the amulet you can have it note players items as well as NPC items and have it be turned into coins on death. Thammaron’s Sceptre could just use a simple buff, maybe against the undead like Vet’ion. And Ancient Crystals could simply be implemented into more high end construction, maybe a wilderness room, or pkers room.
---
Not everyone can learn that quickly. You may notice your mistakes quickly and adjust for them quickly but some people will miss the mistakes they're making for a few deaths then they may take another death or 2 to get that right before they can move on to the next mistake.
---
Would swipe right tbh
---
It's how I did a lot of levels too. But the idea would be to replace with an equivalent, or only slightly slower method, also taking mining exp into account.
---

done with this fucking game shit support
---
It’s already there, once a mouse is connected you can click the mouse within the AssistiveTouch settings and remap left and right click as well as the scroll wheel.
---
If he had more uploads then maybe. Settled had been pumping out videos for far longer.
---
its a playstyle where you dont gain any combat xp and try to complete as much of the game as possible.
---
since you only "skills" those accounts are refered to as skiller.
---
correction. Hes not rolling in gp to blow on a book that isnt that good because 99% of things you use magic on in this game have 0 mage level and dont need mage bonus to kill.
---
I kind of wished that whenever you dropped salamanders, they would walk around for a bit before dissapearing

This happens like everyday. Appeal the ban and theyll see it had unusual login patterns. And secure your damn account lol put 2FA on a bran new email and only use that for rs. Put on auth and a bank pin.

If you knew how many people buy and sell gold you wouldn't care. Maybe it's new to you and you don't know but the fact is that a lot do buy gold, the buyers rarely get punished though and they never get permanently banned, those are reserved for sellers only. And Jagex RWT just as much but at a more expensive price. 
---
If he actually did something bad I wouldn't sub but since it's just selling gold in a game which sells gold itself, I couldn't care less.
---
The Alchemical Hydra is a very good boss, but there's a few issues.
---
The shortcut tunnel is very handy, and I like it, but sometimes it messes up when you're replying to someone in a private message, I think it's because of the messages you get in the chat box about the foul smell and such, can this be looked in to?
---
The first hit of every Hydra kill is a 50/50 coin toss if you're going to take damage or not, this does not feel like good game design.  
---
You can avoid literally every other attack by either movement or counting, but it's really annoying starting every kill with a gamble.  
---
I know it's already somewhat of an easy boss, and it brings an insane amount of GP, it would be a buff but it's really disappointing that you can start the kill down 34 HP down without messing up.
---
his videos do show skill but he milks the fuck out of every “meme” he does and he just sounds monotone as shit.  a problem too many youtubers tend to have

how is rendi not the same structure? low level stuff; he has an idea, that idea fails, he has another idea involving alts and friends: he spends days doing it to finally do it.  same thing every video lol

Empty roll on RDT. For some reason, shamans dont drop bones when they roll RDT, which is why you will occasionally just get 3k coins or a Rune Baxe without bones from them

---
i canteven find how to submit ticket they keep asked stupid things

The structure is kinda intentional, settled has said he really likes making every episode having a goal being introduced and him working towards that goal for the episode. If you look back on his uim series it was kinda similar.

If they want to do integrity changes like this, don't poll them and add them to the game. Blatantly ignoring poll results completely destroys all their credibility and the purpose of the polling system, regardless of how important the update is.

Also not playing on any device for a couple of hours did not fix this problem. Any way to fix this?

I think his monotone adds a lot to his humor. I always pictured it as intentional and its pretty funny to me. Like how can you sound so calm and bored while discussing the most intricate details of a game
---
Actually it's helping me, people reading this post for whatever reason are dumping their partyhats for under market and i'm scooping them up. I already started buying again for a low price.
---
That shelf is a mess
---
There is a decent amount of multitasking so there is skill involved. switching gear, switching prayer, moving and dodging clouds. Then you have a different rotation every time you go in. Some use zulrah rotation guides as well so that's another thing for them to look at and manage (never use rotation guides, they hinder more than assist in my opinion). It can be overwhelming compared to other bosses in the game where you can stand still with 1 prayer 1 set of gear and just outheal.

Fossil island includes; Birdhouses for easy+profitable hunter xp especially at lower levels, ammonite crabs for combat training, hardwood tree patches for cheap farming xp/new spot to train WCing, various skilling methods like sulliusceps, herbiboar, underwater stuff and more.
---
Zeah (the continent containing the whole area including kourend/kebos) has way too much stuff to type out in general. Wintertodt (firemaking xp) and Catacombs (slayer location) are what stick out to me as the for all levels content but there is so many different skilling things and combat things that are offered over there.

That diary, like all elite diaries, already has several high level requirements.  So it'd be unlikely that a "super-grandmaster" quest would affect *that* many players in this regard.  But I see your point.  I also think you could just replace the QPC requirement in that diary with another high level requirement, which makes more sense to me anyway because I think QPC is already an altogether separate achievement that is clearly not just based on Lumbridge/Draynor anyway.  The mods have mentioned creating a new "all-inclusive" Achievement Diary covering every area in the game (which, presumably, would have very high requirements itself), so maybe just move the QPC requirement to *that* new diary and replace it for the L/D diary.
---
Can we revert the change earlier this year to the desktop client with the "player support tab"?

Many would agree that the iconic ignore smiley should be where the "player support tab" icon is, and it's almost irrelevant that there's a bond button in the settings, where I believe the player support tab should be.
---
But my luck is 100.. Thanks!

"Bluebutt69 spent each day diligently skilling along Catherby. He loved watching the lobsters pile into his pot and the twinkling of numbers that followed. Each one fading into the warm salty breeze. Bluebutt69 was a good citizen. He never bothered anyone. He would lend the occasional law rune, should he see a chattering bank stander in need. If there was ever a moment he could be fishing or cooking, he was there. Bluebutt69 didn't interact with anyone much. But he didn't mind. He was frequently visited by his friend the Drunken Dwarf, The Mysterious Old Man, and the cutest Strange Plant you'd ever see. 
---
Bluebutt69 was truly one of your average, rolemodel players.
---
At least...in almost every aspect.
---
Bluebutt69 did have *one* secret.
---
His one weakness. His beloved Sandwich Lady. 
---
Although he could not quite call her -his- just yet, he knew some day, deep down in his loins, he would claim her.
---
Or rather... that she might claim him.
---
For you see, it was not just her graceful body that called to him, nor was it simply the delicious sweets she offered that tempted him so.
---
No..it was something much more...savory.
---
It was none other than her baguette.
---
She was never without it.
---
Each day that she would appear, was his new favorite day.
---
Bluebutt69 longed for that baguette. 
---
He first discovered his breadly desires when he had not noticed her appear.
---
Sandwich Lady, upset at his lack of attention, gave him a solid whack with it.
---
He let out a most curious yelp, and quickly turned around to see his beloved firmly grasping a hot, fresh, thick baguette.
---
The smell alone made his mouth water.
---
But what she had just done with it, made his legs tremble. He dropped to his knees, nearly falling into the water he was fishing in behind him.
---
He thought not of his lobster cage, which had now begun sinking into the ocean.
---
Bluebutt69 was focused only on the baguette..and the wicked glint in Sandwich Lady's eyes as she towered above him.
---
Somewhere within him, an appetite stirred. One that quietly ached within him for unknown years.
---
In just that moment, she had awoken a forbidden hunger in him.
---
He knew, one day. She would take him with that baguette.
---
And as Bluebutt69 now, nearly 6 months later stood, trembling, with his back to her. He knew that day would be today."

I wrote this after joking with a friend about bad fanfics. A convention we go to each year hosts a panel for bad fanfic readings and I was inspired :)
---
Do the quest. Lol
---
You’re all welcome
---
Alch yourself
---
Gem values have crashed and you don't make anything doing iron.
---
Blast mine will net you 500-700k an hour depending level.
---
Corn rows helmet
---
There’s a delay now?
---
&gt; -Tangleroot into the 4 different seasons of the year
---
Use tree roots to change him into the different trees.
---
???
---
It's ok, the crabs won't be restricted
---
No problem being a senor moneysink.
---
Through youtube, Slayermusiq1? I think that's the correct one or could be wrong. Makes questing easy.
---
No karma here
---
Same...you just repeat basically the same pattern over and over. But I still do it for the monies.
---
Ohhhh right... "Efficient Scape"
---
Sorry, I understand that kind of thinking makes sense to you but I can't think of a better way to make a game not fun anymore.
---
Yeah I probably won’t get that far anytime soon (really gotta start practicing farm runs especially) but maybe I’ll aim for stats for some lower level bosses
---
Can you give us an update on Black Graceful?
---
Yeah no not even like that. Nice try though.
---
Too late
---
but 1000 zalcano kills doesn't get you anywhere near 99 mining
---
I guess this would be reasonable since you can already do this by not having dragon slayer completed.
---
Nice, is it worth camping?
---
Have you tried speaking to Oziach?
---
Access to moms Credit Card is a plus
---
It's in the clouds!
---
Bake 'n Stake
---
Lol
---
He sure is outgoing for a shy guy
---
Gonna mine up another 20k buckets of sand for 90 crafting on my Ironman
---
Could be worse... Shewdoh has 6500+ kc with no pet
---
Yeah I definitely think supply is greater than demand because everyone is camping tob still. I'm just saying that the scythe is absolutely not "dead content" outside of tob, it's legit still a top 3 pvm item even discounting tob.
---
It's bad, but it's not that bad. Make teams yourself and just avoid going with people with tier 1 roles if they are under 100 combat, because they are probably there for torso and suck ass at playing. If they have higher than tier 1 I don't typically care what their combat level is.
---
Like I said, I did that diary yesterday and it took about 6 hours. Compared to the 20 hour slog of obtaining full prospector it's really not bad if you have the right teammates. Nearly every bad BA run I had involved some level 50-90 combat pure or main with tier 1 all who was just there for torso.
---
Done that on my uim. Sucks not being able to get Barrows gloves but you can skip rune plate if you get torso. Really helps until you can make antifires
---
Wow. I never believed it would be a reality for Pokémon yet here we are...maybe someday.
---
I'm not going to defend the design of the blowpipe or the trident, but PVM weapons are balanced by operating cost and PVP weapons are balanced by risk.
---
The design of the blowpipe and trident put them at high operating cost and no risk (since ammo is stored internally) so therefore the solutions are to redesign them to be balanced in both pvm and pvp (expensive and time intensive, high player impact, etc) or nerf them in pvp (quick and easy solution)
---
How are you learning? I could teach you if you like 117cb :)
---
Hot milfs in your area need love too
---
when you saddle up in a scion you never know where your gonna end up. this poor mate found himself in the belly of the beast, lets just hope he had full coverage for all those jars. HAHAHAH
---
You have an 11.5% chance of not getting a pet after 4.5k kills
---
All the rich RS mfers get to buy bonds like nothing, while I have to spend my beer money..
---
Good bot
---
This is more of a philosophical question aimed toward the team regarding current and future game design.
---
  
---
Do the devs feel that skills should have a competitive edge on one another for profiting? Or is it seen as a non-issue when equally intensive skills (mining vs. woodcutting) have massive differences in potential profit? (Mining is capable of breaking 1.5m/hr GP with wilderness runite, woodcutting is I believe 200k/hr GP 3-ticking Teaks?)
---
Pay draconic visage to Steve post mm2 and pay slayer points to block
---
Common setup for tribridding at edgeville:
---
Mage: mystics, ancient staff, ancient magicks(obviously)
---
Ranged: rune crossbow, black dhide, diamond bolts, accumulator(or assembler if you have plenty of vorkath heads)
---
Melee: either cheap spec weapon with whip for main OR cheap main weapon(dscim) with ags. Dragon defender switch, torso, and rune legs
---
Shared: Use Zammy book for mage and ranged offhand, climbing boots for all, barrows gloves for all, neitiznot for all, glory for all
---
About 400k-500k risk. Shouldn’t tribrid if not willing to lose some money though. Also should probably practice pking pvmers and skillers first to get switching down. Then fighting real players in LMS, then finally edgeville since a lot of people there are pretty good
---
Upvote because metal drags
---
r/woooosh
---
This is why I love this sub. This is the most I’ve laughed in here. Thanks.
---
Which will always be runecrafting juice because runecraft bad, swamp man good
---
&gt; Not even SotE
---
Is this guy living in the past
---
Vampire slayer quest irl
---
You will not lure me! Begone!
---
People are jealous because they understand that getting drops on an ironman is way more fun and exciting but they cba to start a new account and but all the effort into getting it to the end game when ironman mode really gets cool.
---
I just use the wiki guides. I don’t think it really ruins anything if you still read the dialogue and everything. I only do the quick guides for tiny little quests but still read dialogue because the quests really are enjoyable.
---
Are we having fun yet?
---
Yup kinda unfortunately
---
Lmao, you need to get out a bit more man.
---
A
---
It's easier to get money that gp 😂
---
Are you dense? Thats the point, it makes mains go try to collect the drop themselves........like an ironman.
---
Lmao he's hoping they are gonna shoot up in price still
---
bait
---
RWT is a term for using IRL Money to get GP. The website was for gambling using IRL money and no gp. You could argue that it was a RWT sponsorship since they gave him 1b but that's it.
---
The title said skilling
---
Special mention to Single Tile Outside Lumbridge Church Only Ironman
---
Back at it again
---
Yeah you're going to have to use runelite for that. There's no chance they'd add that to the regular/mobile clients.
---
wow
---
I'm guessing he's talking about using Turael to skip tasks.
---
Having just got 99 hunter off 99 salamander. This is v accur
---
Only had this problem while on runelite, not sure if this is a jagax issue
---
Or they get banned for botting just like everyone else.
---
Not casting aspersions, but whenever i see something like this I just assume they are still in high school or maybe early college without any source of income.
---
Back when I was in high school and literally never had money to spend, I would have preferred to waste 10 hours grinding, too.
---
The ironic truth being a minimum wage job would make the equivalent cash in something like 90 minutes.
---
Regardless, I don’t think anyone with a full-time job would choose to grind rather than pay for membership.
---
don't you have some paladin amber trolling to do? I don't have a vagina and I'm not a streamer so you can't get mad at me cus someone with tits gets more views than you ;\\.
---
Please say your not being serious lol
---
You posted cringe
---
Then I live in a cave, or should I say, rooftops.
---
Fucking. Yes. I'm closing in on my first 99 and would love to keep the cape untrimmed.
---
Ah, dang. What I'm even talking about when I'm nowhere else than rooftops?
---
if even
---
i did that too on my ironman until i got all slayer unlocks i wanted and a z hasta.
---
10/10 would do again
---
used a rockshell plate instead
---
Updates on RL+/Lyzard?  We need clarity on these issues.
---
the most harmful part of RWT are the bot farms/gold farmers using multiple accounts, rather than a player cashing out imo
---
what do you mean? I love paladin amber shes really funny lol especially all those camera angles;p
---
Just say plz no
---
I’m on the same boat man. Where the hell did all that time go.
---
This has to be one of the most well thought out, mindful comments I've ever seen on this subreddit.
---
i prefer the ones we have now
---
People who say pay for it with in game gold. It takes less than an hour to make 11 dollars. I’d rather work less than an hour than spend time doing something I don’t necessarily want to do on osrs.
---
Where do you work where you make 11 bucks in a couple of minutes?
---
doing pvm isnt playing iron man mode
---
man they have like a 100+ memberlist you cant judge all of those because you dislike 5 of them surely
---
He's uploading again by the way, I still love him c:
---
I thought it would be apparent to anyone there that had to get full void set even once.
---
It's not fun, that shit gets engrained in your brain.
---
hey man boypucci aint bad
---
sorry that you try so hard and all it takes is a cute face to be better than you.   
---
life is hard for the 0 hygiene and social skills crowd ;\\
---
Yeah I did gem rocks from 60-70 for SOTE and made like 3m I think and it was relatively casual, way less cancer than iron ores.
---
...how?
---
The people doing tob arent selling their scythes, theyre using them. I think it's a combination of it's high droprate (1/171 per deathless raid) and it's low demand.  Most people doing tob already have scythes, and not as many people are learning it now, so all these extra scythes are making the supply heavily exceed the demand. 
---
The tbow for comparison is much more rare and usable in many more commonly done activities (Both raids, inferno, Zulrah). Scythe is only good at tob, olm hand, slayer bosses and gwd. The latter of the two being rarely done if you have a scythe, mostly just for pets.
---
This is just my theory. I think it will go up if raids 3 is announced at runefest next month. I certainly hope it does.
---
You're pretty unlucky then. I did black salamanders from 67 to 80 and never had anyone even stop by. People usually don't bother with worthless targets.
---
The ones we have now are so half assed?
---
Thank you! I remember looking for something like this a while ago but gave up. This is really useful :)
---
man, first of all please don't act like only 5 of them are notoriously terrible.   
---
Second, if the rest didn't condone the actions of the first, they wouldn't be there. It takes around 25 seconds to make a new CC without the terribleness. They're there because they wanna be there.
---
That's some dedication my friend. There's no way I could play this game for that stretch of time. I always need really long breaks.
---
Yeah we can.  
---
If you choose to be associated with people like Frazer you kind of deserve his reputation.
---
Sorry could you remind me who exactly is playing OSRS release version right now?
---
Dhcb before rigor
---
Waste of dev time
---
Hey there /u/RabbitMario and /u/Onyx_Meda
---
I love this post very much! 
---
I have a tiny suggestion that you may hopefully consider. 
---
I plan to overlay the arches around your existing interface and then trim your draft to fit, I also think a redberry colored highlight on one of the tabs to show that it is actively selected would demostrate some nice interactivity.
---
Are they up to 5M now? I bought mine for like 4.5 a week ago.
---
Hes got a point
---
only major dps difference is on melee hand, and if its just 3 pures trioing a raid we aren't hurting anyone or wasting anyone's time but our own. Don't worry guy nobody is invading your personal space don't cry.
---
Talk about a profitable 1 lvl. Damn son
---
Lol im almost 2500 with 16 picks, 19 2hs and no pet or ring...
---
Neither. Strength amulet if you are free to play, glory if you are p2p (or fury if you have moms card)
---
Oh no all credit to him I just reposted it cause this was a while ago and people have forgotten about it
---
That cape
---
i like that way of censoring the names. 0 effort but very effective and still organised
---
I'd support this if it wasn't just automatically on graceful, like add a new course that has a % chance to spawn an item similar to a mark of grace, and then needing to trade in X number of them to imbue the graceful outfit.
---
I want fast kills and also a small group. Have you actually tried what I describe? Everyone shits on it then tried it and sees it really doesn’t matter that much.
---
This.
---
He’s not wrong lol maybe the way he went about it was
---
Is it just on jad or throughout the whole cave?
---
Didn't get the mutagen or pet though that kinda sucks but nowhere near drop rate yet
---
Was Kemp dropping money off of his iron to rwt? Assume this guy dropped items off his iron to rwt or he was selling inferno capes like someone else said in the thread. No idea though
---
Thanks man!
---
I wouldnt ull burn out on raids faster than pking IMO
---
zalcano and also demand for coal decreased since zalcono provides tons of addy and rune bars.
---
actually it was the rune one
---
Option 4. Complete SotE and do Zalcano with minimal requirements for similar gp/hr.
---
wouldn't 1k points be enough to block every drag task individually?
---
Just buy it on the Grand Exchange.
---
Unless... 😳
---
If you don't plan on serious pking, don't worry about being serious with your combat. If you keep your mage/range high you can do pretty much most stuff.
---
not gonna risk my fire cape boi
---
Entire fightcave
---
Just add more zulrah everywhere, than none of the lvl 3 bots will be around
---
250 KC currently. 14 Torn Scrolls, 1 Arcane, 1 Dex. Pretty burnt out.
---
I dig this, I have fat sausagy fingers and I'm pretty worthless on mobile.
---
This is my fear, I'm only like 500kc but i hate doing Thermo so much, I just wanna get the pet so i can skip it XD
---
Stay a med then bullying pures will always be fun LUL
---
People gonna think we creepy af when we start safespotting
---
what is HLC?
---
Con, no doubt.
---
Old meme
---
Max combat 80 slayer
---
Is there more to it than the 4 penguins hiding in a sheep costume in lumby?
---
There's an ironman that went to 7372 kc for ely, but he got 1 more kc for the b2b attempt and the double meme number
---
That doesnt make it a cosmetic item.
---
If I kill an ancestrals barrager, I get their ancestrals (likely), and thats a lot of risk.  Ancestrals isnt a cosmetic item.
---
There really isnt an argument here, the Trouver parchment is not a cosmetic item.
---
Yeah that was a shiit show too, but I still stuck around, the economy update was last straw for me though, I wasnt as in to PKing at the time, but I felt pretty bad for the pvp players.
---
I can’t imagine it would change things the way they are currently. 
---
Having the option to edit should be similar to just taking an item out to adjust its price/quantity etc
---
Barraging 43s in that gear? 🤔
---
The best osrs content has got to be a friend. Sorry not sorry
---
[deleted]
---
They aren't really a problem anymore since jagex made a different corp cave for irons. Only happens once every 500+ kills now.
---
Id certainly love to! Right now, it can only play 1 part at a time, so I would need to figure out other songs to play on it.
---
This one actually wouldn't be totally useless. It'd make achieving some of the medium diaries a bit easier for ironmen.
---
Rendi’s “lower the better” series is the best RS series of all time. Change my mind
---
They were so proud of their "niche" dragonhunter weapons that every new monster for 2 years were dragons.
---
Make it so that you just want to show Steve the visage you obtained and he yoinks it instead, resulting in you exclaiming "Did you just take my visafe?"
---
I'm doing post control atm and there's a lot of people. Come join us w344
---
You really don't know what a microtransaction is, do you? Go have a good think before whining about bout shit you don't know.
---
but then i couldnt do kbd and brutal blacks, fuck every other dragon though
---
I also believe that most rs players are kids so. Want proof? ask who plays league of legends, most rs players do. which is weird because theres no way a LoL player could have played back in 2006.
---
Forgot there's an instance for corp &gt;.&lt;  lol ty tho
---
I you don't have to tell me - PoE became my obsession for a bit. I got *reeeaaal*  sweaty.
---
I think Trypt clearly had a sesh of listening to Vaporwave before posting this.
---
ye m8 we all rwt???
---
Its very recent. Came with the update that made antifire shield require ds1.
---
I thought grapples were 1 use only until now, I've only ever grappled twice and it broke both times. So I thought grappling was 100x worse than it is (it's still pretty bad tho)
---
Honestly, post 3K has felt shorter than 0-3000. I just sit in discord and joke with buds while I continue to get depressed about my dry streak.
---
Yeah I hate when the shoppong cart omly has 1 good wheel
---
Ooh look at mr moneybags over here with his beer money.
---
Set up a cannon at the spot w/ 3 babies near kava eels in taverly dungeon and melt them away. Task of 125 took me under 30 mins and I'm only 88cmb
---
I think you misunderstood, I'm going to pay for membership until higher levels when moneymaking is quicker
---
And what would you rather do given the choice, spend 20 minutes at work or 1-2 hours at home in front of your pc playing your favorite video game and watching netflix on the side?
---
I thoroughly enjoy gem rocks over MLM. Currently doing 70-75 and have made over 3m just from 70-73.
---
?
---
Not racist if you make the character black. Purple is also acceptable.
---
1k kills of zalcano cost me less then 1m on supplies and allowed me to buy rigour and dhcb before I had even done ds2. Its crazy good and easy to learn. Make sure you try to stay in 4-5 man teams
---
Yea on his phone too i was kinda impressed
---
This sub is as toxic as them. Of course not everyone here is and we can't base a few of them off the whole hlc group.
---
Mum says I can't
---
Wait until you have a lot of in game money and you will see that is not true. Ez money comes from buying BIS gear on a Monday morning and selling it friday night.  Ez profits from the weekend warriors. At that point your bank will progress while you actually play. It's all about that extra income.
---
Time to restart a new account.
---
A     w
---
you can buy gp for 60 cents a mill...
---
How many times have you been pk'd?
---
Hourlies you say?
---
Was not talking about the instance, that one is really not viable for irons because if you leave there either for recharching spec or dieing, the instance would close because nobody's there. This means you'd have to pay the fee again to enter and corp would be on max stats again.  
---
The ironman cave is a non-instance cave any ironman of 90+ combat would go to when they tele to corp or enter the cave. It's a copy of the original cave but mains and sub-90 combat irons can't enter it; they'd end up at the original corp cave instead.
---
It's too convenient. When you have everything with you all the time, you never have to choose what to bring. You could train your attack to 60 to have one more inventory space for woodcutting, but with the tool belt that becomes irrelevant. If you want to mine an ore, you need to have your pickaxe with you as a conscious decision. RS3 has different mechanics, I'm not sure how it fits there, but there is a reason it would never work for OSRS
---
Then change the registered email to another and add a filter. Filter every runescape related message into your junk/auto delete. 
---
It's really the only way to get rid of them, really... Your email will forever be in a list on the internet.
---
Is Indiana like Morytania then?
---
That's right, thanks for the advice! I think I knew this stuff but had forgotten about it, like the clan wars tele
---
Better yet- reward that - dragon slayer, once unlocked allows any dragon to count towards a dragon task. Freedom to choose between the dragons!
---
Shieet that Team Magma/Aqua leader battle music makes me hard
---
1/15 for rare drop table
---
1/128 for dmed on RDT
---
1/1920 for that helm
---
Earning prayer XP at church
---
Hard agree I wanted warding but unless they rework it that ship has sailed( heh heh)
---
It's mostly based on experience, although I'm pretty sure I saw threads with spread sheets back when the farm guild came out showing it numbers wise. I switched from Attas to Iasor after one of those threads and tried to keep track of herbs per run with both Attas, no Attas, and with Iasor by just checking after every ~100 seeds how many herbs I had.
---
I mostly grew lants and torstols getting 99 herblore, I tended to average slightly higher amounts of herbs per trip due to Iasor vs Attas when I tested it using all the herb patches (Including Harmony). Sorry I don't remember the numbers since it's been like 4 months.
---
😂😭😂
---
You could also help, but yeah, very funny because people who buy Bonds are gay
---
LMFAO go home

This is a fucking joke business
---
Wtf am i looking at
---
Amen
---
"Imagine that. Another HLC member banned. What a surprise."
---
When you say it like this you make it sound like HLC players get banned all the time and its full of cheaters.
---
Yall who bash this are just salty you couldnt make something as such. Sick video would love to see others!
---
Call it ‘Anti-DragonScape’
---
Nothing here is 'necessary', and that's frankly irrelevant. What's important is for the rewards to make sense, and in this context I believe they do. Runecrafting is used to infuse golems during the quest and it's a prominent requirement of the quest. Attaching an xp reward seems like an obvious choice.
---
Considering the only way to get BiS melee helm will be through drops from that cave, hard disagree.
---
Draco Malfoy.
---
Let's be real, the bank pin is annoying as fuck. There's still no good reason not to use an authenticator, though.
---
Google dps calculator for osrs. There will be a google spreadsheet file. When you find it make a new copy so you can edit it. Once you can edit plug in your gear and stats and any other things you will be using to train with and then click on the nmz tab near the bottom of the sheet.
---
Inside this tab will contain a list of nmz bosses and their xp rates based off the gear you put in the original tab. Select the 4 or 5 bosses with the highest xp rates and get to grinding!
---
Aren't they? I was getting iron or steel every 3 or 4 tasks so I had to block them
---
No I get that but it’s ironic because they let “integrity” slide for efficiency while berating other methods that go against integrity. (See revs) They pick and chose what is and isn’t okay as long as they agree.
---
Other way around for me but im very fortunate with ingame wealth
---
Literally i have never encountered this issue.
---
I got mine at 65 kc :( I’m so sorry for your suffering.
---
Tbf I only saw this 8 hours after it was posted
---
Plzplzplzplzplz
---
I’m proud of you!
---
See above. Cool suggestion. Op reward especially compared to others.
---
+1
---
Just pk a big item every few months it’s ez
---
&gt;If you defeat them, however, they may drop one of the valuable **Focus stones**, which are wielded in the ammunition slot and increase the potency of magic spells.  
---
I don't support these stones.
---
Same tbh
---
gz beast whats next
---
Reading this on mobile was very confusing at first haha, grats man
---
Jokes on you, they get serp helms and fangs at 4x the rate now!
---
Possibly did the trick to keep it, collected their reward and then did this.
---
Edit: another user pointed out he didnt unlock the victory is mine track so he didnt enter the ring. Damn. What a madlad
---
If you're so prideful that you can't take advice when it's given, maybe you should change your tolerance.
---
Ahhh. OG Runescape humour.
---
Always a treat. :)
---
Jeezus m9 the dedication was real
---
Pls
---
Woox beat Jad 1hp, 1 pray point with no items. You definitely dont need a BP. But 75 range is worth getting anyway and you will get your fc with much less stress
---
If you can a manage to get 1 in the next 400kc you'll be in the same spot as me.
---
Maxing, 2261/2277 total atm. When I had arcane+ely back in December 2016, I decided to not max before getting spectral :P
---
\&gt;What is one-child policy
---
It was a joke because I've never gotten the drop
---
Yeah idk what he’s talking about
---
How about vote no to jagex. It's not pkers who are shoving stupid updates down our throats.
---
Price bottomed out some time between then and now, and has gone up to roughly the same exact price. Guess you did get lucky on ores and gems.
---
(also, everything else you mine could be just as volatile. I just pay attention to coal because of Miscellania.)
---
Nah, pvm. You can try playing LMS. Full pvp.
---
Context?
---
And At that moment he knew. He fucked up.
---
Lmao I saw you and this unit while getting elite last night
---
Took me 700 kc for my first occ.

Maybe *half* of wildy content is pvm. There's a few bosses scattered about, but that doesnt make anywhere near 99% of wildy content pvm

But jokes aside, you cannot tell the people stomping the price. It is THEIR loss for selling it insta-sell price rather than leaving it there for better deal, not yours. So what if they become more common and usual sight among community? If they becomes more and more common and cheaper, I believe their use isn't that great after all on the long run and people doesn't want to invest half of their entire bank value to a single item when they could get nearly BiS gear (excluding Twisted bow) to each other style rather than a single weapon.

Regular old strength pots are like, what, 300 coins? 100 coins to temporarily boost your xp rate by like 10-20% depending. Attack pots literally 5 coins. Why not, you know?

Maybe your account was compromised while you were away and someone botted it, If there’s no way of appealing it I guess you could maybe reach out on here and on twitter for help, but that’s about as far as jagex customer support goes :/

I have terrible melee stats but i got void elite and 99 range with arma cb rigour, can i corp or will jt be bad?

I can earn $11 in maybe 20 minutes after taxes, I can earn 5M in like 2 hours ingame. It's honestly far more efficient to just buy the damn membership, especially when I paid $100 for 12 month membership when I started.

I'd rather the gp I earn ingame just go towards gear upgrades then spending 4 hours a month grinding vorkath or hydra to save a little money.

Looking at the spreadsheet for 10 seconds and it’s evident you don’t know what you’re talking about. Elves and Zygomites as tasks to do? Lmfao.
---
I’ll break down efficient slayer for you because you’re wasting a lot of time if that’s what you do.
---
Do: Smokes, Nechs, Dusts (slaughter all three), bloodveld (slaughter if you have multiple alts for the bloodveld barrage method, otherwise you block them). Trolls, dagannoth, Ankou, steel dragons, baby black dragons, kalphite, suqah, dark beasts are all do with expeditious. Do steel dragons/trolls/ankou in small amounts to maintain points. Same goes for the occasional small black demon task. 
---
Mith dragons are an optional unlock if you’re unlucky and not profiting points, but you shouldn’t need to do them because that list paired with blocking Abyssal Demons, Bloodvelds (replace with Drakes or Wyrms if veld barraging), Kraken, hellhounds, gargoyles, greater demons, and fossil island wyverns with the unlock.
---
Extend Dusts and Nechs, that’s it. Have superiors on. Everything else is a skip.
---
um

sure you did, you egotistical cunt
---
&gt;It was in the past, Imma good boy now!
---
Wow that was a very interesting read.
---
For some reason, your first comment struck me as possibly some /r/iamvery1337 bs so I wanted to verify what was actually going on here. Thank you for the incredibly informative response.
---
I have a few questions if you don't mind answering:
---
First, the first half of your comment is very interesting but I'm having a little trouble understanding what the implications would be to some of these things. Are these mainly vulnerabilities for account security (passwords and pins), game security (DDoS, increasing values of a stack in someone's bank), or individual player cheating like the cheat engine example you gave?
---
&gt;As a security researcher, I'm entirely within my rights to disclose to any party I like - I've exceeded the whole "responsible disclosure" standard of ethics by...three years, minus 30 days.
---
Does this mean that, hypothetically, you're not liable or held responsible at all for the vulnerabilities you have discovered if you were to sell them to someone else? (also, would would you be selling, an algorithm?)
---
For any vulnerability that's in the current state of you having discovered it and offering it to Jagex but them saying no (this would be all of the ones you know I assume), what does each party know about the issue? More specifically, how do you present the information to Jagex, show that it's legit, while also maintaining some aspect of it that they'd need to pay you for? Is it just exposing vulnerabilities, or do you need to provide solutions? Not sure if this makes sense.
---
Sorry for all these questions, feel free to ignore some or all of them.
---
Need a drake meme about this
---
U have to get it repaired if dropped on death
---
That's incredibly disheartening, but I appreciate the information regardless. I don't think I could bring myself to make a new account with how much time I invested into this one.
---
I got my first ring after 3k KC i was hoping to get the pet with no rings haha.. Not all the picks are from Venenatis a handful are from Callisto &amp; Vet'ion.
---
I agree. I personally don't do it. But it's important to be aware of all your options when considering efficiency, the benefits (increased dps while getting bracelet benefits) and downsides (it's aids) so you can make your decision!

I think that would be fine. I would want to steer clear of % magic increase in the ammo slot.
---
Aaah. Makes sense. Gonna say that’s some crazy RNG haha
---
You can go in a team and try snipe some kills with ruby bolts and possibly finishing last hp with tbow, if you have it. But on average, ranged is significantly lower dps than melee. If using ranged, you shouldn't use void because it's inaccurate and ruby specs won't hit better anyway. Armadyl would be best, closely followed by karil.

Are there any plans to improve the QoL revolving around runecrafting pre lvl 77? I know that runecrafting has been meme'd to death but that doesn't mean that we can't improve the skill at all. What are the teams thoughts on adding more expensive teleports to get closer to the runecraft altars to deter the use of runners?
---
P.S. it really doesn't feel right that the best way to train a skill is to use Tears of Guthix

From what I can find, I assume this happens a lot. Looks like my week is ruined.

I really hope I can get at least one Jmod in here, but I don't know the best means of contacting them.

You literally just listed my entire spreadsheet, with the only difference being that I have Elves on Do to make up for blocking bloodvelds for people without all

elves are a shit task, but ever since drakes/wyrms got added to duradel you need to do elves to make up the points, check the math on the spreadsheet

None of the high level olympus member want/accept alts as a part of the ironman game mode. They have been very vocal about wanting tgem removed instantly. But as the gamemode currently stands they're almost required to stay competetive.

Yeah I ain't doin that.

Add Tears of Bandos for pures

boaty once sold firecapes as well.

It wasn’t meant as anything negative, not sure why people are putting a stigma on it. Yours and most of us here ability to “hyperfocus” on RuneScape tasks to this degree goes hand in hand with ADHD and a good deal of ADHD cases are found alongside ASD cases as well.

My son is on the spectrum and he’s quite brilliant and reads about 6 grades ahead of his class in grade 3.

That being said, I love that you came here to comment, and despite my saying you might be on the spectrum (which again, I assure you, had no negative connotation whatsoever).
---
Voted for you for the gnomes and even though swampy boi is an incredible watch, I look forward to your uploads more than anyone else. And even more so the patches that follow your videos to fix the things you find.
---
Why? Dragons are easy and an easy source of income.
---
Zamorak = Chaos, his tears will be the best xp but it’ll randomly be distributed
---
Sardomin = Order, his tears are the worst xp but you can choose where they go
---
Guthix = Balance, his tears are the middlest xp and go to your lowest skill.
---
Well you can download it in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh so not true
---
Too bad you have to get a 2nd sigil to make it look better in the bank next to the others ;).
---
Should be a tampon instead of visage
---
I have never played a pure so I couldn’t really tell you, but as far as I know I think that’s common or at least not that uncommon. He made his account pretty soon after OSRS came out so maybe metas have changed but I honestly don’t really know much about account progression for pures. I do know that he’s done some KBD kills so that wouldn’t be possible without it.
---
Meh, maybe im old school, but in my opinion, its no different from buying gold from a 3rd party. Your essentially cheating the game with no repercussions.
---
He did indeed give me the 50m. Another friend chipped in 3m too
---
‘Casual BA’ does runs but they require you to have level 5 in at least two roles to play with them, which is pointless if you’re only going for the torso.
---
They so clearly do.  
---
They were jerking themselves off when Hyger alt'ed his way to 200M Slayer.
---
They set their sights on one thing like the Zeah library but they still abuse all the other stuff that is in the game, and celebrate like they've done something.
---
Remove the r from revolution and I'm sold.

Shut up and take my money
---
There was actually nearly a month in-between those sigils. Stopped corping soon after getting arcane because I wanted to get better gear before coming back (like armadyl chestplate). When I got tyrannical ring I wanted to test it for 1 kill before continuing upgrading my gear. That one kill gave the ely.

Why is “Access to Menaphos” not listed on the rewards screen?
---
The first part of your statement is not true, and selling fire capes isn’t cheating. Yeah it’s against the rules, and kinda lame, but is not cheating
---
What was your set up? I’ve tried multiple times at 80 mage and it hasn’t worked out
---
you dick
---
Torture is a better first upgrade as I've been corrected with. But yes they're a better upgrade than tassets. Not sure if better than ferocious gloves.
---
Also, taking you up on the AMA, do you have a backlogged list of tasks to complete for Lower the Better or do you play it close to the chest?
---
Would love to know if you have months upon months of content already possible and simply just pick what seems most fun or impactful that week.
---
Prayer books are common for pures. Zammy book has attack bonus and great pray bonus. No use in antidrag shield.
---
No, I don’t think I will.
---
Currently, you can click (or right-click) the in-game compass to "Look North."
---
Would it be possible to add options for looking East, South, and West?
---
Exp rewards are waaaay too high. This is the start to the slope of quests giving out over 1m in exp lamps like we have on RS3.
---
I'm also really enjoying Chocobo as well. Production value is great on his videos, love the art style he adds etc.
---
Overall, great time for osrs content with some of these very talented people.
---
If I were to speculate, what brings bonds into the game is wanting GP. Since the third party markets for gold are so cheap, people aren't buying bonds right now, thus driving up their value.
---
This is truly epic

How many times did you get tagged by lunatic Levi? I believe he changed his name to silencelevi and then something else. Dude is something else. Just rags Corp 24/7 lol

Trick question. I have to spend 8 hours of work each day and only have 1-2 hours of down time to play runescape. I'd rather enjoy that 1-2 hours.
---
what's wrong with the minigame? I have some small changes in mind but overall this minigame has renewed my interest in osrs completely
---
Did they ever make it so you can block metal drags with one block slot? I remember them talking about that, but don’t know if it was done
---
Is the Ibarn's staff worth getting? Or should I just level magic to 57(?) To use fire bolt
---
True, but only if they're in that deep. Any deeper than 35 and I always bring ice barrage. The 7.4 second freeze was just too short to make it even worth using against anyone fighting back imo. Only made it worth using against  players just running away and if you're dpsing them with rcb they didn't protect mage anyways.
---
Thanks man. I know it was all in good heart,  I have heard similar comments in the past though so I thought I might be straightforward here and address my style of video for those who probably haven't even given them a shot. I assume many just listen to the first 30 seconds of commentary and don't even hit the first build for a joke, therefore it would make sense as being stale in their mind. It just sometimes blows over peoples' heads who aren't so familiar with it, because no one else really in the rs community uses this commentary style. I wouldn't have revolved commentary around this if it was an amped up progress series like others where I can hold myself to extreme reactions based on something that happens to my stats, gains, collections etc. So that is why I am trying to go a whole different route with this series, even the commentary. On the AMA aspect yeah I have some thought out ideas for maby future episodes. More of these ideas though are seeming more difficult to reach the further I get into the series, the more things I get patched, and the 2 week time constraint per video. I could see this concluding around maybe 40 episodes before picking up on something else major. And maybe the last episode I would dedicate months to as a series finale since the 2 week time constraint is really pushing me backwards. Right now all of my episodes have over 90 hours of production time from start to finish. Most probably average 120. That's my major downfall probably is now the high expectations I put into each episode.

Dafuq black dragon tasks are only like 20 max share pls
---
Disagree because mining has loads of different methods and levels of intensity whereas rc has 1 gameplay loop that is barely altered. 
---
I like rc more than mining, but I think mining is better as a skill overall due to the variety of training methods and difficulties/attention.
---
u/yehbabe
---
I mean, I'm definitely not, but okay. Also, I said I used fire wave, not slayer Dart.....
---
doing it with randoms really wasn't that bad in my experience. I got lvl 5 in all roles for the diary with randoms and only had someone abandon before wave 10 3-4 times, usually it was on an early wave as well
---
I like one chunk man more
---
&gt;I'm having a little trouble understanding what the implications would be to some of these things
---
It varies by methodology. I employ a variety of different techniques; ranging from decompilation and manual inspection inspection of the java gamepack, as well as the various components of the official Jagex launcher, for sniffing out issues with client implementation. I do have a penchant for network-level stuff, which tends to tie into web-based vulnerabilities much of the time. MITM I have a sweet spot for, as devs *frequently* leave the relevant channels less secure than they should be.
---
&gt;account security (passwords and pins),
---
I'll say flat-out that I can't magically steal your password just by wanting to. As with most things, there is some level of social engineering/planning that goes into using some of these, but they're generally not the sort of thing that would jump out at out you. Specifics are difficult to speak to, without giving too much away.
---
&gt;game security (DDoS, 
---
DDOS (at least for packet flooding) is not really an exploit or vuln, per-se. In-fact, many people consider it the virtual equivalent to *protesting*, given the mechanics. It's more of public discourse than an actual exploit - hack is totally not the right word, despite some people referring to it a such. I suppose DOS (denial of service) is a bit more practical - you could probably pull off some manner of low-resource attack on the login service, given that you'd basically be forcing the server to do lots of expensive operations on BigIntegers, for the initial login request (they modPow/whatever the hardcoded RSA modulus/exponents to do cheap &amp; easy encryption on it, but this only works for the login attempt).
---
&gt;increasing values of a stack in someone's bank
---
This isn't really possible, most people who know of Cheat Engine will tell you that; it's just your standard memory editor. It's more of an issue of us really having no avenue to affect that data. You'd be quite hard-pressed to find a functional exploit that allows that sort of thing - though bugs in game logic tend to be more effective in this respect.
---
**Rule of thumb about Client-Server differences:**
---
- The client is there to show you what the game server tells you is happening, and to tell the server what you're trying to do.
---
- The server is there to tell you what's happening in the game, and to decide whether the client is allowed to do the things you tell it you want to do.
---
&gt;or individual player cheating like the cheat engine example you gave?
---
Far and away, I have more of these than anything else - I don't even have a proper count, it's just incidental knowledge that's easily exploitable. If I had to guess, easily dozens exist atm. I'm unaware of any toolkits written specifically to utilize these, but I suspect it's either due to artificial scarcity, or just plain old obscurity. A lot of it is stuff you'd never even consider.
---
&gt;Does this mean that, hypothetically, you're not liable or held responsible at all for the vulnerabilities you have discovered if you were to sell them to someone else? (also, would would you be selling, an algorithm?)
---
It varies, but as long as I'm not *intending* to act in bad faith (like selling to parties whose ill intent I may suspect - which could fall under certain RICO statues), I'm generally covered. At least, that's my understanding of the laws of my own country. Either way, I generally try to do the ethical thing - otherwise I'd have cashed out years ago and wouldn't dare speak of the issue in the first place.
---
&gt;For any vulnerability that's in the current state of you having discovered it and offering it to Jagex but them saying no (this would be all of the ones you know I assume), what does each party know about the issue?
---
Well, the last time they really gave me the time of day was when I DMed Mod Lyon a few years back. Most of their employees don't even have DMs enabled, and if they do, they generally ignore me. I don't expect much else, but at least I can say that I tried to instigate change.
---
&gt;More specifically, how do you present the information to Jagex, show that it's legit, while also maintaining some aspect of it that they'd need to pay you for?
---
I can't, realistically. That's the reason it's so vital for them to support the practice of bug bounties, and to establish trust and good faith with the security community. The only way you can really prove it are by USING IT to affect their systems (illegal pretty much everywhere), or by giving them some proof of concept - which exposes the vulnerability, thus negating their need to pay the researcher. 
---
This is why it's so important for them to establish a bug bounty program, or at least begin cooperating with large zero day vendors like Zero Day Initiative, Zerodium, Hackerone, etc. As long as they refuse to do so, few ethical researchers will consider it worthwhile to investigate - even if they did, they're unlikely to ever be compensated for their time. It's already quite a burden to get vendors to pay out, nobody really feels like arguing with a company as rigid and, frankly disdainful of their own fallibility, as Jagex.
---
&gt;Is it just exposing vulnerabilities, or do you need to provide solutions? Not sure if this makes sense.
---
Industry standard is that we just sell the information, as we're not really covered/trusted to touch their code. I doubt they trust me with fixing their proprietary systems just because I know how to break them. Additionally, most companies won't let you touch their IP without some form of NDA.
---
&gt;Sorry for all these questions, feel free to ignore some or all of them.
---
No worries, it's nice to see someone genuinely interested; usually you get downvoted and ridiculed in this subreddit when you try to speak to particularly obscure facts.

# Closing thoughts
---
**Sidebar on the efficacy of Cheat Engine as a tool for abuse**
---
*Cheat engine has a bit of a bad rap as a fake hack tool, but it's just one of many memory editors.* The thing to remember is that it only affects what the client on *your* computer is thinking. Just because your client thinks you have a million billion gold, doesn't mean it's true. But if you try to change something that *only* the client knows - like whether you're aiming a spell or have an inventory item highlighted, all that matters is what *your* client thinks. Ergo; these particular gameplay mechanics are unenforceable. Yes, most game developers add in various roadblocks and such, but it's always an arms-race, and with the OSRS client being mostly reversed by the client, private server, and botting communities; it's much harder to hide these sort of tripwires.
---
Interestingly enough, Cheat Engine can actually be *very* powerful. Even with Java based games like Runescape. Most people don't know this, but DarkByte actually wrote a very useful library for it that enables Live JVM debugging, which makes it far easier for the program to debug the OSRS client's memory. If you're really dedicated, you can pull off some pretty neat stuff when you pair it with with the LUA scripting functionality from the base program.
---
**Sidebar on third party clients and whether banning them *actually* prevents the OP methods people take issue with:**
---
Honestly, you could probably replace most third-party client plugins with something built on this tech and make it largely update proof. This one of the things that makes me consider the third-party client rage to be a bit funny - many of the things people whine about are things I figured out how to do with my friends when I was a dickhead 15 year old skid. From a purely functional level, anyways - it was more "hacky" and unpolished by far.
---
With so many different methodologies employed in messing with the game client, these particular sort of vulnerabilities are really only possible to address by defining clear server-side limitations based on what we know the client is capable of knowing/doing. This I've heard referred to as an "authoritative server" model, historically the server being skeptical of the client is why Runescape has been fairly difficult to find genuine gamebreaking exploits. It's not like Minecraft, where you can basically just start flying *because yolo*.
