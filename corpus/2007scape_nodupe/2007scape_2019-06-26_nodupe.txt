Lmao woah. Someones triggered. I was simply making a point. I still don‚Äôt see yours tho? Too busy pounding your keyboard little guy?

If you weren't active with over 2b at the time you weren't a victim of the mod.
---
nah it would be a pin that u can set in game just like the bank pin
---
Just go to a skill total world lol. Rarely any in the 2k worlds
---
Well that escalated.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter it would be handled by third party therefore not their liability. No company outside of the financial industry does there own ID verification lmao. This ain‚Äôt 2007 no more.
---
You mean the guides on the wiki here: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows/Strategies you know, the ones I USE. I‚Äôm really sorry, but this isn‚Äôt something you can invalidate. I lost money, fact. You cannot change that even if given a literal infinite amount of time.  I‚Äôm just unlucky and that‚Äôs that.
---
The accounts Jed hacked had their wealth returned. Either way your stolen wealth will not be returned as customer support is not within Jagex's abilities.
---
I voted yes for this skip because I did underground pass roughly 5 months ago. I want to do regicide this weekend so I will have to re-discover the grid, just seems dumb if I already did the quest.

Tbf someone said they‚Äôve provided IP addresses before which is really good on their part but obviously has the potential to be abused by people wanting to access accounts for GP.

I think this is legit though you clearly care enough to make sure his guys alright.

Hope he sees that someone‚Äôs asking if he‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm sure that would be nice.
---
They invited a God to jagex...
---
Nah I dont believe you. No way you lost money from 100 barrows runs how is that even possible. At most you're sipping 2 doses of prayer pot and eating 5 sharks. I sip 1 prayer pot and eat maybe 2-4 sharks each run. That's less than 5k right there so you'd have to get 3k barrows chests 100 times in a row to lose money. Ur full of shit.

You mean ultra stretching, looks terrible tbh.

Sell the account and complain about it getting hacked

I think mod ash brought this up on a Q&amp;A, he was in favor of improving it more but it would require engine work

True but it would be nice not seeing their spam in every world.

Ive sadly had to craft runes for diaries and also leveled rc up just a little when i was testing the abyss

Find out what? As stated before, trading in-game names is not against the rules, but not endorsed by jagex. So if you do it, you wont face any consequences, but if you get scammed doing it then jagex doesn't give a fuck.
---
This is so cool. I know exact where this is (ge right? Looking east?) 
---
Great vibes man. Good style.
---
Okay, thanks for the details.

Okay, thanks I likely wasn't a victim then since it was around 450m at the time.

Make it an stl now :)

I think a month is a fair wait tbh, you can never be too careful!

I would be quite worried if there were bots at the ge of a 2k skill total world

At least they don‚Äôt try and scam

Someone get swampcomments and swampcommentletics in here pronto

That fucking spec..üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Well, on rs3, there is on on uncharted islands, so they possibly could. How much spaghetti cooking they would have to do to make it though....

I only use Konar every 10th task.

Aren‚Äôt they still like 37m?

Pretty sure I got like 200 mind runes only with mory hard and 88%
---
I just finished grinding both. Woodcutting is faster than fishing by far.
---
And you don't know how lightsources or x-logging works?

Because you're a human afking. A bot is never afk. Hostile random events have never done anything to deter bots

He probably killed himself, you did not do enough to intervene and save his life

Dragonfire ward was down to 26m and just recovered to 30m

That's what I said.

Dumbest post I've seen in a while, so many things wrong I cba to get into it.

Why do people change the chat color, just like the names here bro wtf how can you read this

Now you work on pet farming or filling out the collection log, or if you are a true masochist then going for 200m in skills.
---
Pik = penis in Dutch
---
Nor has Jagex. They still run rampant and will continue to. Throw out number 2, I dont care. all i want is give the non bots a fair chance at grinding imps rather than having 6 people per world in puro-puro like it is right now.

I think I‚Äôm too happy. What‚Äôs the opposite of dopamine?

Im a simple man, I see a pride flag, I downvote

That's why you get your diary done to not need the staff anymore

Ok just assuming this post isn't a joke, for the sake of argument. I'd actually recommend against YouTube guides. The "quick guides" on the wiki are pretty damn good and concise and, for me at least, take way less time than videos.
---
I have very similar stats and the same gear as you. I was comfortably getting two kill trips yesterday with average mid 2min kill times. Today I decided to chin 90 range before going back for the rest of the task.
---
Lol jk man but why you killing so many chickens
---
How long per night? Also just wondering, how is mlm on mobile?
---
Players who genuinely care about their security would see little to no benefit from an auth delay, as they would have their emails properly secured and not constantly leak their details for recovery ability (which is addressed here). All in all the delay is the last thing that would occur in security, to get to that, you're pretty much entirely compromised. And how are you going to be alerted to an auth delay if they take access to your email away from you..
---
In your settings where you can change F Keys there is also a little checkoff to have the escape button close interfaces.
---
If on mobile then i got nothing else for you though sorry.
---
I think it's up to 200 now.
---
Emily only faked depression once !!!!!!!

Can someone explain why this guy is a meme :/ haha

Okay, let's define scam then. If you agree to a split and one person runs off with it, you got lied to. Not scammed. Kick him from the party and move on.
---
There are no good ways of making money on f2p.
---
Your 'best' options will be telegrabbing wines, or killing ogresses and alching the drops. Total lvl worlds most likely have far less competition for these spots so you could go for it if you don't plan on getting membership.

I remember there being a bug with boss banks where if you get attacked by a player then go to the boss and die its counted as the PKers items not yours so they are not collected. i don't know if it was fixed.

I enjoyee rs the most then too.... i finally was high level and managed ti fet ovl, turm, yak and choatics.
---
Can someone explain what‚Äôs happening here please?
---
Ow
---
The OSRS community is too difficult to please. The overall majority of players are apathetic to changes made and don't involve themselves in these discussions. The majority of players that are involved in the decision making aspect of polls and community discussions do not want any changes that 'devalue' their own accomplishments regardless if they're better for the game. The honest truth is most skills in OS are absolutely horrendous to train and add little to no content aside from the grind itself. Everyone knows this and noone knows it better than the veteran players that constantly stifle polls that could improve the content. But it's a catch 22. The voting base doesn't want content that's too exciting or ground breaking because it will devalue their boring and expensive double lava rune grind, but if the content isn't exciting it will not pass a poll. Jagex's solution to this problem is Warding which from what I've gathered will just now be a buyable skill that fills a void that nobody cares about in the first place, that being mage armor was never craftable. In my opinion Runecrafting should be Warding. But again, it will not be approved by most veteran players. A skill I thought should have been added was Artisan. It would have improved the content of many redundant and boring skills, but again, it was too groundbreaking for most veteran players.
---
nice work man you got a unique style
---
Its actually crazy how much endgame there is. I just hit 100 cmb and there is still so much I can't/haven't done. Even with my quest cape the game just has so much to offer.
---
Invalid credentials
---
Yeah I have no idea what they think an "active player" is lol
---
Gz demon money
---
Eh I keep mine just to collect. Plus it‚Äôs good if u want to cheap out on cost
---
They have something pretty similar in rs3 with player owned farms
---
Even as an ironmanbtw who has to charge ibans staff somewhat frequently, you just go through the back from lletya  and it‚Äôs so much easier.
---
That's MoparScape and it's a feature
---
Isn't that a HHKB?
---
Wondering this as well. Plus I am curious if OP is bullshark bob on twitch.

Is that still around??? I loved moparscape haha
---
you've really capture the really intensely sleepy type of blue that the morning is. great job.
---
Thanks my dude means a lot!
---
Support, this is a long needed update and we have to get this on jagex‚Äôs front door asap. I would like to suggest having to click various parts of the screen so they know you arent AFK. Too many times people have tricked me into giving them my password, this will combat it! LONG LIVE OSRS
---
I generally play my games in spanish
---
Yeah but also, my rng is terrible. Not sure why I play RNG based games lol. 700 kc at Zulrah only loot I've gotten is 2 crystal seeds. 600 med clues later, no rangers, 200 sire kc, no unsired. So  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Yea I remember the days, but bots can have randoms written into their code, it would be no different than literally anything else in the game. As the other guy said, it only stops people from afking.
---
If you want fast exp I would do teaks or yews. Redwoods are pretty great at 90. Infernal axe helps as well.
---
Add a juul to the list
---
But proper 2FA, that you can't just remove via the website, makes the entire bank pin system redundant. If my account is secure, I don't really need to secure my bank because I'm not scared of losing anything. In fact this is less secure because 2FA is a random number each time
---
Depends, I know some singles in your area who are into some real kinky stuff...
---
You're best RuneScape friend is actually a bot. All those times you shared together and the jokes you told, those were all a script.
---
Now you can play the game
---
Yeah I do it during hunter / agility / mining etc + it is low cost and profits atleast 2gp per 1 made
---
They proposed alternatives and those failed too.
---
It doesn't have to be
---
Report the people who use the bots for what? And how can I see/prove that they actually did use the rng bot?
---
I tried a couple times, couldn‚Äôt quite get it. Bought the task, which gives you the choice to try Jad every time, and got it my first time with a slayer helm (i). The boost from the helm is very noticeable.
---
Even better, if you try Jad and die, the task is still complete I believe.
---
I would absolutely recommend doing it on task when learning, but maybe give it a try or two off task first to get the mechanics down
---
Dude that scared the shit out of me that maul oof
---
Why don't you take abyss to death altar and take shortcut
---
I think you need to stop believing the arm-chair security experts on reddit. Jagex is a reputable company bound by multiple legal standards, there is no way they're storing this shit so haphazardly. They've stated multiple times they don't use plain text passwords as they would not be in compliance with laws if they did. Remember it's Jagex and not same random private server.
---
1. Whenever you get a TzHaar task, you can choose to kill either normal TzHaar monsters or Jad.
---
2. It only applies to Zuk.
---
3. The task ends when you kill Jad or exit the cave (whether you leave through the gate or die).
---
4. Yes.
---
I ignore every beggar at the GE and only help people actually playing the game
---
I think if it makes sense in the story of the quest, its not bad game design.
---
Runescape quests are story driven. If the story is 'you have to go through underground pass again' then its fine.
---
Now it‚Äôs time to play the game
---
Because that is removing part of the quest.
---
Nicely made the dart ball throw thing legit
---
1: Always offered
---
2: Doesn't apply to Jad, can get task with 0kc
---
3: If you die in the caves, you fail task so you can get a new one.
---
4: Yes, boost for all monsters
---
I legit hate when people run around calling people and things toxic. Usually they have a huge stick up their ass and are just as toxic
---
well at 71 RC i get around 10k experience per TOG. since you can do TOG once a week at most. It's going to take me 8 weeks or 2 months to get 72 from 71.
---
damn dude congrats, thats awesome.
---
1. Slayer tasks are assigned randomly but I've gotten most of my Jad tasks from Nieve/Steve. Sometimes I've gotten 2 Jad tasks in 1 day, so.
---
2. If it doesn't specifically say you have to defeat Jad before I'm gonna say no, you can get him assigned as task because with hot stuff you can also get regular Tzhaar, but are offered to switch to Jad/Zuk.
---
3. You can walk in and immediately walk out to cancel the task, if you die during the task in the fight caves the task is also cancelled.
---
4. I believe so? I get slayer exp from everything else in the fight caves so I assume they count as well. Would be a waste of an equipment slot otherwise.
---
As scummy and disgusting as she is doesn't she actually play the game somewhat decently?
---
1. Unless there's that 1 kc restriction, 100% of the time you get a tzhaar task you are offered the jad task.
---
2. You might need 1 jad kc before you can get jad tasks, I'm not 100% sure though since it was added years ago, but thats how inferno tasks work.
---
3. If you die or leave the fight caves for any reason after accepting a jad task, even if on wave 1, it ends the task and its functionally equivalent to skipping the task for free. You don't lose your streak, you dont have to kill anything else, you just go get a new task from the slayer master.
---
4. You have the boost for all monsters in the cave not just jad
---
Supply meets demand, stop using gambling bots = interest dies = botters move on to something else.

I am gonna tribrid actually. And theres PLENTY of 1 def pures w/ smite from what ive seen, so i dont really know what youre talking about, its definitely not uncommon.

Oh my god *thats* why I do that?

The reason I made the guide is mostly for budget geared people. My bank is worth around 100m so a dhl would be a big chunk of my bank. Maybe when I get a claw drop I‚Äôll try it thanks for the info
---
Switch to diamond bolts (e). 
---
Dragon crossbow is only a +4 accuracy bonus over a rune crossbow, there are probably other pieces of gear you can buy that will make a bigger difference, like a buckler or odium ward.

Care to share a screenshot of your kill death ratio? Lol

I don't think she ever said she was the largest OSRS streamer. 
---
Multiple times, she has asked whoever is doing the viewbotting to stop. 
---
How exactly would a streamer prevent someone else from viewbotting their channel? I am not aware of any tools that Twitch offers to prevent fake accounts from joining a chat room.
---
Cue the phonograph and the evil laughter!!
---
I had help from a clan member who is a math-wiz: 
---
So getting a Fremennik kilt from an elite clue is 1/12,499. You get between 4-6 rolls per elite casket. So on average, the chance of getting 3 kilts in 48 clues should be roughly 1 in 1 million? Wow.
---
Thanks!
---
Fuck his ass with a pitchfork
---
Fixed mode gang
---
cool, gonna make some pins and put them on my spreadshirt later

doesnt even take that. Im absolute booty at this game and got a zulra kill in about 10 attempts

Hey, let's not pop shots at Taiwan now. This guy is just a cunt.

I would say someone send to Ash, but I am taking the lack of a jmod response as disapproval lol

I would prefer Jagex to work on fixing things that are actually broken, instead of making minor timesaving tweaks that will impact people very rarely.

Come join 'RS Event'
---
The viewbot nuke went off and she had 12-15 viewers
---
Phenomenal idea, but add a system that helps rank based on dupes too. Like from the completionist series on YouTube he has gotten several dupes. Make like rare items worth a certain number of points and more common items worth like 1 but each new unique is worth more points than a duped item.
---
My 2 cents -
---
It depends on what the individuals liked about the game experience.
---
In the 2005-2007 period, players were looking for the experience to play with one another, communicate in search of trade, the experience was gearing towards active search by individuals. No Grand Exchange, BIS gear then was not exactly defined (Barrows vs Dchain), there were room for improvement. The internet then was not so much of social media, remember. The experience of the new things as a kid, is magical experience if you liked the game. (Minigames were content some people did for FUN)
---
If you compare the period to now, whereby expectations of the players are much higher (Efficientscape, BIS gear, content doing purely for a "MAX" cape), and where game information is more widely available.
---
Of course content now is way better, over 10 years down the road, with a live example of RS3 as reference for what players want and don't want. 
---
But, at the end of the day, ask yourself, what are you looking for, is it the same as the past or not? Else, are you comparing apples to oranges.
---
It depends on what you define as FUN.
---
Absolutely, trident is much better. The trident of the swamp is even better and definitely worth getting. Also you shouldnt be using void
---
Gz man that's awesome
---
Yeah it's not important - but just saying when I think of Golden Age for games I think of when they were at their peak. Like Golden Age of WoW was WOTLK. There's still a lot of players, but it's not like it was before when everyone and their cousin played
---
One of the most wonderful things about this game is it feels unbeatable. There's always more to do and plus, the goal of 4.6b xp is infinite. The magic of the game is probably shattered when you hit that infinity and everything else just feels petty.
---
:)
---
Some people won't get the joke, but I do.
---
Will be good for zmi I‚Äôm guessing can probably click on the alter from the bank.
---
Agreed, 2005 (and 2006) was the prime of runescape.
---

It was just once.

imagine thinking that pkers calling people 200 different slurs as they smite them for their spade is toxic. pft snowflakes all of them. Like how sensitive do you have to be to not like being called the n-word?

Hi! I‚Äôm starting to train combat at nmz and I just need some calcifications. I‚Äôm 70/70/70 right now and I‚Äôm hear full obby is the way to go til 92 hp for DH. But what point is max str gear like bandos and whip better then full obby?
---
Trade timer is a good band aid for now. Plus an account owner shouldnt really care given they were brainlets.
---
You dirty clam.
---
not the most popular but def one of the most creative/thoughtful content creators. if pking content is a blockbuster action flick, swampletics is like a kubrick film. where jack nicholson completes 17,000 temple treks to get the requisite stats to kill abby demons.
---
It's so sad looking at them on the ignore list, with all their normal former names. Some of them are higher leveled and you know lots of people lost their mains and everything to these.
---
What were the 5 longest 99‚Äôs and the 5 shortest 99‚Äôs to get?
---
The only thing I‚Äôd suggest is selling anguish and buying a fury for both range and mage. Freeing up some money for other upgrades. I think that void would still be a good idea and also work on getting DS2 done. If anything I‚Äôd get that done.

A tldr version for it.

-Armour for shayzien faction in zeah. 
---
-You first need 100% favour in the faction to obtain it. 
---
-You can go to the center of the shayzien area and fight the mobs. You get one tier for mob killed. 
---
-The effect. When fighting lizard shamans, the green blob they shoot out, you won't get damaged from it. So more afk. 
---
-IMO very worth to combine with slayer helmet because you get the bonus too- if imbued. 
---
But you need kebos diary.
---
EVERYONE STAY CALM

I'm honestly embarrassed for you, how can you post a pic without bgloves, assembler, or fcape and try to flex. On that note, those are my suggestions, play the game and get untradeables and put the credit card away.

She also quotes, "We invite people who we have a better relationship with," and goes on to point out that jagex has never attempted to form a relationship with her, albeit mod mat k, who has now left the company, that would further encourage her to play runescape more and invest into jagex more.

I've also previously tried (https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/205980401-Forgotten-registered-email) but it redirects to a password reset url and doesn't indicate anything after giving a username.
---
Now you wait for Warding
---
You get it from an arena in shyzen bit in Kourend, you need to kill guys to get pieces of armour starting at 1 through to rank 5. The armour is for fighting Lizardmen shamans, if you don‚Äôt wear it fighting them your basically dead. When you complete Kourend hard diary you can use slayer helm instead of the shyzen armour helm.
---
People might be selling gear because of summer, and because none of the content in priff seem to require gear. Dinhs bulwark seem to be skyrocketing though?
---
But where would these people live? Npc's have referred to there being people that live in the wilderness but there's really only the dark warriors fortress and the bandit camp as any real sort of settlement.
---
So well done! Most enjoyable short video I've seen in a long time!
---
oof ouch my engine
---
Why dont we have a 1 time password Keychain like many other games so its much more difficult to get hacked unless someone physically has your keychain linked to your account, it would cut down on the hackers drastically . and jagex could sell them for a small fee shipped to your house. Which many fellow OSRS players would be glad to pay for the piece of mind that their accounts are safe.
---
I've literally explained to people in game telling them not to use them and then they say they won 50k so it's okay or whatever. Ppl just keep chucking their gp to them even knowing they aren't legit.
---
I think this is 100% true in a pure gameplay sense. We like to complain about dumb decisions the OSRS team has made but RS in 2005-07 was nowhere near as carefully designed (or at least it didn't really feel like it)
---
All day baby
---
No.
---
its a 0$ tourni no one gets paid remember. unless they are in someones back pocket
---
If I do format it with shazien can I still join it with a trim from
---
Slayer master?
---
Should have put a pmod crown on it.
---
I guess that means the new quest is in morytania
---
Shit, it's the last one? Thank god.
---
I love his enthusiasm and how he together with other players dig in to the game content. Like when he finds items not mentioned on any drop tables(silver bars for instance), how he conquered the bog, the intricacies of temple trekking and other oddities like the random event triggers.
---
her nudes sucked
---
yes lol
---
Yeh no it will not haha. That would be an immediate knock back. Account creation date is more useful than a currently unused CC
---
Nice, ty for reply
---
poll this
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
There is no in game rolling system. Whatever odds they give the bots are entirely up to the botter. They could have them rigged to do some amount over 50% for wins or have a more complex bot to base the wins off of the gp amount people are giving them. You have absolutely no way of knowing what your odds are in the game.
---
Yeah...I kinda wish theyd do more to encourage people to group up to do bosses before raids. A thought I had was that everyone wants imbues as soon as possible for training, so removing imbues from NMZ and giving bosses all around RuneScape a 100% chance at dropping an item that would imbue a specific item on the list would be pretty awesome. 
---
Nobody is going to form a duo/trio of randoms from the GE to kill DKs at 60-70 combat right now, but they might if that was the only way to imbue their slayer helm or their berserker ring.
---
Id love to be taught and trained by you lol
---
im not an osrs meme connoisseur, but its gonna be hard to top this
---
when can we expect the Arceuus Spellbook teleports implemented into the Portal Nexus?
---
That's true, pkers gotta eat too
---
You should try Ironman!
---
TBH the pose of the closest dark wizard would work naked. I can't do 10% as well as OP but I can do an MS paint NSFW if you're desperate.
---
I mean what other games even have a point of hacking someone‚Äôs account. And the few there are, you get your shit refunded if you‚Äôre hacked. If jagex refuses refunds then it‚Äôs common sense that we need extra security
---
Nudes, you say? Could you maybe share a link? For scientific purposes only, of course.
---
Dmm
---
Size doesn‚Äôt matter (in rs password you literally can‚Äôt capitalize characters in your own password)
---
See the real problem is that there are horses.
---
What a rude thing to say to some one on their birthday. Im not sure who hurt you, but can‚Äôt you just say gz like everyone else or just nothing at all?
---
Lol you sound like Hillary bitching about cartoon frogs
---
She only did it once tho
---
haha, funny enough I'm one of those people that lost an OTP recovery code, but yeah.  I still agree it's generally more secure than just about anything else.
---
I couldn‚Äôt even afford a tormented bracelet before this lol
---
It's SO much fun, imo. Without raids I probably wouldn't still be playing the game.  
---
Having a clan and group of friends you can raid consistently with is key. Finding random groups is where the relentless headaches come.
---
Finally I've found you, I'd like my rune helm back please...*trimmed*
---
Faster xp tho
---
Hey, you could also pickpocket the good folks of Lumbridge! Quicker but seems less ethical tho
---
Yes they do? They also usually require the code to disable. 
---
CSGO for example gives a 14 day trade ban, which is essentially a delay, as no wealth can be fucked with.
---
They‚Äôre both good. Dfs slightly more afk and less risk of dying if pot runs out
---
My character needs some AA meetings
---
When me max cape, they see... they see...
---
Glad to know we have a community on the same page.
---
But they have completely taken on feedback and changed things we didn‚Äôt like
---
The game communicate with the web page????? Stop talking out of your ass. It‚Äôs in a database... you know.. the same one connected to all your skills and xp? If it wasn‚Äôt you could just change your collection log numbers client side. 
---
Do your research. Fucking moron
---
I‚Äôd say t bow at brutals is less afk
---
Funny thing is he's missing all the un-tradables even with all that gold. Shitty flex.
---
He doesn‚Äôt even own a laptop. Dudes still playing rs on school computers.
---
So, like required a phone to log into email if it's a different ip/computer? My email has this.
---
Tons hours of boring quests, or a 3 hours of construction for the same perk? HMM idk
---
At that point it would take some planning.  You would need all your skills at 94 minimum and no 99.  You would probably need to be trying to not have a 99 at 120.
---
you dont need a music cape. just all diaries.
---
you dont need a music cape.
---
Totally not cancer related at all amiright?
---
Not really. They‚Äôre pretty stable around 4m
---
Doesn‚Äôt avernic turn into cash?
---
EVERYONE STAY FUCKING CALM
---
No proof it's her, but who would pay them high prices for years, Some serious hater or herself? You decide
---
2nd this
---
But it's a fuckin joke of a tournament too lol. It's the same shit over and over, clans being fed and Jagex fucking it up somehow, and there's been what, a dozen of them? 
---
I simply don't care.
---
OSRS is so full of so much ahit it's insane. Yes, some of it is kind of meh or not engaging, but there is so much god damn shit in the game. A lot of people can get bored doing the same old shot because they've been playing for years, but anyone coming into the game new has an actually overwhelming amount of things open to them, and more still being added. Lot of content on the long grind to endgame to keep up variety, and then the endgame is loaded. The only real downfall is people often only enjoy certain sections/type of the game, which limits what they will enjoy and makes the game seem much smaller. But it is enormous
---
So if you weren't exactly security prone 10-17 years ago then just go fuck yourself forever don't even ask for a chance to secure your account even if you actively monitor it?
---
What a stupid fucking retort.
---
Easiest answer is a different skill.
---
I know it is 100% a NPCs Health bar.
---
The weird part is that the bar is not equal to any nearby NPCs.
---
So I guess the out of render part is why it's top left.
---
Sweet!
---
10-15% is quite low especially for smaller streams where there‚Äôs a lot more streamer to chat interaction. If you‚Äôve ever seen a stream with a moderately active chat with a similar/smaller viewer amount, and then compare it to her chat, you will notice that people message a lot less frequently and you can only pick out about 10-15 unique names typing at once even though she will have 300-500+ viewers.
---
There are too much low population f2p world if you ask me, unlike in 2007 when every world had around 1000 players
---
Nah it was a joke
---
Don‚Äôt want a production skill?
---
So was mod mat clapping them cheeks or what
---
True. It must be extremely far away then all I can think of. Surprised that despite being very far away it still rendered lol
---
Equality of opportunity &gt; equality of outcome
---
Git gud
---
Congrats! I got that same top today! I was at 101 dry and I thought I was cursed
---
damn man you should see a doctor. because that‚Äôs sick! congrats
---
when is the runescape eclipse
---
it has nothing to do with being new to runescape imo
---
Yeah that was about Mod Ash breastfeeding I think
---
Never in my life would I want the GE removed, but the addition of it completely changed the feel of the game to me
---
Man he seems mad
---
Surely he‚Äôs the most popular currently?
---
Nein
---
Yes and no. While not all 10 or 25 or even 40 people can use every item you are always rolling with at least one other person even in 10 man runs for gear unless your group is close to max gear.
---
Dh are tank legs iirc, depends on ever he prefer that's why I gave him two options. I would use obby for the str bonus.
---
07 was peak RSMV *sladeakevin*
---
The way you define production skill no. From the skills we've been pitched in terms of concept/gameplay I've only really seen good potential in artisan.
---
This is a pic of my account lol I posted this with a caption. I‚Äôm new to reddit how did this Alex dude find it I can‚Äôt even find my own postüòÇüò≠
---
I mean... If you go as far as why not all streamers get a ticket? Then why are all streamers more important then the player community. Why wouldn't jagex invite people who have actual skill, passion and good insight on game testing. I don't know much about Emily, I can't watch her stream or any stream with a dumb drawn on cat face.
---
Also Knightenator is pretty skilled at runescape and is a friend of Mod Kieran too. 
---
Plus if you are fighting depression, you need a ticket to a therapist not jagex.
---
&gt;*some*
---
Not sure man panic sell tho ASAP!

Ring of suffering is nice at Zulrah. Especially when you‚Äôre learning. Good defence stats and acts as recoil, doesn‚Äôt break so less to think about

The thread and it's comments are starting to turn out very toxic with people taking it to her twitter and breaking rule 2 from the sidebar; No flaming/trolling - keep things civil!
---
Lol no. This maximum efficiency ezscape version is nowhere close to the golden age. I'm talking Damage Inc/skullator/voltago/I mahatma I. When ROT got pissed on by just about everyone. That's the real golden age....but that's okay. This game is fun too, but it certainly isnt as fun.
---
EMILY ONLY FAKED DEPRESSION ONCE YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
that's a silly suggestion. no matter how insignificant, if it's bis, it's probably worth it. needless to say, i never expected to get this unlucky at cerberus.
---
Not even close
---
Impressive
---
Same ttl, same cb, no 99s as well closest being hp at 91. Gonna try for 2k ttl without a 99 and might be able to pull off getting 120 cb no 99s as well. Right now I'm working on diarys and I'm thinking 93 slayer is gonna be a bit tight on xp without hitting a 99.
---
&gt;Do a video on this?
---
I made a video and posted it on reddit. Should be on my profile under Posts
---
Not 100%

Does anyone think she should be forgiven for this? This was years ago.

Don't use total world's for wilderness. They get camped for the same reason you think they are.safer.

Nothing interesting happens when I rotate this picture :/

Amazing thanks for this great work

Runescape taught me there were different ways to spell words like armor/armour, grey/gray, color/colour.

Do you mean r/the_donald? The sub that is currently insinuating that all Muslim marriages are incestuous?
---
I just got 99str yesterday for my first 99 and hit 2050 total at the same time.
---
Yea I hate them as well, usually do it with a cannon at gnome stronghold.
---
Eh that's fair, just spitballing, goal would be to have the time between deciding to learn a boss you have no experience with and successfully killing it be equal compared to the ~2 hours it takes to get the NMZ points for an imbue currently.

---
I can't agree with that. We used to play for fun, now we play for the sweaty xp gains because we have much less time on our hands.
---
If we look at minigames we can clearly see that nobody plays for the fun of it, they play if there are rewards.
---
Talk about entitled. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to go, half her followers on Twitch are inactive, bots or simply don‚Äôt watch her anymore.
---
Pls let me know
---
I only watch the tourney for the drama, it's always fucking hilarious.
---
Let's not forget that she was actually busted for viewbotting, viewers doesn't mean shit when you're paying for them.
---
She has likely spent thousands on viewbots for them to only marginally pay off.
---
I know they aren't perfect, but I do feel that it is currently too easy to recover an account by only having access to the registered email. For some reason people don't protect their email properly. 
---
I think it is bad practice to give full authority over the account to anyone that has access to the registered email, without any verification from Jagex's end. They just assume that whoever has access to the email is the account owner. No questions asked. There must be something Jagex can do, right?
---
A suggestion I've brought up in the past would be to ability to link two of our accounts together. Jagex would then be able to use the second account's message centre to send verification codes to. It is similar to how Outlook and other email providers do it. But then you run in the same issues, what if you forget/lose access to that account?    
---
Sending a recovery token to the registered email doesn't work. As a potential hijacker already has access to that email and can dig it up.        
---
A second registered email might be too confusing. It already kinda is with all the different emails. You have the login email, registered email and payment email which all could be different.
---
If there's anything else, I'm all up for it.
---
Still sane, exile?
---
What's your profit per hour here, after accounting for dying to pkers?
---
Yeah bro, one day we are just playing rs, next thing we know our account's highscores are all over the news on live TV.
---
I'm mostly baffled by you getting magic dead last.
---
Whats a collection log?

Are you doing all the elites?

"Scape Ball" sounds like the name they would give the track to the Holiday Christmas event if they made it a Christmas Ball kind of thing. Just like Scape Santa etc.

Thanks for your feedback, we have discussed real life ID options and we are open to looking at all solutions. It does present a couple of significant challenges. Firstly obtaining, processing and storing that volume of personal data does have huge data privacy implications and secondly many of our users may not have ID they can provide. It's a sensible suggestion of course, and is used by other companies - but is certainly not a straight forward solution that would work for everyone all of the time.

i enjoy how the phrase ‚Äúnow what‚Äù in the title can incite the philosophical thinking about using that phrase in real life, and how when compared to real life, this post and the image that goes along with it really makes you realize how the only way to ‚Äúmax‚Äù one‚Äôs life is by dying. there is no way live like a completionist, because we are given a finite time to finish an infinite task. i think having the goal of maxing on runescape is fulfilling for us because maxing in runescape is a finite task given to you to complete in an ‚Äúinfinite time‚Äù(your life). ‚Äúdoable‚Äù one could call it. could an infinitely sized task be completed if infinite time is given to complete it?
---
What does 10-17 years ago have to do with anything?
---
Add a unique email to the account, add a unique password, 2fa the account and the email. If its getting recovered even through all that someone has literally been datamining you of your payment info. Virus scan your PC. It genuinely baffles me how people think hackers just "guess" or "come across" this info in leaks. You can change half of the information regarding your account. The one big flaw at the moment is you can't change security questions if they previously existed on the account.
---
Are the pkers in high total level worlds more skilled at pvp and harder to escape from than pkers in unrestricted worlds?
---
And do you encounter more pkers  in unrestricted worlds than in total level worlds?
---
Very debatable. Also I don't think jagex is using that as a metric on who they're picking.
---
Hard choice....

How boring is your life that you're worried you're missing out on content where someone is catching swamp lizards?
---
Uncommon but my personal golden age was late 2013/2014; rs3 had kind of found its feet and ironed out a lot of the flaws it had on release and mtx wasn't yet as intrusive as it is today, and I could play old school at the same time, while it was young and fresh, before people needed GE and new content to stay. 
---
And in both games I wasn't a dumb 8 year old so I could actually do all the content that young me considered unreachable.
---
It may surprise you but people in uproar and blaming someone else isn't indicative of just a flaw in the system, but rather people unable to accept their own flaws. So as i've said, you're now simply using "people complain about it, so there **must** be a problem". I disagree, people complain because being hacked sucks and they want to hold someone responsible, but don't dare hold themselves responsible.
---
I've played this game for over a decade, i was an idiot kid just like anyone who clicked on phishing links and the likes. I'm still using an account made in 2006. Its never been hacked.
---
Shouldn't take that much damage if you use the fremmy shield and pray melee at ice trolls.

You are likely not this pathetic

They still couldnt use the acc because of the pin
---
Issue with the cellar dungeon is the cave goblin plotline is not necessary for making friends with my arm, so it'd nerf a huge component of the goblin questline.

As for Shayzien Crypts, that place has no function other than ds2 as of present.
---
I mean, hiscores were always a thing. Stat spy was never designed to compete with hiscores, it‚Äôs ‚Äúuseful‚Äù since it displays current stats, as in current prayer points and boosts.

I can't tell if you're aware from the OP, but you can 1-tick withdraw and bank to optimize rates.  You need to basically drive-by the bar dispenser and then 1tick bank (preferably with screen markers), and click back to deposit ore or  to coal bag

We can just waterboard, er, splash him

It could be, but the grand exchange and third party clients exist so it definitely isn't

RNG, man. I got the dragon defender on the very first kill and couldn‚Äôt believe it. But it took me hours to upgrade from steel.

 I no longer have any doubts or questions about this.

Thanks a lot of these people who helped a bit or tried to give me a solution and fuck all these who came to criticize negatively without even knowing what was happening here.

Jagex MODS helped me a lot and no, the Support Center didn't had a solution for me or about this point, i was reading a lot more than you all assholes think.

nope, i was didn't want to rip an image out of his videos and quickly shot this one myself. But yes, this is a swampletics reference.

I wouldnt even dare to try sire on mobile
---
I personally keep the dhide body on cuz honestly I never react fast enough to someone tb'ing/barraging as their first hit
---
lol I'm the opposite. I got steel first kill and have spent hours on dragon.
---
Wrong.
---
Nah, combat bracelet is on your left arm. The second to last panels shows his right.
---
I mean 50% of accounts don't have 2fa, they probably use the same password for their email and account, and have had credentials in a massive hack.

spending 15m to save 50 hours of time in which you can easily make 100-150m in the time saved? hmm idk

How long does Mournings end II take to complete in the books then? :O

Thankyou osrs.
---
Just came here to say, happy cake/cheese day
---
Ohh okay thank you, i'll try salve ei out. My range is only 80 atm.
---
Easy way to avoid that so just use recovery questions as passwords not actual questions
---
You could always challenge yourself and learn more 'difficult', high-effort methods rather than taking the path of least resistance. I think there's plenty of diversity in how you train most skills and some skills have a pretty high skill ceiling (Lava RC, black chin Hunter, quarry Mining) that you could always do if you feel like skilling is boring. 
---
You don't have to sweat the whole way to 99 but of course it's going to be boring if you AFK or do the easy thing for most skills; these methods are slow and make almost no money.
---
yep!
---
I've never gone to the Shayzien crypts after ds2 lol
---
Just so you know, I worked on a massive theory like 9 months ago and posted it to /r/2007scape the wiki is incorrect. Marks of grace are on a timer. It has nothing to do with jumping on courses with more/less roofs. You can afk on a roof for 4 minutes and 45 seconds (around that time) and on that very next lap, you'll have a mark of grace spawn. The course means nothing.
---
I'm pretty sure I have more money than you lol.
---
Good cowboy, do you farm beans?
---
you can use it as your wallpaper, feel free to!
---
Its hard to suggest upgrades when you have no idea what you want to do. 
---
And you already have the staple upgrades (tort/anguish, imbued rings)
---
Also, seriously don't listen to the dude telling you to sell ang/tort for a fury and tassets. Thats literally a downgrade. 
---
So without knowing what you want to do, the only thing I can suggest is make ds2 a priority. Gives you access to get assembler (range upgrade) as well as fero gloves (melee upgrade). 
---
Other than that, any gear suggestions depends on what content you're doing. 
---
And if you're ever strapped for cash and need gp for an upgrade, sell the ahrims and eternals, as well as the arma helm. Also if you want to get a lance or dhcb or another nice upgrade like that and need gp, you can sell the prims as well.
---
Pls no, flicking eagle eye sounds like aids already
---
Doubt it if you're bitching about how much 99 herb costs
---
So ye whats the point then in saying 23 ehp 1 in each skill is 628k/h? As the only thing that actually matters is time to 200m all or time to max.
---
But the guy before me put 10m in and won so they are legit!!!! Im just unlucky, i will win next time. Can you loan me 1m? /s
---
It is void+salve is a huge improvement over slay helm and arma even if it is just reg void.
---
Who cares about when you signed up for a website lmao
---
First, with the Clan Wars updates, can the Classic Map be brought up on the map-selection? In F2P it's weird that you got to scroll past the P2P only maps before you find it.
---
Second, would you be looking at pathing in Clan Wars? It's been bugged since release.
---
Ofcourse, this could be intentional. In that case I'd love to know why?
---
For refference:
---
Previously you'd be able to "hug" enemy players around obstacles (trees, walls ect.) which led to an incredibly tactical gamemode with what is better known as 'tanking' (the combination of actual tanking, this hugging and dragging). Truly, Clan Wars is simply not the same without this and it's much less enjoyable as it has severely dumbed down the gamemode (and very much detracts from a quality over quantity setting). It's not as prevalent an issue in P2P wars, but in F2P it's a major factor, plenty of old CWA videos will show this in effect (and being used to great effect) and many of the veteran F2P warrers miss this tactic/skill to this day.
---
&gt;price of iron crashes
---
You don't get iron from miscellania? I think being at low favour will mean you lose money when you're under 80% favour so I'd put about 15 extra days above 750k and then you don't start losing too much if you don't collect for even longer
---
That would matter if you stood still on the course!
---
Yup. I handle the data protection for my current workplace and while it does require time and resources, it‚Äôs not inherently difficult to manage. 
---
I can only imagine half of the backend for Jagex is legacy though, which is why they don‚Äôt provide a few ‚Äúexpected‚Äù bits of functionality. Just a guess though.
---
Nah he's still around, I referenced him somewhere and he corrected me that he didn't take 17 zuks but 24. Absolute melvin.

Thats how you know you are old

my buddy got skotos yesterday as well, gz on pet, i'm 41 kc with no lil skot :(
---
It used to be that I would only see them once then they'd get banned next day. But recently I've been seeing rng bots that are already in my ignore list.
---
True, but if someone already had graceful and wanted to recolor, or just really hated agility and wanted graceful, you could just sit and alch, do a lap to get your mark, then alch again.
---
Just because something is more click intensive doesn't make it fun.
---
[I guess I win](https://i.imgur.com/XFuRWms.png) - I can still say that herblore is fine currently. I wasn't even bitching about it being expensive; I said it is currently fine and there is no reason to remove the herb boxes from NMZ
---
Some JMod said on stream once that as long as you don't log in, your favour doesn't tick down.
---
On average, they are around 100k. Yes, some will be 7k, while others are 600k. Welcome to the world of RNG drops.
---
Big F good luck on pet.
---
Any tips? Doing the same soon.
---
Nope, I've received some hate for that lol
---
lol gonna get pked now
---
sometimes i get marks on consecutive laps at seers so idk how this could be true, my understanding is every time you start a course it rolls whether or not a mark appears.
---
Like I said - what are you crying about then with your "lack of capital"? You didn't even adress my point at all. Literally nothing to "win" here (unless you're autistic, in which case I'm sorry). Are you actually stupid or..?
---
This is all the balancing it needs IMO.
---
Calling her self a content creator is where everything went down hill fast.
---
I hate people beat around the Bush and trying to give streaming a better name that what it is.
---
The Eternal Slayer Ring, except for its unlimited teleport is not very unique. Slayer rings are, after you get 75 crafting, very cheap and easy to make. Is it possible to create 1 or 2 more unique features like fusing it to the slayer helmets or adding 1 extra teleport? suggestions are always welcome.
---
I also streamed barrows for a couple days. We‚Äôre probs going to be in the same hotel room !
---
You've probably never done KBD
---
99 magic as last 99? is that for a reason or just how it turned out? anyway congratz!
---
If you want to level herblore somewhat efficiently you either have to pay a high gp/xp (brews/ranging pots/etc) or have an insane starting capital (need around 1b for 90-&gt;99 with those level potions).
---
Sure you can buy and sell but that's annoying as fuck. I don't see the point in making herblore even more costly/capital intensive to train? 
---
Also just because I have a shit ton of money that doesn't mean it's liquid. The dragon dart tip stack was acquired by selling some other items I had. I need to buy those back since I need those for PVM.
---
they're unlimited teles and never break, that's the use of them. but i really love the idea of a poh mounted one, and a crystal superior garden sounds interesting. someone should draw up an example of what they think it should look like/features included. anyone got some spare time and mad skills?
---
I used to use 2k total but realized the skills of the pkers are much better than the average callisto pker. It also helps that I stream so lots of people protect me.

90 - 99 herblore also takes a couple of days. If you can't go without a t bow for 3 days (a complete non essential for ToB) that's 100% a you problem my dude.

Thanks yo

So it's not just me. Personally what I do it hop on my alt and run back with darts and just tag all his shit so he gets reduced slayer xp

Or safespot Kraka on Troll Stronghold for the common key half drop üòÑ

Congrats
---
I think you can't compare them because they are so different. Today's OSRS is great and RuneScape back before '07 is great. Each in their own unique way.
---
You don't sit there and watch your crops grow for farming... It is something you do every hour or so while you do other things in between harvest. Same with birdhouse runs for hunter.
---
she should also not be megashit at everything and boring that helps too
---
Tell me about it. I started farming demonic gorillas and they are the most fun mob I have killed so far. That first zenny drop I got was the greatest feeling. Yet there are still so many things I cant reasonably kill with my stats/gear. Also only 75 slayer myself so I'm looking forward to killing cerb, hydras and krakens myself.
---
Blocked üòÇ

I train skills and do quests so that I can use better gear and areas-to do slayer better.  Also so I can finish the clues I get from slayer.

I don‚Äôt like mining or fishing or runecrafting but having bgloves, ds2, mm2, void, fire cape, elite diaries etc makes the parts of the game I like more enjoyable.  
---
There‚Äôs a bigger gratification because I had to do all that shit and I get to enjoy the rewards.  I‚Äôm not gonna braindead slap shit with an obby cape and combat bracelet leaving every clue on the ground because Sherlock wants my level 1 fishing ass to fish a fucking salmon

I know, and I‚Äôve been saying for months now that th recovery system is flawed and out of date (it‚Äôs now what, 19 years old without any sort of update/overhaul?).
---
The account recovery form needs to either be removed or overhauled.

I like the idea of an expansion but it would have to really encourage people to get out there, it‚Äôs rare to bump into people if you‚Äôre not at the main hotspots. A potential solution could be to add more cave systems. I like the idea

---
Blizzard looked at what it would cost to maintain everything needed for the ID system and determined that the cost sink to offer this service is worth it for the level of customer service it provides.
---
Jagex scratched their head and wondered why anyone would offer any resources towards account recovery. They probably sit in board meetings wondering why blizzard offers this service, unable to comprehend that increasing customer satisfaction increases sales.
---
In fairness, it's also probably based on what's established. Blizzard is known for having exceptional customer service. It makes sense they invest into stuff like this to keep their reputation.
---
People expect Jagex to have 0 customer support, though. They have no reputation to maintain, so why allow people to recover using IDs when all it would do is make a more satisfied customer? Someone pays $11 either way.

Jagex publishing list is a graveyard.

The only good and surviving IP they've had is OSRS. Jury is still out on that one.

Interesting. So to do this, I have to fill up my bank first before I can make use of this method huh.

One hit? Not really plus the theme works you are so tankish you can occasionally take a lethal blow, plus it takes getting up to 99 Def so not really that op for hight level characters

Severe daddy issues. She‚Äôs crazy for male attention. Let‚Äôs look at the signs. She plays a game consisting of at least 95% dudes. She streams, and her audience consists of mostly dudes. She puts on cat makeup to look ‚Äúcute‚Äù for her mostly male audience. She thirst traps Mod MatK to get more male attention and clout. She falsely claims to have cancer (idr if it was her or her mom) to get boohoos and more attention. 
---
She was likely bullied in school by other girls for her weird male attention-seeking antics, so this is partly why she went all-in and chose a career out of seeking male attention. Very likely, she does not get along well with other girls.

They are phishing emails. See Mod Weath's Tweet: https://twitter.com/JagexWeath/status/1126166864034447361

Also, do your self a favor and **change the registered email yourself**. No reason to risk accidentally clicking on one. Especially when you can just filter out all the legitimate ones as they'll go into your new email instead.

This was in reference to anyone who hasn't done the quest yet, ahh, good old times :D

They still do. Which ones are you killing?
---
Sorry for the noob question, but what quest would give you something that would be better in that slot than the combat bracelet?
---
Horrible story line though.
---
Honestly, very smart move on her part. She realized she went viral on here, so she‚Äôs pandering to win over the OSRS player base, which are over 95% dudes who all watch porn.

It's not recommended but if you want to click and hold on to the link. You will now see the actual website that it's going to send you to. It's a very easy way to tell if it's a scam link or not. Still wouldn't recommend to go through links and recommend using the official RuneScape website

I play rs3 but someone hacked my account to bot on osrs. Got permabanned, but rose from the grave somehow. I started playing my old school account recently and now I see why people reported me and got me permabanned, bots are atrocious.

I think this is absolutely true in a pure gameplay sense even if not in like a cultural or social sense. We shit on the mods but the game was nowhere near as thoughtfully designed in 2007 as it was now

---
The problem is it doesn‚Äôt happen frequently enough to stop the fake recoveries from cleaning an accounts inventory. I also want to suggest that this should only happen upon successful recovery attempts not any attempt.
---
In my head the process would go as follows:
---
Recovery success 1: 7day lock
---
Recovery success 2(if in 7day window): triggers a manual review by Jagex with a 7day SLA
---
I also suggest the ability to turn on mobile alerts(whether push notification from app or from sms). This would help for the instances that your email is also compromised.
---
My question is how would you suggest that they improve the recovery system? They already require a vast amount more information than most I‚Äôve ever seen. The only way I really can think of is having a large support team that would handle this process manually but even that is going to be flawed.
---
No, you're breathtaking!

It's terrible for every account build.

Most popular currently and perhaps most consistently popular &amp; most popular series ever. His videos regularly get almost half a million views within a week or 2. The only RuneScape series I can find that rivals that is tehnoobshow's original series that has about 600k views per video but that's had a 10 year head start and is less than half the length of settled's rn. There's definitely a good argument that can be made for settled being the most popular rs youtuber ever

Auto clicking won't bank for you
---
No way this is an auto clicker
---
I honestly think only 200k or so at most.
---
It's always like this. You get hopeful and Jagex proceeds to fuck up a North African country smh
---
Autoclicking is clicks in one location...how would he bank? Or click the individual rocks?
---
If fire cape was tradable, obby cape would be pretty much worthless.
---
People aren't newfags like you and have RS accounts over 10 years old. They might have had emails, passwords etc that were leaked in databaseleaks. They might pay more attention to security now but it doesn't matter. Changing them now doesn't help because you can recover using PAST account information.
---
Firecape is stupid easy for some, but it balances out by ppl willing to spend money instead of learning it, so I'd say anywhere between 500k and 1M

With his stats, you could not do mm2 to unlock demonics, the account does not have 70 prayer for piety / access to zammy gwd (or 77 for rigour, if you are planning on doing sara / kree), only has 30 agility (so zilyana is possible, but not exactly viable) - so even if you did not realise this was a DMM screenshot, and even if your excuse for only doing combat / slayer is "gwd / demonics / dag kings" are engaging content...
---
This account could, out of all gwd bosses, *only* attempt Graardor. Yay, such engagement

Hahaha yep. That's why they made an instance for it now

I was there originally with a cannon and he would attack a bloodveld and it would be on top of me and this caused them to body block each other from coming to me and the whole other section was empty of players.  He ended up tagging as many as he could I switched sides and then he did the same so I just hopped to get better efficiency.
---
I don't suppose Konar assigns you to do trolls in NMZ?  That was my preferred method.
---
No, an anti-fire shield and anti-fire potion is the same as a super anti-fire shield... however even a super anti-fire potion doesn‚Äôt protect ALL damage from Vorkath, but that is simply how Vorkath was made to work.... either way Vorkath is so profitable that personally I don‚Äôt mind paying the extra cost, so when I do chromatics on task for example I only have the extended super anti-fire potions

is that you johnny hobo :)

everyone in this game should learn to chill a bit

but just my opinion

I've found the farming guild really handy, for getting to and from the g.e. Makes it an easy place to start herb and tree runs, saves constantly buying skills necklaces.

Otherwise, people often say Brimhaven is useful for tree runs, or Port Sarim for easy access from the cabbage tele.

so 99 combats should bank me nothing if I didn't do it through slayer?
---
Yes. You get full protection without prayer that way which allows you to pray ranged. His ranged attack is more frequent than his mage attack so you prevent more damage this way.
---
I posted a video of me doing this to a guy with box traps a year ago and my post was removed for showing the guy‚Äôs username -_-

Like the other user said, Barrows Gloves are better. However you could also use a Regen Bracelet which is significantly easier to get than Barrows, and provides better offensive and defensive stats than Combat Brace, as well as faster passive healing.
---
this is good advice, 100% agree.
---
You should probably breathe more often than that.

Just checked, not for me. I‚Äôm always amazed at how open can either make me feel super motivated and driven or depressed and grossed out. All I can say is I‚Äôm not motivated or driven after watching a few seconds of her videos.

Also, I don't have IRL friends that play. I don't have ingame friends honestly, i prefer to play by myself most the time. I've used the Shield of Arrav clan chat to complete SOA and Hero's quest, and that's the most conversating in game i've done. Not sure what happened.

People have said to me to have the chart with the rotations up next to the client while you practice. You‚Äôll die for sure, but as you gain experience doing Zulrah you‚Äôll look at the chart less and less until you can do it consistently without looking. Persistence is the key.

All content that isn't bis is dead on arrival lol. You either make it bis or you don't. Most new stuff shouldn't be bis so most new stuff should be doa. Just the way it goes.
---
They were trying to trim down the skill to make it less complicated. That's a reasonable goal imo.
---
We have 6+ years of dank memes, fuck ups, conspiracy, crabbing, riots, drama, and triumph. There‚Äôs so much I can‚Äôt even fucking recall most of it without thinking for a minute. Time really does fly boys, and this era of RS has to be my favorite.
---
I'm on a master clue right now where I had to +5 boost twice, and now I have to get a bunch of crafting levels and +5 boost again. Hope it's worth it (I doubt it).
---
The chart definitely helped me!
---
Look at his comment history
---
Oh yeah good point. You're correct actually.
---
77 construction. Next lowest are 81 agility and hunter. I think I just train everything as I need it for diaries or clues
---
Yea it‚Äôs clear you do not know anything about programming. This is actually a fairly non-trivial problem to solve. Your solution is incredibly complicated to implement and would cost quite a pretty penny. And even if implemented is not guaranteed to detect bots without a significant amount of time learning a specific accounts patterns and behaviors. Which anyone with half a brain would be able to circumvent. 
---
Just because you THINK something is easy doesn‚Äôt mean it actually is at scale. I promise you jagex is doing everything they can with the amount of manpower and resources they have. I agree he should have been banned a long time ago but that‚Äôs the way of the world.
---
While she may dispense, she‚Äôs probably a net receptacle.
---
how can you tell the difference between a bot and a real player?
---
Can someone explain what happened here. What do bird snares do?
---
Dude that's nothing have a look at the chance at getting shield left half from brutal blacks I got it at like 300 kills lol
---
Exactly. If I get a scythe or tbow I‚Äôm keeping that shit. I don‚Äôt care for this game enough to be blacklisted from discords or anything
---
yeah but strong pvm gear locked behind skill requirements eists already too. barrows/feroucious gloves, explorer ring 4, ardy cape 4, torso,  dwarven helm, mythic cape, (imbued) god capes, ava's devices, zammy hasta, crstal shield, neitz helm, proselyte, god books, and graceful
---
The minimum possible is 89
---
The task is your like your girlfriend...
---
Quick and easy
---
Bots and gold farmers should never be used as an excuse to punish legit players. That's how we ended up with Wilderness PvP removal and free trade removal in 2007.
---
I don't ever recommend selling anything to buy something else (unless you're buying a Tbow or something). It's so easy to lose money that you'll have to make up later.
---
Mornings end pt 2 doesn't unlock fairy rings it's the stupid farming quests with the fairy queen
---
Lol okay well I don‚Äôt hang with this girl irl so what else do u want me to judge based on
---
Cannon from safespot the 4 south of you in gnome dungeon, while blowpiping the ones north of you. It's stupidly fast because it double shots like 2-3 of them and you mow them down with blowpipe.
---
I know there are incoming changes to how NMZ works/where it's located, but can we have a way for the Cuztomizable  rumbles to "remember" what the previously set values for that difficult is?   
---
So if I'm switching from Normal where I just did 5 bosses to Hard, it will auto remember the last 15 bosses I had set for Hard. Then switching back to Normal, it remembers the last 5 bosses. (Though this is purely a QoL suggesetion)
---
I‚Äôm in the exact same boat, started playing on my normal account and wasn‚Äôt really finding any goals or direction for the account, so started an Ironman and it is a lot more fun than I thought it would be. The hardcore status also allows for much better experience rather than just rushing through everything.
---
I generally did forget to screenshot the remainder like 3 messages and then you blocking me  
---
Something like this occured after the chatlog stopped  
---
LRichyy: I'm not him r\*\*ard  
---
Twistednips: It was a joke r\*\*ard  
---
Twistednips: Lowkey if you need someone to talk to (insert discord link)  
---
Twistednips: Hello?  
---
Twistednips: Did you block me?  
---
went something like this being honest here
---
Been awhile since I've been there... Not sure skill interfaces work. Have you tried the house options method? I'll go try in a bit.
---
I quite enjoy the wt chat, very wholesome
---
It's a combination of things. Notably it's summer in the northern hemisphere so more people are playing and adding items to the economy. In addition to this, the initial value reductions are enhanced by people panic selling, making prices go even lower. Some items were probably overvalued before the crash, and the panic may actually help to re-settle prices that are more appropriate for the value of certain items. The items that are actually valuable will probably rise back up over time.
---
Another theory for why a large variety of items are dropping in nominal value is that the supply of coins relative to items may have decreased, effectively making coins worth more. If coins are worth more then they used to be, then the prices of items will be reflected in a lower nominal coin value, even if the actual value of said items has not changed.
---
Olm pet when you use a certain dust on it. The dust is also dropped from CoX.
---
Thank you, still have ptsd from Mornings end pt2 haunting me, edited it out
---
Are you in f2p? Cause that's how it is in f2p
---
I saw in a youtube video, can't remember who, and they said that as long as favor is 100% when you collect, then it counts as 100% for the whole time. Not sure if this is true or not...?
---
Thank you, no one seemed to know
---
Eh that's pretty much where you'd be if you started Slayer mid-upper 70s combat stats. It's not too uncommon to wait a good deal so that you can start Slayer with nieve for efficiency. I wouldn't say "really low" is quite accurate.
---
This comment is why I love reddit, *sits down* *massive ingame exhale*
---
It is just like pets in real life in a way.  If you drop them on the ground they will follow you around and you can talk to some of them.  They are only obtainable by killing the monster yourself so everyone who sees the pet knows that you killed the monster/boss that drops it and that you got that drop.  As opposed to buying it with real world money etc.
---
Almost 1/16k from brutal blacks I cant moan though got skele viss from vork at 556 kc last night
---
I believe that blue create is supposed to be a Smurf.
---
Nope.  All auto clickers are bots, but not all bots are auto clickers.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt know that much about coding
---
This guys in w492 have fun
---
Hell, Saradomin's Blessed sword is BIS behind only the Rapier, and it's quite affordable right now. I always recommend it to players who don't have 25m liquid lying about.
---
Who gives a shit.

no one gets caught, bots are in top 50 highscores without getting caught
---

*Jagex‚Äôs work
---
If you are doing slayer i would suggest sgs/guthans becuse it extends the trips alot
---
Oh, is there any sort of list that shows them and the boss you have to kill to get them? Also any recommendations for a semi-low level player
---
Well shit what a dick
---
Pet papa smurf
---
Wait, so you didn't attempt to change sides, did crash me, and used the same language to me. Seems like you were very misleading in the comments before I got here!!! Have a great day man I'm sorry for being a dick
---
&gt;Jagex could set parameters so that if someone has repeated the exact same action within the same timeframe over and over, the account would go under manual review.
---
Here's some psuedocode to counter your suggestions:
---
&gt;Start loop
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Perform action
---
&gt;Wait for random period of time between 0.5:1.5   seconds
---
&gt;End
---
Done.
---
Everyone on Runescape is a bot except you.
---
Makes accounts harder to steal then?
---
You act like companies like Jagex know the concept of long-term vs short-term profit
---
Was streaming on YouTube the. A couple of months ago he got unbanned from twitch. Wouldn‚Äôt advise watching him though.
---
The feather in the mouth is perfect. Awesome work
---
Didn't see that, my bad dude.
---
That's a bold move Cotton!  Let's see how it works out for him.
---
Took me 8 kills
---
That's definitely photoshopped
---
You can't judge a book by its strategically lying cover
---
vote yes on warding so you can keep playing the game ! 
---
  
---
Also....Runecrafting, mining, agility, all before magic??/
---
This made my day
---
Inb4 jagex disables bird snares in mining guild
---
Go outside
---
I know, I'm just saying overall.
---
They're also a great smackdown if you scroll down where someone asks for an unban.
---
RIP RANGE TRIM
---
If they did then OSRS wouldn‚Äôt exist lol.
---
Good one!
---

agility tickets? god damn son.

I did blackjacking to 80 then I was on the verge of sudoku so I just went and did ardy knights till 99. That was fairly comfy.
---
We have a spy deep in the Pixar realm. We see you, Soldier. We'll get you back home safe and sound. Over and out.
---
That's still living once
---
Well frick
---
Magic last? Never seen before.
---
I had more fun back in the day but I see where you're coming from
---
Sounds like it cant be done guys thank you. I was just wondering if it was all unlockable staying low for wintertodt. But I'll just wait til I'm done
---
Quick take it back, you need to breathe!
---
What trees should I chop on my Ironman? Rather, what logs are most useful? I'm finishing up 99 fm at Wintertodt and have some teak seeds. I was thinking I'll plant them on fossil island and bank the logs. That way I'll have some resources for construction down the road. (And good WC xp)
---
Am I going to miss out on logs for fletching and birdhouses? How do Ironmen typically manage their log needs?
---
What? Blizzard allows for this last time I checked.
---
Turn your regular garden into a formal garden so its slightly faster to load due to not needing to render the weeds.
---
This is Curb Your Enthusiasm, right?
---
Look at this dude. Its not funny.
---
Up the ante and make a region locked UIM.
---
Now this is content I love to see.
---
The one's who replyed, you probably were like "y-you're still b-botting!! You probably just replied to hide the fact that y-you're botting!!!" As I've said in the past, the mindset of nearly every player of this game seems to be "everyone is botting at all times no matter what, and if you talk to them and they reply, it's simply because they're watching their bot client, because everyone is a bot, 100% no matter what".
---
Playdough/clay-like I think he means.
---
FluffSoft's AHK programs are the main cause of these bots. Free to download, thousands of users on multiple accounts all at the same time manipulating their flagging process by 'realistic &amp; human' pausing throughout a bot's script cycle which is usually 6 hours before it logs you out, so you can hop on and do it again.
---
Not anymore.
---
Make an ult, I didn't think I'd have as much fun as I'm having after my main had diary cape but this mode has helped.
---
&gt;nside to it. Sure, you lose a few runes/arrows, but it's nothing. A PKer has no idea what the victim is carrying, so you'd be foolish not to im
---
Agreed. I've got several mil loots from people running naked/doing clue in wilderness. So it's always wise to PK even naked bois just in case.
---
Repetitious movements.  As in, robotically repetitious.
---
But...it's a double edged sword.  Sometimes, people can get into a groove and seem robotic in third movements.  In this case, you have to watch if they respond to outside stimuli (not just chatting...I play with public off, and so do a lot of others).
---
This guy was more than likely using a macro, not hitting.  Bots nowadays can sort of deal with stuff like this.
---
&gt;Yeah, i havent been able to justify p2p yet cause i only play a few hours a day
---
Let us show you de wae. Download Runelite, and become a member.
---
it's 1/128 so not really common but not particularly rare.  But 3 in a row is very unlikely
---
(1/128) \* (1/128) \* (1/128) is very slim odds
---
No ones asking you to judge lol. People are just trying to explain that you can‚Äôt use her profile picture to contradict the initial person you responded to saying she wasn‚Äôt attractive based on other pics he‚Äôd seen of her. 
---
Nothing serious man but just fyi going forward girls always make themselves look way more attractive than they are in pics like this.
---
No worries, wouldn't expect you to have seen it :p
---
In case this is a genuine question, the end game range armor would be either karil's or Armadyl if you're rich.
---
Good dhing account if you don't mind the risk.
---
This but unironically
---
Oh I‚Äôve seen this guy before. Chill guy.
---
Guys I am 2069 total, 12 99's including Slayer and I don't have a Firecape =\\ I play really casually on mobile/laptop and have never got round to getting the Firecape. Roast me I guess.
---
Y
---
this post is just a low key flex that you are nearly 126 combat as shown by the colour of the names. nice.
---
I'm about to do whats called a pro gamer move
---
Buy a few more bonds and upgrade to Dragonfire Ward
---
To move 2 spaces you can just tap at least 2 spaces in a direction where there are no scions then tap sire.
---
Still good to leave for like an hour, I can't imagine someone using such a basic macro leaving it on overnight I'd imagine this guy is just watching Netflix and looking back every hour or so.
---
That or this is his first time and he things that would work reliably.
---
Since when?
---
It most certainly is. 
---
Bots are object oriented, clickers are mouse position oriented.
---
That's it. I'm taking snares to air orbs.
---
then avoid running under him when you blowpipe the healers, and don't get off the pray rotations
---
The bot just announced out loud everyone it trades with. Report them and if they actually traded Jagex will be able to see that.
---
Hmm
---
Edit: I talked to him on discord and he was banking when I logged on and he was trolling don't take this post too seriously
---
Nobody that actually grinded out enough money for a DCHB trouts out a vork setup like that, with an uninfused archers ring no less.
---
Dismiss the sandwich lady and let‚Äôs get to it!
---
[My gear](https://i.imgur.com/nOSD79w.png)
---
Only things I can really suggest is to make sure Hydra is always over the next vent before he transforms, and when you move around make sure you're not missing any hits. Don't just run straight to a spot, make sure you get hits in while moving to your next spot. Same on the fire phase - move one tile at a time and get extra hits in as he's spitting out fire at you.
---
So what? Then Jagex will see that person never traded in the report.
---
Are you getting it
---
Oh boy. You can pay 50k a trip to have it isntanced I'm pretty sure
---
A while ago, I dunno.
---
I‚Äôm mobile only....
---
Oh lol. I wonder if that was autocorrect or if he just things it‚Äôs spelled like that. 
---
In any case, I‚Äôd love to see a plugin that makes the graphics look more Plato-like.
---
Stats/Gear? If you're using a rotation guide i suggest having all the rotations up and not using one that requires you to click where he goes next.
---
dunning-kruger in action lol
---
Brimstone keys average 100k loot (roughly), but the opportunity cost of using Konar far exceeds the benefit of an average key when you keep certain considerations in mind:
---
1) You miss out on a fair few boss tasks by choosing Konar. 
---
You can't do Demonic Gorillas (black demons) on task, which is a damn shame, and you also can't do Kril Tsutsaroth (Greater Demons) unless she assigns the much rarer boss task (which is capped at 35 kills anyway). 
---
You also get Dagannoth Kings, Cerberus, and Abyssal Sire tasks at 1/3rd the frequency as other slayer masters because only 1 in 3 possible locations allow for those bosses to be slain on task. 
---
2) The standard slayer assignments aren't great to begin with.
---
Konar assigns a lot of unfavorable (not afkable, cannonable, or expedient) locations for monsters that would otherwise be great Slayer xp. 
---
Anyone who's had to experience Aberrant Spectres in Kourend, abyssal demons in the Abyss (only way to do Sire with Konar but horrible otherwise), or bloodveld in the God Wars Dungeon knows what I mean here. 
---
In addition to this, wyrms and drakes (exclusively assigned by Konar) are neither great money nor great xp, and they're somewhat of a hassle to kill. 
---
All in all, having to skip these tasks for the sake of sanity ends up negating any effect the bonus slayer points might have in Konar's favor. 
---
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
---
Having said all that, Konar becomes very important after 95 because the Alchemical Hydra (which is exclusive to Konar) is a very lucrative boss, and also offers upwards of 150k Slayer xp per task. 
---
In my opinion, grinding Slayer with a mix of fast tasks and boss tasks till 95, and then going exclusively to Konar for hydras is the best way to train Slayer profitably. 
---
Getting slowed down by boring and suboptimal tasks before 95 is not worth the keys, which can be few and far between. 
---
For reference, I had about ~175 brimstone keys or 19.2m from 95-99 Slayer (4m+ xp). On the other hand, I've had maybe 8-9 zenyte shards (130m with then prices) from 85-92 Slayer (also about 4m xp) from Steve.
---
Killed him about 20 times before I gave up and made my own damn lyre
---
It's worth noting, that the chart is heavily subjective. I personally tried the chart, and it only made it worse as it diverted my attention away from the actual fight. (The human attention is quite shit, and isn't meant for multiple things at once). For me, it worked to just go in blind and try and memorize 1 rotation at a time.. trying to memorize multiple rotations is more than likely just going to mess with your head. Took me about 20-30 attempts and i had basically every rotation on lock :)
---
LMAOOOOO FUCK
---
&gt;It will be solid, and repetitive, but bots will hit their mark every time unless the code fails somewhere.
---
You could add a delay or if you're feeling really clever, a random miss-click function. I'm not trying to be a Debbi downer, but jagex get a lot of shit from people who really don't understand how hard it would be to automatically detect bots.
---
Any competent programmer could introduce some randomness to their bot which would thwart automatic detection. 
---
Perhaps jagex have had a brainstorm and thought of something, but they'll never let on because the first thing the bot makers would do is update their code.
---
Nah the Torture ornament kit is the best.
---
When it comes down to it the length of the password matters more when it comes to brute force (as long as it's not easy to guess). At least 15 characters should be the minimum. The time is takes to brute force depends on what computing power this person has access to and the complexity of your password (but more so the length).
---
Luvz to ben

You're supposed to race people for the rare imps, would not make sense to just hand them out.
---
Dungeoneering/summoning were both kinda the beginning to the end of RS. Moreso dungeoneering than summoning though for sure.
---
How do you program a bot this badly?
---
Can we add a notification in chat box when you‚Äôve paid a farmer to watch a patch?
---
‚ÄúEllena is now watching your catherby fruit tree patch‚Äù
---
that actually happened to me i guess about 2 years ago. i was just killing hill giants on a new character for like 3 or 4 hours and burying all the bones and the game thought my mouse clicks looked too robotic??
---
Yo I know that guy thats botting in irl lmao
---
Standard definitions of active for services I've done these kinds of statistics for is usually someone who's utilized it in the last month, but I don't know if that really translates well for a video game.
---
Took me 1770, your journey has only just begun
---
You can buy a rune pouch with them
---
Y fletch?
---
Way more than 70% but good suggestion
---
I just joined reddit and i'm surprised + glad that there's a good community of people here for OSRS.
---
click a few times and right click and hope for some loots
---
Same thing happens to me i ended up with more money and better stats. I also got banned but i emailed Jagex support and they unbanned my account.
---
I think I've seen a few with 20k+ but most get the pet under drop rate, block and never go back.
---
Stay on RS3. We don‚Äôt want your kind here
---
I did ratchatchers and rfd with a kitten, because apparently I hate myself and always make the mistake of "pffft when I'm I ever going to need a cat again, shoo motherfucker"
---
I thought it was for my horsecock futa orc girl mods
---
Guy botting scrolling through reddit today:
---
"Oh shiiiiiit"
---
It literally gives you another life on a short cool down. The entire point of hardcore is having one life. It's incredibly overpowered.
---
The bot would need to right click in order to walk on the same tile as a bird snare, but this one is programmed to only left click
---
Farming guild, Etceteria to rake up your kingdom and collect berries and Brimhaven for the patches
---
&gt;In this context, macros and bots are both effectively the same, ergo, the difference between the two is semantic. 
---
Squares vs rectangles
---
&gt;I also think you‚Äôre missing the difference: Macros can be set up to require 0 human interaction
---
I literally stated that.  You're writing before reading the entire comment.
---
&gt;Bots are built around Java reflection
---
Not exclusively.
---
&gt;I can see how you‚Äôd say that macros are bots, but the most important distinction in this example is that macros with ahk or something similar are dumb, whereas bots are also dumb but more specific in implementation.
---
That makes 0 sense.  Both are specific in implementation.  The point of both is to complete a specific task.
---
You're just using buzz words to try to sway my answers in a different direction when all you're doing is agreeing with me while stating you're not.
---
Don't freak out over market drops. Buy items for a good price and keep them as long as they're useful to you.
---
Tele to rimmington house portal, hop to 330 and use someone's house that has mounted talisman, then battlefield teleport. ~1 min
---
No idea, sorry, I didn't boost when I did it.
---
Damn that‚Äôs intense, I can‚Äôt even play on 2 accounts at once
---
Maybe a Zerker
---
Then suggest that stuff
---
That's why I said redundant
---
Legit took me six hours to get my first dragon defender drop and then one kill to get the second. Good luck.
---
Not with two tier 1s
---
Instructions unclear, ran melee distance.
---
Oh boy, my first toxic experience! Thanks! :D
---
People would just buy low on f2p and sell high on members
---
Make the organ in the poh chapel upgradable to a player piano
---
Iirc it has a bunch of features the mods specifically asked the runelite devs to remove so... Yeah, I wouldn't risk it
---
You're never going to get it if you sell them tho
---
Some people do find things that are more click intensive more fun, though. They're more interactive, scaled with good timing and effort invested, and usually the methods are more interesting than click and wait
---
Got mine at 101... was a verac's flail....
---
Right? Dismissed!
---
I'll add you once I'm off work later. Rsn will be "possum puke"
---
Buying a tier 10 will be cheaper in the long run
---
This would cause a price difference between free and member's worlds, and people would just hop to F2P to buy cheap maples / iron ore / hides.
---
Sooo, cocky manlet is your tldr?
---
Girls definitely like a fit dude too. My gf much prefers my look now than before lifting. Also if girls don‚Äôt like it why do you do it? You mentioned gay guys before so are you doing it for the guys?
---
Am I not welcome here anymore?
---
At 45 thieving you should be able to get ~60-70k exp an hour with mediocre clicking accuracy.
---
All I want from life is OSHD and dungeoneering
---
It‚Äôs probably a random ISP issue. The US had the issue 3 weeks ago. Just run a VPN and you‚Äôll be fine until it‚Äôs resolved.
---
Mom's spaghetti code.
---
Eh I think it's more utilized than rc, fletch, cooking, etc. The high end benefits are extremely convenient and used often by normal, ironman and even pure accounts
---
Just try it out. A few practice attempts won't cost you much in supplies for really any boss.
---
- all the times I pked you :D
---
Damn, must suck to live in a country where people make so little that selling accounts is that much more income. Venezuela?
---
Identity theft is a crime, Klootviool95!
---
Fully agree . But also not having the knowledge of the boss for new players or even returning players leaves many never even attempting bossing.
---
Was this really necessary lol
---
Afk agility or pure strength xp.
---
Can i buy a D pic for like 2m since you have so many? /u/shewdoh
---
Oh yeah no I am happy with the games current state as well don't get me wrong. Just thinking about the future that's all.  
---
Just trying to start a discussion about it.
---
Yes
---
If you used team viewer I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs much they can do
---
I think he meant he wanted to make a game suggestion in the form of those pictures with yellow text and a black background (In rs font).
---
If you can equip a trident, you can kill kraken. (75 i believe)
---
I always right-click use urinal first
---
At least they've since added Revolution so you can just have a good portion of the abilities used for you automatically without it distracting too much from what it once was. Though it is a little unusual to just be spamming abilities like Surge when skilling to move around faster. 
---
At least there's resting, I guess.
---
Chambers too, since it has a team list. I guess they could technically add it as a feature in CCs but ofc we'll have to wait for the Clan Chat engine rework for that too.
---
i have about 500m in total. haven't done much nmz. only recently found out you can get points super quicky but i dont really enjoy doing it.
---
I'd say it's totally worth it. At least you won't have to pay a second subscription fee.
---
Guthix would never assume reality's gender.
---
70 magic is kinda slow, u should get at least 75 for trident
---
It‚Äôs probably not that hard if for example it‚Äôs your first couple of runs with no inferno experience on any of your accounts and acquire the cape within maybe 3 runs then it‚Äôs not a real cape no-one with no experience goes in there and hits the cape straight away
---
Someone who hates training agility the traditional way.
---
? It‚Äôs easy as fuck 
---
Tons of guides on yt to safespot it
---
It means that I'm out of touch with normie gameplay since it's been so long. Knew about the update, but it's not something that does anything for me, so it didn't click.
---
Thanks for calling me hot... But I knew that already ;)
---
TehNoobShow :(?
---
I definitely didn't call it a "guide" as you quoted me, I literally said helper tool. I am not underselling the tool or trying to make it look like it isn't as powerful as it is; I literally only suggested it because I know how useful it is for someone trying to learn rotations.
---
Basically, if your game style completely changes during an attempt. For example, I don‚Äôt use f keys when I play. If I‚Äôve never used f keys and all of a sudden I use them for an inferno attempt and then back to never using them, that would raise eyebrows. Same thing with things like tick eating, woox walking, perfect prayer flicks, dropping items to use as markers, etc.
---
Ahhh, that makes sense!
---
I mean.. who can compete with our master, the great Swampletics?
---
But it is similar. It's a version of the same game
---
Killing a boss faster is its own form of damage reduction, and is particularly relevant for special attacks or other incidental sources of damage that are hard to counter. Tankier gear only helps you survive but does little to actually kill a boss.

well shit why do I still have my 3b

Um wow yikes sweetie.... Lots to unpack here.
---
Good one
---
Vorkath is already the best moneymaker in the game with a DHCB or lance, and almost one of the best moneymakers in the game if you only have a 3mil blowpipe. 
---
I think any buffs to his drops of any kind would be absurd and if anything they should be nerfed
---
why the hell is removing infernal capes jagex's focus though? its 4+ str over the fire cape (like 1 extra max hit) why not focus on actual game issues like the billions of f2p bots or people using ahk in pvp?
---
It's the same with the regular highscores, you get one 99 in the same time as you'd get 1500 total.
---
I'm not sure if it used to be correct and was changed, or if it was just a rumor that was passed along. I believe it was clarified by Mod Ash
---
It does a good job of eroding anyone's faith in the general community to see a bunch of shitty losers screeching about women with 30+ upvotes.
---
Nope osrs is a different game from what you played. What you played turned into rs3. If you want your old stats you will find them on there. If you want the old school experience you will need to start fresh
---
That makes sense. So for example, in what scenarios would you use Fury over Torture?
---
it kinda looks like an exact copy of pre-eoc dharoks platebody.
---
Technically wasnt wiped. It still exists in rs3.
---
Stop being mean eat my downvote
---
Can you think something if its true?
---
Would it be correct to say "I think apples are fruit" when I know I'm certain of that fact?
---
But pets are worthless and nobody gives a shit
---
The only pet I need... :/
---
My guess is because it's easy, doesn't take a lot of time, and unlike the bot problem, it does't come back the instant you take care of it.
---
Q
---
Never done Corp before but I‚Äôm down to learn if you want someone else lol
---
Don‚Äôt breed
---
fury when your tanking a boss, like if your tanking bandos for friends you will use fury, but if you are doing dps to bandos you will use torture
---
U selling posters?

ah lmao, fair. i'm doing the exact same thing with my snaps at the moment. very satisfying to see that stack's value tick up with every harvest, no? can't wait to sell it all at once lol.
---
i'm assuming you haven't done your hosidius favor? if not, do that asap. zeah favor is a pain in the ass but if you're gonna do any one house, do hosidius, then kill some lizardmen for a talisman for the glade teleport.
---
100% favor gives you a disease free patch to plant valuable seeds in (ranarrs/snaps/torstols) which is guaranteed profit. if you're willing, you could even do my arm's big adventure for the other disease free patch which is a super super easy quest.
---
Have you thought about stopping your tree/fruit runs?
---
Prob at least 5m considering each attempt takes at least 1m
---
Zulrah works and I believe other death storage works too
---
Except you only have to equip the bracelet when the monster dies so you use b gloves and switch to bracelet for last hit if u want to be efficient
---
If you're using an alt account on the same IP as an account you've got an infernal on before, you're going to be good after a manual review. Using a VPN with a fresh IP on an alt account that's never been associated with your home IP? You've got some explaining to do, and will probably stay banned anyways since Jagex doesn't like VPNs.
---
i don‚Äôt have 200m xp yet so no
---
Yea i'm dumb af
---
How can they prove you didn‚Äôt do the cape from your own IP address?
---
Definitely should have some restores there, although from personal experience it perhaps doesnt matter as much as you‚Äôd think since dihns makes range and melee into playdoh and you‚Äôre unlikely to be KO‚Äôd out of mage, just makes you get frozen a lot, luckily with saras you should be okay.
---
Restores will make life a bit better though for sure
---
Yes, specifically Looking For Clan
---
These are pretty cool suggestions actually! i'd be so down with this, adds a new meta, new reasons to be on arceuus spellbook, feels very oldschool. the last one (craze) might be alittle much - as with how much damage can be delt to an NPC could easily stack out the player, and could potentially be abused for high xp rates
---
Yes and anyone who has ever played an FPS is a gun toting, grenade throwing, mass murderer.
---
I actually worked together with another guy who got assigned iron drags and also either couldn't/wasn't willing to skip. Was pretty fun actually, considering I usually play the game as if it were single player...
---
Maybe I should find a clan...
---
Why would the limit be 60 combat? That's so limiting
---
Good luck with a dihns pal lol
---
1001 kc here no shard in sight
---
Well you better open a new bank, plenty more seeds to come.
---
Camp range pray because you get way less time to react to range than you do mage, also. The magic attack takes like twice as long to animate and the sound notification happens at the head of the attack instead of at the middle/end
---
Give how prominent this is, was I the only one to discover varrock via the east gate before the dark wizards?
---
How old are you baby boy?
---
Alrighty. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I guess the Wintertodt freezes their brains so they starts to throw everything from their mouths.
---
Nope. Got a shouldering stone, 2 pegasians and eternal :(
---
Mat?
---
I hate quests so thats all good to me. More bosses has come in osrs than rs2 in the same period. Only thing short is pvp updates.
---
Oh I'm sure they are spending untold resources on this treachery. After all, I don't think they have anything better to be working on right  now...
---
I mean it takes less than 2mins
---
If you fail it you can quickly right click to pickpocket and it'll skip his attack then you can knock him out again. If you do it right he should never attack you
---
They do some client side checks and behavioural patterns are monitored. This is all theoretical since they will never release how they detect it. But I know of people who have got a 2 week ban using screen share.
---
I‚Äôm 118 combat / 2073 total w/o any combat 99s on my main. About 600k from 99 hp at the moment though.
---
So true, it‚Äôs like a mental word. But I don‚Äôt blame them, they‚Äôre at wintertodt
---
Can I be there when you do? I just wanna pick up your items tho.
---
but why use a dramen staff when you already can use fairy rings without it :(
---
Sure about that one?
---
I don‚Äôt remember that. Was that like 2009-12?
---
Yeah, it was hard to come up with ways for these to be balanced that fit with the lore of Arceuus. Thanks for the comment bro!
---
Sitting at 1.3k. Hoping to get pet soon so I can block that shit

Just post nudes on the clan discord server, duh.

Obviously, /s.
---
That's so cringy. I met one of my ex's on RS back in the day (and she's still one of my best friends) so like i get the appeal but there's no need to pester every woman for their tits.
---
Not Golden Age,  but the Runescape renaissance
---
Na, they just go through history of your tries and compare those tries with the run they get the cape. Obviously there will be major differences.
---
The NPCs lack depth and get kind of uppity if you touch them.
---
I mean i might be better than average at video games but I still don't know how people panic considering over an hour of your life rides on this you'd think you'd be more mentally prepared. Good for all you who overcame and still your cape tho üëçüèæ
---
i‚Äôm 26 stationed far, far away in the military. she does that.
---
Wow not sure why everyone's down voting you so much, I was confused until I read the explanation too
---
This ghost mouse is set up to click the same 3 rocks to what Im guessing is 27/28 inv spots (9 complete rotations of the 3x iron rocks) and then bank.
---
I'm saying, if Mr. Botter ends up going over the maximum 28 inventory amount on his 9 rotations, like gets multiple gems or clue scrolls, he will still complete his 9 rotations before banking. 
---
Meaning, he will still try to mine despite a full inventory, getting the "insufficient inventory space pop up" that's what I mean by redundant clicks.
---
That, coupled with the fact that they're clicking the same exact spots in the same exact pattern would be a braindead give away to Bot watch. Which was the point I was trying to make.
---
It's more efficient to just raid and do max xp/hr Slayer than boss tasks during Slayer. Only time where boss tasks might be worth doing is when you're transitioning to get Raids gear so you do Demonics and Vorkath on task. Cerb too technically but I think most people who are at that Slayer level are ready for Raids already.
---
lava dragons are fine, there's a safespot next to the stepping stone where you can hit 3 dragons and with trident its pretty fast. never seen a pker there in 1750s.

Go get ya $ big dawg! thanks for the support lol

Am i missing something?

If you're using hidden atk option and auto off, there is absolutely no way of getting skulled

no bad experiences, no banned accounts either üòÇ
---
Jagex don't need to bot bro 
---
I know people personally who are botting 
---
Botters crashed RuneScape currency and jagex had to reverse it back 
---
But it's great that you think in such ways.
---
That's because big titles use broadly adopted engines like FarCry Engine, or Unity Engine. AntiCheat software is developed to interact with the engine and trained for specific genres like FPS shooters. The anti cheat is made by Machines but facilitated by machine learning engineers, mathematicians, and statisticians. Then all big titles buy licences to the anti cheat software.
---
Jagex builds their own engines, and probably don't have enough engineering power to rework the engine to allow something as complex as a machine learning anti cheat software to interact with the engine.
---
I don't work at Jagex or know the details of the game engine but based on my experience with building game engines and legacy software this is my own deduction.
---
Couple reasons.  People have already mentioned that higher DPS = shorter boss times.  While it is true that DPS tank is a thing, it's more of a thing in osrs because defense doesn't actually reduce the amount you can get hit by, but just makes you less likely to get hit.  That's because the game checks whether you get hit and then if you do, then it rolls damage.  It's entirely possible to take 0 damage and still have it be a successful 'hit'. 
---
There are a few notable exceptions to this, the Elysian shield, the bulwark, and the Justicar armor all have actual damage reduction on successful hits but that doesn't change the fact that in osrs you can straight fucking die if magic RNG screws you multiple times over.  The damage received graphs over time in osrs fights are a lot spikier than other mmos.  This makes DPS tanking *much* more effective than damage reduction since shorter fights simply reduce the amount of time you are at risk of a damage spike.  If the damage received in osrs was a flatter curve, DPS tanking wouldn't be so important
---
Haha hahahahahah!!!
---
Nice delivery OP
---
Imo I would start by only doing rotation 3 with just magic (log if you don't get it). This is the easiest kill by far, tho it'll likely be a 4+ minute kill. Once you can do that, add rotations 1 and 2, then slowly add in ranged. Finally add in rotation 4, because it's the hardest. Mage only is slower, but easier. If you're an Ironman I would recommend doing mage only until you get a unique.
---
I got 70 prayer using the gp from my first zenyte shard drop. Have you completed MM2 or are you close to being able to do so? Gorillas are a much better moneymaker than Barrows and could net you that 6m you need in just one drop with a 1/300 chance

---
its really about learning rotations, and knowing where you need to stand for the next phase b4 it shows up.
---
Because based on his non-blocked stats, the blocked ones are on average level 15-16 and I don't think he wants anyone to point that out
---
You mean Larrens chest?
---
and i agree, ecumental keys would be a nice addition to the chest. So far all my rewards have been Raw sea turtles or gold ore.
---
are you by any chance a HCIM?
---
Hahahahaha shoulda covered that total
---
that method wouldn't change anything, they already use the buyers PC with remote access tools.
---
zulrah is so fun man

oof. i‚Äôve gotten three buckets, two of them b2b in 85 kc

WHY THE FUCK DO YOU LOOK LIKE TERRY DAVIS, CREATOR OF TEMPLE OS. HOLY SHIT
---
That's rough buddy.  Did you try to use Jagex's Reddit/Twitter customer support apparatus?
---
I haven't even done the fight caves yet but if my main got banned for doing the Inferno on a different internet (say, at university) and they denied my appeal, I would...temporarily part ways with my otherwise non-violent self.
---
jokes on you pkers dont have friends even at lower levels :D 
---
im so lonely
---
Ah, I didn't think about Vorkath. To be honest, I'd love to expand the skilling niche instead, but my ideas are somewhat subpar... Examples included:
---
* Wearing Frigid gloves provides the same effect as using the Protect from Missiles prayer against Lava creatures in the Volcanic mine,
---
* Seriously reduce damage from falling in lava in the Wildnerness agility course,
---
* Absorb part of the damage from the desert heat (or make it less frequent).
---
When your osrs and not runescape player :(
---
People the trick is to stop giving a shit
---
I always right click examine penis
---
what about weapon?
---
Quests and Diaries are the worst part of the game. I'm sure I'll be maxed before I finish all quests if I ever do max
---
Based on the comments the best way to buy a cape is to 
---
1. Never actually attempt the cape yourself (so there is no change is attempt style)
---
2. Fly someone out to your house
---
3. Have them purposely fail multiple times but progress further each attempt?
---
4. Get the cape
---
Does it still work if you switch prayers after the projectile has been fired but before it lands on you?
---
All fun and games until you realize she missed out on a Marble Gargoyle
---
Can I high- or low alch her? Don't care if I don't make profit.
---
every time i see a post about some idiot taking 5+ attempts at jad i wonder how they manage to get through everyday life without forgetting to breathe or accidentally shitting their pants
---
Id buy your first month if i were you, gold is a lot easier to earn in members, youll also be able to do quests like water fall, fight arena, grand tree, tree gnome village to earn some quick combat levels. Members also unlocks achievement diaries which are a good goal to work towards.
---
dont take Konar for tasks that arent multipliers?
---
Private messaging people to harass them still makes you a massive dick
---
its like this till you hit 2k worlds
---
after 2k worlds revs are impossible, but other acitivies are pretty dead, especially if you play in off hours
---
once i got 2k worlds unlocked i started doing sooooo much more wildy content, are there pkers? of course... do i run into a 20 man team? almost never.
---
i just bring a freeze with me and gap them duos i run into once every 5 hours or so
---
THEY ONLY PK PVMERS BECAUSE THEY CANT GET A KILL ON BOUNTY WORLDS
---
Maybe as a minigame (like LMS)? I can't see Jagex willingly giving up thousands of extra memberships because they feel players should be able to experience multiple Pking builds.
---
I also don't think this would really increase the amount of people pking in the wilderness.
---
Idk I‚Äôm at work
---
It's from the same IP. I had 0 attempts at inferno on any of my accounts before I got it.
---
hope you reported him so he gets a mute
---
Probably not. But ya know were on reddit so you never know whos lurking
---
A ghost mouse recorder is literally an auto clicker, there is literally zero logic behind it, a bot has some form of logic, not just clicking in a pattern that was provided to automatically click in. AKA - Auto Clicker.
---
No botter would call this a bot, because its not a bot. Go ask any bot developer what a bot is on OSRS, none of them will be like "Yeah auto clickers are totally bots!", anybody posting that this is a bot is a doofus and just trying to be right about a semantic opinion that is still wrong.
---
More gp in those pickaxes that I've ever had. Lmbo
---
You forgot begging at the ge
---
Wait is this true?
---
Nah it's just once you do it once it isn't nerve-wracking anymore. I am no where near a pro, but I have killed had 20+ times, and triple jads 11 times. That is close to 60 had kills alltogether.
---
Yet I get the same fear in zuk as I used to the first time I did a single Jad. 
---
First time at any encounter is nerve-wracking. After you prove to yourself you can do it, you stop being nervous.
---
Definitely. Don't have the stats to do Vorkath very efficiently and I need some money to rebuild after getting hacked so Zulrah is my best bet
---
I guess it's less EPIC GAMER STATUS and more complete apathy towards anything and everything

Havnt seen the video but did he click on his pray tab? If you select set up quick prayers and then dont click done at the bottom it will stay like that even if you click inventory/other tabs and then go back to prayer
---
Sadly no. Once a projectile has been fired the damage is already done, it's just delayed based on the animation time. Gotta switch before the projectile object is created.
---
&gt; 71 Runecrafting 
---
Yeah no
---
Dead meme.
---
They said they don't do that
---
You could just learn the rotations one at a time and log out when you get one you don't want. It takes a bit but it's definitely faster to learn if you don't mix them up too much
---
yeah i agree with you
---
Shoot messed up the title
---
You want to use melee. Callisto has such stupid high def that most of your damage comes from verac's set special. I've tried diamond bolts and it's pretty miserable
---
Worth 0gp, bound to his account

You mean Lauren's chest?

and i agree, ecumental keys would be a nice addition to the chest. So far all my rewards have been Raw milk or gold rings.

Your phone has aids. Gonna have to put him down. Sorry, ma'am

The thing is Skilling would be worth something if bots weren't constantly doing the resrouce collection
---
Pvm dropping resources is a side effect of this. They'd rather high end game players get the money than bots.
---
\[EDIT\] Talked to him on discord he was pretty chill just happened to be banking when i arrived.  Don't take this post to seriously he was trolling.
---
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA...pheww....ahem.  uh, yeah.  Yeah sure. Let's go with that.

Lol guys calm down it‚Äôs a joke.

Looks dank, congrats!

She really did.
---
Why‚Äôs it look like an FBI file
---
I'm sure he's just joking because rc bad
---
And many attempts take significantly less time because you die early
---
I'm not even entirely sure what RL plus entails. It seems shady to me though and because they already asked Runelite to get rid of that plugin I imagine RL Plus is being scrutinized a bit.

Isn‚Äôt it better to get prima boots if you‚Äôre strictly looking at dps? D boots to prima is a bigger difference in str bonus then obsidian to tass isn‚Äôt it?

Since there are no copper and tin deposits in Minecraft I had to do the Minecraft equivalent, Iron and Coal, also the river bank opening up to the sea really brings out the old Lumbridge landscape.

How is someone going to get your account info by you blocking out your stamina and prayer?
---
I mean... you can 4 way switch zulrah (top, bottom, wep, offhand) and 3 way back into range (top bottom blowpipe) and have far better success than you would in void. 
---
You only cut off 1 switch using void but you sacrifice all of your defense for if you miss a prayer or tank all the snake spawns because you are not standing right.
---
Well now you can play the game!
---
Never too safe.
---
usually like 300m depending on gear. seller perm ban buyer 2 week ban and cape removed

honestly I agree so much. after 2 years in the gym 5 days a week I still am not jacked but that time is like 2 99s or more.

Hey everyone! I just tried to do something very silly!

Yea doing this atm
---
SWAMP MAN GOOD
---
Quick tip you might want to try: If you don't know the rotations yet, just focus on learning one at a time and log out when you get the wrong one. It's way easier to learn them when you don't mix them too much

its hard to know how people get their account stolen when most of these things happen. I wont believe that so many people who have played for +10years suddenly this year start losing their banks, it has been way more common this year than ever before.
---
Its not terrible. It was really hard because the tanks very low level, im thinking karils top and Possibly a dfs or spectral too on the attacker. The tank probably needs 85ish defense, im running 77.

A grind can be fun. Mindlessly clicking, running the same lap 500 times to advance to the next level isn‚Äôt fun. Luckily agility isn‚Äôt the only skill in RuneScape.
---
Oh so he's just never going to change it or Jagex legit bound it to the account and made it unable to be taken? Very interesting.
---
Wouldn't be surprised, don't be surprised.
---
Mate? I'm not your mate. You stupid limey cocksucker
---
yeah those actions are performed server-side every 0.6 sec or so, then your clients needs to recieve confirmation. It's hard to say what exactly might make it less responsive for you at work. Could also be network latency. You could try pinging the servers to compare it with your home connection. The address would be oldschool(worldnumber, subtract 300 so 302 is just 2) dot runescape dot com
---
Awesome! I just added your account, and will message you next time you're online :)
---
It's mostly an integrity reason. Even if the infernal cape really isn't *that* much better than a fire cape it would still look bad on Jagex's part if people literally pay other people to do content for them.
---
If you bought it when it was at its lowest you'd have bought it when it was 20m
---
Why is that? I'm having a lot of fun both with the account, and video editing process. It's all really enjoyable, I don't think it's a waste of time.
---
If I was a pker, and i knew a bunch of people were doing lava dragons on a specific world, I would make sure to go there more often.
---
It's to small to properly click on it.
---
Agreed the violent interaction makes it bareable
---
Well keep on keeping on the good work. If you ever want to port it I‚Äôd love to have it in my switch
---
Well the ban was deserved but at least you learned
---
shut the fuck up serene
---
I liked his back story about being the only survivor of another universe that the gods destroyed with thier petty war, what can I say? ü§∑ he also coincidentally is the god of law and order so it also makes sense to swear to him lmao.
---
Fuck them
---
Yeah my first cape was 115, plus I died a lot on earlier waves so the average is nowhere near 3 lol
---
I make money off these bots when I'm bored. Keeps me engaged in the game. Sorry you're so concerned with jagex pocket book.
---
it was never true to start with
---
lmaooo

It's the wine

Binge drinking, cold weather, and banter
---
That‚Äôs an old game though with a player base that‚Äôs been around the game for a long time isn‚Äôt it?
---
Just to contrast to a newer mmo where exploration is still a part of the fun.  Might have to wait till the next big vr mmo

---
I have a sang staff and poh with pool and can get 5-6 kills per trip. It‚Äôs definitely possible.
---
Come back when you've math'd the chance of it happening within your kc.
---
Not always but it's recommended. Vorkath has 3 levels of fire vs two. So super and prayer or super and shield, or normal with prayer and shield
---
I just want them so Link and Rargh can have even stat PvP challenges again.
---
Really could have used it for Elvarg back then.
---
You still have them as part of the diary. Honestly elite void should probably be an elite reward as it's incredibly powerful, far more so than any other hard diary.
---
First of all, strengthening your password does nothing, no1 can guess your password just like that, just fucking add 1-3 day delay on auth delete, who the fk cares if they lose their phone? ppl have 30 days set up, and if u lose phone, just delete auth and it will be removed, its not like u get permanently locked from your account or some shit, i probably put auth in once in 6 months, idk why it doesn't ask it.
---
Funny enough, I looked up if that worked today. He got three of the healers. The dude in the video still struggled, with Armadyl armor, a blowpipe and fucking dragon darts.
---
That's because he brute forced it by relying on good RNG by using jusiticar armour. That method will takes a lot more, it's like only doing one prayer on Jad and hoping he only uses that attack. Eventually you will succeed.
---
What a clusterfuck of clipping this is. Your legs are clipping through your pants and the chair, with a weird black shadow or something to the left, then there's your arm clipping through the wrong side of the armrest and like 2 purple pixels of your should clipping through your left arm, while the chair clips through the back of your neck...
---
Who QA this?
---
Solos are pretty afk, you almost never get hit at low energy
---
I feel exactly the same.  This... situation here... is just the sour cherry on top of the poop cake.
---
Only if the toaster is newer than 1995 though
---
The key is to do WT on the less popular worlds where there are less people and more people are inclined to just be chillin‚Äô and not causing havoc.

the best way to make agility fun is to stop being a fucking normie who hates RC and Agility cause the fucking hivemind told you to.

Holy shit dude, RIP you.

Btw, kill 2 skeletons and a bloodworm for the easiest reward % optimisation so those useless bolt racks don't take up reward slots in your chest.
---
There's a lot of bots now, but before the bots it was just legit players doing it
---
Before it was big people would leave a bunch of supps just disappear on the ground. Now with looting bag you can pick everything up tho.
---
The fact that it has 0 reqs is why people do it.
---

As someone who's yet to attempt the Inferno but certainly plans to, that graph gives me anxiety for some reason.

Remember AMD &gt; Intel

Show me a vid of you doing a 20 minute fire cape pls
---
&gt; Macros are borderline botting because they require human interaction. 
---
Didn‚Äôt realize you weren‚Äôt trying to have an actual discussion. If you wanna disregard the things you _actually_ say in order to beat off your ego, have fun doing that with someone else. 
---
Macro command: ‚Äúclick at these coordinates‚Äù. 
---
Bot command: ‚Äúinteract with this rock and select the mine option until the ore is depleted.‚Äù
---
See the difference?
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you, and it isn‚Äôt my fault that you think basic topics and vocab amount to ‚Äúbuzz words‚Äù.
---
In my opinion I don't do anything on runescape because it's fun, but rather for the idea of improving the character/ their stats. It's neat being able to feel like you can interact with more things/ earn more money more easily by seeing nice rounded out stats.
---
Like from the very beginning you feel like your character is lacking when you burn some fucking shrimp on tutorial island. "Wow, my character sucks." So throwing in some time to go past the milestones where things don't take so long is neat.
---
Personally for me, combat is boring as fuck. I get it's more engaging if maybe you have like 3 or 4 hours to play a week, but I think of high effort activities in terms of xp/h. Slayer for me just feels like "if I can't cannon/ burst this task I'm in for worse xp rates than rc and am stuck doing it for about an hour or more :) yay."
---
I also just don't consider money made from PvM that worth it. Like I don't mind grinding 500 hours of one activity to make the money for another. So why risk PvM where RNG is allowed to fuck me over repeatedly, I'm spending high energy, and the drops people consider nice are like rune alchables/ ranarr seeds? Like who the fuck cares- it's averaging like 100k an hour which is worse than grinding gp on ftp.
---
Idk. Maybe it's cause I treat runescape like a second monitor game, and I expect the high attention activities to have big payoff.
---
You can get definitely permed for autoclicking first offense so I don't think it's fair to say it was because of the false inferno ban.
---
Strongly suspected, no physical proof.
---
&gt; That feeling of "now I've done this after years of time put into it, but I've gotten nothing back.

if you did that recently you're probably about to cop a 7 day ban

You can learn while being tanky????

Because this name pops up on this sub all the time and every time it‚Äôs on a different account
---
**licking sounds**
---
Another quality suggestion.
---
My opinion matters more because I'm 1739 total with 12 raids under my belt.
---
How can you play since 06? You didnt have to start over in 2013?
---
S
---
Could rock a max hood, 2k ToB/cm Cape, zuk pet. I think that's the max flex you can do so he's not far off.
---
But do you have a firecape?
---
Yes but it makes your mistakes less prevalent because you have a high chance of just not taking damage such as running to south pillars instead of praying correctly.
---
haha what??? It's been on the same account literally every time
---
Better yet, drop a zuk pet on their ass.
---
Lol yeah sending someone a message on Twitter is sooooo messed up compared to faking a terminal disease for money
---
if you have the money go for 90 herblore, but if you don‚Äôt want to then you have to do raids with either mutta or tekt
---
Time that p2p drastically cuts down. F2p is just slow and bad. Also OP got p2p now.
---
Your telling me lol. I had so much progress lost. But it makes sense because there is alot of content that was in rs3 that has never been included in osrs
---
Lmao imagine being so bad at the game you pay someone to fly to your house to play it for you
---
Is that 11$ on the map?
---
Use a cannon whilst slaying
---
This is such a bait lol. People will get triggered from this.
---
I've got over 3,000 hours of playtime with 2 non combat 99s lol, miss me with that 200m all shit
---
I don't understand your point. You asked why anyone would train skills past ~1m xp once they unlocked their Slayer equipment, so I answered your question. They would train it to unlock end game content. You train Slayer from early game to mid game to end game so I would expect that the higher level combat you are, the more end game content you would want to unlock, which would require more skilling. At least I did.
---
But hey, if you want to be 124 combat 70 prayer 99 slayer with 1250 total, that's all you.
---
No it really hasn‚Äôt
---
There are partyhats, but they're essentially worthless cosmetic items that are added in mass to the the game every Christmas.
---
Just started grinding out Wintertodt, I‚Äôm 110 KC with warm gloves and bruma, no pyro pieces, about 50kc was just burning logs the rest fletching to about 750points, have I been unlucky? How often should I expect pieces when getting 750+ points?
---
No. After 28 bars are made, no more ore can be added until you withdraw the bars
---
I believe coal works differently, but you can't add more than 28 out of any kind of ore iirc
---
Just go ahead and start an Ironman now.
---
Amalfi Coast?
---
Yikes
---
How about you join the botting crew? Who honestly has time/ wants to put in days of life when a bit can do it for you?
---
Runecrafting bloods/ wraths on main and ironman/ hcim/ ultimate ironman is always a high profit grind
---
I really hope it never happens to you so you can live in peace your whole life.
---
Huh
---
So for a casual player like me just stick to Konar?
---
Ill never understand why people care so much about 'rare' names...
---
Very pricey tho lol
---
The gp/xp is more than chinning tho lol
---
Nah dude, this guy is a pseudo intellectual getting mad because he thinks I‚Äôm out pseudo intellectual-ing him. Lol
---
The issue is that you can sell the keys by suiciding to the buyer, this would remove the need to get kc/keys which is kinda lame because it's one of the important parts of gwd.
---
Yes, there's a coal limit. If I remember correctly it's 200, and it'll force you to withdraw finished bars/add metal ore before adding anymore coal.
---
Only if we get the real size tassets and chestplate too
---
Y no one make RuneScape mc server???

I‚Äôm not the guy you were responding to. Just saying y‚Äôall arguing over this is childish.

Yeah but it can be taken back at any point be it a week, a month or even a year. 
---
It‚Äôs against the rules plus if you‚Äôre going that route why not bot your own acc? Probably for less money and it‚Äôll be all yours.

Not condoning botting but it‚Äôs overall safer account security wise.

Ya know I decided to beat Jad for the second time last night and I regret ever going back.

You know less than everyone here and you still speak like you're talking to people who know less. You simply don't understand what everyone else is talking about. Please change your tone. 
---
&gt;You are still talking under the presumption that having had a password in the past that's now known means the account is hijackable. That's false.
---
Knowing anything about me at all can get you to discovering my past password(s) which in turn means you can connect it to dozens of database leaks including forums that might have dozens or hundreds of my old posts in them. If you think you can't discover and deduce a ton of relevant recovery information well beyond a single password by looking at a person's online profile(s) potentially spanning years and years and years then it's either because you're a moron or because you haven't looked into the matter at all. 
---
Know someone's email? Find their old password(s). Look up those old password(s). Oh there's some other accounts here, even other emails. Look those up. Read every post on every forum with a leaked database. Search the web for those usernames and get hits on even more forums or websites or databases etc. Every thread you pull on adds to a wealth of information to the profile you're building on them. It's **not** hard. It's fucking easy. And it's the reason there's been an ongoing problem with account recoveries in this game, and it's further exacerbated by Jagex's refusal to put any sort of delay on account access post-recovery--even on an account that has 2FA activated. 
---
yOU caNt rEcoVeR aN aCcOuNt wItH jUsT a sIngLe paSswoRd
---
&gt;Change your password regularly, and then that one known password from when you were 8 doesn't matter at all.
---
You'd have to be an actual bona fide retard to think knowing an account's first password and a few more of the earliest ones becomes meaningless just because you change your password later on.
---
&gt;A shared password from 10+ years ago will not make your account recoverable.
---
Not by someone unknowledgeable, uninformed, and incompetent.
---
Just because you can't put two and two together doesn't mean no one can.
---
Pyro is a little funky but its collective. Also, if you get a bunch of bruma torches and warm gloves like me it's actually not bad. They cap at 3, and once you have three in the bank you will receive alternative loot for them. I can't remember which is which but one converts to magic seeds and the other converts to torstol seeds.
---
I have a shitty hp notebook and it runs great for me

I guess they're the gatekeepers. Once you have the skills necessary to beat the first half, they lend themselves to helping you beat the second half. Even if the second half is mechanically more difficult, you're already better by that point.

Have you tried vork? Initial learning curve isn't too steep and its probably one of the more mobile friendly bosses. With the right filtering on your spellbook and quick prayers, shouldn't be much harder than on pc.

Just safe spot it and use viggoras

Doesn‚Äôt it take 12 hours to max on rs3
---
Lol, not quite.
---
Lance with torags and glory is better than bcp and hasta.
---
Dfs also cheap and needed obv..
---
Also, justiciar is the way to go. +10 pray bonus and you can afk way more than bandos
---
That is legitimately a cool piece of info.
---
I'd recommend paying to have them cut down. It's a negligible amount of money per tree (200 gp). Magic trees in particular are really slow to chop down even with high WC. If you're desperate for cash, chop them down and bank the logs. But if you're doing magic trees I'm assuming you're not desperate for cash.
---
Trees are efficient because of the small amount of time you spend on them for the large xp. If you're chopping down every tree on a tree run, the length of your run will probably double or triple.
---
Indeed

No, because how many events has she been invited personally to historically?

I only travel with one if I need the 200 Death runes... I'm so lonely...
---
What are your stats, and how are you killing them? 6 brother runs are possible at 50's combat or lower, so it's likely you're just using the wrong strategy

I find most Jad guides needlessly long and complicated, clearly trying to get the 10 minute youtube sweetspot.

Facts
---
He was angry last time I said it looked like they were botting. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll comment soon.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a majority of the player base started when those skills were already out, hence ‚Äúold school Runescape‚Äù
---
You make it sound like osrs had a horrible update that absolutely ruined the game.
---
Warding would provide A) a new skill to train, akin to crafting (combat base of range) and smithing (combat base for melee) B) create an item sink for unf pots, materials for new/ reworked mage sets C) make current mage robe sets viable, instead of having 5 robe sets unlocked at 1 benchmark which nobody uses anyway.
---
Personally i hate raids because all it did was add a high level/ end game content that you need high tier gear for and increase items in the game. Yup BIS weapons created but its just getting camped in solo and groups to grind the weapons. Theres no sink to get rid of the weapons, and no common challenge where if you die they get lost. Dungeoneering was a great skill added for all levels, with a high level component and at the time some high tier weapons (untradeable so you couldnt drop that fat stack to buy it yourself) and required you to start with nothing. Raids was a cheap rip off that didnt add nearly the same value.
---
we already have superior antifire potions tho
---
Smithing level?
---
10 mins I like it. Not gonna watch the next 40 tho
---
You should actually be able to mix pie halves too. Always taking the right hand slice first.
---
well theres a part of the minimap that shows more area but its a small portion, so you have to turn it around. but it allows you to check for dots just a little bit further
---
That doesn‚Äôt help but thank you anyway kind stranger
---
&gt;Will it mess with any of my progress on rs3?
---
No. Items, quests, stats etc. are not shared between OSRS and RS3. Only a few things like friend lists are connected.
---
Crystals are 1/128 for a random one anyways, should get 1 each task on average.
---
And always switch back to pray melee after he's done
---
What‚Äôs that
---
Yeah but 95% or more of hijackings are retards getting phished or having insecure emails. Recovering accounts isn't hard, it just takes a lot more time. They need to find the start of the breadcrumbs and hope it leads to a dump.
---
I'd imagine if you've been very active in a friend group/clan the people in there probably have enough information to go off of to start. But maybe you're lucky like I believe I am, there's missing links to whatever information I have out there.
---
I also suggest maybe adding an armour section,if that's possible for you.
---
Chop Chop!
---
Try looking them up on the wiki, if that doesnt help idk what will
---
Questing has definitely become less tedious for me. A lot of people hated the fremenik trials and isles, I don't really see them as a problem. I've also got pretty much all quest pre-reqs for rfd done, sans desert treasure. More than I anything, I really need a way to make money, I can't find much that doesn't bore me out of my mind.
---
Give me a specific example of a major update that wouldve ruined the game legitimately. Not counting an idea used/ proposed in rs3. Not including something that would cause an uproar in the g.e. (items get made irrelevant all the time, sorry if you lost money from it before)
---
I am Groot
---
Bring Kharil's crossbow and racks.  That's how I did it on my zerk

Max hit is best in most situations, accuracy is useful against bosses with high def
---
Ain't are first rodeo" ... There are so many things wrong with this.
---
I played a game of castle wars with a guy named "6" the other day
---
Except they made a cheap version in raids. Summoning would give the much needed item sink/ grind/ purpose to underused items. It also only missed the backup date by a few months if i recall correctly.
---
I brought in Rune darts for Jad alone, but then I switched to mith darts to do the round before and forgot to put the rune darts in so I ended up killing Jad with the mith darts lol.
---
Thats what hes saying, yeah. :p
---
Yeah makes sense, they‚Äôre just more of a passive boost rather than something to specifically grind for
---
Its braindead easy money though. Got myself 3 magic seeds this week
---
No

Riiightt ...

According to your comment history you trained hunter for the first time yesterday, and 70 agility is way to high for the new quest for you... yeah no way you did Inferno, ur full of shit and prolly dont even have firecape
