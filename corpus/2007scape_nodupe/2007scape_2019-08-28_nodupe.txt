I think there's some other stuff wrong with your input, notably piety isn't in for strength. Chain mace should come out pretty significantly on top.

its like wintertold but backwards

Also customary.

Stonks!

You guys are ignorant if you think Bob's were op. People in osrs literally do the same thing by just bringing a alt to the boss with 28 slots full of fresh supplies. It's actually way more efficient than a bob.
---
It's slowly dying. I don't give it more than 5 years, the cash milking has been unreal lately
---
update: I missed selecting Piety on my spreadsheet, please just look at /u/jesse1412 because they actually know what's going on
---
You directly linked another users post. That‚Äôs like the definition of a repost. 
---
But still funny.
---
Nice.
---
Take a moment and reflect on how toxic you're being, my man. You're the side of the comment that people talk about. Talking down to this dude because you seem yourself as better? It's pretty revolting.
---
"People are abusing the fact they can use an alt as a BoB"
---
First time ive tried a crosspost so im probably doing it wrong, sorry
---
The dream would be to get 77 without actually Runecrafting once. Then you can use a leveling system that isn't utter shit.
---
why do you like mtx?
---
Guy saw the entitled parents post where they don‚Äôt watch their children and thinks that a good parent is the extreme opposite instead of someone who‚Äôs balanced.

This is high quality content
---
OSRS is fun, playing on a high total level account is fun too. Though it really gets to me how bad a few of the skills are sometimes.
---
People have lives, and most of us playing are adults now. Who are and where are these people aggressively defending a maximum xp rate that forces hundreds of hours of investment to enjoy the high level perks?
---
The perks of 99 Runecrafting are ludicrously outweighed by the time it takes to get it. I don't even personally know anyone delusional enough to attempt it unless they're actively going for Max cape.
---
They could **DOUBLE** the XP rate with no negative impact on the game or economy.
---
I dont think I was around for that. But it had been going downhill slowly anyway until 2010 when I stopped entirely.
---
Yikes, this post making it easy to spot the fat forever virgins on this sub.
---
No, sorry.
---
Can the process of chiseling limestone into limestone bricks be automated but not as fast as it would be if done manually? Same idea as chiseling dark essence for Arceuus rc.
---
I guess the way to do it would be to slowly buff it over the next 3 years until you can get 1.5x what you get now at most levels.
---
Levels that people get will always be "devalued," but that doesn't mean its a good thing that they do, or that we shouldn't care about stopping stuff from being "devalued" too quickly.
---
Yeah there were certainly other things summons can help with.  I remember as a kid I thought it would be cool to have a pet follow me around and help kill stuff,  just a kind of cool concept.
---
Oh this is what I remember... yeah it sucked. Thank goodness though this game was a crutch on my real world life lol. It's a shame for the game though.
---
It doesn't if you turn it to off instead of hide
---
I had my switch right next to me just now and turns out it does. I didn't realize that until trying it just now, and I've had this thing for about a year
---
Because they'd rather have a 'clean cut' image to suck up to companies instead of putting on an event that's actually fun for viewers and attendees. As a result heavily censor the runners and the chat and are ban happy as hell. 
---
The same attitude also means that Nintendo games are heavily overrepresented which makes the event feel more stale. 
---
If you want a more chill event watch ESA but it's not as hyped
---
You don't see how Minecraft is hundreds of times more popular than osrs?
---
Yeah,  they can keep the more afk methods like souls slower too if they want.
---
They're too creative
---
Dude, pm me, I‚Äôll literally earn 1m in a short time right beside you if you want..I don‚Äôt mind helping you learn some new tricks and stuff, I‚Äôm knowledgeable in getting those stats up to higher tier methods/pvm as well

Right? How is it even runescape if you don‚Äôt get spammed with 15 gold selling messages as soon as you spawn into Lumby.

Ah yes because you have a shit account and a 50m bank you are "forced" to play a certain way. Fuckin jokes lol

There's a lot of stuff going on in that DPS calculator. I use it like every week and I still fuck it up often lol. Always good to get some second eyes. Also I'd recommend just checking out the Oblivion gear discord to everyone so that you don't have to do these calculations for most bosses.
---
But what if, hear me out here. We just paused the quest for like.. a month. Thats all I ask, just one month. And focused that entire month on making PvP something beautiful. And then went back to quests because i love them too. We‚Äôve just been waiting for pvp update for over 2 years..
---
Bruh this is dope as shit. I am toyally looking forward to spaming ü¶Ä in the chat.
---
if "fun" and "slurs" are analogous to you i'm genuinely concerned for you. are you ok?
---
I did rune crafting once.
---
Sounds like a fantastic item and gold sink. We desperately need the former of the two right now.
---
This is hilarious
---
Is joking with your chat while you play a game the same as a slur?
---
I would give anything to play SC again as it was back then. I don't even care if it had no rewards.

Bare minimum for Falador hard is 54, since you can buff it by 2 levels at Dorgeshkaan and use the Arceuus spellbook to teleport to the mind altar

I always forget about how obsessed the RS3 community is with OSRS. Have a browse through the top of all time on their sub haha. It's crazy (and a bit sad) that the majority of the top 10 of all time are about OSRS.
---

---
Could we consider new uses for the dragonbone necklace? One possible solution could be the ability to stack non-protection prayers. An example would be the ability to stack Chivalry and Piety accompanied by a very high prayer drain.
---
Yeah. I'm more worried about DDOSing for items returning tbh. Would love to see some actual risk in this game again though.
---
pretty sure that's not what was said, or what anyone got banned for
---
Yea its pretty sad that most of the big posts now are just about mtx and shitting on jagex/jmods for it
---
Currently on mobile when we have a weapon equiped  it does not show us what attack type we are using on any weapon. Eg. Crush, slash, stab. Can this be changed so we dont have to double check the wiki to make sure we are using the right attack style.
---
I‚Äôm really confused now did rsc not work like that as well? This is a genuine question and what sparked this mess lol

yeah when he kills the mage hand early and melee hand starts healing am I right

You're a truly blessed post-cognitive. Truly epic gamer move.
---
at least you're honest lol.. most people won't admit it
---
Same. I like old school, but it'll never be pre eoc rs, mostly because everyone cries about just about every update, but that's beside the point. I'm just glad that when I canceled my subscription, I was able to specify it was because of a game update.
---
This would be impractical to DDoS because your targets would need to be in a dangerous position, without insurance, making this more of a numbers game. And perhaps on release Jagex gifts everyone 5 uses of Insurance to adjust.
---
+5 prayer would be too much. That would make it tied bis prayer in addition to everything else. I could see +4 prayer if they wanted to push it, but tbh a +3 bonus is already really good for the helm slot. The only thing with more is prossy helm at 4 and mitres at 5. We are just spoiled because nezzy is so common.
---
Looks great! Glad to see some low fantasy gear similar to barrows or historical examples, rather than the high fantasy, extra flashy, unweildly, gear made out of monster body parts we‚Äôve been getting.(even if the helm is made from monster body parts)
---
edit: see stomp, sorry. hear the mage woosh, see the range stomp. those are the easiest ways to react to each fo his attacks.

Hello mods. If possible can you talk about the situation surrounding group ironman.
---
&gt;Don't reply to me again.
---
Does that EVER work?  If this is your catchphrase to bail out of a conversation, try "Im not going to reply to this anymore" or "we're done here".  Makes you sound less petulant.  Then again, Mrs. "Centrists ree", Im fairly certain you get off on being a prat, seeing as any time I see your handle I know it wont be pleasant.
---
\&gt; Again, the JMods CAN be wrong about balance. 
---
\&gt; I'd more quickly say that it's an issue that the inferno is balanced around blowpipe and tbow and that both of those items AND the defense/hp of inferno mobs be nerfed in order to compensate without
---
"look, jmods can be wrong about balance" "well except in this case, I magically know they balanced inferno perfectly around bp, Im totally not saying this b/c I wouldnt be able to do it without one"
---
\&gt; Total non-sequitur. Actually argue the point 
---
The point is that youre full of it. Justish is very limited in what it can do - like all defensive options in osrs, really.  Its why its almost always the play to go for pure dps, because you can reduce damage you take all you want but until the thing thats causing the damage is dead youre mitigating when you could be preventing.  In this case they had the sense to make justiciar good enough that sacrificing dps to bring it to inferno is at least not horrible (though most dont do it).  Go figure, jagex make a single fucking defensive set thats not utter trash and people begin bawling about it.  Also:
---
\&gt;Actually argue the point
---
\&gt;ree dont reply to me
---
pick 1
---
\&gt; I bet you didn't think that was my opinion, did you? 
---
Sir you think that calling someone a centrist is either an insult or a conversation ender.  This and your general behaviour is already enough to demonstrate that your beliefs are a series of poorly founded and likely contradictive caprices that are not worth anyones time to familiarize with.  Ive been fairly on focus with attacking your points and the toxic elitism this thread was created about.
---
They don't come to runescape because of the falador square massacre...

They can‚Äôt even help zezima with this same problem, might want to mentally prepare yourself.

Sorry, hope you get it figured out though.

Because they said ‚Äúwell we spent all this money, so we have to release it‚Äù.

Wiki says there's less than 500 people with the Champion's Cape - is this still true? I almost want to go for it, as it would feel like a satisfying grind, plus the feeling of having something that so few players have obtained would be pretty great.

are you suggesting it should take 56 runecrafting? you absolute monster

I mean only if they are stored, you can die 40x back to back and as long as your time hasn‚Äôt run out you can reclaim them
---
Very nice.
---
Yes, and they also had begun work on about 6 months‚Äô worth of content for after launch (ie. world wakes quest and kalphite king) that they didn‚Äôt want to have to scrap or readjust.
---
***UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH***
---
Real world trading and bottling was rampant. Their solution was to get rid of free trade‚Äîbasically, you could only trade items with others if you were offering *very* similar value. At first, you couldn‚Äôt even give someone 10k. Eventually they gave us ways of increasing our trade limit (still less than 50k, iirc), but it was still awful. We were stuck with that for what, 3 years? 08-11? Something like that. It was a bad time.

Respect. I pk on my f2p account just as much, if not more, as my members one. Addy+maple bows is the meta for all cb brackets excepts for main risk fights (melee in monk robes). 
---
You put yourself at a big disadvantage if you don‚Äôt range because it‚Äôs the only way to stack hits. This would only widen that imbalance. Even if they only gave yew bows I‚Äôd still probably be against it purely for balance reasons.

I mean most scenarios of doing this involve utilising a skill or a special forge (feroc gloves for example). It's not like it'll just be a use on this and done.
---
Secondly, isn't this exact kind of lore building what people were so up in arms in saying Warding should be a thing? Mage robes are hidden behind mystery and lore and NPC wizards knowing how to make them and not us. Wouldn't this be similar? Wouldn't the quest teach us their way of crafting, so that we can do it with our own skill?

Yeah, I was also really high at the time.

So I created an account on mobile using google play originally. Now I'm trying to sign in on my desktop but cant figure out how. It's really irritating me.

If you need to buy bulk items in game try the clan chat "got bulks".

I've purchased over 1M rune dart tips from them.

They do charge a bit extra for the bulk but if you're not willing to wait, its well worth it.
---
In addition to that Runescape is one of the better games to play on a poorer internet connection, and Jagex started offering servers in Australia while many other MMOs your nearest connection would be America

Literally every single one of this kids fucking threads is him acting like a one man justicar telling everyone that he's the banisher of the world's sins.

Eh, people like to talk about the 3 month rule by Ann Shulgin which was to "prevent the loss of magic" there's no real scientific basis to it, but there is definitely reason to keep sufficient time between your rolls.

---
Mega Yikes on this one sir, looks like you have a stalker
---
MDMA is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that also causes large releases of serotonin and norepinephrine, and to a lesser degree dopamine, in the brain. 
---
MDMA partly produces these effects by entering neurons and increasing the release of those neurochemicals (especially 5-HT, aka serotonin) and then also preventing recycling of 5-HT back into neurons.
---
This is what results in the mad, extended rush of happiness that you feel. 
---
However, by releasing large amounts of serotonin, MDMA causes the brain to become significantly depleted of this important neurotransmitter.
---
And it takes time for the brain to essentially 'recharge' and remake all the used up serotonin and store it. The minimum amount of time for the brain to be free of the last effects of MDMA is **5 weeks** at a **bare minimum.** 
---
If you take MDMA *before that* you are **100% damaging** your brain. 
---
I seriously urge you to consider at least taking 5 week breaks between your rolls. I hate to be that guy, but MDMA is not something to take lightly. 
---
Use it safely, smartly, and you can have a great time with no long term negative effects.
---
Not for safe work?
---
They probably see this as a marketing event. There will be a ton of people watching and setting up a private server shouldn't take long to do. This is Jagex we are talking about so I'm also curious how they are going to screw up a private server for one player.

Damn, that sucks. I still feel very in control with LSD and 2C-B, mushrooms take the drivers seat a bit more. I'd recommend anyone who does want to get into psychedelics to do LSD first before trying anything else.
---
EOC was eventually tweaked enough to be decent, and in like 2014ish, while the player amount was smaller, there was a small renaissance. It was the endless prioritization of mtx that killed rs3; I sometime feel like playing it again, then pop onto the sub, see people complaining, and remember why I put it down.
---
I dont think it used to be like that until they polled to have it changed to include the non-crushed empty version of the birds nest (I could be wrong)
---
I agree but it will still have its purpose regardless of the new helm. It's been bis behind the serp forever now, and honestly judging by the looks of it I don't think we'll mind seeing upgrading nezzy helms from here on out.

I meant to say serotonin and not dopamine (been watching too much Swamp, I've edited the other post).

I thought you meant that it wouldn't have an effect on you if you didn't wait, not that it was bad for you. All this shit is bad for you, none of that is news.

My point exactly..
---
Wait, you weren‚Äôt serious huh?
---
If you take MDMA *before that,* chances are you are **damaging** your brain. As time goes on, this damage will grow. It might not even be apparent at first and indeed, the damage will start small. 
---
But it will be damage that is very hard to fix if you keep at it.

It does little to no damage if you wait at least 5 weeks. 
---
If you don't wait at least 5 weeks, it will begin to build up serious amounts of damage over time.

Lol bruh it's not right to imitate the slow learner's.

"casuals" holy fuck xd. You should install some windows in that basement of yours and let people be impressed of others accomplishments.

Because it‚Äôs useful by me not being on 330 since that place sucks aside from the nice houses. I‚Äôm more than happy with my 40mil cost of 83con. I think it‚Äôs more than made up for it‚Äôs cost in the 6 months I‚Äôve had it.  I cba hopping anytime I want to quick tele or boss.

Yeah, why can't I just slay 16 hours a day and have access to all content in the game? Hydra is only 4m/hr slayer needs buffs!
---
2 possibilities
---
1) you actually did jad in that gear to piss those people off
---
2) you set up your inv exactly how itd look if you just did jad to make it convincing
---
Both possibilities are awesome lol
---
Maybe he's doing it because you overreact and fly off the hinges every time. You type up 10000 word essays for every reply and spam 30 messages in a row to him in game. It's fun to troll salty crybabies.
---
They definitely do, people smoke while tripping quite frequently.
---
Bring a pouch, if you get boost, drop stew stuff that's leftover if you brought multiple, empty pouch, drop 1 ess, empty pouch, drop pouch, pickup essence. Full invent.
---
Mobile doesnt matter, depends where you are relative to the servers. If you're not in the US or Europe it can be hard to find ping &lt;300
---
Aren't they going to do bot busting at rune fest? Buy raw material and sit on it.
---
I agree that the rc bad memes are stupid, but there's something to be said for time &gt; money.
---
12k con xp from tears might save you 100k gp, but that's only 5 minutes of money making and like 1 minute of construction. 12k slayer xp is 20 minutes saved for the average semi-afk task, or 20 minutes of semi-afk runecrafting. you can use the spare 14 minutes to make way more than the 100k gp you saved with con.
---
Gratz, now for MM2
---
How long does ToB take to run? Is this better money than Vorkath?
---
I mean it's closer to 1 hour with construction rates. Mahog table at 52 is 800k XP/hr +. So it's done in an hour to 70.
---
And yes it will take like 1-2 hours to gather the gp needed. Still significantly faster than 55 RC ahha.

I guess I should find a RS3 reddit. But I played the shit out of RS2 and would like to get my RS2 account back to pick up on RS3
---
Can we add an option that allows for the runes in the rune pouch to be more easily deposited/swapped from the bank? Currently when a players inventory is full, in order to take runes out of the pouch you have to deposit items or drop them to make space to swap the runes from a players inventory. I think it would be a great quality of life update if players were able to move and swap runes in the rune pouch directly from the bank, instead of tediously opening and closing the bank.

jagex are gatekeeping the cape by not allowing people to let someone else do it for them

I had a "bad trip" once. I took 250ish ug. I couldn't tell what was happening because of me and what wasn't. Like I couldn't differentiate what I was causing/experiencing from other sources. Ex) if I moved my hand I couldn't tell if I made it happen or if something else did. If I heard a sound from outside my window I couldn't tell if I made that noise or something else did. It was super fucked, but didn't seem to last too long.

Currently the only use for the extremely rare slayer heads for (Kurask, Cockatrice, and Baskalisk) is to stuff the heads for PoH. In addition to this can we add a proposed cosmetic upgrade to their respective slayer items. Attached is [concept art](https://imgur.com/a/QCuKtZq)

Yes you are dumb. Get outta here with your oversensitive bullshit. Its the internet.

Question for pvmers: do you do it for the loot, the challenge against another monstee, or for the LULs of killing the helpless? The loot is usually shit (here is the exception), pvming seems to be a very popular thing to do (no challenge), so that leaves me with.... y'all are bored trolls

nope, 600k. cosmics are 150 ea rn and you can craft well over 2k essence per hour with 50+ rc. so that's minimum 4k cosmics an hour, and apparently you can get as high as 4.8k/hr. so let's say you get 4.4k which is 600k + 60k to pay for staminas. glory charges are basically free with enchant dragonstone scrolls.
---
What would you need an alt for in this case anyways?
---
Nice Antonio
---
Thank you skulleddeath
---
Damn, first DK trip but you have Fremenik Elite for noted bones thats some serious preparing.
---
On DMM worlds you can skip the tutorial island by talking to the npc Skippy in the house you start in.
---
ZMI is not what I would call afk. You need to swap interfaces, teleport, empty rune pouches, and bank. Agility is more afk than that

is the gif not playing for anyone else or is it just me

The face guard is basically a slayer task only drop. So yeah more slayer buffs

Its time

I got kicked for asking where to get a duckdo.
---
RC was my favorite skill in 2009, AMA.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was tough to train until a couple years ago when I started playing again.
---
Where's the black graceful venom drawing too :p ?
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of that. Seems like every update has *some* kind of slayer powercreep with it nowadays. Imagine if every update slowly released better and better xp runes for rc...
---
Grats dude, no more getting the jad shakes !
---
What the fuck is AGDQ2020?
---
And yes, I downvoted you
---
Because it's the most favourite skill by majority of the players. They are most likely to pass the polls compared to any other skilling content making the time and effort put into the updates development not being dumped by the community.
---
But they could have changed it when they changed the rest of the drops.
---
Would OSRS players prefer to have RS2 without EoC or OSRS as it is right now?
---
Just ban runelite and all 3rd party clients, dont pick and choose. Its all or none.
---
Not 100M or 1B just a Max cash stack to make it.
---
You are entitled to your wrong opinion &lt;3
---
don't use void then. and not without elite void either. flat accuracy is too good.
---
it's okay that you think that, we can't all be right.
---
no one thinks that though. totally the opposite, anyone who is above even 1500 total is a virgin neet neckbeard according to this sub
---
Are you ironman
---
Every run has a TASbot time that cannot be improved, your comment applies to every game and is frankly very stupid.

They're not fucking splashing now, are they?

instead of sparkles around a smaller bottle, they should just have sparkles out and inside with a same size bottle. the blue cap is a good idea though.

No i‚Äôm not

Increasing you draw distance is op as fuck ah well cheating clients

Maybe polling has to do with that?

Wtf is EOC?

theres a big chunk of that loot im giving away on f2p worlds u dont have to be a member to attend

Wtf is AGDQ2020?

.... You clearly aren't understanding what I am saying. The helmet part (top, NOT the jaw) is still a Neitznot.

What I am saying is, the Basilisk Knight would look better only having the Jaw part and not the helmet part.

Get air conditioning... Duh?

Happy cake day BTW!

Have you seen the optimal quest guide on the wiki? It‚Äôs literally a list of quests that you can just binge in order. Each one will give you the level requirements for the next. There‚Äôs a few that you have to train yourself, like four levels of agility or three of magic or firemaking from 1 to 16, but it doesn‚Äôt take long at all. I started this account last Tuesday, I think? And I‚Äôm sitting at like 70-something quest points. Since you already have 80 combat all the bosses will be easy as fuck. I recommend playing on world 330 so you can just teleport to house and then use someone else‚Äôs portal nexus and jewelry box to get to where you want to be. I pretty much only carry teleport to house runes lol. A dust battlestaff (saves an inventory slot) and laws. I could just make a bunch of my own house tabs if I cared and that would save another slot, but I don‚Äôt find it necessary yet.

I mean we all know this isn't actually why but it's a fair justification at least

found one of them "CheapScythes" dude had infernal max cape l0l luring been paying off for him
---
People also forget that serp can poison, which slightly increases its DPS passives. As long as the max hit ist the same, **serp has higher DPS** against targets not immune to poison, higher tank stats and a poison/venom immunity. It's only downside is the upkeep cost.
---
I do not get the whole REEEEEing about "but it has +1 str on the serp, serp is dead."
---
Those are just glorified cam whores... Not real ASMR.

If you login to your friends account in Europe it might become locked. It may take a few seconds to a few hours to lock. I moved houses 2 counties over (about 45 mins) and my account was locked about 30 minutes after I logged in. I was in the middle of playing Fishing Trawler and the game disconnected me because of suspicion. I don't think you'll get the ban-hammer.. but if you want to risk a d/c in the middle of a Jad fight go ahead.

Don't pvp often. If I'm fighting my target in bounty Hunter world and he were to eat up causing a long pause in his damage to be, can someone else attack me? Let's say he has a friend spec me while he eats and then he specs me. Is that still possible? Sorry almost have no reason to go into bounty Hunter so I'm just curious.
---
Chaps were designed to protect your legs while riding on horseback. Some people wear them now when riding a steel horse.  Your Johnson and crack aren‚Äôt big targets for missiles when seated on either of those.
---
You don‚Äôt ride nothing on RuneScape except minecarts and your RS GF‚Äôs dick, so that extra protection is required.
---
And the price will crash instantly once enough have entered the game. It won't be an issue.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. That's literally the only place to PvP unless there's some massive underground castle wars / clan wars scene. All you said was 'People looking for easy kills don't want a challenge' which isn't a point at all.
---
Most generic loot? What should I see here?
---
You don't need the new quest for the helmet, only to kill the monster for the drop. The drop is tradeable.
---
Legend thanks bro üëçüèª
---
It's unreal how well this fits into OSRS. Mod West is awesome
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying, but why is it NSFW?
---
Still feels like an unnecessary quest so far. They can change everything to make it worth it and actually useful.
---
I had a max combat extreme, but it got banned due to minigame abuse fun times lol
---
You'll only remove items people are willing to bring into the wilderness. But there'll still be 10,000+ Bandos Tassets in game or w/e.

NSFW version when?

Thank you for your account

You're making a claim, so the burden of proof lies with you.

&gt;RC slow
---
I'm currently getting 30k mining exp sortof/sortof-not AFK while at motherlode mine, and just over 40k while mining sandstone.
---
ZMI gives 37k, and lets me look away from the screen for half a minute, and it's consistent unlike MLM. RC is not slow, or at least not as slow as mining.
---
Going out of your way for items.
---
Is this Jagex' proposal for "rUnEsCaPe CaN bE aN EsPoRrT" Deadman Mode 2.0?
---
I don't mean to be a cynic but it has to be mentioned, how does Runescape, an rng dominant game fall into the realm of speedrunning? Look at tutorial island for example; Fishing, woodcutting, firemaking, cooking, cooking again, mining. All rng. As for the next example, champions guild.. 32 quest-points, various skill and item requirements, each quest having its own pre-reqs, bosses to fight.. All again, mostly rng.
---
Imagine a Legends quest speedrun, a quest line with heavy prerequisites (107 qps, 5 rng skills, 13 specific sub-quests with their own pre-reqs, 6 bosses etc). I feel like speedrunning Runescape wouldn't be "speedrunning" by definition, since the majority of a run will be exclusively dictated by rng, completely disregarding a runners skill and/or ability.. Imagine, even after tile by tile, each non-rng skill level &amp; all the preparation &amp; routing has been fine tuned to the millisecond, that still leaves 90%+ of a run down to rng, or take bossing/raids for example, how could 99.9% rng be considered speedrunning, You hit three 40's in a row &amp; took 0 damage, I hit one 0 &amp; get hit a 40 then have to eat to stay alive &amp; sacrifice my next hit while the boss hits me another 40?.. How the fuck does anyone speed run that? Albeit I suppose the routing for any Runescape related speedrun will be fucking sick to watch develop.
---
All that been said though, I'm excited this is happening, it's obviously a good thing for the game's longevity &amp; will provide some niche content for us all, I guess I'm just a little intimidated by the thought of Runescape merging with another community, that from what I've seen is very technical &amp; precise, where the average consumer typically despises rng.
---
Tl:Dr - I feel Runescape is far too rng dependent.

They can both see it as a marketing event and a way to give back to the community at the same time. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

69 69 69 Nice.

I think eoc just couldn't be avoided at that point. The fault happened a long time before - they had insane powercreep, any further upgrades would've made everything gone to shit. Reason why OSRS is taking it very slow.

This is 100% fake. My collection log looks even worse with 250+ chests and no loot besides some bolt racks. This happened because I did all these chests before collection log came out. OP here pretending like he‚Äôs unlucky in the comments for some karma...

They should split it into 2 questions, if you like the stats and if you like the design.
---
you're supposed to kill all the brothers
---
Fair enough my comment was a little harsh, but your reasoning just makes no sense. You're not forced to play in any way, I know multiple people who like to iron man pvp items and certain skills just for fun
---
I am very confused why this got so many down votes.  Regardless of if it was true about rsc bankers I thought you were just making an observation that big crowds are forming fake queues on wow classic.  I dunno good thing karma doesn't count for shit lol
---
Not only that but, requirements for the pc, start up cost, and lack of scripts available right now. Not to mention bot detection is probably better.

My guess is 6 months to a year before bot waves hit WoW?

Any updates on the Chambers of Xeric sign up board "bug"?

Yes, can't hop worlds and then can't even load official client on pc.

Total opposite of my experience

POH should have an armoury thing, where you can place manequins and place armour/weapon sets on them.

Wow, looks very nice, I'd vote yes, if this was polled!

I never tried LSD , but shrooms ain't bad if you never had any other psychedelic before.

Just know what you are getting in to.

Get people to trip with you, that you like, and stay away from people you dislike.

Open your mind and get one with everything.

And apparently shrooms have a more natural felling trip , but I can't say anything about comparing them, since I never took another psychedelic drug and will probably never try any other.

I legit love hunting and think it's such an underrated skill. Relaxing with the natural environments and good soundtrack catching little critters just does it for me. The first 40~50 levels are jam packed with different critters, in different environments, with different mechanics as well. Every 2-3 levels you could be doing something different, unless you *have* to efficiencyscape all the way.
---
But, in the long term, I agree. All skills level 60+ become hours-long grindfests until the next level. Catching 100 chinchompas is enjoyable, but not 100x that.
---
were all ironmen now.
---
Its definitely not *as afk* as a gather like WC or Fish. But i never claimed that. You can now bank stupidly easily with placeholders, withdraw all option, and deposit all. You can empty pouches with shift click, no right click + mouse keys. And you can move to spellbook wit F keys. The rest of the time you are just clicking once and waiting to move, similar to  Zeah (which has active periods in chiselling etc.)
---
Yeah I don't care how much GP you have you'd feel bad about losing 55M.
---
Ahh that‚Äôs fair then
---
What is this about?
---
Holosuite when?
---
yea but you forgot that its runecrafting so it should be 6m.
---
[deleted]
---
4 keys is about double average, same with superiors
---
Probably maple logs or air runes
---
You‚Äôre very wrong. cerb pools are almost instant whilst GG ones have a lengthy warmup so unless you‚Äôre already moving you‚Äôre guaranteed a hit for each pool that spawns near you, and they start at 10 damage, then every tick after it‚Äôs 15 if you‚Äôre on the pool, 7 if you‚Äôre one tile away. Cerb‚Äôs pools also can happen at entirely random times, whilst GG pools always happen at the same time in the fight. 
---
The GG pools are a joke compared to cerb
---
You‚Äôre right. Of course, but think about the items players do bring. Potions, food, ammo, runes. (all of which are used far quicker than in PvM due to how quick fights are(think edgeville pking not deep wildy))  then items that will be quickly lost. DH, rune legs, bezerker helms, coins from b gloves, f cape, avas. Black dhide, msbs, rcbows, dragon tknives, dds, dscim.  Alot of those are alch value and probably will be for awhile.  But with so much of these things leaving the game( mainly supplies) youll see a big impact on the ecconomy assuming we get alot of players to PK.
---
And im sure other items wil leave the game just rarely, like ags‚Äôs or claws, during a double death or something. 
---
Eitherway, Updating PvP is a great way to help repair the ecconomy.
---
It kind of makes me feel smug knowing how badly they fucked up. It‚Äôs sad but imagine 80% of your community turning their back on your game because jamflex were ignorant, arrogant and couldn‚Äôt be told other wise, what they said goes. 
---
Sad company really
---
Please, for the love of Saradomin, explain a lot of random stuff about Runescape like other runners do in their games. It's great to hear about minor things, even if you already knew about them, but it's surprising how much more runners tend to know about the game than even veteran players.
---
Lmao
---
Think he meant 85m alts with 200 rc xp
---
Hsss...
---
Ah, yes. You're right. At least 12m.
---
Got 3rd age kiteshield on my 40th clue, then decided to waste my time doing every clues and I still do.
---
Yeah that'll stop em for a solid day
---
Dont worry it will even out as you keep going :)
---
It makes it kinda tough. I agree with you whole heartidly. As i want to see the old mechanics implimented, but i just dont see it happening. This is the compromise composed by mod ash, and I‚Äôd rather this than what we have now by far.
---
If it was a perfect world youd have a 5 min timer, and at the 2 min mark your items start depspawning one every 15 secconds starting at the lowest ge value and moving up.(so despawns things like supplies first) At 5 mins its all despawned.  This would fix suiciding and add alot more risk, but still isnt old mechanics.
---
It looks great, is thematically consistent with its predecessor AND the rest of the game, and is overall a suitable step forward from the Neitiznot. My only complaint is the weird... nose... thing(?) that is shown from the side-on view. I don't know if it's intended or just a weird bug of the render, but it definitely looks off with it.
---
I don't get it.

I came back in 2016 for osrs. I quit a little bit before eoc as my computer took a shit and died. I just now surpassed my eoc acc in status on osrs and I‚Äôm feelin pretty good, although my eoc stats took me ~5-6 years to obtain I was a kid and was blindly playing the game and still are my most fond memories of the game. Just got my quest cape too! Hopefully they don‚Äôt do something game breaking to osrs.

Nah rshd was the shit ur outta ur mind.

Also you have to understand, rune crafting is perfectly fine post 77, it's just before that it needs some love.

Hunter really ain't that bad anymore with all the ways they added to train it. Birdhouses and herbiboar especially make it quite nice.  
---
If you go for the classic salamanders or chins the exp/hour is also very good.

Mining can go suck a dick though.

If you don't have your attack options hidden, you might accidentally attack one of their friends who logs in under, say, a web you might attempt to slash with your dds equipped

Only if the defensive stats lower by putting it up, cause you're more exposed

If you imbue the slayer helm, you'll get +3 magic and range attack bonus.

Reguires 99 runecrafting
---
Thing is tho, with how slow and tedious runecrafting is. Why the fuck do you get so little xp for each rune as well?
---
second rune crossbow? whats special about that
---
The guy made an implication saying you can‚Äôt get into pking which is simply not true. I said it is true. The problem is most of the player base is drop out Stoners who quit anything in life at the first sign of adversity. They can‚Äôt take the heat and that‚Äôs why Ironman mode exists
---
he's prob referring to maxing as a waste of time
---
Ahhh right. I play a lot but I usually grind skills haha I don't often venture around
---
It is much more efficient to get the best weapons you can and use void(besides void mage it‚Äôs poop)instead of focusing on armor.so get dhcb, lance, shit like that, when I was new I used a ring of suffering to help me survive but brimstone ring is bis now so use that. Instead of void mage use ahrims with a boot switch or a off hand switch. If you need a picture of my void setup pm me
---
3 now
---
Fuck can't we just have some harder slower skills like RC and some easier? I LIKE the variety and mixture. Lol let's just add wintertodt for every skill.

contact the billing support team. I stopped playing but forgot to cancel my membership, and I logged a ticket and they refunded me like 4 months of game time as they can see that I hadn't accessed my account during that time.
---
How about at the Blast Furnace, instead of using ores you can sub in a metal item forged from the ore?
---
oh fuck I so hope this gets in!
---
that is ultra depressing
---
People have crunched the math, even if you got every single item exactly on drop rate it would still take like 200 years to get everything.

You flexin with your kitchen or wtf is this?

I'd like to see gravestones make a comeback. Can't remember exactly how they worked but it was something like you upgraded your gravestone for extra time to retrieve your stuff. A friend could also bless your gravestone to double that time. They started at like 2 mins, topped out about 30 (1 hour if blessed)
---
You could say that about any game that you invest as much time into as runescape. There's a small learning curve then you master it, then it seems easy because you do it repetitively. Very few videogames hold a challenge if you invest mmo-time into them
---
would not be even if i didnt.
---
That's a good thing
---
Runescape gold is worth only half what it was worth last year, It's not stable. You can't compare wows economy to runescape, items works different, once you equip them you can't sell them. Wow also got a client sided anti-cheat that works very well and there are barely any bots in that game.
---
Scale the penance on the death value.
---
It ok
---
glad they did, 2011 was already what, T90 items?
---
No.  The meta for F2P pking is to literally not wear armor so that people actually can die.  Defence pots are not needed.  This is why polling shouldn't exist hahahaha
---
lmao stay mad
---
I guess that depends on what you consider to be a lot of money? Steam runes are 45m profit doing them to 99...if that's not good enough then you can do bloods 77-99 and make 150m at the expense of your xp rate. Or you can do souls/ZMI and get rates/profits in-between the two. There are a lot of options.
---
This is great lol
---
Ra raaaa Rasputin, lover of the russian queen..

I recently maxed and went back to get a head for the imbue, I‚Äôm at like 110kc without it lol
---
i would take a blowpipe since im tomorrow 75 range.
---
'07 and earlier were kinda shitty tho, release osrs didn't even have gwd
---
IMO the toughest part of JAD is prayer swaps when the healers arrive.
---
The easiest way to do this part is to swap from blowpipe to red chins (you only need about 30) when the healers arrive and keep attacking jad with chins. The healers will aggro you and you swap back to blowpipe. 
---
Even if there are 2 healers still on jad you can out dps them with blowpipe and addy darts.
---
know
---
now replace the Mic :)
---
You can kill the mager without aggroing the ranger while melee is respawning. I'm at that point right now on my iron.
---
I hate how things people care about get internet points

That makes sense. Unfortunately any post on a right leaning sub wouldve discounted their opinion in the minds of peoppe like that commentator

Dont worry, I see colours fine but 2 and 4 looks so damn close that I‚Äôd confuse them at quick glance

Could just make first membership cost 1$, and just track everyone who uses same payment address for many different accounts
---
Lol it's only 160k xp
---
Often new players are recommended to go for barrows gloves. This is achieved from the recipe for disaster quest. It means you'll gain a lot of levels and quest completions whilst going for some of the best gloves in the game.
---
Other than that what I did when restarting was to set myself mini goals. For example my first one was the dragon scimitar from monkey madness, then I got 85 slayer to get my own whip. Recently I got every item from barrows for the fun of it.
---
Burgh de Rott Ramble
---
But gives an attack bonus while up since you can see clearer
---
Master quests are ones like swan song, mid 60s skill reqs are pretty appropriate i think
---
FYI you cant get the pet before completing Western Elites
---
Afterwards, the pet is 1/500 per pluck and kill, so it shouldn't take more than 1-2 hours or 300-600 chompy kills

yeah but I saw it log out so and there was no target so I still dont understand otherwise your telling me there is a flaw in the rs logout system that causes players to lose their shit on purpose the entire reason or a logout button is to logout and be safe also if wat your saying is true no one could get away from a pker
---
Yeah but the game has progressed way beyond losing a couple mill on death. Imagine going about your usual routine grinding slayer, and suddenly losing 2/3 of your bank value you've put months+ into because of a server d/c or your isp or power going out for a moment. 
---
I agree that we need more item sinks, but people that say the 2 minute timer is a good idea generally don't consider that it's just as likely to make someone quit than go back to grinding another few weeks just to get back to where they were.
---
FFA chambers sounds great until you go 150 raids without a drop in your name.
---
You don't kill boss monsters for bones and ashes, you ok them for a 1/2000 chance for a good drop
---
GE over-bids get cut.
---
Say I list an item for 2k. Someone buys it by posting their buy order at 3k. Currently, I get the full 3k for an item I would have been fine getting 2k for. Under the new system, the buyer would still spend 3k, but I would only get 2.5k for it. Buyer is in the same place, I am still better off than anticipated, and 500gp is removed from the game. Of course, exact percentages can be adjusted as needed for balancing.

Sniper take the shot!!

not even kidding i deironed in 2016 and quit rs because i didnt want to runecraft since all the diaries are gated behind it

Long story short, he needs a rune crossbow to do Theatre of Blood, his only way of getting one is through Lucky Implings, that he had to grind to 99 hunter to get, which drop them at a 1% rate.
---
not really expecting one just knew the title would inspire reactions and attention
---
Same thing. Got the trial and I've already paid for 2 months.

haven't played in over a month, just here to shit on trash players with zero standards

just need more untradables that you have to pay an NPC to craft
---
There will be basilisk knights sorta like demonics for black demons I'm guessing
---
Fuck the basilisk jaw drop (esp if you have to get a task for a better chance). Just give it to us as a quest reward. Such a stupid design choice.

Tekking temple
---

---
It's not prioritizing the examine option, there are just too many items on the ground that you can't see it all.
---
i lost full bandos to the pk portal bug where if you followed someone and they sat down and walked thorugh you you would get pushed through the barrier
---
So long as you do everything manually, no.
---
Is that confirmed? Maybe it's not actually 1% people have been wrong about drop rates all the time.
---
I question how low-level of a boss it will be if it is locked behind a Master Quest with 50+ Reqs. I wouldn't be opposed to an earlier level boss, but also not sure if it needs a boss when it is already getting a stronger variant.
---
why not just make the patch have a different color if it's had compost added to it?
---
He just needed to one up you by telling you ye works 20 hours at the subway across the street between class
---
It doesn't have 6 str though
---
Just melee gear and dragonfire protection probably. They are signifigantly weaker then normal dragons.
---
Do the Bask knights even have a higher slayer level requirement? I think they should be 70+ or something.
---
An item overlay would do loooot of good for mobile too
---
How do i bot exploit the trials?
---
If you die again your shit is still there, what are you talking about idiot.  Not only that 1 hour is far to fucking long. There is 0 risk.
---
yeah i wish if they would focus more on questing in osrs rather than "repeatable" content like they said, questing is one of the major reasons i even play this game over other mmo's
---
I just dropped 4m in the GE overnight and it had bought when I woke up. I don‚Äôt trust the tracker.
---
its not hard, just awful
---
Yawn. Yada yada yada yada 3rd party clients are cheating yada yada yada ez scape yada yada yada
---
Yea, some plugins are op like the demonic gorilla plugin. The truth is that the OG client sucks though. Loot tracker, xp tracker, and many other should of been in the game by now anyways. Just saves jagex the time of making it now is the only downside
---
Jagex has always had this model when it came to bots. It's the same reason bots arnt instantly banned off tutorial island for having weird names and shit.
---
They'd rather take their time and make sure it's a bot than ban a new player(which would make them quit)
---
I would be tbh
---
Rarest item if you tried to obtain it yourself would probably be jar of darkness. Rarest item based on number in the game is probably something obscure like a smuggled quest item.
---
What would you want on them? Got a design in mind?
---
Just to have the chance to get a second one when I get a slayer task. They also drop an alchs and I enjoy doing it in the pit
---
Whats this job called and whats the salary, Im intrigued.
---
Well, the way lucky Implings work is that they give you one roll at a clue scroll reward table, from beginner to master, with each type being equally likely of being selected. So he need to first get a roll on the elite clue table, 1/6, the he needs to roll the 1/32.3 to get the rune crossbow. These numbers were confirmed by Mod Tide.
---

---
This was me playing sekiro. Spent like 4 or 5 hours on the final boss to get the first kill, one-shot it on my second playthrough with hardly any damage taken.
---
Sounds like Slayer.
---
They could also have it require a phone number or something other than email 
---
The main issue is the bot makers have been able to automate the process by spoofing email addresses (basically using 1 email to look like 100s of different emails). The trial itself is good, but the way it's set up isn't so much.
---
haha spades
---
I agree with this but maybe add a superior version of the knights (assuming they aren‚Äôt like demonics).
---
Oof you're probably leagues ahead of me;;;
---
Nieve and konar at the same time
---
Just set ur respawn in falador :)
---
if it's the classic that i remember, you quested for the xp but there weren't enough quests to level up, so you ended up grinding mobs for hours.. yeah so much fun.
---
Jagex flags 7 day trial/Twitch prime accounts; ban rates are higher for those accounts. They've obviously done the math and have determined that the minor impact a couple thousand suicide bots that survive less than a day have on the economy is outweighed by the actual new players that the membership trials bring to the game. Otherwise, why would they do things like release Twitch prime promos when the Sir Pugger emblem farm was running?
---
I'm against it. Not only do I love the current graphics, I don't trust these devs not to screw it up...

I should of reworded this better and said "respectable" over achievement. I don't mean to take away from anyone who achieves the cape. I don't care if you sat in discord and a friend helped you, if you used full justiciar, etc. If you got the cape you got the cape and that, as you said, is the achievement. 
---
I don't mean to say that those who got it in what could be called "an easy" way are not respectable. I respect the shit out of anyone who grinds and learns inferno. If you told me you did it with full Justiciar, good job! Same with normal gear. If you told me you did it on a pure with a RCB well fuck me that's really impressive! 
---
My point I guess is no one should be put down because of how they did it. Justiciar, no pillar, pure, "normal", etc. They are all achievements. Some are more impressive than others but less impressive does not make it unimpressive.
---
This was long winded. I'm not the greatest at explaining my self. Thanks for your opinion and insight in to the situation though! Conversation is always nice.

My quitting moment was when they made squeel of fortune spins buyable. Seeing youtubers begging for money for spins so they could maintain their ranks just killed the game for me. Quit the day after that update and left the game for 6 years before coming to OSRS.
---
Are you surprised? The qna is questions hand picked by the jmods themselves. They very rarely do anything controversial, and if they do they try to brush it off as fast as possible
---
when membership cost/account was brought up with wow classic coming up they kind of just got offended and said "well we don't sell xp so ha!"
---
I mean it's really not that hard to figure out. They're focusing on bringing new players in, and that's not really what most current players want to hear, so they're not gunna say it on a Livestream meant for current players.

I recommend knocking out 50 attack, strength and defense first. Jump right in and upgrade to full on granite unit status with full granite, granite gloves, boots and a longsword.
---
That's where his kingdom initially was. It would make sense
---
yea it makes up for the next 3 times i try this and get popped lol
---
I‚Äôm not super efficient but I‚Äôm definitely not inefficient. I have full regular void, torso, defender barrows gloves, mory hard diary are some notable achievements. Also 75 slayer and 75-80 combats and 200 QP. I‚Äôd just rather spend my time questing doing slayer, clues than skilling.
---
Checking with Hans I‚Äôve spent 20 days 8 hours playing, but that‚Äôs from 4000+ days ago so i don‚Äôt know if it took into account the time I spent back in the day since I‚Äôm using my OG RS username
---
Lol no
---
Lookin good my dude! I suggest setting a P2P goal such as barrows gloves or Fire cape once you're in members. Otherwise, just have fun. :)
---
I see. Then why is everyone still complaining?
---
I have almost enough for 2 bonds, but haven‚Äôt looked a whole lot into it, was thinking about just smashing out some of my skills first, and just getting a feel for the p2p game. Wasn‚Äôt too keen to spend real money, but might be the way to go at first?
---
Poggers
---
I was always in awe of the guys running around in full rune. I dreamed of being such a boss one day.
---
&gt;  But why should something that is multiple magnitudes easier than the gauntlet even have a chance? 
---
Same reason why Kraken, Zulrah, KBD, Giant Mole, Barrows, Chaos fanatic and other piss easy bosses drop clues. Clue scrolls aren't as game breaking as you're making it out to be.
---
Getting the task from duradel is very common actually. Also not sure if anyone mentioned this, but better chance of a pet too
---
Hero
---
not a fan of your word choice,  but whatevs  ill still smash
---
Nice ill do this sometime as well, thank you.
---
Also who tf clicks the ground.
---
Also also, just another reason why i lure my own knight. Fucking hate being around people
---
Thanks man, i‚Äôll definitely look into them, having fun just grinding out skill levels, but would be good to have some stuff to do in between. :)
---
I'll vote for it
---
So why is it like this? Is it somebody's pump and dump scheme?
---
That's kind of the point, it costs time to run and time to learn mechanics. It rewards skill. Zalcano doesn't really, it's brain-dead easy.
---
First time, I would keep the gp for sure.
---
that is considerably slower, def worth bringing locator
---
I think they don't even spawn
---
bruh all 99
---
Nice have had some of those fights myself
---
378 is the unofficial ardy Knight world... do with that information as you please boys
---
They did that to counter RWT and admitted after it was a mistake
---
Im not really in support of making afk, world manipulation, borderline cheating training methods even easier. 
---
Just the same as people bringing cats to kill rats splashers are on, deal with it.
---
Tear down the West Ardougne wall and let the forces of Zamorak take over
---
This devalues my free play air rune only uim with 99 runecrafting.
---
They used to be untradeable, but people kept hoarding them in DMM as a way to safely bank GP. Shortly after that they polled the change.
---
Dragon Slayer 3
---
Yeah, The Fremmenik Exiles, it's a new master level quest that's gonna be polled on friday.
---
Seems weird emphasising settled when the post is about Verf, while not saying anything about why Verf is hunting them
---
Thanks, I'm not even a massive questing fan! I don't mind them but my focus is just maxing out all skills.
---
When is this supposed to go down?
---
I hear you, but we also have sheep shearer and cooks assistant, and wow has very long quest chains full of interesting stuff. The defias line, for example, is all in classic, and accessible very early. 
---
It's funny though, back in the day RS was what I played when I didn't have the money to play WoW. Now that I'm older and can afford to play either, or even both, I feel more like playing and paying for RS. Nowadays I much prefer the sandbox style to the theme park style. I got everything I wanted out of WoW in legion.
---
Yeah I just got back into it a few weeks ago cause of it
---
Maybe
---
Yeah, you are not wrong, did a lot of Tiara‚Äôs though, so wasn‚Äôt as bad as it could have been. 
---
Is granite only in p2p? Cause that sounds like a good idea. I‚Äôm more of a scimitar person, any reason you say long sword?
---
just flatpack &amp; alch lmao
---
Having a gamer moment, are we?
---
99 slayer
---
It requires 77 rc
---
soon my guy :) maybe not on f2p tho
---
Would pay big money for this
---
Aful and slu1 make playing my alts tolerable
---
How do you check the playtime?
---
Hmm, will keep that in mind, thanks for the tip. :)
---
Or just pay the 50k for the instance :)
---
If you didn't do the entire fight caves with no items and 1 prayer point then you didn't earn your fire cape, nice ppot cape noob
---
Ah I feel it. I have no idea how PvP works, I‚Äôve just heard that some decently high folks will get stalked essentially cause they usually have lots of loot. Was just curious :)
---
Yeah no one cares about how this will affect ur snowflake acc
---
WoW's questing still hasn't really changed, they've just added on a few more repetitive meaningless actions you can do.
---
it is also pretty useless tho, this helm will be BiS
---
Slayer needs more content pre 75.
---
&gt;&gt;  But why should something that is multiple magnitudes easier than the gauntlet even have a chance? 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Same reason why Kraken, Zulrah, KBD, Giant Mole, Barrows, Chaos fanatic and other piss easy bosses drop clues. Clue scrolls aren't as game breaking as you're making it out to be.
---
All of those involve gear and time investment with various degrees of risk.  Yes, elite clues aren't game breaking, but they shouldn't be added to drop tables that are accessed through something as easy as Zalcano. You wouldn't add a clue drop to Wintertodt, would you?
---
That's probably the case as it's easier on the servers. I would still be very interested to explore the mems areas in the f2p worlds
---
Doesnt really make sense plus ur art is aids to the eyes
---
&gt; People act like the internet wasn‚Äôt a thing 15 years ago.
---
Runecape is an MMORPG.
---
Doubt it. He accepts donations but doesn't seem too common. His house is my favorite by far and the short name is icing. I try and tip him a herb when I'm there for dead patches.
---
I'll buy her for 25gp. This is over double the going rate right now.
---
Is it the hardest or funnest or something? I‚Äôm clearly out of the loop here, why does everybody say that?
---
Support. There is so much emphasis on new when there is plenty of old content that should just be rebalanced imo
---
I only do herb runs so that all I have 8
---
Your comment is aids to the brain.
---
I love collectable gaming stickers. Maybe skill logos or higher tier items?
---
What do you mean? I simply *must* have placeholders for every single type of potion, in every dosage! Same for jewelry! That's like half your bank gone already.
---
Jagex said a long time ago we're at the limit for bank slots. You have trash in there, get rid of it
---
Thanks for the continued criticism. Always trying to better my art.
---
No it does not say that. Private unlisted world with certain permissions, sure. An offline client handed to them on a flash drive? lol no
---
There is certain data that has to be communicated through Jagex's servers, such as combat calculations, which is why it couldn't be an offline private client. This is also why (unofficial) private servers are a little janky. They don't have access to the information and calculations that are on Jagex's servers. They only have access to what is stored client-side. The same goes with third-party clients. They can only decipher information that is stored client-side, which is not everything.
---
I feel the same RNG, I have 300kc with 4 shards &amp; 1 tail, 100 left on task.
---
That doesn't make sense with the rest of the context. If it is a Fremennik, then why would we kill them? Why would it be an alternative to a Basilisk TasK? Those alternatives only exist when the creature is still the same thing. Why would a Fremennik drop a jaw bone to attach to the Helmet?
---
Im in this post and I don't like it
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt the quest is p2p you ape
---
Ok, interesting.  
---
So a poll to implement something like runespan would pass?
---
Nah he is just a moody bastard
---
Yup; it is hard to find a req that would do anything. But that is why the question came up on the Q&amp;A.
---
Just like someone else said, herbs are not how you level farming. It's mainly to make money. If you actually want to enjoy farming, it's the fruit trees, hardwood trees, and eventually calquat trees that make it really gratifying.   
---
Nowadays, I just check my hardwood trees every 3 days and get a solid 45k exp drop, which feels great to get. Before, everytime I did a fruit tree run, I would level up my farming level and it felt so easy.   
---
Adding tree runs make it even faster, but wouldn't recommend cause it's so expensive.
---
Grats
---
But also cba
---
you can start using the locator as you use up bones with no ticks lost, so more than 5 seconds
---
Why not make the jaw degradable similar to the whip and tentacle, would keep cost up and act as a gold sink
---
Right. This is an extreme example, but is the nuclear option that has literally already happened in rs history lol.
---
when i got my ornate jewelry box and alched/sold all my now unnecessary jewelry i felt about 50 slots lighter
---
I mean sure you‚Äôre gunna have good and bad months. I had 4 claws in 1000kc in about 2 months. Slayer is great money for myself. Raids are the same. Some months you might get lucky and some not. I prefer doing raids with my friends than slaying by myself. If you aren‚Äôt enjoying it then don‚Äôt do it.
---
I have a rune scrimmy, was just using the sword for Elvarg, thanks for the tip. though. Would definitely like to start an iron man one day!
---
TBH, I'd even be fine with taking a D SQ to the Legend Guild master to show you restored the shield (they've only had half of it) and he teaches you how you merge it with an Anti-Dragon Shield and gives a throwaway lore line explaining why only Dragon Shield can be imbued with Anti-Dragon Shields and not other shields like a Rune Sq.
---
Tbh idk how to even make flatpacks lol
---
I would recommend training Str, Atk, then def in that order in case you are doing shared xp attacks and got all to 40 at the same time. 
---
For instance, you should get 50 Str, then 50 Atk, then 50 Def, if you want to continue on the path that you're on.
---
Yeah scouting is annoying tbh. Random finds like this make it so much better.
---
Gargoyle alt? What's your slayer level?
---
This seems like a great idea. Or just require a valid credit card but not charge them. That's what I see a lot of other free trials do
---
I'm actually looking forward to the slug menace line being completed. I've been wondering when that'd be proposed, for years.
---
Definitely agree with a lot of points the others made in this thread.  
---
Also keep in mind that it is still locked behind a bunch of tedious, long quests. While those quests don't have the highest requirements, you know how the rs community feels about questing as a whole. This goes for PvMers especially from my experience.
---
So serp will still be a viable option for lots of players as it is readily available at a reasonble cost.
---
Ah, a keyboard warrior. It's nice to meet you.
---
I‚Äôm learning with a couple of friends if you‚Äôre willing to try it out with us.

If you do decide to join us just send me a message on here or reply for my ign
---
79 so i could do wyverns, gargs, brutal blacks, kurasks idk
---
The gp per hour at CoX banks on the fact you are seeing a tbow split on the average drop rate. If you dont see a tbow split, cox is shit money compared to slayer and vork/zulrah. Solos are decent money if you do themm efficiently and scaled raids are often better gp hr than trios.
---
Small indy company?
---
Oh FUCK. What are you doing here? XD
---
Seeing how it takes likes 5 seconds to kill yourself with zammy wine, no it‚Äôd be exactly 5 seconds lost. 
---
0 seconds with locator orb
---
5 seconds with zammy wine
---
Considering each inv takes a min or two to complete you are saving maybe 1% of your time, and losing an inv slot
---
mhm right :))))))
---
How come when I open Twitter links on reddit is fun, 90% of the time it won‚Äôt load. Hitting ‚Äútry again‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work
---
The average drop rate for 150 kc in trios is 15 splits, and 5 in your name. Im going to just assume you arent that unlucky but rather full of shit
---
I think their art looks nice. It's a nice change from those god awful comics and fetish pieces that always seem to be on the front page.
---
w2 ge my friend
---
Slew is the ‚Äúsimple past‚Äù and slain is the ‚Äúpast participle‚Äù. 
---
‚ÄúHe has slain the snek‚Äù vs ‚ÄúHe slew the snek‚Äù 
---
Past participles have ‚Äúauxiliary verbs‚Äù such as ‚Äúhave‚Äù or ‚Äúhas‚Äù. 
---
He did misspell snake though. Idk how you missed pointing that out.
---
If you‚Äôre miserable playing this game at any point then stop doing it. You‚Äôre paying $11 a month and if you‚Äôre going to let your entire happiness be ruined by some guy giving away free hats to people then you need to reevaluate your life and get off of the internet. Your misery will get no company here.
---
Any reason why Strength before Attack? Read somewhere that XP share is slower, so definitely wont being doing it that way. Will keep in mind, but always thought accuracy was more important that hit total?
---
have you tried talking to oziach?
---
What do you mean? Ya can't, I was implying it's more than just the spell that's being blocked lol but you quoted what ya wanted.
---
yeah cause they assume 40k points/person an hour. efficient raids is over double that.
---
Yer I get the sentiment but all those temple trekks for 85 Slayer is sweaty enough, come on aha
---
nobody should do clues for mone, for something else ok
---
Private servers have been kicking for years and I cant imagine it's to expensive to maintain classic if they dont intended to update it.
---
It'll last past a year but I doubt it wont have a lot of players. It'll hit the same wall osrs. The metagame is figured out, all raid bosses will die the day resist/tranq shot reqs are met. Only thing left is pvp which is typically unattractive for most players in my experience.
---
Then they release BC as an optional progression server and get all the subs back.
---
Keep in mind I am your resident idiot for OSRS, but I've been told that with higher STR, the higher damage you deal and thus more XP. 
---
I suppose to summarize, hitting consistent 1-2's is not as good as hitting a 7-8 every few ticks. The stuff you should be training on when you get members shouldn't have a high def (such as sand crabs).
---
Because then youre maxed combat like me with 70-75 slayer lmao I‚Äôm grinding slay now. At least im 95 range and mage so I‚Äôm ranging and bursting / barraging all of my tasks, great exp. Quests level you up nicely so do them and they guide u on what skills you‚Äôll need so do them before maxing,l. I did legends yesterday lol... not the biggest fan of questing but makes it easier on the grind Imo.
---
Sorry to all the people dry on barrows.
---
u/th3rentboy do not listen this. A chargeback will get your account locked. If you search bond or missing bond the support site you should be able to submit a ticket for it. Support frequently handles these kinds of issues.
---
You can use like willow bow and bronze arrows and it‚Äôll still be a breeze, doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
1. Mouse jitter won't prevent your account from timing out since the game requires some sort of input such as a mouse click or keypress to prevent logging.
---
2. Not sure about a discord but most people just ask at the G.E. for bypassing the limit but expect a little extra gold compared to what they paid since you're also using up their G.E. limit.
---
Honestly kinda smart if you ask me, you can use them for deeper wildy stuff.
---
Items didn't have a ge price before the GE. This scam wouldn't work without the GE.
---
u are the chosen one
---
Amethyst arrows exist, easy afk mining xp.
---
The regular client just needs to be runelite.
---
This. Its also good to note, that olm is where you get a lot of your points. If you cant do olm without dying, it is 100% worth suiciding.
---
I need to start watching the Q&amp;A streams more lol
---
Not really. OSRS has been updated way passed what is was in 2007. I didn't come back in until around 2- 3 years after. And really just enjoy the UIM game mode. I'm not saying WoW Classic isn't a hallmark of gaming history, and a huge point in MMO history. But compared to what we have now, it's just nothing at all. It's a month of filler content to get to raids.
---
Dude if you tag a post with a spoiler tag, don't spoil in the actual title itself, ty
---
Still not sure I'd ever get 99
---
Nar got 2 hunter thought but maxed melee and 99WC lmao
---
I recommend buying membership rather than bonds, you're in no position to maintain membership with gp with those stats, plus you'll need all the gold you have to begin training members skills and getting new gear/quest items
---
Spam pickup and drop is the only solution till they patch this so it's still a useful idea.
---
Never said I was going to find all implings alone. This is a personal challenge, I am not trying to impress anyone by catching lucky implings for 5 years. I still stay on Karamja only and I pay people for helping, no one cares about it except a few people trying to find something to complain about
---
you will be replaced

Daily farm runs and afk mage @ nmz

i didnt tag it
---
I've only got the lowest tier of jewelry box, but I still keep dueling rings and games necklaces in my bank just for fun. Also I only ever have a stack of max charge jewely, and then 1 spot for the non-fully charged. The placeholders handle it when it changes
---
Pro tip from a BTW here, get a looting bag and put all your useless TT rewards or firelighters etc. in the bag to free up 28 bank spots
---
You look kool
---
Runelite isn't coming for mobile unfortunately
---
Take a long hard look at yourself and your choices.
---
Chaos alter has a 50% chance of not using the bones, and the same multiplier. However, unless carrying all your bones noted and un-noting them there, which is a big risk, you get much lower exp/hr. If money isn't an object, it makes sense that not using the faster gilded alter is exp waste.
---
Yup
---
suggested that 1-2years ago and they told it looks to much like private server lol
---
Answering a question with another question is not a valid answer. since both of you dont know that i already realized what kind of people need this.
---
LOL!!
---
Looting bag is pretty normal for most ironmen that start running out of space. Less applicable for mains because you can just buy/sell shit you don't need at the moment
---
In rs3 we actually have "cooks assistant 2" that is not RFD, it's name is chef's assistant
---
Excuse me, "random girl on twitter..."
---
Meanwhile voids doesnt work against chompiesü§£
---
You can decant potions in the GE with the herbs guy on the southwest and decant enchanted jewellery with the runes guy in the south east. Just right click and hit decant. :)
---
Love how you're not trashing rs3. &lt;3
---
You can right click "use" on the certificate halves on another player to exchange them. They drop on the ground or go right into their inventory.
---
Mouse moving on the game client does seem to count as game input.
---
I stayed logged in on Runelite for a bit over 10 Minutes by hovering mouse on the client when I was about to log out.
---
yet it happened and also not possible to leak with the authenticator
---
I left my melee maxed and near ranged/magic maxed rs3 account to go back to OSRS. entirely worth it in my opinion. worst part is starting back from scratch trying get that gp again. otherwise it seems to be a way more enjoyable experience.
---
Use Certificate Half on partner
---
Always love your vids
---
Hope you get 'em all this easily!
---
Shut up u whiny bitch
---
I think this would pass. Lore-friendly and no dev time to implement.
---
Get membership and do waterfall immediately. Then buy a super antifire and do dragonslayer. Really you should do all of them before members but it's not a big deal. You can finish them faster in members because of jewlery teles and tele tabs.
---
sit down child before your ip gets rekt
---
Great content!
---
Thank you! I am also doing the hunt without the Falador Hard Shield as I am relatively low-leveled still and can't finish the diary. I don't mind the grind though since the claws/skin are a good source of money for my CB level. Good luck to you too with the pet drop :-)

People in general are toxic af

Which funnily enough is considered the best skill by many.

Hey brother, not to be a pita, but I'd recommend getting base 60 in combat stats and base 50 in all non combat except rc
---
Didn‚Äôt realize they were so cheap.
---
*Why can I sell cowhides for only 1 gp*
---
Do ourania. At least it's semi afk and xp is better/comparable

People would just have a alt they trade all their high end items on when they wanna go pk, literally no point in this. Shit idea

Wheres 2-15?
---
Full killer clown outfit so jad dies of a heart attack
---
I remember using these when they originally came out back in the day but stopped shortly after. Do they have any benefit aside from the small heal or is it just dead content?

This is what they call a forced meme

Sources please.

Is he selling an ‚Äúaccount guide‚Äù for $800?
---
I think you need a mith grapple for that one
---
Disturbing behavior is bannable.
---
It‚Äôs the most dreaded not-fun skill in the game and it will always remain so because the people who already suffered through it want everyone else to feel their pain
---
You stupid? we had 40 people logged out waiting for a fight to go down. At that exact time we were doing the smart thing and not sending the whole cavalry for one retard. We used ample amount of force to make him leave. If he didn't then I'd of called more people.
---
The 2k rev worlds do not have 0 people in them. It temporarily had 0 people for 10 minutes while we stayed logged out in the lobby. Beyond that, we're here idling with 40+ people nearly 24/7.
---
So you're stupid and no it's not pathetic. If the worlds have 0 people on them then I dare you to come walk through and find out how quickly we smoke you. That kid hasn't come back either because he knows his 10 minutes of seeing nobody was an illusion that simply doesn't exist. 
---
All these salty pvmers teleport in 2 seconds and then think they're a fucking god for getting away and spamming L0WL0L0EL00L0L0L0L HAHAHA U COIULDNT KILL ME 0L0L0L 0L 0L0L0L 0L
---
We weren't trying to kill him. Could we of? yes very fucking easily just have one tber run in first instead of a bolter. We weren't that focused on killing him for those 10 minutes.
---
You kids need to get this through your head. If nobody was here, nobody would pay us. If you had enough brain cells you'd figure out that something's probably aloft with your theory of nobody being there ....
---
Like it's actually baffling to me how idiots can think there's nobody there lol. We've been idling here 40 deep 23+ hours a day for over a year now but because some idiot came through and didn't see anyone for 10 minutes ONE time that means it's empty ? Please just come look for yourself. I'll send the whole army for your dumb ass and you can cry about how we needed 50 people to kill you in lumb lmao
---
Yeah those poor boys in grey do need more bank slots.

Microtransactions incoming? /s

yes

I'd also like to add that the mods that do the Q&amp;A don't even get payed for their time spend being on the Q&amp;A. They really like doing it and it really shows. We really appreciate.

Awesome

Then downvote and move on like a functional adult instead of coming to comment section to whine about it like a little bitch.
---
I guess it should be pronounced Will D but I can't be bothered to change how I say it after 15 years lmao.
---
This is cool man, what a great addition! Good job!
---
Me everytime I buy anything. It always crashes. I finally decided to make my alt member and do wildy slayer, using the emblems to cover the cannoning cost. Then they rolled out the tier10 emblem update. These are not the superpowers I wished for.
---
You shouldn't do str to 99 before att, but every 10 or 5 levels you can go back to it. Personally I'm on the road to 60 str before 50 att because fuck it.
---
You get higher DPS with higher max hits sooner than you get higher DPS with higher accuracy.

Not sure what you mean?

Don't choke then

Any shortcut that has an ability requirement isn't accessible on f2p worlds. There are fences you can vault but they aren't technically agility shortcuts.

Im not having any problems getting to jad, I just panick at jad and end up getting one shot.

absolute troll, can't get Jad as a slayer task without defeating him once before. also you cropped right above kill counter in chat box. You're not even trying buddy.
---
I once posted on runescape story forums a short called The Curse of Zaros. It was kinda popular and I think can still be found on some website by someone who claimed to have wrote it. Never finished it though.. (my thief tried to make more chapters but you can totally tell it's not the same writer)

wil dee is the only way to say it

no shit, but when it's where the nose is it doesn't matter, the shit looks too pointy.

Plus you don't have to worry about 75% of your money going to rent/ food/ kids/ insurance/ taxes and other things required just to be alive

That's better than cleaning herbs at least

"Videogamey"? Why do people add the letter Y to make an adjective. And Yes, I play OSRS for quests and immersion.

Mod Reaches legacy must be preserved

I used to say why-uhl-dee when I was 12, but its definitely will-dee.
---
I 100% quested in ESO (1000+ individual non-daily quests) over the course of 4 years playtime.  A majority of the base-game quests are variations of the same thing- go to a town, town is in trouble due to problem, fix it by killing some mobs.  
---
But about 25% of the quests are much deeper- unique storylines with characters you end up caring about.  Best questing experience out of any game I've played.
---
*all of the osrs teams updates in the last 3 years
---
FTFY
---
Not to mention how obscenely immersive Azeroth is, vanilla or not. I played RuneScape before firing up WoW for the first time at the beginning of TBC... my mind was absolutely fucking BLOWN. What a transition.
---
It's the easiest way to get Addy and rune ore or they're just going for 99 MLM is great for training. That's just my guess.
---
There's that, but actually getting the +5 is really frustrating, so you make the choice between quick-ish frustration or slow and dead inside
---
Not to mention that god d'hide boots are better for him than holy sandals. There are still upgrades for him to get
---
Are you using sounds or animations to distinguish attacks
---
It's short for wilderness, so will dee. If you don't agree,  you are objectively wrong
---
Oh god, this game have a lot of toxic players. Good luck for your life with that attitude.
---
Well, thats the risk vs rewards aspect. You could be safer, and get less kills per hour, or you could be a DPS machine and more kills per hour, but risk losing your items or gold.

Take a look at places where defence is useful. Mainly the inferno, DK‚Äôs and gwd(when not in a team)  all three of those have one thing in common; a time sink.  It takes time to get to those places. (With inferno the time is spent completing waves)  if you die, or have to leave early then you are punished with the inconvenience of having to waste time to go back and get your items or fail the inferno or whatever.
---
Now, apply the sentiment that if you die, like at those other pvm places where defence is useful, that you will be much more than minorly inconvenienced. You can start to see why tankier gear would be useful, especially for learners, or people who simply arent super rich.
---
And your right. Some people might not go back to that defence and keep using BiS meta. If they die? Then items leave the game. If they use tankier set up, less items enter the game. Its a win win in either scenario compared to tons of items entering and none leaving.
---
And on my own suggestion, the two minuite timer would only affect the main game. Instances like zulrah or vorkath would remain how they currently are, though I do think they should have a flat 100k fee for every instance.
---
I suppose you‚Äôre right about pking, though im sure losing items does have to do with the sentement. Or atleast the threat of it. ‚ÄòGod i hate pkers, I cant bring BiS gear here because they will make me lose it‚Äô  quite honestly its probably a mix of item loss, threat of item loss, and the compedative nature of people. Its hard to escape another player but easy to escape an npc boss, yah feel?
---
Yeah and how are you gonna stick with only 1? I have multiple dueling, blue necks, and fossil island necks of every charge level
---
why tho
---
Christ. I have a vivid memory of me typing Taste Jodd! Without knowing what it was. Saw it in a Sparc Mac video thought it was cool. I‚Äôm cringing
---
I type "Here bitchy bitchies!"
---
They changed it a while ago to allow for them to demo the new updates before it is released. Helps them kill time in the QandAs as a lot of the questions they were getting were getting stale
---
God damn, if it helps I used to call chaos runes chay-oss runes
---
Im not a fan of questing, but I highly recommend you knock out a few fairly easy P2P Quests that will make your life tons easier.
---
Tree Gnome Stronghold and Fairy tale Pt2 Unlock genuinely invaluable ways to navigate the map, they will save you tens of hours of running in the long term.
---
Achievment Diaries are the same. Medium Diary tasks offer pretty great rewards, especially the Ardougne and Lumbridge Rewards. Good mid term goals to aim for.
---
You have a prime account to really dig into a fair bit of content whilst you level even more. Just grind out some combat and aim for the 60's to really get things going.
---
Have fun my dude!
---
&gt;but they will need to update and progress the same way OSRS to keep a standard player base.
---
like say... expansions? it seems pretty likely that they'll rerelease tbc and wotlk for classic wow down the line as long as it remains popular and that'd be enough to keep people around for a long time. 
---
also I think you're underestimating how much there is to do in wow. especially when you include alts. I could never really give a shit about having an alt in runescape but in wow you get a completely different experience when you make an alt and play a different class.
---
Oh you've got to be shitting me, I can't get it until I complete the elite?
---
Don't vote in osrs polls :)
---
I did it just to complete dragon slayer and for nostalgia. Was fun but the crafting grind just to get a ruby ammy was enough for me lol
---
Oh my bad i thought it was like 65 con..
---
You blind m8??
---
My account is a 2150 total iron and I still have like 30 slots left with tons of shit I could get rid of
---
That‚Äôs what all Max variants do
---
yo wtf you got that all in one chest?!    im running as fast as my i possibly can to that graveyard right now!
---
... Do you know how probability works?
---
What‚Äôs footknights?
---
i suggest completing all F2P quests. it will give you a nice start to your P2P experiences.
---
There are service that do it. The exchange rates change over time but it‚Äôs usually something around 3gp=1 old school gp. I‚Äôve never fucked with it myself so make sure you do your research and find a clan chat with a good reputation.
---
I wish they would just make that whole area a safe zone. Not like there is legit Pking going on there.
---
Sounds that make vibration thru back of ur skull or down your spine, that make u sleepy and relaxed. Not all sounds have the same effects thats why there are many vids out there on youtube to magnetic balls, bubble wrap, ear licking, slime etc
---
thanks guys
---
Can I get a wow from the almighty buttholes?
---
*get a load of this guy*
---
Just kill boars
---
No, I think the time is best spent in f2p leveling these skills to base 50s and combat 60s, it opens a world of content to the player with mini games, quests, and helps skills like fletching, Slayer, etc..., But keep in mind, this is just an opinion.
---
Don't get triggered because you had the wrong idea about something and I put you in your place lmfao. You tried to call me pathetic for making people pay when there's nobody there but there is. Not my fault you got shut down for being a nimbus. Also not my fault you're too braindead to figure out we could kill him easily but weren't trying to.
---
You commented first. You're the one who's salty all I did was reply and debunk you.
---
Don't care if there's better money out there. For iron men it isn't about the money. &amp; contrary to popular belief welcome to the clan world. It's not unusual for clans to have 40-100+ memberlists that pk for long hours of the day. Why don't you go back to your beloved raids and do the same boss over and over lol must be a good time. Freak.
---
I am interested in TOB learners. I am an ironman, but I have all the gear and stats needed.
---
Just got my first cape recently and I was so nervous getting up to Jad the first three attempts. I highly recommend watching a "Jad Practice" video to practice the prayer flicks. I would occasionally reference it when I'd have a monster safe spotted when going through the waves and it really helped me get prepared for the real thing.
---
Yep, you need Elite for it
---
my experience is i have loads of random stuff in my bank I would almost never use incase I need it for a  quest
---
...why would there be more than one grandmaster quest a year. 
---
Also why would you need tactics or armor to do a puzzle 
---
Also also why would you say the puzzle was half the quest, that quest was enormous and the puzzle itself was not even a quarter of the content.
---
bro some times i legit just sit in my house and sip on that shit.    and if my boy calls and wants to chill at like blue dragons  ill fill up a Styrofoam cup and just sip on it.
---
Woodcutting for profit
---
Top notch content, thanks for uploading this.
---
30 slots is like just enough for one more big update.
---
God fucking damn it. At least I didn't go too far over. Thanks for the info =)
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä Jagex is powerless against the DDoS ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Op knows what he is doing
---
WoW
---
I recognize him tbh, I ran into an issue with him before about "reporting me"  
---
(I'm dutch  also, just like this guy lol)  
---
honestly, don't worry about it. Its a false report, you're unharmed.  
---
he just wnts some attention or something, idk whats going in his tiny little mind
---
A simple rule to add to this is:'After a prayer switch do only one action at a time'. 
---
OP you can do it
---
I'd just be careful about it. They haven't made any statements confirming any sort of expansion. And sure, you can make alts, but if there is never any expansion on it, it's really just a raid grind.  
---
I don't mind or care either way, but I just think people like to forget all the shit blizzard does to fuck things up.
---
I'd argue that the gimmick quests are even worse than the "kill 5 wolves" quests. Like who the fuck gets on an mmorpg with a somewhat medieval fantasy theme to shoot some monsters with a turret.
---
with Jad, not dying is victory.
---
My key to beating it was camp pray mage, and only switch when you see him stomp his feet down (to range) then immediately swap back to mage, repeat.
---
After you get in the rhythm, hit one healer, then go right back to your prayers tab (Don‚Äôt even click jad again, let auto retaliate do the work for you)
---
If you aren‚Äôt already, use your F-Keys. I have my inventory on F1 and Prayers on F3 so I can swap back and forth quickly.
---
Tl;dr, don‚Äôt worry about anything, even eating, until you‚Äôre in the rhythm, then do ONE action after every successful switch.
---
They haven't changed anything. Either you're doing something wrong or thought something was a safespot that isn't.
---
This Suks

---
Hard for me to read these threads as a person who played a shit load of both games back in the day and since then
---
almost none of you have a clue wtf youre actually talking about lmao
---
and i don't say that to cast aspersions but seriously its like people are talking about starting zone quests and not understanding that quests in wow are more segmented
---
in truth though, the games are quite different and i doubt many of you were 60 in vanilla or above 1750 back in the day (probably not the biggest accomplishment but as a kid this was huge for me and probably others)
---
it pains me to read misinformed arguments about both games.
---
This is pretty sweet
---
some of the paid bots are gas tbh
---
Ardy knights with a foot pedal
---
I did the quest for a friend last week. Its lije family crest but opop
---
How did you grey out in real time sections of the map?
---
Its funny that you talk about WoW classic the same way people talked about OSRS. Vanilla WoW is still better than most MMOs today, the only reason itll die in a year is because Activi$ion-^^^^blizzard is a horrible company that lost touch with the community years ago.
---
Props for actually updating
---
So I use my house to switch to normals so I can tele to my house?
---
Real talk, lore wise, why can‚Äôt I just dip a vial into my pool and take that shit with me.
---
You can be dedicated and not have 69 slayer or 60 hunter, it‚Äôs called doing something other than watching movies or learning how to tie nooses.
---
Make sure you bought an old school bond and not a runescape bond. I did the same thing.
---
Seeing Gielinor in the 2nd or 3rd age would absolutely nuts.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL_BTmrrZW8&amp;t=2s
---
&gt; And you are incredibly dense if you think that the some of the individuals who work on OSRS don't actually enjoy their work.
---
They don't make the decisions for the company. 
---
&gt; Oh, they work for the company so they don't give a shit," is just dumb. It's obvious that Mod Ash, Mod Ghost, Mod MMK, and most of the rest of the team care about the actual game, not just their pay checks. Hell let's not forgot when Mod Ash paid Woox out of his own pocket.
---
Not what I said but thanks for the strawman fallacy. I said the company does not care. Mod Ash is not Jagex. Mod Ash WORKS for Jagex. He does what the Jagex pays him to do.
---
&gt; With a game like WoW classic, there probably will never be an individual team. Maybe if they decide to do new expansions or revamp others. No reason to attack anyone because you don't feel the need to read. I literally said money is the only reason COMPANIES do something. But fortunately they don't control the passion of their employees.
---
Oh boy, more strawman. You also don't know how Blizzard operates internally because that's not something they publicly reveal. Everything you're saying is conjecture. I'd advise you to actually read what I say before responding again.
---
Used to think like that until I tore 2 ligaments working and now would have been fucked if not for those systems cause I was just starting to live on my own again. Now I'm back on my feet working my ass off once again paying back into it.
---
Not that I dont agree with any of your points, the more you earn the more they take is true and pretty shitty. I still think everyone should help themselves when they are fit to do so but basics like healthcare are things worth taxing for imo. Bullshit that the govt likes to waste money on the other hand? Not so much...
---
Quite a few of the top hunters are just hunting imps to help out. They haven't accepted any prizes.
---
I have a lot of friends i see regularly but still play osrs in my free time, it's not mutually exclusive.
---
It's going live tomorrow??? I thought they were ages away from releasing it on live?
---
lol cope
---
A girlfriend who plays RS.. you lucky sob
---
Lul
---
Well there‚Äôs your problem, you already have like super high money making capabilities. And already have high combat level
---
Can you even log in
---
Only top tier nerds play with profanity filter on.
---
That's what having a construction cape is for.
---
There was another video released a month or so ago I thought. I think it‚Äôs just a for fun thing and he doesn‚Äôt do it full time.
---
Plus it must take long as fuck to get two hours of content in a single video
---
in the 3nd, 3rd, 4th screenshots its all to and from the same person
---
Wont even get you half way.
---
You do, but like others have said MLM is very afk, and blast mine is very click intense
---
Its still ~20% chance that he does not have a rcb. Most people hunting for Settled are well aware that he could already have it, but just enjoy hunting for him. Plus he's added 40m bounties to other items that would be good for him to use in ToB.
---
They were both with my clan so ofc I split them. I think he means the people who go 400 dry of a purple would ignore me lol
---
Wait what? He kills stuff from quests?
---
You use your house to switch to lunars whenever you need lunars.
---
Idk dude I think he would be better off just hoping in and getting quests done he would be able to get 60 attack faster through quests and get good unlocks. Lots of easier money making opportunities In members worlds.
---
The magic bath keeps it moving so it works, its effect disappears in a glass vial.
---
He pays 1b to the first one to find the impling. He doesn't need two rcbs, just like Verf didn't pay extra to the person that found this one.
---
all of the max cape variants are just cosmetic upgrades to other capes
---
Yep, you can use that, or follow (tho has to be a person a fair bit closer to you so that you don't get caught halfway) or use RuneLites GPU plugin and click most of the way to the altar and then click altar once in reach.
---
I feel like giving my 2 cents and to put things into perspective, I‚Äôve played RS on and off since before RS2 was even a thing and WoW on and off since Vanilla (2005-ish). Haven‚Äôt played either constantly, but played through every major iteration. 
---
You‚Äôre comparing apples and oranges. WoW and OSRS are both MMORPGs. That‚Äôs where the comparison ends. Outside of pretty niche things like goldmaking and RPing (and, to some extent, pet battling), all of WoW is centered around combat. ALL of it, be that leveling, PvP or max-level stuff. There‚Äôre no such things as WC, FM, Farming, Agility where you pretty much just run around and chill. 
---
That means on the one hand you have to enjoy the combat aspect. That means on the other hand the combat system in WoW is a lot more intricate than in OSRS. Whether you enjoy one thing or the other, up to you, but while prayer-flicking and switching combat styles mid-fight is definitely a skill in and of itself (and trust me, I‚Äôm not trying to shit on high-end PvE‚Äôers), it doesn‚Äôt come close to the intricacy of having 12 different classes with three different specializations each, four different roles and having to manage either a 5-man group or a 20-man one. Which one is harder? I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care ‚Äî that‚Äôs not the point. 
---
Having said that, I understand your complaint. If you‚Äôre used to the questing system in OSRS and come in to WoW expecting that, you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed. No doubt about it. But you don‚Äôt play WoW for the quests, they‚Äôre just a means to an end
---
Dark age of Camelot had great quests. Also had a Barrows dungeon too which was actually scary as fuck.
---
go back and forth between this npc and space bar the boring dialogue is way more boring than go and kill XYZ NPC in WoW.
---
quests are the worst thing about runescape.
---
I followed the wiki I linked above. 
---
Basically, [spirit 1 and 3](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/3/3f/Summer_elementals_bouncing_at_the_same_time.png?1824f) are on a cycle that drift with each back-and-forth (one's walk distance is father than the other). The only way to successfully make the one click run is if both spirits hit the walls at the same time as shown in the picture. If one spirit hits the wall just before the other, they are de-synced. You can fix this by getting caught by the first spirit. This will delay it one step and set it back on the correct cycle.
---
The rest of the spirits are very likely to not be in sync with spirits 1 and 3. To fix this, you wait for the pre-determined set up and run as if you were going to complete the maze. You are very likely to be caught by one of the other spirits because it isn't synced up yet. Each time you get caught by a spirit, it delays their walk cycle by one step. Eventually, getting caught enough by all the spirits in the maze will sync them up with 1 and 3. At this point, the maze is one click solvable.
---
Should you get caught by misclicking or mistiming the run, repeat the above steps to re-sync everyone. Purely because getting caught once ruins the set-up and requires multiple minutes to fix, I highly recommend running on an empty world with no one else to ruin the sync.
---
I hear what you're saying and I still stand by my suggestion. Rather than calling you a thick skull, I'd ask you to re-read the suggestion with this in mind: no one is forced to risk their banked items, don't skull in the wilderness and you don't risk anything more than you had before. If you disagree with the risk being too high, then that is your opinion but that does not make my suggestion dumb as shit. If your only rebuttal to this is that PvMers are forced to skull to get great loot at revenants then my response is stop complaining about PvP updates to wilderness if revenants are so awesome that you‚Äôre ‚Äúforced‚Äù to skull. The revenant skull vs non-skull drop rate is idiotic and ripe for clan abuse much like emblem farming.
---
The current state of wilderness is pitiful compared to its glory days prior to removal and 2010-2011. Some of this is never coming back because the playerbase is not composed of kids running around aimlessly. But the rest is due to player behavior which can be addressed. PKers would much rather kill PvMers because other PKers don't risk anything of value besides an occasional spade among the sea of salad robes.
---
Then you get the endless cycle of PvMers voting ‚Äúno‚Äù to every single PvP poll because they don‚Äôt want to lose slayer helms, d boots and precious spades to salad-robe-toting excuses for a PKer. Then the PKers scream ‚Äúnerf d hide! Nerf bulwark!‚Äù and the cycle continues. Most of the ones screaming for a PvP update only really want an easy way to make money by killing other players without risking anything. Ever see the max mages in deep wildy? They almost always have a clan to defend their sorry ass from dying because why should they actually have to risk something if they run into someone better than them?
---
Runecraft is slowly getting to 77, 400k xp left.
---
So lucky but good shit.
---
What we really need is team cape max capes for every version.
---
&gt; T bow replaces blowpipe, sanguin replaces trident. Neitz faceguard replaces serp. Simples. 
---
You're really *really* obtuse if you don't recognize how obviously different the faceguard is from the tbow and sang staff.
---
Yes, please, buy all 1b each
---
You don‚Äôt think you could run and get your gear within 5 minuites?  Not only that, I almost NEVER dc. Infact i dc‚Äôd for the first time in 3 years on friday. And I didnt even die. Its just such a lazy excuse anymore. infact im willing to bet that only about 1-2% of deaths are from dc‚Äôs.
---
Or even split it up into something like a "Vault" for your POH. It would make sense to have two "banks" - one legit one and one stash at your house.
---
You could even put it behind a long quest a la Recipe for Disaster as another important mid-game account goal. I think it would be cool to build towards unlocking your second bank alongside working towards Barrows Gloves, both are really big upgrades that lead you through tons of early content and help start to open up some of the mid-late game content.
---
Obviously he wouldn't pay more than one bounty, but if he's no longer offering the rcbow bounty, he shouldn't advertise it.
---
Thing is, if he wants to keep it a secret he managed to get one, then he can't drop the offer. I honestly didn't thoroughly read the discord rules, so if he specifies only the first one gets the bounty and all others might be ineligible without previous warning, then that's fine. But if he keeps advertising the 1b bounty and didn't make that remark, then he would be offering more than he plans to pay. People would expect the scout fee plus the chance of the bounty, and only be eligible for the fee.
---
Get my point?
---
I‚Äôm about 100 chests in and have only managed a Verac‚Äôs Brassard. Good for you man!
---
You forgot the bragging about it in game and admitting to being attracted to 14 year olds all in the span of like 3 hours
---
Konar is better profit
---
Just did one of these, used about 200 amethyst arrows
---
Dude I have such an issue with this. I've already cleared my bank with the Wise Old Man, but I'm stupid and i legit still have a huge stack of like random seeds , random armor sets like mithril and bronze , just stupid shit. What traumatizes me is I've literally sold "junk" from my bank , only to come across a quest or something else that requires the item. I have 780/808 bank slots filled right now. I cry every time i open my bank, but i need to set a pin finally and get a few more slots at least
---
quests in runescape are probably some of the best ive seen in any game as they are not just silly kill or fetch quests but an actual adventure
---
This. Time to unironically delete non-bis max capes. It‚Äôs time.
---
Gotcha.
---
If you don't skull, you don't risk anything at all from your bank. The idea is to make it more enticing to attack other skulled player as opposed to picking on skillers/PvMers which keeps the community divided and voting down any PvP updates.
---
Just make your desktop something that relates to having a normal and attractive girlfriend or healthy social life. "Me trying to explain what it's like to not be an RS mod"
---
*prerequisite
---
Requires 99 Runecrafting*
---
 I'm a chick, just a loserish one
---
People like you need to fuck off to /r/runescape
---
You‚Äôll be regretting that statement
---
Not really. Mass reports can trigger the system and auto mute you.
---
Got muted for saying ‚Äúfuck warding‚Äù several times the day it failed. I guess according to this subs reaction that day however, that is ‚Äòtruly vile‚Äô lmao.
---
I feel this on a personal level, mostly because the sense of accomplishment I get out of life isn't from work but through video games, so I half ass life but then put that effort into video games. It makes me feel good but real life doesn't exactly work that way, huh? :(
---
They have 2 years of updates already planned with raids and battlegrounds. They also have 50x the player base of osrs, so even if the game "dies" it will still have been a huge success for at least the planned 2 years.
---
Woodcutting then.
---
One of the more unique osrs content guys. Always get a good laugh from the vids. Keep it up 25BH
---
Would you mind linking it for me? I was looking to see if they had actually announced and planned anything.
---
I know I got 25% confused with 25k I already said it was my bad. Lmao everyone‚Äôs so tight over this.
---
For sure dude
---
just sucks they refuse to add good rewards to something that actually takes skill in this game so its gonna die so fast
---
&gt; The +1 strength difference won't equate to a max hit in most scenarios, and it's weaker in defense. Where on earth do you think this becomes "bis" all over the place?
---
Because of your previously stated advantages. Magic def, prayer, and no penalty to range/mage, plus it being cheaper.
---
Right now, serp is still often better than neitz because of the extra max hit and the defense. If you now make the max hits equal, with neitznot even being better with some setups, a patch up neitznot's defenses with +4/+5 all around, it would probably push neitznot over the edge in most scenarios.
---
Am I the only cunt who fucking despises RS quests? Tedious bullshit.
---
I mean, the sparkles aren't great, bit it is gets kinda difficult to differentiate potions once each color has so many unique effects. It's just the fact they have to work with a static 2d picture rather than something more telling. maybe a godray shining on the bottle or some other surrounding effect would better fit the name scheme and differentiate from holy water. The main problem is definitely the size though.
---
The discord constantly reminds people that it‚Äôs possible that the 1b bounty isn‚Äôt available. I‚Äôd wager to say that almost everyone there is hunting imps to help the series. People just enjoy searching. There‚Äôs even one guy there that bonded 16 accounts and hasn‚Äôt accepted any bounties. Everyone hunting is completely ok with the 1b having possibly been claimed.
---
I don‚Äôt want to seem like a dick but it sounds like you just checked out the discord and left. And that‚Äôs ok because people who are really only in it for the money generally don‚Äôt stick around long. Lots of people go days before even finding one lucky impling. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult.
---
Runescape is literally the only game I play where I'm terrible at managing my money because I always end up buying dumb shit or doing things inefficiently
---
You‚Äôre mom will regret having you.
---
That is such a bad argument.
---
I'm a pvmer/skiller. Level 100 at that so i always get attacked because people think im dumb enough to carry anything of value into the wild. But I like the way it is in the wild. Wouldnt wanna change a thing aside from the amount of bots I see. The only change to PvP I would like to see is an item to help boost defense or attack against large amounts of people when you're alone to help prevent clans from gangbanging solo people.
