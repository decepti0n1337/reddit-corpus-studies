I got an "impersonating Jagex staff" one for talking about "the RS police" which was a clan.

u dont get a perm ban for buying gold :p

Its just as much an achievement as getting your first rune gear. It depends on the person. Some people dont play as much or arnt as hardcore and the little things matter more to them. Some people may just really love the pet.
---
J1mmy with that good content!

i dont think its possible to buy more right hands

The client pages measure how many people have the client open, not necessarily how many are logged in like the OSRS page.

Duradel is still the best Master. Konar is for players who don't care about XP at all and are too low level for the profitable tasks like Gargoyles, Nechryaels, etc.
---
You can go loot steel platebodies in the wilderness and alch them while hopping worlds or you can grab them and sell them if you don't have the necessary stats.
---

---
You can also collect sapphires in the spider spawn in level 46 as they're about 400gp each.
---
Agreed. But I still don't have one :&lt;

I would love to see an inverse Wilderness below Menaphos and Sophanem: the more south you go, the higher the Wilderness level, and the more dangerous threats appear. It could have a lot of hidden, treasure-seeking content for players to discover.
---
But but, its the victims fault, not Jagex failing to keep up in the arms race! /s
---
Timing is a bit diferent depending on the distance so be careful not to rely on the same timimg for flicks
---
Imagine not being able to put the game down for 10 minutes while you clean yourself once a day
---
duradel is better xp/hr
---
konar is more variety and gp/hr
---
Well you dont have to have it full screen
---
Did I say that it did? 
---
You sure you're an adult? Because you have the emotional intelligence of a 12 year old.
---
Konar is more for Money and Points and Duradel is for Xp. 
---
If you want Xp faster and money is no problem them do duradel
---
if your an ironman and money is hard to come by then do Konar
---
Yo real talk why can‚Äôt we set our own keybinds for things like prayer, run, inventory, etc? Would make QOL a hell of a lot easier if I could set my own keybinds to navigate everything better.
---
Does being easy mean something can't be an achievement? Compared to other pets, Skotos is fairly easy to get, but you can also say compared to Dragon Slayer 2, Dragon Slayer 1 is easy. Though difficulty plays a bigger role in those than with pets, but the point is that achievements are relative. You could also say that Skotizo is harder than the Giant Mole, so the Baby Mole is easier to get than Skotos. And if you look it purely from the perspective of time, getting the totems to fight Skotizo can make it a harder pet to obtain the other bosses with less likely chance but more grindable designs.
---
Anyway, I'd agree it isn't a great achievement, but it is still an achievement. In general, I think rarity is a rather poor way to justify pets and the rarity of one doesn't hurt the value of another. A 1 in 65 isn't that rare, but getting it at a low KC is still lucky; for example, a 1 KC Skotos is comparable to a 6 KC Tassets.
---

It's not QoL, that's just making the game a lot easier if you didn't have to move your mouse to perform actions.

Why is Jagex Customer Support kicking around Account Security when it's the players that can't keep their mouth shut about their personal details? ü§î

Where did I imply it lol? Most people have two monitors, especially twitch streamers, and I never said anything about not being able to play two clients side by side, you‚Äôre reaching lol 
---
I mean, we have the F keys to reach everything, why can‚Äôt I rebind them to like ASDF mouse 4 mouse 5 or something? Or turn on run with mouse 4? I‚Äôd enjoy the game a hell of a lot more than I already do

So we‚Äôre good unless Jagex adds a water distillery to Nardah

Well drawn, cute/adorable. Only issue is that it's too SFW.
---
Oh my bad, and that makes sense considering if you recover your account with Google they remove the authenticator without a delay as well.
---
When an account is recovered enough proof was given to the company to convince them that the person they're talking to is the rightful owner of the account. Why would you need a delay if you're giving the account to its rightful owner?
---
‚ÄúNo bro, it‚Äôs a arm. See there‚Äôs the bicep, and the veins‚Äù

No not this guy
---
While I see your point, there‚Äôs tons of PvM content that gets better as you level up some of those, otherwise irrelevant skills.
---
Hence, spending the money to level herb for example, so you can do raids better ‚Äî is a gain in that sense, where you‚Äôd otherwise have to play for days/weeks of playing time to get the same levels you could after working for a couple days, at most. 
---
Most people, when they consider the perspective that you can‚Äôt even make the best profit rates w/o max gear and some BiS items, would also agree that they‚Äôd skip the early stages of those money-making grinds, such that they could make more money for leveling more skills, buying new gear, etc., if they could.
---
or just dont make them needlessly easier at all, because tons of people already do clues, its not like they need reviving

Cant believe they actually named a place after lizards, the madmen

Meet Cringreplyletics. My lower-effort meme-locked ultimate reddit account. After recently discovering the comment whore Cringeletics I decided to up the ante, to take this comment's cringe level to new heights. Negative quality. Negative originality. But this time I'm going to tackle head-on the cringe put forth by Cringeletics, acquiring an even greater amount of karma, all leading up to eventually taking on one of Reddit's biggest challenges... replying to every one of Cringeletics' comments.

you can do elvarg without being hit by, look up "elvarg safe spot". if you want to be safe, use the anti dragon shield with a crossbow rather than a 2-handed shortbow.  
---
not sure what you mean by salmon wizard robes, but elvarg has low ranged defence so you're probably better off using ranged against it anyway.
---
Idk maybe Jagex does understand, but OP's points still stand. It's not fun getting a Fiancy Tiara that sells for 10k from your master clue scroll and I barely ever see anyone actually wear that ugly thing. Same goes for the vast majority of clue scroll items. 
---
Pre-EoC cosmetics were far more valuable and that's what a lot of people remember what clue scrolls were about; getting fun cosmetic items that were also valuable. In OSRS, as you mentioned, cosmetics are a lot less valuable unless they're really rare or have actual uses. 
---
I'm not sure how relevant my next point is, but the wiki GE price checker lists items such as the Fancy Tiara at 5m when they first released. I don't think it's a stretch to assume that Jagex did expect these cosmetics to be worth something which sort of proves OP's point that Jagex doesn't really understand clue rewards since those kind of items dropped in value real hard.
---
Also looking back at the price history of some items makes me sad seeing how much value they've lost over the years. Black elegant shirt used to be worth 150k~ before 2016 and now they're only worth 16k lol
---
No

I mean, risking a ban is as pretty inefficient alternative. I think you're also underestimating the profits from slayer these days with Vorkath and Hydra. Even baragging tasks is better profit/hr than meleeing them anyways as well.
---
You're still making money on birdhouse runs, even more now with Redwood, Celastrus, and Dragon fruit seeds, as rare as they are, it's more than it used to be.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you're struggling with money to the point where you rwt, then it's not efficient.
---
Mmmm
---
It‚Äôs the same with Microsoft but yes you should get some kind of email 
---
Nah that's just how they've developed the game. Skilling isnt intended to be pointless they've made it pointless with npc shops and pvm drops...

Ahhh yes NightmareRH.

---
You know instead of acting like a douchebag you could've just not said anything.

---
But the problem I have is what if I have my friend grind 1 billion gold for me or get 99 rc for me.
---
It makes zero sense that that's allowed and the inferno isn't.
---
Don't forget to use a leaked email and turn off 2fa on that too.

---
I‚Äôm too lazy to learn to tick manipulate for better xp. Honestly seems too sweaty for me, if people want to play that way let them.. it‚Äôs a game. 
---
All of these stolen account post makes me think there's been a data breach of where ever psseords are stored
---
haven‚Äôt laughed this hard in a long time 
---
I believe something happened and they were leaked. 
---
To be fair, since it's all RNG-based, all the pets are achievements or none of them are.
---
Wasn‚Äôt he 11 or 12 when he did that?
---
&gt; it‚Äôs game integrity
---
This is where I'm lost.
---
If Jagex cared about integrity Account Sharing would simply be banned.
---
But it's allowed to the point that, Torvesta opens videos saying this is his buddies account. 
---
My question is where does this arbitrary integrity begin and end? Just with the inferno? Can I have my friend get me 99 RC? Can I have my friend grind me a billion gold? Can I have my friend PK me a couple hundred million? 
---
he didnt think we'd discover the twisted bow spawn that quickly
---
umm I am a agility pure, remove all content and add more roof tops.

One unique password and email for your account 
---
Yes police, this one here.
---
make sure you use a unique email and password for runescape
---
I have 45 agility. My worry is that I'll level up my agility too much, and marks of grace will be harder to obtain (since Cannafis course is the best right?). 
---
I did it with 61 mage and I used mystic and an Ibans staff half the time, I did sub out my mystic for rune plate/legs and a rune kite against the dag mother because she was wrecking my in mystic so I needed a little bit more defense. She was the only real problem but as soon as I switched out it was incredibly easy. I followed the OSRS Wiki guide for a few tips and that lead me in the right direction.
---
its funny how as soon as you explain this simple flaw to any random individual who didnt know about it already the "wow wtf lmao" answer is always the same
---
almost like there's literally no excuse for jagex to have built and continued to maintain the recovery system the way it is and it's glaringly obvious to everyone

Are you being willfully ignorant here or do you just not know?
---
I already laid it out. Thousands of accounts have been recovered by people that are not the original owners.
---
- social engineering to get personal info
---
- real life friends who knew login info
---
- leaked ips from skype/etc.
---
How many times have you seen on this exact subreddit where a jmod admits that an account was given to someone when it shouldn't have been. 
---
If you add an authenticator delay the worst case scenario is it takes another 3-7 days for the legit owner to get his account back. Without it an account is immediately compromised once recovered. You have the delay for the exact same reason you have the bank pin delay.
---
Accounts are recovered by people using these methods every single day.

What up!!! We're three cool guys looking for other cool guys who wanna hang out in our party mansion. Nothing sexual. Dudes in good shape encouraged, if you're fat you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, NOTHING SEXUAL.
---
Well just because it is a clue unique doesn't mean it should be worth a lot. Getting a Fancy Tiara from a Clue is like getting Bandos Boots from Graardor or a Ballista Spring from Gorillas; it is rare or at least rarer than normal but it isn't worth much compared to the other uniques. And if we didn't have those bad uniques, the good uniques would be worth less because there would be a smaller unique pool and more of the good ones would come into the game.
---
As for GE Pricing, that is always a bit hit and miss. Even with recent updates like Kebos, their guide prices can be way off the mark for better or worse. And while the Fancy Tiara is pretty terrible, I don't think we should just give up on cosmetics like that because they won't be a high-value item. That is pretty much the clue unique equivalent of saying "everything that isn't efficient is dead content"; it is okay to have some items that are trash and it would be bad if we only added clue items that were BiS or high value and ignored the fun stuff that made clues what they are today.
---
Overall, I'd say they are offering a pretty good mix of Useful Stats, High-Value Cosmetics, and Silly items. Of the 40+ new items mentioned so far, only like 15~ are cosmetic and of those, they may not all be worthless either. Like a Gilded Spade may sound worthless... but...

Is allowing 1 extra clue really making them easier? Especially if it is after 2K Clues? There is a pretty good argument on both sides, but it can be seen as QoL more than needless buff.

Adding to this, for any mobile users, most apps will also have a keyword based filter somewhere in the app. Did that a long time ago for political stuff.
---
Change your email password to keep ahead of the database leaks, and do this periodically. I think database leaks seems to be the most likely cause of hacking.  
---
I'm guessing when people sign up to RS service sites (clans, buying gold, phishing sites etc), the site owners will ask you for your email address. Then they'll check the leaked databases for your password. If your e-mail has been leaked and your password wasn't changed and no 2FA set up since the leak then they can easily login to your email and recover your RS account.

Yeah reddit can help get traction. I mostly play rs3 but check here from time to time for the memes. My game bugged once and I was unable to get a task reward so I posted on r/runescape and a mod replied with a real unhelpful answer and promptly got flamed by the community. They manually accessed my account and fixed it after that. Sad that it took the stars aligning to have that fixed.

or use the tabs on the side

True story, one of my first days playing Runescape I met a guy called Spi27, I remember his name cause it was such an iconic encounter. I had NEVER stepped outside of Lumbridge cause I thought the world was massive and I got lost super easy (In those days you would open the world map and it wouldn't show you where you were, you had to look around and figure it out)
---
Anyway, met this guy and he took me out of Lumbridge to the crossroads by Falador so he could get me a cape - I wanted one but didn't know how to get one. He died fighting a highwayman and I was able to finish the highwayman off cause it was on such low HP, even though I was even weaker than Spi.
---
I thought death in the game just meant you were booted out of the game, like an ultimate ironman or something, except your account is also deleted (Elite Ultimate Ironman) but then I got a whisper from him saying he was okay, just back at Lumbridge!
---
I was 12 at the time, I can't believe I remember it so well but it was an encounter like that that got me hooked to the game for such a long time.
---
He also has 5 pets including BA queen

From what I understand, he hacked people with billions personally by just getting their info as a Jmod. He is also speculated to have released information about rich accounts to members of RoT so they could then recover those accounts with the info he gave them. There‚Äôs also speculation that he had something to do with RoT and all of the Deadman Mode DDoS‚Äô. 
---
At least I think. 
---
I smile ear to ear every click I make while runecrafting for it's the most exhilarating content the game has to offer.
---
i dont understand what kind of middleground you think can exist here
---
obviously easier content is going to be less interesting, it's all those mechanics you think take too long to learn that make the harder fights interesting

I'm just starting to get into Zulrah and even though I haven't beat him yet I feel like it's such a grind for that kill count and money trail. I've got 1825 total, 99 mining and smithing, and trying to get my rc to 99. I just don't see me making insane amounts of money even after beating Zulrah.

Doubt there will be a deadline. There isn‚Äôt one for the clue hunter from crack the clue 1. Idk why this would but the other wouldn‚Äôt have a deadline 
---
Yeah people don't make use of the security options already available so why would they even bother? It's a players responsibility to keep their account secure. Period. And it's not that difficult either.
---
People are just bitches and would rather blame jagex for their own stupidity. This is exactly what I say everytime I hear this bull shit argument. This community of players is just lazy and irresponsible, not to mention a bunch of ungrateful little shits. I've never been hacked in my over years of playing this game because I dont do stupid stuff that can end up with someone else discovering my password.
---
Maybe one day this community will grow the hell up and grow some god damn brain cells.. I honestly wouldn't mind if all these ass holes got hacked and lost everything they owned, possibly even their accounts permanently. It would mean there are less morons to deal with.

Maybe not the best method but dust devils should give you a decent earning with little attention (granted that they aren't aggressive so it does require you to click every other 30 seconds or so). If you have a lot of time and patience then crafting nature runes are also good money. Get enough pure essence to level you up to 60 runecrafting (this should be around 20k essence). This should take a day or two depending on your playtime and that will net you a bond plus a little extra cash on the side and not to mention, level you up in runecrafting, one of the most dreaded skills.

---
The simple answer is that sometimes people lose/break/upgrade their phone, and using a new device means you need to re-setup the authenticator. Remove it from your old phone, link it with your new phone. 
---
People would be pretty upset to log into OSRS that day and not be able to get their account sorted. They'd go to remove the authenticator (to re-add on the new phone) but be hit with a delay (one day? one week?) meaning a (legitimate) user who is (legitimately) using the authenticator system the way it was meant to gets locked out of their account - which they are paying money for. 
---
Worth noting this is the same reason why a lot of other games/sites with authenticators don't have a removal delay. Because it feels *really bad* for legitimate users who try to update their authenticator and find they are just flat-out *barred* from their account for however long the delay is. 
---
I mean, here are some services I use which utilize authenticators: Steam, Battle.NET, Epic Games, and Gmail. Not one of those have a removal delay for authenticators. They use other ways of verifying ownership and allow you to remove/re-add the authenticator instantly. 
---
Not very related but before g.e. When you went through websites to buy/sell items I was lured into wildy and got froze and Teleblocked by a group of ancients mages and lost my gold trying to buy my first whip... Was so psyched to get my first whip and I got screwed over hard. 3m was hard to get back then lol... Hours of magic tree cutting wasted. I was a sad middle school kid
---
They were updated just the other year to reflect the current rules. Removing them outright likely would lead to more scamming, but I recall mention of removing them once you cleared the Stronghold; I forget if they added that or not.
---

Is Sire worth doing at base 75 melee+ranged with Blowpipe + Arclight, or should I try to hit base 80s or higher before attempting him?

No problem! If you decide to use stretched fixed mode, be sure to tick all 3 boxes in the settings :)
---
dagger and dfs. 75 stab and 82 str versus hasta's 85 stab and 75 str, plus aggressive option effectively gives +3 str, while the hasta only has controlled or defensive. plus the dfs' defensive bonuses are higher.
---
I don't know about that. I don't think anyone has the name because I tried to add it to my friends list and was informed that there was no player by that name to be found. I'm not sure what you're getting at here...

Citation needed? Didnt a mod get fired for working with RoT? I don't even play this game anymore and never pvp'd and I know RoT is a bunch of little shits who exploit everything they can
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
Source?
---
A source. I need a source.
---
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.
---
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.
---
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.
---
Do you have a degree in that field?
---
A college degree? In that field?
---
Then your arguments are invalid.
---
No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Correlation does not equal causation.

CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

Cool! I did this in rs3 (with a few exceptions of f2p quests I did before I decided to do it) but it wasn't on an ironman and I didn't really restrict myself on other content. IMO it's the best way to experience quests, because you can see the development of lore and writing in the game. Looking forward to this series.

Cause its stupid.

Devalues clue scrolls and changes how they work dramatically.
---
I am thinking of training mage at kraken while I work since it will be easy afk. Just no idea if I should do it with bloods, deaths or chaos runes. What runes did you use? 
---
But in theory the influence should go both ways equally thus negating the influence entirely.

The studies people refer to are for political voting not for online game voting, I see 0 correlation.

im not arguing the recovery system isnt busted but a bank pin will 100% protect you from losing ANYTHING as long as your active in this case the player was active, as is in most cases of people getting hacked. 
---
Nope none of those are real ignore em. They're phishing links 
---
Yeah, what I did was looked at a bunch of different posts and took bits and pieces from each one and made my own bank tabs.

you're right, it's not your job to have to research anything

It's about a 1/398 to get an item from 1 brother runs iirc.
---
I think the general reason for both is it isn't needed. For Rerolls, it allows players to skip hard reqs that would otherwise need to train or quest to complete. Like while the amount of clue per reroll may be reasonable, you would see players doing Elite Clues and just saving rerolls for when they a RC Sherlock Clue or such.
---
For Multiple Clues, the concern seems to be about being able to farm clues quicker and bringing more uniques into the game, hurting their price. Also, it would change the pacing of clues, which has been controversial.
---
It's more comes down to me playing more recently and having some good rng, my account is a lot more valuable to me. I have gotten into a relationship where my partner supports whatever I do and one of those things is RuneScape. I wait till she's home to get a milestone achievement and she's been with me for all 99's. To some people it's not just a game, and that's why I worry. Someone taking away me and my partners hard earned time and memories

1hp dharoks woth overload and absorption. Look up a boss list for max points. Grab ultimate force powerups as much as possible to try and maximize the amount of inadequacies
---
A clue scroll is like an optional event where you can take a break from whatever you're doing.  By making them stackable, people won't be motivated to do them right away and they won't stop their activities to do them.
---
&gt; the majority of osrs players are end-game
---
They aren't though, those users are just a vocal minority. The vast vast majority will never ever train a skill past lvl 80 or ever set foot into a raid. Konar was a smash hit among the majority of the playerbase.
---
If the game was never changed at all, it would have died.

Update them to reflect accurate information and make them not skippable. Currently on your first time running through you can just spam click doors to skip answering the questions. 10/10 super effective 4x damage

Ikr. Most clans and I believe wedoraids require it

And I couldn't agree more on things like Jad and Zuk. Like I'm supposed to give up my next to-BIS cape just for a *Chance* at obtaining the BIS cape? And on top of that I need to spend hours just learning the mechanics before I try just so I can have that chance at actually obtaining BIS cape? I think that's ridiculous. I can understand unforgiving but seriously? Come on. 
---
 I feel as if most high end content made in recent history is made to challenge players like popular streamers so everyone can watch them do it not to challenge the average player.
---
I think the key difference is that everyone in RS3 goes and does end game content looking like this, because they have cosmetic gear overrides

I'm 9/10 sure I knew what a loli was when I was 14, but I was kind of a weeb
---
This is a pet peeve for me but I‚Äôd like to see lore from the Runescape novels and then deviations from it of what we saw reference to in RS HD and RS3, it would definitely have to be changed due to no blisterwood in OSRS among other things. 
---
However there already is a prexisting mention to Lord Sulla in the comm orb dossiers from one of the Templar quests, however that was prior to the novels ever being thought of.. 
---
Also don‚Äôt forget Besides the corp beast they‚Äôve already changed how the ivandis flail was made and ranis‚Äô death.
---
Stop being so cheap.
---
Not sure if this is the place to ask but I have no clue what is going on with my login.
---
I can sign into the RS website but when I try and log into OSRS it tells me "invalid credentials."
---
I changed my password as well just in case. 
---
So I'm a classic player and I've always kind of wondered if Gower originally planned for the Dark Lord to be Zamorak - given the introduction of Iban for example. If you read those seriously old God Letters pre-Postbag from the Hedge it did seem like he was indeed involved in the split in Ardougne's government or something.
---
Yo. I know I need to quest. Qpc is my first "big" goal. I'm looking for the repetitive skill grinds I can do when I have a few minutes to open mobile here and there, like grinding out marks of grace, or gold nuggets from mlm. I have to get 99 everything eventually anyway, so what are the *meaningful* grinds, like graceful, I can do now that graceful is done? That's the only actual question I'm asking.
---
I know quests are most important but when I'm on an uber for 9 minutes I'm not gonna be tabbing back and forth to slayermusiq. Geez.

---
I have a strange suggestion but perhaps you can move slayer aside and do quests, then sorta print out or edit a map in a document of where all the different types of mobs you see are. That sounds interesting and eventually well-paying off enough. 
---
The point is they've already addressed this suggestion several times and the benefits do not outweigh other potential levels of security that wouldn't result in the majority of their customer base complaining endlessly, as they already do with bank pins. There has to be an actual benefit to wasting time and money on implementing a specific layer of security, and there's a reason why virtually no other company utilizes a delay. This community is simply too narrow-minded to see these factors.
---
Oh you love it you rascal

Your medical knowledge is a bit lacking there bud. IUDs can make periods way worse, and more unpredictable to boot. Some lucky women experience lighter periods and even amenorrhea (no period), but it's not a given, or even likely.

I'm talking about dicing bot btw. Probably a dumb question but it really does vex me how much they bother to dress them up anymore lol
---
Agree with everything except the last point - MTX makes them more money than membership.
---
Tob only has 3 scalings, 3man, 4man, 5man.
---
So if you attempt to solo or duo it, you still have the difficulty of a 3man so it's very hard, most of the solo mechanics are slow and exploitative. But it is doable.

And definitely don't give us more granular volume control, the deafening volume from the first setting is literally my entire childhood

I'd definitely recommend having higher stats, especially magic. At 88, you can Shadow Barrage which stuns his first phase the longest. It's doable at 70s-75s, but I'd recommend base 85s. You'd be spending just way too much time running back and forth stunning him with burst/blitz and trying to kill the vents.

Because you feel like you‚Äôre being productive while you‚Äôre doing something that isn‚Äôt (like watching a TV show).

It was this realization that caused me to put the game down for a bit and focus my efforts towards something that I could benefit from as an individual. I feel like I‚Äôm too young to come home from work and click some buttons when I know I could be doing something more rewarding.

I‚Äôll still log in on the weekends occasionally, but I don‚Äôt hold myself hostage to completing an OSRS task to the point where I feel like I‚Äôm grinding through something.

i splash to train magic, not to make money. and i dont want to check every few moments to see if i have to reposition.
---
And have a little counterpart named Willis that eats ass.
---
I like the outline better as well but a few friends preferred the right so I posted both :)
---
Thank you! I try to practice a lot
---
If you have to check to see if you have to reposition, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
---
See ya on the next DVS rare drops video
---
teak manipulators are still actively playing the game, whereas splashers aren't maybe?
---
Any tips on soloing Olm? I'm trying to get better at CoX but I always feel like I'm running out of supplies (especially Staminas) on Olm. What method is best? I feel like the zero damage method absolutely destroys my run energy/stamina pots - should I be bringing in more?
---
Also, does running in and suiciding an inventory of brews/restores tank your points that much? (Until I learn a bit more, ofc)
---
And since when has afking not been acceptable in osrs?
---
I can taste the awkwardness from that moment 
---
WoW has probably something more like 3 million active subscribers atm.
---
And that has to be one of the stupidest ways to compare playerbase, total amount of active players vs highest concurrent player count? 
---
cool, that's one less concern then
---
why not just use the unrestricted worlds and avoid the risk altogether?
---
He thinks hes been keylogged, and want the account voluntarily blocked by a jmod, is this possible? asking for a mate.
---
meanwhile i get perma muted for despawning ardy knights &amp; saying nothing lmao.
---
how about now?
---
I don‚Äôt want your forgiveness, I want you to keep feeding me.
---
Nice
---
Yet.... surprise!! People still keep playing and paying for membership. 
---
It depends how competitively minded you are, but I agree.
---
You are just unlucky
---
&gt;They set up polls to fail/pass from the start. 
---
This is a huge inherent problem with the polling system: Jagex only polls something they would want. There's always massive bias.
---
Especially as you say: They can repoll things they want to pass, as they did a few votes back. Oh, it failed three times? Let's poll it again trololololol.
---
If you just recently started playing osrs I suggest you to take up easier goals first. Like Monkey Madness for dragon scimitar, getting a blowpipe, killing Jad for fire cape. 
---
ToB can be solo'd but you need to have gear+game knowledge. Like doing few times with friends first before going full tryhard solo.
---
Meanwhile look up "Woox" youtube channel. Make sure to type "Woox won" meme so people think you're a cool guy.
---
This is not his channel, but it shows him doing solo ToB.

for a self proclaimed troll, you really have a hard time realizing when youre getting fucked with
---
I want a name too, that's currently not available and is(/was) on an inactive acc. The strange thing is, i have added the name for over a year now and last week it suddenly came online! I was so happy to see the name pop up, so i immediately PMed him: No response. First encounter the acc was logged in on PK Free world, and the last 3 times on 301. Everytime the acc was logged in, it was for less than 5 mins. Only at GE.
---
It is almost obvious to me this acc is hacked, since it isn't used to play. PMs i send are ignored. The problem is, since it is being logged in, it's technically not an inactive acc anymore.
---
then put a /s
---
otherwise people think you're not being sarcastic
---
reading emotion from text is hard
---
Grats on the warhammer. Those rune items can be tough to come across sometimes
---
Extrapolate? What did he say that was wrong?
---
We don't need authenticator delay, it's easy af to not get hacked.
---
Seems super convenient timing really. Likely they gave up tournaments because they knew they couldn‚Äôt get anywhere and decided to focus on something else 
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä customer is retard ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Look kid, if you want upvotes, it has to be Swampletics. Scrap it and try again
---
I have honestly never heard ‚Äúcunts‚Äù used as an adjective before. Impressive.
---
Mmm yes keep it coming. Thank you.
---
Would make sense seeing as they haven‚Äôt entered the tournaments. Bare in mind most of their wins were before Jed was involved with RoT at all (as in before he joined the clan in game), so it‚Äôs not like Jed was the only reason they won. Also Jagex have made the ending 1v1 to try stop RoT‚Äôs domination because whether Fools etc. like to admit it or not, RoT in clan vs clan multi battles are the best ever. In 1v1s, not so much because they don‚Äôt do that style of PvP (most clans don‚Äôt). 
---
Also RoT always has a rivalry with another clan or set of clans. Whether it is Rev, Fools, FoE etc. do that takes up a lot of their time. 
---
I‚Äôm anti RoT, always have always will but I‚Äôm not delusional, they deserve credit where it‚Äôs due and don‚Äôt where it‚Äôs not due. I wanted to support Rev in this clan vs clan beef but since Rev have been taking on Frontline members (who as everyone knows are ddosers, doxers, hackers, have been chain banned multiple times by Jagex) I can‚Äôt support Rev because they have become like RoT. So Fools it is. 
---
I don't. I just play some stupid f2p wildy accounts for the lols. Had a drop party on my main but left enough to fund a couple of f2p accounts. 
---
indeed
---
I love doing this
---
There‚Äôs just a higher risk that they could potentially lose the tournament (especially without a potential inside man, like Jed) so it would be a big gamble that they would be paid out rather than the consistent easier and technically legit practice of ruling the 2.2k rev worlds 
---
I know its absurd to us but it has come up multiple times in r/runescape
---
It‚Äôs not fake but you keep being a dick I hope you one day feel what I felt logging in to see everything gone  
---
You can actually safespot jad for that phase to make it a lot less stressful
---
You basically just tag the healers once and drag them behind a rock, then you can kill them in peace without having to manage prayers
---
It requires a little bit of setup tho as you need to lure jad into the safespot when he spawns
---
It's one of the lamest things that it is possible to type out on a keyboard. It completely kills any humour. 
---
It can be but highly unlikely,  is username same as log in name or email? Any of your information leaked that u know of?
---
This is an abomination.
---
What if Varrock and Morytania are unintensional metaphors describing the west and the middle east?
---
I see that you said you recently changed your password. I'm guessing you've either forgotten your new password or misspelled it, or your account got stolen.
---
Try recovering your account ASAP.
---
ReEeEEEEEeEEeEEEEe
---
Probably around 1 hour.
---
first off thanks for giving a shit, my cc called me a liar rwt'er which i wish cause im broke irl. and no i got a username login and a diff pass than email, I got deleted emails from the same time frame
---
I don't think A Friend would have hacked him though
---
  
---
Don't slander peoples names on the internet
---
Fuck off retard
---
He didn't tick eat he just unnoted food at philes so he wasn't breaking any rules just using a game mechanic
---
Aside from less competition in the 2.2k worlds is there any actual benefit to it? I'm assuming it's just easier to hold them down since youd have to be near maxed to be in the world which few people are but wouldnt be surprised if theres was something else to it.
---
@CumineGrool, thats my name now. Ty
---
Forget your no guides rule and use the wiki.
---
you poor thing....

Let them have fun.  The bot maker is probably anti-Trump anyway, given the Nazi accusation.
---
Go inside the house and exit it at the back
---
Why would you ever ever ever reset your task streak on purpose. 
---
Yet another repost. How many times do you want to farm your own post for karma?
---
This reminds me of that game that predated RS2 what was it called now?
---
They always call it dick cheese not smegma.
---
No milestone is close and i got basically everything unlocked.
---
See you next week ;)
---
I see it because of the dust devil mouth lol
---
Hacked ur life btw gg
---
Spotted the salty virgin.
---
Meat swamp tar lettuce
---
Dude you are in the 1% you should be happy
---
These guys pop around every now and then in f2p worlds
---
I usually see them in lumbridge courtyard
---
That would never happen, because I'd be using a bank pin that no one knows.. And it takes days to remove and by then I have recovered my account. Or no one would've been on my account at all, since I'd be using auth and 2fa..
---
So something isn't correct here. The only thing I can think of is you having malware on your account which is your fault, not Jagex's.. What do you want Jagex to do about you (unintentionally) giving the hacker all the info he needs to login?
---
Dr strange üò©
---
A few hundred thousand, and he already has another job. Turns out companies don‚Äôt look at reddit conspiracy theories.
---
If someone knew your pin there are exactly 3 options: You told someone your pin, your pin was easy to guess or you have malware on your PC. 
---
Oakdice ive used afew times, decent rates and trusted
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä WE STILL CANT PET OR ADOPT STRAY DOGS ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
With all the accounts being hacked recently you shouldnt be posting this on reddit. 
---
The pin got removed like I said earlier I hadn‚Äôt been on because of work also full scan was done found nothing. 
---
Buy imbued heart, helps a ton on nibblers. Which you will find is a big deal in inferno. Personally i ised ahrims insteas of bcp, but my setup was the same. For the supplies. I used 8 restores 2 bastion 1 stam and the rest brews. You will learn to prayflick and conserve prayer. Good luck my man
---
Rot is a multi clan so they dominated DMM when the finale was a multi battle.. not a hard concept 
---
"Posting every day until i get my KoTS prize: Day 1"
---
The hacker got through your bank pin? Then he must've known the bank pin.. And that's your fault. 
---
Deleted emails for what? 
---
Clearly someone knew your password AND bank pin. Since you didn't have authenticator they could just login and steal your shit.
---
Play some more RS, that should take your mind off of it.
---
For whatever reason this is my favorite thing I‚Äôve seen on here in forever
---
However it is probably easier to earn 120k $ in real life than it is to obtain that loot. 
---
220k
---
Your title says "is it really this easy" but most of your comments are about leaking little details.
---
This shit is broken af
---
&gt;Ok. I feel bad for you man. I hope everythings ok.  
---
That's called projecting, it's when you express feelings and concerns about yourself towards other people.
---
Damn that's bad luck
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt understand no malware and the new email is only a month old since I changed it
---
i leaked more than little info but if it wasnt for the deleted emails id easily blame my irl friend 
---
How do you find this window?
---
I think I‚Äôve heard like 100m for 2 weeks? Not positive though 
---
Don‚Äôt i have to go through the swamp to get them all? :D while lvl 130s spawn with lolg range attacks. How‚Äôs that afk
---
It may be even possible to sue them, no quite sure xd
---
I hope so
---
yeah sadly i forgot my original irons info lol. But i might need to make a new one since osrs took up alot of my free time and im really bored. But why do it if ill just get that hacked like the first time it happened (this is #2)
---
Devalues hardest achievement in the game
---
I cant believe youve done this.
---
And it's not hidden in his post History so yeah basically that's useless.
---
Why would you want to show off your stats btw I don't get it.
---
ImRedFox, ty for account.
---
Move on to a fulfilling and values filled relationship Beats this game 
---
Yeah I can only get maybe 2 hours a day, I‚Äôm doing mlm at the moment but it just feels really slow 
---
U still lookin? 
---
You should use chins on short fuse for best gp/xp and medium fuse for highest xp/hr. Unless you already have 99 mage I would suggest training defense through bursting as it's more effecient.
---
Oh and btw 80 def is more than high enough for Vorkath
---
When that happens, i view it as you crashing your own pure from exp. I‚Äôd stay there as long as you don‚Äôt hop your pure. Funny as hell?
---
We were, thankyou sir.
---
reinstalling windows is a thing? at this point whats gone is gone and i just wanna at least protect my irl pc and bank
---
So exactly what that guy just said?
---
RS3 Omegalol
---
Just try it my dude, it's free, you got nothing to lose
---
Do a virus scan, make sure your computer is completely clear and safe. Created a new email and password for an account. New Two-step. Stop going on dodgy sites/downloading unsafe things.
---
Bitch this some Minecraft shit
---
Really? Where lmao
---
you're right, companies should allow employees to perform below expectations because it would hurt their feeling otherwise.
---
MIIIISTAAAAHHH
---
He was asking what happened with the Jed situation, specifically about helping RoT and I told him what we objectively know about the situation relating to RoT. 
---
if you did it 6 hours a day every day idk if you'd be so fond of it at that point
---
I‚Äôm literally crying and laughing at the same time 
---
Literally just do Theatre of Blood rather than splashing, then you get a chance at a good drop /s
---
Read the wrong comment before yours. My bad bro. Apologies.
---
Remember when Mod Stone apologized for prizes not being sent and said that he would personally post them that week?
---
Remember when he didn't follow through? And then left Jagex? And then they STILL didn't get sent?
---
I remember.
---
You can get access to emails through older emails. So if you had an older email as back up account to your new email.. Someone could try to recover the new email and then a code or something would get sent to the old email. So check if any other email is linked to the new email and if someone got access.
---
Fake
---
Ive tried, irs perma banned. I told them to check the last ip that was used and all of that but i just got an automated message saying my appeal was rejected because of macroing major. Its a shame since the acct had around 400m xp and nearly every 99.
---
I was asking from the OP
---
Need brainlet bucket headed meme
---
I've heard that song dozens of times in Colombia, they look colombian too.
---
I was in same boat and was basically forced to restart on a new account because they have zero customer support.
---
There's a structural issue in the company. Need a strong leader who can delegate. The reason these things don't get solved is because no one is accountable. If we point fingers at a group of 100 people, none of them will do anything. We need to point our fingers at one.
---
 üëÄ version when
---
It's not against the rules, but you can still get scammed.
---
I swapped quite a bit through 'prop swap' though. Make sure you ask from ranked
---
Nice! I only have 5 days membership left so I am in a doubt what to train next..
---
Anyway congrats on 54 RC in advance :-)
---
Beautiful
---
Just buy gold from a website. A lot more convenient. 
---
Yes, but probably  still brings in a lot of money for Jagex.
---
Same happend to me bro, 6 months now and they are still ignoring... feel ya
---
His Twitter?
---
To drink pots every 20 min in nmz so you dont get logged out, if you play mobile you get logged out if you turn your phone screen off. 
---
I‚Äôd call 4 titles domination lol they‚Äôve won half the seasons 
---
 I think the difference is that you don't have to splash on rats. You have so many other options. But the bird is crucial to the teak cutting method.
---
Sure it is not a nice thing to do either, but killing the teak bird actually ruins the experience for those who you that method.
---
Jebrim is a cool dude ye
---
Hide item names under 200gp value ez
---
I love doing it purely because the player is dumb enough to choose the **one** creature in the entire game that can be killed by another player in single combat zones.
---
It's clearly sarcastic, why do you need that spelled out lol
---
Non-rooftop agility courses. Wilderness course gives roughly 3x the agility xp canifis/falador course gives, while werewolf course is better then ardougne. 
---
Y tho
---
This is a fat guy comment tbf 
---
Ye tell me, But 5000 hours of playing and then start a new account? don't think so
---
No serious OP do this for glory ^and ^karma
---
whether you want to 3t or not is your choice but it's still the fastest regardless, fishing is slow as fuck
---
I aim for difficult/very beneficial goals and work towards them. Like my current one of grinding vorkath and getting the pet/assembler.
---
I have to complete ds2 and all the quests leading up to it. I also did the hard diary for elite void gear which is best in slot, so for the past few months has been leading up to this one goal.
---
Im completely new to members, i dnt get why people say wait for 70 combat to do slayer.. how do i go about slaying properly? Dont know much about gear aswell
---
&gt;It's very choppy without animation smoothing. Is that better?
---
Yes.
---
Just start skilling and working towards rfd, that will keep you occupied with a clear skilling goal also. 
---
Ill give this a go aswell
---
I would say that prims should be one of the last upgrades
---
i bet some guy at the office stole the trophy or something and they havent replied because they're still trying to find the trophy
---
If you look at OP'S post history it's obviously fake. I gotta give it to OP tho, this sub fell for it so badly.
---
Nice try, hackers. I don't make posts so you try to get me to post in this thread. 
---
I hope we see this chain of comments on every thread possible at all times to voice our displeasure with how bad things still are. It makes me wonder if we posted mostly repetitive threads about the ongoing issues continually if things would change.
---
My general plan is:
---
Start of day: stop splashing rats and do a tree run
---
Bulk of the day:  is a modestly low target of a skill. At the moment I aim to do 200k craft xp a day. 
---
I'm that guy who will pick a skill and do it to 99 (which helps avoid the aimlessness), unless I need some skills for quests or run out of materials. 
---
I am a 100% mobile player, because of life commitments so I tend to stick to skills I can somewhat afk
---
End of day: fruit tree and tree run, then set up to splash rats while I sleep
---
What I usually do:
---
- login
---
- check GE on bought or sold items
---
- farm run 1x (trees + cactus)
---
- train something ‚Äúhard‚Äù to do like RC or so
---
- go do my daily stuff IRL (work, hobby, etc)
---
- log in (to check GE)
---
- do some AFK stuff (fletching, woodcutting, fishing, etc)
---
- come back home on pc logging in 1 more time
---
- farming run again 
---
- buying/selling new items at GE and checking my precious skills one more time
---
Just find something you can do daily to stay motivated.
---
- farm runs
---
- shop runs (to buy staff, hats, runes) and sell GE
---
- 100x RC runs 
---
When Im ‚Äústuck‚Äù I decide to buy for example 5k lobsters and force myself to be disciplined enough to finish that first before moving on to another skill. Did this till 31 slayer with Hill Giants as a mage pure before 45 herblore haha
---
Got 99 smithing making addy plates on mobile, it would have made a noticeable difference in time if we didnt have that delay lol
---
Heavy and light frame received reporting in.
---
It's not. It's the visual representation that reminds me of that image. Not the actual meaning behind the art.
---
I'm not that fucked in the head.
---
Dont want to, id rather farm for it
---
And if you're wondering why RuneLite gets targetted by phishers, it's because of the explosion of popularity that happened last year during an incident with Jagex. (Which has been resolved)
---
Isn‚Äôt this annoying for you? Genuine question
---
Prolly like me only ever had a 10m bank
---
118 kc twisted bow, u deserved to get hacked
---
Jokes on you it's 0% cause I don't have one. ^(Somebody sex me pls, this is a call for help)
---
Does red or black slayer helm look good with this?
---
but that never happens because they always leave within 5 mins
---
Pretty much
---
mod jed? never heard?
---
I mean people might not do it as it is a fairly common scam 
---
It's because Jagex is a small company and they have a lot of players. They probably get more tickets than they can even manage to resolve tbh 
---
i think if you intend to pay them back, no harm is done. it's risky for whoever loans you the bond but if you pay them pack, there is no issue 
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he doesn't play as much wow anymore.
---
Os team are pretty on point in general. 
---
delet this
---
It is PvE, but you aren't actually combating it conventionally. It is really just a fight over whether to fletch or not.
---
woa.
---
Should just go to sand, swamp or ammonite crabs.
---
needs more data  
---
disclaimer: good job though ;D
---
Surprised people are still reacting to this information/news. This has been an issue with Jagex even before EoC came out. Jagex for whatever just hates sending contest rewards.
---
Must be one hell of a shipping fee. 
---
All I can say is make sure you're logging into the correct account.
---
Stats don't get reset in RS.
---
I would say check to see if your stats are in RS3, because OSRS started in 2013 and its stats are different, but you said that you played it a year ago or something.
---
It's fun to see them reply to funny tweets but the fact that these get more replies from jagex employees over actual people needing support is a huge let down. 
---
Zulrah: Buying gf 1 serp visage xd.
---
pls don't get hacked :)
---
While I appreciate his choice in music personally I find "battle of the heros" better 
---
He obviously wasn't around that time they removed wilderness pking.
---
Oh no that definitely means he was always a part of them! Probably before osrs even existed!! 
---
‚ÄúSomeone drew breathe before me that is in history and I am not in history‚Äù
---
I AM A FUCKING LOSER MAN
---
Idk maybe life is worth living after seeing a joke like this 
---
Jesus I can‚Äôt imagine what sub even talks about, terrible music, useless relationship dramas, obscure choices of fashion?? What is it about?? 
---
And in the meanwhile change the lowest volume so it's actual low volume. 
---
I just asked a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to do me the favor and he blocked me so fast that I need surgery. I‚Äôve got the gear and not that it means much I care about my word. Just sucks to not have any trust.
---
Owning RuneScape is literally the only thing Jagex has going for them. If they didn't they would never make a single penny again. 
---
Badly milking the product that people with actual skills before them made is the only thing they are capable of doing.
---
or just honest
---
My friend just got it at 59
---
Best advice is right here.
---
Over thinking and panic is how jad kills you
---
Nah, you just don‚Äôt try hard enough, if you were serious you would have time travelled back and breathed first. Fucking casual.
---
Dice part about that: moving away from jad and relying just on sounds to prayer flick
---
Depending on his spawn and where you are safespotting, etx

Got a phoenix on my new ironman at 16kc. Wanted to wake my gf up in excitement but I knew she wouldn't care...
---
For a game I've put so many hours into and will continue to do so, I'm happy to pay whatever.
---
You will not go to jail for doing this. 
---
The lack of upvotes is disturbing
---
double headed snek
---
Idk both look gay as fuck regardless
---
also tourneys changed from multi ending into 1v1's after 128 players in 2 locations remaining but lets scratch that we are on reddit brain allowed
---
Hope you get banned
---
Isn't it just 4 mind runes instead of fire runes? Aka, literally like 4 gp less per cast lol
---
chins lmfao
---
PETs ba queen
---
Valid reason. I personally wouldn't be able to unless they had a good 10m+ on them because I can make that 10m somewhere else but they can never get their hc status back. But that's just my POV and i wrote this post to get other peoples' POV so i ain't judging at all.
---
Will do and have done before. I'd love for their to be some kind of HC Ironman killed counter. It is the most glorious death possible for them. 
---
Nothing will change since despite all the reddit posts people are still paying for membership. If you want to have change hit their pockets.
---
Quest points aren't really a consequence. What area accessibilities are op?
---
11$
---
A PvP Clan was DDoSing people at Deadman tournaments in order for them to win every single time.
---
Turns out that clan had a retard working for Jagex, the now fired mod Jed. He was providing them with the contestants ip to ddos during the competition. He also frequently accessed rich accounts and cleaned them, supposedly they shared it at their clan.
---
Nowadays this scummy clan, RoT, locks out revenants at a 2.2k world and charges from people to enter there, since they can't win any Deadman tournaments without cheating. They make a ton of money locking this world, money they obviously rwt to compensate for not winning.
---
In my opinion the high ranks at this clan should be fucking banned 
---
im at 91 and no pet currently and you just filled me with fear... thanks...
---
Deported
---
Valid point, they knew the risks. I just wouldn't be able to though lol
---
i think blacks only give you 60% of the exp they're supposed to. 
---
&gt;and making way more money
---
3 USD an hour. Lol...
---
People who post their drops on reddit do so because they are lonely 
---
The mods are hardly responsible to writing a check over any amount of money and sending it to anyone. This goes through finances and the higher stages which have literally never even played runescape or seen any of these posts. The mods are basically powerless. 
---
10-20m? You 5 man bandos?
---
I get 95-100k at blacks with 74 hunter 
---
are you farming negative karma? ; because with that name you'll be hitting gold
---
Kill the brothers and 3 skeletons. 88%, you're good. 
---
That's it. All untradeables have some sort of GP value. So if it's one of the protected items in the preview page, it's legit and you'll keep it. 
---
This guy here probably thinks you could give Krystilia a chaos rune eye
---
literally people are only downvoting you because you're comparing two different things.
---
Jesus Christ that's  quite something. But why is Jagex still "powerless to a pvp clan"?
---
You got 43 kills as the tank on your first trip?
---
Or if its ironman, it's always free 
---
Yes ofc
---
Look at what I want/have to do irl, sit down on my pc and randomly browse the internet, do 1 slayer task, back to browsing. And *not* doing anything I wanted to do.
---
bright and clean colours are where this game started lmao
---
it's only been the later years where washed out colours and overdesigned 5 billion polygon designs have ruined the style
---
Lol that's a pretty good name. If you're that desperate buy a bond and change it instantly. But I doubt you'd even be force name changed within a month with that name, and even if you are I don't think your first forced name change is counted as an offense. 
---
Its not an unpopular opinion and its agreed upon in the daily repost.
---
Shut it, Jed. 
---
How's everything there? I can't imagine what it must be like with everything losing power for so long
---
Craws bow is a tenth of what it used to be. Once you deduct fees these people are probably making 1m/hr lol
---
It doesn't sound as cool though.
---
He got the loot because it was his kill. He did more damage. Same as when two people attack the same NPC.
---
Upcoming clue update (passing in polls), new rewards, and ofc new items are always pricey on release.
---
Bet it's you
---
You got a YouTube channel I can keep the following coming? 
---
Yes because slayer blocklist. Areas is ape atoll, meyerditch, fairy rings. 
---
All the time it took you replying back to these people, you could have easily just searched ‚Äòosrs rot mod jed‚Äô and found several sources to back up everyone‚Äôs claims. But instead you had to be a condescending douche 
---
Double check your task? Or kill them in a non-slayer only area (like KQ lair) and see if you still get slayer XP.  
---
It's also possible you got the task from Konar, where you'd have a specific area you'd have to kill them in (that obviously isn't the slayer caves you're trying to kill them in)
---
Only way to get it back would be to loot it from your grave I think. If you let your grave disappear, then you're SOL.
---
Maybe you got a konar task to kill them kn the other cave?
---
I wouldn't touch them if I knew. I'd probably hang around and try defend them a bit if I could.
---
Don't be mad at OP. I got my 4th at ~4700 kc be mad at me instead. 
---
I mainly just do farm runs and afterwords I just think ‚Äúwell an hour isn‚Äôt bad to wait!‚Äù So I grind something. Right now since I am catching up on a Netflix show I am currently training theiving. 
---
These are becoming banal as fuck 
---
Usually trio, with 68k as average, and sometimes 4 man with 80k as average. Everyone else i raid with has 2-3 drops in 110 kc so i am lucky.

Get out of here

You're welcome
---
Although this is a joke on his part, runelite could make it so streamers can enter their pin on screen without leaking their pin.
---
Assuming the client was able change the numbers on the pad. Lets say my pin was 2,4,6,8. The client could have a configure panel asking for their pin (2,4,6,8) and then another input box for what they want it to be for on stream (1,2,3,4). 
---
With this, the client can swap the associated numbers around on the screen. For example the first pin number (2) would be swapped with a (1) so the streamer would click the 1 without viewers knowing it is a 2. repeat logic for each pin number.
---
I don't know why I wrote this out. Just a thought.
---
I dont get it
---
There isn‚Äôt one. They‚Äôre all the same.
---
Once in a while I throw 250k. I lost twice in a total of seven. They‚Äôre rigged, but they don‚Äôt seem to rig the rolls on smaller bets as much. Anyone I‚Äôve seen put in mills has lost.
---
0 eternal in 2.2k 
---
Then wtf is the point of there being different ones ? Why not just have a singular blackjack 
---
Never killed any normal kraken
---
RoT was also the only group told about the increased drop rate at revs for skulled players for months. The entire update was essentially Jed's "passion project" to feed gp into RoT to RWT.
---
There is no way that there is a funnier community than the osrs one. 
---
Primordial is the least important, zerker ring i is way above
---
I just need somebody to tell me that they have worse rng here to give me motivation! Best of luck!
---
If it‚Äôs so bad don‚Äôt play the game 
---
They are already in the game. It‚Äôs like hunter outfits, they meant to add a purpose, never did, and just aren‚Äôt going to remove them.
---
cry
---
Q Here are you hiding mister? 
---
Out of all those games I'm pretty sure Fallout 76 was shitted on so much by both regular players and content creators on youtube it's a lost cause. I don't ever remember anyone defending that steaming pile of hot garbage.
---
If they've been doing it for this long I'd assume they have a system that makes the gold source ambiguous
---
Can someone point me in the right direction for the "good" third-party clients? 
---
I'm in the low levels of OSRS, and coming from RS3 where there is the awesome first-party NXT client. So far, I've been using the first-party OSRS client, but I've heard so much about "Runelite" and "OS Buddy." However, I see a lot of advertisements and don't want my account hacked or banned. 
---
Can someone help?
---
I see this outfit or at least slight variations of it all the time, it's kinda overdone now with the red and black. 
---
She looks attractive but also like she doesn't know how to shake her ass properly
---
That‚Äôs the problem man. Just quit. I had 2 friends just quit because they got scammed and one just got tired of the game. If everyone just doesn‚Äôt play cuz the game turns south there won‚Äôt be a game! I love the game I just want the quality of a million dollar business that we all deserve. 
---
I assume this is a 'trust trading' sort of thing, people starting low and it being proven to be 'real', the dropping more and losing every time
---
Unpopular opinion: rot controlling PvP worlds and selling protection like a mafia is actually kind of cool emergent gameplay. 
---
Unlike dmm, it sounds to me (not 2.2k total) like it's essentially a high level PvP clan just doing what they do, not then being cheating assholes. People pay for BA services, ZMI runners, and things like that, so what's to stop them from using the skills they (hopefully legitimately?) gained in a similar way? Not like it's against the rules, and jmods like Ash I think have even said they approve of it.
---
Things like this honestly make the game feel like more than just a game, and it's certainly a better alternative to them cheating and making every tournament shit.
---
Is Jagex the new Blizzard??
---
Yeet
---
1.1k kc, 2 leather 2 tail 1 ring+1 piece.
---
Also, pet at 22 KC so there's that, but I'll have significantly less drops if I keep up this rate :D.
---
Damn. This guy outkicked his coverage for sure. Good for him. 
---
This really is pathetic
---
thank you
---
No.  Hej?
---
Jagex just stop the fucking contests if you can't give your winners their prizes.
---
FISHING
---
Yes I'm glad monsters have never wised up, especially when all they need to do sometimes is move 1 spot north/south. Silly NPCs. 
---
The best way to get them is to do them on tasks with superiors. 
---
However I just pretty much do every task down there just to get them. I am 34m slayer xp. Very inefficient this way but this is the way I like to do them.
---
If you are after this pet bursting nechs or dust devils is your best bet
---
Getting Kandarin hard diary done really helps. I‚Äôm at 77 right now almost 78, so I‚Äôll probably get them all before the 99.
---
wtf i love sparc mac now???
---
I remember making cheese wheels was actually decent gp back when cheese was worth tons from junk trading
---
Prob cause they would be op on pvp scene with 70 defence. 
---
Damn thats some dedication. Goodluck!
---
while simultaneous advertising their customer support as award winning 
---
They have you because they ain‚Äôt you.
---
Grats man! Gonna take a shot at it again sometime today! 
---
Blow pipe + bgs is better dps overall as l'on as you hit √† spec. Use the dps calc - rigour is better overall for bossing + anything else 
---
Most of your posts in this sub are you ruining others phone or you trying to sell your account. So my guess is you‚Äôre getting enjoyment out of it because you‚Äôre a dick. If you‚Äôre not good at this game then really just stop playing. You‚Äôre just a nuisance at this point. 
---
It used to be taller. It was burned down a long time ago.
---
Owch, that is really rough. The pet is vnice though. Im only doing it for the claw for raiding but the pet has to be one of my fravs. Goodluck!
---
No, this will devaluate my runecrafting grind on my simple boring ironman. This will also harm my nostalgia.
---
I watched some videos and guides, gonna try again later today. It‚Äôs around wave 54 I believe that starts fucking with me lol. 
---
This is the comment I was waiting for! Im glad to hear you finally got one though, goodluck going forwards!
---
learning curve for no honor pure bridding :)
---
Revolution is enough for almost every normal monster in that game tbh, most stuff dies so easily
---
It gives smithing exp for 1/3rd of the ores I believe? I could be wrong but I know it smiths somehow. That‚Äôs probably what happened lol
---
Did they wait 3 months for an award like their customers do?
---
Will do. 
---
This seems to be the best spread of items so far for the kc, grats on the pet and goodluck with the claw.
---
I‚Äôve seen like 700 people with this exact same fashionscape
---
This is like at episode of Spongebob where Patrick gets an award for doing literally nothing ever. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Infernal_pickaxe
---
1/3 chance to 'consume' the ore and you get smithing experience.  That's what it does. 
---
Forget about Jagex, why isn't law enforcement doing anything about them? DDoSing is an IRL crime.
---
Good content 
---
Honestly, can we all gofund me this guy like $10 each so he can buy a plane ticket and go to Jagex and bitch in person? 
---
Only stipulation is you have to record it so we can see their stupid faces when you actually show up asking for your shit. 
---
depending, but back then I think it was a racing chair + pc, and there was different tiers, a desk mat, etc etc.
---
wtf i hate money now
---
[His friend who accompanies him in the skit comedies is even more hilarious with his laughter](https://i.imgur.com/RDvXbVN.png)

For me, it used to be combatting bots. On my baby pure, I‚Äôd pk a ton of them at the obelisk and sometimes get a load of cosmics. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was like 200k an hour and fun. Need tb though and a low level pure. 
---
Back in the day, you could lure flax bots by dressing in all green with ice gloves and use color chat ‚Äú#flax‚Äù to get them to click on you. They would click you all the way to the giant bats below the yews in Catherby.
---
Skulltricking bots by clicking on their loot pile or dragon space at the right time. Doesn‚Äôt work much anymore because their scripts probably right click and hide the player attack option. 
---
Killing HCIM in the wildy is fun. 
---
I used to have two identical duel arena accounts when the i‚Äôs l‚Äôs 0‚Äôs and o‚Äôs looked similar. They had the same non cb stats, same cb lvl, gear, names, etc. One would be trash stats and the other would have like full vesta and vls. Made over 1B doing that. Also doesn‚Äôt work anymore. 
---
Luring was fun. Free money and I wasn‚Äôt even good at it.
---
Clans used to be awesome. Loved F2P wars and hopping on teamspeak to have a 200 person fight or pk trip. Probably still fun, but I‚Äôm not in one currently. 
---
Now I mainly prefer F2P due to lack of available time and helping out beginners, noobs, etc. it‚Äôs much more fulfilling to help get someone else started on their journey like how others helped me as a kid. I‚Äôve walked noobs from draynor through demon slayer, dragon slayer, knights sword, etc. I think draynor is the hot spot to find people like this if you ever want to do the same. The nostalgia is what does it for me, and I can‚Äôt keep up with the updates to make enough money and stay competitive, so again F2P makes more sense for me at the moment. 
---
I laughed wayy too hard at this.
---
post this in /r/cringe instead
---
Who needs DMM when you can just RWT your money from revs right?

There's always someone wanting something nerfed.

Because u need attack and def levels to wear it... dumbass

Combat 3 with slayer cape is possible, but I don't have the time and money and patience to do that. 1-99 slayer was around 1400 hrs on the cb 35, making the alts + money for slayer was another 600 ish hours.
---
Stop telling other people how to enjoy the game and just worry about enjoying it yourself.  
---
Don't think the tribe has many 2.2k total people lmao
---
Hes probably not dumb and has a separate email for rs, you know nothing if you keep falling for this meme

I would guess less effort.

Yeah no worries! I can have a look at the next script sometime if you'd like some feedback similar to that.

Ever heard of database leaks? If you use the same username and password combo on a website that has been hacked, then your username and pw are public knowledge and anyone can find them. That is why people hide usernames just in case. 
---
I have done that, so I hope that helps
---
its really slow. Work your way to monkey madness 2 to unlock maniacal monkeys and just chin to 99 range... it'll cost like 30m but would you rather train range for 20 days real time normally or get 99 range in like 10-15 hours and then get the 30m gold back by bossing or other means? When people try to do some cheap method its almost always better to just do it the most expensive way possible and make up the money with the time saved. In this case its 19 days saved holy crap.

While I don't disagree with you from a moral standpoint per se, it's simply against the rules and would probably crash runescape as we know it if it was allowed to run rampant. It's already problematic as it is 
---
figures the genius gamers don't even recognize an obvious pasta

Yup. So I play these bots and other games of chance. 
---
Sorry if i‚Äôm wrong but can‚Äôt jagex ip-ban players?

Yeah that is true but eh
---
Nah his account is probably bugged to never receive a barrows set piece. Rest In no Pieces
---
Got to be a special type of 30 IQ brainlet to think its smart to give ANYONE a bunch of money like this. They can just log out, and you're SOL. Why would the gambling bots possibly be fair?
---
Big and they are are alk 2k+ total and mob. You can out war them at times but not easily. And its like all they do. Sit at revs and pk. No one wants to do it all the time but them.
---
Get a team of about 4 people and go to rev caves and kill pvmers and pkers alike. Its more fun in a group eith your stats and your experience lvl with pking. 
---
Attractive female plays Runescape.
---
Your DM's 'bout to explode.

I think it's more that the thing being referenced is so imbalanced that it breaks game balance or gameplay.

Not if you're in combat and have the client open

&gt;jagex drops 200k a year to hire 5 dedicated support guys
---
&gt;every single request is some asshole who definitely botted or demanding his name "weed and pussy420" be reinstated 
---
I get it, jagex. I really do. 
---
If you have high defense there is a different method with super combat potions where you only neet to pot up ever 20 minutes, making it easier to afk.... I do this method at work so I can check my phone 3 times an hour rather than 12 times
---
Could just be unlucky. They're the highest weighting on Konar's task table along side Wyrms and Drakes, so if you might want to block both Wyrms and Drakes, that'll increase your chances.
---
Then they came for me. And nobody spoke out for me, because there was nobody else left. 
---
Pvmers: kill a boss for 1/5k chance at loot

Pvmers: why would pkers kill a player for 1/25 chance at loot

Doesn't seem like you're the brightest person so I'll explain. The screenshot shows I received the Dagannoth REX pet so I made a pun by changing the 'rec' in erection to 'rex'.

Where is the drop table for pyre drops? 
---
no shit sherlock......
---
I said anyone I‚Äôve seen

Blowpipe/craws bow + salve ei + archer ring (i) and if you want to risk a 4th item with protect item, bring pegasians or armadyl helm.

Nah they won‚Äôt lol.

Man i miss RS classic. True nostalgia if i could play that again
---
Man, when I played in 05 06 I used to duo KQ with this guy almost everyday. He was higher level and he would get most kills. We literally never had a chain drop according to him. I bet he just didnt wanna split. Fuck you, new beast76.
---
And this is a reason why I quit. Betterment of the game being held back by politics within the community. Realized pvp was going to remain shitty and left.
---
Yikes. Balls bluer than a baboons ass 
---
Why do you want to gamble away what (presumably) little money you have though?
---
pac-man?
---
How much did he buy you for? Asking for a friend
---
people do not dig through the codes dude, maybe the common ones but not the custom ones. i dont think theres anything sketchy going on with runelite but i can guarantee that this is not the case with other clients and when you guys encourage 3rd party clients new players will try out the other ones as well and get ratted...
---
I get the concept. Im saying the way we say it is ironic. 
---
Do you realize how fucking absurd getting 99 in a skill with lamps is? Someone did the math on it and it was like DECADES iirc. 
---
Depends on their personality. I have attractive friends I would never want to be in a romantic relationship with
---
I like this. Maybe I'd stop cancelling them.
---
Yeah, he just got friend zoned in front of all of us. I feel awful.
---
You're a bloody idiot. You can compile the code yourself and and see it contains no harmful pieces of code...
---
They need to make a point to ban people who trade the bots.  This alone will lower the amount of trades.
---
Nobody speaks out for me because I stand alone.
---
^^^^^^^^^btw
---
Now this is quality
---
They haven't played and made it publicly known it's not worth everyone time  after winning the most of anyone 
---
I wouldn't say that, as you can see in this thread lots of people are actually bragging how they won a few mils, probably causing more people here to go gamble honestly. If it logged when giving just a few mils I doubt that would be the case

Alright so while we're on the partially racist 12yo banter so like do black dudes have big cocks because we bred them to during slave times or because it's just the way that humans evolved in Africa?? Super curious so mods plz dont delete Im not trying to be racist but Ive never gotten a straight answer

oh ye i forgot

Either sarcastic or just plain jealous/stupid. Hope for the former I guess.

Thanks for this. Every one of these should replace the outdated questions in the stronghold

I did get it from there. Security is real annoying but I guess I'd rather it happen when I'm poor than when I have more to lose, assuming I actually get there.

Yeah, it'll go great. In fact, meet me in wildy and bring your bank, there's no way you'll die.

Go fuck yourself you fat nerd
---
This comment is based on the pretense of "people do not dig through the codes" which simply isnt true. You dont understand how revision history works. I am not talking about other client, were talking about runelite.
---
:(
---
Shut up nerd 
---
Remove rev caves/ban every osrs player associated with Rot
---
I just use the word dry to say how far above drop rate I am. So, for a 1/50 item. Being 60 kills without it would be being 10kc dry.

I went 6x dry dude, dw keep going. Did 1750ish KC after the diaries (2750 total) and plucks, so roughly 3500 chances at a 1/500. You'll get it.

...No they didn't. Even back in the day I used swiftkit.

And even if they were, a rule changing wouldn't make all rules useless. Player run games of chance is, today, against the rules and bannable.
---
okay then fml...
---
Poor guy made a friend what a fucking tragedy
---
Even the best skilling moneymakers pale in comparison to high-end PvM.  
---
If you really want to make money... It's going to sound cliche, but do slayer. Level up your combat stats. Slayer lets you do that while making enough money to buy basic equipment. Once you have decent stats, you can make significantly more even doing basic bosses like Zulrah and Vorkath (Not even mentioning raids) than you would from skilling.
---
Got my second whip within half of its drop rate it was very hard to not post for my internet points 
---
One final idea, will need to test this but what if I brought an account with the required mage level to land the blasts and just tagged it with one of the low blast on the other account to get the drop?
---
Lmao just asked about an "intimate dinner spot in NYC" F for the boy

Honestly, it doesn't matter how they meant it, it's the internet!  If you read it as sarcasm, without even considering they meant it in a negative manner, then it makes the internet a much better place to be.

don't you understand that every single new item must look completely out of place from the 2007 era?
---
This is some next level retarded logic 
---
ok double yikes
---
Obviously jmods have it . Hence they will NOT pay this cheater 
---
Some people splash on a Man/Woman NPC and their combat can be interrupted with pickpocketing
---
I love these videos
---
It'll probably be short, as far as i remember this next tier is only 2 bosses.
---
Then vote yes to Warding
---
slayer untrimmed definitely
---
half of the bots are legitimately scams, ran by someone nearby and it automatically ‚Äúloses‚Äù whenever given a large sum of gold for real. the person running it pretends to interact with it and win and lose to make it seem real. 
---
source: had a friend who downloaded a dice bot program, told me about it and offered to let me in (i said no), then got banned on his main because he‚Äôs an idiot. 
---
The things people do for ~~love~~ money.
---
Interesting. Didn't know that
---
Let's hope you hit the 1/1500k Jagex support drop table!! Gl!
---
agreed however jagex could make a bit of an effort to shut these down. and they should do a couple law suits on some of the bigger operations to make an example to get things to calm down. they are only hurting their player base doing nothing about these with newer players falling for this.
---
Feel bad for the idiot who blew platinum on this post 
---
2 years ago, i would have killed for a mcdonald's salary, luckily i earn more than that right now
---
Thank you clearing up all my questions. Hope you have a good day 
---
The only thing still keeping me going is beating the guy who did 2725 dry to be the driest of all time. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/9tq1cu/my_dry_streak_for_the_chompy_pet/
---
If you had more please link photo so i can have a new goal to smash someone into the earth
---
Ya that‚Äôs true, fair enough.
---
However, I would counter that if you‚Äôre already friends with them then they must at least have a good enough personality to warrant the friendship.
---
Thank you for contacting jagex support!!!!!!! Did you know you can submit a bug report while in game!? Please do that and we will review it. Thank you :)
---
revs is a multi combat area in the wilderness, so people pay them to not have 50 people instantly butt  fuck them while they do rev content
---
In other words, he wasn't good enough looking.

Mutated dark beasts, drop a dark crossbow which is a lvl 70 crossbow that has a special attack that fires 2 dragon heads that act similarly to a morigans javaleib

q
---
Just because you used it back in the day, it was still against the rules. Plus unless you are breaking the rules hardcore they will not ban you. Look at the pvp lum area. Bots for days
---
Why don‚Äôt the people just switch worlds then?
---
1/512 not 1/256 so ~1/3.3m &gt;_&gt;

hes just looking for a good time.

you're a fuckin moron lmao
---
"player run bots who i trade money and they roll a dice behind the curtains are totally legit bro"
---
His account is fucked, that‚Äôs it. Once you do this to yourself, there‚Äôs so recovering (no pun intended) from it.
---
If the community wants it, sure.
---
Escorting isn't really frowned upon that much anymore
---
But fr upvoted. I'd be devastated. Hope it works out for you man. :(
---
When I'm bored
---
How do you see those layouts for killcount stuff?
---
These memes never actually get old, they only get better 
---
God this is one of my biggest fears good luck dude 
---
In a game with fucking magic, I'm sure they could stack hay bales and make it into a dozen floors at least. 
---
For all those saying "phished or account sharing" i made this account my self a long time ago, i've spent many years playing this one and only account i own, im maxed on rs3 and close to maxing on oldschool with over a YEAR of game time between the OSRS AND RS3. i would be devastated if i lost the account. to further clarify the account was not hacked, it was hijacked, someone recovered the account and changed the account email to an unfamiliar email adresss. on my end there was no tampering no confirmation email stating that i changed the email address. 
---
Google "When I'm bored" on YouTube
---
its probably one of the best updates put into the game, go get some friends and give pking at revs a try. super fun and pretty low barrier for entry.
---
The truth of the matter is that if Jagex were smart they'd have either never opened the door or now shut the door on replying to support posts on reddit. Their guidance used to be "account problems are only to be done privately through official channels between the player and Jagex" but now that they've responded we get people thinking it's really the only way to contact support.
---
Well then they're using their money wrong because it's hard not to enjoy life on a jet ski. I'm gettin a kick out of all the uneducated nobodies getting butthurt because they didn't do anything with their life and now they're not just sad, they're also poor.
---
Come on bro I got 66

armadyl tassets look sick asf. wish we had that skirt over the original one anyday

Afaik, they won‚Äôt employee open homosexuals. (Which I‚Äôm not sure how that comes up in an interview)
---
Brimstone has an effect where it ignores 10% of the enemy's magic defence 25% of the time, this works out to be equivalent to roughly +10 or +11 magic bonus against monsters that you'd consider using a seers ring against.
---
Well if it's causing it, then yes you would.
---
Ok
---
A moment of silence for the guy that just got bro zoned 
---
Because they might as well be a bayonet on your hands as far as their stats go
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure having to type it in on the screen protects against keyloggers.
---
i don't remember the pricing i think its a flat rate for a week of protection. 
---
they're getting paid to do something *they would be doing anyway* is what you're missing. its less risky and more sustainable long term than probably any other money making method in the game.
---
pretty pointless doing them though at max combat, and there aren't many to a task so low chance of superiors
---
Honestly, I think that while there‚Äôs no explicit rule against it, this 100% qualifies as disruptive gameplay due to the highly organized nature of it. 
---
No, it's an actual artist's name :D
---
In a legal standpoint they are not allowed to accept/deny based off of sexuality, race, or gender. 
---
The issue was that the CEO promoted homophobic activity, but that doesn't mean each individual franchise owner believed the same as well.
---
It‚Äôs Sunday homie they‚Äôre off
---
They usually make less then minimum wage to so I'd be careful with "legitimate source of income"
---
I'd lick your teeth and make a wet spot in my trousers.
---
He didn't flee the county, you moron. He was using a VPN.
---
:( i know man i didn't believe this shit till it happened to me
---
To add on to that, since he obviously doesn‚Äôt play OSRS, Sparc Mac reconsiders giving him a reward because he only plays rs3. 
---
Why does everyone hate Hatius?
---
Jagex doesn't ban for account sharing so ypu are wrong. 
---
So your ISP has not changed anything within a couple of years?
---
&gt;locks out revenants at a 2.2k world and charges from people to enter there, since they can't win any Deadman tournaments without cheating.
---
tbh it's funny to me that they're okay with this considering how many RS rules there are against "meta" stuff
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea...
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre posting here if you‚Äôre just waiting on your recovery request?
---
thanks man i hope we all have full control and security of our own accounts 
---
I know the creator of one of these bots. They are multiple people running these bots, there's a different variety in them. 
---
The one who created that bot made is semi-rigged. The account gets automatically replaced with a brand new one if it gets banned. Really nothing can be done about it unless they deal with them by automatically muting them or something. 
---
You're pretty new. That's not your fault. What is your fault is speaking with both ignorance and confidence.
---
&gt; its not rigged, its just that they have higher % of winning
---
??????????????????????????????
---
You can't change your IP while also staying connected to the internet, the network connection has to be reset which would disconnect players from deadman. Also, even if it was possible to change IPs without disconnecting nobody is going to be able to do that mid-PVP
---
She admitted to having fucked the 40 year old sugar daddy in LA and proceeds to post her face on here lmao 
---
Yikes
---
i created the account myself in my parents house when i was a kid im in my  early 20s right now, none of my other real world emails and bank info has been leaked or hacked etc.. so im just confused 
---
My guess is it's because of the DTS time change from earlier today.
---
Thanks, it worked.
---
Small sample size, but all of my immediate friend group are fit dudes that play the game. Most popular streamers also aren‚Äôt ‚Äú800lb men.‚Äù

---
No you would need to stoop to their level. 
---
Think of them like a bunch of autistic 4chan edge lords who can and will break the law just to make a point.
---
They will be conniving, and will social engineer situations to get what they want.
---
Beating them on RS is only part of the battle.
---
Because being stupid has gotten RoT pretty far so far, so why not? Lemmings get a nice view when they jump from a cliff together. 
---
I'll play devil's advocate here....with the current state of the sub, who's to say OP isn't posting this for Karma? We know posts like this get lots of upvotes (because the community wants the staff to see it, which is a separate issue itself...) But he provided no proof...which to be fair if he did he'd probably get jacked again.,..ohh jagex 
---
Pois√© kkkkkk, pelo menos no meu caso, quando eu compro a assinatura, n√£o pago direto para a Jagex, e sim compro atrav√©s de uns packages do site BoaCompra, que tem os planos mensais em real, sen√£o teria que pagar em d√≥lares mesmo.
---
Map isn't 100% up to date and isn't correctly labelled (Runescape instead of Gielinor?), but I still decided it was a necessity and snatched it up. 
---
Even if yall spec out every member they have days worth of return sets and will be back momentarily. Even if the hundred rot members rushed the 300 and all died eventually theyll start knocking out people. In a matter of 20 mins it would get to the point where the pvmers are returning just to get barraged then piled and its over lol. Even so if pvmers were able to clear rot what will they do? Hold the wildy down lmao people would get bored and were back to square 1
---
He has abandoned this subreddit long ago. 
---
With a name like that anybody gets more pussy than you do, good observation 
---
The gate changed ahead of the final, so it was possible to guess without corruption. Not saying that that's necessarily what happened, though.
---
im desperate man im literally devastated. i love this game so much and i always come back. ive done everything possible for ensure account security
---
lol gf your account+bow
---
You will still get racks with 3 skeletons. 
---
what do you mean by "worth"?
---
from an efficiency standpoint clues are fucking dogshit and never worth doing. 
---
however, i'd still say for you its worth buying if you ever plan on training wc, infernal axe makes wc slightly more afk if you do an afk method and its 0 time fm xp.
---
sounds like a slag tbf
---
I knew that. Not interesting 
---
Does that mean using on screen keyboard protects a unique password?
---
as long as its the same account/login info, yes.
---
This is not a dating site.
---
Cars have tires
---
Runelite has a built in screen screencap, just click the camera at the top.

Instead you upload it, crop it online, and re-download it... how do you make it through a day?

It is fun trying to spot all the places you can do it. That is for sure.
---
There's a theshold where trident becomes better than Ibans or fire wave. I'm not sure but I think it's 85 but someone is welcome to chime in, as for rewards you shouldn't be going over 88% , this is because at that point you start getting bolt racks in place of runes and the runes are generally more expensive. Also your chance of barrows pieces doesn't go up anymore 
---
thank you so much man i hope this is resolved and we can all have full control of our accounts and have them properly secured 
---
*Skips*
---
Was she whole when you first met?
---
To counteract your point.. streamers (public figures) most likely won‚Äôt become famous if they‚Äôre fat ugos. But I agree. 
---
Yes 
---
trident is good on all the melee brothers and kairl. you'll want to range ahrim. 88% reward potential is highest profit/hour.
---
pool between each run and telly back to barrows with the telly tab. bank when you run out of supplies.
---
Well you can use them for easy points as you don't get many or extend them and AFK for over an hour just repot/p pot

I met my internet friend of like 7 years in NYC this past October!! True friendships happen in the coolest ways! 
---
TLDR.
---
Not in here to read novels 
---
i submitted an account recovery, tweeted at support and im posting a regular support ticket as we speak thanks for the info!
---
LLOOOL thats so funny I might actually be able to train hunter without relying on lamps and birdhouses
---
Don‚Äôt be so pessimistic! It should be here as soon as 2033!
---
i love the dislikes from people not actually watching the video
---
So what's your name, what do you do and where do you live? Links to any social media?
---
And how can I contact your dad?
---
Predictible. At what point does this sub get kinda of upvoting literally anything with this video copy pasted at the end... 
---
Yes, judging by how this sub responds to pvp
---
Good suggestion, the design is related to in-game content and it actually looks nice 
---
"I log out daily with nothing on my character"
---
Sounds like you are taking a precaution because you possibly bought the account at one point? 
---
It's probably apparent by now why people avoid making these personal posts here, especially women. This subreddit is full of incel royalty. I'm glad that you seem to be okay with people responding this way and investigating your entire reddit history, but in the end, it's just sad.
---
Why not just update the armor and leave ornament kits out, there‚Äôs already a lot. We don‚Äôt want people questioning all these armors and confusing them. Just update the armor to look like the ornament kit. Looks way better &amp; it doesn‚Äôt look like I have my chest al over the damn place 
---
Not sure if intended but your link puts us 545 seconds into the vid already
---
Got burnt out of spamming magic training so I hopped to f2p and hunted down genuine looking noobs close to 40 attack and gave them each a rune scimitar. 10 done now. I suppose I ought to get back to work. 
---
i was going to, but then i saw this post
---
I had a master clue stuck on that step for a while too. If 1.8m isn‚Äôt a huge expenditure for you then go for it. You will then have it for any future master clues. You might get lucky and earn it back. Average loot for masters is like 400k anyways so that will help the price. Also it‚Äôs not too bad to train wc with
---
Nice lol
---
&gt;they make a ton of money locking this world

About half of minimum wage in any first world country

50/50, they either reply or they don't

Ncs YouTube channel, monstercat too but that's more varied

I got the head the other day and did it on a slayer task for 2-3 kills a trip.

And then a blowpipe + Ava for the range switch.

Recover your account?
---
Also https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/205982841 might be helpful.
---
Give him another chance 
---
Way too similar to OG to be an ornament kit, I like your design better tho tbh 
---
All currency is imaginary.
---
Cos they ain't him
---
Are you going for Desert elite diary? I am.. same drop rate as the head, that would annoy me!
---
Protects it from a keylogger but not other viruses 
---
I did a little research, so there is definitely some research to back up that people of African decent typically had a larger penis, though the difference is much smaller than it‚Äôs typically made out to be (around 5% larger than those with european-descent) 
---
Why the difference remains is still up for debate. The most popular theory is that areas where there was more competition for men to find a mate, showed men to developer larger genitals.
---
 
---
Why make two oopsies and mess with the Jagex staff? Accept the consequences, 83 Mule Cow!
---
They also said very clearly, "what other hairstyles would you even want us to add?" Then went on to joke about adding Kim-Jong-Uns hair.
---
That particular request isn't ever going to be added because hairstyles are A. covered by helmets you can't remove via transmog and B. there are only so many things you can do with OSRS hairstyles. Waddya want neo nazi spikes and other Tony Hawk proskater 2 options?
---
Jagex has made it clear that OSRS has limited development because RS3 is still the main game. OSRS is the side kid who has been way more popular for years now but Jagex themselves don't make enough money to switch to OSRS as a monetization model. So they keep RS3 as their flagship. Plus it's the culmination of 20 years of accounts, you can still have your old RSC character transferred from RSC to RS then RS to RS2 then RS2 to RS3 and it's still the same character.
---
OSRS is also poorly optimized and using network encoding from 2007 and prior. They've done their best to update it but it's like fixing a library after a hurricane, shit's a mess. They also just simply have a way smaller team, if they work on OSRS you've seen them at some point on the Q&amp;A. There are no hidden workers for OSRS, we know them all.
---
Sorry for my tangent, I just didn't feel they decided to not add hairstyles due to development issues. They decided against it because its inconsequential and a waste of time to limited resources. Even if they had triple the amount of staff they still aren't adding hairstyles until they add removable(cosmetically removeable, you still get the stats) helmets. I don't think xmog's are ever passing a poll even if everyone can toggle it off. Its iconic to RS that you know what someone is wearing if they have it on.(in WoW/PoE someone could be wearing ilvl 32 green gear and look like Hades just got back from a biker bar)
---
A unique bank pin, yes, but if it‚Äôs easily guessed then not really.
---
Upvote for visibility, weird glitch/bug tho
---
How did RoT leverage Jed anyway? What possible interest did he have in breaking the rules for RoT? I can‚Äôt imagine any reason for having that degree of clan loyalty.
---
I've seen so many people try to play up their bots at the G.E., it's laughable how bad they are at hamming it up.
---
Lumbridge man bad.
---
Lol...
---
I see you have no idea what the player base is.
---
Even watching rune fest streams you can see the average group is between 25 and 40.
---
And of that a majority are in fine physical health.
---
Sure there are heavy people but even then that doesn't mean they don't buy stuff.
---
So go buzz off
---
Then he says ‚Äúbro‚Äù. And you just teleport away.. horrific
---
When rl goes down rs3 has more active players. We live in a society.
---
Just pile into the al Kharid castle ‚Äúon accident‚Äù right or was it a lucky guess I can‚Äôt remember what the bs excuse was. 
---
Is that aviansie already ingame? I suggest we remove it, if so. 
---
And add in they made it so you can trigger threshes and ults automatically, you literally lose only like .01% of damage against non-boss monsters, yeh. RS3 combat... *sigh* I do kind of miss the stupidly over-the-top mele animations, but other than that, it was kind of dumb. ESPECIALLY freedom / anticipatescape bullshit. It rendered freezes pointless in pvp and most bosses use that shit too, so you cannot even use them there. It is...lame. This is coming from a guy that beat Telos, AoD with a group, etc. Just kind of felt like playing a different game. I like the nostalgic feel of OSRS combat better. 
---
Lmao rates are under $1 per mil these days. Theyre probably averaging 3-4m/hr at best. Craws bow is a tenth of the price it used to be. 
---
Same thing happened to me. Op try this if not already
---
no i do this fully out of habit and precaution, ive seen many vids of people getting hacked/hijacked. plus i have more than enough proof of when i made the account as well as where. 
---
I69D TRUMP was a forced name change...? 
---
Jamflex getting soft
---
Upvoted. I really hope you get lucky and hit Jagex Support..
---
i did this when a friend made that video a while ago and i was fully safe and i just did it again i haven no leaked information thankfully
---
Seriously what is fucking wrong with people here, can people not just take a feel good story and appreciate it? Why is everyone on the attack about his teeth and spamming friendzone? Most of you probably look like swamp monsters as is.
---
She can nurture my genitals if you catch my drift
---
Gl, had 1.5B taken s few weeks ago with all security needed. Hope you get into it. 
---
Sick thanks
---
Ty bro
---
I'm going to the Arizona Ren Fair next week. This wouldn't happened to have come from there, did it?
---
Wtf is that logic. "Pointless to do them at Max combat"??! Do you think every monster in the game should be catered to Max combat? With that logic vorkath, zulrah, Cox, any single method in the game is "pointless" because ToB is Max gp/hr.
---
Updoots to the left! Thanks leopold :)
---
They have gotten a lot better over the years. Mainly due to lawsuits. It was 10+ years ago they got in hot water for doing things like firing people because they were gay. They used their platform and income to lobby against LGBT and birth control. Its fine with me the family owning it having their beliefs but they used the Chick fil a franchise to very vocally protest these issues and it really rubbed me the wrong way. They used their profits to donate to causes I do not believe in, and still do, so i choose not to give my money to them.
---
Wahh I was a smart ass and don't want to deal with the consequences.
---
it really doesn't matter much. you get more runes by being slightly over than slightly under
---
The snide and contempt with which you tried to put down someone's well-developed constructive criticism is not just sad; it's downright pathetic.
---
3 skeletons gets you bolt racks
---
He ignored a clue scroll on the ground at the beginning! I used to farm clues from goblins sometimes get up to 1m rewards 
---
Actual moron you are man you dont have many real life experiences with this type of shit huh LOL
---
i dont know how to post proof without giving away any information at this point im terrified to say my RSN because it may be targeted. 
---
Yes both the hunter and fishing can be boosted (had the clue and boosted myself)
---
For the entire method he's likely using, including the program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0huAx4pGSk
---
You know the email on his account was changed?
---
Are you leaving to get Slayer tasks? What if they aren't in kourend? Is it still catacomb onky at this point? Have you planned this any?
---
no but my heart was :(
---
&gt;they‚Äôre literally printing money right now
---
Lol any minimum wage job could double or triple what they make slaving revs. 
---
There is no way people are paying them anything good to use these worlds considering 2200 total mains can just camp vorkath for more money, without paying a fee. Craws bow is a tenth of the price it used to be.
---
Ya dun goofed
---
It's not a twitter conspiracy theory when it's confirmed by the company that had employed him lol
---
Says the guy who has coon in his name. White knight racist lmao get a grip 
---
Read LeopoldMassalah‚Äôs comment. It is likely an authenticator glitch.
---
LOL. I enjoyed the reference, despite all the bitter down votes you got for it
---
no. but they need 90 slayer and one of the most annoying and difficult quests to access them, so at that point most people are going to be very high combat. you only get given a small task of them, so the exp is shit and the money is shit. they drop nothing and you spend more on ppots fighting them. 
---
they're also not weak to ranged or mage so you can only really melee them, which also sucks.
---
What does that mean?
---
several hundred and it's more like it's embezzlement and abuse of private consumer information 
---
this is never happened to me ive never had to recover my account or any account ever i dont know how the process goes after i submit. so im just like posting everywhere to hopefully have a fast result im free on sunday so im just looking for any possible avenue to get this resolved.
---
Cannon and Trident. 
---
An ip will not change in the US unless your router is off for a week. I had the same ip for 5 years before I moved. 
---
Exactly.  If people would stop looking at the situation like its game breaking, rather than part of the game it would be so much better.  The fact that rot are so powerful that other clans pay them for services is quite impressive.  Instead of bitching about something that is not against the rules, you would think the people complaining would try and stop them rather than crying about it.
---
Anyone you see give money to the bots is running the bot or in a scam clan running the bot to try to influence everyone around that's its tootally real. If a regular person traded the bot the minimum amount, it instantly logs out. 
---
Anti virus should cover you from most things right?
---
Like a big cupboard full of seeds
---
It doesn't come up in an interview because it can't. While I worked at CFA, 2 of my managers were openly gay, and 4 others I worked along side were also gay/bi-sexual. They we're never treated differently. Loved that job, and made life long friends while I worked there.
---
However, yeah, the CEO used to support/still supports some organizations that have anti-gay stances, which is sad.
---
Yeah I could have finished it 5 times by now
---
Awesome thanks 
---
Make any new friends on osrs recently who‚Äôve gotten to know you personally? Using an old email?
---
Chances are someone socially engineered your security questions and your password got leaked from a data breach within the last few years. That‚Äôs really the only way it could happen with all that account security 
---
You‚Äôre extremely guillable for believing them. There are much better money makers available to 2200 total mains who access the worlds, without even factoring in the fee they would have to pay. 
---
&gt;ironmen
---
it does matter though, getting a couple more runes on average doesn't outweigh having a rune drop replaced with bolt racks
---
Now I know what I'm doing today
---
What client is that?
---
Y'all look related. Also he's not got good facial structure just over weight 
---
Ha, yes it is. You'll have to suicide soon.
---
Usually it's cause i shit myself awake. It's a natural alarm clock
---
Just do what rwt accounts do and not farm the gold back if they don‚Äôt help sort it. That‚Äôs if you continue playing, and don‚Äôt mind going about it that way.
---
I'm praying mine won't be that bad.
---
Oh
---
yeah i read it but its telling me that my accounts email is one that i dont recognize or have any idea how it became the account email. no emails to the old email (which is mine) confirming the email change.
---
I just want the pet 4.7k kc now, in the last 1k i got 6 serp vissy, 4 tanz fang, 3 magic fang and 3 onyx...... i'd be happy to trade
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt really think about the backlash I would get but I don‚Äôt mind it. It comes with the territory of Reddit lol, I had fun with my friend and I have a real life outside of the internet so it doesn‚Äôt really bother me. 
---
There's literally a scam version that steals your account on the top of the search results 
---
Someone better save this thread before it gets nuked lmao
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs use is as good as that! Thanks!
---
im  sorry to hear man i dont understand how this can happen. i hope my situation doesn't end up that way

Why not sand crabs tho? Similar afk levels with more xp at a lower cost

If they're a low level, trade them repeatedly until you've lured them to the dark wizards.

You say this like it's some established business and not a bot that'll be banned and recreated in 24h or can just hop worlds when people start calling it out for scamming
---
The one form of actually healthy for the game MTX, so not relevant.

Yeah thats the joke
---
Yea if I had $150k+ worth of osrs GP on my account I wouldn't flaunt it.
---
nice, this way a keylogger could take your bank pin, and in some pvp scenarios people could attack you while the interface is up and you would type your pin into chat. Might also work if someone used a bond on you as the interface was open. Sounds secure :)
---
Piss off. Was what I said was wrong? The only variable here was getting damaged more by pvp than pvm. You are the prick.

an ornament kit doesn't change the design completely of a piece, usually it gives it small changes such as colours etc

So you're a RuneScape cartoon foot fetishist artist now? Not that you weren't before, but now you've pegged yourself down as one?

Luckily you have a bank pin, i didnt which hurt. I did have w JMOD ban the accounts who took my items so they didnt profit in the end. Hope yours goes better

you having a laugh? even if that was true, there's loads of taller buildings in RS

They don't have to do it, keep demanding things and you will start losing what they give you. Being scared for your account is on you at least half the post for hacked accounts are false on this site anyway.

Head back to the mud pit and hang a left. As you walk down the alleyway there, the map station is going to be on your left-hand side. It's a small wooden stand, so it's easy to miss! &lt;3

When did I demand anything? I made a suggestion sheesh

Black people are 3% of the population in Britain so the vast majority of applicants were probably white.
---
The way he describes it and how his issue was timed exactly with the 2-FA issue makes me think that he probably forgot that that email even existed, which is why he refers to it as being "unfamiliar".
---
Holy crap, thanks! The mud pit is where the wild men show is, right?

If players are dumb enough to do stuff like this then they prob aren‚Äôt 13+ to play the game in the first place. Perfect example of Darwinism

Nothing will ever happen to Sparc, he's a high profile player so his account is probably watched a lot more than any other general player. Not to mention he was caught scamming back in the old days of RS (2010-ish I'd like to say) and not only was he never reprimanded but he was also accused of RWTing money to buy his Mustang and Jagex never did anything. (Suspicion was after he posted a bank video showing his last tab to be barebones in comparison to what his wealth should have been at the time, then he removed deleted the vid and reuploaded one where he didn't show his bank tab)

No you don't get more runes, that 0.1% rolls bolt racks which takes the place of a rune stack. You do not want ANYTHING over 88%. Especially if you're an ironman where the runes are infinitely more valuable than bolt racks ever will be.
---
That's not the official runelite website or client, that'd be like trying to download the official Runescape client from a scam website and then claiming that the official runelite client is trying to scam you out of your account details.

Use runelite.

So what‚Äôs the phone number for customer support? Or link to a live chat with them to resolve my issue? Why did I have to send in a false ticket under billing to get an account unbanned because there was no way to explain that it was hacked, even though they sent me a message to my inbox saying they locked it due to suspicious activity 6 hours before it got perm‚Äôed?
---
got hacked like 3 weeks ago, lost around 150m~ wasnt  maybe much but got me to quit again lmfao

It‚Äôs different for everyone, good effort tho

This right here. You need a group of mains to fight Rot, not some pures the streamer created for videos.

Now it would be impressive to have all of the streamers mains go on at once and fight Rot, that would be a great video/stream.

I don't know seems more like an established business to me than that. Why steal people's money when as you can see so many people are perfectly willing to just give it away

And separate Swampletics memes while you're at it. Shit got old weeks ago.

Either way, just not in the app.

thats why some niche level 20 gear wouldnt be so bad would most likely make it the most expensive of the 3 sets aka the most desirable pieces to get from the clues

sweden and norway are more capitalist then socialist, they also dont even have 1/10 of americas population, and they also limit migrating there (so basically they are completely opposite of america).  You can not use them for an example on why something might work
---
Sorry son, I don't need your patronage. I'm an ironman. Seriously. I think you need to rethink your attitude here. For starters, if you've spoken to, traded with or worked with a non ironman, you are scum. Your achievements amount to nothing whatsoever, in fact they are simply a waste of time. Frankly it's disgusting. Maxing an ironman takes dedication and a special type of autism. Maxing a normal account is for people with down syndrome. Get off this site kid no one wants to see your "account" and your shitty buyable items. I worked for Every. Single. Fucking. Tick. To max my ironman.. Now that's a real achievement.. Go start up an ironman, ultimate or hardcore if you'd like. Max it and then show me your shit again. Nothing personal, ironman btw 
---
if you hit on the same tick as another account in a multi area, regardless of whether you hit or not you get half xp when it dies, as it counts as you dealing the final 'blow'. for singles tasks you just venom it on main (with serp/bp) and hit the final hit before the npc dies (again, doesn't matter if it's a 0). there are a lot more intricacies to the method but that's a very basic overview. it's slow but not as slow as you'd think, probably averaging upwards of 10k/hr with optimised alts and block list etc.

2 skeletons 1 bloodworm is normally the way to go.

That and going with a simple darker color scheme does not seem worthy of being called an ornament kit. 
---

---
&gt; should i be going for 100% on rewards?  
---
TL;DR don't go for 100%. Get close to 87% for best rewards. Exact explanation below.
---
You shouldn't be going for 100%, as it actually gives worse rewards on average due to allowing bolt racks as a drop, which are lower in value than chaos, death and blood runes, which is where most of your money comes from besides the high value uniques, and you also take more time per run meaning you get less runs done per hour.
---
Rewards potential is based on combat level of everything you kill, including the brothers, plus 2x brothers killed, with the maximum amount being 1012. The ideal amount which gives you the chance to gain the maximum amount of blood runes with 0% chance for bolt racks is 880 / 1012 = 86.9% potential, but it doesn't need to be exact every time, being close to this value is good enough, and being slightly lower is better than being slightly higher because higher gives you a chance for a really low amount of bolt racks.
---
6 brothers adds up to 656 combat level, plus 2x brothers killed is another 12 for 668 reward potential, which means you need another 212 total combat from stuff in the tunnels to get 880, which is obtainable by killing 3 bloodworms and 1 crypt spider.  
---
There are several ways to get very close to this value, and it is probably better because it's usually quicker, while the potential gain from getting exactly 880 reward potential is minimal because there's no guarantee you'll get the maximum reward anyway.
---
2 skeletons and a bloodworm or crypt spider or crypt rat work, as well as 4 bloodworms, though skeletons are easier if you have a salve amulet. Some people suggest 3 skeletons and there's nothing "wrong" with that if it's convenient for you, but just be aware that a low amount of bolt racks is a potential reward which could have been a large amount of blood runes instead.  
---
&gt; Is Trident of the Seas really good to use for most of the Brothers?  
---
Trident of the Seas is definitely worth using if you have it. I used to think Iban's Blast was straight up better because it's max hit is higher than Seas until 90 magic, and it's slightly cheaper per cast, but the trident attacks every 2.4s while other spells cast every 3.0s, so that makes it's DPS higher even though it's max hit is lower.  
---
If you can get the Swamp that's also worth using. Supply costs are higher, but you do more runs per hour so that makes up for it, and killing the bosses quick enough can mean you sometimes don't get the prayer draining effect and therefore save on prayer pots.
---
---  
---
&gt; I have ornate rejuve pool and all that
---
Since you have an ornate pool you're better off using house and barrow tabs after each run, it'll cost less to regen than drinking prayer pots, plus run energy is useful.

Yah... If we get an Orn Kit, it should be the other Model ingame and not this.

I think the problem is that they are account sharing to lock it down. Not so much them locking it down.
---
Tires have cars, nice try though
---
it does off when your account was created, not osrs.  I know mine goes back wayy longer then that lol

I'm pretty sure he says the age of your account, not specifically when osrs was first created

And then re-dropping it to watch them try to pick it up

Make it flashier, solid gold with silver trim. Get rid of the wings.

I need to do this more

Can you guess what I‚Äôm thinking about your mind-reading balls?

Not hard to hardware spoof either.  It's also not difficult to run the game in a virtual environment and spoof all hardware configurations.

He‚Äôs not ugly, just out of shape. Meanwhile this girl is very pretty and seemingly fit. Hence the 2-4 score difference.

I don't participate in "trust trades" or dicing or anything of the sort, never been scammed.

the darkness is just the lighting from jagex's model program but the wings aren't much of a difference compared to gold trim on dragon equipment

also hes a btw, so you'd have to drop trade a whole bunch of shit worth 50gp lmao.

Except you know nothing of their friendship or intentions from an inside perspective. Reading comments on reddit isn't even scraping the surface of a person, let alone 2. And if you were upset because an adult had sex with another adult consensually, you've got some maturing to do.

I hate recolours, however this one is subtle and at least not a red blue green recolour.

I'm pretty sure a higher number only increases the amount of runes/racks you get rather than increasing their chance of appearing.

JaGeX would never e-mail you and be like "Hey bud, we think you RWT'd, can you clear this up for us?".

I had one of those. It‚Äôs not a phish if you don‚Äôt click on the link you‚Äôll have your account locked and it‚Äôs a hassle to get it back.

I always run with 2 skeles and 1 worm/small rat. It gets me close to 88 for max runes but not over, so no bolt racks

My dad uses it lol refers to a football kicker kicking the ball too far to where the ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù team can‚Äôt get to the person receiving the ball quick enough aka the guy in this scenario is the kicker who kicked the ball really far/did better than expected. I think it‚Äôs hilarious

nah, we have enough high tier range weapons.
---
Thanks for your actual email on here
---
It's roughly 33% higher DPS than the crystal bow so it's definitely an upgrade.
---
While it might not be a massive dbow sink it'll still help increase the value of the dark bow and it makes sense that this weapon would require the dbow to be made if it wants to use the unique double arrow feature it has.
---
Also not sure how the crystal bow ragging issue is relevant here and why it's on OP to mention it in his suggestion. It should be as easy as making it always drop on death in the wilderness similar to the rune pouch and/or increase its attack speed similar to the blowpipe.
---
Uhh, they're not on the Defence wiki pages either, like:

It still changes nothing, if your player A and you play normal and work for your gold to buy bandos tassets and player B buys bonds and gets bandos tassets instantly, it changes absolutely nothing about your personal game experience. Because that is player B‚Äôs experience and he is playing the game separately from you. 
---
Osrs isn‚Äôt a game based on winning, it‚Äôs a game based on person experience, and someone else buying bonds does not edit or affect your personal experience. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt matter.
---
On top of that they allow for a player to never have to pay real money for membership because you can make money in game and buy a bond, which is nothing more than a benefit. 
---
I dont hate jagex for this, I blame you.

Wtf super sets too

Thanks for the explanation. It‚Äôs still difficult for me to comprehend, frankly. I knew that RWTs had a surprising degree of power, but infiltrating Jagex itself is a whole other level.

its okish but bp outshines it in most content however theres a new quest coming up with a potential upgrade to crystal bow

You said it pretty sarcastically. But again, I took these images from the wiki so if its a big problem for anyone, they can take their hands and block the crazy boots themselves :)

Better to get it passively imo
---
sure
---
he does. Usually has a giveaway every few streams. Generally gives away multiple elys, rapiers, sometimes scythes. Lots of smaller items like Claws and Bandos sets too.
---
But they are already scamming. They are not a charity giving out free money. So them just logging off with your money wouldn't really matter nor do they even need to do that as they can just simply say you lost.
---
yeah the guy is a solid 3, if he lost some weight and got a nice hair cut and actualy dressed better he would be a solid 6 no problem, and the girl is at best 6.
---
OP is saying how when logs are on the ground and you right click them, you get the option to take or light them. They want the same for bones, to take or bury them.
---
If they beg to leave them, instantly kill. If they say accept it and say GG I let them live
---
hes a solid 3 in that photo, if he lost some weight, got a haircut and dressed better he can easy be a solid 6-7

Some inkling as to your current progress would probably help us make suggestions for you ;)

Awesome, thank you!

This is your father. I am disappoint.

Wind strike is super cheap. Pro tip: if you use an ait staff, you only need mind runes.
---
Best as in kills per hour or Best for the cost? Kills per hour yes fire surge tome etc. For cost slayer dart with enchanted slayer staff
---
Reported for consuming illegal substances. Gf your account.
---
Lol
---
Get base 70s
---
it's like tbow spawn was working incredibly effectively to provide tbows for the community but at the same time it was clearly broken af
---
Imagine thinking that RoT still plays DMM 
---
Is this true?
---
Mainly Kills per hour, but I want to try to break even or get close like bursting tasks do. 
---
100% would D spear her

Would be worth the fires runes to low alch you man.
---
Holy crab! what a good idea!

I met up with a friend on Runescape I've known for 7-8 years for NYE,  it was the best night of my life. Never experienced anything like it. It was so unreal yet so real, incredibly unique experience.
---
You're right. Going 143 dry happens to 1/8000 people, going 103 dry happens to like 1/450 people. Quite a significant difference :P
---
Hmmm, so it was probably fake anyway
---
‚ÄúA true bro‚Äù that‚Äôs a hard friend zone lol

Haha concern trolling funny hahah

Back in the day rot actually had competition from other big clans, who would fight each other several times a week for hours on end.

Unfortunately in the past couple of years, the clan world has very much died down.
---
You're my favorite customer.
---
Just completed a few weeks ago. A little over 11 here heh
---
Prayer seems good to me for piety, but i dont know a steady money making method for the dbones
---
Get base 50s then 60s then 70s, and obviously barrows gives and a fire cape
---
I mean it is annoying af lol
---
People don't have a good intuitive understanding of statistics. They see 45/100 odds and think "Hey that's almost 50/50 sounds good!" without realizing that the longer the play the more likely it is that they'll lose money
---
The bots will make much more money slowly draining these gambling addicts than they would by just logging out after somebody places a bet
---
Kill dragons for them.
---
Did you even read the goddamn comment? There were tons of people who were falsely banned, CS refused to help, and they had to post on reddit to get devs' attention to get unbanned
---
What part of that implies that they were toxic? Can you fucking read? How about you just neck yourself and fuck off already you fucking blizzard fanboy faggot
---
Cannon my dude
---
Never
---
You don't need to tribrid all at once, [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTmeHb2R6Js) explains how to kill all 3 one by one. I has slightly better stats when I started doing that but it really isn't hard, you should be fine. You probably want 75 magic for trident though.
---
ok thanks, i figured 75 att wouldnt be too big of a deal because i would want to go bridding too deep wildy. I think im just gonna go for it and if i have a couple extra levels fuck it its not a huge deal

That's not socialism though. Nordic countries are socialist, Venezuela very much is not.

my fav thing about revs and other crowded multi spots is i can do stuff with friends and accounts that i would *never* bring to stuff like pvm due to stats or skill level and still have a blast with them.

One of many 
---
Investing in this one
---
I know jagex staff is busy and its not time efficiant to just go around and ban them, but atleast one a week the cheating specialist should go to the worlds and ban these and other type of spaming bots at the GE, yeah its not efficiant, BUT to average player seeing that in action and not seeing spaming bots LOOKS way better then thousands of bans behind the scenes, thats why bot busting streams are so succesfull and make players feel like jagex is actualy doing somthing about bots even if in thos streams its few hundred bots banned at best, when in reality they ban thousands outside of game in that amount of time.
---
but to an average player it looks way better, just for that reason jagex should dedicate some time for that.
---
Certainly not for hellhounds. I'd recommend just using proselyte, ardy cloak and praying melee.
---
Account sharing isn't a thing you get banned for these days, unless you buy inferno cape or compete for hiscores
---
I would love to see a 99 attack Vs. 99 defense stake though
---
I agree :D!
---
Oh yeah and that special attack that binds your opponent at random times. 
---
Persevered and got on my first game and killed the queen!

Devalues my ornament kit

Goldfarmers and bots

They‚Äôd be a cool addition,  but the passive def lowering spec that would randomly proc was much too op
---
Non-rooftop agility courses (replaced by rooftops), earth warriors/axe hut for afk combat (replaced by nmz), wilderness rune rocks (replaced by mining guild, myth guild due to bank proximity/safety), harpooning sharks (replaced by minnows).

It's called a joke

It doesn't matter if you do bone voyage as you can block those wyverns without using a slot. The only ones that could be a good idea to avoid are elemental workshop (skeletal wyverns), contact! (scabarites) and dragon slayer because if you don't start it you won't be assigned any type of dragon (dragon tasks are pretty much universally bad), you will miss out on barrows gloves but that has no effect on slayer because you should be using the slayer bracelets the whole time.
---
It is worth noting that you get an extra block slot for every 50 quest points as well as 1 more block slot for completing lumbridge elite diary which requires quest cape.
---
256 + 256 = 512..
---
Good value for money, can be used with your stats and will be helpful for slayer.

---
you're...... you're kidding right 15m an hour?  you can make maybe 5m an hour on a 2.2k world with protection and nobody attacking you, and if you're paying them for protection its less than 5m an hour, vorkath would be better
---
O man sorry to tell you but 5m an hour from revs is going to sell for about 3.50-4.00 and they would be making 1/3rd of some states min wage reqs lol. 
---
Pets bad
---
How? When did I tell people to dice or who to dice with?
---
1. thos are bots, bots should never be ok.
---
2. thos bots are run by people selling gold in black market
---
You mean [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crab_helmet)?
---
The thing is, they're running these bots because they make a ton of money. But there's nobody that can verify that they actually have the odds they say they have. So they're most likely scamming.
---
Better drop rates for uniques
---
Plus the premiums they get paid for protection monthly
---
Crystal shield is very tanky and a little cheaper.
---
Also, get a fighter torso
---
But you are part of RoT PR team though
---
If you can't recover your own account then idk what to tell you..
---
Can somebody confirm to me which year it is?
---
Having a feeling I might have travelled back in time by accident.
---
I'm excited to see how the quest resolves. The elve's story has been interesting and I'll actually have the stats/quests to do the quest when it comes out unlike dragon slayer.
---
The bots don't leave the ge sadly.
---
the gold is often traded away and sold in the black market, also for membership they use stolen credit cards
---
Phoenix @ 12kc baby
---
Can you please explain the reward system more in depth cause im still confused.

They can't respond due to their small pp.

---
I didn't watch my health and died to the gorillas the first time I attempted the quest.
---
Just for fun and to attract a crowd, I guess. The camelot/fallly party room was one of my favorite things in RS2.
---
I did a 10m drop party last year to celebrate getting 99 slayer. It was fun, and a lot of people got good items. It also brought back a little nostalgia for me, even though I was the one putting items in for once.
---
Noted for the next one, I agree
---
yeah go feed the black market gold sellers.
---

---
If that's true then this hypothetical update (which didn't pass at this point) wouldn't have been impacted by poro poro bots.
---
I checked the tribot page for poro poro bots, and it says the program is capable of looting and banking said loot. If that's the case, then these bot owners rather than ending the day with 1 clue would end the day with a stack.
---
I'm not really sure which is more popular. The latter would obviously be the way to go if someone wanted clue scrolls. As I said though, poll didn't pass so it's a non-issue either way.
---
&gt;If you quit over losing your stuff in a risky endeavor that you're clearly responsible for. 
---
FTFY
---
Thanks, just bought a bond 
---
I report everyone the bots say that bet them under player run games of chance. 
---
Jagex needs to grow some balls and start handing out bans for this shit. First offence of player run games of chance, 2 week ban (for the betters, perm the host right off, but not like the hosts care about their throw away accounts). 
---
Shit would disappear from the public eye over night. 
---
Also make begging/panhandling reportable. Less severe punishments than PRGoC obviously but some sort of action. 
---
it's probably the other way around, otherwise the bots would lose all their profit and stop existing. 0.7 chance to spit out a random number between 0-55 and 0.3 chance to spit out a random number between 0.55-100.
---
I mean, they're scammers, so why wouldn't they.
---
If you turn on battery saver android does that too. So for mobile with screen off to work on android just turn off battery saver mode.
---
*dry streak* LOL
---
I thought bp was good to bring in addition to the tbow. Cause you can use the spec for health and switch to tbow last second before transition. I only have like 1900 kc so I‚Äôm no expert though lol

---
Breh/10
---
Sure it should be fixed. On the update page, there are often fixes of this kind at the bottom. While there have been some major fuck ups (tbow spawn), I just think the skill guide missing a new item doesn't mean QA is lazy or incompetent.

Definitely get your prayer up if 2 prayer isnt a typo

Ah that‚Äôs why my guy. You‚Äôre raping the drop table by flooding it with spots for bolt racks at 100% stop at 88 
---
The lore is that it's still the scape of runes, aka runescape, gielinor is rs3 and later quest bullshit imo
---
You pretty much said exactly what the person you're replying to said, just with more certainty. 
---
No more players from Venezuela. Game integrity. 
---
Mmm no it was always gielinor
---
I thought it was way harder tbh. Ds2 was fun and quite easy.
---
I just want the cabbage.
---
What  dungeon in specific? You can buy the 'brass key' from the GE to enter the dungeon to the Southwest of the GE, but that leads to hill giants.
---
It's pretty basic though. The devs know that the skill guide needs updating with each new combat item, therefore QA should know to look for the skill guide adjustment with each new item. Things like this shouldn't really fly under the radar. 
---
Not going to change an item to increase your fashionscape

Interesting. Didn't know that.

Pretty sure Harrenhal was made out of weirwood.
---
lol care to explain that? 
---
40 kc and never done raids? Where did u buy the acc lol
---
Runecrafting untrimmed is the rarest, should prob go for that
---
Switch to an imbued crystal bow for vents. 
---
Also, look up a guide on youtube. If you use the house teleport method you actually tele to house during kills and can get a lot of kills per inventory.
---
So you can bank more loot when bossing, or bank dragon bones when on a drakes task etc 
---
How about the fella just pushing his birds head down

I‚Äôve seen a bunch of people doing this as well....flipping snakes..

Normally gaps in worlds are where Jmods place the testing worlds. Those are probably serves for JMods to test updates and QA stuff.

It's not Jagex's duty to do anything to a clan that charges reventats access, since there are good enough mechanics to oppose the clan in their actions

get in a team where everyone has discord and some understanding of the minigame its so much  easier that way. Mic communication to let other people they are messing up can help them out in the long run making it less annoying

i think its 82 bpm
---
Plus it's a problem of jurisdiction. A game developed in the UK being played on servers located in Germany with "criminal actions" done by a US national against an Australian national. Too many places for the battle to bounce around that it's not worth it.

I‚Äôd like this just because regular armadayl looks like ass

Legendary response. Thank you so much. I'm currently afking some levels at nmz and then im gonna try it either tonight or tmrw.

Can i do it with 70 hp and 73 range? I suck at pvm, doable?

---
you show dps calcs without specifying what npc its based on, which really doesnt tell us much
---
range already has a great diversity of weapons, and is by far the strongest combat style. it really doesnt need any buffs
---
Only 400 bolt racks? I‚Äôm with this guy. Faked. 
---
Why
---
You don't want to wear ranged gear while using mage as it has very negative magical bonuses.
---
Everyone who trades the accounts money should also be banned. Absolutely beyond me how nothing is being done about this.

For the people getting all grumpy over how it's all so childish and how people have the mental age of 12 year olds, keep in mind that most of the OSRS community is exactly that. Complaining about it here won't change that, so just accept it as it is and have a laugh if you're capable of humour.
