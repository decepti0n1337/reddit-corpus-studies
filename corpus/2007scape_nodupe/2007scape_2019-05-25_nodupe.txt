Karma for all the Pvmers doing slayer tasks you've probably killed. I feel nothing when pvpers  complain
---
---
---
[removed]
---
Personally I’d use chaps, snakeskin boots, and an archer helm.
---
But it did pass, only the special attack failed.
---
Maybe it wasn't an English degree
---
Don’t do slayer in wildy or pvp worlds if you aren’t ready to die or kill, Simple as that.
---
just delete firemaking honestly
---
Op doesn't have gear for hydra. He was specifically asking if he should do konar tasks or wildly tasks and I answered accordingly.
---
Go Away!
---
I've played off and on since late 2002, and I always come back to it. I don't know what it is, but I love it.
---
that i planted palm trees/magic trees and posion berrys till almost 91 farm and did even its by farming 3 methods at costs alot, but just get it from jespori seed
---
Post your username so people can look up the stats to know it’s legit. Along with the email tied to it
---
Thats against the rules.
---
Sauce?? (This sounds weird...)
---
No exceptions unless you're a streamer/youtuber
---
Rude as fuck.
---
obvi the game, but do you mean this subreddit?
---
Your stats aren't near high enough for your cb level for Bounty hunter / PVP world pking.  Id suggest gearing up with some xericians / water staff and seeing who you can find in the wildy or finding a clan and heading to revs
---
or I could give you screenshots
---
Is any 90 really fast though
---
Show her your battle scars from when you got ambushed with a dds spec.
---
Also you can go to white portal in 302 to get some practice venge pking without risking gp
---
Head over to sythe for that stuff man. You'll just get trolled here.
---
Every OSRS burnout knows what it's like to bank 4x+ for one item, leaving and thinking you grabbed what you needed but you took something else instead.  THIS during quests is what hell really is.
---
I wish jagex would make the ingame models more like this, much more realistic than that are currently. The art is brilliant.
---
Can you I wanna see the account .
---
I’ve made a decent amount off of them. Just depends on the bot
---
I actually did the math on this (Shameless Plug https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bq191h/jagex_please_read_the_comment_below/) the TLDR is they make 22.4m per hour per emblem farm (Theres 3 of them I know of)
---
LOL 6’3 and 140 considered healthy? HAHAHAHAHA you’re a fucking hunchback beta boy lanklet go eat a hamburger
---
Man I actually laughed 😂 please post this tomorrow or something
---
No its not, you can buy and use every potion regardless of herblore level. Making the BiS potions untradeable would be what turns herblore into a combat skill.
---
Well you didnt use protect for melee, thats why they are dying
---
Consider this Resolved! Mod Ash ftw! He says they'll block the random events in that area! Yay!
---
This is a horrible idea. This would turn herblore into even more of a combat skill.
---
So he's wearing Pegasian boots, meaning he has 75 defence, yet he's wearing a rangers tunic? BIS my ass.
---
New log in screen
---
Flax n chill is a real cool dude in wph
---
I love it. The character reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes!
---
We still doing this?
---
WHAT THE FUCK thats 25k bots a day, which means best case scenario is just over 25% of "players online" displayed on the homepage are bots what a shit show
---
6 6/6 that’s immune while attacking ignores taunt and can kill stealth minions that’s insane
---
You shouldn't be losing money doing contracts.
---
I do them since they seem to be the most consistent way to get hespori seeds now that I don't do tree runs post-99
---
H
---
Its a breeze on task! I remember my first task lol I was kinda nervous but tbh it goes so fast that youre way less stressed about jad once ya get there. That first time usually involves more stress since you spent a lot of time (lower stats usually) so you dont wanna mess up.
---
When does it end?
---
btw
---
Doesn't give tempo = trash tier disenchant
---
No i'm doing it on the wintertodt world with loads of other people. I didn't even realize you could solo it.
---
I don't understand how you interpreted what I was saying to that I was physically incapable of not changing patterns, I openly wondered if the reason I like changing patterns so much was because of this game, I said I'm anti-OCD, which I guess you could say that's the reason I was ignorant, but my point was that I don't like having things a certain way, OCD would be you want things a certain way, correct? Even if it's the opposite of needing it to be perfectly aligned? I don't need anything a certain way, I like messing it up
---
Jöj
---
Devalues my trimmed music cape account
---
Herb boxes from NMZ, AFK for the points.
---

---
Start and end my day with HOPS, Cactus and Birdhouses (and whenever I remember during the day!). 
---
I haven't started Miscelania either, maybe someone else can advise is that a weekly if you put enough money in or what's the longest you can go without having to go back?
---
Oh wow, anatomy that makes sense for a badass battle-lady. Great job, man!
---
And if you think this looks like Steve, your idea of what women should look like is fucked.
---
I totally forgot they had the toggle! I always kept them on the hat
---
good fuckin episode tho, love this quote.
---
What happened to your melee stats?
---
regardless of how rude it is, its sad and true
---
I’ve never died on Tekon and I really don’t know how
---
I really need to try again for my firecape. Wasn't paying attention last time and got Meleed by the Magic Boi. FeelsBadMan
---
Can’t complain, just forgot about the dmed rolling on 100%
---
&gt; I don't understand how you interpreted what I was saying to that I was physically incapable of not changing patterns, 
---
because you compared it to OCD, which in most cases renders the affected individual virtually physically incapable of not performing the actions they need.
---
&gt;I said I'm anti-OCD, which I guess you could say that's the reason I was ignorant
---
It is, and that is exactly what I said.
---
&gt;but my point was that I don't like having things a certain way, OCD would be you want things a certain way, correct
---
OCD you have a debilitating **need** to have things a certain way. Honestly this entire paragraph you wrote is more ignorant than the first comment. A simple "oh whoops, that's my bad, shoulda used a better word" would've been sweet but instead you jumped into this weird defense of what you said as if you didn't do anything wrong, and that's off-putting.
---
I'm gonna go. You don't seem to receptive to simple advice. But I recommend you try to take things a little better in the future, lol.
---
You need to for falador elite diary.
---
Sadly, after 10+ world hops and asking around haven't gotten any type of help :(
---
Working towards 90 right now, hit 88 about to be 89, so i'm really close.
---
That was accurate for the longest time, and you choose to take that stance now? It's more respected right now than it's ever been. Do you have any real points or do you just want to talk shit?
---
Same died to the marble Garg twice within 10 mins afking. That's when I knew HCIM wasn't for me
---
Yanille hops run, herb runs, birdhouse runs, battle staff from varrock.
---
Why leave the computer to poo?
---
Wouldn't recommend coming back. I enjoyed my first month back, but then I got into afk training and was searching for things to do while afk because netflix got boring. Eventually I picked up a separate game, and holy fuck man, did you know games could be fun and not grindy boring shitfests?
---
Would would be a lot better, but if you can’t make money that fast d scim works for a bit (eventually you will want the whip though) Slayer won’t do much for you until around 70 but it’s so worth it in the long haul. Also you can look into getting a fighter torso, it sucks learning and finding teams but it is also very worth the time.
---
From this week's update post: "The scrying pool views of certain towns have been adjusted to use more isolated maptiles to prevent interaction with the surroundings."
---
🤔🤔🤔
---
What's tekon?
---
as expected of Colonello, that's exactly right!
---
He always knew you were a pker
---
What's the average bark from a celestrus with secateurs and ultracompost?
---
That, that is actually an excellent idea. I am starting to wonder if we might just be in the old crowd lmao
---
get some friends then
---
thats my favorite chest drop to get by far
---
how many people have been banned for luring?  my point.
---
Yeah doing revs at low levels is pretty trash unless you’re a pure
---
OCD - the impulse to do repetitive behavior 
---
I have the impulse to never have repetitive behavior 
---
Anti- to go against 
---
I don't know shit about OCD, maybe it needs a new definition
---
Yes my friend, that is indeed actuate
---
Ds2 was so much easier on mobile
---
Back to slayer for me
---
I use preserve all the time in combat. It uses such little prayer it doesn’t really matter prayer point wise and it allows me to keep my stats boosted higher because I pot at the same time intervals so I end up doing more damage and get things done quicker.
---
Marble garg doesn't agro onto you, so if you were afk you just missed the marble and died to regular gargs
---
paying attention is very fun engaging gameplay, i love hardcore ironman!!!
---
Welcome back!!!@@@@
---
Jealous
---
Soon as possible tbf. Zenyte is a substantial upgrade for all three styles.
---
I mean idk lol, I just assumed it was cheap(er) based on what he said.
---
Zenytes are some of the first things you should buy after b ring and weapons
---
As expected I agree with this statement!
---

DS2 must have been a bitch on mobile
---
&gt;OCD - the impulse to do repetitive behavior
---
Sure. The entire list of medical qualifications for diagnosing OCD can be boiled down into 6 words. Give me a break.
---
Let's just say "fuck it" to college too and just give doctorate degrees to the person who can google stuff the fastest!
---
&gt; I don't know shit about OCD
---
clearly. Which is embarrassing for you, if your mother has it and you know this little about the illness, that's 500 times worse.
---
Clearly you don't get the point and I'm wasting my time. This is like talking to a brick wall, except a brick wall actually has the potential to store knowledge (writing on it). You, I'm not so sure.
---
&gt;it needs a new definition
---
No. Thankfully, we don't need to redefine words every time some dipshit can't figure out what they mean.
---
big words for a small man
---
these group videos are so shit. plz stop.
---
you probably NMZ AHKd the melees anyway, so you didn't lose much.
---
Possibly, depends how much these new pots are going to cost and if it would be worth using them on normal pvm like slayer instead of super combat and preserve.
---
Never played on a PC but it wasn't bad at all on my phone!
---
It wasn't bad at all. It took me about 4 or 5 attempts on my phone
---
its a hard clue
---
As I said, it wouldn't change the meta. People always have a pre-scout ready by the time they've finished their current raid. May make the first raid quicker, but that's it. Say you're doing a 4+1, anyone that isn't alting the raid prescouts with an alt. At least this way, we get rid of the nuisance of prescouting at the cost of 100k/scout. Would be very healthy for the game imo.
---
Did they change hosidius fruit stall favour requirements? I can't steal from them anymore at 30% favour and 46 thieving
---
wow gr8 maymay
---
I don't get it
---
F
---
Ah the good old days. I miss em. 😢
---
I’ll give you the 10k you’d get from a useless update like this
---
Vorkie!
---
Elite void???
---
They left?
---
r/unexpectedsharktank
---
Thanks
---
&gt;nobody will think that I'm a doctor accidentally misdiagnosing 
---
No. Because you have to be smart to be a doctor.
---
But it **will** push forward the idea that OCD = clean. For every idiot that goes around using OCD as a synonym for really neat, it means some other idiot might see it and think OCD is just wanting to be really clean.
---
No, nobody will think you're a doctor. But using the term the way you have is harmful, can be offensive to people with OCD, and is incredibly ignorant.
---
I'm asking you as one human to another to **have some empathy and use a different word because the word you are using is damaging to the public image of people with OCD.** Only a complete piece of shit will listen to that argument and think "nah, not worth it, gonna keep doing it."
---
So if you hear this and think "nah, not worth it, gonna keep doing it." then you are a piece of shit and your mother would be fucking ashamed. But I don't think you're a piece of shit, I just think you're an idiot. If you are well meaning, if you want to be good to people, you will find a different word to use.

[deleted]
---
I’m pretty drunk still
---
Ah looks like the guy I stole this meme from stole that meme haha
---
He used the mark tile option on runelite to make the pattern on the map while he afk cooked.
---
Also, as dense as essence
---
&gt; Never once did I say it was about being clean and tidy
---
Do you really need me to spell it out again?
---
In this exact instance, you **DID LITERALLY SAY THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT.** You compared it to pulling a book out of row on a bookshelf, lol.
---
Awesome stuff. This arma bow just tanked my bank so more cash sounds real nice lol
---
U will be surprised how many people steal memes
---
U get a guarentueed head on the 50th kill. With that crossbow youre done in no time. Put it on your imbued slayer helm. My favorite slayerhelm tbh.
---
Hey u r the bitch here
---
What I'm saying is that **OCD IS NOT A PERSONALITY TRAIT.**
---
Jesus. I am absolutely fucking dumbfounded that a human being this stupid exists, but here we are. I'll say it again.
---
**OCD (or "anti-OCD") IS NOT A PERSONALITY TRAIT. EQUATING IT TO A PERSONALITY TRAIT IS HARMFUL AND IGNORANT REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS WERE. CONTINUING TO DO IT AFTER IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT TO YOU MAKES YOU A PIECE OF SHIT.**
---
Lolstdve
---
Why do you think he finds it boring? That just seems really judgemental if you
---
I always hate when this happens to me
---
He said fuck me I can't say fuck him?
---
brah
---
You can do the same with Youtube Vanced, you can have it in a popup player and play osrs meanwhile.
---
Nice
---
Why did people downvote this?  Who the hell downvoted this?
---
Hey man you should relax
---
&gt; Except, I'm perfectly fine with using it by its definition
---
Also, I'll add one more thing. Because you are *aggressively stupid.*
---
**YOUR DEFINITION OF OCD IS WRONG IN THE FIRST FUCKING PLACE, THE WAY YOU USE IT IS NOT THE DEFINITION AT ALL**
---
It sucks now. the bank and range are much farther apart.
---
Bone Voyage is required to get to them
---
Nicestdve
---
Bring alch runes and like 10+ range pots and learn the safe spot at the door, most drops are alchs or stackable so you can stay there indefinitely more or less
---
Some random in salad robes praying redemption, double specced me for a burning Amulet. Said “sit dipshit”. Feelsbadman.
---
Whip
---
I was only risking the whip. I didn’t remotely expect to be skulled so I didn’t even bother with protect item
---
I really appreciate the use of Seercull and spined armor.
---
Come watch the series I'm participating with Colonello called 5 boys 5 bill. We just released episode 2 today!
---
My main got banned using a recorder to splash. Definitely should've used it somewhere other than lumby. Oh well, made a new account haven't used it since.
---
RIP the old fruit stall setup though :c
---
&gt; not 100% understanding the true ins and outs of everything that goes into what the disorder is
---
You have demonstrated clearly that you understand literally 0% of what OCD actually is.
---
literally just open up paint and control the mouse with your chin
---
you could try making the balls at a place with closeby furnace to bank like neitz. it's faster to just sell the steel tho. 
---
when you move onto mithril/addy make dart tips and you will profit
---
I think you're just trying to find people who think OCD= clean and be a condescending dick about, i said it as I'd want to change the pattern,  and gave you many other examples to further explain it was all about not being repetitive, and that in no way do I think just taking things out of patterns is being OCD, that it was my impulse to go against repetition in every way possible
---
Anyone from Mexico or Latin America? The OSRS website now redirects to the dead Mexican website, and I can't read the new posts. 
---
When clicking the Hosidous rework, it redirects me to this url https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/l=6/c=YWWGovL5ehA/hosidius-rework-and-deadman-beta?oldschool=1#_ga=2.241830402.1005126387.1558751152-1372858038.1546706706 
---
And a 404 pops.
---
Rs3 like economy? Rs3 has much more gold and item sinks than osrs
---
Gpu plugin in rl play around with these settings. Stretched mode in runelite, fixed ingame (gives you the original interface but fullscreen and all interface buttons such as inventory gear prayers etc etc are much much bigger witch makes the gameexperience so much better. Trust me).
---
He speaks the language of the gods
---
Jesus christ man... Im sorry to see this. :( Hopefully once I unlock Hydra I wont have the same luck lol
---
Didn't dc in years, you have garbo internet gg.
---
I looked away from Vespori for 4 seconds and lost 45 life and hcim. Got the bottomless bucket when I came back so worth.
---
Yeah I got complacent, it was only like a minute loop. Did a lot on the account with it, but had to laugh that I got it banned splashing of all places lol.
---
I made a meme so I've never pvp'd? I'm sorry I don't follow your 200 iq logic. You seem pretty mad if you're digging through my post history for some reason though.
---
Honestly I think you might have missed the point of the meme, too. Amazing.
---
is that a location string? stil seems it will be a pain to remove that everytime I want to read a new post haha. Damn :/
---
quests r bests
---

cant kill abyssal demons but i can kill zulrah and vorkath.. when u got those why would you need abyssal demons anymore lol
---
He means he'll drop the master before opening a medium casket, for the (1/50?) chance of getting a new master.
---
And most of the money from that task was the ashes probably which noone picks up.
---
Are you trolling, not understanding, or understanding and not willing to drop the convo
---
You beast! Thank you! Lol
---
Depends if you like nieve
---
This is genius
---
your moms grown more teeth since the last time I saw her
---
I should’ve added that I’m not having actual internet connectivity issues. Any streaming services like twitch, Netflix etc are typically running while I’m playing osrs, and there is no interruption with them. Just the game loses connection, then says “Error connecting to server” on attempt to log in again.
---
Dark desert is the best alternative name you could come up with?
---
That's crazy. You should try to collect them.
---
Either location or language.
---
2 other options;
---
Use a VPN to USA/europe
---
Search this subreddit for the post title, someone usually copy/pastes the content into the comments
---
This is a problem that affects pvpers as well tho
---
If you made it 8-10 years ago there’s a chance it would use the original username to log in. So that should help a bit. Unfortunately your stats would be connected to rs3 as osrs is only 5 years old and nothing was transferred over item or stat wise only account details. But yeah better off starting over with a new email and everything. Good luck man.
---
Yeah tbh it shouldn’t really matter at this point unless you’re interested in playing rs3
---
Thanks, I'll do that from now on. Hopefully they remove it tho, idk why its still there if there's no content to show.
---
Woooo another one!
---
My stats are 80 attack, 82 strength, 75 def, 87 range, 55 prayer and 85 HP. With bp and elite void how much gp/hr can i expect at vork?
---
I only enjoy quests with combat
---
Lmao k
---
Cos it's eeeasy. And does a lotta damage.
---
That cat steps in it's own poop and sits on your keyboard. You type with said keyboard. You rub your eyes. Boom. Pink eye.
---
Not really, still a boss you have to DWH or you'll have issues
---
Stay tuned. You haven't seen anything yet.
---
There is a spot in the chasm of fire where you van cannon 3-4 demons non-stop while ranging a 5th demon. Pretty good xp.
---
I enjoy quests more than grinding skill levels because quests have a definite end.
---
It's not actually there, that's the view skill guide button
---
Stew it
---
Even at biweekly uploads he wouldn't have much content to put in them. As of currently he is spending most of his time doing temple trekking, he can only include so many clips of him doing temple trek.
---
The user name with Torvesta in it.
---
The ahrims and god dhide should be good for zulrah with blowpipe+fury and trident+occult. Your best bet would be to spend money on training both range and mage
---
I’m getting ripped off
---
Have a reason to train skills. For example, only train skills that's required for a diary or quest.
---
Or use the built in screenshot button that's usually built into whichever 3rd party client a player is using.
---
I plan to block if I ever get the pet
---
Could be.
---
No spell immunity? Yeah right it'll never attack
---
Why, the answer is tbow
---
You pay that because you have an old membership rate. The current rate for membership is $11/mo

I love how South Floridians always comment when pictures of our places appear on reddit.

'love from the 305 to our broward niggas, u heard

This but unironically
---
At least you admitted that you were indeed botting. So I'll give you props for that.
---
Ash gives a non-committal vaguely positive reply to every suggestion he gets.
---
Can we adopt a JMOD instead?
---
sorry to make you sad but 83 kc on iron 2 prims 1 peg 1 eternal
---
True. There definitely should be an indicator if you can attack someone without getting skulled.
---
He shits himself constantly so his wardrobe is constantly in a rotation.
---
Hey man if you can post/ send me the 3d object file id love to try 3d printing this.
---
Jr brew
---
Hey man, don't judge
---
I’m just gonna farm another 2000 tokens and try again.
---
Ok
---
Yes, but are you using bgs?
---
I did money dragon at roughly thoes stats. Get a salve ei and a bgs. Also it depends what you have in your poh. Like i have an ornate pool and an lunar isle tele.
---
With all that at that stats, banking after every kill, i was getting like 1 kill every 5 or so min, abouy 10 to 13 ish kills an hour for a little over a mil or about 1.5m ish. Supply costs will eat at that, as well as deaths which cost 100k each.
---
Also i would probably use rune darts until you get about 90 range which will cost a bit more.
---
Are you wearing a metal chest piece?
---
(Ahrims counts)
---
That affects it????? I had no idea thank you
---
Something involving scrying pools.
---
I had the same issue before haha. No worries
---
Not even. You can just modify the client to make it think your on mobile. No need for Bluestacks or a sim. You'd be able to use let's say runelite on desktop, with a mobile like UI. Then you could make a plugin to revert the changes to normal. 
---
It would make pking heaven for the abusers.
---
yeah, for further context, for the accounts i could look up, they all had under lvl12 cmb, had 1s across the board and 50+ Thieving. 
---
Best part: 3 of them under lvl60 thieving had raccoons.
---
Is it really bothering you that much? LMFAO just walk away
---
I humbly express my joy and awe, for I have been enlightened by the hard work you have put in developing such exquisite dexterity in catching sea dwelling creatures.
---
My guess is you went from BK to DI/DS
---
I think the restriction of 70 combat is stupid. I mean you’re diluting the already small pvp playerbase in 2 regions and are cutting out a large portion of them by not allowing them to pk there. Just a spot for mains to do whatever pvm in a pvp zone risk free I guess.
---
Yeah I'm getting the fucking ardy agility don't complain
---
Yeah its a great boss to learn and really fun once you got it. I redid the fight a few times after the quest just for fun lol. And Jad is a great challenge for mobile. I used only mobile back when the beta came out, thats all i could use at the time. So i played and played for a month straight and became almost as good on mobile as i am PC lol. I do recommend you write down the info for jad and plan it out thoroughly as well. Good luck!!
---
I'm listening to Sugar Song to Bitter Step and this gif is following the beat.

I nutted.

Me

 "Ill do quests when i have clue scrolls that for me to do them"
---
Also me 
---
"I have 4 clue scrolls in bank i dont have the quest reqs to finish."
---
Take a nap
---
What you forget to realize is that theres never a situation where you use nose peg and blowpipe
---
I think it is one dude with like hundreds of accounts, literally every single word has dozens of them. Usually it's not that bad
---
Yeah I'm getting the fucking rune meds, anti-venom and sacred eels, please don't complain to me
---
Dont let that keep you from doing it though. Honestly i think i was just bad at that part so it took a while. Good luck tho!
---
But they do imagine having 15 mins of not using prayer on preserve and not worrying with stats being below max the entire time at somewhere like bandos or sara or zammy or literally any other boss you dont use brews as your food source. I feel it opens a gateway to a ton of powercreep in the future.
---
Uhh Runescape is way more similar to cookie clicker than an rpg, but whatever.
---
Dont mock my momopoly money.

Get you a bank that reimburses international transaction fees.

Australian friends may I recommend ING.

i can hear you patting your own back from here
---
This guy slays. Slayer is really not profitable until 75-80 IMO unless you are doing wildly.
---
Thanks! That'll probably be the next thing I do with my account
---
In this situation you would actually lose inventory space from the prayer drain, also bandos is not exactly content most people bother with
---
Yea im not 70 crafting yet, but ty anyways

I think that they’re squat lobsters.

A GSXR-1000 and a helmet and gloves as the only riding gear.
---
MM2 ends by speaking to King Narnode in The Grand Tree, DS2 by speaking to the guy in front of Myths guild. Should probably end it with DS2 so you can walk into the Myths Guild right as you get the QC, would be pretty cool.
---
Was it stated in your chat that the wand was what was given as the extra reward? If so then I’ve no clue, but if not then it was just a regular clue reward that you got on top of the mimic loot.
---
Fuuuuck he figured me out.
---
Opened up casket in wildly what a mad lad!!
---
Knew it looked familiar
---
Awesome, thank you! I'll definitely try it out when I get home.
---
You can't auto click.... what? He would still have to drink prayer potions
---
Yeah it said so in the chat
---
I’m 1400 dry on zulrah for tanz, at least horrors are quick to kill
---
It's not that bad. You can use Slayer Helm and Xericans. Maybe go up to 20 if you want to use Mystic. The account isn't ruined if you NH brid deep wild, Xericans is very useful for a pure.
---

We're all for skulling trick and consider it an integral part of the wilderness. Unskulled PKers are the scum of the earth. 
---
If you don't want to risk skulling, don't ever fight back, it's that simple. You're a bloody ironman, you can't even loot the kill. If you want to DPS so they can't smite, just turn auto retaliate on while keeping attack options on hidden.
---
This is 100% your own fault, stop looking for someone else to blame and for Jagex to dumb the game down even further.
---
It speaks for itself

Try using mage only on rotation 3. If your gear is good enough, you shouldn't have too much trouble. I had been trying a different rotation and kept failing, then I got it first try with mage only setup. 
---
If you don't have mage gear, lemme know, you can lend some things (like gimme a tort and I'll lend you torm, trade back when you're done)
---
Would arma helm come before upgrading from glory to anguish? 4 more range atk than spined helm (3 more than coif but coif is ugly l) vs 5 more Han glory
---
Yeah no.  Its a cool series, but they literally start with max accounts and skip 99% of RuneScape.  If you only care about slayer and bossing, then maybe, but even then, Swampletics is much better edited *IMO*.  
---
Its your opinion so you're not wrong and I didn't downvote, but I just dont see how someone can truly believe that.
---
Werewolf is also shit. Canifis is the only way to go.
---
Bro, don’t tell everyone. Jagex gonna ban it.

You should go for a Dragon Defender.  
---
If you dont want to do slayer that is fine. you should go do quests for a Helm of neitiznot if you are not going to d slayer.  
---
70 attack for a whip would be nice.  
---
A warriors ring is cheap and offers a decent amount of slash bonus, Helps with d scim and whip.  
---
Do some questing for Barrows Gloves for your Best in slot gloves for a long time.  
---
You can buy a Amulet of Fury for a best in slot necklace for awhile as well.  
---
Upgrading your Dragon armor to Barrows will provide better defences and fairly cheap. Like say Dharoks or Torags platebody/platelegs  
---
If you have the money later on, getting a ring of suffering (i) will give you a lot of defense for a ring slot.  
---
If you are looking for magic, Getting the level to cast Ibans blast and using a fire tome for unlimited fire runes, will grant good exp.  
---
till you can use a Trident of the Seas is probably your best option  
---
God Cape from Mage Arena has a lot of Magic bonus  
---
Getting a Mages Book from the Mage Training Arena also has a lot of magic bonus.  
---
Training range is a pain unless you wanna shell out the money for fast exp. A good way to train is to just take a shortbow and arrows to ammonite crabs and just afk.  
---
Some easy bosses to learn early on that can grant decent money is Barrows, Crazy Arch.  
---

&gt;attacking a hostile player shouldn't give you hostile status?

They have to attack *you* first. How fair would it be if someone wearing the same items as you attacked you first (while you're skulled) and they didn't get a skull themselves? 
---
They would be risking less ***and*** they get the first hit? That makes no sense to me.. 🤔
---
Wtf mine went up tho I subbed in 2004
---
I’ll probably try it some day, but even if I don’t finish the clue it’s whatever. Clues are so common while slaying that it’s really not even that big of a deal, I’ll probably be back out doing one in 20 minutes depending on task. Maybe once I finish the push to 87 I’ll go out acting like a clue hunter and turn around with ancients a DDS and MSB(I) and see if I can smack a quick kill

Guys rs3 ugly 😳😳😳
---
&gt;Most bots are reflection. Meaning they cant automate some stuff. In order to make any money you would have to run 20+ bots doing some shit money maker.  
---
If it would stop them, that's great, but the 2step being automated isn't the issue - it can be manually done if the botter chooses to do it.  
---
&gt;If the bot farmer would have to manually enter each code for each account only to have one banned and set up another. The process for them to literally print money would be made far more inconvenient.  
---
Inconvenient, but still worth it? They are not going to close their business down because the process is slowed down marginally. It's just one more item added to their to-do list to manually enter the codes, they would be re-creating the accounts each time they get banned regardless.  
---
&gt;Also your looking at my shit post with a very big magnifying glass.  
---
It's a good idea and it needs more discussion to be considered. If it's just a shit post and you do not want Jagex to even consider adding it in-game then we can stop talking about it right now, but I believe it has worth.  
---
&gt;Also don't give me the code bull shit. Its a multi million company. They arent your fuckin nan. They can do the work.  
---
They can do, but you termed it as not a 'crazy ask' when in fact it would take a lot of time, resources and people to implement it, meaning those people would not be working on whatever else they are currently being asked to look at. What about having passwords that register uppercase characters? What about 2step on the RS website login? What about an actual customer support system that is useful? There is a long list of things that may not seem like a 'crazy ask' but they still don't get done.  
---
&gt;Run with it.  
---
No, let's not run before we can walk.

Same and it always confused me cause the string is green in the invent

I don't get how a picture of some pole depicts the experiences you have in RuneScape. Maybe if there was someone behind the pole then this would make sense.

\&gt; If the best defense of your opinion that you can give is a circle jerk ad hominem 
---
That is also something that applies to your point, considering the brainlet lobby can pull one of 3 flashcards to try and defend themselves.

They are:
---
"Durr fight me 1v1 durr"
---
"Durr muh wilderness sign durr"
---
"Durr quit crying durr &lt;sobs profusely&gt;"

You're gripping onto flashcard #3.

Yeah I pay $5 a month. My subscription will end when the servers go down permanently.

??? I've pked maybe 5 times in my life and it was always at revs. Not sure what point you're trying to make right now.
---
honestly i would just do whatever you enjoy. its probably gonna suck at the start to learn it but im sure its alot of fun and worth it in the end, just like all the other bosses you had to learn.
---
Take it from someone who had a nearly maxed 1 defence pure and stupidly went 13 defence, dont do it. I ended up turning it into a voider and it's pretty nice now but not for deep wild nhing really anymore. Stay 1 defence. 13 def pures shine in clans and multi pking. Like rev caves.

You can throw on black dhides, helm of neitz, bracelet of ethereum with like 30-50 ether charges, climbing boots/snakeskin boots, and use your blowpipe. Turn player attack options OFFFFFFFFF so you never skull. Hang out around the southern-most area of rev caves and tele/hop/logout based on your evaluation of the risk of pkers killing you.

With your stats and gear i don’t think you’re going to get to Jad on your first few tries. When you do, expect to die multiple times, especially considering you’re trying to do this on mobile for your first time. I highly recommend you get on a pc for jad for those f keys.
---
Also expect to lose some money in supplies from your attempts. If you don’t have the bank for it then hold off

I can guarantee they are just normal gambling bots if you keep the bets low. I imagine if you throw a fat wedge at it it will just say you lose. If you only do 100-500k you can win (could be more but that’s what i did so i know you can win with 500k). I’ve made profit off of em.

Oh I didn’t even see the range strength bonus. I’ll likely get arma helm then sel as it’s only 4m vs 14m for anguish
---
Yeah, honestly, I'd probably do the same.
---
RS3 they mainly did it because they created prif with intention to become a new main hub for people, hence the lodestone in the middle of the GE and literally any direction you can choose to go providing some form of skilling activity.
---
OSRS on the other hand I feel has nowhere near enough proposed content that it could be essentially considered a higher level or higher requirement hub for players and instead would just be I'D ASSUME a nearly 100% beggar free zone.
---
Honestly now that I think about it, it would be VERY nice to likely have no beggars, no bots, etc. Sitting in the G.E. I see people talk enough WITHOUT the trash that I wouldn't feel like the game is dead.

Forgot stams bro

Why do people come hunt rats to fuck with AFKers.  Do you not have anything better to do?

Even if I was a bot, which I'm not, it's making 13k Magic exp/hr... pretty harmless to the economy?
---
Better gear makes ToB learning easier because you'll kill stuff quicker, but me and friends trio without scythes. 4 man whip runs aren't too slow at all. Could comfortably do ToB in &lt;50mil worth of gear. The issue for you will be finding teams but if you can do that, absolutely worth doing.

Quality stuff, you deserve much more popularity than you get! Keep it up love this series~

Imagine not using all the cash you had on your main to buy a fuckload of bonds to transfer to your btw.

Seriously I don't even know what to do with the bonds. I have almost a year saved up.

Isn't that a good thing?
---
The 100k+ an hour for melee is with dharoks, overloads and 90+ combat stats
---
You should look into the Barbarian Assault minigame so you can earn yourself a Fighter Torso which will be your best in slot chestplate for awhile and a nice upgrade from rune.
---
Wtf they are just like people, that jagex.
---
People also fail jad and Zulrah a ton, there's a lot if really bad players out there
---
Gz to you! Saving you a seat at the mobile table, you got this
---
Venezuelan RWTers will do anything to get their hands on your GP.
---
Interesting
---
Probably a minority of people quit after max since there is a shit ton of stuff to do post max. Also these worlds aren't deserted as they seem. GE in this ss was empty because it was early morning (when most NEETs go to sleep). Also because everyone else is at crafting guild.
---
Hi Trebor
---
I would start with pest control minigame until you have the full armor set with the range helmet, it is best in slot for a long time and you'll earn exp and chump change while you do it, the mage one is decent but not that neccessary. 
---
 
---
Also do a couple key quests, like Waterfall, Animal Magnetism, Fairy Tale part 1, and start part 2 (don't need the stats) to unlock fairy rings, work towards Monkey Madness. 
---
After this your combat level will start getting a bit higher and you can work on getting fighter torso from Barbarian Assault, and Barrows Gloves from Recipe for Disaster.  
---
Slayer is good for money, at under 75 combat you should use the wilderness slayer master, Krystillia in Edgeville. (Only take 3 good equipment in wildy of course.) And over 75, Konarr.
---
Eh I disagree. There’s 139 quests and I’m willing to bet atleast 120 aren’t fetch quests.
---
Vasa/tek are doable just fine but vesp/vang are legitimstley aids and need to be dramatically nerfed to be in line with all the other rooms tbh
---
Im gonna keep it, I was gonna make a mid lvl account but I’m going for a main so I’m gonna need it either way at some point if I wanna raid or do corp

I can log in to the website perfectly fine, it cant be email or password.

Ah fuck.  Any chance I can convince you to start playing FFXIV, level to 70, gear up for UCOB, master your job &amp; the entire fight then join my group so that you can make a version of this that depicts my group wiping to Morn Afah a billion fucking times?

This has to be the greatest piece of 2007scape fan content I've ever seen.  As a matter of curiosity, can you not brew up to 115 in Chambers?  I have zero interest in CoX so no clue

I didn't knew that when you die as HCIM you become UIM.

Nope not an iron man, And I'd say around 800 was eclectics, so definitely lost quite a bit unfortunately haha

god forbid we actually fix the problem
---
Could be a clues to something secret. Maybe go to that tile, put your wood in a basket and BAM, it's now December and you wasted half a year of your life.
---
Tried it, no you can't you get you get a message saying 'there are no shops, so there's no need to cash'

He's an iron man. You can just bring a cannon

Of course because you can buy a gf but you can’t buy rc xp

collection log and pet hunting are common post max activities.

You bank using your home tabs, I got pool and all teleports unlocked so after every trip I regen and bank (Seers Village teleport is one of the closest to a bank btw, about 5-6 tiles away)
---
I’m sorry mate, just gotta grind 14 hours a day instead to forget about the whole thing.
---
Something very similar to mine actually. Six steps that didn't have any skill req, then 'Fletch a rune dart' well shit, time to burn 10m on addy dart tips. Finish that step and the very next step is an item step to supply an internal axe. Dammit.
---
Speaking of RS3, I'd love if they gave OSRS the same graphics in an option toggle. OR at the very least, give us larger draw distance. The limited draw distance is kind of annoying in 2019. I understand the purists who want to maintain OSRS as it was, but get rid of the black cut off and increase the draw distance and I'd be happy as hell.
---
It will make moving around much more smooth/ Especially since when I'm on PC I have an ultrawide monitor.
---
I'm so sorry dick drizzle
---
It's the best elite diary by far. Slayer block slot, staffless fairy rings, teleport close to falador farm / port sarim spirit tree, run energy restore, 30 high alchs for barrage tasks.
---
Why would you string longbows for 16 hours tho. I know that this is a meme but is this some kind of money making method? Also what is the best f2p money making method?
---
I've used diaries and clues as account wide goals. Its actually really nice. Ser a goal to get a quest Cape and the stats for hard clues. I think my next goal will be all elite or master clue reqs rather than try to go for elite diary reqs right now.
---
Runite ruby bolts also hit 100s
---
Yeah there's no better time than scammers spamming the GE /s
---
Actually, what you can do is bring a rune pouch, and inside bring chaos runes (for Crumble Undead), dust runes, and law runes, so you have your Crumble Undead cast, your boss teleport cast, AND your bank teleport all in one inventory space.
---
Mlm in this context I believe is referring to a multi level marketing thing. (pyramid scheme) it tends to be something newer service members have to deal with since their SOs have no idea how to manage money.

Some of us can't even fathom the idea of playing mulitple accounts tbh
---
Aint nobody got time for that

Idk but shes lana rhoades she used to be super sexy

Oh i didnt knew those existed. Thank you i'll look those up!

And why not a tool belt because managing your inventory smartly based on your activity is just too inconvenient and gets in the way of me buying skill XP.

Technically it's not a scam, he's selling a "novelty transaction".

I don’t know what sort of math you used but those values are not equal
---
if it works on the website then you have to be typing it wrong...
---
Yeah I agree with above post. Tag them and pull them away from jad, 1 at a time and dont spam click them all because you will lose focus on Jad movements. Healers dont hit very high so you should be fine. If you take a hit from jad, dont panic. Do the following- 1 brew, prayer flick, 1 brew, prayer flick, 1 brew, prayer flick, 1 restore and back to it. 
---
Good luck.

Runelite helps a lot with that although you end up seeing some weird stuff sometimes

"Fakes" (fake screenshots) used to be a really big thing in the old RS community, at least on the RuneHQ forum where I spent a lot of time.

You can see further, turn the GPU option on and set it to like 100 or more.

it's a gui i made based on bitterkoekje's calc, because i wanted some more features and google docs runs like crap for me anyway, i'd offer to upload it but it's a bit of a mess under the hood and would be enormous with all the function dependencies, i wouldn't expect anybody but me to trust it

I'm always willing to help out a new player, PM me if you need anything

Which I think was against the rules for a while in the main game. I know merch CCs were but idk if 1 person market manip was or not.
---
Also add drop to wildy bosses that you can use to upgrade it so it receives wildy weapons damage
---
He doesn't even know how it works lmao, that's great
---
So by that logic of it just being a game RWT shouldn't be an offense that can get you banned? Neither with botting as well? That's a slippery slope you're falling down there bud. If no consequences are to be doled out, there'd be no reasons for the rules to even exist in the first place. Use your head and think for a second before responding. lol

Oh god I was scrolling down the front page and I only saw the thumbnail and thought to myself "Oh hey that's Lana Rhoades!"

This is how you completely obliterated your pc back in the day
---
No Honor Hybridding. It's PKing without any rules and typically using all three styles. This is because no rules implies the use of overhead prayers and freezes.
---
It's a very high paced style of PKing where you'll simultaneously be switching your items to change style, changing your offensive prayers, reacting to your opponent and changing defensive (overhead) prayers, moving around, and drinking a potion/eating at the same time.
---
Massive skill cap and very fun way of PKing. Take a look at some of those names I put in my first reply on YouTube, all of them are NH Bridding focused PKers.
---
basically all i know is lvling up stats, but from hanging around this subreddit i know theres so much more to the game, i just want someone to run me through it all and give me the info i dont know. if that all makes sense? like i played when i was 10yrs old and spent hrs hrs getting nowhere hahah

You normally wouldn't. Darts is the way to go.

No. Bgs + pipe is better. Secondly even when using crossbow doesn't matter which one dhcb rcb or acb do not use dfs since it gives negative range bonus and defense it gives is irrelevant since you already pray range.

Better suggestion: completely randomize floor rotation so you cant scout past the first combat room

Dad used to block internet access after 11pm except for on his computer so I used to sneak on his pc at 2am, have all the lights off and whenever I heard a noise turn his monitor off and hide under the desk for people to walk past or w/e. Definitely have fond memories doing the morytania quest like while doing that which made it even more spooky

I know that mathematically its not worth doing meds but last year I decided to buy a bunch of eclectics and try my luck at med clues. Well i got 3 pairs of ranger boots within 100 clues. I never did a clue after that.

I have a 1983 total lvl pure, and yes. Every 2k world is owned by a cc. The cc “pure crew” will clear any pure they see in 2k worlds. They charge like 100m every 2 weeks for safe passage though. And in case youre wondering, i have 158 days played on my pure if you wanted to make one

---
I've been buying flax and cutting magics. Slower, but I get exp for WC and crafting too (basically went 10-53 crafting with bowstrings). That said, might buy bowstrings once I get to 85 fletch...

Should have blurred ur run energy and attack energy... Now i'm gonne hack u

Mum used to take the power supply cable to the wireless router upstairs with her to her bedroom after 10pm every school night. Little did she know, I knew where the old router box which also happened to also be the same brand of modem, had its old power supply cable in there. I'd sit by the bedroom door with my ear to it and listen until I heard the upstairs door close, meaning the coast was clear. I'd plug in the old power supply and off I go.
---
Whenever I heard footsteps upstairs which always gave me a panic attack I'd straight away fuck the computer; hold the power button down and run back to my room until the coast was clear. One time dad came down the stairs and I couldn't get to my room in time because I was panicked, I was doing Horror from the Deep and was fighting the Dagannoth mother with shitty stats/gear so it was a hard fight and I was so focused I didn't even realise. I panicked, force shut down the PC and hid beside the desk. Dad then sat down at the PC and used it for like a solid hour, didn't even realise that the internet wasn't meant to be working because mum had the thing, and I sat there for what felt like hours.
---
I am still so thankful dad didn't decide to watch porn and have a wank, that would've scarred me.

at first i was like, what so special?
---
then i noticed the 3rd age legs
---
I’m not sure about the whole worth thing. In terms of efficiency not sure if clues are worth doing in general? But in terms of having fun of possibly smacking some shitty pkers that talk shit, def worth for me. Although I don’t do any clues so Im not sure how common they are or how common it is to run into these pkers.
---
they scrapped that
---
Not for low alch it isn't
---
You do you, bro ;) It's not that bad I suppose it just gave me a chuckle while scrolling through Reddit.
---
I'd say important. Cut your losses, go into your settings and turn off the player combat Target thing so it doesn't happen again, take some time away from mage arena, then go back to do it later.
---
On that 3019 shit.
---
Lol I was like "how tf am I supposed to see what you got if you cens- oh."

Why don't you just buy them off the GE?

Anyone ever had any issues with the Runelite client crashing? It was working fine about 6 hours ago but now when I open the client it freezes for a few seconds every 10-15 seconds making it pretty much unplayable.
---
Well not many people low alch
---
Ah the oldest scam in the potatoe

My man rolls in with guns blazing "HURRDEEDURRR YUZ IZ DUMB N I IZ SMORT, YUZ MAKE STOF UP TU ASK ME BOUT DEMZ" only to get shot down by a cutenoob harder than a hit from jad without prayer.

Nigga you got knocked the fuck out.
---
Technically you do have the same chance at receiving rangers on your first clue as you do on your millionth.
---
You've made a lot of claims that I've never heard before:
---
&gt;If you didn't realize, 90% of the "farms" are actually vennies
---
&gt;That 7 day trial is super small. About 100 accounts are generated per day using it.
---
&gt;(the pyramid plunder "bots"). 
---
(because you are implying people don't bot pyramid plunder and instead play it legitimately)
---
&gt;Those major farms are in the low 3% of the actual botting community.
---
Don't suppose you could provide a source for any of these claims?
---
13% of Scotland and 10% of Ireland are redheads and there is a 600k population difference between the countries in scotlands favour, so I would say that would put both countries neck and neck so he can be Irish.
---
Source: I'm Scottish and hardly ever see a natural redhead.
---
What was the hardest on mobile? Mm2? I'm having a hard time with that one on pc lol
---
I've got that clue step where you need 87 fishing. Can you not boost from 82?
---
I still haven’t gotten it 😒
---
They are addy bolts not runite
---
Actually shit
---
Thanks for this, there was option to turn off the task boost that I didn't notice. Ahrims has slightly worse dps than elite void without torm brace.
---
FRIG OFF?!?!?!?!?!
---
I’d love OSRS with updated graphics. But it’ll never happen. Every time they want to add new content they’d have twice as much work for the design team.
---
Damn dude. I had to sneak downstairs and there's always that one squeeky floorboard.
---
One time I made a sandwich and left it on top of the monitor. My parents found it the next day and asked, "Oh, you must have been really distracted by whatever was on the screen huh?" 
---
I just let them believe I was watching porn because that's easier than trying to explain that I was mining iron ore under Fally as a F2P slave.
---
Id say 99% of raiders in we do raids wouldnt raid with you with 75 range/mage
---
I like to do the boss for the easy afk gp while on mobile, but overall the gp and xp both aren't fantastic. I imagine it is much more efficient to just block them.
---
fund quick ways? melee's are basically free, you're already 99 range and magic, and prayer above 77 is just QoL, what are you trying to fund. Not trying to be a dick, just don't really understand the need to moneymake for your stats at this point
---
"We got $8.99 for $9.99!"
---
There's no good afk money makers, especially f2p ones.
---
You won't be able to put anything into your bank but all your items will stay there

I read the entire thing, was like "Wtf this guy is high lol" the I read the username. Fucking comedy gold.
---
A pin required on login would be nice, but if they are on your account, its a real player controlling it. So a captcha does nothing, even if its a botted account, they will just run the bots, then at turn in time will do the captchas all at once, you would cost them a minute tops.
---
Thanks for the responses guys. What about zulrah? Or any other bosses I should try at my level.
---
If you want to attack back I’ve found the best way is adding the person you’re sure hit you so that their name is green
---
!remindme 3 hours
---
You don't need tbow to do bossing and in fact I agree.
---
On the other hand, if you're gonna buy a tbow, that money will come mainly from pvm so you can stfu.
---
no
---
this doesnt even make sense
---
But how would I know if I got scammed if I don’t know I’m getting scammed
---
Hey, this is what my social circle looks like at all hours!
---
You can do barrows with your stats. You can start learning zulrah with 75/75 range mage. Vork at around 85 range.
---
Reddit is Fun master app
---
Hey atleast he's not askin for wine or dwarf weed
---
Man, I know that bots are rigged. After all, why would they settle for 5% advantage if they could have even more? I get what you're saying, but it's irrelevant to the point I'm trying to make.   
---
The person I initially replied to made the claim that "If it were truly completely random, they wouldn't exist". I am only trying to point out that this isn't true and that it's equivalent to saying "if casinos weren't rigged, they wouldn't exist".
---
Just for the record, I'm not defending these bots. Rigged or not, they will win every time.
---
I got to 75 fletching and woodcutting by cutting my own logs and fletching them fully, it was definitely worthwhile. I bought most of my bowstrings from maple onwards though, as the crafting xp was getting too slow.
---
Are you a member?
---
takes 0 just go around
---
Well for f2p skills and money with members activities you have 3 options. Mining, smithing, or runecrafting.  
---
[Mining](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blast_mine#Experience_rates) at blast mine, but you'll want at least 75 mining. 
---
[Smithing](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Blast_Furnace#Experience_per_hour) at blast furnace. You'll want a [coal bag](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Coal_bag) though. That will take a few days at [Mother load Mine ](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Motherlode_Mine)to get. [Graceful](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_outfit) would obviously also be helpful, but that takes some time to get. You could do iron bars of course, or even steel as those don't require a coal bag.  
---
[Runecraft](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pay-to-play_Runecraft_training#Single_nature_runes_(44%E2%80%9354/59/65) Pretty much your best bet would be nature runes for this.  
---
  
---
Out of these I'd suggest smithing to most if you're looking to increase skills. Others might say slayer or combat, but if you're not planning to stay a member then those would fall off and take longer to get to the "good" money.
---
No D: i dont keep up with memes for a couple months and this shit happens?!?!
---
I had an elite clue I couldn't yet do so I dropped it right before Skotizo died. Skotizo ended up dropping another one and I was able to pick up both. Is this a bug?
---
Not everything has to become efficiencyscape. If the man enjoys cutting yews let him cut yews.
---
&gt; Unless LITERALLY everyone doing raids is pre-scouting or buying dungeons
---
Its hard to understand if you dont do efficient raids but everyone who can raid efficiently is already prescouting on an alt, and players who can't raid efficiently don't have the knowledge to take advantage of prescouting anyways. The amount of effort it takes is next to none, you add maybe like 5 clicks every 30s, it's really something that you can do during the raid with minimal attention. The suggestion would be a good gold sink that makes record raids a lot less RNG.
---
"bondage porn. Don't worry about it"
---
!Remindme 6 hours
---
I’ve just got to combat lvl 50 so I thought I’d give it a try , I got close to getting a few kills on the same guy but he kept running to the safe zone and when I stopped trying to get him he started calling me a pussy for not wanting to fight him lol, I play a lot of rainbow 6 so I’m used to a toxic community but some people on here are next level lol
---
they won't be adding on to the game though, which is the point. with osrs they did. it's just a pure legacy server. vanilla by itself is absolutely god awful, anyone who ever actually played (leveled to 60, did raids +pvp) can attest to that.
---
if it wasn't just a "legacy" server and they intend to update to tbc/wotlk and not do shitty expansions like cata this time they might save it, but not sure. wow doesn't even release their sub numbers lol. it's just the mentality of vanilla that people want back, where everything was time-consuming/hard to earn and thus actually mattered. same people have this mentality with ironman in rs.
---
Yea I think so, that shouldn’t be possible.
---
Bots need to bank, if there is a captcha at random times they will get stuck
---
I have meditations set to read, this confirms I must absorb some stoicism haha thanks
---
RANDY YOUR’E SUSPENDED
---
I normally have no problem reading brainletspeak, but this just hurts my head...
---
Probably eating whenever you want. People are always bitching about safing.
---
I voted no just because it seems abusable by clans or alts and it'd have little to no effect on normal players
---
Can you imagine literally everyone with a stray dog following them around? No thx.
---
Yeah. It's just a uh... quirk of the community, I guess. The phrase gets thrown around *excessively*, it's actually insane. To the point of people saying shit like, "Zulrah is AFK."
---
Like chill, man.. Zulrah may or may not be easy, but neither of us are walking away from our computers while we're doing it.
---
Solo Vangs are legit aids tbf, even CM Vangs are easier than regular solo Vangs bc the health is higher so you dont have to worry about purposely brewing down and doing takeoffs so you don't get reset by bad RNG.

So glad to be watching this episode right now, this series is what got me back to playing this game and inspired me to do my own chunkman!
---
You were playing for 14 hours straight?
---
I don't mind it too much, but it's definitely in the uncanny valley.
---
It's just a defense mechanism you out it place when you get rejected or have low self esteem. I did it for years before I finally lost my virginity at 22 yo. I think its atleast somewhat common.
---
If added, I'd want it as a toggle - separate from the shift drop one.
---
I guess. Would make more sense to save up my GP for t-bow or something
---
Idc how much of a longshot it is, I’ll always upvote a post asking for Arcanists
---
Before MMH quit he hinted at its return, but that was a while ago now and I think he said a lot of things that didn’t really happen so... yea
---
Getting close to a 99 will kickstart your immunity to sleepiness. I was keen to make a dent closer to 99.
---
I don't understand what parents try to achieve with that.
---
Do you use shift click to drop items? It's the same thing. Faster, easier.
---
I don’t get that lol I also kept getting people telling me to take of my shield that’s like me saying to someone who ranges un equip all your arrows
---
I’ve heard black chins arent worth the price increase unless you can make more money than the difference in price in the amount of time you save by using black chins.
---
For instance if it will cost you 4m more to train with black chins but it will save you an hour or two, can you make that 4m back in that same time frame? If not, its not worth it persay.
---
Imo I’d rather do an extra hour of bossing to make the money back than chin for an extra hour with red chins. Depends how wealthy you are I guess!
---
That’s 100% what I said when the ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR sound started from dialup.
---
YES HES BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK :)
---
Boss teleports is the biggest game changer in the game from my experience.
---
The game kicks you off after 6 hours. So you manually re-logged in twice?
---
Lolll
---
Right? I attacked someone in f2p the other day and they kept saying "no arm" which I would assume means no armour. Like why would I remove my armour? Lol.
---
I mean  2.2k isn't that crazy. What you are talking about is the HLC that celebrates playing 30hrs of RS in a row.
---
That’s correct. Why would i stay logged out for?
---
I've been thinking about clue farming for money.
---

---
You can feed it meat and bones you know!

I believe you can also purchase it through amazon to avoid the fee.

Can you explain to me why blessed would be better please I'm curious to learn.

If you have, imbued heart in invent too.

No problem happy ‘scaping

They're right though. Disallowing 3rd party client connections would make it tremendously easier to detect most common botting methods.
---

What's up with this torvesta talk?
---
two and a half fucking hours
---
Lmao (nice)?
---
Actually the reason I'm doing vork is so I can afford a fully stocked POH. So I'm gonna be grinding on POH worlds.
---
I see torvesta is a youtuber, I dont understand all the jokes, though
---
*Confused screaming*

Can vouch best friend is mod reach.

Any reason why this is your 5th time posting this within 8 days? Did you not have a reddit account before this?

Mimic clues
---
I’m late on the whole Reddit thing. Never saw a use for it until friends told me that I can possibly get in touch with a jmod here. And my last posts were instantly taken down for having “banned” in the title.
---
I think in order to address the whole "TBer throws TB then logs out" thing, it could be cleared both on TBer death or TBer logout. Fits in the same way relogging clears your own TB. Could make for it to be more necessary to have decent gear too as a TBer as you may have to fight back, or tank at the very least. I'm sure there's a reason it hasn't been suggested and if someone could tell me flaws pls do
---
Out dpsing that phase is very inconsistent, even with level 99 ranged and twisted bow/blowpipe. I feeling like the inconsistency isn’t worth the try. Just grab 2 and let one heal.
---
Alch yourself.
---
Just to start with, just because I was retarded enough to join a half decade ago doesn't mean I was retarded enough to stay in.
---
Second off, I said corporal is a person, not a person that matters. When you become Sergeant you will officially begin to actually matter, until then you are basically the same of an Untoichable in India.
---
Third, it ain't Cpl, it's Sgt. Specifically, Sgt Daddy, and if you call me anything BUT Sgt Daddy I will personally find who you SgtMaj is, reach out to them, and laugh as you begin to understand every literal and metaphorical meaning of the word "skullfuck"

---
Well. Can’t unsee that.
---
Why not? I like being mobile, have an excellent phone and am able to walk around doing other stuff while I play, doing bits and pieces here and there, and popping it back into my pocket whenever.

You say “2 worlds” as if that’s a deterrent or anything. Those two worlds happen to hold access to the players who potentially risk the most and can be there longest and maximize their kill count.
---
more for the other players

I know, it is very difficult, but I will press on.  Up to 183 dry now

Are rune dragons usually better money than vorkath? If not for rares it seems almost equal ??

What he’s trying to say is just do RC my man

He asking for the dummy to also take the bonus damage that some weapons do to dragons. So no, not really.
---

---
Ah and you know these stats how? Oh right, you don’t know anything for sure, just your opinion and what you hear on reddit.

So he does know what he got banned for. What's the big deal then?

At least part of the reason maxing took so long in 2013 is that we, as a community, sucked at the game.

Your post implies jagex just gave ridiculous new metas to every skill. Roof top agility isn't that much faster than ape atoll, just more tolerable. We shouldn't villify updates like that.
---
Master for autocasting, smoke for dragons lol IDK man
---
You can do it on every Android within the last 2-3 generations that I'm aware of
---
Not sure what the exact formula is, But I know for certain that gaining one level is much more effective than plus one attack or defense bonus.
---
But did we match?
---
As someone with max combat, 2 non combat 99s, and base 70s, I can say certainly that isn't 2.2k total.
---
Once you do dragon Slayer, kill ogress. There's plenty of videos on how to safespot them and they probs have the best drops of f2p.
---
Good luck

Try checking the RS3 wiki, it’s probably a post 2007 item and probably still exists in RS3

&gt; At least part of the reason maxing took so long in 2013 is that we, as a community, sucked at the game.
---
Not really. This is based on the objective rates, not whether people are good at maintaining efficiency and stuff. Although it did assume stuff like nature runes over lavas when lavas was viable (but remember this was at a time where you needed to fund buyables coz alts werent allowed, so your money had to come from somewhere, if not from RC then somewhere else) 
---
&gt; Your post implies jagex just gave ridiculous new metas to every skill. Roof top agility isn't that much faster than ape atoll, just more tolerable. We shouldn't villify updates like that.

They really did though. Ardy rooftops are 8 APM. And its profitable, ontop of being less effort, ontop of being more XP. Its broken on every parameter.

The number actually doesn't matter - Wiki says it should even be 1/284, but the chances are true for any arbitrary amount.
---
Nope, the right click context stays open if you don't touch anywhere else in game. I can even switch to another app and it stays there.
---
Ya
---
I’m not so sure. Statistically for each casket you open, you go further and further over the drop rate. I’m not sure the exact distribution but every open over the drop rate, less and less people will go dry. Obviously it’s possible that you’re the person to continue going past the drop rate, but it’s not likely.
---
We’ll say the drop rate is 1/300. So if we look at everyone whose ever gotten ranger boots, there’d be a normal distribution centered at 300 caskets. The limit would approach zero as you move to the right for people who went 1k, 2k, even 3k dry. But you’re way ahead of 99% of the distribution at 1000 caskets and the odds of being the person to go another 1k dry are astronomically higher than receiving them.

downvoted devalues my 60 magic infernal cape

Can we get Steel Sentinels too? :D
---
your account could’ve potentially been compromised, did you have anything valuable in your bank?
---
no one in their right mind would do such a thing

iv won over 50mill lost big ones won big ones i guess it all depends on who you get and if they are baby sitting it ready to scam or trying to get a rep by paying out wins
---
Hope you didn't chuck a birds nest out of a tree for an osrs post.
---
yeah, I pretty much had a 500m bank... :/
---
keg of beer?
---
fuck, i hate to say it but your account could’ve potentially been hacked, try sending a password reset to your email.
---
Honestly I felt the same way for a long time, but since I’ve tried playing an Ironman while working on my main it’s the most motivated I’ve felt to play in a long time
---
Coincidence? think not.
---
chargebacked payment &gt; wonders why got banned
---
????
---
It’s .net so I can trust it!
---
That doesn't quite make sense. Quests are like requirements for efficiency.
---
The act of training the skill has nothing to do with how efficient you're doing it.
---
# **S W A M P L E T I C S**
---
very nice tab
---
its bis for solo raids and i believe its bis at TOB too, not sure on that though.
---
Well aren’t you that fucking awesome sir lol I’ll just go kms
---
Of course not
---
Thing is, I already sent two resets to me email and I changed my password twice already, it still says invalid credentials
---
Should have bought a desk top, gaming laptops suck, I’ve had 2 and they both died from overheating but now that I got a desktop it has lasted longer than both laptops and is still going strong with only a power supply replacement over 6 years.
---
No... it's kinda addicting that's why I used that word. 
---
Lots have changed, party hats are cheap now apparently, last time I played it was before 2010.
---
Next PvP poll:  If the person who cast a teleblock logs out should the teleblock be cleared?
---
i had an account get banned that had never left tutorial island. i was incredibly confused to say the least
---
The classic. Can't even begin to tell you how many times I got in trouble for staying up late.
---
A whole potato????? I'm lucky if I get to smell a cabbage.
---
Oooooooo an impling.

*Receives 5k drop*
---
I’m glad we are where we are
---
It takes no effort to put on different robes. Don’t be wasteful, save your pray pots.
---
Iirc runelite states they don’t want to release mobile apps because that directly competes with the Jagex app and dilute the popularity so neither of them get as high as osrs could/would achieve.
---
Is the account old enough that you have to use a username rather than an email? Maybe try the username you created the account with, or the email it’s registered too.
---
That was legit me, no fucking joke😂
---
This suggestion is for raids 1, or the Chambers of Xeric. In every raid, the layout or rotation of the rooms is different like when you fight Zulrah. Now, people that do raids normally avoid certain rooms and instead keep scouting for a different raid layout until they find one that is favourable. Efficient teams take this concept and take it up a notch by having their alt accounts do this process instead, while they're mid raid already. This effectively makes scouting a favourable raid zero time, as in you're not wasting your main accounts time (or raids per hour) doing this tedious process. 
---
So, with this suggestion the exact same thing happens as above, except players pay for convenience of not needing to prescout. This benefits people with or without alts, alts can do something else and people without alts can do what people alts are already doing and it will help the economy. If this process was in place and I had paid a 100k fee for every raid I've completed, I'd have paid nearly 100M (I'm 989 kc) that would have been deleted out of the game by just me alone in the hundreds of thousands of players that play osrs and can raid.
---
The amount of things I've had to boost for.. Do wily cats give a better chance to catch rats?!
---
And fucking pegasians??
---
They slimy and squirm down your throat faster.
---
20 arclight damage?
---
Also add "Recent notable HCIM deaths" in the Obituaries that update weekly.
---
Add "In other news" page too, where all the small fixes get pulled from the blog posts.
---
REST api exists, so just make a GET request once a week from the blog post, format it and boom, in-game magical newspaper. &gt;!Please?!&lt;
---
You can use someones maxed house on bounty hunter worlds. World 330 is extremely laggy
---
Unfortunately these sort of items will hit the same sort of block that all high tier tank items do (ely, justiciar); high cost. Just for BiS defense you need 600m. BiD str is something like 140m. That’s a huge divide. And also, things like guthans and Sara GS both work to reduce supply cost further pushing the DPS&gt;defense meta.
---
In the computer lab at school. All the boys were playing it.
---
This is pretty great.
---
I did the same thing a few years ago and it made me realise that next time it's time to get a proper PC. Don't really regret it considering how much of a potato my previous laptop was, it was long overdue an upgrade.
---
This is so good. Great job if this is yours OP!
---
Thanks for not being condescending to a new player, I love this community. Very helpful
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm I wonder OP, think real hard.
---
Yes I would pay $10 for it on steam. I have atleast 3 others who would aswell. We used to have yearly arcanist 'championship' tournaments.
---
It takes effort to buy the different robes though, and ahrims have the better fashionscape bonus
---
It is! I’m glad you like it!
---
 Thought the title said disabled discount and I came in here to talk shit and now I’m mad. Sorry this happened dude.
---
Best part of the amazing video imo.
---
Arcanists and Armies of Gielnoir were bomb
---
Also having to wear the magic secateurs for the bonus lmao
---
Look into both wallpaper engine and rainmeter, depending on the amount of effort you want to exhert
---
No problem, never stop making art please :D
---
You should see my spade collection
---
When group Ironman comes out expect us to release a series
---
You can already do this. Remove your raid plugins or launch the official client
---
It's against their ToS clearly, if they allowed everyone to chargeback members and still play then no one would be playing because jagex would be bankrupt.
---
Chargebacks cost the company money by the way, so it doesn't matter if he payed the $11 back because they are still out of pocket the chargeback fee.
---
Yeah it's crazy. I've caught about 5 drag imps and they're always good. Doesn't make sense lucky are so rare.
---
Problem now is all the people hoarding seerculls and Jagex doesn’t want them profiting off it because they’re possibly also the ones who suggest buffs for it. 
---
Like the ffatssmirhaffub guy, but to a much larger scale as he was “kinda” memeing.
---
The minimum to do venenatis is 85ish range and a magic short bow imbued or msb(i).   You can safe spot it and never get attacked.  Craws bow will make the kills go significantly faster but you can make the money to buy it at venenatis.  It's actually a fairly easy boss with how easy it can be safespotted, and there are no requirements other than some basic gear and some combat levels.
---
Right? You spend so much time getting the secret vessel that octopi can get in, but can't leave...
---
Nah just keep "Me" and "Noob". You can tell the Noob is dying of poison already from the green damage marker. No need to double up.
---
It's 1/30 for Med clues in case.
---
I really want prayer scrolls to change back to how it was on release. It was one scroll that you could turn into augury or rigour and it was significantly rarer than it is now. It's price matched its power, costing hundreds of mills to acquire rigour for example.
---
people should just go to sythe. ya ik "muh rwting site" but they have a rep system instead of just buying a pouch off some rando who spams at edgeville
---
Wrong, maxed player here at 7am I'm doing a farm run on my phone in bed before I get ready for work.
---
Same here also - but honestly even without nmz spending the 80m on bandos and prims isnt everyones cup of tea either. I dont think the combat level should represent having it or not lol, I got a friend who spends all his money on skills and hes got more 99s instead of items. 
---
Only reason i have tassys and prims is because i do a lot of melee and slayer.
---
How long you think it would take at MlM if I did it nonstop?
---
Your account is on rs3 not osrs
---
Correct. 3 Landed DWH, 20 landed Arc hits, 200 BGS damage. Then 1 BGS spec midkill
---
It was a fucking mistake... Also I’m sure this gentleman would gladly pay back way more than the $11+chargeback if it meant his account was unbanned. 
---
I’m also pretty sure it’s in the TOS that jagex can ban you for no reason whatsoever if they want, the TOS isn’t exactly ‘fair’, it’s lawyer talk so jagex don’t get in legal trouble.
---
I remember in 5th grade getting caught at the duel arena by my mom at 2 am on a school night. I was jamming out to Lincoln Park with my headgear on :(

Who did he have you look up on twitch? I want to make sure to never watch this person if they stream.
---
Appreciate the help, but RS3 shows the same issue.
---
Gotcha. When I was f2p I trained with amulets for the extra 10 xp per bar. In a skill like crafting which is somewhat expensive to train, you might be saving yourself time/gp down the line by sacrifing that 5gp difference for that extra xp. At 50000 bars thats an extra 500k crafting xp, nothing to scoff at. Just my 2 cents
---
Click edit below your text at the top.
---
You don’t have to if you use obby armor with super combats on normal rumble (don’t even need rock cake). Super super afk with the trade off of less points but same xp.
---
Once I saw a few players discussing scammers I walked up and said if you want I’ll log with your 50k ya know for the nostalgia or whatever to my surprise he gave it to me and so I upheld my end of the deal and promptly hopped worlds.  Weirdest 50k I ever made.
---
I used rune pickaxe only and if i was doing it at a decent pace id get 30k xp an hour. No idea what xp is like with  a dpick, i assume much better though, so you could probably do it in a month if you hard grafted it i'd say.
---
I don't want to flame the person here so check your inbox
---
Why are you so toxic. I’m not even disagreeing with what you’re saying. You clearly don’t get the logic I’m getting at. You don’t cut trees to get logs. You cut trees to get 99 woodcutting, which is the “worth” of the skill. It feels good. That’s it. That’s all. It is satisfying maxing a skill. It’s satisfying getting a pvm drop. How can you not view the game from another point of view? Are you that simple minded? Come on man.
---
Oops, yea nvm I get it now, u right
---
It's fine for somebody who you agree with to do same thing but not for somebody you don't agree with? Okay
---
There are many updates that have reduced time to max, I agree. But I don't think that's intrinsically a bad thing.
---
Gz man, 2k kc so well deserved :)
---
Yea I understand now, makes sense
---
Rs3 gets rougly 850 bots banned per day and with a daily count of 25k players thats roughly 3.5% of daily players getting banned for botting.
---
Most games botting gets worse as player counts go down, amazing that jagex has nearly no capacity to stop osrs botters
---
No it's all good. The alts literally serve no purpose but to make some extra money while I play my main so exp is a non-issue.
---
However since the market looks like it's about to flip in favor of ammys or at least even out. I'll probably shift my main to those while I exercise for the added exp since the GP difference is negligible.
---
Good looking out though I didn't really think about the exp difference.
---
He’s referring to his personal handicap not that he can’t access his account, he’s an Ironmeme

There's some great puzzles and they really make you think if you don't use a guide

Ok ok I get it now. The odds of going 1k dry *after you’ve already gone 1k dry* isn’t the same as going 2k dry
---
This is how I'm doing my quests except I'm not ever using the guides. So far it has worked using a combination of memories of 10 years ago and a lot of trial and error, but I've got 3 clue scrolls in the bank that all need quests that are going to take me a while without guides.

Here's what I don't get. The Vampires of Morytania keep humans under control as they are their food source. We "sneak" people out via Temple Trek, and sneak in new resistance fighters and supplies. It's like the old iron curtain. And yet......we the player can come and go as we please, teleport in and out, even just take a charter ship. Instead of temple Trekking, wouldn't it be safer/faster to just bring in a bunch of teleport tabs and hand them out like candy?

No, there are items that increase magic damage such as an Occult necklace, Mage Arena cape (i), Tormented bracelet, and Ancestral robes, but most magic gear only affects your accuracy.

I did Underground Pass and got into the Elven Lands, but didn't know anything about the other Elven quests and just wandered around Tirranwn getting blasted by traps and lost in the forest.
