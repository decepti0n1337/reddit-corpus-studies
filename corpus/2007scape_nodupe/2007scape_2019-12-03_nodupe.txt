No pet, was hoping to along the way but apparently getting 99 w/o it isn't even considered unlucky. Gonna be one I miss out on.

Well I doubt you're older than thirty, and yet you still manage to be a complete joke.

If you rock cake down then you just let your health slowly regen anyway?  Constantly flicking rapid heal is really why it doesn’t feel afk to me.

It wouldn’t change the answer much

Membership is done in a few weeks (need to get some space from the game) so not sure how good of a friend I'd be haha

With unnatural selection does konar not assign a specific area to slay? Got black demons but no location given
---
YES.
---
I would be ok with that.
---
There are no lizardmen on either path. If you get attacked you're doing something wrong

That was literally the point of it. 5 minute silly edit y’all take this so serious lol

:) the cc isnt very active at the moment we are a lot more active in the discord as whe hosting raids we scout in ccs etc :) but feel free to join :)

A multi-combat area, so if monsters are aggressive, more than one can attack you at one time.

She doesnt assign locations no matter what on TL.

May I ask why you suggest to add titan? I posted last night about ways to increase my XP/hr and multiple people told me to get rid of titan due to the extremely high defence
---
I love the super pigmented blue contrasting the white

Just more convenient cause you can just keep spamming left click and it does a bit more damage.
---
I just use these

Sorry to offend I guess

That means you are in a multi combat area. You can attack multiple monsters at knce, and they can attack you all at once as well.
---
its for everyone :) we can take people on learners, we do all aspects of the game :) from pvm to pvp to clan events etc :) join the discord and post ur rsn in the welcome room to get access to the server and you will be able to talk to everyone :)

Don’t blame me when Jagex shows the incriminating evidence to a court of law. You’ll be sorry John.

Lol nah dude it’s the new j mods; I got perm muted by people mass reporting me because I’m gay and my account was mems since 08; insta deny appeal within seconds. It was because a cc didn’t like me and 60 ppl reported just over my orientation... I believe this 100% and wouldn’t have until I was a victim myself. Just wait bro; it could be you next; I had the same line of thinking  b4. Lol; that mindset is gone now; totally different support it actually got worse... than say 3 yes ago and before. I’d take 2005 support over now 💀
---
This is better
---
Huh, TIL.
---
Probably wrong.
---
Would it be possible (possibly for the next league) to have completion of master tasks be announced to nearby players similar to pet announcements?
---
Sorry, forgot that there are lizardmen in Molch. But the other path is perfectly safe
---
But your number doesn’t make sense.  1/10^10 is something we should expect to see as a community a few times per year.  1/10^12 is something we may see as a community but is not likely.  1/10^18 is something we as a community should never expect to see.

In all fairness I'm pretty sure he's right and it's a US car. Euro models don't have the reflectors in front of the front wheels (which I think are mandatory in the US)

so it takes 4 seconds to get to 1 hp instead of 6?

Thanks.

When I first started playing I would crash people without even knowing it. People would get mad but not say why. I assumed because they wanted the spot all to themselves. That’s probably why my rng is shit.

You wont be able to raid solo but i dont mind teaching you. I went with focus. The 2x xp one is a lot better for points and such but its just not as fun as focus. Some people chose Resilience alond with the prayer one and you pretty much can pray overheads without draining any prayer so its good for that. But raids is so dps focused idk if its worth it.

Neither is similar to a village; but the stronghold is more of a stronghold since you have to go at least a bit into the maze to get in

the tweet is from sononoldschool - if thats the former twitch streamer then keep in mind he literally faked content on stream. I remmeber when DMM first came out, he would stream regular OSRS with a dmm icon added in there. It wasn't a joke either, someone pointed it out that its fake he would get defensive and mods would ban the person.

I think jagex thought like this: Why would we want to recolour other armour now in the same theme, when they could recolour them in different themes for different leagues?

I just don't have the Arceuus spellbook unlocked. Hosidius is the only house I have 100% favor in. I took a long break away from the game and I've been lazy about getting that done haha. I really should have put the time in, especially with 99 farming and 99 magic, but I haven't had a lot of non-afk time to play.
---
There's no discord link on this post FYI

Just turn off attack players.

Yeah, this'll never change

Do we have any more information on ashihama? any new nerfs? news on when poll starts? etc.

This probably isn't the right place to ask, but if somebody could direct me to the right place, it would help me immensely. About a year/year and a half ago I got back into OSRS, played a bunch and then took a break. When I tried logging back in later, the account was banned, I appealed it and thankfully had my account returned. Someone had hacked it and gotten it banned. When I retrieved it I saw that I had lost everything. I didn't want to play anymore. Just recently today I figured I'd try logging in, only to see that the account has been banned again. Except this time, for some reason, I cannot appeal my ban... Can someone please help me get in contact with someone from Jagex so that I can further explain this situation. I put a lot of time and effort into this character...
---
Stalls until 38 then master farmer til 50
---
Can't speak for him, but it's not that crazy. When I was a kid, I used to watch WoW machinimas all day long without even knowing what game they were from. I remember one that was a music video for Re: Your Brains that I probably watched 100 times, while desperately wishing to find what game it was from. Just happens, sometimes. No personal experience with the game is necessary to find the footage or community interesting.

just for your own knowledge though - you can only buy willow comp bow from other players in f2p. You are correct in that you can only get it through an easy clue with is p2p only
---
I value my time at around 7-9m/hr, given that is the going rate for running essence (last I checked). Of course the items will never sell for that amount so I'm just going to keep them.
---
Also supposedly these won't be discontinued so it may be worth just hoarding points for future leagues.
---
Looks like you linked the photo but not the website.
---
Nope, just check the homepage and they'll normally update with a new blog or add updates to the existing blog at the top. That's all anyone here will know.

Okay, it makes sense now, I understand.

Anything original with no numbers etc. generally looks good imo.

I’m just so afraid of jagex deciding that it isn’t as important of an update as something else they’re working on. I feel like I remember them saying that it shouldn’t be too tricky to do, but if that’s the case then why is it taking a year. ughhh.
---
Well this isn’t the appeal for everyone but it’s one of the few games these days that has a real unique experience for every player. I have 2 other good friends who play it and when we talk to each other about the game we’re always sharing new info. One of my friends is 99 farming and loves making money from herbs, one of my friends has quest cape and hardly ever touches combat and only cares about fashion scape. And I have 95 slayer and love bossing. In time where gaming experiences are more standardized ever, osrs let’s you choose your own adventure and have a unique experience
---
well all he wants is pet. hes literally killed 12 thousand KBDS over 30 million range experience. all he wants is the blessing from reddit
---
Ofc they won't be discontinued that'd be crazy. That's why I'm gonna try and cash in on these rewards as I think it will be the highest they'll be. Future leagues will make them more obtainable and have more enter the game.
---
As for 7-9m/hr, that's rather late game estimates. I value most things like this at a 3m/hr estimate. As that's obtainable and done by more or less everyone 
---
You grind leagues for 50 hrs to get the helm, or you grind main game for 50 hrs and pay 150m for helm.

Oh no, it was removed... I really wanted to look at it :(

In Japan, gold is associated with psychic powers, which is why the Marsh badge is a gold circle and the gold gummi in Mystery Dungeon tastes best to psychic Pokemon. In Japanese, Golduck's name is still Golduck, whereas Psyduck's name is Koduck, which means "child duck."

50 runecrafting? You mad man.

Gz real nice! Recommend hitting that afk nmz to crunch out the later combat levels. Good luck.

According to the blog post  “Twisted horns will be tradeable but the helm, once recoloured, will not”

They did not respond, privately or otherwise; I figure they're still hunting through my pms looking for something incriminating to justify it since everyone else got a prompt response.

ah sad times well, at least I know how to kill it

Weren't they 500k when t10 emblems were 2m?
---
Use a max hit calculator. But it's much easier to just use aggressive all the time because +3 attack doesn't really do anything.
---
That's why I haven't stopped playing TL yet, I'm so used to the 5x that going back to 1x exp might actually kill me.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the advice!

Fucking lmao

Lol you picked 3x harvest 😂😂😂😂

Yes please would be nice to have a single good reward

That's actually a pretty good compromise

trust me i fucking regret it.

This makes me happy

You generally want to do Stronghold before Village because you need to return to the spirit tree to get to the second patch, and Stronghold's patch is a closer return trip to the tree.
---
No, that's what this post is about...
---
I personally love it, summer is one click and mad chill with pretty competitive rates, especially considering the simplicity. The lower level ones could use some love though.
---
I absolutely imagine so. There is just a shop in the main game that is bought from using League Points. You'll earn those in any league you play in, and I assume that reward shop will simply grow. Otherwise they are creating tradeable, discontinued items. Which they've always been against doing.

Absorbs will last a full six hours doing melee in hard anyway, since you should be at 1 HP in either mode regardless, additionally, hard mode is higher exp/hr.

Man he does not get paid enough for the hours he dedicated to this game. I think YouTube pays something like $1k for every million views a video gets from ad revenue. It’s why so many players stream now instead of just uploading exclusively to YouTube.

It only took me 10 years to get the two straight.

It wouldn't be though, it would be supplementing F2P with a better endgame regardless of being a helmie or not.

He's also motivated people that quit to start playing again. 
---
I quit over a year ago, swampletics came out and I was like fuck. He just motivated me to hit some grinds, set goals, and just have fun with what I have.

Awww I see. Keeping 1 hp is not that afk as I wished. Thanks for your info.

Jmods have said it's intentional. Dark Altar Devotion and Arcane Courier have drawbacks too.

If those skills were useless, you wouldn't be able to have zenytes and use rune darts in your blowpipe. You should learn where items in the game come from and appreciate them before you call them worthless. If nobody trained those skills, then you would never be able to have these items.
---
Just because you choose not to make your own darts/jewellery ("it's inefficient") doesn't mean the skills are useless.
---
It's the 10th squadron, get it right!

And you did it without neglecting non combat skills that much. Kudos to you

Depends on what you would like to do, if you want to invest in gear and not skills then it just depends on what bosses, or monster, runedrags? Dragon hunter lance, vorkath? Dragon hunter crossbow/lance, general slayer? A range of mid tier armour and upgrade dps boosting items while you gain money like Weapons&gt;zenytes&gt; whatever else boosts in the skill your using.  
---
If you want a specific boss I recommend googling the bosses name and clicking on the wiki and then clicking on the “money-making guide” it will show bis gear for the boss and you can buy and sell for different bosses. 
---
As I said I like slayer so I let that guide what I’m killing and keep things fresh and I just google things till I felt like I knew the gear I needed for things:) gl and hit me up if you have any more Qs
---
Thank you. I like doing majority of non-combat skills
---
I think that's really weird because no-one is going to wear this armour to pvp, surely? Even if someone did, the magic bonus is so minor that you'd probably want to bring a mage switch anyway, right? I don't know much about tribrid pvp gear so enlighten me if i'm wrong.

Some content is so frustrating on mobile that it’s basically not doable. Construction is an example, it’s bad enough with a mouse and it’s just plain aggravating on mobile. Same with thieving any npc that isn’t left click thieve, like HAM members. Which is niche content but it is basically required for a quest, especially on an Ironman.

There was a bug some time ago where attas seeds apparently did not work properly. Is that fixed? I just used iasor, and with 99 farm i almost never get dead crops (like maybe 1-2% compared to like 10% with attas)
---
You're going to get hate for this because this looks like it's complaining about 3pcs (Runelite primarily) more than CoX scouting but scouting is dumb as fuck even with 3pcs which is a major reason why I prefer ToB over CoX unless it's a mass or CM. There should be an option to pay a NPC for good scouts (3c cropes with bonus fee for overload included) and noobs who don't value their time can still scout for and do 4c unk thieving raids.
---
Nah he can figure it out on his own
---
This was... honestly really well done.
---
MOREEE
---
Congrats!
---
A good sign
---
You're right. I believe the cutoff is n=50  for Z. This analysis isn't super formal, but if I ever record some more for attas we can use the z test. I doubt it will change the p by very much tho

If you look at the wrong numbers I posted for the herb patches, it does seem that way too. But my sample size wasn't large enough to establish statistical significance. Which is why I thought some people might want to see the numbers too
---
Yes.
---
I really don't get where you get that.  Gnome architecture is generally spread out and natural looking, but there's a massive fucking tree in the center, an air force, and like a bunch of other things.  Maybe by a real life standard it might still be a village but by runescape standards 24 people is a city, and there's like 105 gnomes in the stronghold.
---
Catch you guys at the top :\^)
---
Would love to come across an account like this in the wild
---
Maui

Would buy this unironically

I definitely suggest gear. Levels come so passively as you're training slayer. Once you're in the high slayer bracket, you start making SO much. Even the medium bracket you earn a lot through regular drops, like gargoyle tasks, kurask tasks, wyvern tasks, nechs and so on.
---
scuffed bartender btw
---
How do you fit calquat into that route?
---
Oahu here.  Howzit bro.  You got discord ?
---
Can't say for sure if it is bugged or not. The hops definitely shows that the buffs are working. A larger sample size and specific analysis of each herb patch would yield more conclusive evidence

Fruit stalls on zeah till 45 then blackjack to 99

I think the order he did it in his playthrough is different than the order he's suggesting people do for max efficiency. He probably went and did a bunch of slayer before the guide says you should do any significant combat.

You need relatively basic probability and statistics knowledge to understand it. Pretty sure you should be able to do it after a high school education, at least in my country.

If you're just concerned with xp then i'd suggest picking the 5 bosses with the lowest defense. I believe void/d'hide is dependant on your ranged level. Run a [dps calculator like this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit?usp=sharing#null) to find out what's more dps.

Addy plates are more profit than air battlestaff and are about the same price. Green d'hide bodies are good to alch too, they also profit. Use the cc 308anvil or something like that, to buy bulk items. They sell them at a higher price than ge but almost everything they sell is profit.

I'm about 1000 kc dry on tentacle
---
The person in jail banging their head against the bars had me rolling. The foley was absolutely hilarious throughout
---
Wouldn’t the stronghold be the one closer to this battle they’ve been fighting for 20 years? That’s what always fucked me up.
---
That was one of my favorite scenes to film ahaha
---
Trying to find a hidden message... almaw... I give up.
---
Yes
---
Please help me with my stats hw
---
I think this is why I love twisted league, even though the 99 fm at wintertodt seems to be what almost everyone has done, after that is up to the individual and it's like exploring the game again.

It's okay, that account of mine was a hot mess anyways. Thanks

Take the downvote and get out, kid.

Thanks!

Wish I could man..  cost of living is expensive.

And even then use magic shortbow for a lot of things

Sweet, got it, thanks!

That's the same as the Willow comp bow (and god rune)

If you have to drop or trade your items it’s clearly a scam. Wake up.
---
I dont understand, why not just walk to varrock bank? the canoe animation is slow, and edgeville bank is across the river.
---
I know you soulh not drop you items and stuff, the thing i'm warning you about is the instant teleport thing wehn i canceled the trade. Sorry for warning you
---
I found one thing that was for beginner accounts but it didn't seem to complete many useful quests for me. I've had my account since OSRS launched but always procrastinated on quests.
---
[This](https://pastebin.com/0xGyuk5r) might be what you’re looking for if you’re starting a new account as he walks you through doing multiple quests at once. Haven’t looked too far into it but might be able to help
---
It is, but I'm not starting a new account an neither is my account an ironman. I'm simply a forever noob who doesn't like doing quests :P. This seems to be a lot more than just quests but it's a step in the right direction!
---
If you didn't drop your items you would not have lost them. The Pharaohs sceptre is one of hundreds of gimmicks that exploits this basic problem. Don't drop your shit.
---
It’s one of them oldest scams in the book, you shouldn’t have even got to the point where you drop items.
---
I did that lol, i believe just doing barb fish amd tithe took me 20 hours
---
It should only take 1-2 hours to get a bond.
---
No it’s his dds

I couldn't think of something better

---
Turn your messages off public then and if they're on friends only there's your answer.
---
Yes, scout bots as you said. If you tele'd directly to the Fountain, then I would be concerned. But since it seems like you ran there, you probably got scouted and didn't notice.  Remember, these are bots, you only need to be in their range for a millisecond and your location is transmitted to a discord server.
---
(i am mate) Note: we have basically identical stats and equipment.
---
thanks
---
you mean runescape clay? thats what i thought you ment lol
---
Whoever gets the drop is determined by who did the most damage yes.
---
Training one skill at a time or training all three with shared exp doesn't really make a difference, although if you want to get technical about it, training one skill would be slightly better since you get a level faster.
---
With a scimitar though, you definitely never want to use lunge. Take a look at your equipment stats. You'll see you have a much higher attack bonus for slash than for stab. Lunge is a stab attack, which means that you will be a lot less accurate when on lunge, and therefore earn a lot less xp.
---
Holy shit...it isnt just me
---
also how do you geta  firemaking emblem next to your name?
---
Could I get the math on this, was always curious
---
Whoever did the most damage will always get the drop.
---
It could just be fun enough on its own
---
God Ash
---
I'm too dumb to know how to hack, just curious as to how much wealth someone can attain without merching, bonds etc
---
It's being added when they do a big Arceuus quest as I recall from a Q&amp;A, they don't want it just randomly do it.
---
That's awesome!! Will yo8 be making more? It'd be cool to see a godsword or even a clue scroll :P
---
cheers mate
---
cheers bro
---
Damn bro gratz! I got mine on 275, we got pretty close haha
---
It's the bank pin my dude
---
You can get the stats and gear to be able to do semi -efficient barrows runs in about 3 weeks. Good luck!!
---
I nor any of my friend group would have played Twisted Leagues if the rewards weren’t tradable. We’ll all using alts and trading over the rewards to our mains. I can’t speak for everyone obviously, but I imagine there are lots of people doing something similar.
---
I remember reading a post about this a few months ago, I'm very aware of the possibility. I walked from the mage bank and I watched the mini map for dots the entire way. I never saw a single thing, Its entirely possible that there was a bot that is placed strategically somewhere and I never saw it, but yea. This seems really bullshit and makes me sad that the game has gotten to that point. Im ok with pvp content, I could care less I died. Its just crazy and I wish jagex would make statements or show the community it's actually trying to balance the game
---
They are rigged. Don't trade them, just report and add to your ignore list.
---
It's just a scam bud. Stay clear of them.
---
You can do that on most 3rd party clients
---
Yes he did
---
I also think 3m+/h is a little silly - I imagine it's true if we include rare drops however I'm maxed, maxed pool - less than 1 min banking while woox walking etc etc and I hit between 2-2.5m an hour.
---
For reference, my PB is 1:15.
---
basilisk knights are a new slayer creature, zalcano and gauntlet are pretty cool, lms rework and bh reworks also happened and were briefly popular. Forthos dungeon has some interesting stuff including a spider boss. Beta worlds are currently active, proposing lots of new bis items.
---
Can you get the twitch prime membership more than once? Can't find any info on phone
---
Yes, private 3rd party clients with extended FOV scouting bots.
---
Not surprised if what you suggested is possible though.
---
Nah, unrelated. Farming patches are located at static spots all over the map (you may have noticed the one between Draynor Village and Falador while f2p)
---
&gt; Why do we need stronger items in osrs? 
---
Because without some level of power creep they'll run out of niches to fill and **ALL** new content will be dead on release or purely cosmetic, and OSRS will slowly die out due to lack of meaningful updates. Power creep isn't added for 'fun', it's added to keep end-game interesting as time goes on.
---
Yes, that was definitely what you should have taken away from my comment. Good job!
---
So in other words it's 50 50
---
Retard left his private on
---
Fair, from there then: 
---
- check out the 'recommended quests' [here](http://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/optimal_quest_guide)
---
- go for diaries for general account progression 
---
- get into farming for gp
---
And the nezzy is cheap as hell whilst this helm will be a drop from an end-game corp-like boss, so likely pretty rare.
---
Oh. Very cool.
---
Zeah has some quests which gives quick favour.
---
Imagine a country being named ironically.
---
got mine on Sunday at 1143 kc, although still no Smoke Battle Staff :3
---
 train str first for higher possible max hit (more dps)then  attack and def
---
Cuz they lie unless theyre a robot with max banking efficiency and no mistakes during any kill
---
How many kills do you get per trip?
---
I didn’t know this sub existed. Not sure I needed to know. Not disappointed now that I know.
---
that doesnt get accounts you own banned
---
If i was you ive done 1000+ kills  just with blowpipe and elite void and no bgs.
---
Average around 2 .30 minute kills.
---
Use manta rays
---
4 prayer pots 
---
1 anti venom +
---
1 super extended antifire
---
Take 1 sip of bastion potion and eat a angler at the bank then fill back up on mantas .
---
I average from 3-4 kills everytime if your unlucky and keep getting smacked 30s youll do 2 kills
---
What i do is use a rune pouch and have my house in relleka ,make sure it contains laws and chaos and i think its mist runes so ya can tele to house and crumble undead for the face hugger.
---
Do this for a few hundred kills you make lots of $$$ and get yaself a dhcb and dragonfire ward and move onto the fast kills.
---
Hope this helps ,if you need any info or help my rsn is Willberz and i literally vorkath most of the time.
---
Good luck
---
For one, I'd use a neitiznot helm or faceguard instead of the serpentine. If you are killing him on task without a faceguard you're also going to deal slightly more damge with a torture and slayer helm. The rest of your gear should be ferocious, prims and bandos. D claws is also a little bit better than bgs, if you have those. It's also worth using divine super combats over regular ones. These things will all speed up your kills slightly.
---
Next, you want to make sure you are playing on a low ping/low pop world and that your house is set up properly. That means a 3x3 house with only one band of grass all around, and with correct room placement. Also make sure your bank is well organized and you are using sea boots 4, so you don't waste time between trips. The next big thing is probably time wasted looting between kills. If you waste 10 seconds between kills and manage 30 kills an hour, that is 5 minutes you'd be wasting.
---
As long as your in fight mechanics are good, I think those are the main things you might be able to improve on. Hope this helps you increase your gp/hr a bit!
---
Ohh sorry aswell i bought rigour after i made the $$ for it then bought the dhcb, rigour is deffo ya first upgrade but youll be fine with eagle eye till then just a tad slower.
---
Void takes about 6hrs to get on vet boat if you pay attention or about 7 hrs on intermediate. Which even if you play 2 hours a day would be 3-3.5 days dont really see the need for it to be quicker
---
Dont take my ring, have my child instead.

Black Dragons in the Rev caves drop it at 1/5k, black dragons found elsewhere drop it at 1/10k.
---
From the wiki page about Black Dragons: "Black dragons are the only common chromatic dragons that drop the [draconic visage](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Draconic_visage). Notably, the stronger level 247 variant in the [Revenant Caves](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Revenant_Caves) drops the draconic visage at a rate of 1 in 5,000, the most common out of any dragon tied with the [King Black Dragon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/King_Black_Dragon) and [Vorkath](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Vorkath)."

DPS of an Addy Battleaxe (aggressive, crush) is 1.47.
---
DPS of an Addy Sword on accurate (stab) is 1.63 and on aggressive (stab) is 1.80. The Addy Longsword just isn't worth considering as it's widely accepted that it's DPS is almost always trumped by the short version.
---
Get an Addy Sword and use that.
---
that's what happens on limited worlds and places to train in twisted leagues

I used to mess this up a ton as well lol

But I don't have access to veteran like yourself :(

I remember super saying he was gonna gmaul spec avast on one of avasts commentary streams lmao
---
Did you calc just 3 d spears? Rune bar in the drop is also part of the rare drop table loot.
---
The arcane is still one of the best defensive shields in the game overall, not just for magic, so it will still have uses since the difference in defensive stats/prayer is gigantic between them when mage already suffers from relatively low defense. With the current defense you get in various high level mage gear sets, you'd be losing 10-20% of your magic defense and most of your prayer with siren's tome, and conversely gaining an extra 50-70% if using the arcane.
---
If anything, it's less that the item itself is an issue, and more that people in general see defense bonuses as almost entirely useless (The -5 prayer is still hefty though)
---
For example if I wanted to go mage bandos, pking, inferno, or any content where you can't fully protect with prayer or long trips are required (Maybe the nightmare itself?), I wouldn't take the siren's tome.
---
I don't think arcane will be obsolete, see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e50816/festive\_notices\_and\_qa\_question\_thread/f9jkddb?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e50816/festive_notices_and_qa_question_thread/f9jkddb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

This would be so dope. Reminds me of wildfire in GoT. Would take this any time compared to those tier 1-3 outfits.
---
I went for heads an ended up getting everything except vissy before getting b2b heads on 400kc I even got a shield left half. Rng is a hell of a rid
---
If it’s brown, get on the ground *kid*
---
Have some fun
---
Oof
---
Hello. As a mildy upset Arcane owner, I wish for the shield not to become neigh obsolete in high level pvm. In many of the situations you would use it at, defence doesn't matter. As it stands, if the tome passes in its current shape, the arcane (and to a lesser extent Corp) will lose its value.
---
No shit
---
It certainly isnt pod racing
---
Holy hell this is absolutely fantastic. I'm so jealous.
---
Did you follow any guide or something online? I wanna copy this and hang at home.
---
Yeah use adblocker like the rest of us. And enjoy it while it lasts.

Thanks for the account :)
---
It's the Rendi argument.
---
He thinks (definitely still privately despite what he's said publicly) that he should've won the gnome just because he put so many hours into videos.
---
Swampletics wasn't a new idea. Plenty of people had already started series before.
---
They just didn't put enough effort into making it a story.
---
It's just the typical runescape format of "SEE U IN DA CLIPS" and you see a bunch of level ups, drops and achievements.
---
Settled did something much different, in making every minor step and goal feel like character development and not completely shallow and disposable.
---
It also helps that he can take critique and really puts effort (editing) into literally every episode. That's where so many RStubers fuck up. Caveman, Verf and Rendi for example just throw down a bunch of shit and expect that to take them to success.
---
GunsChilli and even Soup (for a little while - he's stopped recently) were the only ones that actually seemed to put any thought into not just essentially giving you their clip folder with voice overs. They did edits and sequences that broke up the flow of the grind.
---
TLDR: Settled broke out because he didn't just make 10-15 minute videos that were essentially his clips from the week with a voice over added. - That's the state/meta of RStube and it has been for so long.
---
Thanks for the acco-.. ew, that name though.
---
You don't need to feel sympathy for Google, but complaining about not getting money from someone who's already losing money by paying you is just pathetic entitlement. YouTube isn't ripping off anybody

The best ways to deal with this boss for MID level players is to reduce the enourmous number of mechanics and make granite dust tradeable.

The best way to deal with this boss for HIGH level players is to reduce the animations.

I legit had no idea haha. Idk I’m being downvoted

Wow, that sounds fun. Thanks for the real answer
---
Quick! Push appeal and log in into that totally safe and not suspicious website!
---
For everyone above 55 defence, which is my point.
---
1. No, if you only have the mage cape and no other mage dmg % gear then it's probably not worth using. Ardy cloak or fire cape might be nice instead.
---
2. That's not how % increases work. If you used to get 6 herbs on average, a 5% increase would give you 6.3 herbs on average.  
---
Also that's not how yield increases in osrs work; the actual change is far more complicated, end result is that the yield increase is way less than 5%.
---
Gnome stronghold mostly just has some posts with rope.
---
Why is this downvoted? Raids/hydra is over 5m/h
---
Isn't this disruptive behaviour?
---
Fuck rendi. Not watching that whiney self entitled prick anymore after his last video

Not sure if you’ve unlocked priff or not. The sand box is directly next to the bank. Literally a one click as long as you don’t hit the tree.  I don’t remember how many buckets it is per hour at the sand grinder. But at the sand box in priff it’s 3k p/h afk.
---
Wait, are you the editor for Mini Chocobo World?
---
In high traffic areas, often PKers will just hop around worlds searching for people. My clan loves to hunt Callisto and glory chargers. I will also say that an unskulled player standing in a corner can be tougher to see on a minimap. The white dot meshes with the lines of a building or something, and if its a wall corner they might be able to hide said scout from normal view. Or a scout bot that has an extended field of vision (which is cheating) could have been used. It is hard to say for sure.
---
Thanks for the account &lt;3

Very likely your work firewall. Try accessing the website through a browser on your phone to confirm.
---
Can we poll making a quick travel option for the Zulrah boat? Every time it asks me to confirm travel it makes me feel like losing my bank at the arena and rebuilding at Zulrah is a choice instead of my lifestyle.

I like dis
---
The wiki gp/hour is including the price of uniques over time. You might do 100 hours of 2m per hour and then get a unique and it increases your rate. As with anything, you’ll get better and better over time. I think I heard a high level say something about it not being worth banking if you still have supplies, even if it means leaving some loot on the ground since in the time you bank, you could get another kill.
---
You sound angry. Are you okay?
---
They never intended pets to be something grinded out, lets have them keep their value
---
There is if the tome by itself is nerfed to something nearly equal to the malediction ward, maybe slight prayer bonus (not saying that’s what it should be, just an example)
---
stop botting it ruins the game
---
No guide, just practice. This is my third set. I made the runes out of paper clay dyed with a bit of black acrylic paint. I painted them with a acrylics, then sealed them with matte Krylon. They're mounted with velcro so I can take them out whenever I want.
---
Yup. I mentioned that as one of the reasons why the yield is so similar for herbs and why I didn't find any difference for yield per patch and death rate. Would be interesting if someone wanted to examine each patch separately. But I'm comfortable with using both for my runs now without worrying that I'm missing out on profit
---
he lost his pmod powers on his account tho, and its not as if jmod accounts are for real use. so yes, he did.
---
What is your main account? Asking for a friend
---
Yes. And if you are botting, you should be banned.
---
Yeah 100%, i can do maybe 4 hours before i just give up. Doung the same shit over and over bores the hell out of me.
---
They’re not prehistoric though haha
---
Me too. It just baffles me when these people act like anyone could do what some of these more hardcore nerds do if they *just had the time* and *weren’t so busy and successful*.

mole is the closest thing osrs has to geese

That's fair, you actually made this relic sound appealing.

Lmao does anyone have the backstory of this picture

I am saying for cosmetics bro. It doesnt have to be camoflage. Just a wintery theme with orange in it. Its Winter Todt
---
Thanks. Sorry for the late reply.
---
Although I have to say that death banking is not necessary at all, as I've been doing tons of stuff in the wilderness without doing so and I'm nearing 1750 total.
---
I feel you, man. I’m 11079 KC with HALF the drops you have. I know some of the chains are from KQ and what not, but still. 
---
I just want that pet so I can move on and not dread that cave so much anymore.

I don’t get this what degree allows you to play osrs for 12 hours a day?

Of course mate, I'm using it in an informal context

What are we supposed to be looking at

You're judgy.

Train stats and do quests/diaries and become  a high level account
---
Well, I definitely agree that reasons surrounding making any game like Runescape easier are lame. It's been a grindy game since its release.
---
I wouldn't say grinding is a skill. Most of the people you refer to as having a ton of responsibilities could easily veg out on their days off and spend 16 hours fishing (and some do). I used to for that matter. It just comes down to how you want to spend your time. Let's say you are "Mr. Responsible".. do you really think he would WANT to sit down for 16 hours on his day off and grind fishing? If so, so be it. If not, do you really think he doesn't have any kind of mental determination? Yes, playing runescape all day could be on par with just watching Netflix or Youtube during that same time but it still comes down to how you want to spend your time.
---
 Going into a vegetative state and being "mentally determined as such that's on par with athletes" for 16 hours doing a monotonous task on a computer screen is not a skill, it's an unhealthy obsession. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm the guy who DOES veg out for hours "grinding" on my day off and will still have these opinions.
---
Ain't nothing wrong with a rock cake.
---
Not quite, but close. Herb patches have 3 lives, and every time you pick an herb, it has some chance of consuming a life. This chance is based on a number of things, including your farming level. 5% more yield means you are 95% as likely to consume a life as you otherwise would be.
---
Each level of compost adds another life, so an herb patch with ultra compost has six lives, and you'll never harvest fewer than six herbs from it.
---
It's not that bad
---
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor
---
Don't you unlock stronghold first?
---
&gt; It just baffles me when these people act like anyone could do what these more hardcore players do if they just had the time and weren’t so busy and successful  
---
the way you word is it very negative, but yes it is possible for almost anyone to invest enough time into perfecting any skill set, unless they have some kind of physical or mental disability that makes it harder for them to learn things.  
---
in terms of the top rs players wasting their 'gift' - there are personal reasons why they choose to invest their time into these skills and although it might be possible (unless a disability would prevent them) for them to do something different, and be great at it, they choose to play rs for their own reasons, you just have to accept the fact that it's their choice.
---
Shhhhniipee
---
Harvester is the one your want if your want unlimited supplies.
---
Every snap/ranarr seed roll from a farming contact ends up being 3 seeds, and you get 3x yeild from those seeds.  Ends up being like 75 ranarrs/snaps per roll.
---
If you're -63 or less magic attack you'll splash.  What's your gear setup?
---
"In many of the situations you would use it at, defence doesn't matter"
---
Yeah, because it's basically a useless item lol. Mage accuracy is irrelevant in a large majority of cases as whatever you're maging has horrible mage defense anyway. I bet if you went to do some bossing right now, and just didn't equip your Arcane, you wouldn't notice any sort of difference.
---
Ill be doing that soon too :( finally did hosidius quest and almost done with Shaz quest. Then going to do Shaz favor at lizardman, then pisc favor. I have charcoal burning for making dynamite should be done soon

Almost 200m total exp, base 80s, tons of playtime and PvM, and no pets at all. 
---
My Ironman alt got the squirrel and rocky in the same day before even hitting 40s.
---
Ok, that phrasing is much better. Top half sounds more reasonable than some unknown high percent.    
---
Bruh around 110 herbs in 13 days, with a handful of slaughtered unicorns aint nothing to boast about. That's like one farm run a day. If I had to make both super anti's and prayer pots at like a 1:3 ratio I'd have never put shamans on the list of things to try.  
---
No shade taken my man. I understand that my stance as well as resilience is unpopular and that the relic earned its &lt;1% pick rate. If you were playing the game normally like you would any ironman mode in the main game, there is 0 reason to pick it whatsoever.
---
If you equip a bgs then cast it you will hit 100% of the time its gotta be -68 to hit 100%

this pleases me

That’s prebis until tbow

https://i.imgur.com/Adkbkla.png i'm 5k dry for pet at kraken, but here's my thermy log
---
i pass my thermy luck onto you (hopefully it works like that)
---
The roll is the same each time, the plant has a number of "lives" which can be depleted by disease and when picking. By default I think herbs have 3 lives, each time you pick you roll for consuming a life. Compost adds 1 life, super adds 2 and ultra 3. I have gotten 23 herbs from one patch before, and others have gotten higher i'm sure.
---
I was thinking in like order of being used, but I like how you think
---
Because of the risk of players finding bugs that’ll allow them to abuse the game and possibly break it.

Like when dungeoneering came out in rs3 people found so many ways of walking anywhere they liked such as in other people’s instances, by allowing everyone to use an orb that lets you freely roam any area from whatever view you like it’d only be a matter of time before someone found a game breaking big.

Can someone provide insight on how ticks/running/movement work together. As in what speed or 'squares per tick' do you move at? I've been curious about this in general, but I'm specifically looking at Tithe Farm right now. I'm wondering what the most effecient way to move in between spaces is.  
---
For instance it seems like when I move across the rows its a tick faster to click past where I'm aiming, and then stop myself by watering. But I can't tell if this is true or not.  
---
But anyway, any tips on how tick manipulation works with movement would be appreciated. :)

nice man.. i have 100% hosidius and arceuss favor now working on pisc

Let me add avernic hilt to my Elysian spirit shield we can call it the Elyvernic shield! It can be a dark grey/black 😱
---
They should just make the book not have the bwst accuracy aswell as damage... make the shield the most accurate

10 mind runes and a brass necklace.

POH tele, ornate pool (which should be next to your jewellery box), teleport to edgeville (shortcut N on jewellery box), bank, sea boots teleport.
---
Also, make sure you aren't wasting 20 seconds looting after the final kill, that is a pretty decent time waste for many people. Same goes during a trip, just pick up the loot after poking him, it takes like 5 seconds for him to wake up.
---
That’s... that’s what pseudo code looks like...

Same...

It doesn't matter if the account can't mute anymore, the person behind the screen still holds power over the game, even after blatant abuse.

you think when they coded it they just put in a math equation? lol

Very exciting. Congrats!
---
Hasn’t pretty much every new boss introduced  a new bis item? Why should arcane be protected but other items can get outclassed no problem
---
Noted potions are on the same rare drop table as third age, albeit much more common.
---
Sounds like they should test the item more thoroughly and give it everyone, instead of just giving it to a select few.

Scamming is against the in game rules, as you can find below, so no he hasn't earned the right to anything other than to be banned.

If you are actually trying to justify or believe that scamming and luring is acceptable and that what this guy is doing is ok, you are seriously part of the problem, no ones wants to be lured and lose their hard earned stuff.

Thats a low lvl account, sorry bud. Start working on more quests. Make sure RFD is done, get firecape once you have 75 range.

Your pet analogy would make sense if it was jad pet. I forget the exact rates but on average it's like 1/175 I think?

But the 'tiz zo' part. Does it mean something along the lines of: "it's like that"
---
Gotta flex that 92 slayer as well
---
You move 1 square per tick when walking, and 2 squares per tick when running. 
---
And you are correct, it is faster to click beyond and stop yourself with an action.
---
It kind of is considering the incredibly small number of written sources from the period. There are a few hundred runestones and that's it. And if you've ever read a runestone, you'd know how little they really tell you. One of the most important runestones is the large Jelling stone. It literally says: "King Haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of Gormr, his father, and in memory of Thyrvé, his mother; that Haraldr who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian." And then there's a drawing of Christ. That's it. So kind of prehistoric in a sense, if you ignore outside sources.
---
I didn't even consider this. Time to fill up my desert theme house with fish bowls lmao
---
That's it?
---
Considering the tree that connects all other spirit trees is in the village, it makes sense for the village to be #1.
---
That's only better for enemies with a magic level. 3A is faster and can shoot dragon arrows as well so it's more dps in general.
---
Depends what kinda stuff you like. Just setting a goal and working towards it is pretty much the core of the game. If you want to skill some people set the goal of getting base stats to even out but I quite like to focus something to 99. If you want to quest/combat the main thing to aim for is barrows gloves providing you haven't got them. My current aim is to be able to farm Vorkath so I'm grinding through the quests/diaries/levels for that.
---
This was really entertaining and well done. It's crazy how much animation smoothing adds to it as well. Can't wait for episode 2!

i got 99 RC with air runes only. I had so much fun!

Ceremonial helms did have them, but you're right, none worn for combat ever had horns or wings because of how impractical they would be.
---
Do you do high level contracts? I'm always running out of ranarrs and snaps. High level contracts only ever give me shit like lantadyme and dwarf weed.

Honestly I wish the events had a bit more to them. But in this game anything that isn’t new end game content is trashed by the community.

Regular spells are fixed max hit, mage level will not alter it. Trident/slayer dart are exceptions, which have max hit impacted by mage level.

Max hits for regular spells are only impacted by gear i.e. Kodai wand, ancestral etc

That's assuming he's an ironman.

If he was an ironman he would need 95 slayer for ferocious gloves (Without boosts)

What’s your cb lvl?
---
I just did the diary and most players below 100 cb had a hard time finding teams
---
I'm not sure man. My guess would be the lack of debuff item is making the difference, or like I said earlier, lack of proficiency. Not trying to say you're bad or anything,but even 1 or 2 unnecessary hits per trip can cost you a kill. 
---
As for Warhammer vs bgs, I've heard bgs is better as well, but when I ran my calcs the Warhammer came out ahead by like .1 dps or something (don't remember the specifics, it was a long time ago). In terms of personal preference I much prefer the Warhammer tho because it have about a 50% chance of lowering his defence by about 60. Where with the bgs I hit a lot of sub 20 hits which basically amount to no difference in my kill. Either way though, if you're using neither, either one will be an improvement.

In a pvp clan, scouting bots (which of course we do not use) will only be able to detect you/send info about you if you are within their minimal.

Congrats dude. I remember back in the day when I got 91 doing ZMI. Was so happy and then did double nats till 99 and made bank. Oh the good times...
---
Right but the majority of skilling for the majority of levels is worthless.  Ex: cutting magic logs
---
OP, your methodology is not clear. 
---
1. You need to be doing a paired t-test here. Why/how are you doing unpaired? It's not clear to me what numbers are going where. Are you using the sample mean from attas as the null hypothesis and testing whether iasor is different than attas? If so, this is not the proper way to show that the two seeds are meaningfully different. 
---
2. What is your hypothesis? Ideally, you would calculate what the average yield \\mu\_a (attas) and average yield \\mu\_i (iasor) should be, and your null hypothesis should be that the actual yields are consistent with what the theoretical yields should be. 
---
3. If it's not possible (or you don't feel like) calculating what the theoretical yields are, your null hypothesis should be that \\mu\_a - \\mu\_i = 0. This is probably what you want to do since I don't see the average yields posted anywhere already and it seems somewhat complicated to try and calculate it (depends on disease chance for ranarrs). 
---
4. This goes back to 1), bu you really need to doing a paired t-test here. You want to test whether there is a difference between these two seeds. This is not what an unpaired t-test is testing for. 
---
If you want to post your data (an excel file would be great) I'd be willing to help you out with this.

I don't think its as common as people think. Like F2P is and forever will be packed with bots, but you can't do anything about that. P2P bots are a pretty small portion of the bot population. Despite what this subreddit likes to screech, Jagex is pretty effective at banning bots.

---
on a side note, why don't more new gear work this way?
---
i feel it helps avoid power creep and keeps old content from becoming dead content while also being an item sink (assuming its not reversible)
---
like eventually bandos/arma will have to be beaten by new gear. i'd much rather it be add ons to bandos and arma which adds melee/range strength than a totally new armor which outclasses it in every way
---
that way, great content like godwars isn't killed off

You consider a relic that basically requires you to have multiple skills at 80, if not 99, to be a baseline goal? I feel like I've done the bare minimum to get task points, and I'm still about 290 points short of Tier 4 (and not at all looking forward to the two or three grinds to get there).

my only 99 right now is farming and i just did that over the course of like 6 months. doing an allotment+herb run every hour or two and then a fruit tree run every day
---
for more active skills, just play the game. if you dont want to just sit and grind for hours on end with one skill, just do other activities that utilize that skill like slayer or bossing. youll level up eventually
---
I wish they would leave or slightly remake more holiday events to have as short f2p quests available at any time like they did with Misthalin Mystery.

You just do it. Not really helpful but that's all it is. It helps that osrs is always a background thing for me. I have a 2nd monitor with something else on at like all times.

My first 99 I just did it off and on until I got there. My second I grinded every day 8 hrs per day while at work.

I second this.

Let’s be fair if they redid nightmare zone to include all bosses you have killcount on and had a mutation mode where bosses would be randomised like this in a variety of ways it would be fun and hilarious

Probably would take a lot of dev time to mix and match every single boss so I guess they’d only do a couple

I usually just have osrs has a background thing whenever I'm watching a show or movie.  It's easy to just get lost on what you're doing on osrs, if you're barely paying attention to it.

That is for solos only correct? I realize you lose a lot of dps but efficiency aside, if someone wanted to do very chill group raids the method would work right?

Can someone please explain what's the point of grinding in this video game? Like all you're going to get a few numbers on the screen, a nice in-game item that will last forever and hold no purpose in real life other than just satisfy all your hard work for a temporary amount of time. In the ends you won't get anything out of it. It's a painful and long process for nothing. So why do you people do it? Please make me understand.

Yeah but buying air battlestaffs in bulk is easier.

I think they mean how someone DID this for this scene but its Lil' John, so OP copied the idea.

You for sure bought your gold, but when you have b gloves to go with your F cape it'll be a lot less noticeable.
---
you can pay people to let you kill them. its a trust trade- either pay them first or split half first half after. if you are in the baby pure/baby med combat bracket (like, below lv80) this is like 10 times easier and cheaper, above this bracket like 90% of the pkers are really sweaty max effort people who dont give a fuck about a few hundred k gp.

I'm so proud of all of you guys in the comment section. Your values are at the right place.

No it isnt, its worse design to shoehorn a way to keep an old item relevant for no reason other rhan muh nostalgia

I mean, I woudn't mind if Arcane was like 1/Gazilion drop rate
---
It's for team raids too if the players are all good enough, obviously the more players there are, the more chance there is of something going wrong though.
---
But for your calculations, they're correct. Although I'm not exactly sure how much time you'd actually save in prep, and I'm pretty confident that any time saved during prep would be negated by the DPS loss compared to taking Focus.

Do we really need to praise people for reporting crimes to the authorities? I've reported a robbery before and all I got was a, "You did the right thing" and a fist bump from the police officer and that was more than enough.

At no point did I say, "I should make a video about how I'm a hero and how the police tried to cover it up to save their own reputstions!" which is, essentially, how half that video of his even goes.

Also, here's some discord chatlogs of Rendi's friends discussing Rendi's exposé:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/e376lj/video_proof_of_bea5_answering_questions_in_rendis/
---
While it is a he-said, she-said situation at the moment without any further developments, it does put Rendi's position in reasonable doubt.
---
Basically, don't praise Rendi like some sort of divine savior of Runescape. Just give him a fist bump, say your obligatory "Nice" and move along. Enough to let him know he's appreciated but not enough to feed his ego. After all, once we know the full story from all sides, maybe things will change.

You can also just use sticky keys, turn them on then click Shift twice and it will hold down shift for you

I doubt he's waiting for them. He's just working on training his combat stats and in the meanwhile working on some gear upgrades if possible. He already has black d'hide top/bottom, so getting blessed is literally just a +1 prayer bonus from each, definitely not something he would hold up the account to acquire.

i mean again, the fact that they have that much xp is pretty much a clear indicator it's not a bot. botting is not viable long term in osrs.
---
Oh maybe farming or fishing ))
---
This sounds ridiculous, but it saved the game for me. Find two or three good friends, transfer everything you own to an alt account, and start where you are now with your friends from scratch as a group Ironman team (basically just no GE). It skips all the “necessary” quests and early leveling you are “required” to do as an Ironman (the reason my friends didn’t want to start over as Ironman is because of the whole “min-max”, must do everything super efficient as an Ironman thing), and lets you essentially start fresh with a group of people you like without having to get worn out the first week getting 99 firemaking, or having to level up all the way to get teleports or anything like that. 
---
Set group goals with bosses you can fight together with your ultimate goal being completing raids. The short term boss goals with other people involved make it so you don’t have to do everything (one can fish and cook while another fletches arrows, while the third thieves for money for runes, etc.). Only having to focus on one thing for the good of the group made it much easier to log on and just do it. Also it felt better cause if you didn’t do your job, someone else in the group had to pick up your slack, so you felt more accomplished when you got it done. My friends and I ran into the same slump you are in about a year and a half ago, and just completed our first raid a couple weekends ago, it was super satisfying.
---
Oof that sucks.. Thanks for the explanation

if you are going to be doing zulrah you want to bulk buy the shitty antipoisens at tai bwo, or you want to use cure me on the lunar spellbook, and yeah its 2 sips.

Just keep at it! Will get it eventually. Hopefully soon

Medium brain

like him losing his ability to mute? :P

How is it handing it out to unlucky people?  How is it not already earned?  If the time and effort is made, how is it not earned in comparison to someone who just got lucky a few kills in?  How did they earn it?
---
I'm not saying throw away good luck, good luck feels great in the game.  I'm not even saying throw away bad luck.  I'm saying to put safeguards in place against terrible luck.  The kind where someone makes a colossal effort to earn something, more than most of us all combined, but it still doesn't drop.  That's all.  Why the fuck shouldn't that effort be rewarded?
---
And I'm absolutely certain that you've never been at -8 on a topic that you actually know something about.  There's no way you've never been downvoted by people when you're talking about a subject you actually spent a lot of time learning about /s
---
How does someone obtain a lance in TL? I know the hydra claw, but how do they get the hasta part and assemble it?
---
No, "skilling" is obsolete because it requires 0 skill or effort. There's still skilling methods that are great money makers, it's just the braindead skilling methods that are worthless - as they should be.
---
Wait until you meet DevinEssence.
---
It's good RNG but not insane, after 91 kills there is a 1,8% chance of having gotten that drop.
---
Buy some flax and make bowstrings. Idk this a "chose your own adventure" type of game so it's up to you. Tons of resources out there depending on what you like to do.

Swampman still takes luckies as well. They’re both progressing their accounts while passively accepting luckies.

i mean he's talkin about shark prices pre minnows, in response to the "oh, skilling used to be profitable"

I hope this meme never dies
---
This was discovered in the first beta and I reported it on the feedback thread because I thought it was a bug too.
---
Gotta get that 60wc and the hosidius favour required as well. Good luck.
---
I can give you one
---
it's mostly the fact that you can do raids on one account, or you can fish eels/anglers on like 10-15 accounts while afk skilling on your main and both take the same amount of effort.
---
I don't see blowpipe up there???
---
So I am 86 fletching. That's how I make most off my gp. I only keep about 1mil worth of supplies in the bank .
---
do you accept candy from strangers as well?
---
Passive GP flow with only 5M will barely get you anything. You should try gear upgrades like fury, bring, whip, etc.

Dude are you ok? Who hurt you?

Thank you kind sir. Saved for future medical research.

And closer to Zamorak
---
I don't believe he used *just* guthans. I believe he used guthans as the way to outlast the previously thought mandatory dps check 
---
However he might have gone back since then (or someone else) and welfared it with just guthans and some prayer flicking. Id love a link if that's the case. Sounds interesting.
---
fucking nailed it. I love this sub
---
This is one of the better auto-corrects I’ve seen.

Yeh you can play any league and buy any of the cosmetics. But I don't see a need for those cosmetics to be untradeable. You have the showoff cosmetic in the league trophy anyway. Which unfortunately I personally think is extremely ugly.
---
I tried to add you, it says unknown player.
---
What do you mean? "Easier clues" does not influence your drop rate, only how quickly you can complete clues. I am talking about all those people that got things like 3rd age on their first couple clues.
---
Thieving and questing are the next big things, also farming guild for contracts.
---
I'd say focus on getting barrows gloves, then you have everything you need to start Slayer grind. Which in turn leads to bossing

What does their number of completed clues have to do with it?

This comment is so confusing. I read it three times and still can't figure out what you're saying. Are you talking about "Island" the Danish name for Iceland, or "island" the English word for a landmass in the ocean? If it's the former, why would the English spelling of Iceland need any explanation at all? If it's the latter, who was the "they" making decisions about how to spell "island" and why were there any decisions to be made about a word that had been around for hundreds of years? And lastly, regardless of which one you meant, how could someone "attempt to make it sound" anything which also not "consider how it's pronounced"? Aren't sound and speech the same thing??
---
Someone please help me. I'm losing my mind over a stupid reddit comment.

Oh Alucks, please never get thermy. Then what will we make fun of you in discord for?

The way I remember is Tree gnome village is the first part in the quest you talk to the spirit tree, so I just focus on the tree part when im thinking of where to go. For gnome strong hold I always have to do a double check in my mind as if I'm about to do something wrong.  
---
But in a way I think the descriptions are right. The village is a lot smaller, it's just you can see the walls and maze more predominately from every where you stand.  
---
The stronghold is much larger and in a way more of like their main base of operations. I would agree though the lay out does feel much more like a big empty village. The whole thing is walled in, like tree gnome village, which I would also call a stronghold because of it's defenses.

Reddit is so fucking gay. Medical research XZDDDD idk why I get so tilted over you guys but you need a good bullying

Bear got infernal cape with 1 range? He really is the master of pvm

I'm currently having trouble logging in, just stuck on connecting to server, but this is my first issue, was fine earlier today.

he's actually wrong tho. 5-10% of the active playerbase is bots. Jagex told us

For you, owning a house is meaningful in life. I doubt those other two guys give a flying fuck. Let them enjoy what they want to enjoy.

360 no scopes is definitely a millennial thing.

Yeah, but then someone could grab the wings/horns and pull it off, or drag you down, which is a bigger problem than looking bad ass.

Damn who is she😍
---
Where’s the iron mace?
---
Nice work tho
---
You still claim them at the end, just not actively as you go..
---
Yeh you can farm more clues for sure but you still have to hit 3a. That's the rare part.
---
Well Settled went 24.4k dry. I believe in you.
---
Tl;dr: if two methods have the same result, choose the one that's more explicit. 
---
What's your reason for preferring the increment? Both from a readability and functionality perspective, I feel `= 1` is far superior to `++` or `+1`. This is because `= 1` is explicit in what it is trying to accomplish, while increment incidentally achieves the desired result based on other logic (the if statement, in this case). This forces you to equally consider multiple variables when following program logic, making the program harder to follow and introduces points of failure. It's a bit nebulous to explain this in depth with such simple sample code, so I'll explain with an example. 
---
Say there was a bug where the relic was allowing negative damage. The code could simply be adjusted to `if(x &lt;= 0)` and the `= 1` case would already be perfectly accommodated. In the increment case, the `++` line would also have to be changed. At best, this is doubling the work you have to do, and at worst it generates more bugs ("why is the damage *still* negative!?").
---
In the `++` case, you are relying on two bits of logic interacting in just the right way. In the `= 1` case, you are just running two sequential bits of logic. In the latter case, once you've read the if statement, you can forget about it and focus on the internal logic. In the former case, you have to *remember* your conditions of entry.
---
Or you can just grab them all. Its literally a waste of time to talk to the librarian anyways if you have runelite. But grabbing all of them is much faster then one at a time
---
You know I always keep that mothsfuckin thang on me
---
Right but you could still ger lucky and get it in main game on clue #2... Like the dude here did...

 Hey bro join Reb Lobby cc I’m one of the owners! Medium sized clan of mains and irons all high leveled at the moment but we are looking for everyone who wants to just be part of a fun group who wants to make each other better so one day we can have a stronger clan. We do everything content wise you can think of daily and there’s always people to hang out with even if it’s just shooting shit in the cc. Lmk bro we’d love to have a new friend!

Pvm rewards and skilling rewards should not be mixed in an ideal world.
---
he stopped playing a decade ago so...yea
---
Yeah but someone who only has 6m probably shouldnt tie up their cash for go knows how long.
---
Rev caves have been held down by skulled PvP clan farmers 24/7 since release. It’s all worth so little now.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Vork 2nd time lol.
---
This is a bad thing?
---
I need this in my life
---
Well I was exaggerating but it serves no real purpose apart from being annoying
---
Considering that it no longer exists, it seems that Jagex and most agree
---
Congrats man! Oh wait, I mean... Lmao come back when you've done it blindfolded on a 15 combat prayer-only hcim
---
I’m in his Iron Club. Now you join, broke boi
---
Yeah thats true  
---
I just find revs to be way more active and fun to pk at since the pkers there arent the greatest either and not bringing max mage to pile 1 or 2 guys
---
If anyone was wondering:
---
* Trident is *amazing* if you're struggling with Zuk's healers. Xzact mentions this in passing in his guide. It is definitely worth a try.
---
* I had dragon darts in the blowpipe for Zuk only, the addy ones in my inventory were for the waves
---
* I had a bolt pouch and a blessing because wearing the blessing in early waves and having both diamond and ruby bolts in the pouch uses the same number of inv spaces as just equiping one and keeping the other in my inventory
---
* I used DFS over crystal shield because I didn't think 8 range def when not blowpiping was worth the degrading cost + 21 slash def for the odd melee attack.
---
* It took 77 attempts. Completing inferno for the first time with no T Bow, Ely, Justiciar, or SGS is hard. I consider myself lucky to have the want. I guess I'm also just not as skilled as the people who get it quicker, but able to get the cape is skill enough for me.
---
Sea shanty 2 fits perfectly in so many memes I love it
---
This is likely the case. Just got way more orders than expected and decided to have more made.
---
Isn't Swampletics also over after TOB?
---
*Proper pseudocode* is an oxymoron. The point of pseudocode is to be something that programmers can understand, but it won't *necessarily* compile. This doesn't mean it *can't* compile, just that compilation isn't a pre-requisite, as it is for actual code.

Gratz :)
---
You never know.
---
Don't know if anyone remembers but I think it was mid 2012 RS2 had a huge bot nuke and world player numbers went from 700+ to 200-300, game felt so empty after that just seeing the low numbers whenever you went to login after the game looking so "active" for so long
---
But what's the real halfway point
---
It will be hard to invest those 6 mil and get some decent profit, but with my experience in thieving I highly recommend you start training Thieving and buy wine with 100k gp I guess it will be enough to get 99 Thieving... Believe me this skill is so afkable and profitable and you can easily get money from it.
---
id wear it :\^(
---
In my opinion, it added a little bit of spice to the game. As a child I would be terrified of the chicken and the shade, or losing my brand new adamant axe, so I would make sure I'm playing the game carefully. There's plenty of (annoying) things without real beneficial purpose, but I don't think that's necessarily a reason to remove it.
---
I understand it doesn't fit in anymore with the current playstyle of OSRS, but I definitely appreciated it as a kid!
