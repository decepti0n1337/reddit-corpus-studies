2018, my brother said he downloaded runescape 3 but it turns out that it wouldn't run on my dad's imac from 2008 so I tried oldschool instead

Growing up I always said arduhnooj. No idea why

Everyone talking shit about him for his legit 255+ attempts when probably the majority of capes are bought with teamviewer and barely anyone even has one in the first place lmao.
---
Its a dude.
---
Not bad for your lv and hp
---
Nearing 6k I'm gonna guess his was around 2-2:10. Only going off the pic tho
---
I’m pretty sure if it’s ‘just tick eating’ he could do it almost flawlessly without any failed runs. But I’m sure you would know better right, you’re the best PvMer in the game.

In all reality, I find it strange they decided to hide the poll results and then announce warding to come up for voting the week after.

Upkeeping the intended 'max' nature of the BiS variants sure seems like a reasonable reason.
---
Jagex should hire them and make them work together in a group
---
Hour or two? You could get 40 fletching within like 10-20 minutes.
---
That statement gives me solid proof you are speaking out of your ass and don’t read anything.
---
What part of “15-30 seconds per question minimum to get the incentive. You can still spam through questions if you want but no reward” do you not understand?
---
For group ironman: this could easily be done between friends by just boycotting the G.E. Seems fun

Even attractive men don't do that well on Tinder, let's be real. You have to be a Henry Cavill-tier to even get like 20+ legit matches and in a really big city you're fucked regardless. Women can accumulate 500-600 matches within a couple of hours and be as picky as they want.

Oh yeah? Then cite *your* sources. I think it's "Ardougne". Intact I know it is, smh.

Would the aoe of chins be different to the aoe of barrage here?

And anyway, hitting someone who's hit you with aoe like that doesn't skull you, even if you weren't their actual target.

the tasks that you burst/barrage and next to 0 magic defense, so more mage accuracy doesnt really do anything at all.

Yes.

okay but when is the fletching cape's perk being made non-useless

This game is full of inconsistencies that actually matter, this is one that doesn't matter because it's a case of a cosmetic cape that 0.1% of people use.
---
What about the ogress warriors or the Ankou? I’d like to see that!

Not when you do it like a head dent

No one cares about the “no one cares about the no one cares” comments

Have you heard of this new thing called "opportunity cost"

But Slayer already has multiple pets from the different Slayer bosses.
---
Proof OSRS democracy has failed.
---
I intended this statement as a joke, but the more I think about it, it is fairly emblematic.
---
Yeah but just take away this guy a second. In general it doesn’t make sense that the pinnacle cape has non bis variants.
---
We already know how virg you are with one max cape
---
200 M req ofc.
---
Na, leave it. Give you a better appreciation of how much better builders adventurers are compared to your average Gielinor citizen.
---
yikes. Most people get their cape by 40 attempts, and wave 30 is astoundingly low for that many attempts.
---
The fact he is using acb doesnt even matter because the mager hasnt even spawned yet
---
Idk about stakes but people bring it to tob because its a 3 tick weapon and hits faster than whip, while pretty much keeping max hit and accuracy almost the same
---
it’s often used to ToB for pre-imbued heart before the first boss so that you are more likely to catch freezes

Pretty obvious yes.

so in theory could you sneak in an extra attack in a duel?

Nope.

I got the quest cape like three days ago and now there is an enormous void in my life. But at least I can play the game now.

The majority of players aren't involved in pking - it's far from a necessity in playing the game.

After 200 attempts I finally completed goblin deplomacy.  Thanks everyone for the support

80? I would be surprised if it was less than 99%

A year ago I was so impressed that KempQ might have found a work-around to the 180 recoiling dilemma. At the time I was like, "200 IQ! Stick it to that firecape guy!" and jumped on the bandwagon.

Now, he makes "RuneScape Played Properly" videos.

You break records and release unique content.

No

Maybe not every time but yeah, as the fight goes on the ham joint will be hitting more than the whip

Yeah, I know. Why did I expect people on the OSRS subreddit to know the only thing gold does

Its pronounced ardy

U smart son
---
why is everyone saying to make an ironman.
---
they usually switch to it and do 1 hit during a fight, ive not actually lost to anyone using it yet, but ive seen alot of people use it against me..
---
Would 1 hit change the ticks of a fight, over maybe 5-6 hits would they have one up on me?
---
And here I am failing on 3 attempts at 95 combat :(

I didn't notice in both instances, but there is a huge portion of players on here who genuinely think pray flicking should be taken out/ reworked

I often have some stupid ass ideas, but they're almost always pretty detailed and also self explanatory. Hopefully my *slightly* intoxicated ass could give some hope for prosperity in a new idea

I’ll post it in that for next time.

But then it would just be Runes-

Well done, dude, you are the best.
---
Any plans / possibilities of doing this at even lower level by replacing some restores with lower level weapons and starting earlier?
---
Took me like 12 attempts around the same combat. Ended up teaching me a lot and all other bosses have been extremely easy because of the experience. Just takes time, you get nerves, etc. Once you get it, everything will feel slower.
---
Oh so their phone is connected to Wi-Fi.  Account hacked!
---
OSRS really needs to diversify their requirements for items. As it stands right now, you can get barely a fraction the way through a skill and unlock all of the weapons in the game, only gated by money, which incentivises RWT. Jagex should consider making weapons thats are equivalent to extremely high tier gear like Blowpipe but with different requirements, so people have actual options to build their character.
---
For example, if you don't want to fork out a couple million for a blowpipe or a bil for a TBow and the sustained use of it, perhaps you could train to 90 range for a ranged weapon implementation that is incredibly eco-friendly, but gated by a high stat requirement and is equivalent to lower stat-requirement but higher gold-requirement items. Or, maybe, you have to work through an extremely difficult quest or minigame to get a sidegrade to an extremely expensive piece of gear. The game isn't nearly creative enough with weapon requirements and it shows.
---
((Also, please equalize DPS among weapons of practically identical requirements, e.g Rune weapons, and exaggerate armor weaknesses and strengths among monsters so you actually have to choose which weapons to use instead of hurr durr me do whip for slayer all time))
---

max cape ornament kit
---
I think a zenyte is probably the best investment at the moment but which one depends on what you're going to use it for.
---
Ring of Suffering is good if you're planning on grinding out a lot of Zulrah, as is Necklace of Anguish. Those two would be my top recommendations. Anguish is the more flexible of the two but if you feel like doing Zulrah until you make another 16m then I'd say go with the Suffering first.
---
You can also buy an Amulet of Torture but I'd only do this if you're focussing heavily on melee activities like slayer or training melee stats in NMZ.
---
Other things worth spending 20m on are 83 Construction and a good house if you don't already have those.
---
?
---
Yup all I have is 2m an hour at vorkath, I want to kill myself
---
budget: xerican robes, black dhide chaps switch, glory, dstone bolts, helm of neitiznot, rune gloves, climbing boots, rune cbow, staff of water, runes for tb/entangle/barrage-/blitz, dds for ko, avas and mage cape.
---
risk: ~150k
---
high risk: ahrim robes, ahrim staff(if using ancients otherwise just a regular elemental staff since the damage boost isnt worth it outside of ancients imo), black dhide chaps switch, dragon boots( optional since it's only 2 extra melee str and has negative for range and mage) glory, your choice of a +1(ags or dragon cbow are popular choices), bgloves, avas device/mage cape
---
risk: ~5 mil(if you don't get smited)

---
Oh shit, I didn't notice that, dangit Jouke1630, I thought you were Jouke1630
---
&gt; I've heard that a lot - that the items are gated by money and not requirements, therefore they should just remain T75. I'm not sure that balancing requirements for weapons around their arbitrary value on the Grand Exchange is good game design. I still feel that an items power level/DPS should dictate its requirements.
---
This doesn't even have to do with game design for me. Like I said at the start of my comment, I feel that if a player with lvl 75 attack can somehow afford a scythe he's more than earned the right to use the scythe. Sure, this only applies to a small percentage of players (certainly not me), but for this reason alone I'm not a fan of significantly increasing the level requirements of items when these items are already being gated by money anyways. 
---
&gt; I still feel that an items power level/DPS should dictate its requirements.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with this, I just think that the availability of an item is also worth taking into consideration. In the case of the scythe for example I don't think it's a bad thing for it to have a more accessible level requirement when it's got the secondary "requirement" of it costing 1b. 
---
Furthermore I don't think OSRS should have such rigid rules. I just prefer stuff like level requirements being loose guidelines, not structured rules. Part of OSRS' charm for me is that weapons aren't completely segregated by tiers and that often times lower level weapons are still useful. Dragon claws for example only require 60 attack, but they're the highest DPS spec weapon in the game (shared with the dragon dagger lol). Does that mean that it should have a higher attack requirement than the armadyl godsword?
---
&gt; The argument about introducing more weapons works like this. If a T80 weapon were to be polled today, it would have to be more powerful than the T75 weapons in its class. For melee, this means that a T80 weapon would be more powerful than a Scythe of Vitur. As you can imagine, there's no chance this ever passes a poll. However, bump the Scythe up to T80 and now a new T80 item now only has to match the Scythe in power or at least be comparable - which is something the community will be more open to.
---
If a tier 80 weapon were polled today they could just give it a level requirement of 75 attack, same as the current "tier" 80 weapon, the scythe. I mean I don't know about others, but I don't look at the level requirement of an item to determine if I'm OK with it or not. I look at its stats and the supposed role/niche it's going to fill. For that a level requirement doesn't mean anything to me. 
---
In the end I don't think level requirements is what's preventing jagex from releasing new items. It's the playerbase being relatively conservative in terms of what items they want to be meta and what they don't. It also comes from the playerbase wanting to keep as many items/as much content useful as possible. For this level requirements plays no actual role. It's the usefulness of an item (and its monetary value) that does.
---
kemp got caught rwting and abandoned the only interesting content on his channel to make let's plays
---
he's earned some teasing
---
helm of neiz looks great with bandos tho tf

Is there an item I can use at chaos altar that helps me suicide fast that I do not lose when I get pk’d? I tried the ds2 orb and ma2 cape locator and I ended up losing them. There is no other options?

I thought it was shaclone

Corp is very good money but only duo or trio. Solo is way to slow.

Cannon is best, as far as where I’m not totally sure what the best spot is i only use mine for slayer but trolls north of neitznot are pretty solid and make some money back

Plot twist, it's a guy.
---
I just started an iron man account like a month ago and basically all my do has come from quests. And honestly I’m loving questing getting all required items for some quests can be challenging so it forces me to actually play instead of just buying from ge. One thing I do hate is that I’m wont get Stam pots for a while.

You can protect most patches to give them 100% chance of surviving. Ultracompost gives over a 90% chance of surviving as well
---
That's what happens whe. You guys grow out long hair. Cut your damn hair you hippies!
---
Nope, very slim chance. However you might as well keep it in your bank and work towards the requirements.
---
It is sorta relaxing though. You can take your time. Save on prayer. Do your switch. Get ready for the next phase. But in the end it just a lot of time.
---
ok ty
---
Nope but due to the insane DPS that is the blowpipe and more affordable Saradomin brews, it's  significantly less challenging

Actually I took a picture of a Snapchat of a computer screen and THEN cropped it, get your facts straight before you come @ me BOI

---
Oh shit, I’ve been paying gold all this time. Thank you sir for this 200IQ move.
---
But the slayer helmet already matches it!
---
can i donate to you like wtf
---
Definitely zenytes. Anguish/torture first, whichever you feel you'd use more. After those, get either a Tormented if you think you'd use magic for things (Zulrah, Barrows) and then finally get a Suffering which is useful at Zulrah and a few other bosses
---
In what ways can an ultimate ironman get an untrimmed prayercape?
---
Aim for barrows gloves that is a really good start for any members character. Either that or plan to complete the achievement diaries easy- elite will take a while but setting a starting goal will be a great motivator.
---
Cool!
---
Quest bosses are challenging omegalul
---
You should get a fighter torso which is pretty much the same as a Bandos chestplate
---
no you have to buy members, you can buy it then change it from the website though if you're in one of those clans that track it by music unlocks or whatever

I still think that, besides pvp, this game is essentially single player, so it shouldnt be taken out. Like, this guy got a fire cape at level 18 and that effects literally no one but himself (unless he goes to pvp I suppose). So the benefit he gets from the ability to prayer flick affects only himself. I believe prayer flicking makes the game better since if you're willing to be more interactive (constant clicking) with the game then you can get your benefits out of it. That's my argument for why it is good it ended up in the game and should stay.
---
the only real hard part is healers at zuk imo, as that can be very stressful. And the fact that every run you waste a few hours and supplies.

that's literally no excuse. All other grinds in this game mostly take longer than the inferno grind, it's just that the inferno grind is more intensive yes, and if you fail, you'll get nothing out of it.

Based on last year's financial disclosures, rs3 accounts for most of jagex's profits due to micro transactions. So if you enjoy it play it. I doubt either are going anywhere soon.

I got torso in about 3 hours with casuals with people leaving and having to reset a lot.

With people you know that won't drop out it is probably more like 2 hours maybe more if your attacker has low stats or your healer/defender aren't good at their roles.
---
With a pro leech clan it is like an hour.

Idk about roles but I know BA services advertises like 6 hours so use the ratios to extrapolate is my best guess.

Account security should be tackled from both sides. Jagex should make it more difficult for hackers to gain access to accounts and players should be made more aware of how to better secure their accounts.
---
Good bot
---
Farming isn't even that bad? It's so passive and you can just do it a little at a time and make insane profits. And hunter is extremely fast compared to other skills.
---
Regardless, I usually watch something while I grind out dull skills. Anime, mostly. But obviously that's just preference.
---
Imagine thinking your fire cape is bis in 2019
---
TBF: Back before RS3 had the EOC, I thought the same about the Fight Kiln.
---
BUT I did manage to beat it!
---
Granted there weren't 3 jads at once... only 2, but still, I DID do it.
---
I remember I was a little kid when I did this quest, I never expected that screamer ghost to do a jump scare on my ass, I've never ran out the room as fast I did that day scared shitless that I was
---
So everyone knows it's a girl? Do you think people would upvote this if it was just a foam d scim?
---
Nvm can't find any (how do u get hacked by nonexistent sites LOL)
---
I hate super click intensive stuff because I try to study while I grind. Woodcutting/fishing are some of my favourites since they are so chill
---
Wow, interesting. I'll look into this
---
Do you have any keylogger viruses by chance? Only reason your character would move without you doing it is if you've been hacked.
---
Your first kill is usually 2-3 hours, most of the attempts will be shorter because you die before the end. 
---
After that subsequent kills get significantly faster, especially since you can do it as a slayer task. Minimum time is around 50 minutes I believe
---
It really do be like that tho
---
Yeah, you are, and this response is just as cunty
---
if ya'll dont behave jagex are just gonna remove capes entirely
---
As someone aiming to max by end of year, worth.
---
Mace is terrible. Why not use any other crush weapon... granite hammer, dragon hasta, or Zamorakian hasta/Bludgeon if you can afford it
---
Kempq is a weirdo, he also cries at other 07 youtubers who use titles that he's about to use on videos that he hasn't released yet lmfao.
---
Is there any reason why you have to turn the sound off in order to look at his feet?
---
lol just crash other people
---
Runelite tabs make gearing/regearing very fast.
---
I'm super lazy lol been like 3 weeks since my last herb run.
---
To be fair, nerfed protection prayers made the game more fair. If you stop and think about it, being 100% immune is kind of over powered... if you are fast enough at flicking (or are one of those using the cheating plugins) you can essentially have an infinite duration godwars trip
---

You're not locked, there's a bug on mobile that messes up switching worlds.
---
Your right, so I decided to go with the one without a spec, the obsidian TK ZERK TKZK mace, and go finish 100 ensouled heads for 70 prayer for piety. 
---
Nah bro, I like the mace, that spec is sweet af and that prayer bonus is godly.
---
Ok so first of all a whip is gonna be much better than a d mace even tho d mace is a crush weapon. The str bonus on the mace is just too low. Secondly, you wont really need prosy since the vast majority of your prayer loss will come from ghosts, so just wear your normal melee armor (barrows, obsidian, dragon, whatever u got). I'm sure you can get 1 kill if you do this. And it's not instanced, so just run back to get your stuff if you die.
---
Finally, the ghosts are pretty quick, like 1 second apart maybe. You can watch your prayer points to see when to change prayers.
---
2008, my cousin told me about it, showed me around in f2p, within a month I was a member, haven’t stopped membership since. I’m an addict and proud.
---
Phishing sites ask for bank PIN on login.. Actually adding a bank PIN to login will be one less red flag people would have that they're being phished.
---
So glad I got a screen capture of everything going on during the first day of release. Such a nostalgia blast I had that day and I was so glad we weren’t stuck with EOC anymore. 
---
Played with sounds on and the amount of axes chopping wood at Tutorial Island was probably worse than Wintertodt.
---
1/10000 chance of unlock or 100million nmz points
---
No worse then me as a kid. Somehow I got "Ara-ground" out of that and was convinced that was the right way to say it.
---
The spec is alright but your DPS will be so terrible. If you find it difficult then your number one change should be a better crush weapon.
---
That's barely over droprate
---
I agree with the other anguish comment. Also 80 prayer will make your ppots/restores a bit more effective but it won't be game changing. 
---
Remember that deaths are part of the learning process and to practice jad you can follow along with a youtube video on your character. Good luck friend!
---
Every stream was basically an Ironman stream and if you were ranging TzHaars early on you were a god.

mapping stuff to your scroll wheel is sketchy. remapping stuff to buttons on your mouse is not.

Unless you just want slayer xp while killing vork, trying to get a blue dragon task for vork is pointless. Just block them now and go finish vork in void and salve
---
Worth it to sell my zulrah gear for dhcb and move to vorkath in the current economy? As if recently i have seen the zulrah rewards drop in price. And am considering moving to vork. The wiki lists Zulrah at 1.8m and vork at 2.5 is the difference currently that big?
---
We pay they gay
---
You can 2H weapons?
---
youll have a better time just biting the bullet and using bonds to swap names. youll have to double name change the account with the name you want on it in order to free it up for the other account.
---
dude weed lmao
---
I got it to work somehow, I literally did that exactly and it still kept reverting back to my main as soon as the payment bit came up even when typing in my pures gmail acc/pass. Just bugged out or something I guess lol. Thanks sir for quick response.
---
the bcp is good for some gwd content and for stuff like solo raids where the tank stats matter.
---
yep. lots of people tele up there for a bunch of different reasons.
---
To be fair it’s been over a year
---
It is not in tob. :)
---
I was talking to a dude on here who just used it "because", and would get say he knew runelite was better.
---
I couldn't really get a legit reason out of him, he would just be really offended and defensive.
---
I use the one on their website
---
Why save crafting for last tho
---
I see you literally just exist. Easiest account of my life.
---
Incel is just a low iq buzzword people use as a scapegoat/boogeyman to pin problems and negative traits onto.
---
i mean he already beat the game so
---
Tbow should be 90, scythe 90, blowpipe 85, rapier 80
---
quantity* of people
---
Pontiac Sunfire with off-coloured door good.

Congratulations, you played yourself.

Edgeville. You’re right next door to bank. And it’s also f2p

🦀🦀🦀 ZEZIMA IS GONE 🦀🦀🦀
---
/s 
---
pls fix jagex
---
Yes, the game occurs on 0.6s long ticks, so any action you do will occur on the next 0.6s tick.
---
DON'T LOOK AT ME
---
Wow ur good
---
Why does it matter that people mistake you for a bot? As long as you don’t bot you’re fine.
---
Safe pvp areas? What are you talking about? The g.e. is pretty busy in pvp worlds depending on your combat lvl bracket.
---
After enough attempts it will become like any other fight. 
---
If you are struggling with the prayers at Jad, I would recommend going to Barrows and learn how to lazy flick your prayer on the brothers. It will be a decent amount of stress because messing up will hurt (Dharok/Karil particular) but you can always slap it on if you are in trouble. Even if you die, you will always be able to retrieve your stuff quickly. This will teach a few things. 
---
1. How to remain calm when having to time your clicks for prayer
---
2. How to watch your stats (HP and prayer potions) while managing prayer
---
3. How to RECOVER from missing a prayer. Trust me, if you miss a prayer at Jad the worst thing you can do is panic. It has already happened, you can't change it. If you die you die. But RNG can easily be on your side and you can sometimes tank the hit and kill Jad if you keep your cool.
---
Once you have lazy flicking brothers down, Jad simply incorporates swapping between two (way less clicks) depending on a long visual wind up. The practice with the equally difficult lazy flicking will make life much easier at Jad.
---
The last thing two things I would say is make sure you are using F-keys to swap between your prayer and inventory and to just be patient. If you need 10-15 seconds to not attack while you are just prayer switching while brewing up and drinking restores then take your time. One sip per attack, and with F keys this will be very easy.
---
&gt; I’ll agree it doesn’t look pretty
---
My heart pounds to give you that feeling, with the hopes to send you off with a farewell "Sit" letting you know I hope you are comfortable on your path to the afterlife
---
🦀🦀Zezima can’t even log in to his account🦀🦀
---
That's insulting to RS3, at least thats a functional game
---
I mean like castlwars etc. Back in the day used to practice bridding in clan wars portal, is there anything like that anymore?
---
Does it still work
---
[me](https://i.imgur.com/HGyVnUa.jpg)
---
Yes, clan wars portal.
---
The problem is it makes phishing sites look more legit as they request bank pin on login.  
---
Database leaks shouldn't be an issue as we have authenticator.
---
He must've mined and smithed tons of iron and coal to build that car, and if he crashes, he'll lose his HCIM status.
---
Cerb perfect drop table imo. Small drops cover supplies and big drops make money and long term profit/ hour. If zulrah didn’t have such good money from its non uniques, nobody would be doing it and BP would be ridiculously expensive. Shouldn’t be able to get 2m+ an hour guaranteed from a boss that also has 4 3m+ uniques.
---
Why do people call him bob isn't he tehnoobshow?
---
Lol
---
Oh hey its the sonic song
---
average time is +/- 2 min
---
NO! Fuck this shit so much. It's a big reason I quit RS3. It's just insane and pointless spam.
---
imagine just turning it off
---
lOl
---
But is it not taking irl money and converting it into rsgp? Ie real world trading
---
Drake meme
---
You'd be wasting your own time. These bots have mute detection and when they detect that they're muted, they log out and cycle to a new account in seconds. Not to mention the people that run these have literally tens of thousands of accounts and likely get new ones at a higher rate than they lose them. It's like trying to drink a lake dry.
---
Incorrect use if $11 meme
---
Tinder can be super easy really.. Just have money, big muscles, a nice car and you'll catch em all
---
Would probably have to load the ammo into the blessing which then degrades to dust when the arrow counter hits 0.
---
Jad and the mage frog have high defence, higher accuracy will fast the kills.
---
That's insane.
---
This was done by Rendi on YouTube
---
I think only for max all skills.  I don't want to hear everytime someone gets 99 cooking.
---
You’re a clown. Just know that.
---
Nah. Guthix Vans = Rendi. His Sythe threads been active forever. He does a lot of firecapes for the obby mauler CCs.
---
Dragon slayer 2 all day long my friend.
---
Look up alchmate.. it’s really not that hard to find items to alch, you just gotta be patient with buying stuff. Don’t expect an instant buy. Good luck 👍
---
hm maybe just not buyables and combats? i can see it getting annoying but id like to see slayer, mining, rc ect
---
You don’t have to play every day to inform yourself on the future of the game.
---
Sure? But bonds are only redeemable for memebership or gold that already exists. RWT gold mostly comes from bots that compete with real players. Do you really not see the difference?
---
Ten years from now you'll look back at the current Era of your life and probably think the same thing.
---
apart from the game ticks, most of the "delay" you feel is just the ping. I have never in my life played on a world with less than 170ping and the "delay" is part of my life. Having that instant feedback from the game is something you'd see in WoW for example, or pretty much any other game to be honest hahaha. It happens because it's a web browser game, you can't download the entire game and make it run on your pc; it's constantly loading maps in real-time while your cache gets refreshed often
---
bannable in RuneScape*; could be legal in the other game
---
That's me :)
---
A way I actually haven't messed up yet, wow. Let's see: forgetting a type of anti dragon shield on dragon task ☑ Forgetting prayer pots on task that need prayer ☑ Forgetting seed dipper or spade when farming ☑☑ Bringing range weapon to monster not weak to range ☑ Bringing whip to dragon task☑ so yeah found pleanty of ways to mess up!
---
In rs3 people are getting 99s so much easier though, due to all the MTX, in OS youd definitely see less 99’s come through, even in the buyables
---
I think he stopped selling inferno's but still actively sells fire capes to the obby mauler committee.
---
Aw are you ok?
---
My account has been banned for macroing(which is an unappealable offence) the account had been hacked and I had no access to since the 2nd of may. What’s the best approach to trying to get my account back and unbanned?
---
I got this on my junk mail today, too, but from a different address. My heart sank to the bottom of my stomach for a minute. I'm glad I wasn't stupid enough to click on the link but it was close.
---
If it makes you feel any better I’ve only ever done tree runs for farming I’m lvl 90 now all the way to 80 I thought you had to add compost so I would bring 5 trees 5 compost same applies to fruit trees so my inv would just be stacked of saps and composts lol
---
i maxed 2 years ago i just do and wear whatever the fuck i want
---
Just get into a routine, if you have runelite the bank tag plugin helps a lot with setting up the necessary items you need, so all you need to do is get out all your relevant items every time you log in.
---
This is a weird thing to dislike kempq for but I absolutely can't stand his wrap up portions where he explains his progress.
---
new to the game btw
---
Xeric talisman to xerics honor is also great and free.
---
Rapier comes from ToB, not CoX.
---
A blessing quiver!
---
It's not absolutely needed... But yeah, it'll be a lot easier to find teams and such for higher level content
---
People use 3rd party apps and even banks contract out to 3rd party companies to power the apps that handle your money lololol. Runelite is note the reason you were hacked.
---
Yeah I assume they don't want people showing up in iron and monk robes lol
---
For real tho
---
Ehh that would be a buff to tbow and that is not something we need right now
---
Youtube, just gotta keep at it trying. I think zulrah is a good boss to learn because it will help you with both bossimg and pking since you have to switch gear and prayers. Its a good moneymaker and fun imo once you get the hang of it.
---
I can do it from desktop without warning, yes. So the setting probably transfers over to mobile. I thought the bag icon in settings was something about inserting to bank because that's what I got from the icon.
---
The answer is always slayer.
---
  
---
BUT also diaries and Quest Cape
---
And doubles the compost you put into it. Put 500 buckets, get 1000 charges.
---
A constant reminder of how fucked up the game became.
---
i watched the 3 videos for 'low the better' i don't get the chestbrah thing
---
Had 4.5k points saved up prior the update, those ran out around 3000 kc. I've blocked 6 most weighted tasks on Konar's table except for Hydras and skip most tasks. Also use Bracelet of Slaughter which usually adds another 50 kills to a task. I still maintain around 500-700 points doing this..
---
Phishing is literally just an internet-based process of identify theft, lol.
---
If you're caught phishing, you'd be charged with identity theft.
---
Nice idea, but there are two things i would like to change.
---
Make simple 99s area-specific, i.e. not the entire world gets a message but only the players in the 9 chunks around you. Also these messages chould be filterable.
---
he would be getting slayer exp that makes it worth not having a black mask for 2k+ kills kek
---
ARGANOOG homie cx
---
You dont masters from barrows. You did an elite.
---
Correct English spelling.
---
Country jig, i remember the name because its so shit
---
Its only a game. Why you have to be mad?
---
Arganoog
---
Lmao there is absolutely not a "huge portion", either you can't read obvious sarcasm or you're grossly exaggerating
---
Thats actually a good idea. Thanks for sharing :)
---
You are literally stretching the cows nipple. How is that not sexual?
---
Pretty sure it was not the gpu pluggin that caused the ban but your bot.
---
The only time Bert gets my business is when I have the clue scroll step inside the anvil in yanille.
---
This is a bug, as minimum yield with ultra is 6.
---
Too wholesome.  No fuck?
---
What you dont get you mean?
---
Why have you posted this here though?
---
Completing the inferno with no hot keys, and shit internet would definitely waste hundreds of hours on attempts not a lot of people want to spend 300 hours on a cape that’s +4 strength bonus
---
People make mistakes. This would be an extra security option to allow for less mistakes to be fatal for your account. And on top of that, it would be entirely optional, I dont see why this wouldnt be a good thing.
---
Also speaking from experience, I've made some mistakes in the past and this right here would have prevented me from losing my bank.
---
I think you mean Zulrah????
---
I did to P2P... feels the same. P2P doesnt mean the bots arnt impacting the game. I started playing RS in like 2002. Bots might matter for the survival of the game that being said let me pay to have my 2006 rs account stats back on osrs
---
Sorry, I didn't see that
---
Be an ironman.  Has no effect on you.
---
The bond can be redeemed for 14 days membership OR one name change, to change your name you need to select the “early name change” button, not the membership package
---
F in the chat for your loss my friend :(
---
Thank you
---
What?? Link that...
---
You said "You have to be Henry Cavill-tier to even get like 20+ legit matches". I have about 200 matches over about 5 months of not using it much, and have met several. I don't get why you are so determined this isn't true. Maybe.. maybe it's you..
---
The part that confuses me is how she only got 40 fletching. Did she get bored of botting after like 30 minutes?
---
This is the first I see about it. Didnt check reddit for a while -&gt; the original post is no longer "hot" as it is old enough. And this post is newer and still in the hot page, or whatever the default is on mobile.
---
I spend a lot of time on my pc anyway, doing homework or watching netflix or something.  So afk training stuff is easy for me.  And the progress makes me proud.
---
You'd have to be dumb to buy/steal the RSN Zezima... It'd be taken from you as soon as you log in again lol.
---
This is fucking hilarious what are you talking about
---
i reckon there would be a few more uses for dynamite aswell ;)
---
&gt; Both to prevent botters and jagex manipulating polls
---
It does neither, they can easily add them over the duration of the poll.
---
I'm pretty sure it was still RS2 when Fist of Guthix was released. But agree 2007-2012 was fun and would of been peak runescape without all the mistakes
---
Thats not the glitch. He means the no xp kill glitch
---
I’ll pay you 100$ to fuck off.
---
Clean your hole(s)?
---
Depends what you want to do in-game bro, I would start off with aiming for base 60’s or just the stats for Quest cape, do whatever you find fun man
---
He has a big partyhat collection apparently
---
I started in 2002 it was especially ironman back then.... I'm very frugal....I didn't spend my gold only grinded... only bought items back in the day.... Tried iron man, still gotten bored because "ironman" is how I played back in the day tbh.
---
I would kill for this
---
wait that’s me
---
OOTL, what happened?
---
The 'iron'y in his name
---
I think I saw this one the last time I trained runecrafting...
---
I was with you until you said quest cape lol. There aren't any really challenging quests outside of maybe ds2.
---
Honestly in my head I pronounce it as “Arduin”
---
I mean if you just make sure that you're giving item rewards worth 1k, that doesn't add gold to the game unless people sell their loot to the npc stores
---
I'd argue it's more about the act of doing it and having proof that you did it than what you could get off the account.
---
If an established hacking group showed proof they hacked Zezima, it'd attract a lot of attention - which the idiot hackers on twitter live for.
---
Combat level shouldn't be (and isn't imo) an indicator for what stage in the game you're at. Someone playing his account might not be able to get a fire cape at 100 cmb, whilst someone who's been playing for 15 years can get it at 40 cmb.
---
Imo the experience from playing the game contributes much more to what stage you're in the game.
---
Yeah that’s true, but I’m not sure how many people would be interested in having to input a login pin and a bank pin.
---
🦀 *Noisestorm intensifys* 🦀
---
He doesn't seem like that kinda guy :)
---
LOL
---
Instantly made this my desktop background
---
Reporter nr.83621
---
Something like jouked17
---
It's called a public key
---
That would be fine too. But then it wouldn’t also unlock your bank.
---
Cause everyone is doing iron man series they're so over saturated that main content is more exciting
---
I did get lost! LOL... I quit playing its like you guys cant read??? and RS and MWRM are not comparable AT all... I was 10th in MW.... and played MWRS that is not comparable at all LOL. The time it took in RS back in 2005 is hours more than anything in COD lol.....
---
Your post history is a fucking wild ride and I’m enjoying every second of it
---
Check assignment weights. Best for points are dust devils, nechryael, trolls, kalphites, suqah, etc. basically anything with low def or low magic def in multi combat areas for bursting/cannoning. I think duradel/Nieve is best for this. Block/skip things like demons and metal dragons.
---
It’s useful in the max cape when you’re doing Kree’Arra
---
Hot and cold only has a few locations, you can tell which location it is fairly quickly once you've done a few
---
Im jealous of that figure
---
It’s not redundant, it doubles as your bank PIN so it unlocks that as well. All this suggestion does is move the bank pin from bank to login and would be optional where you would like to be asked for your PIN.
---
Bwana
---
wtf scripted content
---
Isn't there a camel speak any? What does he say then
---
What would the difference between this on every log in and having ot enter it on every log in when accessing the bank?
---
split lol
---
in 2005
---
I agree with you with the bp, but nerfing now sounds like cheating against those who didn't had the chance to use it before. 
---
The tbow is way too much expensive so I think it's fair especially when you have monsters like zuk.
---
I'm all against those late nerfs, remember zulrah drop table? Or birdhouses? Sounds like this game is all about abusing content before nerfing.
---
Thanks for your opinion. I completely agree with you. But since this hasn’t been fixed in years, I feel there may be some improvements they could make which could be easier and quicker to implement. This is also optional, so it wouldn’t affect you in any way if you hate it.
---
I will always down vote people who say "take my updoot" or something similar. Just upvote. You don't need tk let everybody know you upvoted.
---
EnGiNe WoRk
---
And Bob the Cat’s annoying noise.. I hate how persistent Random Events are.
---
oh
---
Thank you for answers! Im still learning raids and i feel that it would be good since i hate running simulator To raids always :D
---
&gt; Login limits are based on accounts, rather than ip's.
---
&gt; Too many login attempts from your address
---
4month update mate, still no assembler and well over 2k total with t bow drops from raids
---
Does farming level affect your disease rate?
---
What wrong with quests :(
---
Loool
---
LOL imagine thinking getting a fire cape at any combat is an accomplishment of any sort....
---
“The wildness later should be a safe zone to balance the broken game! And there should be a bank there.... for ‘balancing’.”
---
Did he drop anything or just lose his status
---
Rune armour (if you haven't completed dragon Slayer then wear a chainbody instead of the platebody) ( you should do d Slayer if you haven't) and rune scimitar, and do horror from the deep to get a good book as your off hand.
---
I feel like the reward is a more respectable account. No offense or anything but the whole point of maxing is to be closer to finishing your account. What's the point of maxing if you aren't going to try to finish everything? Quests and diaries barely take any time at all compared to a single 99. It just feels lazy to me.
---
Even more xp as it's about 2.5 times extra xp with the gloves equipped.
---
Thank you it means alot
---
Nothing beats the exhilarating content of purchasing gp with irl money
---
Yeah the problem is everyone uses their primary email and re-uses passwords
---
Crash him (in game).
---
Ive pretty much done all the main xp quest for slayer attack def strength and range buf basically i should just wear my max armor tier i can wear
---
At some point you talk about flinching and mention that you wait for the enemies hp bar to disappear.
---
You can flinch faster than this.
---
There is a feature in rune lite that gives you a windows notification noise when you are out of combat, and your mouse is out of focus with the client. So when I flinch I click on my desktop after attacking and moving back, and on notification is when you can attack again.
---
No. Its trollstigen in Norway.
---
Gz on the blood runes!
---
There is no cow inside nmz, but there is one at the “lobby” of nmz
---
With membership you get a free name change every few weeks
---
I mean, this game literally exists because the fandom bitched so hard.  This game was bitched into existence.  On top of that, OSRS has about 3-4 times the playerbase of RS3 at any given moment, which means that everyone's bitching led to a better game.  
---
If ever there was a community that could feel justified in its bitching, it's this one.
---
&gt; made entirely possible by the "infinite invincibility exploit" known as prayer flicking.
---
I did not imply it required less skill or less effort. I said it was made possible by a broken mechanic.
---
It's a real damn shame poll results are hidden, bunch of crybabies on here. Polling works a lot better with results shown at the time of voting.
---
Thank you!
---
Depends on your HP, the higher your HP lv the more damage you do, it’s not worth using dharrok until you get 91+hp
---
Are you honestly complaining that you didn't get an incredibly expensive drop on your very first  beginner clue..? ^(Gameisunfair)
---
The game will freeze and just catch back up and stack multiple hits/ticks into one game ticj and i almost die because of it
---
Beginner clue, I see nothing wrong
---
Idk about an item but I use the chaos dude north of the altar to suicide
---
It could obviously function the same as the bank pin does, being able to set it so there's a 5 min grace period where between log outs
---
Both capes are pathetic to wear anyways, so yeah...
---
I'm getting tired of seeing this shit
---
it's still perfectly fine to use it if you want. Unless you have access to an abyssal dagger (or better) for strength training then whip on controlled is fine.
---
I am yet to do DS2. 
---
on the wiki it says players will always receive Vorkaths head on 50th kill. Does that mean for your 50 kills ever if you didn't get it before 50 you would get it on the 50th?
---
What if you got 3 heads before 50, you would still guarantee a head on the 50th?
---
Does it also mean for every 50 afterwards (100, 150, etc) you will get the head drop?
---
I personally couldn't care about completing those, which is why I'm not. I've never been completionist in any game, so I don't care for getting all pets and drops which should also follow with your reasoning. Different strokes for different folks.

Not actually a bug. Your chat box said something along the lines of “you found a clue and discarded the empty nest.” It’s unfortunate you lose the nest but this is just how clue nests work.

Go to the quest tab, in the upper right corner you'll see a red mark. That takes you to the minigames. You'll find chats for people looking for partners.

Yay let's vandalize the information we all rely on to get shit done in game, and simultaneously create unnecessary work for the wiki admins. I get that this edit isn't really that big of a deal and is a funny phrase, but normalizing wiki edits is just not a good thing imo

It's kinda important for many things. Don't have game music on, just sound effects. It lets you know when you take damage for example, which can be very important if you're safespotting something and going afk, only takes a few hits for you to die. 
---
Very good for wintertodt too. How else do you know you've been interrupted from burning logs? Actually going to look at the screen? Nah, sounds tell you this stuff

Yeah BH pking might seem hard but deep Wildy NH pking is much harder of a learning curve. But a good account to practice both of these on is a baby pure like a 60-75 combat gmauler, you’ll risk like 150k max.

Join a clan that teaches tob --&gt; Learn tob with them --&gt; Now you always have people to tob with

Joining a clan isn't really a commitment of any kind. A lot of people use it as a raid finder for consistent teams.

This is comical gold. Keep going OP lol
---
&gt; But maybe just god affiliation, as I could see people taking just one of these into PVP for the +1.
---
&gt; 
---
why would they? You need ammo anyways to pk. Nobody pk's melee only..
---
I rewatched it twice, I’m so thankful it was a content creator lol. That shit was insane.

Hold the fuck up. How am I supposed to be my f2p gentle green giant with fake 99 herblore cosplay without that cape
---
you get +1 to attack strength and defence while on controlled. the +3 bonus to attack from the accurate combat style is negligible.
---
The total xp rate you get on controlled for the whip is actually quite decent. The only reason you wouldn't use it is to train strength specifically, either because you want to train strength or to get a buffer over the other skills to make them more efficient.
---
If OP doesn't have access to a good strength training weapon then training all of the combat stats on controlled is perfectly fine.
---
yes

Why because it’s the truth and no one wants to fix these issues. They make these things because the ones getting payed to protect(not all of them) but some have “very high ties” with jagex so they can squeeze by doing these things and not give a fuck about the solo kid running in there. Your an asshole too man

It's an endless loop

I believe thats a perk from Ardy Elite diary

Squat, bench, deadlift.

Also bludgeon/abyssal dagger/dragon scim are great weapons to train strength with!

Even easier is watching the bottoms of his front feet. If they're pointing forward when they come up ranged. If they're facing the ground its mage.
---
Oh damn, you're right!
---
That's one of my favourite series he's done, personally. I don't care about ironman or HCIM, his special account builds are cool. But I care more about a main, since that's the type of account I'd make. It's just a different target audience.
---
It doesn't really matter, DPS on Jad is largely irrelevant once the healers are tagged. If he's struggling to keep prayer switches going, adding a weapon swap to the mix might be a bad idea.
---
Broken mechanics can be fun, it's not entirely broken by the true balance of the game (long term grinds, AFK-ability, bossing (even old content like Barrows) already balanced around it)
---
On paper pray flicking is busted, in practice it's actually really cool

No problem

---
It has nothing to do with the time it takes. 300, 400, and longer grinds are often condensed down into 2 minute montages. 
---
It 100% comes down to editing style.
---
Refer to my previous comment
---
Not what I meant. If you are going from 70 attk str and def to base 80. The fastest way to do so is get str to 80. So that when you go for 80 attack. You are benefiting from your increased str and increased xp/hr. Than you get attack to 80. Then when you are getting 80 defence you are benefiting from your increased str and attack. Vastly increasing your def xp/hr. Doing so on controlled is much slower because you aren’t utilizing our increased stats to gain higher xp/hr
---

Why fletch?

but i dont undestand how blowpipe is supposed to be faster since i dont have any of the armor reduction items also the blowpipe doesnt got enchanted bolts and ill also need to tank the ranged attacks

In this case they do. His account is getting locked out to prevent it getting bruteforced (which I’m not even sure how helpful that is). Something that was designed to protect the average player is locking him out of playing on his own account. A normal player wouldn’t have to worry about that.
---
Did the drop table get a buff? I did around 600 after the release and I don’t remember it being 200k/kill. Took a break after that so I’m out of touch.
---
I'd say it's harder because all the efficient methods were already known on release so Lynx had to compete with a shitton of other players without a headstart. It's pure dedication that got him 200M all.
---
Change your password. Its very likely that you have been phished. Teleporting to castle wars via minigame teleport is the way to go gor phished accounts.
---
Um. This can be done in like a day?
---
Again this is entirely anecdotal. Show don't tell. Make an excel spreadsheet that shows all your hits vs a friend with higher range bonus (with a representative sample size) and then MAYBE ill believe you. Alternatively you could actually ask a mod if this is the case. I'll give you a certain amount of benefit of the doubt, but I am 99% sure you are misinformed.

well, I think it's less about the platform, more about the community.   
---
 the OSRS content creator community is really tight-knit, to the point that you have people like Settled, who gets like 500k+ views on every vid working with small time creators like 9Rain who maxes at maybe 10k...and even smaller people as well, so for two of them to not get along I'm certain would cause at least some friction in that community.
---
Can't find the comment maybe he deleted it.

I hate this boss, I've had 2 hilts and 2 crossbows in 3500 kills. Went over 2k dry on a hilt at one point.

Edge piers (normally zerkers) wear their torso all the time when msb ags Pking.  Torso does not have a negative range bonus so it doesn’t affect the hits.

We’re making fun of you because its like you’ve never played the game before. Do you not understand what accounts use these weapons and what the weapons do? Because you could make them all “tier 90” and it wouldnt change a single thing.

I'm with you brother
---
Yeah mostly weird combos for youtube or just to try something new. I've seen amenity use one with dragon darts on his baby pure before at wests, for example.
---
I've noticed the exact same thing. Do you have any other clues in your bank? I'm thinking it might only give the next tier if you have a beginner clue already.
---
78 herb lite is essential for xeric’s aids (brews).  And 90 is extremely helpful for overload +.  240m will get you an okay start on gear you need to solo, but you’re better off finding some people to teach you until you get better gear and 90 herblore.
---
Can I ask honestly, was the mace pretty accurate for you as well? I'm only 85 attack and used piety and super combat potions and it was pretty damn accurate, probably nothing like the DWH, but that shits pricey.

That's all? Jesus.

I think it should be a separate pin from your bank pin that is 5 digits. Keep it locked up

Yeah I’d agree, the current one looks like a dragon head thrown on a stick. But at the same time I’m not a fan of this submission either. I don’t think either of them look like a functional pickaxe.

I miss SC so much.
---
Green Dhide body(provides more melee defense than the blue red and black contrary to popular belief) dragon plate legs (g) (increases chance st receiving valuable drops) barrows gloves, boots of lightness( to increase your speed so you can gather buffs and make rotations faster) tentacles whip( you heal off of the poison it causes so less food you need to bring) dharoks helm (increases your mad hit based of How low your prayer points and hp are) soend time getting s fletching cape because it gives you 1k free iron darts for your range tasks. Unholy blessing (take 10% less damage from npcs) amulet of accuracy(basically piety but as a necklace).
---
Probably wouldn't be doable with amethyst or dragon arrows so it wouldn't be bis for tbow
---
I just read this high and can not fathom how people come up with this shit. Such a cool idea and covered every base.
---
I have no idea haha. I ended p ags stacking him so I doubt he continued to try and acb spec people.
---
I really like this for a lot of reasons. The paramount being that in most play sessions, I will access my bank at least once anyway. This just gets it out of the way. Also a really nice way to make it so even your inventory or equipped items are safe in the case of a stolen account. Its like having 3FA
---

🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀 it's a bad game plagued with microtransactions and it needs to die eventually, but the death of RS3 may have far-reaching implications for jagex as a whole which will undoubtedly impact OSRS 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀 
---
 🦀 guacamole nigga penis 🦀
---
The concern from Jagex has to be you can make unlimited accounts to make beginner clue bots. With how easy F2P accounts are too make it seems reasonable to make beginner clue scrolls slightly less farm-able then easy.
---
Part of the intent here is to provide "content" for all F2P players to participate in without ruining their economy and still allowing for them to "win the lottery".
---
You need a mage offhand, so mages book, malediction ward, or book of darkness. And maybe you forgot it in the pic but bring Ava’s assembler. I would probably buy better mage boots since they’re both pretty cheap, like infinity or eternals. Then I’d say anguish, imbued heart, suffering, tormented bracelet in that order
---
Looks more like a dragon battleaxe ornament kit.
---
Every account from back in the day is on rs3 since it’s the same game. Osrs came out in 2013 so everybody had to start from scratch

Torags plate+legs is 570k, Dragon chain+legs is 873k. You will actually save 393k by upgrading to armor with much better defense. Torags has the second best def bonuses behind justiciar.
---
Keep in mind Torags does need to be repaired after 16hours of combat use, but it only costs about 170k total to repair the plate and legs if their fully broken. And that 303k you saved from upgrading from dragon to Torags can repair the armor almost 2 full times.
---
Definitely upgrade

---
&gt; Keep your health above 0 whilst working Vork’s health to 0
---
Eventually. 
---
The toxic naysayers will always say no and tell you to shutup, but that's what they say about everything until it eventually happens.
---
When Jagex realizes the game is becoming stagnant and the playerbase gradually starts diminishing, they're going to update the game and this would include ORSHD. 
---
It's inevitable. I would say give it 1-2 years max. They clearly have the capacity for it, but think about it - as an organization; smooth operations = no need for additional work. Jagex deploys a strategy to retain existing players through a customer lifecycle approach. Until the existing playerbase as a WHOLE complains/leaves the game, nothing will get done.
---
Actually curious.   
---
Besides safespotting monsters that can onehit you if you mess up and wilderness in general, is there any way to die just because you looked away for few seconds?

Hit the monster with your weapon!

His RSN was “E” so I guess that makes sense.
---
This is highly dependent on the value of the item, your distance from it, and your money making methods. If you can get 3k for 5 seconds of running while you're doing demons (a task that won't fill your inventory), that's basically a 2m/hr rate at the cost of a tiny xp decrease

I'm pretty sure changing password doesn't boot you out, the only way you'd be booted out was if your account was locked.

I don't follow.
---
As things are, where all the top tier gear is T75, the thought of a T80 seems too OP.  There'd have to be A LOT of power creep to add a T80.
---
If you suddenly shifted the Twisted Bow up to T98 (I realize that's not what OP suggested, but I'm using the Hexhunter Bow from RS2 as a comparison for illustrative purposes --  The two bows had similar effects, and the Hex was T98, so the comparison works) you've effectively set a cap on weapon creep.  It would be like drawing a line in the sand, saying that no weapon will ever be more powerful than the Twisted Bow.
---
Re-tiering weapons PREVENTS creep, it doesn't create MORE creep.
---

I don't think this is possible. PIN is not an account-wide thing, it's game-specific. Login screen uses account credentials, the same credentials are used whether you log onto rs3 or osrs (and previously, rsc.) PIN can be different between rs3 and osrs.
---
At most they would have to have a lobby system where you will actually be logged into the game's lobby before it starts asking for game-specific pin.

i honestly have know idea

Posts like this aren't helpful for your own sake but yes it's nice to have a few stupid offers on the back-burner.
---
Just don't try to buy 3rd age for 1 gp lol. At least put in a reasonable offer like 10 to 30% of the actual value. When trying to snipe high end low volume items on the cheap.
---
I downloaded the mobile app when it came out and I've used it about 5 times in total. I don't really enjoy mobile all that much but I guess that's because I mainly deep wildy pk which is impossible on mobile. If you're doing some skilling/farm runs I can see why you would use mobile more often. But ya reduce your mobile use and I think that would be a positive change.

When I’m at Vorkath I use toxic blowpipe because I can’t afford acb or above with bolts. Because of this I pray mage because the mage attacks destroy me. Is there anything I should swap up to get better kills per trip?
---
I don’t think imbued hearts and visages are real objects. I think they’re some kinda imaginary object that has become an in game joke. Like the Rs version of a snipe hunt.
---
Hey never say never.
---
No. Hellhounds are fine. Either pray or use Guthans or just do Cerberus
---
Yeah I've only had this happen to me once but I just assumed I forgot to compost.
---
How does this work, I press 1 button and it gears up my character for me ?
---
That’s why you have 91 slayer so you can kill Cerb instead of killing hellhounds. Besides, they drop hard clues which could lead to good money (friendly reminder to do your clues).
---
What kind of gear do I wear up?  Do I just go for max bonus and then hide while the cannon does its thing or should I get max prayer and just pray tank?
---
This has already been adressed, and seeing as the Max Fire Cape is just a Fire Cape, there is zero benefit in removing those from the game.
---
can you receive the woodcutting pet from burning logs with the infernal axe?

Private-servery. He has on a 3rd age platebody, 3rd age platelegs, 3rd age cloak, Ranger boots and a Fury. He also didn‘t exist in 07 iirc
---
The exact odds depend on the trees you cut but on average you should expect it around 20-27m xp
---
It’s too iconic to change for me
---
Don't think that's necessary. Cerb's def is fairly low, so I think claws is better in the long term
---
6-8 kills per trip is about the average. Are you flicking his triple attack?
---
So you don't think having them drop cheap herbs, seeds, food, and coins is a good idea?
---
People tend to argue against buffing hellhounds, not sure why. Anyways you're welcome to kill Cerberus for some drops.
---
Hellhounds do drop clue scrolls and smouldering stones, so there's that.
---
Rip we lost the trademark
---
This is like arguing that a new construction xp method that gets 70k exp/hour but is free is pointless, because oak planks give you twice that. Especially considering like I explained I'm training this more like splashing than like Stringing Jewelry - occasionally logging on throughout the day on mobile to reset my inventory and get another 2k exp - the fact that I'm getting nonexistent efficiency with String Jewelry matters way less than the fact that every time I do an invent of SJ it costs 9.5k gp.

There is a few Android JEOS (Just Enough Operating System) that you could try bootloading to the phone just look for something lightweight but yeah most android phones u can pick ur OS if u know what ur doing
---
Yeah... This quote makes me sad on a sort of existential level.
---
You need 91 slayer to do Cerberus. I'm only at 60, if Cerberus was an option I wouldn't be on here asking for improvements to Hellhounds now would I?
---
The issue is that arrows work with tbow so unless they're limited to low tier arrows they'll be unneeded powercreep. Damage can't really be increased because of dark bow specs (already maxes a 98) so the bandos one won't work. Healing effects would be balanceable. Prayer restore is not acceptable, it's the only remaining limited resource in the game and would really devalue the inferno. Disabling prayers just seems very frustrating on the receiving end, similar to how d-spear really has no counter. Entagle effect could be balanced pretty well I think.
---
I didn't say I had 91 slayer.

I think there was a case where they turned a fresh account into an ironman because someone missed it. Try tweeting the mods.

I have never heard of that phone (I don't believe they are available in my country) but generally you can root your phone to re-install a new kernel and os custom made for your phone model.

I did that for my previous two phones (nexus 4 and nexus 5x), and the change in performance and battery life is gigantic. You will probably need to research for a few hours, but it would be worth it in the end.

1.) Guess you better grind out 91 because that’s an improvement for hellhounds. 
---
2.) Do the hard clues they drop. 
---
3.) Use Konar for a chance at a key.

Yes. They have low defenses so you can easily kill them even with low budget setups. You can use arclight if you want to, definitely not a must though, can easily do it with just a whip or tent whip.

Didn't use to until recently when Mod Wolf from out of nowhere decided to awkwardly force that joke into a bunch of old quests for cheap reddit approval.

He even did it with Cook's assistant, probably the game's most iconic and oldschool quest out of all.  All of a sudden and just like that.

Zezima was never skilled, he was just ahead of his time.
---
You wouldn't need to receive a reply if all you wanted to was throttle his IP. Thats exactly how it'd be. Zezima's router would receive a bunch of replies saying "wrong credentials" for requests he didn't send, effectively making Jagex's servers ignore all requests from that ip, good or bad.
---
It's not the case, though, as he can log on his alt. Apparently he's really being throttled by his account, so no ip spoofing shenanigans are necessary

It has to be a barbarian skill. Otherwise it makes the player look like a monster.

The community is generally very helpful and willing to give advice, and on top of that the wiki is extremely thorough and will always have helpful info.

I didn't know that, but anyways why? What is the point of having to grind out the points and then mine more ash afterwards?
---
About 30k+ kills luckier than me lol
---
Their customer support is the worst on the planet. If they are anything but ashamed of their customer support it’s laughable
---
I just stay out of the area where you take damage until 70% since it hits you less often the lower its energy is. I can still get 500 points easily doing this.
---
Can I have your luck
---
A public key is given to multiple (trusted) people for access to a single resource, and the private key is meant to be kept secret. No matter what configuration of key exchange you use, public keys are the farthest thing from a solution to zezima's problem, or even any security matter where you only intend for one account to be accessible by one person (the account owner).
---
You aren’t forced to do Volcano mine

I really wish I had a friend like this, I have a couple that play, but I wish I knew someone playing for the first time to help them out with tips and to play early lvl content with them. There is not much actual difficult content in the game, but it becomes much more serious. I just wanna fuck around and laugh playing some Barb Assault. :( I wanna go back!

It depends on your dps, but very very often he'll use his second triple attack on the second attack after his first awoo. It's on a 40 second cooldown, so you can set a stopwatch if you rather keep track that way.
---
Also, if you have two awoo's on the kill, then 10 ticks after the second awoo he will most likely grr. If you move on that exact tick you can avoid all damage from the lava.
---
Sometimes if you're doing a lot of damage and he's down to more than half health before he does the first awoo, he will usually do grr as soon as the awoo is done, immediately followed by the triple attack. That's about the different kinds of kills I've had experience with.
---
Well, that and the ones where it doesn't awoo at all, but then you don't need to do anything.

Volcanic ash *was* a lot more expensive before Jagex re implemented it to scale with your mining level - Before it used to be at 200-300 **each** . 
---
If you're complaining that a mere inventory spot + ~150gp for 2 volcanic ash is a hassle - Then why did you get the tome in the first place? There's a wiki that tells you that you still need the ash requirement after.

No death is the easy way out. He gets to live every day in agony.

One measure I've not seen taken anywhere to advance account security is to entirely seperate usernames from the log in process. Instead your log in name becomes essentially a second password, which makes it impossible for any specific account to be targeted (make it an additional layer in account recovery as well, and specify that like your password, it should never be shared or reused). I imagine this normally isn't implemented because it's an inconvenience to nearly all players.
---
&gt;Currently, as it stands the ash covered tomb is completely useless. 
---
Ok.
---
&gt;For anybody unaware it “upgrades” the fertile soil spell so that it applies ultracompost instead of supercompost. 
---
Bit of a contradiction.
---
To clarify, in case you are missing the glaringly obvious use, it removes the need to have to gather mats to make super compost, removes the time it takes to make compost, and makes lunar farm runs way better.
---
How...Charitable of you. 
---
That aside, what's wrong with this (paying for an ingame title) sort of thing if it goes to a good cause? Bands do it with guitars, signatures, drum covers and to a lesser extent meet and greets.

holy shit
---
Consider this, the fertile soil spell eliminated the need for you to collect supercompost ingredients, I think the upgraded version also eliminate the ash requirement for ultracompost. It just seems counter intuitive to me that an upgrade still requires ingredients. I think if the spell works the way I suggest more people would play volcanic mine to try and get it. I'll agree with you about the xp tho, I got from 78 to 79 mining unlocking it.

Castle was Tele then run south west. Its common for (hc)im to train there at level 3 until wintertodt

RIP your rng.

whats the ring?
---
You can look at it that way or you can look at it as saving you the time to make the compost which is either incredibly slow both filling the bin and taking it out or pretty high apm. The spell needs something to differentiate it from the normal version anyway. Imo the current version is just about perfect
---
The onyx bolt REEEE*

Actually the worst fucking sound in the game, it’s a good thing no one uses them

I'm pretty sure pmod names are locked to that account, and even if they changed it, only them can change back to it, other people wouldn't be able to take the name ever, even if it expired and wasn't the "previously known as" name anymore.

During one task before when I filled my cannon it said 0 then as it shot it went down to -30. The counter thing isn’t very reliable lol. It definitely didn’t only load 20, as it had nothing to do with the game, only the client overlay

Can just stand at least 1 square from a wall or any square you can't stand on and you get the original tele animation - there's not enough room for everything without clipping happening.

If at any point you can scruff up some wealth from your bank, I'd use bastion potions instead of regular range pots (assuming you're using the Sara brew for def). That way you get range and def in one pot

I've seen people mention on here that you'll get 99 melees on the way to 99 slayer, is that actually accurate? It doesn't seem to be the case for me. My week slayer gains at the moment is around 1.4m, but my attack gains are only 650k, and my slayer level has surpassed my attack level. I'm almost 99 strength, but that's all from afking nmz while at work. Are the people who say you'll get 99 melees just doing slayer the slow way? The only tasks I really melee are cannon tasks, and my week gains for defense are around 900k from bursting on defensive, but my defense level has also been overtaken by my slayer level. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Unpopular opinion: The crab meme is funny during its moments, but is being overused in stupid ways that are killing the meme. Like stomping it into the ground.

If you can't get DHCB, blowpipe is the next best setup I believe, I used it before I had DHCB and did Vork with addy darts in the BP. Elite void would be ideal but you can get away with regular if you don't mind using a little more prayer. Pegasians (could also used blessed dhide boots if you really wanted, they aren't much worse than pegs, browse for which one is the cheapest and go from there), archers ring (i), and a blessing in the ammo slot for the slight prayer bonus. And salve ei ammy since it stacks with your void against Vork.

SIKE! YOU THOUGHT!
---
I actually really like this. My only note would be that it would require Jagex to create too many items if each different blessing's god-attribution had to be reflected in each ammo type. That's 6 new ammo variants for each type (Bronze-Rune + Amethyst? And that's just arrows, what about bolts? Javelins?). 
---
I'd vote yes on this if they were able to make the blessed arrows behave like granite dust did with cannonballs. Use any blessing on a stack of arrows to create blessed ammo.
---
For arrows and bolts I'd also say that a blessing should only convert 250 of the stack. There's a lot of blessings in the game and they're almost worthless - plus 250 arrows/bolts lasts a long time with Ava's Assembler. If we want to make a blessing sink, let's REALLY make a blessing sink.

The obby method relies on using low level monsters in a normal rumble. You just fill up on absorbs and sip a supercombat every 15-20min. You rely on the low level bosses not hitting very high. At 90+ melee stats you should be able to last the full 6 hour log with 6 supercombats and the rest absorbs. This is purely for xp, the points are shit with this method

There is closure to his story. After you talk to him in the Stronghold and he imbues your sceptre, you can head back up to the surface and talk to Litara (his sister) and follow some dialogue options to inform her of what became of her brother (after which point you can't 'break the news' to her again). It's nothing exciting but Jagex did think to add it in.

[My deep condolences.](https://youtu.be/8AQ_1wua68A?t=2)
---
Yes, exactly like that.
---
Being able to use a joke in the right context is what makes it funny, you are just beating a dead horse.
---
Just did this for the first time as well
---
Exactly what i'm doing... down to 87 now lol...
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀 /u/inhatewetrust is powerless against crabs 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
numbers were micro rev vs. recurring rev
---
Bonds are included in micro rev
---
Try using window capture instead of game capture
---
&gt; Accuracy rolls for each opponent individually against their magic defence, unlike chinchompas.

Is this a joke l u l
---
There's also the argument that, even though the main barrier to entry is the cost, it would still make it harder for someone to give a t-bow to their alt or lend it to a friend.
---
thats not too many rune items
---
It’s, in the game already
---
The fact that it's clear is probably more to do with his monitors resolution
---
Looked like a spider to me and then I realised its mod ash (isn’t it 👀?)
---
Is this some sort of weird role play?
---
I can't believe the things people do on mobile.
---
I was pumped for it to come out. I wasn't included in any of the early releases and was super envious of the people who were. I was ready to primarily use mobile.
---
Day 1 I did 2 herb runs and was like "no thanks, not for me" lol. I hardly ever use the mobile app, unless I'm doing something like ardy knights or setting up NMZ so I can swap over to a remote access app.
---
Ye boy. Pool and jewelry case is all you need
---
I don't get it
---
It’s my turn to post this. I got reservations last week.
---
Is this why some weeks i have to reauth 50 times like back to back to back even when i havent changed device?
---
With a 1/3000 chance of it being successful, you might use knife on mole pet and get this message
---
"You accidentally shredded the mole"
---
Has rigour and can't do vorkath. Fuark, what did you do?
---
Guess it's time to repost this one again
---
Guess you’re no longer broke tbh
---
[Too late](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/blimtx/yo_where_tf_is_my_uber_taking_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) my post now
---
Yeah, it would be so much easier to buy a gf in that world
---
Varrock Elites could be problematic because of the Herblore requirement if you dont have considerable cash to blow.  (like 30-50m) Iirc theres a decent rubecrafting requirement too.  And a fairly hefty smithing requirement.  Not sure what all your stats are like but if theyre fairly low it might not be very realistic to do the elites in two weeks.  Although i suppose of youre pulling near 40 hr sessions anything is possible
---
I went through due process and waited my turn in line
---
How long would it take?
---
I just made an Osrs account after 15 years since yknow all that progress went to RS3. I'm kinda rediscovering it all again although a bit more efficiently, im just trying to follow the optimal questing guide lmao!
---
And the ranged minigame will give you rupees on failed attempts
---
How long would it take? Thinking about farming chaos druids.
---
Spoilers! I haven't paid membership yet!
---
Permanently?
---
THOSE FIRE STARTERS ARE GONNA BE SO LIT THO. I have 300k each in my bank
---
When your phone dies it makes me do auth again
---
Obby cape is objectively better but if you want an inferior cape, gratz I guess
---
On the recovery attempts... If you're no longer in the geographical area where the account was created/played most, it becomes nigh impossible. If you have indeed moved, I'd recommend looking into visiting home, sending it in via Teamviewer on a computer which is there, or using a very private VPN.
---
A guy in my cc got a claw drop on his 2nd raid with 20k total points a couple days ago as well. I definitely thought this post was by him until I saw the date in game, gz.
---
And gg your new account
---
This sub is cool most of the time and probably has the best memes out of any gaming sub, but we are disproportionately hivemind-y compared to other subs, imo.
---
To tack on this, doing quests without guides also helps
---
if only someone who has knowledge of the reference were to, you know, link the video we too could know if it was actually fucking funny as fuck
---
Thanks! I'd believe that and will work with those figures.
---
I've got a torso or two in my time but would ideally be looking to create a group of individuals that all want to achieve the same thing and would be willing to set a time and grind it out (like on the weekend or two sessions of a few hours each). Might just hit up some rounds with randoms at some point to get my head back in the game.
---
u the real nigga
---
Geez, hostile much?
---
Thanks!
---
You need level 50 fishing to atleast wear bronze and use a fishing net though.
---
glad you're still going altho i dont pay attention to much of anything.
---
Dudes already alting.

Come squish this tiny noob with your biceps.
---
cant wait for all the kbd pets named king black dick
---
Gets up, does spin, sits back down.  Called it
---
You’ve missed well over a year of something’s then lmao
---
Totally planted there!!! This had to have passed through dozens of devs hands only to be overlooked every time. Definitely feels planted to me.
---
I'd like to see a GoT inspired quest where you could inherit a throne.  Maybe a reward could be having villagers collect items for you in exchange by putting money in the kingdoms coffers.
---
God speed.
---
I tried; stilll dont work
---
Is this because OSRS has worse security, or because there is more to gain from hacking an OSRS account than other popular games?
---
Like if you hack a league of legends or fortnite account, there's nothing you can do besides fuck with their mmr. WoW is probably the only "popular" game where hacking someone actually matters, and I haven't played it long enough to know how common it is.
---
shareX's puush, 1600x900 resolution
---
Update your app, I believe they fixed this a couple weeks ago
---
Abyssal bludgeon or dagger if cost is an issue.
---
Duo is just as easy as trio once you learn how special attack cycles work. There's 0 reason to do 4:0 in duos.
---
I’d say carrier pigeon should suffice as well
---
(-_-)7
---
But that's 2 secs of xp waste
---
*gigglesnort*
---
Having it be one over is even better.
---
If you're not moving your cursor at all, unless you're guessing, then you had to have looked at every other button for all 4 numbers, which is basically the longest time you could spend doing pin.
---
The screeching of the armadyl crossbow is the best noise this game has to offer as far as special attacks go
---
Never once said it didn't require skill you brainlet. And I have yet to have someone give me an example of a super skill intensive part in the inferno. The majority of the inferno is learning mechanics and learning the layouts of waves, which it turn becomes muscle memory (an example would be Zulrah). If you would actually read anything I have said you would have realized the point I am making...
---
STILL a problem :(
---
What cb are you? Your stats seem a bit low, overall most pkers get 85 mage for tb and then often 94 magic for barrage as well.
---
Stats depend on what combat bracket ofcourse you want, some people like baby pures some like maxed, some like somewhere in the middle in the 70-80cb
---
You're obviously not very bright, there is very little value in arguing with you.
---
You said my thoughts on BP vs Scythe were subjective, no it is not. BP is indisputably broken, no matter what you compare it to. Perhaps I should have worded it even more simply for you, I apologize. 
---
&gt;Your argument was that balance was suggestive.
---
Maybe I needed to say your argument based on my opinion on BP balance was suggestive. Sorry you already forgot we were specifically talking about the BP, I did not realize your memory is extremely short term...
---
Bro same. I’m so lost.
---
Fucking F
---
I wish I was a bot, would make me feel a bit better...
---
HAHAHAHHAHA THE RUNECRAFT SKILL HAS BAD XP RATES
---
.snoitalutargnoC .nur cireX fo srebmahC dnoces rof dab toN
---
I have, and it was fixed to an extent. It went from logging me out and every time I hopped worlds then making me put in authenticator to making me put in authenticator every 1-2 days. It’s better, it’s not fixed though.
---
GoT is one of the worst shows I've seen. Tried 3 times and couldn't get pass 25 minutes of the first episode. It was just awful.
---
I use blessed dhide, anguish, assember, i use gaurdian boots, archers ring i. Never attempted skipping but i knew it was possible. 
---
I might try rune darts my next task. Do you think crystal haberd during the last phase would be better then just using whip. (Dont have money for d claws)
---
Cool! I'd be down to join and help you guys out and teach all the tricks whenever you guys  are up to it :)
---
With a follow up quest where you broker peace between the warring kingdoms and your rule slightly grows?
---
Found the guy that can't kill jad
