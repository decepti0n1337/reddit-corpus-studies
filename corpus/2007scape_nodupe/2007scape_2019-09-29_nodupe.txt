Not sure, ive been doing solo ToB for over a month now, 25KC in decided to test my skill. This is the hardest thing ive done in any video games ever and probably ever.

You should use Steve if you specifically want demonic gorillas on task. Steve has the highest chance of assigning them
---
What did he say, the little cunt deleted it
---
Look, just make the damn client optimized enough for me to not use another client that actually runs well.
---
[removed]
---
jagex needs to hire you!! Don’t let negative clowns put you down this is a fantastic idea and instead of complaining you actually acted proactively! Well done !!!
---
Can't wait for Jmod smackdown.
---
NGL, with how badly Jamflex fucks up I actually thought this might be a real at first.
---
When I did 99 prayer I used Karils top, Dinh’s bulwark and enchanted symbol for suiciding. As well as tele with burning ammy. That’s what I found was fastest xp/hr with smallest risk
---
Oh… I’m confused then I guess. How’s that related to the lumbridge tasks?
---

---
Edit: oh shoot. Let’s you not use the ring without a staff
---
Neat ty for putting in the effort to share this. Makes me want to try it.
---
same
---
My rng is 3.6. Not good, but not terrible.
---
lumby elite lets you use fairy rings without a dramen staff
---
I used addy arrows
---
because elite lummy lets you use fairy rings without lunar staff
---
1) he could be wearing metal ankle bracelets, not necessarily chained shackles. And standing on the edge is probably so that he can be standing but also provide details of the feet. 
---
2) you're right about the back wall. It should either be darkened all the way down or if kept light, the details of the bricks should be lightened so that it looks like fog creeping up the wall
---
Nice meme and fuck you :)
---
Yeap! I think I can slow down the mouse movements or make it more random too for future videos. But I'm not sure if there is data out there to allow us to simulate human mouse movements, it'd be pretty interesting though, maybe we'd have to feed it our own data too. 
---
As for this video, I just wanted to click on cows as fast as possible. So I guess I didn't put too much thought into getting bill banned lol
---
I was able to get 15 skills to level 99 before I got bored of RS3. All I was doing was bossing for money so I could buy supplies for skills that I hate.
---
Pureseb has already hit the 48-48 in pvp.
---
good advice. yes ill always be playing both accounts at once
---
What is the 50 con for? I'll probably throw some cash from the main to  get 70 prayer and 82/83 con eventually but not immediately
---
and what is the best way to get 70+ ranged?
---
Rs3: flies forward and normal 
---
Osrs: literally flies ass first for peak performance.
---
Yeah fuck me for playing the game the way the developers intended and not looking for every shortcut I can amirite?
---
This game is sooo sad but just like you im in it too. God help us all. Amen.
---
No, his girlfriend is an iPad.
---
Is that pose a reference to Magician from the House of the Dead games? If so then that's pretty bangin
---
&gt;nechs and dusties 
---
is clearly 2 examples
---
you can also barrage abby demons, and no one really bothers but bloodvelds too.
---
brutal black dragons are camped off task
---
In case of failure, apply memes.
---
regardless, my main concern is the overcentralization of dozens of monster types in one area. The same thing that was wrgong with Nieve’s cave. Whatever has to be done to keep the balance/sacrifice that you’re talking about can be implemented as such.
---
It literally says permanent ban ? 😂
---
saw swamp man good knew this whole thing was bs
---

---
The original minigame this came from *was* a PvP minigame.
---
We pay we gay
---
Yeah. Agility-tele-alching at Seers has a nice rhythm to it. Is relatively click intensive,  but because of the rhythm, it is pretty smooth if you are listening to something (Like a podcast)
---
Omg
---
B&gt; Glory , gets sold a fucking dragonstone ammy because you’re 10 and naive.
---
lance is slightly less kills/hour (from what I've read like 1-2 less at max stats), but it doesn't have an operating host like dhcb does and I find it way easier to woox walk during the acid phase with lance.
---
 the cbow does have the advantage of bolt specs going off and hitting those nice 100s, but it's hard to factor it in consistently.
---
It's just big talk. If they ban 3rd party clients *most* of the people who say they'll quit won't; they'll just use the default client and bitch all day.
---
Back to the Drama Calendar we go
---
Ok
---
I understand but it seems the most effected would be Brutal Black campers. I don't think anyone actually kills any of the other Brutals and Iron and Steel are not really done unless on task which is still rarely done. Unless Jagex were to release multiple of these "dragon den" type areas for various monsters. But then that may make Catacombs pretty much dead content in the process.
---
Thought so.
---
&gt; Vannaka, has an 8 for basilisk compared to Chaeldar's 7.
---
Though your conclusion is correct, your reasoning is flawed.  
---
Chaeldar has like 20 tasks with higher than 7 weight, which means basilisks are *really* uncommon overall.  
---
Even if the weight for her was increased to like 15, it would probably still be less common than Vannaka.
---
What's your twitch?
---
Buy a new crystal shield, or use the bow till it breaks then recharge with ilfeen into a shield
---
I think a better response would've been 'He' but sure
---
If you want to laugh it took me over 20 hours to get the full set
---
Oh I’m dumb. Thanks for the update
---
[deleted]
---
do it in pvp worlds.
---
&gt; What would be the best bolts for borrows if I use a rune crossbow?
---
Don't use a rune crossbow, use a magic shortbow (i) with rune or amethyst arrows.
---
Well the accuracy only helps to prevent 0’s, not the damage itself
---
&gt;or if it's just the MTX getting shoved down your throat the second you log in.
---
Ironman mode gets the best of both worlds. No mtx (no in-game items/xp) (you can still use the cosmetic store if you want) + you get to see how beautiful the game is on ultra in NXT, and the quests are pretty nice
---
&gt; Str used to give max hits at 97 str making 99 basically same as 97 as 99
---
This isn't correct in any case. Your max hit will change every single level based on your gear setup and potions.
---
Dolla Dolla Dolla, Dolla Dolla bills.
---
It's obviously a JoJo reference.
---
Who shit in your Cheerios
---
I was going to cover Woodcutting and Firemaking in a separate post. Their issues are different than theme/boring thanks to the AFK nature of WC and Wintertodt for FM.
---
zhasta might be better because it has a +5 higher str bonus compared to cudgel (+70 vs +75), but it has -5 accuracy (70 vs 65)
---
Client
---
&gt;unhealthy dose of nostalgia
---
That Sphinx got an unhealthy dose of chromosomes
---
Ooo yeah thayd be rough, whats the best gather or no requirement skills like mining. Theiving, hunter, etc for 99
---
Like literally everything. You are getting more information than an average person could ever keep track of. You are making everything easier, less click intensive, more accurate. This increases xp/he for the average person. 
---
The developers of said game clearly disagree with you, or they would be options you don't have to go to a third party for
---
This would be the first part of a large overhaul doing exactly that, yes. I know people don’t go and kill metal dragons for fun, the point is to remove them from a dungeon they dont belong in the first place. Not to mention absolutely nobody would be effected because my new location is the same distance from BBD’s current closest bank. The only thing that would change is everything isnt in one dungeon, which it shouldnt be in the first place.
---
And there is no way in hell the catacombs would be dead content if most of the monsters were removed, the fact that Skotizo and the Arclight exists reinforces that, let alone all the higher level unique variations of other slayer monsters that would stay.
---
I did. Played before G.E was added was there when they removed pvp and added trade limits. Middle school friends use to sit in members worlds to get our loot percentage up and trade 75ks to get corrupted weapons.
---
Yikes
---
Beautiful as usual zuhaar
---
Because using standard 2007 gear you lost like full rune or some shit when you died, and the most dangerous boss was Kalphite Queen where you'd 4 item veracs in a duo or trio so your friends could just grab your items if you died. With the way PvM is now, deaths at high level bosses could literally be several hundred mill and bosses now actually have mechanics other than DPS that can kill you, making death way more likely.
---
Comparing using the default Runescape client to literally having to live in the jungle. 
---
Yikes.
---
herbs (ranarr, snapdragon, torstol), yanillian hops, and even some fruit trees in higher levels produce good stuff. those are the profitable things and can be planted from pretty low levels.
---
before planting a single thing, do fairytale pt 1, rfd (goblins subquest), forgettable tale, and garden of tranquility. get your magic secateurs and your free xp that will take you to the mid 30s.
---
use ultracompost always. i make mine and sell the remainder which is an easy 180k/day but most players don't do that because it's not xp efficient. i farm for money though so i don't mind that
---
I loved the concept of dungeoneering. It was a nice mix of skilling, pvm, and puzzle solving, and you made some friends along the way. I’ve heard people say raids is the new dungeoneering, but it’s not accessible to mid level players at all. It has such a steep learning curve that it discourages most people from trying it. I crave a more casual and social experience.
---
Nah the xp is shite from seaweed, I did it for pet rolls and gp offset of my tree saplings

Are you learning with twisted bow? Or Arma cbow? 
---
I am hesitant to try it because I can't afford a tbow and I'd barely be able to do like Acb, Arma with ahrims lol
---
Varrock diary includes barb village so why not

That’s literally what it says
---
I got tbow and ely
---
75k a day for max, but you want to always have over 750k in it, 75k times 7 is 525k, that’s what it’ll use up a week, so if you’re going to check once a week you’d want at least 1275k starting, to leave you with 750k still at the end of the week.
---
*there are a lot of closet buddhists in china
---
I doubt it would affect much. The weapons only have 250 uses before degrading to dust; they are meant just as PvP Spec weapons. Even if the weapons passed and the question to make them used outside of PvP passed, I can't think of many places they'd be used... Perhaps Zuriel's Staff in the Inferno but the limited charges may counteract any buffs it offers and you're probably better off saving the invy spot from a Kodai. Statius Warhammer could be used instead of a DWH since it is the same spec I believe with better base stats, but the 250 hits part would limit only for very specific things for rich PvMers.
---
I was pretty happy with everything untill i read about the bans of thirdparty clients, the torvesta thing made it obvious that it was just a joke :D
---
or he's a vikings fan
---
Why even comment then and be an asshole? How's your home life? Are you okay? Or do you have nothing better to do then put others down on the internet. Cool story bro. I hope you have a good life ahead of ya. ✌️
---
My mistake, I meant medieval RPG armor.
---
That was a well done bait.
---
Incredible, what a mad lad
---
I read to “30 SEPTEMBER 2019” and quit
---
Yah... It is a bit crazy how that has crept up. Not exactly a bad thing, but still it is concerning to think if we did eventually get a prayer like Turmoil, even a nerfed Turmoil, we might be in a worse spot than RS2 was Pre-EoC. That is also why I am a bit worried about the Korasi that is being polled being significantly stronger than the original; just seems like poor foresight into what some of these items may be like in 5 or 10 years.
---
Dragon knives are like 0.12 more dps over max melee (off task), really only worth it if you're hunting a basilisk head and want it done asap.
---
Not sure about your ideas, but I appreciate the effort! People like you are how we got stuff like MLM and Rooftop Agility, which are VASTLY superior to their alternatives. Thanks for working on making OSRS a more fun game :)
---
I think even with a team itd be pretty dopey.
---
It's so adorable! And thanks for the luck! Maybe if duradel would assign me it, I could try more haha.
---
Nobelium uranium.
---
You're almost original.
---
Same but with void
---
Underrated post In general imo
---
For like 6 minutes or something yeah
---
Vorkath will probably be in my near future. Just need a blowpipe + bgs. Might raid later on when I can atleast afford lance.
---
DAMN IT SKINNY, HAVE YOU NOT LEARNED YOUR LESSON?!?!?
---
I seriously don’t know what Jagex thinks is so hard about implementing this basic ass feature in the vanilla client
---
Its not that bad, I genuinely like the story line for mory series
---
I’ve expressed that pking someone is fine even if they only have a spade but telling some to sit fgt or sit kid is cancerous and I’ll always vote no on that principle alone.
---
IIRC you don't need 45 herblore cuz you don't need to actually complete Legends, just start it enough to get into Khazari Jungle.
---
This picture reminds me of the once popular Sepia filter on phones and social media. 
---
Gz though!
---
I recently blocked them cause inwas sick of gorillas
---
So you’re saying RuneLite is a pyramid scheme? Cuz that’s what the triangle was for😂
---
I legit bought a second monitor for osrs so I can have a few accounts going while doing other shit. This game dude.
---
Yeah you're right, I didn't stop to think about that for too long. Would take the best part of a year doing just 6 yews a day.
---
Whys the demon look like its looking for the leather club that's 2 blocks down
---
Yes!
---
Yes you can still use Runelite, but stay tuned for an official news post soon
---
OSBuddy introduced some features that made the game SUPER easy. One-click Blackjacking (you can just spam left-click and it will Knock-Out or Pickpocket, whichever you should be doing), left-click OfferBonesAtAltar (just spam click the altar), and left-click Construction (as opposed to right-click --&gt; Build/Remove).
---
With these updates the community and Jagex went WHOA okay maybe we need to look at 3rd party clients again.
---
I like the upper one for the graphics and details but there's uncanny valley involved.
---
Hey man I got 2fa and a pin + 2fa on email. Come at me and my 20m.
---
Its a trip to me too, coming back to the game from before bonds were a thing its been about six months now of semi casual grinding and i got paid today and $20 for 15m sounded worth it so i said fuck it lol
---
I have it on my email, I haven’t given anyone else my password
---
Maybe if you read the text you wouldnt be so confused. The numbers given assume 20 kills per hour, it does not account for 100% combat time. The scales and runes used are accurate for 20 kills in an hour. If you do more, you use more, if you do less, you use less. Its not rocket science, bankig time and the time zulrah isnt attackable are accounted for. So you're wrong.
---
I've done tests by checking how much value was leavig my supply tab over long grinds, and it absolutely is accurate.
---
I don't even know what turmoil is but I stopped playing like 2006
---
I guess they could... Though I wouldn't see them as being that far off just killing cows and they aren't at the easiest spot for banking. But they could drop cowhide and count for cow slayer tasks I suppose.
---
Oh yeah overall its an ok diary, just wish theyd change the boots to be better
---
C G
---
Best of luck to you:)
---
Good points. Can you confirm the 250 uses? I remember when they were originally introduced they seemed viable even as an expensive way for training? Or maybe I was just a kid back then and didn't understand them. :D
---
Then it means one of four things 
---
1.) You have a RAT on your computer
---
2.)someone who has access to your computer stole it
---
3.)you clicked on a link and gave them your info
---
4.)youre a lying piece of shit
---
Which one is it?
---
I'm maxed combat but never pked.  Is there a welfare gear set up I can use to just learn switches and all that good stuff?
---
Dang, only 65k scales though, no wonder why they're always so expensive
---
unless you're adwaam
---
I actually see that joke a lot less than the angler gloves one. Could just be coincidence I haven't seen it as much though
---
Your an Ironman. You chose the iron life. You play alone.  OP do not contact this cheater.
---
Sorry but what you're asking for isn't 2007scape or even old school, it's handholdy and catering to shallow audiences who just want graphics or to be told what is the easiest way rather than those who look for themselves
---
Lol wtf... I am 88 slayer now and through 6 tasks (over 1000 kills) I don't have any whips.
---
please post this or message me that
---
one bad move and im done sir
---
Yeah its not that deep. I've taken a couple years off total over the last 15 years. Also you could 100% retrieve items in rs2. Even the update logs say that.
---
Compelling argument, but what else can "He" offer?
---
My nuts to your fist style
---
I agree with the veterans that have this feel, but also stfu. Boo hoo a change in the game happened. There's a new max hit.
---
# FEET
---
well, it was a response once upon a time last month or two
---
Accuracy doesn't really matter that much. You roll whether you'll hit or not, and then you roll between either 0 or 1, I forget, and your max hit. So your odds of hitting 24 and 48 are the same, 13 and 25, 2 and 44, etc. Regardless of attack bonus/accuracy once you've rolled that you'll hit.
---
well again I was drunk so I just needed something to space out the words...rolled with the 9s in part bc the NEINNEINNEIN meme and also bc 9 is one half (so me) of a 69
---
but thank you kind stranger :)
---
I use the TV or my phone, both are samsung so I can easily connect and play around if I want. laptop is basically just running osrs and some google searches
---
&gt;fury's
---
Did you fucking go to school
---
Like the other guy said. It’s what makes OSRS old school. Maybe they would enjoy rs3 more. It hand holds quite a bit more at the beginning.
---
Quest cape
---
poh
---
Pretty sure scythe flicking is bis, and cudgel is just a downgrade to hasta. Can't imagine hasta beats rapier just because of 25 crush defence.
---
No. That's max now vs max of the past.
---
Stop typing you obviously do not know what you are talking about.
---
\*sips Monster Zero Ultra\* heh, I remember when the GE was introduced. I had just bought my first Gmaul in Varrock West bank for 100k, and had been killing hill giants with it. Even for a member, it was an honest living... back before you kiddos got the Vorkaths and the Zulrahs. Those days you could spend the whole day choppin' yews and go to bed knowin' in a couple more days, you could finally buy the gear to do that Monkey Madness quest all them cool kids were talkin' about.
---
Ok I don’t mind if some skills get reworked but don’t fucking touch Mining and Runecrafting. Runecrafting is already ok with afk Zeah and Mining been getting constant updates like mlm and what not. 
---
Also fun fact, you can spend over 200m for 99 Runecrafting. Hire runners and get over 200k xp per hour doing lavas.
---
It was funny at first, but since its in almost every video it lost its charm for me pretty quick
---
This actually made me laugh out loud
---
Good?
---
Use runelite or do the math lol
---
Where'd u get the rates from? Wiki has Youngllef from normal gauntlet at ~1/1k
---
Aight buddy. It pretty apparent you're the one who doesn't know what they're talking about. The meta has changed drastically. And even if it hadn't it slayer for almost all players isn't 3x faster. Don't get so defensive when someone proves you wrong...
---
After December 2007 the playercount dropped from like 250k to 80k?
---
Wow really? Learned something new today, thought that spell was complete shit. Also, you're talking about volcanic ash or something yeah?
---
Yeah I'm waiting for those numbers to be released because it seems like it's higher but idk maybe I just don't have good rng. That's not usually the case but whatever.
---
hey man this sucks but at least you didn’t get scammed for like ur friends gold and had to pay them back out of ur own pocket
---
I honestly got burnt out for a bit and a new skill would of brought me back.
---
Do everything everyone else said, auth/pin/change pass to everything. 
---
Download malwarebytes (It's free/what I've used) run a full scan, it'll search your entire computer and list issues/viruses and gets rid of them.
---
But like, my lowest skill is hunter and I dont wanna farm/construct/hunt.
---
It's unfortunate that that is what YouTube basically requires
---
its like 90% untradeables lol
---
Even stuff like the sotetseg solver is nothing compared to WoW addons. Deadlybossmods alone would blow tiny rs minds. And yet  mythic raids are still very hard, because coordinating 10-20+ people is hard. This whole plugin drama is a very runescape specific thing.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
that's stupid you should have to authenticate to change login
---
Isn't mechanic of all wildy bosses is get them into a safespot and hit em'?
---
or by the typos
---
Your supposed to reply to the automated message for flairs
---
I’ll admit I came at you a little combative—part of why I erased the wall of text; I get a bit defensive about agility because it’s my favorite skill (it just happens to be what I can stare at the screen doing the longest haha) for that I do apologize.
---
I don’t necessarily disagree with what you’ve suggested by any means, I just disagree with your reasoning behind it needing to be implemented! I do think a courier type system would be an interesting way to take a break from standard agility training, and there is already a basis for it and how it could work a la gnome restaurant—maybe that could actually be revamped to be implemented into the courier system as well, as a way to train cooking and agility together?
---
So you cant handle banter and are okay with toxic pvmers talking shit to lower levels? How odd.
---
Id give all osrs bosses but raids for Nex lol.
---
Didn't need the arena, just  to "special attack" on a NPC as it's dying. Then you'd get the "3 spec" gmaul.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ah man, pked one of the first whips in game doing that. Dude was 18 levels higher, in some splitbark/mystic hybrid ish and a whip. Talked him into fighitng me lmao. 3 spec'd him, saw whip on ground, shit pants. They were still like 50m+ at that point. Damn the old maul/whip specs were fun.
---
If he was training runecrafting he'd prob try to get shot
---
Also curious of location.
---
came to say this
---
It’s not really that easy to just have a toggle. You essentially double your work for all future development. Coding and designing becomes much more expensive/time consuming when you add an entirely different option like that.
---
Not being a nock against Jagex but there are graphical problems with equipment for female characters (swords not sitting in the hands, or book just floating in the off-hand) equipment and environment, you have to double your QA testing which is usually the most time consuming part of development in my experience.
---
Vinsmoke Judge?
---
I don't like your r reasoning but I like the guild idea.
---
Getting excited over killing “12 year olds” even even odder....
---
Depends. With Ven, I think it is quicker to kill without the safespot due to cannon and Veng. For others, the safespot probably doesn't slow kills by much if at all. But yah, the existence of those safespots is a design flaw in itself.
---
I got prime on 70kc and supreme on 135 kc.  Gl man...
---
Who are you making fun of? Like do you think everyone who references something that exists is your caricature of a neckbeard?
---
Go outside lmao
---
when she wants bdsm but you just want yo dick sucked
---
oh jesus christ you need some rng

That's just false. Wc level doesnt do anything except give slightly more xp per root.

Did you get mvp?

But really, congrats dude!
---
I was casually standing at the GE when this girl all of a sudden said she was selling nudes for GP. Ofcourse I thought it's another scammer and since I'm bored let me waste her/his time. It turns out she was legit. Look I'm not trying to judge her or justify her actions but she does this because of RWT. Just so you know if there is demand there is supply. This is the sad reality and result of it....
---
If someone who doesn't know you or any of your personal information was able to recover your account, surely you, the alleged creator of the account, should be able to do the same. Unless you're lying :)

But eveyone esle was doing it as well? Honestly torvesta is god pker.

This is the kind of account I see In  game that I don't imagine is playing for free, elaborate if you can?

Isn't there an extremely obvious solution to rc? I seem to recall RS3 had a universally beloved minigame...
---
Fucking got him good
---
What's that?
---
Hey, had something similar happen. Keep trying to recover the account, tweet at Jmods to lock the account and investigate it and keep your head up. Don't pay attention to the "Xd lololol smackdown!!" people.
---
I would suggest you keep trying to send password change attempts to the original email/log in. I continually tried that and one went through and I got my account back.
---
Nice try, big client shill!
---
reread the title
---
I think it just depends on the phone. On mine i have like 400ms delay to click anything and the screen calibration is horrible. The chatboxes at the top are so small it takes like 15 tries to switch between them. Even with a stylus i cant hit em.
---
Its a normie so I'm not as familiar with play time and lvls but 2000 hours on an ACC with almost 500m xp which appears to be largely from bossing seems unlikely 
---
2000hours is only around 80 days played
---
Someone tried that with my Armadyl helm, it wasn't even the most expensive item I was wearing
---
Right.. I'm aware of that. But ranged pking is also just mainly a void fest still anyway. Or cheap budget gear to begin with. We were discussing melee power creep.
---
Different accounts lmao. He maxed an ultimate before starting swampletics
---
To be fair, the guy below him got rangers in 6 clues.
---
It's not OPs account.  He's saying that this champ buying bonds for $ to flex a DFH allows OP to have free membership.
---
My heart
---
&gt;after your first 100 kills  
---
Same could be said for zulrah (and they removed this, why?), raids, tob etc. 
---
And inferno will be braindead after 20kc. Just look at infernal cape sellers. 
---
The issue isn't whether it's easy or not. The issue is the plugin removing any effort required to kill them in the first place. Even if you master demonic gorillas, you still have to pay attention and count, but the plugin negates that totally.  
---
It's literally ezscape, but i don't see anyone complaining and in fact, people like you are endorsing it while hypocritically bashing on osb plugins
---
No. Return it to the old way of doing things. You die, other people get your shit. 
---
I am constantly astounded as to how many neckbeards on here will scream about keeping the old school feel of the game while also refusing any change to death mechanics.
---
U know xp/h includes bank time right and people starting to chin are around 60-80 range.
---
The spider zeah dungeon
---
Sad if true
---
I especially love the amulet of accuracy to flex.

Is this why purple sweets seem to be a bit higher lately? Lol

i had this exact laptop when i first played osrs
---
Isn’t China more about stealing kidneys from the Muslims living there?
---
Bad sport
---
it's true. And yes, sad as fuck.

Sweet now imagine luring callisto to the safespot and callisto stuns you and then a rag boy pops in and freezes you and then 20 of his mouth breathing friends come in. While callisto is still pummeling you. Lol
---
Last time i do it in a non restricted world. Rather deal with 1 or 2 pkers.
---
&gt;Not Buddhists, Christians or any other religious group.
---
Because ughyurs are muslims
---
China doesn't really care about Islam, they care about ughyur self determination (well denying it)
---
As long as they have their politburo sanctioned reincarnation license
---
Turmoil is too infamous and would never pass polls, we need to add Malevolence, Affliction, and Desolation instead because less people know what they are.
---
Night time in OSRS should be a thing.
---
* Death timer ONLY counts down when you're in-game (great for unstable connection). Can reclaim your items on any world and even across game reboots. Note: All this is possible according to Mod Ash. 
---
* Your items may NEVER become visible to anyone else, as DDoS'ing shouldn't be incentivised in any way. 
---
* Death timer reduced to 20 min (1 hour is way too much, especially now with the connection lost system in place). From 0-5 minutes after death, you may reclaim your items for free. From 5-20 mins, you'll have to pay a fee scaling with the value of your items dropped on death. After 20 mins, your items disappears and are removed from the game. Longer grace period like 7 or 8 mins could even a reward from in-game content like quests.
---
* Death mechanics for UIMs remains unchanged, because it's a crucial part of the gamemode whether you like it or not.
---
I’ve had 8 head drops in 750 kc , 4 leathers , 2 rings and 1 claw. I want pet :(
---
If I apply your logic I can turn it around and say China's Muslims are coincidentally Uyghurs.
---
Can I use the dragon axe spec and a +2 from a stew to get a +5? Or do I just have to get the +5 from stew only?
---
I agree. But with full verac callisto is relatively fast. But damn callisto is as bad as revs. Sometimes get attacked right after luring it.
---
&gt;and say muslims there are Uyghurs. 
---
Wat?
---
Have a guthans switch in inventory, torso is useless when ill have bandos within a few months. Piety doesn't matter because im afking and theyre non aggressive, prpssy doesnt matter because im not praying and d legs have better stats. Thanks for trying to be helpful though unlike the other two.
---
I think the problem is when they did the wild revamp update they wanted quantity over quality.
---
Damn it! We gotta find it
---
Not what I was getting at. I meant to me, delrith was this massive part of runescape, this huge final boss. To my friend, delrith is totally insignificant lol.
---
I was hoping the knight had dumby thick cheeks
---
You can camp callisto tho 🤔
---
But bosses that have massive damage instead of mechanics is pure lazy game design
---
Ok?
---
Be thankful they set you free
---
All fair comments on the basis you are just afking then!
---
Gz on halfway to 99 max btw ;)
---
goodnight
---
Are you being sarcastic? honestly can't tell.  This is obv fake though.
---
Life’s a laugh and death’s a joke, it’s true.
---
bc u were
---
"Chosen one!"
---
...
---
"I'm coming!"
---
You're literally saying their issue is with Uyghurs, not Muslims. The fact that Uyghurs are Muslims is just a coincidence, am I correct? This way you're denying that the Chinese are against Muslims. Sorry to tell you, but Uyghur are just as Chinese as any other. China literally has hundreds of 'racial' sub-groups, only 1 of them are Muslim. Is the fact that only they are targeted, and not any other Chinese minority also a coincidence? Cmonbruh.
---
I laughed out loud hahaha
---
Hi coming!, I'm dad.
---
Did you know magic also has new gear and prayers?
---
I didnt say it doesn't. I said it didn't relate to what we were talking about, which was comparing OSRS gear creep to RS2's power creep with Turmoil.
---
Range is a separate discussion. You came in with a "well actually osrs has a prayer called rigour for ranged". No shit, i didn't deny that. Whats your point?
---
Thanks man atleast you tried to help instead pf just pointing out im not wearing 200m for a slayer task.
---
Most of the people who argue with me on this subreddit
---
But how many pieces of fremennik garbage I wonder
---
Nice one :) On or off task? I gave up at 400 kc off task and decided id be better off just slaying till i get a task.
---
Who is actually paying 30m for this thing still though.. lol.
---
 Yay smack downs! It’s so EPIC 😎 when the Jmods publicly shame their customers and encourage bullying on this subreddit 🤜🏻🤛🏻. It’s also MEGA 💫 cool how they don’t have a proper outlet for customer support like every decent company in the world 🌎 . The most awesome part is how some smackdowns are incorrect and redacted but only after the player has been sufficiently harassed 👌🏻🤬 by twitter and Reddit neckbeards 💩. Keep writing us funny poems so we can stroke your ego Jagex!!!! 😂😂😂 Doing things professionally is so over-rated, and why bother caring when you make a ramen-tier salary living in Cambridge anyways.
---
lol runescape hd had sick graphics. It was still oldschool but more detailed not like current RS3 which just looks like an entirely different game
---
GUN
---
Honestly its just 1b if you raid enough youll make that back easily! Maybe so some tob too
---
&gt; but Uyghur are just as Chinese as any other. 
---
Uyghur's are not chinese, they are a turkish group of people (they even call their homeland, east turkistan)
---

&gt;China literally has hundreds of 'racial' sub-groups, only 1 of them are Muslim. I

They're one of the few ethnic minorities (other being the tibetans) that have fought and demanded for independence from china

It's not my fault that you refuse to accept facts

It’s not hard necessarily but whenever I would make a new account the quest I dreaded the most was one small favor.  I’d say hardest would be DT though
---
Legends quest because of how long it takes
---
Still get PTSD trying to clear the jungle trees south of shilo village when I'm doing clue scrolls
---
Honestly jokes aside I feel like a lot of the players would jump to it. Part of the thrill of the throwback game mode was everyone was on equal footing. Not to mention there was no huge botting issue. 
---
Of course the same issues would come back in a few years. Then we’d have to make another throwback. 
---
Actually, starting to sound like deadman mode and leagues.
---
man i remember v west being sectioned off depending on what you were selling.
---
we need more pvp updates... as you have people like this in less then 200k risk.
---
Not sure about a refund but I’ve had them transfer credit to another account
---
Not to 250k
---
The population was healthy.  But the game peaked in 07.
---
This is one of the most repetitive comments I've ever seen, I love it.
---
I'm on the other end of the spectrum here. 
---
I get that it can feel like you're losing efficiency when you have to use a mirror shield instead of a defender, or something like that. 
---
But I like the lore of having to use special equipment to take down certain monsters, and would actually like to see more dedicated weapon and armour requirements, provided they're on monsters worth killing where it's worth being less efficient.
---
“Who’s been spreading rumours that I use store bought manure?”
---
Real vets are RSC or RS2 launch players.
---
People that actually got 99 str with a dlong or did 99 agility at the fucking wildy course for example
---
I only have like 150 kills and I'm bored af. Can't do it anymore.
---
But what if you pay them with food?

Lol

(:
---
hope your hydra luck is better then mine, 4400 kc no claw.

Use Google. The actual peak was around 2011.

Takes literally 2 seconds to safe spot Ven if you know what you’re doing, and you end up in singles.

Very nice!I was waiting for some high hats to come in though

Good riddance to you.
---
From the very first days of you rigging the polls in your favour by wording and organising the questions in such a way, through to you promising to tell us why reach left (we know anyway) and never telling us, to you pushing your own agenda hard (anyone remember artisan being polled about 5 times?), it's great to see you finally leaving.
---
I haven't played OSRS in 3 years, because I quit the game due to the corrupt people running the game, like you. You ruined an amazing game - again. I've always said that Runescape was an amazing game ruined by idiots. And it happened twice! 
---
Good riddance. I only hope you are not joining a team that is working on any of the games I am playing so you don't stain those games with your corruption. Take your arrogant, devious, selfish self away. I only hope I never hear your name again.
---
Just needs a music video of NPCs and players twerking and thrusting the air then itd be the legit shit.
---
It is.
---
Came here to say this.  It's open source under the BSD license, assuming they wanted to buy it there wouldn't be any place to start.  They could provide binaries (or source I guess) on the OSRS website for free, but even doing that they'd have to give credit to the contributers and the license on the source in it's current state.  And furthermore, assuming "buying it" was an option, there are over 350 people that have contributed to runelite for free, just because they love the game and they want to see a kickass client.  Why would Jagex want to take that out of the hands of volunteers and start paying people to do it?
---
Runecrafting makes great money
---
Ill get it for diarys eventually, just not worth the time investment when you have so little and suck at ba.
---
what in the chinning fuck is this
---
Did you change your name and wait for the pillory guard to appear just for this meme?
---
So what he has a main with bulk gp yet is still that nooby that he’s wearing an amulet of accuracy to melee?
---
SHE NEEDS SOME MILK!
---
Your title is some skills suck and you go on to ask for a discussion because the game is outdated and at the bottom have a suggestion which would be better off in a suggestion post rather than cockblocked behind all the bullshit at the top.
---
Just bc you fell for it doesn’t mean you deserved it. Just want to make that clear.
---
Dramen will be your best friend again after you die once with it
---
I mean it's subject to balancing, shorter timer, higher cost of ingredients, etc .
---
RS3s way of dealing with it was by locking the herb needed for it behind only being able to be grown in the wilderness. Though we know how this game's audience would react to that...
---
Damn that’s kinda crazy lol mine were 167 and 421 respectively
---
That shit draws prayer points like a bitch, it extended trips to near infinity because we had pack yaks, prayer renewal pots and 6 dose potions. Maybe they could make it so you can’t flick it? Just like turmoil
---
That is fine, as long as we keep the discuss on point it is ok to be a bit combative for what you think is best. As long as we don't get out of control! Something I should clarify is that this wouldn't be more efficient than existing methods in the game. It would just be an alternative for people who don't enjoy the available options.
---
That would be an interesting spin on it. Maybe the gnomes could be in the couriers guild offering beverages and have their own part of the delivery service. Something like drift net fishing, part fishing part hunter. This would be cooking/agility. I like it!
---
!remindme 32 hours
---
Quest version of vorkath was easy for me at 70 range, took 1 attempt. I was just short of killing galvek though. Just couldn't pump out enough dps. Defeated galvek at 75 range.
---
You sound like you're levelling an alt, you can afford to cannon for a few hours.
---
Having never played after the introduction of hunter into OSRS way back. I do not know the minigame. My apologies.
---
I'm with the other guy on construction. The gameplay loop is garbage. You mention agility because it's click&gt;wait&gt;click&gt;wait repeat but construction is even worse with its loop of hold 1, right click&gt;build&gt;right click&gt;remove&gt;click butler repeat. It's the most static and repetitious skill in game barring maybe thieving and even that has a strong alternative in Pyramid Plunder. People only tolerate Construction because it's over 200k xp/hour at worst, and can break 600k xp/hour.
---
Delrith? 
---
Look, I just slaughtered about three hundred demons in a row because Duradel felt like giving shitty task today. Do you really think I bother myself with learning each of their name?
---
And the problem is people not in 3rd world countries have dynamic IP too, so you can only go off the ISP
---
Lol i was just kidding i have no idea what any of those things are including turmoil
---
People already die in (near) BiS gear and this will make some people take welfare gear instead of BiS. What do you think the result of that will be? Less deaths?
---
How? I don't think they can
---
yes, but it wasn't there when turmoil originally released

That’s not bad for a 3-man. If you can, try to not point cap on raid potions until you can Ovl, those give more points than aids/revites. Not sure by how much, though.
---
If you add a skiller, they could scale it to a 4-man, do your prep, and point cap you for gathering, but then it’s less split (but faster* raids, no prep)
---
The fashionscape version of dramenstaff
---
Yeah, my runelite client just shits the bed and crashes almost every time. Turning the gpu plugin off prevents the crashes but the games almost unplayable since my ingame FPS is around 20-30 with the client turned off. 1060gb gtx btw
---
You laughed hard? Dude you have issues. Who laughs hard at *this*?
---
Woox has one on his youtube channel, where he also combines it with firemaking for insane (combined) rates

Can't shield flick with scythe unfortunately, tried it and you get nuked when you damage basilisk without shield.

Two options:

Lies.
---
Your soft personal data IP/location/credit card or payment method/old ass previous passwords when you didn't care about security have been found by a hijacker and those can trick the recovery system at impersonating you good enought to skip 2FA and your current password, because Jagex Moderators are clueless on security.
---
I really appreciate the reply. We usually end up at olm with a couple of our own restores/brews left. I’ll let the bois know to be cautious about potting up before we Ovl. Thanks again I really appreciate it
---
People like you are the reason I have a ge slot tied up for days or weeks thank you for your service
---
1150 kills in.. only got heads.. no other uniques
---
I expect an engaging story with great dialogue, player choice and lasting effects in the world. 
---
I see you noticed that I didn't include decent quests into my list of bad quests! Not like even those had many memorable moments in them, besides maybe the DS2 final boss and the freeing of Baxtorian.
---
Just because the quests sucked before, doesn't mean they have to follow that same pattern of suckage forever. The OSRS questing system is a gold mine for top-tier RPG questing, yet it's wasted with irrelevant "charm" that gets maybe one or two chuckles out of you.

If you’d like help with raids you should check out the We Do Raids discord. There’s an encyclopedia of knowledge about raids written there as well as some good people to ask questions to. If you’d like an invite link you can pm me, or just google it
---
think all the "reddit should not be your customer support" scared them off
---
You’ll go back one day and get cleaned. The fact you stayed means you have the same addiction as the person who lost.
---
&gt;Jagex has also got better at balancing updates than they did before.
---
With the exception of this update it seems.
---
Not the ip address of course, which jagex doesn't ask you either.
---
But the isp shouldn't be such an unknown...
---
I stay at exactly 100 because it lets you do a lot more with elite void bossing and you can be 99 range and mage.
---
32 Farming = Ranars = Money
---
To do that you need to force proc redemption with the locator orb from ds2. You can't just tick eat the ball
---
You’d think they’d be able to afford to pay a customer support team by now..
---
Have both them blocked. Bye Felicia
---
Fucking rs3 refugees ruining this game wanting everywhere to be safe. 
---
This game used to have some risk and consequences for death.
---
No lol never needed arena for it..just a guard or something to attack and then spec as it dies then wait for it to charge back up to full.
---
I don't think they're comparable. 
---
If tomorrow, to combat RWT/botting, Jagex added a trade limit and removed the wilderness: the game would easily drop down 50% of it's player base.    
---
If tomorrow, Jagex removed 3rd Party clients, do you truly believe the game would experience a similar hit? I don't think so.
---
I clearly understand were you come from, but here are the problems.
---
1. This would cause the dragon pickaxe to do down ALOT in value, like the dragon axe(used to be like 1m or so back then and now can be get it wintertodt and priced about 60k)
---
2. The Wilderness bosses will have WAYY less pvmers to approach causing pkers to complain of how "dead content" it is since the ONLY purpose for pvmers to go to wildy is getting the unique drops in those bosses and that would cause Jagex to make "integrity changes" as an excuse.
---
How to kinda fix your problem?
---
1. Try to get a total skill on 2k to gain acces to 2k worlds, there are pkers yes... but less than you expect. So it's a good chance to dodge them.
---
2. Have a friend to be a scout or your body guard if you really need it ( which you will in the future) the fact that mostly only 1 person shows up, they tage em and you simply run.
---
3. There are some safespots for some bosses, I HIGHLY recommend venen and veition since callisto is like level 40 deep so escaping is gonna be an issue. ( I know from experience)
---
4. Always bring 2 d hides since pkers mostly ice barrage like hell so survive longer ofc. 
---
I hope this helps, trust me I'm a smol high level noob and I got 113kc callisto kills and got a pick. and pkers get 40k drop loot on me so they never get shit from me anyways. If there is anything wrong or messing I do apologise.
---
This game is just filled with new players that will slowly run it into the ground. They can’t comprehend the thought of actually risking their pixels.
---
Simple yet efficient, very true too!
---
Whats IM?
---
Oiy! That does hurt.
---
I just imagine some sad sack carefully examining every bit of any text jungleflux releases then cheering ecstacy and calling for their caretaker in celebration of making yet another 'literally unplayable' meme.
---
Just block them. You'll need them block for konar when getting hydra task anyway
---
My irl friend is like this on runescape too, 5 mins to respond to a pm and short answers. I curse the day he discovered nmz
---
Bloke had to change his name LOOOOOL
---
I still use my password I used 10 years ago and I know exactly which ISP we had back then. It’s not that hard to remember.
---
And? That's only a couple hundred thousand more than the going rate
---
Aggression potion is huge op
---
RC bad
---
Like I understand if you're going under the guise of menu re-ordering like RuneLite. But if you add in a plugin that literally adds a "Nuke" option to a menu item that trains a skill much faster than before... You can't make it anymore obvious.
---
I'm asking you to get another.
---
Do you also hold down+B when catching Pokemon?
---
i feel that way about the random pixel misplacements. i genuinely was reading it nonchalant and caught it
---
You can't do that. I can't be asked
---
Hunter is fast sub 80 with birdhouses
---
Farming is fast with tree/fruit trees
---
Construction is fast but expensive and effort

This is really sad.

The UK criminal background check is much more stricter than that of the US. For example, employers can't just do a background check on a potential employee willy-nilly. They must ask for consent. Depending on the field of work they are in, different levels of criminal record checking are carried out.
---
These are:
---
* Basic DBS (most jobs) - reveals unspent convictions and/or cautions.
---
* Standard DBS (dealing with vast amounts of money and similar professions) such as accountant - reveals spent and unspent convictions and/or cautions.
---
* Enhanced DBS (dealing with "sensitive" people - the disabled, children, etc.) Teachers, doctors, and some types of therapists fall under this. Same as standard except also reveals any other information such as arrests, witness statements.
---
In Jed's field he is most likely going to be a programmer which would make him fall under the basic DBS check most of the time. If his conviction (if he was convicted, I don't know) is spent, then as long as he works in the UK, chances are his criminal past won't affect him getting a job. Unless he becomes a financial director or something. Though I can say from experience in this field a lot employers generally don't carry out criminal background checks so yeah.
---
Can't you just turn off the purchase and if you want to later repurchase? Also still no the BiS helm SHOULD NOT come from a mid tier quest were you grind an afk monster.  That not only opens really bad doors it's a shit way to do it.  If this is okay whats next all BiS content coming from mid level quests then a no skill grind? It's boring and has no place in OSRS
---
Over 2k kc first my first whip, haven't seen head yet :)

---
not sure if your trolling but if your getting lower fps on the osrs client compared to runelite you just need to set the osrs client to max performance because its not set to that when you download it
---
I'm a newcomer to his videos and i blocked his channel after seeing two random videos. That whole chestbrah thing is a seriously cringy inside joke.

They’re not kids lol they’re just stupid 20 somethings. You have to also understand that people who play play to win games and have never heard of runescape who only found out about it through the App Store don’t know or care about the fundamentals of the game. They 1 are ready to spend a lot of money on a pay to win game and b are the worst kind of filthy fucking casuals which then produces this.
---
I was lucky to get it off task, I kinda wanted to grind out another one, but I kinda lost hope after mod ash said it was 5 times more rare when you're not on a task. I'm happy with the 21m though, never would've guessed it was gonna rise in price though

OSBuddy released some very overpowered plugins, forcing Jagex’s hand to address them. People are speculating it will be an entire blanket ban and are being militant assholes about it.

I'd recommend training smithing at blast furnace, and in between going for a coal bag at motherload mine.
---
The blast furnace is around 500k/hour for steel bars with the coal bag.

I thought it was supposed to be a team boss
---
What were these "overpowered" plugins and what did they do?
---
Yes it did. This is a real cool style too.

Is there a list of best to worse DPS for f2p weapon types?

---
short sword
---
scimmy
---
It's still a decent amount of money and tedious klicking. And I think u can do 4x4 house

we don't know, weights haven't been released yet

Ooo I didn't know that, thanks I'll do wintertodt for the dragon pickaxe then!!

But I thought these 3d party clients are being used by streamers and almost everyone. Even Woox use RuneLite, I didn't know they were bannable.
---
While I agree both should be removed, they are not the same thing at all. One reorders existing menu options; the other adds new options for macros. Moving a right click to left click is bad, but Jagex has been okay with that. Making a new left click that does multiple clicks and movements is not okay and Jagex has not allowed it.
---
pretty much this. feels like he just slaps it randomly through the video at this point
---
I bet you'd love it at r/iamverysmart
---
Oh, I thought those were just the Jagex leaders?
---
my dumb ass would still get it wrong.
---
Against the written rules, yes. But so are a lot of things that are allowed. There has yet to be any statement excluding them from the rules so until then it is unknown where these plugins fall.
---
Lol do you play like 5 hours a day, every day?
---
Stellar work man. Your debate skills are out of this world
---
So why are you **arguing** at all then? We're talking about how accuracy has no impact on the max hit or likelihood of hitting the max compared to a 0-0 once your accuracy roll registers as a "hit". Read more and comment less.
---
Probably flexing his ham robe stacks. why did he bank that many ham robes on an ironman?
---
ive seen lots of noobs that paid money for pixels but this one takes the crown lol
---
Its all good because we dont have EOC.
---
Lol jagex balancing things...
---
But it's bis man come on...
---
Thank you for posting your solution. Found this via search. With 75 defense I'm not able to last super long with obby (with or without absorbs), so I'm going to wait to get 80 before I do full on 100% afk. That and I need to unlock Roald
---
To be completely fair, even with an expected value decrease of 20%, it's still a pretty decent moneymaker for barely any requirements.
---
So ios users can do this but android has had mouse support for years and Jagex blocks it as an input for osrs.
---
Spirit tree to Steve
---
it's i've never skipped a task while playing on my account because the idea of slayer is ur forced to have a variety of tasks. currently i'm on a cerberus task which i still want to complete. + i'm close to also getting my 4th slayer helm color unlocked.
---
aight dude
---
Make sure to restart your phone after enabling the setting. And if you get more of those messages appear, close the osrs app. Relaunch it when selecting the 2nd split screen app. 
---
If you have the force multi window setting in your developer options, it should work.
---
There have been a few occasions where osrs didn't want to launch properly, but just closing it and trying again worked for me.
---
group ironman is a waste of dev time, it'll be that niche gamemode thats played by like 300 people for a week
---
I'm confused lol, can you link me?
---
Why do you need two? Why do you even need 1, its not that good, and if you just waited a week you would save millions
---
Gratz!
---
Still recoils 30+ for free if you anti

It's best in slot helm? And I have 2 accs I play? And my bank is 5-6b so what is a few mill loss? I loose more on my ely overnight than I will in a month on this helm...

Thats just the max amount that it tracks. If you drop cash on the ground it also stops at 65k

---
Staking is a really stupid way to make money seeing as how it's a net loss long term. It's also easier to get cleaned than it is to turn 5m into 200m.
---
What if it was a student internet, how would you know then. Or if you were a kid and your mom fixed the wifi for you
---
Does the one that goes beneath your feet travel faster then the other ones? 
---
I seem to take a lot of damage because sometimes i'll just click 2 squares next to me and the pools will all be clumped up - they don't seem to render until i'm actually taking damage? - and i'll take a bunch of damage from doing that, and then when I get sick of that i'll click wild and the pools will fly wild.
---
Perhaps it's just my anecdotal experience and it might improve over time or as I get better or something, but I *really* have trouble with those things.
---
Turmoil is an Ancient Curse, it increases your melee accuracy, strength, and defense while draining those stats from your opponent. 
---
Malevolence is an upgraded Turmoil, and Desolation/Affliction are the Ranged/Magic versions of it respectively.
---
For some reason I misread it as well 🤔
---
You both are dumb lol
---
Yea exactly, there's only two ways to go about it really.
---
Jagex choose the option to make it harder to remove skull, so they see an issue with removing the skull very quickly.. but why not go all the way?
---
They could make skulls stay when you die but reduce the amount of time of having a skull as a compromise. Right now it's 20 minutes.
---
How much have you made from all them hydra kills?
---
RuneLite averages say it's 1/800 on task and 1/4000 off task so no reason to complain yet
---
Glad to see the historical erasure of Tibet was so successful. Maybe 40 years down the line, when a new group is getting purged, and someone says “the Muslims are safe”, you’ll understand what’s so disgusting about your ignorance. China’s been doing this for awhile, it didn’t start, and won’t stop with, the Uyghurs. 
---
It’s despicable what they are doing, nobody is safe from “Big Brother” in China
---
Did you mean: Black Demons in Chasm of Fire?
---
I don't live by efficiencyscape by any means, but the skip is there so you aren't forced to do the shitty slow tasks that don't have any gain outside of xp and skipping would increase all of those. But if you are grinding basilisks anyway you might as well do wildy slayer, and hellhound tasks are pretty common anyway.
---
If you dont want to spend your current points, it is way better for you to do wilderness slayer for 10-15 tasks then skip for basilisks, even if its slower (probably faster) you will get slayer xp, streak build, and not waste your time and ppots on basilisks imo.
---
I’m sure it will be blocked for iOS soon enough.
---
literally who cares

Incredible

Sry for phone pic I was drunk keep at it you got this

Actually agility just decreases the run recovery time
---
It doesn't travel *faster* but you're one tile away from her so it shows up immediately. If you're ranging you can dodge it; it's difficult to do if you're meleeing.
---
Lol so some people spend like $30 on bcp and tassets? Jesus
---
Lol thx
---
It's actually way better to use an imbued magic short bow.
---
Im at 3b but i will still just use serp while the hype dies down, I guess you dont have to take helm off while ranging/maging for barely any more damage, but Thats about it, it can wait
---
Bring karambwan
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but don’t they have tournament worlds where you can practice this kind of thing? That way you don’t have to learn the process on a HCIM.
---
LMAO
---
Why does having to bank between PvM mean so much?
---
Did a “we do raids” raid with my friend and one random last night. The guy was so very entitled and annoying and constantly kept saying “if you do ‘x’” I’m leaving. It’s really frustrating having someone so toxic in your group when they’re the one who was looking for someone to join up with. I’m there should be badges for certified cunts like that. They make the game experience so much worse and as you know the osrs experience is dependent on other players in a lot of cases.
---
The site is just blank with a question mark in the center
---
Does anyone

see the error of my ways
---
This is valuable thank you.

Rng like everything else i got one off task at 25 kills sold for 34m everyone is merching them lol

Increasing how long you can stay at a trip introduces more rare drops into the game at a faster rate. Dropping prices and making the game infinitely easier.
---
LOL
---
If they were to partner with any third party client it would most likely be with osbuddy
---
I watched that maxing video just 30 minutes ago wtf
---
I'd say "using the boost" would prevent confusion

LMFAO doubt
---
100% true lol
---
Nah. Konar is the only one to assign Hydras, I think. Duradel can assign Wyrms and Drakes.
---
With the exception of GWD you can probably bank and return to any boss in less than 60 seconds.
---
If youre still doing it later today I'm down to join. Ign: 22cigars. 96 combat and a prerty good understanding of the minigame

---
I probably should have, in retrospect. My block list was already full before they were released, so I didn't.
---
It will, what if most of your group quits? Then you're just a solo group Ironman. You need to be really careful with who you group up with. Most people will just altscape it to gather supplies for a main iron
---
The green icons are all fake. Lookup the accounts, they're regular accounts on the highscores. Not even ironmen.
---
I like the idea of being able to give people roles and such.
---
You have one person going the slayer route in order to provide the unique drops to their team mates, someone providing the necessary food/potions and other supplies needed, maybe someone collecting skilling supplies in order to gain levels for questing, diaries and such.
---
That way you're having a lot less of a grind on each person, and you can always switch things up later down the road too if you get bored of it.
---
Team work is great, but yeah I'm unsure how many groups would actually function like that long term.
---
they should just make pre-ge game mode, with the only restriction is you cant use ge but can trade betweem pre-ge mans, so it would be like pre-ge days filled with people spamming  in varrock west bank
---
Sadly doesnt work for me, it Just crashes after few seconds.
---
On the topic of hiscores, Uim and hcim are just harder versions of Ironman. Both modes appear on the normal ironman hiscores and can "deiron" to be just a normal Ironman. Group Ironman is easier, and wouldn't appear on the normal ironman hiscores or be able to "deiron" to a normal ironman. They'd probably be forced to a main of they wanted to leave group.
---
I only bring this up because you say "separate hiscores just like hcim or uim" but in reality it'd be separated even more than that

Not as pathetic as you being the saltiest person in this sub reddit.  lol

Spend an hour or two buying items from shops and selling them to the GE. Buying chocolate from Nardah can net you about 400k/hour.
---
Then spend that on magic or prayer training. I splashed curse up to 43 magic, then used superheat item up to 55. That costed me about half a mill and took a couple of hours.
---
For prayer, buy dragon bones and use them on a guided altar in the house party world. I spent about 450k on 43 prayer, but I could have saved money by questing more.
---
Working on my first hardcore ironman.

Besides questing what are some random tips and tricks for the early game?

Glad I bought mine when clay packs were tradeable, rip

Wow, it does work! Thanks!

I see. Annoying. I guess it is a decent way of throttling the amount of recovery requests they get though.

this shield plus Rune Gauntlets.. ppl would flock to you in PvP just bcuz you had a higher risk lool

Just get good. They are expensive because better players will pay more than you

GPU support, a button to take screenshot, skybox, and I'm sold

It's just because this sub wants a wilderness bank and safespot. They dont care about clan wars.

Go look at all the old posts and see how much this sub pushes for it to be in the wilderness and how a desert clan wars "just wouldnt work or feel right".

300 KC Zulrah milestone decided to do some quests and Go back to Zulrah later

was gonna correct your "an" but 1337 can be pronounced both "leet" and "elite" so i guess its fine

Well that's from the company adding it vs some dickhead who writes botting scripts

had same problem, tried few months later and it worked

I know enough. You know they're only 8 monsters who have rune dart drops while 25 monsters rune arrows drops.
---
I decided to take a break from agility and get 100% in all houses for white graceful. It's all pretty chill so far...except for Lovakengj...the gas clouds in the mine piss me off so much. Only 50% more and then I'm done.
---
He can't keep getting away with it!
---
did 115m in 130 kc, i kill around 20 of them per hour so it took me 6.5 hours, 115/6.5 = 17.6m/h for that task
---
im fine with that
---
You're refusing to acknowledge the similarities. I never said they were equivalent. 
---
I hope the really define what the limits are, because it's inarguably been a slippery slope example here.
---
Yes, shift drop is fine. I think mobile has also shown some unreasonably difficult UI aspects for PC, and if the game has more merit than cookie clicker (I think it does, people play guitar hero. We play tick hero) it can withstand UI improvement.
---
Try playing it using the volume icon instead of the play button, works a treat every time for me

I made this design as part of a button pack that will be sold at the Special Effect charity event the afternoon before Runefest! More info on that [here](https://twitter.com/TracyRoshLuna/status/1178332444686192641?s=20).

Whats the fastest way to get a basilisk task? Low on points but unlocked them from higher level masters. Just tough it out with duradel or do quick tasks from vannaka?
---
I think he's referencing his actual bank account, the ones with cards and cheque books. So he can't get any of the money he had from selling runescape gold.

Oh so you think that parents should beat their kids?

Currently in Las Vegas having a great time. Bless my RNG boys, I need to hit some numbers on the dice tables tonight. When I get back to OSRS it’ll be getting 78 Herblore on the iron and finally being able to do some raids so pretty exciting stuff going on.
---
Normies are not blessed by the chest
---
God no not more drama alert bull shit... p.s i saw him one ticking bones in game with osbuddy at chaos altar so if he makes a vid about that he is  a hypocrite
---
Who cares
---
PvP in this game involves a lot of trash talking. You should be aware from the outset if you are nooby or godlike, and against noobs or experienced players they will almost always talk shit and fling ugly insults. If you don’t like that don’t pvp or get used to turning chat off.
---
Has the iron man flair and doesn't know btw?
---
Tassies are 1/381, you're not even at drop rate to call yourself dry yet.

Jagex doesn't seem to be looking to expand the pmod base at all..

Absolutly zero intention to mute lvl3 accs spamming the g.e. in every single world with lures, scamms or advertising
---
Dudes got barrows gloves but using a rune chest and legs isn’t something you see every day. Also a dragon spear at Abby demons is strange considering he’s got stats for a whip.
---
Spells with different accuracy ratings. 
---
Spells with combination rune requirements. 
---
Spells which are buffed with God items. 
---
Spells which have mechanical counter play.

Spells which damage based off your opponents offensive bonus rather than defensive.

Spells which work IRL

---
If you don't care about task streak you could skip tasks with Turael
---
dummy thicc daemonette
---
Tis’ a flex
---
that's the yolk
---
I think an interesting effect could be that it'll still leech your opponent's stats, but instead of draining their melee attack/strength it drains the style that the Prayer is supposed to be strong against. So Turmoil would leech an opponent's Ranged to boost their strength, Ranged would Leech Magic, and Magic would Leech Melee. It would certainly make Tribrid fights a LOT more interesting, while allowing lower level specialized builds to crush the defenses of Rigour tanks.
---
Yeah im probably going to do this when i turn my pure into a main
---
Banned!
---
Yeah idk why hes being downvoted, I dont agree with him but thats probably because I like GM quests, I think his opinion is reasonable when talking about someone who hated questing
---
My guess is music cape
---
Oh so you think that entitled little shits listen to reason?
---
I literally think about how much potential there is for a good cartoon with how the aggro system works every time I lose aggro, but could never think of a good way to put it into words. You did great bud.
---
;)
---
The sky ruined my immersion, its not just pitch black void smh my head
---
The real question is how did he not 1 hit the spider
---
This can't be right... The scouter just says "nice".
---
Sounds like you’re doing the best you can so don’t sweat it. Smithing is a long grind.
---
Just FYI doing gold+mith is more efficient though.
---
Trip 1 gold + coal bag, after xp drop switch to ice gloves grab bars.
---
Trip 2 mith + coal bag after you grab bars switch to gold gloves.
---
This is going to give you less profit (something like breaking even) but way more xp.
---
He's probably doing turael tasks to point boost or skip without spending points for a better task.
---
In this case you're talking about maybe 10k to save a minute or so, calculate that out and it'd be like spending 600k to save an hour, which if he has that gear he can probably make 5m+ an hour.
---
In other words, there's nothing wrong with this picture.
---
Nothing at all, we all think it, hes just brave enough to say it.
---
I recently subconsciously made the decision to go for Max cape rather than just train in general. After this I understand why I lot of high-level players vote 'no' to new skills without even looking into or considering them.
---
should give you a mole skin too
---
Such pure times, when it was all about fun. Missed those pure wars in clan wars as well where we made captains and chose teams. :'(
---
Dont feel too bad, most likely it's a grown dude with a full time job making like 70k a year who hasn't played since he was a kid.

It's scientifically proven that being hit as a kid has a massively negative impact on your mental health, even if it's just "punishment" and not abuse.
---
What are the f2p pking hotspots? Do people even go into deep wildy on f2p anymore?
---
it might actually be more to do with future job searches? If you google his name you literally get ‘sacked for bug abuse’ and all the other youtube shite pops up
---
No need to put that much effort into it. Just vote yes to the harmless first two questions and vote no on the rest. If we actually do want this gear, we want it obtained outside of PVP, not in a way that only 5% of the community has access to.
---
?
---
Why is my booty shaking!?!
---
Mamma mia
---
It really is a lot of fun if you learn how to play.
---
Sold my first claw for 94m. It takes the in game price checker a long time to get up to date market price on newly released items. Don't know why tho. But you can see it with a Basilisk Jaw right now. The game shows it's 1M when dropped, but it's being sold for around 25M at the ge.
---
This has struck me as well. But no, my guess is that the Dragonkin created only the Olm. IIRC, it's remarked in the Tale of the Righteous quest that the caves themselves predate Xeric, suggesting someone was there before him. Xeric and his servants fought the Olm, but he probably only created the lizardmen. 
---
The lizardmen worshipping the Olm feels reasonable, since they are "related". That would explain the Olmic statues around their settlements. 
---
What I also noticed is that the Xerican symbol seems to resemble that of Zaros - might be a coincidence, but you never know...
---
It's too late my friend.
---
nice
---
So Callisto is only worth using Veracs on him. The strategy is you don't risk much while using Veracs if you stay unskulled.
---
hmm..giving me ideas...
---
The first two questions seemed harmless so I voted yes to those, ended up voting no on every other question though. Don't say I never did you any favors PKers! Enjoy having additional Rune pouches and Looting bags. Too bad about the rest.
---
Lol, I'm still getting the content I want. I kill players, pixels dont mean shit.
---
Thanks my dude. For sure. I know it wouldn't have worked out long term lol
---
Damn you bout to get the full wrath of the snowflakes!
---
10/10 tho
---
Soloing zalcano
---
well that doesnt make any sense.
---
Lmao, if someone came over to your house right now and smacked you in the face it'd have no impact on me in any way but if I heard about it on the news I'd think it was wrong. 
---
Plus it's not even true that it doesn't impact me. If nobody bought gold, then there'd be no incentive for people to sell it, which means there'd be no incentive for those gold sellers to have gigantic bot farms that basically everyone who plays this game has noticed and complained about at one time or another. 
---
Stop buying gold.
---
Good call. What's the first teleport device I should go for? Besides tele runes?
---
Aaty?
---
You have to complete a minigame called "Job searching".
---
You  should really train up your skills before, during, and after completing the minigame as the rewards change all the time. Having skills like "Plumbing" or completing quests like "Bacholers of Engineering" gives you huge benefits in this minigame.
---
Anyway you get rewards in the form of currency depending on where in the world you are, and you can redeem it for bonds.
---
yeah and i bet you like dicke and balls
---
Curtis is at 2500 off task without one
---
Wasn't Veos supposed to be Xeric if you used the Ring of Charos on him?
---
E: [He's King Shayzien VII.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Xeric)
---
You &amp; framed deep wild pk video please
---
I like drakes and wyrms
---
likely 1/512 we'll see tho
---
we should start to network runelite loot-tracker too pool in all different kc/loots to inverse engineer drop rates early on tbh
---
Bruh he knows, we all know.
---
My understanding is that alt boosting is always allowed except in specific cases like being a mule in Last Man Standing.
---
They are buffing them somehow to be less easier to kill, which means they will either add new attack to them (similar to the quest boss) or change their hp/damage.
---
at least you got your double xp
---
its exactly what hes talking about. what are YOU talking about?
---
Not really.
---
Half of the roles can just AFK after doing very little.
---
I haven't seen a link yet.
---
Goddamn that sounds like a lot of work. 
---
Is there a quick guide on the wiki for that? Or better yet an third party client cheat plugin I can use before the statement?
---
where are runelite averages??? i'll show you d pick please anwser me
---
AKA, once they finish their objectives in each wave? Yeah. Once all the roles have finished their objectives, the wave is over.
---
That's how ya play the minigame.
---
It all makes sense now
---
Let’s see your research. You’ve  found some sources and can whip them right back up, eh?
---
Nooooooooo!
---
If they've always been concerned about botting, why not just say, add in some daily bonus exp rewards with a cap on it. Etc say, while pvping players in zones you could get like points for killing players, touring the zones, perhaps safe pvp like a clan wars with provided elemental runes but say a Honor system like wow that could maybe be used to provide alternative methods for unbuyables/earnables such as say, Sharks, brews, etc, or resource crates with wildy use only foods and brews/ppots. And you could say, cap the bonuses for the first 3-4 hours each day, but still enable pvp on the others, etc. I mean it's the fun of fighting that makes pvp exciting but gratitious risk only to have no chance if you don't risk literal bank amounts to a skull trick and have less experience and aren't playing on a pure designed specifically for the wildy aren't fun. But a safe pvp minigame with xp rewards would be fun. Just look at how jam packed castle wars and soul wars and stealing creation were.
---
worst case scenario i get a really good indepth view of their drop table before the wiki is updated and i enjoy camping creatures, i got like 22k abby demons killed on my main hunting for an abyssal head drop
---
Dumbest shit I've ever read
---
1.4mil range xp and ongoing, almost at 2k kills got 99 Range out of it atleast :p and 9.4mil
---
If you can safespot with a DoT effect you can do the same with attacks from a distance, spells or ranged attacks. So, not sure how it would be inherently OP.
---
Get mystic ibans and bdhide rune cbow and rebuild at pepega zulrah / barrows
---
They are literally the exact same thing. Buying bonds is 100% equivalent to 3rd party rwt
---
I used to bank my ham sets too, on my normie iron, really no particular reason, but you tele out for the clue long before you need to bank so after the quest I just figured why not see how many more than 2 sets I can get. But then I had to drop it all, because you get more and more good PVM drops you have no space left.
---
One of the best and most useful plugins for curious people like me
---
If you use a super potion dose to cast the spell, it would apply the normal potion dose to x-number of players in an area. So the benefit would be distributed as opposed to directly shared.
---
I know it's hard for redditors to grasp for some reason, and while these plugins are kind of OP they aren't doing what you guys claim. They are providing quicker access to a single game/server action. They are using client-side menu manipulation to get to a server-side action faster. None of these plugins are replacing more than a single game action.
---
This means that from Jagex's end they all look like simple menu swaps (if they can even see that much and not just that you're on a 3PC). There is no solution without engine work to add more server-side checks for client-side manipulation.
---
For you, Army.
---
Imgur is popular on like any forum, I remember using it on RSPS like 9 years ago.
---
Rune arrows are cheaper than addy arrows because they are dropped commonly by commonly killed slayer monsters (like fire giants) more than addy arrows noob
---
This feels like a Tim and Eric skit and I love it.
---
Sarachnis Cudgel or Zamorakian Hasta for Cerb assuming no spectral?
---
None of those menu interactions or mouse movements have anything to do with server/game actions. It's all client-side menu manipulation, not altering the server-side game itself. None of these plugins replace more than single action. There isn't much Jagex is able or willing to do without some engine work to add more server-side checks for client-side menu alterations.
---
yep . and why would he fight you?
---
Or you could keep it how it is where better armor/weapon give higher accuracy, and higher level spells give more damage.  Although it’s not a bad idea
---
Why would you need spells that only use combination runes?
---
I like that idea thanks for explaining it.
---
This would kill PKing imo. The only people that would do it would be the top percentile, everyone else would be so far behind that they wouldn’t stand a chance (or it would just turn in to RNG switches).
---
Would you recommend dumping all of my remaining cash stack into hasta and sss?
---
I mean I read the dialogue. I also looked up the npc prior and saw that he used to give you frem items for like sharks or something. So I brought sharks and my cash stack thinking that would work. Could have just brought my ring of charos after reading the whole charmed thing but damn I wasn’t expecting 150k. Plenty of people also bought the traceable version and lost out that way too haha. It is what it is. Still a nice quest. Albeit short imo.
---
it happens or it doesnt
---
I just mass fletch and cut mine and drop them for inventory spaces and good drops on good tasks. Go to entrana, cut, fletch 28 at a time, etc. Never run out.
---
That 13m clue
---
Do you know how to set up the spider for the safespot? Makes lova 200 times more tolerable
---
How is that better?
---
Ive done lots of KQ with different set ups, and hasta isnt that great. bgs/dwh plus veracs for the first phase is great. At 85 all melee stats, if I get at least 1 bgs spec in, lll hit every single veracs attack, which can hit decently high too and through its remaining defense.
---
&lt;3
---
That's the thing. The average player is irrelevant in this situation. So are their opinions about the current system being fine. There are over 8,000 maxed players now, and an unknown amount of super-rich (although Jagex would know). You're right that these groups of people are being horribly fucked over based on the security needs of the average account. Disgraceful.
---
Sit
---
There is a lure method that allows you to flinch it and take very little to no damage at all
---
Maybe angle your camera so that you see the ghost in a line and pray the next if the previous has attacked
---
Death by snoo snoo!
---
This is sufficient information to access his account; it’s now compromised unless he changes his position relative to the nugget immediately
---
Alot of things could be good brother, if you're looking to stay low combat, then things like fletching, cooking, fishing, woodchop, mining would probably be solid, some with take more reqs than others tho!
---
These were good times, but it will never be 2007/2008 again and we will never play RuneScape on Firefox while watching RSMVs on YouTube, and we will never be 12 again.
---
I'm playing a HCIM. My next major goal is 70 prayer for morytania hards. I'll be killing blue dragons in taverly as I have the short cut unlocked. 
---
My question: should I do the glory grind first? I have all the gear I'll need to start the blue dragon grind already (just got my hands on a rune xbow and broads), but I'm using a power ammy at the moment. Good enough? Or do the crafting grind now?
---
Can I get a guide to actually having this kind of outlook/reaction to shitty in-game situations like these?
---
Everyone have the same conditions.
---
 Sure fix some mechanics first but if you make it 14+ it will be harder to find proper match ... I would make it 7-20 each team with 7 you can already change strategy of 3-4 deff att or 4-3 or do some yolo strategy like all in which is risky ... 
---
Also make respawn timer so you wont nonsense rush into enemy I will add this note into edit.
---
If you already have the typical slayer gear, then might as well try it out. Spectral is also good for zammy, which you should do on task. Spear is 1/127 and sotd is 1/508.
---
It was a rhetorical question. If you continued reading that was my entite point about why rune darts are so expensive. B/c not alot of monsters drop them. 8 monsters drop rune darts.. 25 monsters drop rune arrows. Sit down dummy
---
Technically yeah it is. It transfers inflation from that game into this game.
---
I doubt a slayer alt would be wearing those items, specially dragon full.
---
I use it at Vorkath, COX, and all quests and clues.
---
Haha he had to lose that sick 3 letter name too
---
Yah everyone says lance is faster than dhcb at vorkath, but there forgetting the Ruby bolt specs make a huge difference over time.
---
I would never be able to get a sub 1 minute kill with a lance, never! But hit a few 100's and slap 60's for the rest of the kill than I will get my sub 1 minute.
---
Members unlocks a whole lot of things, at first if you're lower lvl then itll be harder to sustain a bond, but at higher stats the money is easier to make. Realistically if you're able to make 500k per day(easily doable with like green dragons or somethin) then youll have a bond and a bit extra to spare
---
Why don't you read them?

Lots of warding no votes were maxed people voting against losing their capes. You really think the pkers would have voted en masse against more magic equipment?

I made this meme because I remember listening to a classical piece on YouTube, and then putting on the OSRS background music, and realizing how tinkery the OSRS BGM is in comparison! I was being ironic.

US players already have W330 house hosting which is an incredible perk UK players dont get
---
Wilderness wasn't pvp when minigames were in the wilderness, though. They were moved to the Gamers' Grotto near Falador once pvp was reinstated.
---
It also makes you accountable for your actions. A friend might say he "got lucky" and got some drops but he really just bought them on his main and traded them over. Making it an official gamemode just makes it so you don't have ways to cheat the system
---
That's the best task BTW

Lol i deserve this idk how to screenshot on a Mac
---
oh yeah when is that data going to come out?
---
Lmao it either happens or it doesn’t!
---
Duuuuude. Really should have done the stronghold of security =p
---
Jagex will NEVER ask you for a bank pin. 
---
I always laughed at the stronghold of security, but we would be seeing much less of posts like these if people actually read/did the prompts within the stronghold. Good luck bud, hope you learned a valuable lesson. Rebuild!!!!
---
Cool didn’t know this thanks for the info
---
of course i recognize it, this is a typical saturday night for me
---
Lol. Maybe...
---
3PC Doomsday Screechers just can't see the forest for the trees. If you ignore the game itself entirely and look at it from a business perspective it starts to paint a clearer picture.
---
What is more damaging for the profit viability of OSRS?  
---
1. Doing nothing about these new plugins.
---
2. Blanket ban on all third-party clients.
---
The only correct answer is number 2, and because of that it makes more business sense to work on a different solution in their own time. Even if it took them over a year they would lose less than if they banned them all.
---
Plz don’t

Iron man? If not, sell gold bars (or make them into gold amulets of ironmeme) and cast string jewelry. Its afk and 120k xp an hour

There's multiple mining methods all offering different levels of engagement and you think it's one of the boring skills?

Grind a few hours with a 1 mil/hr moneymaker, or do their dailies (battlestaves, herb runs, hop runs, etc.).
---
I'd be fine with trading since I don't really need low ping for using someone's house
---
I don't think it did
---
Yeah, albeit kinda shady, but rushing IS a form of PvP, and should not be removed. 
---
The tele-delay was a perfect way to "fix" a this problem by allowing the person being rushed a chance to anti-rush and clutch the kill. This isn't an issue that needs a solution, its a legitimate from of PvP.

Except he sold lots of it for bitcoin and other crypto. Jed has been a big crypto trader (read gambler) since I’ve know him

Boo hoo?

Nice nice.
---
You're right, I was dumb and didnt realize you need on at first hit even if they don't attack. Works just a bit wonky
---
You completely read way too into it.
---
He said the new helm is too expensive (25m) and he would stick to serp (4m), so why would I suggest a 30m+ helm? I'm talking budget options since he's trying to justify his 4m helm. 
---
And yeah fair tob but Cox is more gp/hr and still better so very very very niche. Not to mention by how he spoke on it implying the intention of eventually getting it "once th hype dies down" I highly doubt he's using it for this tiny niche use.
---
We all loved them when we were 12 though, remember that? Good times....
---
It doesn't matter what they see and we can't really comment on that since we don't know. For example, some believe that they can detect mouse movement so these would be detectable if that were the case. Either way, the rules of the game aren't "do things legally as far as we can see"; even if it doesn't look like a bot or macro to them, it is still rulebreaking.
---
1:1 doesn't refer to server actions, but player actions; if 1:1 did mean server actions than using AHK to make 1 mouse click perform a macro is still 1:1 as long as it is one server action, which you'd be foolish to argue. The big difference between menu swapper and some of these new plugins is the menu swapper changes menu navigation; it is all the existing options just reordered to reduce clicking. Back during the AHK ban, there were requests for improvements like that but all we got were shift drop. But something like left click prayer is not just a matter of menu navigation; it is a blatant macro. It is not about making the game easier to play but about making the game easier.
---
Thing is, I would have no choice but to quit. I don't have an official client wishlist, it's an official client **hard requirement** list, and there is only 1 RuneLite feature included in that list. Stretched fixed mode and UI scaling. I **can't** play the game without them because of my vision. It's an accessibility improvement, not a feature.
---
Jagex is pretty discriminatory against people with vision impairment though, so I'm not surprised that they've done nothing about it.
---
No need to bring obby armor against those bosses, and honestly without a team you probably cant solo those by yourself right now anyways, unless you trap them which takes a bit of skill. 
---
I would wait or go with some buddies who can guide you.
---
Jed is a dev. He isn’t going to have trouble finding a job. He had a job a month after he left jagex (plus the crypto he has)
---
It would have to get updated pretty damn fast even if just for accessibility reasons. I can't read menus without RuneLite's UI scaling. That isn't included in the vanilla client.
---
Not even close dude.
---

I guess there's a reason they keep these obvious scams up. Sorry bro, but I mean this is just bad internetting. Honestly your best bet is to just restart on a new account, if you rebuild this one it's pretty likely they'll just steal your stuff again.
---
Thx!! took me a long time.
---
They aren't supporting the game. They're burdening it.
---
I read the guy in Edgeville dungeon has a really good rate, went to him last night and finally got a basilisk task.
---
I can't wait to group up with goldfarmers and get ahead.
---
If you find a more recent one let me know. I can’t find one either.
---
Void is good for bossing (Zulrah) that requires quick switches and a good accuracy boost
---
I literally bought a laptop because agility and construction is absolute garbage on mobile

You can go back and pickup any items you had on you.

doesn't that also mean you'l lget like 50 basilisks assigned?
---
Very nice. Please, more of this.

I lost my virginity to Swampletics. I was walking around Canifis for the first time, trying to find the bank. When I looked at the pub, I saw a white haired guy standing at the door, eyeing me seductively. I approached him and we started talking: apparently he was trying to find a rune crossbow, so he was waiting for some of his friends to scout a lucky impling for him.
---
I knew this was my chance. I was nervous and sweating, but I managed to say: "Well that's funny cause I have an impling right here in my pants". A few minutes I was in one of the Canifis pub's upstairs rooms, getting annaly destroyed by Swampletics.
---
because when you get a high slayer level you will have maxed range already, you get ancient shards/totems from barraging dust devils and nechryeals, and you really only want to do tasks which are either high xp/h or boss tasks which are high gp/h.
---
I got two pet drops in one task yesterday. Hope that makes you feel better :)
---
its literally just 2 clicks tho! its waaaaaay more effort to flick than it is to trap or even re-trap 2 or 3 more times.
---
Thank you!
---
Start grinding the cannonballs, do some slayer, join a clan &amp; do some group bossing.
---
swampletics &amp; good, rc &amp; bad, pvp poll &amp; no

Rock hammer agrees
---
Wow this was bad...
---
Lol sorry i wasnt being serious
---
He merches bro
---
That's the main reason Jagex is getting looked at since TH is basically lootbox gambling.
---
However, people brought up "you can buy bonds with IRL money to sell for GP and gamble it at duel arena" so now DA is getting looked at.
---
I completely agree staking is a terrible investment, it’s a high risk high reward (probably higher risk than reward as you pointed out). And I fully agree with a lot of your points but as I said I am quite capable of playing with 5m and making it huge then losing it and not caring simply because it’s a game and I can detach myself from the “need” and just enjoy the buzz of winning. Now the important part is that it’s a game, if it was real money I would never be so nonchalant about losing or betting money. But the main take away is not to gamble money you don’t have and/or can’t afford. Same way I can walk into a casino with €50 win €1m and lose it and be okay, obviously I’d be devastated and I’d never actually get to the point of betting such ridiculously amounts of money to reach €1m but for the hypothetical I wouldn’t “need” the money. I hope that makes sense. And apologies for the efficiency scape/no fun your reply came across as such. I understand how people can attach to gambling but I simply don’t, that probably makes me an outlier going by your reaction and disbelief but so be it.
---
literally brain dead
---
I just started to flic and I get faster kills and I actually found it more chill. Also the first phase goes so fast anyway, but I guess a low def account maybe should trap to save food.

Yes! But as an outsider I still think it would be underwhelming to see it in a video. I think the fascination has to start much earlier... maybe it’s just nostalgia, unfortunately.
---
Isn't the dhcb less dps though?
---
what? you already can though
---
IRONMAN BTW ;)
---
I love this game just as much as ever man, I've always done variety streams so it's nothing new from me, I'm just frustrated lately with all the "issues" the game is facing like most people are.
---
ahhhh true! thnx.
---
Oh.. duh. Thank you so much!
---
I found it thanks! It was under status bars, I’ve just never been able to find it.
---
Those two statements don’t contradict though. You only have one life *as HCIM*, your next life will be as a normal iron ;-)
---
2 day old account made specifically to be a doomer cry baby about OSRS. Nice.

what stats do u recomend for that, thank you also
---
OP is true to their name
---
Jokes on them, I can somehow carry 10,000 cannonballs on me wherever I go!
---
Kodai tho. .1% of them have even risked a sotd.
---
This is in stark contrast to the dude who has 40k kc and not a single pet.
---
Well considering ss hits higher/same since u can str mode over atk mode, its not good. Bludgeon is also straight up better 70-74 atk.
---
Jagex is the accuser.
---
Jagex should just buy runelite and make it the official client but take out OP plug ins
---
Looks lovely, great job!
---
Yeah his other one (googooglia??) hasnt died, but he did something where he locked that account to content only released on real 2007scape. The iron man that died in this clip was a new one he made recently with no restrictions, and he was following some kind of efficiency guide made by someone else.
---
If its purely for an alt money maker on the side...
---
Cannonballs. The most relaxing afkable account in my opinion. Only around 200k profit an hour but takes like an hour to get the reqs and very little investment needed.
---
My problem with WC and Fishing is they take longer to get the stats to make it decent and they're not that much better than cannonballs.
---
Slayer is always a popular choice. Lots of options. Gargoyles, wyverns, etc. Could take a month or more to get the Slayer level depending on your play time but gives you better options in the long run.
---
I've got an alt acc with decent slayer, WC, fishing, etc. And I just cycle between different afk stuff depending on how AFK I want it to be.
---
For example, cannonballs are like 3 minutes AFK per inv so I'll do that when I'm doing something click intensive on the main.
---
WC yews and fishing monks are similar but yews at the WC guild are easier to bank. You can just deposit all. With monks if you deposit all, you'll bank your net if you don't use bank fillers and it's a small but annoying difference.
---
PVM is middle of the road. Semi-afk. Normally I'll kill gargoyles or something when I'm doing something on the main where there's down time here and there like rcing blood runes

Its op for pvp and shit for pvm. Ur balance idea doesnt solve the pvp problem and the last one only makes it worse. 
---
Dfs and crystal shield were designed to tank. Literally every shield almost. Yet those two have half the bonus.
---
Not really. An infernal cape is impressive because it requires skills. So does raid items. Completing a clue is absolutely not skillful. Gettig 3rd age is pure dumb luck. And that is absolutely not true of every good item. Logic is hard.
---
What stats exactly or want me to name them all
---
Ahh I see. They kinda seem like the perfect task to get frequently. So afk and simple with drops that will always be useful and in need especially for ironmen.
---
AFAIK these are his HCIMs:

+5 mining boost would be more appropriate
---
I'd say the "big content creators" branching out or seeming less interested is more to due with a progression of time than the state of the game. Most can't play solely one game as a career for 5+ years and those that do focus on just one game are likely to undergo a change in style over time. But where older creators may focus less, move on, or lose interest, newer creators will emerge and in time rise to be on par or take their place if needed. While not too terribly much has changed with the older creators, there has been a pretty big boom of newer creators over the last year or so. So I wouldn't say it is fair to judge the state of the game by looking at old creators while ignoring the new ones.
---
As for the other criticisms, some are them do hold some weight. From what I've seen, it seems more like the game is going through a post-mobile dropoff. Mobile caused a huge spike in players, peaking in Jan, before most of the new players started to fall off. So while the downward line does look bad, we still have a higher player count than pre-Mobile. The other things that are likely causing so much unrest is Warding and WoW. Since Warding failed, there are likely some players in favor who lost interest afterward and it also left the last half of this year uncertain since we didn't have a big update upcoming. And with other games like WoW Classic, it gave many players more alternatives than there were in the past. So without a big upcoming update and with more rivaling games, it likely led to more critical examination of the game and complaints about things, which certainly doesn't help the atmosphere any.
---
So yah, probably way more detail than needed, but I'd say the game is currently in more of a transitional period than a decline. The future isn't bleak, just more uncertain as we wait for the direction of updates among other things like rulings. But you could have said the same in the past too with similar problems like AFK Training or such yet things turned around.
---
It's almost impossible. It's one of those situations where if you can't beat em, join em, right? That's why Jagex gave up on bot busting and now they impose a tax on gold sales, a tiny little transaction fee. A microtransaction. That's all bonds are, just a bribe we pay Jagex to sanction our rwting.
---
Man, back in my day, Jagex fought for the players by enforcing rwt rules so botters couldn't flood the market with gold and fuck our economy. Now Jamflex is wetting their beak in it. They're just shaking us down against the threat of getting banned.

I'm in the same boat as this person. Have about 350kc on my pure and consistently 3 kills, often 4, and a rare 5. I'm at like 6 way +Dbow instead of 8's, but still.

I mean in alot of instances they are actually spot on. You run away... only to come back and kill more.

---
Well look, it's unfair to ask me to come up with a solution to completely end rwt, which is effectively a perpetual arms race against botters, and then tell me I'm overly optimistic. I feel like the goalpost just moved. 
---
I was there for trade caps. It was absolute horse shit. I had a reasonably strong account and even at my level I was getting slapped with daily limits. Forget about helping out your low level alts. I remember; it was a bad solution. We can learn from that lesson. We can do better.
---
Even if we set our sights on a more achievable goal of just diminishing rwt, we need to reconceptualize bonds as the blight they are. Jagex shouldn't have a monetary incentive to disregard their obligation to bust bots. What we should demand is a change in corporate governance, such that bond revenues are directly reinvested into supporting a 24/7 bot busting team. Why are they posting higher profit margins instead of hiring more moderation staff? I would say it's because they're getting a kickback from rwt, a financial incentive not to care. We should harness our outrage to pressure Jagex into more transparent investment practices, but step one is for you, me, and the rest of osrs to agree that bonds are outrageous.

Ahh thanks boss

That's what I figured, ah well. Thanks for the reply.

---
I mean *techincally* yes as proven by Chriskies and others who can do Inferno at lvl 50ish.  However, using these insane accomplishments to justify that reasoning is pretty dumb.  You cant take the absolute best and biggest outliers and use it to make generalized comments.  Gear is just as important for the *average* player as stats and skill since their skills arent at the same level of streamers and "professionals".   And these YT guides are catered towards casuals not someone like Chriskies.
---
Edit: 
---
 &gt;He isn't talking about these kinds of achievements
---
He is literally posting his comment on a thread about "these kinds of achievements".  He is using it as an example for his argument.
---
Keep grinding brother.  This will make the eventual payoff more sweet
---
The search rate was higher because the game was still new at that point genius. The actual playerbase was much higher in 2011 than 2007.

You're luckier then me. Killed 1k on the day of the update but no jaw, unfortunately.

Your best way to earn money right now is to not do it. 
---
Level your stats, play the game.
---
Yeh it was a bit too vague and only one question on a poll that varying is a bit too little but a great start.
---
I voted no to looting bag and rune pouch thing purely because I think it can be implemented better than having duplicate containers like master scroll books. Just have "tattered" bags / pouches that are simply repaired by left clicking them and you can only have one repaired one at once.

Congrats man, I'm working on 1500 total myself.
---
Back in the days you could milk noobs in the wildy, because it's a better build for pking compared to random stats like 67/69/64 so you'd get an insane advantage (back when people like Kids Ranqe used to pk). Since 67 attack is 7 useless attack levels worth of cb, and 64 def doesn't do too much compared to having insane str/range/mage with ancients and msb. You can optimize your stats for pking and dealing as much damage as possible at the lowest level possible.
---
Nowadays, you don't really get to milk noobs, you just fight other pures and zerks, so it's mainly for fun or preference. You hit high, and if you're fighting other pures, the fights are super fast paced. Vs main where you hit a lot of 0s and the fights are a lot slower.

u can check his clips or something but 1026k stack of sweets
---
Nope I believe it's faster kills on average. I personally haven't tested it im just going off high level pvm discord guides.
---
Seems like a generic error message for server unable to load essentially.
---
Thanks! Good luck :D
---
So wait, your item wasn’t selling for the price you thought it would, so you tried to rip someone off. Got ripped off yourself and your complaining about it?
---
Bahahahaha
---
Thanks :D

Tob is my favorite content in osrs but scythe being at 600m makes me not want to log in anymore
---
They weren't a part of the game originally though. They were added due to the usefulness and design behind 3rd party menu entry swappers, and also because of the requirement to mousekey your inventory to drop etc. 
---
The construction plugin is a dynamic menu entry swapper same as blackjacking. It adjusts on the fly so that you can continue to spam click. That's more macro territory. It doesn't even remove mousekeying etc, Jagex already did that by not patching no mouse movement construction, and by allowing the keyboard to select the build option and navigate dialogue.
---
Improvements were already made for that skill, people just want to macro it. And I'm tired of hearing well designed QoL like menu entry swapping is comparable to dynamic menu changes or outright macros
---
Hackers... in rs, you’re a clown bro
---
Damn, beat me. I got it in 135 KC on my ult with repeat rings though. D axe 600 dry but not technically a rex drop.
---
I'm guessing under 1m by november
---
what world was that? it was probably me
---
lol dude 400 burning amulets, that's like 2m or so? are you seriously quitting over that lmao. i can reimburse you the money if you want, that's pretty sad that anyone would even waste their time scamming such an amount of money.
---
went on a cruise after the delayed q&amp;a statement, came back and still no statement. interesting
---
Quest
---
J1mmy we talked about this, its not a pk video with out rap and or NIN blaring in the back ground.  That's the only way to take your pking to the next level.
---
ive got a question for LMS/bridding in general:  
---
As my opponent changes from ranged to magic, should i focus on getting the right overhead prayer asap, or focus on equipping mystic which has more magic defence than the black d'hide body and rune legs and then change my prayer? :)
---
Theres some Strauss in the clip of him talking about group ironman. I love the idea of someone streaming osrs to classical music
---
burning amulets go for like 7k each depending on the time lmao (yes they sell)
---
Yeh mb idk why I said 15 feel like I read it in your comment but it was late.
---
Watch woox's guide it has all the tricks. I've got a 1:43 record with blowpipe and my kills always sit around the 2 min range, slower ones at like 2:10-2:15 and good ones at like 1:50-1:55, obviously with outliers.
---
The key is to one step trick the lightning, never miss attacks, and to "woox walk" the fire attack. Ideally you wanna skip the fire phase or as much of it as possible. Use specs when he is weakened in red form as your blowpipe spec is more accurate, and also a way to sustain for longer trips. 
---
Other than that yeh it's just about moving between vents efficiently without stopping attacking.
---
Like others have said, it keeps their combat level low while letting them hit almost as much as an account that does have defence.
---
I, personally, have a near maxed pure and do not train defence for different reasons as well. I think having basically no armour adds a challenge to the game that I’ve been seeking since like literally 12 years ago. I like bossing, etc on main, but it’s more fun on my pure because I have to adapt. Sure, I’m not entirely efficient, I have a life though.
---

yeah, sometimes the blowpipe even with rigour will streak some big 0's

&gt; someone being generous
---
lol you have to play this game with the mindset that everyone is out to scam you.
---
Any way I can screenshot a region and save it all with one click? I know on Mac you can (cmd shift 3  4 5 do different types) but they best I can find natively on windows is the snipping tool.
---
Pretty much exact same boat. I don't think id quit cold turkey (mainly cos I have 3 month membership buys so wouldn't wanna waste them) but id be playing less and less until I did quit, cos I just couldn't enjoy the game in a normal way without seriously altering my play experience to make it possible.

Clan wars was shit. The real wars that were fun happened in deep wilderness from Spiders to greater demons in F2P worlds. It was extremely organized with 100's of people in respective Team Speak's with lead callers poppin off. The wars could range from 6-14  hours. It was a fucking battle. After wildy and free trade was removed we got this sad of an excuse mode for warring that felt lame. I miss the old clan warring scene though that was high energy rs.

And as I replied to that other comment (and then replied with a scientific paper as evidence, because he asked for it) even just spanking kids, not any other worse types of physical abuse, has been shown to have massively detrimental effects on the kids both immediately and later in life. And it also makes kids *less likely* to do as their told in the immediate future.
---
&gt; log into their account to drop all their items.
---
And mate, definitely just log into their account and RWT the items, or just RWT the whole account may as well make some of that money back.
---
This as well as my Sgs looool
---
? Figure its more of my demographic doing this. Im 28. Full time job i commute to. Havent played since i was a kid, but ngl if i ever did i would just use my income for this. No one who works full time and is an adult has time to grind out everything they want. Where there is a market there will be sellers. Rather spend money for the hours i already worked on the game then double up. No one wants to hear it up it's the truth. I just enjoy the community content and dont play anymore, but i get itn
---
How? It's a separate mode... You arent playing as a regular ironman. You are playing as a group. It changes literally nothing about the other modes..

---
Fair enough mate GL on the grind :)
---
I don't think it will go down that fast as it is bis, but  we don't know the drop rates for sure. If it is only 1/512 on task then it will really depend on the weight of a bassalisk task from Duradaddy and Nieve since that is where most of them will enter the game (after the initial hype).
---
Some of the minigames test for potion use. They don't like it if you use anything that changes your stats.
---
Some potions are normally allowed and some potions are usually banned. 
---
Level up your stats normally, don't use stat boosters unless you have to.
---
You got a good belly laugh outta me.
---
do you mean the intermediate boat? and you really dont need void for much early on no real reason to rush it.
---
&gt; i dont count it as legit death
---
he probably already was 2 def but lied to you
---
Wikipedia has some well written stuff on a lot of the topics, but you have to grind a lot of it out.
---
It helps if you have someone to help you out. Like a father or a friend. Don't try ironman mode, it's pointless.
---
I mean, a lot of people watch streamers regarding the game they're playing. He's super likeable and entertaining, theres a reason hes the #1 osrs streamer.

Good thing it doesn’t matter what you think

you get 2 F's 1 for being a racist and another for failing the assumption

Swiftkit is nothing like the third party clients we have now. It didn't give any advantages that you couldn't already get through the web browser (skill calculators, highscores etc.). Jagex also forced swiftswitch to remove their world switching feature which was the only real advantage the client had.
---
alot of dutch people use them alot of the youth

You’re one to talk LOL

pickpocket the guys near tower of life
---
I appreciate everybody's more serious/impressive series, but your humorous one-off videos are becoming the cream of the crop for me. I've watched Trolling the Swampman about 10 times, love this kind of nonsense.
---
lmfao you guys that depend on 3rd party clients are fucking hilarious.
---
I have only ever used the official client.
---
I did mine legit but yeah I know :(
---
What an awful play &gt;\_&gt;

**Chance to get 4+ good items in 15 kc:**
---
    Σ(from i=4 to 15) ((15 choose i) * (1/128)^i * (1-(1/128))^(15−i)) ≃ 0.00000475 or 0.000475%

**Chance to get 1+ pet in 15 kc:**
---
    Σ(from i=1 to 15) ((15 choose i) * (1/5000)^i * (1-(1/5000))^(15−i)) ≃ 0.003 or 0.3%

**Combined:**

    0.003 * 0.00000475 ≃ 0.000000014
---
You're literally 1 in 100,000,000.
---
Nowadays you have 1 hour to pick up your stuff and it just disappears. Only place you can be looted is the wildy.
---
It’s because people we’re ddos’ing the servers just for the lulz and a lot of people were losing a ton of stuff to disconnect deaths
---
Yeah you clearly dont actually play the game, because you have no idea why the current death mechanic was implemented. Neet.
