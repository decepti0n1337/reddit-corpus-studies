Oh well I switched to mime and scarf on my own then
---
---
---
+1 I also experience this issue
---
Bruh this was 75 days ago
---
Nope!
---
Nice
---
Tired asf probably 
---
I should read more. Maybe I’ll start a new book tonight. Thanks for the advice.
---
Sick! Now go for that master completion ;)
---
i've been playing since before the falador massacre.
---

---
its still funny to see people complaining about these bugs that don't actually effect their accounts.
---
You need rune defender to enter the basement, so if you dropped that you prob wouldn’t be able to enter
---
No it’s 24 hours of gameplay, or 7 quest points.
---
Look for more of that guy on youtube, there are better bits than this one lol.
---
The problem with that is that unless it's Ironman mode, you could just use an alt or a clan to collect supplies and then trade them all to one account to be super stacked for the final. 
---
I have a feeling that all of this effort might end up going to waste, but I appreciate what you're doing. And if it does end up being as revolutionary as you say, then good for you. Gl with it.
---
One thing at the end is when you say that protecting mage will decrease the chance of getting frozen. This is not true, as you stated at the beginning that prot prays do not impact the accuracy of an attack. Therefore, the chances of being frozen are the same with or without prot mage on and only depend on your defence and magic defence. The exception is that entangles halve the amount of time you're frozen for.
---
Best content I've seen in a while here. Love the artstyle! I'll always upvote Drake &amp; Josh.
---
In its current state.
---
A state that had not seen an update in, what, 13 years?
---
I never actually painted any humans or animals, honestly I was to afraid to fuck it up lol
---
Yes sir, verf means paint :D
---
I was still able to enter without my rune defender :)
---
i mean he's kinda right. I appreciate jagex and everything they do, but they should care more about fixing current issues than Hype up new content, which is not really necessary for the time being as there's an insane amount of content already. 
---
Damn nature, you scary
---
This.

Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything
---
 - Not short, but a really great book written superbly.
---
 - A great level of information about the history of almost everything.
---
- Sprinkled with humour throughout.
---
One suggestion, I have plenty more 😜
---
Oh boy, Runescape capture the flag, so exciting!
---
No, what is there to notice? Looks fine to me.
---
Castlewars but also a King of the Hill version.
---
Hold and maintain the middle island. 
---
I'm still upset we got the q part wrong. It's meant to be one pixel shorter than the p side. Some people were trying to fix it but others kept making it symmetrical.
---
Are you me
---
Only mining and fishing mate
---
Specific activities? No, it's actually quite useful for a lot of things. There is an inherent benefit to using it any time you are going to be carrying or running around. There is no debating that. That is objectively true. 
---
Regardless of whether you want to acknowledge that or not, it is used widely and seen constantly, which would definitely go against this notion that it's only good for "specific activities." 
---
I like his travelogues even more

I mean he doesn’t work there anymore

Charles had such a great race today, sucks what happened. Cant wait for China!
---
Eh the lid looking part is too far foward, took me a minute to see the toilet 
---
Or also competitive clanning. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Should only take 10 minutes tops
---
Why? Capture the flag has been a mainstay in competitive MLG across many games and platforms. Imagine if Jagex dedicated dev time to remaking CW with team based eSport competition in mind. 
---
Look at the size of that one... wow... those things'll tear ya to shreds...
---
&gt; I think it looks cooler than rcb or blowpipe. 
---
imagine looking at your screen training slayer and not just afking it lol
---
It's left without one so that it can bake that sweet potato. You can game AND have a snack afterwards.
---
I love it.

Smh doing barrows south up

"Men only wants one thing and it's literally disgusting"

At this point it looks like they jeopardized the integrity of the finals even more, by buffing the 94 base stats, and giving items people didn't have. At this point it looks like it was only a handful of people who made it from falador that didn't get spawned in fog, but everyone who died to fog did not get respawned. No one that died to fog got respawned.
---
Are you on mobile or PC?
---
It would be cool to have a fishing pole quest reward that allows you to toggle this option, and maybe gives +fishing lvls
---
$11
---
That's why I mine tin and copper. I'm doing the lords work I am
---
A droptable when killing other players will lead to bots stacking up and getting ice barraged by a main to farm drops.

Otherwise cool ideas

Interesting, was this always the case? Could have sworn it used to not be a thing.

Holy fuck, I can't breathe. I'm dead.

Why isn’t this added to the official client? Brilliant idea
---
I'm not sure how to reply to you anymore. I feel like I'm being trolled. I *just* gave you a mathematical breakdown of why it would still be considered a "minimal bonus" because we're not changing the percentage here. Just the discrimination against runite and amethyst ores. I also clearly stated that I'm not interested in comparing capes against one another because it's an apples and oranges comparison AND I'm pretty sure Jagex didn't create the capes by comparing them against one another and standardizing their perks across any kind of common platform.
---
for real. Mining and smithing might as well be dead content outside of quest and diary requirements
---
You can cancel the subscription via the app store you got it from (Play Store on Android, or App Store on iOS); not from the RS account site.
---
I don't remember the exact areas the subscription cancellation option was under though on either platform.

Cool but y tho lmao

Too many people jumped on it getting slayer tasks :(

umm swampletics didnt start the region only lock ironmans craze bud

Same except for the very last space which was one to the left lol

Only took one attempt! Clue juggled! But it required me drawing 7 clues from dragon implings that I was able to complete!
---
Nah!
---
Wonderful
---
no, were not all dicks with hats.

Yeah that's fair. I remember some drama around one of the 1 at a time accs, turns out it was the pet guy.
---
No shit.
---
But Ian spoke for 95% of the air time.

Revan and Ayiza might as well have been in the audience with how often they got spoken over or never got a chance to speak.

And you think posting this on here would help? lmao wtf

Abdullah was one of the people that they weren't able to recover from Fally.

I don't see the issue, graceful outfit makes it obvious whom to avoid.
---
AHK is AutoHotKey, used to make scripts. Ex. Pressing "1" and switching 3 items pressing alt 4 and casting barrage. The people claiming the guy was using AHK but anyone who can PK at that level can 4 way barrage it's not hard with muscle memory.
---
Years ago except iirc none of the rewards on it passed so they ended up not doing it 
---
ESPORTS READY. 
---
If you did this kind of a play-by-play for every tournament, you could write a book on Jagex fuck ups! Its unbelievable how things go terribly wrong, time and time again...

Send the Wise Old man over. He's good with bank problems.

My theory is this is all going to come out as a massive weird April fools prank tomorrow
---
I appreciate where ya coming from! But I think this guy isn’t so much challenging the limits himself or an account, more challenging the game itself to see what is possible with loopholes being used. I think it’s fascinating what can be accomplished!
---
How to you plan to buy all of that for 28m?
---
I don't have any tele's, so travel time would be a lot longer.
---
why are there no new Quests for free players? Thought they would add a few since 2007.
---
*A Great Artist has been born in the city of /r/2007scape!*
---
My comment was inferring that in my opinion there is nothing worth spending that 28m on currently more than saving it up for Rigour.
---

Nice.

Run energy uncensored. Hack incoming. Grats tho, gotta love it!

This is fucking awesome.  I was just scrolling through the top posts, not even reading the titles and I was surprised with this!  Would love to see other paintings!

Great, now trade it to me I'll try to double it for you.

When I first started all I did was blast furnace- if you get to making runite bars it's pretty good money and exp! Having high smithing is also nice for some achievement diaries later in the game.

Yes? Guthans to heal and avas for ranging prime. It's not worth bringing a cape switch.
---
&gt; viable, long-term esport
---
listen. Runescape isn't going to become a fucking esport. They need to drop it all together
---
The reason why it gets pushed so much is because 99% of the competitive community is built of like 20 odd people who will literally give their left nuts to make $20k sitting at home doing fuck all since they each have like 10k+ tickets each that do nothing but log in and play the same thing every day. They literally go and buy upvotes to get this recognized so they can get their money.
---
You know for a fact that literally NOBODY would be able to win vs them because they play so fucking much its the easiest money of their lives
---
It's not super easy but the max hit is 31 so you shouldn't have to worry about getting one shot. Relatively "safe" I'd say. Certainly safer than any gwd boss/wildy boss.
---
Ohh so you are on lunars and in the clan chat “love you all”, gf thanks for the account bro.
---
It's April Fools
---
Sure, I love *Adventure Quest*
---
you don't need to keep the clues with a finished step, but you can't pick up unfinished clues once you get logged (they won't appear i think). 
---
So yes, you have to get/do all but 1 of the steps in 6 hrs
---
That's RNG for ya
---
No prayer reduces so much skill tho
---
Is there a meta for construction I'm missing? I use the royal seed pod and house tabs to run materials. I'm definitely not getting optimal XP/hour but it works fine for me. 
---
Thanks m8
---
Those are some interesting Google searches you have there...
---
Well duh, the 5 second rule is way past already, since you can't pick up other peoples stuff immediately
---
I would get DHCB first. Rigour is great, but DHCB will make a lot more difference. 
---
Thats because its not optimized or balanced atm. Its basically just a 50v50 shitshow. Maybe if they limited it to 5v5 or 8v8 or something, and put a max total level for the team so it wasnt just all maxed accounts it might be more interesting. I’m pretty much just spit balling though. Im sure theres ways to make it work. Its a CTF gamemode on a fun game it can definitely be entertaining if done right.
---
No... Because a naked man weighs 0kg and a man with a cannon does not.  Weight below 0kg doesn't effect anything.
---
i can literally hit 1m gp in 1 day at wintertodt as a lvl 3

master has quite a few steps that require combat skills, elite only has coordinates and some emotes.

damn it that would have been easier than adding almost every cheap seed to ignored items.

Died there earlier today, trying to do it for my first time.

I'll never go back. Those ghosts are bullshit.

...right?

platebody is 1/2k so even crazier

One of the cringier parts of reddit history 
---
But I'm sure more people would agree that Castle Wars has the potential to be better for esports than DMM. Especially when there's only been like 1 (or 2?) DMM tourny(s) where nothing has went wrong. It would be pretty hard to screw up a castle wars tournament (at least I'd hope so)

Are they a scam aswell? I cant even tell anymore

I don't see how that accusation even makes sense when my issue is an observable one. It was never about how good or bad the outfit actually is, even though I do think its prevalence speaks to it being something that people *clearly* see as being beneficial, it is about how homogenized and boring it's made the world seem.

yeah it looks like a hobo took a puke on you and missed the cape

He's my fellow Slovenian, I was rooting for him a few tournys ago when I played seasonals as well as finals, but I had a bad opinion about him shortly after, since I didn't find him to be sincere at all. Nowadays I only watch his dmm finals yt videos and I get the same feeling again. On top of that he said he likes to play alone and then in the next video he said it wouldnt be possible to have everything he has before the final hour if it wasnt for donations of his friends...
---
Thanks captain.

mole can be like 750k/hr

No such things as “spots” it’s an mmo

And that's a very sorry state for the subreddit. These posts are by far the best part of the subreddit
---
Well firstly, then you'd have to alch the platebodies or lose tons of money with the gold bars which might not be ideal and secondly not everyone plays efficiently or inefficiently 100% of the time. I, for example, do low intensity, low efficiency stuff when I have to study or get chores done and etc and then do some high efficiency, high intensity stuff when I'm 100% focused on playing during my actual leisure time.
---
Only reason I care about an upvote is to increase the chance they get a chance in the game by Jagex seeing the post. I’ll repost because the person who put the work in to make this design killed it and it’s a great idea.

Nigga please, these recolours are awesome and worth adding by themselves. There are already 3 maging God capes that match them, which is excuse enough to add them. And no, you don't need to add counterparts for Melee and Ranged because not everything has to be mirrored. Don't worry, Melee and Range won't be jealous because they're not people, with feelings. And one could even argue that they're already mirrored (for example, with the blessed d'hides).

Seriously, OP got Bono jealous in Africa with how thick his rose-tinted glasses are. Stop retroactively applying rules to a game mode that is hard enough by default - especially complaining about thing like the looting bag, which existed *before UIM was conceived.*

The comment just "I raped her back when the servers went down in 2007". In the replies he goes on about how "you don't know the things I've done" and went on to issue a challenge to a 1v1 in the wildy and stating how he's been "cleaning up egos since 2000 and fucking 4". Just an actual brainlet.

Wonder if Ash knew before hand that certain events were rushed due to being introduced late, etc...  Feels bad because he seems like the type of dude that doesn't want to call out other employees ever, yet as a lead developer he has to deal with the brundt of the criticism.
---
I see we’re still beating this meme to death 
---
Think of all the former players! All those people get wind there’s a shiny new, well balanced of course, competitive castle wars tourney! I bet a lot of them would come back to watch, and some of them might even buy memebership lol. 
---
Also why isn’t there something like gamebattles for PKing? I’m not to familiar with the PKing scene, but that seems like a good step. You could have some sore of ladder system during a set season. Top players or teams from the season move into a bracket tourney and they stream that.

Kots is definitely not for the average joe. Also deadman is great for viewers. KOTS isn't

What's up scapers it's ya boi suave_squirrel here for another joke explanation! So buckle in because this one gets spicier than a fresh kebab!
---
OP has posted the game log recording of several coal drops. Remember this as it is absolutely crucial to understanding the inner mechanisms of the joke!
---
Our jester here must've reached an epiphany; coal and cool are homophones! That sets the stage for a play-on-words.
---
He takes the stand, winds for the pitch, and throws us the curveball of the century! Instead of saying the drops are "cool", his switches it up with "coal". As the drops are, in fact, coal.

Haha alright scapers I'll catch you guys next week! Suave_squirrel signing off!

Sure she has that in her bio, but you need to realize banging girls is a skill like all things in life. Skills need to be developed. Time spent is time gaining proficiency. It's kinda like my girlfriend. I mean, I dont have some monster Somalian dick or anything, but I can make her spray the ceiling on command (well, not quite "on command" cuz there's things u need to do) and that came from years of experience. They say the left can't meme, well, the right can't fuck and thats just the way it is. Practice makes perfect, kiddos.

Yeah dude, watching 5 days of grinding which leads up to the epic finale of clanman mode is much better.

Don’t quit man! I know it must feel really shitty, but you didn’t lose much, trust me. Keep playin and get ur stats up more so you can do better money making methods and you’ll see a 15M loss is nothin.
---
What really sells this the most to me is the bot with default colours/customization in the rat king of a player blob.
---
Fire only 100gp!
---
How come yew long and short bows are profitable to fletch? The logs are easy to get and useful to train Fletching and firemaking. Bowstrings are annoying to get but at least drop often from monsters.
---
Then you get a huge supply of bows. Way more than people need to but. They have a negative high alch margin.
---
So how come these bows are profitable to make? 
---
No kidding, I could buy 13 law runes with that money!
---
We pay we grey. 
---
I was there today doing the samw thing, no d chain but i did get a heart drop from a choke devil,
---
Bank just doubled :)
---
Prequel memes had a TON as well though
---
Didnt lowlander get his main to tank bandos for him 
---
Well Ash, you see, if you actually test the shit before you roll it out live you don't have to hope as much.
---
His brother was skulled and got pkd
---
They really pay that low?
---
Who are you? 
---
thank you
---
Just ordered one off etsy!!
---
Someone is actually paying money so other people don't lose their account. What a lad
---
I’ve been smelting a lot as Edgeville lately and a lot of people seem to be doing the smelting animation sometimes as far back as the bank before they hit the furnace.
---
Is this a visual bug or am I missing out on some way to start smelting before I hit the furnace?
---
Fuck I love this! I love Drake and Josh was my shit!
---
This is amazing lol good job
---
If you want a diy account, just play ironman mode... 
---
How does that work?
---
But it is working as one, aside from Jagex's technical/management issues.  Those aren't mechanical/design issues, though.
---
As someone who hates the "don't go in the wildy if you don't wanna get pk'ed" argument, this game mode isn't is actually something you should only be playing if you're prepare to get attacked. PvP is kinda the main focus of DMM after all.
---
@alphoxis is the reason you and some of your friends had his stream open before he was live because u guys were fans of mika or for som otjer reason? 
---
I love this, such a cool depiction 
---
Called Africa/Middle East mate.
---
Stage players are getting paid an appearance fee almost as good as the winners prize, so they are slightly less frustrated than people think. But still annoying to get screwed like that.
---
Still has the DMM problem of really only being accessible to clans, though. At least in DMM individual skill can shine, while Castle Wars would be pretty much clan-centric which I personally find exceptionally boring to watch. Not saying there's no skill involved in clan setups, but it's far less interesting to me.
---
If anything Jagex did Torvesta a favour this time 
---
Thanks for buying all d imps. Keep up your good job!
---
No one cares 
---
You clicked setup auto chat, type whatever you want, press enter. 
---
Doesnt matter. Hes using ahk.
---
I didn't know boaty and Jack black were friends. 
---
Ditter Bitter was the only one that won in this tournament
---
Holy shit, Drake and Josh combined with RuneScape in a legitimately funny way?
---
Shit, good job OP.

---
They don't use the in game autochat feature though. You can hide that. They are using a 3rd party auto typer to bypass the RS filter so that you have to put them on your ignore list to hide their spam.

In this community Ash deals with the least criticism by far. If anything goes wrong people just assume it’s the devs they don’t like as much messing it up - people worship Ash to a stupid degree.
---
Why Drake pregante
---
Bai?
---
"just cheat bro" fuck off yea? 
---
clean more profitable herbs

You cannot per jagex.

I'll add something of value. It sucks how it went down especially for ash. But they should scrap this bullshit by now and be done.

Nice, my rng is crap so I bought one before I killed my first Hespori. 5 kc and and just a bunch of kronos seeds and 5k&gt; seed drops. 
---
Thank you!
---
There was a Wiley pic a while ago and it had all sorts of memes inside it. Like background trees were crabs, minimap orbs were changed to $11 , etc. can’t remember exactly but that man did a wonderful job, it was a quality meme 
---
Haha thanks man!
---
The thing that irks me is that, iirc, JMods have said that individual reports don't do anything, they just help form heat maps of areas that have higher quantities of rule breaking(in this case, bots). Since bots have and still are heavily prevalent in the GE, Jagex knows there is an insanely high concentration of bots there already, so the individual report means very little. I'm not trying to discourage reporting, and I might be misinformed, it's a just some insight as to how reports are actually handled by Jagex. 
---
He sworn off future events, but this was the last event he was contracted for. I'm sure given the opportunity he would do another. 
---
In the settings
---
Its a 1/35 so kinda eh
---
That’s a long time out.

Pk on hcim hype

If only we had some type of player moderation system that could deal with these spam bots.

Sounds like you were role playing

Isn't that the kinda same thing as ghost mousing?

It this were allowed I could get people to pay me as I mash a button all day and alch 100+ accounts to 99 mage simultaneously 
---
If it helps I once got 2x Dragon thrownaxes, 1x Dragon Sword and 1x Dragon Harpoon on a Wyrm task. That's 4 1/2k drops.
---
Then again I've gotten 3 barrows items in 80 kills.
---
Keep em coming

got 2 bp, serp, onyx, 2 pets in the same kc. want a magic fang now.. lol

Awesome!! Where is episode 25??
---
I just wanted to pull a joke and went way too far with it and I feel bad for it. I'll explain it in a video later today.
---
I wonder how long it will be before you regret asking
---
Sell prints of these.
---
The reason is that getting stats and doing mid lvl content is mainly just grinding and buying the best gear. High lvl content is where actual skill is required (alongside the stats and gear). Things like prayer flicking, woox-walking, switching gear/prayers, and learning the mechanics, are what make high end content possible. 
---
It is possible to do these things with skill, but without good gear and good stats.
---
It is not possible to do these things without skill, but with good gear and good stats.
---
Skill is what separates mid and high end content. Skill is simply a matter of practise.
---
Protip: If you want to AFK a bit, you can farm noxifer in raids (there's a patch to rake seeds at the end of the first floor) for reasonable xp. At 99 it's around 60k/h from testing on tourney worlds if you replant right when the patch is cleared.
---
You're a fucking noob, Brandon.
---
&gt;my free trial ends tomorrow
---
How. Genuinely. I made an ironmeme yesterday and tried to get the free Twitch Prime thing. After wasting 20 minutes getting everything sorted, the Runescape page tells me the trial has ended.

I got got myself..

The time has come and so have I
---
You have to respect the hustle 
---
Amen.

---
I agree with you, I went too far. If I could go back in time I would change the way I approached the situation. I wanted to pull a joke and it didn't work as intended at all.
---
awesome glad to hear it, seems like a no brainer :)
---
I still don't have a clue how it works, it just looks like I've said from what I've seen.
---
Reports doesn't feel like they work because the system requires solid evidence and that takes time for the bot to bot. But I would say yes, accounts flagged by people who don't use the report system wrongly are probably looked into with priority. Otherwise the pmod tool to give nickname lists wouldn't be there.
---
It seems to rely a lot on manual checking as well, mod wealth changed position and they're training new staf for anti-macro role and shit is hitting the fan atm. Look g.e. tracker for bow strings, look at the volume, around x7, from yearly averages of 135gp the item is now 45gp each lol
---
I think you're missing the point. It doesn't matter how many clans did x, and the idea that both sides or all sides did it doesn't make it acceptable. Hell, I'd argue nobody's even mad at fools for taking advantage of the situation. We're mad about Jagex allowing the situation to happen, and using what Fools did as an example of how the incompetence was abused. 
---
Nope
---
What solution are you looking for?  You got hacked and need to secure your information.  Check to see if you were a victim of a data leak, clicked on phishing links, or downloaded something sketchy.
---
Id love to see the community managers do the reset. Then everyone finds out that anyone who was in the tourney, not just the ones that died, gets reset to 94 stats and some basic bitch gear. . .  On their main accounts. 
---
DMM was by far their biggest joke.
---
Googled it, looks awful imo. Looks like guady RS3 high fantasy wacky armor to me. Ancestral is actual robes while Virtus looks way too cluttered and random. Too many details on it.
---
Weath.. WEATH!!!!!
---
Nice try april fools
---
yup got that same path too haha
---
I just want to say that this video is 10/10 in terms of editing, sound effects, music, humour, lenght. I rewatched this video part of tunnels 5 times, where the Chestbrah did some humorous laid back guy fails.. Never have I rewatched a series video multiple times, but this one is so chill with the music...
---
Why does Jagex insist on humiliating themselves with these tournaments? The game mode is absolute shit! And they even want it to be an esport.. UNBELIEVABLE.
---
This is actually making me lose hope for the future of OSRS as a whole. 
---
Wonder what set off this goddamn trainwreck?
---
a painting of her staring at a blank wall.
---
Sure. The casters stated it about 20/15 mins before the fights resumed
---
I mean if they actually had the thought to backup the accounts at crucial times, the janitor could probably do it.
---
That’s a real money feature, no way would they have it cost marks of grace. 
---

This is what annoys me the most about Micka. He really doesn't know shit about DMM or pking, he just grinds like 18 hours a day during the DMM and complains about everything that doesn't benefit him. He died @ fally multi and is now lying about making it to 1v1s? Holy shit that's desperate, I hope people finally realize how full of shit he is. Sucks that he's getting ddosed but maybe if he stopped being sucha whining lying sissy bitch that wouldn't happen

I did 7 just to be sure, but I only ended up needing 3 since I got a 5 step elite with 2 clues in which I could do 2 steps each.

---
There's obviously a way to do it, but I don't believe you understand what they have to work with.
---
The RS devs have to deal with a Java engine created pre-2001, along with a shitty custom script format called RuneScript which is a garbage custom scripting format that they have to add features to manually in the engine any time they want something new.
---
Because bossing is easier to learn with better gear? 
---
uwu
---
i drew it based on how it happened when my friend and i went to dks. he forgot the rune throwing axe, and he was wearing the guthans.
---
I do know what they're working with. Doesn't mean we shouldn't expect them to fix shit.
---
To drop trade the items? 404 BRAIN NOT FOUND 
---
Lmfao, gold

not sure how serious you play during downtime, but maybe a tablet is an option?

Yep, really isn't that hard to predict. Good call tho.
---
he 1 ticked a 4 way + barrage, okay clean plays. But also talks through it. Thats not possible.

Where can he chin though? Mm tunnels are off limit because the grand tree gives attack exp.

He's a disgusting douchebag honestly.

Wait until day 7 and get the 6 hour immunity.  You can easily qualify for the tourny within those 6 hours.

Subs often get quarantined if the content is extremely repulsive, or if the users break the laws by inciting violence/acts of terror. CTH is a good example, surprised they still haven't been quarantined yet.

the teams already have god names in castlewars lmao
---
RuneLite is 3rd party software, no?
---
For what you’ve got in form of randomisation it’s abyss for average money at late levels or zmi for xp till very late levels, zmi is 45-55k xp/ hour where as abyss the far preferable, randomised, once great and slow do way of training (unless you could pay for runners). Abyss is absolutley dated was first before zmi. The economy is a lot more mature now we and it needs a boost as does pvp done.
---
These scammers should be jailed irl.

nice try jagex

I seem to have ridiculous luck with dragon equipment for some reason. A black demon dropped a D med before I could even equip it, I got a D skirt in 8 steel dragon kills, a Dragon Sword in under 500 kills and a Chainmail in under 1000 dust devils. 
---
Yet when it really matters it takes me over 2000 Cave Horrors for a black mask and 7 hours of cutting jungles to get a gout tuber!
---
Awesome

yeah u loot chests and then can sell items to a store and buy different items back.  LMS requires RNG for top end players, which is why its basically always dead.
---
Anyone remember when this sub turned into completely unreadable upside-down mode like 4 years ago during april fools? Good times
---
Can someone check if she’s okay? I’m getting concerned... looking at a blank wall for a prolonged amount of time can’t be healthy..
---
Maybe you should have listened in school.
---
&gt; How you cqn think that is equivalent to a bank with 816 spaces is beyond me.
---
It is a smaller version of a bank where items may be stored until a later date.  
---
&gt;Bankspace can already be an issue on normal IM so for you to suggest that UIM is easy bc of zulrah bank shows me you don't play it or even normal IM and are just out of touch.
---
Luckily we arent talking about normal IM and did *I* ever say anything about UIM being easy?  The whole point of UIM is being an iron man "*who cant bank* thus meaning you have the space of your inventory to work with.   These smaller banks are in the game and honestly idc if UIM's use them or not, and it *definitely* makes UIM easier.  I'd bet it shaves thousands of hours off the time to max because of the space provided.  
---
Do you truly believe any form of banking is "in the spirit" of UIM when the whole point of UIM is not being able to bank?  Again I never said it is equivalent to playing normal, just that any significant amount of storage like Zulrah and Vorkath are essentially cheating the point of a UIM.  You are getting 1-2 inventories worth of items that you otherwise would've had to 1.) use right away  2.) discard   3.)  have it take up the most important thing you have, inventory space.

---
Fair enough. Any reason why you haven’t set foot on zeah? If you do slayer a lot and you have a combat of I believe 75+ I’d recommend using her. Just fairy ring to CIR and she’s at the top of the mountain north. Every time you get an item called a brimstone key which drops from whatever monster you’re slaying on task, you can use the key to open her chest which is directly behind her on the mountain. Each key averages about 100k.

I did like 180 wyrms task and got 3 keys. So not bad loot!

Not only is a pestle and mortar steezy af, but it also removes the chance of smoking plastic/aluminum shards, which we definitely do when using normal grinders

&gt;These are the estimated experience rates based on the developer's blog from 21 September 2016.
---
Those are the rates told by jagex and not ones that have been determined by testing. Jagex are notorious for being bad at estimating xp rates.
---
Wait theres an xp bonus? Im a lazy fuck and get exactly 500 points then wait at the big doors to bank. So if i get 525 points theres an xp bonus?

Idk what justifies the downvotes. I think some of these portion of subreddit actually settles for any kind of mod

Cmon guise we gotta give Jagex a break mistakes happen y’know humans are only humans y’know. Osrs is so popular right now that means Jagex is doing a good job guise they never mess up and break anything. That T-bow server reset thing was just an early April fools prank! Mod Jed was just pranking us for a while it was an extended prank.

What, 30gp loss of making ppots instead of selling? Don’t be an idiot. That’s not significant enough to even take into consideration. It’s pretty much the only way to profit through herbalore. 36k seed, 100k yield, 60k free herb exp.
---
No farm runs, 100k unf(pots), additional supplies and then further sell for a loss. 
---
20/4 = 24
---
You're "making money" but you're realistically losing money, because you could sell the ingredients for more than the result.

Used, I've seen them before on places such as craigslist. But for the most part I agree.

Wasnt this ripped out of a shitty meme like 5 days ago
---
Pros of dmm, high viewer count for week, Osrs top 5 most viewers on the final, cons, too many fuck ups, cw pros, nostalgic, different content (couldnt replace dmm tho), cons, same 5 pro cw players alltime, must be lower prize pool since not enough viewers, no streamers, no week of publicity...

Mostly just rng.  Since the flowers are 1 hit KOs, just use a BP or darts, and burst right before he phases.  But it's fairly pointless to try to be efficient saving a few seconds on a boss you can do only every other day

As an UIM that’s played legit since the beginning, Lowlander Lured GWD and should have been de ironed. They let him keep the Armour while changing the rules making it way harder for other ULTs to get the same gear

However the amount of the gp the herbs are worth are relevant because that is wealth currently I'm your possession, and by making pots the amount of wealth you posses decreases.

Jagex killed half of the players because they were too lazy to test the changes making a lot of ppl lose entire weeks work for nothing. Then they proceeded to give everyone base 94 stats meaning lvl 60 rag ranger that played for 7 hours this week has same starting point stat wise as the maxed guy that spent 100 hours.
---
How tho
---
I heard about the tbow scandal, and saw memes, but what actually happened? 
---
I hate everything that has to do with 'balance' in a game dev context.. Half the time balance isn't necessary and most of the time the proposed idea of balance is just wrong

You didn't get a match, did you?
---
They were only able to restore some of the affected players. For others, that but was the end of the tournament. I believe they are making a post today about what they plan to do for those players that couldn't reconnect.
---
I meant it more in the way that it always seems like he is the one who responds to pretty much everything while it seems most other developers sort of turn their heads and whistle, hoping they dont get blamed. Obviously I don't blame Ash for this personally.
---
Zammy has shitload of mage def you'll just splash on it. Same for Sara. Bandos is easy to mage and you can find guide on it on YouTube. 
---
Is there a vid of his side of the fight?
---
Because I didn't see any eat animation.
---
buying gf
---
Not worth theorycrafting on Zammy then?  I feel like there might be "a" method, and I'm just curious to pick an experienced boss'er's brain about potential setups.  
---
Exactly what i was thinking cx
---
I never said it was okay. If you look at my previous posts I said it’s fucked that it happened.  I’m just defending my alliance since one of the guys I replied to implied that it was only fools and gg doing it.  
---
Even more of a reason to mute tbvh.
---
You just don't know what you're talking about. This is already implemented. The problem is just that any time jagex starts banning keywords orcode phrases, the bots just update to very slightly circumvent those words. Go into game and type "rsmalls" a few times, let me know how long till you're muted. You can prove to yourself this is real in like 30 seconds lol. 
---
This is why all these bots are thing websites like

For all you know yhat Hotgirl13 is a 12 year old boy who wants free stuff.
---
You probably can, I managed to run OSRS on my mother's 16 year old laptop that's seen *things*. It wasn't performing that well, but it worked for cannonballs.
---
I would suggest just saving up a bit more to get an actual functional laptop though as the sub 300 ones you'd find would probably be either too ancient for anything besides afking OSRS or damaged badly enough to break soon.
---
&gt;I assumed the dice rolling doublers were legit
---
You literally just cannot help some people lol
---
No fuckups.
---
Why fletch?
---
Konar is pretty garbage unless you only do slayer for gp
---
I forgot this existed but it was very good.
---
I enjoyed reading the mailbag or whatever it was called with people asking questions too. Seems very old fashioned now.
---
little did you know rs3 still makes more money than osrs due to mtx. Until rs3 drops to 20% of total income, its not likely ever going to lose support, which is a good thing imo because the game is not inherently bad, its pretty good. Its just the mtx that made it what it is today.
---
Are lizardmen a good task? I'm at the point where I've got all my necessary unlocks, blocks, slayer helm, herb bag, etc. 
---
I want a mix of good gp/hr and good xp/hr tasks. I figured having more good tasks in my list will reduce the odds of a bad task. But I have no clue if lizardmen are good or bad? I've heard you can cannon them. 
---
Should I unlock them, and what should I kill then (with cannon if possible) the shamans or the regular ones?
---
It's possible to kill it with max mage att but not really worth it as you splash so much even with ancestral and spaghetti staff
---
Used to do this back in rs2 too, upon grand exchange release this wa an 'easy' way to make some money and get to mid level 70s in herblore. Inefficient af, but was pumped to do it for days on end.
---
Yep I also fucked up and bought a bond for the wrong account, after only 20 minutes I got a response and they fixed it all up. You just don't hear about the positive experiences.
---
Also, that's the only time I've ever needed customer support, if you secure your account and why would you even need it?
---
You too bro!
---
tyler's response wasn't to osrs it was some LOL or DOTA bullshit but i still get your points
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
I just want to add that I’m not salty that OP got his account back, with some fat bank loot for his troubles. I’m happy as hell for him if it is true. I’m just skeptical about Jagex leaving all the loot.... plus it’s 4/1 haha 
---
It used to be like that
---
Imagine giving random player support the ability to give accounts all 99s and tbows.
---
I don’t think that’s a good idea
---
You seriously want devs to take a year at least out of patching this game to create a modernised engine for the game, all so they might be able to easier implement DMM features? 
---
Not technically opportunity cost.
---
Imagine it was properly audited..
---
Would have been better to take the screenshot from last year's april fools
---
Because the OP got the items, not the botter
---
Don't have an account with the stars yet haha, otherwise I could/would.
---
Best guess would be valley girl 
---
They typically don't unless it's a really obscene amount.
---
Your bank value was lower after you made the potion than when the herbs were in your bank. Explain the profit.
---
When I used reflex filters, it ended up filtering pretty much any chat messages and forcing me to log out of the game. Does anyone know why this could be happening or how to fix it?
---
70 defense, 75 range, 58 prayer
---
I reported this bug [a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6l1lww/gamebreaking_bug_unicorns_can_drop_2_horns)and it still isn't fixed? Jamflex fix your game
---
Tbh your best bet would probably be trying to find a YouTube video (if there is one) explaining the timeline with the EoC, splintering of the community and OSRS launch explained, everything must be pretty confusing if you only picked up osrs lately and never played back in the day 
---
As long as you are refactoring the code constantly and making each section of code you touch better, legacy code isn't really a problem. Over time the quality of the code base rises.
---
And a saw. ;)
---
He could have just taken one with him on day 1 and kept it but noooo...
---
never even thought about chins, will bring them next trip thank you
---
considering almost every poll passes its safe to say a large portion of the playerbase trusts their judgement
---
Nobody would play it, even compared to regular UIM
---
need more pmods who will actually mute, and the mute needs to be longer then just 2hours or whatever the hell it is.  its just stupid that people will do the job yet jagex are afraid of people doing power trips.
---
You say it would be nice to see uim not use the zulrah bank yet you probably don't play one so how does it affect you? 
---
Cuuuuuuuunt
---
I did all gwd early and got lucky. Had hasta before whip. My way is slow 1 kill a inv. 
---
Of course, but I''m still having this issue and wanted to maintain visibility on the topic... 
---
It looks like the phone's IP occasionally changes, so I'll just work to place the authenticator app on my phone as well so I'm not forced to go to my computer whenever this issue happens.
---
well that was disappointing 
---
I'm out of the loop here, what is the DMM, or the giant situation people are talking about?
---
Sometimes there is no update, but there was a stealth gag that activates, like one year had Pures getting fake xp drops
---
I would give it a shot? But right now im demotivated by the fact that you can basically bank your stuff anyways at Zulrah or Vorkath. + the hardcore aspect would make it more thrilling.
---
I just dont get why not?
---
Depends. If your authenticator is tied to your gmail account and they get that too then gg
---
There have been a couple posts of people showing off their accounts and not hiding their account usernames and people somehow have used this to hack these accounts. 
---
The comments in these posts were all “well you didn’t hide any account information you deserve to be hacked” etc.  (which I find ridiculous) and am really just joking about the concept that this guy left a piece of info about his account uncovered 
---
Wow
---
Opportunity cost - The loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen
---
This case - used herbs instead of selling them
---
Sounds like it fits to me, unless the dictionary definition of Opportunity cost isnt correct/complete in which case feel free to enlighten me
---
I have a :43 pb that I can't seem to beat. Iv gotten a few :44's since then 
---
Have there been any gags discovered this year?
---
Young me actually fell for it :(
---
Well, they’ll be hesitant NOW at least, after the shitstorm over draynor dock
---
They said they could easily do it, but the amount of people into it is so incredibly small it's not worth it basically. I think itd an awesome idea and would love to play one. I just simulate it with a f2p uim but it isn't the same lol
---
I'm not talking about anything but the most efficient way to max. Def and range should be trained through quests and then slayer to max. 
---
Cum and run
---
Jokes is on you. April 1st is the only day jagex doesn't fuck up.
---
They're supposed to make an official statement about it today, expecting it to be released when they leave the office today.
---
Then they should do the dang engine work. It’s not an excuse.
---
You jumped 2ft in the air and fell back down cracking your head in the process though
---
Transcript?
---
F. Thanks for the debrief my dude.
---
It's 2019, man. You can't just go around asserting unicorns' horn cardinality. Try to be a little more open-minded.
---
You can try :)
---
Lol they say people wouldnt care about it.. If u see it like that you could argue that there is so much dead content in the game that they shouldnt add anything until that dead content is revived.
---
And even if its just a couple hundred people playing the gamemode. Who cares if there is another option to choose on tutorial island?
---
haha im a prune and i dont like other people having fun!
---
It would actually be a true UIM considering you couldnt do a lot of the death mechanics that are currently meta for reggie UIMs. 
---
Support so 6 ppl or so will martyr their personal lives for youtube content.
---
When I buy gold ore from the BF shop, I often find myself checking my smithing exp.
---
It always shocks me that it isn't going up. 
---
Then I realize that I am kind of dumb.
---
Just don't do agility 70-90 in one go like I did, it'll make you hate the game for like a month until you realise it's fun again.
---
Man I know it’s just banter and I don’t obviously know the inner mechanics of their relationship but I feel like Torvesta takes it too far sometimes. He’ll see Jay genuinely pissed off and go fuck with him and/or make him lose serious risk. Plus he’ll call him fat and shit on top of that. Sometimes it is actually kinda hard to tell it’s banter. But again idk them personally so maybe that’s totally within boundaries for them. 
---
Hence the "Her:" 
---
You can also barrage them with a cannon and make the task crazy fast, but at a lost
---
Who?
---
Smh I can get 2 zips at the GE for $10/g
---
Depends on industry. A lot of friends I've had in liberal arts degrees have taken unpaid positions, but I've never heard of anyone in software accepting an unpaid internship.
---
Yeah I'm not sure where people get "friendly banter" because it sure doesn't seem friendly. 
---
But "she's" the one staring at the wall wouldn't "she" be the one thinking not the teller. That's what I meant 
---
all I get is sea shanty 2 while waiting on the line
---
I like watching the xp drops nmz using dharok set :pp
---
&gt;&gt;I honestly doubt any pkers worth their salt will bother to show up
---
This is literally the point. We don't want them to show up, we want to use the altar lol.
---
I fully understand why you recommend bringing gear but as you mentioned this is *low* risk. We're going for *zero* risk other than bones.
---
And you're right - any pker worth their salt left after 5 minutes when they realized there was nothing to be gained but unnoted bones. 
---
Try Unclan
---
In dark, there is also light!
---
That’s pretty heavy
---
He doesn't say much cuz Jagex invites him to RuneFest and they cooperate tightly (cuz osrs is his full-time job)
---
Same way like Skill Specs held himself waaaaay more back than he usually does when commentating dmm.
---
Why are you so bad with Falco? :\^)

---
That and use ge tracker. You're not going to get anything more from a flipping guide because there is not much more to it. Other than the basics like not putting your eggs into one basket, if it's too good to be true, trying to flip crashing items etc. 
---
What does Fe stand for?
---
You didn't fall for it, whaaaaat? April Fools though
---
With the Venezuelan power grid dropping once a week, everyone is my dude.
---
2 minute isn't it?
---
the blast furnace pump fun. you have people autotyping something every 4 minutes, people showing off their stats and flaming each other, and what's even more fun is when that 1 dude who usually shovels the coke for half the day just suddenly stops, or logs off, then everyone starts pumping an unloaded pump for about an hour or two, gaining absolutely no XP and just desperately waiting for someone to bravely sacrifice their time to help others gain 11500-12,000 str xp/hr. (Truthfully, you get lower rates more often than these higher rates since less people are shoveling coke.)
---
Hopefully this investigation builds an understanding of what issues player's could have, ultimately leading series of blogs "challenging myths" about DMM issues!
---
Wow what a shit loot. I’ve gotten better on easy clue scrolls. O well. I live for the scroll.
---
Was funny the first 5 times I read this
---
It's the same as the meme where a guy and girl are laying in a bed and she looks at him and is worried what he's thinking about, but he's thinking about something completely random.
---
She's looking through the wall at her crush and worried that he's thinking about the other bank tellers instead of her. But in actuality, he's judging a random person for what is in their bank.
---
Hell I didn't notice it's your cakeday. Happy cakeday my dude.
---
Oh yeah. I totally forgot about the combat requirement
---
Thank you man 💙
---
LMAO this meme is so true 
---
Hell yeah 
---
Me when I'm a couple thousand exp away from a 99, but I don't want to accidentally get the level so I can save it for later and flex my fireworks in front of noobs in Lumbridge and feel good about myself just once before I low alch myself. 
---
Squirrel doesn't even taste very good. Why eat that out of all things?
---
Damn, nice job.
---
Im at CB 93 now and have been trying periodically since like 85 or so but I just havrnt managed it yet. I think Im going to wait for 75 range and just do it with a blowpipe cause rune cbow aint cutting it for me.
---
But I DCd lastnight and lost my cannon at fire giants so thats cool too. 
---
LMS coffer? Death banking at the evil chicken?
---
Nice English 
---
All drops unnoted. 
---
It would make that rare table drop of 100 silver ore really stand out. 
---
You mom gay
---
Examples?
---
Exactly, Mod Ash is competent af w/ runescript but won't touch the engine code. Not sure why, maybe he doesn't have good Java knowledge or Jagex doesn't give content devs clearance to touch engine
---
Not on mobile, typing in GE is a pain. 
---
I remember when zSkillers was first forming all those years ago (with Zamight) and the website, you were one of the big names I remember in the cc. Crazy to see you after having left that cc years ago, congrats on the elite man 
---
Is this actually kids ranqe?
---
Can confirm. I've quit about 4 separate times now, sometimes for years. But I'm back again, and this time, I've just started multi-clienting so I can grind a HCIM while I afk on my main.
---
This got me so good. "wtf is this guy doing with all those super strength p...... ah. nice." 
---
Yea, let them fuck and test with your account first. Who cares? It ain't like your account is a national treasure.
---
+1 On this 
---
Super accurate.
---
I keep wondering this too.  Like... I’ve never had issues with my email(s) being compromised (outside of big data breaches) because I actually use things like LastPass for password management, not reusing passwords, etc. 
---
*Snap*

&gt; IGN Lollipop
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
wat
---
still slow af in solo
---
it really has worked wonders in tandem with botting to make sure a majority of skilling money makers are not worth the time invested.
---
Just like how they made several posts over the years on RS3 that they would tone down the MTX. Then proceeded to double and triple down on it.
---
Also update: unable to recover the rest because they weren't using authenticator
---
When everyone was teleported to the 1v1 area, Jagex forgot to remove the insta-kill fog so everyone died. They only let half the players back on afterwards. 
---
Just about every other massive mmo (and even the MOBAs and such) have 24/7 (or 7 days a week at a certain time) customer support where you either talk on the phone or email with a support team member. To resolve any issue with Jagex you have to jump through hoops and call your issue a 'billing problem' (even if it's unrelated) just to get a reply. This usually takes 20-30 days on top of that.
---
Oh SHIT. 
---
Yeah this happens with other activities :( (taking compost from a compost bin)
---
Lmao early April fools

Sounds like some crowd sourcing is needed for translations in finnish.

Yeah, but I see a ton of people not picking up the hides anyway, getting a full inventory of bones.
---
The latest JMod smackdown right here. 
---
imagine all the people
---
If you're a member in osrs, you're a member in rs3. The accounts are connected and it's the same subscription. So yes, there is a 1:1 sub ratio.
---
Get dragon ruby bolts, get bones to peaches. Use anguish and pegs. Get a ring of suffering if you can afford it imo. I am not sure whether to bring blessed dhide legs or veracs, you need to check the dps sheet if that's worth it.
---
Even then I don't it does. Sorta like that whole orange - doorhinge shenanigans
---
iOS for me
---
He ate a raw pig face at another protest like last week.
---
I choose to believe that he's a false flag. He's trying to inspire people to become vegan because jesus christ, eating raw faces is not really an endearing form of protest.
---
You’re not allowed to kill those kalphites off task. So he tells you to stop because your task is over.
---
Got me haha
---
You must be the April Fool
---
Runescape is a product like any other. If you don't like it, don't invest your time or money into it. 
---
Or could it be that all the people here actually really like Runescape and Jagex's supposedly massive fucks ups are just minor inconveniences that don't affect the gameplay of 98% of the players but they just really like bitching about shit and feeling part of a group? 
---
We could, but we won't
---
This would've never happened if they hadn't banned our boy.. :(
---
This honestly kind of shocks me. How does the lead dev not know even a little bit of the language that the engine is built on? This is kind of pathetic.
---
Have you tried just getting it?
---
I dont know how you can fill your inventory fully after 4 kills without getting multiple rune longsword or kiteshield drops. Mind posting your inventory setup?
---
Most non STEM internships are supposed to be job shadowing. Obviously most employers don't stick to this but no one reports them.
---
Alternatively, in the health sector its common to pay THEM for your internship. I'm an occupational therapist and I paid roughly 6k to work 40 hours a week 2 summers in a row lol
---
Or just don't forget. 
---
No
---
Or it could be RuneScape is a popular product that does well despite pretty bad business practices and horrible legacy code? It's actually a lot more common than you think, you will learn this if you work as a software developer.
---
Why is this post titled like a fortune cookie.
---
There are lots of things you can do to maximize slayer xp, but also not sure why you're just calling out Lynx Titan like he's the only one to get that much xp, there are 26 other players who also have 200m slayer xp

I just hope people do not use this to filter out Ironman saying that they are Ironmen BTW, how else will I be able to tell people that I am an Ironman BTW.
---
BTW, I’m an Ironman BTW.
---
For what it's worth I've only ever had to contact support twice and both times they sorted out my problem in less than 12 hours. First time it was to remove an old email I had no access to, and the second time I forgot to cancel membership on an alt so they refunded me all 6 months that I'd paid without noticing.
---
So no complaints from me about their customer support.
---
They could but it probably wouldn't make anyone that happy. Without the prize pool or the title on the line I imagine that people would care a lot less. I'm also not saying this is a bad idea but with limited time and resources, there must be something else the devs can work on to regain community trust.
---
Your mentality about this is the EXACT reason why PvPers think that non-pvpers are huge pussies who get butthurt over nothing. Because that's exactly what this is. 
---
Have you been on the official OSRS Wiki?
---
Yes
---
Ranged.
---
What's your construction level?
---
If around 50 you can benefit most from teleport rooms (teleports you use alot) and a mounted glory for unlimited glory teleports. You can also build an altar for prayer restore and build costume storage units to free up some bank space.
---
Nice you got me lol
---
You can do it at 100 cmb with minimal bossing experience. You are overthinking it my dude
---
how do you get your kill count to show up
---
Not exactly true, I was watching a streamer who only had 10 viewers at the time who got successfully teled in from fally and didn't die. There was actually a lot of people that survived with him too.
---
It seemed like the 256 1v1 area had two sections, one with fog and one without. The streamer was surrounded with people in every square on his side, and could see across to the other side where there was a death pile in every square. 
---
Climbing a tree in those boots is a good way to break your ankles 
---
It's literally not fair that Ash probably makes less than some retard management types who would never in their life consider doing such a thing
---
Fuck Jagex, as in fuck the company itself
---
Ash better be making fucking bank, he better be making Lambo fucking bankrolls literally
---
I think it is pretty clear Reddit is once again the joke of the OSRS community. 
---
2019 and still seething over clans, PVP and DMM. Not to forget, half of the users can't even secure a fucking Runescape account, lol.
---
Grow your herbs and have anima seeds running. I am making mad profit growing my own herbs for super restores atm and using an army of chemistry 
---
Yews are more like 50kxp/hr up to like 57k with perfect attention. I used to afk them before unlocking redwoods. Still not worth doing unless you are just going there because you have homework or something
---
To be honest i died with full grace full doing nature abyss rc and i didn’t know you could get back untradables because i had just started playing old school after switching from osrs. So i never went back and got it and was already 60+ agility. So i got a few pieces and recolors and tried to make them match. Was just missing the gloves and boots until recently since i already had penace gloves and boots of lightness. 
---
In addition i have almost every teleport in the game now, and quest cape) and the rest of the graceful pieces), so i dont need much run regen much aside from agility training and rc(which i cant wear the full set for anways). 
---
And so... idk i just have always done it this way, and at this point it is just easier than switching my tag tabs in runelite around
---
CW isn't member-only anymore, iirc
---
castle wars is f2p
---
Do people only think one glitch occurred? Does nobody notice how manked got healed to full and full prayer restored ticks after his blood barrage healed him? 
---
Do your wood cutting in nonpvp world and it won’t happen 
---
Sure its alternative, just not as good
---
To be brutally honest the meta for med level ironman should be green dragons.. With the games nec and 4 good items and decent stats you cut through green dragons like they are nothing, literally 2x faster than blue drags + games nec teleport makes bank trips incredibly easy
---
CS = customer support. 
---
And not the person you replied to, but the employees could be transferred and retrained for osrs
---
What kind of response is this. The only correct move would have been to restart the entire final hour. After the disconnections previously, how is it still not possible to rollback the damn sever. No beta testing, seriously...unacceptable. Jagex needs to stop reacting to problems and start putting viable options for remedies before the errors/bugs/problems occur. This is a failure of imagination. Can't have unknown unknowns.
---
No way they could have seen a seasonal event coming /s
---
And here I am at 1100 kills with not a single shard.
---
Castle wars has been available to f2p for a while now not sure how you spawned there but maybe scan your computer change and change your pass 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/50sadr/efficient_1175_qps_and_bgloves_quest_orderguide/ this helped me a ton for rfd, seems to be along the lines of what ur looking for
---
Huh TIL, still doesn't explain how I got here though. Any way I could have accidentally teleported?
---
If you have a bgs empty your spec on it and just use the whip. 
---
Instead of just downvoting me let’s have a discussion Jesus Christ this sub is so toxic. 
---
If you watch the fight they both were in the arena mid fight when he was being healed. One of them rendered their character off or something. So are they saying he was already outside of the arena when manked was getting healed? Or are they saying after manked was healed and then almost died AGAIN, that’s when fweeze apparently stepped out?
---
If you haven’t noticed they are in damage control mode. They can’t even do a successful dmm so yes I am going to question every damn thing

I'm a few levels off of 50. The costume room would definitely help considering how many costumes I have in my bank lol.

I would have liked to join but I don't have 1m gp.

If performing an action on an item lowers the value of the item then that action loses you money by definition. Every time you perform the action you lose a certain amount of money (initial value-final value) . If I have a millions dollars and burn half of it, it doesn’t matter where the a million dollars came from (lottery, inheritance, etc.), the act of burning money loses me money. You might have gained money compared to the time before you gained the 1 mil, but that is irrelevant to the amount of money you gain/lose by performing an action.

Ughh I did try to fight him, plus this is account is partially made for PvP, but it just so happens that he can basically one shot me and I stand virtually no chance against him in a fight. Also I've been wc on the pvp worlds since 80 fucking wc and never once have I experienced anything like this, nor have I ever cared about getting pk'ed I know the risks. I just don't want to be ragged constantly when I'm trying to relax in what has been my home world for chopping magics since starting my grind.

It would be if I were them. Osrs is more of a passion project with, sorry guys, but an entitled playerbase. We've played this game so long it's hard to say it hasn't been a big part of many lives. If something happens to it they get all up in arms and pissed. Instead of putting money into bonds many would rather support the Venezuelan gold farmers which, arguably, hurt the game. Economically speaking I find it difficult to believe this game makes as much as Reddit thinks it does. It's not a money issue on the employment side of things, it might be, but it might be simply a problem of not being economically viable. Hard to know. Easy to vilify a faceless enemy like upper management though 
---
No I'm not, but the ring and guthans are a bit out of my range right now
---
It's worth using dragon diamond/ruby. They seem really expensive but you have to remember that with assembler the cost is only really 20% of a bolt per shot (since the backpack recovers 80%). 
---
It is April fools day after all. They were just thinking ahead.
---
Runescript isn't a programming language, it's a markup language. It's like writing XML or JSON (it does have some actual scripting capabilities too, but they're comparatively limited). None of the devs actually know how to program beyond a very rudimentary level.
---
Yes, free to play accounts with no auth or pin (wouldn't have either aftering recovering a hacked acc, since the hacker disabled pin and auth is disabled on recovery)

Oh I figured, just wanted to tell my POV on the idiocracy haha
---
nice but i don't play anymore sorry bud
---
I'm fully aware of that. I do know what I'm talking about, I work in behavioural analytics. The current keyword detection is not fit for purpose, it doesn't work as you've just proved. It would be very simple to look for behaviours and patterns instead of just keywords. 
---
They've said that they would like to make it so that some of the less-worthwhile puzzles and bosses are more reasonably balanced. I think their goal isn't to remove scouting, but to balance raids in such a way that scouting stops being necessary. 
---
The real question is who doesn't use this gear?
---
Yea that's what I'm saying. I dont think anyone hates him
---
Minimum wage in the UK and US are different. Also location is a factor. And torvesta literally on video says he’s going to use his alt to grind for pvp weapons and do wildy slayer but wanted to merch first for money. Like I said subjective. Some people think he was in the wrong... ohers don’t. Not about to argue about it though 
---
It has never happened before, and it shouldn't happen cause he's breaking the rules of the game.
---
They binned the idea because everyone complained. The concept was Warding Scrolls if you wanted to read up on it.
---
Post it off your real account, coward.
---
They might not be scams but player run games of chance are against the rules and there's no way to know if they're using legit odds. 
---
Well a legit dice rolling doubler would be very profitable for the person running it.  Casinos make a lot of money with a slim 1-2% +ev margin.  There's no need for it to be a scam 
---
Holy shit balls.
---
Thanks, very helpful.
---
Also very farcical on jagexs part. 
---
They literally just hired 3 new qa testers in the last month. You just aren't as well informed as you think you are.  
---
can't really compare US wages, any job with atleast a college degree is going to pay x2 or more compared to West Europe.
---
That's pretty low brow bud

If you call inferno an integrity change, sure

---
I’ve watched other finals before until I realized the issues were too frequent to support an event until they got their shit together. And no lol it goes beyond drama when jagex wastes a significant amount of the participants’ time with no indication of a fix and it definitely is not just a game when a person can make a career out of playing games
---
Can't chin at a good spot without getting attack xp.
---
I'll need a source on this. If it's not a language then how are they implementing any functionality? My guess is that its just a highly modified java framework to the point where it does not resemble java at all. 
---
It's usually easier to build it yourself, you can build it right on the hotspot - not too many people make flatpacks.
---
I'm pretty sure for the costume boxes Oak holds the same as mahogany so it's just cosmetic.
---
stick to 4chan, buddy. we cant deal with that edge here
---
You can always use a wildcard once they start appearing. 
---
You’re fucked in the head man. Seek treatment.
---
olm has an attack cycle. in a standard team raid the specials either happen when the head turns from melee side to mage side (melee set) or the other way around (mage set).
---
they occur in order, so crystals-lightning-teles-healing(p3 only). they occur only if olm has someone visible to attack (and melee hand is not crippled) after their auto attacks so in team raids you can easily skip specials.

Please join! I have 2 friends who are low 80 CB because they switched from RS3 and theyre grinding right now.  We welcome all shapes and sizes :D the end goal is to be able to do Raids together, so we are all on our individual grind at the moment.  
---
I myself have limited PVM experience because I NMZ'd Quested my way to where I am now (107 cb) so really, its a good learning experience for everyone.  Once youre in the CC and I am on my pc I can send you the discord link as well! Participating in events / talking/ voice chat will earn you higher ranks and more trust within the group.
---
To be honest I just like playing games socially and this is how I stay social with everyone! Always looking for new friends to learn pvm with (Once I am done with Vork grind lol)
---
Yea it is, he still post under his old rsn on YouTube

---
People on here have been campaigning for competitive CW for months now but the game mode is still dead. Barely anyone plays it outside of a small group of dedicated teams &amp; people looking to AFK tickets.
---
Plus, someone always asks for Fist of Guthix or Stealing Creation every two weeks on the Q&amp;A so obviously there's not much popularity for CW if people are looking for alternatives that aren't old school.
---
Absolutely use ruby bolts for half of Zilyana's health. You can spec huge and it's faster kills depending on your luck. Switch back to diamond after. 
---
For the duration of the fight I'll usually have either Steel Skin or Rock skin on, along with Eagle Eye/Rigour
---
I bring rune darts for the blowpipe to down the minions after Zilyana as fast as possible, so I have enough time to recuperate with drops and bones to peaches. After awhile, you should start to see that your trip ends when your staminas do, not your prayer or food. 
---
ACB will have better accuracy, but Dragon Crossbow is fine too. 
---
If you find you're running out of prayer too fast you can try to substitute assembler for range cape (t) if you're 99. This will lose some DPS but it's a prayer bonus. 
---
And lastly you can try and learn the sweaty pray flicks. Boaty I believe has a guide on this, but I can't do it worth shit lol. 
---
How the hell do you make a 10.5 min video on this lmao
---
No, I'm serious lol. No need to get it, got plenty of food and would rather spend my time on something usefull.
---
I don’t give a shit about them admitting anything, it’s fucking embarrassingly stupid  for a game company to push something live without running a beta. 
---
If you do a solo ever again please use Synq’s guide. His guide goes through multiple olm methods that you can try learning to reduce the amount of deaths you get at olm. However, I wouldn’t recommend doing a solo until you’re at least base 90 combat stats. I don’t mean to be rude but the amount of points you got in this raid is like a 0% chance at a drop. Also, the reason you want to be higher combat is because raids scale off of your combat, so you’re getting a lot less points then a combat 120 would get solo. You want to aim for around 7500 points at least for a 1% chance at a drop. Good luck,
---
Olm has 3 special attacks that he always does in the same order from the start of a phase. First the floor crystals, then the lightning, then the portals. Olm will do 2 attacks between each special attack. The 2 attacks can be normal magic or ranged attacks, or they can be phase unique attacks such as flame wall burn with me acid pool ect. There will also be a blank attack where olm does nothing or turns his head between the 2 attacks. Olm attacks on a 4 tick cycle, like a whip DHL or trident. So olms attack cycle looks like this
---
Normal attack
---
Empty even
---
Spikes
---
Empty event
---
Lightning
---
Portals
---
(On 3rd phase it will do healing hand 2 attacks after portals)
---
Repeat. 
---
On the head phase it still attacks on a 4 tick cycle uses all the phase specific attacks, but doesn't have special attacks.
---
Interesting that white lily seeds arent on hespori's log since that's the only way to get them. 
---
Gotcha, I will certinaly have to give this a shot! I really dont take damage except for the blue balls of death/the occasional unlucky lineup of poison splatters when walking back and forth so getting an extra kill or 2 would be nice for KC. Just hit 600 over the weekend (only 1 week of work lol)
---
I guess I accidentally pocket commented. Oops
---
And me 
---
this one is actually right click inspect element. way easier
---
Because they have a very strong history of learning from mistakes? /s
---
False
---
r/user/JagexSween you talked in the past about having castle wars part of the PVP cup? Can we see anything from Jagex end to help showcase castle wars to the general population of runescape? It would surely make for an interesting tournament.

Think Brits pronounce it as "burra" whereas Americans pronounce it as "burroh"
---
agility pyrimid might be a good alternitive
---
Gotta give the upvote for that one. Good banter haha
---
Looks good af on a resume for when they decide to upgrade jobs 
---
they probably did add an april fools joke but no one found it because it's bugged cx
---
You are like 10x as qualified as most of the noobs asking about raids. You'll be fine dog. 
---
The point of my question is that I do not trust their ability... I am in no way throwing them under the bus, I didn't reveal anything new or put undeserving blame.
---
You assume their data model is that advanced. First mistake
---
If you have a bunch of semi charged ones right now, go to the Runes person at the GE and you can decant charges.
---
I mean there is only what? A dozen or so JMods working on OSRS and an even smaller subset are developers? I'd think it'd be fairly obvious if someone was fired. Additionally, they're usually fairly up front about people leaving the company. 
---
I say keep on making it harder for them though. Just filter out more and more.
---
Your examples are a little far fetched compared to talking about a team of devs that build content on an engine with no specific engine devs. They're shooting blindly. There's no one to reference when engine specific problems arise. This would normally be the job of a lead dev to fill in those gaps and provide knowledge on the overarching systems that directly impact your game. 
---
Until you realize you can bot goblins on a (pretty much) fresh account. Better hope jagex bans them fast enough, I bet you could kill a decent amount of them per hour if using darts/knives, and there's enough goblins around for at least 10 bots per world.
---
Tassets + bcp are 50m-ish, 50m/30k=1666 gp=expected value of 1 goblin kill. Bonds are 4m-ish, 4m/1666=2400. That doesn't sound like an unreasonable amount of goblins killed before getting banned imo
---
I'm gonna kill goblins for 5 minutes just to see how many you can kill per hour (yes I know, 99 ranged isn't what btos would have) 
---
&gt;Do not try to edit your screenshots. If you edit it for any reason, you will be disqualified and banned from future competitions.
---
Do you only need the game window or full screen with date at the bottom right? (I typically play with multiple monitors and I would assume it'd be fine to cut/edit it down to only the game client? (And/or using runelites screenshot thing?))
---
Nice touch on the shoes 
---
Do you enjoy anything in life
---
Either kill him or find a new world. You’re literally logging in to a pvp world, and crying that you’re being killed. 
---
Monkey pee all over you
---
This is such a dumb argument, and it keeps getting repeated. No-one will watch castle wars tournaments. There's been 3rd party competitive CW tournaments before and none have gotten any significant viewership. Compared to DMM, which is by far Jagex's most successful product in terms of viewership.
---
Wow I didn't give permission to take a pic of me? I'ma sue ya
---
Sounds awesome. My account is built for pking and I’d like to retain that aspect, though I am open to changing to a build more suitable for both. Could a voider pvm effectively? Or would I need to morph the build? I imagine 42 def and 52 prayer would hold me back.
---
Happened to me yesterday when I went to grab lunch.
---
Bloodvelds in the catecombs can be afk and 130k cb xp/hr and gargoyle's can be decent if you want strength xp or some money. I'd block hellhounds (until cerb), Spiritual creatures, abberant spectres, black demons(in less you like demonic gorillas), and wyrms. 
---
They need to start preventing the creation of bots, a simple verified email before being able to trade/enter wilderness etc will create a struggle to half those bots as most of them are suicide bots with made up bullshit
---
Lemme set the scene. Its at the bank of the grand tree and 43 degrees
---
Make sure ur run is off before u atk. 
---
Yeah. Not bad for 99 range and hp xp.
---
I vape and have a Blackwidow/Deathadder, can confirm.
---
Other than wyrms, the rest of that statement hurts my soul to read
---
I have trolls, kalphites, and drakes blocked personally. 
---
Jagex cs is honestly incredibly good for the size kf the company and playerbase, fucks like tracy just convince thos who have never used it that it is bad because jagex didnt give them whatever they wanted
---
I think you can only woox walk with the blow pipe
---
How is this not the top comment? I don’t even play OS. I’m a former RS3 player and a major blunder like this, along with the previous two in earlier in the year, resonates with the incompetence and lack of foresight we’ve seen time and time again from RS3 updates. 
---
If this isn't an april fools go check the zulrah bank before you die. Looks like the account is spawned in falador with 3 items.
---
Nice man, really going ham haha. I've got like 2.5k kc and about 2k of it with dhcb. I think 6 kill trips are very doable! 
---
&gt; But it really does make me wince that they seem to have such a huge problem with quality control.
---
One of the reasons may be because they are quickly hiring a lot of junior developers to churn out more content quickly, and they don't take testing as seriously as they should. 
---
I really hope they take testing and QA more seriously and increase their efforts towards increasing not just quantity but also quality.
---
Yeah man, doing whatever tasks I get from Konar. Don't really like to skip slayer tasks.
---
Apetoll hasn’t had an update for this reason. If you change anything it breaks the whole damn game lmao.
---
Been playing off and on since I was 9 years old in '07. Ages 9-12 I always had runescape to go to. For some reason all I ever did was kill cows in the Lumbridge cow farm. Got up to like 80cb doing that. I just loved to read the sign that said how many cows had been killed that day. I was a member for like 80% of that time as well. I don't even remember using a singular member's feature, other than exploring west of that wall north of Falador. I fell in love with Ardougne and the Grand Tree. I remember thinking how I'd eventually explore all the areas no one had ever been to (lol) because I thought the world was infinite or something like that, and the borders of the map were just the edge of where people had gone. 
---
I still haven't gone back and touched my RS3 account in any meaningful way because I've become sentimental about it. All I ever did was go and buy the 10 year cape, and look at the skills and realize how inefficiently I played as a child. Over 30 days on that account, with the highest non-combat skill being like 45 woodcutting. 
---
Now in OSRS there's still loads of placed I've never been before. Last night was my first time going to Zeah, for example. Never been very far into Morytania past Canifis and the Nature Spirit coven or whatever. Went to Ape Atoll for the first time last week, and hopefully soon I'll see Shilo Village for the first time. I play this game because of nostalgia, and it's nice to have something to occupy your mind while watching a stream, or playing another more occupying game like CS.
---
Thanks for listening to my TED talk.
---
You can craft them into bracelets and alch for small profit.  Slow xp but cheapo
---
People press accept with their shit in the trade screen and literally hand over their shit to the scammer for x%. 
---
It sounds stupid as fuck but honestly, these scams are really only designed to work on the lowest of the lowest denominator. Anyone above the age of 12 really shouldn't be falling for shit like this.
---
If you need to ask, then you must not have a brain.  Did you take basic maths?
---
Strength level?
---
The point is they should be. 
---
'Show 60m for dragon claws + fury and other stuff' is one I saw yesterday.
---
You put up the money, they put up the items, they accept, you accept. You realize they took out the dragon claws and you paid 60m for a fury.
---
Omg lmfao 
---
"grind to 40"
---
I'd suggest you let that one marinate.
---
Often times people write too much about and it's confusing. It is more simple when you get there and start experiencing it and experimenting with what goes well for you.
---
The short bit: you can make bars very quickly with half the normal coal needed. Just make sure you're on a blast furnace world.

Professional grandma
---
If its advantageous enough for everyone to use it in its current state, buffing it in this manner would most likely be considered overpowered by most. Imagine the effect on pvp, and PvM applications.
---
You could add a caveat however, something like requiring nothing be equipped in any slot that a graceful item would otherwise occupy in order to utilize the boost. This would still be a buff, but not close to as drastic as a blanket effect. Perhaps this is what you meant in your post, but I didn't read it that way, so I apologize if thats the case. However, I have no idea how difficult something like this would be to code into the game, if it would even be possible.
---
Then the jmod gives u a link to twitter in a response telling you to go to the official customer support page
---
Well that’s how I lost 30m a few months back. 
---
Long story short, they bank on your fingers working faster than your brain. I put up 30m, dude put up 3m and hit accept. I clicked accept accept twice before realizing how dumb I was. Got a good laugh out of it. In my defence I had just come off a 12 hour night shift and only logged in to check GE offers before passing out. Good times. 
---
also off topic:
---
there was an interesting dev blog about them trying to combat falling sara brew prices. But since the date that blog was released they fell even harder and are now sitting at around 2k... while they were over 10k at the time I quit. Could someone please give me a quick run down on how this happened? I really cant find much by googling.
---
In game auto chat feature is different than the spamming bots. You can filter it at the duel arena. 
---
Archie actually said why there was no beta done on discord somewhere. It was because there was not enough changes to warrant one. I get that they probably just wanted to save time for other aspects of working on the game, but when your game is made out of 20 year old spaghetti code, it would be a good idea to do a test run whenever you make even minor changes.
---
You should put these on sharkrobot or something as posters. Would pay for a poster to frame and hang up in my room. Just speaks to me. 
---
Why is that a bad thing?  Means you won't run out of things to do.  You don't have to have tried every single piece of content to enjoy the game.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/0RY2GwY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0RY2GwY.jpg)

This is amazing
---
Of course they should be, that doesn't mean it's going to happen. It's not going to happen because quantity &gt; quality.
---
You’re fuckin’ spare parts aren’t ya bud
---
Seems legit
---
I've seen a lot of knowledgable posts get downvoted and people confidently stating bullshit get upvoted on this sub, specifically when it comes to the spaghetti code... but yeah refactoring doesnt mean rewriting the whole damn thing from scratch. In most cases, you implement a feature or bug fix and clean up the code while you're there so it doesnt take so long to understand the next time you have to work on it
---
The in game auto chat can be filtered bots can't and need to be ignored to stop seeing them. Using a macro to type is against the rules afaik.

Anyone remember cabbage armor?

I doubt that. If you can't run a game that often has over 100,000 players and that runs on software from the 2000s, you should not be running a business.

OSRS is a money factory.

A 3 at least.
---
Serious answer: try out rs3. I have a main there and play a HCIM on osrs. You can play with the osrs combat style if you choose and micro transactions really aren’t a big deal like everyone says (you can just ignore them if you choose. Other people can p2w but why should you care?) There is so much more content unless pking is your main interest.

---
thats fair and I agree with you. I dont see any problem with me personally not being able to experience everything, or atleast not long after it was introduced. Thing is I just really do like the game and imo its rapidly become something too different. And I really dont wanna use the word power creep, but it really is worrying me.
---
Just difference in personality I guess, I play the game to accomplish a series of goals that I set for myself. Achieving those goals **is** the game to me. Similar to real life, where you could choose to do a job that makes $100 an hour, or you can do something that nets you $10 an hour, you'll be 10x more productive if you do the $100 hour for 5 hours than the $10 an hour job for 50 hours.

Rs3 kinda fucked it up with that one, 07 follow the same path and should rescind. 
---
The Jagex team is clearly trying to make an esports platform for this game. I think the deadman mode isn’t the right way to achieve this goal. Deadman is too time consuming to be competitive, distinct advantages to teams (i.e. locking down quests or locations), and it wouldn’t be practical to have the entire player base on one stage or location. 
---
Moving three teams focus to a 1v1, 5v5, 10v10 (or any number tbh) type competitive pvp experience could be a great change of pace and more enjoyable viewing experience. Being able to follow your favorite teams through a bracket system would be really enjoyable imo. 
---
I love deadman and the first few days of a new season, and don’t want to see the game mode go away, but if we have pushed our teams efforts and time this far with things like this still happening, it may be more productive to consider if our current direction to a competitive pvp platform is working and worth investing more time and effort in. 
---
This is a super old scam. People want you to put your items on it, they recover it, you lose your items
---
Yeah fuck it. I support this 
---
Exactly.
---
The crabs are mutiplying
---
I think what they should do is adapt DMM to a Darkscape-esque mode and do what PoE does. Have one consistent server that nerver resets and then one that resets every 3 months which introduces a new mechanic to spice things up.
---
impressive
---
I agree; but maybe a better rate of pay increase to the developers who are performing well. I'd imagine that training new hires to use runecode is a pretty large time investment due to it being highly specialized, so I think they'd be better off redirecting some of those resources to keeping veterans happy with their job.
---
Yeah something like that. Could be a boss room inside the basement.
---
He's a great content creator.
---
I have experience working in shitty code bases. I have taken the route of save time now to get my feature into prod. It always comes back to bite you in the form of more wasted time later down the road than it would have taken you to do it right in the first place. 
---
My point being not refactoring means settling for lower quantity AND quality in the long run.
---
Fuck toversta.

---
They probably have devs take turns being the janitor with how limited their staff is
---
Make the summer tournament the last tournament for DMM and start focusing on the main mode and the situation PvP is in right now. You addressed these issues but there is still no concrete answer or solution for this... it feels like this problem gets pushed further behind because at some point your players will forget about it, aight?
---
What was with that bounty hunter update? Tbh, I think that got cancelled silently. 
---
Revive PvP in your MAIN GAME. That should be top priority. 
---
Make another wildy wars, do Jagex's cups (Skill/PvM/PvP). Besides DMM this should be a thing anyway to fresh up the tournament styles. 
---
And yet again you also had no plan for people who get disconnected from the game by other means than a disruption of internet services. It happens again and again and again... yet you refused to learn from it and another "couple" of players lose their chance at prize money. I feel sorry for them though. Grinding their asses off for 1 week just to lose their chance because you fucked things up. Not them.
---
DMM is a huge mess and at that point it should be buried. 
---
Atleast you admit and stand to your mistakes, but you seriously have to learn from that and make things like these never happen again. 
---
If I remember right, you have to sit on the tile closest to the ladder near the wall behind the rocks if that makes sense (like if the screen has the rocks at the bottom and the ladder to the right, it’s the bottom right most tile if that makes sense) I know I had to run out and back in to get the demon in the right spot

And the majority of those 91k are f2p bots making the numbers much closer but I am sure you also believe there are no bots on osrs.
---
Personally I play both games but calling osrs anything other than an offshoot remake of runescape is just stupid
---
笑ｗ、よくできましたね 
---
You win 
---
you don't even deserve a jmod smackdown tbh. low effort troll
---
Lol your argument/comparison is wildly false and inaccurate. 
---
No ragging is not the same as attacking a PvMer in the wilderness. 
---
What he described in his comment is literally the definition of ragging, I understand you’re an iron and have your own personal bias’ and irrational hate for anything PvP but you clearly also don’t know much about it either as demonstrated by your comments. What he’s describing is by definition, ragging now stop your nonsensical defense of this shit. 
---
Then again no real point in arguing with someone who doesn’t know what they’re talking about yet is acting like they do and are in the right. Have a great day, btw it’s ragging.
---
Oh no it’s working now. Such a shame cos the beginning is good :(

Shitpostin ain't easy

Well I want to do my leveling through slayer but will it take long to imbue a berserkers ring?
---
I'm sorry /u/SettledRS, but Animeletics &gt; Swampletics. 
---
subs &gt; dubs
---
because it's reminiscent of that hustling episode, that's why.
---
Majority? Oh you dumb dumb. You can say the majority of f2p in RS3 are botters too. You must be like 14 years old.
---
Swampletics is for ppl who legit has 0 game knowledge, videos are 20min long and legit 15minutes of completely noob infromation that someone with average game knowledge would know and would find it very boring.
---
well at 99 attack you hit more and at 99 prayer you have more prayer so i'm going to have to say you're incorrect sir
---
Go to world 301 GE if you want to beg.
---
You sound like the people i tb and kill at the ge
---
Actually the word "triggered" is my trigger word
---
If only something could have given them reasonable cause to worry about sudden issues on game day that justified keeping a handful of devs around, just in case tits started flapping towards a vlusterfuck.
---
So glad they've had this tournament as a gentle learning experience, and will invariably learn from all their mistakes before trying to host this again!

---
😂
---
Sure there are bots in rs3 but no where even close to the issues osrs has. Just scroll through the sub for a few seconds and you will see the posts about a few hundred on different worlds spamming ge. That isnt even counting the bots that are actually doing something. Go to edge furnace or lumbridge castle. Only takes a minute and a few world hops to easily find thousands of them lol
---
it used to be, is what I meant.
---
It was something literally everyone was taught when I was young. I am surprisingly more adept at using a computer than younger people and that's sort of scary, surely it should be the reverse.
---
&gt; What he’s describing is by definition, ragging
---
You're repeating that a lot as if you'll make it true. But haven't provided any argument beyond "hur durr not risking anything"
---
Can you explain this a bit more for a noob? 
---
Hacker tried getting u full profound for some reason
---
April fools? Or just lying to get attention
---
Probably an hour and a half or so with a decent set up. 
---
? The engine didn't cause the issues at the final lmao. There was just a simple mistake in the code in some of the arenas that caused damaging results.

Protip No one ever goes by the calf lifts, XP rates are comparable. 
---
We're retaliating when attacked - if they skull trick us they can even get a glory! That's bank. 
---
General advice is don't do slayer until you have high combats. Takes less overall time to train combat fast first and then slayer fast later than it does to train them simultaneously but slowly.
---
Jagex knows that someone who doesn't have the self-control to not blow all their time on OSRS would abuse Pmod powers. /s ^^but actually not /s
---
3m away from 69m total xp, sweating thinking about how I'm going to be sure I do this correctly
---
He got fcked
---
Conveniently left out some of the issues that make them look worse, like delays as players that died were not given a melee weapon &amp; their 'fix' for the arena removing all gas, which meant players could teleport out of the arena without dying. This caused further delays as a player home teleported out of the arena and caused a discrepency where 17 players remained in the 16 player bracket. Also some players' tournament efforts, not including the obvious falador players, were devalued - such as players that invested hours training prayer only for every account to be given 94 prayer.

So good you forgot how to screenshot 😬
---
&gt; Instead of just downvoting me let’s have a discussion Jesus Christ this sub is so toxic.
---
I downvoted you because you didn't read the damn blog post where your question would have been answered.
---
When you get close go to the coke pump in blast furnace, it gives 2 xp per tick.
---
It would be possible.
---
However, Jagex have an issue with the fact that there are NO developers that work in old Java environments as OSRS is built on - Game developers that were likely seasoned in these environments are likely retired, or have 20+ years experience in much newer environments and are VERY senior to be doing what is  very laborious and junior work for their experience in the industry and pay grade. 
---
The whole reason of a pure is to have a high offence at a low combat level, also a 1 def pure can't have use  rigour, augury or piety so I'm going to have to say you're the one that's incorrect.
---
And just like that

Doesn't mean anything if they don't learn.  Untested content is a problem that keeps coming up.  A "sorry guys lol" post every other week really doesn't mean anything

Why not?

Thanks dude, this is a great tip. Slayer as a skill is pretty new for me and finally starting to get my head around it. 
---
Don’t need a blow pipe to do barrows at all

Such great imagery.

Explanation:  
---
After looking through I think what they're doing is having users submit gifs and they have those gifs voted upon to make up separate parts of a movie made out of 6 chapters with 20 scenes each, so 120 gifs all together. If you manipulate the querystring in the url you can see the unfinished pages for the other chapters besides the prologue which is currently being made.
---
During the subreddit voting, they're moved to the main sequence page where they are actually voted on to be made apart of the movie as separate scenes, but you can vote for any to be made into a scene, the up voting on the actual subreddit just determines leader board position so they get more attention. (I know this because if you sort by 'new' on the non-subreddit part of the sequence subreddit there is a bunch of NSFW content.)   
---
The separate scenes, or gifs, are probably locked in after a specific amount of time, and the voting process resets itself for the next scene.
---
TL;DR:  
---
 Lame april fools day reddit event where you make a movie out of gifs.
---
Is this what boats plans to do?
---
I need someone to officiate a bench off between me and this guy
---
Flagged as won, it's there on the list of issues occurred
---
tl;dr the dimensions of the arena was wrong and the opponent went 'out of bounds', causing the game to think he won, which healed and started the teleport timer.
---
They are telling you how it works... it's as if half this sub don't have a brain.  How does "trade, giving 30% of whatever you show me" mean anything other than I'll give you 30% of whatever wealth you show me?
---
It's time to stop
---
yes it’s a fun way to level up combat while making some money! i would definitely look up who the best slayer master would be for you to get tasks from
---
Chicken Nuggets are awesome the fuck are you talking about 
---
i agree 1000%
---
 **🦀﻿🦀** 
---
Oh lol I thought it was the face when 
---
Yeah it's misleading af
---
They do it with player count too, hey use osrs player count to buff rs3s...
---
A lot of commercial gyms use hardwood floors for the machine area to deter people from using free weights in these areas. Free weights are considered intimidating and machines are not, hence why gyms don't want them mixed.

---
once every 4 hours you can buy x amount of an item.
---
this gives you the ability to test the margin of an item by buying it at a high price and selling it at a low price. 
---
you then use the remaining amount available to buy the limit at or around the low price and attempt to sell them at or around the high price. 
---
you can basically do this for any item.

So should i wait till April 15th before i post my collection logs? I wilk add to it surely between now and then. 
---
How about taking some responsibility?
---
I don't think you would want to be on for the t-bow shit that happened, so many people who were grinding for hours lost all of their exp.
---
Exactly, had 2mil in scrolls when I checked them last night. Didn't sell them, but next time I price check them it would just make it less annoying.
---
An entire barrows set? The odds of anyone nailing out a full barrows set is just nuts 
---
Event managers and coordinators, always should know what worst case scenarios can be, and to have a plan in place if it starts to go south. Honestly I think what happend this tournament is the worst thing that possibly could have happened. If the broadcast failed, or server crashed it would be easier understood.  Why it is even possible to go into final hour and get 6 hr logged is gross negligence.  Final hour should happen on a fresh world that everyone just logged onto, which will give jagex a snapshot of every account, and a rollback point incase SHTF.
---
Well the person was making idiotic claims lol.
---
Not sure what you are pointing out.
---
Thank you
---
I like how they did not even bother to link to the forums for discussion.
---
I feel you but on the other hand I can’t imagine that this would take that much time at all. 
---
Woooosh
---
What about Manked inexplicably getting his HP and prayer back? Why is that not in the timeline...?
---
Make a collection of these u/ClubPeter they're great, you can make a Patreon and get paid for them weekly etc. They really bring about emotions for all of us and there are so many funny mining, wc etc spots this could be great to see. Also other funny RS quirks and your art style is perfect and funny for bringing them to life correctly 😂🙏👑 do it! $
---
Bruh got farming pet my first time I met that Jayden kid, he's good luck.
---
Manked's perspective, with the chat bar, shows the moment he gets flagged as winning and tells him he will be teleported in 30s.
---
False. Being adequately prepared does not necessarily mean u need a button to do it. Some things aren't worth automating. Like time for rollback, specific details, etc. Even if they were prepared, entering a simple command into terminal or modifying a bit of code with the time hard-coded into it or sosmthing would probably (definitely) not be possible for people with no comp Sci experience even tho it's a "simple" fix. Don't get me wrong, jagex is a goofy company and the team has made mistakes... But to suggest that most of you could do any better.... yall are delusional and clearly have no education let alone experience in these fields. 
---
Nothing here about Manked inexplicably getting his HP and prayer back?
---
This is no grand insight though. Plainly obvious that the glaring inherent problem with HCIM mode is that people disconnect because connections are never stable 24/7. How long you keep the HCIM status is mostly how lucky you are with your Internet connection. Fuck a game mode like that where 1000s of hours of effort can be lost due to ISP routine maintenance, power cut, housemate/family member turning off the router by accident etc. (all of which you have no control over).
---
You're not even responding to my comments you just keep arguing with yourself 😂 bye bud 
---
Yay, can't avoid that tired shit in other subs now either. Woo.
---
G l o p
---
Well, you're obviously the expert.
---
He explains in detail why it's probably not as simple as you assume. Check out the scenario he constructed when two players are in PvP combat. He is making very good points, and none of it was idiotic. You're coming off as the idiot here.
---
Shouldn’t his cape be red?

What would two players in combat have to do with how information is stored in a database?

---
you read the post ? im not mad it happens, i asked a question how does the authentication fail. Not out here blaming jagex or asking for my stuff . Where do you infer I claim no responsibility? ran multiple scans in safemode etc, no malware. my guess is a db leak from not having updated shit on mobile. Which is fine, but that doesnt answer how authentication failed.
---
Pretty sure he's already started a new account and plans to 200m all on it aswell, so I think he would lol.
---
So they were definitely adequately prepared this time. You really don't get this lmao, quit pretending you know your shit. Nobody is saying janitors should be running the show. They're saying it shouldn't require a dev to sit in till 3am you moron.

Hey, thanks for the advice mate! I was wondering, lets say i go with like blowpipe or dragon boots, how much do i buy the for and sell them the first time? If that makes any sense xD thank you!
---
I’m over here scratching my head wondering how both these posts even got 1k upvotes in the first place 🤔
---
Can you read?
---
&gt;Even if they had a system that allowed this to happen, they're still going to have consistency issues with regular backups. It takes time to do a backup. Even if it only takes a few seconds, that means some players are going to have their game state a few seconds older than other people. This means you can have weird situations, like if player A kills player B but the game is rolled back
---
Do they really get paid $28k? I'm surprised they've been able to hire any developers at all. 
---
But thanks for being a gentleman about it, i really appreciate the class 
---
The agility shortcut absolutely kills me lmao especially the wizards at the end 
---
Usually just use the +5% and -5% button, since they aren't huge in value, you'll make that cost back with 1 flip and the rest of the item limit will be pure profit.
---
Nah the grad world in UK is a hard one. Get what your given

---
I've been trying to think of a good way to keep this thread available at all times for months since it functionally is the subreddit...I've been saying we should post official jagex newsposts and updates in the sidebar and just leave this stickied but idk
---
What are you trying to point out? Backups are generally a few moments of time in history. This is expected...
---
Upvote for suis la lune and raein!
---
I’m aware they are there for anyone who they can kill.  It’s disgusting how you cannot seem to understand the frustration some of the people in the community have from being killed by a team of pkers.

---
Next stop 73,737,373
---
That’s assuming their System Admins have that ability (lets be honest it is 2019 if you don’t have this ability you’re doing it wrong). Incremental back ups are one thing but in order to process all the information going on (switching to fog etc) I’m sure would be a huge project but guess what it HAS to be done. If jagex wants these tournaments to be taken seriously in the gaming community they have to have a serious DR plan for these reoccurring issues.
---
You should give it a try sometime, it’s a really fun skill. Once you get a rhythm going you end up being 6 hour kicked in no time.
---
lmaoing at the people downvoting you because it doesnt fit their narrative
---
Should certainly be ironman mode, start off with a baseline of decent items to help get over the very start, but not so much that it is just easy. Just kind of a jumpstart in a way.
---
Think like, 50k, 100 sharks, iron armour, 500x basic runes, 150x other runes, etc.
---
This would be interesting to say the least...
---
I believe this is an animation error on the part of SWAMP studios the animating team behind the anime

An idea and an idea that has a good execution are two separate things. Out of I believe 13 DMMT maybe 4 have gone “smoothly”. That track record alone is enough to lead to people being skeptical of their tournaments.

well, i played rs3 for 2 years nonstop, only 1 break of 2 months cuz i was hospitalized, i maxed, i comped, i almost got the master quest cape (all quests + a bunch of quest achievements which can take ages), i got rich thru my own means and only now did i get bored of the game

its april fools good try troll

Lmao
---
I've played a lot of OSRS for over a year, and then went to RS3 for about a month now. Here's my take:
---
OSRS advantages:
---
* Populated
---
* Mobile released officially on both Android and iOS
---
RS advantages:
---
* Modern graphics and consistent animations
---
* Performance on the official client is decent
---
* More quests and content in-general
---
* Combat is more like traditional MMORPGs and more action-orientated
---
* Various QoL (toolbelt, currency pouch, lodestones)
---
* Daily challenges
---
* More items are usable without a disadvantage (Cape of Legends got buffed today actually; can use weapons like claws, maces, swords, etc instead of having scimitar bis everywhere)
---
* Monster weaknesses actually exist and provide clear type advantage/disadvantages (Hill Giants go down with air magic a lot easier than ranged or melee; not wise to just take melee everywhere like in OSRS)
---
A lot of people here seem to dismiss RS3 has "ez-scape" or a MTX-ridden mess, but this isn't something I've seen at all when I gave RS3 an actual chance.
---
I mean likely there would be multiple different categories I’m assuming main/1 def/ mid lvls etc. to say main hybriding takes no skill is silly. Though I can agree main hybriding does have a good bit more opportunity for catch up if you miss a prayer swap, don’t time a freeze right etc.
---
She aint messin' with no broke niggas
---
you tied ezscape to money pouch, and we both know that costume clients are ezscape, therefore, they are quite the same
---
still think they are completely different? then look at it this way: by using certain functions of costume clients you save a few seconds, and the money pouch achieves the same goal  
---
so, what \*is\* the difference?
---
Being hacked via. the recovery system.
---
RAT e-mail hacks
---
I feel like jegflox just never has the appropriate systems in place to prevent them from fucking up. It's not just DMM even though they fuck that up several times a year, but also shit like the coin pouch bug where they weren't even sure it was gonna work. And in general there should be systems in place stopping them from pushing code into production that spawns tbows in random places and gives people max cash.
---
Good stuffs. Thanks for making this for us.

I love how people spend all this time making crazy regex when really you just need a couple key words, this basically filters everything for me - youtube,[Automated],usd,junk,swap,cheapest,teamviewer,bet!,[LOSE]
---
Up to you but I found the best way to learn Zulrah was from a website (Zulrah Helper) by Joseph’s Place on YouTube
---
Think this only answers to the point where the "loser" was on 4hp and Manked got Full food/prayer and also inv filled with supplies. Not to the point where Manked was actually losing-situation casting blood barrage and  suddenly got to FULL HP AND PRAYER.
---
This should definately be answered also, without this thing happening in the first place theres a chance that the later thing wouldve never happened.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/LazyFriendlyShrimpGivePLZ](https://clips.twitch.tv/LazyFriendlyShrimpGivePLZ)
---
Thanks to you and OP, had to go listen to that song again. One of my favorites.
---
From my formal education of regex, the one thing I learned is that regex can be a nightmare to manipulate correctly. The reason I only use the above filter is because it's so simple that it leaves very little room to have unintended results. That example looks complex enough that even having a single character misplaced could completely break the filter, so I'd recommend just going piece by piece in regexr to see what the minimum regex you need is to get the results you want.

From what I can see as an experienced pker, there's no time for getafweeze to move anywhere other than where his character appeared. He bolts manked from right in front of him, you can tell by the projectile of the bolt. He then runs towards the middle. It really does not make any sense

&gt; All low level Slayer is terrible up to level 50. (Bloodvelds) . And from there it gets decent. Why are spiritual creatures so literally garbage and useless until level 83 when you unlock the mages? Who even wants to fight the other spiritual creatures? Literally nobody.
---
Low level slayer is bad, but a mid level player can make use of Nieve and get good loot even from shit task. She gives a ton of points as well so you can skip the really painful ones like Black Demons. 
---
&gt; Agility: Agility has such a small effect on run energy replenishment it's unbelievable. I believe you replenish a little faster every 6 LEVELS? Jesus. Rooftops + Graceful was a great addition to the skill at least. However, a the good shortcuts that a mid level could use either don't exist in the game or are only available at very high agility levels.
---
Well you do get 3x more energy per minute at 99 agility versus 1 agility, but that's still bad. The shortcuts can be quite nice for mid levels, at 73 you get the trollheim shortcut which saves like 30s of running every time you do a herb run. 70 for taverley blue draogns. 66 for faster cosmic runecrafting. For the most part only higher leveled ones are useful, so I do think you have a good point here. Could make the lower leveled ones better, such as the underground tunnel connecting Port Sarim and Draynor being faster.
---
&gt; Runecrafting: Lol, what's the point of even training this as a mid level main? Seriously? 
---
Runecrafting is a very good money maker. You can get 1m+ profit per hour doing stuff like double nats, double astral, wrath rune, etc. These are fairly high level though, with low leveled methods like doing astrals at 40 you can get like 300k gp/h, which is still quite nice for lower leveled players. Also 77 unlocks fremmy elite which is needed if you ever wanna make good money off DKS.
---
&gt; Smithing: Why do you need level 40 to wear rune but LEVEL 90 to make it?! What on Earth? Can't we change this so mid levels can actually benefit from having a decent Smithing level?
---
Smithing is hot garbage, yeah. Should be reworked somehow, as it stands all bar prices rely on high alch values and only cballs and dart tips are actually being smithed. 
---
Well, your first mistake is pretty obvious. You should be using a bone crossbow spec instead of a dwh.
---
I started base 70, but you're probably fine

I hate anime but ur a faget

Because content developers aren’t in charge of the engine, nor do they need to know Java for their job. That’s the engine team.

[This](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/6/6f/Skullball_Boss.png) is what they look like up close. It's just the angle and the zoom out of it.

A high ass Harry Potter 
---
Your stats are not even close to being high? Do you even have barrows gloves yet?
---
With those stats your best bets are slayer or barrows. But I would just focus on training your stats so you can do some real money makers.(like getting range level up so you can do vorkath) 
---
Yeah but you don’t have the stats to earn those pieces of armor as drops. Unless you have like 75 slayer, I’d just keep training slayer till you get there.
---
And only right now?? What a time to be alive
---
i quit at 58 slayer lvl 75ish combat. killing trolls etc so unrewarding. lucky wildy slayer exists and years l8er i came back and made bank doing that and it was fun
---
The worthwhile grind is getting closer to useful levels and eventually 99. This new age mindset of... gimme gimme gimme I need to be rewarded for every lil thing I do really bothers me. If your not enjoying the game just don’t play. U don’t need to be spoon fed rewards every second of the day
---
No no, I meant to earn the money to purchase them. Sorry I wasn't clear. I'm just looking for a way that I can earn good money while training melee.
---
This makes me want to set fire to shit.
---
Idk how crypto works but would it be possible to make a rs coin thats tied to the black market value of gp?
---
I do this to hopefully achieve precision in my filtering.
---
For yours, if someone said like "what's the cheapest food to use?" or "do you watch swampletics on youtube?" you'll wrongly block their messages.
---
Also it doesn't block all messages. If a bot says "bet" or "bet." or "sw ap", you'll miss em too.
---
What I did basically was stand in w301, 302, 330 GE and refine my filter if any slips pass, and also disable it to see if i get any false positives
---
That is the appropriate response lmfao
---
If your a poor noob now. You’d be a poor noob on fresh servers as well
---
No I understand what you meant. What is your slayer?
---
look at this d00d
---
It’s common sense. 
---
Oh, absolutely, there's definitely more that can be done that hasn't yet, but to their credit, they definitely haven't done **nothing** from the past mistakes.
---

you do realise they stay in your inventory if you die with them

Oh I’m a noob??? Fuck

Holy fuck. You aware? 
---
much better
---
The guy makes videos on Flat Earth, sungazing, vegan diets being dangerous while promoting eating raw meat, and probably half a dozen other things I could find if I took the time to look. There is no way it's a decade old, persistent troll.
---
So for everyone wondering what I did, I played tonight. Dude gave me a cannon + 3k balls. Sold it all had some cash already transfered it to my actual account and added him to the ignore list. Free 1.5m feelsgoodman
---
Jagex might fuck up alot, but i'll take the clumsy devs (they aren't clumsy, the code they deal with is ancient garbage) over the devs that think they know whats best for the game and don't care about community feedback.
---
Attractive women don't play runescape, she's probably a cat fish, lets be real.
---
Awesome! I have all those down now I suppose it’s just up to gear now

Why do I feel like /r/iceposeidon2 and /r/2007scape are feeling the same shift. 
---
Welcome to members!
---
It's a bit of a big question you're asking, but a good place to start is to read [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide). 
---
Also and most importantly never try to buy or sell an account or gold or other stupid stuff. Never enter you information on random sketchy websites. Do that and there is a 0% chance you will ever even have to worry if your pin may expire before you log back in since no one will be able to access your account.
---
Well you see son, sometimes when a mommy and a daddy love each other verrrrry much...

Because Twitch are a bunch of dickheads that make mountains of money but won't invest it back into the website. 
---
I’m just disappointed that we had this reflection about answering questions a week before. Specifically about fixes and to avoid them with more testing.
---
So a big tournament would be a great time to show off thorough testing with a beta play through especillay considering 1vs1’s was extended from 128&gt;256.
---
I think it was amazing they managed to get a the rest of the tournament going. Doing so much manually.
---
4 stroke gang try it out homie

Pestal and mortar*

Damn.  Thanks

I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.
---
Piss on me, beat me. 
---
I guess we'll agree to disagree
---
Minimum wage for minimum work.
---
I think I have twice? Though those scenes have already been locked. I have no idea how you're supposed to find a gif that's already been posted without re submitting it for a new scene.
---
I'll have to check it out when I get back from work, but we'll probably have to choose a scene/post to upvote and focus our efforts.
---
What did I just watch?
---
You'll make the money back in runes kraken drops
---
Bis non degradable stats what more can you ask for and you can afford. The profit margins is high
---
I see on so many 'easiest bosses in osrs' videos people putting KQ on the same level as KBD and stuff, that was the basis for my comment

would've covered name, you'll be hacked within a day or two

The odds are so low it makes me think that it may be an inside job. 
---
Yeah I have barrows gloves and I kill zulrah. Currently 70 agil, working towards 71 for the summer pie boost.
---
meh, worth the sacrifice to miss a little bit of real chat to block all of the garbage
---
Upvote as long as it's not a clue scroll reward, bored of everything being a cluescroll reward now
---
Suffering absolutely. Once you get a suffering your next upgrade should be getting an Necklace of Anguish and a Tormented Bracelet. Next I'd get augury, big magic upgrade and it's a permanent unlock. Once you get those you can buy the smaller cheap stuff like Eternal Boots and D'hide boots. 
---
Untrimmed agility training agility, eh you can have it
---
I agree but I think the video's great enough that it doesn't make much of a difference.
---
Thank you so much for that link!
---
Also thanks for welcoming me, really glad this community is so open about helping others.
---
I have the prayers already. But i don't have to spend all of it. Going to go with the lance, and I don't really have enough for much else. But should be good to get the hang of it. thanks
---
Work towards desert treasure, it’s difficult the first time but all in all a good/fun quest line and you get to see a lot of members content along the way!
---
Well here's an example. At level 90, I unlock the ability to Smith rune. Why can't I unlock that at level 40 instead? That entire grind is pointless is what I mean. 
---
Yes I unlock alot, but all of those unlocks are literally pointless
---
What would it take to do 'desert treasure'?
---
Devalues my lvl 20 wilderness locked f2p hardcore Ironman.

Looks to me like that boi takes what he wants.
