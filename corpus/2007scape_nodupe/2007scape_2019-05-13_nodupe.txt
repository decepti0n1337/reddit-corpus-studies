Tbf if they can‚Äôt overcome 96 herblore they probably can‚Äôt do the end game PVM content which it would be useful for. You wouldn‚Äôt need overloads for kbd anyway.
---
---
---
people vote no for those, because those that have "suffered" through the grind will go to hell and back to make sure others suffer as well. Nobody is allowed to get it easier.
---
I'm not saying blowpipe isn't op, I'm in a thread directly comparing the opness of blowpipe and chaotic rapier.
---

---
The rapier emphasized the opness of curses and summoning and multiplied them basically. Blowpipe is by itself atleast and costs money to use.
---
Cant you cast snare on the imps to make it easy?
---
If the rewards are going to be shit, the requirements shouldn't also be shit. I would be more pissed if I had to grind out a long skill to get a shit reward.
---
Falador is super useful for inferno, kandarian is teleports to sherlock which saves a fair bit of time clue hunting, and the bolt spec on the hard diary is REALLY nice there isnt anything like that in any of the tiers. Western hard is elite void, it just feels dead on arrival.
---
Wait, have you been out of the loop for years?
---
I did this when rapier was released. It gave me a huge nostolgia rush to have a rapier in osrs (reminded me of chaotic rapier). At the time it was like 90% of my bank and it fell in price by almost 300m, but I still don't care. It was fun and worth it to me and money starts to come pretty easy once you do pvm. I'd say just do whatever seems fun to you. U can always resell it if you get bored.
---
People are going to have a meltdown if they suddenly are forced to work further on content that they've previously completed. Specifically because the western diaries deals with things like elite void, there's tons of people (including myself) that aren't going to want to come back and work on content that we've already completed just so we can raid/pvm in our elite void sets. It makes more sense just to implement the suggestion I saw on here a few days ago with "the outlands" diary or whatever that guy called it, where diaries for places like fossil island, prif, and other areas are combined into a new full length diary.
---
Not everyone with an opinion is a "brick wall". If you're gonna react that way if someone doesn't change his opinion after 2 comments there's no point in even starting an argument.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna add to the blowpipe comments, that thing is broken af. It‚Äôs crazy.
---
[deleted]
---
And this above method covers cost of cballs and pulls 1m and hour ?
---
Yeah exactly that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt include raids lol
---
if i buy membership today, will the next ones get cheaper? i used to play a lot but they fucking made it twice the price so its very expensive now to pay, is there even a better way to get better prices? mind that im not one of those players that have thousand of bots in my control and also dont make 9999 billion per second like some people do so i just cant keep buying membership throught those membership-giving thingy
---
If you‚Äôre making super attack pots you‚Äôre doing it wrong bud. Super str is almost always cheaper, and I‚Äôm 100% positive there‚Äôs other better ways.

Is it just me or is GingerBeardie the pinnacle of exaggerating every minor emotion and situation for comedic effect
---
What? Are you saying blowpipe and t bow are OP inside inferno?
---
I dont see how BoB's were devastating to the economy at all, all it did was allow extended PVE sessions without having to back out.

---
Looks like a surprised guy haha!
---
Love the rings, great job!
---
After a month or 2 of buying membership it should be easy to sustain with bonds. It‚Äôs more expensive per month than it was back in the day, but now you have the option of not paying at all.
---
What's actually excessive is leaving two comments lol
---
better effort than most osrs streamers. sitting in here and really having a good laugh.
---
No, as in if they nerf BP and TBow they could potentially add in a condition for the weapons to keep their original stats inside the Inferno.
---
Ye i also like him, i just find the whole twitch vibe super artificial.
---
bounds where always too expensive for me to buy in game, and its the same price or even more expensive if im not wrong when buying with real money
---
What was the req they took out?
---
Unrelated but I think at those stats you would be the same level if you got 99 range
---
how do you like him but find it artificial ?
---
Oh ok, misunderstood, my bad. 
---
On another note, I don't see why a weapon that costs 1.15b and is bis at a handful of bosses needs a nerf.
---
Oh god was this from begging? Or looting bsale drops?
---
Will you be continuing the Pok√©mon for each skill drawings? I really enjoyed the last one and looking forward to the next!
---
Bud stop using the bold test so much lmao. People aren‚Äôt as dumb as you think, we get the idea that eight level 70‚Äôs is a lot, and and that the armor being degradable is bad.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. If you pay for membership for ~2 months on a brand new account you can easily get to the point where bonds aren‚Äôt too expensive and maintainable with gp. You just need to spend your time wisely
---
If something is rare it‚Äôs ok to be op omegalul
---
Tbf scythe costs like 1k per hit and costs like 1.5B.
---
Hahaha. It's a bit dramatic maybe.

Btw hell yes it would be, imagine another iron at a festival trying to trade me kandis, the IRONY!

Thanks for the input my dudes. What darts should I use for the pipe? Rune?

Wrong game dude. You want rs3

if you buy a house, you cannot lose it. 
---
if it is not in rimmington, attempting to enter the portal will tell you where your house is.
---
using a house teleport tab (no mage lvl required) from the GE will take you to your house. if you exit the portal you will also see where your house is.
---
edit: there's also a chance you haven't built any rooms yet, enter building mode to do this (makes the walls transparent)
---
if none of these things work, then i think you don't own a house and need to go talk to the estate agent again.
---
i had my whole clan report him and throw snowballs go cc "ge surplus"
---
Yes.

/u/Ledence made a RuneLite regex filter that I use. It removes most spam from dice bots / trout sellers / scammers. Linky: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/biu8og/runelite_chat_filter_regex/

I think in some way it is. Kind of a way to show that in the world of Runescape, all things stem from the earth and there is a rhyme and reason for everything's place in nature.
---
Who tf does this in ahrims

they could but it would require a shit ton of work, plus they would need a team of graphic designers for any new content that would come out

People bring imbued heart for blood barrage and maging def for the minion because there's no downside. However you'd prefer to have the additional mage and range accuracy from the armadyl helm, or just a verac's helm for the melee minion.

That is literally the reason it ruined the economy. Right now doing super long trips to GWD requires a modicum of skill or alts as a single player. With bobs it didnt.

The appeals come off as "perm banned for macroing, final decision." It's funny because half the accounts didn't come past the first chickenfarm. Definitely an IP thing as there's nothing fishy in game going in. I been bugging the mods for a week now, they don't seem to care yet. I will try a private proxy today because yea, maybe VPN's already flagged.

Unlikely considering they are at an all time high right now

I'm est also, I'm usually on around 8-9ish.

I have no problems with maxed players having access to better spots. They deserve it.
---
Though we seem to have differing views about mid-level multiplayer content. You think it's a waste of time to create content for people who can't even put enough time to level up their stats. That's a valid point. And I'm almost inclined to agree. But this absence of mid-level content is preventing me from playing with my friends as a group. And I want us to have fun as a group. This is solved right away by leveling up stats to the point where we can do Raids. But again, that's the problem. I can't force them to grind base 80s just to raid. They're awesome people. Just don't have enough time to grind levels.
---
So there we go, we both have our own reasons. And I know yours is valid. Maybe we can just happily disagree.
---
Side note: One thing I liked about EoC is how it basically made everything multicombat. I would get my low-level friend to "tag" a monster so he can get the drops and exp, then help him kill it. Even on free worlds we had fun because everywhere is basically multiplayer content lol.
---
I want a pet dog from summoning tho
---
But why‚Äôd they have to settle for his mercy
---
Have addressed this argument literally 6 times throughout this thread already
---
I don't  see why having a mini diary is such a big problem that we would need to add it on top of western prov. 
---
The rewards for area diaries typically apply to large areas, the prif diary is only for prif and nowhere else (with exception to the global yield increase on alloments)
---
or just earn double that on a minimum wage job lol
---
ahrim
---
Guess he should have just scammed lmao
---
Oof
---
Nice.
---
Everyone says blowpipe but frankly it depends how much money you have.
---
Blowpipe is fastest dps but is not going to be cheap. You can just as easily use a crossbow with broad bolts
---
And dscim instead of whip like his name suggests
---
The whole Idea of showing how nice the RS community is by lying and scamming them is hilarious
---
Kandis the bear monster from the quest in the fremmy mountains?
---
i‚ÄôM sMaRt
---
That's irrelevant to the OP's statement though. There IS a relatively high xp way of training runecrafting at the expense of being more click intensive, it already exists. That being lower xp than other skills, doesn't matter. It's a slow skill
---
Don‚Äôt get herpes
---
Gotcha. And something else you should know. When everyone was crying about the Inferno and ToB "needing BIS gear" and all that, they were being spoiled and entitled brats. Even if they RWTed BIS gear, they couldn't do it cuz of the mechanics needed for certain end-game content.
---
Just because the Gauntlet doesn't have any gear requirements doesn't mean it'll be catered to casuals. I don't think you guys will wanna waste that much time learning new content. From what I can see, we have different things we enjoy in the game and you wouldn't enjoy the maximum efficiency shit I do 24/7.
---
As a matter of fact, this opened up my mind a little and made me want them to make a raiding system or whatever for mid-leveled players.
---
I‚Äôm definitely down
---
Why does every new pirece of content need to be a meta changer? That's straight up power creep and not what the game needs
---
The worst of types of humans
---
Oh that's wonderful 730ish is ussually when post work stuff is all done.

I'll add you tomorrow!
---
Mordhaus will be the name.
---
Tell you what, if you hit 75 range in the next 24 hours of me posting this I'll give you a Blowpipe. Pm me on reddit and I'll give you my rsn.
---
I'm sure OP is well aware of this. I'm assuming OP is questioning why, given the amount of reports this player received, is this player not banned yet
---
I do have a whip i was just afraid to lose it in the final battle for the barrows gloves quest 
---
also i used a whip mix on it (the white color)
---
uh i've never seen all the trees down at once, and getting at most half the logs/tree slows down things a ton.
---
Idk you ever been to Witnertodt?
---
it's not even long, most of used rune crossbows, crystal bows or karils xbows with 75-80~ range for our first firecapes. 2 hours vs 1hr 30 is not a big deal for a first cape
---
See you then man.
---
Honestly since verac is so cheap i do recommend doing that, because verac skirt gives +5 pray bonus which is massive. Cant remember what helm gives. Use a blessed d hide body if cant afford karils top (karils gives more range/mage def, blessed top gives more melee, but karils I use because you'll be tanking the ranger and praying mage and you'll trap the melee dude or pray melee) then blessed boots, which have gotten cheap as well. 
---
Now this is a super tank setup - however i think its by far the best way to go about doing fire cape startin out. You'll want to minimize the damage taken while learning waves. :) 
---
Also my last tip is dont get to frustrated, and when you get to jad make sure to do 1 action per jad attack. I.e; one sip of potion, one click to attack a healer to aggro them, etc then focus back on jad and switching prayer. Most people die because they try doing to much and end up switching pray to late. You also feel jittery because of how long it took to get to jad and you end up trying to hard and make a mistake. Try your best to stay laxed. Also your first attempt is gonna be your best experience for figuring out what inventory setup youll need. For example I was low hp, only 45 pray and 60 def. I needed more prayer than brews because i used purple sweets as well to negate how many brews id need. Most guides suggest like 10-12 brews and 10-12 super restores but i needed more like 7-8 brews and 14-15 restore.
---
 :D
---
Depends how much money you have
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHQHAHAHAHAHAH

ok can i do it in time with sand crabs? im going there right now :D

I don't use 75% of my diary rewards but gotta have that cape fam

Getting all ahead of myself and forgetting my manners lol. Happy Mothers Day to you as well if that applies!

Tomorrow then!
---
Oh I thought he really meant wildly. As in he being scared of the tasks. Didn't realize it was a typo.
---
Time to stop doing solo
---
Everyone roasting OP but he's not wrong. You don't need any verification to create a new account where as other online games require simply a confirmation email. We have this only for authenticator/stronghold...
---
Sure you can do it that way. I'll check your stats when you get the 75 to make sure you're not bluffing. Just remember to pm me. I recommend using mithril darts at sandcrabs.
---
i must've done something to my room in my house pls respond asap thanks

Would love to see Dharoks

Very cool tho

Arghhh!

As you level up you can fish more fish. Not just shrimp and anchovies, might of sped up the grind for ya.

You do realize clan chats have a skill total requirement, right? He's using *three* accounts. Right click -&gt; report and ignore. Stop being stupid.

What‚Äôs the purple thing
---
It is tho.
---
Because of the spammers saying which houses are open to prayer, its much less people hosting now, especially since 5 of the hosts got perma muted and arent hosting again.
---
How does it feel being &lt;1500 total and talking about end game bossing when the only pvm you do is slayer and occasional barrows?
---
I'm pretty sure most pures (hell even most pkers) aren't pking for profit - yes it's a bonus to profit from your kills but most are pking for the fun of it/competition.
---
I don't know why your risk would factor into whether you're "hot shit" or not.
---
Only on the top level
---
Kind of like smithing level 40 armor at 99
---
Serenic armor is fashion :) third age version would fit nicely
---
You might be bringing too many switches. I don't bother with more than 3/4 at a time
---

What is everybody's thoughts on the use of scouting bots in the wilderness? Should Jagex issue bans to the abusers of these bots instead of just the accounts being botting on? 
---
Genuinely interested, had an incident today.
---
I believe my UIM got pked as a result of these. Lost literally everything I had today and would like to see these scouting bots shut down, we have been seeing a major increase in UIM getting pked and I know that this is no coincidence. These people are actually ruining UIM mode, there's literally nothing you can do after getting pked on an Ultimate Ironman and our only option is to quit the game.
---
Pretty hurt that it happened, but I don't know if I should be. Idk what to so so I think I'm quitting, but I'd like to see Jagex release a statement on how they will handle these/if they will allow them.
---
If any of you have some other incidents with these bots, or opinion of these bots, please tell me, I'm genuinely interested
---
Edit: didn't add the part about my UIM to complain, it was my fault, didn't bring a reliable teleport and I mistoke the accounts around me as looting bots
---
Should I buy an anguish or save up for rigor? 107 CB 95 range. I mostly just do slayer in the game and don't grind money making methods, so the cash flow is slow. I do plan on doing MM2 in the next month or so, so should I just wait until I can get my own zenytes?
---
No it's not. Doesn't change the fact that if people are buying that much gold/accounts, obviously there are lower tiers that people buy. Dipshit
---
If they are breaking rules they have to pay the price, no auto-typing mean no auto-typing. Use the auto-typing feature built into the game. :D
---
If they added a weapon that you'd have to charge by running and it did guaranteed 75 damage per hit, but its effective DPS was significantly lower than alternatives, would you say that's unbalanced too?
---
No mention of revs? Protected revs are easily 6m in alchs per hr
---
Sounds like Korasi.
---
They did but if you had it installed you can continue using it since apple doesn‚Äôt remove pre-existing installs.
---
Yea and make it high skill cap, having to use every spell in the book (lol) to defeat it
---
&gt;  If arclight didn't exist I think mage only would be the meta way to kill sire
---
No chance, imo. Mage is just too expensive to justify using at bosses unless it's the *only* option (eg kraken, Rex, etc.). Even hasta is competitive enough dps-wise that the cost different would make mage unattractive.
---
No, they should use the auto typer feature that the game has already instead of external auto typers, or they should make a new in game way to advertise hosts.
---
Lmao jagex won't ban him, they dont Care about pvp
---
yo this would be pog af
---
I'm not particularly concerned about it, personally speaking. I also don't condone this type of behavior - best if everyone can enjoy themselves, even if I'm not bothered about it myself.
---
Maybe crystal armor wasn't a good idea to begin with, especially when they're very clearly lacking any creative ideas for it. 
---
Oh man. If only a ammo slot item that buffed the crystal bow could've been suggested and talked by the devs as one of the rewards for the gauntlet. 
---
Oh wait.

Just in case any new ironmen are reading this, my friend and I both did wintertodt until mid 70s before getting magic logs. It could very easily have taken longer but the gp, seeds, and food that you get from wintertodt made a lot of the early game grinds ezpz. So even if you do end up going dry it is still going to be beneficial even if you don't intend on getting 99.

Can compost be taken out of the bottomless compost bucket? Say I want to sell some ultracompost in the bottomless bucket, can I use the bottomless bucket on an empty bucket to put ultracompost in it? That way I can sell a bucket of compost at the GE. I don't have a bottomless compost bucket, but I might buy one.

I wish they still put this much effort into NPCs that are somewhat irrelevant, really made the game feel much more immersive. Half the NPCs in Zeah are only examinable and have no dialogue.

I noticed my previous home world got a 20-30ms increase in latency but this was a month or two ago. I figured they just moved the server. Beside that no I haven't noticed much

I'm not sure if they even go in with the goal of making the best style ranged for a boss. Twisted bow/bp are too busted and just end up being good everywhere.

Slayer
---
haha im not even mad about it cause im guilty of waiting to see if someone will go sometimes. But ill watch people stand at the unload point like the guy in in the pic. They'll wait long enough to fix it 5 times and gain some smithing xp before I finally just run the wheels for them.
---
If you wanna be a cheap ass like I am sometimes just use fire bolt with chaos gauntlets. If you got a bit of money to spend tho just use your strongest spell from the standard book.

I wonder what kind of a conversation I'd have if RuneLite didn't exist. People would get clue scrolls with slidey puzzles that are clearly not fun and would take 20 minutes. If I suggested Jagex just get rid of them, I'd get yelled at like I am in this thread, but RuneLite does exist so everyone is ultra happy to just skip the boring shit. 
---
I think what feels weird is that a game like Runescape feels like it should have quests, but most of the quests are terribly implemented and have very few redeeming qualities. Runescape is a game with a great concept of grinding up characters that (at least at the onset when you leave tutorial island) are generic and you have to level them up through a grind, but with a lot of really terrible implementation. Quests are among this bad implementation and in my opinion, they're beyond saving. An opt out method would just be good, considering how bad most of them are.

Someone tried to PK me at the wilderness agility course. I was running away by going up and down the ladder (200 IQ). An onlooker said "Km". What does "Km" mean?
---
Most likely doesn't get enough attention IRL so he does whatever it takes to be the centre of attention for a few seconds
---
Stab and mage. Trident of the sea, iban blast and Slayer dart are all acceptable choices, in that order from best to worst. For melee probably want at least a zammy hasta.

gp/gear is much more of a limiting factor than combat stats, and you only need about 10-20m in gear to do cox. its very accessible if thats what someone wants to do

Only downside is they don't have any good drops, if that is important.
---
I really honestly unsure which part you are upset about. If it‚Äôs the bots spamming  ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù the simple solution is turning public chat off at the ge. You could also report them which adds them all to your ignore list if you don‚Äôt want to turn off public because you like hanging out at the ge for social purposes. If it‚Äôs that the bots are there in the first place I just don‚Äôt know why you would be bothered by it so much. Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but these bots aren‚Äôt farming gold or taking resources from other players. They aren‚Äôt trying to scam other players. It‚Äôs just some troll thinking it would be funny to trigger people. Bots have been and continue to be an issue in OSRS but there are simply bigger fish to fry my friend.
---
Well it‚Äôs your lucky day! The Wildy and, by entension, PvP has been dead for quite some time (outside of Revs and Pures rushing in PvP worlds)! :D

Imagine being mad about getting killed in a PvP zone though.

No but bottomless bucket is 100% worth

I know this is bait but I cant help but laugh at this

Brings back memories for sure... I was there at the same time... maybe we even crossed paths!

yes

go whine to your daddy u freak.

Same I don't pvm nether do any Skilling,quests or minigames, all of these are a vote no to polls.

The downfall of rs2(3) started in 2007-2008 and eoc wasnt actually the worst part of it, summoning, insane xp buffs and second hd rework were some of the worst..

Let me know when you're done mom said its my turn with the blowpipe next.

Guess it was kind of a dumb question actually looking at the drops. Must‚Äôve been begging.

I would be amazed if there was not , unless you have some odd account build

Apperantly you have to actually click on the link to see the clip pretty DISGUSTING upvoted because this guy deserves a ban.

Agility is the most aggravatingly unrewarding skill in this game by far. I‚Äôm in the process of finishing DS2 and I fell 10+ times with 73 ability during the ship navigation portion.

Just like neives family steve and slieve, make bhials chials and dhials

Thanks again for the info, it helps a ton.  Solo raids are my goal but my lack of knowledge on them makes it a daunting goal, this gives me a lot to work off of.

Happy to hear it! Thanks for the pick me up!

osrs soa friends chat
---
Iirc it isnt, as long as 1 input = 1 output. So you clicking the mouse button is the same as pressing control is fine.
---
However dont bind multiple outputs to a button.
---
If you want to cruise it and not have to worry about food at all just get 75 range/70 def/43 prayer. Wear verac helm and skirt, the rest black dhide/god dhide. I got it on my first real attempt with no prior pvm experience.
---
you do know there's a toggle run button or did you skip the tutorial

but rs3 = content past 2012 dg = 2010

One of the classic blunders

That is loitering lol

Join the clan chat ‚Äúosrs soa‚Äù

Eccentric imps? Lol

its fine

Yeah let's ban people just for having met in real life. Guess we gotta cancel runefest after all.
---
Fair point, but it's been 2 years since the TBow has been introduced, and its price hasn't exactly changed over time. This could be attributed to the volume of new players over the past two years, which of course isn't going to be sustainable. However, I personally don't ever see TBow/Scythe being the go-to weapon for the majority of players unless something else is changed.
---
@ me if this claim doesn't age well.
---
Range needs a nerf across the board. It is way more powerful than the rest of the triangle at T75.
---
BP should be nerfed to T75 levels of power and Twisted Bow should be nerfed to T80 levels of power and made to actually be a T80
---
Went 262 raids dry of my first drop. I'm sorry for you brother...
---
I don't follow how botting a skill for exp that literally doesn't impact anyone negatively is on the same level as scripting in a PvP world.  The latter is probably THE worst way you could use scripts to negatively impact another player's experience
---
All because they were posted on reddit and probably reported.
---
lul @ JaGeX botwatch, I made an alt last week, wrote a shitty powerminer script, already 79 mining and I highly doubt they even cared to check it yet.

Ive had this as my pfp on social media for ages now, just so beautiful

Im not sure what im supposed to see here, that you can can examine all the tiles and still get up the id of the block? Not sure how that explains if its a single tile hedge or not.
---
No they don‚Äôt
---
Name at least one.
---
Right outside of the castle, right next to the general store.  I don't know the names off hand, it's something like combat tutor.  You can also get some runes from the mage tutor, or some arrows from the range tutor.

Chaotic good* botting

Electricity was involved in this HIGHLY ILLEGAL cheat code.

We already have better versions of every reward except the rapier. Twisted Bow, Ballista, and Blow Pipe all take a steaming dump on the Chaotic Crossbow. Toxic Staff of the dead and Kodai are much more accurate than a Chaotic Staff. People just don't think about it because all they see is t75 VS t80
---
was where you gonna store all ur pressies if you dont have a bank?
---
Which means that bots are literally controlling the economy. 
---
People always complain about PVM taking away from skillers, but it's the massive bot farms that are REALLY killing skillers.
---
because games suck when they do that
---
This was really good. I approve.
---
Damn we really don't care
---
Any place you can multi-cannon. And I'm pretty sure BP is BIS in some tasks, though I don't remember them - someone else would have to chime in.
---
when he right clicks on two tiles at once you can see that he can examine both, so they have to be 1x1
---
OP is beating up mutated bloodvelds, the wiki page for wyrms does not constitute proof.

I was almost 3k dry on my 3rd whip drop haha. Had 2 in like 500 i think? Tho its ok, my demonix gorilla rng has been insane. Did another task today that was my first task in the last 6 that didnt drop a zenyte..and the first 4 tasks i got 2 per task. Still made 5.4m in 212 kc on todays task tho, which is amazing regardless. I fucking love demonic gorillas. 
---
Sad face tho, got 2 elites and a ballista spring :( all 3 higher drop rate than zenyte lmao. 
---
Abby demons tho man fuck. When i was going dry there i had my good rng at gorillas. Last abby task i got a whip drop. So thats prob why my gorilla task failed me :P. Seriously tho the amount of RDT drops i get on abbys is ridic..ive had 3 1/32k drops on them that were not daggers..and countless fucking 1/8k drops

aye but the angel of a man you're impersonating would gladly clear things up,  and it's actually legitimately fucking stupid to attack a person for offering up that as an option.
---
I don‚Äôt think when it comes to exp botting that it is necessarily about how it affects others, but more so just that you can‚Äôt really mass ban bots that literally exist just to farm money/crash our game‚Äôs economy and then turn a blind eye to exp farming botters.
---
And that‚Äôs because I think it‚Äôs highly unlikely that a main account ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù farming exp just solely bots on that single account. They probably have many other throwaway bots either used for testing or even money making on the side.
---
And we can both agree that bots like that make skilling worthless since you can‚Äôt make profit from the skills anymore. Or more specifically, the profit from skilling is no match to PVM or slayer profit. Negatively ruining the experience of players that don‚Äôt like pvm or pvp that much.
---
This got longer than intended. My bad. But yeah, those are just my thoughts.

You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúdungeon raiding‚Äù? You overcomplicated it with unnecessary details, which you could‚Äôve done with any skill.

Slayer is ‚Äúbeing assigned to kill specific shit until you can kill unkillable shit with specific gear and sometimes you have to be assigned to kill the same unkillable shit‚Äù

Also artisan could‚Äôve been, ‚Äúbeing assigned to create specific shit,‚Äù the slayer of skilling. I don‚Äôt think slayer would‚Äôve passed a poll in 2019.

You have to talk to Oziach first

This should honestly be in the runelite hint for this step tbh.

It‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs gotten better.  It‚Äôs mainly for learning.  You can‚Äôt expect to be a master 40 kills in.

You're thinking of barraging like monkeys.

imagine selling it for 175m and he cant even win yikes
---
Obviously taking the piss..
---
Kawabawan pot blocks you so it has to be in that order
---
You evidently don‚Äôt pk. It won‚Äôt be bis wildy gear. It‚Äôll be rag gear like the shield and the bow and will give horrible drops upon death. It gives the game nothing but more cancer in the PvP community and we need less than that. I don‚Äôt care what type of player you consider yourself, we all need to work together to keep the game we know and love balanced and always improving.
---
Honestly the nice thing about people being toxic is that you can drop them. If you're new to pvp I assume you're awful (and so probably a tbing nuicanse to most) but not everyone is cancerous. However, toxicity is inherent to PVP, especially in a game where you get their items on death.
---
If what you have experienced has been a major discouragement then osrs pvp is likely not for you. 
---
If you want to enter the pvp scene with less (but not no) toxicity, you should make a low level range g mauler to learn the ropes before you progress to bridding. Pvp is very fun but the learning curve is large. You will need patience and some gp.
---
I mean, that's kind of the point of wildy gear, Maybe I don't want you killing me?
---
It's a meme graveyard here
---
Yea it wont get much new traction but its still not bad to listen to.
---
Sgs is nice because is has the godsword spec boost of 150% to accuarcy and damage so it rarely misses.
---
It also heals you if you hit but roll a 0. Which is different than missing, or hitting a regular 0.
---
I remember the good ol' days of b2b dswords...

Didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt, I said the xp rates are low, which they are

He's using windows to do this. Are you also aware that calling it windows when that may not be the exact program gives people like me (uneducated and dumb) an easy reference to understand what's going on easier?

Uh...? It's easier to call it AHK than whatever specific program is because the better majority of the sub knows what AHK is, and not whatever fuck fuck program he's using.

If you're ever doing anything which benefits from Salve, then definitely imbue Salve Amulet.

Archer is quite useful if you're going to do ranged for anything (other than Zulrah).

I've done this already, nothing worked sadly.

I get halfway through jad and the healers come out and start destroying me (only 40 def) and heal jad back to full.
---
Tried that, but the same thing happens. I click it, and nothing happens. Nothing in task manager either.
---
the failure rate on this log cross in particular seems so fucking high, I basically never pass it
---
Great suggestion. Will definitely try this. I‚Äôve been using blood barrage up to wave 62 to heal me, I‚Äôve literally been using every trick in the book.

Trust me, I've waited a while before posting on here, I send a ticket 1 hour ago but the page is stuck on: You are being redirected‚Ä¶  so I pressed on:  Not being redirected? Try again and there it showed that it send me a mail to my account. There's 2 things going on here that I can think off. Or there are some problems right now with the site and it takes a very long time/has trouble loading OR the hacker made almost the exact email address with the first 2 letters of the mail that show up on the site to make it look like it gets send to my email but goes to his mail instead.
---
What the fuck

&gt;but these people have a lot of free time on their hands and Jagex can't realistically stop them forever

Any game should have a system that detects people like this and automatically deals with them, it's basic online game development 101.

If you are not receiving emails from Jagex, then please see this support page for advice:

Also check there are no filters/rules set on your email account that forward, delete or block Jagex emails. If a hijacker had access to your email account, they may have tried to hide what they were doing.

Go to youtube and look at Potupson's jad luring guide, do method 1

Youll never have to tank a healer and you can tag them at your own leisure between attacks with no pressure

Might wanna take a long range weapon like a crossbow for this because blowpipe can pull you into melee distance of jad with this method

Price isn't a balance point. Tbow could cost 100B, it's still an inherently  broken item. Seeing as it is just as op as Sara gwd as a dozen other bosses, thanks for making my point.

I can tell you've never owned a t bow if you think it's OP. Thanks for making my point.
---
Ok buddy I'm going to make this really easy for you. 
---
Even if the twisted now required 99 range to wield, it is still a broken item. It is too strong against a "niche" of bosses, and the majority of people who are using it already have 99 range anyways.
---
200 extra death runes added to the "Always" in the drop table.
---
Yo reply to this comment if you still feel like you don't have it figured out and I'll give you the absolute best tip on how to beat jad with 100% accuracy
---
That's not a "q p w" it's just a dick. q p w is a dick but a dick is not q p w.
---
Did my dragon imo/glory grind recently, still suffering PTSD
---
I read some contradicting stuff in your reactions. You are saying that the healers destroy you and just heal jad to full.
---
Which one is it? Personaly, I think it will be easier to use rune darts, just ignore healers and kill jad while they are healing him. At 85+ range, with a range pot, blowpipe with rune darts, full blessed dhide and eagle eye  it should be possible to ignore healers and just kill jad. If necessary, let healers heal him to full, they despawn, u try again without dieing until you get lucky and do enough damage to kill him while healers heal. Repeat as long as necessary, without having to restart from scratch.
---
Because ahk is beginning a "trade term" of a sort in this community
---
With Dragon Darts, a fresh p pot and Hawk Eye (might be worth getting 44 prayer for Eagle Eye) you'll absolutely melt Jad. I've been doing Fight Caves for Slayer tasks since around 83 Range and this method has never failed me.
---
Doesn't you need to "enchant" the crystal key before using it after song if the elves or something?
---
I went there recently for the diary. Caught one and noped tf out of there.

And iron men racing to repair it, gimi that free xp

And I would argue that this is still the case for most bosses in the game, and the fact that the twisted now is BiS for something like 40% of bosses is still ridiculous, even after nerfing these specific 2.

Love the black d hide nerf and higher % on prot players. Thanks for listening. The daily leaderboard is also an excellent idea. Perhaps add a free t10 emb for the top 3 of the day?

Not really sure but it might be worth checking around the hosidius pens in zeah as its mostly multi there
---
So what happened exactly, I keep seeing this "1 letter away" email stuff. Did you get phished? I'm so confused. If you do know how you got hacked, edit your post please to update people what you did wrong.
---
No, this is something that literally happened a few days ago?

Guess this sub doesnt give a shit the head anti cheat of Jagex responds in this manner and shows they have no clue these things are happening through detection because its related to PvP. Quite pathetic, if only this was a PvM problem then people would be up in arms.

Just wait the skull out ?
---
&gt; Well if the gmaul proposal goes through, I‚Äôm sure it will bring more people.
---
How?
---
All it does is that it will kill one of the last active brackets in BH while rushers and anyone in high risk will still have the same 50% gmaul as they had before because they dont care about risking a little bit extra.
---
When will they learn that dragging people who don't want to be in the wilderness doesn't "fix PvP".
---
All it does is boost the amount of people running with 1 item and food or the absolute welfare setup required for whatever activity.
---
It's barely/never worth it to kill these people for the &lt;100k loot.
---
Zammy wines are a significant hole in herblore and their previous attempt to add alternate ways to obtain them were fucking worse than shitty 200x method of telegrabbing them (growing grapes).
---
A wine spawn in "the deep wilderness" won't even be efficient TBH. Unless you can note them with a private server type dude standing near it, it will still be much faster using the normal location.
---
It just reeks of out of touch idea from people who have no idea on how to fix the situation.
---
just change gmaul spec to 60% and leave it at that. Forget about upgrades or drops to make it 50% thats silly imo.
---
Only T10 is being made tradable with this update.
---
Damn u made an rsps pk video üòÇ
---
I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.
---
No, really. The fact that promises were made nearly three years ago to help improve PvP content yet didn‚Äôt keep/communicate effectively to the playerbase is beyond negligent. The scene is a skeleton of its former self, I have never seen clanning in as horrendous a shape as it is now. Singles teams are also fading rapidly, and the player density on BH worlds has sharply fell to the point that you see the same 30 names every single day.
---
We get told that interest needs to be generated for our scene before content could be considered, but the lack of content is what contributed to its decline. You would rather listen to PvM streamers and cater to that demographic of player while completely alienating another and tell us it‚Äôs our fault when it‚Äôs really your fault for ignoring it. To top it off, you‚Äôre only interested in talking with Torvesta and have completely cut ties with community leaders in the singles/multi scenes as well as the general community overall. It doesn‚Äôt really give weight to all of us like you claim, just another social media influencer who does YT rush clips and not much else.
---
Not to mention the ever growing toxic behaviors of certain groups of players *cough*RoT*cough* who have repeatedly shown to be toxic, racist, and dangerous for the scene and game as a whole. Why haven‚Äôt they been chainbanned for the multiple instances of game mode manipulation, staff corruption and the frequent barrages of racist remarks they toss around on the regular? 
---
How about content that addresses the issue of accessibility so people who have this issue are able to participate? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something you could do, either in-game or on the website to address this.
---
What about in-game clan support? This would affect more than just PvP clans and could give them tools to help them thrive so they are less reliant on external services that could potentially be risky? Pretty sure this is something that has been requested countless times.
---
/rant.
---
I just don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up and have them smashed with a hammer all over again. It‚Äôs fading fast and a lot of it is due to a complete and utter lack of any form of support or communication from Jagex.
---
So the meta is now to Suicide? Great

Start with agility

You‚Äôre right I can‚Äôt technically prove it, but all I‚Äôve got to do is look at any past polls with PVP related content to know that people are voting out of spite. Just because I don‚Äôt have substantial proof doesn‚Äôt mean what I‚Äôm saying is wrong. Also if you‚Äôre saying neither party can be trusted than how do you expect anything to move forward without Jagex implementing things in this fashion?
---
I think the "gonna take forever" meant to imply more failed attempts
---
Would be happy for you if you weren't such a dick in game
---
Haha how am I a dick?
---
üòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòèüòè
---
Ahhh I didn‚Äôt know that! That‚Äôs actually reassuring :)
---
No I didn't get phished, I don't know how I got hacked either. I never got a notification on my phone that someone logged in and I didn't get a code from google to login so nobody has been on my email. 
---
With the 1 letter away I mean for example lets say your email is:
---
bob1336@gmail.com it would show up as b******@g***.com, the hacker made a similar name b******@o***.com. The g was switched w o and o stands for outlook, I noticed the email was different when I tried to recover it.
---
whats the point of the deep wild wines of zammy and how you guys gonna avoid being botted to shit like all the other ones ?
---
They already changed wildy slayer to give bigger emblems.
---
What kind of training are you going to be doing? (Slayer or nmz/crabs)
---
What kind of content are you hoping to unlock after training? 
---
What other gear do you have apart from void/rcb?
---
Well new players to the pvp scene won‚Äôt be risking a lot of money. Plus I‚Äôm sure most newer players don‚Äôt like getting stacked out from full hp in 1 tick.
---
Cant be a real PvP update if they arent just using it to buff PvM
---
Literally can't die unless it's in multi.
---
I know you wanted to assert dominance..but you seriously look like a jackass here.
---
It‚Äôs 100% an integrity issue because without teleport block is a get out of jail free card and not being able to stop players from teleporting directly undermines the risk vs reward nature of the wilderness that you sign up for when you cross the ditch.
---
It would be like if someone was able to make themselves unattackable in the wilderness.
---
It was funny the first time.
---
I'd much rather pk on a rsps than 07 lol, and this is coming from someone who owns a maxed 1 def pure and maxed main
---
Would be sick
---
That's odd though. 
---
Because it's exactly where they want P2P pking to go.
---
Gmaul is busted, sure. But buffing prayer another 20%?
---
Never going to get a kill unless you a TB on someone. And even then they'll be able to tank for years with just prayer.
---
Did this the other day with a kitten. I'm not a smart man.
---
I‚Äôm sure most people who actually vote aren‚Äôt effected by it anyways. Plus jagex probably knows that to keep f2p pking active they need to introduce it.
---
funniest part is when u report this to jagex theyll respond to u that ''maybe u just are bad at pvp.'' this is not joke but literal words from jmod weath's twitter
---
Stop being bad.
---
You said healers fuck you up. Have you tried, i unno. Running through jad so they are aggroed to you but can't attack you?
---
Jokes on you! I'm not a weeb but I like your artwork
---
60%? Too broken
---
No no no, you don't understand. In this context, "integrity issue" means a change that the person wants but has failed polling 3 times.
---
Add ring imbue scrolls for berserker and seers to BH store so mains can stop grinding 200m strength xp in NMZ
---
You can make them cost like half a rune pouch and people would pay for that all day. MAKE PVP NOT PVM AGAIN!!
---
YES to F2P teleblock, YES to gmaul nerf! Woooo!!
---
The rapier degrades? 2m every 16 hours was a decent cost.
---
Kraken and Hellpuppy are 2 of the most common boss pets in the game, wouldn't consider yourself lucky at all.
---
I hope I wasn't the only one who thought Hydra boss would require all 3 attack styles to defeat. Felt like an idiot afterwards in the CC after realising Tbow/BP was all you needed.
---
Pretty sure most of the people who voted no were just pvmers attempting to get back at the PvP scene, it sounds like a great idea that would make pking in f2p much more bearable
---
Explain pls
---
Did you do the trade for 5k then?
---
AHK is essentially macroing.
---
This isn‚Äôt macroing.
---
Its insanely slow at Zully due to damage cap, and not even a viable option at Vork. Only GWD boss its good at is Sara, which it is amazing at, but not like it completely trivializes the fight. Paltry at thermie, worthless at Kalphite queen, good at absolutely 0 wildy bosses worth doing. Sucks at Kraken... Worthwhile at 1 DK, and while good at KBD it requires a weird shield switching method to work without getting gobsmacked. Skotizo you would think it would be good, but its so incredibly inaccurate against him it simply doesnt kill him. Only "good" at corp with a team that hammered corp down, where anything is good. Nothing worthwhile at guardians. It's not even WORTH USING because of how outclassed it is at like 80% of bosses. Good for raids and few bosses... For how good it is and the price tag/rarity? I really see no issue
---
Because you need to complete the Elite Diary to use it hence the reason it requires the Elite Diary
---
Just get 86 RC lol
---
Get barrows gloves asap and get train slayer along with combats so you can make real money and prosper through pvm drop tables.
---
i highly doubt that someone who cant even spell merching properly "merched" for a year in a game he didnt even Play anymore
---
**Bounty Hunter Rework**
---
&gt;Two years ago, a Bounty Hunter Rework was mentioned at RuneFest.
---
&gt;Mod Gambit has now taken on the Bounty Hunter Rework discussions and planning.
---
&gt;*two years ago*
---
&gt;*now*
---
mmmkay
---
Crystal shields - op shield that bolt raggers use and if u kill them u get crystal seed thats worth 1 gp.  
---
Coloured whips - Why are they untradable in the first place? people bring them to single pk and drop them before they die. Broken mechanic.
---
Tent whip - Why pker gets only tent? Add some coin reward depending how broken his tent is.
---
Imbued rings - Why are they even allow to drop this thing? Make it so it loses imbued status if u drop it or w/e.  
---
I can go on and on and on how many broken items there is in pvp that are being abused.
---
What a joke blog post that is instead of fixing anything above they added extra coins to max cape pk? Who the f\*\*\* pk-s with max cape in wilderness?   
---
Next time dont invite some hcim skilling nerds to add ideas to pvp updates k thx bye.
---
did you talk to oziach first?
---
Either way it will be filled with emblem farmers/bots.
---
are you implying it's not?
---
&gt;It's the issue of players voting against things they don't like so Jagex needs to change it without the player's approval
---
Damn that really got my noggin joggin.
---
Can't wait for the same mentality to be applied to other things like mtx. Surely the only people that wouldn't want mtx are people that won't buy it anyway. ü§î
---
Thank you.
---
I‚Äôm just tired of feel good statements, platitudes, and ‚Äúoh I know we told you this twenty times before, but we mean it this time‚Äù deflections. They did this entire nonsensical twitter fiasco where they tried to ‚Äúpoll interest into PvP updates.‚Äù It looked less like polling and more like them forcing players to beg for content that they‚Äôve asked for hundreds of times over.
---
Scamming in risk fights.
---
theres a special place in hell for people like you \*shudders\*
---
Very.
---
All of my friends who use ahk to skill have gone untouched. Literally just say nothing and your fine.
---
LMAO @ "greatest", you're above average at best...
---
If you're leaking you might want to see a doctor.
---
maybe because you only hunt ironmen or people who are not pking in the wild....Your like a bottom feeder one of those pkers who kill air orb runnners so you have to expect some criticism.
---
So your reaction was to make a reddit post... people write shit on the internet all day every day, just add them to your ignore list or kill them for their 30k loot.
---
I think he is 1 xp off 6969
---
The only thing worse then falling off this log, is clicking the middle of the log so you end up running all the way around if you're not paying attention.
---
You still needed to grind 80+ dungeoneering as well, meanwhile you get rapier from the ge.
---
whip + 200m in gear is greater than bad gear and rapier though.
---
Did he say it like it was a problem?
---
abused by who, the team or the person being attacked?
---
LMAO good idea, baby pures are the biggest 1 bangs at revs, we definitely need more of them to steam roll through
---
There still in pvp world and bounty hunter, but besides that i dont see many around. Meds with rigour and heavy ballista has become more the path to go IMO. Ive probably seen one or 2 zerkers deep wild in the past few months because they just get stomped on by meds and mains.
---
I just want to be a part of the community...
---
It is now
---
&gt; macroing
---
Macroing (also known as Autoing or Botting) is the act of using a third-party program to automate an task seen as boring or tedious task, such as skilling, wining, typing, etc.
---
Are you still sure about your statement?
---
Player killing is an art form. I simply came here to share my art with fellow oldschool runescape players. The server doesn't matter, as true player killing skill transcends all servers. Any real pker will appreciate my art for what it is. Maybe if you stop worrying so much about the worth of your pixels and your BH score you will improve. Until then, keep practicing!
---
Best regards,
---
Famine
---
say BYEEE BYEE BYEEE to your account
---
by the team. if they realize they cant kill the guy the teleblocked before the tb runs out they can just kill their teammate and re-tb the guy to reset the tb.
---
Jeez OK so if someone talks shit to me because I am chopping the same yew tree I should post to reddit and ask are WCers usually this toxic?
---
Hes clearly just trying to advertise the client hes trying to sell. And you helped him by posting it to reddit so its seen by more than his 6 viewers. 
---
Or are him. :thinking emoji:
---
F. We'll I'll find a way to adjust if I get it as a drop from Hespori. Because of this I'm not buying it.
---
Lol sad responses from this sub, then again dunno why I should have expected any less with this subs irrational hate and bias towards anything to do with PvP.
---
Guess everyone is just going to completely ignore the fact the head anti cheat mod is publicly and immaturely trolling one of their top PvP streamers calling him "bad" and suggesting that he sees nothing wrong when blatant video evidence is provided to Weath of someone scripting whilst the anti cheat team was none the wiser without that video evidence. 
---
Thats just sad and unprofessional behavior to one of your better PvP streamers and players no less, especially when a clear problem and breaking of the rules is being provided to him. 
---
But hey lets completely ignore a valid concern and instead downvote and troll because its related to PvP! Truly a sad ass circle jerk of a sub defending this shit.
---
I guess Reddit bent him over.
---
Yeah! Less buzz words and more actions. 
---
Jagex need to also realise that updates don‚Äôt have to be permanent. Things like teleblock in f2p could have been introduced months ago just to see how it works, if it gets the wildy more active etc. And then if it didn‚Äôt, and people still hated it months later, they can remove it again. 
---
Obviously I‚Äôm all for TB in f2p but you get my idea that not everything needs to be polled, fail on a close margin and then never looked at again.
---
Bet. If I get it as a drop I'll try it, but I'm not going to flesh out the funds to buy it rn lol
---
You can if you want to asshole
---
&gt;In order to minimise item loss and risk, players currently use Imp Boxes to quickly bank all valuables before they are PK'd on both a PvP world and in the Wilderness. The proposed change is to not allow Imp Boxes to be used in PvP areas as this takes away the risk involved.
---
Does this actually happen? I've never heard anyone brag about saving items with imp boxes, and I've never heard a pker complain about losing loot because of imp boxes.
---
Mage buff when?
---
lucky on the droprate and the commonnes of a pet are two different things.
---
Exactly
---
Press printscreen
---
Depends on how specifically theyre using it to skill I suppose, AHK by default isnt against the rules.
---
Regardless, the point still stands that Weath and his team is completely incompetent when it comes to protecting the game from people who cheat and script and given Weath's attitude, he doesnt seem to really care all that much or take it too seriously even though hes doing a terrible job which is just pathetic.
---
Please delete this post

üëÅüëÅüëÅ

Seconding this. At 91 range and potted up you should be able to out dps them with dragon darts fairly easily.
---
Mayne he grew up had a family landed a good career and rs was holding him back? Either that or he ded.
---
Did you reply to emails about changes to your accounts?
---
Not really needed unless you're specifically using Crystal weapons. Crystal Halberd is probably the only used one.
---
True, there is a conflict of interest both ways, I agree.
---
However, the larger community will always win at the polls. That's why polls can't fix problems there if they exist.
---
Literally the entire essence of the wildy is to act in bad faith. Lmfao this irony is amazing
---
It isn't though if you want maximum AFK/XP.
---
AHK stands for Auto Hot-Key.  It's basically a simplified language that decompiles to C.  AHK is incredibly simple but powerful for writing scripts like this.
---
Good. Fucking delete the gmaul from the game entirely.
---
Iirc max setup against graardor you do around 6 dps with BP, let's say that the charge cannon did 2 dps because you spend so much time to charge by running around but it still did guaranteed 75 damage per hit. As in, the thing can 4 hit graardor but it's way less efficient than alternatives, would you say it's op?
---
The fact that people out there can play with such low ping surprises me even more. it takes 500 ticks for me to whip to ags spec..
---
Would it even save that much time though? Maybe a couple seconds but I feel like it‚Äôs kinda negligible honestly. 
---
Seems like a silly diary reward... why not just make it an agility requirement only
---
How is it easier to type ahk then calling it what it is, a bot?
---
Ahk in pvp terms is when you make a script that with one push a button on your keyboard you will 1 tick instaspec a Gmaul to elder or anything of that matter which is OP and takes no skill.
---
Why destroy the most popular pure build by changing the g maul?
---
now it's time to roast you for your cape amulet and body
---
&gt;We want to work closer with you to determine what you want from competitive gaming events
---
Not PvP related, but King of the skill was actually very great. I, along with many others would like to see it make a comeback.
---
Imagine being so uneducated that you are calling a bot client "ahk" and not knowing the difference.
---
For the fishing spot I think
---
Lmfao wow this guy wants pking to be as profitable as the most profitable pvm activity available.
---
This is the type of guy voting in your polls, folks.
---
mithril darts at carbs are trash xp. Just use MSB(i) with rune arrows.
---
Both areas have bots, but you can still easily find open worlds. You should unlock the underground mine for gems anyway.
---
It's under "Integrity changes" in the news post. I genuinely can't see how in any way this is an integrity change, and the fact it was polled 3 times and failed just goes to show if they want something in the game, they'll sneak it in. In this case under a massive news post.
---
[https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-state-of-pvp?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=bm0q6b#\_ga=2.112043203.658877565.1557751494-312628636.1555719654](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-state-of-pvp?oldschool=1&amp;gsi=bm0q6b#_ga=2.112043203.658877565.1557751494-312628636.1555719654)
---
Keep it up man, crazy dedication
---
This is actually the definition of a strawman.
---
integrity issues aren't voted on not because they are "broken/misused mechanics" - They're not voted on because the vast majority of players won't vote to remove things against their best interest. Good examples are broken mechanics but its not specifically limited to that. 
---
People also won't vote for F2P Teleblock because it has zero benefit if you don't pvp, but there's a lot of arguments that it would improve F2P pvp.
---
To have you just throw up your hands and say 'BUT BUT BUT BUT MTX~!!!!?!?!?' is just fucking stupid.
---
Alright well atleast I'm not crazy. I figure once I get Dharoks it will go a bit faster? I'm maxed in RS3 and just trying to catch up with OSRS friends to do GWD and raids etc
---
You know I gotta flex
---
Once you have 65 attack and 65 str you should go to the warriors guild and bang out your dragon defender. Can take a while but it‚Äôs pretty good do and it‚Äôs a grind that‚Äôs well worth your time
---
Do people actually care about this? What reason is there to say no to this?
---
Had 5m herblore xp bagged, was coming close to finishing. I don't want to have to reobtain that.
---
Or how to eat the pie dish along with the 2nd bite.
---
&gt;It just reeks of out of touch idea from people who have no idea on how to fix the situation.
---
You mean the GREAT MINDS behind Warding aren't quite as great as Jagex would like us to believe?
---
New player, just finished Waterfall Quest and my gear is completely non-existent, what should I do about getting appropriate gear?
---
I can see how you could use AHK to move the mouse around in menus and click certain places, but how would you make it detect your hp, enemy hp, etc?
---
Ah good, then I say we should extent that to the whole wildy.
---
This, and usually goes without saying but since you've only been at it 3 months, also do Animal Magnetism for the Ava's device so that you aren't picking up darts.
---
AKH is a programming "language". Its basically a simplified command set that decompiles to C (one of the most powerful languages).  It makes it incredibly simple to automate certain tasks. Especially if you know certain things like locations relative to a window (the way your bag is always the same location.
---
Source: write a lot of shit for work in AHK.
---
&gt;The game should automatically mute you for one hour if you say the n word.  
---
If someone chooses to turn the profanity filter off then they choose to see words that they could deem offensive.
---
Still remember the 472-476 dds spec, man that was hype at the time
---
BTW did the guy actually give you the toxic blowie? 
---
If not, feel free to pm me
---
100% support, if the smash animation is same as Teletab breaking animation and it occurs automatically after the 2nd bite
---
AHK is a simple macro program to auto-input a series of pre-selected actions. However, this is a full bot client since it is clearly eating and making other decisions on what actions to perform without human input. AHK =/= botting and I really don't get why every bot is called AHK.
---
Bet, I'll remind you of this comment when you max :) keep grinding, we love your videos!
---
I‚Äôve been doing gem rocks for a week - there‚Äôs no open worlds, every now and again you find one until a bot shows up
---
The underground mine has really high combat reqs that I don‚Äôt want to do yet. After tweeting ash recently it seems they don‚Äôt even have the most basic engine support for bot prevention so the point is mute ü§ê
---
Okay, so how can you implement that using code?
---
If unskulling at the Duel Arena is removed, consider (re)moving the hard clue coordinate step inside the Duel Arena as well. It will be a lot harder to find random people to help you do your clue step after the change.
---
if it has zero benefit and will literally only be bad for enough people that it won't pass a poll, maybe it just shouldn't be in the game?
---
Agreed. These boxes are mostly used for sketchy things, I think they should have never been introduced.
---
Also if you watch the clip closely you can see how he is eating food and using his special attack without touching or moving his mouse so it gives you perfect clicks without any chance of failure.
---
Nah...  
---
  
---
Someone would post about it on reddit, Jmods would see it and then they would start caring about bots in MLM.
---
What makes it bad? Encouraging non-members to pk and enjoy the game more? It won‚Äôt affect anyone who‚Äôs a member.
---
I want 60 88 for claws :(
---
Picky I know
---
I claim 100% responsibility for the gmaul nerf, you cannot change my mind
---
Could you imagine people actually risking their accounts getting banned over cheating in a dead content minigame? I'd laugh at the first post on here if Jagex ever decided to enforce that
---
Make a new low level account, either f2p or p2p.  
---
Afaik starting pvping with your main is not recommended because you are at disadvantage against other pvp-specialized players (stats, gear, risk). With low level character, you are usually risking a lot less so the learning-phase is much cheaper for you.  
---
Third option is to wait Jagex 'fix' LMS and then start from there.
---
Yeah thats what I imagine doing if I get it. It does seem super convenient since I wouldn't need to keep going to the leprechaun for composr buckets each time. Okay you know what, I'll give it a try!
---
As a supporter of anything agility (agility is the best skill in RS), I feel your pain. Also love how our character could just walk over the water since during RFD our character had to basically swim.
---
Everything proposed besides D'hide nerf is a joke. As a staff of the OSRS team I'd honestly be embarrassed to talk on their behalf.
---
There is a difference between the n word and fuck. It is a huge difference.
---
Blowpipe is like 200 a shot not 3000 and my bank is growing, although slowly, but I'm only doing this because my focus is grinding slayer till I can get some good tasks unlocked
---
It's iraq,  public is desert.
---
I think they should never have been added in the first place. They are mostly used for sketchy workarounds. And lets be honest, hunting imps isn't a well known important part of the game. Wouldn't hurt to remove them all together. I also disliked the pack yaks banking ability when summoning was released, but at least that had a very high requirement and a cool down. And you could see when a person had a yak and used the ability so no scams.
---
They record your mouse position every 50 ms and every click. Widget menu actions also send click location
---
Nah, everyone just gets phished and acts none-the-wiser. My account is over 10 years old and had 0 compromises.
---
You mess with the meow meow, you get the peow peow (41-41)
---
Seems pretty reasonable, that's now how I'd nerf the gmaul but I assume they've done enough research / spoken to pkers about it.
---
I'd rather they nerfed the bulwark in the wildy though, if that overhead change goes though people with a bulwark are going to be impossible to kill
---
It has a benefit to those that pvp and the feeling of the wilderness. Its people that don't pvp that will suffer. 
---
And since those people are the vast majority of the playerbase, they will always vote no.
---
But you just keep reading what you want to hear and ignoring 90% of what people are saying. So have fun and enjoy teleblock.
---
Yeah I've been playing since ~2005 so I know the value of a ddef. Plan to get 65/65 then use the added dps for faster 70/70/70. Already got a torso and neit
---
Thanks for the advice though!
---
Top level depletes at a set amount of time..
---
It literally says they will NEVER be best in slot
---
RPers are the most cringiest players IMO.
---
I might be alone but I welcome the gmaul nerf as well as the 40 to 60%  overhead reduction
---
You don't "need" to do it, in the same way that you don't "need" to do tick manipulation to gain xp in skills. Just take an antidote and some food and you negate the damage.
---
true tbh, they have fixed salaries that are barely above the poverty line. It's a damn crying shame considering the passion and hours the vast majority of them put into the game.
---
That isn't ahk he is using a custom client with commands
---
its jagex undercover looking for more areas to bring in dead content
---
r/WowThanksImCured

Lmao cute cape &lt;3
---
Will players who have already started DMM but haven't done dragon Slayer/mm/animal magnetism have those quests auto completed? I literally checked out DMM for the first time last week and haven't done those quests.
---
In addition to everyone's suggestions, you could do things like pest control to work towards a future set of void in a fun way
---
As a non iron, wouldn‚Äôt fishing, wcing, cooking, mining, smithing, fletching, thieving, construction (I can keep going) all be completely pointless to train unless you want max cape? By that logic only Ironman accounts make sense to play.
---
Who are the mods here on Reddit?  Does anyone know?
---
A mad man!
---
DO NOT ADD FUCKING LODESTONES OR MAKE AGILITY F2P
---
Install any Java version (I‚Äôd go with any java lts version from Oracle).
---
Monkey tail at 70 kc. Just finished mm2 and loving these gorilas.
---
Chances are you were hacked and whoever hacked your accounts botted.
---
I came back after like 2/3 years and my account was banned for botting I managed to appeal and get my account back.
---
It should've been f2p from day one or when mobile came out.  The f2p pk population is so low now compared to both those times.  It stops pvpers from teleing since most are too scared to even risk a rune scim/baxe which is traditionally all you bring to multi with a clan.
---
As someone who only plays on mobile this does deter me from PvP though.
---
Tried hybrid in PvP on mobile. Does. Not. Work.

&gt; Not being able to tank freezes is going to suck big time, especially with the newly introduced brimstone ring already giving pkers an edge.
---
People will be able to tank freezes just fine, it just wont be broken af anymore like it is right now and thats not a bad thing but people have gotten used to how OP hides are against mage so itll take some people time to adjust.
---
Brimstone ring also barely does shit, im fairly convinced it actually does nothing lmao. The amount of times either I or someone else has splashed when getting the "10% magic defense has been reduced" alert comes up is pretty comical. Maybe now itll actually be decent with dhide changes though?
---
It's being deemed as an integrity change so it will be added without poll
---
Literally catering to bots now lmfao
---
Construction is useful due to the benefits you get from the regen pool/prayer alter/quick teleports but honestly apart from that, those skills are basically useless. Maybe thieving would be viable as a good money-maker but it's not at the moment. 
---
So I would agree, logically only ironman accounts make sense to play if you really want the vanilla experience.
---
ehhh idk about "good". Feels like the whole fight is waiting for transitions for phase to phase. I like Cerb and Sire much more as slayer bosses
---
pvm needs a rs3 death mechanic, basically you die anywhere you re spawn at death and pay a % of the value of items lost to get them back.
---
It's a horrible idea, clans will never let you on the tber and they will start fulling themselves on login with a suicide tber in case they come under any risk whatsoever.

Well, the skill is Runecrafting; you craft runes at altars. The travel is part of the process of making runes. And with some altars like Arceuus, the process does differ slightly but at its core the skill is about binding items at runic altars.
---
Saying that all methods are the same if you exclude the travel element is like saying all Crafting is the same since you stand at a bank; if you exclude the parts that differ and only focus on the parts that stay the same of course you don't find variety. On top of that, Combo Runes do differ in process from normal runes and there are also Tiaras... So even if you do exclude travel, there are 4 different ways to interact with runic altars (runes, combo runes, Arceuus runes, and tiaras).
---
Anyway, RC methods don't lack variety any more than other Artisan skills. You can boil all of smithing down to "use on anvil" and "use on furnace", but looking beyond that there is a fair amount of variance in how the actions are performed (e.g. knives vs platebodies or cannonballs vs bars). So even if RC did get a GOP-like activity, it would still be consistent with the theme of binding runic energy and it wouldn't be a massive depature from what you'd expect from the skill.

They did that and got everyone after NEAR REALITY dropped off via making servers based around it trying to get a straight PK community back but apparently just ended up ratting the clients at the at the end when they couldn‚Äôt get more than a stable 100 player base
---
Comboed with the dhide change I like it. If either of them come on their own clans will be too powerful. I think adding extra prayer protection to supplement the reduction of dhide defences is a good idea.
---
I'm in agreement with you that it makes sense. I was disagreeing with the guy I replied to who said "it won't make a difference anyways!"
---
&gt; They should rework it. Give the ability to imbue magic equipment from runecrafting.
---
Like maybe.... gee I dunno, maybe like a certain proposed new skill is planning to do...?

Nah nvm that makes too much sense lul.

Don‚Äôt view any content in the wild as PvE content. It‚Äôs all PVP content. Just because in included fighting a monster doesn‚Äôt inherently make it PvE, it‚Äôs still PVP content as you can and will still fight other players there.
---
Does anyone have any tips for dealing with verziks melee attack after purpled have spawned. Seems like it‚Äôs tough to tank her properly on her 5 tick attack style while also running away from purples. Also how much does 1 death during the raid affect your chance at a drop?
---
&gt; However, toxicity is inherent to PVP, 
---
All pvp games where you have access to chat are toxic.
---
Aside from the waiting, I enjoy all the mechanics and challenges that fight has to offer. They could definitely streamline the changing of the phases and they can definitely optimize the death animations to be faster and smoother but overall it‚Äôs a well designed pvm encounter
---
&gt;If you think that macroing is the same as botting then sure, it‚Äôs the same

But...

Theyre great changes for the most part, but theyll never pass.

Too many salty idiots mad about their spades.

God i wish this game wouldnt have attracted those people from RS3.

This is a good tradeoff

Just in time for hidden poll results

i mean tbf to jagex at the end of the day its THEIR game and they can do whatever they want to it. polling is entirely them being nice and theyre not required to do it

Youtube zerker, piety pure, or med.  There really isn't much variation.  The only difference between a pure/zerker/piety are the defence/prayer/attack quests you do.

You can run from one side of the F2P area to the other in about 4 minutes. I don't think it's that overwhelming.
---
You‚Äôre a fat bitch with a fake online persona. Who‚Äôs the loser?
---
anytime friend! :) I'd honestly really recommend the documentary they made a couple years ago for runefest, it's about an hour and a half long and it's the full story of the game from just an idea back in 2001 to what we have now with osrs and rs3. Good interviews with the Gowers and also the folks who put MTX into rs3, they talk pretty frankly about all that stuff

Mine doesn‚Äôt freeze, but it‚Äôs an absolute laggy, graphical error mess when I head to the west/northwest part of the island with all the fungi or mushrooms or whatever. I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs only in Runelite though, not on the original client
---
Why the fuck is her pussy so fat
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the gmaul change as it would no actually do anything in the long run. I also do not see it passing. The idea of changing prayer damage soak is also a bad idea. It is already too easy to tank damage. What are you guys at jagex thinking? 
---
PS Please please please tell me that the kill counter in PVP world will add the kills I have gotten in the past. Would be a real shame if it only counted kills after it was added. A real shame.
---
i don't think jagex bought out the wiki, they just moved it to their own platform.

iirc the rapier had a recharge cost of 2m and it would last you 10 hours in combat. Could also be recharged with the dungeoneering currency though.

Just because you consider it low value does not mean other people do too. You're not the only person who plays this game

What else can you do with a bond when you buy it for money? Don‚Äôt say use it for game time cause it‚Äôs more expensive than a sub fee.
---
That house looks familiar
---
agree. but the amount of runes you need to solo pk deep wildy in f2p takes up half your inventory
---
Thats your opinion.
---
And apparently a lot of people disagree with your opinion - otherwise it would not have failed the polls multiple times
---
Polling something = requesting player base opinions on the topic. Ignoring the results and implementing a failed poll undermines the integrity of the polling system as a whole
---
I agree that not polling and just adding it would have been better. I'm not disagreeing with the end result. I just don't like polling something, failing, then implementing anyway conceptually.
---
Jagex bans like 100-150k bots **per week**.  It's not like they aren't doing anything, it's an insane problem.
---
No reason to use z hasta over arclight.
---
so giving new players free items, which they will stop playing as soon as the free items stop coming. this misses the entire point of the game. making agi f2p is huge as that's ALWAYS been a members skill. the issue is, pushing ANYTHING not polled is an issue, when they start turning us into rs3 due to "polls being too slow"
---
That's what it's been for a while.

Also when WoW made their WoWtoken gold became cheaper to buy through them than 3rd party sites. So how does 1 destroy the economy and the other doesn‚Äôt?

Literally everything to do with a new player experience is going to be dead content to us. Like, it has to be. So that's probably not the best way to look at it
---
I would say bandos is just as easy as vork but you're right vork is much more consistent and the 0 downtime is op
---
invoke scripts (no click prayer activations) are very detectable by jagex, plenty of people already received bans for those.
---
Give them out. Cant you also change your name with them aswell? The point I was trying to make is you aren't buying gold directly but I do know where you are coming from.
---
While you're at it, could you lock rev caves behind a diary? Currently Lvl 3 Scouting bots can roll up there in no time, grab info of every player and sell it off PvP clans.

It says that for free to play. Says they could be best in slot for members.

Yep. I think this will be one of the worst things they could do for the new player experience. The only thing worse would be having a flashing microtransaction button blasting the player in the face 2 seconds into their experience.

Agreed with everything except that pvp is hard to profit from so there shouldnt be gold sinks attached to pvp for the sake of gold sinks

Agreed with mage def and bulwark and ely have to be tackled. Nerfing black d hide just nerfs 1-69 def accs vs 70def+ and is only a bandaid on a bigger issue. Magic with 100% accuracy cant out dps someone spam clicking brews even without protect magic on.

That's just irrational. You can put as many as you want on it, it won't solve the problem. Bot detection is pretty good as it is, but to make sure bot makers don't get to test out what triggers it, they don't ban bots right away. It's just that when you ban them, they'll make new accounts.

Dungeoneering could give beginner clue rewards and I'd still play the shit out of it.

Considering I started playing at 11 years old when Runescape Classic was the main game, its hard for me to imagine what the hangups are for new players in 2019. OSRS has significantly more information in game at the start than Runescape Classic did. Pair that with the fact that most new players are likely not 11 year olds so their critical thinking skills are significantly better (hopefully). Not to mention that all of the information you'd ever need is a simple Google search away. That wasn't the case back when I started.
---
Some of my fondest memories of the early game experience was wandering around figuring stuff out for myself or with my small group of friends. Magic carpet rides and item vouchers diminishes the need to explore during the early game. Maybe with our decreased attention spans due to smartphones, a more streamlined and less open early-game is required. If that is true, that says more about modern society than about OSRS.
---
Actually laughed out loud
---
the stone its self is nice and thematic though, maybe having it crafted into an equipable rune pouch in the same slot would be nice. it'd also solve the problem of people complaining about only being able to own 1 rune pouch
---
As someone who has been concerned about PvP World Looting Bag, I think those restrictions should be enough for it to serve its intended purpose. I'm not as big of a fan of the Imp Box change. Using in Dangerous Areas is kinda the point of the item and it is already a fairly niche item. I do not think they should be allowed while in combat, but if you are out of combat below 30 Wilderness, I don't see why you should be banned from using an Imp Box to bank your Chins or such. Blocking them in combat, even if you previously in combat within the past minute, seems like a better solution than just banning from all PvP Areas. Aside from that, all the other unpolled changes sound fine.
---
Wilderness Slayer Keys are an interesting idea. Will these replace the Emblem and Slayer Enchantment drop (offering in the new chest instead I assume)? The only concern I have is if it is a chest in the Wilderness, it could get camped by PKers making it hard to redeem your loot. Also, if the key is untradeable, if a PKer kills you with a key what would they get? Both of these issues could be solved is the key were tradeable; then PKers would get the key drop and Slayers could sell the keys to more daring players (or the PKers camping the chest) if they didn't want to risk it. The rest seem fine to poll as mentioned.
---
For the other changes, I think the Granite Maul change would be reasonable. Keeping the existing behavior but at a higher cost makes sense. If only we could still use the Clamp for that purpose... The overhead change is interesting; not sure about it in general but maybe 50% instead of 60%? Also, with the Avernic Defender, instead of lowering the PKer's profit, perhaps raise the repair cost? I recall some complaints about how it currently works so reducing the reward may make that worse.
---
I wouldn't mind a Black D'hide nerf, but I am not sure how effective it would be. For example, Black D'hide Body is +50 Magic Defence, which is a lot, but Red D'hide Body is +40. Black D'hide should be a fair bit stronger than Red, but that doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of room unless you nerf Red too. With the Chaps, it is a difference of 8 Magic Def and the Vambs it is a difference of 2. So what? Reduce the Body by 5, Chaps by 4, and Vambs by 1 to make it 10 Magic Defence less then the current? Would that actually solve the issue or is 76 Magic Defence still to good for the risk? Also, I do think that Karil's being high Ranged and Magic def but lower Melee def is a nice design tradeoff and I wouldn't want to see it directly superior. For context, Karil Top and Skirt is +62 Slash Def and +100 Magic Def and Black D'hide Top and Chaps is +72 Slash Def and +78 Magic Def, which is much more gained than lost and if Black D'hide Magic Def is nerfed it would be even better (the -10 nerf above would raise difference from 28 to 37).
---
The LMS changes sound great. As for rewards, I'd suggest a point system based on final placing and kills. For example, if there are 24 players, you could give first place 10 points, second place 8, third place 6, fourth-eight 5, and continue to decrease until the last placements get 1. That way even if you are terrible, you still get something for the attempt. Likewise, earning kills should result in extra points, even if it scales similarly (e.g. 1 point for 1-2, 2 for 3-4, 3 for 5+). For the rewards, I think some untradeable cosmetics would be neat. One suggestion is that LMS could let players obtain the Deadman Outfit on normal worlds. Also, a bit of an out there idea, but we do have the Red Skull from Fight Pits; perhaps LMS could offer other cosmetic skulls, either through an item like a ring or perhaps even an "upgrade" to your default skull to make it fancier (with a toggle of course). It could also get some tradeable rewards for profit, but depending on the modes and potential rigging for profit that could pose an issue.
---
Also, when you mention an untradeable hat or cape from BH, you mean like Hunter's Honour? That said, I think it would be a good improvement if you could freely change it between Hunter's Honour and Rogue's Revenge regardless of what KC is higher. Then perhaps it could visually change based on your KC in each like the old Wildstalker Helmet, even if it just recolored or something. That said, I'd be wary of making it too high of a goal (e.g. Raids Capes) since some players may feel forced to unlock it and even result to boosting kills just for the cosmetics. BH does have some unique rewards like the Orn Kits too and since the Emblems are tradeable, I am not sure how much unique untradeables matter.
---
Well, it's pretty bad design for the highest XP method to be unlocked at level 23. My personal suggestion would be for XP from lavas to be scaled down a bit, and add in other higher XP training methods at later levels.
---
Lmao so the BH ‚Äúrework‚Äù is literally just making it slightly harder to grief and maybe adding some fucking *cosmetic* rewards that they haven‚Äôt even thought about yet. I was hoping for some new profitable rewards after they took away rune pouch profits and shoe horned it into slayer for no reason. 
---
Guess there‚Äôs no point renewing membership on any of my builds. Jagex has shown time and time again they don‚Äôt give a fuck about pkers, skillers, or pretty much any player who doesn‚Äôt jerk it to slayer 247.

Getting around without teleports and low agility is absolutely dreadful and gets old fast. You‚Äôll still have to move around to actually experience any content, like quests for example, but there‚Äôs never been anything fun about running out of run energy half way to Varrock.
---
&gt; The change to 60% prayers makes the pvp skill gap even bigger. One of the reasons pvp lacks activity is due to the skill level needed to pk, now all pkers outside of the top 1% will have even of a less chance to compete, making pvp even more inactive. Jagex should cater to all of pvp, not a small minority who only benefit from this.
---
this to me sounds like you want the skill gap to be lowered? you think that they should make it easier for newer pker to kill better pkers? do you not think that lowering the skill cap in the high level pvp community might have a worse effect overall, especially when jagex seems set on making pvp events with prize pools.
---
Feels like darkfall all over again lmao
---
Nothing is free. You pay with your sanity training agility.
---
Those free items are already practically free anyway, mithril items cost nothing and they are level 20. Making agility f2p isn't big either, it literally has no effect on any p2p player.
---
That sounds interesting. Even your comment proved it to be better than this handout system they want to create. They didn't just hand you a free steel long sword. You saved enough gold up to buy one. In other words, you earned it.

Nah your camera angel doesn't match up to what you're saying even if what u said would be remotely be true the zoom would make you show up under the dragon.

I agree. If you miss the message, either because you're panicking or because you hadn't changed chat to in-game/friends only, then it really isn't the game's fault. The tools are there!
---
It's definitely not safe to assume that. You're making a ton of assumptions here that are in no way warranted by the dev blog. They say they want to introduce a new transportation system, how you interpret that as "guided travel" I have no idea.
---
Yeah not sure I‚Äôm gonna do that LOL
---
That's one of the updates I really didn't like. You'd get a bunch of levels from a quest or something and you'd have to go through every skill tab just to stop them from blinking
---
I got my first fire cape this wknd on my 4th attempt and after every failed attempt I felt like my heart would explode.
---
How could that be blocked without blocking from PvP entirely? I think their use for Chin Hunting and such is good, but I can see how that is an issue. Aside from area bases restrictions, perhaps preventing them from working if you were recently in combat (e.g. last minute) could work?
---
While I personally am all for a lot of these changes, as I think the early game learning ~~curve~~ wall is pretty harsh, that is the scariest thing I've heard from Jagex in a long time. Up until this point, the only unpolled changes have been minor updates, bug fixes, and integrity changes. (People voted no to DS start req for anti dragon shields? Really? Cheap, botted bones for prayer xp is better than integrity?) In contrast, this is Jagex just blatently saying "we will arbitrarily start making unpolled changes when we feel polling is too annoying", which is literally the worst possible precedent that could be set for the game. The entire poll system works based on trust with Jagex, and with that out of the window, we're back in 2011, hoping that the updates thrown our way are quality, and while having a pretty good track record, not having a clue what the future holds.
---
also the proposed 60% protection prayers, that shits going to be OP.
---
I used this [video](https://youtu.be/jGsxzqQTwVI) when I was starting my meme.

Also so you maybe you can actually out DPS bolt raggers. Seen people praying range while briding vs a bolt ragger still get our DPSed which is dumb
---
Whoever decided this should either be fired outright or take a look at what happened to RS3 and soon WoW.  They are in their current state incapable of designing a game as a service.  This isn't a AAA
---
Studio, so it is expected that the community gets a say.  MMOs are a dying breed, and ham fisted design is best suited for more parasitic game genres which never have any intent to last a long time, such as mobile games.
---
Thank god.  Keep them banhammers coming.

i bet if they polled it within the f2p pking community it would pass handily.

This is exactly why I don't bother with PKing. It's broken to the core.

Why is ANY agility shortcut a diary reward? Why lock a barely used skill behind diaries?

If t10s become tradeable then t1s become worth considerably less. If a t10 is 1.5m, then a t1 is gunna be worth 45k. And if t10 is even lower, then t1 becomes lower.

Black d hide hunters already wear karils which isnt getting nerfed lol

Magic is more for teleports and other utility spells though.
---
So now you just give up?
---
Sure, but to save a lot of time you spend hours grinding agility. The shortcuts basically give you back some of the time you wasted training agility lol.
---
Yup. You can do the same with ornament kits for dboots, dlegs, and fury. It looks a bit tacky, but I find it worth.
---
Or only bots get invited to Jagex
---
So the worst thing about removing bots is giving skillers a reason to exist? Sounds like a win win to me
---
I agree, but I think there's a fairly easy way to fix it.
---
Simply allow players to change their home teleport to an activity by talking to the main NPC who manages said activity. 
---
This means you can still get to minigames relatively quickly for things like farm runs or whatever, but it stops it from being a crazy convenient "go anywhere" free teleport.
---
Heck, you could even potentially add an NPC to NPC Contact who let you change the location from anywhere at the cost of having to use lunars and cast the spell.
---
I'm not talking about 1-tick flicking, I'm talking about flicking in general, mainly flicking before the hit splat.  Ie flicking Jad's attacks before they hit.  I think Jagex needs to explain protection prayers and prayer timing to prepare players for content that will require it later on.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a bit different than what I initially thought. That‚Äôs pretty messed up. Where did you fill it?
---
Check out "5 o 4". We have skillers, pvmers, and pvpers. Also have dutch and english players. We do a lot of Corp as well.
---
Yea, a formular of combat/HP and wildy level.
---
The higher they are, the higher the drop rate.
---
It‚Äôs semantics. He‚Äôs literally quoting dev blogs with slightly different wording saying the same thing: we are not polling some changes in both dev blogs. I didn‚Äôt need 3 paragraphs explaining it to me, I don‚Äôt even think he or you is even understanding what I was getting at, and instead of leaving me alone you both go complete poindexter on me and now you‚Äôre mothering me about patience. Just leave me alone.
---
The texture just hasn't loaded yet.
---
What about a short (skippable) cutscene after finishing tutorial island that shows and explains a few goals that new players could do to get started - quests/skilling/exploring.
---
Or even have cutscenes when entering new cities/areas that show off what they have to offer, kind of like what happens in the Giant Dwarf quest but more dedicated to the skilling areas, major buildings, and quest start NPCs.
---
Also the early game travel caravans are good as long as they show the path on a map or something.
---
Haven't played since they changed the BGS spec to 50%. Too busy these days and don't like the game enough to dedicate any of my free time to it.
---
But fuck if the memes aren't the best memes in the universe.
---
The work on LMS is mostly done and there is a lot of interest around its rework. I don't think removing content you dislike is the best way to fix the game. And they did say they are stopping DMM after the current season concludes while they reassess their competitive modes.
---
gettin upset for other people? I thought that was just a meme
---
Back in the day, you lost it all on death. Now, even if it's not one of your protected items, you still keep it, it is just "broken" and must be repaired.
---
I work with somebody like this, feels the need to put all his problems out there when there isn‚Äôt any and wears is heart on his sleeve. Everyday, I get closer to telling him to grow some fucking balls.

The only thing it hits is my emotions

---
I spend like 5+ hours a day chopping yews right now and the presence of bots does not diminish my reason for existing.
---
&gt; Well, that is because they haven't started on it yet and those are just early ideas. It was announced in 2017, but they don't start working on updates after they are announced; they start working on them before they are due for release. 
---
Bro come on..theyve had over 2 years to think about it. And if they truly havent even started on it at all, when they promised it was coming soon in 2017 thats just incredibly unacceptable.
---
&gt; The BH update didn't make the release schedule, they planned again for next year and once again they didn't have time for it. They did have one thread once asking for suggestions I think, but with the changing of CMs and the projects low priority, many of those may have been lost of misplaced.
---
I just dont understand how they can push something off for so long after promising it was coming? Imagine they decided to do that with reworking...Raids or something, people would be absolutely livid, and rightfully so. How can "not having time for it" be a legitimate excuse anymore after over 2 years though? That excuse flies out the window after such amount of time.
---
And how can actually giving attention to an entire aspect of the game, and probably the thing that has been ignored the most and needs the attention the most be so low of a priority that it gets put off for over 2 years until PvP has reached the absolutely lowest point and is borderline dead? None of these are acceptable excuses as far as im concerned when PvP has needed updates/fixes more than anything and when theyve had so much time to work on it.
---
WG_CC (wilderness guardians clan). We do daily PvM/PvP/Mini-Games/Skilling Events +F2P stuff! Feel free to join us to find some friends.

But it would only work for the first couple hours, right? Just long enough to give new players a feel of the world before they have to do everything themselves.
---
Try them again, they have some decent alchBles
---
Having a game company say they want to be the most popular is just saying that they want to be the best game out there in the MMO genre.  
---
What's wrong with Jagex saying "we want to be the best MMO game in the world?" and going into the development, communication and innovation with that in mind?
---
So.. random events?
---
I'm not the only one who doesn't like the shitty rng fest known as LMS. There was a private server that did Battle Royale way better, so my expectations for LMS were extremely high. Jagex rushed it, and could have done a much better job if they listened to the community
---

"Jagex doesn't care about PvP and never does updates"
---
*this thread*
---
"Wow Jagex how dare you try to change PvP"
---
Fucking hell, no wonder they don't bother with PvP updates often. You all just bitch and moan when they do. Offer some goddamn constructive criticism instead of just shitting on their ideas.
---
I mean it's  great content.
---
There definitely needs to be more vertical scenery in the game

Is it really?

I find the issue with the g-maul to be less its ridiculous potency in the hands of pures (Pures have no defense, so it's GOING to hit more often than not), and more the KO-Potential it has for 30k gp.
---
You risk nothing with a gmaul and can feasibly KO anyone easily with RNG.
---
The issue is thus making the g-maul worth something more than 30k so people stop abusing it.
---
Because while just about everyone CAN abuse it: it isn't fun if everyone is using it.
---
Increasing the gmaul spec to 60%+: well it's still potentially good, but I doubt we'd see people using it anymore.
---
Adding an upgrade to restore the 50% spec: WELL, that depends on how expensive the upgrade is. Also: HOW the upgrade is introduced.
---
Make it a gold sink: the Bounty store could have an option to "improve" the gmaul back to the OG 50% spec for 500k gp. On death: the killer gets ONLY the maul, making it a permanent 500k GP Sink.
---
Maybe 500k is too much: it's an example. That said: even 100k would deter raggers from using it, but I still say 250-500k is fine.
---
If upgraded via a drop: it won't be worth anywhere near the Dclaws, and I doubt people value the gmaul spec over the AGS spec, so... idk, it might not really do much in the LONG term.
---
it's "disgusting"? lol
---
Unless botting is removed from f2p, the experience wont improve.  It is to easy to make an account which allows bots to spam them out.
---
Maybe the problem is the clans you're joining. The 3 you mentioned are/were straight cancer
---
The overall value was about 3-4m. The drop was never intended to be huge. If someone already has money any drop will seem bad if it doesn't have stuff like whips
---
The issue with the G-maul is that it is completely OP as it is: it's dirt cheap (30k), has high damage potential with an instant-double spec potentially stacking with multiple other hits (or a single spec from say an AGS).
---
Nerfing it to 60%+ spec bar doesn't solve the issue if a new upgrade is introduced but it is rare and costs several mil: it would still be there, as an option.
---
It's a bad idea. It rewards the worse bridder. If you're already getting kills at 40% protection an increase to 60% makes it more difficult. I guess this is somewhat dependent on the black d hide nerf but if you're losing a fight camp pray range/meele and you're pretty much safe. Killing a chinner or pvmer with dinns and 60% increased prayer also becomes harder. Overall if you're a good brid a 60% protection increase isn't going to do much for you, it helps your opponent. It's a terrible idea.
---
Yeah, I have no idea why more people aren't asking for this. It is a very obvious solution to most of the existing problems.
---
Has more to do with max mage splashing a fuck ton against d'hide.
---
Same here, lost motivation to play like couple months ago.
---
Yeah maybe in 10+ years when I can get my theoretical kid to runecraft for me. Or maybe I'll just suicide bot the account prior to that.

Sure one out of 100 times you might find some retard who doesn't protect his +1 or gets skull tricked, or that is just a complete fucking retard and is risking a decent amount.
---
But 99% of the time, you're killing someone for rags and the bare supplies.
---
I dunno if you've ever left a BH world personally, but this is exactly what goes on at those "wilderness rejuvenation" hotspots that supposed to "fix pvp" in the past.
---
So suggest something good then since you seem to know best.  You've basically come in here, declared a few things impossible to fix, all the while being angry that said things haven't been fixed.
---
This is the same type of updates that started happening in pre-eoc, with eg. the removal of tutorial island. I assume they have metrics which state too many new people get confused and lost when dropped off of tutorial island, and they don't like the loss of potential revenue. They should remember this type of thinking is what got us into the current situation of having to make an *oldschool runescape* that is rolled back 6 years &amp; reset. I think the early game exploring is an important part of what makes RuneScape unique.
---
Lol at the changes proposed to Clan Wars (the purple portal, not the white FFA one), hardly anyone even uses it.
---
Only commenting on the agility changes as well. I ctrl+f'ed for agility potions, and you're the only one who seems to mention it.
---
Since energy potions are already f2p, I don't like the idea of f2p agility.
---
I mean that‚Äôs a very reasonable assumption. But on the flip side you can‚Äôt pk with a small clan because you‚Äôll always be killed by the bigger clans and the bigger clans are the ones mentioned above. 
---
If you have a suggestion of a big clan that isn‚Äôt straight cancer I‚Äôd be more than happy to join them.

The problem is relying on google when playing on mobile is much worse than when playing on a pc.

I never PK in BH worlds unless it‚Äôs to cape switch someone risking bank up at 44s, literally the only time. I pk every single day, spend 90% of that time up at 44s, and have pked hundreds of mills in all sorts of crazy shit over the years, you legit have no idea what your talking about. I don‚Äôt go to revs, or ven, I‚Äôm not a multi pker. Just in the past month I‚Äôve pked at least 20m in god dhide boots alone lmao. Your just another cry baby pvmer, That acts like pvm content being in the wildy somehow forces yourself to go in their, well guess what retard, it doesent
---
That's just greed to me then, free gp is free gp. It's like bitching about getting $10, because you are used to get $100. Take the money lol
---
They drop hard clues

They could always just set the new TBer as the TB owner, without extending the time.

Elves and flails don't really fit together. They are more like a finesse warrior type
---
Blessed dhide is black dhide and +1 prayer.
---
Black d hide is 13k and almost matches bis gear. 
---
Praying range and tankinf magic hits while bolting their robes on pray range is more dps than actually switching prayers and gear. That is not good design. Tho a better solution would be making praying X make you less defensive vs Y And Z. So praying range makes magic and melee more accurate while not making people more tanky.
---
Sook is "crybaby" in Aussie
---
yeah but then you have to start mining the vein exactly at the same tick as the other player. If you just take your own vein, it's longer AFK + better xp, since if you're with 2 on 1 vein, the vein can deplete before your actions ends resulting in less XP/H. Downvote me all you want, but I know for a fact I'm right lmfao.
---
No, it's the same as leatherbody.
---

---
I had the same trouble when learning to PK, so I went to Castle Wars as well as Clan Wars to mess around, practising switches and fighting random people. I found some pures who wanted to practise fighting together, some of the ones AFKing within Castle Wars also were interested in practising out of the wilderness. It might seem like a 'waste of time' as you get no loot, but the knowledge and experience you gain from learning the mechanics of PKing and improving yourself is really valuable.
---
Unrestricted worlds are good fun as well as you can set your stats to anything you want, so you can practise any build you want to.

They said in the post they're only available for the first few hours so I don't see the big deal lmao

&gt; One way we could tackle this could be to introduce a new transport system that's accessible only for the first few hours of the RuneScape journey. It could connect major towns and cities in the F2P area
---
This is OSRS Lodestones and it's peak easyscape.
---
Connecting F2P towns exists and it's called magic runes.
---
&gt; Keeping new players engaged with the game is one of our highest priorities, and while we want to be agile with our changes, we aren‚Äôt going to rush any decisions. We‚Äôll ensure that we continue talking to you, listening to your feedback and building on your ideas. Growing the community is very important, but we want to do it right. Please do let us know your thoughts, and we'd love to hear about any ideas you may have.

We'll listen but not via the best method we have to listen, which is polls.

some good, some bad. some really bad\\weird. Some good that is designed to fail because of the bad.  
---
For example, Black Dhide absolutely needs to be nerfed, but it will fail to pass poll for the same reason PvP questions always do: PvMers. I know the idea is that we're in control of the game with polling, but you've got to understand that more than 99% of the people who vote on those polls have 0 idea what the fuck they're talking about most of the time ( I fall into that 99% more than not, and I'm sure I'm about to make at least some terrible commentary below). At some point you've got to understand it's your game your job to make a GOOD change whether or not the poll passes.   
---
Gmaul needs a real nerf, not a 'farm emblems or drop so the gmaul isn't nerfed anymore' nerf. being able to 1-tick people from fully brewed HP is just not stellar gameplay design in an RNG based game. AGS, Elder Maul, Gmaul, DarkBow, etc they're all too strong. IDK how you nerf them without making their uses outside of PVP harmed as well (even though I struggle to think of anything people use the Gmaul spec for except pvp...) -- maybe making them behave differently against other players versus NPCs? IDK how it happens, but I do know rebalancing items should be a top priority item if you're serious about reworking pvp.   
---
TB going F2P is good. Removal upon death of TBer is also good. Not giving F2P more powerful freeze spells, though, still keeps the skill level to tank in f2p extremely low. also giving f2p more powerful items that literally serve no purpose in p2p anymore wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. (Brine Sabre &amp; yew bow, for example??)   
---
Not letting people ditch their skulls is a start to end unskulling, but I think it misses the mark. The problem is people coming to the wild in max gear risking 400k expecting people to fight them in more common PVP gear at a disadvantage. I think a better solution is the implementation of a different version of the key system from DMM -- you're auto-skulled and auto-risking everything but your plus one (unless you're smited) as soon you enter wild to fight. However, I realize this would be an issue for PVMers, but also howeverx2, I'm not entirely convinced I think that making the wildy bosses much more of a risk to fight is actually a bad thing.   
---
As for the really bad\\weird section:  
---
Increasing protection prayers effectiveness is gonna make NH fighting, which already results in a kill very, very infrequently, that much harder which in my mind is gonna make the really, really good NHers that much better, and the bad\\new NHers that much worse...thus increasing the likelihood they'll stop going to the wild to PK. I don't think prayer needs nerfed or boosted, tbh.   
---
I think the LMS changes are GOOD, but I think the reward ideas are BAD. LMS, in my mind, should be the segway into real PVP (I'm sure I'll get flamed but this, but minigame isn't pvp IN THIS GAME where death is supposed to be dangerous) so why not give people a taste of what the wild is ultimately about: a way to get phat loot. Give LMS participants a key that upgrades every time they get a kill, and when they eventually die (or win) let that key give them a roll (with increasing chances the more kills they get) on all the gear they 'pk'd' during the game. you give people more fashionscape, and it'll be farmed for that and forgotten. You let a noob Pk a mystic top because he got 5 kills in a pvp-esque mini game and you just might get the idea that 'hey, I could kill people for money in this game' to stick in someone's mind. Maybe this breaks the game in a way that I haven't considered, but I think letting LMS be a real way to get loots to mimic real pvp would be the best way to get people interested in PvP...but maybe that's why I'm not a developer?   
---
As for the BH system.....uh....'updates' I'll wait until the full blog to decide, but I really hope you've got more planned than a leader board and more tradeable emblems.
---
Green pixels strike again!!
---
I don't get it could you elaborate?
---
Barrier of entry is independent of skill gap. Tho i agree that more tanky is bad. They should make it so if u pray range u loss defences vs magic and melee. Same skill gap result yet now people are less tanky than before which is a major issue in rs pvp. 
---
I agree that barrier of entry is too high. Why pvp when zulrah is 2-4m/h? Everyone and i do mean everyone should at least be making 1m/h in this day and age.
---
If you are very new get one skill to 200M and you will know why it isn't needed.
---
Man this comment is so out of touch with PvP
---
Problem is it's not always clear at first if it's a clan or just a small team, and if theres other people with you they might not even target you so maybe you could've gotten away, having to insta-suicide everytime some people show up to avoid getting d speared into ancient mace instead of trying to tank it out and hopefully escape just gives more power to clans when they already rule multi well enough. Though I guess the lack of d claws at revs makes surviving solo and small teams easier.
---
It looks like she has a dick from the back. The pic on the right would've been enough on its own.
---
Run escape!
---
Easy way to get to places like fountain of glory with minimal risk since almost anyone can tank from 40-20 in f2p.
---
I mean, LMS can make money without having to risk a bunch of gear. It is also more approachable since it has a free mode and it doesn't require a PvP build.
---
&gt; There is no scenario I can possibly think of where you would pick rapier from the choice of rapier, lance, BoS apart from dark beasts (lol).
---
Vasa crystals?
---
EDIT: Rapier is better than lance there but if you have a lance for Olm you may as well just use the lance at Vasa too and save an inv space.
---
Or you know just keep the delay on re-tbing someone like we currently have. I'm pretty sure if you killed the tber they wouldn't allow you to get re tbed right away.

---
It's not about the update itself, which I'm in favor of in this example. It's about how they're going about it. As far as precedent, imagine it like this. You're a pretty young thing, and you start dating this guy. You're super into him, but you don't know how into you he is. And then he cheats on you. You're devastated, break it off, and stop talking to him. A few years later, you see his brother at a coffee shop, you start talking, and you see all of the things you loved about guy1 in his brother. You start going out. You always have this worry in the back of your head, like "he reminds me of his brother so much, but how similar will he be?" But so far, he's been great. Not perfect, but he values your opinions, and he listens to you. Until you find out he got his dick sucked by a stripper at a bachelor party you didn't know he was going to. He didn't have sex with her, but now the genies out of the bottle. He's showing those same old signs that his brother did, and you don't know what he'll do next now that THIS is okay.

&gt;i do recommend keeping your def lower

Hey man, I saw you had a couple responses already but I thought I'd throw our name out there. Noble Bros cc is a PvM/skill cc. We average 90-110 in cb level but accept all levels. We do almost daily bossing including but not limited to Gwd, Dks, and corp. We also organize revs (pvm and pvp) groups. Our higher levels (100+) often do raids together as well. On weekends we do Bandos or corp masses so that our lower levels can have some fun and get a chance at some good drops. We have a skill of the week competition every week, whoever has the most xp gained in that skill by the end of the week gets a cash prize and gets to choose the next skill. We're looking for fun loving players who like to participate in group activities, and have fun chatting while enjoying the grind. We have a discord for the cc as well or those who like to voice chat or when we're doing pvp/pvm events. We have players on at all times during the day, although we do have primarily a US based player base so we peak during those prime hours.

Jagex has straight up said that using 1 input to produce more than 1 output is considered botting and bannable. So if you click once, but two accounts move, that's botting by Jagex definition.
---
Wildy gwd is deserted anyway, I've done like 8 full spirit mages tasks there without seeing a single pker. Why do you even need to worry about banking keys?
---
As a W45 DMM player, id like to address a few things in regards to the changes.
---
1. The change from 6 hours to the proposed 12 hours is not nearly enough time for a new player to get an account even remotely close to being in line with people who actively play the server. 
---
2. These quest unlocks are good but even more quest unlocks would be nice in order for people to get into the server faster (a lot of these questing items are impossible to buy the GE and need to be gathered manually.)
---
3. Venom as a whole needs to be needed on this server (along with the heavy ballista) to make it more viable for lower levels to stand any chance at survival. 
---
4. An updated rule list because all the rules on the DMM page are outdated and none of them reflect the actual way any of the rules work in the DMM W45 server. An example of this is that you no longer lose any XP if unskulled (although it still reflects that you will lose 25% in unprotected skills)
---
This only highlights a few of the issues with the W45 server but overall it‚Äôs nice that they took us into consideration for this blog.
---
Here's an idea: maybe don't beg for RSGP on the day your mom dies. Maybe don't play Runescape at all. Maybe you have more important things to occupy your mind on such a day.
---
Would take too much dev time as they would have to make everything 2x. Not gonna happen from Jagex.
---
upvote jagex needs to poll everything. they aren't the ones playing the game, we are. this is supposed to be a REPLICA of 2007. That should mean no minor unneeded bullshit kthx
---
They also drop tinderboxes... Maybe they train firemaking?!?!?!
---
Hasty is just for getting KC as my zammy item, I have arclight in my inventory
---
Would love to of had a input in the pvp changes, I quit for 5 years but I have over 1k hours pking.  I have yet to pk because it looks terrible, If you want pking to be good look at what made it so popular pre eoc.  Instead of getting a variety of opinions the went after streamers.  Imagine if woox made a boss, no one would enjoy it due the niche/difficulty.  Just because some 1 is a streamer does not mean they have a good insight into the game.
---
Doesn't mean that the puppy isn't one of the coolest pets.

No, it isn't. "Most popular" and "best" are not the same thing, one is objective and the other subjective. 
---
In order to be the most popular, you need to cater to the masses. But OSRS has gotten to where it is today by doing the opposite of that: catering to a niche. Games that do this tend to have highly dedicated player bases, but shifting gears to mass appeal is one of the quickest ways to alienate that player base. Dethroning WoW has proven impossible even for other modern, mass appeal MMOs. A dated, mega-grindy MMO like OSRS doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell.
---
I really really like runescape 3's "path" system. You pick a path and it has several challenges with incremental difficulty. Obviously we'd limit to the early game here, but we could have a "gatherer path", "artisan path", "warrior path", "adventurer path" (for quests) and so on, to guide the players into a nice baseline of stats and exploration. Completing a path could give a small token to the account, to feel rewarding.
---
If it doesn't get in the way in terms of UI space (can be easily dismissable), I think there are little downsides and heavy upsides in terms of guiding the new players through those first overwhelming hours.
---
I completely understand that. What I meant by 1v1 is you actually have to ‚Äútry out‚Äù by 1v1ing their higher ups. Never meant it to come by they are a 1v1 Clan. 
---
Trust me I see all the videos of a 30 man death dot and them getting Mills of loot
---
That‚Äôs the thing though, the game isn‚Äôt dying. Osrs is one of the only growing MMOs - and it‚Äôs current philosophy is why.
---
Game is on its deathbed, prove me wrong
---
It's the only way they can have a form of item sink since dying is almost always not a risk.
---
If we had the old 2 minute death timers back we wouldn't need degradable items.

The thing is, it's been the most successful year for Jagex in their 18 years of existance (2018, at least). RS3 might actually be breaking even at this point, it's not a failure. And yeah, the success is mostly from OS, but still..
---
I did a regular ironman and I rushed to 50 fm and did the Winterthot grind to 99. My big mistake so far is that I didn't open the crates after leveling up my other skills too. Currently,  I'm doing some achievement diaries, getting 82 hunter and then going to grind some slayer for a bit! I'd try to find something that would give you good resources to start with like i did with Wintertodt.
---
You make a good point but this is all because of spiteful voters that vote no to all pvp content. How else can the pvp community get needed changes and updates if vote no to pvp memers have the majority vote. These same voters also have no idea about what goes on in pvp so even if they weren't spitefully voting no, they're making uninformed votes. This is a good move by Jagex.
---
I think Overloads would be the next logical step, but that's not going to pass a poll any time soon.
---
I use to pk, and was fairly good at it (pure &amp; 70 def main), back before EOC.  The reason its lame to me is that most people(that use a gmaul) if not all of them just dice roll with gmaul specs trying to stack people from 90-100% hp.  The anti-pking I do now is just me pre-venging at a bank with a 1 veng cast 1 dose super combat, barrows gloves, and a gmaul in my inventory + and inventory of bones.  I'm not there to actually fight people but if someone attacks me I can usually lame them out with the 2 vengs and a g maul with basically no gear.  
---
With the actual pure pking that I did back in the day, it was basically just all rune knives into g maul.  I would just spec people 30 seconds into the fight and they would die 90% of the time because I SW proded that shit out of my account.
---
You don't PK huh? watch the best streamer you know NH people, and they'll tele 15 times before people get kills. Prayers are in a good spot where they're at, making them stronger helps nothing about the current PVP problem.

Thank god there's some F2Pers here who will continue fighting this good fight. Does Jagex not remember that Runescape is an adventure game? Where's the adventure if you're just instantly where you want to be?
---
Why so you risk over 25k, and removed people pking with ags/maul, claws/maul with no risk but extremely powerful combo.
---

Canoeing is massively mis-levelled. 35 or something for the world's slowest trip to Edgeville? L

So it would give players that actually train construction a slight boost in time. Great.

Well yeah but that's like almost an exact description of runecrafting.. tons of different methods all with different xp, gp, afk rates, requirements, etc. I'm of the opinion that RC is one of the best balanced skills in the game.

Ah you kill them before the bridge?

---
Making it cost a few mill will only make the 1 / 13 pray 50 attack G maulers get 31 pray, which is nearly as good anyway. Unless you make the 50% upgraded G maul have a higher attack requirement, that would solve it.
---
Didn't you guys hear? Adding in small qol changes that affect the first hour of gameplay to help retain more players is literally EOC
---
The point of OSRS is that everything (aside from integrity updates) is polled.
---
Once we start picking and choosing what that applies to instead of it being a blanket process on all updates, we lose what makes OSRS *OSRS*.

There are tons of new players playing because of Mobile. F2P pking isnt that dead actually and TB would revive it more.

this sub's a bunch of rick and morty viewers sometimes god damn. i know the point of memes is to reuse them but this 92 half of 99 thing is the stalest meme out there

It bothers me so much that people have the time to give poor reviews on things that can be solved via google.
---
The core basics and fundamental mechanics in Runescape should not be altered with. Full stop.
---
hoes mad

that's pretty much the most 'I don't pk' answer I've ever gotten, cheers for that.
---
Finally some good fucking news
---
No, Bis means Bro I'm straight
---
well post-77 rc is afk, so it's not really hard to do.
---
and the insta tele to duradel feels so much better than gem mine or npc contact
---
Strawman is when you pretend that you argue but actually you argue against a made up comment that changes the point the other person is making. Just like he did with my comment.
---
I think that will be a very unpopular opinion. With most skills there are a few different methods that people do based on whether they go the xp route, money route or convenience route. With RC the only route anyone takes is lavas till 70, then RC in Zeah. Almost nobody deviates from that now. Other than that, people prioritise levelling it with xp fandoms and tears of guthix.
---
Technically one is buyable, but it could be argued the time it takes to get 80 dungeoneering is equivalent to the time it takes to get the money for ghrazi rapier. They both seem like long grinds.
---
I probably just need to keep going at it and just get a better hang of it. While it was mostly for the diary, maybe i can actually start making that good money...

Yeah lmao, dragon darts are the exact opposite of what a crush weapon would be.

Give them more information about quests after they are teleported to lumbridge and guide them through cooks assistant.

If we‚Äôre talking about Teleblock magically being declared an integrity issue, try to understand the conflict of interest for voting players. 
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get teleblocked so I‚Äôll vote no‚Äù - People will not vote for something that will get them pk‚Äôed or will make it harder for them to escape, even if it was in the game before.
---
Ya u can
---
Oh okay, I always thought they didn‚Äôt drop! Thanks!
---
But it is the same as buying it directly. Just because it gives you an item that you can put on GE for a price range doesn‚Äôt make it any different than paying $10 for whatever the insta-sell price would be.

No it doesn't. This is literally the "omg green construction icon pixel = EOC confirmed" meme but unironically

People like you are the reason I hope they force warding in unpolled or rig it for real

Get over it

Its actually abused to hell on high risk fights
---
Get your two claw specs off and imp-box it so you can have you elder maul as the new +1
---
that makes no sense though. "hey you collected a bunch of tickets, i'll allow you to jump across a rock in shilo village"?
---
why cant we have agility shortcuts just be agility shortcuts?
---
yeah the dudes standing by the general store. one makes it so arrows/bolts/etc you pick up are put into the quiver slot if they match your current ammo in quiver slot. the other makes it so runes that you pick up are added tothe rune pouch if they match the runes in the pouch already
---
I really didn‚Äôt like in RS3 when they added the stuff for achievement diaries that would pop up on your screen and put ugly yellow lines and markers on the map and ground ‚Äúleading you‚Äù around. Ugly and takes away from the learning and discovery. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes twice here
---
You just don't know how it works. They've already updated it so you can't get smited for more than your current hp. So if your pray is higher than your hp, you can't be smited. So no, you don't have to suicide, at most you drink a dose or two of zammy brew, and maybe a ppot.
---
But I guess just keep complaining about things you have no idea about.
---
Damn bro, my bad. I'm sorry I had this thought earlier and didn't scour the sub looking for similar posts. Eat a rock cake after overloading at 51hp.
---
3rd party clients should be removed, and Jagex should incorproate the most convenient features of them.
---
One of the main problems is how many different transportation options they are and how none of them are made obvious to new players in game.      
---
You've got fairy rings, spirit trees, multiple different spell books and their teleports, a ton of jewelry teleports, mini games, eagles, charters, air balloons, canoes, item teleports, teleport scrolls, + more. Keeping track of them all and knowing which to use in every situation is difficult for  even experience players.
---
So the only problem is that for certain items, they just will never pass polling, and for the sole reason that the large majority of the player base doesn't partake in this. 
---
If there was a pole to remove pvp from the game it would probably pass, just because people who don't actually pvp and have died trying to do something simple like clue scrolls, or wildy slayer task, or black chins, or whatever and are angry about it want to get back at the pvp community. Some of these changes need to happen but would never get polled through because of spite. There's absolutely no reason tb shouldn't be f2p, name one. The only reason it hasn't passed 3 times is because of people who it has 0 effect on voting no on it because its a pvp update.
---
Doesn't bode well for what happens after death
---
Pvp worlds lol? It literally prevents all of this.
---
Sucks man. I only trust my clannies that I‚Äôve known for a while. We all lend each other 10m+ in gear pretty regularly, and we always give it back.
---
No, it means Best In Seat when speaking of Jmods
---
Nice man! What's ur username ill add you
---
the minigame is just BORING dude :&lt;
---
Do you think u could teleblock yourself on an alt and then when u need out kill or log out of the alt?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve timed it both ways and it‚Äôs a little faster in the main area. There‚Äôs two imps and two icefiends that are easy kills and then tagging the bloodveld and warewolves
---
I got trident of the swamp as my first upgrade (don't have anything else you listed) and I just got my first zulrah kc. So... there's my two cents lol.

Seeing this made me realize how shit my RNG really is. Done 500+ meds and no rangers

---
You guys are so out of touch lately.
---
Apparently OP is so retarded that he thinks making traveling more convenient for f2p is equivalent to EOC. Why is spending 5 minutes to walk to a location any different than spending 10 seconds to teleport to that same location? Honestly it‚Äôs retards like this that I kinda hate the polling system. I‚Äôm also speaking as near maxed player so if the update is implemented its not going to effect me that much.
---
This is literally the "omg green construction icon pixel = EOC confirmed" meme but unironically
---
People like you are the reason I hope they force warding in unpolled or rig it for real. That way you can finally quit the game and we can all be spared from having to read more posts like this
---
I see 99 agility and 98 prayer gotcha account now bitch!
---
People are posting 2007scape memes elsewhere.
---
fuck that, let the new players burn as we did
---
I‚Äôve gotten both, sorry you feel the need to call someone names over a comment.
---
"we don't care" sweetie Jagex care, have you seen what they plan to do to the game to make new players stay?
---
Well that's just logical and doesn't affect any of us
---
Yeah if they're going to offer a new free transport system, it should be permanent, otherwise new players are just going to be confused and upset when it stops working.
---
Yeah it helps boost the signal chain so you're not losing as much gain
---
&gt;You find something entertaining that I don't smdh
---
Lmao okay buddy.
---
\&gt;when you can create double natures but also fish trout
---
That's a really gimmicky excuse. Plenty of weapons could fit the theme of an elven combatant. But not a chained ball of spikes nailed to a stick, even if you make it out of crystal.

low level bis for p2p would make maulers faster to train, pretty much the only 'ree' I could see happening. Personally I hate early game arrows pointing me everywhere, but if it works for others.

Not that I can I'll zulrah as is, but with this change, if never be able to

It‚Äôs a meme from the crab rave song. Here‚Äôs an example that was really popular.

---
I like the ride on a cart traveling around type thing. It would show a new player which direction to go. I would have liked that back in the day. Also, f2p agility would be nice
---
I made a thread about it before asking people and there were mixed opinions on it so I went with attack anyways since my main weapon is a whip.. 
---
In theory your argument can be higher strength = bigger hits with less accuracy = less chance hitting the max hit from my strength level
---
Whatever it works and I just want to max all my melee stats
---
max ur combat and then yes
---
I think there should def be a cool down but I‚Äôm not opposed to loadstones
---
I feel like you didn‚Äôt read the comment you replied to
---
Not only that but 2 kodai's so 6 rolls on that part of the table.
---
Taking convenience away is so opposite of the entire progression of runescape, where everything you train is to increase convenience. Adding a path indicator to the world map would be helpful, but a transport system just for the beginning of the game is asking for trouble.
---
People in this community lose their ever loving minds when you recommend overhauling all the really shitty agility short cuts.
---
They come at you red faced and screaming about how you shouldn't be rewarded for leveling one of the most dreaded and unfun skills in the game, you need to do diaries first. ^^Never ^^mind ^^the ^^fact ^^that ^^no ^^other ^^skill ^^has ^^this ^^issue.

What's wrong with the map?

Like: gmaul and f2p tb. Make gmaul attachment untradeable or make it consume the gmaul so we have an item sink.
---
Dislike: looting bag and slayer keys.
---
Talk to Donnie or Gee and ask them to show you around would be my suggestion.
---
&gt;Someone reused a picture for a meme that didn't have anything to do remotely about the original one.
---
*Obviously* reposting. Ban this man smh my head.
---
Its super dead now
---
Ok, nerf the defense.
---
You'll still use it in the wilderness because even with half the defense, as you said, it's 10k.
---
It's cheap, replaceable, and easily supplied.
---
Dragons are slain 24/7 because of their bones (prayer) and hides (crafting training). 
---
It isn't too powerful: it's just the standard set. 
---
Defensively: it isn't exactly tank gear. It's good all around, but you'll be hard-pressed to tank strong melee or ranged hits with black dhide. You'll tank magic somewhat reliably, but that's the combat triangle.
---
I don't see dhide as an issue: PvP has bigger issues than dhide. 
---
Is it good: yes, very much so. That said, I don't see it as being OP. It's definitely the best craftable armor (rune be damned), but blame jagex for locking rune behind 99 smithing (or shops/drops) and making magic gear ridiculously rare. 
---
I do understand where people see it as being an issue, but you can't say gmaul is OP and Dhide is OP when you'll likely be using that maul on dhide. They're diferent leagues of OP IMO.
---
That said: I'm also not a pvper, so maybe I don't quite have the same perspective as you do.
---
OSRS should be taken off mobile platforms and all mobile players should be euthanized. That is my opinion on this blog
---
Lol you are totally right. But then i would say agi &gt; wc  &gt; fletching(if you can store the logs) &gt; fm?
---
Locking the brokenness of gmaul behind 10m BH point will only make things worse. It's sad that Jagex has absolutely no idea how to balance pvp
---
inb4 I was rune 2 last season, this is just my steel 5 smurf
---
Yea, and bonds worked out great. Why not continue the trend?
---
That's a perfect Thurgo face lmao
---
That shortcut's chance of success should honestly be increased to more accurately represent your Agility level.
---
Believe it or not, I specced a freakin' 34 yesterday. Mfw when I got launched back to full HP.
---
same thing with d claws and ags.. you have extremely bad odds with gmaul on defence if you only use that. Bring dragon claws instead of gmaul, you'll have more anti-pk kills than with a gmaul. Thats my point
---
Why did i click this
---
Give us noted dragon bones from green/lava dragons and then see wilderness activity all over the place.  On top of that add a new green dragon boss in a cavern that the green dragons have been guarding whole time.  Talk about upside potential for gp/hr.... 
---
Jugs of wine won‚Äôt cut it. There is a whole community that was recruited from the creation and revival of the rev caves.  Could we get a second round of revival but on the other side of the wilderness?
---
Edit: green dragon boss pet? New grind for one of the most nostalgic parts of the wilderness.

Maybe you should cater to your existing community instead of people who've never played the game before.

---
look bud, we've all been to a family reunion, ok.
---

---
Woox is a great example of an outlier, and creating an exception for him creates an exception for everyone else. Jagex isn't going to by hand investigate hundreds of thousands of accounts that do quick prayer switches. Woox is mechanically good, his ability to pray flick is nothing special. It's not that he just does pray switching good, its that he does them good while maintaining 10 other things. Things such as tick eating while prayer flicking, moving his character to a spot to be ready to attack something and switching gear at the same time. Doing all of those in a 1.5 second timeframe is where it gets ridiculous, and although someone might cheat to maintain ONE of those things, they aren't doing all of them. This would be why it would be hard to detect.
---

I thought you were messing with me, then I finished a fire giant task with 5 keys in total. Damn, you're right! Better make it 1:10 crystal key ratio! That'll do it!
---
Dude you can do this. The hardest part is those first few kills :) around 50kc you‚Äôll start getting two kill trips too! 
---
If you haven‚Äôt, try learning one or two phases first and logging out if phase 4 pops up because it is guaranteed to do the most damage due to almost double the amount of undodgeable snakeling spawns
---
Pretty much what they did with burthorpe/taverly on rs3. Added skill guides for every skill that get you do to do something related to the skill once you leave the little Ashdale tutorial.
---
She can probably speak for herself without white knights, lmao.
---
Na for sure that's what it was, also not having the GE made it that much more time consuming.. I love both types of ways of playing the game and I wouldn't trade it for anything.. it has its ups and downs, both of em.. but it's for sure that today we can't play like we did before: hitting up gnomeball and bank standing trying to sell 83 lobbies
---
Thank you for correcting me.
---
Adding a transport system is a horrible solution and changes the game too much IMO.
---
*instead do something like...*
---
Add springs along some paths that one can drink from to refresh energy.
---
Get players marking citys on the map and use lines ingame to show them where to go.
---
We‚Äôre comparing hamburgers to an mmo game now. Nice.
---
Adding onto Jimmy Buffet's idea, they could have a sort of "adventuring coach" that gets introduced in lumbridge, with a crystal ball that lets you chat with him from anywhere. He can give goals, advice, point you toward quests, and maybe even jobs with some "cute noob" rewards like a steel scimitar early on
---
There is a generous delay on getting teleblocked after your first teleblock wears out
---
Sometimes I do that I won‚Äôt lie but this time I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm for real I think it‚Äôs lame they are adding f2p teleblock
---
I think sea is not as strict as other hydrological terms. For example, Mediterranean vs Caspian Sea
---
It doesn't hinder any player group in the whole game and helps with f2p pker retention. Now you say it doesn't matter but almost everyone of those f2p pkers buys membership to train their accounts.
---
Excuse me, but I came back to the topic and looked at your username, wanted to know if it was ironic or not and no, you're a fucking bully

The fact this stupid shit gets upvoted is the reason you dumb cunts complain about shit all the time.

Zero reasonable feedback is given and all you morons do is post memes all day and suck each other off, literally the most pathetic subreddit on this garbage site.

Temple Trekking is dead content on Ironman mode too if you're chasing EHP. Zulrah gives more than enough pure essence and bowstrings are dead content -- seaweed/sand or TzHaar Thieving+gem cutting are the metas. Or just charters.

If you're doing TT on Ironman mode, you're technically wasting time in the grand scheme of things.

Just the way games have changed in the past 15 years, old games EVERYTHING was new so you just explored and examined things and learned.
---
Now games you're thrown in an environment, not meant to explore but follow a main path. And that's what people expect I guess.

you can put "no billing info" as a response to them asking for billing info lol... you sure whoever hacked you isnt just trying to also steal your cc info?

Someone made a popular meme with the crab rave song and we here at osrs take our memes and never let go.
---
I mean I'm not upset, it just was obviously not an actual question, hence the humor flair and not the question flair.
---
It's tempting. I just don't want to risk my main with hundreds of hours for a few mage levels
---
Was it you who rang the bell of awakening?
---
I wanted to be one of the first 99s at osrs launch and was in top 10 agility but burned out at 84. Having that 84 agi from 2 years ago has been a godsend every time I come back to the game.
---
As others have said it can be a slippery slope when trying to appeal to the masses, I started playing this game in 5th grade.. that was 15 years ago, i told my young self I would never stop playing and I‚Äôve stayed true. I saw how Runescape changed over time and the drama that followed it, it‚Äôs like they were trying to replicate WoW and it just didn‚Äôt work.. at least to those of us who enjoyed Runescape just the way it was, no need to change the combat or turn burthorpe into the starting area.. it‚Äôs too hand hold-y, I continued to play rs3 on and off for years until osrs came out because I loved the game so much that I forced myself to look at it a different way so I wouldn‚Äôt have to quit the game I said I never would. 
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that it‚Äôs scary that they want to become the most popular MMO because that means you change the appeal, the raw beauty of Gielenor, not knowing what to do, asking for help, it‚Äôs totally old school and there‚Äôs nothing like it. RS3 Burthorpe starting area is exactly what they did to cater to the biggest variety of new players. $$ Gotta keep that retention $$ /s 
---
I totally get it though, it‚Äôs a business and if this is what they need to do for growth instead of MTX we can‚Äôt really get too upset. It could definitely be worse. I think finding some middle ground would be nice.. how about an NPC outside lumbridge castle that teleports you to an instance or location sorta like the starting area of Burthorpe from RS3, it wouldn‚Äôt change anything in Lumbridge, if they want hand holding or guidance they have the ability to do so. They could even have an area where players who want to help could hang out and give advice. Carpet rides are a neat idea but in my opinion I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs travel that has people leaving quickly, I think it‚Äôs the lack of goals. What keeps us all here is we have a mission in mind and we chip away at it, if we could right away give a task to a new player I think that would hook them in much much faster. 
---
‚ÄúGo to the lumbridge cow pen and collect an inventory of cowhides, sell them at the grand exchange and buy a steel scimitar‚Äù
---
Hint: click the map icon above the minimap, cows are located in the pen along the desert border, the grand exchange is located north in the city of varrock, watch out for the dark wizards on your way! the grand exchange is a great way to buy and sell your items to save up for stronger weapons/armor, banks can be used to store mass amounts of cowhides to sell larger sums‚Äù
---
Just that little quest will have them playing for 30 mins and will show them the beauty of Runescape, they will get their steel scimitar and want to work till 5 attack to get it, they can see all the other tiers of weapons that they can try and save up for. Once you have your first goal it opens up all other aspects of the game slowly but surely.
---
Didn‚Äôt think I would type this much but I care about this game too much to not have said anything
---
Edit: maybe all we need is to spawn with a mission book, once completed you receive 20k coins, there would be 10 goals and each of those goals are earning you money as well such as the cowhide one.. idk I‚Äôm just throwing ideas out there, I strongly believe new players spawn in lumbridge and without a goal decide the game is dumb and too much to take in, why would sending them off to varrock change any of that? Yeah they can travel but once they get to their destination they‚Äôre right back to square one, no idea what to start. Sorta like how I will log off Runescape for a few days if I‚Äôm just bank standing, you need a goal to enjoy this game.
---
It's a good start at least! Been trying with mine for even longer... and still trying haha.
---
Wow.. who hurt you, man?
---
No I haven't. Why are you trying to be an asshole right now?
---
I would take either tbh. Faster exp and minimal rewards or better rewards and less exp.
---
Maybe a point system. Where you can choose rewards or exp when you gain enough. Like pest control but the exp would be different obviously.
---
Agility is just too engaging to afk and not engaging enough where after a few laps I'm falling asleep.
---
I'd just like an alternate way to train it and running from a mad boss sounded like a cool idea to me.
---
Maybe those mole slippers as a reward? Haha
---
I agree with leaving this unpolled, as long as they stay true to what they stated a bunch of times; not affecting the early game nostalgia
---
I thought this was common knowledge when I was 12 years old. I still do, but I did then too

Skeletal vissage from Vorkath, ~800kc a few months ago. First real drop in my osrs career. Felt pretty good, funded my 90 construction.

What do you mean cc?
---
Graceful Set, constant shortcuts, faster energy regen; yeah I'd say it's worth it. 99 probably isn't worth it though.
---
Swap range and stab defence, maybe add a little extra to the ranged defense. That way lance is bis in there but range can still work if you like the woox walking BP method. I will say my fastest lance time still beats my fastest tbow time, but that was all RNG.

Wow is the most popular mmorpg game and has been since release basically so not sure id use this as the basis of ur argument lmao.

If ur game is the best late game but not retaining players early game, it doesnt matter. 
---
There is no direction in runescape which makes people stop playing as they arent experienced enough to decide themselves. A little hand holding can be just the push they need.
---
credit card
---
Exactly what I thought, typical gmaul shitter is what up sound like. Your days of risking 60k are coming to end rag bot
---
I like these changes as long as they stay minimalistic. They introduced a lot of these things for new players in the main game around 2012-2013, and I think it just added a lot of unnecessary clutter to the game. It felt like there was actually too much going on in the new burthorpe area that they added.
---
I'm also unsure about the low level teleports. I think the walks between cities is what makes lower level questing like rune mysteries memorable. These quests feel significant without teleports. With teleports they are like 2 minute quests. 
---
Instead, perhaps give players a quick cutscene tour of varrock and draynor village. Show them the path they must take to make the objectives clear and then let them have it. Also, maybe direct them to actually complete the quests. I think the quest line is the best way for new players to get into the game. So, encouraging them to do the quests might be a great way to up player retention.
---
Isn't the magic carpet idea essentially the gnome copters from back in \~2008?
---
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt skip steel dragons deserves one
---
It‚Äôs a learning experience. Losing everything I had made me turn right back around and grind for everything back. No participation trophies here.
---
Most likely they saw these early quitters never left reached varrock or draynor before quitting. Maybe they wandered around and couldn't find anything cool so they logged off forever. Varrock is pretty cool.
---
This feels so familiar for some reason
---
It was one of my first few slayer tasks and didn't have the points to skip and couldn't be bothered resetting tasks. Payed off :D
---
I don't think making teleblock f2p is considered an "integrity" update, just like how beginner clues aren't considered an integrity update when they added clue scrolls to f2p. An integrity update would be more like the duel arena tax, hiding poll results, lowering the threshold for polls to pass, etc.
---
I know what you mean, It's kind of counter intuitive and difficult to quantify though.
---
I reckon this is a bit of a case of seeing what they can get away with in order to increase the follow through rate into membership (pulling in more money) without doing major damage to player opinions/ the games charm.
---
I'm happy to wait and see as I personally believe that a bit of increased hand holding in the early game for the sake of a larger/more interested player base in the later game could be positive
---
The easier design choice is a culture having weapons that do the job but don't seem out of place for them. Crush weapon? Sure. Flail? No. They wouldn't have made one to begin with. Same way I wouldn't expect dwarves to use rapiers.    
---
I'm not arguing against adding a crush weapon to the game, I'm just saying given the context of its release, a flail doesn't make sense.    
---
"They use weapons so why not any weapon?" just isn't a solid enough argument to change my mind.
---
How are deaths punishing in osrs? You got 1 hour to get your stuff
---
Don't you just hate it when you're playing a normal account and James Charles tries to pressure you into playing an ironman???
---
Or when they tell you they were banking but you've been there for an hour already.
---
Christ look at the seed pack on that dude.
---
Ags attack bonus is +132 with double accuracy on special attack. 
---
Dragon claws attack bonus are +57 and the special attacks accuracy is insane because accuracy rolls 4 times (very difficult to hit 0).                   
---
Granite maul attack bonus is +81, thats it.                          
---
On dharoks, gmaul spec has only 18% success rate, now gl specing that x3 AND HITTING OVER 33 on each hit to one hit (assuming they have 99 hp and not anglered/brewed).                                              
---
Can you KO with an ags ? Yes, but it'll be difficult cus its a slow weapon. You'll need just as much rng with an ags than gmaul.                                  
---
Can you KO with dragon claws ? Yes, because of the "surprise" attack that confuses the pker and being a 4t weapon, it specs fast, if hes not ready to eat, he'll most likely die and hitting 99+ isnt complicated since it has extremely high accuracy, especially with vengeance. You only need to hit 50x2 specs if they dont eat, and without vengeance. In opposition to 3 x33 with gmaul. Let me tell you that x2 50 is 200x easier to get                                 
---
Can you KO with gmaul? In theory, yes, but how often? Almost fucking never because of its accuracy. I haven't calced it, but i dont suppose you can get a kill with gmaul only anti pking someone that knows atleast a little bit what he's doing unless you get extremely lucky. 
---
Those are facts and numbers, not just my opinion. You can have whatever opinion on those, "facts dont care about your feelings". Runescape isn't all about max hits, its also a lot about accuracy 
---
What makes a gmaul too strong ? The fact it can be combined with items like dclaws, ags, or any high slow hitting weapon after the x2 spec.
---
1. New players don't know that.
---
2. If they died at dark wizards, they're not going to be able to pick their stuff up.
---
They also drop axes. It all makes sense now
---
Changing new player experience: IDGAF
---
Not polling stuff because "It takes too long": Not cool. I refuse to believe this is a such a huge emergency that it can't wait a month.
---
Only here for the J-Mod smackdown
---
Yeah, sadly skilling in general gets the worst of the consequences
---
Lol that‚Äôs literally just botting
---
OK, as an ironman I find issue with the statement "The tasks and rewards won‚Äôt be available for Iron accounts. We don‚Äôt want to disrupt the early game meta for restricted accounts.". I did not sign up for a static, unchanging subgame of OSRS; balance changes hit me too, and non-multiplayer-only content is added for me too. 
---
*Why* should I get **punished** with additional restrictions which I did not agree to when deciding to make a normal [non-hardcore/ultimate] Ironman account, which [at the time of creation] entailed simply the inability to transfer funds and goods to my account from other accounts / receive aid from other accounts in combat? If this content does not involve trading or other cooperative elements [which would be a valid reason to restrict ironman access to it], then why should I or any other Ironman not be able to access it? 
---
TLDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsW9MlYu31g &lt;Jagex
---
the main reason is because its the only skill that sees reasonable amount of updates, if others skills did to then it wouldn be an issue.
---
The question mark is what makes it appear to be a question.
---
They should reintroduce the ability to rest to restore your run energy.
---
Sure, and that's why you're commenting so strongly in a subreddit about this game, about a tool you don't use, for a game you don't play. That makes perfect sense.
---
A voting system that prevents the game's (schooled and skilled) developers from implementing what they deem healthy for the longevity of the game was the real mistake here. While it may have been a necessary statement to give all power to the players back in 2013, promising players an often thoughtless say on the fate of *every single* update has prevented (or in case of F2P TB, delayed) so many changes beneficial to the game's health.
---
The devs have clearly stated that it's most important for them to make sure these changes blend in well with Old School, and that they don't disrupt the nostalgic veteran experience. I, for one, trust their intentions on this matter.
---
idk why people are so into artisan. look at how negatively 99 capes/max capes/post 99 fucked up production skills. production skills are now entirely useless outside hitting 99/diary/quest reqs and are just money drains.
---
It's as much of an integrity change as something can get. This is about retaining new players; not new mid/lategame content.
---
/r/runescape
---
the fact people still kill guards for clues is mind blowing lol
---
Doing the best gp / h method for hours and hours to pay for skills that serve zero purpose to a normal account does not seem entertaining when you could actually play more than 5% of the game on an ironman.
---
How long ago did you start this account? Mad props.
---
this is 100% brilliant.  i rewatched this episode the other day, and i could *hear* him talking about OSRS on this gif lmao
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
The gold comes from the game either way. Do you think people are duplicating gold? It has to be farmed no matter what. That's not the issue.
---
Bonds are better because it gives Jagex revenue and because 3rd party gold trading is often tied to real world crime. Also people selling bonds tend to be players, whereas people selling 3rd party gold are often bots.
---
I would counter that we should remove Skilling drops from PvM drop tables.
---
Agreed. I would be worried that a new player may go afk during something like a carpet ride when they realize it‚Äôs automatic and then not be able to find their way back if their time runs out.
---
Hi, it‚Äôs me, James Charles
---
As an owner of black Air Force 1 Low's I feel personally attacked
---
"Well now that I think about it..." -Jagex Probably
---
It's alright. They're not nearly as well placed as the regular teleports (Varrock is by the dark wizards, edgeville is close to the monastery) so they're not as good of an option. Additionally, for new or returning players, they're pretty convenient ways to avoid the long travel times that the new account experience requires. Low level content is pretty spread out.
---
600+ dry :))))
---
Looting bag would definitely cause some balancing issues if it was widely available on PvP worlds, especially with skilling activities.  That being said, i think its an interesting incentive to have PvP worlds be more active outside of plain 'pking'
---
F2P Trouble Brewing
---
This is really, really bad. You don't get to decide that something shouldn't be polled because you want to streamline the content in faster, what a horrible fucking precedent. Fuck off
---
In all seriousness bfa has been an absolute shit show and guilds are falling apart constantly because of people quitting and not having enough to fill out the roster.
---
There's never been this much criticism and downrate hate for an expansion before. Blizzards recent sales call also mentioned they've lost something like 8m players since the last call I believe? I think it was 43m to 35m across all games, obviously some was from overwatch and other games but obviously a significant portion of it was from wow.
---
They won't know if they don't die. Learning this at level 3-10 will be much better than learning this later on whenever their first real death is, which could cause them to risk losing much more if they still don't know the death mechanics.
---
99 rc cape so your credentials check out and before someone comments it: rc bad
---
I just worry that with the dev team being understaffed as it is, that this takes away from things such as the PVP rework and other much needed fixes/updates. I understand that we should try and cater to newer players to make the game more appeasing, but I'd hate to the dev team's focus spread out so much.
---
pvm doesnt drop products of production skills though, it drops the pre-reqs. if anything it keeps the cost down
---
No the point is he's getting fletching exp while doing todt, so that's another type of xp he shouldn't be allowed to get in a 1 at a time account.
---
"Wow all my items are gone, fuck this game."
---
So you didn't enjoy being in a multi clan and now want to generalize that all clans are toxic? Makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you got kicked or scammed from whatever clan you were in. Are there toxic pk clan yes, are there toxic pvm clan yes. It's the internet in 2019 why are you surprised. To also say that pk clans are any worse than pvm clans is also disingenuous when there are countless scams that go on. When you join a pk clan it's expected that you have an idea of what happens in the wilderness so if you fuck up a kill of course you'll have angry people.
---
Just read up on the wiki because I never used a sgs, but apparently it's a 100% boost in accuracy (200% in total) and 10% boost in damage (110% in total). The accuracy bonus is crazy as fuck
---
When the player count drops so does support. Without new people, the game dies.
---
it's really REALLY not. What killed WoW was badly redesigning classes and adding a grind every day "World Quests" for "Artifact Power".

Go speak to Count Check instead, get your account secure and a free TP to Varrock.
---
I‚Äôm not saying bonds are bad for the game, I‚Äôm saying that having a consumable item is different from literally buying gold...
---
If you buy a bond for ¬£10, and sell it for 3.5m, then no gold has been added into the game, but if you buy 3.5m from jagex (so the gold is just created) then 3.5m has been added into the game
---
Out of the loop, why?
---
I dont know why people are so obsessed with playing the game at maximum efficiency its mind blowing to me
---
If you‚Äôre looking to max id set your bank so you can quickly gather your farm run stuff, bust that out til you‚Äôre 99 and then use your extra time to do other stats. Kingdom I would just put a fat stack in so you can just keep your percentage up and not collect every day.
---
Interesting, thanks for the insight.
---
...oddly specific how you know so much about gold farmers ü§î

How do you filter that? Anyone can just enter the wild and kill their alt and boom you're a "pvp poll elligible"account

No, you didnt sounds mean at all. Just wanted to protect myself from the toxicity within the community. You seem very genuine
---
For sure maybe they could go more in depth or even have someone to talk to in lumby that gives you s starter quest that has you explore some areas of the map or something idk
---
Have never disagreed with a comment more than this one
---
The tutorial shows you what you can do and what lies ahead. If that captured your interest then you will go forward and figure out how to do those things without the arrow guiding you, if it wasn't interesting enough then you close the game and find something else. It's free and 1 hour is near zero investment. It's an open world mmorpg not a single player story game.
---
It's pretty close to 1/271 medium caskets per ranger boots.

I saw a guy like 3 days ago at the g.e who kept saying "my brother died, can someone give me a mil so I could make bond" every 5 min or so. Finally someone gave him 100k and he logged, and I said that's why you don't give money to beggars, all it does is encourage them, and he was like "yea I know I'm not dumb I was just trading random people 100k just for fun" and I was like "dude you clearly got baited by that dude's story" and he got so defensive that he gave away like 2m to random people trading him just to prove that he was actually giving away sets of 100k and not baiting that guy.
---
Tldr the community is retarded and actually falls for this stuff, thanks for listening to my ted talk.
---
It's a slippery slope for sure. Once you justify unpolled changes for some things it becomes easier to justify bigger leaps of reasoning.
---
Yikes, hoped the price went down with less reqs
---
"only one tick slower" translates to ""divide total dps by 5/4" or stm I mistaken?
---
I'll happily die on this hill. Quests need quest markers, everyone just types into google anyways "osrs [quest name]" It'll make playing the game funner for everyone and not feel like a chore
---
It's "good" but you're going out of your way. If you just did Zulrah, you would get pure essence passively and you need Zulrah scales anyway. So it's macro-inefficient. It's good for a way of actively obtaining them, I agree.
---
Nah that sounds more like a racist insecure virgin trump supporter dude‚Äôs rsn
---
xd I think I was so tense blood didnt rly flow.
---
Was this supposed to be a r/cutenoobs post
---
I am not sure why they had to give that reasoning. They've done unpolled updates to the early game before and no one minded, so why not just do more along those lines?
---
Soon enough they will be the only one left, so they will be the casual players!
---
lavas are drastically harder so price makes sense.
---
astrals you get like... 1m ish back per runner in runes or something.
---
Learned this recently after starting on guardians. Kind of sad I made more money off the gargoyles than their boss counterpart.
---
I think that it should have "level tiers" or something.
---
3 to 50, 51 to 80, 81 to 126
---
The first level group being "noobs," the second being "pures / specialized accounts" and the third being "mains."
---
And then of course an "all levels" mode for people that just don't care.
---
Yeah I'm not disagreeing, but an unlimited teleport to Duradel alone is pretty fantastic. It's better than some of the other diaries like Kandarin or western provinces which are pretty much pointless to get elite diaries done.
---
Well thanks for the info!
---
If the world is empty, you are correct
---
That's a pretty shallow way to look at it. Most competitive players who get good don't improve by being toxic af (mostly). They could move competitive cwars to tournament worlds so it's purely skill based instead of grinding an account all the way up. Casuals don't have to play competitively, the casuals can continue to play the 20v20 mode that's already there, or however many people are on each team, just like any other competitive game ever that have ranked modes and casual modes. It's going to take some innovation but it could truly be the ultimate ranked game.
---
Looks sick af bro! Everytime you do something you could add one more complicated item so you improve your photoshop skills each time. Not that I know much about photoshop :)
---
It is wicked though fam keep it up!
---
I mean they can update the skill guides and make people press a few more things on the UI to explain what can be done, but that's all that's needed. I mean the game is a grind of thousands of hours and takes research and understanding. If someone is so lost as to not be able to find something to do in this game without an arrow telling them how to do it, then they don't need to play this game. Last I checked the goal of OSRS was never to appeal to the mass market, and doesn't need to be dumbed down as such.  
---
Besides, a lot of shit in game is still here because it is "legacy", so if tutorial island(one of the most iconic things of this game) gets changed, then that opens the way for a lot more to be changed. Not necessarily EOC as some people are stupidly saying, but the way towards QOLscape.

Ayee, you work for Roost Architechture out in Boiling Springs?

I have a few quick questions if you don‚Äôt mind answering. I‚Äôll look at the guide later but I can‚Äôt now at work. 
---
If I die will my barrows armor break? (Should I welfare gear it to learn) 
---
I heard that people with T-bow just do the range part and ignore magic as their damage is already so high. Would you recommend learning range solo then mage solo then mix them together? 
---
Thanks!
---
One really important point I've not seen mentioned before is the rewards balancing. 
---
If you look at existing popular content, there is a large correlation between how profitable a piece of content is and how much it gets played. For example, lots of people grind vorkath (one of the most boring bosses in game) whereas very few people play castle wars. 
---
For lms to have widespread popularity, it needs to have consistent, guaranteed (low) profit for everyone. If you keep the buy-in costs the game is going to peter out because there is just no desire from average 2019 players to lose money doing any activity.
---
Jagex actually wants people to play rs3 though. With all the mtx options, an rs3 player is more profitable than an oldschool player. 
---
The cost of literally doubling all of the graphics in the game in terms of paying artists to do the extra work will not outweigh the few added players. Then theres the purists who act like watching a streamer/youtuber who‚Äôs using updated graphics is the end of the world.
---
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt mind updating graphics, but it would have to be all or nothing, no toggle. And that will never pass a poll
---
have u tried killing 10,000

Wuality meme
---
Depends on the stage of the game. Getting to zulrah at an efficient per hour to trump TT is much farther down the line. Getting cosmics is pretty vital to early game zulrah as well as getting money from alching the bows you fletch. While I agree on a 1800-2000 iron it is dead content. Early game it's much faster than most methods.
---
&gt; no one minded
---
I can tell you for a fact that is utterly false.
---
I have two 50 attack builds (1 def and piety). Doesn't change the fact that the build is broken, and should be nerfed (at the least to be able to smite a 4M Gmaul).
---
Happened to me about a week ago...

Just a meme. Some people might think that an ironman being happy they got a whip/godsword devalues what they bought off the ge, but thats really rare and most people are either happy for the ironman or dont give a shit
---
Hyahyahyahya wow!
---
A new skill wouldn't address the issue at all. It would only be able to offer Gathering tasks, then Artisan tasks once you finished those Gathering tasks. While that can guide you to some skilling, it misses a lot of Skilling but it also fails to guide players to things related to Combat, which is the focus on the proposed tasks, and other content Quests.
---
why cant u kill them in molch?
---
Lol not quit new, returning, I can own that, Also never cracked past 55 rc on any account because it's just not fun. Can't blame me too much for being ignorant to some aspects of the game mainly speaking, the skill at hand. Perhaps if I had more incentive to do it I'd be more knowledgeable on rc.
---
That depends on how much you value defence xp. The main reason kodai is so good is because you can cast on defensive, but if you care more about the extra mage xp SotD is the way to go for sure (unless you wanna be lazy :p)

Don't. It uses Osbuddy's users grand exchange offers, so it gets more inaccurate every day
---
There's no point though -- you don't need RC for anything besides 60 for boot upgrades, and you'll already get that by the time you have 91 Slayer even if you just purely do Tears of Guthix.
---
There are tons of irons that chase EHP in the high-level community. Many don't, but that doesn't mean Temple Trekking is not inefficient. I definitely did zero TT when I was in the mid-game. I had more than enough essence from early-game banshee tasks and mid-game wyvern tasks to do 59-65 Runecrafting at double cosmics once I got 59 via Tears of Guthix. This is the only RC you really need to do since you'll need cosmics for Cure Me at Zulrah pre-antivenoms/serp helm, for bolt enchanments, for jewellery pre-POH box, etc.
---
Runecrafting doesn't really affect the other aspects of the mid-game so you don't need to train it to be efficient. This means that it's OK to let it fall by the wayside until you have enough essence banked from Zulrah. This is far more efficient than spending 25-30 hours at TT to bank enough pure essence for 77 Runecrafting at ZMI.
---
People will downvote because they don't like to admit that what they're doing is inefficient. Look -- you don't have to play efficiently. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't admit that what you're doing is technically not the best way.
---
nice
---
If you have cash to burn I would assume you know what you are doing already (unless you bought it)
---
What the fuck?
---
Runescape is the only jagex game to last more than a year (which, let's be honest, was more like 1 month of "what's this oh wait it's trash" popularity and 11 months of denial for the hundred person player count) and they keep thinking they know what they're doing when they don't have their hands held. 
---
That said, agility should be f2p but they should just drop the draynor req down to 1 instead of make a new course. (Gnomes are racist anyway ^small ^/s )
---
If what you're saying is true, this dev blog wouldn't exist.
---
You can go to a low traffic area (climb up a ladder in a building), and hop to a PvP world quickly to clear your inventory by putting your items in a bag. Saves a bank trip with a 5 second hop.
---
would you consider Alexander the Great of Macedonia manly and/or masculine?
---
I guess man but it‚Äôs honestly just not fun in my opinion. I‚Äôd go as far as saying clan wars is way more fun than castle wars. Hell I‚Äôd rather do rooftop agility than play clan wars. But if you really think this is the one then I‚Äôd say put more thought into the leveling system because that had always just ruined the game mode.

first off:

#NO
---
second:
---
&gt;One of the first challenges new players face is getting around the map.
---
stop right there. no. the f2p map is small as shit. theyll be ok. youre probably looking at numbers which show retards without a brain waiting for an arrow to show them where to go. they will never survive in this game no matter how many arrows you put on the screen.
---
&gt;You‚Äôll be able to freely ignore these tasks.
---
just like how you can ignore eoc except you cant. dont trust you. will never trust you again. no.
---
&gt;we can't poll these content changes, as the process would be too slow.
---
oh fuck off
---
&gt;Keeping new players engaged with the game is one of our highest priorities
---
why? you have hundreds of thousands of *old* players engaged. perhaps you think you cant lose them again? this is literally what you did last time you focused on hand holding and engaging new players while the old players quit then the new players followed and you had nothing left to do except try to get more new players
---
be thankful you have such a dedicated community after all youve done to them
---
It might be tinfoil
---
Perhaps someone did, but did you even know they changed the tutorial with mobile? Or that they added new dialog with the Lumbridge Guide?
---
nah, id just quest for a while. youll get low level craft and other skills that way much easier.
---
Thanks a lot, I'll hop in next time I play!
---
So what site do I have to use (free)
---
If you don't wana train a skill don't just remember that like saying slayer at lv 50s is a good skill to which its not ^.^, food for thought.
---
It can take a little while to find some non toxic pvpers, but once you do be sure to tell them to add you before they kill you! Because when I'm pking and I see a noob with tb and I kill him, I almost never mind if he wants to come with me after he is re-geared. That way you have someone to chat with while looking for targets, and you might learn from him!
---
Finding a friend to pk with, especially if you don't have pk-oriented combat stats, can really help you to enjoy pking more.
---
As someone whose played WoW since vanilla, your claims did not kill WoW whatsoever. Activision killed WoW by not giving a shit about the game itself and only focusing on profits. I quit WoW and came to OSRS because of the way it‚Äôs run, community focused goals where the devs care about the game and players. The only reason this game is alive today is because of the updates and changes, this is nothing like 2007 OSRS anymore, it‚Äôs an entirely different game. 
---
You claim that people still played despite running everywhere and the games fine. That doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt get better, all the changes that made the game more accessible and smooth is why OSRS is growing. The game was dying rapidly when released. Making it easy for new players to learn the ropes and travel the map is great, new players will be the only ones to use this. Giving clear direction and aid to new players is substantial help and aids player retention. A lot of new players quit cause they don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do and I don‚Äôt blame them, it‚Äôs hard. 
---
Jagex focusing on being the most popular goal is a great and tangible goal to have. They know it‚Äôs not realistic as the game is niche, but it‚Äôs something they can measure. It means that they want to focus on the community as a whole, new and old players. The updates coming to new players will only get more into the game and will serve no purpose to veterans as there‚Äôs spellbooks for instant travel. However helping retain the new players who want to join is the go to goal Jagex should focus on.
---
I don‚Äôt know how this community is so against change despite the game being an entirely different game at this point. Don‚Äôt we want new players coming in and staying? I don‚Äôt understand how people give Jagex so much hate despite them putting their heart and soul into OSRS. The sheer amount of complaining that Jagex wants to help new players is ridiculous. It‚Äôs a false mentality to have, ‚Äúwell when I played I had none of the luxuries so why should new players?‚Äù
---
There was no medicine or vaccines during the black plague, just because those people suffered through that and managed to survive doesn‚Äôt mean we need people going through that again. It‚Äôs really an old man mentality to have, ‚Äúback in my day we didn‚Äôt have cars!! We just walked everywhere!!‚Äù 
---
Ok, so what? We need change to thrive and grow.
---
That sucks man. Just don't loan shit anymore and u can keep your gear and your friends

lol keep whining you're definitely not coming across as a butthurt 13 year old

It would be both.

I don't see what problem this solves, or what it would add to the game

Dude, I‚Äôm looking to make already fast xp rates even faster, and although I have cash to burn I don‚Äôt have cash to waste as black chins didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference But I might be missing something.

 Not every player with cash buys it man, people can play the game properly other than just you.

are you suggesting im a furry? cus im taking that as an ultimate insult if so, and you've just made an enemy

---
Don't waste your breath, most of these people who play here weren't around long enough to watch as RS2 was completely ruined one fucking shit update at a time.  They will mock your slippery slope talk even though it literally already happened before.  Watching a game you truly love and that has no replacement go through the same shit again is fucking heartbreaking and they don't care at all.
---
I actually saw ponybologna yesterday/earlier today. Spoopy.     
---
Ninja Edit: Hol up. Is that you OP?
---
You said there was no context, context was provided and pointed out, and this is how you react?
---
I think it‚Äôs a good idea, as an option to be toggled rather than as a full replacement.
---
However, it‚Äôs safe to note that Jagex wasn‚Äôt actually directly responsible for the transition of RS2 into RSHD some years back. From what I understand, they sourced external development to completely retexture the game so as not to take away from the weekly content they were pumping out. Re-masking existing resources is definitely time consuming, and saving backups of both LQ and HQ textures will surely be data hogs in their own respect to ensure that the option can be toggled on or off.
---
It‚Äôs not a bad idea. I just wonder what their approach to it would be. The OSRS team has grown quite a bit, but it is still by no means a large team. I would expect them to seek external assistance again due to this fact if this becomes an increasing talking point.

I quit this game back when wildy updates were released. Now I quit again because of bots. Maybe I'll come back when they solve this.

Dude Tears of Guthix is the only way I train farming. It's like that meme, I have no idea what farming is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask. I know there are guides on YouTube but just the sense of it being a time related skill and not easy to just go do really makes me not want to do it.
---
I know that I'll need it eventually, though. I probably should just suck it up and learn.
---
all memes are boomer memes
---
That‚Äôs (if I‚Äôm not mistaken) 1/1,000,000.... damnnn gz!!!
---
The lack of direction is totally part of the appeal.
---
Runescape's activities aren't inherently fun; they don't need a line guiding you through the "theme park of fun activities!"... Because the activities aren't really fun.
---
What's ACTUALLY fun is figuring out what goals you want to set, finding out about new gear, finding out about grinds you wanna take.
---
Giving users a checklist sure gives them "something to do" but the best part of runescape is evaluating which goals are most meaningful to you, putting your bootstraps on, and grinding out the quests/ training/ money required.
---
For me, early game achievements were things like figuring out I could finish a quest and not have to pay that 10 coin fee at the Al kharid gate. To be high level enough to not get bodied by the mages south of Varrock. To be able to cut yews for money.
---

EDIT: to add to this, I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ&amp;feature=youtu.be) come up and I have to say it nails the issue right on the head. **HOW do you communicate early goals to new players?** That is a big question in a grindfest game with goals and tasks that aren't particularly appealling.
---
But it's made a lot more appealling when the world around you is booming with players you can see interacting with the world, busily walking through, bustling, for you to run up to, follow, ask questions, and TALK to.
---
**"how do u maek money"**
---
**"where can i get good sword**
---
**"where are you going"**
---
**"what do i do"**
---
... We love this stuff.
---
They should focus on making Lumbridge, for new players, very active again. Funnel new and existing players to particular "high activity" worlds for that experience. Maybe even emphasize high level players with low magic levels (who are bound to use home tele) to be defaulted to one of the high activity worlds more often so that new players can see them, witness them, interact.
---
Nice
---
Whose suggesting stop all changes? Also apex isn‚Äôt dead it just isn‚Äôt the most popular game in the world like it was for awhile and it had issues from the start that killed any chance of longevity like fortnite has.

My mofck we done did that back in the day too!! Except we didn‚Äôt use reddit but various Runescape forums online.

The fuck are you saying? If 3 ppl max 18s at the same tick, that's 54 dmg.  A person can pizza eat plus swordie to heal 23 and will have to wait 2 ticks for their next move. Presuming the tank has 77hp around (80 cb), one more volly of max hits would kill them if they don't eat in time. But even if they do, they'd be sitting at around 15hp. If they grab an eat and all three rangers hit anything above a 14, the player is dead.  Even trying to spam eat, you're most likely fucked. There's no way they're out eating that volley unless all three attackers hit 0s nonstop or the person teleports. And that's just with a team of 3 max 44 pray pures (cb 72 -80) 
---
I'm not sure how you believe eating pizzas would be efficient. Hopefully your trolling dude. Pizza is not a 1 tick food, it's closer to two. There is a delay and you're better off combining it with a swordfish. You're painting the picture of a 99hp 60 def pure. Find me one in the wild in f2p. The example I chose is a lot more applicable and realistic. Even with steel skin. The dps will eventually out hit the eats.
---
We already have one.

That would be item selling. Go onto any black market and you'll see the different sections runescape gold runescape items runescape accounts etc. Sythe.org go and have a look.
---
Yeah I agree it‚Äôs just hard for us that have been playing for years to see it from someone who has never played and has no idea the purpose of the game I had a friend I showed the game last week and he said he didn‚Äôt understand what to do I‚Äôm not even saying a tutorial island change or anything crazy maybe just a guy standing in lumby that gives you a quest that gives a better explanation on some major locations or maybe even gives a further explanation of things you can do that can be done/seen in RuneScape to give someone a sense of some of the directions they can go would that really hurt the player base in anyway?
---
That seems more like magic defense formula needs to be re-vamped than the issue stemming from dhide.
---
Make defense actually BE the source of your defense, NOT magic. 
---
As for black dhide: Eh, just looked at the stats: I suppose yeah, its melee def IS a little high: 55 range def vs 55/47/60 stab/slash/crush IS a bit much. Drop it to mith levels of defense? 
---
That said: I still don't see the issue with splashing on people in ANTI-MAGIC armor. If it's based on the magic def formula, fix that instead?
---
Youre like one of those kids in high school that tells a joke everybody knows already, but when no1 laughs, you say it again, but louder

i hate this but i love this
---
&gt; now what?
---
Explore? The layout of the map in F2P is concise enough that there will be enough new things to interest new players once they arrive in Lumbridge. There's quests right off the bat, plenty of enemies to train on, a massive desert town to the east and a major city to the north, etc. There's plenty of options for starting out as long as you make an effort to look for them.
---
There are so many bizarre ones that don't make any sense. SGS spec is area sound effect, dds is a player sound effect. The way they decide what is area effect and what is player seems like a coin flip.
---
Super easy, use a Nardah teleport scroll to get close. There‚Äôs also a bank if you have done a certain quest. 
---
Don‚Äôt go unless 35 thieve atleast, watch a video on it
---
All the RS3 losers replying in butthurt hubris lmao
---
The lower attack speed on the LBA does hamper it quite a lot (napkin math it as 4/5th stats, so 57.6 crush and 73.6 strength, and this does not factor in other gear which further spreads the disparity), making it much less accuracy and slightly lower strength, but also giving it a prayer bonus.
---
Turn off public chat.
---
gmaul nerf will hurt new players, not help. experienced pkers can do other combos, but gmaul is one of the easiest combos to learn and get kills with.
---
An emphasis on group activities friends can do I feel will do more good. There's nothing to do together with friends at mid level, outside of like... Well... I can't really think of anything.
---
OSRS shouldn't try to be a theme park game. The parts that make OSRS gold are the rough parts, the knitty gritty grinds. Challenges... "pointless" challenges. Like... Think about the real why people drink hard alcohol. "Let's make it more appealling by making it taste sweeter!" is what "making OSRS more fun" feels like to me. It doesn't appreciate OSRS.
---
It‚Äôs an mmo with quests and skills you are meant to complete and level up, there‚Äôs items to gather and bosses to kill as well. That‚Äôs every rpg ever to exist. There‚Äôs just no need for any hand holding in this game my man.
---
He hasn't been playing long enough, and doesn't understand enough about the game to absorb what you're saying. He'll think this is a personal attack, but he doesn't know what he's ignorant about, so he'll continue to speak with authority on things he doesn't know.
---
Imo no clue why they don't just change black dhide in wilderness and pvp world scenarios. They already have been separating PVM and PK with the spec bar. This seems like a much better fix. 
---
I would agree that blessed dhide stays the same, but maxed mains usually already wear it plus combined with a blessed spirit shield it's near impossible to land a freeze.
---
I hope they don't touch it.
---
its a vidya game with wizards and dragons tho.
---
what in this proposed update to you is negative?

I log out wave 61 and practice on the simulator for 10 minutes before I start the final 2 waves.

They even got an hour to get back to their bronze sword, shrimp, and runes. We only had 2 minutes to figure out how to get back to that place.

u from philly area? no one outside PA knows what im talking about when i say "jawn" lmaooo
---
You're being downvoted but what you're saying is true.
---
The typical advice of 'staying on the same vein' is technically more efficient, yes.  But the reality is that if you are AFKing at upper level, trying to 'follow the train' is going to be way less efficient for you, because you're going to have more downtime due to not immediately clicking the next vein as yours depletes.  
---
You'll constantly be switching to half-elapsed veins, and when you're AFKing that's much worse over time than clicking on fresh veins.
---
Sometimes the hivemind works against you lol
---
True, either way it'd be the superior method to search osrs wiki for a winnie the pooh meme

Yo, resting at musicians? That was super chill.

---
The problem is the of creation poll states they have to have weekly updates
---
A lot of the weird jank with osrs's Dev process is that we didn't get enough votes in the creation poll. We could have had like a 2x bigger Dev team and more support and f2p from the start but we didn't get enough votes.
---
Use range?
---
You won't stop them from moving, but you'll hit them at least.
---
In black dhide, you have some 86 magic def with just body/chaps/vambs. Throw on a black dhide shield and I REALLY don't see the issue with a mage spalshing with 105 magic bonus: you have barely more magic offense than they do magic defense.
---
Look at it from a different angle: people are fine with MAGING in MELEE ARMOR against the Barrows because they have such low magic defense it's basically fine to mage as long as you have +0 magic attack bonus. Yes, this is PvM and not PvP, but it's still flawed and goes against the inherent idea. Splashing on people in anti-magic armor DOESN'T really go against the whole thing IMO.
---
I just don't see the issue with mages failing to hit people in black dhide: It's meant to counter magical attacks.
---
TRUE
---
What do you think is better platinum tokens vs ge tracker
---
With dorics quest he means knights sword. This quest boosts your smithing to lvl 29 if i remember correctly
---
I feel like if you're the type of player who quits over that you're not the type to stick with runescape.
---
I get the frustration but I'd rather the game have that knitty gritty feel over the friendly angle- RS3 totally exemplifies this. It's super friendly, super forgiving, super boring.
---
That's basically what the whole thread is referencing.
---
We have it with vials so people want it for other stuff
---
I can see your prospective I just don‚Äôt see how someone getting alittle more information about the game hurts anyone and some people have 0 idea what the game is about think about runescape mobile if you downloaded it from the app store and the only thing you knew about it was the description you read in the App Store and tutorial island would it hurt if a npc in lumby gave you some of the information a beginner guide does ?

I did this by accident the other day. Was bursting nechs in the smaller room, had to bank, came back and saw someone in the first room, thought they crashed me, so I got salty and attacked his pile so he left.

Lol sounds like u had experience with that, or maybe currently experiencing that. Highschool wasn't that bad, you wanna talk about it big guy?

\^ This. WoW died because accessibility changes were added to late-game content, which ruined the exclusivity and commitment that content required. These changes would literally change nothing but the first few hours of the game for brand new players. It's not like they are adding a Raid finder or boosts to base 90's for $60. If you think anyone who is experienced in this game is going to take their little token to Varrock for an untradeable steel sword, you're high as hell. Just let new players have a different experience when you did and realize that nostalgia does not equal perfection.

Go to the Seers Village course, use runelite, and AFK. Runelite has these clickboxes that show you where to click for the obstacle, it makes it just a bit easier and more AFK. I train agility while watching movies or YouTube, and it goes by ridiculously quickly (I went 70-73 in a couple hours)
---
Honestly Imjumping ship to classic WoW in the a few months.. I'll be back down the line, but this sort of thing really jumps out that Jagex are trying to fly too close to the sun

OSRS isn't exactly a niche game, but it's absolutely not for everyone..
---
Left at the hands of the parent company, the developers will not make the right decisions on behalf of the community

Same btw. You can still use the price checker tool in the equipment screen to look up GE value of items.

Better yet, don't even click them.

A blow pipe with rune darts and 90 range can usually kill dawn before she gets a chance to heal.

Oh yeah, BM still exists in WoW but not to the level of OSRS. I can at least do a day of casual BGs and maybe only run into a few spammy morons (which are generally useless even to their own team since they're almost always flavor of the month rerolls or never play objective). 
---
If I tried a day of BH or deep wildy PKing or something, I'm going to get waaaay more toxicity thrown my way.
---
I played 6.0 - 8.1 and accessibility isn't what killed WoW.  Legion was highly accessible was widely regarded as a good time to play.  What's killing WoW is rng on rng on rng with a side of scuffed endgame progression.  
---
In the mass exodus during BFA, after some good days in Legion, no one quit because LFR exists or people can boost.  The core fans really don't care, because those don't affect end game PVP or PVM.  
---
WoW is dying because Blizzard keeps trying to reinvent the wheel, fucks up the wheel, finally gets the wheel right after 2 years, and then throws that wheel out and starts over.
---
Will it work tho?
---
Transport shouldn't go major city to major city, it should be trade and produce orientated. Just put NPCs in around resource spots, add a right click follow option, then eventually new players can dollow them to shops or other locations.
---
E.g.
---
Mining to furnace
---
Furnace to anvil
---
Not at all. In OSRS, maybe, and that's only because everyone here wanted PvM vs PvP. So of course people's opinions are skewed when they're getting PKed at revs by clans. Edge PKing used to be the meta and it's people who like PKing that get fucked over because it's never been a priority.

---
Always saw it as a gem, like an ornament.
---
Sweet obby cape (r) there bro.
---
The big problem with the game its that its learning curve has the same curvature as the horizon
---
Then so be it... people want polls to at least attempt to preserve the integrity of the game. If that means a skew towards high level content and no pvp or lower content, then so be it.
---
&gt;They all hit 18s, 54 damage, but u heal 27hp. Then again, now ur 54 hp down, still not dead. And this is assuming u roll a 1/19 chance 6 times in a row with 100% accuracy. Quick mafs is 1/47million, and even with that rng youve only dealt 54 damage. 81hp in 3 hits is 1/322billion.&gt;
---
Are you reading this shit? You saying a person that hits their max three times in a row is impossible? Damn then all those time is hit constant maxes were miracles. 
---
Pizza isn't one tick. There's always a delay in between eats, the fuck you talking about? And RNG is unpredictable but it happens.
---
&gt;Not to mention 99 range is enuff cmb experience for 88 hp so idk why u assume its 77.&gt;
---
We're talking about a 60def tank that's running away. It's safer to assume they're an average player with average stats and hp. 
---
&gt;And if its a team of 3... u can just pray range. You need at least 3 more people meleeing to not pray range... 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;No shit. Or you can have one of the team meleeing.&gt; 
---
&gt;Better yet. I got a 83 cmb acc with 67 def. gather 2 other blokes with 99 range, we‚Äôll go clan wars and ill run from portal to portal 3x without range prayer. I‚Äôll wager 50m. What streamer u want to use to Middleman?&gt;
---
And now you challenging me with a tank that's closer to 70def, which makes a major difference. Stay on subject.
---
60 def mid level tank with 77 to 80 hp sitting at 80cb can get destroyed by 3 max range/str 44 pray pures. 
---
Bring a 60def mid lvl account and I'll have no problem showing you.
---
&gt;And if we're going to consider the negatives can we avoid the whole "more players = more microtransactions / this is how eoc starts / this isn't rs3" arguments that have no basis whatsoever.
---
They have a lot of basis. It's very in line with the interests of the hardcore OSRS audience to not want the game to appeal to more people because it's a recurring trend in the games industry that:
---
Developers try to expand their audience  
---
-&gt; New audience is broader than old audience  
---
-&gt; Game's direction is now dictated by new audience, trying to reach an even broader audience (Insert "We want the Call of Duty audience" meme)  
---
-&gt; Original players are now disenfranchised with the state of the game and leave  
---
-&gt; New audience eventually gets bored of the game because it's like everything else so they move onto the new hot topic  
---
-&gt; Game dies
---
Make this guy CEO of jagex; let's poll this
---
To achieve this you need to do a few things. 
---
1. Own an android phone. That's priority.
---
1a. Hopefully you can download the OSRS client from the play store as I can. 
---
1b. Download OSRS client and ESTRONGS FILE EXPLORER
---
2. Put your chromebook into developer mode. A simple Google search will explain how to do this. 
---
3. Have an OTG cable that will fit your phone and or your chromebook. 
---
4. Have an SD or micro SD card and a card reader that can be used with your OTG cable 
---
Here comes the fun part.
---
5. Using estrongs file explorer make a backup of the OSRS APK. (Go to library then apps and then long press to select it. There will be an android dude that looks like there's one behind the other. That's the backup button)
---
6. Copy (or cut doesnt matter) the APK onto your chromebook (which should be in dev mode [dev mode enabling wipes your Chromebook. Please perform a backup as you will lose your information])
---
7. Once copied onto your chromebook use the file manager on the chromebook (after you insert the SD card into the device) to find the apk. Use two fingers to select the app installer (another android dude on the left side mine was at the top of the list)
---
8. Profit. 
---
Guys the only downside is that since it's not on the chromebook play store when there is an update to the RS app you must re backup the APK and update it accordingly. The chromebook will not auto update it for you. However since this is not doing anything damaging or anything that will void the warranty of your device this is the BEST option out there. 
---
Happy Skilling
---
Yeah, because y'all pussies need to grow a pair and quit spite voting PKers. You brought it upon yourself. Let's not forget about the time they polled 6 hour afk methods (basically botting at that point) and the community stated they wanted it. Polling should've been removed right there. That promise of theirs has caused enough damage to the game and I'm glad that they're finally revoking it.
---
I've said we need a 3 hour cooldown on those teleports so they cant be used excessively except for their purpose of going to the minigame.
---
Members running in f2p to escape risk while getting the benefits of the wilderness. Defeats the risk vs reward dynamic of wilderness no?
---
I‚Äôve been playing since ~2003 and decided to really dive into an iron about a month ago; unless you are following a guide, it‚Äôs like relearning the game all over again. I gave up on a mid-game character just because most of being a main is finding a good money method and grinding it to get what you want. Having way too much fun on my Ironman doing inefficient dumb stuff lol
---
Hey, I was thinking this "boss" could be in the form of a minigame with higher tiered bosses for higher levels of agility.
---
Maybe the bees would be the intro boss
---
It doesn't stand for being a creepy furry, that's for God damned sure
---
Not if he has a tm8
---
Hard to imagine green pixel in the construction skill icon crushing anything.
---
Cool ideas but the people who think the wilderness shouldn't be dangerous will get everyone at their group homes to vote no on anything remotely fun.
---
That's not how it works
---
I believe 40 to start.
---
Wow it's actually you lmao, I'm pretty sure I went by the extravagant name of Pieboy back then
---
Well no because karils is actually worth something
---
Edit: Downvotes?? Am i wrong in assuming the main reason for the dhide nerf is the price? 
---
Ktop is like 2m and the skirt 200k? 
---
Dhide is 20k lmao
---
While the teleports wouldn't show the paths, there is a world map now and most paths between cities are pretty obvious. So if you are in Lumbridge and teleport to Varrock, after opening the map you should be able to realize you were there and ended up here and see the route between them.
---
Also voting level restrictions and members required for low level f2p junk. Let them try and market the game for us. This is unused content by a super majority of the voters, if it goes badly community will kick up a fuss and they listen.
---
The game is 30% nostalgia funning, 30% streamer worship, 20% meta skilling, 20% pking and 20% bot development.
---
If you start killing the 30% the whole house of cards is pretty fragile.
---
No single update killed RS3 - it had tons of players after RWT changes. So no, a single update won't kill it. A year of them? That might.
---
And suggesting you're going to spend a lot of dev resource on something you're not willing to poll? Yeah that's not great either (regardless of what they were doing with the time).
---
You haven't stated any numbers, just your opinion. Since we're gonna play the game, I got something. The playerbase spiked and game was doing it's best when EoC came! Those were the golden ages! To get OSRS to hit the same level, let's add in EoC reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
---
On a serious note, gimme some actual numbers and logistics to be taken seriously.
---
Not bad! So you didn‚Äôt follow a specific guide you just kinda went off what you felt was best?
---
Okay so for people that don't own a chromebook (me, a noob), what's going on here? Are you not supposed to be able to get osrs on a chromebook? For what reason? And is this just a guide to installing it?
---
Have you been PKed a lot? Asking because I want that slayer helm
---
As someone who started before there was even a tutorial, it's not even that for me.
---
Here's 20 coconuts.
---
Learn how to build a real pure and maybe you won‚Äôt be so salty
---
ùìëùìªùì∏ ùìòùìº ùìñùì™ùîÇ
---
there is a right click option to check the contents
---
Revenants just create more gold. We don‚Äôt need any more clans locking down entire worlds dedicated to this.
---
Refusing to use any of the clients available resulting in ruining a fine account after 2 days of pking. Arrogant.
---
While im sure he doesnt care that much and it shouldnt bother me, it *is* a shame.
---
Fuck pvp, I only care about slayer.
---
When did I mention any other game? Im implying that pking requires skill.
---
The thought of having messages telling players what to do makes me want to throw up
---
If the player can't have natural curiosity and see the fun in the game without a guiding hand, this probably isn't their kind of game.
---
very little in comparison to the trillion other games that already exist
---
This will ruin the new player experience we need to fix this without polling it.
---
This is what I came to the comments got. Ty
---
They did not explain that part well. Like if it is a small change with massive benefit that could pass as integrity like the tweaks to the tutorial that they did around mobile, then sure. But stuff like a new travel system, F2P Agility, and Task system should be polled. It has been a while since mobile so I don't see why there is a rush.
---
That said, polling can take longer than just release a poll if you consider the process of gathering a design for a Dev Blog, revising based on feedback, polling it, and then doing it again if it failed. If they did feel there needed to be some better guidance system like a Task system that could be deemed integrity and if different versions kept failing polls that would be a problem and could eat up the time they had and run into other projects. Still, their phrasing there isn't the best.
---
Congrats! That looks nice to look at Haha, 3 years away for me
---
No not really, I guess if anything i took bits and pieces out of FatNooblets progression series on youtube.
---
Some people don't like the idea of elves using a "brutal" weapon like a flail or mace. How about a crystal sceptre? It could be like the ancient staff in the sense that it is both a good crush weapon and a decent magic staff.
---
Actually a lot of skill to the point cheat clients were created. Again, we aren't doing a comparison to other games that are irrelevant.

The way the loot shows like that, is that a setting or something?
---
Not bad man, you should do the knights sword quest. Super easy with a huge smithing XP boost. Keep up the grind!
---
If you start a new ironman account, you can see how dreadful travelling can be firsthand. Of course, ironmen have typically played the game before, so most know how to works towards teleports (ardy cloak, jewelry, fairy rings/spirit tree, etc) and have map knowledge in general. Now imagine how daunting it is trying to explain all the teleport methods and different areas of Runescape to a new player.
---
This is a bit anecdotal, but I got my girlfriend to play some osrs, and she still plays it somewhat regularly. During her first week or two of playing, she kept asking me a bunch of questions related to points of interest and getting around. Alot of those people that have trouble getting around also don't engage with the subreddit, so that's probably why you don't hear people complain about it.
---
50% required - lumbridge to cease trade with Varrock and close borders
---
Used to love this type of pking. This scene still around?
---
Except I‚Äôm not stating metrics, I‚Äôm stating facts about how they went about changing the supporting graphics and the engine edits when they transitioned to RSHD. But, since you want to act stupid, let‚Äôs break down the internet trolling ‚Äúpoints‚Äù you tried to make:
---
EoC was not a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù, it actually chipped away at an already dwindling population that was heavily impacted by the removal of the wilderness in 2007. This was evident when Jagex polled support for an ‚ÄúOldschool‚Äù version of the game (which we have today).
---
RSHD actually came before EoC, by several years.
---
The average playerbase at peak hours is 20,000 for RS3, which doesn‚Äôt even compare to the 95,000 average users OSRS sees.
---
You want to play this game? How about actually coming up with an actual argument instead of baseless nonsense.
---
It‚Äôs clear that you can‚Äôt read already though from both of your previous posts so it‚Äôs likely this falls on deaf ears anyways.
---
cheat clients don't mean anything. i can program a cheat client for a reaction time test, doesn't imply any sort of skill
---
I plan on it after I get 18 crafting for this beginner clue! Thanks for the tip tho !
---
&gt; Remove Clan Wars, Duel Arena, and NMZ Unskulling
---
This is going to be annoying when doing clues that require you to go through the abyss, and shortly after go back to the wilderness.
---
RuneLite has it on by default I believe!
---
Got me 7 water runes after grinding 20 fishing for the damn clue on my new f2p acc
---
? 
---
3 people maxing 3 times in a row is different than hitting ur max 3 times in a row. 
---
The average player in wildy isnt 60/60/60. Theyre more likely 60 99 range lol. The majority of ppl in f2p wildy have a 90 cmb stat if not 2. 
---
Chance to hit ur max 2x in a row after already maxed is only 1/360. Learn to math. Ofc that happens. But hitting 3x in a row at any given time is 1/6.8k. Then thats across 3 accs so 6.8k x 6.8k x 6.8k. 
---
I‚Äôll do it on my 42 def acc with 88hp lmao. It was 60 def for 10 ppl anyway, you cant k0 an acc with 42 def with 3 people.
---
They do, it means you have to be good at pking. Do you even pk?
---
Why is 365 specifically a busy wildy world?
---
Lumby rooftop agility and give them draynor too?
---
His series is crazy! First episode gets 99 fishing lol
---
If rl (the easiest osrs client to run) takes that long to launch then your comp probably just can‚Äôt handle the game.
---
lol
---
How would you feel about them extending the F2P area into Tarverly? Since you're suggesting letting F2P players accessing the Dark Wizard Tower?
---
He's talking about level brackets
---
The Imp Box really needs to be polled. It's pretty Bullshit that this was one of their intended purposes to call it an "integrity" change. The nods just know it won't pass a poll and are trying to weasel around it
---
Don‚Äôt worry guys. He picked a good day to ruin his pure, considering Jagex just officially announced that they don‚Äôt care about pkers at all anymore.
---
Isles is next on the quest list lol
---
fish originally came from sea 
---
ended in lake 
---
yes im right
---
Yeah we wanted something we could all do together after getting destroyed at gwd. It‚Äôs more about having fun and playing together than efficiency for us
---
Currently I'm at +1300 medium clues. And I've gotten 2 rangers, 4 wizards, 4 sandals and single pair of gilded climbing boots.
---
I feel I've already covered these points, but to reiterate: 
---
1. Because that is not the reason players are dropping out. Players are dropping out because oldschool fits a niche group of people, and that does not represent the majority of gamers. 
---
2. Yes, there is. Look at MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. In vanilla WoW, they threw you into the world and it became a success. When did players drop off? Cataclysm. This was the period where they began streamlining the experience. Games like Battle for Azeroth and RS3 have turned what was once a sandbox into a themepark, and the problem with that is that you have to keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times. 
---
3. Going to ignore the last point, you're attacking a straw-man argument.
---
First thing that comes to mind is TB being botted for that mature ale thing
---
Yep, thats what it says
---
This is literally undeniable proof MTX is coming
---
ye nigeh..  n fkn add weed to da fkn wildeness
---
2nd comment top comment: He's banned across all of his accounts. so ya wrong.
---
Give players an untradable bond as a reward for completing all f2p quests.
---
Eh I'll upvote for visibility. Either you're being honest and the mod gets booted, or we get a smackdown. Sounds like the first though and that's shitty bwana.
---
That's not true, they don't have to be realistic. Company goals aren't necessarily achievable. They exist to guide the team's effort, not to motivate.
---
My team's goal, for example, is to be the best login experience in the world. Now, do we, in a small 7 person team, have enough resources to beat titans like Google? Probably not. But I can stop at any point and think "huh, what I'm working on won't help us get closer to being the best login in the world" and just drop it on the backlog until our priorities are re-evaluated.
---
Edit: to add, your actual achievable "goals" are your backlog, the features you want or have to implement in order to further your company goal.
---
2 Things that should be integrity and non polled.
---
g maul spec change to 60% 
---
-&gt; the accessibility of a weapon that can instantly hit twice for the cost of 38k is a joke.
---
-&gt; adding a bh brought attachment that makes the maul worth money to pk while giving the 50/50 spec, maul destroyed on death leaving the attachment as a drop if not kept.
---
Removal of tb on tber death.
---
-makes a push to kill the tber to escape.
---
-you can log out to lose tb why not if tber dies.
---
-1min immunity to tb after.
---
2nd top comment by mod: he's banned across all accounts.
---
This should be higher up. In general leveling up should be more meaningful.
---
For real! some of my best memories of runescape is killing goblins to pass the gate to al Kharid and then being murdered by the scorpions in the mine.
---
I assume you mean a player moderator and not a Jagex employee, the latter surely wouldn't have flamed you. False reports from power-trippin' p-mods should be considered ban-worthy.
---
Everything is based on bosses now, sorry I hate the rooftops aswell but making bosses the meta for everything sounds quite boring which osrs already is. An agility minigame sounds funny tho, osrs needs a cool minigame like fog.
---
B gloves next?
---
A super sharp/dense crystal shard on a chain makes total sense to me. In fact, it makes the most sense. And I really love this suggestion. It‚Äôs a niche item that would really fill in a gap.
---
Here üëè comes üëè the üëè smackdown üëè
---
Hold me back bro, hold me back!
---
Buy redberries from port sarim. Maybe I am missing the sarcasm here but it requires 10 cooking, like wtf?
---
if i could upvote this 100 times i would
---
please. i want to know how much gold was sunk due i visited at his twitch, and noticed command so i did and his nightbot replied this:
---
 The client that im using is a strictly PvP client superior to all others, if you would like to purchase it for a one time payment of 175m PM me on discord Alakizam#2770
---
I used gray chins (about 300k exp an hour) until 85 ranged, and then switched to red chins until 99 (500k exp an hour, 600-650k with good rng and maximum attention). It really didnt cost me much, like for example I would buy them in 4-6k intervals for about 5m and get several ranged levels in one session, and then make it up with a couple hours of Vorkath using my new ranged levels.
---
It‚Äôs also the easiest to get killed with. I‚Äôm sure pures would rather use dds instead of getting consistently stacked out because when ur a noob ur not going to know when to spec as well as ur opponent does. At least with other specs that don‚Äôt stack 100 damage in 1-2 ticks u have a chance of surviving more.
---
My apologies, i should have been more clear on that. Ive just been super heated about this.
---
Hell yes kill the maul meta!
---
Make the dds great again!
---
i wish. They will be quite a ways down the road i think. I have only done one recipe subquest.
---
I've been playing for about a month and a half and I still don't know how the fuck to farm or construct.  At least with farming I got potatoes once.  Not sure if you're supposed to make the patch have puddles. No idea why I come back and the potatoes are dead, or why potato plants don't make potato seeds.  It was pretty much a frowntown experience.
---
Fucking stop
---
Changing Tutorial Island the first time didn't work then, and it won't work now. Its after Tutorial Island that there's problems! Specifically, that the option for help is there in the form of guides, but the problem is that they blend into the background with all the visual noise everywhere. 
---
Is there a way such that when a player is sent to that spot in Lumbridge that, the camera is zoomed in harshly and focused specifically onto the Lumbridge Guide who is near the bridge near the Church? While he is literally what he is for, its kind of hard to notice him when there's Goblins literally everywhere distracting newbies. So make it hilariously obvious that that man is there for their assistance. Again, player retention problems happens AFTER Tutorial Island. Not during.
---
Please don't do that "Imma please everyone" BS that AAA companies attempts. Also doesn't work. Or at least, not for more than 1-3 months. Look at "WoW killers" for example. They try to please everyone including the WoW players and ultimately fail all of the above and are never remembered. Getting artsy fartsy with your already decent content just pisses everyone off.
---
Imo its just that initial point when we entered Lumbridge that there were problems. Specifically that the Guides don't stick out enough. If setting the camera such that it is clearly focused on the Guide isn't possible, then make the Guides stick out with a new color pallet. A giant glowing arrow isn't necessary less we want to repeat the disastrous tutorials that attempted to replace Tutorial Island in the past where they had giant arrows, giant doted paths, all of which made you feel like a dingus given that all of it took place in a literal straight path. These are players, not embryos.
---
Just give them a little nudge towards the Guides. Especially the two(?) ones in brown shirts and kaki pants. They're so bland looking that I doubt any new player would pay any attention to them with the clusterfuck of everything going on around them. Idk, maybe color the Guides in some obnoxious neon color(s) or something. You don't need a giant arrow for someone to see something that is neon and nothing else in it's proximity is.
---
Besides the Guides not sticking out enough, thats about it. I'm rather indifferent on everything else except the Tutorial Island, and the "I want to please everyone" BS. Not helping is how it is undemocratically decided. That's how Runescape 3 happened. It tried to be like every other MMO only to be meh at that in addition to vexing (most) of the veterans of the old combat system.
---
IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT! Except the Guides blending into the background. Fix that and the new player experience should be fine. Those Guides really do have some pretty damn useful information! Its just that players are probably too distracted by literally everything else. Like the literal hoard of Goblins running around. They ain't gonna notice some baby periwinkle headass in the midst of all that! Make the Guides look important. Take the security Vampire just right of the church. He sticks out super fucking hard. Do something like that. Or hell, even just resize/change the Guide models so that they're taller than everyone else. There's so many ways that isn't "here's a literal path towards the tutorial guide, here's a giant arrow in case the bread crump trail isn't enough you idiot".
---
Im in favor of just changing the Guide's colors so they stick out way more. I don't care if they look like unicorn vomit. Just make them noticeable without pointing them out like players are idiots. People can be dumb, but we could at least see when something looks interesting. A giant arrow doesn't make a NPC look interesting. It makes it so that the player feels like they're being herded like sheep. Kind of kills the whole gimmick of Old School Runescape being THE MMO that gives you a shit load of autonomy.
---
PS: Please put that shit to a pole. Not doing that just makes it look like that you want to force changes that YOU KNOW the community WOULDN'T want! Thats what dictators do. Defeats the point of the voting system if you just force it down everyone's throats regardless of their vote.
---
PSS: I have very little faith that any of this will end well. In before we reroll all are characters again because of "Old School Runescape Classic" since this one will become unrecognizable and become Runescape 2.5 and become hated among Runescape Old School players and RS3 players alike. Shame. The moment a company comes out and says in their actions, "you have no say in this, we're going through with very questionable decisions, so fuck off", that is a giant red slope of downward spirals right there!
---
PSSS: The reason Tutorial Island works so well is that the guides there, are very clearly represented as such. There's nobody else near them but themselves, so again, make the guides in Lumbridge more obvious like in Tutorial Island. Though considering the EOC fiasco, and the sloppily done tutorial remake that happened near that time, I have little hope that any of this will make it through. After all, Jagex ISN'T putting it to a vote because they know they would be assblasted by the community. Dictators can't have that now can they? Loot boxes not put to a poll incoming lads.
---
Looks like a massive dick
---
it already has been. ahk is not legal to use. you will be banned if you are detected to use it.
---
Please don't fucking add lode-stones.
---
"Our aim to be the most popular MMORPG in the world, and to achieve that we need to grow"
---
Oh god. You guys don't remember the last time you guys introduced a fundamental change to the game in the hopes of attracting a new audience?
---
wtf, I've been playing since 2006 and had no idea this existed...
---
Osrs will never become most popular mmrpg if theres no HD graphics. At least same as in 2007/8.. Kids nowdays wont play game with graphics from 2003
---
I dont think that the 60% gmaul would help... What about 50 attack pures? its unfair and would cost individual players a lot of money to use, whereas clans would easily be able to get it
---
Imagine being a moron. I dont care if you roleplay or are a furry, but you cannot expect the average player in an mmo to be into that shit. 
---
Given the sub, you're either autistic or a troll, I havent decided yet. Bet either way you're an idiot
---
Let‚Äôs replace that with the ‚Äò77 oscars in which Rocky won over Taxi Driver
---
I guess I should clarify and say that running to Varrock and Falador and Yanille are pretty terrible especially for early game players. I like unlocking teleports in books and seeing the teleport tabs are good gp.
---
smh that's practically cheating
---
There are plenty of different worlds for people to spread out but how is an active player base bad?
---
Full rune str pots and some food and go afk sand crawlers and zombies in the 2nd level of the stronghold.  You can afk there not get hit to hard and get those combat stats up to.
---
The mental image of a guy with a fire cape and bandos gear cowering behind a guide while the caravan passes by dark wizards is hilarious though
---
Yeah you just suicide irl
---
