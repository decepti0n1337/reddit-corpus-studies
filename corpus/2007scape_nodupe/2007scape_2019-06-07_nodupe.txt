Well...besides the cost of keeping your body alive and healthy and having to maintain your shelter.

Hard truths cut both ways

Only problem with this is that sometimes it'll make you run all the way to the F dock. But honestly still better than any other method for mobile.
---
Shiet right actually. I’ve been goofed by pictures that look like him but they’re wearing a fury.
---
There's an NPC in East Ardougne you can talk to to insure your pet for 500k. That way, if you die, you can talk to her and claim it for 1m. Otherwise, if you die, it's gone, and you have to try to get it again, which can be very, very hard.
---
the 'only' solution.. lol
---
Simple change, just make it so you can't bank a stack, only 1 item at a time, leave the rest the same.
---
In my eyes, the only thing Jagex half-asses is their esports, most companies hire professionals to set them up, Jagex does it themselves and clearly its caused nothing but problems for them. Aside from that, everything they release seem pretty finished, especially mobile.
---
I've also had that once, did my task in catacombs tho. I also got 3 whips on that same task lol
---
:/ I may have spoke to soon.. it was fine earlier but now its partially back. Had some trouble dodging vork's fireball attack because of a little lag
---
What's a goal you've always wanted to accomplish but never did back in the day? I would try and aim for that.
---

---
I've always wanted to make the Quest List all green and now I'm only half an hour away from getting Quest Cape.
---
this is just pathetic
---
The sample size matters exactly zero in how likely a poll is to fail because you need 25% of valid votes to say no regarless of how many votes there are. What matters is what proportion of the voters are against it, and limiting the voters to the group interested in the update only skews the poll toward an extreme because there are less people voting randomly or without knowledge. So if it's a good idea/update, it's likely to pass with a higher passing percentage, and if it's not, it's likely to fail with a lower one.
---
&gt;Denying the polling has not progressively become less important (it’s still obviously heavily used, but there’s clearly been some changes) is nonsense though.
---
Care to talk more about this when there has been only one situation in which they said they wouldn't poll stuff? I honestly have no clue what you mean
---
If u need 500k I got u
---
Thats The Rhino
---
Concidering the game is cpu based and only runs on once core, I suspect some players with beastly pcs still have issues running the game.
---
Gotcha. I need to somehow get 500k first. I'll put it in my bank for a while. Thank you so much!!
---
Dude just offered to give you the money bro
---
we don't need an event to promote dudes sticking shit in each other's anuses
---
&gt;i mean... its bad enough i have to watch a youtube and read a guide to complete a quest.
---
Just enjoy quests man, runescape has some of the best quests of any mmo out there
---
I do wonder what's causing them. I don't think the issue is just the fact that there are less mods.
---
you wan't a rope and chair? I have an extra set
---
Doing my first elite clue, my next step is to make nature runes, I'm 6 levels away on runecrafting and it's pretty aids already
---
Yolo Doritos is legit, made me a dad a while back.

&gt;he’s being dead ass
---
English please???
---
Wooooosh
---
Huh, I agree lol
---
Couldn't you say the same about everything that gets voted no to because it would make the get harder?
---
Ahhh awesome. I understand that we can’t have everything right away so it’s good to hear they’re still thinking about it. Player count still hovering around 100k?
---
I meant like literally throwing the darts. As Femto said you're way better off chinning over using blowpipe, it's literally gonna be four times the xp rate for like the same cost.
---
RuneScape being an esport is laughable. I'd half-ass it too if I were them.
---
I see... this will help my 44 rcing very much :P
---
D2H isn't great for NMZ because it's buggy in general, especially against enemies who aren't 1x1 in size. Granite Maul or DDS are better options, and DClaws are the best if you have money
---
Konar assigns abyssal demon tasks in the Abyss. With this update welfare gear is no longer necessary.
---
Shit mb. It's like 15 year old quest tho :(

Like saying the plague is you know what or something right?

What is the point of skilling WC/Mining/Fishing if not to make money?

Grossgore got banned for something outside of the game (and rightfully so)

Nice 1 RC pure.

BIS: Best in Slot. Generally used for the best possible item you could wear in that genre. Like the Twisted Bow being the BIS ranged weapon, because it's the best ranged weapon in the game.
---
Therefore non-BIS: whatever isn't the best for that genre/category of item.
---
Seconding this advice. While konar is theoretically the best for every milestone, you get enough bad tasks with her that the extra points over Duradel are negated and overall you gain less points over time than versus Dura. Only worth doing for increments of 50.
---
It would be super helpful if you gave what current gear or skills you have, but want to upgrade so people can give a more informed decision! Could be just your melee setup, or a few skills you're interested in, or all your armor and weapons. That'll help us help you the most :)

How do birdhouse runs translate into XP per hour? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I just tried doing them, and after 50 minutes I went and collected them and didn't gain nearly the amount of XP I expected. Since I'm waiting 50 minutes for them to fill up, isn't that effectively only a few thousand XP per hour?
---
How does that turn into 50k experience per hour or even in the later tiers 80k experience per hour?
---
This guy scapes
---
These people are forgetting to tell you that runescape was completely rebooted and everyone had to restart circa 2015. Everyone had to make new characters, thus someone might have grabbed your character. If you remember your old log in information though, you might be able to log in to your runescape 3 account which will have your old character and stats
---
ohh makes sense now, thanks for the reply!
---
And with only a couple hundred hours of effort, I can begin competing against bots in mass!
---
Yeah, I'm glad he explained the xp rates below. You're both very kind. I'll throw the darts and/or knives.
---
The time waiting for them to 'fill up' doesn't really count to most people. You can go train another skill or do something else while they collect.
---
Also it's four.
---
All varieties of time-gated xp drops such as birdhouses and farm runs are calculated for the duration of the farm/birdhouse run, not the actual grow time.
---
Since you're not literally planting your ass there for 50 minutes the effective xp rate is not that.
---
He brought them just forgot to epuip, rip.
---
Got my first ToB kc, first time ever doing verzik (with a mentor) tanked p3 and didn't die :D pretty happy with myself

u/title2imagebot
---
@HiddenGhost1234 who hurt you?
---
It might go without saying, but to add - some items are bis for specific situations even if they aren’t the strongest overall item in that category. Void range gear, for example, is bis for ranging vorkath even though in many other range situations other gear is better.
---
Classic Jagex. Make imp boxes dead content because 0.0001% of players were "abusing" them in riskfights. 10/10 company.
---
I mean they have ancient tomes and scrolls just lying around
---
Did you check all your drivers? Specifically your graphics card?
---
Well you unnecessarily brought this topic up even though it wasn't mentioned, my guess is that you're a bit of a wank.
---
Msg the guy above. If he doesn't give it post back here.

Oh, wow! Thanks for the info, friend. I’ll check it out!

Sounds more like an insecurity
---
So I don’t belong in any cc?

There are easy ways you can block piety without pvp. Nobody else is getting piety.  Not to mention that in multi the clans with piety cleared the clans that didnt have piety in the first place, so there's realistically only a couple people who might have a fighting chance if they were to get piety.
---
Alch yourself

The real irony that no one talks about.

Slightly related: Going through the mushroom place makes the game drop to one frame per 20 seconds when I have Runelite's GPU mode turned on unless I zoom WAY in. Anyone else have this issue?

My GPU is an AMD R9 380 in case it matters.

imo a better update would to be bring the rune pouch inline with the looting bag. the current price and method of getting it is ridiculous and locks people out of pking content.

these bots are the most condescending patronizing things on this site

When you place all your worth in a total level, on a game, you’re too far gone. You keep playing the way you like sir.

Whats a better afk fishing method, infernal eels or anglerfish or something else. Also what are the pros and cons of these methods.
---
Some people just hate skilling or would rather do PVM or PVP than train.
---
No, it isn’t. You get AP from playing the game. Everything gives you ap. Literally everything. 
---
Again, stop being hyperbolic.
---
Unless there is a combat bracelet involved.
---
I can only wonder the reason he called you that. You just minding your you business and such. Weird.

Lol, you’re correct

When did the original runescape (as in not oldschool) officially become rs3? Was it when eoc was released?

Go to the wiki and find the section about farming trees.  Thats your best bet.  It should only take you like 2-3 tree runs I think(maybe more idk) to get to 30.  Buy oak saplings, buy whatever protection you need for them(noted) then the tree patches are behind lumby caste, varrock castle(east side), NE of Fally(taverley), and gnome stronghold if you have it.  
---
It takes like 2.5 hrs to grow and I think this is the best way tbh.
---
boy oh boy should we tell him fellas? keep playing bruz hope you find a fun clan that can steer you towards high lvl content
---
do bird house runs (watch alkans video and set them up while he does it himself) and herb runs. you'll make a lot of money and passively level those 2 skills to 70+ very easily while you train your other skills to 60+
---
Does this have any actual purpose other than making Zenytes cheap? What could this possibly add to the game?
---
You should get some 99 cbs. Maybe vorkath for 99 range. Still ~50k/hr at your lvl
---
Yeah I've heard this and plan too, once I finish my Zulrah gear for now as I understand the next best thing is Castle wars(or is it clan I keep mixing them up) teleport with a white portal. That's been my main banking/recovering method atm.
---
I use a VPN

That "Homm88" guy who you've listened to below is talking out of his arse and knows nothing more about the Falador Massacre than the next guy.

Whether or not the youtube video you linked is Durial321 is still unconfirmed. You didn't need to edit your post.
---
Here's a fun fact: It was 07/06/06 in England when the Falador Massacre happened.
---
Where are you getting your rate of 75k/hr
---
Not to mention the gilded g-string that he’s wearing outside his armour like an absolute champion.
---
I'd still be risking the ether in the weapons though, my gear isn't worth 0 gp you know...

There's something a bit charming about there existing some strange POH cabal with its own set of grievances and rivalries. Like a virtual home-owners association.

Require the accounts to be a bond buying or paying member for at least a full month. Atleast jagex will rake in the money first before the bots are active.

It's not that bad at all. The worst part is sneaking to the back of the mansion, after that it's ez.
---
The amount of scales you get from sacred eels is also based on your cooking lvl. I’m not sure if infernal eels has an equivalent.
---
Wya im mobile boutta pull up lv 104
---
You have no idea what the rates are, though. The bot could advertise itself as 55% in favor of the house, but actually run using odds of 75% to the house (or worse). No one is going to sit at the GE collecting data from people using the bot, so all they really need to do is ensure a payout happens every so often to convince people like you the odds are some semblance of fair.
---
&gt;noobs who don’t know what they’re doing, 
---
have you tried not teaming with noobs?
---
you can tell if your team is full of apes by round 2. just reset if they suck. team only with high combat level players (likely going for pet/rank5s) or low levels in ba gear.

Holy smokes. Butcher.  13 years ago I recorded a RuneScape wedding that you played the minister in.  My RSN was Conf0rmity. Pretty sure the video is on YouTube somewhere.   I think it may have even been in your player owned house?  It was a player mod to a lady... she later became a player mod..This is a blast from the past. Cool to see you’re still around.
---
Shh!
---
you mean a grappling hook ;)?
---
Warbands was trash imbalanced lazy content. I would support something deep wilderness but not everything being clanman mode and you mentioned reworked rewards which would be essential to not devalue skilling. Realistically if jagex wants to fix pking they need to stop throwing incentives in the wilderness and instead fix the tick manipulation that are now features and allow people to eat 80 hp in 1 bite while also speccing you
---
Attack style maybe? Check for what Corp is weakest against.
---
Nice meme, dude!
---
For specific reasons i am not able to do that.
---
If u still die at that kc u dont deserve it
---
Dude fr why is this happening lol have literally all of us gotten social anxiety over the last 10 years
---
I explained how they can solve the issue in another thread, last week. Essentially, if you make it so you can't sell emblems in the GE, make the shop have only untradables (nothing worth actual value) then there would be no point in farming it. 
---
They'd have to spend their time selling emblems via trade which can get them banned before they can sell the whole lot. If they mule it, Jagex can just track them down. 
---
I just think making emblems purely untradable and having some sort of system to get points (like wildy slayer for bh points), would do the trick well. 
---
They already are planning on reworking the BH store, so maybe we'll see an implementation like this.
---
I think you have to turn it on somewhere. Or it’s ‘value’ is based on high alch and your valuable drop warning has to be lower than that. I can’t remember exactly how you set it up
---
God damnit I remember that episode. Bro legit thought his art collection was his retirement and the expert comes in saying auctions wouldn’t even put out 99% of the fake knock off shit he had LOL
---
Buy 10000 crystal seeds with it, to lose it after the update.
---
No idea. However it seems to be just an old Pepe meme of Pepe sitting infront a computer screen, meant to be a visual aid representing Settled's fans waiting for the next Swampletics episode.
---
I don't know how long it's been a thing on this sub, but it was a thing on the RS3 sub like two years ago. Pretty sure the meme originated with people wanting the party room to be moved to the GE, and then the meme just spiraled from there to "let's move X thing to the GE" and now it's "let's move the GE to X"
---
Makes it harder for me to alch sherlock master clues smh.

I currently have a bank of about 650m and was wondering if i should liquidate some to buy a DHCB since i was planning on farming Vorkath and dragon slayer tasks. I have a ACB and was thinking of selling it. Any suggestions are welcome.
---
this but the thug is replaced by flax
---
Because there is no downside of teleblock being released to f2p. Both previous polls failed marginally. People voted against with no real reason, maybe just to piss off free players.
---
I get it. Bots are annoying as hell, however it's your friends fault that he went and bought the gold. He's probably ruined the game for himself tbh.
---
Talk to oziach

If you’re wanting to quit I’ll take your stuff

OSRS isn't dying. Are the numbers inflated due to bots? Yes. However that does not mean the game itself is dying.
---
wonder what kind of treasure he got
---
If my partner made me an ultimatum between her or video games then I would choose video games 100% of the time. Not because video games are that important, but because she made me choose. That is not a healthy way to start a relationship.

99 cooking was easiest by far. 99 fletch and 99 wintertodt feel a lot more pain staking imo even though they’re quick. Maybe just me though

Arbitrary requirements are only Band-Aids. Sure it'll cut those bots down for a week maybe until they set up a flow of 700 total level accounts and just keep at it.

No, it is because i was too lazy to login on reddit on that computer.

??? Even if the only questline he did was Desert Treasure for Ancients, he would have 662 total, add in Mith Gloves and Animal Magnetism and he's well over 700. No way he's 500 unless he actually has 0 QP which means he'd get wrecked by every other account his level.

Should have spent money and done blast furnace making gold bars you’d of been 88 in like 10 hours the clue could have had good loot that would of more than covered the cost of the grind

Your suggestion will kill any low level combat pures, including defense pures and ironically stamp out many of the interesting pure builds that content creators have created.

Your right I’ll stop talkin shit. Most are nice, I was salty since I got a maxed pure (and main) and pvp updates failed all the time. Gonna move on from that though since last changes passed

I dont remember the account build but i think it was like 500 ish
---
Oh awesome.
---
Sound like some good goals. 
---
One question, what do the diary achievements do? 
---
I'm rs3 they unlock a few things, like gear which provides teleports etc.
---
Just get some cooking firemaking and fletching levels. It takes like 2-3 hours while building that account probably took 100+ hours already

Who cut the holes in your mask? You should go get a refund. :(
---
Can you make it so that the undead combat dummy in POH also shows max hit in for the dragonsbane weapons, such as dragon hunter lance, and dragon hunter crossbow? Maybe by adding something like a vorkath head to it.
---
There's always room for improvement. Straight up saying that we shouldnt even try since they will find ways around it gives them an easy win
---
Ok well him being too lazy to get 20 firemaking and turning in ore to Doric shouldn’t be the reason this doesn’t happen
---
Add 500 total level requirement to login. Stop the problem at the source!
---
Oh don't worry, I know what you're doing. And no, it isn't going "really really well".
---
You're trying to get Fist of Guthix into OSRS by making threads about it every day. Often reposting them several hours later because you didn't get the support you wanted.
---
Bot owners would probably just hire venezuelans to train new accounts in mass to the total required level.
---
DHCB is a huge improvement over BP if you plan on farming Vorkath imo. Would definitely recommend it.
---
It’s ending in like 10 days so we will see if you’re right
---
Also you could try Shayzien T1 armor and see how well it fits
---
You realize this would be to get emblems right? People can still go into the wild and attack players

Lol loved this. I wonder how many of the people bitching in this thread have F2P pked in the last few years when they said no to the polls.
---
Poor pkers can't fletch for 25 minutes :/
---
Have you literally ever dealt damage to another player in this game. It's entirely different than it was back in the day, and I only dipped my toes on f2p pking back in 07+.  
---
PKing was in its prime when nobody knew what the hell they were doing.
---
Letterkenny is a great show. I live not too far from where they film it.
---
What was the update that made this happen?
---
Idk how the wilderness in F2P looks now but so many times snipe clans would try and crash/pick off players from big fights and if you went to attack them they would instantly tele, also plenty of defence accounts that would just tank for 2 min then tele if they got low heath or out of food 
---
Most big clan fights people don’t bring teles to begin with because you need all the space you can get for food/pots and it’s faster to just die and regear into a fight then to tele out and bank, so doesn’t really effect that 
---
Probably other things it will be useful for but I only clan so I wouldn’t know
---

So keep going all I'm till you lose no?
---
Since when are they drinkable?
---
I logged into my old account a while ago and saw one of my favorite people from a clan chat I was in back in the day.
---
I messaged him, but he forgot who I was. I tried ringing some bells but they were all vague for him(and me mostly) so it was in vain.
---
On the bright side, he remembered the chat and I found a couple more people from then because of that.
---
If they even realized
---
Apart from one of the most important special attacks for end game pvm?
---
he probably didnt even notice if he just did collect all
---
It's very unfortunate when 99 parties became rare. But there is a reason for that, and the truth isn't appealing:
---
Players nowadays cares more about THEIR succession rather than OTHERS'. Because of this, people doesn't strive for friendships - they already spends dozens of hours in a week for grinding, so at what point they have time for friends? These grinders doesn't usually care about friends because their personal achievements goes over them.
---
And those players who are social and have plenty of friends aren't grinding their skills even nearly as fast as these true gamers. That leads to the point where social players reaches to 99s WAY slower than the gamers, making legit parties rare sight on these days.
---
True gamers just finds parties exp waste and/or they don't have (any) friends to invite for them. That's my conclusion why 99 parties are nowadays so rare sight.
---
I miss those times when RuneScape community was more collective than individual.....
---
Yeh new accounts can get a free week of membership 
---
Its how i did the tzhaar fight pit karamja task because im lonely:(
---
When you can't earn shit yourself and bought bonds to trade for a blowpipe so you shit on Ironmen.
---
Bro 750 total level takes like.. 2 days lmao
---
Would be good, alternatively combine it with either account age or play time
---
Just join a clan chat.
---
One without req’s would be “07 Altar”. 
---
While it looks like a cc to use gilded altars there are usually tons of regulars in there. I pop in different CC’s all the time, bunches of friends. This game is a lot more fun with clan chat!
---
What's currently  a good item to profit from high alch as a ftp? (Including cost of buying nature runes.)
---
Did you even read my comment? Please go ahead and do so again.
---
My point was, and still is, if it takes 2 days, does it ever stop a bot? Of course not. I literally wrote that in the comment you replied to.
---
Yes, I’m speaking about the new pkers with 50 attack 60 strength. 
---
Im not saying it would be a bad update though
---
Teleblock for F2P while PVP.
---
Some guys said that Mage outfits, runes and spell-related items would increase in price!
---
The total level requirement would clearly be effective. Adding this a 500 total requirement, and a simple easy wilderness diary requirement would deter the bot farms and cut profits significantly, while not being much of a hassle for the average person. People will still be able to pk and risk in bounty hunter so it wouldn't disrupt the people who dont want to do much but pk.
---
Nice, that must've taken quite a while too since they have a buy limit of 4.
---
I'm all for the purge g.e standing communities. Fuck em I say!
---
Just post it on Reddit like 24 hours in advance. People will show up. My 99 Agility party had quite a couple of people.
---
I too grinded out the level, spent 3m on smouldering stone, lost my hydra pet while afking wintertodt. Received about 150k worth of loot 3/10 wouldn’t recommend
---
Maybe not 2, but not more than 3 hours. Just buy supplies for 50 firemaking and 50 construction, use the said supplies and done, 300 total and account hasn't been ruined at any level.
---
Then just do druidic ritual and buy herb supplies until 40 and the same with crafting, already closing to 400 total.
---
That's pretty much 3,5 hours of work or less and none of your combat levels have been affected.
---
These Settled memes are growing tiresome.
---
This was indeed the case! I restarted the app and tried again, and this time I could see and pick up the ring on the ground!
---
It must have had graphical issues (or too bright outside lol) to not see the ring previously!
---
Pretty wierd that wieldable items have drop as a default action when click to drop is activated on mobile. On desktop this is definately not the case!
---
anti depressants bruh.
---
Jesus those poor Venezuelans :(
---
Yea I just unlocked them and it’s a lot better than I expected. More clicks than some fishing but the spot never moves and I can catch like 500-600 in an hour just using the fairy rings. I think the Wiki not listing it as a fishing money maker they me off on how good it could be.
---
Yeah if you want to look at how black dhide should be balanced look at how it functions on dmm(mainly tourny). 
---
1)takes awhile for people to even get the crafting level for it.
---
2)full set will cost you anywhere from ~50-100k. And this isn't 07gp where you can make 100k in 1 minute at zulrah, were talking about dmmgp which is 50x harder to make compared to on 07. So that 50-100k dmm translates to roughly 1-2m 07. Am I saying dhide should cost mils? Obv not but you get the idea.
---
Bots would skill the stats in no time. Low lvl pking would die
---
I think 300 would be a fair number. thats about where you would be if you were 50 atk/str with mith gloves. But another 200 really isnt much to get either. I think it's a great idea overall.
---
bot reviews are outsourced to india so costs are probably low anyway
---
I know it might be new to the people of your kind, but there are 23 skills total, only 7 being combat related. getting 500 total is very easy and possible without hard grinding .
---
This is true, I’m married now and I’m slowly replacing the wedding photos around our house with screenshots of my 99 rc party.
---
Still don't understand why jagex only gives this to content creators.
---
Maybe a quest point requirement would also work. Maybe a combination of both
---
You should change your registered email when you receive any phishing links.
---
You should change your registered email if you receive phishing links.
---
LMAOOOO
---
I just use the one fairy ring by the fishing spot(DKP) and then bank in Zanaris. Might be slower than other teleports but free and still pretty fast.
---
750 total isn't much effort to get for anyone that's not a bot. 500 can be gotten in a day even, without much trouble.
---
Isn't overheads 2 levels for 2 max hits and levels still matter but less at it's a big range you can fight
---
Ah, yes of course! Never had to report anything, but that is obvious now that you said it!
---
The problem was most likely a graphical issue at my end. Weird part was that wieldable items have drop as a default action on mobile. Repeated once more after resering the app and this time I could see and pick up the ring!
---
You should swap your rs3 gold! Phats!? Those are like over 5b (rs3) now. Think blue is 12b+. You can easily get over 800m osrs out of just the phat, and you must have lots of other things.
---
If you don't want to, I understand, I held on to my rs3 bank for too god damn long. But if you aren't going to play it, may as well before the gold's value just drops more and more.
---
If you want some swapping clan reccomendations, message me, I don't want it to seem like I'm just trying to shill for a swap clan/potential scam (they are trust trades after all, but many of them have been around for years and very reputable. You can do multiple trades in increments if you prefer)
---
A big streamer is one of the main advertisers for the game. Jagex obviously doesn't want a sex offender representing them
---
This would make me so happy. Would love to hear the cries of a million guys who can't fathom how they will ever complete the quest since they can't accomplish the most basic of boss fights.
---
idk why people haven't realized this, they all blame twitch prime rofl. I've gotten free membership on 1 account since they made this change, it's once per appstore/google account, not once per osrs account. With an emulator is super easy to get unlimited free mem.
---
Maybe it will hurt someone starting up, but for an established bottler they will have enough to rwt for the membership then after make profit still.
---
It will hurt people with bad bots that are easily detected for sure though.
---
1/16m = 6.25e-8 = 6.25e-6% no?
---
Congrats, I should be getting mine later today!
---
No thanks. I only play this game for pvp and only have about half an hour a day to play, if even at all. This is much too high of a restriction.
---
I have never gotten a 99 but i want to get one some day
---
Imagine being low level just train lmao
---
it wont take anywhere near a week for a bot to hit 500 total, and if the emblem farmers are being banned each day as they say they are already, they literally WONT be losing time off their week, since they were only utilizing a day anyway.
---
Rich is a big nub though 3:)
---
LMAO my first thought... prob suggested by someone who's probably never pked a day in their life
---
I know. Proper living in edgeville him
---
Pvm gating in a quest to keep out the losers from the new city. Yes please jagex!
---
Who?
---
iF iTS UniNTeNdEd iT MuSt bE FiXeD
---
I hate this way of thinking. b-hopping in csgo, bandit tricking in r6s are some examples of unintended mechanics.
---
Aka not doing Rc
---
What? I thought they looked different already
---
I’ve never even gotten a pet. FeelsBadMan.
---
Crafting itself takes an infinity!
---
I've always found their support decent, albeit sometimes slow, but always helpful.
---
LGBTQHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
---
Just to tears of guthix and xp lamps to 77 and bloods ez
---
Fucking did the same thing after grinding for days to complete the 5th step ._. I actually took a week break after because I was so pissed
---
pretty sure you can cancel before the free month is up and you wont be charged
---
780kc, 3 serps and a pet... i’ll give you 5 fire runes and a nature, you’ll know what to do with them...
---
Gratz though
---
How do you think I got to 63
---
Whats that duck on the bottom right?
---
alright
---
How about 2k total 🤔🤔🤔
---
/s
---
466 kc and three pets. Wtf...
---
This movie was not that sad. Someone is exaggerating. I would even say its a happy ending.
---
What they really should do is make it so you cant get emblems if you have the 7 day free trial membership because thats what a majority of these bot farms are abusing to get membership.
---
Whell atleast you are 14 years older. I think thats what makes it most cases.
---
Stop being so negative, man. Who hurt you?
---
Thanks for the tip. Im going for the ranged cape atm but i would also like to get it trimmed ;)
---
170m based on a bit of math
---
Just chat on your main?
---
It also devaluates the income for working at Jagex if we take action against the ones paying the bribes.
---
No ty.
---
Highest comment on every other thread. Currently sitting at -5... no, wait... -6 in this one. 
---
Fuckin way she goes.
---
Christ people on this sub are fucking dumb.
---
remove non-bis servers, it's time
---
Why can't we just make emblems completely untradeable for 49-72 hours or even better completely unobtainable when using a trial membership.
---
If these bots really do get banned within 48 hours this should hurt them. If a trial member wants to PK they still can just fine, this only changes emblems.
---
Over 10 months on and off
---
I managed to recover an old account earlier with pretty slim information as well. From my perspective the support works as intended. Obviously this one was my fault not securing properly but the speed and effectiveness of support really surprised me
---
What about G Maul nerf? They released PvP update and where are the gear changes except for nonskulling, which can be bought in PoH?
---
If you want to compete on a BH world, the barrier to entry IS ridiculously high. At lower levels, you run into Obby Maul pures that took who knows how long to get their 80+ strength with only 1 attack. Then as you go up, you run into 1 prayer gmaul pures, tribrids after that, etc.
---
It's no small task trying to be able to enjoy the PvP side of this game. It would seriously negatively impact that portion of the community if they were forced to skill up accounts on top of questing and training.
---
Yeah, probably right. Maybe I was just time wasting and less patient.
---
50m now. Just got it like 3 days ago haha
---
Mad respect for that dedication
---
Oo same im at 82 atm
---
People realising how much of a grind it is after mobile release
---
People are doing zuk and partial infernos on mobile, a fire cape can absolutely be done. First time? Would be harder ofc but I bet yeah.
---
This is a good idea, and very reasonable - which means it will be swept under the rug and left because Jagex don't like good ideas...
---
This makes me want to throw up lol
---
Just shut down the game, bot problem solved
---
Sometimes I dream of pet hunting, and then I see posts like this. 18.5k for Herbi? Holy fuck.
---
Grats on the pets! Super jealous of your collection.
---
There's bots that do Vorkath.
---
Pretty sure it would be more than easy enough for bots to get a couple rc, wc and fm levels to get onto the worlds.
---
The final challenge
---
Or simply an ingame bot detection trial, something ingame that you cannot bot, so they cant create multiple bots rapidly since it requires real human interraction.
---
Hero*
---
Christ this sub is full of fucking dumb people.
---
Here we go again... it's pretty sad how common this "don't bother because they'll make more lol" attitude is.
---
&gt;What do people expect jagex to do?
---
Having more than 1 (one, count 'em) person on their staff to deal with literally *hundreds of thousands* of bots would be a good start. No disrespect to Weath; he's doing his best, but he can't do everything alone. They can also get rid of that free 7-day mobile promotion that creates so many P2P bots.
---

Congrats! Song of the elves is coming soon so be ready 👀

If you pressed a piece a paper to her face, you’d have a nice rorschach test

---
Man wasnt gonna do Goblin diplomacy irl after doing it on RS.
---
You probably can, but would most likely be empty for 90% of the day.
---
some people genuinely enjoy that style of low level pking, and once you get a couple levels from pking and are not longer in that bracket, they just make another account. so it would be annoying to repeatedly skill for a couple hours of low level pking fun.
---
it wasnt a very big community and i don't think game integrity should accommodate situations like that, but just a bit of food for thought
---
It’s most likely due to yourself being more mature/smarter. 
---
The only feat that i remember during 2-3 years of playing back in rs2 was achieving 99 strength and now in osrs that is basically a couple weeks of DH nmz.
---
Ps: One more thing is i don’t know how the fuck am i so poor back then when i have a decent sized bank by just playing the game now.
---
It sounds to me like more than anything, you want a reason to be alarmed.
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
Or you could add those drops to the ignore list?
---
396 kc :)
---
300kc. not 2k
---
A very small minority of bots are bossing bots and most of those get banned before ever making it to Vorkath/Zul'rah. Additionally, many of those are manually trained before being automated for the bossing.
---
The point being that it would drastically reduce the effectiveness of most bots without being a real inconvenience to players.
---
How about the ones who use their low level alt to pretend like they were scammed by their main, so people will give the goods to the scammer or of pity
---
Or get good and dont misclick lmfao do we really need to isolate every npc away from a clickable object because you brainlets have fat fingers
---
TIL bots are efficient enough to get over 100m experience in Strength, Mining, Thieving, Smithing, etc. in less than 48 hours.
---
PS: Get rid of the goddamn 7 day promotion.
---
Most F2P pkers, are not F2P players.  
---
F2P pking is a quite a bit of fun with a lot less risk. Max f2p gear is 200k at most so members do come over to enjoy it.   
---
Also with splashing, getting 85 mage is kind of the same in F2P as P2P
---
The Forthos Dungeon
---
07 June 2019
---
  
---
**Forthos Dungeon**  
---
To build upon the recent Hosidius rework and increase the richness of the continent, Mod West included a Hosidius Dungeon in his original Hosidius Rework blog. Since then, Mod Husky has worked on the design. Now called the Forthos Dungeon, it is almost ready to be polled. Here is that design - let us know what you think! As usual, we will adjust the content and poll questions based on your feedback. We are expecting to bring the Forthos Dungeon to poll in the coming weeks.   
---
*All images and the GIF are works in progress and subject to change. Appearances may differ by the time of release.*   
---
**Location**  
---
The Forthos Dungeon can be found below the Forthos Ruin, a new area created as part of the Hosidius Rework. There will be two entrances as shown in the picture below. We would also reroute the catacombs entrance which currently leads to the giant sand crabs to the western entrance of this dungeon instead. This shortcut must be accessed from the inside before it can be used both ways, the same as how it currently works.   
---
**Rooms**  
---
**Spider's Den (1)**   
---
The first large room that lies within the Hosidius Dungeon is a large multi-combat red spider nest that contains twenty one temple spiders. These are a more powerful species of red spider (level 75 Combat) with an improved loot table. They will also be assignable as a Slayer task in this area by Konar. Adventurers brave enough to enter the den will find an abundance of red spider egg spawns (10) as an alternative to collecting them in Edgeville dungeon.   
---
In the room to the south you will find an injured Saradominist Monk called Brother Aimeri who, once healed to full health, will give valuable information about the dungeon.   
---
**The Grubby Chest (2)**   
---
At the end of a long corridor is a locked gate that can be picked with 57 Thieving. Behind the door lies the Grubby Chest, requiring a Grubby key to unlock. Grubby keys will be uncommonly dropped by creatures throughout the dungeon. The chest contains an assortment of supplies and treasure, averaging 40,000-50,000 gp in value. The supplies will help you survive in the dungeon - working similarly to the Muddy key and Muddy Chest in the Wilderness Lava Maze.   
---
**The Library (3)**   
---
North of the Grubby chest is a library. This room contains 4 undead druids and various bookshelves that can be searched for three tattered tomes. The pages to fill these tomes can be found by killing creatures within the dungeon. Once filled, these tomes will describe snippets of lore about the ancient religion practiced in the southern Kingdom of Varlamore as well as information about the ruined temple dungeon itself. Doing so is part of a miniquest described later in this blog.   
---
**Altar of the Sun (4)**   
---
This room contains a mysterious NPC called Olbertus who has found a curious artifact and an altar for recharging prayer points.   
---
**Sacrificial Chamber (7)**   
---
This small, secret room was used by the druids to present their offerings to the gods. Adventurers will have to explore the dungeon and figure out how to access the secret entrance from within the Crypt of the Moon. Once in there, a lever can be pulled which will open a previously locked door north of the Scorched Grotto.   
---
Eodan the Tanner has set up a small tanning stall in this chamber. While useful, he charges far higher prices than other tanners. However, this high cost can be reduced by completing tiers of the Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary. In the centre of the small room is a bone burner. This can be used to sacrifice bones for three times the base experience of burying them. Players who appease the gods by burning enough bones here will earn the temple key. This can be used to permanently unlock doors within the dungeon to make traversing it much easier. This is designed to give extra value to anyone slaying the nearby red dragons without competing directly with existing Prayer experience rates from the Ectofuntus (4x), Gilded altar (3.5x) or Chaos altar (3.5x).   
---
**Scorched Grotto (8)**   
---
This large room contains six red dragons and five baby red dragons. The west entrance leads to the library while to the north lies a shortcut to the northern half of the dungeon that requires 75 Agility to navigate. There is also a corridor to the north-west that leads to the sacrificial chamber - but the door needs to be unlocked from the other side. This location will be added to Konar's list of potential assignments for slaying red dragons.   
---
**Undead Druids**  
---
Found within a number of rooms in the dungeon, undead druids are a level 105 version of chaos druids. Like other creatures in the dungeon, these can be assigned by Konar as a Slayer task. Undead druids will feature a stronger loot table than chaos druids but won't provide as many herbs as aberrant spectres.   
---
**In Search of Knowledge: The Tattered Tomes**  
---
A new miniquest called 'In Search of Knowledge' will be introduced in the dungeon. Once healed, Brother Aimeri will tell you about three tattered tomes found in the dungeon library. Each can be filled with four pages which are uncommonly dropped by creatures within the dungeon. Once filled, the tomes can be handed into the Arceuus Library, rewarding you with information regarding a hidden burial chamber within the temple - now home to Sarachnis, the mother of the temple spiders.   
---
**Sarachnis**  
---
*Work in progress - let us know what you think!*  
---
Sarachnis is a brand new mid-level boss unlocked by handing in all 3 completed tattered tomes to the Arceuus Library. She is aimed at players around 100 combat who want to try their hand at bossing. At this level, players often try the Giant Mole, KBD or Barrows. However the learning curve from these bosses to high end PvM challenges such as raids is incredibly steep. To fill this gap, we want to offer the chance to learn how to deal with various combat mechanics while being appropriately rewarded.   
---
Speaking of rewards, Sarachnis will drop a unique item: the Giant Egg Sac. This can be cut open for a large number of red spider eggs. Currently, these are usually obtained from the Nightmare Zone or the Tower of Life. A new spider boss offers a more fitting and engaging way of acquiring this resource. The number of eggs a player can obtain per hour will be comparable to the Tower of Life. This is intended to make up for removing red spider eggs from the Nightmare Zone reward shop.   
---
For mid-level players, we expect gold per hour rates to be competitive with Barrows. High level players can expect to make more, scaling with their ability to kill the boss faster. Sarachnis will have a similar reclaim system to other instanced bosses like Vorkath. A chest found outside her lair will collect your items upon death which can be reclaimed for a fee of 50,000 gp.   
---
For the slayers among you, killing Sarachnis will count towards both spider and temple spider slayer tasks.   
---
If you have any ideas for the boss, including rewards, make sure to let us know!   
---
**Poll Questions**  
---
The expected poll questions are found below. These are subject to change based on feedback.   
---
**Poll Question #1**  
---
Should the Forthos Dungeon be added to Old School as described in the blog?  
---
**Poll Question #2**  
---
If the Forthos Dungeon is added, should the bone burner be added as it is described in the blog? This would provide 3X the base Prayer experience for each type of bone. If this question does not pass, it will give the base experience.  
---
**Poll Question #3**  
---
If the Forthos Dungeon is added, should it contain Sarachnis, the new red spider boss as described in the blog? Red spider eggs will be removed from the Nightmare Zone rewards shop regardless of the outcome of this question.
---
Because it's more work for botters to make bots that could easily get the requirement, meaning more wasted time for the botter. 
---
Let's say an Emblem bot that works for 50 hours straight and gets banned, that would be 10% less(5 hours) time suiciding plus the inconvenience of programming another bot for the 500 total req.
---
You calling the idea rubbish is just you being biased.
---
Oh and also, what part of the community hates on BH? The only reason people don't like Emblems are the bots ruining the game in more ways than one, not the BH community itself.
---
Wow, you fuckin hacker, having 2 protection prayers on at once. You can't do that. This is what happens. The game kicks you for cheating.
---
Or you can spend a couple hours of questing and get 500 total level through that. Realistically all you need is 8 or so ~40 level skills and combat stats will cover the rest. Not hard in the slightest. And most people do quests anyway to unlock stuff for their PK account.
---
r/psychoffs
---
That location is like an hour from where I live. Definitely support.
---
I love new quests, however I think the rewards may be a bit much and RNG dependant on the random event appearing to receive it. I like the premise and storyline, however I think the end boss mechanics are a bit too similar to Demonic Gorillas and KQ.
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work.
---
I made one for you up in a comment!
---
I did, but who knows what they mean by that. It's a mid level boss, not expecting it to be much more than move here -&gt; pray this. Guess we'll have to see. Just don't want more half afk blowpipe dps down the boss fights!
---
Oh no..! I remember posting on your original arcane thread, mentioning how I hoped something like that would not happen to you!!
---
Also nearly 500 kc in 2 weeks? You're slaying it
---
Ive been playing on British severs with low pop and had no issues, us severs have felt laggy to me. I am east coast.
---
In addition to the other commenter's suggestions, mithril and adamant platebodies are often profitable alchs.
---
Honestly just make the spider drop eggs a lil better and remove eggs from nightmare zone. Actually just remove nightmare zone completely
---
What a garbage scam, lmao they're advertising rs3 shit. They're really going downhill, sending scams out to a 10-person playerbase.
---
I enjoy the idea of low level pk and min maxing it's a great part of any game. However the underlying goal of RuneScape is to Max everything so there should be higher rewards for those of a higher level. Especially in the aspect of pvp it should be high risk high reward.
---
I definitely wanted to capture that Taverly Dungeon vibe when working with Mod West's design.
---
True, I was having some difficulty trying to think of a static location for postie pete, so I just decided to say the areas he normally appears of which excluding the wildy one there are 5 locations.
---
What would you think would be a fair quest reward xp wise?
---
since its the "mother of the temple spiders" i can expect a flood of baby spiders as a last ditch effort to kill the player
---
Reqs arnt a bad thing
---
Back then it was a lot harder though. ALso money wasn’t exactly as easy to make as it is now lol
---
Gotta train to get 99 social.
---
I feel bad seeing this because I got my Herbi at 143 Herbiboars and never touched them again.
---
Gold per hour will not compete with higher level methods such as Zulrah/Vorkath/CoX/ToB for higher level players :)
---
They can't add any content that won't be heavily botted.
---
Dude you are so right! Slayermusiq has been a life saver. I used to follow guides on runeHQ and remember Desert Treasure taking a couple days to finish. I did it in just over an Hour with Slayermusiq videos.
---
Speedrunners may use it, but speedrunners do all sorts of different things. 
---
Mr No sleep just did 1k kills and did not use Dragon knives. He was killing them hella fast. 
---
I guess i didn't realize claws dropped so much, as i don't use them.   
---
No one is using Mystic to kill Zulrah lol. Its not worth the switch, If you cant use Ahrims you use void for the easy switch but if you can afford Ahrims usually you don't have the supplies to kill Zul-Rah.
---
Can you guys help me, please?
---
I have [this](https://imgur.com/86yfehZ) skills and I want to make some bank before I try the Fight Caves (possibly buy a toxic blowpipe + supplies).
---
Can you guys recommend a money making method I can try? Feel free to suggest different types of money making.
---
I'm already doing ranarr herb runs.
---
It's not that you can't keep am open mind, but if you do not know what you are talking about, strongly arguing comes off as ignorant.

Right now, you can make a viable pking account by cannoning and ranging your way to 60, and there, you're ready for Edgeville. Go to BH worlds amd you will find that a rather large portion of the players are low-mid level pures. Slapping an additional 450 total level requirement will kick the already small pking community even deeper into the dirt.
---
And all that is ignoring the fact that I do not believe 500-750 total is any kind of hinderance to bots.
---
I do have DHCB, so I guess Rigour is the winner here.
---
What would make this difficult is the fact that both the actual form of the item and the notes form have their own item #. If they this was not so, then the game wouldn’t be able to change items into notes form and vise versa. So although you might have a d’hide and then a noted d’hide, the game sees them as 2 different items.
---
Fist full of Rs and Glory
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with your ironman point. Also you think a powerful boss with mechanics and multiple requirements to unlock(did you even read the blog?) Will be bottled as much as NMZ? Right now it's all being botted but safely and unstoppable in an instance so you cant see it. Your logic is flawed.
---
The problem is, a lot of them are trained manually or botted to base Combat stats for less time than it takes for them to be detected. Emblem farmers are being banned AS they emblem farm because the longer you run a bot script, the easier it is to detect and ban them, so if all of your accounts were forced to run the script for a few more days, you’d either 
---
A. Run out precious time on your free week trial membership and cut into the profits enough to make it potentially non viable,
---
B. Would have to run multiple different botting scripts for each skill for even longer which makes it more likely the account we’d get banned before it even has a chance to start emblem farming, 
---
Or C. Just make it enough of a nuisance that they wouldn’t even bother.
---
Can the wilderness lava maze dungeon get an expansion, with as much effort as this?
---
F2p wilderness would benefit greatly from a mid-level boss, along with the teleblock addition and access to looting bag.
---
in all seriousness r jagex gonna fix the bots
---
I'm 1.75k kc with 4 claws and 2 to 4 of everything else... Just want that beautiful pet so I'm so jealous :(
---
But gz though :p
---
Maybe change the rewards and emblems you get below 500 total level. That way min maxers and pures can still enjoy pking and get rewards without feeding the bots as much. Break the emblems down into groups &lt; 500 tier 3 500-750 tier 2 and 750+ tier 1.
---
kind of a new player here but you can get to brimhaven's tree patch fairly easily by using magic whistle on fisher's realm, after that you can just one tap the peninsula
---
You can always buy a new one at ge
---
Drop the cape, get the 99 and telegrab it back
---
shouldnt be killing low level bosses if you dont want to afk blowpipe
---
I bet she lives in the GE
---
Appreciate the response. Assumed it wouldn't be close, just making sure considering max gear/efficiency barrows rates. Have a good one boss.
---
Haha yes to being poor as fuck back then! My cash stack barely went green back in the day
---
Pvp wouldnt be locked, obtaining emblems would
---
Bro they have bots that can do Zulrah now, it's 2019
---
Would be interesting to have a Post Office for him as a quest starter. For the rewards the initial xp for the relevant skills is okay, but leave it at that, maybe add in the medallion with a recharge cost from Pete
---
Oh boy cant wait for that!!!
---
Exactly. My frustration lies in the face that you have to go through loop holes just to keep it..
---
Rev caves aren't enough of an issue that an integrity change like this needs to be made.
---
Emblem farms take very little set up and rake in tens of millions an hour. At least rev caves take set up time and it's easier on pkers to do their thing there.
---
Kill bots at Green dragons for practice, if you kill enough you can fight the boss which is the guy that protects the gold farmers
---
You stir it all up and when it's done
---
Barrows
---
Petition to change red spider eggs into red butterfly eggs for lore purposes.
---
Im not dry, and i do have high skills.
---
Thanks! I'm glad you think so :)
---
She’s a spoder
---
How do you get 70 cooking in 2 hours? How expensive is it?
---
I feel that way about drops. Got flax 4x in a row last night
---
Red spider’s egg catering to Ironman I reckon
---
The boys are waiting for you.
---
I am inevitable
---
PvP fight at level 36+ and you expect people not to come on mains? Lol
---
They can still do that in the wildy of any other world or on pvp worlds
---
Yeah I agree lol. Wish this game was more popular, you honestly didn’t get a good weapon until the end. People complain about others getting better stuff before them but you still managed to do fine with and scimitar and a mage bow lol
---
I seriously sees no correlation between rarity and OP’edness of tbow?
---
Bruv
---
Whosagoodboi?
---
Lmao bring them, we’ll destroy them all
---
Streamer
---
Ooohh, I really like the positioning of the boss. I'm at that point where I've got no trouble doing Barrows or the Hespori, but everything else is either a huge leap away or in the Wilderness.
---
Having viable options before starting on lootsnek or vorkath sounds really nice
---
Thing is though, I doubt neither will be an actual hinderance to bots.
---
The only other actual solution I can think of, which is admittedly not a great one either, is put some kind of requirement/restriction to the free membership trials. After all, the sudden burst of suicide bots are a consequence of the free memberships.
---
Because pkers are abusing a bug that gives an unfair pvp advantage.
---
That's... what I'm saying? I don't get your point.
---
Getting a qpc: 500+ hours
---
Learning how to take a screenshot: 2 minutes
---
You can't have both lmfao
---
Nothing wrong with an elegant and detailed jerk, that's for sure.
---
Well we don't actually know to what extent Song of the Elves will follow the events of Within the Light and Plague's End. We know that there will be the West Ardougne Revolt, the gathering of the clan leaders, and the battle against the Dark Lord in the library. However, we don't know how we will access the library as we do not have a tunnel yet from the Temple of Light. The name "Song of the Elves" implies it might make use of either crystal enchantment which is not seen much in the RS3 quest or the Tower of Voices which is used communicate with Seren.
---
The F2P achievement diaries with a bond as a reward is probably the best way to implement this!
---
Um? Yes i can? What do you even mean?
---
Vpn
---
They all run the same script, which certainly has some imperfections.  97% survive long enough to get 7 QP, but the vast majority are banned within the next 3 days.  The game has bot detection built in, and very few bans are the result of player reports.  I'm not 100% sure how exactly the game's bot detection works so I don't know exactly which parts of my script are triggering the ban.  I'm happy with 8% success rate at the moment as I have higher priority issues to work on
---
Herblore. Super restores.
---
I’ve got one.  You need it to access reddit after all
---
Then enjoy botscape.
---
Howdy first idea. It's a little lacking cause I don't know enough of the meta to give more exact stats without it being OP or dead content. 
---
I added the Skilling concepts cause the boss is supposed to be a middle ground to raids which require skills to be efficient (I believe) also a little selfishly I feel like Skilling is nice but doesn't have enough restricted content to make it worth the investment a lot of the times. So crafting to make the weapon and some way to make it better maybe make one of the rare drops tradable so it has more "value".
---
Maybe also make it rechargeable with spider eggs after the Skilling boost to keep value for eggs after new influx also more reason to farm like zulruh and scales for her rare drop weappn.
---
Would you prefer a grubby mystery box instead?
---
It would be nice to see a crush weapon as BIS, as spiders are supposed to be weak to crush.
---
Bots
---
Just make it pray ranged like the Kalphite Queen
---
In terms of efficiency, gp from konar keys could be doubled and it still likely wouldn't be worth doing. This won't change that. Adding spiders to dura would be a nerf, not a buff.
---
Yeah the free memberships are a huge part of the current botting issue for sure. Any seed obtained from master farmer is crashing hard because every world has 20 bots on it thieving there
---
Seems the mobile hype peaked the player count and now not all of them are staying. Player count is probably normalizing out to where it usually is.
---
Pretty solid. This is my best merch ever I think. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/UzYi2rv
---
Managed to sell it for 60m to someone who was impatient as well :P
---
All it would do will delay them temporarily. The same number will still do it. Just like the recent additional reqs for chin hunting, anti dragon shield etc, the in game anti bot reqs have done nothing to slow down bots long term.
---
All it does is interrupt actual players in the end.
---
Low levels can still pk on any other world in the wildy, or in pvp worlds.
---
Arbitrary skilling requirements actually do a lot, because every bot gets eventually banned, it just takes time. Time spent getting the bot ready means the bot is in action for less time, and also if trying to bot multiple activities, it will be easier to catch the bot faster. High enough requirements force manual training of the bots, which limits their numbers hugely.
---
Wasn't the total level floor like 20 levels above base stats though?
---
Lon it’s always been that way you get used to it
---
Are you the screenshot police
---
It says right in the blog konar will be able to assign temple spiders, and the boss will count
---
Surely a small amount of bank organisation would be a solution to this problem?
---
Wait was this you haha
---
You're saying that your pets were below 3.2m xp. What skill do you not have the pet for that you're considerably above 3.2m xp in?
---
Finally a mid range boss! I've been wanting this for a long time. The bossing available for mid level cb is not great at all in my opinion. 
---
I'm hopeful this will be one of many.
---
As I said in your [other thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bx7dgi/last_resort_account_locked_cant_recover/eq43nn9/?context=3); Jagex can't help you here. As they're unable to verify you as the account creator.  You need to go through the recovery form and focus on previous passwords. 
---
At best they could look into it, but you'll probably receive the same generic feedback you'll receive when you're being denied by the system.
---
Anyway, going to tag /u/Mod_SteveW, maybe he's willing to investigate this for you. But you'll probably get [a reply like this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/brqmam/player_support_upgrading_systems/eomkv92/?context=3), would that help you?
---
???
---
But it's too difficult to make ironmen pvp, especially for things like gmaul.
---
If you can do it, its great because you don't get exp and can grab the loot on an alt.
---
Keep doing your herb runs.
---
Start doing birdhouses if you haven't already.
---
Also do battlestaves when you complete varrock medium/hard. The earlier you complete these diaries, the more money you make in the long run.
---
I recommend wildy slayer for making money. You will keep leveling your combat stats (which will help at Jad) and you also get your slayer up. Slayer becomes quite profitable beyond level 72 and when you have access to better Slayer monsters. Look up guides for optimal wildy slayer, and dont be intimidated.
---
Try role-playing. Kappa.
---
I’d vote no this blog btw downvotes me as hard as you want to vent your hatred on me. 
---
Lots of karma
---
Spidines in tower of life really make it a chill secondary to collect tbh.
---
Why do you want to make this boss better than tower of life to gather red spiders eggs? Assuming it has other drops, if the speed is comparable it's just straight up better.
---
That was the point of Konar, and it's not even that great of a money maker, it just incentives variety. Duradel is still best xp/hr by a mile.
---
Red spider eggs are fucking useless, can we get something else from the boss?
---
Why are you so upset about having to get 500 total...
---
Make sure ur vpn supports java. Try to run another jaba based game.
---
Are you able to go to Probita an Ardy and reclaim it or are you still F2P?
---
I think this would help for a while, until they script something to run through 150 levels similar to their script that auto runs them through the first 7 qps... 🤔
---
I have 2 thoughts to make
---
1) this new improvement will take away the shortcut to dust devils which is a very popular way of training magic these days. Taking away the shortcut makes the catacombs unbalanced. I like the dungeon but don’t re route the existing short cut into catacombs and create a new shortcut on the east side of the ruins.
---
2) I would make the new boss requirement be - if you are off task you need a tome (this combats people who will farm) BUT if you are on a slayer task for spiders then you should not need a tome allowing you use every slayer kill on the new boss. This will create a nice training session while on task. Maybe have a minimum slayer level for the new boss as well!
---
It is a fact that it is abuse. Justifying it doesnt change the facts. And honestly the only difference between abusing shit like this and botting is the mass acceptance of one over the other. You are still in the wrong for it no matter how you try and justify it.
---
The reqs added for chin hunting and anti dragon shield have barely affected the bots long term. Why would this be any different?
---
So you can talk in clan chats
---
Are there any reasons why you want to vote no or just to be a contrarian?
---
It will give the system more time to detect the bot
---
That would explain it...
---
Niiiice that is a good shout that
---
I've been waiting to ask someone like you the reason. What makes you dislike clients like osbuddy and runelite? I personally don't think I would enjoy the game nearly as much if it wasn't for the clients, so I was just curious why some people dislike them
---
Would be cool for them to include some of the discontinued random events too. Sounds like it would be a fun quest
---
If Jagex gonna lock fun shit behind time, then nobody should be surprised when people instinctively choose the path of least resistance to reach said fun.
---
True. Overloads make nmz undoubtedly the best place to train. Not only that, the cost of using nmz is completely outweighed by the benefit herb boxes and other rewards give you. It's completely unbalanced
---
What has mobile making the game more accesible to do with in-game time needed to max? 
---
This comment has more math and explaning than the post.
---
Johno is my favorite because he actually has troll stronghold tele ,true mvp
---
Then you're doing it as fast as you can at this point. That's the main frustrating thing about the fight caves, it's an absolute cakewalk that's costing you like 300-400k in supplies for the first 62 waves, with one really difficult fight (at least while you're learning it) at the end on wave 63. 
---
That combination leads to a whole lot of adrenaline when Jad finally pops up because you really don't wanna lose the time and money you put in over the last hour to get to Jad, and that adrenaline and freaking out leads to mistakes. If you could just attempt Jad by himself a bunch of times in a row I bet you'd learn the fight really quickly, but unfortunately you can't. 
---
Just do your best to stay calm on Jad and focus on his feet, you'll get there.
---
You act like the majority of the playebase is pures with &lt;750 total. Those guys are such a minority. Someone who casually plays the game would hit 750 total in no time, and would have no idea what emblems are even used for. More delay gives the system more time to catch them before they even get a chance to farm. Anything is better than the current situation. If you don't provide a valid counter to what's proposed then you really have no valid argument dude.
---
It was definetely rough, but I just did it in hour increments then went to do something else.  The problem with RC is it takes stam pots, so its annoying to try and grind out on mobile.  At least you can do enchantment and graveyard easily on mobile
---
I haven't done anything except bird houses, they're basically just farming
---
That's just for the observatory one in case i wasn't clear
---
Neat
---
Reflects all ranged damage
---
I saw some guy buy these for overpay at w308 ge yesterday for his clan.
---
I think an issue with this is they're trying to make it slightly beginner friendly for people interested in raiding down the line. So not too complicated but more complicated than barrows.
---
well can you?
---
*Brainlets Mad* 🦀
---
Okay, seriously, what is this ridiculous "me and the boys" meme all over the front page? It has to be a reference to something, but what?
---
Having almost real-time data on every world (with a minute or two of lag time) is not the same as having 2-3 scouts manually hopping every world.
---
Theoretically yes its not a huge advantage because *in theory* every clan of 20+ people *could* be running 2-3 alts checking a couple worlds and have the whole queue checked in a minute or two.
---
But that's not what happens, its always a handful of manual scouts taking 20-30 minutes to check every world and pausing to do hits.
---
Plus small teams use these bots too. Small teams who may take over an hour to hop the full world list otherwise can now know your location instantly.
---
🦀Tower of Life is gone🦀
---
I don't think it's a bad thing for it to be skewed towards solo content. I'm sure most people play solo, and those that don't have enough content to farm together.
---
WG\_CC ingame
---
Would increase price of emblems, invest in emblems now.
---
I mean you could also just join a clan that does mini games together for fun 😅
---
My clan has a daily event, sometimes a mini game, sometimes pvm, sometimes skilling, and barb assault is usually a popular choice for mini game nights 🤗
---
But I feel your pain, we were short a few people on our 2nd team last barb event so we hopped to the event world to grab a few extras, and not being able to coordinate with discord voice/teach newer players was rough! We usually get through a round in 20min, with the randoms it was closer to an hour for 1 round 🙃
---
What? Ive been dating my girlfriend for 4 years and she only causes me stress when we play dota.
---
Its literally how reddit works lol
---
You have absolutely hit the nail on the head! Before I even log in i am strategically figuring out the best way to spend my time so that is it not wasted!
---
I am sure if I had friends on RS I would probably spend a bit more time faffing but at the moment it's been a focus on questing, skilling and maxing combat to start properly bossing!
---
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to reply.
---
Also require elite morytania and desert diary!
---
I think it's the changing left click option, which is the only thing I agree to actually be an advantage for those users
---
Did it say it’s not going to have a pet? I don’t see anything about whether there would be one or not.
---
Butterflies can be scary too
---
There's already like 23 spider pets
---
People would be surprised by how little gold farmers make. Only the best gold farmers even make a sliver of a profit margin.
---
Implying 500-750 total is hard to get and can't be botted...
---
And you tbow is teleported right outside the farming guild.
---
Probably a dumb question, but what is Orb of Oculus exactly?
---
And temples always pray range, I like it!
---
I believe hespori can hit 40 with mage attack. He could get shit rng and die but doubt that would happen.
---
rc bad
---
Lots of pures designed to only PK have less than 590 total level. 
---
I think 500 is too high.
---
Reason: I dislike this piece of content and I just want to vote no. 
---
Anyway, there are people in this subreddit who cannot accept or even see people who vote no as ‘traitors’ of the game. It’s okay, I don’t need everybody to agree or disagree on my opinion
---
Can we get more poll questions based on the rooms and the content being added? Thank you.
---
Barrows is a pretty low level dungeon, you don't need to have super high stats to profit almost as well as someone who does. Once you have an Iban's staff and learn how to kill them efficiently you'll earn a good amount
---
Will try BP. Tbh I didn’t even realize I had so many of these seeds.
---
I didn't know hillbillies knew how to use technology, much less post on Reddit. Impressive.
---
You should have added getting random other friends at the end
---
Sure bud, I bless thee with thy great shield of Dinh's Bulwark
---
to a point everything we're about to do has been set up long before the RS split there's only but so much deviation that can happen from this point sense character motivations haven't changed and a lot of lore about who characters are exists in the quest leading up to this one. it's hardly a reskin so much as trying to continue a story line a story that's been set up forever ago.
---
None of you guys know about risk? Wtf?
---
Same, I had so many very close RS friends back in the day. I even owned a clan and did events with my clan everyday for months.
---
I remember the name of not a single person.
---
Understandable, I use that option from time to time without even thinking now because I've used runelite for a while, but I'm sure jagex can and probably will add a feature like that eventually. Thanks for fulfilling my curiosity, friend.
---
pot up, bp the plants if you can, bgs helps if using melee. if you have a full invent of food and an antidote you should be fine.
---
Ive tweeted JagexSupport a bunch of times and they dont provide any answers. I tweet mods and they dont respond.  What else is there left for me to do?
---
1+1+1
---
Well thank you! I now have a membership
---
Just join a random cc and find people around your level to do things with. Especially once you get to a higher level you'll have a blast pvming with people and you'll naturally make some friends
---
I've admitted it's a problem, but one thing at a time. Jagex is already working heavily on song of the elves, bot detection is not a quick fix and gating rev caves behind artificial requirements does not fit the theme of the wilderness.
---
The answer is bot detection, and removing means of free membership upon account creation. Give it to f2p's after completing dragon slayer.
---
Sorry you’re not allowed to have a family life and participate in OSRS

The other day in the GE, someone random dude just decided to look up a 126 who was making wines and then he just says 
---
"126, are you about to Max?!"
---
"Yeah"
---
So literally 10 minutes later a bunch of people who didn't know each other at all were all celebrating this random dude maxing his account. By the looks of it, he was just going to do it with no one around and not say anything until he randomly got looked up... Pretty cool if you ask me
---
Weird, that's the same argument anti-vaxers give.

Don't be annoying... Just edit the OP instead of linking everyone to a comment

The way I did it was around 44-73 Magic at MTA 
---
73-77 Blue dragons (with deaths that I raised with cats)
---
The one that gets the drop (most damage) get the roll on pet. Tanks are usually paid more than the usual share, and people with less gear does still get split, and better-geared player is helped the less geared players to get gold.
---
What, does teleport Nexus not have that?
---
free to play gear jack ass
---
Lol at least it’s a lot easier on task
---
Your anecdotal evidence is dealing with billing support, well known to be the only competent branch of jagex customer support. It's quick and thorough because they're legally obligated to be so. It's basically the bare minimum amount of customer support a western company can have. Jagex is revamping the customer support process to deal with the well known fact that their support is terrible.
---
Damn bet that took 2 whole hours

Some people have  a life, nerd.

I LOVE how oldschool this dungeon feels. Great work!!

It's hard to make friends these days. See a person in your area and you verbally assault them for stealing your gains.
---
Menu entry swapper
---
Lol i'm also on 3 hydra pets, 3k KC though. Also over 1k kc dry on a ring piece and only 2 claws.
---
Will this boss have a pet? Hopefully yes.
---
I also really like scorpia, but the drop table needs to be buffed.
---
The reason bosses are for mid-high lvl players is that you’d have something to look forward to. Afking at sand crabs &amp; nmz is pretty easy. Doing a couple of quests to get familiar with the game makes for a pretty good time leveling yourself to a mid lvl account.
---
i am trying to login through my desktop after starting this current account through game center. I do not have the link email option in the account manager tab so i am stuck now. any advice?
---
So why not lets go apply 500 total levels for every other bottable skill or minigame too?
---
If your pretense is actually correct(it isn't) then by right, zulrah bots would be banhammered all over the damn place.
---
r/bossfight
---
is elder maul the same rarity as tbow?
---
Oh absolutely, hard wood and quats are the best training out there. Redwood and Celastrus are pretty worth it too once you get there
---
Total level is child’s play to get for the 500-700 range
---
That's not true. 1/3290 for any mutagen,  1/4k for pet
---
I love his vids though. He makes great content its just my one gripe with him.
---
JaGeX GiVe Us PvP uPdAtEs
---
lol not at all
---
I don’t play this game anymore i strictly just keep up with youtube content. With that being said you can do about 10 quests within 2 hours to get your skills to level 30. Combine that with your combat skills it’s extremely easy to get 500 total level now
---
God I love naked russian Mario
---
Probably gonna get whooshed but what about those four is a meme?
---
How about some kind of goblin brothers boss for low-mid bossing? Possibly f2p as well. Seems that goblins play a role in Runescape but there isn't much content around them. And we could finally wear goblin mail.
---
[Here's the guide people mentioned](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide)
---
You can also loot at edgeville in pk worlds as pkers will often leave food like sharks on the floor for other people to take. That's how I earned my upgrades at first when gear upgrades were less than 50k a set.
---
That being said, at such a low level, the time you spend making a given amount of money, say 100k, would be much better spent instead training your skills using free methods.
---
Reason being that in that same amount of time you spent earning a relatively small amount of money, if you spend that same amount of time training, you will have probably unlocked a better moneymaking method. This goes on until your skills hit the 70s thereabout. Food for thought.
---
Im afking Magic trees on mobile while at work, and I was wondering if Cutting at the myths guild is better than the WC guild? I know the WC guild gives an invisible WC bonus, but its filled with bots, whereas in the Myths guild, its 100% empty and the bank is also a lot closer. Just wanted to see everyone opinion on this.

I feel like this wouldn’t be very useful considering most Ironman players have alts to buy bonds, or they would just drop trade items to their main to buy bonds for cheaper off the GE

95% of my friends list is made up of the codes now. I can't bring myself to remove them.
---
Legitimately asking. What would you like to see?
---
when I was focusing, had little to no missclicks, and no pkers were around for an extended period of time, my peak was 450k xp/hr which I held for about 25-30 minutes
---
200 IQ! thanks for sharing this

Verzik is?

Steve’s head is still huge too

it will remain free.
---
That’s hilarious, unfortunately it doesn’t seem to work for me though.
---
WTF. Why didn't anyone think of this before?
---
Holy shit, I wish I didn't read this. I'm at like 184 QP and I legit keep up with the lore.
---
Honestly I 100% agree that the clan chat requirement is  pretty stupid, and I agree the clan chat system could do with an update, however I feel this is different because BH isn’t F2P and I doubt most people looking to try PKing for the first time will be going to BH over wilderness PK. Also I definitely wouldn’t consider myself a veteran. I legit didn’t know this game existed until Settled’s UIM maxing video randomly appeared in my recommend list on YouTube.
---
How on earth do you get to 99 slayer with only 92 magic? This must have taken like half a year
---
I gave a guy full rune back in classic cuz I wanted to join his clan. There was no clan
---
People cry about relatively trivial updates being ezscape, and you think a literally private server afk-for-3-hours-to-max-combat battle arena isn't a problem?
---
I need this template
---
So? And im sorry but people thT cant do jad its way more than 2 hrs. If it takes them 10 tries thats atleast 10 hrs
---
Yes please, all but stepping under, I don’t know why but I absolutely hate that mechanic
---
Hey, this is unrelated to your comment but you seem to know what you're talking about on this subject and I'm too afraid to make a new post.
---
I know like nothing about pvm but I have finally hit a point in my non combat skilling where I need dream mentor and I have base 40s in cb stats. Could you explain the mole/barrows bracket as you call it? What sre dtat requirements and stuff? I just don't really know what pvm to start with and if I'm gonna be grinding all my stats to 75ish anyway I might as well learn.
---
I literally don't understand this comment. 
---
Why should a level 3 CB be allowed to make profit woodcutting? Why should a level 100 CB be allowed to make profit fighting dragons unless they've gotten 50 fishing? Why should a person doing thieving profit unless they've level their prayer? 
---
Well... because skilling has fuck-all to do with PKing maybe? And unrelated skills/concepts shouldn't be a requirement for stuff?
---
And also - tell that "inherently limit" shit to basically the entire defense skill. Until you reach a threshold level, leveling your defense is a huge detriment to a PKer literally due to the game mechanics. And then you need to jump it from 1 all the way to 60/70 in one leap or you've got a fucked up underpowered, overleveled account. I don't think people *want to* limit their defense, but they have to in order to compete, due to the game mechanics.
---
I smell bought account ;)
---
Unskulling should not be an inconvenience. "If you went pking and now you want to do a clue scroll you need to be punished by waiting until your pk skull expires."  What your saying is just another way to keep the wilderness dead and make players less efficient and more annoyed.  As you will see.
---
This is pretty much the same question I had as a mid level recently. If you have the morytania hard diaries completed it is a lot closer gp than most think for mid levels. I don’t know how you are getting back to zulrah but the run back cuts into your kills per hour and the teles cut into your profits. Another thing to note is how scales have been dipping in price lately which again, cuts into profit. Now, if you’re looking for an upgrade to help with either, I suggest an occult necklace. Both methods rely on magic damage primarily and the occult is a good boost while being relatively cheap (less than 1m). Like I said earlier I had done both of these a decent amount to build my mid level a nice cash stack so if you have any questions about my set ups/banking methods feel free to pm.
---
I think your right it does look alot like that dagger that dagger coating mils is  in part why I was considering a curved sword would be cool it's probably gonna big a big spider. 
---
The hilt idea is cool as well maybe even some fashion scape with clue hilts? 
---
I've only been playing since November so still pretty green and no the community can be a bit extreme in terms of power creep or changes and I'm not knowledgeable enough to really try and make stat suggestion or even know the main difference between sword or longsword or dagger other than people telling me that I'm better off using scimmy then whip. 
---
When I first got memby and was asking about what I should do someone gave me the dragon scim andrtold me to play until I could use it Haha. 
---
 I really like the concept of a nice high mid boss that drops some rewards for Skilling. I'm a fan of Skilling and didnt really know that slayer would have been a way better use of my time Haha. I can do barrows pretty easy and the last 2 weeks grinding combat to finish mm2 and ds2 for quest Cape so not entirely newb just mostly newb. 
---
Thanks for some discussion.
---
YOU DIDN’T MINE GRAPHITE BECAUSE THERE ISN’T ANY!
---
You learn every single zulrah rotation, attack pattern and movements in 2 hours? You must be god's gift to pvm, please fuck my sister.
---
I remember back before the GE ya boi hit 70 attack and (naturally) spent hours spinning flax so I could get that DOPE whip I seen everyone running around with. Figured out I couldn't train strength with it and hated it, so I went to sell it for the same price I bought it. 
---
Hoped on W2 and strolled into fally with my whip (and subsequently my rs life savings) and found a buyer amid all of the colorful, wavy, blinking text. But somehow, Everytime he popped up his 2616K (which was 116k more than what I was asking), the trade kept closing out. He told me frantically that he had to go and to hurry and trade him. This happen two or three times. 
---
So what do I do? I accept this mans next trade as fast as I possibly can. I'm two inches away from PHAT 116k profit baby. The trade goes through. Guy says thanks and insta logs. 
---
Then...much to my dismay...I realized he actually put up 2166k instead of 2616k.... I slowly dropped to my knees and shoot my fists in the air as I screamed in frustration. Screw you guy, screw you.

Analyst, but happy to share my LinkedIn with you if you’d be happy to share yours.

Come on, rhino needs slayer helm.

You've gotten too used to runelite to realise that regular left-click is swapped, need he say more?

I dunno man I think it looks kind of badass. Not attractive sure, but definitely intimidating.

This guy has no bois.

Just reminded me to watch episode 5 - Thanks :)

Not emblem farmer bots. These are suicide bots and **do** get banned within a couple days.
---
Clue helper. And don't give that bullshit reason about it being QoL and 'you could just search it up on the wiki anyway'
---
Thats boosted, Im not 92 magic.
---
Yes but you have to telegrab them to pick up
---
A great way to bring more red spider egg sources into the game, feels very well placed in the world!
---
Show the math
---
Maybe you start where she is in RS3 and go to the mountain where she is in a cave.
---
Those will definitely get you banned, sorry.
---
imagine not rotating through 10 chairs to keep them smelling like roses lmfao
---
I haven't personally seen any of their features but from what I can see theirs is a paid service. This will remain free of charge. This is more of a personal project I've decided to make public.
---
Then you just end up making an ironman account and the addiction is somehow worse 😂😅
---
No, but it might use up a good chunk of the 2 week trial, and give a good chance for the bots to be caught before they can do damage.
---
Wow this is the most old school feeling update we’ve had since launch lol
---
un
---
That's a range pot bro
---
I think it’s in winter 2017
---
Not everyone wants to pay twice as much for bones. I just do 100 superior bones a night at the chaos altar and I'll be at 99 in about another 25 days. Not everyone needs ehp lol.
---
I mean, the game’s been out for 2300 days. You could easily have a maxed account with a large bank and lots of pets even if you’ve only played an hour a day since release.
---
And yes, there are people that play a lot. Some of them are youtubers/streamers, so it’s their job. Others spend a lot of their time online afking while simultaneously doing other things. And yeah, there are some people whose entire lives revolve around rs that aren’t making money off of it, but they certainly are few and far between.
---
Get your OSR Sex Change today!
---
What'd they say?
---
??????? You don't think pures include 99 strength, 75 attack pures? Do you not know what a pure is?
---
Gotta to into Bios to change it
---
Because despite being able to be removed, they haven't been.
---
There is, you use pvp worlds and camelot teleport, its the fastest method in game I believe
---
3k kc btw
---
I mean really how are they risky though? You can 3 item and still make Mills an hour on most worlds if you're not braindead.
---
Looks great! Keep up the good work
---
You bet your ass I flew out of my chair when I got rangers on my iron(took me 400 clues).
---
I guess being excited that a long grind is finally over is fake though.
---
Maybe he did it with regular bones, you never know
---
Yeah they’re emotes so you can’t see them unless you’re on desktop and have the BetterTTV extension installed on chrome
---

Even Mod Acorn had to change position.

---
Nah, 1k

500-750 total is literally nothing lol.
---
It would be neat if Zulrah popped up as you were hopping and you had to avoid/tank. But it is also possible that instead of going towards Zul-Andra, we could head towards Castle Wars since we don't have the other quests that take place there.
---
Happened to me way back. When to buy an adamant long and it was in note form. Got quick swapped for a bronze but I was so excited to have my very first adamant weapon I didnt even look. Wiped my meager cash stack and 9 year old me was devastated.
---
I understand man I'm not really trying to compete to be honest. If I could be helpful to some people without them having to pay for a premium service then that's mission completed. At the moment I'm using the OSBuddy dataset, what other sources are you referring to? There is a wrapper for the main RS API available which I could use to get the price from and match it with a selling price from OSB if that would make it more accurate?
---
I’ve mixed them up tons of times on mobile doing master farmers. Search wine and withdraw them. People derp sometimes let’s be real.
---
Phone works just fine for what I need it for.

dude is a friend of mine memeing he hard disagrees with you.

Kill dragons, tan hides, alch d'body, take bones to altar, repeat?

Thanks

Whole new level of wilderness ptsd.

Bitches be trying to scam my alt
---
And yet they can be attacked in the wilderness.
---
If what you say is true, ironmen shouldn't be able to be attacked by other players. Since they can attack and be attacked by other players, we can conclude that ironman are not pve exclusive.
---
WTF, people with maxed accounts don't wanna fight each other?
---
7m an hour? Where do I sign up?
---
Well in arma and dinhs you have to try hard to die to a solo pker but against a team chances are you could die if they bring 4+ people
---
Love the content. Keep up the good work! :)
---
UIM and it isn't close
---
For me, I don't usually feel a sense of comradery from playing with others, all I usually see are people correcting one another without provocation whenever anyone even hears about others playing inefficiently, or they're just noobs who are only talking because its easier to ask chat than Googling things. 
---
If the answer to their questions didn't immediately spawn 10 more questions, I'd be happy to help...
---
It feels few and far between to meet anyone who's ego isn't inflated beyond belief. Now I just play with chat minimized.
---
I've never played LMS but this vid piqued my interest. what are they updating about it?
---
If you bought wildy weapons you could duo the wildy bosses really easily.
---
&gt;So I've just recently started doing some Barrows runs, are some people actually able to do more than one run per trip?
---
Able to? Of course. Is it worth it? No. Escaping the tunnel takes absolute fucking centuries lol. Faster to just tele out, pool, and tele back.
---
I know him!
---
I'm a fan of whip scorpions
---
Ah yes, I believe Grog is another item for that.
---
Any tips for avoiding carpal tunnel lol
---
Can I pet you?
---
That’s why there’s bonds so you can earn them with f2p it’s causing more issues to the osrs economy then helping bring in new players :/ I would personally donate like 20 bonds to 20 new players to stop all these bot farms lol

Pretty sure someone else had this same problem recently... I've read it a few times.

[Gee idk you're the first person to ever ask this question.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=osrs+money+making+guide)

precisely what i said, lol

Lol I've spent over 2m trying to git good at f2p pking. I'm probably 15-50
---
Only impressive thing on hcim is ds2 and thats just 1quest

i was referring to the clan chat restriction that faladorable brought up. idk if there would be adverse affects to a bh total level restriction but it sounds good so far.
---
Big respect. Salute.

Love this, especially a med level boss with active mechanics. Definitely the kind of content OSRS could use

im pretty annoyed they fixed this but still left it in pvp areas..... it's such a bad game design choice, and I had so much fun playing with it.  the only place it was broken was fire pvp world lures and I feel like they could have fixed it a different way

alt f4 does the trick for me

it feels like barrows might not be a nice goal after all then, cause I saw some pretty far away requirements. Do you have any idea of some nice early/mid game goals I could work on? That arent that far away like hard diaries?

Hell of a series. Everyone should watch Chernobyl and listen to the official podcast.

Runelite has an option called Menu Entry Swapper that can make Use the default leftclick option on bones

I would like to see PvP updates that pkers want, korasi, loot key scroll, elo system, bh rework, and why not new stuff also, currently pkers get small qol updates that are represented as "pvp updates", basically changing pvp world from 325 to 324 every 2 week was "qol" but it made more ppl quit pking than start...

So are the XP lamps going to be going to runecrafting now that swamp boy can hunt baby implings?

the rs wiki says nothing at all about drop rates increasing as you go up. they're static and never change. the only thing you can really calculate is the likelihood that you go x number of kills without a drop, but it doesnt affect how common the drop is.

Swampletics is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Canifis Inn's bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. He asks what I do. I say I loved him in the haunted mine. He laughs. I get my moonlight mead. "Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Swampletics? He touches his neck as he watches me leave. Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. "Got a spare?" he asks. "What's in it for me?" I say as I hand him one of my little white ladies. he smiles. "Conversation with me, duh." I laugh. "What's so funny?" he protests. "Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the dopamine seratonin?" "You get used to it," he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter. "What would you do if you weren't an ironman?" I ask. "Teaching, I think." "And if I was your student, what would I be learning?" "Discipline," he says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where are you from?" "Bermuda," I say. "Oh wow. That's lovely." "It's ok," I admit. "Not everything is to my liking." "What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?" he inquires. "I don't like sand," I tell him. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."

I had just started playing OSRS when a guy walked to me and offered a runic scimitar, I declined the trade and he said "noob". I just said "Man, the people in this game haven't changed one bit".

Watch party in W330 canifis bar, anyone?
---
But it isn’t specifically designed for iron men, which is what people are usually talking about when they say catering to iron men in updates.
---
Everyone sees the benefit of a 60 minute timer, not just Ironman.

However, ironmen get hurt far more than regular accounts do without the timer

its really silly to consider things that were discovered to not actually be speed ups, because they were technically possible before they were known. but even if you do theres still significant problems with your list
---
mining is not the same, mining cape perk, prospector outfit, dragon pick and varrock platebody are significant boosts
---
smithing is addy plates (debatable as its very expensive)
---
herblore is more different than you give it credit for given the availability of birds nests and other secondaries in 2013 vs now from drop tables/birdhouses/new content
---
fm is 20% faster for over half of 99
---
fishing has angler
---
cooking is the same in that 1t bwans were a technical possibility, but there wasn't nearly the supply of them in 2013, it wasn't realistically viable at all, wines were neither because no grapes from zulrah, the fastest realistic method was sharks
---
black dhide bodies weren't viable in 2013 because there wasnt revs/bbd/vorkath supplying black dhides
---
hunter is like 30% faster with black chins
---
con is like 10% faster
---
Barrage them br0

Uh oh, I made him mad ;l

You can't lamp RC without completion of Rune Mysteries
---
Yeah, that’s the typical Runescape elitist attitude developed over the years, like if you don’t do something their way you’re a monster... I’m 1940 total and have always stuck to my own game, been playing for a little over a year and even have 99 rc... people just like to sound important with that attitude. And then when you do get those difficult 99s just because you wanted it everyone around you thinks you’re autistic, insane, lonely or depressed... dude I’m just playing the game, I don’t need your titles.
---
A game that involves using thousands of different items very repetitively for thousands of hours with multiple different menu options missing the ability to swap menu options for 18 years is a pretty big "*fuck you*" from Jagex. I'm not about to get upset that RuneLite finally adds some functionality for it*(which is still very limited)*.

i remember seeing the "buyer" for that scam offering to buy burnt bones for 100k or whatever in varrock w2. I actually booked it to greaters as fast as i could and came back with like 10 pairs of burnt bones.

It shouldn't be an argument to keep the timer. Ironmen shouldn't be taken into consideration whatsoever with anything, wether it be updates,mechanics, changes to the core of the game etc.
---
More than that, since saved bones still have the chance to recycle.
---
It's a very small portion of the pvp community and was basically a non-issue while there's a mountain of actual fixable issues in the pvp community that affect all of the playerbase, not just pkers who are maxed
---
Feels like another ironman boss update
---
130k karma and you are still begging?
---
But make it more expensive
---
The date a game came out has nothing to do with how good it is
---
Maybe give the leg as a unique drop? Or combine it with something? Potential low/ mid level crush weapon, crush weapon to fill the gap before hasta and bludgeon. Make it weak to crush too? Maybe this idea sucks but
---
Ori is the best game I’ve played in a long time and the sequel comes out this year

That was the longest, happiest 13 minutes I've had on YouTube in a long time.. great job :")

... yeah but you have to bank less. its more than that.
---
Did anyone accept your bet?
---
youre not counting bank times.
---
I would say the 2 new free to play bosses are great low level bosses. They even have really decent loot (). The problem is that many players don't know about them when they're low level.
---
The reason I say this is because I've been camping about moss giants for several days for melee training/money and most of the folks who I chat with while killing giants in edgeville/varrok dungeon ask every time what mossy key is for. these range from low level new players ("I just got membership" to high level experienced players (100+ combat level who are also giving me much needed tips on my equipment)
---
idk how you would get the word to these low level players besides word of mouth from other players or their own curiosity looking up the keys once they get one.
---
Seriously how can this happen, its getting silly. Cant imagine what its done to the economy
---
New Jojo episode AND new Sampletics episode in one day?! Today is a good day for anime fans.

I'm pretty sure they have already wiped all of my stats to 1/1. What would be the issue with giving me back my original account?

Combat isnt zero time
---
RC is faster
---
Mining is faster
---
Smithing is faster
---
Herblore depends on what u do
---
Fishing is faster
---
Cooking is faster
---
WC is faster
---
FM is faster
---
Farming faster
---
Agility faster
---
Crafting depends on what u do
---
Fletching is zero time
---
Slayer 3-4 times as fast yep.
---
Con close to same its so fast it doesnt make big hour difference.
---
Hunter is far from the same. People getting 260k with blacks as opposed to 160-180k whatever they were getting with reds.
---
Conclusion: Youre wrong with everything pretty much.
---
Dope
---
Please tell me u did ma'am

An account that broke a bannable rule once is always broken account. Even if you were to get it back whatever you achieved on the account would at least partially be from botting.

Not even just that. The last video he literally said he was going to get the whip in the next video, meaning anyone who watched the previous video should've been aware that he was going to get a whip.
---
Because I'm on the shitter at work and can't watch it until I go home
---
Yes
---
Oh okay, so then what does 74% chance mean then i dont really understand it:/
---
Briefly, “Mouse Keys” is an Operating System level accessibility shortcut that allows your keyboard to act in lieu of your mouse. The easiest way to find it is by searching “mouse keys” in the start menu on Windows, or going to System Settings —&gt; Accessibility —&gt; Mouse on Mac. 
---
Mine lets me use my numpad as a mouse (5 is then left click). I then turn on the keyboard shortcut to toggle mouse keys on/off. I find that this is great for having to click in the same spot for an extended duration (e.g., pickpocketing, alching, etc.). I believe this has been explicitly allowed by Jagex since it’s not a “macro”.
---
This series is just over-the-top good.
---
We don't deserve settled.
---
&gt;530 hours of temple trekking, 45 kills for the whip.
---
Wew lad that's some dedication.
---
It's gunna be fuckin disgusting I guarantee it.
---
Okay if that is true then why do other people who have gone through the same get their accounts unbanned? Wouldnt Jagex want to recirculate the items that are stored on the account for the economy?
---
Literally jagex: no, requires engine rework. Their engine is one of the worst to adapt with is what I've learned over the years.
---
I think when your a respected runner you can get from 4-5, but to start ~3
---
HolyPower1. Introduced me to the Gnome Ball and fucked around all the time on Runescape.
---
Oh yeah if you find yews AFK you’ll love reds. It’s a big grind to 99 but you’ll get there.
---
&gt;I don't know what day is it
---
A shit load of people do it as an ironman, you get so many runes from barrows its ridiculous
---
Your completely missing the point. The comment I was replying too was “there goes all the profit of pking”, as if he/she is somehow entitled to making money pking on a pure, to the detriment of the game. Jagex is under no obligation to make every niche play-style profitable and valid, that would severely compromise the game. 
---
Skilling is not unrelated to pking. Somebody had to cook the food your using, make the Sara brews tour and P pots your drinking. Just because you wanna level 4 stats exclusively, run into the wildy and make 1m an hour, doesn’t mean the rest of the people who play this game have to deal with bots infesting every single world. Sorry, your gonna have to level your fletching and actually play the game jagex developed.
---
I LOVE YOU KILLZONE &lt;3
---
I love you both
---
He paid for his extravagent luck in blood when he went for the mith skirt, hah.
---
menu swap plugin, it's runelite exclusive
---
Oh. Well that makes it much easier.
---
I don't either. I'm not depressed or anything but I'm great at being an introvert. It has its perks sometimes.
---
You say this sarcasticly but in other games this is considered a grind!
---
I was at work in my office when this was uploaded. I shut the door and couldn't stop cheering throughout the video. People at my work think I'm weird because the door and the panels next to it are see through and they saw me cheering excitedly seeing that drop.... But it was worth it
---
He tried to get a task from Mazchna in the Slayer Tower. It ended up being outside of Morytania, and he has no points to cancel. Thus, he must train slayer unconventionally.
---
A month is still too long. 😭😭😭
---
It would be beneficial for the items to be removed from the economy, you botted and got banned, just make a new acc if you want to play
---
I just looked at shitty gmauler that's got mith gloves, 50 att, 60 str, 70 range and it's over 500 total, it's really not hard for something that would help gold farming so much.
---
They dont get unbanned for botting. Also based on the dates you gave on your account you wont have an osrs account. All of the stats and items would be rs3 not osrs
---
The boys are lit rn.
---
Can carry 28 sharks, can also carry only 28 needles or 28 different seeds
---
45 KC whip, I can hardly believe it
---
I see Jase paying 4m/hr for astral runners which is like half xp of lavas
---
lol what kind of cosmetic could a spider provide? would it knit some cloths for you before it died? 
---
Actually Jagex make us a spider grandma boss next that says stuff that knits the entire fight please and says "take a seat dear" when it kills you.
---
&gt;one dose of super range 
---
Dam you got 109 herblore? Must be nice
---
True. For some, that's half the fun. Like Kemp trying to get a gmaul on his 10 (11) hp ironman.
---
I finished 99 this week :(
---
Yeah I have coal bag, ice gloves, and about half of the graceful outfit. I'm getting 660k/hr depending on prices.
---
So I guess I'll stick to this until I can do zulrah. Do you know if rune is better profit than adamant, once I hit 85?
---
b0aty
---
Items they’re currently marching. They don’t want to leak it.
---
Yes but gilded is double the bones required on average
---
i love you too &lt;3
---
I'm watching this in the bathroom at work
---
I would try, but believe it or not I learned how to play on a touchpad. I’m really not sure how I did it, but I wasn’t that bad. I remember using some website to organize highlander matches, those were a lot of fun. But I use a mouse now, and I would have to relearn the game muscle memory wise :/
---
Very nice episode, Thank you
---
lavas are 7-9
---
Have you got authenticator?
---
&gt;269 souls have been rescued by Burgh De Rot. Let me tell you, I am definitely not one of them
---
LOL
---
Wait what
---
Thanks to Recruitment drive ;)
---
Relax.
---
Pretty sure most animation stall lures didn't even use veng anyway. I don't like the change either. I also don't like how they keep pushing to make the rules of the game different between pvp and the rest of the game
---
You know, on that account I do not. I should probably add it and see whats happens.
---
I don't know what you did but the microphone seems to fuck up randomly. I don't know if you lean back and forwards or what but e.g. at 2:32 you're loud for one word, then you go back to an appropriate volume.
---
Or just add deaths office that rs3 has, you pay for the cut of your items g.e. Value. You protect 3 of your most valuable items of course (4 with item protect) so you don't have to pay for them. Doesn't work in pvp too.
---
Impressive
---
Sorry that this is an MMORPG?
---
f2p ironmen have to use rune essence and body runes is the highest they can craft.
---
May god have mercy on their souls.
---
wow i was going to write out my crashing story at caged ogres but it went exactly like this, did the same guy crash us lol
---
I'm not saying you aren't taking unnecessary damage, you might be. But I have no way of knowing. Probably can just brute force it with more brews lol.
---
Ehh what can u do:)
---
but this game is runescape.
---
Scrolling reddit on my phone while watching netflix... safe to say netflix got turned off
---
 
---
Worth the wait.
---
i was raised on "move your feet lose your seat" so it's the second option for me
---
This post was so long I skipped to the end for copypasta, but was pleasantly surprised by the sincerity.
---
Hermit Tim
---
Collector is probably the easiest.
---
Attacker isnt too bad either. 
---
Healer takes a bit of strategy and can get a bit sketchy in the later waves if you have low def/hp teammates. 
---
Defender is the hardest theoretically, but ends up being the easiest imo if you follow the Lord Shayne defender guide on YouTube.
---
*another slayer dungeon... and more keys* 
---
Yup that’s what osrs needs
---
? Clearly meant clicking on the bone then altar opening the inventory interface is slow and buggy
---
Nice brain btw
---
This is an actual spoiler to future content though.
---
**This is a screenshot of Swampletics' hiscores as of today, just an FYI people.**
---
#Don't post spoilers in Swampletics threads.
---
How do you make it so when you use the f-key it can close inventory?
---
side a: "Jay not Durial"
---
1. tip.it interview, mostly credible source (lets say 80% chance it's true since people are really skeptical here?)
---
2. durial321 was a member of 3v0x &amp; 3v0x members *voodoolegion* &amp; *ste the g* were present at the massacre (and he traded items to them - can be seen on video) - I think we can consider it 100% since it's on footage
---
3. Abyss (reliable source) had an interview with Hero - Abyss knows Hero really well, and Hero knows Durial since they were in RoT. Credibility: depends on how much you trust Hero.
---
4. Voodoolegion had an interview with Silentc0re where he tells the whole story - *if* it's really him (insert some skepticism here) then he's the ideal first account of who Durial is and what happened on the day. Credibility: you decide, but no inconsistencies in his story.
---
5. RoT application &amp; RoT links have *some* merit since the Youtube channel that uploaded Durial videos had the Durial321 account pking together with at least 1 RoT member ('sumwun', who was also mentioned in the application). Credibility: decent.
---
-------
---
side b: "Jay is Durial"
---
1. screenshots (but name can be photoshopped or stolen from 3v0 forums). 
---
2. pk videos (but it's common for pk videos to be posted and he could've just taken them). 
---
3. login/ban message (but also really trivial to fake). 
---
--------
---
tl;dr 
---
if we are really trusting of info provided, it leans in favour of A.  
---
if we are really distrusting of info provided, it still leans in favour of A.
---
I agree, but without the third line there's too few syllables (and with the third line there's too many).
---
Calm down Suzan.
---
Yeah for sure, i think a change to the BH store might be more effective.
---
It’s not a 74% ‘chance’.
---
It is a statistical observation that 74 players out of every 100 have received one or more items after that many rolls of the table. It doesn’t change the fact that for any item on your next KC is 1/128. The same for the drop after that.
---
You maybe aren’t as unlucky as you think you are right now but you’ve done the right thing by complaining on reddit because everyone gets a drop after doing that.
---
Can’t use b gloves with void
---
I feel like I wasn't tilted when I was messing up, just mis-executing slightly. I think I just stop taking in game information when I'm trying to fix certain mistakes and then I mess up.
---
I do have problems tilting during other things though, I'll look into how to un-tilt without having to stop playing
---
Humans? I’ve been  waiting since the Big Bang
---
I fail to see the point of any of this.
---
Uhh you can just point out that a 4/4h buy limit is 1 per hour. So 49 hats = 49 hours....
---
2x DWH spec + Void + Rigour + DHCB + 3 procs of Dragon Ruby Bolts (e) + Woox walking during the fire spitting fase
---
we're starting to really stretch the definition of a "pure" at this point
---
Something had been missing from my life the last few weeks, only now i realised what it was.
---
Keep up the good work swampboi.
---
Or you can use your minimap which has a compass on it
---
This was my thought exactly. They are already tracking it. We just want to see it somewhere ranking players.
---
One of my favourite cartoons &lt;3
---
benzos, then?
---
Killzone is so dreamy
---
Awesome thanks
---
I have 200+ qp &amp; I still hate questing. Might sound weird but hating them so much, but loving the game made me want to grind out as many as I could as fast as possible so that they'd be over with.
---
&gt; However, this high cost can be reduced by completing tiers of the Kourend &amp; Kebos Achievement Diary.
---
If I'm not mistaken, this is the first time a diary reward is added afterward. Do you plan on generalizing this with future updates ?
---
I fucked myself up and looked up ModWolf's images. He is not a cute trap. I'll refrain from looking up Husky and pretend he is one.
---
Why nsfw tho
---
That video was just way too good, my god. Dopamine for the week is fulfilled
---
I got my first mission.  Completed it. Next was in an area where i coulndt go
---
quests can be botted a lot faster than something like 500 total
---
I don't get why people don't just change their registered email. When they're being spammed with phishing links. You may accidentally click on one of them one day. Just don't risk it.
---
Hah, sorry, rune. In Portuguese it's called "Rúnica", got it mixed up.
---
Banning bots is a losing war for jagex. The more you ban, the more you make. Adapting to the changes the botters make to their bots is SIGNFICANTLY easier than the work jagex has to do to adapt to them. As such, jagex will always be a step behind.
---
The real solution is to stop botting clients from working. This requires a whole new game client (lots of work) and since RL/OSBuddy are essentially botting clients without the bots, they will break too. 
---
I would much rather deal with the bots than lose RL.
---
lmao, i sat here watching it and literally yelled "pick it up!!! just pick it up!!!!"
---
my lvl 70 pure is 882 total just from training str/range/mage and the rest is all from ancients and mith glove requirements
---
I didn’t post any numbers unlike the guy who replied to me, and he straight up said throughout this episode it was whip -&gt; hunter grind. It should be obvious that he was going to start gaining levels very quickly very soon after this video took place. What did I possibly spoil for you
---
well he is training like 7 skills at once
---
Slayer is like 100k/hr for killzone
---
Fool you don’t know what you just did to yourself. You will spend the next four days on that boat. May the depths show mercy on your soul.
---
hmm....if he saved up max points at pest control and waited until the end of the week to spam the xp. How much xp is that? Lol im just trying to figure out how. The other easy answer is that he saved up points and skipped all low xp tasks and just did bursting tasks
---
They absolutely never said they would do that. Jagex is definitely not changing their detection system to accommodate 3rd party clients lol.
---
How about a buffed version of Zulrah called Zukrah and you have to kill 60 waves of Zulrahs then 3 Zulrahs at once then Zukrah which attacks with Ranged every time you switch to mage pray.
---
He's doing a series called "by release" where he does quests in the order they were released and only has access to content that was available at that time, the series is original but I watch it more for his personality, he's a great editor and producer
---
Making it a toggle would be dramatically worse overall because it would require artists to do literally double the work for every update. And a wholesale update wouldn't pass a poll. It's better the way we have it tbh.
---
Open up his cc on both his main and swampman, have a dedicated discord
---
Have hundreds of people spread across morytania looking for implings for him
---
I’m still a woman. Anyone buying gf?
---
Thanks.
---
why ruin it for yourself?? i made sure I didn’t look lol
---
God knows.
---
Looks like you’ve finally got the skills to start playing the game
---
I care more about the potential DC/internet turning off.
---
is this on hard rumble or what mode?
---
Did you miss the montage towards the end of the episode? Pretty top tier as far as OSRS video editing goes
---
What a waste, watched it on my tv with a pizza and some beer.
---
Sooo many master farmer bots.
---
Alright let’s not get crazy here
---
Some guy telling people to turn Adblock off when you watch the new swampletics episode
---
Why is this downvoted? Guess you triggered the 900 total plebs with 2m banks lmao.

I only play in mobile. That snake was a nightmare to kill. Took me almost 30 tries

Ooh, thanks!

How do you find framerates on your tablet? I have a Samsung tablet and it's choppy as heck and when I tap it takes a second for it to register. Makes playing on it difficult. It's a newer tablet so it's not like it's an old hunkojunk.

You should work on losing your virginity

Kandarin diaries requires some barb assault
---
And I
---
What's your YouTube channel called so i can find it
---
Level 5 all rolls is a req for kandarin elite diary.  Other than that not really unless you really want a fighters hat for BIS stab bonus
---
swamp man get paid
---
No, the only way he could skip the task would be talking to the slayer master in Burthrope.

Xp tomes can be for any 5 skills alone or a combination of them.  Not every tome was a Slayer tome.

---
Oh man did he just devalue your Temple Trecking Only account?
---
God damn it swampletics ya did it again
---
would still be an easy 50k
---
I mean, 1 task at Kq is a lot of fucking kq
---
A Friend would've necked himself.
---
Could combo this with AHK remap for F-key + click + F-key are three keys in a row so you can just press three fingers per bone and just aim with the mouse...
---
hmmmmmmmmmmm
---
probably dies everytime tho
---
I use an alt as bank next to the npc and budget tank gear, low risk of death and low costs of death, insane xp/H just from extremely short re-fills
---
It's like when your favorite anime gets passed to a different studio for the new season.
---
I don't even play OSRS and I can't get enough of Swampletics. MOAR PLZ!
---
Yes but only have a buy limit of 4
---
Good idea, maybe after they have done the chicken they will get sent into the flax fields until they have picked 10k flax
---
Well anybody that gets a Red Spider task is likely to kill the boss just for increased profit over regular Red Spiders and if the boss dies quickly for high level players like they claim, I am sure the boss would be popular like all other Slayer bosses.
---
It's either Cannon the spiders for quick task, or Slay Boss for increased profit.

Cheers for the FUCKING SPOILER ARGHHHHHH

Dragon sword, dragon hunter lance

Last summer I was unemployed and spent 10 hours a day grinding vorkath and eventually got burnt out after 4 days. 
---
Guys like this blow my mind. I eventually quit runescape but damn I miss it sometimes
---
That’s pretty damn funny, but sad.
---
[S]
---
Could be t65. Wouldn't be the worst idea tbh, dragon sword is pretty bad compared to zammy hasta.
---
Nothing in this image implies an ultimatum tho. Either a dumb meme excuse or a legitimate addiction with a deleterious effect on this guy's social and romantic life.
---
I like frogs and hate spiders. The choice is obvious
---
Swampletics is a temple trecking only account lol
---
45kc is like 20% chance it’s really not that unlikely

Wow!

F2p pvp is a very minor fringe community.

He said nothing about him you dumbfuck
---
Same.. just got quest cape last month lol
---
Blufjoe? Is that you?
---
lvl 60 in each
---
180 cap?
---
cause hes been posting it multiple times
---
She let me try anal. 10/10 would recommend.
---
Yeah, fortunately for Americans
---
As said by everyone else, he’s known for his currently running By Release series. But before that, I liked him because he was a Runescape Machina maker and his comedy skits were hilarious.
---
99 thieving
---
I stayed late at work on a friday because I saw this had been posted as I was closing out tabs
---
It might look small, but he still needs to get another five 99's.
---
VIA 9 G A G . C O M
---
its not trolling when you're unironically bragging about being 1900 total and having aotc lmfao. think what you want tho.
---
It's quite sad this is the type of content you resort to when all hope is lost, continuously doing the same thing over and over again until you get the feeling of getting something done and being successful, only to get knocked back down by your concurrent viewers resorting in getting nothing done at all, sometimes you wish to go back to times where we support you, but then you realize this is all you're getting because your chat made you.

Golden Gnome of the year goes to......
---
now we just need gear targeted arround 100cb.  like new t65 and t55 weapons and armor!
---
Ram ranch really rocks
---
Uhh you can just point out that a 8/4h buy limit is 2 per hour. So 49 hats = 24.5 hours....
---
I'm at work right now but if you can't find anyone else I can hop on for just a couple minutes to help you.
---
Wotth the wait
---
Not worth doing off task I'm but if you really want a little taste of bossing you can
---
It’s always the low level irons talking the most shit.
---
I probably phrased that poorly. I’m pretty sure anything I could avoid would one shot me, so I was wondering if I was praying incorrectly or should use a different armor set up. I’ll try more brews and see what happens.
---
great job on everything on the rework. really like how it feels more like early runescape without the neon colors.  just simple, well done designs with not overly bright colors :D
---
...? 
---
Look at the xp drops it’s actually 1-tick lmao
---
Also grats on being able to click fast I guess?
---
Thank you! Much love and respect
---
someone pays 15$\\month ;\\  
---
105$.
---
Fair enough. Not what I meant, though.
---
Came to the last one-was a great time. Cant wait
---
more likely is your losing ticks and not getting as many autos off as you could be.
---
Just because it's sarcasm doesn't mean it's funny or good.
---
How long ago did he actually get 85?
---
If they didn’t add a statue for Lynx Titan achieving 200m in all, what makes you think they’d do it for this?
---
why do you think that's an unpopular opinion?
---
Also he's hilarious
---
&gt; knowing the fact you are doing this together.
---
Ironman btw :^)

As a mod from the CC that was being advertised, we have removed these spam bots from our clan chat a multitude of times. They have been spamming populated worlds, other cc's and locations in a way that is intended to degrade our public image in some way shape or form. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT OURS. — Horrifying
---
Yeah nerf it for pvp world's only
---
"control-flow obfuscation"
---
Specifically for reflection/jvm bots, that's extremely important for developing bots. Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse
---
I’m guessing someone is totally gonna grief him
---
just sell boosts. ah waste of time
---
d claws on me
---
My entire account exp fits in the gap between top two and I am like 1850 total
---
I never said it did
---
Last time I checked it was 40k~ to 85, then I went on a job, so IDK exactly.
---
This one will be interesting because the best part of the drop will be locked behind song of the elves
---
how is it the first time I'm seeing this lmaoo
---
"Sewer rat"

Make it have no magic level so tbow is useless, and make it not only immune to poison and venom, but it heals by 50% hp if poisoned/venomed.

Only if you fail to take into account the herb box money you're forfeiting by spending all the points on potions
---
Yes personal attacks when youre wrong always make you look better, its working
---
Pretty great stuff, I was wondering if Duradel would be able to assign tasks for this place similar to how Konar would as the species of monster in this dungeon are notably different from that found on different worlds.
---
I am a maxed main 200m all exp, would you like to rival me?
---
I mean I dunno man I enjoy the journey to get to a 99 but the point of the game for me is to achieve stuff, more and more and more. I want to max, I want to get boss drops, but the most I'll do is ping the people online and tell them "Hey I'm about to get x 99 at x location in x time if you're interested." And when I get it, I get the cape, I buy it, I emote, and I'm onto the next thing.
---
Maybe part of it is the ironman mindset, but the 99 is just a part of a greater goal to me. The 99 crafting I just got wasn't necessarily for its own sake alone, but also for the fact that it allows me to work towards my next goal. So when I get 99 crafting, I'm not wanting to sit around doing nothing, I'm wanting to go do the thing I got 99 crafting for. 
---
When I got quest cape, I didn't even ping my CC' I was just like "Well I can do efficient karambwan fishing now, time to go afk fish."
---
Haha it is very much explained in the lore of the dungeon. You just have to go ask him! :)
---
Do you think 3k scales and 2k darts would be sufficient? I am thinking of using verac's helm and skirt for a bit of tankiness.
---
Just a quick thank you to anyone who posted spoilers for this episode in other threads, but used the spoiler formatting and warned us so we could still enjoy this episode blind.
---
Yes that should be plenty, and veracs with blessed d hide body/boots is a good call
---
No.

We done here?

You sir, are a thief!

I'll have to train wc then. Only stat below 70

isn't it amazing how everyone is the best on reddit?

Your whole existence is a waste of time from what I've gathered so far..but like I said, I'm on the clock for 32 more minutes, so you've got me trolling you for that long. Keep stepping up to papa.

Cos I see people post on twitter and the likes they receive and all the comments.

Yes i remember you man, this is rsmw_much, not sure if you remember me but i have you added already, my name is CAPTAIN PIMM now, i have talked to his brother sam but we can talk later obviously

Practice, practice, practice my dude
---
The intention is for the Giant Egg Sac itself to not be stackable to incorporate that inventory management aspect
---
Fuck that, gaining xp PKing is something you've had to account for since the game came out. All 10hp rushers alone would be awful, let alone all the other douchey builds.
---
When it's reposted again
---
the map in the blog of the dungeon feels so much like older dungeon designs, love it

Sarachnid looks awesome! Sick dungeon too

As someone who only recently played his first wintertodt game, I finally get this meme

Kinda awkward that you'd say that when most MMO bosses reside in instanced dungeons or raids but ok.

You're telling me people pay 150 dollars to go to a convention for this game?
---
And I thought other things were stupid.
---
Pump and dumb baby
---
See the problem is we would definitely lose in a fight.

That is 2x exactly lol. The series is convergent. The same way we write e=lim_{n\rightarrow\infry}(1+1/n)^n.

I don't know, man. I swing a mean pickaxe.

What a toxic mindset.

I resent how readily this community throws away minority portions of the playerbase with no care when they think it'll have some other benefit.  Three majority hates pkers, hates pures, hated ironmen until recently, hates people who don't like questing, hates people who only like skilling, etc. etc. etc.

They are reworking bounty hunter. I'm assuming they will have some sort of wall to prevent bots from easily participating

I lolled so hard my gf woke up

I wonder if you're more biased because you're bad at PKing or because you're an 83 Combat pure?
---
Probably both.

There is a bukake of dopamine in my brain rn.

I did the exact same with some guy in the stronghold when I got my 99 slayer, he made it really special 💖 even called me Slayer Master Naqvi

Does my WoW membership connect to my hearthstone?

Maybe unpopular opinion but the music montage in the middle totally detracted from the video...

We watch for the interesting account and commentary, not for your taste in music

Social awareness is a skill not built in your bedroom playing RuneScape
---
Yes.  Membership is shared between both games, it's not possible to only have membership on one of the two.

thanks

such a boring streamer

I think they made finding Lord Crwys into a Farming/Woodcutting activity rather than just Woodcutting, and I believe they are making finding Lord Amlodd into some type of Hunter activity instead of Summoning. Probably will just put Lady Meilyr somewhere else besides Daemonheim to skip the Dungeoneering portion.

It's not really a replacement for any of those. Tree runs with tree seeds from bird nests and other sources are the best way to get farming xp, slayer usually gets you herb seeds for herblore training, Tithe is cancer incarnate but good extra farming xp if done complementing tree runs (though I don't recommend it for xp's sake)
---
What watermelon seeds are good for is huge amounts of convenient supercompost that you can turn into ultracompost (with some farming gains as a plus). When you are doing tons of herb runs you'll be needing hundreds upon hundreds of ultracompost, having some volcanic ash with you on allotment runs means you can simultaneously make ultracompost in all your bins while harvesting and planting the melons. And Temple treks are a good way to get a ton of melon seeds fast.

Probably from zulrah. The drops are shared in the log
