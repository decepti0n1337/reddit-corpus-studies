Please stop with the herb patches. Theres already a bunch of reason to go to Priff. Like where does it end?? Last 3 major updates have all included a new herb patch.
---
Some batches can yield generally shitty loot. Just luck of the draw.

These people need to learn a lesson in Runecraft

I lost a lot of my cash with a similar scam before when I was around 9. I think i bought charcoal for a ton of money because they convinced me it was rare.. I thought that if I was stupid enough to fall for it someone else must be aswell. Made a profit out of it later on in the end. Now I feel a little bit stupid that I didn't go find out how to get that item and do it myself lol.
---
Don‚Äôt think anyone knows, I believe he is playing other games now for a bit or forever who knows 
---
as long as this is untradeable

Rs3 has a fraction of the player base and makes by far the most profit, your argument is stupid.

Got a pair of ranger boots back in 2016 and I'm *still* riding that horse.

Convince 12 year olds that this is the stream for them starter pack

Not the same table but depending on what your killing, they are often both 1/5000.

I agree, that would probably be more fitting to the whole idea of tasks being selectively assigned as rewards. 
---
My friend said he used to follow around one of the UIM streamers when they were doing slayer and picked up their drops, and that was how he got his first whip lmao (as a drop that they didn't pick up).

I heard that a tattoo artist would propose to  draw the tattoo on them first without tatooing. Then go walk out and about for a day so they are positive with what they want.

Add an agility shortcut for the dragon's eye master clue step. Longest clue step and very inconvenient due to Legends Quest's outdated code.

heheh can't help but laugh at this comment. this was me 2 years ago. notice how i don't post here anymore. just move on bro, it's out of our control. look at how many employees they have, you can't justify that many if you're not pushing big content every quarter, and you can't justify big content without unsustainable powercreep

Rev Caves, unfortunately. I died about 5-6 times I would say, but I had people try to kill me a lot. It took ~15k kc for Lesser scroll, so about 20 hours.

As a tattooer I think this shit is wack as hell, and as a runescape player this shit is lame as shit

It just does seem to me as though they *have* started pushing some

 nerfs or changes through as "Quality of life changes" that are fairly obviously buffs or nerfs where they wouldn't have a year ago.
---
I think its the natural progression for a dev team that wants to change content that are also aware how much the community can hate change

im calling bull shit, 90-92 average is 20% higher then what the actual average is, which is between 7-9 herbs a patch.
---
Here is a rough numbers of herb run values per patch in the past couple years, if anything you are making more money now then you were back then, and if you cant even hit a 300k profit now (which i already called bullshit on) i doubt you were making even more back in the day since herb runs are more profitable now with ultra compost and additional patches then they have ever been before.

Please for the love of god and all that is holy Jamflex, do not go to Activision or EA

Resets your streak tho.

Because those two are physical attacks and magic attacks are magical

You are hardcore

The gauntlet sort of reminds me of stealing creation

Yea and how dare they think that that‚Äôs foam on top of the mug when it‚Äôs clearly residue from the protein powder in the hydrating beverage.

god i would love to see this
---
We can‚Äôt make money off the the armor with the shards being untreatable, and it‚Äôs more the past few updates, like the new slayer master, and the drop tables on the new monster feel like it‚Äôs for Ironman with all the runes and pure essence
---
but if you compare the time to make a pure account vs time to make an equivalent cb level account with defence, its like 20x if not more. A 50/99/1 account in the 70‚Äôs takes so much more tike than say a 70/70/70 build. In addition to having to be careful how you quest, etc.
---
Is League really that bad? League is one of the most popular games in the entire world and the vocal minority always say every season is the worst despite early seasons like S3 being way worse than we remember

Just do the same to him as was done to hyphonix.

For a second I was wondering how you are in a firewall, but then I remembered that Palo Alto is a real place...
---
&gt;Your proficiency with swords doesn't give you any extra defense against swords. Your proficiency with ranged weapons doesn't give you any extra defense against ranged weapons. Why does magic get to be special because it is "magic"?
---
The answer is literally 'because magic'.
---
&gt;Since when? You can train defense with any of the 3 styles.
---
Which is always depicted as you training *against the physical attacks of monster*.
---
The simple reality is it's not going to change. It's a core game mechanic. The whole point of OSRS is that they're not going to change the basic game mechanics. They're what make the game unique and give it soul.
---
If you want to play a soulless rip off of Runescape that looks roughly the same but has had all its life and soul removed to make way for a 'perfectly balanced' and boring af combat system, then go play RS3.
---
COLORBLIND OPTIONS PLEASE

What does that have to do with getting a rune pouch?

Rappers are big faqqots

Yeah I know. I‚Äôd still like it to be faster. Call me impatient, but when you‚Äôve farmed 50,000+ herbs you kinda wish it was faster lol

Not technically. Also 80% of the clans advertising are scams.

Where can I find Mankriks wife?

Asking for a friend.

The desert treasure bosses are extremely easy, if you've put this off for 30 combat levels your average everyday monsters you kill for slayer are probably more dangerous than DT bosses. 
---
Also ancients alone makes DT worth it

Can't be any worse than Geoff Iddison.

Thank you u/shit_explosion very cool

League of Legends is and always has been a really awful game. It's designed by developers that have absolutely zero faith in their players. When they copied all their hero designs from DotA they got rid of things like Rupture because it was 'too confusing' to players that running away would hurt you, and various other things that all come down to 'this feels bad'. 
---
It ends up with nothing in the game ever making you feel *anything*. A lot of the most enjoyable mechanics in multiplayer competitive games are things that temporarily make your opponent feel a bit bad. Teleblock makes people feel bad. Getting frozen makes people feel bad. Splashing makes people feel bad.

Why would anyone want to trade one Chinese overlord for another?

I do believe Proselyte counteracts the effect of the Ava‚Äôs. That is the point of this post, not that he is wearing prayer gear. Unless, I am mistaken.
---
Those fuckin rocks are the pits. I‚Äôve had to jump 10+ times to find a world where they‚Äôre free. I‚Äôve also had occasions where cunts spawn and try to steal them, hoping I get frustrated and log off. 
---
They should add a second set where the stalactite is. Near that ‚Äúunidentified materials‚Äù lady. 
---
Oh Darn?
---
How dare Jagex give us more content and more things to do in the new zones they are making? Fucking bastards.....
---
/s
---
Literally what most people sound like. Who cares if we had literally 100 herb patches around Gielnor, what would that change? because adding additional herb patches isnt really affecting farming profit margins, or herb/seed values.
---
Yes it is, multiple JMods have said swapping is allowed, getting scammed is at your own risk though.  There is no "technically".
---
Someone didn‚Äôt watch a guide 
---
Could we please get a shuffle button for the in-game jukebox? I would listen to in-game music so much more if this was a feature.

I don't think the polls actually keep the game oldschool though.

Nothing wrong with discussing PvP, what's wrong is your inability to understand how subjective a player's competency in a GAME is.

Thanks for the tip

Somebody just posted a video of him making the same sounds after he won a ton on a stake.

lmfao then why u getting downvoted to hell retard

Maybe he hasn't done that

I'm not mad that I upvoted this. I'm mad because I didn't think of it first

It's the Motherlode Mine; check it out

This actually happened to me on runescape classic when it was just runescape. Someone said trading phat for black scimitar, then someone else said trading black scimitar for Santa hat. That was the last time I saw that Santa hat.

i rmb this video, it was the shit, but....

Petiton: Rename the farming guild to thieving guild
---
Make all option for smithing... Please
---
So is how many hot pockets you ate yesterday
---
No, absolutely not. If anything, it should be raised to 80%. There's a clear distinction between the kind of content that passes in the 75-80% range (tends to be crap) and stuff that gets &gt;80% (is much more old school feeling).
---
just curious what has caused the huge relative price decrease death runes over past few weeks?
---
I am?
---
What was your xp/hr...currently doing lavas and I‚Äôm definitely not getting 70k hr like the guide I watched said 
---
Mining fletching woodcutting smithing fishing firemaking theiving 
---
Yeah so 's Yoshi then
---
LMAO
---
This makes me mad and happy at the same time maybe 890+ dry clues might be the problem idk....
---
Look at the clear and evident response a la 15 downvotes at the time of your comment. You said the word forced as if them adding one extra herb patch is going to ruin your game and profits. 
---
as a female im offended by this post
---
50/50
---
You dont understand, at all. Im talking about high risk high reward wildy rejuvenation variety, cause its all on revs nothing else in wild is worth.
---
Pkers only pk at revs because other places u get a glory, bucket of compots and some limp roots which cost shit. 
---
same goes for pvmers, 99% wilderness pvmers = revs.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I feel like you and I would get along well. 
---
the same people complaining about rc are probably at motherload mine getting 30k exp/hr. 
---
I also have diary cape and my lowest skill is hunter at 71, i'd rather do any form of rc over chins. 
---
Na that‚Äòs kinda impossible, i got 45-50k before 75, then you can use the large pouch and that‚Äòs more like 50-55k.
---
- let us clear any farming patch by using a spade on it (with a confirmation dialogue of course)
---
 - At the moment trees can be cleared like that, but not bushes, allotments or herb patches
---
 - especially with farm guild there is definitely a reason to "dig up these healthy plants"
---
- make seed box easier to use
---
 - toggle (or upgrade) to change left-click to "use", and using it on a patch plants the relevant seed
---
 - if you have multiple seeds for that patch, it opens a chat box menu
---
Gz man I hope I can get one someday
---
I'm not really having that kind of balance discussion. I'm just saying to not make something available to people, less available for no good reason.
---
I don't know the stat requirements behind the new quest, but it wouldn't really be fair to put high stat requirements on a weapon upgrade that accounts without those requirements has been able to use before.
---
I can assure you it isnt seeing as I literally just did 65-77 then decided  to just got for 99 (currently 94 and counting)
---
^ all have the action except Runecraft
---
You have absolutely no clue what you‚Äôre talking about do you. Next time just don‚Äôt write a comment. 
---
Awesome idea ! A boss that normal people can fight.
---
QOL = actions against bots?
---
  
---
Lock the ability to use glory teleports (house included) behind completing the easy Wilderness, Karamja, Lumbridge/Draynor, and Desert Diaries. 
---
Lock the Edgeville furnace behind either the easy Wilderness or Varrock Diary.
---
Lock the ability to use Phials behind Falador medium diary.
---
Lock the member's area bank/deposit box in the Mining Guild behind 70 mining.
---
Lock NMZ behind Lunar Diplomacy quest.
---
pffff  
---
like a pker has ever done enlightened journey 
---
well, i have been around and looting at wilderness since RSC and never waited over a minute for loot to appear. might have been at the time when trading was killed or gravestones era but meh. who cares? go buy yourself a looting bag next time
---
No it actually wasn‚Äôt a joke at all. I didn‚Äôt operate at maximum efficiency the whole way through, I was averaging around 20-25k exp/hr the whole way because I was shit at it and afked while doing schoolwork.
---
They really do. I enjoyed all of the GWD2 bosses, [Vindicta and Gorvek](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicta) are my favorite.
---
It isnt called crafing, its Runecraft
---
Most skills in runescape BAD!!! 
---
Runescape in general *superior game*
---
Umm... in terms of this game, that is very, very little
---
PvM is more profitable than anything in the game.
---
Might as well take out the other 20 skills and just have Strength, HP, and Slayer. 
---
Yeah I agree I want to see the little updates that RS used to be all about. One little quest here, one new thing here, little small updates every week.
---
Oooh I know this one! Its... Runespan!!
---
I can tell you have like 50 farming.  Every herb patch you add just lowers prices to adjust and makes your trip take longer.  I already don't bother with herbs anymore.
---
Oh this old thing? Yeah ive had it for a while now. How long you ask? Pfft. Several minutes or so..
---
$11
---
I'd love to see proper touchscreen support on the windows client, for tablets such as the Surface.  I imagine most of the barriers have already been overcome with mobile :)
---
MLM is way better xp for mining than bloods are for rc.
---
They've already copy pasta'd enough from rs3
---
Crafting is called crafting however, so the logic makes no sense
---
I gotta say that is probably the best moment in rs if that happened to me
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs due to the downfall of pvp/wilderness. Back in the day I‚Äôd say a bigger percentage of people were in the wilderness, while mostly maxed accounts did bossing
---
Can‚Äôt use looting bag on pvp worlds, and you may be right about the gravestones/trading disabled era. That I know was 3 minutes so eh fuck it lol. I‚Äôm just stating now low level pvpers have a hell of a obstacle with that issue. 
---
&gt;finally
---
Gzzz o/
---
IT would be a Race to load up right after a update.
---
There already is that it's called the DISCONNECTION
---
Thanks, glad to know I'm not being a noob just standing around the knight lol. It's good to know the void set is used in money making methods; of those you've listed I've only done barrows but I'm excited to know I can use it later down the line. 
---
No i actually havent killed revs for like 2 months, since i have 70k kc i can tell you anything about rev caves.
---
I do pk alot frequently at revs and its only place which is worth to pk. 
---
Other wildy bosses are so dead u hop 30-40 worlds to find a guy and turns  out he risks a glory.
---
Other place is wildy altar but thats mostly pvp, rarely u get a bone runner which risks alot, but it happens.
---
Keep grinding, didn‚Äôt get my full set till over 700 kc 
---
Hydra
---
Maybe it's an easy thing to bot for money (herb boxes) while also training a new staking account cause their last one got banned for scamming?
---
They're not botting NMZ because they are high level, they are high level because they are botting NMZ.
---
They didn't start NMZ at lvl 120. 
---
I understand you were addressing the idea behind it. What I am saying is I think there is a lot of room in between choosing not to use an NPC to playing your own game mode with self enforced rules with friends.
---
It just seems like we jumped from one polar side to the complete other.
---
You know what you are right man, vorkath was my goal, im going to grind my way back. 
---
9 patches is already too many. They've added three in what feels like three consecutive updates. 
---
Same. I'll go on mobile, put on a movie and just click click. I think the problem is the osrs community throws around words like "efficient" and "xp waste" 
---
Only if ur over 85 mining
---
How can you do it so fast then? is there a way to have the mummy be in the northern door always?
---
Right click to dismantle on bird houses and when setting up it up it will autocally be filled with the first type of seed in your inventory. So many times have I clicked on other players trying to fill my bird house. 
---
and the new crystal tools come out with song of the elves, prifdinnas, the new pvm solo content, a new skilling boss?
---
Are you thick?
---
Found the one who burns everything
---
 I freaked out IRL, couldn't believe that It had actually happened.  It's definitely Top 3, the only comparable thing would be FFA scythe and getting my first Infernal cape.
---
This is how we much prefer the game to be developed. RS3's prifddinas completely revolutionised the game. That's a bad thing.
---
Not sure if this has been said but, can you add ferocious gloves to the Attack and Defence skills tab? Like when you click on Attack and then click on Armour you will see "80 Ferocious Gloves (with 80 Defence)" and then vise versa for the Defence tab.
---
Right, was more asking about the actual game design stack. Unity?
---
Yeah I meant on top of that.
---
Hey , noob here. Can u explain to me what this is
---
I will openly admit I macro‚Äôd one time and I used a full on bot, not an auto clicker. 20 minutes or so later I got a 2 day ban. So it isn‚Äôt always an auto typed or such. 
---
wtf, b2b pets?
---
By seeing you receive gold on the other game...?
---
It's only annoying cause the stupid pouches degrade and I can't be arsed figuring out how to do it efficiently cause it's stupid.
---
Hunter
---
Other than the magical and effective part this is 100%relatable
---
If its anything like Plagues End in RS3 then he is destined to die. 
---
Yes. The way prayer factors into the calculation, you divide it by 2 and round down. The odd numbered levels will never give you a combat cuz once you round down they're the same as the level below. 
---
870ish 2.3 rings and 1 leather
---
fuck you I won't do what you tell me
---
Between Mage Bank and the Wildy agility course
---
No.
---
If someone follows you or tries to talk to you you have to immediately teleport to your POH and sit there stress eating for 15 mins 
---
Nice
---
You should've included torags to compare ranged def.
---
Both of your comments are true. It is a weird exception but I think I‚Äôm just reiterating on what the original idea was and wasn‚Äôt looking to counter your logic by any means! 
---
You can pretend that earmuffs are headphones
---
Can‚Äôt change a strongly held opinion chief.
---
Under rated comment lmfao 
---
Good for him. I hope he can use his passion to help him be successful.
---
let's stick agility in there too. it fits with the elf theme
---
lots of fart sniffing going on in here, does this personally affect people somehow?
---
Yeah but it has an er instead ohwl
---
The new Hydra boss drops a shit load. I did like 600 kills on release and got like 20k bloods, 20k deaths and 20k astrals
---
loool they look like shit. sit kid
---
Agility at seer's is 50k+ xp/hr with ~200k gp/hr
---
Runecrafting won't beat that xp rate unless you're doing something like lava runes
---
They don‚Äôt get it because their expectations were significantly raised on release and anything less than what they were getting will never be enough. 
---
no there is a difference between less profit an hour and not as much profit an hour which are 2 very different things.
---
You dont lose any money by not doing it, you just dont earn as much, very big difference between the 2. You current EXP/GP an hour will stay the same if you dont do anything different, so it comes back to what i said, they could add 100 herb patches, and if people dont use them, they dont get used, and if people feel the need that they have to use EVERY SINGLE ONE well that is their personal problem.
---
And the other thing people dont realize, is even if they did add 100 more patches, seeds come into the game at a fairly steady rate which wouldnt change, so economically you would push towards a low supply high demand which would then raise the prices back up and increase profits.
---
And you cant say if it really takes longer since we have no idea how to even get there yet, if there will be a TP or not.
---
....there are tons of capes that either give prayer bonus or ranger bonus. way better than a +1/2 prayer bonus from a blessing. 
---
Or stand at he and it‚Äôll have the same effect
---
Please for the love of heck implement this
---
nothing says it couldnt be visible while in the ammo slot
---
But what about an AGS?
---
Doesn‚Äôt this already work by them hiding the chat for 30 minutes before they open the chest? 
---
This is horribly difficult to read - why would you put yellow and white text on a parchment background?
---
&gt;A text based guide is like reading a text based guide
---
Yes.
---
Doesn't matter if you head to bed at 10pm or 430am - your mates always get a drop after you go to sleep
---
Activision won't because of Blizzard. 
---
?
---
just do the day 1 strats of uim and die to an npc and you have an hour grave
---
Beside fountain of rune
---
Just use entity hider :) No problem
---
Because training defence is linked to dealing damage, thats a separate thing altogether.
---
great more dead content
---
Didn't they say they were done with herb patches when the one in Weiss was released?
---
im working on this myself right now. got soooooo lucky. literally 7 scrolls in 7000 total kills. got 5 scrolls in 1 day... 2 left so i could still be in for a big grind but i hope my luck continues lol
---
Ah I see, thanks for the help!
---
All pretty irrelevant, I'll always see people who range Jad to be beneath me.

Yeah but the slayer helmet looks better

There is also a vyrewatch spawn every 3 tiles and there is no cooldown on how often they can ask for blood tithe.

look at the thing beside my name, i gotchu ;)

BLACKED.

Who knows, I don't think anybody played stealing creations.

On thing I‚Äôm voting against is the herb patch probably

YES!!!!

it's still a pretty fun thing to meme about though

What about \*\*Autistic Ironman?\*\* - double XP for 1 skill only, and you are only able to train that skill or use the "flap" emote.
---
All skills suck. Never gotten a 99 and I've been playing since i was 12.
---
73 kills LUL
---
Everyone starts over in OSRS anyway so not a big deal.
---
A lot of places don't even care if you have face tattoos or any tattoos for that matter. I don't have any but I have coworkers with a bunch of face tattoos and make 6 figures so I never really understood the whole "that person will never find a good job" thing

&gt; Rare yes, prestigious? Ehhh not so much, that parts subjective, skilling pets can be obtained by anyone

"Something bad was added to the game in the past so that gives anything similar to it a green-light in the future!"

Hunter is easily my least favorite skill. I like chompy bird hunting better than the whole skill.

Runecrafting:

And Proud of it

Have you fully recovered? Are you able to love again?

it's just a redo of the top post right now

with further consideration at your end, i think you should make "JamZ 3D" a captain or general :)

It's a game.

Is that better?

And add more black demons, because every world is full at peak times.

It's good but it doesn't even work for one full task.

But it's not gonna change yo

to be fair, 1m runecrafting exp with blood runes is a lot better than 1m runecrafting exp with...any other method
---
I dunno if this is bait or you are retarded/ havnt played recently lol

we dont need more herb patches. theres already too many

Very much agreed about the crystal bow.  The set bonus isn't powerful enough to make the crystal bow viable.  I'd really like to see this quest or some other content in prifddinas add something to the crystal bow to make it viable again.
---
Absolutely. Buy low(ish), sell high. Maybe Jagex will end up in better hands as well. Only time will tell. If anything I see this as an indication that the parent company and market value Jagex fairly well. 
---
* Something to address items on the ground at places like wintertodt or blast furnace as discussed in last live stream
---
* Allow coal bag to be filled from bank interface
---
* increase amount of words allowed to hop before getting told to wait. If its an issue of server capacity (i.e. you need to reduce the amount of login requests for performance), I understand, but otherwise this limit impacts player's ability pleasurably play by finding open worlds. 
---
Thanks, I appreciate the feedback
---
This guy is spot on! Also figure out the jad spawns so you stand near his spawn. Nothing like getting hit for max from a mile away after an hour of playtime. 
---
bold of you to assume you'll be able to do the grandmaster quest of the elves quest line without completing the elves quest line
---
Amazing lol
---
Maybe make the black demons in the catacombs a different variant with more heads or four arms since they‚Äôre the buff version anyways
---
Too late, we already got the drive only ironman.

Any chance for the fighter torso to get a better design on the female character? It literally just looks a grey block

EA: Allow us to introduce ourselves

Thats what hes saying lol.

The time spent from 85 to 99 is the majority of the time training the skill.
---
&gt;Defeating Zalcano will grant small amounts of experience in Mining, Smithing and **Runecrafting.**  
---
People unironically train this skill through a weekly xp drop and lamps.  If this boss gives xp, it needs to be minimal.  
---
Always stoked for more quests though I am a bit disappointed that we haven't really seen any intermediate-experienced quests as of late.  It feels like they are either huge or take 10 minutes to complete.  Would love some solid 45 minute - hour+ long quests.

Decreases profit margins. I don't make any more money doing my snapdragon runs than I did before the farming guild update. Ends up with the game either getting more tedious, or you lose money. 
---
We‚Äôre not seeing a lot unique here though, which is my big concern.
---
Hunllef is just a downgraded Chambers. Lolcano is just a boss that you use a pickaxe for combined with Penance Queen. No new resources or skill opportunities. Armor, weapons, and tools right from RS3 with nearly the same effects.
---
I want to see stuff the calibre of what made me so excited to finally get into Prif on RS3. Cool, brand new stuff that I could explore.
---
I get this is Blog 1 of 2, but boy, the majority of this is Blog 2 stuff. Establish the city first.

Crystal armor doea have range bonus and is gives a buff to crystal weaponry
---
I was always so proud of him when he sticks the landing on a good comment (probably 1 out of every 10.) Everyone upvotes him and never tells him to shut up, and its always wholesome.
---
those other 9 times though...
---
I heard that somewhere else. Good to know thanks man
---
I thought they were really common but I wouldn‚Äôt know I‚Äôve had them blocked since the beginning.
---
I don't think it'd be better than justiciar for that
---
Hammers require 70 str too, jamflex keepin the accurate man down
---
Correction; the day runescape is booming, and all the worlds are at max capacity, Ill support a second ge. Till then no.
---
Just because an item has been in the game for a long time doesn't mean it shouldn't ever change. A slight nerf to d'hide or a buff to karil's will barely affect the popularity of the items as there are no real alternatives when it comes to ranging, especially in the wilderness.  
---
Wait what. Really? I read that black chins is about 5-6 mil gp an hour? Or is it safe to use weaker chins?

I had no idea, thanks for that. like for real.

Holy shit I forgot this existed. Ah the memories
---
I like the idea of a crystal crop, even with the recently expanded farming guild. Just need to come up with an idea on what it could do. They seem to want the crystal shards to come from the other activities in the city and that's fine. Could be a secondary for a new potion? Or there could be an NPC that accepts the harvest in exchange for something. A crystal crop could provide something for warding, but that's not certain to pass.
---
Same
---
I‚Äôm a fan of the crystal axe , but as of right now not the pickaxe and harpoon. I have to see how hard those items are to get.
---
Rune Crossbow, Anti-Dragonfire Shield, Anti-fire pots and you‚Äôll be fine 
---
Please this. Make it an attachment with the new quest requirement that gives dps in between a rune cbow and bp. Make the attachment always risked in pvp so it can't be used as an upgraded rag weapon. PLEASE I  need a reason to use crystal bow it's my fave weapon in game since I was 10.
---
definitely break out that flail then asap
---
Yep, also gives people a reason to return to Prif after the quest and engage with the skilling content there. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt really detriment his game play too much with this gear compared to a nezzy, torso and dlegs combo.
---
Maybe you could be a decent member of the community and advise him though?
---
I usually range pot when the magers appear, saving at least a dose or 2 for jad. I take 2 bastions. Switch the coif for verac helm and where are your b gloves?! Also, I found jad much easier for my first time w diamond e bolts, rcb, and crystal shield. Mechanics are most important tho. May take a couple tries. Keep at it.

Why can't they own themselves with a buyout? I don't get why the move was originally made to sell out at all. Do they need that capital from a big company or something?

most of OP's post history consists out of him defending ROT, realize this before upvoting this thread.
---
\&gt; We're a community that tries our best to lock down revs on the 2k worlds, which is in the spirit of the game because this is how pvp area's work.   
---
so you're doing the exact same thing as this guy, but in gear.
---
Spam clicking than stop spamming is even faster (on mobile at least). 1.5 tick I believe.
---
An upgrade to Magic Secateurs using the crystal shards described in the dev blog to make Crystal Secateurs would be more fitting. Then again, Fairytale quest line is unfinished and could be better implemented when that releases.
---
It's never actually more money though, the runs just become longer but the profit per run stays the same. Anyone voting yes thinking more patches = more money needs to think a little harder.
---
Do medium clues. They are easy and once you hit ranger boots that's 35m. Got a pair at 34 med clue count. Although, I'm Ironman btw so our rng is a little skewed.
---
Wow inferno is amazing! 
---
It could degrade based on damage received rather than hits? Would this work or would it be too hard to balance? ie. Would it be balanced for the inferno but basically non-degradable at DKs?
---
How does it break the combat triangle? Mage&gt;melee&gt;range&gt;mage, but mage armor is the only one of those three that doesn't have high defense of what it beats.
---
So many pures are assholes. Arguably they might have been made that way because other people are toxic to them (it's actually insane how toxic you can be in this game with 0 repercussions) but regardless, they give themselves a bad name. When I was training my alt the only people who crashed me were 1def pures. Now I have to say it's pretty fucking sweet to remorselessly mow down those pieces of shit - especially if they're 15cb  lower. They can suck my dick.

You do have the angler gloves though, right?

I'm laughing too hard make it stop

That‚Äôs the point. Just like runecraft, ranged doesn‚Äôt have the action either. 
---
Gz
---
Just from the passing knowledge I've gained from watching videos, they have exp daily limits, so you can only level up so much in one day, but the rest of your time can be used making money or pking.
---
But take this with a grain of salt 
---
I'm never buying a game made by EA ever again. If they actually did buy Jared id quit rs. 
---
Use your dragon tools while passively getting crystal shards and then for a bit of time have improved dragon tools.
---
Granted.

The poll results are now so hidden that not even jagex can find them.

Arma 3 best game ever

That would be useful

Bruh, the log in screen literally must be mirrored on the y axis, *that's* how fucky the engine is. If they won't even mess with that, the code must be ugly.

At this point, when someone says "shouldn't be too hard to implement" to a jmod, they must look like Vietnam vets having war flashbacks.

I'm telling you. This location is GROUNDBREAKING!

At the Bank Deposit Box, can the "Deposit loot" button also deposit Rune/Pure Essence from Pouches and Coal from the Coal bag?  
---
Also at the Bank Deposit Box, can the "Deposit worn items" button be hidden if we chose to hide it at the main bank interface?
---
RuneScape at its core just isn‚Äôt WoW. Well put. 
---
Only if it specifies hitpoints too

Add a % meter to the volume of the game. Even on 1 notch everything is extremely loud. Sometimes I'd like to hear the game sound without it over-powering anything else I'm listening to.

Welcome back, comrade.

I did this when I was 12
---
dude im so excited for the new settled episode!! ive been checking like twice a day lol. fiending for that good good
---
Your reply contradicts itself as soon as you say "but in gear".
---
That's the point, is we \*aren't\* doing the exact same thing as this guy.
---
1: We're in actual risk, which means enemies stand to gain something from killing us.
---
2: We're not purposely going out of our way to cause harassment to someone else through means of zero risk constant attacking. We are player killing, not player harassing. There's a difference between entering the wilderness with gear and attacking someone as opposed to spam returning with a crystal bow no food and losing absolutely nothing but bones for 12 hours attacking the same person who's an iron man trying to pvm.
---
What we're doing is forming an alliance amongst ourselves to lock down a pvp zone, and fight off enemies who try to take it from us. What he's doing is harassment because he has no intention of trying to take anything from us, has no real intent on 'player killing' us, and is simply just trying to be as much of a nuisance as possible.
---
You can in no way shape or form tell me that we're doing the exact same thing he's doing. By your logic, all clans are then essentially 1 item raggers and any turf you fight on is essentially player harassment.
---
And lastly, how am I defending RoT? you say this but where did I mention them once in my post? it sounds to me like you have issues with that clan and are looking to bring those to something that has nothing to do with the issue at hand.
---
The 2k cc is not RoT, and you're trying to defend someone who literally puts the words HARASSMENT in their stream/twitter and telling me I'm doing the same thing?
---
Try again...
---
Perfectly normal; I see runescape.com in the URL bar, and Chrome tells me it's Secure!
---
Yes! If they even have [the older ones](https://i.imgur.com/QRF2t9s.png) archived somewhere, I would absolutely love to see them too! The Hunter one was one of my favourites.
---
Lol
---
Nah bro, you got this. Before to face Jad on wave 62 switch to longrange. Fight Jad longrange and the healers can't reach him once you lure them.
---
Compare karils to green dhide for accuracy, youre just trying to bias results to push your agenda
---
Could try mage pray, anti-fires and blowpipe to be bit faster. 
---
What is the possibility that we can get  multiple login saves for mobile or desktop sometime this year? 
---
Of course this is elitistscape.... there wouldn't be any challenge or reason to max without it. He has the same tools available as everyone else to better his account. He can play how he wants, and I will judge. We are free to have opinions and mine is he is a cute noob...
---
I feel as if those crystal tools arent balanced properly lol. The boost for the harpoon seems large, while the wc axe seems tiny. And the way the pick works is odd but i dont know enough about the game to know if thats how upgrading from bronze-rune works. Dpick has always seemed lackluster to me for that reason, and as such so does the crystal pick. 
---
That was just damage control, really. All of his comments and tweets definitely had the tone that the table was overpowered and needed nerfed. Almost every single one of his arguments were over exaggerated (hyperbolic, as Paul called it) and based on the assumption that the rare drops were too common and random low level Slayer tasks we're WAY too profitable.
---
Warding
---
You'd probably end up at Experiments for a long time
---
Depends on how much time you have to play. Low level money making methods can earn up to around 500k/hour.
---
Sorry I missed the funny part of this? 
---
Back to zammy hasta :( got fed up with only being able to kill him at 4am to 6am.
---
I think it's hilarious that this one guy made a clan make a reddit post and cry to jmods about getting ragged and even play the "Think of the ironmemes"
---
Nice slayer helm 
---
See you all on runescape moments
---
This clip would be gold if you accidentally had def xp on and got 2 def
---
Did they nerf them again?
---
Why? This is the best part of the game. learning the shit the hard way. he has the same tools available as everyone else. He isn't using them though....
---
ouch, man. right in the feels. what a perfect game that can never happen again. 
---
scavenger + claymore + famas w/ red dot sight &lt;3 I love u R.I.P.
---
Sometimes if I play too many hours without breaks I dream I'm playing. This is my life. Yes it's sad. All that work even in my sleep for no real xp
---
I assume this to be a joke, but does *every* place in RS count as Gielinor? What about the Abyss? And islands like Entrana and Ape Atoll?
---
Just report it and move on. You don't have access to any information you need to be of any use to authorities. If they feel it's a credible threat, they will follow the necessary channels.

I *did*, however, use an iron skirt/mace with the tribal top and a black full helmet to look like a terrible Chinese ripoff Verac. 
---
Nice. They worth killing off task? I don't like fighting vorkath or zulrah.
---
No competition?
---
Sounds like you haven't been to 2k then, because enemy clans run through all the time.
---
We've fought Jaja, Rev, SV, CT, RoT at one point, and hundreds of random small groups. Locking something down does not equate to zero competition. I don't understand why you make a comment like this.
---
That just depends on if you're training for efficiency or just making money by rune crafting. If you just look at it as my way of making money is by doing this, then eventually you'll get to 99.
---
It's a credible threat that needs to be moved on immediately, not waiting for a sweaty service employee to read the report. This needs attention now.
---
This sounds like the plot of a South Park episode

Awesome just checking, was thinking of gaining exp for a pure like this

Me like runecraft. Is me bad? 
---
You are more likely to get lucky or unlucky, averaging out over time. Im sure you have some 200k+ packs coming soom
---
That's exactly what happened to me, logically I knew exactly what I was doing but just the anxiety made me all jittery and causing me to switch pray when I shouldn't. 
---
I'm wondering if maybe I should have my pointer on like a random pray so if I do panic click when I shouldn't it wont be a huge deal, but if I do need to switch pray would probably still have plenty of time to move the mouse and switch.
---
 Can we have stacked clue scroll reward caskets? It would be much more rewarding to have stacked clue reward caskets which you can open after you are done with clue hunting.
---
Dumbest comment.
---
and you don't have to continue to spam click the entire time only for a second or two to get the quicker harvest speed

Dude wtf thats so imbalenced wtf ive grinded more lvls than this guy im went 20-47 agility and fking only have 32 token dude fkin srs wtf this guy only get 10 levels and than he get 927 mark tokens??srs dude did you pay jmods in cash dude ur hacker how u get more then me in less times dude srs only 10 lvls im doing 27 and get 32 wtf where is fair trainin im pissd fking piece of shit jegex tryn to scam my token im try all week to get that white clothin my cousin talk bout but no mothafuking 10 levels now u have like 5 sets how bout u share som shit dude tryn to struggle and shit is rigged fk off

Imo it should be 1 day exactly, or a little less  so at least you can do it on a routine

They give absolutely massive experience. They are not overrated in the slightest.

fking fuck my ass im tired of rock throwin apes tryn to steel my fucking food dude fuk off 
---
Everyone favorite RuneScape noob ‚ÄúShittyBill‚Äù is about to add you also. I need to know how to get from 30-40 farming for this quest without losing my mind at how slow farming training is. Pls help, I‚Äôm here to kill monsters and quest but I guess I need to grow some bullshit too. Planting acorns has been decent xp and pretty cheap so far, is there a better option? 
---
Is he the dad of Joey Joe Joe Shabadoo Jr?
---
Hey dude jokes on them, bet you enjoy the game far more than they do, fuck us elitist nerds and our depression, making fun of the noobs cuz everything else in our life is falling apart around us, you do you my little noob friend.
---
You look like shit either way 
---
Exp rewards are not the way to go
---
The skill in this game comes from everything at maximum efficiency and as perfect as possible whenever possible.  I can imagine if I was as efficient as I possibly could be then my account would be twice as developed as it is now.
---
Fking tryng to relax but flute salad comes on and im fking pullin my weenr tryn to think of tossin the salad on my bich but fuck off flute salad dude song is stupid ass trash shit
---
it happens with every herb, the price of the seed will adjust to the new average expected value of the harvest, more patches just mean the expected value goes up, which means the seed price rises to match this. In the end this means that the entire herb run will still give the same profit it always did, it's just that now it takes longer to complete.
---
F
---
Tired of you silly kids. Runescape wasn't even created until after I got out if the Army. You kids had too much tech, and didn't grow up learning about outside and people.
---
Complains rs3 ezscape, now complains outdatedscape hard
---
I remember a Runescape before Zulrah and Vorkath. Better times.
---
Dude's dick is so big it paralyzed him.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to these people, you‚Äôre doing the right thing and you‚Äôre 100% right. Chances are it is a terrible joke, but if it‚Äôs not, there will be an awful lot of people who are very thankful you brought it to light when you did.
---
I'm assuming you meant to respond to oztwerk about spam clicking. Just so you know you don't have to spam the entire time only for a second or two to get the sped up harvesting.
---
It's a runelite plugin which can hide entities (e.g player models, npc models etc.)
---
If you don't use runelite and are planning to, only download it from runelite.net , others are all phishing/viruses
---
Konar is meant to be an addition hassle/challenge for more reward. You just want a straight buff
---
KORASIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 
---
Thanks. I have a feeling this will be an unpopular opinion though due to people just want to see HCs die and they don‚Äôt want more safe content for them. 
---
discount lil peep
---
Bro dust devils in smoke dungeon are already good money.
---
Read this as ‚ÄúOmelette within‚Äù at first because I didn‚Äôt realize how ridiculously omelette is spelled. Needless to say, I was very confused
---
Mining and fishing can make decent profit at higher levels, while woodcutting never makes much money. Blast furnace and herb runs are good ways of earning profit at low levels.
---
If i wanted dump i go to bathroom so my toilet can taste my fkin vengance fking rat fk pice of shitass
---
I did deaths because that was what I craved while doing this skill :)
---
Lord 
---
The point of the game mode is to survive as long as you can and achieve as much as possible while doing so.
---
Having the gauntlet be safe means it is essentially a worthless achievement. If you want the HC status to actually mean something you would want more unsafe content, no?
---
This is a good point
---
Can we have Double quantity setting? Where you can set different quantities for different items at the same time. For example: 3 for giant seaweed and 18 for bucket of sand so you only click once on both to get the correct amount. 
---
Sounds like the physical embodiment of the guy from J1mmy's mobile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO9zuri6Hsk

Amen brother.

They did revitalize the ammo

How many people would be able to wear it? 20?

Eternal body runes kappa 
---
You say this like we don't need more cute Anime girls in osrs Mr Gower
---
I'd like to see more Crystal Equipment. 
---
Like a Crystal fishing rod, hammer, chisel, ect.
---
Idk what you could combine them with though, since there are no dragon versions of those tool
---
Maybe in a special area just for fun, otherwise no
---
Imo its purely because of the internet. Knowledge is at your fingertips and the competitive parts like streaming etc cause people to want to do things the fastest/most productive way. Its not just rs, this has happened with many games and other areas in general
---
You'll be fine.  I have much lower stats and I can do fine in fights in the 100-110 bracket even though I'm only 101 combat.
---
Old copypasta or?
---
its a loss if you're efficient.
---
otherwise depends on a huge number of factors. task rng, luck with drops, whether you do things like Cerb over hellhounds, KQ over kalphites, etc.
---
theres no real answer because nobody really does for-profit slayer at those levels.
---
Well time zone is a bitch, will buy today
---
Older content people actually care about. Duh.
---
They are safe. Zulrah is only safe with an achievement diary, yes it‚Äôs OP. But that‚Äôs been in the game for how long now? COX and Inferno have so many different mechanics and ways to die that I feel like they‚Äôre justified to be safe. I‚Äôm sure a large part of the community would be fine with TOB being safe as well, but it wasn‚Äôt released that way and it was well known from the beginning that a death would negatively effect everyone. So there‚Äôs no going back on that one. 
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you on it being an achievement or not, I just don‚Äôt see a reason as to why it‚Äôs not going to cost people with nothing to lose anything. If they charge an entrance fee or a death fee, 100% keep it as it is. But if you can just walk in, die and say ya don‚Äôt pray that next time and then walk straight back in? Then it needs to changed. Make a negative aspect for ALL accounts so it‚Äôs an achievement for ALL accounts.

Crack the clue part 2?

It‚Äôs a HCIM and he wants to know who dies first, him or the ironman.

I have notification set at 2k. It helps for things like seeds/key halves etc
---
It's actually the opposite. The name Ironman comes from the eponymous Marvel superhero, due to the nature of said accounts being that you start with a huge amount of wealth so as to perform 'heroic' feats like fastest to 99 construction with demonic thrones. You must be thinking of Deadman Mode, where you can't interact with other players because you're "dead" to the world.
---
I really appreciate so much about this. The only thing I really want to see changed is that the crystal equipment should also consume the dragon skilling equipment. The kraken tentacle does a great job at maintaining a lower supply, and thus higher cost to the abyssal whip, while something like the dragon axe, which is the best axe in the game, is in a really bad spot for price. If they get consumed, we can at least start with getting rid of dragon axes.
---
Qol is about the interface. It's an accepted meaning of it everywhere. You're not being clever by rationalizing its intent to your wishes.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Yeah, I was so confused
---
yea no 1971659/((82/7)*15) = about 11.2k xp per hour

If you're getting that shitty of xp rates at 65+ rc that's your own fault not the game

Tithe farm is not well desgined in general imo

No

Ahhh i assumed it had something to do with the parked cars (their plates) couldnt find the pun.

Anything is OK if you get a drop on the first kill :D
---
Maybe a drop-down list/table of all the items you're currently at the maximum for, when they will each be reset, and the same information when you go to put a buy offer in for that item.

Aw. Sometimes I go to the ge and find someone like you and I'm like hello, do you accept your f2p clue scroll? Then if they do I make them fish trout and kill a hill giant unarmed then pick a banana from karamja and give them god rune armor or something. It's so funny when the lil noobs see 200k in the trade window and then I actually accept. Kinda a flex I guess but a nicer one.

Get some friends and do some raids, use YouTube guides for each room.

1t prayer flicking and flicking multi enemies that use different attack styles and moving you character around is highest form of combat in osrs.

This exact thing is what led to the eoc (hence the name). The mechanics are limited with this, but the community likes things the way that they are.

That would be pretty fucked up for ironman accounts.

Infinite teleports to taverley dungeon entrance

Well, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this. I don't see how saying Capes of Accomplishment are their own thing disqualifies them any more than the Champion's Cape that is also its own thing. Raids Capes have tiers, but that doesn't mean players wouldn't want them on the Max Cape too or that they couldn't be added if we add other cosmetic capes.
---
And saying "otherwise never even taken out of the bank for anything other than bank standing" feels like it misses the point of a cosmetic cape. If you did merge a Champion's Cape with a Max Cape, under the current rules it would mean you'd get a cape with no stats and perks because the max Cape inherits the stats and abilities of the cape it copies. And I completely disagree that you have a "right" to merge two items to show both off at once. Should we also merge Castle Wars Gold Armor with other outfits because you want to show it off during more than just bank standing?
---
Yeah it should definitely have some sort of risk for regular people accounts too
---
watched 3 random videos of his
---
i was not disappointed
---
Maybe one day challenge raids 2 comes out and drops an ornament kit. Oh boy that would be sweet
---
I like all these. To add one to the list maybe an auto correct option? I rarely type in game due to the same reason you listed above but also because I mistype almost every word and I just give up after a while.
---
Technically, I think he got it at 98 since the level up message came up afterwards... But the experience is awarded upon checking health or harvesting. So actually technically 99, it just showed the message afterward
---
yeah i mean i personally do not believe that the 3 prongs of the combat triangle need to exist in perfect parity. if you really really want that, you probably have been disappointed in literally all of runescape though, dungeoneering or otherwise. i think as long as they all have a reasonable place it's fine even if they're not equal.
---

i mean it's already got the set effect of having absurdly high range def lmao, i don't think it needs a buff in any capacity really.

Have you tried sugon?
---
Cool...
---
According to the Wiki she can. 
---
nope. pickaxe has no impact on success rate so you can use a cheap one and graceful just drops on hte ground below 20 wildy. you can also tele to the abyss even if tb'd so you don't need to worry about that. it's only in like level 4 so you can just leg it in a few seconds.
---
technically speaking, an item called the abyssal bracelet does exist which prevents you from skulling upon entering the abyss. this would make it so you wouldn't even lose your glory, but considering the cost of bracelets, the cost of glories, and how often you'll die (basically never), they're not even worth using.
---
all suck

Only if that bar at Barrows sells Moonlight Mead so Settled can farm his sets easier.

if you're doing a &lt;37 pray run probably suffering, if you've got protection prayers then probably ring of the gods (i). if you're confident your flicks are pretty perfect then you could fuck the ring of the gods and go suffering either way.
---
As a near max, and an owner of a champion's cape, I for one would absolutely love it if instead of being a cosmetic upgrade to a bis combat cape, the champion's cape was a cosmetic upgrade to the max.
---
Keep the stats and perks of max cape, but reskin it to champ's, and I'll find it even more satisfying to have a max cape in my inv instead of a con cape.
---
I fucking hate that area lets farm instead
---
Excellent.
---
also worth remarking that if you npc contact duradel, you can cancel your task at any master. so if you get a duradel task you'd like to cancel, just slayer ring to nieve, cancel, and then npc contact duradel again. you don't actually ever have to go to him.

these are not the fastest exp in the game and they're honestly not super close, darts are significantly faster. they're good don't get me wrong but they don't compare to darts.

They design certain content around prayer flicking so I'm fairly certain they support it and consider it a legitimate tactic.
---
Super intelligent comment bro. 
---
...?? You make no sense with that one. So hes using d long and a fury that means he has no game knowledge whatsoever and proves he doesnt have a lack of time? How is that even a thing? Fury is BiS for him and d long is BiS too..i dont think you even understand what I'm saying. The gear he is lacking are locked behind time consuming activities or quests.

---
every 50 QP
---
There is already 6, I think that‚Äôs more than enough.
---
&gt;So what do you call Iron Armor? It completely makes Bronze obsolete.
---
Having a natural progression of items is not obsoleting existing content, most notably because Bronze and Iron have been around forever.
---
That being said, having three tiers of meta with requirements at or below level 5 is indeed pretty silly, and if you were redesigning the system from scratch that's not how it would be set up. Iron does, for the most part, obsolete Bronze. 
---
&gt;What about leveling your skills? Should we do away with that too? When was the last time you chopped a basic tree on purpose?
---
What the hell are you even talking about? 
---
&gt;Games - and MMOs especially - need a sense of progression. You can‚Äôt stay in the same stuff you started with forever. Eventually you level up, and that happens with locations too.
---
It shouldn't happen with locations, and in good sandbox MMORPGs it doesn't happen with locations. It's never historically happened with OSRS, and it shouldn't. Having strong consistent community hubs is what makes the game so good.
---
&gt;One of the best MMOs around, Guild Wars 2, has zones of different level targets, stronger armor, different masteries and level rewards, and much much more that allows you to progress. Why would I go to a level 10 zone to level when a level 80 one is available to me?
---
And this is exactly the opposite of the design philosophy that Runescape has always had. Runescape does not have a level 1-10 zone and a level 10-15 zone and a level 15-20 zone etc. That's bad game design. It renders huge portions of the world empty and useless for the vast majority of players. 
---
&gt;Similarly, why should an area like Prifddinas, locked behind a long and challenging line of quests not offer advantages over a city anyone could walk into?
---
Nobody is saying there shouldn't be reasons to go there, but that it should not just be strictly better in every way. Places in RuneScape tend to be there for some sort of reason. Maybe Prifddinas could be somewhere that you go if you want to do some sort of activity that you can do to train both ranged and agility at the same time, much like you can train fishing and agility and strength at the same time with Barbarian fishing.
---
Maybe Prifddinas, as a city, has a few of these different reasons to go there. 
---
But it should not be like RS3, where it has a GE and essentially replaces the existing cities as hubs. That just leaves the world feeling empty, and any players still around end up all being low level players.
---
A bit part of the motivation a lot of us had to become high levelled in the first place is seeing that awesome looking guy walk past with his Dragon Chainbody and Dragon Medium Helm, his whip and his Obsidian Cloak, etc. Or that guy with that awesome new animated lava cloak, etc. (This was a long time ago for me, obviously). 
---
When you move all the high level players into their own replacement for Varrock, you aren't really creating anything new anyway. It's just a reskinned high level Varrock in another spot. It doesn't feel unique, it feels like somewhere that they've shoved everyone anyone could want within arm's reach. That's not a good thing.
---
&gt;If you‚Äôre denying that games should offer progression then I really don‚Äôt know what to say at this point, tbh.
---
Nobody is saying there shouldn't be progression, but too much vertical progression and not enough horizontal progression leaves you in a situation where you just replace things with higher levelled things with slightly bigger numbers on them.
---
That's why Barrows, for example, degrades. Barrows armour was very clearly designed so that it would only be situationally more useful than the existing armour, to avoid obsoleting existing content and devaluing existing items. You got these cool new more powerful armour sets, but they degrade, so you only use them in situations where you make enough money and save enough time to be worth the additional cost, or where the cost is worth the unique effect.
---
Vertical progression works well early in the game, but when you get into the higher level areas of the game, OSRS is clearly keeping with the RS2 design of having more options, not just some strictly more powerful options. They haven't done this perfectly, but it's way better than RS3 where they have strictly better options all the way up into what, the mid 90s in levels?
---
Oh ok, I thought it would be a QoL update which would benefit skillers more than people doing bosses/getting resources from other activities.

Honestly, I don't mind bonds as they don't introduce anything into the game, they just facilitate the movement of wealth and allow people to buy membership using their in-game gold and don't actually introduce anything into the game other than membership. Buyable exp, buyable cash and items (squeal of fortune) on the other hand are retarded and are actually harmful for the game.

Its really not an issue if you have a couple block slots. I think this issue is coming up more so because konar gives more undesirable tasks, but thats the whole point.
---
Yes, ESPECIALLY a pure with inf cape is way ahead of anywhere a maxed account will be simply because of how utterly few have one. The game is filled with max capes, way more than there exists inferna capes i believe.

Finally the top 10% is a very loose quantile because it really isnt hard to work yourself past the average casual players.

im pretty sure i will use stamina every single run, but is it enough ?, like would my level + stam matches the rate  which my energy depletes ?

I‚Äôm okay with it, but only if it‚Äôs just cosmetic. I don‚Äôt want it to get any stats or bonuses. I think that was the consensus last time this was suggested 
---
nice
---
I see your point, but as said, shift click is good enough 
---
Vorkath is piss easy. Zulrah is piss easy. Hydra is piss easy. Cerb is piss easy. GWD bosses other than k‚Äôril sometimes are piss easy. Jad on a mid level would be somewhere between Zulrah and K‚Äôril which are both much easier than raids and zuk. I think you just didn‚Äôt read my comment before downvoting me. Almost no bosses in OSRS are hard, your final sentence there is pretty trivial.

A few videos on youtube show it but id say on par with motherlode mine but zmi altar xp rates.

You're fucked.

I don't think the community in itself actually voted on whether or not to keep flicking in the game, so I don't think that statement is really backed by any true statistics

Haha my son, try having to right click and then select drop like it use to be :).

Full ass supprot dude now i can fianlly afk in pice at the resorce area without some stupiddy head salad rober come and freese me im wearin full blak dhide but nope water stick salad man freese me with just one ice block and i loose my fucking moneis and dank crabs like wtf homi im here tryn to struggle and fk boi lookin green jus freese me so fast no time to react so this benefit me i can now pot dank crabs by myself with no worry of water stick man come try and take crebs dude srsly thanks now im excite to fully fish crab to lvls high and get more crabs no worry of getting specc out by gmailer in invisible robe with his salad friends so fking stupid dude leave me alone fishin crab fk off
---
mining is slow but it‚Äôs so easy and afk, I used to do it while doing homework and I passively got to 85 or something, it was enough for any quest or diary req. rc is way more awful. even agility, which sucks too, at least is simple. it‚Äôs really the having to bank, deposit everything, withdraw ess, pouch it, withdraw more... that gets so damn tedious
---
You scared it away
---
Actually yeah
---
Are we talking about a dueling arena fight, or wildy risk? Either way not really a fan as you will just see people fighting each other all over the place. And if you going to suggest only allow it in certain areas, we already have that its called the duel arena. It would take a lot of dev time to make sure its not buggy

Thanks for your feedback. When specifically balancing the Bow, I chose the stats that I did because it would put it above the imbued Magic Short Bow in terms of DPS, but below the Blowpipe with Dragon Darts. However, it would still have the unique property of having extremely long range (10 tiles). So you'd get a truly unique weapon that doesn't actually increase the DPS of range overall (Blowpipe is still more raw dps), but fills a unique niche for wanting Long Range equipment that is capable of doing decent DPS (equivalent ranged strength of Mithril Bolts, shot at Shortbow Speed), while maintaining incredible accuracy (+100 for a fully charged bow).
---
I do the same but telegrab em for maximum yoink
---
No one is going to go for that, as dwh is a prized item. I support adding a better non-spec medium level 1h crush weapon, although its not really necessary, and shouldnt come from konar.
---
The staking aspect of it is kind of covered by the duel arena anyways, I believe the only important aspect is the aformentioned asskicking.
---
Now is Vorkath considered high or low defense? I know his Def level is fairly high but his defense bonus is only +20 against Ranged/Stab
---
I agree konar could have a very rare and valuable drop but idk if dwh is the right thing to give to her droptable. Also z hasta is very good crush weapon and it's 1handed 
---
Congrats :)
---
When is rc difficult?
---
Yeah...looking forward to it
---
you can buy gold with bonds u retard
---
no one said what the nerf would be, and yes it will probly give negative melee stats.
---
I was thinking no risk, soft fights where nothing is lost on death but someone is sent back to their spawnpoint. Staking is redundant with the duel arena but the actual dueling part was something I really liked in RSC.
---
Lol 
---
Scim isn't called "(t)" though, you might have gotten confused
---
Never been proven. People say this because of the balance sheet showing lots of mtx sales but ignore that it involves osrs bonds too
---
At first glance, I thought 'meh, just a collage of random shit.' However, after actually looking at this, I sharply exhaled through my nose a few times. This is a masterpiece
---
The problem is: person who gets the drop leaves without looting chest.  The loot goes into the chest by the bank but the team can not see what the loot is then since it is not inside the raid anymore.
---
I guess you could have it announce the loot if the player logs off or leaves the raid but idk if that's possible as they didn't do that for TOB.
---
Thx! :D

People saying you‚Äôll never get a normal job with face or hand tattoos are stupid. You might not get a job working in retail or fast food because you‚Äôre the face of the company - but those jobs suck anyway. Welders, Pipe fitters, skilled tradesmen of all kinds wouldn‚Äôt have any issue with these types of tattoos. Not to mention that tattoos are becoming more and more acceptable, especially in the workplace. I don‚Äôt have any face or hand tattoos but my arms are covered and I simply wouldn‚Äôt want to work for somebody who judged me based on that. Judge me based on my merit and my hard work rather than the stories and experiences I carry on my skin.

Technically the gp/hr on buying magic seeds or palm seeds off GE and making them into saplings to then sell on GE is also at those numbers, but there you're limited by the buy limit and also need a lot of start-up capital. Spamming medium clues from eclectics is also over 2.5m gp/hr, although that requires you to be *very* efficient at doing clues and have a lot of teles unlocked.

You'd need to buy hundreds if not thousands of bonds to reach that level of wealth, I doubt OP has that kind of money. Besides, he basically already admitted to using rwt. "U retard"

It is well thought out, but I'm just saying that range is already the best thing to use almost everywhere. There isnt a need to make it even better for lower levels. Let range at least be as slow as it is now until you get to bp imo

Nice name!

Don't limit this design to having champions cape as a prerequisite, just make max capes customizable

I have this exact same argument for Rainbow Six Siege. I want the old Operation screens back...

The longer you look at it, the better it gets.

Frankly I‚Äôm not a fan of the gauntlet or crystal armour. The defence stats on that crystal armour is well beyond Torag which is arguably the ‚Äútank‚Äù set. I don‚Äôt want another bis armour set.
---
Bonds are slightly higher than that I believe, 3.3-3.5

There is a new slayer master Konar, she's pretty shat. She asks you to go to specfic areas to complete tasks, and as a reward as access to a drop table which isn't quite worth it.

Sawmill has been asked.

This is just an easier way to get your construction up for those who work on woodcutting their logs, running to the saw, and going to their house, without ever asking for a butler or swapping out notes.

‚ÄúShat‚Äù nah fam, i use nieve, and konar is 100% better than her.

The phising site actually an ad, I assume he has adblock on his main browser and not on ie

Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8
---
That's a fair conservative argument, I would combat that with the following:
---
This item should be balanced so that it does not trump best melee xp/hr(nmz) 
---
This item should be balanced so it does not trump current best Slayer xp/hr(blowpipe range pots) 
---
This item would likely cost top dollar making hydras actually worth doing as a 95 Slayer req monater
---
Would you be more interested of it were degradable costing some type of "Hydra scales" to be replenished? Making it as expensive to use as the blowpupe? 
---

Always wanted a fire cape since i played back in 06, wish me luck :D

don't think you understood what he meant
---
More herb patches = more herbs coming into the game = cheaper herblore training for mains
---
Fucking feels like it. Doesn't it?
---
I would love a herb patch there but remove one of the others maybe? I honestly don't see a problem in an additional herb patch. I only do 5-6 patches because I usually don't have the herb seeds to spare.
---
Yes
---
Lmfao, were you farming guams or something? It took me all of 2, maybe 2 and a half months of doing 3x4 herb patches a day to get past 65 so I think you're either exaggerating like crazy or not remembering it right.
---
It influences peoples choices. 
---
Not necessarily, you can just make it reward some degree of profit. If it's a pvm activity that rewards 300k-1m gp depending on your level, then it'd be done. The reason multiplayer minigames aren't usually played is because almost non provide any actual gp profit.

Ehhh youre kind of dancing around my point. It seems like you want it to be bis something. (Possibly melee slayer?) I dont think its necessary, considering lance is really good for a number of things already

nice morparscape noob

The hard part is bringing yourself to do it 
---
Yeah mate, ya ever block hellhounds so you don't get a shit task?
---
Look, I do Konar, it's shat. Other people have done Konar, and returned to Nieve and Duradel because it's shat. Is it a cool idea? Yeah for sure. It was nerfed so hard that you barely hit the table during a task anymore.
---
Looks close to 1/40 but I've only got one sample so I may be way off! 
---
Firemaking by far
---
You forgot kourend and nieves combined grand exchange slayer catacombs 
---
Quality concept
---
At this point you have too much spare time :)
---
I agree. Its more the MTX that killed the game not EoC. I understand that EoC pretty much changed everything how the game is played combat wise, and the mechanics that work in OSRS dont work there anymore. But for those who just want some casual MMO, "click to kill" play style its still there. I dont know when, but they added a combat style called the Revolution. Basically you add the abilities you want to the ability bar and the game "fires" them automatically in the order you placed them (Spell 1, Spell 2, Spell 3 etc.) Making rs3 still a casual "Click To Kill" game. Just more enterrntaining to watch maybe. I personally think Rs3 looks pretty good. But since they made everything much easier than back in the day, it made things very unfair for veteran players who had to do "the grind" back in the day and now its basically possible to max using only MTX.
---
Bomb ea.
---
Make bosses which are immune to combat styles - use range? 0 damage.
---
Ok noted might make another one replacing veracs with Torags 
---
I thought song of the elves was the elf city quest? Or do you mean one that starts there 
---
We'll yea, bis mellee Slayer, it's fitting as the tail is dropped by the highest Slayer req'd monsters in the game. The dilemma currently is that the hydras(boss variant and non-boss variant drop a useless item that is only worth it's high alch price. Regular hydras are disappointing the boss is fine. Currently the bis "Slayer" item is dropped by cave horrors and that's the black mask at 52 Slayer. I feel like it's unexeptable to have a useless unique tied to a req 95 Slayer monster

As a kid I viewed 70's for combat skills were too hard to all achieve(LOL) and just stuck to doing a few quests here and there and mainly role-playing as a bed and breakfast owner in Varrock despite wanting that sweet sweet equipment. People were so chill and I had rotating menus. Shit was siqq.

It‚Äôs elven lands with no farming patches at all except for the fruit tree patch in Lletya. How about adding some new plants that aren‚Äôt herbs... There‚Äôs so much opportunity to make cool new farming stuff that could only be grown in this area. (Idk nee special patch for crystal tree???)

Heck even a Celastrus patch would seem fitting.

I definitely think harvesting should be faster. Seaweed, snapegrass, berries and herbs take ages now. I know you can spam click but it would be nice if they changed the base speed.

The sad reality is that new rooms would probably never pass because short raids = best points/hr.

So black chins are more expensive. You are giving an argument against them not for them.

These should be unlockable. Complete inferno, raids, ds2, etc

Yeah should be like a crystal tree patch that gives crystal shards when you chop it, adds another skilling way to get those shards and it's a new patch and new seed. Maybe the seed can only be dropped by elves and monsters in and around elf area or something.

I'm just a normie with a couple tattoos but I think it's pretty cool that face tattoos are becoming more widely seen/accepted. I want to have so many tattoos and some of my tattoo dreams involve my face and hands and the idea of tattooing my lower legs/feet and ribs give me some extreme anxiety compared to face/hand tattoos not giving me that anxiety, why care what order/where you ink your body up?
---
Granted I do think if you're gonna get face tattoos you should really think those ones over, they're the ones that will get the most comments from other people due to there visibility.

Thanks for the info man! Hope to see you out there soon!

just make everything herb/farming patches

It's pretty good wildy tank armour. No negative range defence so the chestplate plus dhide chaps would give massive ranged defence and decent mage defence.
---
That's how most wildy bosses are. I think KBD is the only boss I can do during the day
---
How many contracts have you completed?
---
Implying
---
Big yes fuck runecrafting
---
I think Wintertodt is a ton of fun. Cool loots, insanely good exp giving also Woodcutting (cutting logs), Construction (fix braizer) and optional if you want to Fletch logs (gives double points, you get a loot roll at 500/750/1k points) and every 250 there after

Wtf all these years i thought it was runecrafting...im shook

Okay srry my man i jumped the gun then.

&gt; like 2500 brew drop
---
And as far as we can tell, it dropped once until they hotfixed it. They don‚Äôt like to officially release everything because it‚Äôs nice for players to figure out on their own. 
---
&gt; Just the major ones 
---
What defines a major drop? The 2500 brew drop could have been considered not major because it had such a rare drop rate, who knows. This community is almost never in a good state of ‚Äúthis is balanced well‚Äù, it‚Äôs almost always ‚Äúthis is OP‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is dead content‚Äù so imagine that on a larger scale trying to balance a drop table. ‚ÄúOmg this is so OP‚Äù so they balance it down and then ‚Äúomg its dead content‚Äù In most cases, launch drop tables are near good and then are nearly perfected within a few hours as people get to experience the new boss and see what it drops.
---
Inferno would have definitely passed a poll because people are craving challenge in a game where most content takes very little skill. That‚Äôs why Ironman mode, including HC, is nearly half the playerbase. It‚Äôs a challenge. The hardest thing outside of Inferno currently is probably ToB, and before that maybe Solo raids 1. I don‚Äôt think we should know the ins and outs of everything before we vote on it because we are simply people who play the game in our free time. We aren‚Äôt all Game balance devs who have access to the behind scenes information Jagex has that informs them what drops would be good to have and what drops would ruin the market.
---
And to think that a mortal got 200m...
---
Mortal, he was not
---
I mean, it‚Äôs really inventory waste to bring it to EVERY slay task... just check the drop table real quick first

Ah right cool. Just when you said ‚Äúthrow a bone‚Äù I thought you may not be aware.

I mean, Zulrah is essentially not dangerous for normal accounts because all you have to do is run back and collect your stuff for free. This mainly seems like a blog/poll to collect interest on the content but I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to make it ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù for normal accounts outside of making them pay 100k, which is kinda repetitive.
---
10 mill for 70 hours of agility, very cool, that's about 140k profit per hour!
---
In the last Q&amp;A weren't the team discussing the possibility of changing how high defence armour works with ranged weaponry?
---
The crystal armour offering 0 negative offensive bonuses looks like it could be problematic, you could have high dps and huge defensive bonuses under the right circumstances.
---
:3
---
You should def get your range up to 75 and use bp, took me 70 minutes the first try and doesn't feel that bad should you fail, compared to 1h and 45 min.

I also saw your other comment regarding the wrong pray flick, what I do is have one prayer up and hover the mouse over the other, so I have plenty of time to realize what attack he's making and change or keep prayer.

You should be dusting your pc once a month. Also if you are gonna go that route get two box fans at walmart for about 10 bucks each, then frame your pc up having the air flow through the frame where your pc is.

You move gallons of air right through it, just it get's dustier faster.

I'm also not sure what you are doing that is causing it to over heat, unless it's a really lore processing speed, and just constantly stressing it. Integrated graphics I would assume. Looks like a stock inspiron case from like 2012

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm putting it behind an extremely high level req. the skills needed outweigh the perk, I just think after the hardest challenges would we deserve a little something more.

See thing actually happened to me. Did my first kq kill on task and got a d chain right of the bat. I would've rather taken the pet home but ah well.

A recent one? If so I'll delete this quicker than you can day Prifddinas
---
Could we add an npc similar to the tool leprechaun to slayer hotspots that hold important items like the rock hammer since it is a real pain when you forget them? 
---
Ex. One on first floor of slayer tower etc
---
To be fair zulrah isnt really a minigame, if nmz is a safe death minigame then this should too, IMO. I'll never play hcim so doesn't really matter for me anyway, just my opinion
---
Man know nuttin' bout no BBC
---
I fell for this, as well as the rock hammer gmaul when I was 10 :/

Definitely fm, even with wintertodt. I‚Äôm pretty sure burning redwoods thought is the fastest fm xp in the game?

Please remake the Clan Wars Turrets map so it more closely resembles the one from pre-eoc. Currently the one in the game does not have the same pathing around obstacles essentially making it a completely different map. Mod's Curse and Ry have been developing it in their own time in 2018.

that's a pretty large oof right there my friend.

General idea is reasonable, but you‚Äôre underestimating how big of a deal attack speed is.

The fire rate alone would increase the crystal bow‚Äôs dps by 33%, and would stack multiplicatively with any range str and damage bonuses.

im not trying to down play it in pvp at all mate learn to read this is talking about a use for it in pve i dont see people walking around with horns or exposed bone in pvp??? this is talking about giving it another use so a lvl 90 slayer drop isnt worth 700k because it only has a use for pvp 
---
You can make profit from doing certain dragon bolts. Around Christmas I would do emerald dragon bolts or Ruby dragon bolts. Made 10k emeralds for a profit of 2.6m. This is buying the CUT gem, unf bolts, feathers and runes.
---
The community is already split up enough as it is. Adding more worlds is just gonna kill Pking more than PvP worlds did when they came out.

We wouldn't have any problems right now if we never got PvP and BH worlds. People would just use W318 for UK and W319 for USA in Wildy.

It‚Äôs one of many drops that slayer has to offer. By your logic, a whip should be less than a dark bow because the slayer level is slightly higher on one rather than the other. Drop rate and the practical use of the item do matter. 
---
Addy plates are not efficient, so why ecen mention them?

This is very high effort.

---
I've not had many issues with the boss *itself*, but every 5 kills or so I keep getting run down by teams of dudes that have AGS and claws and ballistas and stuff. 
---
I don't have too much experience with PvP, so is there anything I can do to try and escape from these guys? I've usually just been instantly teleblocked and specced out, and it's a bit hard to keep track of what multiple people are switching to.

Osrs wiki says making steel bars at blast furnace is 418k gp/hr. But  that's for pc, lets say its only 350k gp/hr for mobile. That's still 92k gp/hr still missing.
---
It takes 32 farming to plant ranarr seeds. Op would probably only have access to 4 herb patches. Right now ranarr seeds are 47.7k. If op gets 7 herbs/patch, thats like 24k profit (assuming none dies). Ranarrs take 80 minutes to grow, so lets just say 60 minutes (1 hour). He does it once every time he logs on, so his total gp/hr is now 374k gp/hr. 
---
THATS assuming he does everything pretty efficiently within his 1 hour of game play. And also assuming he has enough captial to do 1 hour of blast furnace and 4 ranarr seeds + 4 ultra compost. You will also need money for coffers and staminas. You can skip the staminas, but that means lower gp/hr. Also, OP doesn't have weight reducing gear, so staminas are pretty much mandatory.
---
Ahhh you actived my trap card. If it doesn't replace anything, it will be dead content guaranteed. Maybe not right away, but it will die (imo). 
---
What youre proposing sounds a lot like cox. So a med lvl raids with no crazy bis drops. I doubt anyone would do raids if it was 1m/hr and had no rare drops. Thoughts?
---
Not everything is good in pve/pvp at the same time. The dark bow is fine the way it is. 
---
Holy hell, 5 man Slayer take bossing must be so OP
---
Its not a boss its a boring AF mini game. I never said it wasnt well designed. Its just boring and its DEFINITELY not a boss.
---
Why would you understand 10 but not 9?
---
Lol, join the conversation.
---
Honestly the only real items to make an impact that is worthwhile is %bonus like slayer helmet, salve,arclight ect. Otherwise poverty gear and bis there is only a small difference.
---
I got just a coif before but 7 firelighters cost less I guess.
---
&gt;and businesses
---
Because 9 becomes before 10.

Yeah, it was definitely one of the best back in the early days. I logged in recently to see what has changed, and holy hell there is so much bloat. You can get to level 5000 in a day or two now with the new quests.

googled it, read the entire thing. i can never play runescape the same again witht he thought that there is somebody or something stuck there that just wants to play the game but can't.. damn
---
I got 750 snape grass last run.
---
and im not saying change it at all im just saying maybe give it a sink like the whips that give it more of a use in pve ur im not talking about changing anything with the darkbow im talking give it an upgrade item that makes it more practical in pve 
---
Can anyone tell me how nightmare zone works? Ive looked it up on a lot of sites but the information is a bit sketch...
---
Do you get more points per boss based off of your total quest points, or how many active bosses you have in that run? I see people talking about 1.2m poinst per hour and what not, yet i cant even fathom how thats done. I have a total of 8 avalible bosses i can take into nightmare zone, yet i get absolutely no points at all...
---
And is there any information on how the points scale per boss enemy? example : at X bosses, count draynor gives 500 points. at X bosses, count draynor gives 1200 points, ect.
---
Seems kinda backwards. You get 92 prayer so you can collect massive amounts of bones and sell them to people who want to get 92 prayer so they can bank bones. Prices will plummet, especially considering how fast and far a bone goes these days

you're consistently harassing people until they leave the 2k total worlds or pay you to continue using them, it's the definition of extortion.
---
just because you're in salads and dhides risking 15k doesn't make it any different.

Imagine using snipping tool at all.

Yes.

Not entire certain, But I would guess that you get 1 roll for the Konar drop table in addition to the normal drops.

It's been proven to cause issues with polling since people are more inclined to vote for whatever the winning side may be, even if they don't necessary agree with it. 
---
Same reasons most polling results are hidden IRL until after the fact. 
---
Oh I have all of those already, when I said I don‚Äôt have a big bank I meant in movable gp. (I know technically it‚Äôs better to not have a lot of gear you‚Äôre not using... but what if someone asks me to do KBD and I wanna melee and I JUST got rid of my hasta? Lol) 
---
My melee stats are 90/91/90. 
---
As for ava‚Äôs assembler, you need a vorkarth head for that right? I wanted to train my ranged up to at least 90 or wait till I can do him on task. Or should I just grind him out on melee regardless?
---
Is the anguish much better than a fury? I used to have one but traded it in for a dfs IIRC. 
---
/r cutenoobs 
---
Yeah f2p is shite
---
I think it's fair to say that it is objective that it affects the results of the polls. Even if it's slight. Not being able to see the results until at least after you vote or until the voting is over means every person is more likely to give their true honest opinion regardless of what the majority think at the time of voting.
---
man, i got a zanyte on my 108th kill but i didnt even get one rune 2h. lucky bastard

If you're enjoying F2P, then do it till you feel bored, then upgrade in order to enjoy some more.

Its only cheap buy it for a month see what you think

because they think its gonna make a difference in voting results xD lololol
---
&gt; I see people talking about 1.2m poinst per hour and what not, yet i cant even fathom how thats done. I have a total of 8 avalible bosses i can take into nightmare zone, yet i get absolutely no points at all...
---
Well yeah, that's because you only have 8 bosses. 
---
If you want big points you need all the bosses, which is like 50. 
---
And it's not just the number of bosses. Certain bosses have a greater increase than others. Desert treasure bosses for example double or triple the points, where some of the lower tier bosses that you've got probably only add like 1% or so. 
---
&gt; And is there any information on how the points scale per boss enemy? example : at X bosses, count draynor gives 500 points. at X bosses, count draynor gives 1200 points, ect.
---
I've yet to see any complete information. And like I said it's not just the number of bosses, the specific bosses matter. 
---
Nice! Keep on the grind, i just finished 99 slayer 
---
See I appreciate someone explaining it to me instead of calling me a monkey lol
---
Wrong, its every 500, and every 10 points inbetween is 2% chance at the next loot roll, so 600 points has 20% chance at 3 loot rolls, 900 has 80% chance
---
I can literally pay my rent and food with money we get from ironman protection in 2k and profits I make from revs in 2.2k.

---
Makes sense to me
---
Because magic is the exact opposite to science. So it doesn't make any fucking sense, and does whatever it wants without regard to the current systems and rules.
---
If Voldemort flung a curse Gandalf the Grey, do you expect that realisticly the old guy has a decent chance of blocking, dodging or countering it? Hell yeah, that's how wizard shit works. Same curse thrown at Batman, master of all the martial arts. That shit probably hit him smack in the face. Batman ain't got no clue how to fight magic. He just knows the minimum of dodge the green shiny stuff coming at him.

That's how magic do.

With song of the elves introducing new crystal armour that doesn't have its stats degrade, can the other crystal equipement be made this way to make it more consistent? Going to NMZ to spend 10k pts to imbue it isn't challenging and is just an annoying added step

No because Im not a noob and tower of life is needed for ardougne diary TRASH
---
It changes based on market prices. There are auto updating spreadsheets like jihadsquads to see which is best. Not sure I've seen fish as best in a while though
---
I've did around 500kc with dhcb with dragon bolts in a max setup without rigour. average 2:20 as well with the fastest kill being 1:48, the only ways I know of to speed up kills would be to make sure you're not missing hits during lightning or during fire if you dont get good rng and get a skip.

I respect that

It changes often. Best to use an auto updating spreadsheet for it

If you're from the US, it helps to imagine the East Coast and the West Coast (intuitive borders that you won't ever confuse if you grew up here). I just pretend that I'm always facing Canada (i.e. towards the _North_ Pole). This is how I remember what directions west/east are relative to north. Helps a lot in places like New York City.

you can get 500k thieving xp? because redwoods are \~600k/hr
---
I recommend you purchase a bond, try 14 days of membership. Start off by completing all the f2p quests until you can complete Dragon Slayer and slay Elvarg. That's the best way to get back into the game.
---
And although those are all f2p quests, it's much more fun as a member. 
---
ur really taking this way too seriously but i'll let it pass due to ur asd diagnosis
---
If you're talking about pulling a rs3 style mining rework OSRS is nowhere near close to needing something like that. Also mlm trivialized mining so it's not even like high mining is hard to get anymore so barring armour/weapons behind high mining/smithing would mean fuck all.

Oh yeah true but even then I cba to play OSRS while studying. It's a distraction imo.
---
Can normies pay for protection in 2k? I'll pay :)

So a game tick occurs every 0.6 seconds. That means that 1.6666... ticks occur every second, 100 ticks a minute, or 6000 ticks an hour. A raw karambwan gives 190 cooking xp when cooked successfully. Assuming 99 cooking(94 at Hosidius), and that you are tick perfect, it is literally impossible to receive more than 1,140,000 cooking experience in one hour.

Technically though you are not wrong, but you get 1% chance at an additional roll for every 5 points. :p every amount of points count.

correct, around 600k/hr.

Don't think it would be too bad honestly. Plus, for new players, it would bring attention to the fact that the game values its music.

I think the ranged animation is much harder to react to, it's not that he necessarily starts range

Good luck

But it's nice because you can leave if it's a bad spawn with little wasted time. 
---
What have you done?
---
I actually fucking hate this 
---
You don't have to do that either. You can attempt it once to Wave 3, figure out which of the fifteen rotations you're on, and then note down the exact minute you entered the caves. The "randomization" ticks forward one rotation in the cycle every minute, so just re-enter on the minute in the rotation that you want (there's a handy table somewhere). If the rotation you want occurs in less than five minutes after the rotation in which you entered, then wait for the next occurrence. You wait at most 15 minutes to get a guaranteed rotation of your choice. No guessing needed.
---

As far as I know, the only change was that you can't "preload" specs by clicking spec bar and then switching to a nonspec bar weapon. This prevents easily getting two instantaneous gmaul specs by just switching to gmaul after a bow or melee hit. I believe if you're fast enough at switching menues you can still do it, it just makes it not braindead simple. 
---
I don't use a gmaul really when I pk though, but I don't think it changed much. 
---
Oh, I didn't know it's not in osrs yet
---
Pretty much a free trial

Good life begins nao.

---
I think I'd sign up on your 53. You didn't miss out on much, there are thousands of hours of content and membership doesn't help a ton with the really low level stuff in skills because a lot of it is f2p anyhow (like up to rune weaponry, low level range stuff, etc...).

What are your stats?
---
Hey! Thanks for the advice.
---
I do bring a black dhide body and legs switch, and try to otherwise follow your advice. However, the main problem is that unlike Callisto and Venenatis, Vet'ion is quite far from a single way combat zone, and I usually get teleblocked/frozen/stacked out before I can reach one.
---
The main problem is that two people using two different spec weapons, styles of magic, and combat styles is a bit too much to handle, especially when so far from singles.

Is there anything I can do?

I don't mean literally a free trial. It feels like a free trial because of how limited it is. f2p osrs is not a full game, it's a small piece of a game.

Because not everybody in this game plays efficiently. And even as somebody as elitist as myself can appreciate when somebody suggest good ole addy plates. Never did them, never would...

black knight's fortress? dragon slayer? sea slug could be considered runaround but it was actually interesting and led up to a better quest, no better zeah quests have been released yet, who knows when they surely will be?  and it's not like zeah is the most interesting area anyway, temple knight/mountain daughter sequels would be much better
---
So you would keep in not hidden and go to 80%?
---
They arent going to keep or raise the percent and hide the polls.
---
Also you are bias, what you think is crap would pass if over 25% also thought the same.

cant believe they allow a clan who was involved in rwt to still play and have their statue

The recent addition of Wyrms and Drakes to Duradels task list at such a high weighting is obnoxious for people trying to do efficient slayer while maintaining points. Could their weighting from duradel be nerfed, or at least given in very small quantities? Ideally they would be only offered by konar but I would settle for a lighter weighting from duradel.

Either make it bearable and afk via the ZMI altar and follow a train or do lunar diplomacy for magic imbue and spend a ton of money doing lavas.

1 - Can we just give Hellhounds a very low go/hr drop table already? Konar makes them better but I think they can have something like a 75k/hr drop table 
---
2 - The ability to "set" more main teleports on things like your Jewellery Box and Glory similar to the digsite pendant and xeric talisman in your home. Also, applying this to the Spirit Tree would be great as well.
---
3 - Resizable UI on both mobile and the main client. But mostly mobile. Also making it movable on mobile would be nice. I have a large phone and even then, it feels like the UI is too small for my fat fingers and j end up having to use my stylus to do anything
---
4 - Shilo Village dialogue skip for the entrance. 
---
5 - Less charter ship dialogue. If I pick a destination (ie brimhaven) I really don't care about confirming the destination. Maybe just make it a charter toggle for those who pick the wrong location 
---
7 - Hard Diary reward for Karamja that lets you build an agility shortcut to get into the Jungle near Shilo easier. Requires 70 con to build, 68 Agility to use, Hard Diary and Legends quest completed. I feel it's fair and it'll make going into the jungle for clue scrolls a bit less of a mess. Especially if you're like me and get stuck cause I guess my character is too dumb to chop a plant in front of him. 
---
8 - Allow the 'Dream' spell (Whatever it's called in the Lunar spellbook) restore run energy at double or triple the speed. I think it'd be good for people who don't want to invest into staminas or energy pots, and give Lunar's some more utility boosts
---

Him trying to add fairy rings and no fairy rings,starting the video off with explaining part 2 of the quest with the brothers first i just closed the video.

Nah i doubt it

Petition: make rats in lumbridge turn into lvl 800 radioactive rats if splashed for more than 50 hours without dying, (doesn‚Äôt have to be continuous), the rats then attack anyone wearing elemental staff in lumbridge, hit through prayer and always hit 30 damage.
---
It did not, I am interested to see how that poll turns out.
---
after your 3rd or 4th kill you stop panicking but before that stay real calm at wave 62 make sure you are full hp and prayer before killing last 360.  
---
If you have pot up a sara brew and restore before the last 360 and ranged pot slap on steel skin tank the adds and only focus on  Jads attacks only.
---
only attack  1 healer at a time to get agro on you then line them up in a straight line so 1-2 hits you only and continue killing jad but make sure you watch Jads attacks always.
---
He can do like 10x Magic in a row or 10x Ranged attack in a row so be careful when switch, I turn on the sounds at wave 62 and I also look at jads movements.
---
If he lifts up front legs and stays up for more than 1 second its a mage Attack.
---
If he Stomps straight away it a ranged attack.  
---
Jad will also spawn  @ where  the last 360  spawns on wave 62(Orange one)
---
Looks like Jagex designing zeah except it‚Äôs not quite square enough and there‚Äôs not enough empty vast space 
---
Right I almost feel bad lol. Having them follow me just right up to a monkey guard and seeing how long it would take for them to run away
---
Do you have the attention span of a two year old?
---
Naughty Elephant Squirt Water is my go to. But for what ever godam reason, if I don't pay attention (especially during quest), East is right, West is also right. I might be disable.
---
Sure just let me start a new account and whoops I've already maxed
---
quest cape is the best cape for catching karambwans if you don't have construction cape
---
and they're good xp

Nice you‚Äôre a student :) and thank you for bringing in personal anecdotes thinking you‚Äôre something better than a random person you decided to go after, because now I‚Äôll bring in mine.
---
1. I am an adult
---
2. I‚Äôm married
---
3. I graduated cum laude
---
4. I graduated with a dual major (accounting and finance)
---
5. I‚Äôve taken 3 out of the 4 cpa exams and passed them all (taking the next exam in February even though it‚Äôs tax season)
---
6. I own a home
---
7. Work full time 
---
And the root of literally is literal and the definition is 
---
taking words in their usual or most basic sense without metaphor or allegory
---
Don‚Äôt use the colloquial definition thinking your great.
---
This is a game I‚Äôm allow to make fun of the characters in it. It has nothing to do with the person behind the computer. 
---
 :)
---
Prifddinas only ironman
---
No Dungeoneering Dungeon? Tsk tsk
---
I always thought hardcore meant that you lost the account if you died... i guess hardcore has slowly lost its meaning since the D2 days
---
This is the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen lmfao, perfection. 
---
How retard
---
Man I wish I could just reach through cyber space and slam these people's faces into whatever desk they're sitting at. Broken nose, nosebleed, or just a ton of pain idc.  Kinda like that girl who hot knocked out when her friends slammed her face into a birthday cake
---
Change kalphite lair for blood altar and this would be improved 100 times over. 
---
You now have a 3 second delay inbetween picking up each item and the client will stutter when doing so.

Why 
---
The comment on his family tree is golden.
---
Let's get skillcapes for hitting level 30 in skills
---
You deleted agility. Wonderful!
---
Fair enough, I was just trying to sarcastically argue how ridiculous it was for him to freak out on you like that, but yeah I agree with you 
---
Just to clarify though, lol noob
---
Some people suck. You can recover though, good luck and make sure your account/computer are secure 
---
I don't think the lock down is really what op is complaining about. It's that a large group of people are using a few accounts to do it. So they're account sharing and using that to cause other players grief. 
---
So he's trying to say that this falls under the bad side of account sharing and should be ban on those accounts.
---
I personally think it's a bit distasteful, but if you're 2200 anyways, you can prolly out dps most people on a normal world so there's lots of other choices.
---
Well then there are literally over a hundred different worlds for you to choose from.  You're basically saying clanning in multi combat shouldn't be allowed lmao.
---
0 xp method? Want the sceptre for my 10 hp def acc.
---
This is exactly what a mod said about this situation last time it was posted, but you're getting down voted.
---
Missed the chance to add Prifimmington
---
I saved this when I first saw it, and today I DID IT!!! Thanks so much for the guide it really really did help me out!
---
For good luck

I like this a lot

Hello skiller 
---
Don't get why people like slayer so much and why every update has to include it. It's just a boring skill to me because as another comment pointed out, it's the "go kill x mobs" quests of every other mmo. I do like it when I can sub in better gp methods (vork for blue drags, demonics for black demons, etc) or when it's a boss task, but there's nothing fun or fulfilling about hitting the hop limit trying to find an unpopulated spot so I can get that juicy 40k xp/hr
---
I don't think I've ever encountered a written guide on the wiki that doesn't describe where they're located.
---
No, slayer itself isn't, but Cerberus sure as hell is.
---
I completely agree, these people have no taste.
---
why not
---
Neither funny nor original.
---
yes it could have a different color, like a faded/torn cape.
---
Yea have you seen the price of coconuts lately?
---
This is beyond science
---
except that that's exactly what a mod in a previous Reddit post said to do about it
---
Why would people want them hidden so jagex can just scew the votes and update how they want
---
I remember reading it and seeing the Researcher in the picture and thinking ‚Äúdamn this dude got a mining skillcape‚Äù
---
According to Hyger (rank 2). He's not going to give you access to his spreadsheet, but take my (and his) word for it.
---
Dying to jad seems to help peoples long term anxiety of the fight caves. Hearing people say they first try it at 63 range isnt always encouraging.
---
Took me about 6 tries at 100 combat. Once I got the prays down, it was just picking off the healers aggro one by one. If all healers are attacking you at once you'll get hit for a lot, so you might want to move a tile or 2 away so you can stack them behind one
---
East is Right. 
---
...as usual.
---
Ah yes, because ironmen use gp to buy seeds from the GE.
---
I dont get this
---
Kebos lowlands had a ton of skilling content, how was the herb patch just a last resort?
---
Don't fucking scare me like this, I still have PTSD from making a Chaser set.
---
Can we.make Superman mode a thing? You can carry items that can be equipped. No banks, or inventory. 
---
Always always always always always always check urls before logging in. Especially after clicking a link.
---
Dude looks like a beast. I don‚Äôt see the problem here.... 
---
I find fishing, cooking, mining, etc to be great candidates for afking on mobile.
---
They only spawn once, right?  Would it be advised to kill them off instead of kiting them away?
---
Ultra Hardcore Ironman would be permanent 1 HP. Any damage and you die
---
Not this joke, I can tell you that much
---
Something something I got 1kc kq pet

Have you considered doing desert treasure?
---
You want to take the only challenging mechanic about sire and take it away from sire under the pretext of qol. Better learn to left click better shithead, just wait till you get to tob. 
---
Weast
---
I mean I agree he does sometimes, but he doesn‚Äôt always which is kind of weird to skip in post production. 
---
Experience rates and click intensity is what defines difficulty in Runescape skilling though.
---
Everyone can do a lap of Runecrafting, it's piss easy. No one is arguing with that.

Ultra compost + Hespori Seed = Mega compost

when?

Funny guy
---
Looks like an alt acc tbh
---
Generally, the in-depth guide has ALMOST all npc locations or at least gives a general directions. The quick-guide doesn‚Äôt include everything but that‚Äôs the point.
---
I use the quick guide and then switch to in-depth when I can‚Äôt find a npc. Hold down space bar for every conversation, ezpz 
---
That doesn't solve the actual problem though does it? 
---
For real man, I work 50 hours a week and make good money. I‚Äôll throw $25 at bonds once and a while because I don‚Äôt have much spare time to grind the money in game. Way worth it and it helps me enjoy the game doing what I want to do instead of that cash grind. I don‚Äôt use my moms card, I use mine
---
I am going to hop worlds today dropping my cat now. 
---
Slayer
---
It‚Äôs still against the rules you fucking moron
---
Lmao gl pking on acc account like that in f2p you have absolutely zero kill potential. What are you honestly even thinking? 
---
big gay
---
get the construction icon complete with green pixel
---
Love douchey responses like this where it's abundantly clear you can't fucking read and just saw the word RoT and started crying. 
---
Big yikes . Please quit osrs and never return. 
---
At some point, you mentioned that alchemical hydra would be better gp/hr than vorkath &amp; zulrah. How do you compute the gp/hr of bosses?
---
Gp/hr is based on three inputs - quantity of drops, value of drops, and kills per hour.
---
Obviously jmods have access to the exact drop tables so you know the quantity of items received, but for alchemical hydra, (currently) over half the gp per kill comes from uniques (claw is 83m as of writting, and is an estimated 1:1000 drop, so 83k/kill from claw on average). In order to conclude that alchemical hydra is better gp/hr than vorkath and zulrah, you would need to put values on these uniques. Roughly how do you guys estimate what the values on these uniques are?
---
Also - kills/hr. How do you estimate how many kills per hour players can realistically obtain?
---
i think its more because you said: no rangers ever instead of no rangers yet
---
Lol what game is that on the left? Clown Kingdom??
---
Is it possible to allow the trident and it‚Äôs variants to accept other basic runes instead of just fire runes. As long as you only add one type of rune at a time. Meaning once you charge it with earth runes you can‚Äôt add other runes unless you uncharge it first. 
---
can you spare a square? just one square!!!
---
20 hours of minimum wage.... Most of us don't live in Seattle or San Francisco.
---
I think the smoke devil one is the only one out of place here. What that guy was getting at is that Cerberus is the boss variant of hellhounds, which do not need a 91 slayer requirement. All the other things on this list that have a boss variant which requires the same level to kill the little ones as the boss.
---
Pleb, completioncompost is what the *real* players use

yeah they get tattoos to express themselves because they‚Äôre morons that lack identity or personality

---
**Key Stats - Total / Hour**
---
Experience - 229k / 22.9k 
---
Profit - 8.75m / 875k

- Good gp/h, especially for mid-tier accounts [low reqs] 
---
- With high con and agility no need to use abyss
---
- Comparable intensity to most other runecrafting methods 
---
I'm pretty sure he said he likes the idea of grouping together with people and would encourage it? something like that maybe not word for word but he did say he like that it made pvp active
---
Nobody cares that's what im saying and the way the world works yeah weed was illegal 10 years ago but everyone started smoking it now it's not illegal either way idgaf rwt is what players do
---
I went to a drop party yesterday 
---
Exactly lol this is why the average RS3 players is superior and RS3 is the superior games it gives so many ways to throw money at the game so players can be bigger supporters.
---
Nobody fucking cares how much other players "support" the game. It's fun to laugh at stupid bond warriors.
---
I was trying to get 1 kill for diaries and couldnt do nearly enough damage, even with 90 rng/80 mage...
---
Found out i was waring cooking gloves after 5 attempts üòÖ
---
Probably very low, at least I hope so. Uniques are supposed to be the main attraction here unlike WT.
---
This is amazing
---
Make it like garys mod.  When someone complains about how the game works, you force a pop up on their screen explaining they're in the PvP area of an MMO
---
This guy knows what's up 
---
Yes you do, however magic is less aids to train than RC and getting to 85 is very quick with ancients.
---
Notice how he doesnt have a a single ''666'' hes scared as fuck for the devil
---
It's the goblin staff
---
Actually its NO SEX EVERY WEDNESDAY 
---
Yeah I understand, was just correcting him for krakens and smoke devils
---
Could access to the wild be limited to a X amount of worlds in order to initiate more pker vs pker scenarios? Having to bully PvMers because there‚Äôs no one else to fight (pkers hopping/spread across so many worlds) and then PvMers down voting PvP updates because they got killed, is counter intuitive to the advancement of PvP content. 
---
Wilderness PvMing content shouldn‚Äôt be a reason to limit pker vs pker scenarios. 
---
Who are you talking about? Top guys or their slaves?
---
Still awful xp rates. I don‚Äôt even mind runecrafting, I‚Äôm not an efficiency nut, I‚Äôm moreso talking about pre 77 runecrafting too. Add on 5-10k xp/hr to pre 77 methods somehow and runecrafting will just feel a lot better
---
fishing is probably the better trade off between money and xp. any methods that make money with wc are usually extremely slow xp
---
Not enough herb patches
---
Fuck... the one weekend I‚Äôm going on vacation..
---
clearly. or maybe people do stuff because it makes them happy and its fuck all to do with you, id rather hang around with tattoo'd people than someone whos as much of a tool as you buddy
---
You're in the comment section of a Reddit post. 
---
Addy platebodies also requires 88 smithing (86 if you want to use mature stouts).  I don't see the point of doing addy plates if gold is faster.
---
Needed to pull out glasses to see that pet 
---
If i was going to give anyone a tip on learning this, it would be to learn 1 MAYBE 2 phases at a time. If you don't get the desired phase, tele out. After you've got that down, took about 10 for me, add another and do both, one from memory one from help. Do this til you have all 4 down.
---
worked extremely well for me.
---
&gt;Having a natural progression of items is not obsoleting existing content, most notably because Bronze and Iron have been around forever.
---
&gt;That being said, having three tiers of meta with requirements at or below level 5 is indeed pretty silly, and if you were redesigning the system from scratch that's not how it would be set up. Iron does, for the most part, obsolete Bronze.
---
Which is 100% okay. That really is how leveled content works. Every time. Just because a higher end item has some sort of cost or downside associated with ie, a la Barrows degrading, doesn't mean the previous tier isn't obsolete.
---
&gt;What the hell are you even talking about?
---
The same as the above comment. You level and previous resources and methods become obsolete.
---
&gt;It shouldn't happen with locations, and in good sandbox MMORPGs it doesn't happen with locations. It's never historically happened with OSRS, and it shouldn't. Having strong consistent community hubs is what makes the game so good.
---
But it has. The Woodcutting Guild for instance has a Sawmill closer than Varrock's last I checked. Location-specific improvements doesn't injure a community. At all. Location progress has happened in OSRS and will continue to. It happens in RS3 as well and it's done really solid things for that game's progression too.
---
&gt;And this is exactly the opposite of the design philosophy that Runescape has always had. Runescape does not have a level 1-10 zone and a level 10-15 zone and a level 15-20 zone etc. That's bad game design. It renders huge portions of the world empty and useless for the vast majority of players.
---
It does, it's just less clearly displayed. Dangerous areas with aggressive mobs are the same as level banded zones. GW2 has handled it far better than any other MMO, with level scaling inside zones, but it doesn't mean that every area released has to remain relevant forever. That's how games stagnate and die.
---
&gt;Nobody is saying there shouldn't be reasons to go there, but that it should not just be strictly better in every way.
---
Where in any of my comments did I say that needed to be the case? I just said I'm seeing almost nothing of interest here and we've failed to get a picture of Prifddinas as a city. My critical nature here has been that something as elusive as Prifddinas is being showcased as a place with two bosses and a bunch of preexisting content. That's so boring.
---
&gt;But it should not be like RS3, where it has a GE and essentially replaces the existing cities as hubs. That just leaves the world feeling empty, and any players still around end up all being low level players.
---
However, RS3 has created several solid hubs across the board. Varrock is the basic one, that is very accessible and still used. Menaphos is a mid-tier hub with lots of great resources for players at that level. Prifddinas fills the high end niche, with nice skilling options as well. No matter which location you use, you still have to leave that hub to play the vast majority of the game. The same case is here.
---
Mind you, I'm not saying Prif needs a GE like RS3. But even with GEs in Prif and Menaphos, people are still at the Varrock GE.
---
&gt;Nobody is saying there shouldn't be progression, but too much vertical progression and not enough horizontal progression leaves you in a situation where you just replace things with higher levelled things with slightly bigger numbers on them.
---
So exactly what horizontal progression are we seeing here? We've got a new ranged tank armor with high stats, we've got new BiS tools, and then we've got a bunch of preexisting resources that don't offer *anything* new.
---
&gt;They haven't done this perfectly, but it's way better than RS3 where they have strictly better options all the way up into what, the mid 90s in levels?
---
I outright think that OSRS handles this far worse than RS3. RS3 has leveling options that scale all the way to the top, and usually have multiple options at every stage, with varied intensity and cost. It feels really good when, no matter your level, you've got a choice on how you want to progress and can feel good about it. For instance, one of our more recent updates was Player-Owned Farms, which offered new Farming options by raising livestock, but it didn't hurt normal farming at all, and even feeds back into it via the rewards of the Farm. Additionally, for things like the highest tier of armor, level 92 gear, you need to use previous tiers in order to create them, keeping demand on them up and creating a satisfying progression where the gear you use remains relevant and useful as you move forward. That's just good progression overall - bolster lower tiers by requiring them for higher tiers.
---
If you insist on using gmaul you can add a D2H to whack with after you spec, or simply use a DDS 
---
Cool idea man, I'm so tired of the lack of variety of PVP builds. Props for not staying 1 Def.
---
you could argue that most monsters dont fit down there but unless they move them somewhere else, daggs will be just that much worse to kill on assigments as you will have to kill them in the lighthouse where everyone and their dog cannons or at waterbirth where they hit obscurely often and drops are watered down because of hides and fremm troll items
---
I think we‚Äôve just learned that the majority of the osrs subreddit was in special ed 
---
lmfaooooooooooooooooo

Thank fucking god.

Get graceful asap

Na north tree ss best, pkers never check.

Owner of the iron cc logging in??? Wtf

add "Kadian" or "The Backline" and your'e welcome to chill in the chat until someone logs!

god this is so true

well I'll see you guys in a couple years when ososrs gets released, been fun!
---
Well...

Nooit Oorlog Zonder Wapens

same, it's glorious.

My phd in nonsense and a quick google search later has revealed that there is no plural of Cerberus, but if you want to force it to be plural you could do something like Cerberuses or Cerberean dogs
---
Nooit Op Zondag Winkelen
---
lmao that's gross. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying  there isn‚Äôt a temporary work-around, but this isn‚Äôt something I would consider a mobile-only qol change. 
---
It's also fun to laugh at poor people lmao
---
So much time spent. So much time wasted. 
---
They need to ban all of his accounts.
---
TIL the wiki has quick guides. i still feel like following a video is the quickest and easiest way to go but to each their own
---
Im over it
---
and my favorite part of life :)
---
How did you get them? And if you plant kronos seeds you should be able to get 1 kill a day 
---
I don‚Äôt want to laugh at this, but fuuckkk lmaaoo
---
Let me know if you do! 
---
lmao you‚Äôre idiot that‚Äôs offended because you got shitty tattoos too. no surprise. Have fun being a disappointment to your parents.
---
Where has he been?
---
This is eerily close to a conversation I had with my clan yesterday lol.
---
That's karamja tho
---
Yeah this is posted time and time again In the discord. Scout a decent raid, post it in lfr-learner and say that you are 0 kc. You'll find someone to raid with in no time.
---
&gt;not 6666 total level
---
scuffed
---
They weren't locked down whenever I visited a few months back. It was standard pker activity, not an organised clan. Could've just been lucky though. 
---
afking nmz
---
Wtf would the difference be
---
Props to you man, more people should play the game like you instead of trying to do everything the fastest way possible, but a good inbetween for fishing for XP and GP is Monkfish, they're pretty fast but also pretty afk.
---
B0aty uploaded again? Guess he really needs that rent money
---
I'm 18m farming xp and I learned it a couple weeks ago watching B0aty's stream lol
---
The usual thing is to use gmaul directly after claws rather than use one after another. 
---
I think it's 40m/2 weeks
---
Literally, who fucking cares?
---
smh.. no barrows gloves
---
Wait yeah...how is this possible?
---
They‚Äôre just saying the main attractor of Wintertodt is the xp, not the uniques.
---
I do quests probably twice as fast watching a follow-along comparable to reading and then carrying out. Especially with the longer quests and guides.

---
Please send me a link when you have something uploaded, would gladly take a look
---
Im just advising, he can choose to ignore my advice if he so wishes
---
RC is the skill with the lowest amount of 99s, so it kinda is the most hated skill in a way.
---
Clanning communities still very strong.
---
As for pures, there are many builds, sadly nothing between 2-41 anymore, but 1 def, void and zerk still going strong.
---
There's a few interesting builds like staff of the dead pures (requires 75 attack, 1 strength to wield) and obsidian (60 str, 60 def, 1 attack).
---
The new quests probably wont interest you but the Zulrah questline is completeable on a pure and that still earns 2.5-3m an hour.
---
Revenants are also another really good money maker.
---
One of the most popular PvP builds right now (that can also be used a pseudo main) is a 75 defense void account. This is mainly for 100 CB (needed for elite void) and rigour.
---
Get good trash lmfao
---
Once you start using a cannon there‚Äôs no going back
---
And nobodys forcing you to play this game, so stop bitching about high end content. 
---
agility from 90-99 is AFK as fuck. Don't even need to rotate the camera at any point.

* Can you add a Firepit of Eternal Light to the Lumbridge-Cellar dungeon? (NOT the Lumbridge Swamp Caves, that place already has one)
---
* Can you add a Firepit of Warmth to the Ice Path? (Can only be made after you've killed Kamil)
---
Oh, duhü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Could you give me the source on that? [Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Supercompost) states:
---
&gt; Supercompost does not increase the yield of [trees](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trees), [fruit trees](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fruit_trees), or [bush patches](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bush_patch); therefore, it is not recommended to treat those patches with supercompost.
---
Tbh people who earn the gold playing and then sell it aren't as big of a deal as bot farms, and while they are also important there is only so much you can tackle at once.  That being said, I don't think them locking down 2200 total worlds at revs is an issue.  You still have many other worlds to kill the revs.  Are they just not supposed to go there? Are other worlds okay? Why is 2200 off-limits?
---
I'd rather the first option, getting descriptive helps a lot of people. But I do see where you're coming from. 
---
Either people chase the uniques in WT, or the new skilling minigame/boss will have good xp to prevent it from being dead content. Take your pick. Stop playing both sides of the coin. 
---
Lol how fucking sad is your life that you can‚Äôt pay for beer with an actual job

I‚Äôd rather use my anguish

75 range and 70 slayer. I don‚Äôt think I have the income to not lose money on blowpipe. Is it worth it to buy dragon crossbow for general and slayer use until I get to wyverns and/or gargoyles? Or should I stick with rune crossbow? Or some other weapon?
---
Not really willing to throw down 30 mil for armadyl lol.
---
They'd eat Seren's feces if they could
---
nah its a dinosaur egg cracked open with the yolk splashing out
---
And what exactly is the problem? A clan killing people and locking down a few select worlds? Why is it okay on DMMT for clans to lock down areas, where there is only 1 world?
---
What's le staff?
---
They only spawn once IF they dont heal jad to full and you kill them. So if you get him down to half and they spawn and you waste time killing all of them but meanwhile they have already healed jad all the way to full they will respawn when you get him down to half again. Your best bet is just relax and pay attention to jad's attacks and hit the healers one at a time starting from the furthest one so you can try and stack them in a line so you are only being hit by one. If they have healed him to full it's totally fine because they are not dead and wont respawn to heal him.

Yeah i hate as an ironman how half the teleports require some stupid little quest or minigame to be finished or visited one time......If i wanted to visit stuff i would make a noob acc walk to the GE sell cowhides and buy every teletab in the game....
---
dust devils sorry
---
So if Jad goes 100-&gt;50-&gt;100 just keep 1 healer alive and ignore it?

Lol chill, I have a career but when you got a couple buddies who buy it for a buck a mill why not 
---
Like what?

Snugglequest has started uploading new guides recently as well. Her guides are my go to. They have all the required information, they're clear, and she includes a little info on the website lore as things progress. 
---
What‚Äôs the new skilling boss?
---
The UK will compromise and accept moving it to the Falklands.
---
Wooxito
---
I've just been in the 80s for so long its such a bitch gettin to 90
---
And free and easy to do! Only saying as I did mine yesterday.
---
Use RuneLite fam
---
That's a shit example. Weed use has always been high. It's not like a recent thing in the last 10 years. Also it doesn't matter if you gave a fuck. It's still against the rules
---
I don't know how to add a flair lol! But it's the question flair haha 
---
If they did level up separate accounts and do it then op would just end down voted as a salty player I guess. But it is alot of work to level up a 2200 account for every player that helps rot with controlling the cave. 
---
People can't be on 24/7, so I'm sure they take shifts with it. And each one of those different people having their own near max account seems a bit unlikely. So op is trying to make jagex look into it so they'll maybe get some accounts banned and op can maybe kill some revs until someone like torvesta borrows a 2200 account to make another pking video there.
---
Do you think everyone here is a poorfag that buys bonds from GE?
---
The boots are hardly any better than blessed boots... OP will spend so much time farming blue drags when he could buy the bones or even do ensouled heads in a fraction of the time.
---
Opportunity cost. Up to him of course but why spend that much on an item he isn't going to get a significant boost from. (Blessed boots cost about 1m)
---
If you think the requirements in your post are long and tedious, this game probably isn't for you.
---
Theres still a really huge supply of dragonhide sets and dragonhide available though. Don't think either of those solutions would make dhide worth more than 10-20k per set
---
Display name has a number in IT delete account!

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Meanwhile I‚Äôm 56 dry...  congrats 
---
Found the RoT member
---
I love people like you. You fucking get it.
---
There is so much to unpack here. 
---
What is that best on miscellania????
---
Even if you don‚Äôt care about lore, the quests still have very amusing dialogue. Not sure if don‚Äôt cara about that either, but like the other guy said it makes questing more fun.
---
Not even using Lunar to do all your farming while at the GE smh
---
Haven't been drunk in a while me. It's always 100+ and I haven't extended. I can even turn extended off so I definitely won't drunk
---
I guess my in game experience is incredibly unique then, because I truly do see it all the time when I talk about Dung in game.
---
Ah well, either way I'm excited for this minigame!
---
WoW is a game of constant new experiencences. RuneScape is a game that's "experience" is based on the journey. Payment for membership allows for an increase the breath of the experience. It's far more rewarding to get from 3 combat to 60 so you can finally experience a dragon weapons power for the first time. COX is the same thing you can't experience the incredibly difficult but rewarding content until you really shown your stuff. You need to commit to learning the game, gaining levels, and failing A LOT before you can really get into something that has as steep a learning curve as raids or TOB. In conclusion Blizzard is more successful because they capitalized on the addiction model in a different way than RuneScape did. If you don't like the way RuneScape rewards you then don't play and don't pay. You can spend the money on wow and get the "experience" you want.

The point isn't even the xp, it's the annoyance of being in a rythm and then suddenly notice you accidentally took the vial, the cue that you took it (icon in inventory) often comes a tick later than the actual picking up. 
---
So you often try to withdraw from dispenser, then you notice vial is in inventory THEN you need to "escape" from the "pick x" menu as you can't drop with that open: drop it and reclick the dispenser.
---
"fuck it I'm back to slayer, that's more profit and less stressful; and they get all kind of qol updates" is my response after that.
---
In gp alone, I have ~7.5m. My primary gear setup includes a malediction ward, seers ring, and an occult necklace bringing my bank value up to ~11-11.5m. I'll figure out the exact worth when I get home.
---
Yeah pretty soon doing herb runs is going to take too long to be worth it. All this does is make prices proportionately higher and moves the barrier to entry into ranarr runs higher so lower levels can‚Äôt utilize it w:o breaking their bank 
---
If anything it devalues herb runs for everyone bc the rise is demand for seeds isn‚Äôt necessarily accompanied by more demand for p pots. 
---
I like how they‚Äôre trying to show skilling love w Prif but this is stupid. 
---
I got 2 rangers boots, 1 ranger tunic. That's from 100 medium and like 20 elite clues.

We aren't making fun of their support for the game, we're making fun of their clear lack of knowledge of the game, and how poorly they're spending the gold they purchased.
---
I don't really think you could argue that a typical "champion" OP is showing us, has been playing and paying long enough to understand why he looks nooby and silly in the first place. It's okay to be nooby, nobody is saying its bad to be new. To deny how silly they look is just ignorant. Lighten up.
---
If you 3x the use of hides in the armour and 3x the alch price to go with it, you'll have 3x'd the price.
---
It's total my problem but I find it difficult to watch his guides, something about the Finnish accent makes me vaguely uncomfortable. Occasionally the way things are enunciated almost sounds like they're... choking? 
---
I am 27 as well and I definitely agree with what your saying. Have until Friday to figure it out .
---
That's super good to know thanks for that
---
Activate your Windows, brother
---
What are you on about dude.. WT is bad rewards and good exp, this will be good rewards bad exp.
---
This is ScapeRune
---
Follow a soup guide. 
---
Very loaded question. Do you mean just time to complete each individual clue, or are your factoring in time taken to get them, etc?
---
But quite a while, especially if you don‚Äôt use imps for elites.
---
Britland is a strange and wonderful place
---
What happened with Theatre of Blood Entry Mode? 
---
I‚Äôd love to get a whiff of those things 
---
Or why not make rc, the skill that already exists, do what warding does...?
---
It's also great for UIM to get noted secondaries with the dairy.
---
Lumbridge castle leading to grand exchange fits so well 
---
Pretty much this
---
Some rooms get scaled down, but your points for olm get scaled also, but olm doesn't scale down.
---
this is an instant, so you will lose al lyour items if you die.
---
WoW has been completely gutted, destroyed, simplified, and is now a former shell of itself. Literally since the year Activision bought Blizzard, the number of players has been in a constant downfall, and at this point is pretty much completely dead. Activision is the reaper of death.
---
and this is where youve clearly missed the entire point of this post. theres nothing wrong with 20 people spending all day locking it down. the problem here is 80 people locking it down with 20 accounts by making sure someone is logged into one of them at all times. how is that so difficult to understand
---
Gives infinite yield but it's balanced because it's high reqs
---
hahahaha
---
Cabbage cape counts so its not rare anymore
---
It would be.
---
Why did you follow him to crash him?
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be hostile, just wondering why anyone would care if the emote was unlocked it kind of hard to really show that off

Imagine not having right click pvp toggled on in 2019
---
I always pay full attention while skilling. Even when waiting for crops to grow. 
---
I think you can mine it
---
Bwaaa?! The 'All Platforms' works on mobile?!
---
It‚Äôs no dead content dumb dumb, I‚Äôm literally telling you how it‚Äôs creating it‚Äôs own viable niche which it‚Äôs then filling. The profit is enough to make it worth doing to play with friends which is the niche it fills.
---
Some people have friends who play this game or could invite to play it. 
---
there are clans that you can pay for protection.
---
I always hate when people take the shut up meme too seriously. Like people writing paragraphs about how horrible he is and how the world would be better if he stopped commenting at all lol how do they not see the irony in that. Serene's comments are 90% pure autism yes but that's no reason to bully them beyond a funny joke. Plus everyone sticks up for him whenever he makes a good comment and someone tries to rag on him lol, makes my heart warm
---
Leave an inventory of bars in the dispencer and click on it instead of the ground in front of it?
---
because you cant compute sinple logic the world isnt the issue, its 80 peolle using 20 accounts to keep those 20 eligible accounts always on at the cave.so you could have 8-10 people login to an account for a mere 2-3 hours at a time
---
The skill involves spirit animals. Husbandry doesn't necessarily need to be involved in training the skill like I already said in the post.
---
If 2 simple quests and 100 kudos is too much for you, you might be playing the wrong game. 
---
Settled is that you?
---
not only is it not even against the rules but how would you even know that they're account sharing?
---
&gt;I second this statement.
---
We second this statement
---
Like the other dude said, you won't need prayer for those. It just makes them a lot more AFK.
---
Depending how far you are, it might be worth farming barrows. Guthans can make slayer a lot better. I use it for stuff like hellhounds instead of prayer.
---
Clan Chats are still broken and will glitch out when hopping worlds. This is extremely inconvenient for PVMing and PKing in groups. Is there any indication on when/how this can be fixed?  
---
His numbers are only 7k higher than zmi, not worth doing lavas imo unless you're good at it and have BiS gear for it
---
Hey guys. Did you know...
---
Jagex still doesn't hide poll results
---
if it's so hard then how did Rot do it?
---
Last week power of the blowpipe was mentioned.
---
The problem appears to be that a fast but low damage per hit weapon is significantly outclassing slow but high hitting weapons such as the crossbow.
---
How would the team feel about giving monsters the ability to negate "weak" hits?
---
The hydra could for example have: Any hit that would have dealt less than 5 damage will be considered too "weak" to penetrate the hydra's thick hide and will deal 0 damage instead.
---
This would essentially nerf the blowpipe since it's average hit is lower than slower weapons such as the crossbow.
---
runecraft bad
---
S u p p o r t
---
Ok mister HCIM flair
---
It's pretty necessary for Zeah RC
---
Just in general (not specifically over the last 2 months):
---
Most bosses added have been dropping herbs rather than seeds - cutting off the supply. This has been slightly remedied recently by Jagex but was a problem for a while along with other resource based skills.
---
Specifically for Herb Patches though, we've made consistent jumps up in the number of patches. We started at 5 (Trollheim, Fally, Ardougne, Canafis, Catherby)and now we're up to 10 (Harmony Island, Hosidius, Weiss, Farming Guild and Prif when it gets added). The last 3 are fairly recent, with Weiss only being in September 2018.
---
The addition of Ultracompost a year prior to Weiss also doesn't help.
---
But that's the problem it isn't 20 people it's 50 people using accounts that take tons of hours to make. Rot can't hold other worlds because there aren't enough people online they have to cherry pick the world to one with high reqs to hold it permanently. 
---
Have you tried bronze spear ?
---
If you cant read, reddit isnt for you either.. yet here you are!
---
or unicorn horns
---
But I believe jagex are planning on making it so short contracts give fewer seeds and long contracts give more
---
As is tradition
---
Read the comments, the cape doesnt unlock the icon anymore
---
Agility is like studying, at first you don‚Äôt want to fucking do it. After 10 hours you don‚Äôt realize where the time went and now you‚Äôre 70 agility. Its not bad at all
---
The problem is that mining it is a complete waste of time when you can do one temple trekking run and get a couple thousand. I shouldn't have to do PVM content to get essences for runecrafting.
---
Because it's interesting to have weird accounts, like I said
---
ad hominem fallacy
---
100% of active osrs content jam packed into Misthalin. Dump everything else and never look back
---
technically, what you just said is irrelevant
---
It's not necessarily about lowering prices but perhaps rather about preventing them from increasing too much. Because Jagex has implemented more herb patches, the prices of herbs will be lower in the future than what they otherwise would have been - but we don't have the data needed to figure out what those prices will be relative to current prices.
---
Holy shit kill it with fire 
---
Awesome! I've been doing an 80 - 99 infernal eels, should be done in a week or 2 stay tuned!
---
Since we recently have the QOL month suggestions and COX blog, when will we see expect to see the QOL month on  wilderness? The last one was almost one year ago. 
---
I don't like RoT but it seems like his post is completely fair?
---
With Artisan going unpassed, are farming contracts an attempt to integrate these concepts into the game without the addition of a new skill? And if so should we expect similar additions to other skills?
---
Damn son..
---
Only male platelegs get extra pocket slots, can't fit anything into women pant pockets.
---
New cargo shorts item +5 pockets -100% sex appeal
---
I don't think PKing together counts as "exploiting gameplay mechanics". 
---
magic is underpowered atm compared to ranged and melee, this staff would balance it slightly. It would be a very rare drop + you would need the scroll too to unlock the spell and the casts would be expensive - all this balances it's power :)
---
didn‚Äôt ask 
---
I'd only consider Blue Dragons if you have 70 Agility for the shortcut. 
---
Have you done any quests on this account? My level 3 has very limited combat xp to use and that‚Äôs for the last few quests I have left to complete. Curious if this is doable for me
---
Only 300 dry?
---
Yeah honestly how does anyone die out in the middle of nowhere lmfao like if you run out of water just home teleport idiot
---
Exactly. People are missing the point. There wouldn't be a problem with them locking it down if they were doing it without breaking the rules. The problem is the account sharing, which is supposed to be against tos. I don't particularly understand the people that don't understand
---
I can compare them very simply- they are both features that *currently exist* on 3rd party clients. They are absolutely comparable and you'd have to be very willfully ignorant to ignore the context of 3rd party features that surrounds this discussion. 
---
&gt;Very poisoned mentality to dismiss all change that makes the game more enjoyable as easyscape, my friend
---
No I really don't think it is honestly. I think it is an absolutely necessary mentality. You should be very afraid of change, because the game is already good as is. Do you think rs3 happened overnight? Do you think one day they decided "oh, well I guess I'll make the game easy now". It's a slow and gradual process by nature. 
---
How do you know they are on 24/7?  Is it really that much of a surprise if someone with 2.2k total plays a fuck ton?  I know some people that play 16+ hours a day, sometimes more.  And even if people are sharing accounts I still don't see the issue.  They aren't preventing you from doing the activity, its in a pvp zone where you can fight them and try and get a larger team to take the location from them.  Or you can be like everyone else and use other worlds.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that slayer bossing isn‚Äôt challenging at 99 def. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that low def slayer bossing is a little bit challenging given the suboptimal gear we have to use. 
---
The wall of dedication, what a shame. The highest quest req for runecrafting is 50 and anything after that is diaries and bragging rights. Diaries aren‚Äôt essential but they show dedication. While we are at it how about we complain about the cost of training construction or the fact that herblore has nearly the same problem. Best xp rates are from lower lvls and they cost a lot of gp.
---
This was the longest sentence I ever read.
---
DDS or 1 iteming? Definitely not RoT
---
Could we get an Emote Cape of Accomplishment in Old School? This would be obtainable by having all emotes, including the festive, skillcape and air guitar emotes. It would also be cool if you could trade in Emote Enhancing items to the Emote Master to permanently unlock those emotes, allowing you to perform them without having the items equipped. These would also be a requirement for the cape.
---
You said Jad
---
Is this best way to get spider eggs?
---
That's still 20k xp an hour. What's your rc level?
---
Ratfucks
---
Lol keep at it bro 1500 kc is nothing
---
this doesn't matter and is a waste of dev time. idiots will get phished no matter how much protection you try to put up.
---
no-one with any common sense is worried about being hacked. if you are, then you should stop giving your life story to everyone, or stop sharing your account.
---
Yep

It‚Äôs been 10 years why do I still remember this...
---
Depends some are better about it than others I bought 3 bonds when I started and grabbed a fury, black mask and blowpipe, and the extra ~1M went into funding miscellania. I do regret buying those bonds as now money isnt as big of an issue but man it did make thing so much easier.

p.s: dress up as draynor village willow bot

It just sucks doing seers for like 20 levels

If I want to quickly repair my pouches I do don‚Äôt I?

Thoughts on the F2P goblin boss idea someone posted? I Would love to see more F2P bosses that give newer players insight into members perks, and that also wont  be overpowered for members or dead content. I also think the idea of a non-tradeable unique item for them that could potentially be best in slot like the gloves that were mentioned are good for more incentive for players to kill the boss without it making them lots of money from alchables.
---
North?
---
Are you really comparing the whip and blowpipe lol? Whip isnt close to bis
---
Can I ask what gear you are using.
---
Trying to get my account ready to start that. 
---
Or using it to try and move up on hiscores. In the pk world, people share accounts all the time. Can do a pure one day, a zerker the next. 
---
I disagree. If you're over 2000 total on an iron Man, you definitely have the gear to get rev kills on a normal world. Sure you might not have one of the rev weapons, but you can do very well with a blowpipe or some high level melee gear. I'm only 1550 total and I can get rev kills with a blowpipe in d'hide with 80 range.
---
Fishing. Woodcutting is more profitable indirectly. If you fletch bows and alch them yourself by the thousands you will make much larger profit with Magic XP on the side. 
---
Thanks for the link! 
---
Desert Treasure NPC that can attack you randomly if you're carrying the diamonds.
---
Have you ever tried to train crafting, herbilore, construction? Theres no money in them.
---
Can I get some proof on that mod statement? Did they say ‚Äúplayers‚Äù or ‚Äúaccounts‚Äù?
---
Yikes at your whole account.
---
Protect from magic can reduce bind times by 50%.
---
Good magic defense will cause the spell to miss, giving you time unbinded.
---
The problem is, getting caught by one ice barrage *potentially means being frozen for 20 fucking seconds*. That‚Äôs a literal and automatic death sentence for anyone, let alone somebody being gangbanged by 5-10+ players in multi combat.
---
Also, being stunlocked by a DSpear and being smited out before you can even respond to their forced penetration of your mind, body, and soul, is easily the most frustrating mechanic in the game. Thank god it‚Äôs never happened to me, but watching people lose items to it is sad to see. 
---
OSRS needs more defensive minded tactics/weapons. Special attacks on certain weapons that force the use of said weapon, but grants periods of immunity to stun locks or freezes. Also, a certain special ability attached to right clicking a shield should be a once a minute freedom from binds or stuns, or something of that nature. 
---
There‚Äôs means to implement new mechanics without redoing the whole combat system like EOC. Jagex just hasn‚Äôt been creative enough, nor inclined to balance PvP in that manner because in their minds, attempting to do that leads to a dwindling player base. 
---
I almost guarantee any poll that adds those features will not pass even 70%. 
---
I hate whoever exposed the ToB login screen as a woman spreading her legs because I can never unsee it ever since.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/kb04Glr](https://imgur.com/a/kb04Glr)
---
What is doing in varrock?
---
The rules state account sharing to gain an advantage over other players. It just gets ignored unless it's DMM. 
---
I don't think we need a skill that just takes off of what already exists in game. I'd rather something completely new than the exact same as what we have already.
---
So it's not even something to care about when OSRS have been out for years and it took like people a month to get 99s in everything
---
Jagex have said multiple times that nobody has ever been banned for account sharing, outside of buying infernal capes and chasing hiscores.
---
Without the visage I just use full void and rune cross bow and trident fury/occult mage Cape/accumulator 
---
Oh dude i saw you at burning man that was a great show right?
---
Honey drops cc active raid group daily Corp mass upon other things on weekends, in level with pretty much everyone else so it would be a perfect fit!
---
Only issue is everyone who competed acknowledged that they won fairly and that's why it took 3 years for people to complain about the statue. Had there been some underhanded tactics used to win they would been made immediately after the clan cup.
---
Looks like he‚Äôs a pledge.
---
‚ÄúHa ha ha, ill hack you again‚Äù
---
Because being frozen for 20 seconds and unable to teleport for the cost of a few thousand in runes ‚Äî and then being destroyed by 10 special attacks isn‚Äôt OP lol
---
Can you consider adding additional requirements to vote on certain polls (mainly those that change existing high-level content)? Eg. the CoX poll will be coming soon, and the vast majority of the player base has never set foot inside. A 1 KC requirement to vote would filter out most of the people who don't understand the implications of each question (and will probably just blindly vote yes to everything).
---
Hopefully ardy will still be the best xp/h, would be too wrong to release a better course that's locked behind a quest.
---
I knew this exact comment would be there even before I looked at comments.
---
Or people simply don‚Äôt use the resources that‚Äôve been developed for instances like this.. e.g. Runewatch, RuneJustice, WeDoRaids discord #ban-list... 10 years ago, we didn‚Äôt have shit like this to track players and record who they scammed or what they scammed. Now we do, people just need to use the resources available if they‚Äôre concerned about potentially getting scammed. 
---
And sure, even then it‚Äôs not 100% that you won‚Äôt get scammed. Try doing things solo if you‚Äôre unwilling to take the risk. 
---
Lootshare wouldn‚Äôt prevent this btw. You‚Äôre thinking of coinshare. 
---
It‚Äôs not melee gear though lol
---
Crystal seeds have been around forever
---
What can you buy from the Void-Knight-being-attacked-by-monsters general store?
---
Even a single additional herb patch destroyed pray pot and herb prices. Think about if 50k people had one more patch, and get 6-10 ranarr's a run with 4 runs in a day. That is a hell of a lot more herbs from simply adding a new herb spot. You can see how quickly one single patch can toss things around.
---
Use NPC speak spell and ask him to repair, takes like 15 secs max and only needs doing once an hour
---
The majority has shifted recently because the playerbase has gotten huge. I think we just want the mods to reign it in a bit because pretty much any buff will pass a poll at this point. An extra herb patch isn't that bad, but the auto-yes votes to buffs are
---
You don't need to get phished to get hacked. This just shows you don't understand it. Information is leaked all the time, and people can easily find your last four digits of your card and your internet provider. Account security is definitely more important than opening an interface without being interrupted. People with common sense should be worried about security regardless of the game/site
---
Big flex
---
What are your thoughts on an upgrade to seercull, either in the new fremmenik quest or maybe as a use for the hydra tail?
---
I just got a pair as well 19th casket! :D gz!
---
It‚Äôs just a troll account. And who knows, maybe one day I‚Äôll pay for a membetship
---
Fuck are you serious?? That‚Äôs sick
---
I also boosted on my main.. however.. I made 6m picking up ammo on my lvl 3 doing it :P
---
Not even jagex cares about account sharing. They've said it multiple times, nobody has been banned unless they buy an infernal (usually a temp ban) or they're competing for hiscores. 
---
That or vene, but that's usually pretty packed. 
---
Hellhounds are not 40k xp an hour average. End of it.
---
&gt;Check Tedious on youtube. 99 slayer is already possible on a level 3 account
---
then do it lol. im almost max and still just train how i want. most of the time what im doing is far from efficient but im still getting gainz more these idiots telling me im not efficient enough lol. my strategy is doing whatever is the most fun for me at the time, which means i play a lot and i enjoy it. rather than doing things i cant stand and not wanting to play and eventually burning out.
---
Mobilize the reddit armada lad
---
He probably spends too much time at the Blue Moon Inn
---
you mean 73
---
They were directly related to each other from what I saw. 
---
Hey, everyone, I just tried to do something very silly! 
---
Yeah but archie also fists himself to pvp so
---
You travel to various points throughout the map to get the diamonds. Someone might be stopping at the GE  to get the required items for the next part of the quest and have a diamond in their inventory.
---
no, *you* don't understand. you allowed yourself to listen to retards on reddit that gave away their recovery info or clicked on double xp streams.
---
i'm not worried because i'm not fucking stupid.
---
That was an awesome clip haha. I didn't hear he got banned for rwt though? 
---
When I first started back in 2005 my friends told me to beware of scammers. So when I tried buying something from a bank sale and I saw that he had notes, I thought he was scamming me and I reported him
---
Meanwhile torvesta makes money with YouTube videos by stream sniping.... which is also ‚Äúagainst the rules‚Äù 
---
Bald cap, green pants, light brown shirt, handlebar mustache and goatee. He will nut instantly 
---
OSRS mobile eel fishing got me through that. Infernals for afk. Sacred eels for cash. Anglers for both.
---
No I only find a weird jester named Cicero 
---
Mfs get so mad about the idea of double xp, like whats the worse that could happen, you get 99 runecrafting and for the rest of the day you can have a life
---
A skilling based minigame that rewards it in high amounts, maybe. Perhaps even the new one that uses Runecrafting as a core mechanic.
---
what rs is turning into p much
---
Crystal Graceful. 
---
Um no its not.
---
that is 2 years ago you idiot, you can't bank them.
---
Oof
---
Here you man. My buddies account was hacked and botted on. It's now banned and he cant get his account back. He wont remake the account because why would you waste more time?
---
I think your raccoon needs a bath
---
What about his pants lol?
---
I think your suggestion of survival is reasonable in theory but we are too far into osrs to just remove two skills and add a new one that does what both of them did. Firemaking has at least progressed enough to be useful at places like wt. I don't support removing rc just because it's slow, at all. Saying a skill should just be completely removed makes no sense because then that will just be said about the next worst skill, then the next worse, and so on.
---
I don't see an issue with having 1-3 slow skills that take along to train but have no requirement to get them high. You can play the game without any issue with having 77 rc and all reasonable perks that you could need from diaries. There's no reason to ruin a skill just because getting like 1m xp in it is too hard, mostly when dozens of large xp lamps exist.
---
I do it so I can get some 99s
---
I want a half xp weekend that at the end it gives you a lamp with the xp you would've gained regularly gained

If the npcs loot drop is offset from its center tile point, the konar drop will appear in a different location than the original drop.
---
It happens with wyrms and some other monsters. It was recently fixed with the kraken boss because you couldn't grab konar items due to them spawning in the water.
---
It wouldnt be a bad idea to have a toggle option for items though. If you have a bone crusher it can be hard to see some of the drops. And even if you arent afk, if you are trying to be efficient, you might look over a drop as well.
---
Theres a lot more to it than just a black and white answer. No need to jump to conclusions about other players.

Pretty sure there are like 3 courses better than Ardy already. I wouldn't mind if this could surpass or rival Ardy if it was more involved. Also, better content locked behind quests is a pretty normal thing.

Unless you're an ironmeme just do fruit tree runs for farming.

I don't think they'll ever do anything with seercull. They have stated on stream that their not pleased with the amount of hoarding and merching attempts that have gone on with that item. I agree with them. If anything they should just improve it's stats/speed to make it better align with the MSB.

Please give us SOME reason to cut logs outside of the woodcutting guild. I really used to enjoy cutting magics in the elven lands and yes outside of catherby. That's some nostalgia.

My suggestion would be to have the Zeah Elites give the +7 bonus outside the WC guild to SELECT tree locations. IE catherby yews, seers magics and not teaks and mohaganys that don't need and xp boost.

No I don't have to stop to watch, I usually follow along guides with 1.25x speed because most people are so slow, but this means that there is never a single second where I have to stand still and wonder what I should do next. It's constant movement.

I think a new cape that buffs the crystal bow would be a good idea, since Ava's isn't really the most useful with it.

Someone mind explaining this as best you can to a new player? Sounds complicated, I dont expect anyone to but I'd appreciate it. I know that skill Cape is something you can buy at lvl 99 and that runecrafting is a skill but that's it.
---
it was supposed to be a repeat thing, they literally did it again the year after and promised statues but then were just too lazy to actually do anything about it
---
Factor in the opportunity cost though, if it is 2-3 faster to spend 25M for it then you will save a shitload of time. That time you could use for something like vorkath or raids for a much better gp rate. If you spend all the time you saved getting 99 RC by paying for lavas on one of those methods you‚Äôll make FAR more gp.

| That's your opinion, but I don't think it's correct. They never said poll results would be yes vs no, they said yes vs all votes.

I think of it as the leaves being more delicate on higher level herbs and requiring more care in preparing them for use.
---
They are clearly operating within the confines of the game, and to compare that to hacking is disingenuous. They're pking in an organized way in the a pking area. There is no in-game mechanic that jagex is granting them that allows them to be where they are- they're just playing the game in a better, more organized way than their opponents. 
---
Again, all it takes is 10 or 15 dudes to organize and go kill them. But if there literally aren't 10 of 15 dudes with 2200 total capable of organization, then clearly rot has something they don't lol.

No they don't.

---
do you have any proof that there was foul play? because i haven't seen any. just because rot might have had foul play at a later point doesn't discredit years of genuinely being a dominant top clan in the game. like them or not they are a competent and organized clan regardless.
---
It's kind of an impossible question to answer because the game is so massive. There are several major quests (off the top of my head: Dragon Slayer 2, Monkey Madness 2, Recipe for Disaster, just to name a few) that unlock access to high level areas/gear/PVM.
---
Mobs aren't as much of a thing as they are in a game like Diablo, it's more different PVM bosses (PVM = player vs. monster. As far as I know it's always been called PVM on RS). Some major examples are barrows, god wars, zulrah, volkrath, ToB, raids, wildy bosses, DKs, etc etc. Those all drop different items and can be huge money makers.
---
Honestly those things I listed are just a small subset of the high level content in RS and most of the things I listed will require pretty high level gear and stats. There is also lots of content that is more directed towards mid-levels.
---
The tutorial wouldn't set your ultra hardcore Ironman mode until the end of tutorial island anyways so it would be faster to just complete it and thieve men and die

Could the Deranged archaeologist drop a mushroom sack to hold mushrooms during sulliuscep woodcutting? It's frustrating having to drop so many mushrooms when they're worth quite a bit, can be a nice alternative to collecting mort myre fungus.

Balance wise maybe it shouldn't be used outside of fossil island, or is untradeable, or requires Bone Voyage to use. 100 odd mushrooms of each type too?

Didn't think about that but that works even better yeah.

Pretty sure he's holding a scythe. So that's quite an alt if it is.
---
I disagree, there are certain skills that are absoulety horrendous to train. If I can automate them, why wouldn't I? I can't spend hundreds of hours doing the same boring thing over and over again, you only get one life man.
---
So you are above the drop rate
---
Yeah as I was reading it, I half expected them to say that after you gather your resources/gear, they pit you against other players. Which would probably also be cool tbh

This concept is Micro-Micro-Efficient

Gathering 15 maxed players at the drop of a hat is not simple and in no way a valid suggestion to counter 24 hour nolifer clans, fucking hell. It's not a reasonable expectation at all  and RoT shouldn't be able to shut down worlds simpmy because they have numbers.

Might be. Only I know that 99% of youtubers have that

Maybe a gothic style rune full helm. I saw a picture of a realistic with dark aestetics awhile back. Not sure if you're an artist or know someone but I think something like that could be subtle but others who dont play the game could still appreciate. It's a medieval helmet.

I used to mine the iron ore south of varrock, walk to Lumbridge to smelt them, then go up to the eastern anvil in varrock and made the them into armor. Then I sold them to the general store and made a solid 100 gp each time. I spent like 10 hours doing this.

---
they had to make a specific case that it wasn't allowed for inferno and add that to the rules. if it was the "same reason" they wouldn't have had to make it clear.
---
account sharing is incredibly common for pking. it's pretty much the only reason it's even allowed at all. if that was the reason and rules that wouldn't be the case. i'm pretty sure the rule is actually about sharing to compete for ranks..
---
even then, i really doubt rot is actually account sharing to hold revs. if you go during peak times of course there is going to be a strong presence. off peak times the hold on caves are probably a lot weaker, but they'll probably have a couple neets there. clans have a lot of members, and rot has a lot of weaponized autism dorks in their clan. just look at the year ehp for tomdabom

Rotation guides just didn't do it for me, I would always fuck up trying to check what rotation I was in and what was next. I learned how to react to what he was doing and the fight just went 100x smoother and eventually I just learned the rotations after killing him a bunch. 
---
Ok lets be real here, do you have any evidence towards rot account sharing? This literally looks like a cry post. All these rot posts are just "fuck rot" (gimme free karma) Where is the proof of account share? surely a clan has men of all time zones.
---
There was a dude in R3 who was handing out money. It was legit too. I couldn't believe it.
---
See this is basically what i said. I don't think Jagex would do that but i know people will cry foul on every poll they felt should not have passed if poll results can't be watched in real time.

---
In the original Runescape fishing was a cake walk for me, its my second lowest skill on this play through.
---
it actually does too. fools were consistently ballista rushing rot when they were in a weak timezone and killing people trying to farm and that plus other stuff did lead to some fights between them which doesn't happen very often. and it's a lot more interesting in the lower total worlds. 1750s are hilarious to harass the pures on and the crappy 2k clan had to fight a bunch of clans to try and keep their hold on it. pking is in a really rough state and anything that makes it easier to find action and to actually encourage clanning is a good thing to help keep it alive

Construction my dude. 
---
First cape i had was 99 and it felt great; having 99 construction after that pretty much changed everything.  I honestly dont really know what I would do without the two. 
---
That being said maybe I'd have better gear if i had invested the 99 con money into pvm instead; but I dont regret that at all.
---
You're a beast. 81 to 91 only netted me one.

IMO the worst part for me is the GP/hr. I might as well go kill regular gargoyles for more $ and less work.

If you‚Äôre looking for afk bossing and lots of money you‚Äôre not going to find it, you have to compromise somewhere. Either you stick to mediocre money or you learn harder things for better rewards.

You can do both zulrah and vorkath with those levels, just look up some guides. It will take a bit to learn them but you can do them efficiently with enough practice.

---
If that's the case, then wouldn't it make sense to just not do them? If 2k+ total world's are all controlled by rot. And you can't use any other world in the whole game because other players, then seems to me irons just shouldn't go to revs. 
---
Or just don't kill the popular monsters like dragon/dark beast. I often kill demons/pyrefiends without anyone interfering.

Hey, if you could update it to be interactive like zulrah guide or zulrah helper, that would be amazing. Already appreciate the work you did on this.

Tbh I‚Äôve thought about buying the gear I need for raids instead of grinding zulrah for 100 hours. I‚Äôve thought about it but I‚Äôm not gonna do it since I‚Äôm broke. I think if I had ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money I‚Äôd probably do it.

Yeah I know. I‚Äôve heard in the past that some people wanted the champions cape to give bonuses. Most people didn‚Äôt want that though thankfully

Buy a lance. Get some barrows armour and generic melee gear and go sit on vorkaths face. Its the fastest way to where you want to be from where you are.

I've not seen many people that do daggonaths in the catacombs, but even if the lighthouse does become too crowded why not add an additional task only section under the lighthouse? They've done it with most other monsters. And yes, I will agree that most monsters don't fit down there, but a lot of them are more or less generic demons/dragons, whereas daggonaths have always been associated with the Fremmenik it seems. 
---
This is besides the point, but to me it felt like they gutted Niece's all in one cave and just replaced it with the catacombs (with additional incentives on top of that) and I'd like to see that place gutted as well. Make monsters more thematic to where they should be.

I mean it's referential. The idea is that you would never say that California is on the East Coast or that New York is on the West Coast. Most Americans have an internalized notion of west/east if they're facing towards the North Pole. I suggested this as a mechanism of knowing whether west is to the left or right. It's basically an alternative to NESW (a clockwise mnemonic for remembering that east is to the "right").
---
On the other hand, the other comment that says "or you could just not be dumb and remember Varrock West Bank and Varrock East Bank" is not helpful at all... that comment is literally what you said -- "west is west and east is east". IMO what I said is somewhat helpful.

There's a buzz-phrase that gets thrown around by virgins(particularly by those that call people, "chads"), when well meaning sexually active people try to give advice. I'm sure you've heard it; Normie advice. These people want nothing more than to end their sexual frustration, they want to become, "Normal". When someone comes around and tells them how they might do so, they dismiss it by pretty much saying, "I'm not normal, don't give me normal advice." Translation: That's too HARD, I want the EASY way out. Don't give me normal advice to become normal, give me abnormal advice to become normal.

Note: No shame in being a virgin, just don't get bitter about it.

What's the actual issue with the blowpipe? It costs quite a lot of scales to use, so even though it's better dps than other weapons it's still fairly balanced.
---
What exactly is the problem with players having access to a high cost, high dps weapon?
---
I understand that some people dislike how ranged is used over magic and melee in many places, but that doesn't mean ranged is necessarily too strong, but rather that some monsters should have their stats be changed so they are more resistant to ranged or less resistant to magic/melee.
---
The most reasonable issue I've seen in regard to the blowpipe is that the type of darts used doesn't have a very big impact on the dps. If that is the case, them it is the interaction of darts with the blowpipe that needs to be fixed, not the overall strength of the entire weapon.

imagine getting paid to protect people at rev caves and then complaining when someone comes to attack you 
---
You say obviously but the numbers don't add up. A 4% dps increase at the cost of ~30% defence and ~12% less damage makes trips shorter and you spend more time eating. Sharks eaten is attacks not taken and its non-trivial when you look at the output of rune dragons.

Rcing isnt any more of an achievement than any of the other 23 skills. Its runescape, nothings hard outside of raids and inferno.

I agree with the guilds could do with an update, but those are long term things that would take a while. This is an update that wouldn't take long at all and would be nice cosmetically. No one is saying take the concentration away from other things when this wouldn't take long at all.
---
Whatever you do we want to see the results 
---
I don't see where the argument is :)
---
Not in each skill, but 1/3rd of EHP for each of the skills, therefor it'll be 1 EHP should you do the minigame.

Oh nice

fletching gives you more rolls on the drop table, so fletching is more loot / less fm xp.

You are more likely (I forgot the percentage) to get the pet after you hit 99 in that skill.

So fortunate that the game rolls for the pet after the xp drop further increasing your odds to get the pet

We're not complaining that "someone is coming to attack us". We're complaining that someone is constant 1 item ragging which constitutes as player harassment. People have been banned for it before, and there's a report option for it. So we're not in the wrong here.

Is this the final draft of Crystal Armor? Ignoring the stats, I'd really like to see a change to the visual of the armor.
---
The chest looks great, but the helmet is to large. Could it look something more akin to a dwarven helmet (but spikier) with the face showing?
---
The legs should wrap all the way around the leg, with gaps on the back of the knee and a kneecap crystal connecting the thigh to the shin. Then add some spikes to that.
---
Keep it thin, so it looks good while using a chally or a cbow. Elves arent just warriors

With bandos you spend much more time eating sharks which loses attacks. Its simple.

Also trips are much shorter.

‚ÄúIt's the only cape with lions on it - that's hardly bland or normal looking imo. We'd be happy to update it but this is the first I've heard about it being lackluster and the asset it currently uses was specifically asked for when it was suggested by the community‚Äù

Oof. Sorry sir. There's nothing they can do with an instance.
---
please consider giving us some more diverse usage for crystal armor than mediocre tank armor w/ an obby set style effect. you know nobody gonna be ranging with crystal bow in melee tank armor or choosing to DPS with crystal hally.
---
suggestions:  
---
give it a recoil like effect, this way it it's tankiness stands in it's way with recoil DPS. maybe even offer negative offensive bonuses to really suggest that its main function is recoil 
---
give it an overheal effect, I think as important DPS is over tank armor in the current meta, it wouldnt be THAT broken to give like, a +10 or +15 HP pool to eat up over. currently guthans with amulet of the damned heals up to 10 hp over your max hitpoints &amp; i think if this minigame is gonna be on teir of difficulty w/ tob it's well earned.
---
give us accuracy armor, even if its, for example just a +16 stab for the whole set it'll give crystal armor a purpose instead of just being a more expensive barrows set without an effect.  
---
some things to consider I think it'll be fair for the challenge it takes to get cystal armor
---
oof

You could always go to the Burthrope slayer master and cancel the task. It does reset your streak though.

At the moment, when you feed your pet kitten, you can simply use the food on the cat and a message appears in the game text "The kitten gobbles up the fish". However, when giving it attention, you have to right click and interact with the kitten, then select stroke, and then a pop up message comes up saying it enjoyed it, which interrupts what you are doing. Please can a right click stroke be added, and the text from the pop up moved to be in the game chat?

Thank you for the reply, I'll check those out.

I posted about the [Hydra tail cape](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/al5u8v/hydra_tail_cape_suggestion/) in a separate post. Would like to see the highest level slayer boss not drop dead content items on release!
---
There is anvils in Varrock. Roam around the cities and talk to the shop owners and see what they have to offer
---
There was literally a post today with 2kc bow haha
---
Conchoidally :)
---
Ive tried it around your level and I maybe got 30k xp
---
This is the most fun part of the game. Most of us had a friend pull us in, and show us all this stuff.
---
There's a lot of content in this game. Try to concentrate on certain aspects only, at first. Anvils and furnaces are far apart on purpose to make it harder to level the skills. You're better off mining first, then smelt everything and then smith in the end. Check the minimap, for the best locations.
---
If you've got any questions, ask away!
---
Nope, its meth
---
It's better if not just as good as fire cape at kalphite queen. Fire cape gives more (like 0.1) dps when just whacking with bludgeon but mythical cape gives ~1% more accuracy on your dwh spec which is worth more than the tiny amount of damage

... Take your upvote...

oh look this post again

I didn't complain once. I work 60-84 hours a week, and I did death runes. I was just attempting to give an insight on to how people don't maintain that level of xp/hr.  Falling asleep/getting distracted/planning next skill/eating/normal life shit.

It wouldn't matter if it had higher ranged defence because you arent going to be using either to defend yourself against ranged attacks in a serious situation.

- I love Aerial Fishing, but due to the exp rates there isn't much incentive to continue it after getting all the rewards. What do you think of being able to trade Molch Pearls for fishing exp or a small amount of gp, to make the activity a little more more worthwhile?
---
- What are the team's thoughts on Karuulm Themed Obsidian and Dragonhide armour Konar's Drop table? They could act as melee and ranged equivalents to the new mystic robes, creating a sense of the Proposed Loot Keys accessing the Khalith's personal armoury.
---
- Would it be possible to add a Hops patch to the farming guild, perhaps north of the cactus patch (or between the west wing and redwood area)? A door could lead to it being 'outside' the guild if the community dislikes the idea of adding hops to the contract list.
---
- Could The wander radius of the Lizardmen in Molch be kept slightly further away from the path around the village to the farming guild? Being poisoned is an hassle when travelling to Ariel Fishing. Alternatively, Alry could offer to 'patch you up' and cure it.

I really hope they dont go overboard with the crystal. Just give it crystal claws, fangs, and maybe some spikes blended with fur.

How are you?

he sounds pretty nased

Seriously though. Fuck that racist, sexist commercial and gillette shitty products.

You should probably just let him PvM on those 2k worlds or pay him for off or something? Seems like he's really getting to you and your friends and that's not good for your mental wellbeing.
---
They seriously need to expand the crystal tools. The problem is they locked the equipment to dragon tool upgrades, so getting something like a Crystal fishing rod or chisel is a tough thing to do.
---
Combining a crystal equipment seed with a DWH for a crystal hammer to train smithing wouldnt work out so well...

I use my thieving level to steal an upvote from you.
---
Yesssssss
---
I can not fucking believe that they even rose lmao. Like I get it, most of the time jagex i vague about the feasibility of the buff--especially when they're just acknowledging a buff request in the q/a stream--which causes them to rise as the hoarders dump to the fish, but this time they explicitly provided enough information to definitively confirm that they will not be worth more after this update. "You'll get the dragon items back when the tool degrades." Do you know what that means??? That means that the prices will 100.0% not be higher on release than they were yesterday before it was announced. Whoever is buying these right now is doing so out of greed and they'll get what they deserve, possibly within 24 hrs because this one isn't going to be like previous ones. 
---
It's called holding down worlds, a lot of clans do that against pkers. And a lot do the same thing RoT do and sell protection. 
---
pretty good. Weather has been bad here but work is going well. how about you?

Do other pvp clan try to overthrow clans that try to control certain rev cave worlds?

Oh shit, you're right, my bad.

All combat xp should be stored inside your inventory inside experience pouches, once you get 28 you need to click to empty them before you can continue gaining xp.

You're not wrong logically, but semantically, "not very good" is often used to express displeasure and a distaste. As in, worse than neutral. Not bad is the opposite, it's used to express better than neutral.
---
So are there not that many of them, or is it a thing so common it has a name? 
---
No this is Patrick

Him, maybe: Do my homework and I'll runecraft 1 hour for you.

Me, if I was still in school: Sold. So, how many classes do you have?
---
Ardy is only 5k XP/hr better at max efficiency at 90+, and due to pies being temporary you will fail a lot between 85-90 making the gap even closer unless you go through pies like a maniac. It's better, but only marginally so while much more intense.

I'd argue that given how much 3rd party clients already comply with jagex's desires, them going out of their way to add that seems pretty unlikely.
---
Please give us the ability to click the Special Attack orb to perform a special attack when outside of PVP. It makes Slayer tedious to keep switching tabs every few seconds for weps that have 25% specs. 
---
His point is that white thing... He used it to point at stuff.
---
God did you even watch the video? 
---
Could you imagine showing this desktop footage to 10 yr old self back in 2004
---
I mean, that depends on the skill. Yes, a lot of skills have been expanded, new methods were added, etc. Like for firemaking, everyone's doing Wintertodt, which is a skilling boss (Minigame-ish.) Agility is all about rooftop courses. For Prayer you can bury in the wilderness, which is better than the gilded altar. A lot of people do mining in Motherlode Mine, which is a really chill alternative power mining.
---
Combat cannot be summed up, there's just so many items and gear that's been added. But the thought process is largely the same as it used to be, just with way more variety.
---
As the other guy who deleted his comment for some reason said:
---
&gt;You're not wrong, but semantically, "not very good" is often used to express displeasure and a distaste. As in, worse than neutral. Not bad is the opposite, it's used to express better than neutral.
---
I couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I'll add you tomorrow sounds awesome! I'm going to sleep now its midnight here. But about the coins, I'd feel really bad if I'd accept them so I don't wanna sound rude or something, but I kinda wanna earn the items myself by trading/fighting etc. :/

I was talking about RoT because that is the topic. There are more than one clan out there. And why is it an issue if they do hold down worlds? There's literally so many worlds not all clans in rs will hold them down every single day.

Let us add tags to items in our bank e.g. search bank for 'mele' will return all the gear ive added the tag 'mele' to.

I realize, I haven't covered the rest of your post. Basically try every skill, feel them out. There will be some that you love and others that you hate. You'll probably want to do a few quests here and there, they give experience and other rewards. There are a ton of awesome items/spells locked behind them, so it's definitely worth it!
---
You'll recognize that each skill progresses, you unlock higher level stuff every few levels. Most of this game is setting goals for yourself and then completing them. It sounds super boring put into words but it can be addictive as hell.

Why does the current suggestion for the Gauntlet have unsafe death for UIM's and HCIM's since a 'unsafe' death in here would be of no consequence at all for other accounts, since nothing was brought to be lost to begin with.

around 250k gp an hour. and idk about polln tbh. id just get diary for seers if you plan to bust a ton of agl out, but if 73 is your goal then either or is still fine. the diff wont be much

I'll have to try this more; I'm realllllly not a fan of Thieving training but I might enjoy levelling more if it's a neat minigame instead of "roll the dice and see if you get stunned this time".

Is there any chance we can see Demonic Gorillas added to Konars Slayer tasks after MM2?
---
Either by being assigned directly or by having Black Demons assigned in the crash site caverns?
---
They're the main thing i miss being able to do from duradel and Nieves tasks that you can't get from konar.
---
;)
---
The real question is; is nothing something? Does he first have get rid of nothing before he start from something?
---
Dress up as Nieve. He'll lose his mind.
---
Oh for sure. I don't mind people failing or sucking, if they try and stick with it, a decent team can carry easily and the bad player will pick it up really quickly.
---
It's when, as you said, people quit after 1 round (both noobs and experienced impatient players) or worse when they quit during the run and everyone needs to reset.

Grapes are already super cheap, would they even be worth doing if everyone was doing them?

To heaven, with rngezus

There's over 7k difference between diary seers and ardy, and there's absolutely nothing intense in staying buffed. You just equip a bit of prayer bonus gear, put preserve on, and it's a literal non issue.
---
Ardy is better at 85, and not just marginally. It's way better.
---
Most RoT members probably find real life too hard to handle due to the high activity requirements

That's east slayer music

This is the reason I'm on this subreddit

Afk is generally used to mean "don't have to pay attention to it"

Agility is "afk" because you almost completely ignore the game

If you want to learn how to no honour hybrid, the best account to use is a ‚Äúbaby pure‚Äù, an acount around 60-70 combat, with 85 magic for teleblock. You‚Äôll die a lot, but deaths are only about 70k at a time, and a lot of people make these accounts to learn on, so the people you‚Äôll be fighting are likely to be more at your skill level. Look up on youtube the baby pure videos by Purpp and Chunk for guides and pk videos.
---
To get better, you‚Äôve just got to practice. When you see pk videos on youtube, these people have been pking for years, and have thousands of kills behind them. You don‚Äôt get to see the time spent getting to that point.
---
The people with full bandos and obby capes are funny either way. That combo is almost always accompanied with a combat bracelet.

that's slayer, which makes it okay. Not some gay ez-scape shooting star that gives boosted xp

There was something about RuneHQ that just never appealed to me. I know it was the go to website, but it just felt bulky and really poorly designed. Something about Zybez was just inviting and easy to follow. Really making me nostalgic with these thoughts lol.

The crystal tools should consume the dragon item too, dragon axes would be worth something again

I've been talking about this for years to an apathetic community. The real answer you're looking for here is that these buffs are only requested out of greed; when the dust settles the items revert to their old price, most people still don't want to use them, and jagex wasted time doing something that harmed the game's integrity. 
---
One fun thing I like to do is ctrl f "thamm" in every q/a thread. Every single week for the past year someone has posted begging for thammarons sceptre to be buffed. As time has gone on they've gotten more and more desperate and they've poured immense amount of time into thinking up creative ways to get the community to talk about it. Seriously, type in "sceptre" into the search bar and see for yourself. And for what? Do you think anyone really cares this much about a thammaron's sceptre? The only way you care this much is if you have your entire cash stack invested in them, and maybe you bought at 6m and you're panicking now that they're 4m. And how many people like that do you think there are in every q/a thread? How many items have been buffed not out of integrity but for greed?
---
No where just the official website and the client
---
Put the ! At the front
---
Can't really get literal with phrases that are taken in specific context. As an anecdote, I've never heard "it's not very good" as a positive phrase. I've only heard it used to denote the meaning "this is worse than I expected" where "it's not bad" was used to mean "it's better than I expected". 
---
Without adding anything extra to either phrase (like "but it's still bad"), I take them to mean what I described above.
---
For exp yea, 40 minutes to grow, 625 check-health exp, and 40exp/harvest (3-42 according to wiki based on level)
---
There are 12 places as well, so you could be looking at an extra 7.6-9.2k exp each herb/allotment run you make
---
The hardest part about jad is that you don't get to practice at all on the boss until an hour into the game. You just need to have more practice sadly. It does get easier.

At that point just add transmog or glamor to the game already.

Was the biggest criticism I had of this as well, and of course had normie backlash saying why should they nerf the content for us HCIM's and UIM's where in actuality the content is being tailored against UIM's and HCIM's and ultimately has no effect on normal accounts at all.

Sure, but that's still only one scenario, hence why I said "multiple scenarios". I think you should have many scenarios in which it is bis to justify making a max cape out of it. Not to mention the only reason to farm KQ is for the pet and infernal cape is still better than myth cape. So not only is it a piece of content that barely anyone does, but it still isn't bis. Is the argument that we should have a max cape for all "2nd bis" items then? I'm sorry, but I am just not feeling this one. My mind is unchanged. Mythic max cape still seems pointless.

Unpopular opinion, but Revenants are PvP content. They‚Äôre in the Wilderness. The PKers, while they do have a terrible reputation, have literally *only* this. Like that is *their* content.

It's not that 5b is melee middle, it's that 5b doesn't happen.

I know the underwater thieving is ehp post 99 but the xp seemed really bad for me at 80/80. I think the fact that it scales so heavily towards 99 makes it uninviting. I love VM though, not sure why so few people do it.

TL;DR 
---
What is the intended use for the new crystal armor? Will it be good anywhere other than tanking bandos gwd? Can we see a 1-handed crystal mace that may be buffed with a hydra tail and a magic staff which boosts magic accuracy against players. 
---
It looks like the armor just has BIS range defense without a negative magic defense, making it some of the best tank gear for General Graardor, which would make it fairly desirable. 
---
The armor special effect seems like an attempt to make crystal weapons more viable, however the c hally is useless besides the spec, and bringing a 4 way switch in place of dragon claws doesn't sound appealing. I'm doubting this will make the crystal bow stronger than blow pipe, and with the recharges I'm not sure if it will even be a cheaper alternative? Perhaps to make it more appealing add a crystal mace and staff? 
---
Could we see a 1 handed crystal mace with with stat bonuses of 62 crush , 58 str, and 7 prayer, placing it slightly above a dragon mace but below the d-scim. Consider allowing a hydra tail to be wrapped around the mace. The spiky bones of the hydras tail would cause more damage to be done with each hit, however would de-balance the mace making it somewhat less accurate, while enhancing the prayer bonus of the mace (stats subject to balancing). The mace could be created and degrade similar to the suggested crystal armor or the old equipment, however the hydras tail would remain upon degradation and be removable at anytime (and dropped when pk'd).
---
Why are there no magic crystal weapons? There should be a crystal staff which could have +20 magic accuracy and perhaps a 5-10% damage boost making it more useful than plain staffs but less so than higher tiers like SoTD without the armor. However when used with the full crystal armor it could boost spell accuracy significantly such as +50% while reducing damage by ~30-50% so that its useful when freezing opponents, but will not change the barrage/slayer metas. The staff could be obtainable/ degradable similar to the armors suggested or the old crystal equipment.

Can you PLEASE add another use for Kurask/other slayer monster heads? I‚Äôve gotten 4 Kurask heads in 2k KC and it‚Äôs kinda depressing just seeing them sitting in my bank. Even just turning them in for some additional Slayer xp would do.

Imagine when full-dive VR is a thing and instead of real life we all opt for Runescape level graphics lmaooo.

Can the loot broadcast in the Chambers of Xeric be changed to "A bright purple light shines for \[player\]". Then broadcast the loot once they actually open it? I love the tension and excitement of getting a drop in the Theatre of Blood without knowing what it is.

Ooh I‚Äôm down for that, sign me up

So you're actually trying to argue that someone who doesn't even try and "cant" put in a few hours here and there should be allowed to progress at the same rate and receive the same rewards as someone who does try and/or can put the time in? And if someone does put in the time, then they aren't living a "normal life"? Fuck off with all of that. Plenty of people put in the time and effort in this game and still maintain fulfilling jobs and have families and all that other shit. In fact, if you can only put in a few hours here and there, that is even MORE incentive to be an efficiency fiend when you do get to play. It really sounds like you fundamentally don't understand the MMO genre or the people who play it, and are trying to make excuses for someone else's laziness

No it‚Äôs not, afk is used to mean something that takes minimal clicks or goes by itself.

Woodcutting is AFK because your character woodcuts a full inventory with one click. Agility is not AFK because each individual click = xp gain.

is there any chance of being able to mount your kharedst memoirs once full in your poh for cost of some amount of charges to allow unlimited teleports similar to the xerics talisman and glory etc

If I recall correctly there was a memory leak in the gpu plugin but I doubt it could cause fast spikes.

Dps wise its very similar to blowpipe but with crossbow you dont need to bgs spec or pray mage. This way you take a lot less damage and get up to 7 kills per trip and save a lot of time banking. With crossbow you can equip a dragonfire shield, because of this you can pray range as his range attack is more common than the mage attack.

I love it.  I love that time was taken to create this.
