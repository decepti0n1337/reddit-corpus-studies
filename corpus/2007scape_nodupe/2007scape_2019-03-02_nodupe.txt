Jagex is owned by a Chinese company yet where is my asian server?
---
---
---
These are pretty much everywhere, gargoles, kurasks all profit slayer mobs are pretty much botted to death
---
sending you my rng fam! u will for sure get it soon
---
Seems quite likely
---
Bro what???? You do know that just clicking on a stream wont do anything to you right? Clicking on anything in the description will . Rofl ....
---
I did get Prime again and did get my 14 days, thanks though. Split the cost with a friend and connected with Amazon Household, works out pretty well
---
Do monkey madness 2 asap or u have no balls
---
What's a dice bot? 
---
Why doesnt jagex care this definitely has to do with ranarr seeds crashing wich in turn hurts actual players 
---
Does this include doing all clue scrolls received? 
---
And then all 4 people who were actually playing it can continue playing, and the million people that claim they played it all the time can continue ignoring its existence forever!
---
I haven't played in seven years, but this sounds amazing. 
---
It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôll look pretty suspicious getting the cape in 1 attempt 
---
If it brings in more players I'm all for it
---
That dev? Andrew Gower.
---
Bond is healthy mtx. Everything else is unhealthy mtx in comparison. 
---
I got it and then I used it to get the notes. I then dropped the notes later (to free up space) once I realized I've already put them to use from talking to the King about them which prompted the twig conversation. 
---
Why not bring back all of those old prayers, I forgot what they were though but I thought they were cool 
---
There are a lot of factors. Distance, server equipment, client equipment, internet speed, etc. I‚Äôd say 45 ping on runescape is pretty good. Companies like Blizzard and Microsoft obviously have much more resources to devote to their side so you‚Äôll see better connections to them. 
---

---
As far as things you can affect, probably your WiFi/Ethernet Card or adapter, ISP speed, and making sure other running programs aren‚Äôt downloading and uploading a lot of data. 
---
Champions aren't balanced by price lol

shit man i havent played in a couple of weeks so i guess that is why i missed it :/

---
That's what's great about his guides is if you're not slacking you never have to pause except in the first 2 minutes to gather materials. You bring up his quest and watch the vid start to finish and you're done. 
---
Mtx that can:
---
* Boost your xp/hr (by doing faster things)
---
* Can skip a lot of content by skipping all gp farming
---
* Allows you to buy power.
---
I would argue that its better than not having bonds, but i mean, it's very much a big mtx. I don't have stockholm syndrome at all.
---
Lmao that looks like so much fun dude you're awesome 
---
I try my best to stay up to date, but how does something like this pass? I ruined a 4 year old pure b/c of something out of my control... Not really a fair update if you ask me
---
They're probably using the same system they have been using since the start of RS2. They're in desperate need for an upgrade, but good luck getting the Chinese overlords to pay for that.
---
I love when someone crashes my low level pure thinking I'll get bullied but then I come on my maxed main in Max str gear and two shot whatever crab they are on. It always ends hilariously
---
Honor. Now I can't go to rev caves for 2 mins without getting tb'd, barraged, and triple AGS'd by 4 dudes all smiting me. "Honor" is overrated but still, jeez. How is that even fun lol
---
I'm getting off work tonight at 9. I haven't played hardcore in over 9 years. I started a character a few days ago on osrs and am going to buy members tonight. Where should I start and what should I do? I'm so lost. I used to have my dad and mom to guide me around but now I'll be alone and just need a little guidance without being overwhelmed. 
---
I'll take a pass on the eccentric billionaires. The odds become too high they'll get bored, strap all the game servers to a rocket, and shoot them off to some other planet.
---
Maybe he doesn't have a second account with membership he could drop it to. Might as well get the 60k than just dropping it to some random.
---
I currently have 173 hespori seeds. can you add a gold sink there you take 25 hespori seeds and 1M cash and it can be used on the flower outside of hespori cave to revive hespori
---
Whats that do?
---
Im from Australia and I primarily play on German worlds. The ping really isn‚Äôt that bad.. 
---
Didnt see this in my feed like I thought I would. Yesterday was a bit... Messy. 
---
I really like it. Neives butt is really off. But the mesh work is pretty good. It doesn't feel like a texture is painted over I feel a bit of the depth
---
I‚Äôm all for these suggestions regarding new servers in countries with a large playerbase, but as someone working in the IT industry myself, I don‚Äôt think you should get your hopes up. I doubt Jagex has the kind of money to implement new servers in countries they don‚Äôt already have a presence in. This is probably the reason that the ‚ÄúAustralian‚Äù worlds are actually in the United States. 
---
Bump us up to $12 and maybe we have a chanceÔøº...üòÇ
---
All bow before the legendary SwampIetics.
---
Teleporting was definitely NH within the pure community at least.   I pk mods i got kicked from foe for glory teleing from a NH brid iirc.
---
Please god let it be true 
---
i don't give one single fuck about people who lost their stuff, have fun rebuilding 
---
Mods don't read this thread
---
Yesterday's update accidentally included a tbow spawn where that bush is now. Naturally, players started looting them and Jagex rolled back the servers to before the update. When they patched the tbow spawn they put a twisted bush there instead.
---
You can't burn RuneScape servers at the border, so it might be viable international aide.
---
if I'm not mistaken, 45 unlocks blackjacking. Do that.
---
I've also always liked the idea of making the hill giants in the lava maze a fire giant. This would make it so that f2p players/ironman have a way of getting a rune scimitar except from smithing one. This would also fit the 'lava' maze better and would make the wilderness a more scary place in f2p. Right now when i'm traversing the wildy I just use f2p worlds as they are mostly empty in higher level wild. Another pking hotspot would be cool have in f2p.
---
Waterfall Quest and Witch's House will get you instantly up to 30 str/atk and 23 HP. I'd suggest working on quests as a good way to ease in and start seeing what you're feeling and go from there.
---
Pay dirt!
---
Can I change my interface from [this](https://imgur.com/a/lrJgdVv) to [this](https://imgur.com/a/hDuw0JE) on RuneLite?
---
[removed]
---
It‚Äôs the iron knight uprising! Help us!! Summon the white knights!
---
pyramid plunder until 45 then it's blackjacking til 91
---
Fucking same
---
Depends on the target. Generally if they're weak to crush but strong against slash (Gargs for example) battleaxe will be better.
---
yea
---
A large % of players have never tried bh or pvp world ge/Camelot pking and will never understand this necessary mutual agreement. 
---
Not really. If your magic level is 75-94 the best spells to cast at barrows are fire wave or charged god spells. They are more dps than trident, and much more cost efficient than toxic trident with almost equal dps.
---
Fire wave costs tome of fire charges, whereas god spells costs charge + extra blood rune. God spells costs slightly more, and you have to keep up charge buff, but you get to use a better shield slot.
---
isnt that essentially what DMM is lol
---
If it makes you feel any better I did an elite today got 23k. Followed by a hard with a rangers hat in it so yea. Rng 
---
This is a reasonable reason. But that does not explain why it was a persistent spawn. He had to have added a twisted bow item spawn to the ground, rather than a twisted bush. And most likely those are two wildly different assets in game, 
---
Seeing as one is an equip-able usable, animated piece of gear. And one is an un-interactable piece of foliage. 
---
Upgrading is definitely worth it!
---
*zoomers*
---
*dismiss sandwhich lady*
---
Using Omega lol unironically might be a bigger concern.
---
what about casting claws with void mace would that be considered a guthix item
---
That's a paddlin'.
---
If you've got Iban's blast, you should be good to go. Just wear your best tank gear, magic damage boosting items, and probably a d scim for ahrim and your kill count in the tunnels.
---
Lmfao this is amazing
---
Yes even an upgrade to steel will yield a significant difference. On my btw I trained hunter and caught implings for a bit of fun. I was able to get a mithril pick from doing so, definitely a good method if you are low combat.
---
woosh xd
---
It's over 60k xp/hr at 55+ (summer pies) making it A LOT faster than any other course and it's still about 6-7k xp per hour faster than no-tick loss ardy. So it's not barely more, that's like an 11% increase :D
---
Fuck it, all of them.
---
Then he invites you under his bed to find his old barbarian rod...
---
Distributed systems are hard 
---
You should tell them about the 40%.
---
Is ghorrock tele faster/safer than burning ammy to kbd? I haven't had much trouble in 700kc but was just wondering 
---
I havent done ds2.
---
I'm a programmer and honnestly, I totally understand how mistake like that happend. It happend everyweek at my office, and we're not some code monkey.
---
Each "normal" item seem to respawn each minute on the ground, i don't know what seem to be weird about it.
---
Nah yall fuckers invented Jaja.
---
Stay laggin
---
This is true, and I could see this being the case, a mod wanted to test some combat features so they drop a T-bow on the ground to pick up and test. A few flaws in your theory. 
---
1. why not spawn the item in your invent I have seen the way the mods do things, placing an item spawn on the ground so they can pick it up is not the way they use mod potatoes.
---
2. what combat is he testing next to the farming guild
---
3. if you answered the boss below, why would he be spawning the gear in that place, it just doesnt make sense. 
---
4. if you think they wanted to test picking items up off the ground. that is a stretch theory, as this has been tested by players thousands of times on live servers with no issues, this isnt something any mod would be "testing" its already been tested
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes for you. We get good ping now
---
I clicked on the link in the description.
---
Would make RWT sites go bankrupt aswell lol.
---
we do now, they finally gave us servers and it made the game playable again
---
This could be interesting if it has the charm of OSRS
---
You could buy XP before bonds via RWT.  Bonds change nothing.  
---
No
---
I hope CD Projekt Red will buy them, but doubt it will happen...
---
Thanks I worked real hard on it 
---
shhhh :P
---
I only use it for logging in, i'm not smart enough to program anything else.
---
Definitely do Witch's House first though. The moss giants have a max hit of 14 or something like that, so they can one-hit you if your HP is lower than that.
---
I was at work and my colleague and I wanted to google some work-related thing on my computer. Out of habit, I typed in the keyword and instinctively added ‚Äúrunescape‚Äù at the end without even thinking. I hit Enter and then realised wtf im at work lol
---
Time for a re roll
---
Yea the max cash thing, I said was logical was a bit of humor, and in all honesty, while a logical mistake, logical mistakes are the best way to hide malicious intent. 
---
It just as easily couldve dropped max air runes, but it had to be cash. 
---
Probably agility because run energy is prevalent in nearly every aspect of this game: PVM (raids, inferno, etc.), questing, skilling (blast furnace, runecrafting, farm runs, etc.)
---
*are the master race*
---
Are you allowing GE or is it going to be essentially an ironman run?
---
This never gets old
---
just move to UK lmao
---
F for not getting the karils top and guthans helm. Better luck next time
---
fresh pasta
---
It's a hybrid of that and the blue wizard (g) haha
---
Perfect idea. Keep the Spaniards from stealing my resources and replying ‚ÄúEspanol? :v‚Äù when I tell you to fuck off 
---
My brain bro...
---
no problem newfriend
---
But it‚Äôs one handed making using an anti dragon shield possible for ranged, and giving options
---
Yeah the inflation will make it worthless.
---
Something tells me this man also has a fascination for pointy sticks, handled with one or two hands. It doesn't matter to him, aslong as he gets paid.
---
Looks like irl brainlets lmao
---
‚ÄúFuck this shit I‚Äôm out‚Äù
---
lol. i get that reference
---
Eh I just did it the other day and my strategy was just to aggro a zombie onto me. Its single combat so as long as you're a little careful, you're fine.
---
There are no dragons in F2P apart from Elvarg. Which options otherwise? Wielding a shield doesnt make up for the fact that you are hitting 70% less.
---
Always brown hair and brown eyes, generally strong facial features 
---
You don't need an agility level, do you?
---
That‚Äôs because the cosmetic items cost a fucking arm an a leg yet they don‚Äôt even fit correctly on half of the models. 
---
You're basically not allowed to make rune scim drop in f2p
---
Okay if you are a programmer I will argue using that, a few things. If you were making a blunder like that, with something as impactful as a twisted bow. You'd most likely be careful. I am a software engineer, and I know when I am working with things that can totally break everything.  I make sure to read the entire line I typed. 
---
Also, if as a dev I looked at my screen and saw, huh, this doesnt look like the bush I meant to place, instead it looks like I accidentally spawned the best ranged weapon! Barring some EXTREME laziness, this is a mistake you would catch yourself. 
---
Congrats!!!
---
Lo :D
---
??? If thats your first pet you cant have barrows gloves. If you have not done gertrudes cat you can not have barrows gloves. If you have done gertrudes cat then this is not your first pet
---
Couldnt op have done something better with the pickaxe than get its alch value? Like gift himself bonds from an alt or something or even just drop it around some noobs for some good laughs?
---
That bug was an incorrect overflow check when converting items to coins to death. It couldn't really have generated anything except coins.
---
Goblin boi tries to invade lumbridge
---
Praise Guthix!
---
AFAIK, with the lower agility or hard fremy not completed, it‚Äôll just teleport you to the bottom of the agility shortcut. I don‚Äôt think agility is required to make the portal. 
---
It would be interesting to see if boosting agility and using the portal would put you at the top. 
---
You paid for your first 99? How could you disrespect yourself like that
---
thanks for the help!
---
You can't buy  Treasure Hunter‚Ñ¢ keys with  RuneCoins‚Ñ¢ .

Wow man you definitely could have scammed more than 73 b2p tabs you yerb

settled just committed suicide. thanks. 
---
Nah I actually ping great in many other Canadian based servers. It's not lack of speed, I get 200 down and 80 up. It just has to ping through so many different areas to connect to the RuneScape servers, it's weird imo. I wasn't necessarily bitching, I just know prior to EOC there were Canadian servers, would be nice to meet some fellow Canadians as well as have a decent ping
---
This was a nice comment to see at the end of a long and stressful work day, so thank you!
---
I didnt say anything about a zgs so im assuming you were part of it
---
I once had two of them and the thermo nuclear all in the same barrage stack, insanely rare but cool to see
---
Pure essence
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a server like this in rs2? I remember going to these worlds to do stuff that was busy in the primary worlds but I couldn‚Äôt read anything in them
---
&gt;black bar
---
no its not, he is spending 3 more cad for premier then for 12 month
---
I was expecting 99 magic from the alch
---
Oh now that's a damn good one 
---
Pretty much as you said, only as a pvp finisher or on non-boss slayer monsters. It's nice to have on task if you already use it for pvp, for a tiny increase in xp but completely unnecessary, I wouldn't go out of my way just to get one for slayer unless I was rolling in gp and had nothing else to buy, more of a collectors item  in that case.
---
Give them 10 worlds, why not?
---
u/originxyz probably approves
---
Imagine spending money on a game where not one but two of the developers have been exposed as crooks who steal money from the game through intentional bugs and after their firing (((coincidences))) like the TBOW bug keep happening
---
Good try boy-o but I was part of aps back in 2006. 3 damage increase to the max hit of range won't do much. At the very least people could make low level range tanks which would be annoying to deal with but not game breaking. The same meta for over 13 years is not a good thing, try to keep up with progress; mmkay pumpkin.
---
Lmao gf bank
---
He has grandfathered rates. I said it is cheaper unless you are paying grandfathered rates. There is no grandfather rate for premier so it costs more
---
You and your boys? Sounds gay 
---
WAIT THAT IS NOT ALLOWED!!
---
.. jamflex
---
Personally I'd pay 12 dollars per month if mod ash personally sent me a sample of his semen ever month. I mean that in it's self is worth at least 15 dollars alone.
---
If you get membership you're not going to use blurite crossbows lmao. The point is that it's useless in p2p, it might see some use in f2p. Not sure if it's a good idea, but I can agree it is dead content atm.
---
That's because Boaty doesn't bot views. I think.
---
you can't read either. I was relating information from 1 specific video. Not every single video makes that same amount of gold and therefore irl money. Not every video is relevant to the conversation as you certainly can't earn enough to live in Venezuela off chaos druids or something. Get some reading comprehension retard 
---
I don't get these arguments. I'm not going to stop paying or burn shit to protest. It's frustrating though when they can afford to fix things that we've been complaining about for years, but they don't. It would be nice if they stopped fucking up the larger of their only two games.
---
Yes there was
---
D
---
200k? Where did you get that figure from? 
---
Really proud of Jagex for this one.
---
Imagine not paying the farmer with noted items
---
Tbow
---
Alright. I‚Äôm pretty lost on what to do here.
---
I never got a whip before, so I did a lot of slayer and afk sand crabs, and finally got it.
---
But, I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I‚Äôve never gotten to this point in game (combat wise).
---
Should I AFK NMZ? Should I do some slayer with Nieve? Should I do the requirements so I can afk rock crabs on fossil island? Should I level up ranged or magic? I don‚Äôt have fighter torso or barrow gloves, are they worth getting?
---
I‚Äôm pretty lucky in that I have 5-10m to dumb into levelling, thought I‚Äôd prefer not to spend it.
---
Here‚Äôs my [stats]( https://i.imgur.com/BWzXE8t.jpg)
---
I can‚Äôt tell you any other game that has a login system like this. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with security. I think it‚Äôs an outdated system that needs to be fixed. 
---
You're the type of asshole to rise the prices of dragon d pick. I hope you step on dog shit and track it all over your room 
---
There's no reason to believe that as far as I can tell.
---
what? was the joke supposed to be that it \*wasn't\* swampletics? because that's not that funny.
---
None of those tweets concern making an offline backup. And I have seen no evidence that doing a complete backup while the game is offline would overload servers or cause corruptions. Why would it? The game is not running... Sounds like that came out of your ass tbh. And stop being a stuck up prick, your claims don‚Äôt stand up at all 
---
Anything really I'll take a look at it! 
---
Is this real? lol
---
WHAT THE F-
---
btw may i require with my favorable question to ask you for your pretty magical level of higness, sir?
---
Dont play the game myself but would think that ancestral bottoms are used more than claws on ironman ? 
---
Ok but what fuzzy nugget replied with has nothing to do with what Marrowgar was saying about dragon bones.... 
---
Ikr and you don't have to rely on rare drops. It's like cutting trees. Idk why everyone hates them and people who farm them.
---
So glad you can bones to peaches again
---
Grats. Glad you got your stuff back
---
Nearly everyone on this sub knows of that lure and knows the scammers give a zgs to gain confidence in the victim. Next time don't be a dumbass and think "anti-scamming" is a good thing to do. If it sounds too good to be true, then it's too good to be true.

I offer $11
---
Wouldnt birdhouses while training other stuff be more efficient?
---
No it's just such a common scam people actually know what happens.
---
You just roll however many servers you have to the same point in the changelogs. It doesn't matter how long it takes to backup or how many servers you have. You have a timesync for those servers so you know what time each thing happens, and you keep a changelog of everything that happens. Match timestamps and you're done.
---
I'm sure it's a mess over there, my point is just that it doesn't have to be, and no matter the amount of SQL servers syncing backups is not that hard.
---
Big nuggs 
---
Stop trying to attack me
---
Did you literally just try to flip the script without noticing your first fucking sentence in your first comment. lul ok mate. It's not a major change like you think it to be.

Due to the roll back, Op was unable to reclaim his grave and lost items.

I admire the persistence my man. Free karma too lol

I have p2p accounts but my f2p accounts are more fun to me, idk why. I'm way more excited about getting new content in f2p than in p2p lol

So username with digits in it equals bot? I know this is how a robot in real life would be made but come on.
---
So, which vids?
---
So does this mean it's possible for some duplication to happen? For example, say somebody drop traded something from their Ironman account to their main, would it be possible (however unlikely) for both accounts to have the item after the rollback?
---
Ngl I literally just want an alternative to prossy that doesn't look like ass. It can have literally the same stats, I'm just so sick of looking at that glaring white armor.

Waifu market.

Congrats on getting lvl 99 in Reddit upvotes and unlocking customer support 
---
Thanks man.
---
I just think alot of people assumed i was talking about the period after the update and rollback and didnt really read what I had said or I didn't word it right.
---
Repost. 
---
It's like when you have twins who are born at slightly different times. 
---
Died at sara, got kc and got items back. Rollback happened to the time that she was dead and getting kc. So she never got her items back.
---
How? I went w a buddy in tank gear and we had 90+ melee stats and couldn't get more than 2 lol kept rekting us
---
Dead on highscores. He gets a red helmet, but he gains no levels as a hc officially.

Glad you like it :) My internet provider had some problems earlier so i figured i would go and mess with paint!

Ping is dependent on you, not the worlds in most cases.

Was Mod Acorn any help for you? I‚Äôm glad you got the help you needed!
---
Call the police
---
That‚Äôs the joke 
---
Brazil always had a huge playerbase. Never thought on making a thread like this. Props to you!
---
Although i've moved from Brazil, here in Asia we get the same ping still (200). But i think that this is what our region deserves.
---
Im sure the jmods must have worked together to help me. I don't know who exactly to thank but I asked Mod Ash to tell everyone at jagex HQ thank you for me because ill never know
---
*logs on*
---
wow they made graceful legs into a real thing!
---
So you maxed yet or what? 
---
There are other aspects to NHing besides overheads, like dding. You can freeze your opponent, stand under him,  and flinch him so he can't hit you back. Pretty cheap trick, but it's NH
---
Was your wife out fucking other dudes again ?
---
Yes, but you wouldnmt be able to predict the rollbacks, nor would you know which account would have the earliest rollback. So in reality it‚Äôs a 50/50 gamble
---
Kinda has a point though lol 
---
I was talking about regular void, actually.
---
Why ruining?
---
100% all for it.
---
As someone who bitched and moaned and gave to shit to Jagex at every opportunity about Australian servers and actually got a little angry every time they joked about it on stream.
---
I understand the struggle.
---
It always makes me laugh btw when streamers complain about "lag" and they might have a spike of 100ms up from their usual 10-30ms. When people have to play on 200ms+
---
I don't get it.
---
ah thank you. i just started this account about a week ago, still learning the native tongue.
---
Well, buying barb helm was my only expection.

That is my fetish, thank you.

I think you mean skullball

the last time they listened to streamers we got last man standing

Completely false. The ping difference is huge.

Trying to be smart backfired
---
Not really at all dude. The scale of the world never changed. It's still the same squares from lumbridge to varrock. What I want is the grid system dropped and to have everything spread out so that it feels like there's real distance between cities. People seem to have this impression that because they changed the combat in rs3 it plays like WoW. It doesn't at all and you wouldn't be making that argument if you had played both. A game with the depth of old-school but the immersive ability of WoW would draw a large audience. With the direction blizzard is taking retail WoW there is a lot of real estate opening up in the MMO market that is going to be filled by something that can tie all the lesson from old and new MMOs together. 
---
A new, more modern MMO that takes advantage of the game mechanics a 2019 game can have, that takes place in the RS world with RS writing/lore would be fine.
---
I don't like RS3 since it's trying to be a modern all singing all dancing MMO while still constrained to the limitations of a browser game from 2000 like the low tickrate and being tile based.
---
As fun was OSRS is, we've got to admit that it's super niche.

I did "lawn mower osrs" the other day

lms is a minigame

It‚Äôs a shame that Skill Cape only has one use per 5 years.

Didn‚Äôt block out clan chat title. Ty for account

Give him time, he'll have it by tomorrow.

My people &lt;3
---
Got that one too. Luckily it was around its peak at 140 or so mil
---
I use bgs. it's about a fifth of the price of warhammer for only slightly less effectiveness but still amazing overall. yea you can do pretty much the same strategy without walking under but he will just attack much more often with both styles resulting in a shorter trip overall. most strategies do involve walking under him to buy time unfortunately or some other type of running around to kite attacks.
---
Can't wait to unlock the next champion! I mean i really needed that guaranteed win after buying one.
---
Panic Buy Random Shit?
---
Make it consume god pages of the same type for a boost of some thematic  type over x hits. So you fill 4 pages then upgrade it via boss kills/ drop then it can consume pages for an effect... ala item sink
---
Call it the gold farm
---
gz on your b2p tablets
---
hell no lmao
---
you will never find a free safespot at wyverns, unless it's night and you hit hop limit...then MAYBE. 
---
gargs are way easier, and can easily stay there forever with guthans, kurasks are much better than gargs, literally afk, some worlds might be taken but you can always find a world for the off-task safespot. alchs,herb sack, seed box and you can pretty much stay forever until you run out of bolts. 
---
They said like 550k at Runefest I think

The availability of (quality) servers in SA is pretty limited. Ofc for bigger companies like Jamflex, the fake servers aren't big of an issue but getting a server that's up to standards when compared to other locations is often either very costly or outright impossible.
---
The wildy agility course is the best agility xp/hr at its level, so in order to balance it people like this guy have to occasionally go and kill people there. Same thing with the dark altar thing where people get better prayer exp.. it'd be broken as fuck if it wasn't a pk hotspot. 
---
So thankyou pkers for giving me justification to never use wilderness content except when I absolutely have to.
---
Happy for you :)
---
But not in bank.
---
it makes basically no difference but if you're having fun who cares
---
Yeah it should be season 3 episode 1
---
Greetings brother. 
---
Just won 500m from the arena fam it's not a scam I swear!
---
How can you unironically act like League is dead holy shit
---
We have to convince Elon Musk to but jagex
---
No go find a picture not on mobile
---
with 7 different items, this picture proves you get 7 reward rolls doesn't it?
---
I may be misinterpreting, the wiki claims a max of 6 rolls and a 1 in 17 chance to get an item (6 * 1/102), doesn't this mean a chance of a barrows item is 7/102 instead?
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows#Mechanics  
---
&gt; There is initially one roll at the drop table.
---
Each brother killed grants an additional roll at the drop table, to a maximum of six rolls.
---
Ehm, I played in bolivia and I barely get any lag
---
Lol bad internet
---
Oh i meant to say SOPA DO MACACO UMA DELICIA KKK FILHO DA PUTA
---
No way! Awesome dude :)
---
It's not even this hard.  Just wait for every world to be offline all at once, so all player states are saved.  Then start the update and bring worlds online as they become ready.  It guarantees consistency.
---
I'll take it!
---
There‚Äôs a couple series on YouTube with people starting from scratch f2p/p2p just search for it there are some non iron man ones as well. 
---
Dont know what makes me worthy but im in my mid levels trying to grind at blue drags just to earn back my bond leaving me no time to lvl up my other stats itd be really nice to just have that 14 days where i can just level up things like agility and theiving(for quests) and maybe even get my slayer and farming so i can start earning some good money through ranaars and higher slayer tasks my player name is threepio17 if you wish to check my stats, thanks for your time!
---
Or the rollbacks
---
What do you mean ‚Äúthis guy‚Äù lmao
---
Big Oof, there go your next 50 pets or whatever.
---
Because he typed it in
---
In addition to barrows gloves, I would recommend getting the quests and requirements for Kings Ransom done so that you can unlock piety when you hit 70 defence. That‚Äôs a big boost for melee training in NMZ and for slayer 
---
Ok then 1 days worth of membership is fair.
---
two weeks I believe
---
Racist 
---
He might've just used the gp on the crafting lol
---
Poor fellas being in w330 I can almost feel your pain. I shall upvote
---
Hello, I just finished the Contact ! quest. I have around 190 qp, 61 atk/def/str/hp, 51 range and 57 magic. What should I use the two 7k xp wishes on ? I would tend to put it towards magic because it is a very useful skill, or ranger because it would give me a full level. I'm a new player so I don't know the meta about choosing a skill to allocate xp !
---
Well I mean I have multiple attempts just can‚Äôt seem to get it down
---
Panic buy all vestments
---
ranged is only the most powerful with specific weapons that are extremely expensive to use. in most situations melee is just more usable
---
Jagex is finally doing good. It's great to see
---
You could try out doing the wc on mobile when you have down time and see if it works for you
---
flute salad
---
Runes are worth something, I'm glad Jagex turned them into Tbows otherwise rune prices would be fuckey wuckey'd
---
Maybe he‚Äôs referring to like how long it physically takes to take a claim such as OPs and research it, conform what happened, and return the items?  Because obviously nothing is going to make that happen faster. But surely he doesn‚Äôt believe that hitting the front page of this sub does NOT increase your chances of a complaint being resolved by jagex. That‚Äôd be pretty dumb. 
---
&gt; unless the rewards are good enough
---
This is why I focused a lot on rewards, I know it's what keeps most people playing. From being on this sub since OSRS came out, there has been a strong desire for the nostalgic games like Stealing Creation to reenter the game. With any update, its viability is a balance between estimated resource cost (dev time) and estimated community appreciation. I think here the latter metric is quite high if executed well.
---
nobody's asking for black dhide with prosy bonus...
---
dangit
---
I do
---
Any acc can pk lol
---
well they did like 3 years ago. And it was bullshit at the time too. but yeah, they returned like everyone's shit back from the jed fiasco so obviously it was false before this
---
Iirc the 1st time they ree'd was when pizzamn got his pizzas back. This community can be shit sometimes. Entitled 25 year olds who didn't get their participation trophies.
---
Can use for making money while you train low intensity skills on your main or use the alt for duo PVM or as a tber for PVP
---
Really was it that bad at first? I‚Äôm really glad I didn‚Äôt come back until 2017 as the reddit community seemed to be one to drag me back but damn must have been rough playing a very outdated game back then. Now the game just feels very much alive on its own.
---
Max melee with rapier is worse dps than max range with blowpipe using bronze darts for perspective. Believe the only thing that out dps blowpiping is scythe
---
What's the skill specs one? 
---
You worded it right. Those of us who passed 4th grade reading comp knew what you meant. The rest are just trolls. Congrats on getting your stuff back, glad Jagex took the high road on this one.
---
Am i misunderstanding it or is it just shaving off the sides and doing whatever with the top, you look like an ice cream cone.
---
It has a place... I should have been more clear.
---
Yes please, min ping I get is 150 down here from Argentina
---
They do slightly represent brainlet memes.
---
nvm i'm a dumbass
---
I don't think it particularly matters. I'd  probably go with ranged since it's your lowest skill and ranged is such a good skill to get as high as possible.
---
Yeah, negro-mancy nigga
---
Imagine something like Soul Wars and Fist of Guthix had a baby. With worthwhile rewards and no clan manipulation.
---
I was confused for a minute! I was sure I had seen that bowl there before
---
I would do it for free if they gave me the ban hammer
---
The only GGG i know is Gennady Golovkin. What is ggg in what ever you're talking about
---
Where you buying thats 70c/mil? Asking for a friend. 
---
we must've played different games in season 2...
---
off the top of my head, jax, ryze, kassadin, nidalee.... etc
---
He bought a like 34000 flax and I had 6 k flax in my bank but my gp was worth more

For real, it's crazy that international players are neglected, I wonder if rs would of blown up more if they had better servers 
---
Yeah, fuck dat Seers noise.

Ok

Gratz man!

This is a good meme

i've literally gone from 33-50 agi by just fishing lol.

No no... that's Moe Jed, Mod Jed's cute little brother.
---
How much faster is it than seers with diary?
---
Its real
---
Do it
---
doesn't change the fact that you can skip the process of grinding games to eventually buy them by using real world money. exactly like how u can buy bonds in runescape
---
Prot Mage and anti-dragonfire and it's literally afk like 800k+ per hr
---
The QoL update we need.

Maybe if you take the items needed to Thurgo after completing The Knights Sword.

That's a lot of wood
---
Bwana warlock
---
those champions still exist and yet burst was nowhere near as high then as it is now. stuff like electrocute, shield bash, duskblade, pta, conqueror, etc all didn't exist back then and drastically reduce kill times. go back and watch old vods and see how slow people die even lategame.
---
It's single combat so you can't be crashed
---
You misspells perfect
---
It's sad that time wise, you're not actually halfway with rc agility and mining still to go
---
Imagine not doing 5 minute tree runs.
---
infernal only looks good because you cant get it. i use to think the fire cape was so cool looking when i was a kid until i got it now it just looks like trash. those mage arena 2 capes? i can get me some more of that
---
Ohhh gotcha
---
Nice!
---
You're right, but i guess one guy is better than nobody.
---
Hey op, quick actual question: what completion % do you normally run for your chests? If it's more than 88%, do you find it worthwhile/more profitable? Simply curious 
---
Just watch your HP/range/melee exp per hour. Once gained matches exp per hour check your loot tracker to see your kills per hour. 
---
Thanks, genius
---
It's one of those things a lot of people apparently don't think enough about. There's an underlying mentality behind it that I wanted to point out. People are complacent about everything ingame these days.
---
Bbbbbbb
---
this issue has specifically been brought up for people who want to multilog rs3 and osrs.
---
I personally use a Rune pouch 
---
You believed then when they said they can't? Also why would they have to put the won't, if they can't 
---
Lucky I‚Äôm 4K dry
---
Maybe I should 1 tick 99 fishing and cooking.
---
Chances of occurring, note this is the chance for exactly this many items and not for at least this many items:
---
One item: 1/17.86 (This is the chance for exactly one item, not at least one item. at least one item is 1/17.42)
---
Two items: 1/721.5
---
Three items: 1/54,652
---
Four items: 1/7,359,817 (7.35 million)
---
Five items: 1/185,835,382 (185.835 million)
---
Six items: 1/1,126,162,419,264 (1.126 trillion). 
---
Report that cunt in game. 
---
That could be his friend though
---
Put it somewhere really obscure and bury a chair and a rope or a nature rune and 3 fire runes. 
---
They should make superhuman strength useful because I don‚Äôt use it when I unlock ultimate strength 
---
Super cool, but if it‚Äôs more complicated than BA, the chimps will never be able to play it :-(
---
Brain-dead...
---
Loser edit
---
As long as you have the diary you can boost the agility level and the portal put you on top :D
---
Everyone downvoting is just a fucking pussy
---
What the fuck is it with everyone getting Twisted Bows today? Lmao. I thought I was the only one. Gz though! Your friend is probably pissing his pants, huh?
---
I‚Äôm saying that he is reacting like the people who burned their Nike shoes when Nike sponsored kaepernick.
---
Being upset about where your money goes after getting what you paid for. 
---
Swamp......
---
Yeah describe how that would work for me
---
What do you even mean when you say sync
---
I kinda wanna get 81 agil to get that one taverly dungeon shortcut, at 71 rn, is it worth???
---
To be a little more specific,
---
T-30 to update: G A L I G A dies at god wars
---
T-10: god wars KC achieved and gear is picked up safely, phew!
---
T-0: Game goes offline for weekly update containing twisted bow spawning bug
---
Few hours later when the game is rolled back because of the bug, G A L I G A was reset to their game state as of ~T-15, when they had died and their items were on the ground, but before they had been able to retrieve them. Due to the rollback, the items were gone.
---
Just got my first at 3956 kc. Never thought i would get it. Got 19m Slay xp.
---
Idk dude I'd look into that free ags. 
---
Imagine wasting of your bank on treee runs
---
LETICS!!!!
---
How long do you think it would take blizzard to save every single characters game state? 
---
You know what else is massive?  
---
Ok no just kidding...
---
It's sad that so many of you abuse your privilege of riding a motorcycle on public streets.
---
Some of us, hell most of us, are utilitarians and it's the number 1 reason why I ride; practicality.
---
I ride straight away from the groups of idiots riding around breaking every law in the book, who try to come play tag or what have you (my bike is a SS). I also steer clear of idiots like you because it kills the spirit of what riding means to ME.
---
That's something I don't expect people who condone and perhaps enjoy or even participate in this behavior, to understand.
---
I am not going to shit talk you or not stop if a "stunt" bike is stranded etc. I have nothing against stunting and the bikes, despite how aggressive and jarring they can look. I do however despise hooliganism for the sake of hooliganism.
---
The whole "take over the streets" mentality is boisterous in the most innocuous of viewpoints, but can be easily painted as "terroristic" in today's political climate.
---
If you were perhaps part of some socially motivated vehicle(pardon the pun) of positive change in the community and trying to garner attention for specific issues or events, then MAYBE the excuse of a "take over the streets" mindset is understandable, but never pardonable.
---
And that's just it; This behavior is childish at best and completely self absorbed at worst. And that is what erks me when I come across footage like this; There is no use, this children out playing with their power wheels. Except now these kids have full time jobs and can get a "real" power wheel. There is no respect; for themselves, the road, or the privilege they have of riding a fuel injected crotch rocket.
---
The practicality of riding is in the fact you're unfettered by idealist designs of safety and cost savings. No unnecessary bullshit of getting from point A to B you come face to face with your environment like knight in mid century. "For king and Country!" you say, but you're the king, and the world is your country, the bike, your noble steed.
---
Yes, my view is completely romantic. But it's at least my own, and it at least operates in a framework that is sensible and of course, reasonably safe. These videos; the operators are riding around town, and that would be cool; I love downtown cruises with my SS, I park it by a bar and get to chatting with people real quick; some cool some not. But in this video they all have NO WHERE to go, just stop light after stop light, wheeling and being loud and revving up the neighborhood for literally a fucking youtube video!?
---
Oh please, we have enough video of mid 2000s sport bikes doing wheelies with guys in vests and skull caps. Its not interesting, its just YOU doing it. While you have every right to post it and film it etc. just know its absolutely showing the worst in yourselves and the community as a whole.
---
First/Last/Only time I start and End this Rant.
---
I believe today was the last day to request the fix to your account so it's safe to assume that they will be working on resetting the exp gained in the next week or so.
---
Meanwhile jagex banning people not speaking English even on private chats like cc and their discord too
---
Fuck 
---
Do you think I'll always profit by buying eclectic imps for clues?
---
Not for me
---
I like ur bear
---
Holy shit!! Gz Bro!! 
---
they said they *wouldn't* return items, that's not the same thing as "can't"
---
Memes aside mining is much worse than rc
---
Not me I did toadflax for the first time today and gor like 60 herbs from 5 patches
---
Which is weird
---
Why do people make pointless and weird analogies that don't even help their comment
---
He is not "acting like the people who burned their nikes" 
---
Now get 1,234,567,890 xp
---
True, seems genuine. 
---
Rip no ranger boots.
---
He‚Äôs one to bitch and whine about what the company decides to do with the money he gave them for a service he received. 
---
I said he‚Äôd be one to do it based on the Original comment.
---
Dont bully the lizard wizard
---
Did that help you understand this already simple thing?
---
(I'm trying to find out why an analogy is necessary here) 
---
umm panic buy d pics???????????????????
---
Anything from Facebook has to be true
---
Nice! Uve earned the hell out of that!
---
You actually lost money if you got the clues from imps.
---
Where are you getting 66% of the dps? 
---
It should give you normal short bow when you search it.
---
"from the streets" because you don't like nerdy faggots pretending to be runescape hall monitors? It's also a rule in the sub not to snitch, but i doubt you can read. 
---
They would if it meant you can tank more.
---
F2P rune wars are all about longevity. That‚Äôs why people still bring both a scim AND kite even if they‚Äôre already carrying a maple short.
---
My only account is ironman account and currently cant continue to play it, my plan was to collect mark of graces and then change them into stamina potions and drop trade to some guys in a good ironman cc to afford my next bond but got only to 62 agility unfortunately. If it was possible to get a bond it would get be paying again and would be very happy, and great help, thank you :)
---
I really hope this is the greatest ruse of all time and OP made this up. 
---
Anyway, congrats OP this is a story of the most unfortunate timing we‚Äôll see on this game.

Nah u a bitch

is that a barrows

This looks extremely fake.  Like the picture itself just looks tampered. 
---
why you tripin
---
I support your decision to be a total fucking idiot and risk your life, as it is your own choice and you will be the one facing the consequences.
---
However, you're on a **public fucking road** with other people and motorists around. Pull your head in and stop being a fucking dumb cunt and risking the lives of people around you. 
---
Fucking cunt, jesus the cheek of you. 
---
I hope you're blowpiping karil. And what order you doing the brothers? Speeding up runs makes those dry streaks feel a little less shitty cause you at least make plenty of money from runes.
---
I meant to respond to the thread not your post, but what happened to you is an ouch.
---
If he's on a private road that he owns, sure... go ahead.
---
He's not, he's on a public road with other people around who don't get a choice in his stupid decisions. 
---
Hey buddy, I‚Äôm on a break from rs but if you wanna talk message me 
---
? Just asking
---
Hope you have another D Pick banked for Chamber of Xeric lol
---
I was expecting you to high alch the cape and end the video there ngl
---
Am 600 kills dry at Zulrah, but have had 2x rune 2h in the same drop. RNG is a bitch for sure. 
---
500*
---
TBH, after getting 99 farming, I only do 1, maybe 2 herb runs per day. Just don't have as much motivation to keep doing it as much daily anymore, despite the increased yield from my cape.
---
Probably hacked and used for this but I don't see why. You can definitely make more pvming with it or selling it. Maybe someome wants him banned.
---
Perfection? It's literally just pressing the print screen button on your keyboard, using the snipping tool on windows, or any of the 20+ other ways to take a screenshot within 5 seconds. Nobody cares about you venting over screenshot criticism.
---
There is no distinction. Buying gold and buying xp are the same thing in principle. If you didn't have to buy gold, you'd go have to grind zulrah/cerb/vork for gp. That's time spent just like you'd spend time grinding the xp instead of buying the hypothetical lamp. 
---
What's the best way to get in contact with a JMod and have this resolved?
---
How much is that worth 
---
So I recently saw all this premier club membership. Is there anything special for osrs? It just looked like  R3 stuff (which is kinda preferable imo)

Nah man it's a race track

Email is my own for the appeals, password has been changed though.
---
took me four hours because I had no patience
---
Support because I want to see how crowded green dragons gets
---
Depends on the outfit. I'd say lumberjack outfit is worth it. Anglers probably not given how long it takes vs how much time you save. That being said lumberjack and anglers are both needed for clues and prospector is needed for diaries. Might as well get them sooner rather than later if you plan on doing clues or diaries
---
that's some next level irony if you're being serious
---
I think he was saying you sell the gold at .7/M not buy it at that price. The sites have to make a profit right 
---
Bad money, on and off task. Barely passes 400k/h with max gear.
---
Straya mate

Looks like you're ready for Underground Pass.

i did this for a hour and lost 51m

can we buy
---
Imagine having bone voyage done and training on better crabs with less people
---
its like you didnt even read what i said but youre just such an angry person that you wanna be rude to people for no reason anyways. that's really sad. You literally agreed with what I said and tried to insult me anyways lmao. Grow up or learn to read, maybe both would be a good idea
---
Nothing special, but it is the cheapest way to purchase membership.
---
Blowpipe Karil? I thought he had crazy ranged defense.

Theres a new sale going on?

What stats do you need to Melee them without using a ton of food?
---
No one says you must do all 9 in a run..
---
I meant ahrim lol.
---
People that say they are falsely banned for botting. Yikes
---
Very well made guide and to the point without rambling. Also full obsidian is better than dharok up to 94 hp. You can use Bitterkoejke's dps calculator to check for yourself.
---
Keep going mate!
---
Osb was the main go to client people used before runelite was a thing, and they offer pretty much the same plugins and such, but osb has a subscription fee of like 3$ or something which locks out certain plugins. It's as safe as runelite. 
---
Lmao 
---
Lol
---
no you can't, it's about this sub mods
---
Someone kinda has before, there used to be a minecraft server with the ip "runesca.pe" that was basically almost a 1-to-1 recreation of all the f2p area.

is this wrong then? The wiki should be updated if it doesn't give 10% damage bonus

You don‚Äôt. You recover the account and put all the security measures in place so it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Sorry man. The mute will probably stay, if it was hacked for the mute than you have a small chance.

It's free to enter, gov doesn't care if you make money, your could charge 1 cent to enter and it would break the law. As long as you can enter for free it's fine

Wow, this is sad :(
---
notify local authorities non emergency number about the situation, to avoid a swatting.
---
Runelite offers further rendering distance as well. Also several other graphics options and animation smoothing. But to answer your question, one of my friends has been using it for like 2 years with no problem.
---
is someone braindead?
---
Can confirm I've gotten a twisted bow from chickens.
---
Also I go Dharok Ahrim Karil Guthan Torag and verac

‚ÄúDamn son, where‚Äôd you find this?‚Äù
---
Yeah and if I can do it, so can they. This would be a waste of resources and dev time.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Okay you‚Äôre actually fucking stupid then.
---
Lol them yes
---
Fruit trees lol
---
Support but only if they can only trade with each other in their own micro ecomony to avoid real world trading. 
---
If you have a debit card. You can do it. I have been with NAB for years; and there‚Äôs no problems LOL
---
"xenophobic", please shut the fuck up. Stop calling any critique of culture a "phobia". Is it also "xenophobia" to denounce honor killings? You pathetic troglodyte.
---
Prepare for feature length film style episodes haha

Rune lite feature it's great!
---
How do treeruns make money sorry I'm a noob
---
Even if it was 800k/h it's still shit gp
---
You can boost from 85, and you also need to chop a redwood for the K&amp;K elite diary.
---
If you have it in you to grind straight grind out 70-90 wc then do it, if not just drop it. It's not that hard to get another master clue and the average loot is honestly pretty shit anyway.

How do you do it though? Theres no option to pay using NAB in the poli-pay section
---
Oh fuck off

That was a really good guide. Taught me some new builds. My advice, since I just recently had to delve into the guides to learn nmz, would be to include at least one live example of how to use rock cakes and absorptions. Seeing the method would help it click for a lot of beginners.

450 mind runes :0

---
Whenever I do bloods i'm struggling to keep run energy, not sure why lol
---
Probably still working on rc
---
I did check with my own stats and I forgot to check with lower level attack and defence so for me it does come out to being better past 86hp. But you're correct at 70 atk and strength you'll need 92+ hit points to do more dps with dharoks.
---
Yeah I'm fairly positive that if doing it efficiently you can get close to 1m xp an hour with black chins, I know with red chins without Rigour from I think it was 82 - 89 took what could've been like 4 hours and I was doing it pretty poorly and yet still constant 600k xp/hr with picking up pots. When doing it well after I picked up Rigour I was hitting closer to 700k.

very happy for you pal

Its better than kruks dungeon agility route lmfao

You just leaked your adress again you fuccin idiot
---
Lel. Jamflex disappoint once again. Anyone else remember whenever deadman gets brought up they always say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got huge things coming for it we have tons of suggestions in the backlog‚Äù and all that‚Äôs changed is removal of pvp armor &amp; suffering, and double drops? Incredible. 
---
Gratz!
---
This is actually fuckin sick. 
---
They literally said there are huge things coming for it. Drastic changes will occur every season. Tons of changes in the backlog. Archie is a good salesman 
---
Naah that wont fly 
---
No thanks. Total level worlds do that just fine. I'd rather keep varrock the hub for trade
---
You don‚Äôt need to use Poli. 
---
Just insert in the credit/ debit card section, and put in your card number, and the other details. 
---
Also POLi is private and owned by Australia Post. Most banks don‚Äôt even recommend using it and are against it, haha. 
---
Otherwise just make your PayPal and link your NAB debit card on there. Then, just pay through PayPal, even if you have $0 balance on PayPal, it‚Äôll just subtract the payment straight from your NAB classic banking account without any fees of such.

Okay. So the rollback set OP's account to the point where he/she had already died, but was in the process of retrieving his/her lost items.  
---
The second she logs into a different world, those items are gone. So unless he/she logged into the same world (With death mechanics, you have an hour or so to get your items back, UNLESS you log out.  
---
I'm guessing OP didn't log into the same world he/she died in. Resulting in lost items.
---
1/2000 on task
---
First we need items to autocast all the god spells, i know we have sara and guthix already, but zammy doesnt have anything.  Then you also need to make a good selection of god related items, probably in the warding skill people all seem to not want and would be an easy way to make mage items more interesting... by imbuning them to be aligned to a specific god...

Way to show a new player courtesy and helpful suggestions. An unfortunate representation of the RS community, instead of suggesting a different flair or assisting another player to be more efficient, it‚Äôs straight to the insults. Stay classy.

They werent not going to give him the items back if it wasnt for the huge support he got on reddit.

This is literally a perfect example of what people complain about all the time: if you need any actual customer support you need to play the reddit lottery and hope that your post gets a few thousand upvotes.

What a dick. What the fuck is wrong with people man.. sorry to hear that you‚Äôre having to deal with this and I hope something can be done. 
---
Fuck the momo challenge, this image is cursed.
---
I like this one. 
---
Expect the unexpected
---
Lol its fucked how the OSRS Community gold buyers and sellers are actually giving employment to Venezuelans. Pretty fucked up world we live in
---
No I never saw that. It really sucks because I've just been grinding away on my fishing for so long. It may seem like nothing to most obviously. I just log on every chance I can after work to grind away, and then all the sudden there's a chunk just taken. 
---
If you maybe took a 1 minute to think about this before posting (you clearly did not), you'd realize the only difference between your actual address and every other address in the world is that they can observe your reaction to their pranks.
---
So when you do something like this you are doing exactly what they want you to do instead of ignoring it (which will devalues your personal info because they could as well annoy some random dude who has nothing to do with osrs).
---
Way better than Zuhaar
---
No, that‚Äôs what he is suggesting
---
He's not entirely wrong though. EVEN if they know for sure it's your real address, none of these people care about you, none of these people have anything against you, except for that one toxic dude. If you keep your calm and pretend like nothing's happening, you mitigate the damage by a solid 99%. Nobody's gonna want to waste time sending pizza and shit to an address and then never hear from it again. Their reward is your reaction. Don't reward them.
---
Unfortunately for you this is jagex we're talking about, and they have a reputation of not taking issues seriously until their PR is in danger, so... I'd say you still made the right choice. In any other case though? Def not.
---
I‚Äôd also try looking at used, something maybe a year old? You‚Äôll get more for your money with much better specs!
---
There‚Äôs a weird stigma about buying used, but so long as it‚Äôs in good condition and treated well it‚Äôs a solid option!
---
Cant you not get a kill if someone else goes with you?
---
This isnt even that dry
---
That's not cool, hope jagex notices this. And to the people who are calling him dumb for doxxing himself, who the fuck cares? He fucked up, not everybody has the wit to think about this shit all the time, maybe he's just a very trusting guy. He still doesn't deserve this shit.

Don‚Äôt hold your hopes up. I think Jagex is up for auction atm.
---
That's what I am asking, is for a partner?
---
I personally have no problem with communication but BAs are people who are specifically good at communication. The application I develop has 30k users a month and they ask some really dumb stuff I just don't want to deal with. The main difference between a BA and I is they usually have studied business and want to talk on that level whereas it doesn't interest me and I'm not a domain expert in that area of the application.
---
Might be worth jumping on an aus streamers channel and asking them live. EV has been pking a lot lately.
---
Ouch sorry for your mate. I got the Tangleroot pet 5 mins after the update as well which is now gone.
---
Don't have pictures but I insured it immediately after which I'm sure they could check if they were actually bothered to check. Unfortunately as people have said, if you're not on the front page of reddit then we really have 0 chance of getting our items back.
---
This sucks man, hopefully it gets sorted, I'd hate to know someone was spamming my personal information in game
---
How low level we talking? I completed nature spirit at about level 40 and was fine. Ghasts don't touch you if you have food anyway 
---
or... this is a shit post with no valuable content not worthy of being upvoted. Venezuelans playing the game as a job is hardly new, news articles have been written about it. 
---
No I'm downvoting since he's publicizing their location and world. Some jackass is going to PK them and then their family won't be able to eat. If you get PKed, you shouldn't die irl.

Great clan for beginners and experienced players alike! I love how active people are whether it being for PvM (GWD/raids) or just hang out in their official discord to chill and talk. I've built some amazing friendships in this clan :D
---
I would love a bound. I'm not a super super active player (busy irl) but I'm training to do barrows. Always wanted to do that as a kid, but never had the guts to do it. 
---
Pretty sure Ash stated he can't give the items back himself so he needed to ask the support team thriguht he website. 
---
It happened to one of my accounts back in the day. Got locked out then the evidence just shows my account spamming like absolute fuck in the dual arena. Feel bad for the owner of the account.

memes aside, mining is actually pretty doable at MLM.

Nice loot bra. I recently got Karil's Battleaxe and that got me hyped, but this makes it feel less like an achievement.

no it means double rep acquired from that point on.

i also think that reward is outdated and the double rep gain is baseline.

No, I'm saying your vidya game is worth a lot less than people dying.

Well they removed any real form of contacting them through their website directly like many other companies have. I had to spend an additional hour to figure that they didn't have that just to post to forums and have a vague answer returned. Until they expand their team of 32 to include customer support and ACTUALLY "maintain a more successful form of support," I'll think they are capable, but until then, they're pretty incapable.

So jagex can return items. Now what about everyone else that lost out. Sorry but 1.4b would take the average player just as long as an ironman would take to get a zspear. They have done it for 1 player they should do it for all
---
Lol well observed
---
I wish you gl with it friend.
---
Got my barrows ammy at 1345 kc

this is called shares. lol

No i'm saying if you're an ironman and you bring a partner. You cannot get any kills as you didn't do 100% damage, correct?

I am portuguese. When I was a kid I didn't know English and I played on the portuguese servers, but I didn't like the lag so I used the little English I knew and got my ass to the English servers

Guess grave is more of a relic of a word in this case. You die, you get 1 hour to get your gear back. Not sure what the mechanic was last you played, but that's what is is now/has been for a while. So it's not really a grave I guess. 
---
Its really not about banning people for fun these resources coming into the game are illegitimate and not healthy for the games integrity fake items aren't doing the economy any good and I know for a fact all of those pictures I took of those players are 100% not scripts as such I hope jagex removes them IMO 
---
I'm European - I already cringe to death when I try to pray-flick on American servers, and my ping there isn't even that bad (Dutch internet is just really, really great, so the delays are minimal). I support this. Everyone should be able to play with 50ms ping or less.
---
I don‚Äôt blame you. This sub is fuckin so cringe. Always.
---
This is why I always read those "just got my account recovered wtf jagex" with a huge grain of salt. Don't get me wrong, there are genuine victims and Jagex's security could use work, but I've seen more than a few people who are super lax with their information online. I know people who just use the same account &amp; email for absolutely everything and see no problem with it. 
---
When you link your RSN with your Reddit, Twitter and everything else it's so easy to get tons of information out of you, and if somebody has a previous password it's gg. Be careful with how much information you're giving out if your RSN is easily linked to you. 
---
The ping is relative to your location - it's basically the 'distance' between you and the server you are connecting to. So yes. Australia is further away for you than a server in your continent.
---
There's only a single mention of Tencent in that entire article and they were just mentioned as they're part of a larger collaboration given a license to trial the system. As I said, the relationship with Tencent is not exclusive, it's just part of China. And if you read my post, you would've seen I already mentioned the government was interested in their social media platform, not their gaming sector. 
---
Okay ive seen a ryzen 5 refurb would that be better?
---
Bwana looks swole tho
---
Ill be game for that too
---
Curious how you got 24k bones having only killed 16.8k monkeys
---
Speaking as someone who gets around 50 ping, I can say that even at 50, I find some things difficult. I cannot imagine what it's like to have to play on 150+ all the time. Jagex should really look into this. A whole new market out there.
---
Yeah, 3 times the drop rate isn't that rare. Stop being a sook and go take a ritalin 
---
10s of thousands of ores as well. Probably like 15m worth at a guess.
---
It is not hard to understand.
---
He got an item after the update. The rollback caused him to lose said item.  
---
He died while trying to grind said item back and now lost hardcore status for the item he had already obtained.
---
Thats not how the force works
---
Apple take a cut on all transactions done inside of mobile apps, guess Jagex didnt want to pay them that cut.
---
I'm not even from Brazil and I support this. 
---
ADD MORE ACCOUNT SECURITY REEEE
---
Why do you need to complete Witch‚Äôs Potion?
---
He probably just doesnt want a clip where he goes full overlayscape in his video because that looks dumb
---
I sincerely hope that the day I make mistake that dumb there will be someone to make a brainlet meme about it.
---
Not really you only need void, anguish, archers, pegs, range offhand (book of law, odium ward, buckler) and chins. You could definitely get away with using god d'hide boots over pegs saving yourself 30m+ and get pretty much the same xp rates.
---
So you hop every time bot is said at a skilling spot? Fuck off...

Unless you happen to have a grandfathered rate.

Just wondering on this super exp version. I assume you wont be in the NMZ for very long if you leave on piety the whole time? think taking more prayer pots and af ew less absorbs might be worth

---
Same with Clue Scrolls ‚Äî maybe once every month or two I‚Äôll do the ones I have in my bank but not once have I gotten a Clue and immediately gone to do it.
---
What is the reason for attacking other players? Making money or experiencing the fun of a PvP battle. If there is no reason for an action, isn¬¥t it insane?
---
I like it! Probably something that'd end up in Runelite over the official client
---
&gt; great moral and ethical dilemma
---
Not helpful when you don‚Äôt include the link or email address
---
Good luck sir do you have screenshots though? so no one thinks you're wasting our time? Hope it works out for ya.
---
Sorry but I completely disagree with this.
---
The Tangleroot drop should be traceable, not to mention the fact that I insured it immediately after, that should also be trackable. If they just took the time to LOOK at my account they could easily see that I'm not lying.
---
Also how should I know after logging in immediately after the update and doing a tree run that there's a bug with twisted bow spawns? I didn't even find out about that until 1 hour after on my way to work. Now, if somehow I immediately knew that there was a bug with tbows 10 seconds after the logging in then of course I wouldn't have done them but that's not how it happened.
---
Nice! Worst part of that quest is hacking the jungle
---
I think hes saying he got an item like at GWD then lost it to rollback then had to go get again but he died. Which 1) you cant blame them for you dying in that case, if you did it before you should be fine doing it again. 2) it is unfortunate if you didn't know about the bug happening and were playing and got an item. However if you knew about the bug then you should have stayed away from doing any real content. 3) you could have died getting another item too, even with no rollback..so blaming them here for that is kind of near sided. 
---
But I still like LoL so you're wrong lol gf sit kid
---
Can i get my 50k xp back? Thanks jagex. Also I got a twisted bow and after I got 2 ranger boots and full third age robes. 
---
Pest control for my hcim 
---
I kinda wish they didnt have revs in multi combat, but other then that, I'm fine with them.
---
Here's the timeline:
---
Playing - kicked off because update
---
10 seconds later: Reload Old School client - and log on to do a tree run. Get Tangleroot. Happy. Log off to go to work.
---
1 hour later: find out there's a bug and the servers will probably be rolled back
---
Understand?
---
Congrats! Did you get to choose the skills or is it predetermined?
---
"they are just autistic dont worry about them"
---
I feel your pain, my friend lent me 1.4b in gear as the first update was ticking down so I could use it after the update only for me to get rolled back to before the trade and him to be rolled back to after it. The simple fact that after saying they couldn't return items an account got his returned is infuriating to say the least.
---
Might as well remove the farming guild if it has this many game-breaking bugs.
---
Predetermined.
---
See ya tomorrow 
---
By bow do you mean twisted bow? Genuinely curious
---
I only do Hop runs now. Much faster, more gold, more exp. 
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt use a Crystal one...
---
No, you are insane for hanging out in a part of the game **designed for PVP** and being confused that people are attacking you
---
You deserve to be killed on spawn for being this dense. 
---
He's joking, he didn't really bank all of these drops 
---
If you make same mistake more than once you're fucking retarded.
---
First of all, how did the guy in question get his real address?
---
Hint: same way entire reddit got his real address.
---
‚ôø
---
&gt;Repeat until you feel like living.
---
Oof. When does this part kick in?
---
Log off leave rng for some one else
---
It‚Äôs 65% to lose retard that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a scam
---
Damn, how can one be so edgy while simultaneously insisting on law abiding citizens. This is the same mentality people in America use when the "rules" that get other people locked up/killed who "deserve it" end up applying to them, then they want the rules changed. Now, I'm not saying you're breaking any rules, but I am saying it you're a goober if you really want to say "they can all neck themselves" for botting chins in a damn game for food, lmao.
---
Edgy little kid, come back in a few years
---
And no other gaming company would help 1 player and leave thousands of others who died/looted or traded with a friend to get reset before and the friend reset after with fuck all.
---
pepehands
---
Yea the godpages make up for the cost of the eclectic imps
---
np brainlet
---
No, you can already fill them in the bank, you just need to right click. Op is asking for that to become a shift click option 
---
Was referring to 35% but ok retard.
---
But then his chins or the gp he spent on it would also have been rolled back. If he really quit purely because of the wasted time he's a pussy. 2 hours is not much in the grand scheme of leveling.
---
I think the purpose is that the damage has already been calculated so the game doesn't want you to rock cake before you see the damage you are taking. That's my best guess.
---
I‚Äôm like *convinced* I‚Äôve seen otherwise. Like I swear I‚Äôve seen people get double of the same thing, similar to getting 2 of the same thing from a clue.
---
Hit it up, dude. This is how I always look at pursuits like that; The time is going to pass no matter what. Tomorrow is gonna be here, next month is gonna be here, etc. People get discouraged and think, "It's gonna take years before I'm decent at X-language," well! Those years are gonna pass regardless! You may as well use that time.
---
Anyway, whether or not myself or others agree with your sentiment or reasoning is irrelevant, if you choose to use your RS time elsewhere, I hope it's enjoyable for you and you gain from it in some way. Have a good time out there.
---
Aren't chins, the cannon, and blowpipe all pretty expensive though?  I'm worried about having enough money to afford that stuff on a brand new account. Or is that not a big problem?
---
Do you feel better about yourself now?
---
Normie detected
---
Are you guys dense? You can't just ban any account because you think they will eventually commit an offense.
---
When did I say that you're OP?
---
You're speaking on behalf of retards like the guy who leaked his own address on entire reddit, so everything I said applies.
---
How are you so bad you cant run past a few monkeys LOOOOL
---
Less forced humor
---
What's the point of this post? Are they bothering you? Move on 
---
Haaaaave you met Jagex?
---
Reminds me of Evil Bob 
---
T
---
No one is saying dont ban them, they are saying it's really hard to prove they are breaking a rule. You can't just ban people willy nilly because they might eventually break the rules.
---
Gonna need more info than that bud
---
That's all that matters dude. As much as people meme around here about efficiency over fun and all that, life's about having a good time. If you had a good time doing it and can pat yourself on the back, that's all that matters in the grand scheme.
---
That's why it's so hard to tell my friends who ask, "What do you do on RuneScape?" Whatever goal you want, man. It's something to help the time pass and set little milestones for myself to keep myself occupied.
---
youtube / google thieving guide, will hold your hand and spoon feed you information
---
or it was just the same guy leaking the address and you're a reeeeetard.
---
me runescape me retard
---
I'm not speaking on his behalf I'm trying to briefly explain why something like this can happen despite normal intelligence (which I never said was the case, just that it was a possibility). 
---
I tried to do this in a quick and easy way so that even simpletons would be able to get the point but it appears that I have failed. 
---
Edgeville bank on pvp worlds you can get/see fights like this
---
No one said free pass for botting. WE ARE SAYING THEY AREN'T BOTTING. They play the accounts and will eventually sell the gold for real cash. But you can't ban them until they actually commit the offense.
---
Fairt rings are actually a thing, blew my mind. If u smoke it you could probs tele too

I lost shit and I didn‚Äôt get any help lol. Granted it wasn‚Äôt anything valuable but still sucks.

Do you not know how to take a screen shot? Why would you think anyone wants to look at this shitty picture?

You wanna give me those runes then? Lol

Throw it back, reroll for chance at karil's top and guthan's helm.

What's the first thing to get with slayer points? I already have black mask (i) so i'm not sure if i should spend points for slayer helmet.

Honestly, I'm astonished they didn't take those too.

Thanks.

How did you lure him out of the safe zone? I have already reported you btw.

No thanks, acitblizzard has been fucking everything they touch in the last few years

My main was hacked and presumably turned into a zulrah bot for about 500 kc. Was eventually locked for suspicious behavior and when I recovered it they never punished me for what was obviously done by others.

lol dclaws in a ffa cox is usually an insta kick

Just walking around... its pretty funny how ppl just following for no reason
---
Did you already sent an email to them through that support ticket.
---
Cross your fingers no one finds another tbow spawn now.
---
Just talk to the guild master, and you can ask about completed contracts!
---
That isn't the fucking point you dense fucking autist, people just don't fucking care about your opinion.
---
No, but I'm terribly amused. 
---
So actually, yes?
---
&gt;I didn't have an authenticator unfortunately, and that's why they only took what was on my person, not the bank.
---
What?
---
Weird same thing happened to me... Am I your friend? 
---
If you're AFK training I would highly recommend standing on a side/corner. This maximizes your absorption potions as you'll only ever be attacked by two foes at once MAX. Having multiple foes hit you at once is inefficient
---
What's happening here
---
Yeah I lost a tbow too, just don‚Äôt have any evidence whatsoever and I‚Äôm not popular or have any friends or any witnesses but I think I should get it back because a person that had video evidence, picture evidence, several witnesses, hundreds of people supporting him, and was playing on an Ironman which severally limits his ability to get said item back, got his (item that has arguably no effect on the macro economy of the game being an Ironman) back.
---
Come off it mate

Wiki's both the rs3 and osrs ones. There are also 3 novels released a while ago:  Betrayal at Falador, Return to Canifis and Legacy of Blood.

The barrows loot mechanics are explained in [this](https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/705428283509366785) tweet of mod Kieren. No spots on the gear drop table become blank, but the number of possible drops decreases.
---
This is stupid. I have, i think, somewhere around 20m Exp and have 30m bank, if one were to include the Bonds i bought for membership i would be at 60-70m bank. Never bought gold.
---
You spent 127 in-game hours to get a bond. A bond costs $7 USD. That‚Äôs less than $0.06/hr. Child labor in China pays more than that. I‚Äôd also rather just work half an hour at work and buy a month of membership instead of playing 127 hours to get 14 days of membership.

He's doing his best. 
---
When doing herb runs, do you typically buy as many seeds as possible or just a few (Around 100 or so) at a time? Or does it not matter because the profit will be all the same?
---
He can theoretically use the stash, but he can‚Äôt complete fremmenik isles to get the helm.
---
It should be noted, as I don't think it's completely clear that the crystal bow-sword should be offered separately, as that would definitely be the strongest one to compete with current weapons. Bronze - dragon tiers are just worse versions of things we already have, but combined for style/convenience, and would be aimed at low-mid level players.
---
Sorry, I can't read
---
So you've been going to Bert every day for the past 3.5 years?
---
Apparently they make backups somewhat frequently and I guess around T-15 was the latest one pre-update. It‚Äôs important to note that their backup process doesn‚Äôt guarantee the exact same backup checkpoint for everybody. For example, while G A L I G A‚Äôs may have been T-15, others could have been T-20 or T-10 since they are making a backup of the live game and everything can‚Äôt be saved instantaneously. Because of this, other people also lost items that they traded to their alt because the two accounts were essentially rolled back to slightly differing points in time where neither had the items. IMO they critically need to work out a system where they make a complete backup during the game update time where everyone is offline so that rolling back when updates go awry is not such a big deal
---
Do i need to use a specific browser? Because nothing happens, when i click it :/

stop drinking for a while and save up for a better tv

We need unrestricted worlds specifically for speedrunning so we can do members challenges freely.

I Just want to clarify really quickly that MacH is not a HCIM, he's just a regular ironman. You don't make a 10hp pure and make it HC because the second you fuck up or go pking you'll lose your HC status in nano seconds.
---
Thats really unfortunate!
---
You sound like someone who just now learned what hacking really means lmao. You know what it means when people use it in this context, stop having a fit when people use it the way it's usually used on the internet

Tbh, when i first did that quest i thought this dude was Chad af.

wow man thats really lucky!

the bm dance at the end is missing :-)

Math is theoretical. Like I said, I did the math on the DPS calc too lol.

Obby was better. Then I tested both the exact same way for 10+ hours each and found that the way I was using NMZ DH became better much earlier. Sorry to burst everyone's bubbles!
---
Did people get to keep their twisted bow if they found one on the floor before the hot fix? Or were they removed?
---
Okay then, next time someone takes something from you.  You aren't allowed to press charges, in the matter of fact, you have to tell the authorities he is allowed to steal from you. 
---
73 bones to peaches
---
Yeah msb (i) is the best weapon for you currently. Use rune arrows as they're not expensive especially with an ava's device. Also ranging potions are worth bringing even though ahrim's the only one you'll use them against, because they're super cheap and will make a big difference to your ahrim kill times which could save on prayer points.
---
Neitiznot is great when you can wear it, 3 prayer bonus, no magic penalty and good defensive bonuses. If you're tight on item slots then don't bring a full switch for each style, just bring the important stuff like the body and legs as they give the most bonuses and keep the rest the same so that's only 4 extra armour pieces because you'll be wearing 2 at all times - mystic for maging, dhide for ahrim / smaller minions, and rune for tanking the tunnels.  
---
Also don't forget to leave inventory spots open for the rewards. I typically leave 4 slots but if you think you're going to use a lot of food anyway you can leave less slots free.

My wife of 4 months left me in October to move in with her sister, totally blind sided me. I was lost, so hopped back on RS to continue my Zulrah grind. Sure enough, got the pet that same night. Was so happy. Funny how things work like that sometimes. Cheers on the pet man, hope your doing better. 
---
What
---
/r/nocontext
---
Do Slayer tasks.
---
Yeah seriously. At least until they work out something better for rollbacks, which I‚Äôm hoping they are going to start working on soon after this fiasco
---
What was I doing wrong? NMZ?
---
They were all removed because the game was rolled back to a state before the twisted bow spawn was added.
---
Bank space is the issue, huh?
---
Let's add a second bank to the PoH. Double your bank space!

Rip papa franku

Nice watch!

If you're absolutely broke do ensouled heads. Big bones might be 50k exp/h

Like 6+ hours, lower your fps

Yeah what monsters did you use?
---
csgo is rng too based on spray patterns. osrs pking takes more consistent levels of skill than csgo. nh'ing is harder than anything i've ever done in csgo and im global (quit though, a while back)
---
i agree fully with your other choices, i also do agree that dmm is a horrible gamemode but csgo is just a shit game honestly. only esea makes playing csgo tolerable. 
---
What is "an anti-Ironman method"? 
---
There was no issue with twisted bows because they rolled back even further than when the update containing that bug was launched. They in fact rolled back varying amounts of time before the update depending on the account but for this guy the timing was terrible obviously
---
This kind of sets a precedent, i hope Jagex is ready for this.
---
Lmfaooooooo
---
If you're looking for gp/hour then do mediums as they have low requirements, you're banking on ranger boots to get most of your profit, which is probably the most expensive clue scroll item barring 3rd age items.
---
So good, we need this

I fucking hate mlm tbh. Zmi is way more chill.

''ya little indian prick'' made this post for me ahhahaah
---
You're in an old school RuneScape sub
---
I sung this to the tune of that song that goes "Making my way downtown ..."
---
Hi buddy! So first thing get your mining and smithing to 40. Also get thieving to 28. In the Ardy market there is a house that you need to pick the lock to get into. On the 2nd floor is a nature rune chest that you can thieve every 8 seconds for 1 nature rune. So 2-3 hours will get you a solid 500 nature runes.
---
Next go to Karamja and head down to Tzhaar. Down there is 3 gold ore nodes. Mine the three of them and world hop. You only have to world hop between  2 or 3 worlds before the first world regenerates it's gold node. Once done you should smelt them in the Tzhaar area. Your best option is gold necklaces, but really anything is usually worth some alch value.
---
You can make around 60k gp/hr with this method and the hardest/slowest part is getting the nature runes. Double up on your money by raising cats for death runes. So Ardy 1 cloak should be your first untradeable unlock as an ironman so you don't have to use the Edge lever everytime you want to go to the western side of Gilneaor. So every 4 hours you can get 200 death runes, this sells to the rune shops for about 38-50k gp depending on how many time you world hop. 
---
For food for your cat get the stackable Karambwanji from Karamja, you only need 5 fishing and a small fishing net. I usually fish about 100 at a time and that lasts me 12-15 cats roughly. You can figure it out exactly as each kitten requires 7 pieces of fish before it becomes an adult cat.
---
So without having access to high alchemy or 75 agility for the agility pyramid you can still make a solid 75k gp/hr with minimal effort on an ironman. I personally used low alchemy for my money calculations as when I first started doing this my UIM was only 36 magic, and like I said I was still getting close to 60k gp/hr not including the extra 12-15k gp you add per hour of raising a kitten.
---
**TL;DR** \- So for around 2 hours of effort(most of it spent getting nature runes) you can get that rune pickaxe. Also if you do one of the Dwarven quests, it might be tale of a forgettable dwarf, you unlock a rune pickaxe as a quest reward for finishing it. Generally it's going to be easier to just farm the gp for it, but this is also an option.
---
The rollback caused me to lose 4 years of tuition, Jagex please help
---
You can lower FPS in your settings tab, under the joystick icon. Turn the slider down to the far left
---
No it's definitely accurate, they're not called Jadmins.
---
I guess for cosmetic reasons, sure

In that case, it's up to 5. You forgot the biggest one, scamming, and "encouraging others to break rules"

lol i went to america and it did not look 1st world at all

Been playing again for about 4 months btw

Stop whining. It‚Äôs a low level slayer with loot that suits level 80 mains. Beside hydra and drakes of course.

Rollback. You should have 3m back

Most streamers have pretty active CCs and discord‚Äôs. Find one you like and hop in.

Good bot

I don't think it's the owner of the account. No one would put so much time on an account just to do that.

Probably the account has been hacked

They don't, they actually cost money. 
---
He just forgot a comma...
---
nice try venezuelans
---
His wording is a little weird I thought that was what he meant but now I dunno
---
It was after the rollback. No money, no bond :/
---
I'm really happy for you dude my btw heart sunk when I saw what happened to you, having 2/3 of those items myself I would have been distraught. 
---
This is what I was thinking. I was hoping to get enough attention for a jmod forum lurker to check it out and lock it before too much damage is done for the poor lad.
---
You have someone to alch your nechrael drops and PK on if you make a zerker or pure. Also guilt free afk money making on one account if you‚Äôre actively training the other. 
---
Compromised email/recovery bypasses authenticator. Not hard to obtain an account through either of those
---
If it hurt when you got killed by the dark wizards? Idk, you should be asking that yourself.

de-iron if it‚Äôs a problem

"Bank space is the issue, huh?" You'll remember this comment thread when you reach endgame and run out of bankspace. 
---
Pretty sure rolling dice literally every swing vs your bullets going from pintoint accurate to moderately accurate over the course of a spray (which you should only empty more than 4 rounds from your mag in niche situations anyway) are on two completely different sides of the "skill based combat" spectrum.
---
Not bad
---
Because the rest of the fruit tree patches can all be accessed from POH already. 
---
Remember they give you super restores and food etc in the trolls cave
---
I know this might be an unpopular opinion but don‚Äôt bots kind of help the economy with super grindeable tasks? Like I don‚Äôt want to be grinding out d bones or powering orbs and I also don‚Äôt want them to be 5k or 3k ea respectively... or even if it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúVenezuelan‚Äù the only consequence I see is the lvl 90 with 20 slayer and 1 rc in the ge with full justiciar lmao

Nah, jagex doesn‚Äôt ban you for using osbuddy just like they won‚Äôt ban you for using runelite which has better and cooler plugins.

Maybe you tried using the osrs HD client which is seen by jagex as a botclient.

Also, other stuff.

Lol no elves dont smith! Any tree you touch teleports you to lletyta. Obviously.

How do you get 4 pets? Wouldn't it stop rolling on the table after you got one? 
---
How so? My account was on lunge on the dds which gives you strength xp, and gained def xp anyway it‚Äôs a glitch and every pure quitting over this has a right to be pissed
---
Not too many video games nowadays stick to their downtimes. League of Lego's has a predicted 3 hour downtime window but the past two updates they've been back online an 80 minutes.
---
I presume you're talking about the old WoW style of downtime where the server's go down at like 4am pst then don't come back up until 1pm pst. I assume it doesn't have to be as dramatic for OSRS, like 4 hours would seem to be enough time to guarantee no fuxxy wuxxy type shit happens.
---
But you gotta consider people are straight addicted to this game. You keep them out arbitrarily for 4 hours they're going to put up a fuss even if they know that it provides integrity to the system. To go back to the WoW downtimes no one was really thrilled when WoW had to go down for that long and it meant that during WoW downtimes they were losing their player base to competitors guaranteed. I'm sure data points to how bad it is to provide a window of 4-10 hours where your not competing, which is why they go with downtime being as minimal as possible.

How did you go about grinding all those totem pieces? Or was it more just a happenstance cumulative thing?

I mean, i‚Äôd do it.

Sounds like a "method" to me

Didn't you say that you did that exact same thing though?
---

You may actually want to grind those when they are good moneymakers after the bots are banned.

Your comment history is also cancer, so downvoted.

And a search option! 
---
I‚Äôm chinning to 99 right now. The money lost is easily replaced at vork with max. I‚Äôd rather be able to max farm money dragon and be slightly less xp efficient. 
---
I have a feeling that we'll be seeing new teleport options from the new quest anyway. Not necessarily tied to POH. 
---
Thank you! Why does everything in this game have to be gone about the most efficient way!
---
Can‚Äôt people enjoy some good content without being backlash for not grinding fishing to 99 just so they can save a few hours of agility. 
---
ü¶Ü This gets one upduck from me
---
Fuck the goblins, we need more ducks 
---
Brimhaven?
---
i know the rng is marginal, but the point is it still exists
---
there's also much more room for error in csgo and most situations are completely predictable. 
---
literally never misclicking during a fight, pulling off consistent 1 tick 4-5 way gear switches, offensive and defensive prayer switches on the right tick, not forgetting to restore after brewing to barrage, etc, etc, etc. 
---
but even if you're good in csgo it's not like it's even an enjoyable experience 95% of the time unless you mute your team. 
---
You speak the truth but it still doesn't make it any easier on those affected. I also don't think that anything will happen this weekend but I doubt anyone in this situation would just be happy with the "greater good"/"oh well, I lost nothing so I don't care" mentality that seems to be floating around reddit. This post will never garner the traction of the the lucky bugger who found himself in a situation to have support. I guess all I am trying to do is get some acknowledgement from someone at Jagex that this is a real issue causing a select few players great despair.

yes you should

I do wonder if people could use the same runelite feature swampletics used for the swamp part of temple trekking and see what ground on the map would react differently when a spade digs on it.
---
First played RS way back in like '07 or '08. Lost many accounts because I was a dumb kid clicking every link I got from the fake jagex support lol. I would love a bond so I could finally do member quests. :D Thank you for the giveaway! 
---
Thanks for the PSA. What world is he in so I can get my money doubled? 
---
tbf the map tells you the code if you hover over the fairy ring arrow, no clue if its a runelite plugin though.
---
2 keys in 12 tasks I gave up
---
They'd need to risk pieces of the set unless they're 3 iteming and the pieces would be rare, so I don't think it would be that big of an issue.
---
They most likely are well aware that their mismanaged bug caused a select few players a lot of trouble. Unfortunately it's one of those things where nobody is really going to have any proof of their claims, and Jagex can't just give everyone who says they lost items their stuff back. I assume the tracking for trades/deaths around the rollback time would take a while too, I can't imagine them having the time or staff to really put in the effort for every claim. Especially the claims coming from 3rd party websites (osrs has an official LostItems contact for this).
---
Kinda unrelated but does anyone else get bored of teleporting to their house?
---
Nothing against the suggestion, I'm just bored of my PoH cuz it feels like I'm always jumping in and out of it.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised. :( I'm dry about 31 runs right now, so it's not like I'm pushing triple digits thankfully, but damn it, man.. It's just a vendetta now.

and of course with your extensive knowledge of making these 100% randomised scripts, you've understood the thousands you could be making?

If you have the skills to write these scripts, you also have the skills to randomize them. It's not that difficult. Example: Generate a random number and if it's higher than x (this can also be random), execute a certain action.

They commented on this on a recent Q&amp;A and it probably won't happen. The GE runs on a different server so they'd essential have to cancel your offer and place a new offer at the new price. But to avoid duplication from descyncing stuff, they'd need to freeze your character in place for several seconds while it all processes.

because he lost stuff before the update got into the game, rollback shouldn't have affected him but it did, you on the other hand got affected by it and it's normal. I'm not saying you deserve  to not get your stuff back, I'm saying the rollback affected everyone and OP was not supposed to be affected by it
---
/iamverysmart
---
1/55k is about right. It's rolled separately which means there's actually no change in probability. 1/24 items to hit. Then he hit that and 1/23 and 1/22 were left doesn't mean it's more rare due to each roll being separate. It's like picking the marbles out of a bag of marbles and not replacing. If it were replaced it would be greatly increased.

Buy 33 million leather chaps
---
how about some beavers, add some beavers.
---
why aren't you writing scripts if it's that easy? go earn a living from doing something that easy
---
Give it to me
---
This is fucking terrifying but also glorious
---
Oh taking the moral high ground spot are we? Grow a thicker shell retard
---
What are you talking about? You can say that about literally any update. 
---
From 85-94 I was getting ~298 exp/grey chin with eagle eye/normal void. At ge tracker's current price of 814 each, that's 2.73 gp/exp, or roughly 17.8m for 92-99 range.
---
&gt; Is the bot detection system THAT broken?
---
No. It's just that only the very good ones last that long.
---
I like this. Maybe you should be able to create an imbued teleport crystal that can tele you to Prif, Elf Camp, Tyras Canp, and Lletya. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be unlimited though
---
Support 
---
Cute
---
Not sure how you got 33m with those stats but I would get range up to 75, buy blowpipe and get that firecape
---
It‚Äôs just a teleport to a fruit tee patch, not some overpowered tele to a super important location 
---
Will the old pk polled topic will be repolled again coz of pvm community down votes?
---
Ok let‚Äôs get this straight would let your family starve instead of rwt? No, well that‚Äôs what I thought. To hell with the companies rule if lives are depending on it
---
Hey, at least RS detection system doesn't attack legit players.
---
It would be neat to finally give a purpose to that Crystal Ball in the POH... Seriously, who thought changing the element of staves was a useful perk? They even put a rune cost to it!
---
Anyway... I'm not sure if the Elf Crystals will be getting additional teleport locations following Song of the Elves. The RS3 ones teleport to each clan district; I don't think we'll get that. But I could see them getting a Prif tele. If they do tele to Prif, not sure if they'd want a POH Tele to a POH location but the city may be big enough that different teles to dif spots aren't unreasonable (e.g. see Varrock and its 3 teleports across 4 methods). But even if we do get a POH version, I still wouldn't rule out an infinite tele crystal as an upgrade too since both would be nice for different reasons.

What does that get me?

There is only no distinction if your time has no value. Compare the EHP of a maxed normal account (using the highest buyable exp rates) to A Friend's Not P2W RS3 account. One takes several thousand hours to max. The other... 24 hours.
---
You can get those buyable exp rates in OSRS by playing the game on another account and earning the gold to buy materials. In the case of Not P2W, he *had* to spend $11,000 to get those exp rates. There was no in-game method to get them other than spending real-world money.

Now refund the UIM who lost his bank at LMS
---
Is it in your G/E history?

Mods and the original developers dont and didnt like the idea of shopscape., hence how it works.

I also would like to add I miss having a Latin version of the game 
---
Yeah and that isn‚Äôt the guy you originally responded to...so what‚Äôre you on about?
---
Why don't you play the duck hunter ? 
---
What was in the recent poll that you found objectionable and what is your reasoning for that?
---
lol! like i said I wish you the best of luck! can't be easy being as miserable as you are, cancer must be developping due to all the stress and toxicity. get yourself checked out by a doctor, man, just to be safe! 
---
Then let's go ahead and roll back every time a clan manipulates the market, if large sums of gold changing hands is a problem.
---
When will this come to ios? r/androidmasterrace
---
Lol, there is a video from ‚ÄúA Friend‚Äù showcasing the osrs hd client. You will get banned using it.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. However it still is considered a qol change regardless by definition lol
---
You actually get no cash from lower slayer levels, I don‚Äôt get where people get that from smh
---
That‚Äôs my wife right there
---
I'm not talking about one specific feature(teleports in the PoH have been around for a while) but rather about the extreme utility offered by all the additions combined.
---
So mainly having *all* jewelry teleports, spellbook swaps, regen pools, etc etc. 
---
Then leave him the fuck alone 
---
We need a Stronghold of Vigilance to teach players how to recognize bots
---
I'm literally exact same spot as you, I've been cannoning mossies in varrock sewer while using xbow. it's not overly exciting but it's profitable because of ranarr seeds which keeps you in the cannonballs and if you have 50+ agility you jsut bank in edgeville, where you can keep making more cannonballs.  
---
tried ice trolls which was slightly more profitable, but much more dangerous, and by the time I was done ripping through prayer pots and food it wasn't as glamorous as I had hoped.
---
Sharks will never be a good money maker nor should they be
---
I‚Äôm actually a btw btw
---
Thanks

twisted bow spawn not included 
---
Congrats bro.
---
No you don't.
---
They only come from hespori.
---
ducks? new 2t yew method?
---
You also do not NEED every barrows piece. Karils top/bottom, Ahrims top/bottom, tank top/legs are all you really need, and full veracs is nice for the dpick grind. 
---
Its an old as fuck engine. I suspect they can only do so much. Especially if the scripts are custom scripts which they basically all are now.
---
The taste you can see*
---
Yes it will cost no matter what, but adding herbs to vials yields no exp as you've said, so it's purely a (bad) money making method. Being related to the herblore skill doesn't add anything to it, and he's not just getting supplies cheaper. He's spending time making money for the difference, which is a terrible idea because if he had done another, better, method, he'd have saved that time difference. And there are heaps of methods better than adding herbs to vials that also require nothing.
---
Wouldn't Regen be better than barrows gloves anyway? I feel like the hp would outclass a max hit right
---
Incorrect.

Yep. If there was 0 load time it wouldn‚Äôt be as bad, but I hate having to to use my POH tbh lol

In 200 contracts I‚Äôve had 3 white lily contracts

This "tiny update" is unnecessary considering the far tinier effort needed to just remove the friend from your friend list.

You should probably do that, maybe you might be able to afford willow seeds then.

Graceful set, gives you minus weight figures- google it, very worth it

I remember years ago when youd unlock a new track it would tell you in the game chat box. Is there a way to turn this feature back on?
---
Buy bonds and sell them. Legit. 5 years of progress and cant afford willow seeds kek.
---
If they thought they could manually fix the tbow error then they should be able to make a quick dent in these obvious bots. You could sort by most obvious signs, then manually verify.
---
99 runecrafting reward

Wrong

Support, another suggestion on the topic of PVM enhances.. If you have a pet out and get a duplicate pet of the same type you have out it changes colors.. Could potentially shift through the same few colors in order so that it isn't random and a black pet or silver might be super high tier, purple one might be the lowest.
---
Not sure if you managed to get to this link but here is an update for you, you might have better luck with this [link](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/209366569?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=support-cm&amp;utm_campaign=support-deflection&amp;utm_content=lost-items)

lmaoo Haha
---
It would immediately crash the price of every combination staff to alch price since lava staff is so common.
---
Pures shouldnt have been recognized as a part of the game, their entire point is to kill lower levels in pvp.
---
Hahahaha what?? That defeats the whole purpose 
---
Very cool man!

I'm saying that they would ban me 5 years from now.

Adjustment sot the map may potentially spawn undisclosed items, I do not like this
---
ok 
---
i know, it makes sense what i said, you just need to really understand it. i can't make it clearer. point is = no on your suggestion
---
Interesting, thank you
---
Have you ever looked on the bottom websites? There are scripts for sale that are randomized and ones for sale that are private. It's really not that hard. Tribot provides steps for ACBL you can slot into any script. Stop accusing someone else of pulling info out of nowhere when you're doing the same thing. ACBL 2/10 is a lot of protection. Cycle with break timer and you're good to go.
---
Maybe you used it on a player accidentally?
---
Dont worry, had clan member who is like 50m rc xp and he just bots it when he gets cleaned lol. 
---
"why" like it's not the wilderness lol
---
The pond could also have an ethical dilemma mini game where it asks you how much of your current inventory you'd be willing to give up to save the drowning gnome child
---
It can happen, it's never happened to my main but if you do actions that Jagex deems only a bot would do, it'll get banned within a few days. I got banned for spending a week killing cows for a bond.
---
Maplestory has way worse MTX. MTX users are literally thousands of times more powerful than non MTX players. Imagine non-mtx users in bronze gear, and MTX users in full armadyl with a tbow, and multiply that power gap by about 500
---
Hey thanks for this I‚Äôll start a bot farm doing the same
---
A lot of the reason jagex updates in the fashion they do is to minimize time offline. No one wants to be forced to log out during a pk or while they're in the middle of a run on the fight caves or something.
---
Oh mah gawd...
---
Les* when plural. U have to delete this post now.
---
Who the fuck cares if he sold bonds for gp?

It‚Äôs a rare drop from Tekton

I got that on my 37412 chest.

I was kinda hoping he'd end up like that since he got dharok helm first ):

Yes pet and mutagen, i think both mutagen is possible 2 but not 100%

Don‚Äôt scramble that one...I don‚Äôt think runelite can help you on this one

hey they worked hard for that cape by clicking a couple times an hour

Ofc he didn't
---
kinda hot tho
---
I replied earlier with some first steps to take in ensuring this doesn't happen again. I am happy to hear that you're the type of player to bank everything when you log out. That will help a ton since it takes a week to take a bank pin off so that gives you more then enough time to get this resolved.

Yeah. Harrandel tar has same ranged strenght than rune arrows and what i can tell salamanter has same aps than magic short. I trained bit of range whit it and it feels kinda same or atleast close to msb (i) and rune arrows. Cant tell fore sure coz havent testet it at runelite and seen full on full xps rates. (Mostly afked whit phone doin other stuff) but biggest down side of sallys are that you can use it only at melee range. 
---
i too would like to see some ducks, in favour of this.
---
Most botters get banned for not implementing breaks correctly and botting high ban skills such as agility. If randomizing clicking intervals didn't prevent bans then auto-clicking wouldn't ever work, but you still see people auto-clicking prayers at NMZ or auto-clicking high alch without any issues. And creating a function to draw a curve path for the mouse to move in with randomization in the curve based on a weight value. You would get the randomization in "your" mouse movements that would avoid any detection based on repetitive perfect movements/click intervals. 
---
Lol I like this meme. Idk why it hasn‚Äôt had anymore upvotes.

---
They‚Äôd still have the timer, the game would just be offline for a couple extra minutes. 
---
They changed accounts because of this. You might be able to get yours changed back as well.
---
If not. Honestly I understand the OCD. But it doesnt affect your potential to pk.
---
Good luck getting it rolled back! And if it doesnt yo through, go kill some noobs to feel better.
---
Isn't there always a counter before an update isn't there? I think what OP is suggesting is to take some time after everyone is logged out to back up everything, apply the update, then turn everything on again.

The price of seeds varies quite a bit, and ranarrs can be quite expensive.  If you buy 100 at a time you could see the price change by 10% and have the value change by a couple hundred thousand gp.  Before investing more than a mil familiarize yourself with the GE trends of something like ranarr seeds.
---
If you buy 100 seeds and only sell the ranarrs back a week later, you could see all your profit evaporate, or possibly significantly increase.
---
That is the absolute dumbest thing i‚Äôve ever heard

Do you believe they gained access to my email account? They may have but I don't think they did? I have it tied to my phone so whenever it is logged into for the first time somewhere I have to approve it on my phone. I also looked for emails from jagex on the account and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.

I'll give changing my email's pw a shot though, thanks for the idea.

Northern lights flash in the sky. A blizzard blows, pelting on its way those too weak to withstand the fury of winter at its fullest. From the permafrost strikes a massive hand; the mythical giant once deemed dead off the coast of Italy now rises to life, regenerated, from Lappish soil. The time is due. Around the world, the word spreads. In Sweden, the best of the best cower in fear and lock themselves in the nearest IKEA retail store. The Brazilians run into the safety of the jungle, the Danes play dead in Legoland and the Slavs sprint crying to babushka‚Äôs warm embrace. Enceladus‚Äôs augurs are unleashed upon the scene. Aleksi ‚Äúallu‚Äù Jalli hails from his journey spent in international teams. A man may leave Finland, but Finland never leaves a man. Once again, he picks up the green rifle, this time not for money or fame, but to smite all opposition in the name of Enceladus. Aleksi ‚Äúaleksib‚Äù Virolainen leaves the fabled squad of HAVU to lead what we can finally describe as a Finnish superteam. Under his leadership shall the northern guns spit death and destruction upon foes who wail in their weakness. Jani ‚Äúaerial‚Äù Jussila joins after the biggest transfer of the Finnish e-sport scene from his former team SuperJymy. No longer will he be the only stand-out player of his team, but instead, a vital ingredient of a chaotic cocktail made up of Finland‚Äôs finest. Jere ‚Äúsergej‚Äù Salo thwarts all rumors of desperate Internet trolls trying to tell they know his parents who told him to stop playing. Oh, the humanity! Backed up by the forces at home, bursting from motivation like a wolf thirsting for blood, he returns to ravage everything in his path. Where skill rises to speak, experience sits silent and disciplined. Sami ‚ÄúxseveN‚Äù Laasanen fills the ranks from iGame, for what would the team be if they wouldn‚Äôt buy the best player from every other Finnish team? Vigilantly standing, supporting his teammates be the cause what it pleases to be, he will be the shield and sword his comrades need to achieve the ultimate. The warning has been given. The sky screams, the ground shakes and the oceans boil. ENCE is coming. #EZ4ENCE

This is my second episode of my "Unlock Tree" style gameplay, the whole unlock mechanism really won't make a huge impact on me until I start making more gains and need more in the melee tree particularly. The first PvP build is now complete so I will attempt to get some kills. Constructive criticism is accepted. I'm new to this whole thing and doing this is my spare time because I have always liked the idea of creating a progress series and working to develop more skills.
---
Yes, mutagens are normal drops, zulrah drops 2 normal drops, technically you could get 2 magma mutagens in the same kill, just luck. Pet is a separate drop as well as jar.... So it IS POSSIBLE to roll 2 mutagens, a pet, and a jar all at once.

Actually you can change the login email. When my gf and I split up I changed the email on her acc so I could get the shit back that I lent her since she refused to give it back. It was like 30m worth of stuff lol her dad was calling me the next day to "give her game stuff back!"

This is probably only 65-70m, you can get this back after grinding sultan or corkage for a few days, Easley in a week

I think he is referring to the "anything for molly." Molly being MDMA
---
I understand that, but I feel like something significant like 190m should at least be looked into.
---
That makes sense now that you say it because the biggest ones I've seen are the combat ones. Hydra, olm, arma, etc. Ty for the info

Ok thanks

this wouldn't break his hands though, as I assume every adventure hero in the game is very skilled in Karate.

hey thats a good one you should add this persons suggestion next time!

Raycharley you friccin moron!

But that's not possible???

Supply...and demand...?

Ofc the price goes up when there is less stock...
---
But what if it‚Äôs actually a bug?

I'd also like shuffle in there. Maybe you could shuffle favorites or the entire library.

How many chins?

Yeah that's 1 input to 2 outputs and is not allowed.

Didn‚Äôt block the run energy haha thanks for free acc

Shouldn‚Äôt have typed your login details into that double XP stream then

If some dude can feed his family cause he RWT. Good for him. It's not like he murdered someone. He didnt steal food from the store.
---
He earned the money in game playing like we all did. Put in the time and effort.
---
If what he wants out of it is to eat,and not have BIS gear. All the power to him.
---
This sounds like a good way to get Jagex to ban Runelite. Let‚Äôs not abuse it.
---
Homies just asking for help, stop being so fucking negative. 
---
Tbh, unless you‚Äôre an ironman,  190m is a negligible amount of money nowadays.
---
I realize you‚Äôve worked hard for it and it might be significant to you, but it really isn‚Äôt.

I do not recognize the ducks in the water

I don't think tiles are different for dig spots, it's probably just an position check.

Does the membership from Twitch expire already if you already linked your OSRS to twitch? I had my account linked from the event before and when I clicked redeem today it said I was all set to go, but I still don't have the membership, I'm I missing something?
---
Out of curiosity, whats the unbelievable part of that story? Its not like it ended in a possessive way for me and I wasnt the first college student to get mad at a professor. 
---
Lottie hasn't done runestats in ages. I think mod nastie is the one that is going to do it, but he hasn't posted any either
---
Well, you don't wanna know how that story continued.. 
---
Cheap herbs don't get traded in high enough volume on their unf state, so you'd need a decent investment to get an hour done of unf pot making, and even then I have serious doubts you can break 600k an hour. Recommending a new player checks for margins and invests most of their banks to make money is not a good suggestion.
---
At that point, running blast furnace, picking white berries or maybe even doing agility pyramid are all more consistent and less risky ways to make money
---
I know I'm two days late but if anyone sees this can you fill me in on why there was a rollback?
---
Meet Runelite, my completely locked client.
---
After recently abusing one of its features, Jagex decided to up the ante and scratch out the client from history.
---
All stemming from one problem: because some swamp dude did temple trekking.
---
I do not want to give these Ducks ground within my Woodcutting guild. I dont trust their evil agenda.
---
Now watch ginger gonna beat Inferno first try today 
---
not even slightly, there are 2 ways to interpret this in my mind
---
\&gt; In the end it will even out, everything will be the same relative gp/h in the end. 
---
Either the gp/h will stay relatively the same as now, which would be asinine why even get rid of bots then.
---
the second is that even with the price of said skilling materials going up whatever they were being used in would also go up gp wise so it would relatively balance out.  This doesn't work for many reasons, the demand doesn't change or at least not as much as the supply does as the amount of bots that are consumers vs producers is very very very lopsided in favor of producers. So the amount of let's say willow logs on the market will be much much smaller, this in turn will make skills like firemaking way more expensive as well as planks, sure making those planks is probably more lucrative now, but the person losing the planks is only losing on this equation as they pay more for the same product.  Things like bossing will be less gp/h because the materials used to create the potions and food will be more expensive requiring each investment for kills to be higher.  Now if your boss drops resources this can somewhat balance out, however if it's not one that does so in plentiful quantities you will be making less money p/hr now.  Runescape is a free market, when you take out majority of the big suppliers who give products for low cost and now the base materials costs more so does everything else.  This would most certainly cause your purchasing power to decrease, it's just simple math, less supply with nearly the same demand = higher prices.  
---
Was yesterday and really fun! I will stream but much more chilled out one

---
95% sure that no. Don't quote me on that, though.
---
Tbh I can never remember them off by heart
---
What are you doing here? Didn't you quit? 
---
Fake
---
dude you lost like 500gp
---
It‚Äôs still better in the long run and anyone can agree, runescape is a long run.
---
So my above example makes sense? If I buy something from a school shooter I'm directly supporting their firearm economy?
---
Actually fuck it, buying a bond doesn't. If a bond is bought from Jagex the moment I pay for it with gp then I would agree. But the bond has been already bought, the money is in Jagex pockets already. If I buy the bond or someone else does or nobody does they won't return the money to the buyer.
---
Yes, using a bot that has EVER been used than more a few people is a guaranteed ban because the system can track the similarities
---
that wouldn't solve the problem because the bots would move to another mob. stuff like brutal black dragons and gagoyles are botted 24/7 as well.
---
Not the only tab. I had around 700 prayer potions. A dwarf cannon and 10000 cannon balls I was going to use haha
---
Why does he bring an onyx into raids with him? I don't get it.
---
Are you limited to 1 totem? I have a complete totem in my bank and 2 pieces but third won‚Äôt drop.
---
This ginger is so lucky
---
Then pvp clans will own every area that has the most profit. Nopee
---
Bread kills ducks bro. Seedless grapes are much better for ducks 
---
I apologize but I still don't see how they'd be meta changing. I feel that way especially for PvP the main use would be for 60 att pures to use as a slightly more accurate spec weapon instead of stacking msb into gmaul, but it will still be outclassed by gmaul's potential damage. I really don't see how something not as good as a dragon battleaxe and a 1 arrow shooting bow similar to the dark bow changes the meta. Just use those weapons or even one of the many better ones out there. 
---
They would be niche for people who want enjoy thematically using a weapon, namely lower level players that this content is aimed towards.
---
What if the dig locations arnt active until the update/day they release the clue? 
---
Making merch doesn't take 6 months and someone doing it faster doesn't automatically mean it is "terrible quality" stop lying and hurry up or deal with it when someone actually delivers on a good idea before you.

Ducks are rapists. Why do you want have an update that benefits rapists!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!
---
It's a fucking joke. Usually I'm all for helping those that you can, but here they could help everyone and made the choice to exclusively help one person only. It's disgusting and reprehensible on the part of Jagex. Either help everyone you fucked or no one, but by helping just one person it's a massive middle finger to everyone else. It's admitting culpability while also telling everyone you don't give a shit. 
---
I know this is your alt, /u/fuckswithducks

You can't fool me!

yea i think a guy on here a long time ago got 2 mutagens and pet in one drop or like 1 mutagen and pet and fang or something crazy like that

it's 2019, why use wit when you can simple brute force things?

I mean all farming works off of real time. Your analogy makes no sense. The bonuses aren't worth much unless you're playing efficiently which you obviously aren't.

Hope u can get it back, last i saw they werent even done rolling back pures from a couple weeks ago that got def levels

God I got this weird ass system that evolved from RS where I mostly use the peck method but I mix in my middle and ring fingers with my indexes for nearby keys and it's a complete fucking mess I don't understand how I've arrived at this point when it would actually be easier for me to learn to type like a normal person, since clearly I know where all the keys are

No we don't. Most pmods only got the position because they play a ton or kissed a bunch of ass. 99% of them are worthless.

Might get rid of some of the tension and maybe more ironmen will vote yes to pvp updates lol
---
i just love ducks so much oh golly
---
And he got dex scroll 2kc later lol
---
no
---
Saw someone go from 30 to 99 str in 2 months here.  At 100% efficiency you are getting 12k str xp/hr without hp.  Not including crashers and coke furnace issues this would take 1200 hours to 99.  2 months is 1440 hours.  That means this guy pumped for 24 hours a day for two months straight and Jagex still allows everyone to sit here using 3rd party auto typers.  This should be classified as botting.  No difference than running a woodcutting bot.
---
If somebody tells you can you let me know, also curious

I think I‚Äôm retarded - I always thought the country flag next to the worlds was just an indicator in case you‚Äôd prefer to play with people who are more from your area / your culture / speak your language. Am I wrong? Is there actually an advantage in terms of connection and speed if I live in the USA and play on a world with a USA flag? And if so, how‚Äôs that work?
---
Umm.. he‚Äôs doing infernal first

Untrimmed too, gz!

Not with that attitude.

Considering I made this in Paint 3D a couple of hours ago, I‚Äôm impressed it‚Äôs been posted elsewhere!

This isn't white knighting

This is calling out a cringy, creepy kid who obviously has something wrong with him. There's even other comments calling it out
---
Good idea

Can't you just type the number? I know it works like that for Jewelry box on mobile, not sure why it wouldn't work for slayer ring.
---
"&gt;" was what was used to quote way back in the day

and no, but the way he did it was so over the top it's just kinda disturbing tbh.
---
Thanks a lot!

Unlucky you aren't an ironman
---
That's some brainlet tier shit. Why would you use it to double money and not just sell the account?
---
But no xp waste... Other families and officers will understand.
---
that's so annoying, i dont have 65 woodcutting. I hate anything related to the museum, it's such a mess to keep track of what I did and did not.
---
You can't any more, that's what the guy I responded to was talking about.
---
Ironmen will never vote yes to pvp updates they're terrified of wilderness
---
Plleeeaaaassseee yes
---
Yes, there are servers in different parts of the world.  There are 2 server locations in the US I believe, so you might have a higher ping to some worlds with the US flag.  The new Australian worlds have servers in Australia which was a big deal for them, since they were on the other side of the planet of all the other servers.

Unless you are prayer flicking, pking, or doing other high level content you probably wouldn't notice, Runescape was optimized to work on the internet infrastructure of 15 years ago.

use your bank on smithing then build back at blast furnace which is like 500k p/h

Imagine being so socially maladjusted that this comes off as 100% serious.
---
Yeah nty. I don't want my client actively hiding shit from me that's visible normally. Fuck that's the exact opposite reason why I use the client in the first place 
---
I have no idea how to read all of that
---
Personally I think Woox's approach is more technically interesting than thinking about random associations. If Jagex doesn't want brute-forcing to occur they can design the puzzles thus.
---
Jad helper gone but cerb helper still here :eyes:

Whats the recommended setup for making profit at wryms? I was just doin d hide and then str armor and melee weps with sharks. Then decided to try rune c bow with protect from magic, but this seems to cut into profit way more. I could use blowpipe, but dont think that would be worth it.
---
I've also thought about just skipping wyrms for now on, but i seem to get them pretty often. What do you guys think?
---
I gotta know man, what was the TL;DR of these comments before he deleted them and was it actually OP who replied?
---
Range trains a lot slower but is better eventually.  I'd recommend not touching slayer until at least 40s in all combats really though.  Just slow and bad tasks make it really rough.  If this is your main account though (not making a specific pure build or something similar) I highly recommend training it all relatively evenly.
---
do tree runs, i get them so often i can‚Äôt even use them fast enough
---
oh my days

Bring a quick tele dipshit
---
s1mple played lackadaisically and got punished for it. He played "fine" for the most part of the game but in key moments he made the wrong decisions and it was mostly because he was undisciplined/careless. In every clutch moment he wanted forced instead of playing on time. So predictable. 
---
üêß
---
hehe i got skeletal visage on 25kc from vorkyboi
---
When did I ever think it was serious, are you actually retarded?
---
It's just so cringy and over the top, trying way too hard.
---
I laughed so hard my cock ring fell off
---
But... that wasn‚Äôt you
---
You sat there and watched 20 hours of combat at sand crabs? How do you make it "not afk"? All you do is reset 6 times an hour.
---
Anyway, seeing as your a trade account you should be focusing on trying to earn gp and finishing quests. If you were an ironman I would say kill blue dragons and bury their bones, but that's not terribly efficient.
---
You could kill blue dragons on this account and collect bones that way, but it's fairly slow and you constantly have to teleport to Falador to bank since 12 dragon kills and you will usually have a full inventory. So at best you'll be banking like 7-10k prayer experience an hour, so if you did that for 20 hours you'd only get like 50-60 prayer.
---
Pretty much I feel you're asking the wrong question and trying to solve way to specific of a problem for your account. You strike me as a bit of a noob and what you should be doing is working on quests, untradeables, and a good money maker.
---
For the record big bones are terrible experience outside of levels 1 to 32 or so. If you're 43 prayer already I'd recommend dragon bones or wyrm bones.
---
OR do your Aercues favour(The purple Hosidious house) and train prayer via ensouled heads. You can buy chaos druid heads for like 700-950 gp each and they give like 600 prayer experience back per head. They also have 30 hitpoints so you get melee/range/hp training as well as tertiary prayer experience from spawning the heads.

On June 23, 2005, I randomly decided to put "5000" into my RS name and open what was my third account at the time (I forgot the passwords for the other two before, unfortunately). Little did I know that this game would follow me for more than thirteen years, and I don't think any other game I've played has lived up to its longevity or play time.
---
Total time on OSRS: 4 days, 4 hours, 17 minutes (100 hours 17 minutes), most of the play time was in the last 2-3 months.
---
Total time on RS3 (including older iterations of RS) : 6 days, 19 hours, 1 minute (163 hours 1 minute).
---
In total, I've spent 263.3 hours on RS, and as a casual gamer this might just be my most significant achievement ever.
---
I've also been an f2p player for the longest time, picking up and putting down this game over a few years at a time, without the money nor time to pay for membership, so for now, I've started to hit a plateau. Perhaps I'll pick this game up once again down the line. Sadly I still do not have the time nor monetary means to get membership (\*cries in student\*) but maybe one day we will find some time for it.
---

Honestly herbiboar is a bit of an anomaly because it got snuck in without a poll and nobody knew about it until the content was released so I kind of want to say no to it coming from herbiboars, but it should come from everything else. Just because it's a chinchompa doesn't mean that every other piece of hunter content shouldn't have a chance at getting it. On the topic of it making sense does it make sense that a raccoon comes out of picking somebodies pocket? You can get the squirrel from even the most early agility course, but with the hunter pet you can't get it until 53 hunter and you will only stand a chance with this method while every other skilling pet has multiple options (besides herbiboar, but that one is an abnomaly.).

You are assuming the only crafting XP I have gained is through glass. And even if it was it would take less than 2 years to bank enough sand for 66-99 crafting with air battlestaffs. So yes I‚Äôve let Bert deliver sand to my bank for probably a year and a half or so.

You're here trying to get at least a zenyte, and I'm here trying to get a black demon task since i completed mm2, that was at 69 slayer ...... now I am  80 slayer still without that task.

---
I'd be down

117 combat

I can tank, but have never formally done bandos.
---
I'll have some time tomorrow into the am.. what's your rsn?
---
Getting agility for rfd is not that bad. Will take you less than a day of casual play honestly. Also RFD is the #1 absolute best goal/grind to aim for first on an account. Barrow gloves are beyond worth it. I also suggest wearing an amulet lol unless you took yours off or i just am blind. 
---
Fire cape your stats are fine, just get 75range for blowpipe and you'll stomp it. Very easy with 70 def/75 range as you can wear some tankier armor with blowpipe. Just be willing to give it a try first to experience the waves and how its all set up. B gloves tho unlock many necessary quests and also skills. Your stats are close enough to get them already anyway. No reason to wait. Go for b gloves, torso, d def, fire cape. Get all the untradeables out the way. Will boost your efficiency and exp rates for everything. Its well worth!
---
With my daily schedule and playing style I tend to only play in short segments throughout the day. Farming is the perfect skill for me. No idea what to do next lol
---
Why do you think tb has anything to do with multi combat?
---
im fighting galvek with super antifire and blowpipe, my dps is okay but im wasting way too much food to the point that i cant get out of the first phase. His orange and white attacks seem to proc "you're horribly by the dragon's fiery/corrupting breath" every dragon before this super antifire seemed to completely mitigate this. I'm relatively low level but should be able to do it imo idk why im taking so much damage from the dragon attacks?
---
ive said it before and ill say it again. they're probably not bots just gold farming accounts and theres no proof to ban until gold gets transfered
---
Why was he trying to anti lure... Just why...
---
Can confirm, got mine at 223 and is my favorite pet
---
What was your first?
---
Because I just didn't care to get it.  It's not required for 99.
---
33m isn't a lot. Set yourself up for long term. Get the essentials together. Whip, fury, blowpipe, fill a trident or 2, guthans, Slayer helmet, d boots, blessed dhide set, mystic set, ammo, runes, food, potions, etc. First thing I'd say get a whip, get 70 defense, get 70 prayer via dragon bones on the wilderness altar,complete King's Ransom, and get piety unlocked. Then work on stocking up on the essentials. Afterwards, assuming you geared up like I suggested, you'll have nearly base 70s and around 100cb. I recommend grinding Slayer through Nieve. She gives the best tasks for experience, and has the best tasks table for cannon/barrage Slayer at later levels. 
---
I hate the way they introduced magic and range prayer, i mean seriously the cost/difficulty of getting them is retarded compared to the piss easy melee version.
---
Hey how do I pull this log up? Sorry for noob question.

Thats a big screen
---
im sorry but if you get lured its your own dumbass fault
---
I read the entire thing and agree you should get your money back, but why even include the part about staking? You could‚Äôve just had the very beginning and the very end parts and been fine but you wanted to fit in this flex. 
---
Whats the weapon

C engineer has a good PVP world only HCIM series with a 200m bounty on his status lol

They are higher dps than trident of the seas.
---
'new'
---
it was just backed up and you got it all at once thats all
---
That was his plan originally, then he got dex 2 kill count later and went straight to infernal cape. 
---
I believe that people are not outraged enough. I think most are like you were before this post: they don‚Äôt understand how ridiculously flawed their security is. It‚Äôs a fucking shit show. 
---
This is beautiful.
---
no, use compost

Or you could just look up on the wiki. People don't memorize different fairy ring codes. Hell I don't thing I've ever used a fairy ring code to go to edgeville when amulets exist

Haha yeah i guess so. :p was literally messaging my buddy cause we both have shit shard luck and i kept sending "oh another..another..wtf another?!" 
---
Yea I know that it doesn‚Äôt really matter, I‚Äôm just telling you that it isn‚Äôt possible since you somehow thought it was...
---
I would like to suck the fanny juice out of this moot 
---
You are not a smart man.

Because you have disabled them

Thought so. Thanks for the reply!

You must have a poop jar next to your piss bottle then.

The toggle will not switch them, and on mobile there are no options 
---
Yes there are people who wouldn't mine. But the dev time and small payoff isn't work it, and it they said they aren't even sure if they could. Kieren already gave it a shot.

"jagex please fix my stupidity!"

Looks like a gummi worm

Is there imps in morytania?

But the feels when you get through it all are worth it
---
Holy shit you guys waste so much time making, posting, and discussing useless updates.
---
I'm more talking about the cost issue re: toxic trident
---
Probably by 
---
I think you're over-exaggerating. If you want the benefits all you have to do is plant a new seed. You don't have even have to change gear. It is literally faster than doing a birdhouse run, which can be done in under 2 minutes. If life gets busy then you aren't playing the game so you don't get the benefits anyways. There is no penalty for not playing.
---
What you described in your post is essentially how pretty much all farming works, so I don't fully understand your argument. 
---
What the fuck was this recorded on, Hypercam 1?
