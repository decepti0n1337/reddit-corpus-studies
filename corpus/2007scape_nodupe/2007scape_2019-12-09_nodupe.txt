&gt;People like u who get so passionate about other men kicking balls around is y i never got into watching sports

...
---
&gt;Because people like you are so passionate about football I dont want to get into football

It is quite literally what you said

Works for me with total worlds I can't get into... Click on the 2000 total world - loads up - change world once mobile is loaded - works just as normal
---
I mean, they gotta have moneys from our membership and bond payments to buy at least like mithril wheels or something ffs.
---
The wilderness is the wilderness. It‚Äôs purpose is to be an abandoned and scarce environment roamed by monsters and not people and towns. Why would u think it is a good idea to add an arena to the wildly. It literally removes the fundamental aspect of the wilderness
---
He meant is 50/50/50 to get 3 in 40 kills. It works out to 1
---
Work is getting in the way of my Twisted grind so it's been two days little progress.
---
Oh sorry, i misunderstood the entire post i think. Its a good idea, would these purchases have a time limit? (Ie f2p does not raise 10b for a year, would the benefits be removed?)
---
Rally at Fally!
---
This is dope
---
yeah I've been experiencing this all day
---
Don‚Äôt you guys have phones?
---
[deleted]
---
Cobra Kai!
---
Duck swim mud
---
I mean Twisted League is literally just a private server, it's not like this would affect game play at all.

Try opening the app thru the osrs website. Click on world select on the front page from your phone, it should redirect you to the app and it should launch
---
RIP cube sale x2
---
you're right. I made one last night and wanted to play today. i'll be sure to edit my initial post in order to be entirely accurate. Thanks for the helpful advice!
---
Now you have blown their cover.
---
No worries. I believe a lot of people have misunderstood so far. Lol It would all depend. I was thinking two weeks to a month for this example. The benefits would not enter the game until the donation period ends, so there wouldn't be any removal. However, there's a lot of people who are a lot smarter than I, so as to how it would actually be implemented would probably be different.
---
Yeah i can see what you mean.. but when i see stuff like this all i can think about is the huge amounts of ‚Äúcustom‚Äù items that RSPS‚Äôs used to offer.
---
thank for protecting lumby all thos yrs ago
---
great, thanks!
---
Achievement diaries and quests are great ways to explore new areas and really dig in to everything the game has to offer while also being quite rewarding! If you have near 70s in most stats you‚Äôll be able to do a lot of the easy-medium tier diary tasks and have the skill requirements for most quests. Questing is also a great way to get some experience with medium tier pvm encounters as many quests feature unique bosses. There are plenty of quest guides on YouTube and the official runescape wiki to help you along your way.
---
Ok so it's not just me? The servers have been terrible lately.
---
so just logged into my account today. its been about 3-4 months since I played osrs. and 95% of my stuff was gone. I had 220 mill before and was with a bond in my inventory waiting to use it. I had gotten a notice that all my different accounts google, amazon, epic games were getting hacked. anyway, I think I have gotten most of my accounts back to normal. and then I log into osrs and yea everything is gone. I don't think Jagex will be able to get my stuff back. anyone have any ideas on what I should do.
---
I feel I don't have high enough IQ to understand how good this meme is...
---
The circus is in town
---
am current technician. turning it off and on again is a large part of my troubleshooting. Have had many unresolvable issues magically fix themselves with a reboot, both Mac and PC.
---
No, theres a statement about it aswell. The lag is horrible :/
---
Nice
---
It only works on PC clients, but it's lagging on every server there
---
There were some but YouTube/google removed them
---
You know, right and left wingers shouting at each other how their media is lying remind me of religious conflicts. They argue whose god is better and truer and I don't get how you can be that religious in the first place when it's all based on opinions and beliefs.
---
( Õ°‚óâ Õú ñ Õ°‚óâ)
---
It literally would.
---
Apparently jagex pays a fraction of what other game companies do, and much much less than standard software companies.
---
So if you work for jagex, you do it cause you like the game and are otherwise doing well, cause they get paid shit and have job skills that could get them a better job pretty quickly.
---
World 428 is seemingly lag-free. It's a 2k total world though. There are some other worlds that are ok.
---
What world lol
---
Should have added a "connection lost" message in the top left corner.
---
Already voted for him on my main and 4 alts, fuck you
---
I honestly thought it was my internet. Glad it was a server side issue
---
yes, its regular client, osb and runelite.
---
Is it bad that I read this whole post with a Venezuelan accent?
---
It's a huge bummer. I wonder what happened.
---
I can‚Äôt connect with mobile :/
---
Boomer isn't an age, it's a mindset.
---
Network technician here. Rofling at the fact they've had outages over 24 hours. That's just horrific. The fact that it's over 24 hours kinda suggests that the problem is out of their hands (i.e, datacenter or ISP). To have an outage over 24 hours is just terrible service. 
---
Get Nagstamon Jagex infra team.
---
Plus the mobile issues. They addresses it but it‚Äôs been continuing far after.
---
Doubt it.
---
eloquently said, sir.
---
With the servers right now you might end up with winterdot in your garden tbh
---
I understand that, but this post is purely about mobile. 
---
Is the shit server situation due to the bug from last week?
---
Lmao son, ending free trade means no duel arena, no drop-spawning itens and no pking directly.
---
Why lag
---
It was actually 34 medium clues not 31, I had my chatbar scrolled up :P
---
Just DONT FLETCH to keep that fletching level at a sexy 69 ;)
---
They can't even bless my fucking holy symbol.
---
All the plebs with shitternet
---
Have there ever been any talks amongst the Jmod crew to remove the duel arena? 
---
 
---
Genuinely curious.
---
I don't think anyone really knows for sure.
---
Only if we move the GE to where the arena used to be
---
no, not every task. for some monsters range would be ill-suited,  Just use it wherever you can! Prioritize it. If your doing afk melee try to bring a cannon. 
---
Fact is you have put in most of the hard work and built a great base for money making - all you need is that range up! Then you just get to kill shit and rake in profits.
---
I personally cant stand new-ironman content, and I've heard a lot of people say the same over the years. Just the same old shit every time, unless you can somehow switch it up, idk. Wish I could help
---
It's the lag, i noticed a similar thing with my divine pots at bandos
---
I mean the damage scales based on your HP, that's why alot of people do it as the first thing on ironmen.
---
Glad I could help! I was frustrated with the issue myself and found that to be the most efficient way until the mobile developers fix the connectivity issues with their application.
---
An accurate and factual news source cannot, by definition, be biased.
---
Also, if you scroll down in that link, it shows that not only is fox news biased, but that its claims are often untrue.
---
They arent only biased, they're inaccurate.
---
Edit:
---
"We also rate them Mixed factually and borderline based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared. Further, Fox News would be rated a Questionable source based on numerous failed fact checks by hosts and pundits, however straight news reporting is generally reliable, therefore we rate them Mixed for factual reporting."
---
I just spent 15 mins reading every message
---
But why is the XP blacked out?? Am I the only one wondering this?? Also how long have you been online for??? These are the real concerns here...
---
Always online services do not ALWAYS run into issues like these.
---
Oh, cool. Ok so you want to not only remove the duel arena, all drops, and completely and utterly destroy the wild. Just like they did in RS3.
---
So basically they'd be GE-allowed ironmen. Everyone.
---
OK, so they start taking absolutely obscene obscure items on the GE and using that to trade gold.
---
What then?
---
You're basically saying "let's make OSRS an MMO where players are basically just in a chatroom".
---
That's... insane. And stupid. Or you're a terrible troll. So my initial statement stands.
---
Hopefully they figure out the issue soon to get the game at least running 100% so they can start looking into the mobile issue. I've been hearing from my clan that the game is nearly unplayable. I dont know how, but the only lag issues I've been noticing is from my crappy wifi while I'm in korea.
---
Look at the workaround
---
[Workaround](https://i.imgur.com/niyQXhr.png)
---
The you can finally play the game
---
Inferno has been out for 2.5 years too! Nice.
---
There are also 162,274 fire capes at this moment, which when compared to rarity between the different skillcapes would put it between the Ranged skillcape (185k) and the Cooking skillcape (146k)
---
Edit: aahh the other two posts certainly made a fair point. Hadn't thought of that! :)
---
Probably also important to consider the scale of their consumer base
---
Try a 2200 world
---
I'm making waffles!
---
Kodai wand.
---
Lmao
---
Dude its not anyones internet. Quit bein ignorant. Theres an actual lag issue with the servers right now
---
Sounds like something a bot would say hmm
---
LMAO
---
No they definitely don't I have multiple offers up after months.
---
thanks rendi

Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/2007scape. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also search for comments.
---
If you would like this roundup sent to your reddit inbox every day send me a message with the subject ['2007scape'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=2007scape&amp;message=x).

---
However, I can do more.. you can have me search  for any keywords you want on any subreddit you want. Send a message with the subject ['set 2007scape'](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=subredditsummarybot&amp;subject=set%202007scape&amp;message=200%0A25%2C%20keyword1%2C%20another keyphrase%2C%20last example) and in the message: specify a number of upvotes that must be reached, and then an optional list of keywords you want to search for, separated by commas. You can have as many lines as you'd like, as long as they follow this format:
---
    200

I tried 30 different worlds trying to get the workaround to work, it worked yesterday but I gave up on using mobile today. Though it's not as if I could really do much other than skill with the constant stuttering lag going on right now either.
---
I once had an account called ‚Äúwcing bot‚Äù at Seers village cutting yews that I actually botted with but nobody reported me thinking it was a joke or something; I would come back to the screen and read the public chat and people seemed to love it lol.
---
They should have a hcuim no shops allowed
---
And 69‚Äôd.
---
Is there a new way?
---
That‚Äôs possible because I was definitely 80
---
Well there are still some but not in the mainstream. That‚Äôs mainly what I meant, sorry for the confusion.
---
couldnt tell if the video had finished or it was just lag
---
omw
---
No shop mode (okay but with some shops XD)
---
Peaky Blinders paid them
---
I love this, if there's not going to be better armor than Bandos, Armadyl etc, at least let us change up the look of it, maybe through future boss drops as untradeables.
---
Np gl with the rng
---
Any word on fix? No issues charging me for membership when your servers don‚Äôt work...
---
I have had to play on UK servers the past few days. All US worlds have really inconsistent ping and sketchy tick delay.
---
I believe it's like a sub-set of the same company, but with an address in America. I don't know the correct terminology, but have read it's something to do with taxes.
---
Lmao even private servers on Moparscape had faster respond time then this.
---
GO TEAM LINK!!!
---
Yeah, I've started doing Wildy slayer now - Didn't have much of a plan nor was I following a certain build with this account so I just kinda did what I want without thinking about the effects on Slayer. Most likely not going to start over, I'll just work my way around it even if it means a lot more hours.
---
i mean lately the osrs mobile servers has been more off than on
---
It'll be your fault if you die because your playing in these conditions. Thats like running outside in a storm and ~~with a metal rod and~~ being angry that you can get struck by lightning.
---
definitely ratcatchers, in ardougne
---
Yes sir we'll get right on it
---
Found the rs3 player.
---
agreed
---
Yes what is way?
---
He's describing what currently happens that would be removed in the proposed update.  People pk on their iron men and loot on an alt.  They wouldnt be able to do that anymore.
---
$11 a month by the way
---
Try a different world I‚Äôve run into some worlds that lag and others that don‚Äôt
---
Yes, I should of probably thought about it but I'm not planning on starting over; I'll just do Wildy slayer for points and go from there. Slayer isn't even essential for this I was just doing it while I levelled range because I didn't feel like I had any reason not to.   
---
On the off chance I ever make something like this again I'll know not to do Priest In Peril now haha
---
crab rave is just a meme itself look it up and you‚Äôll understand
---
wrong comment i think brother
---
What ü¶Ä a ü¶Ä fucking ü¶Ä brilliant ü¶Ä post. ü¶ÄSuch ü¶Ä grace ü¶Ä and ü¶Ä elegance, ü¶Ä it ü¶Ä speaks ü¶Ä to ü¶Ä me ü¶Ä on ü¶Ä a ü¶Ä metaphysical ü¶Ä level.
---
We pay we gay
---
Victim complex
---
Looking back on it now,   
---
People started having problems logging in past midnite on friday (Jiggleflox HQ time). Considering the convenient time, maybe someone was trying to duplicate the coin bug? No way to know.  
---
Fast forward 8 hours or so, Jagex started to arrive in office and a quick patch was done to allow us to login but then servers started to lag intermittently. It is highly likely the lag is caused by the quick patch.
---
Remove duel arena = massive inflation
---
Yup, don't mind that too much regardless, just means I'm going to have to work out a few things.
---
I had an account called ‚ÄúFally guard6‚Äù and I made it look just like the Falador guards with the same combat level and everything; maybe I should make another one just for the heck of it to mess with people.
---
It's a trap!
---
So what ( sorry I may have missed it) would you want to replace the drops with?
---
Every time you kill a wyvern there is a 1/10k chance it will drop. That means that the chance to get a visage from a wyvern is the same on the first kill and 1 millionth kill. It is all just luck based. However, wyverns are pretty profitable and they are worth camping just to farm gp
---
its when you can spend like ¬£3.50 to get 6m of ingame currency without doing anything in the ga- wait a minute
---
Lets gooo
---
Anyone else reporting insane lag issues for the PC client?
---
Just wanna say SUPER thank you because after trying on and off all day, just got Runelite and was finally able to play and I am ecstatic now! I wish I could afford to offer you the coolness of reddit gold or something but alas &lt;3
---
Depends on your account. People hated Wyverns.  The best thing to do is just grind all bosses for the rng drops or mega farm whichever boss/mob you're best equipped for.
---
Could get it first kill. Could go 20k dry.
---
Or just Slayer if it's not 99 yet
---
There are some phishing websites so make sure you get it from the official website which is runelite.net
---
You can expect like 80-100 kills per hour, so plan to sit there for 100 or more hours.
---
Frankly, it's not worth it.
---
"Join in world 302"
---
Yeah if I could get on the game lol
---
Are you really sucking off someone for posting more on reddit?
---
This lag is affecting the entire game. Economy as well. Nobody is playing cause it's so horrible.
---
Ancient wyverns (on Fossil Island) are not nearly as profitable.
---
Owl gal, there solved
---
Nuclear
---
sounds hot
---
Is this actually what gnomes look like in RS3?
---
You can handle it for a few dozen kills per trip with just an inv of food and protect from melee.
---
Jamflex
---
Sweet, this is what I was looking for. Thanks.
---
Getting in on this meme early. To the top!
---
Not sure tho I think it belongs with half full jug of wine and some other midsummer event items, cool, more discontinued items.
---
They may update the ecto phials and turn empty ones into full ones
---
Blows my mind tbh
---
I see you got 40 kills, thanks for the account bud
---
This is so brave
---
Glad this isn't just happening to me! I was wondering...
---
No, they need to own their mistakes.
---
You can expect to be there until you get one from a drop.
---
Rip üò¢
---
Good luck
---
Sad
---
Are the servers plugged in?
---
If you don't put limitations on it then people will get barrow gloves on 1 def.
---
Been taking quite a break from OSRS, what happened?
---
We're not sure if that's the case but it might as well be
---
NDA's and classified information exist for a reason but there's always some edgy rebel to leak it and cause even more trouble
---
Then again, we dont know if that's the case
---
Can confirm, this worked
---
What you mean it‚Äôs my friend Gary, he was in the hood and he came by chilling and he just doing some clickity click click for me. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
What did I miss
---
I still don't understand why we even have bonds.
---
I got a 2 gp coif ftr, would like to see a 1gp reward
---
Have you tried setting it to Wumbo?
---
*Warning, this spell takes a long time to cast*
---
Cant even get the client's open
---
Yeah that dude was really entertaining to watch back in the day. Last I heard he was organizing a dmm group on like the first or second season.
---
They may as well. 50/50 chance every fight. People will start conspiracy theories about which are better. Would be the fking same as it is right now minus all the bullshit potential
---
Are you really telling someone off for sucking someone off for posting more on reddit?
---
I clicked on this once ONCE and since I have been getting this gal in my recommended nonstop. Not that she is bad she is actually quite talented. But damn I just wanted the quick fix.
---
I've heard that the current lag if from jagex changing the OSRS servers to RS3s old servers as they are getting an upgrade and not from people trying to dupe, which makes sense as the worlds are still lagging at 50 people on them (2k worlds) so it's obvious not people trying to dupe cause this or you'd see the worlds full.
---
Definitely just cancelled my membership. Fuck this shit.
---
Edgy and sensational
---
The duel arena should be a safe zone but with no bank
---
An Ironman accused me of using a macro at NMZ  earlier and when confronted he refused to back down, no idea how people come to these assumptions.
---
it really doesn't make sense to me $/GP BAD! but also $/GP GOOD! 
---
Who are you in the first place to question his story, did you see him buying gold of a 3rd party website?  if not then you can't say for 100% cerain that he did. you just assume he does for  ????? reason. 
---
The fact that his account is not banned for RWT and according to you he must have nearly bought 1B also contradicts your believe. 
---
your personal dislike of ''thrid party RWT'' and why it's worse than ''Jagex RWTed Gold'' is dumb. have a nice day.
---
It's just gotten to the point where it's easier to get pure essence than rune essence. Pure ess is dropped by a variety of monsters and by the thousands in raids, vs for regular ess I don't know if anything drops it.
---
I did unstrung dstone amulets and profited about 10m getting 99 crafting. You just have to keep a watchful eye on the prices and pounce when they're good
---
The thing is--rigour makes u alot of money as well. Can easilly squeeze a few more trips out with it and you have to weigh how much waiting to purchase it down the road will "cost" you.
---
Tbh at 99 hp and being a main (I assume) do it when you have the best pool and jewellery box. Just tele home after and tele back. I normally dont eat anything on wt worlds.
---
jagex is my uncle 
---
does that mean üò≥üò≤üò≥
---
Stevie Wonder, he's blind.
---
Seeing you melee dust devils hurts me inside
---

---
Now I know why 302 os lagging.....
---
I highly doubt they have competent people running their infra... they can‚Äôt afford real customer support
---
4!
---
Bre√¶√ºhst√§benheimero
---
Rigour is insane. Absolutely buy it.
---
I had to read this like 8 times to process what it meant. It is funny though üëç
---
Feels like dial up
---
Shit it‚Äôs even a solution for devs... I was coding for a 3rd party program and ran into some issues.  The vendor recommended rebooting the server to see if the code would run
---
I play with bonds so getting two days jacked from me makes me have to make up for it which is bull, i have to grind an extra 5 hours to make up for it.
---
Congrats, King!
---
Blown away that Jagex hasn‚Äôt said anything about it or told us they are fixing... what‚Äôs going on
---
I wouldnt gonto falador during any issues with the game. Didnt work out so well in the past.
---
Yeah I hate the mod gee stuff
---
Who could‚Äôve guessed, releasing a video showing how to dupe shit by crashing the servers was a bad idea.
---
Absolutely nobody saw this coming. Nobody.
---
Gives me DSL flashbacks.
---
‚ÄúLegacy PvM‚Äù cc 110+ bossing clan, firecape, barrows gloves, 70 agility and 30m PvM gear required.
---
Rigour 100% worth. I bought for 95m and would do it all again
---
Ironic when speaking about a bunch of people crying.
---
Tried about ten random worlds in every region, pvp, free, members, no dice.
---
Thanks for trying anyway though.
---
Meh, keep crying and being a little bitch about it I guess.
---
Head to oldschool.runescape.com in your browser and click play, then select a twisted league world or an Aus world. The app should open up, once you're on the loading screen you can select the world you want.
---
Other possible names: 
---

- Penance Queen Hat

- Penance Master Hat
---
Hey thanks! Havent thought of this
---
As an Ironman and a very reckless one at that (I lost my hardcore status very fast), I like the death mechanics as they are. It‚Äôs hard enough getting some items and if I die it‚Äôs nice not stressing to retrieve them like in the old days.
---
I see lots of people do that with raid items. A team gets an arcane prayer scroll (worth around ~5m iirc) and they stake it to make their split actually worth something lol
---
Which is why there should also be restrictions on how to do it. Only players with accounts older than x amount of time can submit applications etc...
---
Oh, for fucks sake. The cry babies are out in full force today.
---
Do you honestly believe for a second that Jagex is not working to fix this? Do you have any idea how big this issue in their company right now? This is easily a Sev1 problem for any company. 
---
If you want to leave, go for it. But calm down. We all know there are problems. Jagex is fully aware there are problems. Jagex is probably working their fucking asses off trying to fix them. It's obviously a big problem that requires extensive troubleshooting and fixing.
---
Works for me...
---
He‚Äôs not wrong though. 1.50 ain‚Äôt shit
---
Yup its reddit and they see one post about it and hive mind without thinking. Then it's all you see being posted.
---
New feature, procrastination
---
I don't understand why you'd mine these if you can get the ones in the mining guild. This obviously isn't on ftp.
---
Yes. Now kiss. Or fuck, your choice.
---
It's either because people want to crash the servers for duping, they want are upset because they are banned and are showing revenge, or jagex has changed something in their bot detection that has caused a massive strain on the servers. 
---
It could be that the mobile servers are down because the mass botting to crash the servers was due to mobile bots.  Jagex could be limiting the access to mobile players to combat the mass bots.
---
And very legal
---
You can make RL not display your name in the top corner.
---
Says the 6 day old account too afraid to post on their real account over fear of losing fake internet points lol
---
Lol if $1.50 is a lot to you maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be spending money on this game anyways and focus on your financial stability... just saying
---
Yes. Let the salt flow through you.
---
I died to cerb 5 times today due to this lag after 200 kc without a death, feels bad man
---
I can easily tank 4 full barrages in multi with 10+ people on me. I am a fuckin beast mobile pker. The only disadvantage is right clicking taking that whole second. I do pk flawlessly on pc, its just when im at work that i use mobile.
---
I like the graphics and visuals of RS3 but I hate the gameplay. I really wish HD OSRS would happen already. I understand not using the visuals from RS3 but the visuals from RS2 when it had the HD patch would be amazing.
---
Fuck
---
Well ya how else am I Gonna get these tinder matches??
---
Trying this method, worked a couple days ago, but not right now but. I'm pretty much exclusively a mobile player at this point and this sucks quite a bit.
---
Sounds like someone doesn't know about Lizard Squad.
---
Nice 9 seconds logged in, your account is mine
---
Because Mod Gee is apparently the only girl to ever play runescape in the history of Gielinor.
---
Whoah whoah wait, I think we should try the server on/off button before jumping to conclusions. You know...big...red...flashy button.
---
I've been playing all weekend too. Grats on quest
---
If this is your biggest fear please teach me your ways of life
---
Happy cake day
---
Nah it's more like I can't bring a laptop to work. I work with fiber optics on the daily so I'm real hands on and don't have time to slack off and play RS. But I enjoy mobile on my downtime :)
---
I do have time in the evenings to play if I'm home, but I'm usually spending time with the lady among other things.
---
I couldnt find world 404
---
Okay, great, if LS is DDOSing Jagex, then the problem is known and they can more easily work to fix it. It doesn't negate the fact that Jagex is working on the problems. 
---
OP makes it sound like they're just sitting on their ass.
---
Ubuntu is icky
---
This melodrama is reaching Gaia Online levels
---
That'll do it!
---
I mean, I saw one for $200 a year for 5 people. Not bad considering you could split and have group Ironman early. Also, the custom models I've seen from private servers really limits OSRS to the imagination. This is all an idea mind you. Just really becomes doable if the original game becomes like it has been recently.
---
"jagex pays their employees peanuts wtf"
---
"Why aren't the jmods working overtime on the weekends to reply to every single complaint thread!"
---
100% to agility
---
What the fuck is going on with servers atm?? Is this a quick fix on dupe that's slowly down servers?
---
0.1 second of 100xp what u doing
---
Roll tide!
---
Gallow
---
To hang yourself with when you realize the lag will never go away
---
you're on 1tic = 3 sec... but so is everyone. it's win/win situation.... or a lose/lose I should say. They panic twice as much while you struggle twice as much haha
---
The number of people who killed zuk
---
lol
---
I can't even log on. üòî
---
It would be immune to poison only, not venom.
---
Twisted league always works for me, then simply change worlds once the app loads
---
In the not gay way
---
yeah that was what i was thinking as well.
---
Slow motion pking!!!! Like the matrix bullet dodging but ags swipe dodging hahahhaa. But for real im australian so add another 400ms to that shit hahaha feels like everyone has been brought down to the level ive trained my whole carrier for!!
---
Laggy aussies rise up yah cunts!! Our time is now!!! The wild is ours!!!!!!
---
No. I like matrix man mode, Dodge a fat dbow stack with my slowmotion.
---
your boots, bootlicker

Only 90s kids will get this reference, well 90s kids that know who KDB is, amd anyone else that know who KDB is.

Looks  normal  to me

Runescape good
---
You probably are,2b isnt that much
---
That makes a lot of sense actually, my perspective is skewed.
---
Noted beginners wand
---
Didn't work for me :)  
---
Maybe another world would work though; I hear a world that worked yesterday may not work the next day but another world will. I'm not trying to log in right now anyways just wanted to try it.
---
Wasnt toxic as hell after winning. Nice.
---
69. Getting all the reqs for song. Had my qp a year ago, quit, now I gotta do it again :(

Did an inventory of mythic capes on my ironmeme before I raged myself to the woodcutting guild
---
Wonder if/when they will reimburse the player base. Wait... this is JamFlex we‚Äôre talking about.
---
well, at least wc is the most afk of all skills.  it's literally Netflix: The Skill.
---
Progressive taxes on income usually adopt that model, where the next tax bracket only taxes at the higher percentage for any money made within that bracket. The purpose for this is because if you make just below the next tax bracket, it actually hurts you to make more money. If someone was making 49k at 10% tax, they lose 4.9k to taxes. But if making 50k puts you in a 20% bracket, then making 1000 dollars more would actually cost you 5.1k more. The progressive tax that only applies to its own tax brackets income is meant to combat this problem so people are not discourage from working/making more money. We don't need this function at the duel arena because its not the livelihood of people on the line, its gambling. Fuck 'em, they can pay the tax.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EDIT: A progressive tax is defined as any tax that increases over a set value, so the higher the income the higher the tax. the part where it only taxes income made in that bracket is not a necessary part of the progressive tax definition, but is damn well necessary for real world implementation.
---
I've heard mix feelings about the switch is it worth it? I got a 3ds and was totally disappointed by it ?
---
Thank you never seen that before like putting fire out with wheat hahahaha
---
lvl 3 ironman its a fake
---
Gonna be like Rock Lee without the weights when the servers go back to normal.
---
Imagine me talking to you and you gotta reply to me.
---
We are having a regular conversation... It's going fine...
---
Now imagine if a stadium of people were trying to have. A conversion with you at the same time... You gotta talk to them all.
---
Basically ddos is overloading the server with requests until it can't reply to anyone properly and it also can't figure out what's legitimate or spam.
---
Dupe?
---
Oh yeah definitely. If you buy bonds with in-game gp, you support MTX. 
---
Based on my own actions, I support MTX lol
---
I don‚Äôt blame him. Last time I was there I couldn‚Äôt find anyone to do a whip stake with me. Place has really gone downhill.
---
Consistently raid at moderate efficiency.
---
It isn't rocket science.
---
I thought lvl13 Fire cape was like two weeks ago? I can‚Äôt keep track anymore
---
I just wanna grind TL while in the restroom :/
---
Mobile doesn't work and every server is laggy. Been like this for a week. How hard is it to fix
---
Why would you not just wait until servers aren't floating from bad to unplayable to resub? It seems like a reasonable decision to not pay for a sub you can barely use right now.
---
Before it says it‚Äôs unavailable you see it tell you click here if it isn‚Äôt loading try clicking that.
---
Love how that‚Äôs all you have. Try reading a book before you embarrass yourself with the dumbest ‚Äòexplanations‚Äô ever written. Ahahahahaha
---
Upvoted for Futurama, now that show is delivery!
---
To put it bluntly, this game is a massive grind. Hugely. 
---
Unlocking teleports will massively improve how you see the world. When you're starting fresh, there is a ton of walking and the run energy depletes fast. The agility skill, unlocked as a member, can help mitigate this by helping your energy run out slower and, as you progress in the skill, you can eventually unlock an armor set called Graceful. While standing still, your energy will resupply much quicker. 
---
I applaud you for attempting to do the quests without guides. I wish I could go back and play the game for the first time again. It is a really awesome experience. 
---
Upgrading to members will unlock a MASSIVE amount of content. The Runescape world is huge and there are thousands of things to do. A lot of the "fun" things are towards the endgame PVM content. There is a lot of skill grinding needed to get to this point. 
---
Runescape is what you make it. After Tutorial Island, you're dumped into lumbridge without any guidance. You're free to do anything you want. 
---
Some people love skilling. Some love PVM. Some love PKing. You just have to find what it is that you like doing.
---
Search interface or ui
---
Shut the fuck up you retard. Do something else? Im a pker. All I do is pk. I will never in my life stoop to the level of mindlessly killing a computer program NPC or even worse, repetitively skilling on this stupid fucking ancient medieval virtual pixelated video game.
---
Edit: it‚Äôs green text that says ‚Äúnot loading?‚Äù Press that that and try
---
Suggest me a book right now. The fact you can't even punctuate your own sentences gives me very little incentive to believe you.
---
I didn't play much 3ds myself. A few games were good but the switch is a million times better
---
No. 
---
I don't give a shit that terms say. Way to speak lawyer for Jagex. 
---
I'm not comparing mmo services to buying pies. The whole point of my previous reply to dictate the difference between the two... 
---
Also, I'm not saying legally they have to give it to me. Morally they should, but the company is too greedy. 
---
You sound like a 12 year old BTW.
---
For those of us new to OSRS, can I get a summary of the months?

Gotcha lmao makes sense, arc light too good

Yeah same Lolol

tried it and it isn't working
---
Nooo heck no. Too many bots and not enough rocks without lower floor access
---
Just go to mining guild in Falador and go power mine the 3 iron rocks right by the bank chest :)
---
Durial did not ban himself
---
I‚Äôve been there for work about 4 months out of every year for the past 6 years. After your first visit it‚Äôs just a regular town. Unless you‚Äôre a gambling addict. Or a hooker addict. Or a coke addict.
---
Not the person you replied to but it will take you a long long time to make 6m on a beginner account with no experience. You'd be best off buying a membership.
---
My phone's screen automatically turned off before the home tele finished.
---
Approved.
---
On task, I'd hate to do these off task!  
---
I have no idea where to use the helm...
---
Just to note, leveling agility only allows for faster energy regeneration. It has no effect on how quickly energy depletes, that is dependent on character weight.
---
Wasting exp
---
Just delete the lag 4Head
---
The lag issues probably aren't helping.  Tons of ticks dropped
---
Here‚Äôs the thing man, as much as I‚Äôm annoyed with the servers lagging, I know damn well Jagex won‚Äôt return even a single minute of membership. Nothing will be said and nothing will be reinstated. Complaining will fall on deaf ears and MAYBE we‚Äôll get a response to the lag, but that‚Äôll more than likely be a very redacted explanation as to why the lag happened in the first place. The jmods on stream and/or twitter will be used as the punching bags like always while the higher ups won‚Äôt have to deal with even a bit of the fallout; some jmods might leave the company again, only making the game more difficult to sustain. 
---
We all love this game, man, but no matter how mad we get, we also gotta see the whole picture. I‚Äôd love for Jagex to return a few days of membership, but I HIGHLY doubt that‚Äôd ever happen. Cheers, boys. Hopefully this‚Äôll be resolved soon so we‚Äôll stop wasting exp.
---
Not as bad as UIM*
---
No gays allowed
---
Actually the reverse. Battlestaves should rise with more bots as bots drive down the air orb prices and because of that, drive up staves, due to the curling of high alch price of 9300 and battlestave floor  of 7k
---
Same. Maybe as a minigame instead of a skill thou
---
Gratz
---
Yup this worked for me. Picked an Australian server from the website and suddenly it worked. No idea why though. Quite amazing what 11$ / month gets you.
---
I was wondering if this was just me. The lag is for real right now.
---
I'm sorry, but noone is addressing it because it's a known problem. Addressing it like OP did now just makes way for more toxic and trolling answers, so most people tend not to. Don't fall into the trap of trying to fix toxicity as it will just generate more.
---
Pretty likely that it's not, given the first year+ of osrs's release was spent solely fixing "spaghetti code" and likely moving everything back onto an actual readable and usable coding language.
---
There are a bunch of F2P(Free to Play) to Bond type videos but it is a lot of work, especially if you are brand new to the game.
---
If it were me, I'd just buy membership. It's $11 a month but it unlocks pretty much the whole game. There is some good F2P content but the game becomes much more fun as a member. 
---
I'd go ahead and buy membership for 30 days to get a real feel for the game and see if you want to continue. 
---
And, honestly, watch some videos. I know you want to get into Runescape lore (Which is awesome!) but to really see what the game is about, I'd watch some videos. 
---
Theoatrix, on Youtube, has really awesome videos about every skill in the game and some really great content. [Here is one of his guides for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adS-f5ABTJI)
---
Ah, did not know that!
---
It wasnt just mobile, the game in general has been supper laggy.
---
Riot in slow motion
---
You king
---
666th like, feels fitting
---
You gotta do something worth whole sometime. Go for a beer or relax somewhere scenic.
---
Great answer, just a little FYI: a higher agility level restores your run faster, the only thing affecting how fast your run energy depletes is your weight ;)
---
Meaning osrs outlasted the rise and fall of what we now know as rs3 it died when eoc came into play after the downward spiral of the wilderness and pking being shoved into a bounty hunter arena inside wilderness where you‚Äôd be match with people way better then you and get beef stew right to your face! But that‚Äôs good long live osrs! I wish they‚Äôd bring summoning and dungeoneering back as skills...fun times lol
---
I tried it yesterday. First time it worked. Second time I had to try about 5 worlds. Now it doesn't work at all
---
Probably there for work jackass
---
I guess you have a point. However, I just wanted to propose solutions. Not to force and say that someone must behave that way.
---
Also, for me it seems like osrs is running without any lags atm.
---
For some reason I was really hoping you would be upside down when you arrived. Bummer.
---
This is the way
---
three months with no drama, gotta give the mods some love for that, i expect them to mess up every month as its human to do so
---
Even in a stateful architecture, it isn't all that hard to have replication and failover in a lot of cases.
---
I'm upset we didn't have a follow up for at 7:01pm est
---
I‚Äôve been using it at bandos Lolol but I feel your pain bc all I do is slayer so I use slayer helm usually lmao but she‚Äôs my little precioussssss
---
Still cant get on, not been able to get online on osrs for 2 days now, what a joke, sort it out jagex.
---
If you can afford the 11$ a month I would highly recommend bying it since it literally unlocks the rest 95% of the content
---
Defend them? Games have server issues. It's not outright stopping the game from being played. I've played all weekend and today. Yes to play on mobile I sometimes have to go to the website and try a few worlds. But I know they're working on that.
---
You seriously haven't experienced actual hardship if you think this is being hard done by.
---
\&gt; Maybe a flaky assumption is good enough for you but it's not for the rest of us. 
---
Unless you're a networking expert and can explain how you're so positive that you're correct I'm not convinced.  Starting to think the other guy was right and you don't know how to read, seems like you're just repeating the same shit without responding to actual points.
---
No your right, take the Boeing 737 Max for instance, that‚Äôs been grounded now for..... 9 months I think and still grounded.
---
Yeah and i have a basic it diploma but i dont expect jagex to make any statements with IT terms or even anolgies for the normie player base.. which, let me remind you is the majority of people and they chant "rc bad swamp man good." 
---
Edit: i like your edit uwu want to meet me at the grandtree before midnight for a cute time?
---
i just did than :/ so serves lag is due to this problem ?
---
Pretty much.
---
What statement
---
They made a statement about mobile, did they make one about server lag?
---
Because networking and server connection issues are extremely complex and believe it or not people have lives and don't want to work on a weekend. So they would have had a smaller staff size than usual working on it.
---
Also.. been playing all weekend, even on mobile when necessary. Only had to do the workaround twice so far and it worked within 5 world's. Only slight bits of lag experienced,nothing out of the ordinary.
---
Have you tried other servers??
---
The common theory is people trying to duplicate gold by stressing the servers.
---
damn :( ty
---
Please edit text over you each time your character freezes. "It was at this moment I knew, I had fucked up."
---
chill dude it was a joke you should try some crack cocaine
---
Finally kicking out my meth addiction as well
---
I'm not indulging you anymore. You're clearly arguing for the sake of arguing, and not one of your *points* is valid.
---
Lot complaining about it yeah, and its impossible for mobile users to connect right now since there's a server connection bug
---
Ehh they complain about jagex, i complain about them. We all just going through withdrawal from the best drug on earth.. scape.
---
I‚Äôm happy to report that I found a transcript of this interview. https://rhinospike.com/script_requests/whatthefatis/1737/
---
Explain Jan-July please.
---
That's crazy you almost think there'd be more content going around about it or at the very least in game riots. Have people tried any tricks to connect on mobile like choosing a world through the official website?
---
Game laggs - lets make it lagg even more as a protest. 
---
Some peoples IQ surprises me.
---
have sex with op
---
I'm sure there a prostitute training rc on his alt if you turn the camera around
---
Do it. It's going to help you more than you think
---
The Fire Nation killed my mother
---
Probably one of my favourite meme accounts in recent times
---
Managed to dupe my ping
---
i don‚Äôt get how a man smiling equates to jmods? smh
---
Oh shit dude I thought it was wierd that my wcing xp/hr dropped from 55k to just above 50k but that makes sense
---
Given how long the problems been on-going, I'd say it's safe to say that there's something wrong with their ISP. And trust me, people over at jagex are also pissed shit isn't working lol.
---
Oh, and they probably pay a lot more than $11 a month to their isp :)
---
Wow gz he made bank in a game by gambling, great achievement /s
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a while, can anyone explain please?
---
Leagues has played fine for me but the main game has been a mess.
---
I feel like this would just cause some website to create their own ebay-like system where buyers and sellers could find each other, which would be used for bulk purchases or expensive items. It wouldn't do anything to restore the open air markets that we once had in Falador garden/outside Varrock west bank, it would just lead to the creation of an unofficial, less convenient GE on some website.
---
They shadownerfed home tele
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it!
---
To me the only games that compare are Bethesda games. Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim...
---
Nightmare beta worked for me!
---
Except it does for everyone with more than 5 seconds of patience. It might take a few worlds but it worked fine for me even being limited to just leagues world's to try. Once it's loaded you can swap to any world no issue
---
Well known workaround.
---
Where do you get these statistics
---
Works for a short while but I still get disconnected and have to keep reloging in
---
Gee, you think?
---
Diango Unchained
---
This is me, except just the first part while I play TL with zero issues.
---
Thank u man, worked but had to kill the app so it totally relaunches.
---
Has worked both times I've needed it. Took about 5 or 6 world's each time.
---
Its clearly a ploy to get more people to play leagues. The more time you spend in leagues the longer it will take you to complete your goals in the main game, the more $11‚Äôs you‚Äôll have to spend haha.
---
for years I thought this is just how the game worked
---
when my family switched from dial up I was so fucking confused
---
Lag is literally affecting certain server nodes like it has before. Been playing on the Aus server nodes with zero issues all weekend.
---

That was October 2017, stop using internet explorer
---
Thanks. It's pinned in this sub dude.
---
This isnt Team Fortress 2, this is Run escape!
---
Seems chill once you get off the strip it‚Äôs just like every other city.
---
Really. Thanks for the 20646533th post about this.  Even in Reddit style.
---
He wasnt popular enough. Its harsh i know, but we live in a society. I didnt even know he existed before this.
---
I have a solution for this:
---
On mobile, open your browser and load up osrs website.
---
Under the play free and members options, choose manually select world.
---
Select the world you want and a pop up will occur asking you to open the app. 
---
This works on both iOS and Android.
---
They give stuff out after they fix the issue though, I know most games do this but people still have a way to access the game besides through mobile. If Jagex does comp out something to players (I'm not saying they shouldn't, I would like it if they do.) it's not going to be announced until after they resolve the issue. What if they announce tomorrow that they are going to give everyone 4 days of membership to add to the ones lost by the issues but they aren't resolved yet? Well then that's just wasting those days away. Every post complaining about comping membership or anything like the people are acting like they are holding a magical wand every time they press submit on their post, that their post is the one that's going to finally fix the issues at hand. We unfortunately have to wait for them to let us know what their plan is once it's been resolved and then that's when people can riot if Jagex doesn't give them something to make up for it. They've already comunicated that they are working on the issue and try to come up with a temp fix while they work getting the real issue done. 
---
This isn't going to be something like Dan Harmon (co-creater of Rick and Morty) just responding back to a guy who asked for a new season saying fine go turn on your T.V there it is.
---
(I know the Dan Harmon thing to some people who read that last part know it was part of an April Fools prank but that's one Analogy I can find for people know about it.)
---
Yes on world 302 lag lag lag. On the world I‚Äôm on right now (529) works beautifully.
---
&gt;I pay $10/$20 a month to Digital Ocean/AWS for use of their servers. Then I expect to be able to use what I paid for. When they have outages/issues with those servers I‚Äôm always notified and compensated appropriately
---
Free market. You can switch providers so they have incentive to provide support.
---
I read a comment somewhere saying that apparently theyre getting ddos? Is that true or is it just server down time?

Wow a runescape meme not involving the lag and connection issue. Good for you!
---
Works on Huawei.
---
If you want to play the mobile version, it is 100% unusable. Lag is one thing, being literally unable to connect to a game you are paying monthly for is pretty dumb and should be refunded.
---
Mine never arrived
---
I doubt jagex is that retarded that they would leave the dupe glitch around... I know they are retarded, just not that retarded.
---
But why is this happening

New to meme making, my bad lmao.

Really trying hard to flex your intellect on the young and inexperienced given ya that good ole' morality boost eh. If you're right and I am a kid it'd be like a 26 year old condescending a 15 year old lmfao.

For sure. If we don‚Äôt meet SLAs and get servers back up or parts to site on time then we are financially penalised.  One customer of ours had, IIRC, a complete UK outage so we ended up having guys in on the weekend round the clock for 72 hours and some sent off to site in Liverpool. 
---
We often have to also deal with our customers migrating data centres and end up with all sorts of issues due to that.

Jagex hit me up, we do 24/7/365 monitoring, so we can keep the autists at bay.

I wonder when they'll finally release a south america server and not just a US server with a south america country flag
---
So is a potential cause of all this lag people abusing the server crash mechanics using a new method, or is this just conveniently a separate issue?
---
Or is it potentially an issue with the dynamic server reallocation that they wrote to fix the server crashes?
---
I also want to play things when I don't have access to them. When I switched operating systems I was slightly upset I won't be able to play a lot of them, then I thought about the 7-8 games I bought on a steam sale and haven't touched for 3+ years, and said I was going to play.
---
Is that elyse?
---
Yeah sure with these servers!
---
can you retract membership? I had monthly and it renewed saturday but I'm bored of playing, got 31 days left which seems like just a useless month. I already unsubscribed
---
Not everyone would. People wouldn‚Äôt move to sketchy websites, not even close to the majority would. It‚Äôs not an illegal group of people, it‚Äôs currently allowed to stake, people wouldn‚Äôt default to rule breaking because they‚Äôre unable to stake.

Where are you getting that information from? All the friends I have who have RWT'd before and openly admit to either buying or selling gold on discord haven't done it at the arena, I'm inclined to think most people don't.  And even if they did, they would just move somewhere else to RWT if trading was a concern.  Like killing someone in the very edge of the wild on some obscure world.

The 2500 brews was confirmed to be a bug. It was a test drop that the dev forgot to remove before launch. It was more so that streamers and Twitterers complained about the table (without ever even doing the content) and then everyone repeated their complaints like sheep.

I mean if you know it‚Äôs bad, why are you still raiding?

And they have acknowledged there is issues, mobile issues are the same fucking servers. 
---
God I swear some people are dense.
---
Is OSRS also suffering connection issues on PC? I can't seem to get anything to load.
---
It's a company that provides servers for 70k + people and take their money. sure let's ghost them for 2 days while providing no info and trash servers. Even at real jobs you get called on your off days to fix something urgent if it's a problem it's reality
---
Love it, you give a tech answer people have been complaining for and your response is people asking what it all means!
---
I'm in a different boat. My exams end tomorrow and I really want to resub to OSRS after exams but if the servers are complete dog shit I'll have to wait.
---
There were discussions about how bots work when you see them as a user with interfaces and how bot farms work by building a direct connection to the game without any graphical ui to maximise the amount of bots pet system. So if you set up a script to do a certain task like go clan wars and start hitting anyone there and duplicate it for 2k accounts. Ran all on one machine.

I dislike quests because the dialogue is always terrible. Your character is either a sadist or a complete moron, sometimes both. The humor is mostly meta lolrandom humor, which is cute for the first few low level quests but it gets a little grating by the time you have barrows armor. The dialogue you have with the various Pets in the game are in that same vein; my character is a sadistic idiot and just verbally abuses them. It's not even witty banter, it's just "haha you're literally a worthless slave now I hope you feel bad" like what? how is that funny? that's more sad than anything
---
You can pick up your gracefull under like lvl 20 or 30 though lol
---
I use it when charging air orbs and i can could pick it back up when i died
---
Yeah, that's not funny at all. Idk what else I expected lol.

In your case, I would choose Wisdom. You enjoy skilling, not great at PvM.

It seems most the people that play this game don't work. My basic living expenses is around ¬£35 a day. Osrs membership is ¬£6.99.
---
I don't know if you've ever run a game server on your own hardware before, but I have. I've run into issues that have taken the better part of a week to figure out. Granted I'm only one person and not a professional, but my servers also aren't running on 20 year old spaghetti code. Besides that, like I said, it's entirely possible that the issue that's happening with the servers are attacks. The servers aren't down, they are just slow. It's a distinction that matters.

I use Runelite and heard people get banned from that. I also talked to someone last night on OSRS discord who said he got banned from using it.
---
cencored
---
Except Jagex said in reply to his video post on the thread that they had spoken to him for weeks before and thanked him for bringing it to their attention.
---
They told him they were aware and monitoring the people using the glitch.
---
why are you here then
---
I tried using a twisted league and then changing it and it works every time for me.
---
Good man! Now stop talking and grind grind grind! o7
---
Wrong. Say I order something from a restaurant and it shows up and they forgot something, like a side or dipping sauce. I will not call and demand they bring it to me. It‚Äôs to much work to be upset about it. There is a time and place to demand your money back, but this is not it.
---
I think you just sold me on Wisdom lol, maybe next leagues I'll go for a pure PVM build (if it's appropriate for the restrictions) and have a play then, but I think I may just go for max this time and play with pvm after that.
---
Thanks a lot :D
---
Can't even get RL to launch today. Guess I'll just take a break then.
---
Yeah I heard if you're hardcore this works 100% of the time too

Legit worked for me aha

I also put can't afford in hopes I'll see that cheap membership again one day

We should sticky this

&gt;I'm new to the game so give me a life saving tip too!

Quit before you get addicted.

I took some time off playing this year, did we really have 3 separate months with no drama??
---
So what the hissy fit continues you cancel your sub a week goes by Jagex finds the cause of the problem fixed it and you resub? You should probably find a better paying job if you‚Äôre going to complain about losing $2.7 a day

You are the enemy of the people

Imagine owning a mac book. lol

It's not, I just checked

Seriously how do people still take this fucking company seriously? Compared to other games out there currently they charge an exorbitant fee for a $20 year old game because they keep it updated, and they can‚Äôt even do the basic shit correctly.
---
Kids have gotta eat somehow
---
If anything, Rendi might have thought that they were giving a generic answer and then self-righteously made the video.
---
Ammune? Fucking hell.
---
Even the workaround is not working
---
I don't think that's really how that works. Sure it uses integrated graphics, so the GPU is built into the same chip as the cpu, but it's much more efficient at processing a graphical workload and therefore should produce less heat.
---
We're soooorry
---
You don't need the elite task just hard, and the req are fairly easy
---
Damnit...... Can't hack account because zammy pages are blacked out.
---
Or better yet, spend my money on something that actually works.
---
After today you won‚Äôt be able to claim the membership, also, once you link your account the membership will be applied. Might wanna go ahead and do it, 7 days is better than no days.
---
not really in TL. you hade 30% increased damage and accuracy + you have the attack speed tick reduction
---
So whats your plan after running out of items?
---
The wiki is a great place to start learning about the game 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/
---
Yeah I play videogames all the time in vacation. You're going to have downtime. I don't want to get back from vacation and feel like I had no time to relax.
---
Alright, keep throwing your hissy fit, no doubt I‚Äôll see you re subbed and playing the game as if nothing happened in a month.
---
Yeah, I had a couple days on my bond. Forfeited that.
---
This is getting ridiculous. At least the work around worked up until this morning.
---
Go to Oldschool's website on mobile and manually select a UK World, it will redirect you to the app and load. I've had to do this for the past 3 days.
---
I have run my own game server, I ran multiple types of game servers, ran my own MMO before, ran a few MC servers, and a few other games. And I run servers for businesses on a daily basis. It very well could be a DDoS attempt slowing it down, or it could be hardware/software issues. We really dont know, but this much downtime/performance degradation is still unacceptable. Some of their servers are down for mobile. I'm a full stack software dev, and have been doing this for years. It very well could be a DDoS attempt slowing it down, So please, next time try not making yourself sound like an asshat. Kthxbye
---
2 &gt; 1 &gt; 4 &gt; 3 as far as seasons go. It isn't as abysmal as 3, but it's not up to season 1 and 2. 
---
But don't worry! They've already blindly renewed it for 70 episodes!
---
Not sure why people don't seem to realize that for a lot of players the workaround simply isn't working.
---
They dont have near the team size they used to. All of the files were lost so they would start from scratch. As much as I want it I dount it will ever happen. They'll never invest that much in this game again.
---
it only costs less than 40 cents a day to play if you spread the 11$ between 31 days. Not a huge waste honestly.
---
To be fair you need a pretty high IQ to be addicted to a shitty 2007 browser game with exponential xp curves
---
11‚Ç¨ is 6‚Ç¨ more than I used to pay and customer service has gone to worse.

Keep in mind that if you kill the beast, you gotta offer 100 babydragonbones (or better) before the altar returns to normal/gives exp again.

IIRC, having Runescape 2 continued was a possibility but wasn‚Äôt popular enough. I am sad about that.
---
Soon it'll be running in smooth 60 spf
---
I think to a degree you're not wrong, but I've staked for probably 2-3 years now, been to Las Vegas a few times in same timeframe and never touched a casino. 
---
For me at least it's easy to separate IRL and in-game, and my staking buddy and I rather enjoy the come-up, the clean, the rebuild, and repeat cycle of this game.
---
its actually the exact opposite. they are speedily updating the servers (hence the intense lag) instead of doing it incrementally over months and months JUST to ensure that duping like this doesn't happen again because it came soooo clooose to ending runescape as we know it. so complain all you want but it's just how servers work while undergoing maintenance. anybody who played computer games in the early 2000s knows the struggle of laggy servers during updates - just get over it for a few days.
---
Mobile servers aren‚Äôt loading and there are lots of mobile only players
---
Rip ed truck
---
ah shut up you drama queen
---
Oh you know
---
Or it‚Äôs a joke
---
And I'm saying you're a fool for being so heavily invested in something that's temporary and going to be completely obliterated eventually anyway
---
It will once the government notices its a form of gambling.
---
no i think its the same hear me out. last year every month had drama... this year 3 months no drama.. but its as if... the 3 months in which there was SUPPOSED to be drama.. increased the drama of the other 9 months and mate it extra dramaful for anything to happen. hence it hasn't improved or became worse. the only thing that paid the price is our pockets :(
---
Justice for all.

We pay, we play.

Jesus you are you guys trying to kill me? Not even sure there's enough hours in the day, but i'll give it a damn good shot.
---
Close out of the app completely, try switching to the beta worlds and reloading. Once the app loads you can switch worlds.
---
Twisted League doesn't matter, it all eventually gets reset a an arbitrary date of Jagex's choosing anyway
---
Oh look another dumb comment by you who didn‚Äôt read any terms and conditions still.
---
And why in the world would anyone want to do that?
---
The items you're choosing are really increasing in effort required to draw huh
---
Yeah true, probably people trying to dupe still.
---
Tf is that bank.
---
&gt;Sure, if you're not a real game company and just some indie devs in a basement that's an ok response.
---
Sadly this is actually what I've come to expect with big game companies. I actually think Jagex is one of the better ones at being open with their community. Blizzard or Riot wouldn't give a fuck.
---
If there was to be any reimbursement, I'm sure it would have to be non tradable and cosmetic only, like a wifi banner that only has 1 bar, or a black Cape with the outline of a white 'x' on it
---
If your looking for other moble games, just kill me 3 is pretty fun, it's not an mmo or anything like that, but it's still fun
---
I'm an old man I can't keep up with you young kids and your cassettes and your 8 track record players.

Lol these people are all mad they didn‚Äôt read the terms and conditions that they agreed to, it‚Äôs pathetic.

That‚Äôs just a base requirement to join the clan.

---
Be aware if you have the Dark Altar relic; you can't source dragon bones from normal npc drops to uncurse the altar. It is not uncursed when you kill the beast.
---
Also from the fact they were hypocritical towards their stance of where birds nests/saradomin brews should come from. They state they want a bigger income of birds nests to come from skilling methods, and then decide to nerf bird house products and finally add a noted 2500 saradomin brew (4) to konar drop table.
---
Soo might be a dumb question, but how do you see the connection speed of each server? In the server browser I can only see the location and the number of people on the server. Using runelite

Why the fuck do people defend paying $100+ a year for a game released nearly 20 years ago? This game is one of the most expensive games to play while also being one of the simplest games to exist. There‚Äôs no excuse for all the head ass shit jagex does. You‚Äôve had 20 years with managing your easy servers. Other games have showed that it‚Äôs not that hard at all to upkeep
---
PSA: Not every world lags like this. instead of jumping on the whiny lil bitch wagon like everyone else, just find a world that performs decently - IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
---
Thank you all for the support! I'll let you know if anything changes in the next week or so.
---
* So its its a small fee then it becomes irrelevant that we paid for a service we cannot access. Straw mans arguments bud. Compensation should be given to all members.

The Gauntlet is by no means as intricate as dungeoneering, but it‚Äôs similar. It‚Äôs pretty difficult too which, imo, makes it a lot of fun.

Really, as an American, was that shit really necessary?

I actually agree with you, they should be held accountable for their shitty business practices. Generalizing Americans as licking corporate underwear was just being a racist asshole for no reason. The fact that you're even being upvoted shows how much of an echo chamber this subreddit is for Europeans.
---
Jagex had to implement the best temporary fix they possibly could regardless of the bug being kept private or public. I don‚Äôt completely agree we would be in a much different state if Rendi never made his video.

It's all good my man! Glad you're able to log on still though! Hopefully, they get it fixed properly soon!
---
i can't wait for day 5
---
Dont need to be 2200. You just load the client that way, not login
---
I know mine was also a joke..
---
Downvoted every comment. Youre welcome
---
Based on your experience with what? Warcraft servers were down for 5 days around launch of classic. No reimbursement. Queue times to get into the game to play were so long that 40% of the community didn't play for nearly a week after launch. Didn't reimburse membership. People are pulling this shit out of an imaginary hat mad of entitlement. Get over yourself. If your that upset stop playing the game.
---
I likey i likey vwry good upvot3
---
clickBAIT
---
That‚Äôs an easy way to get scammed
---
did you or your brother bot on another acc from that pc?
---
Brilliant... I didn‚Äôt think the stick could be topped
---
That community only exists because of pet and boosting, not any merit of the minigame itself...
---
Probably Everytime the weekend comes and they're at home.
---
Ah, I see the method didnt go well then
---
People bot those all the time.
---
grats! got mine at 55 :)
---
Classic Jagex. Has to be one of the worst managed companies in history.
---
Cool idea
---
I meant that now people will flock to try to load the client on 2200 worlds, and likely overload them, or direct the current connection issues towards those servers as well.
---
It seems like any world that gets mentioned as a workaround ends up also becoming intermittent.
---
Gotta actually work. Darn.
---
Looks like we killed it bois...
---
some have been and some aren't in my 21 pets. I'm dry on sire at 4500 kc, kq at 4000 kq, rock golem at 30m mining xp, got tangleroot at 50m xp. Got all other slayer pets double their rate and so on it goes. I just don't think we need pet grinds devalued to nothing like they are in rs3.
---
Ahhhhh, well the lowest populations is seeming to work
---
No such thing as downtime in Vegas. There is always something to do or fuck
---
I'm a bit confused, because I have been able to play TL without problems, just not on mobile?
---
And then you make a new account to do it again!
---
Did I just waste 51 seconds of my life watching a guy cast a 10 seconds spell? You're gosh derned right I did!
---
All twisted league worlds work for me atm through website redirect to the app. For those who have to take breaks in between: don't close the app once when you're breaking - leave it at the login screen. You can keep your phone locked for hours and it will let you log in again.
---
If you can't even grind out that little xp why bother playing RuneScape lol
---
Just do Ourania altar and you're done before you know it..
---
Or maybe it went perfectly. Free trip to lumby/fally lol
---
As I sit here shitting. I guess it‚Äôs time to get out of bed.
---
Im pretty sure theres not a jmod named mod bones, I just cheked on two moderator-wiki pages. There is nobody listed as "mod bones"
---
Warding was not a drama.  They polled something and it didn't pass.
---
Canceling membership if they don't give us some extra days
---
Hey person I don't know or trust, let me give you my money!
---
Also, that's UIM flair there pal. May wanna double check.
---
lol where do you people work
---
Muscle memory.  I‚Äôve did 1900 kills. I typically just get the 2nd or 3rd one depending on rotation  and watch videos after that.
---
Imagine being so god damn fucking bored with your life that you start hacking runescape thinking that your some bad ass rebel. Like who the fuck benefits from hacking runescape.
---
Yes I remember that one time. It ended up coming out though and exposed so.... idk I guess if that somehow happens again then good for OP BUT 99.9% of the time.... 
---
That OP had proof to believe otherwise, what‚Äôs OP got?
---
Jesus, this is the fucking reason I failed Jad Friday night. Here I was just thinking it was my internet, so I tethered my phone  and thought that it got a little better so I went to attempt the boss and then lagged like hell. Crazy thing is I took 4 hits before dying lmfao.
---
There is a work around where you have to choose a world from the osrs website then it will open the app from there
---
U rats at jagex are wasting our money. Hurry the fuck up and fix this shit
---
Okay, say I did (i didn't lets just say i did bot), these accounts have been maxed for years, why would anybody receive punishment for something like that like 2+ years later?
---
I mean, infinite money duplication glitch was a pretty big deal.  Bonds went up to 6M each, and it wasn't because of the popularity of Leagues...
---
jokes on them right?

More like 80% of the cost but with the huge con of having Windows OS. I don't mind paying 20% more to not have to use Windows, especially with the new 16" macbook pro I've been waiting for. Look at Razer or Asus, they charge as much for most upgrades, they solder a lot of components too, etc. Apple was just ahead of the curve because they went thinner first. Now everybody else does it so they must solder their components to be thin too. They have thermal issues too. But so far everything is quite perfect with the new macbook pro so I'm finally ready to upgrade.
---
&gt; I just don't think we need pet grinds devalued to nothing like they are in rs3.
---
You didn't even hear my proposal regarding the actual rate, lol? Would you consider the grind after an average of 10-20% easier pet chance after 99 "devalued to nothing".
---
Sure man, meet me in varrock West Bank in 10 minutes I'll invest a dhcb, pegasians and a dfw in you. Just pinky swear ull give it back, ye?
---
Fuck your self clayton
---
Our planet is temporary and will be completely obliterated eventually. True for you and I , also.
---
This is why I just buy a month at a time on Amazon. It's non-recurring.
---
Nice dude! I appreciate this and especially the arrows where to run to!
---
We've all been there. That AFK/lag life has claimed many a HC. Myself included.
---
Why not both?
---
This is a stupid idea. Unless you never subscribe again, they'll just get your money afterwards. Since the subscription is monthly, you accomplished nothing.
---
Only way you could make a point is if you were a consistent buyer of bonds with real life money, but stopped because of the current issue.
---
*listen to my salty struggles* 
---
*sarcastic congratulations*
---
I'ma be honest, I hadn't yet scrolled through the subreddit today before I made this thread.
---
Thank you so much, only world that works for me now for mobile world switch to initiate app.
---
My log shows 300+ from pre-release with just one item in post.
---
Think your standard case you get on amazon or at mall
---
Decent plastic, protects your phone enough 
---
Nothing like any of the more protective cases you can get but it‚Äôs fine from what I‚Äôve seen
---
Logging in is a good start man.
---
I've only trained rc through lamps and tears of gothic, etc lol, (60 rc) so I really havent ever done a legit method. I would prob just do lava runes i think those are the fastest for you atm and they are cheap - but ourania would work too. Its not much exp to 55 anywho.
---
Am I the only one not experiencing lag? My game has been running perfect.
---
*Chumlee proceeds to pay 650M for a dragon longsword*
---
&gt;Hello everybody, I was just wondering if using something like Runelite was b.a n n a b l e nowadays? 
---
Nope it's not, not with the default settings at least. There are some hardware oddities that might imitate some macroing features. I'm not familiar with the Ducky keyboard you mentioned but that does sound suspicious.
---
Or we can encourage them to be a better company and not continue to half ass everything. You must be another dude who will suck Jagex‚Äôs dick no matter what they do
---
Doesn‚Äôt the stickied thread explaining the mobile issues appear literally right below this one? At least it does on mobile Reddit.
---
I totally agree with this comment. I‚Äôll never forget the feeling I had when I got my first barrow gloves!
---
Yeah the league worlds arent terrible but there is more lag
---
What do they think will happen exactly if they're able to dupe massive amounts of money without getting caught? Theyll crash the fucking economy and gp will be worthless. It's like if the US just decided to print a bunch of money and give every person a billion dollars
---
I ain't cancelling and making my ppm raise lol
---
Im aware. No one is bothering to look at the threads posted before making hundreds of new ones. Kinda ridiculous the mods on this sub seem to never be around.
---
Totally useless at a 2200 total unless you're going for post-99 exp
---
4:22! The sote ball was funny. Me and my pal made it to xarpus but at sote I feel extremely blessed that I was able to tick eat the ball twice in this lag.
---
What abot 3k points?
---
I was leveling there a while ago when a  lower level attacked me, I wanted to finish the inventory, got level 98 orso and got a combat level so he couldn't attack me anymore, fun times
---
Got the clip if anyone cares to see, kinda funny
---
Honestly most people will tell you to quest first, because some given ridiculous amounts of experience, but I would advise having a wonder around. 
---
Few tips-
---
If you die anywhere, you have 1 hour to get back to where you died to retrieve your items. 
---
The wiki is fantastic, if you struggling with anything googling 'osrs cow hide etc' will more than likely find the answer.
---
OküòÇüòÇüòÇ

Was so optimistic to get some rc xp at ourania after half a year of not playing. Bought essense, stamina pots, found some show to watch.
---
Left after second trip to the altar
---
I hate you
---
Hackers: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll become rich by breaking the servers so no one wants to play the game I‚Äôm hacking to make money in. This... is... BIG BRAIN TIME‚Äù
---
Most gaming companies have this kind of slip ups. Blizzards banning the pro HK guy was worse than anything jagex has ever done. People constantly shit talk riot for how poor they balance the game
---
May I suggest "Noted Fishing Bait" for the poll?
---
never done it but losing 8 bones and starting in town seems like a decent outcome from being attacked
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not really like that. Explore, try everything (skills), and say goodbye to your social life. 
---
Do the easy quests too.
---
Oh whoops combat lv is 99 btw
---
Not giving them money is sucking their dick?
---
I've been able to get in via German worlds
---
osrs anti-botting is very lax and I doubt you actually got permed for no reason. Give it 3 days for the manual review and if you're still banned, stop botting.
---
I did this and tears to lvl 70 rc
---
It's just nonsense
---
Recently Runelite has taken a few minutes to get loaded up. Have you tried waiting longer?
---
Exactly this. People jump the gun for Karma with the drama calendar and then an even bigger fuck-up happens.
---
I'd like to see how well you perform at your job.
---
Try a different browser. It never worked on my android when using Firefox. Switch to chrome and worked first try.
---
Thanks rendi.
---
Worked for me last night but now it doesn't work anymore either, any update on the next workaround world to use? Plz
---
get 99 str at least and you can do some pking. ideally get 94 magic for venge/barrage also
---
Yup. Fucker helps create the dupe and tries to make a video on it ‚Äúexposing it‚Äù and ruins the game for a week. Hope it was worth it rendi. I used to watch your videos but now I just feel like he was trying to du p3 the game and got salty we was cut out of the scam
---
A ducky has an adjustable repeat rate, so if you hold down something like the letter C for one second, youll probably get something like "CCCCCCC" but with a ducky on max settings, it will be like "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC" after one second of holding it down. Adjustable repeat rates help in games like starcraft because you can hold down a key and build like 30 units nearly instantly with a high repeat rate, opposed to holding it down for a few seconds to achieve the same affect. that is the entire reason for the ducky that I have.
---
Jagex servers, their home page announcement says they‚Äôre dealing with server attacks
---
For real. They want their servers to run smoothly just as much as (if not more than) we do. If the servers are being systematically attacked, then it may take some time to stop them. Either way, a lot of people are being irrational about this, and I‚Äôm getting tired of reading all the posts.
---
I believe I get the error that tells me to check my firewall when I wait longer, but I wasn't 100% sure if it was runelite since it doesn't do anything to acknowledge that I've run it
---
hey man, you do commisions? I can pay you with exposure
---
He did now.
---
minimum you need 94 magic for barrage, 99 str is best, 99 range is best, def is good, att is good. at least for deep wildy pking. you will be at a significant disadvantage if your range and strength are not maxed
---
You can try logging on?
---
After a minute runelite loads file but the lag delay is still bad. Jagex announcements show they‚Äôre experiencing server attacks
---
Fucking read anything anywhere and youd know this.
---
Choose a skill and level up to85 and you can buy bond for the next month. And play whatever you like. No need any goal of target or way to play. All belongs to your interest
---
Well,I was already using chrome, and it did work 2 times before.. but I'll give it a try thnx
---
yeah. who cares it's all rng anyway.
---
 I, did the same man**
---
I tried every world and couldnt log...
---
somehow after seeing a post here saying to try 146 ...it worked 
---
Weird
---
Hour on the computer and hour watching tv is all I got
---
Hey now...
---
$11
---
what did you use your Ducky for, any macros/auto clicks ect
---
Can confirm. Anybody who tries to run&amp; tele has a way way higher chance of dying than people who plow through their bones and happily die. 
---
99 def is very hard to kill BUT you can sometimes start the fight with a 50 dbolt and get em.
---
Personally , I PK the prayer people to bait pkers
---
A hc friend of mine got the ma2 Cape today, huge balls
---
I stopped playing around early 2008, I found oldschool to be the perfect rollback since it was prime-time RS for me. Just because we vote in content doesn't mean we don't want this version, it's an mmo and needs updates and since it's the exact same universe as RS3 it will have similar content added since like you said people enjoyed the content at that time that you loved the most.
---
Dude IDC it's just sad to see you don't hear very often a company goes into shambles cause of ddos attacks they should make this game more hacker proof and they don't I don't get it
---
I can't even open runelite, vanilla client on my pc. Good riddance.
---
Is this cropped porn again?
---
Running Remote Desktop from my phone
---
96 prayer so far, 0 deaths. I bring good tank gear but the only way im gonna die is if a team comes, impossible to die in singles if u know what ur doing
---
Asks for citation, proceeds to not give citation for his own statement.
---
Ah reminders of the pre mobile, mobile days.
---
Lmao Jagex has mentioned multiple times they were incorrectly banned (although it is very rare). It requires an extremely uncommon occurence.
---
If you don't trust a company you're paying to play their game, you should probably quit
---
Thanks for the repost, funnier the 7th time for sure
---
No confirmation that it is definitely a DDoS based attack.
---
many of the skills are easily obtainable... if you were wealthy enough you could get 99 range from 1 range in just a day or two. I did crabs/nmz til ~80 range then chinned to 99 on every account besides my first one, and strength was just absorb nmz.. its quite easy to train an account on the side while your pking on your alt.
---
Drop it like the beat in a song? Another killer reference from you.
---
True that, that's why I originally downloaded the remote desktop app lol
---
Sure.

---
Lmao. It's a work in progress. It's normal to give a statement once things are under wraps. They have acknowledged that there are have been server issues. This sub is a toxic wasteland of crying entitled pussies
---
...you're aware of statue of limitations right? I mean I don't give a shit about this guy's accounts here but in the US most crimes are not chargeable after 5 years.. so not legal but, not punishable, yes.
---
Are you talking about the jed shit? Because he cleaned the banks of dozens of accounts while people like you cheered for him
---
We have wands, petition to add wings and floaty crowny things to the game.

Im having the same issues with the work around. I have tried every TL world and maybe another 50 others via the site but I still get the same connection issue screen when the app launches.
---
Osrsbeatz baroque is insane too

It‚Äôs not working for me anymore fffffs

Uhh guys? I think mobile might be broken

Mom says its my turn to use the good jagex servers

Work around no longer works for me either.

So 1.
---
There is no chance because I remember getting lvl 80 as a non-member. I was definitely lvl 80.
---
It‚Äôs clear that OP broke the rules. Been reading his comments.
---
Upvoting so I can get a laugh from the smack down
---
I like to believe he wasn‚Äôt talking about the lag.
---
"My career will be totally dead and all my friends will hate me, but I HAVE to make this video so I can fix the economy all by MYSELF".
---
This worked for me  previously, but it no longer is working. I've tried multiple servers from all regions and cleared my cache.
---
Uhh.. rote memorization? Same way people learn literally any type of information dude
---
They are both doing exactly that
---
Pets never should have been rng in the first place. They should have been a reward for reaching a milestone in dedication. It's nonsense that people act as if they're prestigious when someone can chop five logs and have the same pet you don't have after chopping 500000 logs.
---
Getting quest done is always a huge help maybe aim for finishing recipe for disaster.. Also train agility lol 70 or 75 would be best but anything is better than lvl 1, id suggest getting lvl 40 or so agility first off. Also doing slayer is a nice way to make gp once you get out of the early lvls.
---
Now draw Konar as an anti-fairy
---
Can you see what I‚Äôm doing right now or something?
---
Shouldn‚Äôt of AHK‚Äôd ;)
---
No, the entire Jed situation is one that spanned many months and spawned multiple posts by players saying that they got hacked when they shouldn't have been. As I said, use the search function. This is common knowledge to anyone that has been on this subreddit for more than a month.
---
Wow, without your post of a screenshot of your screen I wouldn't have possibly known! And neither would jagex!
---
No shit, people need time to recover to go do those things
---
It‚Äôs still working for me. Launched it again this morning
---
So rude I don‚Äôt do that at all. I just play for fun
---
Most people start listening to Christmas music/decorating/getting their Christmas tree etc around this time, even earlier. Just like people celebrate Halloween basically as soon as October rolls around. Just because you feel like it‚Äôs too early doesn‚Äôt mean it is
---
Cause I‚Äôm too busy sexing your sister
---
Work around doesn't work for any world for me anymore.
---
I think maybe the fact that you spent time making this did more to make you better at zulrah than the image itself did.
---
Wait what? NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
---
$0.36 a day.
---
$11/30days, not 30days/$11
---
never have and never will
---
How about 5k points?
---
No more zulrah for me
---
This is how most of my conversations go about this subject:
---
**THEM:** "You just want to make pets easier to obtain!"
---
**ME:** "It would only apply to people who are already 99 and have not obtained a pet on their way to 99.
---
**THEM:** "But it would devalue my pets!"
---
**ME:** "No, the hundreds of very lucky noobs who get their pets at level 31 do."
---
That's usually when I stop.
---
Remember all the dumb redditors being like "hurr durr it doesnt matter hes leaked it no one just has a botnet laying around to try to replicate it now"
---
When I had a desk job I played more rs than ever before. I got two 99s while on the job. Lol
---
No one would put themselves in a  bad hypothetical situation unless they did it. 
---
RIP your accounts you botting bitch
---
When he said Jagex was trying to get everyone to be quiet about it, I was like "wtf they obviously are trying to fix it, why are you telling EVERYONE?!"
---
The connection issues are messing with your brain
---
We're only the first week into december, only reason we haven't had more drama is because no one can play the game.
---
Wait is that real?? The subscription works for both??
---
People just want jagex to take accountability instead of hoping the problem goes away over the weekend.
---
Imagine being this much of a bootlicker for a company that payed out 96% of it's 2017 profits in dividends, instead of reinvesting a reasonable amount back into the company.

Oh I didn't even know that was a thing lol
---
That‚Äôs alright mobile, you go when you feel like it
---
Cry some more
---
Okay but why attack every single world instead of just a handful. The lag affected literally every world from USA-EU-AUS. It also took down mobile login? This either doesn't have to do with duping or the people  DDOSing don't have any idea what they're doing. No one has claimed responsibility for it either which is unusual when its just a malicious attack just to fuck with people.
---
Because you know him WAY more than I do, right? I haven't spoken to him in months because he was getting out of the military and had stopped playing osrs around the same time I did. This dude enjoys actually making his accounts(wtf?). The only reason he even plays the game is because he likes the grind of making accounts, and even though he's pretty shit at pking, that's what he makes the accounts for. 
---
I understand why you wouldn't believe him, or myself. I can't blame you for that because most people are dumb and think they can lie about this shit, believe me when I say this guy is the LAST person I would ever think to have cheated in any way.
---
yes

That's including HP xp.

96 str 94 attack, whip + torso + neitz + d defender + b gloves + d bootz. With whip on shared, it's 27k/h in atk/def/str/hp.

I just do normal rumbles with kendal/king roald/count draynor/trapped soul. 64 doses of overloads with the rest absorbs. 800 absorption lasts about 2-3 hours, so i just have to click an overload every 5-6 minutes, so I can play league/tft or revise without getting distracted :)

Come to my 99 party! Should be around fall 2020

No

---
True, but so maybe jagex should address the issue properly?  Like... no way jagex cant detect if theres 1500 players in one zone of the game and assume a few things.
---
"Going forward we'll ensure we're talking to you often and sharing updates on the issues as and when we're able to."
---
I feel like we've heard this before...many times.
---
People talking about not being about to use their paid subscription to play a game in a forum dedicated to discussing of that game?
---
That's illegal!
---
My sis is very fat.
---
Noice for you
---
I have never played Runescape and i have a banned account, dont even know how.  
---
And they dont even reply your tickets, if you get your accounts back, tell me how.
---
Oh no my og rs all my Nostalgia
---
They did reply looks like many times on multiple outlets just research a bit more. This is not a new issue and happens every so often so go look at old posts like this too to see their response
---
Yes because Jagex was doing absolutely nothing before he made that YouTube video.
---
Extremely troubling JMod behaviour, like Gambit wanting Ironman-only polls, or anything Husky tweets basically.  
---
Or Husky muting someone just because he did something Husky didn't like.
---
Thank you, I googled Verf to make sure I had the right guy but didn‚Äôt click on the videos to see if it was the same account. Grats to him either way, maxing a UIM is an incredible feat.
---
I understand your frustration but you're saying your account wasn't far enough to have money... Why didnt you just make a new account and move on? Its been a year.. Jagex doesn't listen to people on social media.
---
Just saying you could have already made an account better than your prior.
---
Proof?
---
If he didn't break the rules he would have appealed the ban and it would be approved and unbanned, just like my old shitty account that was unfairly banned for was. But keep up this long running bs of posting to the RS Reddit with life stories just to get shut down by a jmod.
---
Yesh
---
11 bucks to much for you?

Rule 5 only applies to players.

I haven‚Äôt logged in for like.. 4 days. All I see on Reddit is rage about lag and mobile being down xD
---
You still said you haven't botted at all. You are going to lose all credibility
---
If I were to make an educated guess, this is on purpose right now due to a malicious attack being performed on the servers. They will most likely revert this when they can better contain the attacks they have reported. I would have done the same.
---
Say hi to the fellas in Jersey for me. oh wait, that works. just like saying "vegas" works.

Here is the thing. Who is Michael RS? I don't mean that with disrespect towards him at all.  I'm not saying he didn't discover this what I am getting at is a would be willing to bet a lot of people don't know him. Therefore he doesn't get as much exposure and less people know. Rendi on the other hand is widely known in the community and gets a order of magnitude more exposure than Michael RS.
---
It‚Äôs new to me
---
but the dupe was crashing the server from overloading it with actions causing the world to crash, this is a DDoS attack which is why there are connectivity issues. You are wrong, stop blaming the poor guy, his actions have nothing to do with this.
---
I was recently banned on my alt account playing twisted league. I was banned for botting tho I haven't botted at all on it, and not on my main either.
---
I had the same thought you had until it happend to me..

World 91 works for me every time. Gg

Nah Literally most of the community dose not agree with you.. I defy don't and in.worrb bills on os

Uh, they will be the ones dumping the gold, they absolutely will benefit. Theyll flood the market, sell everything they can for whatever they can, pocket the profit and walk away, and everyone else will be stuck with the consequences.

Its a large scale pump and dump scheme

I don't think that an auto clicker from 4 years ago has anything to do with this

heat them up using the incredible amount of heat coming off of op's galaxy-sized brain. I would recommend wrapping them in tin foil to even the heat out but op's also got that covered.

Hasta is best in slot for Basilisk Knights and for tanking GWD. It is also good for Sire of you don't have arclight charges.
---
We are also due for more non-dragon mobs with stab weaknesses so it will likely become decent for those (beneath rapier)
---
He could have quite easily informed Jagex of the bug and done no more. The bug would have been fixed and it would still be the same small group of abusers looking for new exploits. Instead we have possibly everyone who has the slightest knowledge of bugs/ddos tools trying things to dupe.
---
Exactly. But whatever ill catch some downvotes for people either thinking i was serious or the sarcasm that i meant. Blaming rendi for this is ridiculous
---
Oof. No luck for me. Thanks though.
---
What do you think the goal of a DDOS attack is??
---
Huh?
---
It should for sure, but I don‚Äôt believe it will transfer over 100% of the processing load onto the GPU. I mainly pvp so I keep it on fixed mode + low detail 99% of the time and GPU rendering has little effect on FPS. When I play on stretched I do notice better frames with GPU rendering on compared to off.

Weekend = no one in the office
---
Of course they would have. The economy of OSRS being destroyed would suck for you, right? It would fuck up the game you love, many hours spent earning GP now worthless. For Jagex, it would lose them millions IRL, people would lose their jobs. Of course they would have.
---
The idea that Jagex should be open and honest about issues with the game is a great one. Even when it comes to security issues, this community cares a lot about the game and we want to know it's being taken care of properly, but there is an appropriate time to publically disclose security flaws, and that is **after** they have been fixed.
---
There is a reason Apple doesn't randomly tweet unfixed security flaws in iPhone. The best thing for a company to do about a bug which could be exploited by hackers / exploiters, is to quietly fix it **before** letting anyone else find out about it. (And best case, tell us afterwards please. I know Apple probably wouldn't do that but hopefully you get my point)

Yea, standard Windows keyboard settings which apply to any keyboard plugged in.  Don't need a special one, unless they want to go even faster than the max allowed repeat offered by Windows.

a lot of people use it at Cerberus as it's 1h crush weapon so they can still wear a spectral.

The reason why it says [noreply@jagex.com](mailto:noreply@jagex.com) is because it is spoofed. It is a phishing attempt.

did 2 hour dks trip few hours ago. had one 2 second freeze during that so doesnt seem too bad.
---
Huuuge if true!
---
If someone was trying to take a world offline for a monetary replication they wouldn't attack the host configs for the client and every single world. They would focus on one cluster. This is probably just an attack to fuck with Jagex/the players.

A bunch of stuff just meant I didn't have time to commit to getting back to where I was, I don't tend to have more than 2-3 hours a night I can commit to runescape anymore due to getting a new job (occasionally more but also often not even that) and the account didn't have enough cash to RWT but it did have things such as 99 crafting via ships, 99 fm,  99 thieving and IIRC (might be wrong) almost 85 slayer.
---
It just didn't have enough on it to viably even consider the possibility of RWT but it was definitely a frustration to lose and would at this point in my life not really be worth all the trouble of doing those grinds in the little time I have to play.
---
I'd consider starting again, but I don't even know why the first one got banned in the first place, so there's no guarantee I wouldn't spend all my evenings grinding back to a place I could enjoy playing just to get banned again.
---
Something something heat death
---
HD is trash, it makes the game look like every other MMO
---
That would mean putting resources into the game that jagex cannot afford ! Jagex has a tiny minuscule budget. Why do you think the servers are so inexpensive? Jagex has run out of money and the community is too small to fund them.
---
/sarcasm
---
Think thats the result of free mems through twitch prime ending so bots are having to buy bonds instead of spoofing twitch for free mems

I‚Äôve found that British worlds have not had as bad lag as American servers.
---
There is no fix. Some say to log into Australian worlds, or twisted league, but, at least for me, nothing is working.
---
People are censoring it because like two weeks ago if you said that you got perm banned from the sub...
---
Skybox Gpu setting in runelite
---
&gt;So does you think 11 bucks is a lot of cash
---
me does not think that but me think you don't think.
---
its for the best you deleted your comment.
---
Or they could just do NEW content in high detail only
---
This happening rn ?
---
I know right? You don‚Äôt change firewall rules to change save states in game
---
"Poor guy"? He's literally the one that found the dupe, he only made a video on it because he got pushed out. And then proceeds to act like he "saved" osrs from a problem he created. Fuck off with that shit
---
gz on pet
---
**5.**
---
**No accusing players of wrongdoing**
---
Let's hope so man thats a lot of accounts to get banned for the same issue that you admit to previously taking part in!
---
Best of luck here
---
Obviously you think it is
---
Plus go back to school me does üòÇ
---
Nope, you just gotta play on your work computer until you get fired
---
System update coming down right now! Hope it's a fix!
---
Not only that but there really are better things the devs could spend time on to improve the game more than adding HD graphics.
---
More like Pepega hat
---
No but there is a law against irresponsibly disclosing exploits causing financial damage. Judging by the cancelling of membership, Jagex could technically make a case, however an international suit against a player isn't great optics so I doubt this would actually happen.
---
Also it's clear you think I just "don't like Rendi" and you clearly don't see *why* I don't like him. But ok.
---
' Not many people have a 2000 account bot system set up, and the people who do are exactly the type to know others with such a system and to coordinate efforts with them. '
---
Yep, this is why when Rendi figured out the 'glitch', he approached people he knew with the capabilities and asked them to use their bot farms to crash worlds so he could get B Gloves without the XP Gains.
---
The 'original' duper was Rendi fullstop, he just got upset because his 'friends' he told who were able to shut down the servers then cut him out.
---
rs3 mobile lol
---
did it yesterday they rewarded me w a pet
---
Servers with 200 players lag right now...
---
servers are actually very crisp for me after the very recent update
---
Rendi can dance with a train for all I care.
---
I still take Rendi's side.
---
Anyone who isn't a "huge dumb fuck" realizes that the people who are crashing servers now are or found out about the method from the people who first attempted the glitch.
---
Here‚Äôs a quote from Jagex‚Äôs account security update blog from ocetober, way before any of this dupe shit.   
---
¬´However, we've also endured a sustained multi-month attack on our servers, and the time required to manage this has pushed back other, more visible, projects.¬ª
---
Link: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/account-security-features---status-update?oldschool=1
---
Those attacks are still going on (like they said in the post you quoted), and is the reason for the server lag. The way the dupe glitch worked shouldn‚Äôt affect any worlds except the ones they were crashing anyway, and it would be obvious because they would be full. Please don‚Äôt make claims that don‚Äôt have any evidence behind them just because you‚Äôre pissed about the servers being laggy.
---
His YouTube video was purely to tell the community, not Jagex.
---
Why would I provide evidence if people are getting banned for it XD? You believing people aren't auto clicking in 2019, nearly 2020, is naive lul.
---
Try it right now i just fixed it for everyone
---
The ban was not related to these sort of bans in anyway, that was a brand new account and new ones tend to be unfairly banned, yes, you'll see it in the mobile reviews occasionally. There is zero reason an account that has existed for years would ever be banned for the same reason.
---
Name a single streamer that was unfairly banned with no jmods watching, good luck.
---
I don't defend Jagex, I think they're a shitty company with terrible practices and I don't pay for the game anymore because of that, but I'm not going to pretend like they don't have a fully functional ban appeal page that I've personally used.
---
To be fair though, good MMO servers should have transactional, atomic events when they save character / game state. A roll back should not end up in an inconsistent state.
---
R/woooosh
---
Coldfix
---
People were ddosing because they knew about the dupe glitch and were trying to reproduce it. And how did they know? Please, would you enlighten me?
---
What does reviving have to do with receiving
---
I‚Äôm sure people do it. Claiming *everyone* does it is incredibly wrong. Especially considering the statistics on how many people play mobile, where it‚Äôs impossible.
---
\&gt; No but there is a law against irresponsibly disclosing exploits causing financial damage.
---
There is not.  Rendi didn't sign an NDA.  He can disclose anything the fuck he wants.  Note how people have discussed this exploit for years on youtube.  Facts do not care about your feelings.  The only people who have a legally defined "responsibility" to a product are the people who sell the product.  But that's not something you want to admit so you'll blame anyone and anything other than them.
---
\&gt; Also it's clear you think I just "don't like Rendi" and you clearly don't see *why* I don't like him. But ok.
---
I mean you're failing to make a case against him other than you not liking him soooo I'm just using deduction here.
---
You‚Äôre a wizard and a god..thank you
---
The gauntlet is dungeoneering
---
cast the spell "high level alchemy" on thyself
---
I agree that showing no proof or reason to the ban is pretty bad and I wish that they did that. But for other people who didn't know, well ignorance isn't a good reason to not get banned.
---
Coldfix requires an update
---
How do they not have the resources when we all pay $11 each? Monthly! Instead of blindly profiting they could employ more people and invest into their own game.

You can also floormouse if you want to do something else with your hands
---
my guess is they caught you macroing at some point and flagged your ip and is just banning everything on the same ip.
---
why doubt? If his accs were already 94-99 mage he probably didnt use any autocick again.
---
Mine was working fine before, no lag, nothing... I worried it would stop working after the update but nope it‚Äôs still completely fine.

Was interested in the price of a bond depending on currency/location, made a table to share.

Roadhouse
---
Thanks for the tip will try later. Could save me from an embarrassing forfeit.
---
'The people who first attempted the glitch'. 
---
You mean Rendi?
---
He was the one that discovered it and approached 2 people he knew with bot farms that could take the servers down. He wanted B Gloves without the Xp gains.
---
He was the main instigator for all this.
---
Only reason he 'alerted' Jagex was because the guys he was colluding with cut him out of the deal and just used the glitch to dupe gp instead.
---
Iconic
---
Which was a pain in the ass because it was never consistent. At first it was any UK world, then it was a Twisted League world, then it was a world with a skill requirement you don't have, and then it became random.
---
Not their fault maybe, but they're responsible. It's their game and they're supposed to protect it and keep it running for the customers who pay and play it.
---
you are adding 1+1 and getting 576 .
---
&gt;ignorance isn‚Äôt a good reason to not get banned
---
You‚Äôre totally right, but I‚Äôm just saying how would they become less ignorant?
---
It‚Äôs like any common law. Lots of people break laws they didn‚Äôt know they were breaking, and then get prosecuted. They then discover how and why what they were doing was wrong, and that it‚Äôs wrong.
---
In this instance, someone is told they broke the law (but not how), they get jailed for it, and that‚Äôs it. When they get set free they still have no idea what they did, so now they‚Äôre just as likely to do it again.
---
He explained it perfectly fine you're just retarded
---
"If you normally hold down C for a few seconds you'll see like "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC" but with my keyboard you get "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"

As in the repeat rate for holding down keys is much faster.
---
69 degrees
---
I‚Äôm gonna copy paste my comment from another post where they made a similar claim so hopefully fewer people will spread this misinformation: 
---
Here‚Äôs a quote from Jagex‚Äôs account security update blog from october, way before any of this dupe shit.
---
Those attacks are still going on (like jagex said in their post today), and is the reason for the server lag. The way the dupe glitch worked shouldn‚Äôt affect any worlds except the ones they were crashing anyway, and it would be obvious because they would be full.
---
So you are saying to buy bonds in pesos
---
I just bring one inventory at a time, and if I get attacked I bury whatever i have left
---
oh ok, thanks for actually giving me the answer instead of telling me that googling it would have been faster lol
---
While im not downvoting the guy myself i could see why he is being downvoted. The downvote is for things that do not pertain to or add discussion to the post. Saying support is like upvoting with the chance of getting upvotes so the downvotes hide these comments to make more relevant ones float up
---
not the point my boy, the point is thay we were unlucky to have this happen towards the end of our mem sub
---
Pesos or Reals. Not sure why it's that much cheaper.
---
Bad for the management.
---
It was okay I saw a post about Zulrah
---
Oh, do you can disclose 100% of an active exploit without giving a company ample time to address said exploit? Wow, you might want to tell that to the numerous "white-hat" hackers (more gray-hat but it's not important) who irresponsibly disclosed in this manner causing serious financial impact and got fucking sued. I'd say I'm making a pretty good case here.
---
For the first 6 months to 1 year you'll be spending 99.95% of playtime grinding for bonds since you're on a brand new account. Buy membership for now instead.
---
This also worked for me first try and every try since then today. I‚Äôm US but still applies.
---
for a sec after i clicked this I thought i was looking at a pk clan in the wild
---
Ok let's crucify him for saying in the video he was going to use this exploit to make accounts for his series then. Dudes a scumbag.
---
Oh really? Just reinstalled java and works perfectly fine now but you seem to be a smart person, child.
---
Mobile still fucked for me.
---
i had the same question and had just finished googling it so i thought id pay it forward and save you some time :p
---
The only reasonable solution is going to be at least 2 days of membership for everyone I imagine.
---
Sunlight is a disinfectant. 
---
Every company on Earth has this problem and its exactly why white and grey hats publicly release exploit information, to force the companies to get their thumbs out of their asses and get to work. 
---
Every single day the hacking community is approaching major corporations and informing them of critical exploits that need to be fixed, or of breaches that need to be disclosed, it is common practice to then give them terms or a deadline to take appropriate action, and if those terms or that deadline are not reached, the information goes public and the company is now forced to at least acknowledge the problem. 
---
Keeping exploits secret from the public when both the company and the malicious actors know about it does nothing but put the public at risk.
---
None of this is Rendi's fault. This would be happening with or without him, the only difference is because of him we all know what is going on and it forced Jagex to address it both publicly and internally. Otherwise they would have kept us in the dark, censored dissent, and allowed this huge risk to fester.
---
Found the botter.
---
This sub is so fucking dumb. First of all, the dupe method of exploiting save states has been known for years. Second of all, the servers were DDoSed like this just 5-6 years ago. Hence current death mechanics.
---
Blaming this on rendi is just ridiculous. Swear to god this is the dumbest online gaming community in the world
---
I would need to see your evidence to support your claim. All you have posted is conjecture with some convenient connections drawn from a youtube video
---
Maybe I'm on at weird times or something, but I've seen the runite rocks in the mining guild just sitting there several times.
---
Thanks, didn't saw that tho. Just reinstalled my java and laggs are gone instantly.
---
!RemindMe 5 days
---
Oh yeah jagex want to loose money good theory.
---
Fact 1: Servers have been utter shit across the board for about a week, to the point where virtually everyone has experienced it.  Even logging into clients has been affected.
---
Fact 2: Jagex have made a public statement a week later stating that the cause of the issues was vague "malicious attacks" (presumably DDOS or something similar since nothing else could even possibly cause server issues like this)
---
Fact 3: DDOS attacks have been a staple of osrs for over half a decade now.  They're typically localized to specific worlds, have a clear chain of motive, and are almost immediately called out as such by the community.  No one's posited that these have been DDOS issues until Jagex suggested it.  In fact, most people have been trying to draw connections to the fact that Discord and google servers have also been eating shit this week.  Nor have DDOS attacks ever before caused mobile outages, especially to the point where it is literally not possible to log in.
---
From these facts, you're concluding that it must be the fault of a random content creator that made a video about a DDOS attack that targets incredibly specific worlds that happened 4 weeks ago at this point.  It is clear that your opinion is not evidence-motivated.
---
Gal Owl.
---
If it's that big of a deal to you then cancel your membership
---
I have that problem too lol
---
Hiscores are also lagging behind the game itself.  After a tree run, I hit 63 Farming and logged off.  Nearly an hour later and the hiscores still haven't updated accordingly.
---
This. Full blown server stuttering lag doesn't occur because of attacks on player connectivity like a DDoS attack. It's because of the server itself lagging. This is absolutely something on Jagex's end, and it's likely a result of an engine change related to preventing the recent dupe bug.
---
Ouch
---
Yeah it is possible that people are attacking the servers hoping to execute a bug in another way. But what reason is there to believe that? Other than the timing. The servers are shit every now and then so this isn't a huge coincidence
---
You know the dupe glitch was centralised before right?
---
Rendi found it &gt; told 2 others about it &gt; 2 people try to bring down servers. 
---
Good thing with it being only 2 people is that they cant cause that much damage. Jagex were looking into it and trying to find ways to mitigate.
---
Now we move onto the timeline after the vid.
---
Rendi makes vid &gt; botters outside of the centralised 2 that rendi told now find out about this &gt; instead of 4k accounts being launched, now theres more.
---
Sure the casuals now knew about the glitch but now so do hundreds of bot makers and runners and now they all go to work trying to replicate the glitch.
---
Instead of allpwing Jagex to finish working, Rendi forced then to do hot/cold fixes to stop the sudden influx of botters trying to do the glitch, which has caused the servers to fuck up.
---
Important to note that he gave away the method after it was patched. U cant crash the same way he showed, proof of patch working was in the video
---
The accuracy is unnerving sponge-bob has truly captured it. Down to claiming the easiness of it
---
Membership
---
There's not smackdoens or jmod replies because they've started to do them in pms instead  because the public was having too much of an Influence on the outcomes
---
Idk to me you seem pretty depressed and bitter, not the other way around. You're the one making sad bitter comments.
---
tbh it's kinda annoying when people put terms on urbandictionary that nobody ever actually uses it
---
My main account was hacked and got perm for macro major, from me being an idiot and torrenting shit, and when I put in the appeal, they confirmed I had been hacked and unbanned me. They then banned me the next day for the same offense same timeframe and ignore my appeals.
---
Already did.
---
Servers are laggy, people prayer flick in nmz, some people bot the prayer flicking. Since that flicking is basically impossible with said server lag, the guy died while botting nmz and is now doing it right outside of it, flicking his prayer to nothing.
---
You have to make a dedicated account for pvp. The [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Free-to-play_combat_pure_guide) has a guide with all of the pure builds you can make and you can always do more research into the different builds after you find one that you think you‚Äôll like
---
No. You just dont understand the point of Twisted league
---
They can take away our game (shit servers and service), but thankfully they cant take this fantastic sub. I laughed! Thanks!
---
I don't know how somebody can be so willfully ignorant of the fact that Jagex does make mistakes and lies to cover them up to save face.
---
Also, don't confuse questionable plugins with features that should already be in the game but aren't.
---
Hold the smoke in boys, hold it in
---
Its extremely easy for them to tell if you were hacked and botted vs just botted
---
I agree with you, but didn't everyone praise him two weeks ago when the video was out? I don't understand this sub. Now suddenly everyone hates him.
---
What do you mean? Having multiple alts makes money making extremely easy...?
---
Honestly, they shouldn't cater to Ironmen. I have 0 kc and idgaf if i have to grind for an Arcane. If anything, it's more exciting because then I will have so much more of a reason to do Corp; Pvm gear upgrades/updates should be constructed not just with the 'avg player' in mind but the overall difficulty/price being taken into consideration. A magical offhand that gives mage str bonus is a very huge upgrade; it doesn't NEED to be available to everyone. Upgrades that are that strong should be locked behind a big gp cost or a lengthy time consuming grind if you're an ironman.
---
Dude 11 dollars isn't much for the amount of content you get in return, try playing  a garbage game like retail WoW who not only has less content, higher subscripton fee but an initial price for the base game.
---
What dumb ass phone is that? Why is your functionality bar on the right and not on the bottom of yours screen.
---
Lol rapier was massive inflated and now its stable. That price change had nothing to do with the economy going sour.
---
I actually tried this twice but for some reason it wouldn't let me bury the bones after being attacked in the temple. Considering I didn't feel like gathering bones again I started to just log the second I saw anyone else log in, pretty sure that the only way you can die at the wildy altar is them catching you when you teleport there or if you mess up, otherwise I have spent hours there never once dying unless I let them kill me for free tele.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you are talking about
---
this. You can bot, make mills, transfer and profit. Jagex cuts that out, especially easy if its all on the same IP.
---
They don't really ignore them, but they stopped replying in the comments
---
Now what they do is wait for the thread to die down, then pm op and take care of the issue.
---
There's no reason for them to involve the whole subreddit.
---
You got me there
---
OP hasn't accused anybody of being a bot, he simply showed someone flicking outside nmz.

---
Quick Update: The first graph in the photo should Say Nov 18th - Dec 8th as that is the actual range of data used. Additionally the big jump you see about 2/3 of the way through is the effect of the removal of point smurfing
---
Can we not say Du P3 in this sub the normal way or something?
---
isn't this the definition of a froob?
---
How do people who run have a higher chance of dying?
---
DDoSing a server makes players disconnect by overloading the connection nodes connecting to the server. It doesn't cause the world itself and all the NPC's in it to freeze for several seconds at a time like has been happening here. That behavior can only be caused by a process using too many system resources and causing lag on the server box itself. 
---
This is purely on Jagex's end, likely as a result of a half baked engine fix attempt for that recent dupe
---
why u be mean
---
What time of the day is wildy prayer safe to do and what time is it dangerous?
---
I have a pure I posted about on this reddit account that was banned for macroing by hijacking, had the appeal denied, and further appeals have been ignored, so I doubt it's 99.9% of the time just like bot detection isn't 99.9% accurate
---
Shit that's funny
---
Yeah, this account is probably headed straight for duel arena
---
[these are my stats](https://i.imgur.com/dOPx5jt.png)
---
Keep trying to connect to different worlds via the workaround. I eventually got in after trying a few.
---
I just checked and why would I need a defense/ attack/ etc of 1 for some of those? is it bad that mine is already higher?
---
&gt;That's not what he's saying at all. If Rendi gave them a few days to fix it, THEN release it, that'd be fine. 
---
48-72 hours from the moment of the disclosure the game would have died. So much money would have been created that the economy would have entirely collapsed. There was no luxury of "giving them a few days" especially when theyve known this was theoretically possible for over a year. 
---
&gt; It's not like Jagex was purposely ignoring/not doing anything. 
---
They knew for over a year, did nothing.
---
&gt; They even said they were working on the fix. He immediately made the video when jagex didn't respond for -2 HOURS- at 5am UK time. He made the video about him being "ignored" by jagex rather than the dupe itself.
---
The situation was time sensitive and was literally a matter of hours before it became critical. Hours went by, no response, so he pulled the trigger. 
---
&gt;If he talked about the dupe WITHOUT SAYING HOW TO DO IT EXACTLY, that'd be one thing. But he literally gave every cheater/duper/exploiter the ability to know how to do the dupe and it's now causing over a week of lag. Whistleblowers should not be punished, but he refused to even let them have time to fix it.
---
Thats how these issues are dealt with, disclosure forces companies to act. If its just a few bad actors they can sweep it under the rug, if everyone knows, they have no choice but to take immediate action. 
---
This situation required immediate action, his disclosure provided that immediate action. Without his disclosure, immediate action would not have been taken. 
---
&gt;If they refused to fix it, sure, exploit them. but they said they were working on it.
---
See everything above.
---
Got mine on 26 kc :) i wish you luck on your grind!
---
The dupers already knew they could dupe by crashing the server
---
I am paying for a service that does not work and your sitting here telling me about how I should be happy about it because it's cheap. 
---
Then you give me your opinion on another game.
---
Well please send me $11 a month for a game you cant play. Dont complain about it thou because I think its better than OSRS, just shut up and send me the money and be happy with no product.
---
Ty
---
Get your construction up.
---
Ah I didn't check it that closely you're right.
---
Shame we won't get one.
---
Mods are completely MIA whenever there are server issues
---
Having 1 defense gives you the ability to have a really high strength level but also keeps your combat level low. It basically makes it so you can deal much more damage than someone who isn‚Äôt a pure at the same combat level
---
Still can't
---
anything but points means less chance to get the prize tho.,
---
If you are a member get some decent gear and make some money pvming if you have high enough stats. Otherwise just put it into a skill construction is useful.
---
nay
---
Lol people will be at f2p in max gear going "someone give me a bond, I'll pay you back when I sell some stuff"
---
"Something like Runelite"
---
Did you use Runelite, or did you use a different client? AFAIK no one has been banned for using rl since the world hop issue way back (and those were reversed), but other clients that do sketchier things might get you banned.
---
It's crazy how we take for granted the times when there's no lag
---
Spotty servers for (*checks notes*) three days is equal to a week of membership?
---
Yeah.  You get 5 seconds to swap prayers because of the server lag
---
Best i can do is 100gp, theres not really a market for tbows
---
for what?
---
Yes redirect to the scumbag players that RWT, bot, and do other bad activities.
---
Once you load those servers you can pick a different world
---
Paging One Kik Rick
---
good on Jagex to recycle that &gt;.&gt;
---
1 is more than you have
---
iirc unless there was a specific reason you needed to run later it was always faster to just keep walking
---
Well that sucks
---
yea reposts should be fine imo as long as its been that long. not everyone seen it the first time
---
Can I get some links about that? I somehow missed that whole thing
---
The result of multiple years of siphoning off maximum profit to Chinese overlords instead of investing in devs and infrastructure. 
---
Milking the cash cow and not addressing things until there is social media outcry is jagex m-o.
---
There's alot of hot takes going on atm but this ain't it chief.
---
Mobile has bots, no reason they couldn't auto click. Stop talking out your ass. Mouse keys, AHK, auto clicking, have all been staples of RuneScape. Not justifying them, but seriously please just stop.
---
Very brave post
---
Well magic is utterly useless because they won't buff magic damage so don't bring that. Just bring full rune, a bow, and scim people.
---
Pretty sure they made roughly 40m in profits last year.
---
[this](https://youtu.be/Nsa9Kycdcqs) is a decent guide. You can really just search f2p pure pvp guide and find a lot of good results
---
Change shirtless guy to Rendi and you got it more correct
---
God Ash has no power over this, but if he did, you better believe that plug would have been pulled and plugged back in several times already.
---
Same thing happened to me, the account had 40 range and t1 mage. Nothong special. Banned for macroing. I was using runelite and if i was botting i sure wouldnt have stopped that those levels
---
It missed a stage, it should of been d long -&gt; d scim upgrade kit -&gt; whip upgrade and so on. 
---
Tome is + 15 mage deff and attack, negative deff everywhere else and -5 prayer... the prayer wont matter at raids because renewal, 1tick flickers wont notice, but everyone else will. Is it a big enough trade off for +1 max hit? I dont know.. but depending how hard the nightmare is, i dont see a problem of a high accuracy high defense ‚Äúbis‚Äù co existing with a high dmg low accuracy ‚Äúbis‚Äù
---
I know people want more dmg instead accuracy because accuracy doesnt matter.
---
I would just make it only a task for the lower level slayer masters. It‚Äôs not going to pass polls if you force everyone with elite void to take up a block slot for it. Those are really valuable
---
Wait wouldn‚Äôt rune lower my range?
---
I'm down
---
I mean, name one game that is as big as osrs that talks to and listens to their player base.
---
Lmfao. I‚Äôm 120 with over 2b bank, but thanks for the assumptions
---
What the fuck does that have to do with anything lol? I mean at that point, you‚Äôre just wasting your parents‚Äô money. Idk what point you‚Äôre trying to make here
---
Licky licky booty booty mlem mlem
---
I voted no To pvp updates. Reeeeeeeeeee
---
Employment is better gp/hr than any other in-game method. Why tf would you give that up? =O
---
I appreciate how you included your bank value but not your tob kc, as if that's whats relevant. Or a single counter argument for that matter
---
When you play for free and are just eating your popcorn.
---
Buy me 3 bonds - thanks in advance
---
I don't doubt it.

I made 10 pures one day and started to train them. I got to the 10th one and decided that I didn't have time to multi log train it with the rest so I just took him to wc a bit. As soon as I clicked the 1st tree the accounts all got perm banned.  
---
Appealed it to no avail.  
---
Wasn't that bummed because I only put in about 1 day of effort. Since then under the same exact email I've made 20 more pures without issue.  
---
So yeah mistake perm bans on multi logged pures happens.  
---
I've never macroed. I've never shared accounts.
---
Mtx bad, rs3 ok.
---
Swamp man good, runecraft bad
---
11$ per month, were sad.
---
A poem, if you will
---
This is literally rendis fault for making a video about it so that everyone knows
---
Oh sorry. Players that stay have a 100% chance of dying but with no items to drop it‚Äôs just a bank trip. Which is what an empty bone guy wants 
---
Running to tele with your 5 bones = mebbe ded
---
Rendi himself stated there were only two people who knew about the exploit. While it is reasonable to believe it's them, it's also reasonable to believe that people with the resources who did not know the exploit before are trying now.
---
Without any more information we won't know for sure.
---
That‚Äôs just a myth like the boogeyman or a G spot.
---
It doesn't NEED to be a tome, but it IS right now, so it makes more sense to upgrade a book. Change the stats on it and let it upgrade the book and make another enhancement for the shield with the current tome stats, whatever, makes no difference to me.  
---
And I said that offense trumps defense, in the content available now, but that may not always be the case.
---
edit: I think it should be added as an insignia or paint or led lights to arcane because it's more in the spirit of bis gear, but with turning a shield vs book into a tome, it makes more sense for it to be the book.
---
I think that they only do that if there is evidence of gold farming with a huge bot farm. Back in the day I botted all the time on new accounts and my main never got banned.
---
LOL Arislash got shit on.
---
thanks king
---
Thanks! Not my first, but first on mobile.
---
It's working for me now
---
It's still a cool achievement though OP :)
---
He was part of that group and got cut out, that‚Äôs why he made the video, cause he wasn‚Äôt getting his lambo
---
Yeah the servers being shit is getting to be old news at, I wanna see a good old fashioned smackdown of OP possibly threatening to DDoS people, etc, or maybe OP got falsely banned.
---
Tf are you talking about?
---
People would ddos the world causing players bossing (god wars for example) to die, take their items. This caused the one hour timer instead of 2 minutes, and players can‚Äôt see your dropped items anymore.
---
Because there is no solution aside from making HD non-toggleable. Stop bashing for no reason.
---
GL
---
It obviously doesn't because that would be unprofessional. What we do know though is that someone is attacking the server, and this came right after we found out that attacking the server is a vital part of the glitch. Who recently put out a video talking about all the glitch and its methods? No one is saying Rendi is attacking the server, but you can't deny that this is happening way too close to the release of the video. Account for the time someone would need to set up the methods (2000 accounts created, or whatever else they're trying), and the timeline works perfectly.
---
Lol. Ive been having issues over a week if I recall right
---
See my response to TehChid below.
---
Neither one are going to happen
---
But now the people who weren't in the community know and want in on the pie.
---
I got myself all hyped to try it like midweek last week, then came back to find everything like it was. I just got pots and supplies to do it and waited.
---
Guess I can't put it off any longer. The whole mobile thing freaks me out though.
---
Gz! Btw
---
Since we both know you cannot substantiate any part of that, maybe just don't bother saying it.
---
I mean if you care about maxing it‚Äôs worth it. I take it you‚Äôre a main account so you could buy it if you want.
---
I‚Äôd say yes....it‚Äôs definitely worth. It reduces bank space and at the end of the day it‚Äôs a 99 :)
---
Buy Bonds in pesos and then resell usd=profit
---
No one was sweeping it under the rug lol. It‚Äôs pretty standard to not talk about exploits while they can still be exploited? Why would they want to give any information away at the time?
---
I'll be honest with you mate, the fact that you personally make alot of money and comfortable with the price doesn't mean the price IS fair, yeah "shit happens", but when you pay so much money compared to other games you expect that shit to not happen every once in a while.
---
l m a o
---
Roughly 155 I believe, wbu?
---
Durial321 might just be the hero we need... bank your items.
---
Do some research
---
If things happened your way there wouldnt be a game and we wouldn't have this discussion. We would be talking about the death of this game and what we are playing next. 
---
Disclosure forces companies to act, secrecy allows them to sweep these things under the rug. 
---
The disclosure forced Jagex to act immediately, and saved the game. Letting everyone know and creating immediate risk is the only thing that stopped the dupe in its tracks. 
---
Thank god you werent the one who found this, we would have all been fucked.
---
Cerb boots would like a word with you.
---
I agree with the top reply, you shouldnt cater to irons with something like this because thats kinda the point of the game mode. That being said, i dont know the best solution here and I dont think augmenting arcane is it.
---
How viable is it to just say screw it and go in ‚Äúblind‚Äù?  Like, with good gear but not studying patterns or anything like that?
---
I dunno, I think they're interesting at least, and it can increase OP's chances of a false infraction being looked into. I've seen lots of smackdowns go both ways.
---
For sure, especially since i cant even get a rune scim lol
---
It was after Jagex came out and send rendi basically just went batshit crazy that they turned on him, meanwhile I was sitting here wondering in what world what he did was heroic and not fucking moronic from the getgo.
---
Google "varrock world 2 2006"?
---
I‚Äôm in....oh wait false alarm. No I‚Äôm not.
---
Just a friendly banter
---
But lying on Reddit doesn't get him anywhere anyway.  If there was real proof of breaking the TOS this time around, they aren't going to reverse a ban because of some Reddit post, so it doesn't do any good to call him a liar until we know he's a liar.  Yeah, he didn't include that he did something wrong 4 years ago, but I wouldn't have either.... just because it shouldn't be relevant to this time around, he already got punished for that, and corrected his action. They won't go ban my other accounts 2 years down the road because of something I already got punished for on a different account years ago.  That doesn't really make any sense.  
---
That is why I agree with him that including that in his post was irrelevant.
---
So either he is lying (which, to be clear, I'm not saying is impossible obviously), he did something to break the rules unknowingly, or Jagex made a mistake.  I would be very upset if I made this post and people said that because I broke the TOS years ago (and already had the punishment and corrected my actions) that I was very obviously lying about this time around. 
---
I doubt Jagex made a mistake, but it isn't impossible, so I choose to give him the benefit of the doubt until shown otherwise.
---
I guess he could‚Äôve dropped/destroyed those items? Not sure what else he could‚Äôve done
---
We also have cheesecake over here....
---
Too get 1m gp/hr atleast requires 82 with astrals and that is a long ass grind assuming rc averages 60k xp/hr at lavas. Its a good long term goal, gl
---
Exactly. Bunch of whiners on this subreddit
---
That is fucking terrifying
---
I pay for membership with bonds. I‚Äôm out at least 4mill because of this server shit. I‚Äôm not realistically expecting any kind of compensation, but there should be something to make up for this.
---
I hope you make more, I love pixel art and you did a great job :)
---
Thank you Rendi
---
It's not a super fixable thing. Like the "fix" would be to make every action make a new savestate.
---
Which would be fucking insane, no game does that because it's insanely taxing on the servers.
---
Classic big brain reddit
---
You mean RS Youtubers
---
Anglos have always just ignored issues rather than trying to deal with it.
---
So ignore the main reward mechanism and quit if you ever think about trying to get a decent reward from said mechanism?
---
I had pretty much same situation two years ago. I had level 3 random account that didn't have any use, no stats or anything and it was made when osrs came out, someone hacked it and botted 90 smithing for it and it got banned, but I was able to get it unbanned and recoveried it. Account had 120k cannonballs botted in bank and GE history was showing even more lol I don't know wtf is wrong these people that they hack some useless level 3 account and bot with it
---
Basic logic would indicate he is guilty, retard. And I just outlined to you why. Even if he didn‚Äôt intend for the servers to be constantly disconnected, it is still his fault for explaining to everyone how the dupe works, causing a lot more people to try their hand at the dupe. 
---
Can you explain how me saying rendi is responsible for this is defending jagex in any way? Where is this leap in logic coming from?
---
Jagex is wrong in very few cases, you just have a confirmation bias because of the few wrongly banned posts that show up on reddit.
---
The dupe has been theorized for a while. His livelihood depends on the health of the game. I'm sure if he was responsible, it would have been done well and he wouldn't have contacted the mods about it.
---
The picture you're trying to paint doesn't make sense.
---
The dupe was fixed, for years now world 2 gets ddosed left right and center this is the first time i've seen multiple worlds and servers apperently being fucked if you remotely think that Rendi solved something with his video you're a moron.
---
The best he did was make the issue public more then anyone else could have done.
---
what‚Äôs your point..?
---
He reported it to the mods and gave them a bunch of information about it. I really don't understand how you're trying to interpret that as malice.
---
gz on pet, gl on ur tanz fang!
---
the easiest solution is to just drop tome as is, and if it passes buff the arcane to give it a strong niche like spec(well, kinda- spectral does have potential future usage..)/ely have.
---
"Can't legally force an entity to do something" and "Can't expect expect/demand an entity to do something" are very different statements.
---
You might not have a leg to stand on in court, but in the court of public opinion it's very reasonable to expect an apology compensation from a company that wants the continued support and patronage of it's customers.
---
If account was really hacked and botted (they can see that) and youre the original owner, they will unban it when you appeal for it on their site
---
damn tru
---
u/JagexSween
---
I don't mind the servers being laggy or DCing me it's not a big deal but wow.. imagine being such a piece of shit that you buy a botnet to disrupt this timeless classic of a game because you didn't get your way. I truly hope you get what's coming to you and enjoy the big pile of shit you eat for dinner.

&gt;And if it was, that's not a big deal.

&gt;And if it is, that's not my fault.

&gt;And if it was, I didn't mean it.

I don't think they get paid enough to do their normal job.  If I were working there, there is no way I would come in on a weekend.

Hmm that's actually quite amazing. Could try lava runes with that. Although my xp rates were shit even with rings of dueling.
---
Exactly what i was thinking.
---
Last poll there was multiple TOB questions, which anyone could vote on. Being someone who hasn't done TOB, how should i know if they need to buff blood splat attacks. and hows that fair to the people who do TOB and want this changed. 
---
Yes i know i can skip the question but i guarantee people still randomly choose an answer.

Ill never look at smoke devils the same

\&gt; Even if he didn‚Äôt intend for the servers to be constantly disconnected, it is still his fault for explaining to everyone how the dupe works, causing a lot more people to try their hand at the dupe.   
---
Do you have any evidence that people trying the dupe is what's causing the server issues?  Because as anyone with any server knowledge has said, nothing of the sort would cause clients to literally be unable to connect to any world.  Basic logic would indicate you have no clue what you're talking about, retard.
---
\&gt; Can you explain how me saying rendi is responsible for this is defending jagex in any way? 
---
Mainly your projection regarding assuming that I'm whiteknighting for Rendi and not just spitting straight facts.   You could just be saying wrong things for the heck of it, but ya know, occam's razor.
---
Sure, but for more than the first day while the app simply wouldn't load to access it (I'm sure you've seen the error at this point) not many people new about the workaround including me. And since it became common knowledge, it has worked for me personally maybe 20-30 percent of the time. I have spoken to and seen reports from several people who it worked for even less or not at all. It's not about all of the servers being down as a whole. It's about not being able to successfully access the mobile app, even from the workaround for many people. It was not a universal fix, sorry. Yep, that's a lot of lost play time and a lot of points.
---
Quake
---
Lmfao you guys have said you would do that going forward so many times
---
The most recent smackdown I saw was someone who claimed they never botted and therefore shouldn't have been banned, and a Jagex mod showed up and said that they were banned for adding Runelite plugins that could send altered information to Jagex servers to bypass game mechanics. Sure, not botting, but still CLEARLY against the rules, and OP was just like "oh, yeah okay, I did do that, ban makes sense" 
---
Fuckin ridiculous. There are plenty of plugins people add to Runelite that aren't simply quality of life features that should already be in the game. IMO if you add literally ANY plugin to Runelite that isn't there by default, you do so at your own peril
---
This has been happening to me for the last 3 days too, I've made 2 reddit posts about it but I've had no solutions.
---
There has been bug since last week
---
He informed mods about the exploit that was about to be abused and irreparably damage the game.
---
You see how long it takes jagex to deal with stuff, right? They need days of back and forth communication between the network guys and the devs.
---
It would only take 4 or so crashes to produce 10x more money than exists in the entire game. If jagex moseyed along to their patch, there's a big chance that the dupes would happen in the meantime and the game ruined.
---
Dope, appreciate it
---
**Also rules of the sub state that flaming other players is not allowed yet the whole thread is filled with people who trash on him hard.** Doesn't count for public figures in the community.  
---
This is Rendi's fault for pretending he was a god and how without him Jagex wouldn't of seen the obvious.
---
I hear you completely :) maybe I'm just jaded haha, also, keep in mind that he felt the need to share his prior botting with the fake jmod account, but decided to redact the info on this post. Clearly he thought it would be relevant to some degree but has left it out on his reddit post - perhaps to try get more traction?
---
Tbh I don't really mind if he did it or not, just the way he's gone about it is fishy lol.
---
I miss my poor Chaotics. All that time, wasted.
---
are we not even able to discus the word dupe? thats messed up.
---
And Jagex does something with it? Or just the typical "5k upvote and we may do it" thing?
---
This post is just a bunch of speculative dogma.
---
Badass, good job
---
Don't have proof he sells capes? Except he admitted to it on twitter and has an entire store page on a popular site.
---
Because it is, he told the entire world in detail what happens with trades, GE offers and half detailed on how to crash the entire server.
---
Runelite and "something like Runelite" can be two very different things.
---
The latter
---
Dragon tales lol?
---
Whistleblowing a bad situation is more reprehensible than the actual bad situation.  That is the rule of whiteknighting.
---
Run your fool.
---
Don't stress. Almost every single one of these posts are bullshit.
---
There's a reason it's based on 2007. Because that's what people campaigned to bring back. Look at the name of this sub - it was originally based on a private server of the same name. If you want 2010scape why don't you campaign for it like we did instead of just moaning? Then the 7 of you who want HD cartoon graphics can finally shut up
---
you also cant prove he didnt cause it unless you work at jagex and can prove otherwise. So technically your just like the others, saying bias things claiming their true when they might not be.
---
That part when you go zero to waifu in 30 seconds
---
Yikes
---
You can change the order of what you kill then too based off how they spawn and come at you. Sometimes I will have to prioritize the ranger because he ended up spawning next to me, ECT.
---
When it comes down to it a lot of the fight is just moving things around into place, and avoiding specific monsters in the start of a fight.
---
Sometimes I'll kill the 360 first so I can hide from stuff and afk heal while I take a break or something. It's really situational.
---
I remember in 06 I died in edgeville and I didnt have teleports in my bank (f2p and I was 7 years old) and lost my rune armor and scimmy and quit after that
---
Dude you are riding his dick hard in every thread right now lol
---
"they had to halt work temporarily to talk to talk to this autistic community"
---
Hmm yes because osrs team consists of one person. No they didn't stop working on a fix. Unfortunately you're coming across pretty retarded when you're trying to say that the entire osrs team suddenly stopped all work to put together a couple of sentences of "we know we're fixing it dw." But hey, we've got you to open our eyes so that's a bonus I suppose.
---
is that enough to buy customer support?
---
I‚Äôll keep bringing this up:
---
I got a mute for no reason and a threatening email in my Jagex message center saying if I did it (they didn‚Äôt specify the offense) again I would be permed.
---
I made a post on Reddit and I was talking again in about 2 hours.  Later that day, the email mysteriously vanished.
---
I still to this day do not know what the mute was for, who issued it, who looked into it or who removed it.  I‚Äôm just lucky my post got enough upvotes to get a mods attention and they took action secretly without admitting In the comments there was even a mistake.
---
Hardly call making a humorous meme as gatekeeping
---
While I agree for the most part that types of content shouldn't be balanced around ironmen, I think there are instance where exceptions can be made and they're taken into consideration. A recent update in RS3 for example added a borderline useless potion flask which requires a bunch of random items to make. One of the things required demands that the player has 40K extra fine sand as part of the creation process which you get at a 1:1 ratio of make x-ing sandstone in your inventory. Now adding to that is that you are not guaranteed to get extra fine sand from the sandstone, it's chance based with heavier pieces having higher likelihood.
---
For normal players this is all well and good. They can throw their offers on the GE, buyout the however millions of sandstone that exist and have a market going so they aren't sold for 1 gp anymore. For iron accounts however they're now forced to mine upwards of 60-70K sandstone just to complete this one step because no consideration was taken in the design process to see how realistic it would be for a player to do everything themselves.
---
The creation process is certainly doable but it's nothing fun for the player, it's not engaging in the slightest since they're doing nothing except letting their inventory repeatedly fill and empty over the course of like 40-50 hours until they've reached this arbitrarily defined quota. I don't think every tedious grind should be made easier obviously but there are clear instances when consideration should be taken for how someone is going to approach something from the perspective of doing everything themselves, and even without ironmen this is something that every game should consider regardless.
---
If you were around when it was voted on and understood the reason Jagex proposed it in the first place you wouldn't be saying that. It was literally a reaction to a 2006-based private server that had over 200,000 registered players. People wanted 2006/2007 game and that's what they got. If you want HD cartoon graphics so bad why don't you campaign for a remake of that version instead of trying to ruin ours? Cretin
---
Accusing me of dickriding is how you cope?
---
Not an original method, but a satisfying one, I suppose.  Best of luck.
---
Incredible. Much wow

This.

Don't be afraid of jumping in and giving it a go once you watch this video. You'll learn what you need to work on after you try.

But you might want to solve that mouse double clicking issue lol
---
sure, if it's watermarked or credited to the OP. But on reddit that rarely happens and people get triggered when others get free invisible internet points off their efforts.
---
Thanks for the tip. Currently afking 99 ranged, 97 at the moment. Will try this!

haha true

Not going to buy a computer to simply play runescape....the cost outweighs the benefit.

But this subreddits logic is "yeah you said you didn't macro but you did so I don't believe you. Jamflex antibot is perfect there is a reason why!"
---
\~4045hrs (2min avg. kill)
---
Not blaming them for getting scammed. But when you pay for a service, customer support could be a part of what you pay for, just a thought. Can't see how that is a big job for someone at jagex to fix.
---
At the very least it will last longer than RS2 did before turning into RS3.

Not me lol, just amazed at how much time one can spend at Zulrah.
---
You just need to try more worlds. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work the first or even second time. Also make sure you‚Äôre closing the app between attempts.
---
Username checks out.
---
Edit - just decided to look through your posts and I don't wanna come across as mean. You are someone who needs help. I hope you get it and life gets better for you.
---
Coping with what? I don‚Äôt really give a shit if Rendi caused this or not, it didn‚Äôt really affect me. You‚Äôre the one REEEEing all over the sub.
---
What are these and yes please. Give us that fake quest
---
Your paycheck could net you bonds long time.
---
Not only that.
---
Rendi was part of it.
---
He participated in a coordinated effort with the people in his video. 
---
He was "cut" out of the loop and made the video out of spite/to make himself look good once he realized that someone was going to leak it.
---
He made himself look like a martyr with dramatic music and scenes like he was notifing jagex of something they didn't know about. 
---
Jagex already knew about it. You could say that by releasing a video publicly, rendi forced their hand.
---
As a couple of other people have said, at least you won‚Äôt fall for the same scam again.
---
It‚Äôs not worth quitting over though if you still enjoy the game. And in all honesty there is no chance you will ever see those items/gold again as I‚Äôm sure jagex feel they have bigger fish to fry with all the botting/RWT. 
---
I know how you feel though. I lost 10m (was a lot to me back then) to a pvp world bank lure scam and I was raging üòÇ
---
Btw what scam got you?
---
How is this "provided context" relevant to the situation at hand. Is the fact that every legit player makes their own GP so alien to you, that you feel the need to include the "I, the owner and sole player of the account have earned any and all of the profits on the account" like no shit
---
&gt; unless the bird fails
---
It can't iirc.
---
So the last several times there were sustained DDOS attacks were they also the result of duping bugs orrrr?
---
Definitely shouldn't use beta worlds with max stats and gear for practice in cases like this if you don't have those stats and gear in the live game. Set your stats down to what you have in the live game and use the gear you'd have access to to practice. Otherwise you're in for a surprise once you jump back into the live game and try the content out with lower stats and worse gear. 
---
Use the max stuff for fun.
---
"Alright Timmy, we need you to kill 241 men, women and children." "But Cosmo i can't do that.." "We weren't asking Timmy."
---
Lol well twitter has nothing to do with jamex they cant make these accounts illegal what are you talking about
---
People still getting scammed in 2019?  It's like you are giving free money to people in real life, then you want it back and you report it as a crime lol. Not jagex fault, its ur own stupidity. I'm sorry but thats how it is.  Happy rebuilding man, just don't repeat ur mistake, don't drop or trade ur items to anyone, dont go to wilderness or duel if someone asks you, simple as that
---
That is proof, the page has been up longer than rendi has been a youtube creator.  He talked about it on twitter.  Sorry I don't have time to look for a single tweet.
---
Wow so it‚Äôs actually even cheaper than what I said? Makes it even funnier.
---
I was inactive for 3 months a week after using my ducky. The first ban was 2 months into my absence, and the next two bans were this and last week. and banned for no cause, yes I broke no rules because I wasnt even playing the damn game
---
The people working on fixing the exploit still have to communicate with the jmods dealing with PR, otherwise they would have a situation where the information going out is not accurate. While I realize it seems like I'm saying they had to drop everything they were doing for damage control, I was mostly trying to overblow thfacte y couldn't entirely provide their undivided attention in a way the guy I was replying to would understand.
---
Shittiest poem I‚Äôve ever read
---
Because for someone to be hitting the server to the extent that they have been, they'd either need their own botnet of considerable size or they'd be paying to use someone else's, which really isn't cheap.
---
To be affecting the servers this much, we're not talking about some little skids here, it's people that know what they're doing and you best believe there is a very good incentive for them to be wasting time and money doing so.
---
Needs a ban on sight in addition to a perm tbh. He could still play rs in a new account but any attempt at creating content under his rendi persona should result in the account being banned instantly.
---
No wonder ur name is nerdvirgin
---
I mean they didn't make any statements till 5 days of DDOS attacks, what do you expect the community to think
---
If you‚Äôve already cashed in most of the membership, they probably won‚Äôt refund you at all, but they may offer you a refund on 1-2 months if you haven‚Äôt used all of it. I‚Äôve never had to ask for a refund, so I couldn‚Äôt say how successful you‚Äôd be.
---
I can't tell if you're being serious or not... i didn't say anything about a full refund first of all. Second, your coffee analogy doesn't apply here. We are talking about an ongoing service. Not a singular product. Third, people weren't lying when they were complaining about the inability to log in, server disconnects, and enormous lag they were experiencing. We'll file these 3 things under "service disruptions" as i mentioned before.
---
Let's continue shall we? It doesn't matter who's "fault" it was that the service was disrupted, only that it WAS disrupted. Your telling me that if your internet went down for 2 weeks that you wouldn't call your ISP and demand a credit to your account? What about your trash service? On average garbage collectors pick up your trash 4 times a month. Your telling me if they skipped all 4 days you would just leave a large pile of garbage outside your house and keep on paying? Come on..
---
Now onto the figures I stated. I never said everyone was experiencing interruptions, and I'm glad you didn't, but the fact is some players DID experience interruptions and that is simply unacceptable for any service organization.
---
I think that about covers it. I don't know the laws off the top of my head, but if you insist then I will happily get the books out and school you on the laws that govern service organizations.
---
Have a nice night!
---
This why the concept of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) exists. On that Wikipedia page is a list of high-profile vulnerabilities that were fixed as a result of responsible disclosure. You will also see that none of the examples were fixed within literally hours of the disclosure. Rendi's doesn't fit the bill, and was immensely irresponsible.

Got tanz mutagen at ~367 kc, at least you still have something to grind for! GL
---
But did they blow on it when they unplugged it..?
---
More like the OP threw their info at the obviously fake account. Not like he was soliciting info on the premise that he was a jagex employee.
---
1.83 / 24 hours = 0.076
---
0.076 * 7 = 0.532
---
Half life 3 confirmed
---
they might have known how to crash the servers but they may not have been aware of that you could dupe items doing that
---
Pretty much every keyboard has built in macros nowadays, you'd have to go out of your way to buy one that didn't
---
You got it chief!
---
If you flip a coin 100 times and the first 5 flips are heads, you're due for tails because after you finish all 100 coin flips, it will equalize around 50/50 odds. That anology is the same for duel arena winning/losing streaks. Win streak = due for losses, loss streak = due for wins. 
---
Why would it be considered 50/50 if a person can lose 30 in a row and not equalize by going on a winning streak afterwards, think.
---
"Sustained Malicious Attack"
---
Crashing the servers a week or so ago isn't a "Sustained Malicious Attack"
---
It was a DDoS. That is what a "Sustained Malicious Attack" is, just worded differently.
---
Found dabwoods' reddit account lol
---
It's linked in [this tweet.](https://twitter.com/OblivionPvm/status/1172165810909077504) You can also find it and other useful spreadsheets on the gear discord, invite code "gear".

Didn't he even say in the vid that the connection issues came as a consequence of the hotfix for the dupe?
---
OSRS runs off a cartridge?
---
Huh? I don‚Äôt think he RWTs now, I‚Äôm saying that he used to sell Inferno capes in the past. The accounts he had at that time were banned so he was punished for it (he said this on Twitter a whole back).
---
EDIT: to clarify, I‚Äôm a fan of Rendi and think the whole witch hunt on this sub is ridiculous.
---
Jagex wasn't bamboozled, they were duped.
---
That's just doing anything in the wildy for me
---
Rendis method was patched before he released the video you fucking smooth brain. Jesus
---
Literally that describes reddit completely. It's kind of sad, really.
---
Lmao what. 
---
You‚Äôre comparing lag and disconnections to people not picking up trash for weeks, then you say my analogy didn‚Äôt make sense. 
---
Go bring out your law book. They do not lawfully have to do shit for you just because the game was laggy lmao gtfo here.
---
&gt; because upper management doesn't see value in those positions.
---
They see value in not having those positions because they can just squeeze more out of their current employees.
---
Inb4 mods delete this
---
Downvote cuz didnt screenshot. I hope others do the same.
---
What does that mean?
---
As a deadman player it's my duty to mock Jagex. They've fucked up so many times and then fucked up handling their fuck-ups.
---
you need to get outside more
---
What‚Äôs a screenshot
---
April isn‚Äôt drama, it‚Äôs OSRS players being whiny
---
Looks like someone just bought some bonds
---
Heartbreak time. I‚Äôve only even gotten one skilling pet. Ready for this? Got a beaver at level 17 off on oak tree on my hardcore Ironman. Got so excited I miss clicked onto a varrock guard without noticing as I ran to grab my brother. We made it back just in time to see the guard slap me with a 3 and send me back to lumby. Empty handed and disgraced.
---
Tossed that account. Never playing Ironman again.
---
No this isn‚Äôt a fake story. I‚Äôm an idiot and I‚Äôll never forgive myself for this.
---
Whoever made sea shanty 2 has bars bruh
---
That's exactly how they did it in Rendi's video you spastic.
---
Hmm let's see, sells inferno capes, whine like a child when he doesn't win golden gnome, had a significant role in the dupe glitch
---
If they acctually did ban people and returned the money so the scammer didn't get anything except a ban, I don't think anyone with full elite void and lvl 126 would actually scam. But I have accepted the loss, canceled subscription on 3 accounts and uninstalled runelite already, so gonna move on.
---
Lotta threads around here do well to illustrate how little people know about running a software-based service.
---
My actual job entails handling a lot of issues adjacent to what Jagex deals with. I have a lot more patience for the actual server engineers tasked with fixing things and lot less patience for the people screaming for blood over it.
---
Sometimes shit breaks. If there were a big red button labeled, "fix the broken shit," I promise they would press it. Instead someone has to figure out how to make that button, then build the button, and then they can press it.
---
Ayyy thanks for taking my suggestion üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm so sorry
---
sub 50 minutes brother, not combat
---
I will! And shhh, I‚Äôm hunting for certain pay tables and low limits. That way I can build a profit over a few hours. It‚Äôs not about fun or quick money, it‚Äôs percentages, strategies and house edge. Hahahaha. I‚Äôll be on OSRS again all night though, lol
---
I‚Äôm at 73 and want to neck myself
---
u cant go below 1x on the keyboard itself lol best u can do is lower repeat rate in windows settings
---
Awesome!
---
It‚Äôs alright. Enjoy your beaver friend! congrats you! I‚Äôm sorry I realize I forgot to congratulate you instead making it about my own short comingsüòÖ
---
 Live for me. Protect it for me...
---
Except the antibot obviously saw this guy using multiple fresh accounts doing tutorial island and saw them as botting accounts, and has literally nothing in anyway shape of form to do with OP who has fully leveled accounts banned and never would have triggered the same criteria.
---
Just make $40.00/hr then lol. It's that easy.
---
Yeah I don't know why 34% voted for no, must have been some kiddos who never played rs before osrs
---
It has everything to do with profits. RuneScape is owned by a company, do you think they keep this game running because they like it? Companies don‚Äôt continue a product that doesn‚Äôt bring in money, if you really think they wouldn‚Äôt force an update that they think would increase their profits you‚Äôre ignorant. 
---
Again, I never said that repolling is bad. A second poll for an update that is virtually no different than the first poll is. We didn‚Äôt want it. You can‚Äôt speak positively of polling and completely ignore the downside of repolling just because they want it to pass. That‚Äôs not us having a say in the game, that‚Äôs us being forced into the update. 
---
Apparently I have to go more into depth on every single one of my points. I didn‚Äôt say QOL updates are bad. Them forcing the previously polled updates disguised as ‚ÄúQOL‚Äù updates is. 
---
I‚Äôm not at all detached from it, in fact you seem to have somehow misunderstood basically everything I said. I‚Äôm happy we have the right to vote and decline updates, I don‚Äôt like that they are commonly forced on us regardless of what we initially vote. EOC was an example. I don‚Äôt care what EOC is doing now. I don‚Äôt care that people joined EOC after OS was made. My point was that they majorly fucked up with EOC and that they don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake because they lost a shitload of money because of it. 
---
Don‚Äôt respond unless you comprehend what I‚Äôm saying. Because you literally tried to argue my own points against me.
---
Thanks man. I'll look for 1% and up.
---
Honestly. Imagine working a job with the level of criticism jagex takes. Like a million karens all trying to return something at once.
---
Probably the 39m plat tokens

Congratulations first firecape ever always feels good. What‚Äôs the next goal? Always look to the future ü§ôüèª
---
I mean, they should, but they shouldn't have to.
---
No I‚Äôm not take it back
---
I imagine that this is being written by some 6'2" 190 lb powerhouse Greek god-esque chad
---
Agreed. I'm having a great time with Leagues especially, and I think the game as a whole is going very well. I always know the team does what they can whenever something goes wrong, and my expectations have yet to be disappointed.
---
Thanks! Next major goal is Dragon Slayer 2. Not sure what to expect. All I know is the last fight is difficult.
---
Yeah man that's not a good attitude. This was your fault. Nobody elses. Either accept responsibility and build yourself back up or forever wallow and play the victim like the scammer wanted.
---
Oh now it looks cool
---
RIP. My friend got permed on his main (9 years old, rs3 slave) after taking a week break soon after switching to osrs.
---
His rsn was his login so maybe he was hacked?
---
edit: Hijacked and botted on, maybe this could've happened to you?
---
Scrolled to the bottom.
---
Was not dissapointed.
---
What's the joke
---
Good luck!
---
Don't. Mouth turns black and it tastes like swampy sawdust, a friend told me.
---
The promo ends in a couple days or so, but it was still a full month bots/alts/gold famers got to abuse 2 weeks free p2p.
---
Better yet... when attacked, you die instantly and all valuables in your bank get transferred to he who hath conquered you
---
Dude it's easy. Everytime it turns blue run to the other side.
---
What are you on about no proof? Just search "Rendi Infernal Cape" and his scythe forum page is the first result, with confirmation comments from this year. And one of his closest associates(bea5 i think is the persons name?) Said that rendi helped discover this dupe because he thought he could use it to complete quests without claiming the exp and get the lowest possible barrow gloves. And then the golden gnome thing was a shit show all around holy fuck how can any public figure think its ok to act like that?
---
I'm sure there's something to do with crabs here somewhere
---
Wtf is this sub lol
---
Obviously you aren't magically going to be compensated for membership by posting on Reddit, and expecting otherwise is silly. No Jmod is going to read this post and think "yeah, go ahead and compensate this person just because they asked" lmao
---
You really want to know the answer to your question? Use the support site... it's literally what it exists for.
---
How long did it take you
---
It is but you‚Äôll overcome! 
---
Gz on your first fire cape! I remember getting mine about a year ago, you‚Äôll slowly make progress and learn all the PvM mechanics. Good luck!!
---
You have to buy a new pc
---
Imagine having charges on your black mask still. Go kill some shit fam
---
Ima need context on that school bus, wtf happened
---
But what if you could use them on the serp helm??
---
Thanks!!
---
I like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally convulsing‚Äù
---
So, let me get this straight. You got banned previously for macro, then had three completely unrelated accounts get banned, randomly and for no reason?
---
This is the biggest crock of bullshit I've heard in my life.
---
Let him project - its cathartic
---
As far as I know the zammy spear is literally only good on corp beast, the hasta is better everywhere else
---
Why not a weapon for kq
---
Oh fuck off
---
Can you seriously help me please lol
---
This isnt' real
---
This is a pretty bold post with no proof
---
It‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm the friend, also his clan leader.
---
Oh I agree, I just assumed since he was replying with the same comment to the last guy he was doing it to mock him because the comment was dumb.
---
I did the exact same thing except you use the locator orb to kill your self after (on a pvp world) and just tele back from the bank. Instead of gear I took food as my extra items so that I could eat a few times and use the full inventory of bones. If less then 3 people where on me it made no difference at all. They have maybe 30 seconds if they‚Äôre waiting at the door for you, most of the time you end up still using the locator orb while getting pked because they just can‚Äôt kill you anywhere near that fast
---
And the account that died gets instant ban as well.
---
V nice!! 
---
I hit 70 earlier this week, I‚Äôm so close I can taste it lol. 
---
Same boat tho 72 agility, another small grind
---
i agree
---
Best way to train prayer honestly.
---
Only thing I'm worried about is a rollback
---
For a better tip 4 item with ely/bulwark, dhide top plus bottom and ds2 orb/enchanted symbol/enchanted key/rockcake. Deals more damage per tick.
---
Also unless ur a hcim, wildy activities are zero risk cept ma2 and even then the risk is tiny af. There is nothing to be scared of. Lose 100 d bones but save 15000 on your way? Stfu lmao
---
this is great
---
or learn to pk and kill people that have wealth ;)
---
Everybody is being so shitty about this, what happened to innocent until proven guilty? If OP wasn't convinced he was falsely banned he wouldn't have made the thread, get a grip some of you it's embarassing, impersonating a J-Mod just to try and fuck OP? WeirdChamp
---
Jagex just sucks as a business that cares about its customers, and I think people are tired of it. The mods/devs are great. The game and content is great. But the people leading the business just straight up suck
---
None of them were glitches, not sure what you are talking about.
---
Rates were either discontinued, or holiday items.
---
Phats came out of crackers which were spawned all over the place, the same as halloween masks, wants hats, easter eggs, and pumpkins.
---
Other items like disk or returning/ half jug of wine were tradable items that were discontinued with updates.
---
unless someone corrects me, I dont know of any rares that resulted from glitches.
---
(Its possible you are referring to the huge amounts of dupuing that happened in rsc, its why the pink phat want from the rarest/most expensive to the least expensive).
---
