Thank you so much :)

It hides the killcount then aswell

I got super excited when i realized its a good bank tp for that, then i remembered ima wear fcape all the time anyways

He spent a lot of time researching random events, drop tables, trekking efficiency, and clue juggling. He researched the engine related stuff that there really hasn't ever been a need for until now because why on earth would anyone grind random events or Morytania clues?
---
Yes it does.
---
Never help a beggar. 9/10 they’re an experienced player who’s too lazy to make their own money. 
---
Plant tree &gt; pay farmer &gt; cut tree once grown (or right click pay 200gp to remove).
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also try out fruit trees which are typically better xp/gp.  Once you unlock the farming guild things will really pick up.
---
Let's make it in Lovakengi

When you coming out with the complete guide?

Also I hear 2 tick crying is way more profitable.

You pay the farmer after you plant the sapling in the patch each time. Having them watch it ensures it wont die and grow fully. Depending on the cost of the protection payment and the tree while factoring in the disease rate will give you an idea whether its worth protecting. Generally it is and I would encourage it if youre learning. The payments can be given as notes so for willows each run take out your saplings and your noted basket of apples. You can pay 200gp to the farmer and they will clear the entire tree for you, which i again recommend as it saves time and most logs arent worth the effort to bank. If you chop the tree once its grown itll eventually leave a stump just like normal trees do. This will regrow just as other trees. Once it is a stump you can clear it completely with a spade and plant a new sapling to continue gaining farm xp.
---
Just FYI you misspelled grindiness in the intro
---
Clans are fantastic and it’s great to watch them in dmm
---
But these bosses they can probably do with little to no dmage taken anyways and i dont know i guess it could be good for P2 verzik but hard to use phase 3.

What is he using to see clue scroll locations??

Holy shit, I wish I could give you gold.

You might want to gander over to the left side of the picture.

Id love if OP is just paranoid and hasn't said anything serious

Yea this would be fun to get disconnected from

this is embarrassing as shit dude have some shame ..

Eat a decent meal before maxing please.

Honestly bonds are the only reason I play.

Yes my friend
---
I guess if you really don't want to spend any money that's fine. Idk how far you should take it. You can efficiently do members content from lvl 3, you're still spending a part of your life trying to get enjoyment out of the game. Might as well do it with the extra perks. 
---
This is why I'd never even bother with it.  My main isn't even max combat and it's already died 3 different times from disconnection - twice due to my own internet, and once due to Jagex's servers.  3 unavoidable deaths and it's only got 100m xp.  Fuck that.
---
herb runs aren't gold efficient or anything on a main lol
---
It depends how they ask imo 
---
Why are they crashing 
---
Smithing is such easy money for low levels now too, like in the time they spent begging for maybe a couple hundred K they could've just made rune arrowheads/dart tips, killed chickens, or my current favorite of making kwuarm incense sticks, all of those are well over 1mil an hour gp which is way more than they'll need till they hit level 80.
---
Do you think its possible to make it so my mouse automatically moves and picks up the herb off of the ground? I really dont enjoy playing this game the way its intended to be played and would rather not look away from my netflix show to pick up some silly leafs. thanks in advance
---
Nice
---
probably because it's international 
---
No, that's actually exactly how it works. It's approximately a 300 hour grind to 99 rc doing bloods and then souls. If you do lavas, the grind is slightly more than half of that. You would save nearly 150 hours by doing lavas, and even with a shitty money making method, spending those 150 hours doing nearly anything else will make you more profit than doing it slow with bloods. This isn't just an opinion, this is fact. Numbers don't lie. However, I did not suggest lavas to OP because it is clear that he wanted to do rc afk. As for souls being less afk, they are *barely* less afk. It's still the same process. I would know. 99 rc btw. My advice for you is to take some time to learn about the concept of time cost though. Just because you don't believe it doesn't mean it's not the truth. 
---
Patience. Personally farming was a big help, after 99 agility, farming became my favorite skill, because it's extremely helpful to break the monotony. On top of that a herb run every 80 minutes will end up making you a nice cash stack and a decent amount of XP.

Good 'ol prison wallet
---
There's definitely a place for clans. They can go and fight over the wealth of resources in the wilderness, where the multizones would be unlimited.
---
1. Sort of. New methods have have come out and people have learned a lot so in general I think XP rates have increased.
---
2. 75 range for a blowpipe. It's just so good.
---
3. Imo yes, it's worth it getting membership early. You can skip a lot of early levels through quests.
---
4. Depends on what you're doing but generally yes. 
---
5. It's pretty much always easy to make enough money for your level. It can be hard to make money for the best stuff at your level though. There are some things you can do early on that make good money though. If you get a coal bag, ice gloves, and 30 smithing you can do blast furnace making steel bars and make like 300k+ per hour pretty easily. I'd recommend taking a look at the [wiki money making guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide). It does use theoretical values though so  don't expect to make as much as they say.
---
6. Not really
---
7. Depends how you do it. I'm mostly training range through Slayer and Vorkath so I'm making a lot.
---
There's a WC guild?
---
Some shit has Buy limits I once needed a fuckton of runes and was willing to pay 2gp over market value each and people still flamed me lmao I was like fuck I just need 50k law runes
---
Hey OP, I realise you're going more for research style but for a thesis you generally want a title page leading into contents and the like as it's going to be a large file normally. Although maybe you have a heavily restricted word count.    
---
Also, an abstract should be a general summary of the work, including the results. Typically you want to write this last.

Of course, I also plan to buy a bottle of wine to celebrate it. Currently 121 XP away from 99 firemaking. Not maxing until the big party.

Mobile users obtain a number pad pop up. Our letters "k,m,b" are tappable. 
---
Its a fucking chore.
---
I've had some newbies ask me for armor. Typically I'll oblige them, on the condition they come with me and watch me smith it. It's actually been pretty nice chatting with some of them and teaching them how they can be self sufficient in the future.
---
That doesn't make money anymore sadly:(
---
W/e. The point still remains.
---
It seems when you dont play you get hacked, very weird
---
You’re being very naive to the world of online marketing. Flat shipping rates are a dead give away the seller is pocketing that cost. He pockets £20 and the actual cost of printing in China and shipping from China is less than £0.50 especially after larger quantities. Get real
---
he already died during haunted mine

Anyone elses parents wouodnt becsuse they were paranoid to use their credit card online?

&gt; Unless there's a way to stay logged in on mobile for 15mins after locking my phone etc?
---
Yeah, don't do that. Just do what you're already doing, it's perfectly fine.
---
10/10 he’s flipping items for GP and controlling the GE
---
I think it's because it's less "efficient".  Stock prices for super large companies/commodity have thousands of people buying/selling, basically all data points for what the price should be.  They are all trying to game the market, all trying to predict the value of the company/commodity (selling if they think it's higher than it should be and they have it, buying if the opposite is true).  It's probably just less refined on here.  That's my guess.
---
what. lol okay then I guess I'm just not paying attention
---
It scales on both
---
You're a what? The first comment made no sense, even if it was a joke. The other guy is right, you have no understanding of networks.

1. Have flawless Internet connection to most servers

2. Only get disconnected from RuneScape when their servers die

Ill take that too

Yeah, we dont want a rs3 max cape mass nerf on our hands.

Far out!

Just+4 str bonus usually isn't worth the price for noobs

I hope when you go to alch your next rune drop you misclick and alch yourself.

Your on a college campus, which probably has a trunk from the local ISP, along with a priority network.

Get out of here and go back to theory because you have zero knowledge in this discussion.

it's real now lul
---
They are referring to crafting blood runes, which is a very afk albeit MUCH slower alternative method to train runecraft above 77. 
---
I did lavas for one invo, misclicked twice and made fires instead, 14 actuall lavas, and vowed never to do it again.
---
Graceful effect isn't useful there because it only applies when walking or standing still. If you're in an animation, like crafting a rune,  then you aren't restoring energy anyway.
---
This. I was at cave crawlers the other day and had no problem giving the guy the rest of my antipoison pot as I left. He had forgotten one and asked. And I know that feel.
---
But if someone walked up to me in the GE and asked for one, I'd be annoyed as hell. They're literally chump change. Be a big boy and pickpocket men for 5 minutes.
---
What a chad 
---
crafting guild if you wanna be a basic bitch. GE if you wanna laugh at retards. 
---
Dude chill, he's just proposing a harmless teleport  in addition to the current perk. I know you're just baiting people into calling the smithing cape perk bad so you can flex your 2 mil post 99 smithing xp but still.
---
Implying that r/2007scape doesn't have a 10,000 hour maxed player keeping a closer eye on him 24/7 than the FBI and NSA do on your browsing history...

Not for diary
---
7 quest points or 24h are the requirements.
---
Fucking furrys
---
Exactly what he said. Tbow+kodai number 1 priorities, then anguish+suffering, then pegs. After that arma+ancest.
---
Mine was as well, my original account that had an actual username instead of an email.
---
I immediately started playing on another acc I had, just to be sure it doesn't get hacked again, since I had an authenticator and recovery questions and that didn't matter at all, since IIRC I got caught from a leak.

Burn with me!

I thought you had to have at least one jad kc to do it as a Slayer task. Guess I was wrong tho
---
Alright, guess I just haven't done enough grinding yet :D Thank you!

i did that during my entire grind because i don't take handouts.
---
Let's be real the only mains going to bf post 99 are the ones going for ranks/200m
---
Left: Dad
---
Right: Mom
---
Mann those double exp streams are effective 
---
Isn’t efficiency in runescape measured in xp/hr? Not what your total level is. 
---
So you want 2 skillcape perks now? Thats a new one for sure.
---
&gt; I know you're just baiting people into calling the smithing cape perk
---
The current smithing cape perk is insane. I think you need to go back and read:
---
&gt; If so, thats a huge nerf to an insane perk
---
Sample size too small 
---
Oh cool, I like AFK sometimes. Are there any other cool training methods like that? I abandoned my main for my 'side chick' of an Ironman so I would like to train it, but I don't want to/it's not really feasible to train on lava runes. My plan was to just craft cosmics till I could craft nats, then nats till laws. Is there a better way?
---
Git gud at zulrah lol you play runescape u can definitely figure it out
---
My friend and I used to farm these and make a fortune when OSRS first came out.
---
Pro tip:  If one person gets one and both people dig at the same time you'll both receive one.
---
should have saved those for warding.
---
It’s hard to talk about efficiency without coming off as snobby, since efficiency is a snobby concept. You pretty much said “herb runs aren’t bad, but if you only care about maximum efficiency, they’re not worth doing, here’s why”, which isn’t wrong. You weren’t an asshole about it either, so no reason to delete the post.
---
100 billion 
---
Umm seriously no jar?
---
progress to the fun part where u dont afk and actually play
---

---
common af pet
---
It's only slower than combination runes and ZMI running. Still faster than doing normal runes. 
---
Do you guys do raids?
---
I'm just very curious, I promise I won't give feedback if you don't desire it
---
&gt;That's a new one for sure
---
Farming cape exists
---
For the rest of the comment you interpreted what I said so bad I'm not even gonna respond to it
---
Pretty much
---
Still, the less data about my account available online, the better.
---
Iirc you use about 16k in 8 hours . So figure your exp per hour and how much you need and do the math on it . 
---
I don't think it is so much that most players are efficient, but most vocal players. The majority of players don't really care much about the game or updates and just play the game. But the ones who do put more into the game are usual the ones who care more about the game and give feedback on updates. And efficiency players put in more per hour, as is the nature of efficiency, so they can be louder as a result.
---
What does this have to do with customer support?
---
fuck the starving ironmen in mortyania
---
I thought Bob was secretly Zaros 
---
"Farming Cape now teleports you to the Farming Guild while also providing an Herb farming boost".
---
Yes that set enough precedent to consider adding a secondary perk feature that is nearly harmless.
---
Maybe he on vacation yo
---
Not cosistently. I've played for alonger in straight runs lots of times.
---
Those requirements are right. Talk to Hans at lumbridge castle to find out your account age.
---
Also the quest point requirement is pretty easy to hit. Romeo and Juliet will give you 5, then you only need 2 more
---
+0 str bonus for 20m nice
---
You got banned probably due to something you did on OSRS, nothing to do with runescape.
---
Btw here, I do this if I don't need the supplies. Drop people seeds all the time for farming contracts and gave some noob at trolls 8 bwans and 2 dose sup atk/str when I finished.
---
dragon cane
---
Nice dude! I did it yesterday aswell, the fireballs hit so hard!

Who said we're replacing anything.  And there's already a Farming Guild teleport through the Skill's Necklace but the OSRS team added it to the Farming Cape anyways.

---
Say the joke bro. Or are you scared?
---
nah its more like if ur username is also ur reddit username like OP i bet its been used elsewhere.
---
Any idea of the minimum stats required? I’ve looked at guides but want to ask the community. I know range is preferred I have 63 range and 61 defense. What is the minimum to have a realistic chance 
---
I feel this more and more. Confining myself on the weekends to cannon my range / string jewerly my magic and train my strength by doing Organized Crime just to PVP in a combat bracket that I don't even think I want to be apart of is killing me. 
---
Yes your build would be fine in pvp but tbh max piety (if you have claw) are way bigger money makers. Fighting maxed zerks/tanks who risk more than the maxed pures you'll run into. Especially if you get into brid fights.
---
I have a almost maxed piety 60-92-75-99-77-99 with infernal cape and he hits hard. He's my main after I retired my 99-99-45-99-85-99 clanning zerk with 2k+ total. 
---
Will be a breeze with arclight
---
Solid advice, much love for the help. The sharks would be so nice for jad, didn’t think of that 
---
They mean that they play osrs religiously but only log into rs3 occasionally. 
---
Im here to help, you just have to keep your dick in your pants one day at a time.
---
Oh no really? I've had them for a week now and havent seen any signs of that. I'm sorry to hear. How long ago did you have them ?
---
Do you PVE on your piety at all? 
---
This makes me uncomfortable 
---
With tears of guthix and lava runes it really isnt that many hours for 77. People are just too lazy to do either. 
---
I have both and use the bcp way way more... 
---
That defense bonus.....
---
First person is fine for this field and audience. Saying “a model was developed” is passive tense and weak writing when you could say the same thing in the first person, active tense.
---
Elite diaries. Been bossing on and off just to mix up the grind.. actually looking forward to RC more than I am slayer
---
Sharing all the world
---
This but you say brb 
---
SPOILERS!!!!
---
My guess is he used all items in the game in a time series structure with some other independent variables such as high alchemy Price, difference between HA price and GE price, amount purchased in a day, etc... This should allow one to understand some auto correlations between the data, but the predictive value should be low 
---
When my friend got members for first time he realized it meant you could play on members world and not that all worlds worked for the members content.
---
Making his daily yew run right after the birdhouse run. 
---
Finally someone speaking some truth lol some of the skillcape perks are already OP and don't need to be buffed.
---
Thank you 
---
Depends. If I've actively playing I don't allow myself to spend any go until I have a bond in reserve for membership always.
---
I'll have to work towards them with an alt killing gargs or something to have multiple membership accounts though.
---
I see these nearly every time I log in. There’s usually a “legit” player hanging around them encouraging others to have a go, and gambling themselves. Is there a cc I can idle in to notify a mod? These, along with the YouTube “giveaway” ads are a parasite on this game that need to go.
---
Imagine getting so upset by jokes from a random cunt on the internet that you want them banned from the game. Seriously why even implement the tools required for dealing with the situation (ignore, mute) if you’re going to hand out the band because someone got their feelings hurt?
---
Not asking for free speech inside of the game mr straw man just common sense. Perma mute stops them from speaking forever while keeping them playing and paying, objectively the best situation for everybody yet they’re banned. Doesn’t take 200iq to see why it’s retarded. 
---
Get 75 if you don’t have experience with it, it’s definitely doable with lower but a blowpipe will make it much much easier
---
Essactly
---
Go to Options &gt; Advanced options &gt; Side-panels...
---
I’ve been using the spawn on 62 to help, the last time I tried it I got pretty close, the healers fucked me though
---
Its low quality bloopers like these that make me feel ashamed of playing osrs 
---
Buffs in this kind of game have to be of three types.  Improvements in QoL that tend to fuel and augment something (Crafting Cape giving the best bank teleport as an example and is used in skilling to good effect), xph or gph.  If it does none of the above, it's not really a buff, just a feature.  A feature addition isn't a buff.
---
I hope you realize that the perk is worthless without the context of Blast Furnace.  That's the saddest part of your argument as smithing gold is purely a "wear this one item" situation if you talk of smithing it outside of Blast Furnace.  The context of the perk only fits well with the design of Blast Furnace itself since the method involves a gloves switch with the ice glove cooling issue that the cape provides a QoL improvement with use.
---
Like the more I talk to you, you just run off into a completely lateral tangent and try to get more ground off it.  Yet it's hilarious how you can't even think on the same level of Jagex's actual game design that you want to contest the Smithing Cape's purpose outside of Blast Furnace to be contrarian.
---
Take it up with Jagex overall if you find this type of suggestion bad.    It is in line with the current game and has been for some time now.  Going against it is trying to contest literally most of OSRS's game improvements or additions, not me.
---
Implement a ban on chatting outside of quickchat until you get so many questions points. Idk 
---
So maybe 70 for a noob is doable? 70-75 is a grind 😫
---
More like “I have to spend 4 hours moving my cynos around to do a jf run, hold up, let me check my spreadsheets I spent 10 hours creating to make sure I have everything, oh also i need to bring 1500 units of LO for the third cyno, oh, and let me run a comparison check on profit margins for my remaining 10k m3 of cargo space, also, shit a neut popped my cyno, so i need to resupply that and spend 15 more jumps reaching it with my alt REEEEEEEEEDE
---
Did you try to predict specific values rather than a binary classification of positive or negative in magnitude? What was your accuracy? What was your network archeticture? CNN?

I'm just around your area in progression as well!

He needs to train str anyway, which will help with all future item hunts including abby whip anyway

And when he went back to swampletics there would be an icon that shows that his name was changed

He’s been pretty honest about when he leaves so far.

Yeah on the runescape merch store

First off tell your friend to stop clicking on sketchy links. Chances are they're aren't hot single women in their area waiting to meet. Or tell them to quit downloading porn or both the former and latter of what I mentioned.
---
Second have your friend download the free trial of Malwarebytes or download it for them and put it on a USB, then go and install it on the computer and run the malware scan to remove the Trojans. 
---
Fighting Gloves and Fancy Gloves. Sounds good to me.

I like to pk a lot and highrisk,  never done pvm

Assuming you go with oak planks, then (assuming I'm doing the math right) between the cost of planks and paying the demon butler, you're probably looking at somewhere between 19 and 19.5m. It's a lot of gold to spend, but as someone with most of the important stuff in his house, it's worth every coin.

I'm sure you're fine if you can't even get into your own email.

That being said, you should work on that. It's just a matter of time before your lack of access fucks you over. Hopefully soon Jagex will have a proper customer support and they'll be able to help you change it.

(what we should say on rs instead something gave us aids)

I'm a pile guy,
---
Gonna pass on that one chief. Leave the transmogs in RS3.
---
It'd be sad, sure, but what do you expect to happen if you break a rule, even if it's just to do something dumb?
---
Yeah definitely not as much as it used to be, but it’s still super easy to buy 1k flax and make 50k lol
---
Skulled revs

It's a cave with a bunch of spots for sandcrabs. Usually clear of bots or Venezuelans since its locked by a quest, but the quest is easy enough to complete
---
Why do skillcapes have to have teleports at all? They're op
---
Lol, life is tough out here
---
Upvote for Rs2
---
Say goodbye to your acc, who's maxing now
---
okay but why does it matter that the wilderness skulls you if you lose your items on death regardless?
---
Dynamite was like 700ea when I did it I think. I sold my ores so often it’s tough to say. Maybe 20m for like 5m xp? Could be way off
---
I don't think it's a bug related to scale size it's just that the points indicator doesn't deduct from your personal points on deaths unless you personally die, even though it does deduct from the total points. This can create a discrepancy when people are dying with very few points in the first place since those deaths will deduct from other people's earned points.
---
&gt;how am I passive aggressive?
---
You should also learn what a straw man is mate
---
I’m not butt hurt either, just trying to have a discussion but leave it to the guy concerned about hurt feelings to project. Whatever dude you’re being a dick and you know it. My thought process went; break social rule, remove social feature. Not hard to understand but if you want to continue to put your spin on it knock yourself out. 
---
Imps are understandable because you have to actually do something to get the exp. I'll drop a shark In a heart beat for a lamp though.
---
Awaiting Jmod smackdown
---
I don't get it. I want to get it though.

It's a free rc run though lol.

you're surprised edgy teenagers are being edgy on the internet?

It’s a fucking thesis, I’m sure anyone writing a thesis would be very thankful for anyone showing them where they might have made a mistake.
---
Well yeah you have like 8 other accounts to interact with
---
Jagex needs to ban those flax spinning bots lol. Bow strings hit 200gp or something crazy a couple weeks/months ago
---
This picture has to be a joke.
---
Yeah but bow strings cost 53 gp now 
---
How much for a bond? And yeah I want to after I get all of my skills up to where I can be more competitive in pking and when I understand everything a little more.
---
i didnt know 2007scape was the only subreddit was on reddit!
---
Mainly to avoid skull tricking. 
---
Maximum 990 xp is big for free. But you wouldnt know anything about that.
---
I might have to steal dehydrated vegetable head. That's a damn good insult right there.
---
You wrote in the introduction that OSRS came out 2014 in a 2013 vote.. except it was voted for in 2012 and release February 13th 2013. Just a heads-up.
---
Thank you for the clarification. I think it could be worded slightly better, perhaps?
---
From the moment the seed is planted, the Kronos plant provides a chance for farming patches to skip a growth interval whenever it advances a growth stage. This chance is shared between all farming patches of that growth interval, meaning that when a 20 minute growth interval is skipped, all farming patches which share that interval will skip one.
---
For example, if a 640 minute growth interval is skipped, all farming patches on that growth interval (hardwood trees, redwood trees, hespori) will skip a growth stage. The Anima patch is exempt from having it's intervals skipped.
---
Something alone that lines that makes it clear it can affect any and all patches, and exactly how it works?  
---
Other peoples points are irrelevant.  If you solo a raid for 22k points you have roughly a 3% chance at an item.  If you FFA a raid and get 22k points and your team gets 220k points your team has a 30% chance of getting an item and you have a 10% chance of getting it...which is a 3% chance.  Don't worry about other people.
---
noobs. idc about getting a d2h off the ground, it's the principle of preserving the noob experience. my bank is 1500m, the drop party aint for me, im fighting for the noobs, which there are a lot of now. it was dumb seeing mobile players lose loot to cheaters
---
Someone explain this? I don’t understand that youths anymore 
---
&gt;and then you get slammed hard.
---
Just like the content of his joke.
---
i was the one hosting the drop party, my bank is 1500m, dont reply idiot ROFL
---
*necks self*
---
Nah man they downvoted you because they didn't like your response, not over some subjective objective bullshit. You can believe what you want but it was because you did not gel well with the vibe. Not staying wrong or right but they did not appreciate your response.
---
My isp has a funny thing they do where they like to randomly shut off my internet for 15-20 minutes a couple times a week anywhere between 1-4am.
---
  
---
Ty Comcast for not even letting me get the false hope that I'd ever get a hardcore to a decent spot. So much time and heartache saved!
---
Yeah, but because this is a repost
---
yes, clearly someone like you with the name "mlg pussy slayer", has a 1.5b bank, and cries on reddit about telegrabbing and runelite.
---
thats riiight, we were talking about end game money making not slayer tasks for mid levels -.-
---
There are usually summer and winter deals I believe. I buy like 6-12 months with bonds for a lot less than it normally cost 
---
Do you need every challange scroll? Thought you just need to fight one of them to get in the arena and unlock the music? 
---
100% upgrading a house is absolutely the way to go. After that I would go for either a torture or anguish 
---
No yeah I get that my comment being super Blunt compared to the tone. But literally the next comment after mine was "fun is subjective little man" as if me expressing that it's not fun was some breach of the subjectivity of fun lol. Its just such an irrelevant thing to respond to my comment with yet it spawned a rather large conversation full of illogical bs
---
LOL no it doesnt, its still based on pid. You brag about having a 1.5b bank, yet you cry about runelite plugins? ok bud
---

Sand... CRABS? 🦀🦀🦀
---
I’ve gotten some good stuff from random GE drop parties too
---
The only thing I've found about it was saying that the game client itself is so scuffed that it breaks sometime after 6 hours but forcing a relog still doesn't make sense. If it was to make sure no-one stays logged in forever then an inactivity timer would be better as I don't think there's anything you could do forever with no inputs.
---
No. That’d be easy scape. 
---
Why does Wolf bring up Brexxit in some way or another on a weekly basis? We get it you don't like it, but your country voted in favor of it, stop Shoe-horning politics, please.
---
no point justifying it in gp/hr, the amount of time you have to gear and get to the location almost equals the time to do a herb run
---
Grow up and get over it

Did you mean Virgin island? :P

Well, I just started, we'll see how this goes.

I thought the shrimps were set to Auto-Burn?

Sure, but that's by necessity since you can't resoawn in mory. Also he goes straight back and does nothing on the way.
---
I can't remember the last time he died either.
---
That would be quite cool but I would kinda prefer for the gloves to come with Stronghold of Player Safety, aka Cockroach dungeon.
---
it won't pass and u can't bank those lamps
---
Sounds similar to artisans workshop from the old rs2 days but with a nice twist to it. I like the sound of it a lot!
---
Cooking is one of those skills I’ve been interested in trying to max. But whenever I play in my head I think “why am I doing non-combat skills”

I believe so, I haven't looked at RS3 for a long time.

Some specific examples would be battlefront 2 and battlefield V. The first one became a pretty fun game after they tweaked the lootbox jazz or whatever was the problem, and battlefield V had a problem with the gun damage which changed how the entire game felt. The point is these games don't make nearly as much money as osrs (I'm guessing), yet they're 1000x higher quality than osrs (not saying it's better btw), and they had their problems corrected fairly quickly after their fan protested. 
---
I'm not saying these games are better, or that the dev team is bad. I'm just pointing out that we give Jagex so much leeway when they give osrs such abysmal attention. If you want a better comparison then look at RS3. A much higher quality game that's complete shit because of all the cash grab. You should really be asking "why can't osrs get the same amount of attention as rs3?"
---

Go to Zanaris and find the chicken statue. Use a raw chicken on it and you’ll be teleported there.

---

---
i find it strange that you said "racist/illegal" as if someone talking about illegal stuff like child porn or shooting a school is on the same level as discriminating a race. what a weird culture we live in
---
If you're in close range, yes he'll hit you. Just rag healers one by one. Or, if you're hella geared  just out dps the healers lol 
---
Iced out mutagen
---
Because your a wizard Harry 
---
As long as you're not in melee distance he will not melee you or otherwise approach to do so. Do you know how to determine where he'll spawn? Because that is also extremely helpful.
---
The default character looks a bit like Heisenberg 
---
Yep I boss, slay, etc on it. Only downside is you use more ppots for piety, but with the defense, I get way way more boss kills a trip compared to the zerk and use overall less supplies while outputting similar dps. Overall it's my favorite build as a main type acc while retaining the pvp capability of a lower bracket than flat out 126.
---
For those who were also around at the complete shit show of a content launch Zeah was, i gotta say, where it is today is fucking incredible. Still plenty of work to be done and it's amazing that they are steadily reworking the areas and more content and quests to come. Give it another year or two and i see Zeah being near perfect content and lore wise.

Do you not watch Swampletics? You could easily get more than 5 a day by forcing random events. I'll see if I can find the posts where people have got 99HP and 99 Slayer purely from lamping without any other skills

---
People do it because it’s a crazy money maker. Go rates over a mil an hour. 
---
I think it’s a dumb way to play the game but it has been proven over and over again to be effective. 
---
Its not really. If you play 1 hour a day semi-efficiently since release, you are in the top 5000 of players, out of over a million. Theres maybe 100-200 people who play a lot in an efficient way.

&gt;12,000 word dissertation
---
Genuinely curious here, when you say "dissertation", what exactly do you mean? I'm writing my thesis now, I'm at about 10k words (excluding two fuck-huge tables) and I'm not even halfway to the minimum number of characters needed.
---
I guess that’s good in a way, has it been acknowledged anywhere? Just haven’t seen it mentioned nor many results on google
---
Had a guy begging for 24 bones the other day by the willow trees in draynor.. 
---
Like go kill some chickens u absolutely lazy fuck
---
And secondly, nobodies going to have a bank full of normal bones because they are not an absolute scrub
---
You just used up all your RNG.
---
I wish a lot of the content from RSHD was re-introduced to OSRS.
---
Stuff like Safety Stronghold and Clan Camp was a lot of fun.
---
That ring wasn’t the only thing you rubbed
---
Yeah, but as somehow who's personally had a fair few botting bans (yeah I'm lame, it was a while ago and then all got promptly banned) the message it displays is different, and they still don't show evidence. If you follow that link I attached to my message it seems to imply that there was something shady going on. The only other explanation is that this case is similar to one I heard of a while back wherein someone typed something along the lines of 'why is gold ors smaller than the other ores' and the game flagged them for 'rs smalls' a common gold trading site, and they got this ban. That was a really shitty example but I can't remember what the guy actually typed, it made sense in context. Anyways, that's unlikely to be what happened here (but still not impossible) as Jagex said they fixed the error causing that... 
---
And the first wc 99 was done on normal trees around lumbridge. Now that was an accomplishment, these oak trees made it way too easy.
---
Impressive lol 
---
It's called being mentally challenged.
---
That 5 mins is 3 zulrah kills though
---
Swampletics could've eaten that lamp.
---
No they couldn't, you can see the dag bones, there's no way to hide just part of a stack of items. Using brain is hard.
---
That account is perfect for Zulrah. 
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
LOL
---
Not oldschool enough for my taste
---
Agreed.
---
The game started looking a lot more fleshed out. "Cities" that only had like 3 buildings were finally looking like proper cities (e.g. Lumbridge). 
---
New skills (Summoning &amp; Dungeoneering) and were a lot more interactive and were so rewarding as they unlocked so much content at each milestone level.
---
That's interesting, I haven't actually tried this on PC. I'll leave it for over 20mins a few times and see what happens.
---
Just buy loads of the item before price rises
---
Why does the game look so good graphic wise ? Any settings
---
Jagex was a bit SJW in 2007 for muting. I got muted for stupid stuff also back then. 
---
One of the major points when ironman game modes were introduced was that Jagex stated they would not make game changes to accomodate the new game mode (unless they were related to bugs or things that shouldn't be in game (ie the new dwarf cannon update)). Regardless of how the community feels about this, unfortunately it seems very very unlikely that Jagex would do something like this. 
---
What? Are you saying the 6 hour log isn't consistent? Because it is. Literally EXACTLY 6 hours after logging in, you're kicked off, even in the middle of combat. Every single time. You just use the world hopper if it doesn't happen to you, because it's not inconsistent, it's literally 100% consistent. 6:00:00 exaclty, not 1 second more, you're kicked off.
---
Everyone on here is talking about how they used pay by phone method or buying a prepaid card.
---
I grew up with my grandparents. They didn’t want to do any of it. Any legit company would accept a check in their minds. So we’d choose the pay by cash option. My grandparents would write a check out for the exact amount and then we’d mail it via snail mail to the U.K. from the US.

---
If you do 24% or whatever more damage that rigour gives then that is 24% faster in theory. Also you can use it with any ranged weapon. From everything I've seen the rigour &gt; everything else. 
---
I’d use my pocket money to get those gift cards for Club Penguin, then later on RuneScape. It’s amazing how well versed I was with computers and redeeming shit when computing was relatively new to households. Meanwhile my parents were so computer illiterate, my mum still is. When WoW came out when I was 13, that’s when my dad payed for that subscription. Was wise enough never ask my mum.
---
HD toggle would essentially require a full rewrite of every model and animation in the game
---
Context?
---
Not tried it myself but seen my friend do it and seems to work, I think once you agrro them they stop healing, even if theyre stuck behind him but dont hold me to that. I think the idea is you just chuck a couple chins at jad and it should hit all the healers. IF they do heal while stuck behind him theyll be aggressive to you so you could just run to the side a bit and they should come for you. 
---
Showing your spec energy? Lol kid thanks for the account

---
Long story short, mika had died in fally before everyone got teleported into the 1v1s. he tried to tell jagex he died due to the glitch even tho he died beforehand. he got caught, then tried to tell everyone it was an april fools joke
---
Is that Walter White?
---
Me too lmao, back then I didn’t care about xp, I don’t think any of us did. I remember chopping magics at the wizards tower when I just hit level 75wc, and getting excited every time I got a magic log every 2 mins.
---
It isn't going to make them go away but the GE is a lot less of an eye sore if you go to a total level requirement world. You really won't see any of these anymore

Yo. Just wanna say thank you. I played Barb assault for the first time yesterday to grind my torso and I had someone like you on my team. After dropping out points to 0 for the first 2 rounds he said hold up and gave me a big breakdown for my role and we even killed the queen. Appreciate the non flaming.

SOS is a name for cocaine where I live, you could change your restriction to that

Your friend wants to hide your psychological issues?

What do you mean by “one drop”? Like, going all the way to 99 without getting distracted and training other skills?
---
I've been looking for something like this it looks perfect :D
---
I know you've replied a ton but I'm curious. To my knowledge, most economics and economic theories are based off the fact that there are a limited number of supplies. In RuneScape this really isn't the case, at best it's infinite barring a time gate. Do you or how do you address that. 
---
Wonder you can only teleport to the red chin area 5 times per day, the black one makes sense obviously but they should have added an unlimited use for red.

Nightmare zone 95+ range and use dragon darts with rogor. You should be able to outhit healers. Same deal with tbow.

---
Because everywhere else in the world we use that word and no one cares because it is a real word. But classic USAliens always get up in arms because they think it attacks them
---
If you have 90+ range, are on a slayer task and have rigour you can just attack jad with blowpipe and you'll easily out dps the healers. Quite high requirements tho lol
---
I use mine for rev caves since it saves a lot on the teleport scrolls and only takes ~10 seconds longer, and wildy clues. I would say it’s only really worth it if you do wildy hard diaries tho.
---
Defensive stats are pretty much worthless in this game. Bcp is objectively a waste of money for 95% of the game's content. It does look cool though

I found say it out loud helped immensely. Removed double-guessing myself and let me keep calm. You'll do it dude!
---
Please post a link to the full thing at some point. Probably after it’s finished and marked to avoid any risk.

I said people generally play games for fun, not to be told how to play, which was in response to a guy saying he overwhelmed his friend.
---
I did not say you can't have fun without wikis. When I play a brand new game that's big and exciting and there's so much to do I want to explore and learn through experience, not have that taken away from me by some 3rd party and judging from the other responses on this thread I am not alone. Sure you may be different and that's ok, you do what makes you happy. Accept that people aren't the same as you.

If you can, you’ll save a bunch of money doing mythical cape racks.  Requires DS2 though, so if you feel like you can do that first it’s worth it.  Otherwise, I’d still spend the 19M, and also keep in mind it’s going to cost a lot more money to actually get all the good stuff in your house

If I had to guess, tob. A lot more people learning how to / farming ToB, you don't bring any stams in typically, but always buy one for Verzik and normally only use 1-2 douses. This means tons of stamina potions are entering the game without the use of amylase crystals.

Also it means less people are doing CoX, where you bring in 1-3 stamina potions for each raid (which is where I'd imagine the majority of stamina pots were being used, not counting low/mid level accounts questing)
---
It is useful!
---
and this is why no skill will ever pass... all you idiots just want your skill rather than voting on each proposed skill on its own merits.

Watch out for that rat. He’s got his eye on you.

No, he plays all the accounts at the same time. There is a video he posted from where he was banned for botting  and he showed how he did it and all of his accounts were unbanned.

Our runescape goals are worth something, though. Completely different

You should only be eligible for boss pet rolls when you beat your PB tbh
---
Because Master Pineapple has been buying them in advance. He’s playing the long game. 
---
It baffles me that a 14hr shift is legal.
---
It was a silly name for them, they should have been fighting gloves but Jagex felt compelled to name them after the content they come from (Stronghold of Player Safety) so that's what we got.

Spikes might help to keep you safe if you use them to impale your enemies though?

It's just not as big a deal as people think it is. Authenticator on the website is needed far more considering so many hacks are simply recoveries. Of course both are ideal, just the website authenticator is more important.
---
seconded

Yeah the "RSHD" era was the shit!
---
Shift click each item
---
Started staking and I wonder now why 90% of them are bots? Doesn't make sense, and if they are owned by different people, why wouldnt they stake eachother?
---
Another thing is people just letting you get in a free hit?
---
Authenticator on the website would surely be a better option

No fucking shit. It would be some dumbass spaghetti code if that were true

Atleast Tree fiddy

Well ye, nieve is the same as hatius cosaintus, just an eyesore stick in the middle of a nostalgic area that she has no purpose being in, and also has no lore related to her. Bob has years worth of lore, and fits thematically into the game.
---
Only 990? 'Finally over' gtfo
---
Raids of that size are almost always ffa

I'd say at least tree fiddy

What’s your rsn

Groot is pretty dope, any particular reason why?

That wasn’t friendly advice.

You're really reaching there. This idea is the equivalent of people suggesting ideas for Raids 3 while they were still in production of ToB. 
---
as someone who also plays BA for fun, the torso/diary clans (BA services, leech BA are the two biggest) are considerably better than more players. I have 200 high gamble count and I've had maybe 50 sub 13 minute runs ever; they require that speed to join them. 
---
Nothing wrong with BAing for fun!

Corp beast 
---
Ofc you 3stack Lmao. He did it aswell
---
You cool man, this guy obviously hasn't had his coffee yet. 
---
bosses are not meant to be great xp. or at least, thats how i view them. like, i dont really think xp should be on anyones mind when theyre fighting a boss. it certainly isnt on my mind when im doing pvm. extend this to skilling bosses and make rewards 2-3m/hr like pvm bosses and i think you have some good content.
---
make the boss decent but not best xp, and like 300-500k gp/hr and you've got yourself some dead content.
---
No, they want to fix the current cc system and make it better. They’ve mention this multiple times over the past like 3 years. It’s something they want to fix but is a lot of work.
---
My friend has 3 shards in 65 kills..

I’m currently at 2 shards at 400+ kc

UIM keeps untradeables (and only untradeables) on death.

When it comes to the wilderness it's a competitive area, and has always been played with 1 person per account in the past. It has only been recently that Jagex completely stopped caring about multi account logging. The way it should be played is 1 person, 1 account. The whole point of getting a team or clan together was getting a group of players to work together. Whet I have currently seen are possibly two different scenarios. There is either multi-boxing where people are linking clients so that a everything they do on a single account is mimic'd on the others and then there are players that have perfected how to PK on on 5 accounts at once. It's not an easy thing to do, if it was everyone would be doing it and it would be the new norm. At the rate it's happening though, it's basically multi pk on 3+ accounts at the same time or don't be competitive. It's not in the spirit of the game, no matter how much you argue that it's possible to do. Just because we can, doesn't mean we should. This is a new development in OSRS that you didn't see in the past. I don't see a problem with playing multiple accounts at the same time in different areas. Most of us are skilling and training alts at the same time all the time. It doesn't hurt anyone competitively like in the wilderness.
---
In case you aren't aware of the f2p wilderness scene. It's filled with mostly pures that are spec'd out to be as efficient as possible with 40 attack. Then you have the Rag tanks, with maybe 40-50 range and 90 defense. It's extremely hard to die in f2p with 90+ defense and no teleblock. So these rag tanks walk around, 1 guy is controlling 5 accounts and make it hard to compete with unless of course you stoop to their level and do the exact same thing. Then these guys all team up with each other so it ends up being a team of 5 guys playing 15+ accounts. It's hard enough to get a group of 15 together to go PK and match them so it's always going to be an unfair advantage unless you do the exact same thing. Multi-pking always ends up walking around with no one else to fight and then logging out since you can't take on the bigger teams, it's actually a very big and real problem with the wilderness. At least in the past we had the excuse of there being a legitimate clan of 15 players. 
---
As you say, this is something I could do, but do we want to go down that road? Are we going to disincentivize people to the point where the wilderness is only going to be people who multi account pk. It's become more and more common recently and makes the game less fun to play if you don't do the same thing. The wilderness is already dying and it's hard enough to get new blood to join with 1 account, and then there are players making it worse and not in the spirit of the game for the rest. The easier thing to do is just quit and go do something else that is fun. 
---
no fuk u
---
Not in f2p where the best thing is a rune scim, fire blast and addy arrows. It's rampant out there.
---
I once thought that, by looking at the world map, I could just walk to the North West corner of the wilderness and the over into the members area because it looked like on the world map there wasn't anything to stop me from doing that.
---
Didn't really think that through. 
---
Can anyone help me with Heroes Quest I need a Phoenix Gang member for the candlestick??
---
Completely unrelated, but damn bro wtf is going on with this show?? Never letting my kids watch TV again

lmao i remember thinking the same thing but i was too scared of the wilderness to try
---
When we fall asleep, where does it rain?

Where are the ranger boots he got last vid?

Archer's Ring only increases accuracy, not ranged strength, and thus does not give a max hit
---
Damn. My KC is around 600-700 and I've had 4 shards and 2 monkey tails. A handful of other ballista pieces too.
---
e x p o s e d
---
Agreed. Although this ties into the topic of diary requirements on agility shortcuts, having the elite diary as req instead of the hard one on that shortcut is just making potentially relevant content completely dead. 
---
Let's move u/dragged to stam pot sink bridge
---
Wondering this as well
---
It costs 6m
---
My mate whos plat1 stacked with 3 other plat players for 1 season and got challenger in 3v3. I dont think u understand how easy it is.
---
I loved this time period also. It had the amazing graphics and quests of rs3, but without the shitty combat system and mtx (at least it did for a while, I can't remember when SoF came out). I'll always push for osrs to be more like this time period. It's also why I'm pissed off that OSHD died miserably. What even happened to that? 
---
It makes a big difference, I usually get 1:30-2:30 kills with only 85 ranged with DHCB and Rigour.
---
are you tryna induce serotonin syndrome in all of us?
---
What are your levels/setup? Im currently doing the same and my kill times are twice yours. Are you using dragon darts or something?
---
Ok..
---
Yeah but not getting hydra head is fine cause you probably made bonk.
---
Idk if this is supportive or making fun of it lol
---
It still wouldn't be efficient as a uim to get 99 WC then get 99 construction, as with the current method of chopping teak trees and teleporting to WC guild you get 95k exp/hr total
---
You get 60k cons exp and 35k wc exp. So the time you save using the Cape over the jewelry teleport won't make up the time you spent getting 99 wc when you already get experience from construction 
---
That's the main question here too. Also who cares about him. Is it drama for popularity? 
---
Yeh I know. But I haven’t even been to the nightmare zone yet.
---
May I have your lööps, bröther?
---
Don’t the models already exist?
---
Okay. Thankyou 🙂
---
Oh yes you're right, I wasn't thinking. Still think it's beneficial to worthwhile to switch between them though
---
At the very least I can tell you poured alot of time, effort and love into this. I would like to read it when its all done. Good Luck 🤞.  
---
Honestly I think the rewards from low tier diaries are already very overpowered. Don’t see a reason for the tokkul effect to be present on all tiers of gloves, while the step to prove yourself to the tzhaar is an elite step (equip fire cape).
---
Now try to actually think about your idea and maybe you'll realise how dumb it is
---
If they only added it as an option people could pick the HD or SD depending on which they preferred

Out of all the lewd drawings you have done, this is easily the most arousing of them all.

i mean its runescape, you pot up and click your buttons.
---
its not a big deal if specs dont hit at vork really.
---
Never thought of it like that, but it totally fits. 
---
But he has jump cuts throughout his videos? 
---
Dude I’m 1,600 boosted kills dry of a whip right now , fuck off.
---
I love how every moron crying for a reset hasent given a single suggestion to make it not die again in a month and have 50 players again
---
It’s simply reading and displaying data. Because Jagex has chosen the road of allowing 3rd prty clients, I doubt they can do shit about them, unless they straight up execute in-game actions. With Runelite being open-source, the threshold to create a new overpowered client has become very low, since you can just fork Runelite and keep it up-to-date with Runelite’s master branch.
---
The only way this could have been avoided was shutting down OSB before it started gaining popularity and blocking all the 3rd party clients in process. Now it’s definitely too late as the community backslash would be huge.
---
OSRS actually came out in February 2013, the same year as the poll! This sounds really interesting, I'd love to read it if it gets published in the future.
---
It’s just one of those task your have to protect from magic. Don’t wear d hide, where proselyte.
---
Gotcha. Now I just need to re (ei) one of my salves after I lost the one I had doing revs 
---
You really aren't very smart. It's a joke because it managed to wander into the Rogue's Castle.
---
&gt; Yeah, you.could find them all out, bit that's gonna be a real chore. 
---
As autistic as his fanbase is you really don't think hundreds of them would do exactly this.
---
Hell one of them probably saw your comment and is working on the Reddit post right now 
---
Don't leave if your specs don't hit. Your kill will be slow, but you're losing massive gp/hr by leaving constantly and doing yourself a disservice
---
It was already declining ever since the beginning of 2012, so the peak ended in late 2011.
---
Pussy he is not
---
Dude it takes 60s to grab gear with the bank tag "vork" and teleport out there with fremmy boots 4. 4 minutes for 2 kills and you've made 300-500k in 5 minutes. This is coming from someone with 99 farming through almost entirely herb runs and a few hundred vork kills. You seem to have neither. 
---
What race card lol
---
See you at the top!
---
Imagine using staves
---
^(This meme was brought to you by the Lumby Elite gang)
---
Yeah if you can afford rigor, that's the best to upgrade. With rigor and BP with rune darts you will make good gp/hr still and will probably get 3-5 kills a trip, depending on range level and skill and avoiding damge. 
---
So fking happy I got it on a fire giant task
---
It’s okay, mate &lt;3
---
My cc, zeah Ironmen, had a guy there named swampUIM who changed his mind after tutorial island and became a Zeah Only ironman, but never changed his name. 
---
What's the point of constant self promo, we have a pinned thread for that stuff don't we
---
Yeah it makes sense for pegs/prims, but the dhide/dboots switch is equivalent to the ring switch
---
Nice dude! I got mine just a few days ago too at kc 93
---
Awesome dude thank you, I’m 99 range and feel like I’m really good at avoiding damage, only really get hit by the mage attacks as I’m praying range. Should I still be praying range with blow pipe? 
---
Bout tree? Tree fiddy?
---
stay mad lmao
---
It's "max" combat *level*, not effectiveness. It doesn't cap at exactly 126, either.
---
First time I went underwater for RFD I was blown away at how pretty everything was. Would love more areas like that if done in moderation
---
I did konar from 64-80 slayer. Made some good coin on shit tasks. I use nieve now that I want to burst nechs and dust devils though. Still use konar every 10th task however as the points are too good. 
---
Is there a word for this art style? I don’t really see it heavily implemented in any other community, but it seems like it dominates 90% of osrs fan art that I see. 
---
The set will probably fall to 50m-70m range. It’s so niche and useless at this point lol. 
---
Same thing is happening to the ghrazi rapier because of lance release. 
---
would be pretty unwise to post about it on Reddit if he didn't want people to know what he did
---
No he didn't.

Masters theses do get published on the school's website for anyone to read regardless if it gets submitted to academic journals or not, that's a step that comes afterwards.

Your interpretation 
---
gachiGASM YES SIR

if whites shouldn't say it then neither should 'blacks' or any other race
---
Multiboxing is just playing more than one account.
---
I dunno, Taverley dungeon Slayer-only area is pretty nice. There's a ranged safespot about halfway through the cave too.
---
Find the Way. It plays in the tunnels of Ape Atoll and reminds me of the release of Monkey Madness and the excitement of completing arguably the most difficult quest in the game at the time.
---
With BP you'll need to spring for extended super antifires since you don't have the dragon fire protection from your shield slot anymore. I probably only go through 2 sips a trip, so it's not too bad. But bc of this, you also need to pray mage to completely negate Dragonfire, which leaves you vulnerable to ranged attacks, esp without a shield for def. Essentially BP is a glass Cannon, you max damage (while trying to balance profitabilty still) to try to speed up kills to the point where you take less damage overall. If you don't mind the cost dragon darts will make him a breeze (I was getting sub 2 min kills) but rune will still punch hard and are a third the price. 
---
40 years of playing this game? My brother it's not that old. If this is real... I'm sure your life will improve in time, if it's not then that's very sad to make up :(
---
I wish you all the happiness in the weld
---
&gt;The only place it should be is the "lobby" or "login screen".
---
How is this not more convenient 
---
Nah, Duradel is all the way across the river. &amp; yeah, it could be a tier 3 reward, but best case is that it's not a filler reward at all.
---
I can't imagine how you're supposed to PVP on mobile. I can't manage it on PC, how would that work with a tiny touchscreen
---
I kinda feel like I wasted a lot of my childhood as well playing games when my friends were playing outside or whatever but I was too obsessed so I preferred to stay inside and play. Now I take every opportunity I can to go out with others but we don't have anywhere near as much time now cos my friends and I are at work or busy doing some other stuff. Oh well, that's hindsight I guess.
---
Hope you're doing alright now bro
---
Wow and he's already got 99 prayer
---
This thread screams "i didn't secure my account properly and it's not my fault"
---
Jad!
---
Nice NMZ gear for an ironmeme, easy maxing for you
---
Totally forgot about that!!
---
2 douses each for 4 people = 2 full pots per run
---
Consider the fact there are hundreds or thousands of tob runs daily... I'd beg to differ.
---
so thats basically a wipe isnt it
---
I mean sure thats a better option tbh 
---
hit my ass with your dick daddy

To be fair, mm2 and ds2 may be long but you’ll enjoy then both

It revived alot of dead content at the time. And made the cave a hub for clan wars and safe 1v1's. 
---
Lots of risk fights at red portal too.
---
Sweet thanks! I’ll have to look into this!
---
The whole point of clan wars (as it is) is to be able to practice without risk
---
Very true, i realized this when i was doing lavas

Once you beat him, you get the fire cape which is BiS for melee. GL mate

My accounts fine buddy i just know that its actually incredibly easy for your emails to become comprimised therefore auth is obsolete and so are passwords, the only thing that seems to save people is bank pins.

It takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes from 98-99 cooking with wines, 500k xp/hr
---
r/wooosh
---
I did. Apart from that shitty platform 😡
---
Terrible advice tbh. As an Ironman you won’t have trident of swamp or blowpipe when you start, so you take any advantage you can get. And suffering is quite huge. Also you won’t have serp helm so Zulrah can be a bitch 
---
More hot takes:
---
Ranged damage should be based partly on your strength level, or there should at least be strength requirements on bows.
---
Defenders are OP.
---
The blowpipe was polled as the same speed as an msb, and should have to pass another poll to stay in the game.

Getting 99 FM on my ironmeme unlocked quite a lot of supplies for skilling, also made around 10m gp there which only took a week and a bit.

Im going for ranks at this point

What's this about?
---
Sounds good! I’m going to grind up my ranged and prayer to tackle it ASAP. Found a guide online, but are there any lesser known tips most guides don’t cover?
---
that's actually my plan now, i'm quite close to finishing hard diary, just need my farming up ansd agi one level, to finish hard and like 3 more quests then i'll power barrows for a zulrah setup then swap over
---
Funnily enough that's exactly what happened to the only account I can currently play. 
---
I recovered it and logged in and it was in Falador east bank(??) in standard green dragon killing gear with all the junk still in the bank from when I actually played and quested it, with like 500k in random stuff still in the bank. 
---
The thing is though that the account *was* banned but it was simply squashed during the recovery process I guess? 
---
https://i.imgur.com/yavRtiR.png
---
I would've never even known about it unless I went and checked out of curiosity after seeing it in  that bot gear. You should check if your account has a quashed ban by checking that box. 
---
It's not really relevant to runescape and complaining about it won't really change anything, might actually increase the amount of people going to flame the cc.
---
Also I'm going to guess most people on the subreddit sit in either clan cc's or their own respective social cc's like caveman only. 
---
To add on even more downvotes, this type of shit happens a lot in the reddit cc's^1 where people will flame about stupid shit or "troll", it's not surprising to me that people have figured this out and see these threads as "well yeah, obviously, the cc is toxic as shit". I mean, a lot of the subreddit is just toxic people who instantly insult you if you disagree with them. 
---
^1 It was toxic as shit for the few days I was in it atleast, so that's my experience and why I'd never join and am not surprised in the slightest.
---
Wintertodt?
---
I quit Runescape in 2010, logged back into Runescape 3 for the first time for nostalgia's sake of seeing my old account. I got this screenshot (needsMoreJPEG) to motivate me and set some goals for my new account.
---
Youre wasting time playing an f2p iron man. Honest truth
---
Light armours (hide etc) for ranging
---
Robes for magic
---
Metal armours for melee
---
he just literally said hes f2p because hes not paying 11 bucks for 2x member accounts
---
Are you me? 
---
Not a virgin thanks to my uncle and i got cancer for free from mep2 
---
Get the cbow man, also vork is gr8 money. Make that ur main moneymaking method 
---
Get hit by aberrant spectres or dust devils without nose peg/facemask
---
I enjoy how you kept the dark and melancholic theme of the original song while brightening it up with the trap vibe. Keep up the good work!
---
In case you're stupid or an ultimate ironman.
---
From what I've heard the average isn't really much. The majority of their money comes from single large donations from whales getting 99. Pretty much just random at that point.
---
omg u poor thing. upvotedd!!! 
---
we play a game that is very limited mechanically - especially outside of combat. engaging, challenging, dangerous sounds nice but what examples are there in the game we can work off of? wintertodt has to be the closest thing and yet that is far from any of those things. if we weren't playing a 20 year old browser game then yeah id be inclined to agree that could make something like that and be unique
---
Well a reasonable player wouldn’t. But a noob would to protect themselves in the wild or they aren’t paying attention and grabbed something valuable from their bank. You never know. The fact that there is so many pkers there just shows that someone has dropped bank in the area. 
---
They could also be trying to up the K/D ratio too. There’s a million reasons why pkers pk but anything is fair game in the wild. 
---
Yeah idk what happend to tab prices they were around 900gp last time I bought some
---
if that worked that's clever
---
Ahh I miss the days of running here to find a random team to fight in! Good fun. 
---
After 50 runs, I agree with you. I spent way too much time teleporting out to try speccing again when I could just have spent that time actually killing Vorkath. The BGS spec is nice when it hits but it isn't a necessity. 
---
Man, people really hate Morytania quests
---
I tried again using the addy darts and I get overwhelmed with the prayer switch/killing healers.
---
Maybe I’m just too trash 
---
Don't forget Siege.
---
86 right now 
---
so your kdr isn't all deaths.
---
No mate, I’ll actually will finish with Mory Quest! Shoot out to my favorite osrs series Swampletics 💪🏽
---
Like everyone else is saying, you can have multiple cats.
---
Exactly. We wouldn't jagex taking a few more weeks between the weekly slayer boss updates.
---
For some reason I thought the towers on the corners were wheels and it was a tank. 
---
Sounds like a rebranded wintertodt I'm in
---
It's purgatory, he was the first to beg for gold or anything you can spare.
---
A gotcha. Well they have every axe up to rune there at the shop
---
Baby
---
Thanks a lot
---
Please explain how what you said was logical?  I'm curious tbh.  I truly mean no disrespect

now u can go afk nightmarezone and get all 99 melee ez
---
thats wrong every single one Ive seen in level 3-10. The one in the picture only has lvl 20 prayer and 5 fletching.
---
But they aren't using quick chat. So a quick chat ban does nothing.
---
Only Ninja has peaked higher in sub count than Shroud. It's impossible to read every sub/donation and play the game 
---
U could have killed rex and got d axes from him.. and it would show in wt log as well.
---
Iron? That's nightmare fuel. RIP
---
Another one of these...

---
Riding the trendy wave for monetization value/fame huh?
---
I don’t have stats for Rex, those are bonafide drops.
---
...
---
nothing untradable will show to other people still
---
and i tested ~18 mo ago with a friend, it still counts as you dropping the item so iron men cant loot them
---
Oh ok, I understand now. Congrats!
---
So most store didn’t have  SIM cards I. Their displays but there was one store near me that had active lines on all of their phones. I used that for a couple of years until they closed. 
---
HEB!
---
Wtf does that even mean?
---
Wings like it's RS3 lmao
---
Multiboxing is when you only have to click once for all of the accounts to do the same action, op is playing every account individually 
---
I haven't seen the ones that are named "2x xxxxxxxx" I guess. I've only seen the "RNG xxx" accounts and a lot of those are hacked and in like in the 80s or so.
---
Regardless, they'll probably find a way to get around whatever limitation is set. They make too much money for so little efffort.
---
Also just a really nice/genuine guy which, for me, is super refreshing in a time when being 'controversial' boosts popularity. 
---
Man it'd be SUCH a fun stream if he kept saying "Thank you WeedMasterXxX420 for your sub" literally every 5 seconds due to the amount of subs he gets.
---
The fun is in everything that isn't this
---
Pm me and its all yours buddy
---
I’d be mad if this even made it to the polls.
---
Is there anywhere I can see a graph of my total level over time? I think it would be neat to see my progression in graph form

Got your run energy, thanks for the house kiddo.
---
hahahahahahahaha
---
Oh shit I didn’t even realize how much better the blow pipe is I’ll have to pick that up ASAP
---
that does sound like it would piss them off
---
All that doesnt make it any less revolting. Rolling over and letting it happen is cowardly. 
---
If you have a job that requires Macs for security purposes, the whole apple ecosystem is incredibly convenient to buy into. Their support is also very good.
---
This isn't 2009 anymore, if you think Macs are stupid because they're Macs you're just an idiot.
---
It was added it the same day that they removed Wilderness PvP.
---
Yes as long as the boss is not a giant orange
---
I saw him as well, giggled a bit.
---
Yes they would, and they would say 'nice' before proceeding to not care. I LOVE pets, but I doubt I'm in the minority when I say I don't care what kc/exp it's received on. I think the low level and low kc pet posts are neat and will slap that upvote, but I can't fathom the need to stay at a certain level or skill, or clarify to people when I got it. 
---
I heard after maxing that account, he decided to up the ante.
---
seriously? why is that
---
Easy - a Varrock Guard. This is part of a worker exchange program aimed at building cultural ties between Misthalin and Rellekka.
---
Keep training hunter, but you'll never have more chins than your mom.
---
nah infernal cape is BiS, fire cape is still dope though.
---
Thank you so much gonna get that sorted right now :D
---
That platform was upsetting because I got rinsed and had to pick up all the shit again.
---
And then the final fight I just cheesed, so it didn't even feel like accomplishment. 
---
I liked ds2 a lot more.
---
Sorry I didnt know this was r/2008scape
---
First of all, welcome and glad to hear you're having a blast. Forgive me and buckle up cause this is gonna be an essay of a Reddit comment if you ever seen one. Unfortunately as you already have noticed the PvP scene is quite the niche, which requires for specific account builds to optimise your damage output/KO potential Vs your defensive abilities. I'm going to split my response into a few sections, so I hope you're here with me:
---
Getting your prayer question out of the way: yes prayer level does influence your combat level, although not as much as the other skills do. Also I would like to know if you are currently a member or a F2P player, and if you consider paying for membership as something you would.
---
To answer the question of whether your account is still viable/has potential to become a viable build for PvP: not with these stats currently, but it can still be molded into a medium/high level PvP account with a few builds to chose from. First thing you need to do if you want to consider using this account for PvP is stop training attack, defence and prayer "manually" (so don't kill monsters whilst training these skills, and don't bury any bones for your prayer level), or even stop training your cb stats alltogether. Start looking into what kind of account you would like to have, what requirements and investments these bring to the table (both time and money wise), and decide for yourself. (If you need help with this I'm willing to help, but I'm not gonna go full in depth into the different builds already in this comment itself).
---
To answer the other question, whether or not you're better off making a new account to PvP with (like the 'pures' you have encountered) and/or stop playing your current account alltogether: (This is my two cents on the topic of course) I would strongly advise you to keep playing your current, first ever account! With or without PvP aspirations, having an account like this (commonly referred to as a 'main') to explore the game and mess around with is great to have. A main account let's you enjoy the game in its entirety and you are free to do as you please! Unless you want to make it a PvP build, then you are wise to follow certain restrictions, but even so there are PvP builds that will let you enjoy the end game content as well. Because you are a new player, I would strongly advise you to minimise your limitations for your main account and to not commit too much too soon towards a niche within the game such as PvP, because you might be missing out on stuff you never knew you would be enjoying to experience!
---
Lastly, to combine the two questions: you first of all need to be honest with yourself. Is this a game you want to dive into and play intensive, or are you more someone that would log in every once a week for an hour or so and just mess around for the heck of it? RuneScape is quite the immersive experience if you let it. If you are down to take the dive and enjoy the game to the fullest, my advice would be to play your current account as a main with almost no PvP aspirations and make a new account on the side with a predetermined PvP oriented build. A lot of the veteran players have multiple, sometimes dozens of accounts with different stats, item unlocks and what not. If you want to see what the game has to offer before you really want to commit to the PvP aspect, I suggest you keep a high level PvP build in mind as you play your main account (this usually means limit attack and defence to 70, but as I said earlier if you want more info on that lemme know). If you wanna enjoy the PvP content but don't want to invest too much time into the preparation of an account built for PvP, I suggest you make a new account right away and make it a pure, maybe even a F2P pure at first so you need minimal starter wealth and stats to start fighting like minded people!
---
This might sound arrogant but I don't mean it in that way, but I have been playing this game on and off (mostly on) for around 12 years, and have taken some new players "under my wings" so to speak, which I really enjoy doing, so if you are looking for an RS buddy with decent game knowledge that you can talk to, ask questions about the game etc let me know! This game still holds a special place in my heart, and through guiding new players I get to experience part of that journey, of how the game felt before I knew so much about it, again. Because that is what RS is all about, finding and forging your own path and doing what you enjoy doing! Good luck and have fun!
---
Sounds like a huge waste of dev time
---
Could bring a better balance to smithing unlocks by building parts / ammo as level unlocks from 1-99. Good idea tbh pal I like the sound of it
---
Bump
---
You will not get 100K/hr at 63 ranged. 
---
that was bullshit, if you read weaths further replies it's clear there was still a lot of sketchy stuff going on with that account. although he ended up with the account it wasn't his account to begin with
---
Lmao dude you do realize he has tens of thousands of 40+ month subs right? He can’t read all of his high number subs he constantly has over 50k of them. That’s thanking a sub every 30 or so seconds bud. 
---
2011 was my favorite year, ;(
---
Woodcutting is a very low value skill, so it's balanced to make the effect of the skill-cape less powerful than other skill-capes.
---
Nice! Mine's 83, the fastest kill I can get is like 4 minutes though, with the same setup. How are you killing it so fast?
---
It just sucks that rc is the most annoying skill to train and you have to survive the monsters in the abyss, making it hard for a mostly skiller, plus you gotta deal with the semi occasional pker. Rc as a skill has so much combat around it for some reason such as Trolls Stronghold and Mournings End Part 2 while most skills have little or no combat/quest restrictions
---
D
---
Ight
---
Ya after further inspection think I’ll go with MSB instead of blowpipe to save myself a little cash 
---
if that happens then it's likely your details were distributed in a database leak and some gold farming fuck took over your account
---
You're jewing it right
---
Same for me. And then I realized the cape was only really going to be useful until I got the fire cape. Now it's outclassed until I get my 2nd 99, which is probably farming.
---
Crash the first iron man you see, its fine.
---
1. Do the stronghold of security in barbarian village
---
2. Complete "Garden of tranquility" to get the ring of charos (a). Equip it when you ask her for a new kitten
---
You have to go through all the floors of the Stronghold of Security for the emotes. 
---
As for the cats, you need to talk to Gertrude with the Ring of Charos which is from the Creature of Fenkenstrain quest.
---
Take my upvote my fellow coffee being for that ingenious insult!!
---
That doesn't make complaining about it on reddit any more helpful though. Report them, ban them/mute them and move on. Unless your hope is to get some jmods to sit in your cc and moderate it for you. 
---
I'm just saying that this is why it's downvoted. Not because people think its okay or want to let it happen or because they are being "cowardly". It's because complaining about it does literally nothing except give people more attention. There are systems in place to deal with it. 
---
did you swap any rs3 to osrs gold at that time
---
big oof
---
2010 with free trade and wilderness, that would be the goat.
---
Ah, wasn't aware, but I'm glad to find out. :)
---
Hard clues don't drop ranger boots. Are you talking the queen in the hidout? 
---
I hated questing but doing ds2 and mm2 were solid and i really enjoyed them
---
Can they tell the difference between a user DC and a server DC?
---
I think if they can and it's on the users end, that's their problem...but if Jagex can see it's on their end they should investigate it and revert it.
---
I'll pass on that, it gives more magic exp and is technically better I believe.
---
Looks like [this guy](https://preview.redd.it/z4gjlihcqbb21.jpg?width=500&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec73fcca5b346374f9a98bf9a6c630da6bb37c2)
---
wtf?
---
i have enjoyed like 90% of the quests in the game, the only one i didnt like that i remember is garden of tranquility
---
rope almost as good as spade
---
Just put an exit you have to click on with a dismissible warning, just like the wilderness ditch. People will still get lured, some people will never learn 
---
back up to 70gp. your merch worked
---
mkay bud if you can solo to masters ill pay your rs sub for 3 months 
---
Reminds me of Monster Reborn Reborn
---
Go kill green dragons in the wild
---
 Cri evry tim
---
i motherlode mined for prospector outfit when i was mining for that quest, did the hard falador diary step then sold the outfit and bought a coal bag, highly recommend if you can bear the xp loss from letting mining be a little more afk.
---
I don't think anyone figured out that it was a joke.
---
I like how nobody mentioned he’s being traded a rope and a chair and has 69k in inventory. Memes 
---
ah yeah good point
---
I think the throne room?
---
D pick gotta be like 1/1m if we’re comparing the odds to the d axe in wintertodt cus it’s 10x more expensive lol
---
rc is only tedious until 77. that's only 1.4m xp. its hardly 1/10 of the way to 99. It then becomes extremely afk for 500k gp/hr. There aren't ANY afk skills you can do and still make that much gp/hr that I can think of. RC isn't a tedious skill. It's tedious for the low levels, but people are still afraid of it.
---
I think it was added recently, only noticed it a day ago or so.
---
they've been adding reclaim systems to all pvm instead. i'm sure eventually we'll end up with gravestones or something similar
---
It has literally never hit the polls. 
---
Can you really just buy steroids like that? 
---
Bro your HP!
---
You’ll honestly need rigour and lance for solo or it gets way too difficult
---
Wouldn't be easier to just unfilter the chat option that you added ultracompost to the chat
---
Nty keep dragon pick in the wild
---
Not a PKer but i understand why as im not a brainlet.
---
1. Fun. Self explanatory.
---
2. Sometimes you get brainlets who get really mad which some people find funny
---
3. Potential for loot. What if the dude hunting salamanders is an UIM? Could loot his whole bag for 10+mil easily. What if someone forgot their cash stack? Or their rune pouch with huge amounts of runes? 
---
Takes a couple seconds to kill that dude and the potential for reward is there.  Just not to piss you off? if you dont want to be PKed you should prolly be out the wilderness bub
---
Actually still have dramen staff in my bank with the elite done. 
---
also kinda made this acc out of just bein bored on the main and trained it a little too early. gonna actually do the right quests for this new acc
---
Chaeldar has some really bad tasks. I'd stick to nieve and konar for streak bonuses.
---
Alchemy shouldn't take you that long. I'd recommend looking up a guide to explain how to do it efficiently.
---
50/50 op is fucking with you guys.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/a7jzgi/i_spent_the_last_three_hours_pretending_to_be_a
---
Looks like you have work to do. Then I’ll peer review your work, and then you can publish it 
---
That's the point. The clan doesn't win. The individual does. Current clans are massive, exclusive, and pump a handful of players with the best gear, leaving solo players with an extreme disadvantage compounded even further when clans lockdown areas. With a randomized system it'd take longer to organize things of that scale, and encourage individual or small group gameplay rather than the cluster fuck shit show we have now. 
---
Thx
---
So your reason for not wanting this is because some people are retarded?
---
Yes and also let us have the option to eat 28 sharks in one game tick.
---
ah ok thank you, where the godfather was/is?
---
What about 28 year old nerds who work for the army then come home and play Runescape all day?
---
Piss cream
---
Lmaoo
---
Currently have 64 rc, gotta to regicide, roving elves, and both mournings ends to make death runes. Understand that 77 is a small percent of the overall goal but if anything it should be the opposite where 1-77 is afk and then after it gets more difficult. What do you recommend to get to 77? Are death runes the best or is there another method that I don’t need to do all these quests
---
You're not really doing barrows for magic xp but for money only. Trident will make each trip more cost effective 
---
why not? its not that great
---
Unfortunately I’d really suggest rune darts. The increased accuracy and DPS makes learner raids a lot smoother if everyone uses them. I’d be down to do a few learner raids to help you get going once I’m home and able to play. Just PM me your IGN if you’re down, I’m like 250 CoX kc
---
mainly because they can. but that being said it’s shameful (coming from someone who pks frequently)
---
Google it?
---
What you talking bout Willis? 
---
Billy PepeHands
---
just mute them...
---
Oh that’d be rad. Maybe you could choose which god or something like that. Reuse the mage arena statues. 
---
well if you are generalizing about people's habbits then you are just flat out wrong because people generally like to watch youtube videos and use the wiki, and the proof is how popular they are
---
A lot of people do lava runes w/ magic imbue I believe. 
---
It's the most popular "unpopular opinion"
---
We could have saved like months of Dev time using either this or the backup right before  HD.
---
We added half of that content already anyway
---
Hd graphics make me shook
---
If you get a monkey tail via hunter does it show up in that log?
---
 People enjoy the feeling of "winning" even when it's entirely one sided.
---
There's no way that someone with 99 hp only got hit 2 how per round.  At 50 hp I get hit a minimum of 3 per hit, and I need about 3 cakes per round.
---
Yea thats my thinking too, realistically itll just look like im pressing the buttons to the client and its not like its automated so unlikely for them to even be able to see I'm doing it but would feel kinda dirty.
---
You have been kicked from the channel.
---
I've been making a sort of skilling pure lately and i've been using it to hunt for boss pets, it's a lot of fun, i'd reccommend it if you're feeling like adding a little more challenge to your rs playthrough
---
 my best advice is if you plan on doing slayer, don't start dragon slayer, because if you don't start it you won't get dragons as your slayer task, making it a lot faster in the long run
---
And if you plan on getting 52 prayer later on, get great brain robbery and swan song done beforehand, since they give loads of prayer xp
---
Good luck on your pure &lt;3
---
Same, I love Pick &amp; Shovel. Even my friends who have never played love Pick &amp; Shovel.
---
It's takes you 5 minutes to unplug and then plug back in your ethernet cable? You got arthritis lmao??
---
DC at giants worth it?
---
Oh wow two very original funny memes I’ve never seen before!  Why is no one discussing these funny memes that have not been beaten past death  like a zombified horse?
---
Sigh. I'll reiterate. I'm more than happy to hear to feedback on how to improve the suggestion or on what part of it people dislike. Constructive criticism is the only way to get better and try to offer better suggestions! 
---
What's the issue? Focus on one ability at a time. If you can't kill those guys it probably means your missing freezes. So at first had full Xerican and only switch to crossbow or DDS. That way you can still freeze even if you have no staff out. After that, focus on getting offensive prayers right. Then you can learn to do multiple switches, and at that point you're ready to fight the occasional Venezuelan PKer. That's where you'll learn to get your defensive prayers on point.
---
Just take it one step at a time. It really is the most rewarding part of the game. 
---
Did we really used to watch a man in a purple kids suit get noshed off? Jeez it all seemed so innocent 
---
This was the real clan wars.  Massive army fighting an shit now it's just dead change it back
---
Yeah and I think thats probably the most realistic takeaway. They likely wouldn't be able to detect it but if they did, they'd ban it. 
---
&gt;looks at games necklace

Keep em around to teach ignorant people about getting scammed.

At least in MM2 you can cheese the final boss.
---
UIM here, pls nah
---
Ballpark 10-20m. It can vary pretty heavily if you're doing red chins or normal chins and what your gear setup is and if you ever let yourself die (shouldn't happen unless you're extremely negligent). Probably 200k-300k/hr exp
---
If you die with chinchompas on you you lose them all though.
---
The removal of risk was the worst update in OSRS. It changed the entire mentality of the game and in my opinion made the majority of content outside of the wilderness boring.
---
The majority of LizardSquad may be in jail, but then irreversibly changed OSRS. I bet even if you could guarantee no disconnects ever again, the majority would never accept dangerous deaths again. 
---
I see
---
Never said they were funny. This coming from “Cptqueef” tho lmfao...
---
Oh god, here we go again *unzips*
---
Your suggestion reminds me of tower defence. Support!
---
Actually if I recall correctly he didn't mess up. He told people to not stand there or they might get hit. People watching the stream came anyway and knew the danger. That's why there are so many people with nothing equipped. 
---
That’s western
---
Yes, teleports to the wilderness exist.
---
?
---
How about you just bank your shit before you log out? Or better yet just don't get hacked.
---
&gt;Why would they put a ring of dueling teleport into the wilderness if there was any risk in doing so?
---
???
---
I've read enough army stories to know everyone in there is at least a little bit gay
---
It could be related though, because I used to get 5 herbs instead of 6, meaning one of my patches was super composted too when I had attas seed active 
---
Suggestions:
---
-Boss can break cannons, and you'd have to repair it with a hammer.
---
-Make it require 50 smithing to enter.
---
-Maybe have monsters enter the area if doors are broken?
---
Sorry but cptqueef was funny as shit when I made it 6 years ago boss
---
Hey everyone, I'm a returning player from about 2009 ish like the most of us. Lots of things have changed so I'm definitely feeling like a bit of a noob again lol. Is playing the game as a f2p even worth it? Should I grind to maintaining a bond or just put the game down? I'm not interested in paying for a mem so that's not really an option at this point. 
---
Your suggestion is brilliant, someone give this man an upvote. 
---
What do I get in return?
---
Obviously it’s better than torso lol.  The problem is people getting bcp instead of torso when they don’t have those things you mentioned, hence the rhetoric of my post. 
---
While it is true, he has had a lot more time messing with the farming code as it is and posssibly could revisit the idea. But it was a pretty flat "no" at the time.
---
Is there an archived video of this?
---
Really? I followed a video guide for mm2 and it took like 2:15
---
Yeah, this i per lap, at level 2, assuming training at the gnome stronghold.
---
I prefer to do zmi
---
Update, disabling the authenticator did work. 
---
Yeah the quality of life gain in terms of the work requiered dont seem worth it
---
You can have my 600m bank
---
cos you have 60 ranged you monkey brain
---
I agree it needs buffed but jagex mods have already talked about it on stream and said they weren’t going to. Unfortunately it’s one of those items that’s simply dead content. 
---
Accounts don’t get reset. You either logged into a deadman world or onto the wrong account.
---
I'm gonna take my whip to the old hat port
---
Gonna smaaaaaaaaaaack 'til I can't no more
---
Rapier is only marginally better for how volatile it is.
---
Why do you think crystal armors will replace ancestral or armadyl? It's going to have 0 offense bonuses.
---
Avernic is pretty good. It's a pure upgrade. Tent whip and avernic is about the same as a rapier and you'll probably lose less money due to the volatility of the rapier. I'm not sure I'd suggest doing that, I'm too lazy to do long term math. Avernics is basically a suped up prim crystal that's more expensive for higher stats.
---
It's definitely a gaming PC, it's just not top of the line technology and it is a bit outdated at this point. If OSRS is your main game I would focus on a CPU and RAM upgrade first, but given the fact it's old technology replacing those more than likely means having to replace the motherboard as well, just because compatibility for CPU's and RAM has changed since your motherboard released so more than likely couldn't just swap out parts onto your current motherboard. CPU, RAM and GPU are going to have the biggest affects on how well games run. OSRS isn't graphically demanding that's why a GPU isn't as much of a needed upgrade at this point.
---
Pay for a single month. After that it’s easy to sustain bonds. It is worth it
---
Remove walls in superior garden for faster ornate pool use. Otherwise this looks great :)
---
yeah wtf is this thread? lmao I'm 99 hp I go into wintertodt get hit 7's, I'd say I use 1 sara brew each run.
---
the younger you are the slower time feels to pass because you've experienced less time overall at a younger age.
---
For me level 70 was like the max I could handle. After that the grind was just too aids for me and I'd quit. 
---
Dragon knives and heavy ballista is an incredibly powerful combo, especially with void
---
Lmao ayoooo thx m8
---
Okay i’ll get lance when the price comes down a bit. what about the other 170m or so? 
---
RS3 has a nice little [minigame](https://runescape.wiki/w/God_Statues#Statue_types) which is like this. Once a month you rebuild some statues across the world. You get to choose which god to represent and it looks nicer with your construction level. You get construction exp, and then depending on if you choose the right god for the region, you get prayer or slayer experience. And of course after you build it it serves as an altar.
---
Check your email to see if they sent you a code?
---
6 Is faster than 5. (Toxic blow pipe has attack speed of 7 in PVM for example)
---
The bow gives you magic defense because it's meant for killing mages, it gives you negative magic attack for balance.
---
That could be a solution. Can we configure the chat filter ? 
---
I see, but if I'm a poorboi but also want the xp boost over natures then it isn't a bad middle of the road option? 
---
You have to kill only one brother to get barrows gloves 
---
Second this.  You can go out with rag gear and inventory and still have fun.  Don't bring a +1 when you first start out because you'll probably get smited a few times

Ye, go for it

In my experience Amazon requires you logging into the runescape website to claim it, there is no code.
---
from what i found i was logging into the account with my mail, hence why it seemed reset

but i still can;t login with the normal username, which seems weird because they state it doesn;t, ever, change the login name

---
&gt; As you say, this is something I could do, but do we want to go down that road? Are we going to disincentivize people to the point where the wilderness is only going to be people who multi account pk.
---
You should proceed to trying to do that.  A) I seriously doubt anyone does it.  B) You will find it's hard to do/not viable.  C) It certainly will never become the meta anywhere other than f2p multi... and also never there too.
---
What you are likely thinking of are bots.  Legit people on 15 accounts in the wildy does not exist.  Bot farms that can be told to attack a given player, ofc do exist.  The latter of which is a real problem, the former isn't even a thing.
---
Yes please. Was a lil sad after doing that quest and realizing the statues never come back. What kind of shitty city guards let you make off with their fucking statues anyway

Also magic defense doesn't help you kill mages, just not die to them. What do you think of having a toned down scaling a la Twisted bow, though?
---
The total time to complete all the points should be around 5-6 hours. You must be doing something wrong if alchemy is that slow

My thought process was that the price per stat on avernic was worse than the increase from whip to rapier
---
Also armadyl/ancestral only seems marginally better than what i have now for 170m and id only see them being useful at the inferno (where i think crystal arnour might outperform) 
---
How many updoots do you think you'll get for this? Considering the exact same content is posted hourly.

Could just add a separate instance/model beside or on top of the patch that checks for compost. That way you wouldnt have to modify the patch code itself. (I can't even imagine the code being so messy that that isn't possible, but if someone could do it it would be jagex)
---
Just keep trying.  You'll learn

Then just put a warning on it.
---
We shouldn't kill suggestions because of 50 IQ goobers who cba to read a warning. The ring of dueling would teleport you INSIDE clan wars and wouldn't be dangerous upon teleport.

Literally no idea what you're on about.

Items dropped immediately for anyone to pickup.

In my opinion, I think the plank-make spell needs a serious buff, or just plank-making in general. There's no intuitive or interesting content from running back and forward from your butler to the bank over and over again.

Is there any update about group Ironman!?

I just want to clarify I have nothing against shroud I just don't understand why someone would stay subbed for so long to a streamer they can't even interact with. The thing I love about twitch is interacting with streamers but shroud is so huge he'll never notice you or even honestly care about you being in his streams so I just don't understand being like "yes I want to give this dude money", especially when he's already rolling in it. 
---
I’ll try my best :P

What about drop trading?
---
Diary could lower the requirement IMO. Completing a diary means you're more familiar with the area which leads to an easier time getting around
---
I'm confused by your herblore level
---
The way POH instances work I don't think that's possible. The instances have to close so Im not so sure they can keep track of status effects. This is the same reason gilded altar burners sometime go out quicker than they should if you leave your house
---
I think your idea fits best as a minigame. Maybe an extension of the rogues den where you help try to make counterfeit stuff for thieves. As you said though, there are quite a bit of thieving minigames and it might be hard to add in another one.
---
Nieve is pretty nsfw
---
This was amazing in f2p and p2p, there was so much fighting going on in Clan Wars Area because you can just run in and out of the area whenever you wanted. Was fun.
---
F2p clan wars so fun. Anyone remember those large clans like B A A A M? I was such a noob envying those clans that only allowed high CB level. When I hit CB 70 I felt like I was the shit.
---
That’s. Not. How. Statistics. Works.
---
Sorry your 14 IQ doesn’t understand this. 
---
Karmaja
---
F2P worlds near the GE are obviously more toxic than running around adventuring on a members world.  Context matters.  As others have said, you can turn off public chat such that only friends can send you messages, and you don't see what anyone says even if they are next to you.  
---
Let's be a bit realistic, eh?  Any MMO, any online game for that matter, is not kid friendly, when speaking in terms of public/general chats.  Filters must be used, otherwise your kids just can't play games online if "clean" speech is required :/
---
ah yes the good old days
---
Why is your herblore, aility, thieving, fletching, slayer, hunter, farming, summoning, and construction all at 5?
---
Clan wars came out with the same update that removed pvp from the wilderness.
---
Make that skirt in game 
---
Literally this.
---
Not true, not worth wasting bonds or money completing f2p content that’s required. I’d say do all f2p quests then get mems
---
I hear you maybe make it so you can’t drop any valuable items too before a bank pin 
---
The teleport alone is insane,  let alone it being one of the bis cloaks for a while. I think its good because it encourages new members to explore that area faster
---
a ftp world will set all member skills to 5 since that's the max a ftp player can get.
---
As long as it's only usable if the player is on your friends list and has accept aid on and then I wouldn't mind.
---
Pvp was removed from the wilderness literally on the same day clan wars and bounty hunter were introduced.
---
Oh! I didn't realize you could go to 5 as F2P.
---
Still haven't been able to recover my old account from preEOC :(
---
Fair. I was just wondering that myself actually. I think a small adjustment to the rogue's den to make the hanging area exist wouldn't be terrible. I like the idea of it being passive tbh, instead of a minigame. 
---
I remember fighting in a team called Holy Invoker a lot. It was almost always packed.

How so?

Why does death need to be so harsh in non-wilderness areas? 
---
I don’t understand why this needs to be shortened. If it’s like it was in RS2 with graves determining the amount of time you have to return to your items, that would be a mistake. 
---
Giving players more than enough time to return to their gear is the correct thing to do. Life is already stressful enough. I don’t need any extra anxiety from RS.

The wilderness is for killing people, I'm sure there are non dangerous options to train that give less xp in exchange for your safety.
---
Is there any delay before you can attack players After hopping worlds? Im so sick of these braindeads at lava dragons 
---
yeah but why would you get 22k points in a solo? even with a supply drop death before olm it’s like 26k points per raid. I would say if you can get more than 26k points per ffa (or 31k if you can do it without deaths) it’s worth it to do solos instead. I guess you could argue that ffas are faster but they’re also more of a headache and much more likely to get completely fucked by people who don’t know what they’re doing or trolling etc. Probably like half of the ffas I have done have gone far from smoothly. 
---
I haven’t stuck with one method really. I’ve trained my fletching to 55 so I made some money stringing maple bows. Since about a week ago I’ve been getting 15 discounted battlestaves daily. I made like 100k with unstrung jade amulets. Got lucky with 4 ranarr seed drops from 30 ice warriors yesterday. Other than those things my cash stack has been slowly growing through other means. Most of my stats are around 50 or 40. I’m guessing there’s some methods that I can take advantage of that I haven’t yet

Turn public chat off 
---
Keep private on friends/off depending on whether or not you want them communicating with friends or if you plan on communicating with them through game.
---
Get them out of F2P as soon as possible, it's the worst possible experience and where you'll find a lot of scamming/bots/unneeded nonsense.
---
[Maybe read through this list of scams with them that way they know what to look out for if ever approached.](https://oldschoolrunescape.fandom.com/wiki/Scams)
---
But if you decide to have them play with chat off they really shouldn't have to worry about being scammed as they can't see what the scammer is saying.

From the wiki on barrows page:  If your inventory is full when you loot the chest and you get a Barrows item, it will be dropped on the ground but will be in 100% condition.  This is the only way to drop a Barrows item on the ground without it  degrading.

I was thinking that bringing in better planks, you could get better experience along with it repairing the door better. This would essentially turn planks into HP healing items. You would spend more on bringing in planks and other materials in exchange for better healing and more xp.
---
And keep profanity filter on just in case they **learn**

It’s a preference.

Fixed mode = mainstream.

Do what you enjoy.. it’s not like either fixed or resizable is better.

Eh, not very lucky, the share itself is 1/300, but the table is 1/100 to hit, with zenyte being the best drop rate on the table. Maybe a little lucky yes, but not that great

Yes. Right click and click configure on the button.
---
thieving really needs some more stuff. there are 0 afk ways to train.

and no, knights are not afk. constant clicking isn’t afk.

Shilo village is a dead shithole tbh, only worthwhile to get gems and fucken Slayer Master. The forge could be amazing if it wasn't unnecessarily tolled while being garbage. Relocate, make it convenient, and keep the toll. Make the river littered with fishing spots and there'll be more people fishing there.
---
Let this happen and let the lurers come. If u get fucked by a lure at this point its just natural selection
---
well no, because remapping a key to move your cursor x pixels in a direction is a 1:1 action but is bannable.
---
Already in Shilo Village
---
Clan wars was during the roaming revenant wildy days. You couldn't attack players regardless.
---
Lolwut?

Sounds like you fantasize about osrs instead of doing actual work 
---
I got like 6 and the pet in 1500 kills then bailed. Basically creampied the market and you guys can raise the kids now while I stake 
---
I decided on low xp rates because most bosses are fought for loot and not xp. I also didn't want to get yelled at about devaluing construction or anything like that. I can already hear people yelling "you shouldn't be able to make money and train cons at the same time!" lol  
---
I hadn't thought of any loot yet but there would definitely be loot for killing the boss.

Open "Task Manager" and click on the "Performance" tab while running both your clients. You'll see live graphs for your CPU, Memory, and GPU usage. Whichever ones are running high (80-100% utilization) will tell you where the bottleneck is. 
---
If your CPU utilization is high, see if you can turn on GPU render for one of your clients - might reduce the load on CPU.
---
If your memory utilization is high, you probably have too much "other stuff" running simultaneously. Click on the "Processes" tab of Task Manager and sort by the memory column to see which is using the most.
---
If your GPU utilization is high, see if you can turn off GPU render for one of your clients - it'll use more CPU then.
---
If your disk utilization is high and you are using a regular spinny hard drive, it may mean it's either old or dying and you should get an SSD (if you don't already have one).
---
Ever go to the wilderness or active slayer spots?
---
How is this a take
---
Just right click examine it and it tells you. 
---
You don't spend much time underneath the pub in canifis, do you?

PvMers doing clues in wildy complain about losing a spade... can’t imagine them losing 12k via their glory! Reeeeeeeeeeeee
---
FYI Windows has mouskeys built in which makes numpad 5 same as left mouse click
---
I really like this. I’ve been really wanting to learn ToB but the only people in my current clan who could teach say I need to watch the vthevictim guide *multiple times*. 
---
I bet you really enjoyed writing that piece. There's nothing better than writing an essay on a hobby. 
---
For someone I'm assuming (like the majority of the player-base) isn't a native English speaker, you've done a really good fucking job. Well done man! I hope to be able to read it soon (don't post more of it online as you can get done for plagiarism - even if it's your own work). 
---
A lil tip: try and avoid using first-person terms such as "I". It sounds like a massive hassle (it is), however you'll get marked down for it. Also try avoid beating around the bush with terms like "more or less". 
---
Example: "By doing this, I hope to gain insight~~s~~ on what makes prices more or less 'predictable'."
---
To: "By doing so, insight may be gained as towards what factors make prices predictable."
---
Runelite and middle click mouse and drag it like that

Necks? You mean cape? I like to max ranged accuracy for BP specs

I swear my herbs have been dying a lot more since I started using the bottomless bucket with ultracompost. I never actually inspect the patches but now I will.
---
Look at 'chat color'. Pretty sure you would've found this within 1 second if you had looked
---
Battlestaves are a nice little income on the side, but fletching is not a real money maker. You should look into stuff like konar tasks, herb runs, blast furnace, birdhouses, etc. I’d recommend watching some videos by raikesy, kempq, or guides for us all. They show some good ways to make money from new accounts 
---
Interesting.

Takes like 2 hours to beat his total

I've gotten less 1k before :[
---
I'm also dry 30 chest but so is the nature of barrows I guess
---
Haven't really played since 08 but keep track for some updates here and there... My question is, is the region-lock in game or just the player not leaving that region's (in this case Morytania) borders?
---
10h for all helms too? 
---
I would consider a Skilling boss to be different from a boss, i.e. wintertodt
---
It's killed for xp
---
Hence my logic
---
Literally no one just duels in the arena it's dumb. People laugh if you say staking 1k. :(
---
This argument is so bad and has been ruining the experience of osrs for myself and a lot of friends in the game. I feel like osrs is already super dumbed down compared to a lot of modern games. A lot of that is because of when it was made, but man, about 95% of the game feels wayyyyy too unchallenging. A lot of people find enjoyment In the easy things, but it's a niche where certain people enjoy the tedium. Most people need to be continuously challenged and rewarded for improving, but runescapes model has been "spend x time,  get rewarded without any improvement" which just doesn't work for people with lives. I wish more of the game provided a meaningful challenge that had risk and danger and actual satisfying reward instead of the game where I have to try to enjoy tediously watching my exp rise at a snail's pace. (Which can be enjoyable, just not in the same way)
---
 theres the argument of those who will be wrongfully taken advantage of, but you cant cater this game to people who aren't able to handle a challenge, you have to make exceptions for them and give them a safety net without ruining the game for others. 
---
To be fair I'm someone who enjoys the harder parts of the game, pking, wilderness, bossing, raids etc which I know not everyone goes for, but virtually all of my friends have quit rs or sought other means of leveling because they only see the grind that you have to go through that has absolutely no challenge, risk and very little meaningful reward unless you are able to finally get to super late game or, God forbid, develop pvp skills, which let's face it, wont happen unless they train for months and even then jagex and the community at reddit will never allow for making pvp any more accessible because of the reee seen against any pvp oriented changes.
---
Sorry for the rant, I just see so much of this game as pointless because you aren't actually improving and challenging yourself and the parts of the game, like pvp, that I wish more could get involved in, gets shit on because people have had a bad experience once and wont go through, or wont have a friend to help with, actually learning a skill that is meaningful, fun and rewarding in many ways, except for in the eyes of "efficiency" because it's not the same tedious bs that makes the most gp or xp per hour and theres probably no way to change that unless theres a massive shift of how people see parts of the game like pvping. Bh changes were dope though.
---
My bad, I didn't see you were swapping the anguish and tortures. Half asleep.
---
Yeah, swapping capes would be a bigger difference than swapping rings.
---
I personally camp the suffering because the increased defense and prayer plus the recoil is much more useful to me than a minor hit bump. As I'm two or three hitting them on average before they swap styles
---
Sick hard coding, jagex.
---
Nah just the ranger one.
---
Justiciar is saradomin armour not armadyl.
---
Only if you have to donate 500k cash
---
and in the downtime more people could get saved than it being up 24/7. your argument is like saying i wont vote on polls because im only  one person
---
I was in holy invoker too, made it up to silver star in the cc iirc. We'd win like 100% of fights because none of the other teams knew how to pile, those were good times. I wish the casual cwars scene wasn't so dead, I spent months there in f2p when it came out.
---
This is one of the things i hate about osrs. Clan wars is hella dead. They should add it back into the wildy. And add in some armor rewards. Ppl will play anything if you give it halfway decent rewards. ex; pest control and barb assault
---
Radical probability curve bro.
---
From a strategic sense, I think the choice of damage or defence is good. But if this is more of a group activity, which bosses tend to be, I can see random groups getting annoyed at players using ore on defence and slowing down their games when they already had plenty.
---
Or people just don't like pking?
---
The good old days...making the pker think you would step out or running to the bh crater bank
---
I had to bring this fire video to y'all brothers, the wait is over.
---
I think it stems from wanting to support your fav streamer even if you just watch them. Subs go directly to them and supports twitch the platform a rubber Person clearly enjoys. And to someone who works full time 5 bucks may only 15 mins of work for them.
---
 Just my 2 cents
---
But I see where he's coming from. As much as I'd like to report every single GE scammer, it's just not worth the player's time. There are 2-3 in every world, each time I log in. 
---
Darkness of hallowvale is long af too right?
---
Ahh I see. I make it to jad easily but every time the healers come out i end up making a mistake and dieing.
---
What if he’s just using the dramen staff to be stylish 
---
But my respiration was unchanged, so 7% + 0% /2 sample size = 3.5% average, which is practically negligible 
---
I really enjoyed DS2, not MM2 so much
---
YES this has always bothered me
---
Fish have eyes 
---
Is the warrior ring (i) best in slot when training melee at 60 attack while cannoning?
---
Does the added cannon accuracy outweigh the the strength bonus of zerker ring (i)?
---
Major reason for that discrepancy is one is from wildy bosses while the other is from dagkings 
---
Its less square than the majority of osrs.... have you not looked at it in 2 years or something?
---
\^
---
Runelite's "Stretched" mode is what I used when I cared about viewers seeing the UI clearer.
---
Pros: 
---
* Get to keep the full screen experience, but with a larger UI. 
---
* Much easier to control the game.
---
* Better for streaming.
---
Cons: 
---
* The resolution of the icons, chat etc. shows its age when you scale it up.
---
If you can put up with a bit of pixelation, it can be a great set up.
---
Good bot
---
Nah homie is 200m range.
---
Put a fu manchu on the eastern portal. 
---
I disagree. The kill would become impossible unless I started drinking sara brews and restores instead of bringing sharks because i'd run out of food. I think its better to cut your losses and reattempt the spec.
---
So he lost nearly 1/3 of his subs in less than 30 days
---
Lol nice try. But yes, some of the most reliable gp in the game is through slayer. It's not even worth arguing about it's just a simple fact. Hence your downvotes.

Does nobody actually remember playing stealing creations? Because I do. If you weren't playing in a "non combat" stealing creation clan chat, which is how 75% of people played it since that gave more points, then almost every game became 1 team camping the other team at their base with ice barrage 5 minutes into the game. 
---
Stealing creation is atrociously balanced, both the rewards and the actual gameplay. 
---
Dh is probably your best bet. Either way it’s gonna take time
---
Maybe a dragon bucket helm as well? (With stats of D med instead of full)
---
That'll be my video. xD
---
Historically speaking maxed tanks have had 99 prayer (92 pray soul split is the same as 99 cb levels) I chose to do it again despite not having a level 92 prayer because no one my level fights me anyways, so 3 cb levels aren’t that bad; and I’m able to risk more without a fear of being smited (read: Elysian)
---
Obviously many people disagree and say 74-77 so that one is up to you.  In my opinion there’s no right or wrong answer. 
---
&gt;Y'all need Jesus
---
Yeah, it's useful for F2P ironmen. But certainly not for members haha.
---
I started playing at age 8. I guess just monitor  what they say (I remember being incredibly toxic at that age) and tell them about account security, ie not going to websites outside of the main runescape website and the wiki. And to never trust people with their stuff. Scamming and hacking is still unfortunately around but you can take steps to avoid it. Enjoy!
---
Don’t die

🦀
---
It would be amazing if they made this worth while, with small chances at getting an item of loot a dually worth it.
---
People who use the word "problematic" are "problematic" 
---
Well of course that goes without saying.
---
Awesome! What's your in game name? Mine is: xSilentBrad
---
60 attack med with 75 def or if you are a welfare type of guy 65 attack for leaf bladed and stay 70 def is also good 
---
I just scrolled through 4 months of twitter posts and the only thing I saw even slightly out of the ordinary was RS3 posts
---
I guess you see it pretty often in ironmen going for every item simply becuase of how many total chests they do. 
---
Who cares
---
Honestly, starting my ironman F2P was a pain due to all the people/bots. Starting p2p with easy quests for xp and maybe WT at 10hp is what I did and was a blast.
---
Fair enough!
---
&gt; The forge could be amazing if it wasn't unnecessarily tolled while being garbage.
---
What do you mean "being garbage"? It's by far the closest furnace to a bank, and the toll is so minimal that if you can make 30K an hour, it's worth the price.
---
How long you gona be on for
---
I mean shards could be from other gwd drops but the hilt and acb in under 10kc is amazing
---
Thank you! We wanted to keep his character with green skin as that is how he looks in-game, but changed the hue to be slightly darker/blue-er so it wouldnt blend in with the kalphites too much :)
---
Its impossible to be level 126 without all 99 melees
---
That sounds awful, I honestly didn’t think anyone would want that
---
Probably the same waders he uses for duck hunting etc.
---
Plus some people like the aesthetic 
---
Why not remove the Duradel tele from Karamja gloves completely and add it to Slayer cape? That way relevant content = relevant rewards. Also it's a bit odd giving how huge Karamja is that the main perks of the gloves are limited to Shilo. I for one would absolutely love to see Kharazi Jungle tele. Just a thought
---
Geez
---
They don't have zero risk, they're risking their glory 
---
I'm available all evening pretty much.
---
This guy also has posts saying to stop posting swampletics LOL
---
This is sick! And I just happened to the the kalphite princess. New wallpaper for sure. 
---
It's not accessible enough. Pardon but it's been a bit since I tested it, but there's a process going through the door, isn't there? And the bankers not being one-click-bank makes it slightly more inconvenient to use. It just loses against the Edgeville furnace. I never see anyone use the one in Shilo. If it was useful I feel people would use it.

Is Dragon Slayer 2 doable on a mid level Ironman without access to Brews? 75 Range, 70 Pray, 75 Def, 80 HP. Only have DS2 and MM2 left for quest cape. Confident I can do MM2 as I have done it before on my main (albeit with much higher stats.)
---
I would tbh since I’m a lazy fuck who hates holding my phone with 2 hands
---
Nope, the blue thing is what holds the line.

This is just speculation, but probably the camera makes it look farther than it is, and he was shooting at a group of fish and got lucky. 
---
Okay now I know. I’ve been seeing this guy in RuneScape highlight clips left and right and had no idea who he was and why he was being featured so much lol
---
Depending if his hp level is 90+ otherwise obby is better
---
Tbh if you pk at 110+ cb you have to risk like at least a mil minimum to compete with anyone else. If you're with a team you usually won't die very often but still.

God dammit ya beat me to it :(

You sound bitter as heck, chill out dudebro.

Go for barrows gloves and hard diaries. Buy a black mask and train str through slayer
---
I haven’t played in over a year and I have an Ironman without obby so I have no experience with that set up 
---
My main does but my pure doesn’t
---
It saves loads of time. It’s definitely worth getting your own
