If you think Reddit is so trash why do you spend so much time here
---

---
Seriously, if you're actively not having a good time and are just getting upset and pissed off you should stop. It doesn't matter what it is, that's not something you should have in your life. It's very unhealthy.
---
Gzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!

It helps with end game bosses

Reset your password, hopefully you used a real email. Then all will be good, most likely mistaken your password for another constant you use for other things...

“If someone comes I’ll just spam tele and be invincible” solid plan the first 15 seconds

[removed]
---
Imagine thinking mods are there only to ban you and not to help you. Just like the police eh?
---
It's not entirely open source, some parts of the project like the deobfuscator were made private when Jagex were demanding they shut down back in like March or April 2018.
---
I mean you’d know more than I would. Idk if you’re serious and tin hat what if you’re lying! But it would be cool to see something explaining where or how it’s safe besides a blanket “open source” statement. Not that I’m worried I’m more curious and surprised nobody’s laid something out for us casuals to understand.
---
Draw distance, is that how big i can see the world? Either way, what shluld I set it at?
---
Looks like this whole third client shit was rigged from the start.
---
Clues are movement puzzles for me. How do I travel to the place I need to be, what should I have in my inventory at all times, what gets left behind for being too niche, etc. I find that kind of gameplay fun.
---
And thanks!
---
Nice
---
Yes
---
Runelite has always cooperated with jagex and removed any plugins that jagex didnt like.
---
All jagex needs to do is ban clients other than runelite. It worked for ahk. Sure some ppl still use ahk for things other than remapping keys, but most people dont wanna risk their account and wont do it. Same thing will happen here, but other 3rd party clients will die out when not enough people use them because of all the upkeep needed, and everyone will stick to runelite which actually listens to jagex.
---
Yhh boi mem is wavy, just don’t buy it by gp 5.3 is a bit when u starting.
---
I dont approve of the pluginz but you, OP, seem to be an asshat a size too large.
---
we dont want people like you who came back because of mobile and will inevitably move on to the next game in a few months coming in and demanding all these changes. what you are asking for is a huge reason the main game died so no thanks
---
Kids geeking out? Mate I doubt youre much older than the average playing age of the player base at this point.
---
Best content I’ve ever seen.
---
I think I might just do the 10hp pure. For some reason I always found level-3 skillers to be more impressive, but for the sake of my sanity I might stick with 10hp pure.
---
No
---
&gt;it's definitely not a shitty discord, the people who have had bad experiences with it tend to deserve it.
---
Sounds like a shitty discord to me, with shitty people in it. Wow!
---
Sorry didnt mean "kids" like 12 year olds.
---
OSRS was released in 2013; 3rd party clients appeared much before that.
---
Why not run Mac OS? Why run Windows?
---
It's preference. I use Linux on all my machines and prefer it that way. There are many, many things I do not like about Windows.
---
well yeah hopefully, but the fact that other cheat clients seem to have nonexistent ban rates worries me
---
RuneLite does this but since RuneLite is open source other people have made their own forks with the features back in.
---
Alright that's what I think I am going to do. I'll level up some skills keeping it level-3 before moving unto magic for teleports and whatnot. This is a really casual account to afk on while I level my main anyway.
---
Only had one when I went to go change it
---
28k+ members. so yeah. there are definitely some shitty people in it, but there are also a lot of shitty people who play osrs. that's yknow, part of the thing that happens when you run an open discord, anyone can join said open discord.
---
done like 2000 cox, 700 tob -&gt; a good 8-12b in raids over like 1.5 yrs with people i met plus a  decent number of pickup raids. only ran into issues with a handful of people.
---
Then do it?
---
If not then stfu
---
He’s really a boomer...
---
Barbarians, they atm you - leave room when they stop then jump worlds. Best way to AFK combat. Make sure they aint to high to smash through your def n not too low that it’s a k.o.  The Giant spiders hit you no matter what lvl you are. Probably be harder if a pure...
---
Social engineering does exist but to go to that extent is kinda excessive.
---
It is. The maximum seems to be 71. I use 45 but you can max it if you’re on an ok PC. Anti aliasing is pretty self explanatory and the animation smoothing makes everything look less clunky.
---
I mean anything is possible, but it’s not common for open source software to have malicious code. A lot of people have eyes on it. And every change is visible in the commit.
---
Yeah, you're in the middle of a circle, and the higher the draw distance the bigger the circle.  I think the max is 90, it depends what your GPU can take.
---
death grips said no
---
&gt;yay
---
I use arch, btw.
---
Kidding... kind of (Manjaro btw). I remember having to use rsu-client back in the day for RS3/EoC. It worked, but it had issues loading textures and with the cursor. I'd be a little upset if 3rd party clients were banned not only because the official client is god awful, but also because I'd be getting a subpar experience.
---
Need that telegrab.
---
Yeah I don't get the conspiracy theory of it. This happens all the time with open source software, people fork and of course it will remain with a similar name since it's the same piece of software.
---
1 day ban for botting? Press X to doubt
---
Imagine if you died though!
---
How else will I regain Managing Miscellania favor?
---
But i came back in time and in the same world

I'm stuck on the Prince Ali rescue quest, I have all the required items for the rescue and i go to Osman to get the key made (I have the imprint and bronze and coins) and it he just says come back when you have the rest of the items, I go to Leela and she tells me to go to Osman to get thekey imprint made, how do I fix this?
---
Its not instanced your stuff is there in whatever world you died in
---
That reaction though lmao
---
Waiting on somebody to post pics of 4+ of the same brother spawned.  
---
  
---
With a rate of around 1/10 when opening a door, should be possible. Brothers despawn after 10 mins. Monsters no longer spawn after ~4 or so have spawned from that side of the door. You can't attack these monsters while being attacked by the barrow brothers, but you can easily safespot the melee ones in several places. Notably the 4 corner rooms, the NW center tile is the ladder object that NPCs can't go through. So just hide S/N of this and pick off the non-barrow brothers with mage/ranged. Keep spawning brothers until you get your desired result. Also, the brothers despawn if you run too far from where they spawned. Optimal is probably a corner room where you can open many doors.  
---
Tag me if you get 4+ =)
---
Used bet365 a few years ago early in college. I was gonna say it’s probably better for you from a business standpoint to use a betting sites lines
---
Barrows bros have low magic level so you don't need the accuracy.
---
Congrats on the switch! OSbuddy used to be great and I totally understand why you were using it. Hit that settings button in the upper right corner and take an hour or so to get it set up how you like it!
---
I didn't log out or hop to another world
---
Yeah, if I offered evens on every event id go bankrupt fairly quickly lol
---
That's exactly the sort of thing that gets your carpal tunnel lol.
---
Max combat x2 is pretty easy, NMZ is about 30k xp per click
---
Actual max cape x2 is some high tier sweat
---
Lol
---
We need this version of the SOL the one we have in game now is a version from Rs3. The one you have is the original version from Pre-Eoc.
---
Fuck tf2 was my shit back in the day
---
That and agility highlights like runelite has. It’s hard as hell to do agility on mobile, at least for me it is
---
And I'm just saying it's literally been left click in clients for over a year. Osb isn't the first.
---
So that's why they have copy and paste replies because when they try to put a sentence together themselves they make no fucking sense.
---
Its usually 70 prayer and 80+ combat stats for bossing, raids are even higher. Though there are some bosses that you can do easily before 80's (Giant Mole, Sarachnis, Dagannoth Rex, KBD)
---
i'd hate myself just for solely dying to kraken, but if i died with the pet i'd be heated as fuck.
---
Where's Autumn Elegy when you need him now?
---
Go on then. Show us ya minge.
---
Third party clients have simply become part of the norm. I really don't see how MES to one click bank at rogues den (or anywhere) is a big deal. To say it impacts skilling in any meaningful way aside from being less annoying is just being silly. 
---
I feel like you're just being pedantic for the sake of riling people up or to argue.
---
If you think it ruins nostalgia I hope you’ve voted no to damn near every update.
---
Found the OSBuddy user.
---
This was me yesterday. I was trying to level crafting and decided to make some birdhouse because big brain me realized I could profit from it. But it’s like 100k gp/hr profit and 30k crafting xp.
---
I did it for probably 5 inventories before I realized I should just go do 5 trips or Vorkath and I could do d’hide bodies and still be better off for it.
---
Is there a spot I can practice tick manipulation with the Cannon? i.e. gaining no combat xp from first hit of a cannon shot..
---
Level 3 skiller looking to start farming Mogres (yes I have sufficient slayer)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or would simply creating a new account, slapping a bond on him and practicing there on a separate account be better? (yes my only account is a 3 skiller)
---
It is if you get a drop lol
---
or Varrock tele to GE
---
We unironically have this in rs3
---
I'm not on right now, but check out the friends chat "porphyrin" they used to be a BA clan so there's almost always a few people down to play
---
I don't like any kind of op plugins that make the game easier idc what client it is
---
you got so mad because i told you to quit playing runescape that you went through my post history? lmfao too bad i dont care enough to look through yours or i could ruin your whole week loooool
---
Wow it must be crazy playing the entire game exactly tick perfect.

Don't you have to charge the book with pages, making it kinda expensive to use compared to the steam staff?

Go to the gym before you allow yoursef to nerd log 2 times per day and you’ll feel better! :)

What? I’m just saying why utilize time on something that he would never have the time to fully enjoy
---
WDR has a zero kicks rule, even if someone is inting. You're obligated to finish the raid if you can, then screenshot and report the inter. They'll likely be banned instantly if it was egregious, otherwise just a strike against them.
---
I've had two people I needed to report, but one of them left and neither of the two of us remaining knew how to duo, so we agreed to bail on the raid and reported him. It was his third strike for doing that so he got banned.
---
WDR does allow house rules if everyone agrees to them before the raid. For example "FFA tbow, split else" but you gotta have a screenshot of everyone agreeing.
---
WDR does not allow "we all hate this guy. Fuck him."
---
Nothing’s preventing some Jagex employees from stealing login info
---
I found galvek to be a extremely slow paced fight aslong as you keep moving to avoid his stupid one shot mechanics the rest of his attacks are pretty light

A lot of good suggestions here if ur looking for kinda high production value generate rask and lower the better are series i liked in a different but kinda similar style even tough the content in itself isn't region locked ironmen
---
Because Mod Infinity was a well respected member of the community, and everyone trusted what he said to be the truth. /s
---
He only hit 0 three times.
---
&gt; All the vanilla client needs is the performance upgrades &amp; the features to address disabilities that have already been mentioned in the thread. The rest are secondary or irrelevant outside of dumbing down the game.
---
Won't work, because the disabled individuals who have commented on this thread don't really want that compromise, they just want everything to remain completely unrestricted. So you can't please them by offering a perfectly reasonable alternative which lets them keep the accessibility features they need while blocking regular users from cheating.
---
Someone link me the template
---
Whats your combat lvl with the 60 prayer?
---
Lol why do redditors get so upset when someone takes a pic of their screen instead of a screenshot

Ah a fellow WG member

Why don't they implement lootshare again to prevent this.

Fuck yeah they do, he probably pays her 5m on the hour
---
Dis my favorite meme format
---
Judge Judy wouldn't be able to help you.
---
So you know you're in the wrong.
---
Shame though, hope you can find new raid friends.
---
Has been, but they haven’t decided to push OP plugins and go rogue up until now. You really think if everything was fine Jagex would wait to issue a statement saying as such?
---
Yes it's literally just like the police
---
No, they can clearly define what they consider to be game breaking and any client that breaks those rules can be ask to remove those problems or be shut down. It’s really not that hard.
---
The Unicorn is probably the least killed NPC in all of OSRS.
---
Nope, still not reached my first 99 mining yet. Also these are all skilled on a PC, manually.
---
I mean if he has 10 accounts all with 99 wc he's either botting or he needs professional help.
---
Then I revert to previous argument where they literally said they would not mass ban players for using a client they don't believe is wrong. Osb creates have said they spoke with jagex before release so around the argument caresal we go.
---
BiS nipples.
---
I’m not your OSbuddy, OSguy!
---
This is really really good. Very simple but fashionable
---
The fact that ive been using bots with the script paused for the past 15 years just for the xp tracker says something.
---
Lmao no idea, must be sacrilegious or something akin
---
Between this and clicking the wrong teleport on my dueling rings.
---
I thought that my laptop was too shitty for a 3rd party.
---
Yes, but the official RuneLite client doesn’t contain it. People will always go out of their way to mod things in a way to gain an advantage.
---
The real big brain move is to just tele to waterbirth island from your house. It sends you right next to the boat to relekka so it’s actually faster than talking to someone on lunar isle
---
A good thing to do when you're stuck on a quest is to check the in-game quest log.
---
I just started a HCIM and am trying to pickpocket men for gp, but when I pickpocket them I am only getting xp and not the 3gp. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Don't be so dramatic. The difference between 73850 and 80k is nothing that significant.
---
He was pressured into ordering a hit on rappers that he himself didn't like? That's a fucking stretch. Listen to his breakfast club interview he really did believe he was one of them.
---
I'm not confident Jagex can even reliably detect these types of client-side features.
---
Say good bye to the rest of your life my friend lol a humble beginning for a lifetime adventure
---
How the turntables.
---
Just hit 85 slayer, been using [this spreadsheet](https://i.imgur.com/wUz7Nxb.png) to dictate which tasks I skipped, extended, etc. and I've found it work work fairly well outside of a few things.
---
It says to outright block Abyssal Demons, which I was pretty excited to finally unlock. Do you guys agree with that? I haven't been assigned an Abby Demon task yet, but they seem pretty great for the same reasons that Nechs and Dust Devils are (bursting them in the Catacombs). Why would I block them?
---
Also: I just hit 100% Shayzien favor, is it worth it to unlock Lizardmen to kill Shamans on task?
---
Dovydas jr
---
You could maybe complete half of vampire slayer and practice on count draynor? Not sure if you can place a cannon down there though
---
imagine forgetting your pickaxe when going to mine XD I even have 420 in my name and dont do that :P
---
Well declaring bankruptcy takes time and loads of courts get involved in it since you have to prove you cant pay whatever you're running.
---
You can't just say "oh im bankrupt go next" stuff needs to be aproved by judges
---
I didn't downvote you, but you lack perspective and it's not hard to see why people would downvote this elitism. If your best money maker is 3-10mil/h gp/xp doesn't matter. If your best money maker is 250k-1mil/h it very much matters. Not everyone is maxed.
---
Sry, you missing the quest requirement to run this bot.
---
TIL, a 7k player count difference is seen as drastic and cause for panic. Lmaooo
---
Had a friend doing this showed me that developer even made a phone app so you could watch the progress from wherever you were. Watched the bot complete several dungeons and got 450kexp in one class.
---
Chinese overlords don't give a fuck about reddit outrage. I love RS3 bossing more than anything in osrs, but I quit 2 years ago after realizing that the mtx and delayed or shitty updates would only get worse.
---
You'd all be better off accepting it's over and quitting
---
I take them for when I have to heal fast suddenly.. and easier so eat a lot after I killed the spawn.
---
1. Ardy tele, boat to brimhaven is reasonably quick. Or just keep your house in brimhaven
---
2. At 41 farming, definitely toadflax. The high seed price and low yield of ranarr at low farming levels is going to cut into your profit a lot, toadflax will be much safer and very likely better profit overall.
---
3. Birdhouse runs are decent for money, decent for xp. Great for passively leveling while doing other dailies which is (imo) the main reason to do them
---
Maybe it's time companies stopped playing life on easy mode, sounds like an easy way to abuse workers before starting over again.
---
I wonder how much of this actually equates to the direction OSBuddy is going
---
That's untrue.
---
There are solid contenders like this [frog.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Plague_frog)
---
Edgy
---
Honestly it's a pleasant surprise to hear more from you haha, I like the ideas you're presenting here 👍
---
Are you getting coin pouches?
---
Why people keep asking this in this thread, as if any of us could possibly have any clue when/if Jagex is gonna decide to do something?
---
Like I get we're all worried/annoyed about it, but we all gotta just wait and see.
---
I tried EOC quite a few times. Was actually excited about t when it was announced. The game just wasn’t the same game I had fallen in love with so many years before. It felt like a knockoff World of Warcraft almost. So that’s where I went, played WoW a lot. Tried EOC every once in a while still. Tried legacy when that was introduced. It just didn’t feel the same. That’s what’s great about osrs in my mind, it’s the game I’ve loved for almost 15 years. RS3 is fine, but it’s not the same, and I’m not interested in continuing that part of my account.
---
I genuinely hope you stopped leveling thieving here. Just make it a 1 thieving acc with the rest maxed.
---
Oak planks are like 7 gp/xp currently, off the top of my head
---
Figure out how much xp you need and multiply it by 7
---
I would make a bunch of new accounts just to run through the stronghold of security just to give the 10k to my main
---
It's ok I also enjoy the garden, I've used it numerous times on various pking accounts to do DT back in the day.
---
XP rates might not be as good but it doesn't make me want to kill myself so I'll take it
---
Badass as fuck lmao
---
I played a fair bit of rs3 before coming to osrs as well, and I feel the same way. And even though I hated dungeoneering when I was grinding it, I miss it! Lol
---
People still use osbuddy after all those botting and hacking scandals? What did you think was going to happen?
---
I think osrs is fineif you view it like a clicker game. I have been layering it w/ real games and have been having a great time
---
For pure efficiency, probably spam clicking
---
For the sake of your hand, just click after a few seconds. You might lose like a tick of time every so often but that's like ultra sweat levels of minmaxing
---
That spreadsheet is purely for the fastest xp possible while maintaining near 0 point gain for 200m slayer.  Do abby demons for fun, I believe they're near the top for fast xp, just not the fastest possible.
---
Absolutely not
---
Would love it but community hates it, wish they just bring the monsters for pvp dont care for bobs tbh
---
you're also probably gonna get banned buddy.
---
Nice dude, glad you are having fun
---
Tbf you should only go into WDR if you are learning. After that stage you should look into other cc's because WDR is quite toxic
---
I fear god, and I fear this.
---
More power to you boss. Lmk if you need anything
---
this makes no sense, using your middle mouse button has no impact on where u place your left hand whatsoever
---
Well in the past he was off pushing the boundaries of AHK scripts which were basically this stuff with a few extra steps while simultaneously complaining about new and interesting content that added small buffs to xp/h like a massive hypocrite.
---
So hopefully he has his mouth shut now and keeps it that way.
---
Why?
---
Well, Jagex did for a fact cut down on antibotting (mod Acorn used to help mod Weath), and since the overlords don't seem to care a lot they *might* just see bots as some extra cash in their pockets. Although plausible, that's still just speculation
---
What I don't see is how this game would be dying, nor what OSB has to do with all of this and especially I can't figure out how the dots are supposed to connect
---
Oh yeah, I am haha. I'm an idiot. Damn it's tough to see things on mobile though. Thank you!
---
Bursting in the catacombs is aids, they keep teleporting you and themselves around so you have to be constantly clicking
---
Don't unlock fossil wyverns as in buy the block for them, costs like 500 slayer points iirc

Don't think shamans are efficient to do but I don't have first hand experience with them.

I make my RS-like models over a rip of the default character model in Metasequoia; it's a pretty basic and lightweight program that perfectly suffices when it comes to the basic work that the OSRS artstyle poses.

This is going to sound really dumb, but I hate how you lose ammo and how you have to pick it up afterwards, I do use Ava's so that helps a quite a lot. I know it's dumb but honestly just a pet peeve of mine for some reason

I'm 100% switching to WoW or just not playing if RuneLite gets axed in any way.
---
Cannon is definitely one of the smartest choices I think you can make. If you have the slayer level to use broad bolts there's a place on the island of Neitiznot where you can safespot from being some mining rocks and set up your cannon near them for some great exp. If you bring runes to alch and use tele grab you can easily pay off you cannon balls and even make a few hundred k profit per trip. 
---
I'll usually bring like 5k cannon balls and spend an hour or two. It basically just turns into a game of defend the cannon and keep and eye out for granite shield or rune item drops
---
Plenty of people have done it under 80 mage, pretty much just git gud. Are you splashing a lot, or something? What about the boss is giving you the most trouble?
---
I think you’re fundamentally misunderstanding why people bot. It’s for monetary gain.
---
yes. it is within me \_o(-_-)o_/

Never I hope.
---
Agreed. It's a 2 for 1. But just having to left click the altar is what...5 for 1?? It's a HUGE difference. IMO, some of the menu entry swappers are OP. You can't compare a 2 for 1 action to a 5 to 1 though. It's a completely different situation. People did this with AHK years ago...you could literally press 1 key and it would do everything for you. Didn't turn out so well for AHK users. OSB is dying and wants to take everyone else out with them.
---
This is magnificent. Its even a 3d model.

Hi this is your boss, get back to work before I take away your means to provide to your children.

Tree runs will not make profit, they are purely for xp. I wouldn't recommend you do normal tree runs unless you have plenty of money and want to rush a level for some quest/diary or something.

Pegasian boot, armadyl top and bottom, necklace of anguish, blowpipe, rigour. It's definitely doable without the armadyl and pegasians but I think blowpipe, rune darts, anguish, and rigour are all pretty necessary to skip consistently.

---
Force yourself to exercise, either at a gym if you can, or walking, riding a bike, running, etc. Do it when there's sunlight out there.
---
Decide what you want to do and divide it into small day sized bits, you can't play before today's goal is done.
---
Force yourself to talk to people, eventually you will find people that like you
---
the fight isn’t hard. If I had enough time I could kill it np. It’s the fact that by the time I’m all out of brews I’ve only done 450 damage of their 1000 hp. I splash maybe 1/3 of the time? using mystic, seers ring, b gloves, glory, ancient/iban staff.

When you merge servers and make combat a cakewalk disney ride adventure whilst shitting on all of your old content it makes for a very bad time.

You probably just weren't good enough to enjoy classic.

Just learn solos 🤔😅

Digging the style. Hope to see more.

Training

When I started the shield of arrav quest, I ran all over varrock asking people to be my partner for 30 minutes until some dude goes “Bro just join the mini game chat.” Blew my mind
---
Gz man. Started playing again around mobile release. Was on PC when someone at the GE handed me 2.5m worth of stuff. Huge boost of startup cash and I’ve been playing ever since. Never hurts to have some help!
---
~150 people seem to care, why do you think you can speak for them?
---
Therapy, it’d be good for someone like you.
---
tournament worlds with no reset on login, no rules server
---
we got terrible support for the game, a map that’s been delayed since june, multiple bugs including visibility, hit detection, and a whole lot more. it’s the reason i stopped playing bfv and cane here
---
I'm alright with that
---
which I did sea slug for 1-24 or whatever it is and I accidentally caught one more after it.
---
So the stats of it were:
---
1/443072 (according someone on discord)
---
8085 xp
---
920 xp gained for pet.
---
the fucking an 11 year old meme, classic I guess??
---
But ornate pools are totally a-okay.
---
Still look like to have a eco think not everything  should be spawnable
---
I think seers course is fastest even without diary, but pollnivneach may be faster at 70
---
Uninstall please, thanks
---
I don't even use Linux but come on there's an option for it in RS3  [https://www.runescape.com/download](https://www.runescape.com/download) They added that late even when the daily count for RS3 players is 1/3 of that on OSRS.
---
thanks kiss
---
I don't use the client for anything outside of graphics updates. I basically only slay. No need for plug anyways.
---
Yeah but there is solution for cheating, disallowing clients. And yeah there are lots of ways to use other client's if jagex "bans" them
---
What do rates are you getting with void?
---
What a trip of a thread
---
There is a 0% chance any poll making it easier for pkers to kill people who just want to pvm will ever pass. If you want content related to pvp then you’re gonna have to think outside the box. It’s just reality. The majority of people don’t want it. I have no problem with pkers but the problem is not fixable, and they are in the minority. So compromise or move on
---
I’m leaving my gf for bigfartguy
---
Wow I’m just a mobile player thinking here , y’all PC runelite OSbuddy user are soiled asf try and the vanilla client for a day and say !kc bandos instead of right click on your ring of wealth and looking it up like everyone else etc etc it’s just funny how y’all need runelite osbuddy to hold y’all hands for shit

Just add auto-clicker as a feauture already smh
---
## bruh 🔥🔥😫👏🤣
---
Thats what wprld 1 was my man
---
Santa is in the game for a reason my guy
---
Birdhouse runs and farming contracts are where I got mine. They’re on the drop table for various mobs, but I don’t know of any that are super farmable.
---
Yes you can. You just now have to press 2 buttons instead of 1.
---
Spam click and spam your F key for inventory while having the game in resizeable with the stones along the bottom and allowing F keys to close your interface.
---
Line the knight up with your inventory square, spam both keys. Lowers your XP rate a bit compared to pre-coin pouch but it's still entirely black screen spammable for 6 hours at a time.
---
Hasn't happened so far
---
Thanks for telling me about that. :)

What does this have to do with creating new pvp content?

---
Should of gone in and spawned in a room of moving eyes smh
---
I am not, but I've made YouTube videos before, like 10 years ago.
---
Lmao. Best one so far
---
😂😂
---
no
---
its more bot like that u click 66-73 times every minute for 6hours straight than it is to rise from 70 to 100 for a few minutes lol.
---
magic is real
---
I imagine they wouldn't want to be employed by Jagex per se but they might be open to Jagex sponsoring their project and conducting code reviews etc.
---
The vast majority of bots are actually gold farmers that intend to RWT. Since the gold on these bot servers would have significantly less value, the gold farmers would simply continue botting on regular servers.
---
The minority that bots for stats probably would not be interested in a server-locked account, I think. Without the social aspect of the game, there is no point in botting other than accessing high-level content easily, which I think is not too hard to reach without botting anyway.
---
Arent so lucky huh?
---
Hey congrats! I also completed dragon slayer 2 on my ironman today! Can’t wait for you to get to this point because this quest was sick.
---
I got my feef Cape legitimately, fucking months of thieving, towards the end was getting absolutely sick of clicking buttons but totally worth it in the end. Cheaters can never get that feeling of accomplisment
---
Its not OP unless it does it in one click tho
---
Exactly how do you think Jagex can do anything about without serious consequences? “Jagex Please do somethig, anything. This is ridiculous.” If by anything they ban all 3rd party clients and make enjoying OSRS impossible the game wont exist much longer.
---
You use the stones to make the stones
---
It honestly is so nice for some things. I could not do thieving without my autoclicker.
---
Ah ok I didn't read it
---
Bucket? Ugh you reddit casuals! Just shit in your pants and slt in that for two hours while not even reaching the first place in skill.
---
You could just take the next challenge and learn to solo CoX.
---
I run on 10.14
---
Bruh thats lit
---
??? They've done so before with bot clients, aswell as OSHD. Its called cease and desist. All properties of Runescape belongs to Jagex, osbuddy is using them because Jagex allows them to, which can quickly change.
---
They help you get to olm and do the raid quicker, and thats where the big points are.
---
He lost his points that could have been a purple for him, and he lost the split you agreed upon 
---
Even so I still dont think OP is likely to scam again, as long as there are not toxic people, even if there are it seems like he has learnt to mute and just finish instead of kicking, and he sees what the fallout of the PvM community would do if he gets tempted to kick/scam an item.
---
Give him X amount of weeks, he is alsready on gold terms with the flamer, why even have the strikes if there are no 2nd chances?
---
Ah yes, all the singles teams I run into got their focuser rocking wizzy (g)
---
I kid, but I can understand where the other guy was coming from in terms of the gear choice. Still obviously representing a pker though, it's art not a gear guide
---
Not sure about the client you're referring too but I know 2 people who used left-click blackjack and got perm banned. one was a maxed zerk
---
That's not true. I remember a lot of streamers making a big deal out of it.
---
And yak requires you to have 96 summoning. The most it did was extend trips and bank bones, both of which is possible in OSRS by using mule accounts, and people do abuse that to camp godwars. 
---
Ornate pools are equally OP in that it enabled solo corp and is meta defining at other bosses that you can quickly reach (sire, vorkath, etc). For the record I don't mind content that makes other things easier, especially if it's locked behind high end requirements, but there is a clear double standard when it comes to things that RS2/RS3 had.
---
Just to make a point, you justify the clue scrolls and CoX scouting by saying it’s repetitive and boring, so therefor the plugins should be legal.. you know what else is repetitive and boring? Right clicking bones and using them on an altar.
---

Dude, this one is the straw that broke the camels back, tomorrow i get back to the tredmill.  I went from 220 -&gt; 185 lbs and am hovering at 190, have been like that for a while.  My goal was always 180 and now I’ll finally get that done.  Beats RC anyway
---
This is why thieving is one of my favourite skills.
---
It was like 13k when I checked yesterday, if you’re actually wondering.

Ugh EZScape it is

what
---
Damn. Someone got up on the wrong side of the bed.
---
uhh no, that’s ava’s assembler which you need ds2 to get, whilst the accumulator drops 8% of ammo used i’m pretty sure
---
I have all quests but MM2, DS2, and SOTE complete. I also have all medium diaries and most hard diaries complete. I have 66 RC with 75% of all my lamps and tears going towards RC.
---
Your honesty is refreshing. I hope Jagex makes the right decision, because I definitely don’t know what it is.
---
Awesome, thank you! I will have to get on the grind!
---
No thats not how reality works or they would of done that so so long ago. What you claim is at best a vague threat. Also you miss the big picture of they attack 3rd party clients without spending time and money making the regular client functional to what players expect and want which they are not willing to do it took years to get a in game map.
---
Dude the current one is AWFUL. Running a necro is actually frying my gpu

Mmm a slayer helm with aviators.
---
Delicious.
---
Little did she know that she wont see you again for 3 years :( rip
---
I don't know how you have lived that long without daily battlestaves lol
---
Not true. Stuff like god wars items will plummet, as will raid items. Do you know how easy it would be to solo Cox or tob with a summoning pet? BiS would crash HARD. Bandos/armadyl would be extremely cheap within a month.
---
Bring staff to autocast it and just switch to staff
---
I can see rhat undrank quit alot. Even if there are people that dont want to grind thia isnt execuae to make servers that would encourage bot and would probably have effect on the "main" servers since people would say "why would i train rc if they can bot" and that is only if u look at it as preoblem of people dont wanting to grind and at that point thoae people ahould ask them self  if they actualy like runescape and or if they should move to another game. And as for boting for gold this does nothing.

---
Just give me the bunyip and nobody gets hurt.
---
That’s exactly what I did at 61. Logged out. Logged in the next morning and did it easy peasy. Sounds are everything.
---
Why? I enjoy how I experience the game now. What do I have to gain from using a broken client.
---
Never cared about it lol. Im 98 slayer now and I don't do any daily farm/herb runs either anymore (89 farming tho). Don't play much anymore though
---
I hit the limit a couple times buying cosmic runes, went down the entire list about 4 times before I hit it though
---
Raid the master farmers POH, he can’t stop us all.
---
Sorry but there's a reason they all only have like 1kish views
---
I got it with ardy knights. I oddly enjoyed it lol. It was kinda fun for some reason.
---
From my own experience, Bgs spec makes more of a difference than arclight spec - higher accuracy and higher damage.
---
yeah i got 2 hydra tails in the bank that are 99.55544206973% useless
---
Is that actually faster than using your own house in a pvp world?
---
You can also do it in f2p
---
Swampswamp make my wewe tingle
---
Soul game good, swampman good
---
My defense used to be “I don’t care about the personal satisfaction of individually grinding these levels because they’re only a means for me to complete quests and experience the cool content that actually matters”. I’ve PvPed maybe three or four times since initially picking the game up ~13 years ago so I’ve never seen how this negatively impacts other players. 
---
Now my defense is nothing because I don’t see it as something that I need to defend.
---
Tbh probably just turn into a loan rally if white sheet costumes were allowed.
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---

Tru its already out, release it on runeline vanilla now :)

(xp target - xp start) / 60 * (cost of oak plank) + about 1 gp per xp for the butler

Well OP doesn't have a GF, since it's his wife
---
Just introduce invention as an unlock to a post SoTE quest where you literally harvest the fragment of seren you killed to replace the divination aspect rs3 uses. 75 crafting+smith+runecrafting to unlock since you need knowledge of leather working, metal smithing, and magic imbuement to incorporate this new technique to all of your equipment. Bam, you got the lore+base for an osrs item sink.
---
They have an audio team; however, I do believe Mod Ash creates some of the sound tracks, and they are actually really good.  It's nice to have an older influence on OSRS to.. err keep it osrs.
---
Yes bring a BGS or a DWH.
---
Arclight, if hits, only really resuces the defensive stats by 10%.
---
Bgs, if hits, reduces defence by the amount you hit.
---
DWH, if hits more than a 0, reduces defence levels by 30%.
---
Is that Justin Trudeau
---
You can disable everything except gpu rendering and animation smoothing. Then you can add things as you want, like xp and loot tracker. I didn't think I would care for it, but now I can't see why I would go back
---
I'd much sooner trust an ex bot client that has personally worked with jagex than some sketchy freeware.
---
Better than making an edit
---
They havent what? Shut down clients? Uhhh...i literally just mentioned OSHD...which Jagex shut down...
---
As i already said, if they have a REASON to shut them down, they can. Before now, everyone were loving 3rd party clients (and still are to an extent), if Jagex were to just shut down those clients for no good reason, the community would be pissed. Why would Jagex want to piss off their community for no good reason? As i already mentioned, they threatened to shut down Runelite UNTIL the community got wind of it and created a shitstorm on social media, at which point Jagex changed their mind.
---
You may have heard this saying before, its repeated pretty often... "If the community wants it.." Well, the community did not want them to shut down Runelite, so they didnt.
---
Was expecting crab rave
---
But why are some old school methods designed better than others? Why isnt it consistent across the board?
---
I dont need to right click a tree, select cut tree, confirm I want to cut it just to swing an axe. it's a one click feature.
---
just because a bad design is how it was implemented during the dial up era doesnt mean we need to be happy with extremely clunky methods to skill that artificially make it click intensive and highly unenjoyable.
---
If it was released today no one would vote for him lmao
---
I recently hit 85 farming and just ginished my Con grind a few days later. I use the Spirit Tree all the time to restock: tele house, pool, spirit to farming guild, spirit back to house, tele where I need to go.
---
I don’t know y’all but I ship y’all hardcore
---
These posts get more and more interesting.
---
Agree mostly, but rs3 is a completely different game than rs2. Rs2 is dead and people who invested tons of time into it got burned when they made the changes they did (although they could end up transferring their wealth to osrs.)
---
I've seen some idiots.
---
Tbh delete all third party clients they're un needed
---
Look at what this era of video game of grinding did to all of you. When we played video games back then (not only talking about RuneScape), we did not have these tools. We did not need them. Grinding and efficiency was such a big thing back then. We still had lots of fun during then. 
---
I would be curious to know why video games went from pure fun all of the time to fun, but grindy at times.
---
Probably gave away his Reddit account too
---
Yes it's really easy to get to. Makes getting to 99 all the more convenient.
---
For people that do multiple herb runs a day, that 10 seconds per tile can add up to several minutes a day. Probably an hour raking each month.
---
Considering 2 runs of tithe farm (all you need for auto weed) takes about 50 minutes, that's literally faster than the amount of time spent raking in a single month.
---
Also, you free up an inventory space, and most importantly, you don't have to deal with the annoyance of having weeds grow back right as you're planting.
---
The only reason to not have auto weed is if you literally never farm anything, ever. Or if you're a masochist.
---
Yet you're okay with releasing absolutely broken plugins that are destroying the game atm. 
---
Ty.
---
I love how everyone is giving you tips like you haven’t played runescape before. Gratz on the achievement. Add me IG if you want to chat or do some bosses once you get higher level, Joosey
---
Remember, we did not have that stuff back in the old days of RuneScape, yet we still had so much fun. If you quit because a tool is removed, then it sounds like you don't truly love Runescape, but rather, you feel forced to play it.
---
lmao nice

Deal with it.
---
I dont know if they will just stop when told to tho
---
It should be obvious to the makers of OSB that these plugins are too much so Im pretty sure theyre doing it on purpose.
---
Jagex cant realistically see the difference between osb users and runelite users which is why people are afraid that OSB is trying to take RL with them
---
Reminds me of when I was streaming osrs for the first time, I was training melee at rock crabs and a guy in chat asked what world I was in. Came to rock crabs and gave me a full set of rune, a rune scim and a million gp. One of the nicest guys I've met on osrs.

My friend, it's time to hit the tree patches.

---
Balance training that's amazing lol
---
Sorry, I mean QoL, like quality of life changes they’ve done.
---
If this is the case then jagex should just remove clues completely. Or change them so that they give you the answers straight away.
---
Sure, but you only have to glance at your monitor for a fraction of a second, if that. You can read or watch just about anything at the same while bary losing xp, or even play another game on the side as long as it’s something simple that only requires a mouse.
---
Mostly agree. Some of the plugins are too far and some are ok imo
---
The first result I get says that its allowed so if you wanna dig deeper than the first link to find a source that alligns with your argument then please do
---
This made me bust out laughing at work

I know this is EZscape.. but what if he also noted what you harvested too?

if u dont manage to mine the rock on the first tick u still need to move onto the next rock and keep the rhythm going

First came the spake, a combination of the rake and spade. Then it was the spakibber, adding a seed dibber, and then someone added a bucket, making it a spakibberket. Now someone added the cape.
---
I don't think there really is a joke, people have just been adding layers to something that was silly in the first place and making it even more hilarious.
---
Well they have met the bare minimum which is enough for them. Also seems that this is where the problem stems from.
---
ironman here... I just hit 78 today, was 70 when i got this clue last week... I got a couple more days then I will boost to enter this area . :-)
---
Ditto what others are saying, runelite actually runs better than the default client if you tinker with the settings.
---
I vaguely remember reading about a mod responding on this and ultimately deciding against it.
---
Tornado bad. Swamp man good.
---
Love summoning as a skill, but the power creep is astounding, which makes me glad it’s not in OS. It’s impossible to boss without a specific summoning familiar in RS3 - you simply cant output enough damage or bring enough supplies. Encounters become balanced around a new, much higher meta.
---
Alright, quick google search, jagex terms and conditions, here you go. " You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify any Jagex Product  client software in any way (except to the extent allowed by applicable  law). You must not use a modified/customised version of the client  software or attempt to copy, transfer or sub-license it.

Heres from the rules of Runescape: "Types of disallowed third-party software

Are we done yet?
---
Nice gl!
---
Lmao cheaters always pull this one "Yeah I must just play like a bot, thats it!" you arent fooling anyone, botter
---
Well when you downplay it like that it doesnt sound bad but we both know there are a lot more plugins that are a little more questionable than just those. 
---
3rd party clients used to be against the spirit of the game but we all know the spirit of RS died along time ago. 
---
I dont care if other people use them but I see how it ruins the nostalgia for some people.
---
“Discussion”

No this is not needed

Or the herbs 😉😉😉😉
---
A wise owl once told me not to trade items to strangers you dont want to lose forever
---
Yeah but what if I've left my spakibberket in the bank after doing a clue? Unless he can access my bank hes not useful.
---
Okay, sorry then
---
What about mobile only ironman btw
---
That would be an extremely steep risk, I guess if cats weren't a possibility, one might want to insure their pet for a mil, go to f2p, die, and go back to members, fee for getting back a lost skill pet is half a mil. Not terrible, but not as cheap as kittens either
---
We need more mods like mat k with passion and a longevity look towards

I found agility much more ergonomic on mobile. No need for highlights at all. I got 99 agility last week btw.
---
The Lighthouse!
---
This. The construction skill has amazing advantages but spamming 1 and 4 for hours on end isn't fun in any way. I think jagex needs to look at the repetition of skills and see how they can adjust it without giving any additional xp/hr.
---
Would never pass a poll, dumb idea
---
People use alts to run supplies, veng, all that shit at it is. Super sweaty players will always use alts as BoBs anyway, summoning just levels the playing field. Also, 28 inventory slots sucks. Making some duo content soloable isnt a bad thing.

GPU plugin came out last year. You didn't play before then?

If you have time, here's [a short article about why *porting to Linux* is the wrong way to go](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/cnirwo/porting_games_to_linux_is_a_waste_of_time_this/). I understand that at this point in time it may be hard for Jagex, but the game is written in Jave, not .NET or other proprietary languages.

Why would it be bannable? You can use mouse in the desktop version, why not Mobile?
---
Still better financials than your government
---
u really have to use an xsession? pathetic lol
---
You ever heard of hypocrisy? Jagex is full of it. 
---
Take a look at Runescape, as in, that other game. The game is littered with MTX for Jagex to make money, because after all, that is the end goal of a company, especially a company that is run by investors. 
---
In the case of osrs, introducing MTX would (as most would predict) result in a profit loss, due to the majority of players quitting. That is the reason they do not make that change, aswell as many other changes (such as banning third party clients), it would lose profit. In the case of investors, they will usually pull out as soon as there is no more growth, and then go invest in another company instead. This is how alot of gaming companies especially, turn incredibly greedy all of a sudden. They need to constantly make more money to appease them.
---
Is this the first online game you've ever played?
---
Yeah...was waiting with the same master clue for months until I finally got 85 magic and slayer to reanimate an abyssal, got that done and a couple steps after that, 4th step...craft a light orb. 85 fuckin crafting, which would cost me around 15mil, at least magic and slayer are both really useful :/

See you in around 3 years when I finally get around to that one Sherlock

Yea absolutely, sometimes I do get bored, I either switch skill, or switch apps altogether, YouTube videos do not require too much attention, movies and series aren't so great though, reddit works, I can gaze back and forth in between comments

6ix9ine is a criminal rapper who got caught on several federal charges(racketeering and something with assault and guns). He is currently cooperating with the feds and throws other people under the bus to reduce his own sentence. Other rappers are joking that he will say anything if it reduces his own sentence and say he is snitching.
---
yeah it still exists, just massively extended.
---
drop it then if you dont plant to do it. dropped 3 master (2x 90 wc, 1x 85 magic+slayer)
---
Wasn't RuneLoader busted for this exact thing?
---
If you say Jagex are hypocrites why bother asking them to do anything as they clearly don’t care or do anything in a reasonable logical manner.
---
Everything in this game is solo content nothing is hard except ToB/Cox and neither of those are hard once you have a few clears behind you
---
Hi I would just like to say that WDR literally teaches people raids for free. Id also like to say that with the sheer number of raids and things that happen in the server there are bound to be negative things that happen every once in a while, but it shouldnt invalidate the entire server.
---
I personally got the most use out of the brimhaven patch as I never really needed the others, and it was super useful getting to the fruit tree patch. If you do a lot of questing or use charter ships frequently then port sarim might be better, otherwise I'd go for brimhaven
---
For hespori I'd just upgrade your dscim to a whip and you should be fine. Use buff potions and pray piety and hespori should go down fairly quick even at your stats. You can eat during the snare attack to avoid losing out on DPS. Also there's no need to use blowpipe on the flowers as they always die in one hit, so I'd recommend using super cheap darts or knives instead
---
you chose to limit yourself
---
100% this. People are forgetting that players would pay others to leech their loot share while they bursted places for the charms and the shards were the best gp sink the game had ever seen. Not to mention making a lot of items throughout the game valuable as secondaries. People cry about titans and packyacks in the high 90s but I doubt most of them had those levels to see what it cost in gold/time to get. Collecting that many charms was insane and would be more crazy without the double charm/double xp weekend rs used to do. Also without overloads and chaotics the familiars wouldn't extend pvm trips nearly as long as they used to.
---
spade + rake = spake
---
where can i see when they make this tool banable?
---
Which means Jagex makes double subscribtion money off of those players...Why would they take that away?
---
Also, what duo content isnt soloable exactly? ToB is soloable even. Ironmen HAVE to solo things like GWD and other bosses and it really is not that hard. All of those bosses can have rather extended trips in solos, either through ranging (pures will typically range bandos e.g) or by using blood barrage for healing off the minions after the kill. Even without flicking you can get multiple kills per trip, i dont see the issue.
---
It's easy like high alching. You can just click and watch a show, maybe looking every so often.

wtf is that on his head
---
Extra sub money from sweeties. You're 100% right and the kid arguing with you saying everyone had 96 summ like they did 95 pray is forgetting that charms werent buyable. Shit took a long time and a lot of money.

---
Prison is good for rappers, they get inspiration from there.
---
If you want one ASAP you can turn in mole skins/claws for bird nests, but this will probably cost a decent chunk of money. Otherwise go with birdhouse runs and farming contracts. If you have some extra time, you can also put your Miscellania workers on maples to get a ton of bird nests from that. You can also farm Zulrah if you want it ASAP as she drops them fairly often.

This is the thing, Jagex don't have a problem with these features, if they did they would've made a stance on them YEARS ago when 1 click plug-ins started existing. The problem is the elitist scum high level community who think because they played 22 hours a day doing these insanely stupid repetitive tasks and sitting in their own shit for hours on end to reach new peaks of xp/hr, that everyone should be held to the same standard as them. God forbid anything comes around that lets casual players keep up with the same xp/hr rates they got without having to shit theirself.
---
Because for a company, that actually isn't that simple. They have to be careful making such a statement, as it sets a precedent that you can get banned while using an 'accepted' client. I was just answering your question on how they could hotfix this situation to some extent, but I don't expect them to take that route.
---
The difference is that his was actually useful
---
thats short term thinking, get a pipe installed
---
Wear that rune platebody with pride my friend
---
I don't go and vote no to everything blindly. I read all the blogs and talk to the mods on twitter pretty regularly. I just dont think most polled content would make the game better. Its rare i vote no to every single question on a poll though

Something that imbues the ring of wealth effect into any other ring, or maybe a blessing that has the effect but still only 1 prayer bonus so Rada’s blessing 4 remains BIS

i can agree with summoning, dungeoneering shouldn't been a skill but rather self upgrading minigame similar to BA, Divination fun? only way to make this skill fun is not actually train it, aka do the caches, cause otherwise you just click flying orbs of balls, click at hole until you deplete your things you received from orbs of balls and then you click orbs of balls again, once you hit new tier of orb of balls you move them and repeat, similar to woodcutting and fishing and mining, is there really need for 4th gathering skill in osrs?

My comment was supposed to be agreeing with you. Sorry if it didn't come across that way.

I mean, jagex owns the IP, if osbuddy doesnt stop then they will shut them down, just like they were going to do to  runelite but decided against.
---
the fuck u on
---
The people 6ix9ine is talking about were drug traffickers and murderers and extorted him to use his music money to fund the gang, left him out to dry multiple times for crimes that they committed, and even attempted to kidnap him just before they all got arrested. Definitely not friends at all.
---
Speaking from experience, it's a pretty accurate fucking guide

Mobile release numbers shouldn't be taken as the pinnacle. You've got to consider that a lot of people were trying the game out and just didn't enjoy it. Those numbers aren't a true representation of the actual players who play the game often.

I think this is more trouble for the dev team than it's worth. You can just have the wiki open while you skill. They have a link to the wiki in the account tab (or whatever it's called) on the menu, its the tab where the ignore list used to be.

You need to use your tar on the herb, and click the next rock, all in the same tick as you get the exp drop from the previous rock. Currently you're waiting a tick before using herb on tar, and also waiting a tick before moving, so you're essentially 2 ticks behind every rock.
---
Oh that's a big boy!

You should do zalcano. Its svery profitable and you already have good stats for SotE if you havent done it.

nice!

Nah wyrms aren't that bad as a task. Can be fairly profitable if you're happy pray flicking
---
Are redwoods resource based or similar to the upper levels of mlm? 
---
Recently unlocked redwoods want to know if cutting the same section with person is fine.
---
Yes wyrms suck. Check their weight with duradel though, it might not be high enough to warrant a block.

I have dhcb and i have wyrms blocked. Not a fun task when it takes over an hour and you only get some runes and dragon daggers out of it

Yah... I feel one thing that is often forgotten while giving feedback and polling is that ultimately, RuneScape is a fairly silly game. Like it is fine to try to follow a style or support things that seem balanced, but there is a lot of really out of place and strange stuff that was added back in the old school eras of the game.
---
I’m not sure what the consensus on that would be, but I always had them blocked.

I know not a lot of people will agree with me on this, but I think Divination is the most RuneScape-like skill Jagex has released since Farming. It's a gathering skill, but you don't have to go to a bank, but you also can't fully AFK it either because you have to clear your inventory. It's also a crafting skill, and brought a bunch of awesome items into the game. Admittedly those items would be OP as fuck for OSRS, but for RS3 at the time it was par the course for the several years prior. It was also nice for ironmen since you could use transmutation to get individual high level items, and the placement of the wisp colonies brought new life to existing barren areas.
---
The actual act of getting divination energy isn't all that exciting, but none of the skills could really be called "fun" either.

Using your own house is worse because you have to light the burners yourself.

What's in the box??
---
I put my first spirit tree in the farming guild. Other good ones are port sarim, brimhaven, and etceteria (for easy access to the bush patch). You can boost into the high tier guild and plant/finish a tree, but you can't get TP to it without 85 farming. Presumably you could boost every time, but idk who wants to use that many stews. 
---
What kind of kill times are you getting on the hespori? I assume you have gear staples like Ddef and Barrows gloves, and are potting up? Pray and flick piety. Bring some karambwans so you can combo eat, which will save you some time while eating.
---
Thats how it’s always been though, and i don’t see any reason now why that should change, and that’s my reason why not. You are the one purposing a change, so you need to give a good reason why a change should happen, which i haven’t seen yet.
---
they arent agressive so its quite annoying
---
Judging by the amount of attention this post got, kinda looks like its already happening.
---
Well, they distribute the built version of the client. They can add code that's not in the repository before building.
---
Maybe I trained it wrong but didn’t you just repeatedly summon a helper. Like for hours and hours?
---
Basically OSBuddy has released some features that are crossing the lines of what is and isn’t allowed and it’s pretty controversial. In response the other client is about to release op stuff to the point where it’s basically borderline botting. It seems as if they are trying to force jagex hand here. It’s basically AHK all over again.
---
I don’t care
---
I chop in the Farming Guild and bank them. Takes 2 seconds.
---
Every time I lose my membership and can’t buy another bond I grind out 4-5mil with f2p money and that’s a grind within itself lol

Tag them all. If they heal J to full then they'll respawn.
---
he doesnt have to speak for jagex. dont be stupid. he is a osbuddy employee, he should not be allowed to speak for jagex's stance. i dont see what is wrong in he saying it.
---
This but its osbuddy not runelite.
---
that was from 2015 and not what he’s being charged with rn though
---
Just because you dislike the argument doesn’t mean it’s a bad one. Content that is thematically inconsistent with osrs’s grindy nature have no place in the game.

They released an updated pet list in February 2019 during a live stream.  The data and links are in wiki.

I never said he did? I said his response was that, instead of answering a question of "did they say it was okay?" with "yep they confirmed with me". Clearly he was skating around an easy to answer question.
---
Glory 1000%. Get the quest done for Prossy, that will get you more than enough prayer bonus. Spectres are profitable even using prayer pots, so you'll be fine. Killing them faster = more money, killing them slower and saving on prayer pots = less money.

You will never get hacked if you don't click links from people you just meet.
---
You will not get hacked if you have authenticator connected to your phone. Because even if you get RATed they dont have access to your phone, but they can get access to the email already logged into your computer. 
---
You will not get hacked if you avoid sketchy websites.
---
You will not get hacked if you avoid clicking links from twitch streams with titles like "B0atys last day in osrs giveaway in desc"

Be warry of maliciousness everywhere. Also there was someone talking about a website that looks up database leaks and u can type ur name or email to see if anything has been compromised. So you can get ahead and change ur passwords before you would be getting scammed/hacked/robbed.
---
History question. When did Ava's accumulator start working while safespotted? I remember all of my ammo dropping to the ground when using it over a wall. This may have been changed in rs2 or osrs itself.
---
leave you are scaring the children, leave or I will call the police.
---
you would know s3r3n3\_ ;)
---
erm, thats because osbuddy had it before and first, atleast 3 years ago from this, atleast since may 1st 2016 https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4hbgt3/my_view_on_leftclick_use_for_dbones_with_osbuddy/
---
 i don't think runelite had that/existed at that point yet. but the reason why osbuddy got free pass was because left clicking bones at altar was behind pro Wall, 2-3.5$/month depending on what you paid. The reason why runelite gets so much more crap than osbuddy is because everyone can test how overpowered these functions really are for free, not everyone had extra 2-3.5$ a month for osbuddy so the plugins got discussion free pass most of the time.
---
Did you save a giant loot tab lol?
---
whole facts. tbh i liked the hp change too. id so anything to get pre eoc rs back
---
Same for construction with the two benches method.
---
My recommendation is to set the scaling on windows to 200% or maybe even higher, I have a high res(1440) 13 inch screen and had a similar problem. Its sorta annoying if you like having more space but it takes 15 seconds to switch it back.
---
Eeewww. Downdoot
---
Doubt
---
It's a phishing site.
---
I was charged for membership on an account that was banned, what do I do to get my money back?
---
its a green sheet tho
---
No, he's answering a question to him, about what someone said, to him, about something he put in his client.
---
Thats not answering a question for jagex. Thats answering a question about something said to him. He dodged it, you're failing to realise that.
---
Everyone: fucking ban all bots
---
After bot ban
---
Also everyone: why are the items sky rocket in price that are needed daily for our desires?!
---
+1 for chins, 3 failed jad attempts, used chins for the 4th and did it straight away.
---
If AHK was banned at the same time as menu swapping, why is it not included in that news post?
---
depending on what setup you’re using i would recommend a crystal bow to lure the healers. you can do so from a safe distance from jad. 
---
so when healers spawn 
---
- watch had attack and pray accordingly and as soon as he attacks pull 1 healer. 
---
-do so for all the healers and TAKE YOUR TIME
---
-finish of Jad (:
---
Old school RuneScape will never have double xp unfortunately, so yes it’s a phishing site. 
---
Always be careful, have an authenticator on your account as well as a pin.
---
I've never thought of using someone else's house to use their pool before. Thanks.
---
currently getting 84 range then trying the chin method lol
---
Yeah, I use it all the time because I’m too stingy to upgrade my poh haha
---
The deal is they get your password and you get a swift kick in the ass.
---
Lol what a whack-ass take. imagine voluntarily wishing your MMO of choice had *fewer* players
---
If it ever happens I hope you enjoy the MTX that are sure to follow
---
Related in the way that it was not banned when AHK was banned, and I'm not aware of it being explicitly banned. I agree it breaks that definition, and I don't personally like menu swaps, but there's not really a concrete statement about it.
---
They can't afford security they pay each jmod 1 account per hour
---
ive been putting off 70rc for base 70s, i really dont wanna do it but imma have to eventually
---
Also some gloves. While we at it get me some tbows. Im running low on irl money
---
So many people getting 99 rc recently. Gratz!
---
That happened just recently, scales have been going up in price for a while, most likely cause of the bot purge, but now because of the new osbuddy features, it might go higher like you said.
---
Did he ever get his rune crossbow?
---
Where are those creepy Runescape artists?  This image would get tons of karama.
---
Could’ve been 3rd age yes but could have also been potions :), good luck with the hunt!
---
u cant even understand what the statement would mean. im sure jagex would not allow him to say that such a plugin is endorsed by them.
---
Shhh is a joke youre not supposed to think it through
---
Wtf lol I was getting more exp before this plugin was released....
---
Not even one order of magnitude bigger, wdr disc has over 30000 members, a significant portion of the entire player base.
---
david and matt were the worst, holy fuck.
---
Does anyone know if there's a stated reason why the WC cape doesn't teleport to the WC guild?  Seems like a weird thing to have been looked over considering how quickly the farming guild tele was added to the cape.
---
You can do it! It might take a few more tries, maybe even less, but for sure you can do it. Just read up and watch videos on the boss beforehand to get a good idea of how he works.
---
I'm not sure Jagex expected people to train construction by removing and replacing when they first released it.  I don't know what they were really thinking people would do, but construction was a super sloppy release.  It had so many glitches and clunky mechanics.
---
I don't agree about blackjacking, but I also think it was a mistake for Jagex to let left-click pick-pocketing happen, so what do I know?
---
If you want I can sell you a few thousand needles/fire tiaras/burnt food to start your collection
---
Or their email account recovered because Jagex pass off all security to your email provider. They don't even have something as simple as blocking password changes or auth removal requests from IP addresses from countries you've never even played from before.
---
All those had was a world select and an irc client, and they advertised themselves as "your unfair runescape advantage" :D
---
oh how times have changed.

Hydra is bank man. Like 3-4M an hour. Dks with the diary and Sara with an alt is easy peezy. If you’re bored of those  and wanna afk you can sit at BBDs for a couple hours. I think it’s around 700k-1.2m an hour.
---
you gotta keep your friends close and get your enemies toaster.

yes i want the game to have fewer *low quality players* thats bad for the game . ur completely right.
---
Mole is a good start if you completely wiped your bank.
---
The grand tree one annoys me so much. the second to last row where it shows the horizon. IDK how many times i had the 2 end squares swapped but its way to fucking high, at least above 10
---
If somebody wanted to be nice and help you out, they'd give you something without asking for something valuable in return. Is that just not obvious to people?
---
Once they do something about the official client, sure. It runs like actual garbage compared to the third party clients
---
It got removed recently because bots were abusing it. You’re just way behind man. The free week went on for like 6 months or something.
---
That was on mobile release, hasn't happened since
---
&gt; Make your display name something unique and common.
---
Unique - being the only one of its kind; unlike anything else.
---
Common - belonging equally to, or shared alike by, two or more or all in question
---
I play on RL on Gentoo (got the official client installed as well). Once in a while I think "I should make an ebuild so others can easily install it" and then forget about it. Someday...
---
That is a horrible opinion. i will gladly vote no to alot things if i dont think its healthy for the game. May i bring up WARDING.
---
The funny thing is I'm not complaining, as I stated I don't even use clients myself, 99% of my gameplay is spent on mobile. I'm definitely not lazy, I haven't even ever used OSBuddy so the 1 click features mean nothing to me. Whenever I play on my PC I do however use RL mainly for the GPU plugin though as that's super nice.
---
Babies and memories.
---
Hehe. Nice.
---
Or you getting hacked coincided with "accessing mobile osrs from a public wifi on my vacation". The game itself is secure, i doubt someone broke their e2e encryption.
---
Correct
---
It's a little joke about the guy who went for #1 smithing weekly record who sat in his own shit for 2 hours to get 1st, but ended up coming 2nd. Clearly that went over a lot of people's heads though, surprising considering he was memed on this subreddit for like 2 weeks.

Runelite has game integrity in mind meanwhile there’s a plug-in that makes demonic gorillas so easy that it’s basically a zenyte farm bot? Yeah you ride Adams dick very hard
---
I think the “safe deaths” we currently have in place are terrible for the game. It’s completely different than how the game was originally intended to be played and has lead to a really entitled mentality amongst the playerbase. DDOS attacks aren’t especially prevalent anymore and many BiS gears are kept on death as untradables. People have no risk all reward PvM options that just pump the game with alchables and supplies.
---
Just sit at the knight and keep him alive. Everyone fucking ignores the knight.

fair enough, it just felt like the way i read your comment was that you didn't like feeling like you were cheating because of the plugins.
---
That was a quick argument

why not souls?

That's good criticism. I do need to be able to provide a really strong reason, I suppose.
---
Thank you :)
---
&gt; I just wish you could make decent money with it.
---
You can! Hard contracts are very profitable, I've made close to 30M from them already (over 400 contracts completed). The trick is to always have planted: 
---
* 1x Snape grass
---
* 1x Potato cactus
---
* 1x Watermelon
---
* 1x White lily
---
* 1x Poison ivy/Whiteberries
---
* 1x Maple/Yew tree
---
* 1x Cadantine/Lantadyme/Dwarf weed/Snapdragon/Torstol
---
* 1x Palm/Papaya tree
---
* 1x Celastrus tree
---
* 1x Redwood tree
---
If you're lucky, you'll complete 2-3 contracts in a row. The few times when you're very lucky, you'll complete 5-7 at once.
---
If you actually think runelite is any safer to download than osb while calling someone beyond stupid you should literally off yourself so the stupid doesn’t rub off on anyone else
---
Yet there is the Wiki, hosted on Jagex servers, paid for by Jagex, maintained by dedicated people, which has skill calculators, quest guides and just about any piece of information you can need to play this game? Good try though buddy, the adventure aspect of this game went away when we all grew up and learned the game like the back of our hands.
---
thank you
---
Osbuddy existed before runelite did afaik
---
the game isnt that different to say. It just wasnt possible to 1 tick switch everything in 2007. u are fucking lagging with 300 ping 50% packet loss and 10 fps.

Werewolf agility is the fastest course since there is one failable obstacle and if youre paying attention you can stack a couple of obstacles at a time with well timed clicks. However Seers is pretty afk and chill

Which is why democracy doesn't work, even tho it's the best we got
---
Around Zulrah release IIRC. That was one of the main costs of Zulrah because you'd lose the ammo since it can't drop to the ground, so it was polled shortly after.
---
This is hot vomit
---
I want to say obstacles not inferring is an osrs exclusive. If you check the runescape3 wiki it mentions it not working when there are obstacles
---
https://runescape.wiki/w/Ava%27s_accumulator
---
The south-western square of the monster is used as the origin in determining whether or not ammunition will be attracted back (similar to the way in which [loot](https://runescape.wiki/w/Drops) is dropped). **When the direct line from a player to this square is free of obstacles**, the accumulator will function.

Ok, I'll bite. How is the current client war going on going to effect mobile users who only have one client to choose from?
---
Cap your FPS, it will help a lot with performance on mobile. By default it's 60fps, knock it down to 30, even 20 or 15 if you're afking
---
Anti bots should be legal.
---
Scripts that prevent bots making money by harassing the bots.
---
diameter you fuckin caveman
---
Eee haha I'm proper creased at this one, out loud laughing the lot man haha
---
You could just buy a month of membership and get money faster on p2p before your subscription runes out
---
Autohotkey
---
Sorry, but I’m a little confused. This is meant to be competitive, but for someone who doesn’t have a lot of time to play often, they can still go at their own pace?
---
Come share a blunt with me, you seem like you need it
---
no i started in 2007
---
No.
---
People would just use clients regardless how would they know
---
Big thing is you'll have to build an acc for pvp, if you dont mind risking a bit more a zerker or voider is a bit higher level, takes more time to make do you can start with a pure then convert it into either of the others
---
I wholly trust OSB, **especially** now. Left-click Con was long overdue.
---
htc m8 was an awesome phone. Probably some of the best speakers Ive had in a phone
---
Like, over 20-30k cballs.
---
Got pretty lucky on most drop rates.
---
Zombies took forever, like 15k kc
---
Lucked out on Earth warriors at like 500kc
---
Skeletons were really low too.
---
If you're willing to bank the drops from some of them, it saves quite a bit of money.
---
You know I might be out of the loop but how exactly does being called poor pertain to luring?
---
Outside of buying or sharing your account, jagex should keep your account safe or do the most it can to get you everything back.
---
It’s not your fault that is nefarious wants your items and has duped their way into obtaining your account details.
---
If a fraud happens at a bank, your money is returned to you.
---
No, 3.3
---
get more prayer levels
---
It's in the game in the account tab, at least there a button you press and it opens the website
---
Agility is fundamentally unviable without RuneLite. Almost none of the obstacle click boxes on any course are intuitive.
---
Yes but both are not in the game, what makes one menu entry swap ok and the other one not when neither are 1:1, this should be polled, not just overruled by a third party client lol
---
eh got to jad again died little after healers with chins. I think im actually done lol.
---
Going for gold cwars armor next to maximize the fashion.

“Entirety of the hlc” chofl exaggerate much?
---
There are fringe cases like mod Jed that no amount of account security/opsec can protect you from, but the vast majority of people getting hacked are:
---
Using emails/passwords that are in a database leak
---
Giving away personal info used to recover their 
---
account to clan mates/friends, or on a 3p website like reddit and Twitter
---
Are RAT’d from sketchy clients/links 
---
Or, they’re simply lying and RWTd their shit.
---
The account recovery process needs overhauled and customer support needs to improve in the cases people do get hacked (even if they get hacked via their own negligence), but the problem is not as widespread as you’re making it out to be.
---
This subreddit is like 80% OSBuddy hate today dude
---
Insurance covers therapy.
---
I can't believe people have alts that have basically maxed combat and 80-90% of the requirements for a quest cape.
---
Would love to save the time by doing that but bills got me absolutely broke at the moment. It's only like 3m more to go so I'll just try bang out some of the suggestions above on mobile while doing other things :)
---
I personally don't, but if you do choose to drop them, bring a knife (if you have 92 fletching) and fletch them into shields before dropping them.
---
The plugins are menu system based, not game based. It isn't altering any game action (at least the public plugins). As long as these plugins don't pass the currently accepted EHP rates, there is literally no way to detect them as long as **any** 3rd party client is allowed by Jagex.
---
This has to be one of my favorite pieces I’ve seen you do! Great work!
---
Just keep 3 def or go with 13

How do essence pouches disappear? I get that they degrade, but after that first degrade what happens if you continue to use them? Is it time based? 
---
Asking because lava guides 75+ say to ignore the giant pouch degrading and don’t repair until the large one does.

No one knows exactly how Wintertodt drops scale with skills. I have researched it thoroughly since I'm going to solo max point games to 99 fm and hold the crates.
---
Please tell me where Jagex said that it okay to use these clients.
---
Link tweets will like for exposure
---
Definitely agree. But what do we get instead? Items such as the bludgeon...
---
Max account don't pk?
---
They’re variable entry swaps. They change based on conditions. Not the same thing as left click bank or tool leprechaun. 
---
Not to mention with the banker and tool leprechaun there’s no gained time anyway because you can right click before you get to the NPC. With bones/construction it’s b2b interactions that save time relative to an average player
---
At least your didn't get very far with that pure lmao
---
No, someone made a video where a bunch of bot makers lied about bots being undetectable on mobile emulators to increase sales. If the person who made the video didn't get paid for it as well he's an idiot as it was the best advertisement ever.
---
That's outright false. Explain Rocket, de0, kehd, endee, and pretty much every other streamer that's been hacked. You obviously don't know what you're talking about. Every single Oblv member I've talked to has said they'll be gone by mid-2020 at the latest. Gonna come back in a couple months and laugh my ass off to see if people are still being this retarded.
---
I practically screamed when a coworker showed me this the other day. He was watching me do a farm run on mobile and told me to use my herbs on the leprechaun without saying what it did... I could have cried when I saw the banknotes appear. All that time wasted on bank trips...
---
Best way to unlock moneymakers is do as many quests as possible. I didn’t use it when I started but optimal quest guide in the wiki is a great timeline for what quest you should be doing.
---
Unlock fossil island for birdhouse runs, Ava device, mm quest for d scim, ardy diary for cape tele, fairy rings, spirit trees, magic secateurs for herb runs. Then upgrade your gear (melee and range first) and start slayer tasks. After that come more goals: rfd quest for barrow gloves and fire cape. The grind never stops!
---
Good Fashionscape, cape is slightly too dark but still pretty awesome
---
I'm pretty sure that's an M7. But I agree, they were both fantastic
---
Sell it and use the gold to merch resource items.
---
Get runelite dude
---
How
---
Yeah you're right, but theres also a big difference in being able to left click bones vs right clicking then clicking use. So why is that okay?
---
Weird you know everything about them from that one line of text?
---
OSRS  
---
1: Rightclick bone  
---
2: Move cursor to use  
---
3: Left click use  
---
4: Move cursor to altar  
---
5: left click altar  
---
6: move cursor to next bone
---
RL  
---
1: Left click use  
---
2: Move cursor to altar  
---
3: Left click  
---
4: Move cursor to next bone
---
OSB  
---
1: Click on altar
---
I don't think I've ever made a conscious decision to try work out where a hit box is during agility, working out which way to go the first time but it's pretty intuitive where to tap
---
What did people ever do before that.  Imagine if this was still a browser game and there were no clients.
---
Depending on who you ask
---
You need to stop caring
---
Both clients give an unfair advantage, yet Runelite not only gets a pass but is praised by a majority of this subreddit?
---
What's the difference in XP/hr between all three, though?

---
My understanding of making money off of shards is to use them to create divine potions, so your herblore needs to be high enough to make the profitable ones (ranging &amp; super combat?).
---
Drawn better with my prick ;)..
---
 good job man
---
Got 13 def for slayer helm
---
Oakdice said it best in his latest video that these are the updates Jagex should be adding not a 3rd party developer
---
I loved dungeoneering but fuck summoning, other than that it’s just good minigames, I don’t think it’s actually that much better than OSRS.
---
In hindsight it’s pretty crazy that RS2 didn’t get T80 weapons until dungeoneering came out, and even then they were untradeable and pretty difficult to get.
---
That reminds me of that YouTuber who made npc bots for Christmas is Falador and got his accounts banned
---
Ok take my upvote
---
Wow, this is extremely impressive.  Nice job!
---
I almost gave up immediately because as you could expect I just got destroyed but I decided to stick with it. It took about two days of playing a LOT to be able to keep up with the switches and what not. I do believe this game might be one of the highest skill pvp content there is. I do lose most matches but when I do manage a kill or two it's a rush.
---
Vote no to EZscape
---
Panties status:dropped
---
Not *much* harder imo. I also ate most if not all my food against vorkath. Got it first try. Galvek took me three tries. His attacks are really easy to avoid.
---
Explain how without somehow fucking up yourself you could lose your account if you use a unique email and pass for OSRS/RS and only OSRS/RS?
---
Capital of Norway IRL?
---
I see Countertoplol answered these, but I'll add in that part of the reason the gear discord recommends claws over BGS is after you BGS spec, you have a really long delay to attack. With vorkath, that causes you to lose a hit due to the acid or freeze special happening. If you do use claws, keep them on slash. The claw special always rolls off slash def, but uses your accuracy of the current style. Switching to stab lowers your spec accuracy significantly because of this. Personally, I still use BGS, because I don't want to sell other stuff to buy claws.
---
I also like to use divines because at 99 str, you lose a max hit if your str ticks down one level (with your gear). If you're 98 str, you can tick down 3 times before you start losing max hits. You could use normal potions and repot when you tick down the 4th time here.
---
Well maybe not **puts on tinfoil hat*\* They need a reason to ban 3rd party clients right. It's an obvious black flag op. All the companies in this financial report are set up in such a way that Matt, or whoever is orchestrating this behind the scenes, can walk away with that 1.2mil right, so rsbuddy won't mind getting shut down either. Jagex will just claim they can't differentiate between 3rd party clients so they have to ban them all.
---
You described me
---
As I understand it the competitive element is mainly in people racing eachother to be the first to reach certain goals. If you're not into that you can just complete tasks at your own pace to earn points.
---
you can get the same exp rates with OSB and RL the difference is that one kills your wrists
---
Thanks guys. Hadn't thought of that!
---
Just to piggy back on this comment, I did the same thing when I was learning Zulrah and the first couple times I did it, I came in with no items on just to learn the switches and placements. Didn’t have a ton of gp available and didn’t feel like wasting pots and TBP charges since I figured I wouldn’t get a kill the first couple attempts anyway.
---
I agree, definitely think 3rd party devs shouldn’t cross that line.
---

---
Unfortunately, even though Android is based on Linux, running Android apps on Linux is actually really janky and doesn't perform well, in any of the ways I've tried it.
---
I was under the impression they could track mouse inputs as I know people who have been banned for AHK skills. But when it comes to Pking with AHK, there's enough organic inputs to not set off detection?
---
Back when I used to make scripts for SRL/SCAR, we had to use multiple colors to prevent repetitive clicks as they were detectable. Guessing going back to 07 build of the game caused the detection system to suffer.
---
eh, Jagex's fine with it (because when they're *not* fine with something, they ask RL to remove it and they do so). As for OSBuddy, I've seen Ash tweet about how they're discussing it internally, so we'll probably hear something about it from them soon
---
Your work is stunning as usual Legend_Arts!
---
so now to use osbuddy is bannable or not? just want to be safe
---
More often than not they will get killed. People always ignore the shifters going for him so he bets fucked up early on.
---
I'm really interested in how you manage to make art like this in a short time.  My work isnt anywhere close to yours and it takes me twice as long
---
Dude, if I was that player this would’ve made my life. Amazing work, seriously, well done!
---
Less actions per bone = faster, easier and less risk to get pked
---
Bruh this guy has been in the upvote club for a long time
---
Would be pretty OP for Zulrah, but if you were to do it just have it be that you use an eternal gem on a Ring of Suffering to get an (e) version, and the imbued version would be (ei).
---
If it’s too OP you could always just require two eternal gems or maybe an eternal and an onyx?
---
I ain’t risking it. Shits too OP.
---
Dude WTF so cool
---
Only if they make runelite the base game
---
Wait so would the left click options on RL count too?
---
300k isn’t a lot to jagex, but it’s a lot for 1-2 mods at jagex
---
And the substantial cost to use, it just about costs 1k per swing of the scythe.
---
And the drop rate is substantially more common than the twisted bow which people like to compare it to.
---
don't forget the pelvic woo
---
Two questions 
---
1: any plans to change the hosting board for houses? All the people changing their names to a bunch of Z’s seems really dumb...... 
---
2: (much less important) is there any plans to update specific items models to make them less weird amongst the sexes? (The two biggest thing that comes to mind is female mystic robe top (it just looked bad) and the color of the crop top on verac’s brassard (it’s this weird off color that doesn’t come close to the rest of the barrows gear)
---
Get out
---
Never played much mobile but started doing grotesque guardians on mine the other day and as I see it, as long as you know what you’re doing it’s just as easy on mobile!
---
RS2 ≠ osrs
---
Thanks!!!
---
This is still related. It's a vicious feedback cycle.
---
Scythe is really only worth owning if you plan to camp the Theatre, where it is a *substantial* improvement over a whip/blade.
---
Therefore, if the Scythe crashes, there's less incentive to do the Theatre, meaning less people will want to own a Scythe (greater supply, less demand). 
---
There are likely other factors also leading to Scythe going down in price (such as this being back-to-school time when a lot of people sell items) but I think 3rd party client usage is at least a substantial contributing factor.
---
If switches are your biggest problem, try either using void or just straight up mage only. 
---
I got my first kill only using mage. But if you choose to do this, be ready to take longer than 1 full rotation to kill it. You will also have to stand in a safe spot during the turquoise phase to eliminate tons of damage.
---
To me both are giving the user an advantage over the vanilla client or how Jagex intended. OSbuddy just takes it a step further. But I’m not complaining. I’m still using OSBuddy anyways. I don’t mind paying $3USD a month for it. I just mostly stocked with OSBuddy because of OpenGL
---
Really between fletching and range she didnt guess archery? Dumb af. Lol
---
'Before that' we put up with it because we didn't know how good things could be. Jagex fucked up and let us find something so good that they can't take it away without losing players.
---
This one is pretty nice!
---
why are you at the rs3 hans
---
Know your place trash.
---
Yeah but you use emojis and thats just as bad
---
Can we use an untrimmed skill cape on perdu to show him our 1st 99 and have him sell it back to us untrimmed? This would make it fair and get rid of the convoluted glitch to keep capes untrimmed.
---
i went and checked my rs3 acc and it has 40 wc and 40 fletching and i don't know what the fuck i was doing back then
---
I agree. I think a way to keep its price afloat would be to somehow make it expensive to use but maybe not quite so expensive. 1.2m/hr operating cost for a ~15% melee increase is rather steep and makes it not worth for most bosses, except for extremely rich players pet hunting. 
---
I've seen a few suggestions, some like you have stated, others suggesting a very steep "perma charge" option (like 500m + a lot of vials of blood/blood runes), but I'm not sure how others players would feel about this since it could be seen as OP.
---
heres a tip if your say 50 hp and their 40 hp and u eat and they call you a safer.... keep doing what your doing no matter how much they cry safer they do that so you dont eat and they then just kill you easily lol..... yes people do that
---
*points to fact this account existed during the actual osrs years and I play osrs currently* 🙄 10/10 observation tho bro
---
Regarding the state of PVP: can anything be done about PVM content in the wilderness that has resulted in abusive player dynamics? For example, the Rev Caves are so strongly balanced in favor of clan PKing that PVMers are extorted by clans to not get PK’d. I would prefer the drops and slayer points be nerfed than have to put up with clans crashing in there all the time.
---
&gt;rs3 hans
---
Is it realistic to see an upgrade to the Old school client in the foreseeable future?
---
Have to do it for diaries eventually anyway, might as well get a torso in case you need to do a rebuild due to random circumstance or addiction.
---
You think that's bad? Try searching for a mithril crossbow
---
It’s either bot ban, speculation, or removal of mobile membership.
---
It's certainly a multi-factoral issue, but to say the wide availability of clients that make completions substantially easier does not contribute to this would be foolish.
---
Umm read what comment?
---
Because I went over to check the age of my actual account. I play osrs on iron man.
---
Just balance future bosses around them then, like they did with Nomad and Nex.
---
Lol ikr. Mistaking a skull for a rock, not knowing what an anvil looks like, and a pot of gold wut? Where is that gold that she is talking about?? Even if one doesn't recognize it's steam, I still don't see how something white can be recognized as gold.
---
Thank you!!

"Dude with this double xp, I've gotten from 58 to 68 strength!"

Just wanna say that everywhere i go, it is like that. Yeah, you mean a bug that makes one not see most stuff e.g. during important part of a quest/fighting doesn’t affect even .01% of a gameplay.
---
I found I was getting a spirit seed every few hours at wintertotd, on top of what other people are saying as well.
---
Proof?
---
You’re an idiot 😂 I assure you I couldn’t get that reading from the Osrs Hans.
---
At the end of the temple of Ikov quest, if the adventurer sides with Armadyl he gets to fight Lucien. After defeat he states that he will come back and retreats to the north. Is there a possibility for a future quest that continues this quest line?
---
You're right - with decent teams it's easy to do 3 completions an hour. A drop is ~1/10 and a scythe is 1/19 for any purple chest. So it certainly is more common, and unlike the TBow which is BIS or at least useful in so many scenarios, Scythe is really only worth using at ToB.
---
Play on a private server since jagEx can’t add free potions and food to duel arena. While you do that afk a baby pure with 50 attack 80 strength 85 range / magic 45 prayer 1 defense at sand crabs. The whole f2p pking shit is a waste of a time and half the people replying to in you here are dog shit at pking and don’t know what they’re talking about.

My rs3 account is so much further in the game than my Ironman (wasn’t willing to play the same way twice). I know I’ll never get 99 slayer again or what not but playing as an Ironman is so much easier than I thought it would be thanks to the time invested in the game back then. Dunno why everyone’s so “hur dur rs3, fuck off” I play osrs 😂

Exactly. The game is run escape not escape run

Damn looks good!

I would do revs pking with friends to get into pking scene pvp is wayyy too tough for any pker to do. Pvp is for proffessionals who know how to triple eat veng time and stack. Not to also mention one ticking specs

It's only +1 more str over serp helm so I don't think youll be hearing any outcry

---
Oh shig, wc bots have 99 hp now?? They have evolved!!
---
If you have full graceful and a high agility level I don't know how much that's actually going to matter. We are talkin all of 2kg here.
---
lmfao are u dumb
---
So jagex can't see if menus are being manipulated by a client? Afaik they can track clicks at least, so they can see a pattern of only left clicks on an altar (for instance) and realize that must be the one click plugin.
---
1 click blackjacking tho
---
Lmfao, you got a template for us? This is gold
---
You're talking about like 2k gp so...
---
1click blackjacking is just a menu entry swapper that changes which menu is left click as you need it. It's the same feature. Doesn't mean it's not fucked.
---
To I guess answer your question more directly, maxing attack will be more useful than maxing defence, and will also make maxing defence faster.
---
Yeah of course charged will always be more dps than uncharged...
---
I'm just saying nearly all of the arguments regarding the scythe right now are centered around how expensive it is to use while charged, while completely ignoring that it still provides some of the best dps in the game against basically anything that it can hit more than once.
---
You can unlock auto hammer and salt and shit for other monsters though, and slayer helm means you don’t have to wear earmuffs or spiny helmet or nosepeg so your argument doesn’t make sense.
---
Normal players love buffs. Also there's is a slight difference in that 1 click blackjacking was removed from runelite upon request and they haven't requested removal of Menu Entity Swapper. Used click bones to use for one inventory, felt dirty and had to turn it of though.
---
Needs more rope
---
this is a osrs reddit tho fuck off with ur rs3 playtime, also 200 days are rookie numbers.
---
Dude some people love that game.and there is a FUCK ton of content for it
---
Fair.
---
I totally get that but wc perk is mostly useless and the small buff to the cape seems harmless since there also isnt much of a reason to go back there after 99 wc.  I also feel like it's got precedent since Farming cape got the guild tele when the guild came out and Farming already has a good perk, and still has the skills necklace option as well.  Would be nice if the tele was more in the WC guild like semi close to the bank but I wouldn't mind even if it was the same as the skills necklace. Just seems like it fits well, makes sense, and doesnt really hurt anything.  Hence why I'm wondering if they've ever stated anything about it or if it's just something that hasnt been suggested or considered.
---
If the other client u talking about is RL+ they actually said they will NOT be relasing those plugins.
---
Goddamn it, I was like "I'm 99% sure there's no create rope spell" but lemme just see what bullshit he's sending me to. I did not expect that.
---
I still got them in the bank but I'm not using them; they're like 50k per drop and you can kill like 40 per hour? So thats only 2m/h? Waste of time imo, I just go TOB and make 8-10m/h
---
I really wish Jagex could somehow detect good bots from bad ones. Imagine having scripted bots that would act as NPCs during events like that. It would be really cool.
---
? Vamp isnt a part of rs3 invention tho. All the good perks are ~5% dps boosts or qol shit like mobile/scavenging.
---
So you're going by "TruckNutz" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Fmjosh from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic..
---
Earmuffs, spiny helmet, and nosepegs all go in the head slot. Auto hammer and salts still require the item. Added a mirror to a helmet makes no sense
---
Err I mean archbang!
---
Slayer helmet is already very powerful.  It doesn't need a buff
---
Just use a saw on a unicorn 4head
---
That doesn’t remotely make it anti-pk.
---
Anti-pk would be the boss instantly switching targets to a skulled person, and that would be ridiculous.
---
Seems like too huge of a change to even consider. What about only using charges if it hits above some threshold?
---
no u
---
Yeah and just like in monty python the bot will eventually kill itself

Menu entry swapper is not exactly the same thing at all
---
It's a static menu swap when what osbuddy is doing is a lot more complex
---
If you don't see the difference between being able to 1 click a banker right next to the one clickable bank booth and 1 click black jacking or construction, then you're the problem.
---
Ohh yeah brotha
---
I've got 250 almost corrupted with blade 15 regular kc, pet 34corrupt. Recently finished first log, I'd guess blade is somewhere between 400-500. Thats quite discouraging to be honest, I was really hoping for another.
---
Goddamn OP you sure took some fucking time on this one, proud of youuuu &lt;3
---
To train summoning you had to kill monsters for charms, buy secondary ingredients from players or farm them yourself (making some worthless items valuable) and it was an additional gold sink because you needed a 3rd ingredient called spirit shards (25gp ea from store). Different pouches would cost more or less shards.  
---
You could train quickly by selling a noted version of your secondary ingredient (they dont stack) to the shop, and buying it back unnoted. And selling the pouches you made to the shop (for more loss than you'd usually get). There are 2 places in the game currently you can exchange pouches for shards (better gp recovery than selling pouch to the shop for gp), but to get your pouches noted (they dont stack) you would have to make a trip to the bank every inventory.
---
I literally do the same with my htc M7 at work without the bag. Now the screen is popping out from 500 hours of fire strike
---
you still need the hammer/salt etc you just dont have to manually use it. its actually slower to use auto hammer/salt than if you were paying attention and doing it manually, its purely qol.
---
not needing a mirror shield is a straight buff to dps and not any kind of qol since your still just attacking them the same but with a defender in your hand instead.
---
i dont think slaye helm should have been added to osrs, but the earmuffs, spiny helm and nose peg are built into the slayer helm how would the shield be built into the helmet? its a mirror you cant see through it even if you had glasses.
---
Yea what? Look up what basically combat maxed accounts go for
---
they don't deserve it, but fuuuuuuuuck I would love to see the meltdown in this sub
---
I agree that it should of been polled. But doesnt help that jagex can't really make a proper stand on what should be done. They want the free dev time from 3pc but not this op shit.
---
Stamina pot &gt; staminup

I played Classic for a couple months before the switch to Runescape 2, where I played until 2007. Dunno what you mean 2 hours.
---
Always check the link, XcQ is a no go from me.
---
They already answered this like 3 weeks ago.
---
Leveling the playing field with bots isn't the right way to go. One thing about runescape is the bots always win, and that will be one of the biggest downfalls of the game. If Jagex tries to counter the bots in one way or another, the players will suffer too, and the bots will still find a way around it. If Jagex "levels the playing field" then the game becomes ezscape in a sense and you're taking away from how it was originally played.
---
Don. T using osb.
---
Safe before risk
---
Content that you can buy for real life money. I quit that game years ago after having all my pures ruined, and finally quit my main 2 years ago. Your accomplishments feel like crap when people can just buy something you spend hundreds of hours to achieve.
---
RS3 is a failure. OSRS could be next if Jagex doesn't smarten up.
---
They said they are more keen on adding out of bank storage (seed vault) than more bank spaces directly
---
Must be on Karamja.
---
Nice!
---
Tbf, Reddit’s search functionality is trash
---
The thing is that's not osbuddy's place to make the decision, it should be jagex and the polls
---
If the average player really wants these buffs they'd pass a poll, but the fact is the average player really doesn't like this shit. the majority of people in you're discord does not equal everyone
---
You can still obtain it today if you go to Diango with the code.
---
What is that sword he's holding? I havent played in years.
---
no a HUGE amount of content that isnt' buyable as in the insane amount of quests / bosses and a combat system we enjoy
---
Why not just compliment the artwork here and move on? Instead you bash another artist on every art related post on this subreddit. It’s fine to not like someone’s art... but it’s very immature to talk poorly about someone just because they enjoy making art.
---
Like I said, maybe an item called basilisk eyes that can be added to the helm, it counteracts the basilisk’s ability. Or infuse a basilisk head with slayer helmet to add the ability
---
With hespori, watch your in-game chat, you should get a message in red about how you've been trapped by vines or something and you need to spam click another tile until it lets you move again. If you don't follow this mechanic you'll get hit for a lot of damage.
---
good cosplay
---
Lol I'll wait 2 years to hear "dude I've been hacked" and I'll say "remember that double xp post you seen on facebook?"
---
I was gonna play Deadman for no ge but they added it recently -.-
---
Yes, you can even use AHK to remap windows input keys. You can achieve insane fetching xp with this method and it is not bannable as you are not relying on AHK for input. There is a tutorial on youtube from one of the record holders for fastest 99 fletching.
---
Oh thanks for the correction.
---
Do either hard or elite help in that aspect?
---
I think the problem with them telling people where they were caught is botters use this to update their scripts to counter the ban detection on what caught them.
---
People obviously will get used to the easiest acceptable option. Currently that is menu entry swapper.
---
Based on how long menu entry swapper has existed and the community’s uproar at 1-click bones, i do not think this is a slippery slope of sorts.
---
I think this dilemma is only the case in runescape because many people consider the basic client to be so garbage it warrants this sort of thing.
---
I would love if jagex made a lot of things on runelite an official feature (and i think so would the majority of other people playing)
---
Then the bots start scripting simple awnsers
---
I'd rather have a group difficult boss fight like Nex instead of another raid, tbh designing raids tales longer than expected as well.
---
What country are you from? I've never heard someone call their sister "babe" before, is that her name?
---
sand casino lol
---
Can confirm I’ve seen this post like twice already too lmao. It really should get fixed.
---
Left not right
---
Damn, sounds like a very dishonest player who kept a lot of secrets from you. Someone who has over 1b (and knows how to get it without RWT) and gets hacked was doing something shady as fuck.
---
Will defs give this a try tonight thank u brother

I just used all diary and fossil island lamps to 77.

200k in alchs

Zammy wines, runite mining during inactive times. Most other moneymakers are sub 150k and worthless. Ogress is like 50 hours to bond, you probably don't want that.
---
Secure your email, Set up 2FA, use a bank pin. If you really want to be safe, don't have your the client approve your PC for 30 days. Literally impossible to get hacked even with a RAT, they would have to also have access to your phone.
---
yup
---
You can block off all access to the wilderness with a pin.
---
I'm a big afk mobile player, so if you're into that.. casting fire bolt on blue dragons is a pretty awesome balance of gp and xp. It's nowhere near as fast as bursting but it's way higher than splashing, makes pretty decent profit (I'm sitting around 400-500k an hour) and takes next to no attention.
---
Bad news for rs3 is bad news for us. I don't browse /r/runescape but I like hearing how its doing.
---
I don’t think more so force, there could be a option to skip a Minigame via points so it isn’t a broken system?
---
tru
---
A temporary fix would be to disable attack option on npc

This can let you spam click the loot pile

He left out weak password/reused password. On a VERY VERY rare occasion someone could social engineer your account from Jagex, but this requires a LOT of evidence.
---
is free money worth it?
---
But stat bonuses
---
This is the artwork i upvote
---
The owners of jagex is close to bankrupt right now. It's hard to justify a hiring process for more people if they right now don't make enough money with the current staff
---
Yes, shame on you and your parents.
---
i look for the w W W
---
The goal is that Minotauros should become a boss that you can farm efficiently in PK gear. It's great content for Wildy PvMers, because most other Wildy bossing is more of "cat and mouse play" with the pkers.
---
The most popular response I see to this is offer to cut a neighbors lawn for $11 - 30 mins of work for a month of membs. Way better than having to grind 10+ every two weeks just to keep the bond sustained
---
Literally vermeer irl lol

\*ahem\* SIT IDIOT

God bless

Explain how one gets hacked with it not being their fault when you have 2FA on your account, 2FA on your Email, Unique password on your account, and a Unique password on your Email? That's actually air tight.

Vro there's already a bunch of these in stronghold of security lol

Q: Could there be a option to untrim a Skill cape once achieving 200M xp on the designed skill you wish to untrim?
---
Personal Thoughts:
---
The only way to keep a untrimmed Skill Cape is via a big in the game which doesn’t make sense at all.
---
You make a convincing argument. And it would make sense since Jagex was always lacking the resources to properly update the Vanilla client. You could almost say do a degree Jagex was "dependent" on OSB to pick up on their shortcomings for a number of years with OSRS.
---
However, with Runelite in the picture, and becoming the more main stream client for OSRS players, I think Jagex is in a strong position to walk away from any shady dealings with OSB and let Runelite pave the path forward since their features and benefits fall more in line with Jagex's terms and services.
---
Yeah there was the map image on the website but that was too advanced for noob me haha
---
What I'm saying is that individual minigames need fixing
---
That's great. So why use pk gear? Specifically ballistae and and elder maul doesn't warrant it being killable in just pk gear. Think more outside the box, give it mechanics that make it act like another player. 
---
I just think you need to think more about what you're offering here.
---
Oh ok well its not that bad, i redid my design with quest hall, costume and menagerie downstairs.
---
https://i.imgur.com/M74PEDI.jpg

&gt;easy

&gt;fast
---
I think you mean lots of practice and knowing how he wants it to turn out, or roughly know before starting.
---
I hope the increase in botters will stimulate jaglex to do something about them.
---
the giant is looking at a tiny dragon
---
Except it's not. While I never claimed it to be the reason mechanics were changed in the first place (that was purely DDOS related), it's indeed a legitimate argument to consider if Jagex eventually decide to create new death mechanics.
---
Apparently it's about 140k/h in catherby but yeah idk where the best spot would be in f2p. That's not a bad method for how low of a cooking level you need to not burn them.
---
Haha nice try OSbuddy marketing team
---
True scapers know adamantite and runite you neet
---
looks like straight out from dark souls
---
I can never reach that stuff as the mountain of shit and trash game design is too much of a blockade. I hate that game and what it did to me. I hope it gets closed.
---
From 74-99 Construction, using oak doors~86.5m cost
---
From 77-99 RC, using bloods~160.7m profit
---
not getting potions is always good.
---
But more ppl doing raids 2 = more scythes = crash
---
changing your password frequently (i.e. weekly/monthly/bi-monthly) isnt recommended security practice
---
Not sure if it’s possible on OSRS, but on rs3 you can type /wiki then the topic to be directed to the page
---
This is totally opposite from what I’ve experienced. Mentor personalities can differ from time to time, some are stricter than others and some are much more relaxed. But I’ve never experienced one who was legitimately toxic. 
---
Also the inferno chat can be contentious especially with people arguing about justiciar and Saradomin god sword but everyone I’ve interacted with has been more than willing to drop everything and help with any questions I have, help me solve tricky waves with screenshots, and I even had someone offer to coach me through screen share when I got to Zuk the first time. 
---
It’s impossible to be 100% fair when managing a community of that size but I think the moderators are trying their best. It’s a great community for learning end game PvM.

So stop switching

Just under 10m xp.. not complaining
---
Elite will profit just over 4.5m a month (selling battlestaves at GE for 8.2k each).
---
He does explicitly say that of course not creators are going to claim a near zero detection rate bc claiming otherwise would hurt sales. People just conveniently forgot about that since it was only a small part of the video towards the end.
---
Frasier is a front page IM that got banned for botting recently and made a big deal out of it saying he didn't bot, but got the Jmod smack down. 
---
I don't have the burden of proof here, you're the one making the affirmative statement that RuneLite causes people to get hacked. It is fully open source so if you think people are getting hacked you can go check yourself and see there is nothing malicious in the code.
---
Thank you eatchicken4, very cool!
---
Congrats, which one is up next??

Debts? What debts lmao.

Your suggestion is get your desert elite diary completed.

Virtus isn’t Endgame, and that promo is already over.

super weeb here, the correct term would be “onii” rather than “onee” as onee refers to ones older sister, and women don’t play this game.

Gzzzz on 99 Tornado
---
I wouldn’t ever bot to get a 99 because I’ve never once cared about having a skillcape (Other than the quest cape). I’d do it legit if I wanted a 99.
---
That's probably what makes it so addictive... it's almost relaxing
---
Grats! Remember seeing you at Zeah rc last week, I just finished it on Saturday
---
Thanks gz to you as well! Rsn?
---
I'm not familiar with UIM (let alone IM) content, what could you do with all those soul runes to put them to use?
---
Need 7 staminas to make it there with run energy
---
Or just teleport to the other side. Kalphite cave tele, fairy rings, etc. I don't have to pay for shantay pass but even then, I couldn't remember the last time I went through it.
---
When is it ?
---
DevilsHerb
---
Oh lord, the "humble" posts are back.
---
Not much use for the souls other than 10k or so for some construction stuff like altar and maybe keep some for ensouled heads if it's not clogging up inv space!
---
studded leather armour
---
But you could sell you 500 and buy a bottomless bucket which would put you back at the 1000 for ~50k cumulative and now have a bottomless bucket
---
Add a little more context! What gear do you have as of right now?
---
I propose removing the whole game to combat the black market instead
---
When exiting the Rellekka Slayer cave the compass and map swap to the polar opposite, north becomes south etc.
---
It makes using the slayer ring to tele and use fairy ring very disorienting, could this be looked at?
---
What’s the homeport emote?
---
Is there a source for this info? I could see it being 1/400 as seeds are 1/40 corrupt, 1/100 regular- maybe 1/500 as it's probably 1k on regular.
---
Not striving for one in particular, my main goal is maxing.

But I guess in terms of maxing, I'm going to focus on fishing/mining next :)

Full black d hide, a ranger helm, the second Ava’s a rune crossbow broad bolts. Snakeskin boots. A glory and wealth ring

Weird question but I would appreciate any answers: I accidentally let my membership lapse without selling off enough of my stuff to pay for new bond. I don't have the time to make a few mil on F2P and I don't wanna pay cash. Is there any sort of in-game loan? I literally need like 2 mil then 5 min later could pay back. Is there any sort of collateral I could put up?
---
Was your daddy a garbage sack?
---
I lold pretty damn hard at this

Thanks for the account

I want to buy a poster of this

Make something useless potentially useful? Not on osrs buddy.
---
Ge shouldnt have every item available. There should be a large list of things removed to make you actually player trade or get the item yourself
---
There is a guy in my clan who has lost at least 5 hardcores
---
I'm not sure, I'll try to alert everyone when he's about 20-50k out.
---
Shouldn’t be a problem then, if gone with blowpipe all the way myself but stats are a little different, take 3k bolts and you will be all good, try get the best gear you can and I’d say for your prayer take 10 brews 1 range pot and the rest super restores, mainly for a pot for jad and extra prayer. 
---
If you have the money get a few hundred purple sweets just in case for the heat while safe spotting.
---
It also maybe an idea to refresh yourself on the prayer switches before you attempt. Had always spawns where the orange 360 is so that’s a bonus for you to remember. 
---
All I can suggest is between tagging the healers or even just killing them and swapping prayers between hits. You could just let them heal jad while you focus them 1 by 1 then you don’t need to worry about healing, just the switches :)
---
DK’s are solid. Especially if you get sweaty and try to solo both rooms at once which is possible and done frequent. (If you want an additional challenge)
---
I understand what you mean, OP. I'm not out here trying to get a two week part time job just to buy runescape membership. 
---
Personally, I try to just do activities that are pretty much the same in f2p as in p2p until I have the time to warrant buying membership. I used to do a lot of wines and alchs between bonds on my main. Right now it's stocking up on Corsair Cove maples so I can get some fetching going on my iron.
---
I'm not making any inference, I'm just saying that assuming every person who has the client open is actively playing the game is ridiculous. You can disprove it with just the fact that mobile exists. Sorry that I actually used my brain, and it goes against what you want :(
---
That’s one of the few plugins I think should have been added to the game a long time ago. Nowhere in the game does it say how long stat boosting potions last, how long stamina pots last, how long anti-venoms last, etc.
---
Lower the draw distance. Mine maxs at 71 for some reason but i keep it at 45 which is nice to my laptop.
---
facts, whos stayin at 60 prayer when you can just get 70, only thing that’d make sense is a pure but they need 66 def anyways.

 Osbuddy is sending modified data to jagex to spoof what actually happened in a players inventory to avoid required clicks. Is this allowed ? Why no bans ?
---
I use bone crusher necklace to restore prayer so I don't bring pots but the boost wouldn't add a max hit or anything?
---
Start over? Its not that far in the grind.

Can we improve the Cat mask to just be Cat ear like the Bunny ears? Its weird and unused right now cause it removes your hair.
---
&gt; I haven't played OSRS in 3 days, but I've had the client running in the background the entire time.
---
Anecdotal, but also literal proof that not everybody who has the client open is actively playing. 
---
The fact that mobile is a large percentage of the OSRS playerbase, who physically can't use Runelite. 
---
You don't need hard numbers to disprove something. Especially when that something is as asinine as 90% of players using a specific third party client.
---
Just use ultra compost you rarely ever lose trees. I prob lost maybe 3 trees since I started doing them and I'm at 96 farm now.

I remember seeing you a few days ago! I'm the scrub account that got 2 pets around level 50ish and 60ish, I'm sorry the guardian didn't get the memo to come out of hiding behind the altar at 99.. :(

Are you going to be looking at updating the main client in any way to better resemble some of the community-loved features of popular third-party clients?

OSRS does need discontinued items. Maybe a reward from a clue where there will be a fixed amount only and once that number is hit no more come into the game.

I support this. Zulrah isn't difficult, 100k isn't much. You kill one zulrah you tend to get 100k anyway, so it's perfectly fair.

Nope. I didn’t play runescape to play a poor mans version of wow/diablo. The MTX honestly didn’t bother me. I didn’t care about Hugh scores and if people support the game so be it. What made me quit rs3 was EOC. It just wasn’t the same game.
---
Spirit trees are more of a luxury. I’d suggest hold onto it until you find a **need** for it otherwise you might regret using it so early— they are hella rare and hard to get. But most spirit trees can be accessed with other teleports. 
---
For example, The hosidius spirit tree can be accessed with skill necklace &gt; wc guild. 
---
 
---
Brimhaven tree use Shiloh (karamja hard diary) teleport &gt; right click hajedy straight to the brim tree patch
---
85 farming is needed to access the high level farming guild at any time.

This was a thing 15 years ago. Or about 15 years ago. At some point they changed the interface including the equipped armor tab and you stopped being able to look at things in combat or continue skilling with menus open.

To clarify, Runelite isn't adding any OP plugins. It's Runelite+, which is not affiliated with Runelite at all but it uses a similar name and logo to make itself sound more trustworthy, and it already has plugins that Runelite doesn't allow.

I can only afford either a dragon hunter lance or full justiciar to do rune dragons. Which one should I prioritize and what would be a cheap alternative for the other?
---
Actually you've got that bass-ackwards. I've posted before with the big ol boatload of evidence, but this is not a case of "dumb Americans hurr durr think America is only country" but actually a case of dumb Europeans. In the Anglosphere, we use . to do decimals. Also, a large number of non-anglo countries in Asia and Africa use either . alone or both.*
---
So, in *The English Language* it is correct to use . as your decimal, so when you are writing English, use the full stop as the decimal point. Using the coma is fine in other languages where that is the standard.

It's the M7, I think the outside layer is aluminum, and it does get pretty hot.

&gt;Elder maul crushes his bare feet for full damage

&gt;his bare feet

It's a joke that backfired. There's no need to put much thought into it.
---
You look like a bot
---
Yeah i changed the password, its correct but every time i go to login its says the account is locked, and to do a recovery.
---
my m9 burnt my hand to the touch during the pokemon go era. literally unusable nowadays.
---
Work smart not hard
---
Nah dude, Pizza Hut thin crust is king.
---
Sure there are.  
---
You don't go to war in track suits.
---
Login on the website, maybe you were banned
---
Agreed
---
but maybe they could focus more on aspects that people enjoy like bossing, pvp, quests, minigames and especially the social aspect like clans, things that most people would enjoy and not really "bottable" effectively lessening the want for people to bot, i completely understand that a lot of people also like the journey more than the destination but i think making that journey a little less bumpy would benefit the game health overall.

Don't have to pit up with agility if you're a free player.
---
I wish that was possible
---
Nah Runelite is not. Maybe Runelite+ or one of the other clients that already has OP clients that regular Runelite doesn't allow, but Runelite is not doing it. Also Runelite is not affiliated with Runelite+ at all, it simply uses a similar name and logo to sound more trustworthy. The people in charge of Runelite have no control over the people running Runelite+.

50 RC in F2P... I believe in you.
---
If Only this was still 2005 and each chainmail was worth 24m.
---
I like having my acc. Thanks :D
---
TLDR the popular clients have mostly adhered to a 1:1 click ratio but OSB now has 1:3+ click ratio plugins which people consider to be botting.
---
I’m so glad I don’t understand German lol I love these.
---
oh
---
so basically just use an unsired asap?
---
Runefest shield, get it from Diango
---
I bought some bonds to speed things up after coming back; I had an old account with 99att, wc, and cooking - but when I tried to recover it (forgot the password), I found out it'd been hacked and the recovery email changed.
---
I didn't buy enough for top gear or anything, just enough that I could play some decent content without having to grind both levels and cash. 
---
Currently getting 75 attack so I can wield a cheap godsword just for the nostalgia lol.
---
the blues aren't even the same hue either
---
That was the most famous one, "Hitler gets banned from xbox live"
---
One ticking brush switches
---
In a nutshell, yes.
---
Shit bro the last time I bought a bond was for 3.1m
---
I like this idea.
---
Farming I can do. Takes 20 mins for a while run, agility I believe I’ll end up killing myself
---
I won’t be able to see the show since I have to pay attention where I have to click now 😭
---
You’re sure it’s ‘osrsrf14’? I’m sure i’m entering it correctly.
---
Yeah we asked him why not just continue as an iron man, and he said something along the lines of "I enjoy the thrill" or something lmao
---
thx mate
---
Cunt! Thats what jacmob said the first time, then the cunt sold us all out to jagex and we got bot nuked. 
---
Legit you lads are biggest snakes in rs history. Nothing compares.
---
Perfect 10
---
market price is 4.8m
---
I thought you just had to kill 5 trolls then you can bank/restore and can continue on with the quest
---
All proposed, accepted, and denied code changes are posted to their discord #development channel in real time. That channel is relatively active, and you can look at their github to see how many people actually are looking at their code and making pull requests
---
Is it, its own word or short for something?
---
Gotta be on the bandwagon lad.
---
hey i just got this little dude at 201kc last night, i was so fucking hyped, congrats dude (:
---
You only lost 1m. Thats nothin. Dont sweat it. Just learn from it and move on.
---
Ever since OSBuddy added Monkey Madness to Enhanced Mode.
---
nice
---
Idk why you didn't say that originally then. I just wanted to let people know it's actually faster than the 180 initially mentioned.
---
Gz bro, did better than when I switched to p2p
---
Uh actually we pay for your game look up last year's financial report
---
Dont come here and think you're entitled to anything
---
Man, I cleared out 4 scrolls in a day and I’m to scared to try and get more because my rng must be tanked.
---
Well yeah but I'm 1 def, low prayer (so no protect from melee/missiles) and I get wrecked by the 20+ level 132 wolves on the way up, and even if I make it to the top I have no food left for the final fight
---
I think he means level wise, not time
---
I did and our mtx holds your game up completely, I'm not being high and mighty
---
Offers "expire" if you leave them in for too long, I think a week.
---
You're asking for downvotes and here's why if you fail to see these reasons on your own.
---
You have **0 PvP suggestions** (more on 50-70 wilderness later) in your post. More PvM/Skiller content in the wilderness is not going to help PvP but rather hurt it. Bulk of your suggestions are designed to attract PvMers and skillers, the other few are designed to make PvMers more easy to kill. These suggestions are clearly aimed at accommodating salad robe pkers against PvMers and skillers and definitely not "all parties" as you claim.
---
The deep level wilderness is absolutely laughable. Level 126 vs level 56 isn't the hot PvP content everyone is looking for. There was a post about World 45 deadman not too long ago talking about how the lack of combat bracket limitations turns away new players from the mode because high lvls pick on them.
---
Throwing new best gp/hr content into the wilderness is not "oldschool vide" but rather a death knoll for wilderness. We need content that makes it more profitable to attack other skulled PKers as opposed to PvMers. We also could use some limitations on gear that can be brought into wilderness (maybe seasonally changed) to change up the meta on a regular basis. More PvM/skilling content pretending to be "PvP updates" is going to get a consistent no from me.

For reference: last week Drone strikes hit Saudi oil fields and brought a halt to a portion of world oil production and this was trumps initial reactions
---
Zaff sad boy now
---
200 ea for bloods, 150 ea for souls at my boy Ali's shop. Otherwise, the only thing I use them for is resurrect herb.
---
But vermeer was a real person. So saying that someone is the real life version of him is confusing. I understand what youre saying though. Vermeer was a weird ass dude. Hed totally play runescape and have his kids play accounts for him.
---
Easily. Crystal Shield, Verac Helm, Arma Hode, Zammy Hide, Fury, Dragon Crossbow.
---
Yeah I’m exactly the same. I really want to get the pet, and it’s good money but it just burns me out if I do any more than like 20
---
I'm guessing the plugin that allows him to change his inventory to look like rs2/rs3 is 'helpibg him transition' from rs3, OP tell me if I'm right?
