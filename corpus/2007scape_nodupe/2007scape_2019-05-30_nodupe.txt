Lmfao at farming only from 1-99.

nice repost
---
Haha, I know not to click the links but I felt like looking a bit deeper into it. 
---
The address the email was sent to was not the one associated with my account so I’m not worried for my account security at all, was just really curious as to what they could hope to achieve by analysing who clicks their links. 
---
Cheers for the input!
---
I'd like to do The Dig Site on my ironman but I need 10 herblore. Any suggestions for getting that easily?
---
This is fantastic, and I fully support this, even though i would likely never use it being a high level olayer. Hopefully it gets noticed by the right people.

To have the fastest loading house you need to have it 4x4 with no upper floor or dungeon
---
Would’ve been more impressive if you started with 99 slayer first /s
---
Damn son
---
You can bring a stack of alchable items. I use alchmate.com and go to the stable pricing.  That way you can do something while waiting for the wine to drop. Tbh I made my first bond F2P the rest p2p. That first but of time sucked. A YouTube person did a spot where he was gonna make it to a bond on F2P gave up, and help up a sign next to the street asking money for runescape membership. 20 minutes he got $20. I wouldn’t suggest begging irl or in game. But you gotta think what 11 is for you.
---
Scimitar will always be better
---
The email address I keep getting the emails sent to are from accounts made way back when OSRS first released that I have not used and also no longer have access to. The emails sure are a pain, but not much I can do about it now.  I have a separate, secure email for my actual account.
---
I make a lot of suggestions and I want them to be seen so I try to put a fair amount of Photoshop time into them. I rushed this one and it still took me about an hour and a half to get it right, but I was adding stuff as I went (didn't plan it out prior). 
---
The background image comes from the Wiki (it was/is the Old School Runescape website background?). I repeat it to make it as long as I need to. The font is Runescape UF (you can DL this with a quick google search). Otherwise I'm just using the photoshop skills I've picked up over the years.
---
I got my first one when someone else died at dark wizards.

wasn’t it free magic xp? Could be an okay method for those who can’t afford tunes, namely f2p, to train magic while enjoying them self
---
Yikes
---
[removed]
---
D scim is going to be better unless you are fighting something weak to stab, like dragons, then drag short sword
---
Even with 99 hp i don't find a problem with it. Wines cost next to nothing and the xp/profit far outweighs needed to drink 2-4wines a game imo
---
I wouldn’t be disappointed
---
Scimitar and shortsword are comparable, longsword is worse because it's slower. If you've already got scim, just keep using it.
---
Call sir Pugger
---
He was there. Or so I think it was him. He was beside himself. Not sure what his maulers name is
---
A new player (presumably not a member) can't do that. Side note; They also wouldn't know to do that because it's never declared ANYWHERE in-game that agility makes run energy last longer. 
---
However, I don't think making an iconic members skill free-to-play is the way to solve the issue. I'd prefer if Firemaking became the agility alternative for free to play, given it has hardly any uses at all there (no Wintertodt, no light sources, no infernal tools, nothing).
---
It’s not.
---
Up to you, but think about ever 50 trips or so saves you 1 trip.
---
Yes

No
---
Yeah that makes more sense I guess.

I hate to be that guy but I hit 200m without pet. I was 15m XP when pets released. Genuinely awful pet rates.
---
Oh news to me. But I appreciate the joke too haha.
---
You dumb af
---
550k Cannon balls :)
---
Time to pick bananas
---
Yes very easy, takes what 15 mins? Thats what would be easy to a new f2p, if you can get graceful in under 1 hour on a fresh account your comment is relevant.
---
Opportunity cost
---
I like the idea but I think the rates are pretty overpowered that you suggested
---
These replies look they were written by bots as well.
---
yes rs3 prif also has gauntlet and a skilling boss in it you are correct :)

---
Dont stake.
---
Don't get your hopes up, I haven't seen a Jmod reply yet. :P
---
Why do people feel the need to PK me when I'm clearly a noob with nothing of value? For reference, I was doing an Earth Warrior slayer task in Edgeville dungeon. Now I have to go buy a rune scimmy and get my rainbow boots back :(
---
Thank you.
---
My eternal slayer ring is my fail safe
---
Wtf
---
If it's for slayer, try the imbued slayer staff.
---
&gt; TBC was the beginning of the end for wow
---
what.
---
BC was miles better. Just because you were one of the prebc spamming hooligans doesn't make this untrue.
---
Balance was better, raids were better, progression was better. I cant think of a single piece of content that wasn't a drastic improvement over vanilla.
---
Maybe giving horde pally and ally shaman was scuffed? But even then it allowed for them to actually balance the damn classes.
---
Eternal glory was a nice albeit expensive solution to this daily occurrence for me!
---
I would've liked to see it just as a mobile QOL since it sometimes has some weird "hit" boxes on dropping fish.
---
Not gonna lie I’m 99 slayer and just started doing dag tasks at dks. I tried around 80 slayer and messed up the roaming so I got piled by all 3 then died and it took me 4 trips to get all my shit back so I just cannoned em in lighthouse
---
Wait, you can actually get matches?!
---
Same argument could be made for dungeoneering but all we get Is "reeeeee go play rs3" as people kill their reskinned rs3 monsters for reskinned rs3 drops
---
The only pets I got past 99 were Farming/Tangleroot at 27.9m Xp, Phoenix/FM at 55.7m Xp (ouch), Agility/Squirrel at 15.1m, and Chin+Herbi leaving me at 20.9m Hunter XP. Well under rate for the majority of pets, only one that was close was the Phoenix.
---
Yeah I agree with you and it looks like math is a real handicap in this thread
---
Congrats!
---
Wait, what generation does doomer refer to? Cause I qualify for 6/9 of these (including black hoodie/beanie and cig)
---
Fuuuuck that sucks
---
Even raids were kind of scuffed. ICC for example was thematically amazing but some of the fights were a real snooze.
---
What's the hitpoint meta for one-at-a-time accounts? I guess you have to get it before training combat, but how?
---
Nah I don't sorry :(
---
Stop
---
Wait you guys are getting paid??
---
Honestly this method would be a lot slower than shift dropping so I don't any reason against it
---
How would this work with things like entity hider in Runelite
---
Oh you sad minority. You’re fragility is palpable!
---
The Jordan Peterson book fucking killed me bro thumbs erect

---
Oh sorry, entirely my bad here. I was on mobile and definitely didn't word my comment right. I tagged onto your post because I entirely agreed with it, and was trying to add on.
---
Ie, what I mean to say is more of, 'Not only are you right that this doesn't 'fix' the problem, but I don't even think it's a 'problem' to begin with'.
---
I actually think the resting option makes sense, but I see why it scares the community.
---
That shit is actually so annoying while smithing and always keeps coming back no matter what.
---
It’s the clothes that make the man.. Can’t have the stamina of tribesman AND the arms of Arnold, my friend.
---
&gt;You can honestly not think that picking flax and doing agility for amylase are anywhere near the same
---
Okay, first off, I said *spinning flax*. You buy the flax for 2/3gp, you don't waste time picking it. The profit is spinning it into Bowstrings, which sell for ~100gp. OSRS wiki lists this at about ~125k/hr. 
---
I can't find a hard number for profit farming Amylase, but I know from my time training Agility that you can expect ~10-15 Marks/hour. Each mark is ~8k, so that gives us...80k-120k/hr! 
---
Pretty close to the same! Some would even say *near*. 
---
As the rest of your post is purely ideological, I won't say you're wrong - you're entitled to your opinion - but we know Jagex very much cares about the new player experience. It's unrealistic to play a game expecting the developers to totally eschew new players in favor of their dedicated audience - new users/growth is key to any game, especially any game made by a publicly traded company who has to answer to investors. 
---
You can say "if you don't like it play something else" all you want, but that isn't a viable game design choice. If that were a viable philosophy nothing should *ever* be updated. If you don't like OSRS only having one raid **go play something else!** If you don't like having to use inventory slots for your runes **go play something else!**. 
---
The Jmods operated under this philosophy for the first year or so of OSRS, but *strangely enough* found that it made for a pretty stagnant game that bled players. So they resolved to **make changes** to the game over time, while keeping the 'old school spirit'. That's the compromise here. 
---
Like it or not, there are potential solutions to the game's issues that can help new players while not ostracizing/devaluing long-time players like you or ruining the spirit of the game. And Jagex *is interested* in making those changes, because - despite however dystopic your view of it is - they *want more people playing their game*.
---
Good stuff. But why arcane over crystal shield for beginners? I’ve heard it doesn’t make much difference unless you’re going for like sub 70 or so
---
Nothing I love more than people not realising that void gear gives good magic defence bonuses, similar to d hide.
---
You can begin the grueling world hopping and waiting if picking up steel platelegs in the wildy. That’s what f2p players do on Ironman accounts to get cash.
---
Too real....
---
And the even more sad part is some of the shitty things they’re polling that still don’t address the biggest problems is that I guarantee you a lot of the PvP polls STILL won’t pass because the same thing will happen where people who don’t even PvP downvote anything PvP related going in the game. 
---
Honestly I guess it’s better the shit they’re polling sucks, it’s less disappointing when it gets spite voted out of existence.
---
Would have to be pretty shitty to be 99 everything else and still take 6 months to a milestone for even rc
---
&gt;Thinking that this is some playground where you've just won a game of hopscotch, LOL! Look over there, I think I see someone with lunch money!
---
&gt;Well I'm not mad or anything

When he tweets and goes on the Joe Rogan podcast and talks about all the "positives" he experiences from a carnivorous diet without discussing the major negatives (ie, increased cholesterol), he subconsciously is encouraging his massive following to also try out this diet.

Thanks for the suggestion

Ahh. He placed his tongue between his bottom lip and top row of teeth. Common mistake. Ya hate to see it.
---
This is like when you sneeze, fart, and shid at the same time
---
This would legitimately be a good firemaking buff IMO.
---
Sorry Clearly only cares about when people bot or script in Pvm and skilling. They just don’t have the manpower to give a slight chance at a fuck if it’s PvP related.
---

Calling BS. It's obvious that there are other boats.
---
You can thank twitch prime loot which gives them 30 days membership for like 400k each acc or less
---
Firemaking technically has its uses. Pretty much just a requirement for some quests, but still. Pretty obvious it was an OG Runescape mechanic.
---
Damn, should have started zulrah earlier
---
F2P players can't. And they're the ones quitting on their first day, not first-time members who make a one month minimum monetary commitment to the game. 
---
And no, the solution isn't to make an iconic member's only skill free-to-play. New players won't even know what to do with agility as it isn't taught on tutorial island, nor does it say ingame that a higher agi level helps run restore faster.
---
Make it so fires temporarily reduce your carried weight be an amount per second.
---
You don't hit 60 and then just magically "clear" content in a few weeks in vanilla.
---
You're gonna be gearing up a 40 man for months in whatever raid you hopefully have on farm to clear bosses in the next one.
---
i can't believe you've done this
---
Around 1650 or 1700 maybe, that's probably where most people who are actually dedicated and actually like the game enough are. 
---
Then again this leaves out some pvp'ers most of which don't train skills for shit, so idek.
---
Pls dad

glad to see jmods are just as shit about their game as the players

I would like to remove a picture of me from the site.

What about making energy potions f2p?
---
I feel personally attacked lol
---
Rip
---
Nobody cares. It's not a huge challenge anymore.
---
I feel you. It was more a economic stabilizer. Magic and redwood logs especially have little impact these days. Also who wants to carry logs with them plus a tinderbox to Light fires as they run. If you put a larger restore on the magic/redwood logs and make it worth sacrificing those bag spaces then you’ll actually see it used on a member worlds.

Congratulations! I can’t wait until I get to equip my first abyssal whip!

Not really. It just has to give the player the illusion that it is quicker to wait than to walk.

Wait, people can respond to me?

Bro that's wild. Jagex for sure needs to crack down. Idk enough to suggest how tho

77 of these fuckers in one pic. If I counted correctly.

So like the sleeping bag from back in the day?
---
Orges near cwars, but you'll get better exp/hr unlocking annomite crabs on fossil island. And they're hella afk. And better than the clustered sand crabs. Sell the ACB and buy a BP with mith darts. Also a good option to just train range via slayer most tasks will yield more exp/he also. Cannon your just wasting money.
---
I hated that when I was new. Once I learned just how many forms and locations of teleportation there are, I got my ass in gear and unlocked a lot of them. It makes traveling SO much easier. I don’t often run out of energy anymore unless I’m doing some kind of skilling or questing that requires running back and forth without my full graceful.
---
Is every wave predictable like in fight caves?
---
Could you send it to me too please.
---
Man I miss the conversations at the fishing guild back in 2005/2006. Constant public chat. I spent probably a month straight in World 9 logging in daily after school and met so many of the regulars there. It was fun.

Damn too bad toxic cunts like u have to come back lol

lol that’s some serious teleports.

Chinning is so fast that you might as well concentrate for those few hours then be 99 range before you know it.

This happened to me on rs3 I got pk’d for nothing by a clan
---
Nmz is perfect. Cannon is a good idea. Where do you set up
---
What kind of xp rates? I've been dumping my cash stack that I accumulate each day into cannon balls
---
Snape grass give plenty exp tho
---
Doing a rough calculation, like 30m. Bloods would be around 100m but would take longer
---
I'm currently 72 range I've been doing caged ogres. I'll probably move somewhere else for better xp rates. It's about 43k xp/ hr 1800cannonballs/hr
---
Members or free game? I fished a lot in Catherby early OSRS (march/april 2013) with almost no chatting. Did a fair amount of fishing guild in 2015 with no chatting unless I started it and kept it going. Monkfish fishing in 2015 and 2019 was the same thing.
---
What's the minimum magic level recommended to start bursting in MM2 tunnels?
---
Sitting at 66 right now and not sure if it's worth it to use lesser burst spells until 70 or just keep teleporting/high alching.
---
Hey better than not getting a 3a item it all

The only good thing that can come of this is a progression based thing where they go into each expansion and maybe start tweaking the way things work instead of ignoring player wishes

Is cannon not more cost effective compared to blowpipe for xp? I heard bp was super expensive.
---
Right there with you buddy
---
How come they do castle wars?
---
Honestly if I weren’t doing it constantly for hours on end this looks actually really fun to learn and mess around with.
---
Grind up some magic to telegrab wine of zammy, or go wildy and kill the bots doing that for their stacks instead. Honestly, in F2P, there just isn’t a lot that’s good profit without heavy time investment in skilling. And that assumes you can outpace the bots.
---
Make sure you check out Quest lists. There's a lot of easy Quests that'll give you quite a few QP's.
---
Sheep Herder for example gives you 4 QP's and it only takes between 10 minutes and 12 hours.
---
What do you consider "playing the game"? Flipping is pretty enjoyable, it can be kind of like a gamble except with very little risk involved. I also like raiding and pking, all of those activities make money.  Do it for a few years and you'll find you have too much gold.  What to do with the gold you have no use for?
---
W2 used to have a lot of people there, idk how it's been since I quit. F2p also used to have bot wars but they all got banned so it died too.
---
2004 to 2013 I'm pretty sure.
---
What if you think all the boats are same level? Thr low lvl has the most players so he went there.
---
Dragon defender didn't exist 12 years ago lol

It feels like fishing or some other gathering skill tbh. I don’t think you realize how afk it is.

There is different types of blessed coif any recommendations?

yeah i think people totally underestimate wrist injuries, they can hit u out of nowhere and the constant pain can really reduce the enjoyment in your life.
---
I’m a simple man; I see why fletch I upvote
---
You’re just mad cause your treesmad
---
Just about everything is crashing right now because a mass swarm of bots has flooded into the game.
---
Lmao I didn't notice until you pointed it out wtf
---
Would like this to happen, currently watching it while training. Seen the series like 30 times
---
No, you're missing what I'm saying. We don't NEED mining to be able to mine rocks. Everything is an arbitrary requirement. Almost all of the skills in runescape could be baked into the fundamentals of the game. Everyone can cut a tree if they have an axe, why make it a skill? Mining something could just require a pickaxe. 
---
Slayer monsters aren't all the same, either. Gargoyles require smashing with a rock hammer. Lizards require ice. Zygomites require fungicide. Abby demons teleport around. Nechs spawn adds. A lot of Slayer mobs have bosses. Generally there's at least 1 extra mechanic, even if it's small, compared to most other lower level mobs. Remember this is a game from the early 2000s, mechanics just weren't complex like you'd expect today. Back then, those were enough of a difference to be considered something that has "a mechanic".
---
I'd rather all drops in collection log minus pet instead of including pet.
---
Look at how much time (and non enjoyment) he put into champ scrolls. 
---
Now imagine a pet on a boss that you can only kill a handful of an hour, and he gets unlucky. That'd be a month long wait for a video of him killing the same boss
---
That noob ain't right
---
Because botwatch is more oriented towards serverside behavioral detection rather than clientside detection, and obviously since most bots replicate human behavior pretty well, botwatch needs to have a high threshold to initiate a ban to prevent false positives, which in turn makes botwatch less effective.
---
most people would rather spend less time to reach a goal instead of spending more so obviously guides are going to reflect that. doesn't mean you can't do ya thing.
---
Sneeze, fart and cum*
---
I really like what it brings to firemaking though. If there was a way we could balance it for all tiers of log, I would love that. I myself just use a lot of stamina pots but still I wish there could be a niche use for using both methods of restoring your energy so potions are still just as valuable. I suppose you don't have to stop what you're doing and wait for your run to restore with potions so that's a plus.
---
Would love that, thanks :)
---
Yeah wait til you have sex pal you’re gonna be blown away
---
So definitely not worth to FFA unless you’re insane

---
Slayer helm and slayer rings should be your first priority. You could probably get Bigger and Badder before rings, but get after if you don’t. That will unlocks superior slayer monsters which spawn randomly during a task. After that you’ll want to block iron and steel drags, and spiritual creatures. Any other blocks just use on stuff you dislike.
---
Same boat. I’m 25k from 99 slay and I have never set foot in the DK lair. Borderline max gear too but I just don’t wanna die down there. Idk maybe I’m just being a massive puss.
---
This is by far the smartest suggestion I’ve ever seen to make fire making more useful too
---
cheapest one, all have the same stats
---
Felt this way when i finally got barrows gloves
---
Congrats my mans
---
I used to love screaming about it. Hell, I still do!
---
False title. Gf’s are xp waste
---
This is also why stealing creation won't happen. People won't vote for xp rate increases, so they'd need to make the rewards weaker, which would only make them not worth going for anymore.
---
Though I think people would be much more against the double xp halving the required amount of raw materials to train the relevant skills, than they would be against a slight increase in xp per hour.
---
That's a meme I haven't seen in a long, long time...
---
I don't think iron or steels are a problem, it's a pretty easy task
---

I've heard of plenty of people autoclicking for high alch and getting away with it. I don't think Jamflex cares anymore, just as long as they pay for a bond.

7 days membership trial from mobile is far more damaging than twitch prime loot.

Have we forgotten about the print screen button already?
---
Ye, I use it
---
&gt;Your 1 week old acc thing is pretty ok, but in order for it to work, they should have at least 1 week play time (rather than just making an acc and logging off for a week).
---
Then they'll just leave the accounts logged for a week.

Yeah, but if you have multiple screens, or don't want to show the whole screen without editing it's much better

Great way to get GP using your noob alt though. I don't mean begging either, just level poorly and they'll give you the GP just to flex on everyone.
---
Hated when they made the clarity update to make all ice barrages after the first become a weird ice sphere. It was odd because the ice block would freeze them in place then the sphere would be every cast after until they're unfrozen, seeing the 2005 animation with a 2011 animation used interchangeably was jarring
---
What would you recommend for minimum stats for Vorkath? Never done a boss before. 80 attack, 91 strength, 79 defence, 75 magic, 72 range, 80 prayer
---
Watch the dks guide by asuyaken OSRS, he made it piss easy when I had never been before.
---
Damn this is fire

I spent summer 2005-2006 at the fishing guild in 66... I miss those days. I'll join you! :)

I'm just here to agree with you and further suggest those sources

Looks like an alt

How is this easyscape? It's only ever so slightly more afk then regular fishing at a tremendous exp drop.
---
Xp from herb patches is negligible compared to fruit trees

Sorry. Law of large numbers differs depending on the study.

The MINIMUM is 33. That's it.

I thought it was low as well.

---
They're generalising and mocking different generations of runescape players. 
---
Because runescape had been around for so long and has so much diverse content that there are people easily 20 or 30 years apart in age playing the same game for very different reasons.
---
Ghrazi rapier will most likely take a dip because of Blade of Saeldor.
---
How did it feel training str to 99 with only 1 atk? Assuming you have another account like a main?
---
I'm kinda counting on that to buy low haha
---
I know you're trying to give another use to Firemaking. It doesn't make sense that sitting next to a fire would increase run energy, but you can't sit and rest anywhere? It also means you have to train Firemaking, and carry logs and a tinderbox with you.
---
I like the idea and the effort in presenting it in a clear way, but I don't see why we don't just introduce resting by sitting on the floor anywhere
---
It’s gonna be a long time before my OSRS account is anywhere near what it was in 2007.
---
1500 is way to low
---
You may be better off just having a lookup table of XP values and searching through it to find the appropriate level.
---
The Lambert W-function solves for x, when y = x * e^x. Most inverses of functions that involve both linear terms and exponential terms end up being related to the W-function.
---
Yea let's just kill any semblance at all that npcs are alive just do we can have more ezscape
---
I have all the void sets and the torso.
---
The torso was WAAAAAAAAAY easier to get. Full void is a painful grind. Like 15-16 hours for full melee/range/mage. 
---
Torso only took me like 2 and a half hours. A lot of higher level players don’t really mind teaching you at BA, at least in my experience.
---
Hopefully with a shared bank, either alongside individual banks or (preferably) only a shared bank.

Theres the issue of trust but if youre making a group ironman with people theres already an element of trust there.
---
You didn't survive the fight caves, you dont get a cape
---
Because osrs is boof sometimes.
---
You get the fire Cape for completing the fight caves, not defeating Jad. You have to stay alive otherwise you will not get rewards.
---
I'm gonna get downvotes but if you are an efficiency guy you are a huge nerd and your life is suffering socially, health wise and economically. Games should only be for fun period
---
I killed Jad, game froze, and then when it catches back up it says I won and lost.
---
haha perhaps. too much time spent researching lol
---
I've been playing overwatch since it came out and even before and I only have like 600 or so hours in it. I've had a lot of fun playing all the heroes and objectives and playing with friends but half of my time in overwatch equals just rune crafting. Fuck.

Just don't die
---
How can you be so sure they're a bot though? There's a reason why they have a few people in their ICU team. If people knew how they detected bots, they wouldn't be able to tell they're bots. This is a stupid idea.
---
There wasn’t a smack down. It appears that this might have been legit.

I did some pretty ballpark math and assumed a lot on how long the actions might actually take and I got around 3k/hr. Not including the time to heat water and put it in cups. I could be really wrong on some of the numbers but I’m going say it’s safe to assume that it isn’t worth doing
---
afk'd most of it to be honest. It felt pretty crappy. Took a long time, but we go there in the end :)
---
My second monitor is a square monitor and I have it tilted toward me so putting rs on that is kinda easy and probably less "turning" effort than the full widescreen monitor
---
They are an afk relaxing task that generates money. 
---
But with poor slayer exp/hour. So skip if u want faster slay exp.
---
Bigger and badder, slayer helm, blocks. Whatever order works best for you. If you're a lower slay level and arent getting assigned things requiring headgear(dust devils, spectres, etc) you can wait on the helm and just imbue a black mask.

-download adb drivers
---
-use phone usb-c cable to connect quest to pc
---
-open cmd "adb devices"
---
-accept prompt on oculus for permission
---
-in cmd type "adb install {apk file path}

there's already easier tools to help you out as well.

Such as SideQuest on GitHub.

mith darts in blowpipe is such a noob trap

They've recently added a storage vault in the farming guild for seeds and saplings. It helps you save some space in your bank if you're gathering a lot.

---
Oh that’s awesome. I’m still learning all the newer content of OSRS, I played back in 2010 or so but just started again.
---
Still, the content will eventually run out, and I don't think most people will play until they have done every piece of raiding content. That is like saying people don't quit OSRS until they've done ToB, people get burned out.
---
I miss OG Maplestory..
---
Stop! You violated the law!
---
Yeah, serverside can get manipulated too, just run a shit load of bots and have them log the behaviors they do, once you get banned, and repeat that behavior, you then know what behaviorists botwatch picks up on.
---
Any anti-something is always susceptible to getting bypassed, anti fraud, anti cheat, anti ddos, anti virus, anti spam, anti theft, etc, **all** of these things have one thing in common, and that is none of them have ever been 100% accurate and 100% perfect, the idea of an anti-something is to mitigate the issue, not completely eliminate it, because that task is impossible.
---
Jagex would heavily benefit from improving their clientside anticheat, and no i'm not talking about a driver based hard drive/system ram resource hogger anticheat, just simply an improved version of the clientside botwatch that is already implemented and baked into the client, that does not require any special permissions, does not invade privacy, and does not break third party client and multi-os compatibility (since it runs within the JVM), it would be a much needed additional layer of security.
---
They are farming mysterious emblems. Waiting to get each other as targets and then killing one another for the emblems.
---
Hell yeah brother
---
The rc meta is now even higher xp/hr with even more trading involved 🤷‍♀️
---
I could see that as a clue scroll item, that gives no cooldown on home teleports when equipped
---
Most of the comments here are from whiny little sjw bitches and I hope jagex is not taking any of you seriously. Everything you complained about is not what is wrong with wildy/pking. In these comments you basically complained about it being hard, and how you want it to be easier. Boohoooo.  The last time jagex touched wildy to make it easier for you simpleton the game died. Pking (in the way that you get all the loot the other player is risking) is what made runescape different from every other mmo. It's what got me hooked as a kid. When they made it easier and more like every other game is when runescape died. If you want easy/retarded pking go play rs3.  Most of you commenting don't even seem like pkers , so why try ruining something that isn't broken just because you suck at it?
---
Just saying I’ve literally never heard of it happening and I’ve played this game a very long time. Dunno why I’d get downvoted
---
Be sure to grab the chronicle from django
---
Goblins are the best for beginner clues at 1/64 rate I believe. Very quick to get
---
I get that, but for a "common" drop to not happen after a considerable amount of kills it feels like it's not just bad luck. If the wiki is outdated an update would be great, or if the rats drops are bugged we should get some heads up.
---
Thanks for answering a cutenoob
---
Great idea. Doesn't really hurt higher lvled people, and gives an incentive to train firemaking!
---
On top of Runelite....If you use Chrome, install the OSRS redirector plugin. 
---
This game used to have its wiki run through the “Wikia” or “Fandom” site, but has since moved to a different domain.
---
Old site is no longer moderated and for a while was vandalized. Information may no longer be accurate. Also new changes in the game are no longer updated there.
---
So use the new wiki page: 
---
oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
I also recommend checking out the ‘Optimal Quest Guide’ page while you’re there. If you create an account on the wiki, you can click checkboxes and stuff and it will save as long as you’re logged in.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
"old"
---
yes, he has high defence so every bit of accuracy and defence lowering counts. get a salve amulet (ei) as well.
---
I always forget about the minigame teleports
---
Why though?
---
You actually don't even need to be logged in to save the checkboxes :)
---
Fucking togglescape, no one knows this unless you were playing at the time of the update AND read the "in other news.." section word to word every time.
---
Thank you. Didn't know this one.
---
1) That's tracking player TOTAL damage instead of individual hitsplats.  
---
2) Unless you think you can hit decimals, that counter is NOT accurate.
---
Just do agility. It's not tough to get to the gnome stronghold and start from there.
---
Ya that’s an option and I wouldn’t really mind inputting the entire table into my spreadsheet but if there is an easier, streamline-able way to just have the number calculated for me I’m willing to try that
---
doesnt look very runescape related tbh
---
I’ve seen that clip a few times but I never found out what the show is and what’s its supposed to be about. Is it like an abuse rehab sort of thing for these people?
---
Settle down there chad
---
Damn ! Do you guys get pinged immediately upon any mention of the wiki ? Haha.
---
But also, I hop between different computers so I try to stay logged in on the wiki just for good measure :)
---
I cant like this enough
---
You didn’t let thr snoop dog stuff?
---
It takes like 3 minutes from respawn to your loot pile (assuming you have a Waterbirth TP/portal). Plenty of time with the current gravestone meta.

---
I’d love to start doing ToB, but can’t because I can’t use comms (living situation atm). It’s what drove me to learn solo CoX. Never actually did a raid until I learnt Solo CoX, ever since then I’ve gotten ~300kc all solo. As soon as I get a house, that’s when I’ll finally be able to raid seriously.

Use a combat calculator and just max out your stats for your combat level.
---
I still use fandom whenever possible as it works at my work computer lol whereas wiki doesnt annoyingly
---
That's just like, your opinion man.. 
---
If you want to talk about being fair, you have to accept that there are 'normal' players that enjoy getting the most out of the time they have to play. I'm 26 years old, married, a homeowner, and I work a full time job. I did 3t Barb Fishing to 99 because I wanted to get the fastest rates I could, and I enjoyed it.
---
I'm not saying that it's for everyone, but there's nothing autistic about clicking a bit more to save yourself 80+ hours in finishing a skill. So put that in your pipe and smoke it m8

Itd be nice if the wiki had a section dedicated to listing out all the various toggles and options throughout the game. The alternate teleports, these toggles, etc.

Dhcb is like 80% accurate without specs and just a few percent more with specs so I don't bother.

Can anyone link a sick sc video i wanna watch when stoned

It says exactly what it always said

Honestly, I ain't that mad at pkers, I was just referencing [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bufbfv/seeing_a_fire_cape_after_your_256th_inferno).
---
Since the blowpipe has a relative low accuracy but high attack speed, reducing the defence will make you hit way more often, making you hit so much more since the attack speed is alread high.
---
Alternative is a dragon hunter crossbow, and a crossbow has by itself a huge accuracy bonus compared to blowpipe, making a bgs/dwh not that usefull. (+ bolt effects)
---
Stolen Meme with no credit given Yikes!

Where your beard/lack of beard goes. It's a back-end slot system.

Sorry if you’re upset about it, lad! When I was younger I thought other players that had a whip were like the coolest looking. I had no idea how to go about it when I was 12. Obviously it’s a goal that’s stuck with me because 12 years later I’ve achieved it and I’m pleased about it. Sorry if this bums you out dude!

It was good and popular after the nuke

I have the same kitty litter box. Hmm.

Because stam pots can be used while running.

If you have to stop and rest at a fire mid-agi training it cuts into your exp rate.

Its okay. I ran out of darts on wave 58 on my last run. I have 99 range and no fire cape
---
Should have a complaint flair...
---
It very well may be my second 99. Str being my first. I’m also doing bird house runs right now. I’ve been doing those and farming religiously the last 2 days.

It really does!

---
Okay, I admit. I made mis-presentations about energy restoration. But I still say 4x energy restoration at level 1 is too much like I said: zero effort for massive boost.
---
But r/towelcat made the calculations:
---
"Base energy regen is 8, multiplied by 8 is 64.
---
10000/64 = 157 ticks of sitting at a fire
---
Energy used per tick of running is 64 + weight. Assuming 0 (or less) kg:
---
10000/64 = 157 ticks of running, or 314 squares total
---
So we've spent 314 ticks to travel 314 squares. That's identical to pure walking. Walk+running (at 0 kg and 1 agil) is ~11% faster.
---
Good luck coming up with a resting formula that is not overpowered, not useless, and not convoluted. Keep in mind how harsh the penalty is for extra weight carried."
---
Yeah, good luck at making this energy restoration balanced. Why I even wasted 1 hour pondering theories and writing my long comment when it's literally impossible to appeal community enough?
---
I just bail from this thread and watch next Q/A what Jagex thinks about this.
---
You could give me any stimulant you want, and pay me on top of it and I would still never be able to do this for an hour. The repetition of such autistic shit is the direct opposite of what my ADD brain can handle.

---
The whole point of training agility and getting graceful is to recharge your stamina faster. If you introduce this, it undermines everything agility is already about.
---
1.5t is basically 3t teaks but u get 2 logs everytime so yea its more efficient
---
How in the literal fuck do people do this for hours on end, let alone find it genuinely fun to do unless you are on the autism spectrum or dont do anything all day?
---
I could not fathom coming home from a long day, going to train and then eating as much as I could after........and then sitting down to do hours of "superfirebury". Id be way too tired and itd take far too much mental energy/focus to do, let alone the fact it would be the most tedious "chore" I could imagine. Like do these people who try to max EHP have careers/lives or do they try and do this type of stuff all day? I would need a serious dose of a stimulant to even attempt to do this when I come home.
---
Like sure...you may save "x" hours at the cost of your sanity but there is also no rush to get "x" number of XP or level. I only skill for whatever req I really need but I also do most of it AFK as possible while I do other things and especially with mobile's existence now you can essentially get xp/levels for "zero" time cost if you do it while doing other shit.
---
Obviously I dont think these people really care about saving time (unless youre doing it to try and max as fast as possible...which is probably a bit unhealthy anyway), they care about EHP though so I suppose its different.
---
&gt; How hard is it to understand that it is incredibly difficult to update PvP
---
How hard is it to understand that this is nothing but a bullshit cop out that Jagex has fed to people like you? If you were a regular member of the PvP community youd know thats absolutely not true and there have been plenty of great suggestions to fix things that have been put forth over the years from content creators/the most experienced/best PvPers. 
---
There are MANY things that need fixing that would not be "incredibly difficult", hell they wouldnt even be "regular difficult", some could be quite simple.
---
For example:
---
Apparently simply adjusting the magic defense % calculation from rolling so heavily off your magic level is...a difficult thing? Because thats literally all they would have to do to make mage accuracy far less dogshit and broken. Mind you, thats been a big problem for a long time...and Jagex hasnt even acknowledged it because theyre too busy putting more fucking WINE OF ZAMORAK spawns in the wilderness.
---
&gt; So better start small and at least get something in the game. Rather than run around in circles constantly.
---
Huh? You realize these basically are not PvP updates at all right? Hell a few of them are outright PvM updates. They dont need to "run around in circles", the PVP community has been trying to give them direction on what exactly are the problems and what exactly to focus on/do for a long time. You genuinely think these are legitimate excuses after ignoring PvP for years? If anything they should be focusing on the bigger problems that need fixing in PVP first to make up for lost time...I mean they have had YEARS to discuss and work on them right(well not really, they clearly have not spent any of that time even discussing PvP). What more evidence do you need that they have put 0 time/effort or thought into PVP than the "big BH Rework" they announced in 2017 being nothing but adding some cosmetics and having a leaderboard? Like really....they took 2 years to come up with that?
---
Same issue here for nearly all my weapons. Good job Jagex

At this point im expecting the "good stuff" to be adding yet another PvM wilderness update and labeling it as a "PvP update" or some other random bullshit that does nothing to address the core problems that exist with PVP and its mechanics/gameplay. 
---
I mean these are the same people who apparently took over 2 years to release an update on their 2017 "big BH rework" and it ended up being that they plan on adding more cosmetics and a leaderboard. Its got to be a very strong mix of both pure incompetence on knowing what to do with PvP (even though theyve been told and suggested things over and over again for years what needs to be done) as well as plain old "we dont give a fuck".
---

Good job runelite*

The bots at Master Farmer have become some unbearable. I don’t remember seeing this many a couple months ago, but I guess it’s from the free members promotion. Shits stupid
---
Did the players they talked to reveal their suggestions?
---
gonna ruin the joke here but that's also on ancient spellbook
---
I'd rather have aids
---
runelite bug.
---
You probably just got the wrong knight. The one that spawns north in the market square has always done that.
---
This goes for pretty much any account on the internet. If you have an unsecured email linked to an account and that email gets hack you can a lot.   
---
Think of an email like a car key. If you lock (secure) your car, but leave the key out in the open it's not an issue with the cars security if it gets stolen.
---
Ah gotcha lol I was gonna say pking the abyss can be great money, a buddy of mine got an eternal glory that way. 😂
---
At what level/bank value do you guys recommend starting to try and obtain an inferno cape? I’m way more into my PvM on this game and would like to get it at some point, however I doubt I’ll ever obtain a twisted bow so I’d be using the ACB method.
---
I assume your character still has hair where it's kept ;)
---
feels like the extra tick for animation before u shrink and go purple is evened out by the destination loading faster at other end. similar to karamja gloves. Also not a static tile destination. still v nice for non 99 craft ppl
---
Fucking hell ash puts up with some shit. He’s just complaining for the sake of complaining really.
---
Lmfao thank you
---
Exactly the same as you.
---
Debated grinding out fremmy elite so many times, as always wanted teleports, but now thanks to the imbued lure I won’t bother..
---
There is an enormous master quest in the works currently with an entire new area.  Osrs has a very small team and is working with ancient code.  You need to reign in your expectations.
---
the back end slot is one
---
jesus fucking christ this attitude is fucking sickening
---
This game does not need a constant spam of updates, the vast vast majority of the playerbase hasn't completed a fifth of the content in this game. 
---
Stop trying to force the Jmods to rush through ill-thought updates for the sake of updates
---
such a terrible comment
---
qa LUL
---
lyre teles to the entrance tho, boots tele into the marketplace so still better for clues/vork
---
Hard agree
---
Elite unlocks teleport to neitiznot, and now that it can be unlimited it's the closest teleport to a bank. I'm doing the elite tasks this weekend purely for that.
---
I hate drop training and would happily exchange some exp/hour for less clicking.
---
Same kind of thing exists for buying packs of items from shops, you can click them all to open faster or wait for your character to slowly open them.
---
Agreed, I refuse to use it. People who use it all the time must have issues.
---
So what?
---
Lol bro true neckbeards get 6 hour logged twice a day
---
No problem!
---
Lol I understand the frustration at 250kc I had two necklace drops and at 300 I got a celestrious seed also 1/3k. 
---
Appreciate the drops just blows it's the same drop rate as the pet
---
Neckbeards get shit done
---
The infernal cape is nice and all...
---
But what if it ran on propane?
---
&gt; Does anyone really need to be told that kodai wand and trident are two different things? 
---
It seems so. Considering [this poll](https://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1557) results, especially question 9.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Stonetoss I upvote.
---
also, a few years ago (3 i think) pidbullz was a legit noob in this game, he had no clue how shit worked and was just a cute noob. Then he started nolifing, and becoming better, and now he's elitist as fuck it's funny lmao.
---
F2p don't need someone to tell them to click on a tree
---
Pretty good but I always picture OSRS neckbeards as the unhealthily stick-thin kind rather than the morbidly obese kind, because eating is XP waste
---
The fact that RWT is everywhere on the main game makes me only ever want to play ironman. I look at lvl 90 noobs that just got 65 defence and are kitted out in the BIS gear. Like what has happened to this game? If it isn’t rwting then it’s botting, plenty of regular players bot too and never get detected as they’re not gold farmers.
---
Safe like every one else and learn 2 to 1 tick ags from msb into gmaul or godsword whack then double gmaul

Nah i'm fat then again i'm not efficent so it's true lol
---
&gt; Jagex releases an interesting update  
---
"WTF RS3 get this shit out of my oldschool REEEEEEE"
---
Its hardly a nerf they are just making it cost more.
---
Addy dart is 7.75x more expensive to use in a place where your cannon does almost all the work. You will overhit so often. You'd be better spending the extra gp on more cannonballs
---
Thicc v2
---
&gt; Exactly what i mean lmao. You are suggesting a massive change to how magic defence is calculated, then acting like it is "no big deal"
---
...what? Thats not a "massive change", its fixing something that has been broken? And not to mention its an incredibly simple fix. Thats by far the biggest reason and biggest problem as to why mage defense is broken and mage is such shit in PvP unless youre risking hundreds of mills. 
---
Apparently taking it from 70% of your magic level and making it something more actually balanced and sensical like say...50%? is a massive change? I honestly dont think you really have any clue about magic in PVP or PvP in general if youre trying to suggest that is some massive change or that everything that needs to be fixed with PvP would be some massive undertaking that would take a ton of time and effort (which isnt even an excuse anyway, when theyve had over 2 years to do "something" and instead did absolutely nothing). 
---
&gt; The main thing i see PKers cry about is how "dead" the wilderness is. Updates like the zammy wines and slayer keys are meant to make the wilderness more active.
---
Ok lol, now its more than abundantly clear you have virtually no experience PKing or know whats wrong with PvP if you genuinely think adding yet ANOTHER Zammy Wine spawn to the wilderness will make it less dead, or that wilderness slayer keys would either, thats nothing but a PVM update disguised as a "PvP" update like theyve done for years when they could be focusing on the real big problems in PvP.
---
Zammy wine spawn: Literally the 3rd one. The first one in 1 wildy is pretty much camped by bots. The 2nd one is at the wildy Altar and the only thing its used for is suiciding when running bones. The 3rd one in deep wildy will most likely legitimately become another Bot farm...nothing else because it will be super inefficient to acquire them and Ironmen dont really train herblore with ranging pots either. Zammy wines are not expensive enough nor needed enough by people to warrant it actually driving meaningful traffic towards it. 
---
Wildy Slayer keys: Wildy slayer is already semi dead content because its really only useful for point farming and is shit XP and GP compared to normal slayer which is much, much better for both. Adding some keys that you will need to open in the wilderness that will probably have the same value as Konar's keys will not all the sudden make Wildy Slayer even remotely good GP/hr or entice people to do it outside of if they need to farm points.
---
Neither one of these will do much of anything, and will become dead content themselves (unless the wildy key rewards are REALLY good). These are PvM updates.
---
&gt; And there is never a unified opinion on how PvP should be "fixed".
---
Sure there is lol? Youd be hard pressed to find anyone in both singles PKers and the multi community not be unified that mage defense is broke and magic is shit and that its broken the combat triangle as a result. As far as the biggest and main problems that PvP has, the people who PK the most generally agree on what are problems. You may not realize this because you clearly dont spend much time at all in PVP and talking within these communities but the idea that "nothing can be decided upon" is just false.
---
That's how mafia works
---
Where is this?
---
Why not play both? After all, they're two different kinds of games. One has a long, but fun and enjoyable grind, with a rewarding endgame. And the other is Runescape.
---
Yeah I voted way back then &amp; didn't want 2007 to be honest, I just wanted pre-eoc &amp; before the armour models were changed. I approve of this current state by a long shot, imagine OSRS never had updates from the beginning and people just had to kill KBD/KQ all day or try to max their accounts which I could picture a lot of people would have burnt out with the methods back at the start.
---
Doesn't he just post those ironically? I don't think he's ever actually stated he's a nazi.
---
Thanks cya
---
Full obsidian + obby sword
---
There are more people playing vanilla and legacy wow private servers than there are people(not bots) playing osrs lol
---
No but the point is the Autocasting / attack style update was very recent, I've never one had to even consider weapon categories before now. While I agree it is quite easy to determine what weapon is what remember that we pretty much all started playing when we were very young and as the game grows there are still young people being introduced who may not immediately make the connection.
---
Also the categories aren't based on attack style like stab / slash as you can quite clearly see there are categories such as polearms in the picture.
---
This update would change the whole dynamic of the weapon, decreasing the stats of the weapon is a much better idea IMO
---
Anymore gp left in keldagrim/nmz/poh/miscellanea coffers?
---
It’s who she is. It takes work to get that belli
---
Using a third party application and blaming jagex for its issues LUL
---
Apparently 
---
a fit of rage= just mentioning the fact Jagex has done a really, really poor job with these things while you try to make excuses that hold no water for them
---
Right....you sure are making a ton of sense right now.
---
The plan is to make an attachment, it will still be 50% spec. Thats why i say its hardly a nerf
---

To count each tick so as to not miss any xp of course.

I know what that one fucking HC did. It only happens if you die at last tick. For fucks sake.

You're a person with half a brain but the concept of inflation is too hard to grasp?
---
 Jagex cant exactly force people to buy them for more GP on the GE, because then there wouldn't be enough demand and bonds wont sell. Unless they subsidize them which would cause massive inflation as GP is being created out of thin air.
---
That's actually so fucking cool
---
Very worried about any mention of Trump, not in a politics subreddit. Coward!
---
Well at that point you have the boots and it doesn't matter if they're devalued or not?
---
Your's aren't?
---
I think the reason was more for f2p but even for f2p, it would be a neat feature that would be cool and possibly useful for some people. Also, strange fruit is not common to get, energy pots are expensive (at least for f2p), stams are expensive and not everyone has a rejuv pool. It also gives FM more diverse content which is key for the games success (I mean giving things more diversity is good for the overall health, not just solely for fm).
---
Rev caves seem fine. Highest pvm gp in the game other than raids. Risk being slaughtered. Making it less likely PKers want to go there completely defeats the purpose of the caves.

Damn! With that Wildy slayer update this may be the thing that finally makes me get into it
---
40% more loot per hour AND less exp per hour also means you get a lot more loot on the way to 99. I do it on my main because I think the loot per exp is almost twice as much.
---
Yo thanks for this. Gonna max out melee now
---
&gt; I'm assuming they'll be leaning more towards niche content like OSRS has been doing.

"I can see what hitsplats I'm doing instead of having to guess based on the amount of xp I just got? This is fucking unplayable I quit and the game will die in 10 years"

????????????????????????
---
you mean like meds vs pures? I like playing pures because less 0s and more exciting game play.
---
You would have been better off using the blowpipe as you can 100% always get 1 attack off and usually 2. But you got to done so you beat it!
---
that's more accurate
---
how would group ironman work? Would there be a limit to groupsize like 5 players? Would there be a shared banks between all in the group etc?

Different strokes. The agency you have to choose how to play OSRS is what makes it such a great game.
---
2 tick sword fish is slightly faster fishing xp than 3 tick barb fishing, but barb is better ehp.
---
I'm not triggered, but these kind of updates just clutter the screen and have no benefit at all.
---
It's more muscle memory
---
Lol. All of them werent even related to pvp except the tb timer which ofc passes because it makes it easier for people to escapd.
---
Lmao
---
I chose BA and need a partner
---
I agree, but i also feel if you're at the point that you have a dark totem you shouldn't be dying to skotizo.

Perhaps he should try to hit up Home Teleport instead since she's on everyone's book.

---
There are people who sell higher tiered emblems on the BH world (I believe the CC is bh and chill).  It costs about 1m last I checked for the t7 (enough for a pouch)
---
Oh no I was aware. When I saw the update was coming I decided I would make the joke. Didn’t realize it was so overdone. I’m well aware that this game isn’t dead
---
Sand or ammonite crabs would be ideal.
---
Focus on training your strength to 70 first though. Higher strength allows you to hit higher meaning more experience, which directly allows you to train the other skills faster if you train strength first.
---
Imagine saying that efficient grinding is not fun in a grinding game, while at the same time grinding for 4x the ammount of time because that's way more fun.
---
Is locking the area and charging a fee your suggestion or theirs? I didn't catch the QA
---
It sounds a bit too strict, imo. Many times you can only be in there for like 2 minutes or less without running into a clan and having to tele, paying 10k for each entry would feel bad
---
They don't want to kill off one of the most popular pking spots
---
Those were the days I couldn't convince my parents to spend any amount of money on my entertainment
---
By saying irons will appreciate, he's just giving an opinion, and and actually a fact. Same as other spots, in any PvP area, the chances of dying depend on your ability to outplay the oponents. As the wine grabber, if you pay attemtion you may avoid death, but the pker might outsmart you by logging under you. A bad pker won't do that.
---
Again, he's not defending anything, he just gave you valid points.
---
So stop being so salty, and pretending everything is a personal attack.
---
Nobody is talking about how nice of a rack their daughter has so
---
Honestly it looks really fun for like 10 mins. There's something about doing stuff tick-perfect that's like a fun challenge. I couldn't imagine doing it for any serious amount of time though.
---
It's f2p
---
I don’t understand wtf OP means at all. Just butchered English.
---
Definitely. I just tried to make that sign and it hurt a lot more than expected.
---
Bring like 10 chins or something, so when healers spawn just switch to chins and aggro all of them at once with the aoe
---
Not trying to poke a hole in your lengthy post with a good amount of information but vorkath doesn't have low ranged defense and is overall a pretty bad method of ranged training especially without Dhcb. If you have blow pipe you should be reseting if you don't land bgs and reseting every kill. Lunar Island teleport to bank and then get kicked off the island on purpose to get back to the boss.

There's rotation guides out there that literally outline exactly what phases Zulrah will go through. Google "Zulrah rotations" and look at the images. Usually people finish off Zulrah before a single rotation is complete. If you don't finish Zulrah off in one rotation, it will start a new rotation at random.

They should make it so you can report people/bots without cancelling the action you’re currently doing. I don’t want to report bots while fishing because it cancels the fishing.

On the 2nd rotation there is a possible extra mage phase in like 2 of the patterns. The wiki picture labels it as (optional) I think

Yeah I couldn't figure out a way to remove a specific device after searching online &amp; my OSRS account page so I just removed the authenticator and re-added it.

Medium diary seems to be a bit better than hard diary requirement. I don't know how much of in favor I would be of the cost to enter and kicked out when hopping worlds/ logging out. The getting kicked out may be exploited depending on where it kicked you to for example. If it kicked you to south entrance people would simply camp deeper in the cave and relog when banking or running from clan to get below 30 wildy. If it is to the north entrance it may just become an area that is camped by pkers in the hopes of killing those who are trying to bank.
---
Take my opinion with a grain of salt though. I don't go into rev caves because I just get frustrated with having to leave every minute or so because pkers show up.

I don’t think people realize how much inflation would happen if all bots and rwts instantly disappeared. So many materials and items come into the game because of bottling. And most of those materials are used by actual players. Now I don’t enjoy seeing a billion bots running around, but they’re a built in part of the economy at this point.

That's assuming you don't world hop. World hopping would increase to ~200mil XP/hr because you'd hit the limit in about 45 minutes

I've been considering barrows myself at 75 magic (have a trident), 70 Def and 44 prayer, but with minimal prayer and no morytania hard diary is it really more worthwhile than slayer? (My slayer is mid-60's can't remember exactly)

Yeah, and at that point, might as well just make a new account. I guess it's only useful if you want to keep your name or membership.

The other guy did redwoods, I did magics. It’s generally for the same purpose though. Either pet hunting or afk money while you’re doing something else—it’s not great gp/h but has minimal setup time/cost, making it easy for an alt goal.

Careful, you ran into a few snags the first time you tried to relocate them Adolf.
---
If you care about building up your main to access as much content as possible, you should quest untill barrows gloves atleast [175 qp]. It wont boost your combat up by much as the exp rewards are more noticable at a lower level but should put your melees mid 50's i would assume. Once you have your barrows gloves, you are free to farm xp and i would reccommed questing little by little as you get stronger to unlock more areas and weapons and shit. Good luck.

I'd love if they made a boss that was for duo's. Maybe can even enter the instance without a partner, and if the partner doesn't contribute and just stands still, make the loot worth drop lower.

I would imagine it would be possible to leave spears categorized as spears and make hastae categorized as such.

Happened to me with diablo 2 back when I was a kid.

That fucking blizzard intro was always loud. My dad set up a trap for me by setting the speakers on max volume because he knew I was gonna pull that shit.
---
I hid so horribly under the desk as he walked out from his room to the computer. He was so unimpressed with my hiding spot he just sent me to bed and we never discussed it lol.

Make one, it’s fun and there’s more to it than you’d think. Basically, there are a ton of pure clans that let you hop in for a night, it’s a really social way of playing the game. It’s a restricted game mode, which is fun in itself and gives you crazy dopamine for not-so-big  achievements(getting that 60 combat lvl firecape makes you feel like a god). It’s a good way to learn PvP as you can get away with risking very little(40-100k doing ranged to maul, and 200k from basic setup tribridding). Also, they’re accounts which can be enjoyed and can be lucrative every step of the way, which is much more rewarding for casual players than doing a main.
---
Just put all the poll booths in the fucking wilderness.
---
Yeah I just found out that was a thing, it also works on rs3. Almost thought mobile would be unplayable.
---
Because it’s enjoyable.
---
I love this one purely because of the mental image it creates.
---
No, nor does it need one. It only needs some variety.
---
Any ideas what's up with DWH? I figured with the new content coming up that it would rise, but it's crashing like mad. Just a merch clan or am I missing something obvious that has impacted it?
---
Neat! Your above comment doesn't tag me, so thanks for the info!
---
that's the end of the sentence for me
---
Horny
---
noob farm question, do i still need to use compost on the patches if i'm paying the NPC to watch it?
---
Maybe Im missing something, but how the fuck are they banking so fast? They have to get Logs/Food, deposit gold, withdraw ore. but it's done instantly.
---
Could I just make 2 iron men accounts and group them with a shared bank, then I could always have 1 do resource gathering?
---
it do

While I certainly don't support rwt, I understand why it exists and why it will always exist
---
Some people have expendable money in real life and not a lot of spare time to play rs. They use their irl money to quickly access content in game that they would otherwise not be able to access for like 100+ hrs of in-game time, which might take them half a year to get to
---
I'd guess that, if playing an average amount (1-3 hrs per day??), it would takes years to be able to afford some of the 1b+ items
---
Some people just don't have the patience :(
---
G
---
Lmao delete ur comment then
---
50 absorption? You can absorb 1k damage before having to repot lol that lasts me about 2 hours at a time and considering you get like 3 prayer bonus IF that how is it even worth using prayer pots?
---
Keep getting angry at random stranger on the internet though x
---
so.... you cna trade with up to 400 accounts (friendlist limit) what would be the point of that lmfao
---
Well yeah, it's all up to you. If you do lots of clue scrolls the teleport could be handy.
---
And it also takes forever, at that point just get 77 and camp bbds
---
"There's always a bigger fish"
---
sad
---
nah far from, in 3+ years of twitch he hasn't even got 1k followers on twitch, meaning he's pretty shit.
---
he still doesnt know jack shit... constantly complaining about bunch of bullshit and has no clue about anything
---
Well technically people have shown that you can do it whenever with shit gear. But realistically if you’re going for acb cape I would prioritize a kodai, sgs, occult+anguish, and pegs. A friend of mine used this stuff with karils and ahrims for armor with a crystal shield and ring of suffering.
---
No one buys gold -&gt; no one can sell gold -&gt; no one has incentive to hack others and bot en mass.
---
You have brain cells, you could have figured out the line of thought if you used them harder.
---
theres no way
---
Nice.
---
just discovered these last night. playing around with these is some of the most fun i've had in 14 years of playing rs
---
making them dance would be awesome
---
Fremennik Elite requires GWD kills and 82 (77) Runecrafting. I think those are high enough bars for it to not really devalue Crafting cape too much.
---
More likely if enough people complain they will move the teleport slightly further back in Neitiznot though. =p
---
Y fletch?
---
Will Dr. Jekyll accept a noted herb or do I have to have it unnoted?

This is me😂
---
Brutals will not be very good without dhcb or tbow. Gargoyles will definitely be your best option
---
What does proc mean? I see it everywhere.
---
And you're why they kill those of us doing clues
---
1m kill is nothing when its split between 5 and you can just tele out instantly anyway
---
Yeah I just realized that you technically couldn't leave tutorial island. You can do the two elemental workshops though, which is what I love about those quests-- still 50-50 on whether killing things is social interaction.
---
But he's also talking in terms of combating the scouts. It's insane that the pkers can have scouts hop every world without a hint of risk or cost.
---
This is the only game I've ever played that has this problem, Jagex has been running an mmo for like 20 years now? And they can't do something about a static player using macros to type something against the rules?
---
This isn't some pyrrhic campaign Jagex is losing they're just actively not doing anything about it at this point. Like it's 2019 the first thing I see when I log in shouldn't be 20+ advertisements for gold selling or fire capes.
---
enjoy the game how you want mate, I was just trying to inform someone of absorption mechanics but you seem to have a system that works for you, GL to you

I loved watching r/freefolk on TV. It had a great 5 seasons

I went here once... Asked for a partner and had 3 people try to sell me help instantly. Waited around about 30 mins, and just left. Found help in my own clan from someone who already completed it.
---
Lol what? No they dont? If you spend a lot of time in the wilderness like I do youd know that there absolutely isnt "a ton" of people doing wildy slayer. And the reason for that is because regular slayer is FAR better XP and money with no risk as well and the ability to slay in max gear. Youre honestly trying to tell me the majority of people who do it dont just do it when they need to farm points? Which isnt very often. 
---
People dont do it often partly because its in the wilderness and partly because theres no real incentive to do it over regular slayer except for points boosting.
---
Ahh, I see. That makes sense. Iirc, Theoatrix on YouTube somewhat does it. Mostly was about efficiency but he shows some cheaper ways or ways to profit occasionally. Something along those lines.
---
Whilst I do respect your viewpoint, I personally prefer slower progression. Yes, nostalgia has a lot to do with it for me - having teleports everywhere makes the game feel less like an adventure. I love walking around the game and feeling like the world means something. Because it’s meant so much to me for so many years. I don’t want a lot of the updates that are put in the game and I have no inclination to visit places like Zeah. I understand that I am a VERY small minority of the player base. But I thank myself every day that I was given the opportunity to play a game that is THIS close to the one that I fell in love with as a kid.
---
It is a slower teleport.
---
Alrighty tysm &lt;3
---
couple more hunter levels and you can do red chins

What was your total bloods collected? I'm up to 320k and only 98 rc.

45000 dBSPL is about 10^2244 Pa. That's 10^2244 N acting upon 1m^2. For reference, the average punch has a force of around 1000 N. That much sound pressure exerts 10^2241 times more force than the average punch.
---
This guy does nothing but repost. He has like 50 reposts just today. Look at his profile.
---
coolest pet tbh

You mean 77 RC and then spending 3 hours trying to get the +5 rc boost :)

To be fair, who ever goes to the cooking guild?

have you checked the wiki guide
---
literally google/YouTube
---
the clothes fit in so nicely
---
Maybe it would help if you stopped spamming these posts
---
N
---
No its not lol? Watch, there will be virtually no pkers who actually pk there because Zammy wines arent expensive at all and there is the spawn in 1 wildy which means there really wont be many people even using the spawn anyway. Why would pkers go there when you could go to 44s, Chins, Altar, Callisto etc. which are MUCH more profitable areas where there is much more traffic?
---
How can you honestly claim that when theres really no reason for people to go to a deep wildy zammy wine spawn? Its going to literally be mostly bots there if theres any traffic there at all. Ironmen can go to the 1 wildy spawn if they really need wines and they dont generally need them too often beacuse they dont train herblore with ranging pots because its very inefficient. 
---
Its not like it will be a good money maker anyway either since Zammy wines arent expensive at all and getting there/banking will be a lengthy process, not to mention the spawn in 1 wildy being much quicker and much safer. Itd probably be like 300k-400k/hr max. 
---
So no...its not a new potential spot at all.
---
Demonic thrones is max efficiency like that post implied, just that it would be hard to explain where the gp would come from. Max efficiency merching, rwting or getting infinite stack from sand casino are possible methods, but here EHP instead takes lower feasible money methods into account, making it non-max efficiency listed.

Should I always weild magic secauters to harvest herbs?  Also I don't understand which flowers protect which plants.  Will any flower protect all types of other plants or is there some rule?

So when bots bypass filter, what is Jagex going to do? Continue filtering while bots continue bypassing it with variations of letters?
---
It seems like most games tend to get worse as they get older but OSRS seems to be at least just as good if not better than when it started IMO. It seems the only people that complain about it’s current state are the ones going for 200m in all skills autistic kids complaining about skill devaluation lmao
---
Could have been double Magic seeds
---
do you chin the cows haha
---
Fremmy elite is probably the easiest elite to get tho. Maybe Lumby, but one of those two.
---
It’s not max efficiency at all. Max efficiency is weighing time for xp vs time to get money. The time to make 20b would be way longer than the time saved by doing the thrones which is why the mahogany tables are the EHP for con.
---
I think you seriously underestimate the amount of resources coming into the game as a direct result of RWT. Just look at the price spikes when Venezuela has the power outage. And that’s only from a portion of farmers. 
---
There would definitely be more people skilling, but at the end of the day there’s absolutely no way it closes the resource gap from eliminating rwt.
---
I'm using Macbook Air 2018, everything works fine, using 2 account at once. The touchpad is soo good compared to Windows that I never use mouse to play, it's crazy
---
Why are you replying on a dead post, weird ass
---
Ye bro
---
Oi! I don't know you!
---
Yup, a lot of it is so pures don't accidentally get def xp by switching to a weapon that uses controlled or something.
---
Bro sharks were 1k each tho
---
Once I saw that guy had the rainbow next to his name on twitter I knew he was a prick.

Diamond e, though you could also try Ruby e switch for the first half or so
---
Currently its Horned Graahks. 1/4 the way to 99 hunter rn
---
New skill: Swarding
---
You think its runelite or has to do with the new update for the weapon types?
---
Neat.
---
There's already a few easy teles straight to the GE, cooking guild is more like a Barb village tele.
---
recent qol update, been this way for some months
---
Runelite

But you criticized the content not his personality.
---
I got full prospector from lower level, then I finished my diary.
---
  
---
After completing the diary I sold it back and bought gem bag and coal bag.
---
Please link any official give a shit posts where that would matter. 
---
I'm sure there's numerous times when jmods have said 2007scape, or the fact they all post as official jmods on r/2007scape, but that literally does not matter in the slightest. Every single person who plays the game knows 2007scape == OSRS == Oldschool Runescape.
---
Why the fuck you and the other people who've responded to this feel the need to **sooooo fucking pedantic** about this confuses the shit out of me. 
---
**THAT IS NOT THE POINT OF THE COMMENT**
---
---------------------------------------------------
---
I think that's why he said it
---
No I didn’t because I’m not a fucking idiot... I waited by the fence for a member to open it so I could walk through at the same time.
---
Yeah sorry about the quality doing on my phone and not much of a meme maker. Just two things I love so when I saw the train starting I had to hop in lol
---
Free karma: title hankou hill hill, picture of this thing like 20 times on a hill.
---
ur an actual loser
---
Saw someone say monkfish which is pretty good. 
---
Cannonballs are also decent, cutting magic trees is OK
---
You could also do cooking at the Hosidius range if you have the favor for it.
---
Superpoison black spear... because... why?
---
Wildy bosses are supposed to be not soloed, doing them solo is much slower, especially at Vetion
---
this gus has noobed before.
---
Probably doesn’t have 70 range def and prayer which id recommend when you’re brand new at least
---
dude if someone calls you a nazi it’s absolutely not because you’re “doing something right” lmfao
---
Yeah it’s pretty obvious, that’s why I wanted to point out their bias, but it seems userleansbot doesn’t want to work here.
---
I responded to a question which asked is he entertaining?
---
I thought tureal was more to grind point especially with konar and kourend elite?
---
With no contact and all the teles in ur  invy it's some pretty insane points per hour
---
Imagine how satisfying it would be if you could just barrage them all in one hit. Or like a satanic circle of chin chompas and just launch them at them.
---
Should've called a tab.
---
This is unbelievable. The internet is amazing
---
I mean jagex know and approve of wmk; I'm sure they've thought about these use cases.
---
Hard clue takes you to the head chef
---
Thank you!
---
I been grinding slay points at tureal/konar and had to start going to lummy and just standing on the other side of the fence
---
An FYI to a fellow tureal grinder, the undesd chicken near Port phas count as zombies(so do the cows)
---
Inb4 they move it and nothing really changes. It was popular because no free trade and safe Wilderness.
---
Also no xp or worthwhile rewards from it whatsoever.
---
noob
---
Whaaaaaat. Ezscape reeeeeeee
---
Get farming up and do whatever herbs make the most money
---
To add: Tanning cowhide into soft leather costs 1gp per hide. Cheap and you’ll make that money back when you sell the items to the general store.
---
Congrats man
---
Yeah I definitely need money lol, like I said my cash stack is only like 200k. I really need to get to the point of being self sufficient so I no longer have to shell out $11 a month too.
---
At runefest
---
You can get 80 for one tenth the amount you spent on prayer lol
---
Pvm bringing more raw materials into the game than skilling isn’t an assumption, that’s the state of the game. That’s not related to botting at all. If the price of those materials goes up pvm gp/h increase along with skilling. 
---
Yeah, I am assuming that botting and rwt brings in the majority of materials and that the player base won’t be able to cover that gap. But I’m pretty confident in that assumption. Go look at the sales of dragon bones during the Venezuela blackout. It was like 20% what it normally was. I don’t expect regular players to cover that much ground for every item that’s farmed for gold.
---
Spirit tree to farming guild is faster
---
Lol that’s hilarious, I was probably afk or had chat off. Not trying to be rude haha
---
RIP ur life bruh.
---
Trade baby for tbow
---
Yeah those are good for sure
---
I’m just trying to stay neutral is all. I understand both sides. My point to OP was that the reason people don’t “buy bonds instead” is because of the pricing difference. Someone below said that it’s not that crazy, and it’s not even double the price. 
---
But, if you were to buy 10 bonds at 70$ USD, that would get you what, 40m? Compared to gold buyers who could get 70-75m for the same price. It’s subjective, but 70$ is a lot of money to some people. And 30m is also a lot to some people.
---
Edit: I don’t condone gold buying. I know it’s harmful for the game. But again, I understand both sides.
---
Ok
---
Oh hell yeah. What a silly way of obtaining them:
---
&gt; To obtain a black spear, a player can buy one from another player, receive it as a gift from turning [vampyre Juvinates](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Vampyre_Juvinate) into [humans](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Human), or from looting a chest in the [Shade Catacombs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Shade_Catacombs) while participating in the [Shades of Mort'ton](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Shades_of_Mort%27ton_(minigame)) [minigame](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Minigame). 
---
My only concern is that it's tradeable, so someone might collect them. But still pretty awesome.
---
I'd argue kourend is easiest
---
Its literally a two handed spear
---
But that's 80, not 99. Doesn't get you a cape.
---
Not alching the pet, that’d be a waste of good rng. Alching myself, because I’m a waste of oxygen.
---
“Alch yourself” is the Runescape nerd way of saying “go fuck yourself”
---
its inefficient to pick up glass now with sand being so easy to get when doing 3 seaweed:18 sand
---
Some people playing this game were never taught the difference between "can" and "should"
---
yeah remembering each weapon type's style was an update a few months ago, they were briefly restoring people's accidental xp from it but i think they've stopped doing that now. i don't think it would have been set to defensive by this though, from what i remember it automatically set everything to the first option which would have been attack
---
If little timmy is dumb enough to put "iron" or "fe" in their username they will be slapped with the quickness
---
Look up the slayermuic1 guide, visuals always help me, also the is a sticky thread for general questions
---
When I played heavily I played trouble brewing games for the reward 'The stuff'. I did that because I brewed chefs delight. I have over 60 barrels combined of regular and mature. Never plan to sell it, but I like having it. Wish I could place it in my poh kitchen.
---
Either would be fine I think. Glad you are interested :)
---
Using abyssal dagger to train strength. Should I go back to whip for attack and defense, or does dagger train all styles well?
---
As I said, I completely understand that, it's just weird how everyone seems to be "reading the same script"
---
You missed a few more things. Empty pizza boxes, clothes everywhere, an unmade bed, smelly odour trails
---
Ive always been bothered by the lack of lore behind 3 Jurassic bosses all labeled as kings.  Something like cave kraken, and cerberus are not nearly as loaded with information.  Kalphite queen is a "queen" because its in an insect hive, but little is known about dagannoths.  I mean why would 3 'kings' work together?  In my opinion there should be a boss lore wise that keeps them from going out of line and in-fighting.
---
Grats
---
Absolute madness. I've messaged you my rsn. I play some os but not played in a while. Might jump on bro.
---
Reddit gods, I thank you.

I was only about 400xp away from level im afraid, so only took a couple of hits. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/x42fBmd)

this is why i never went without protection until after marriage, and even then it didn't happen until we could financially afford the fuck up.  Gl my fellow rs brother.

Petition to make crafting cape tele put u inside the bank with interface already open tbh
---
Okay but he literally is an antisemite who denies the Holocaust. I'm not sure what more you need from him.
---
Yeah i do actually. but im also a big bonehurtingjuice guy so i get if its not everyones cup of tea
---
This is more a fault of a third party client than Jagex’s. Looks like you’ve got a new account build.
---
Twice today man nice
---
I was confused because I thought I saw this image or style before. But I took a few minutes to research and you're goldmoney AND piro (rip accs); love your art
---
The version I remembered was the in-progress version btw
---
Do you have a deviantart or a gallery?
---
I love the ticker and the pee bottles!
---
What do you mean giant red word lmao? It was set to defensive due to a bug, and I didn't notice for a few hits...
---
"HI I PLAYED BACK IN 2007 THIS GAME WILL LITERALLY BE UNRECOGNIZABLE IF THIS UPDATE COMES OUT. EZ SCAPRE REEEEEEEE" 
---
I hope this makes it on to the polls and passes
---
Missed opportunity
---
what the fuck I thought you were faking it??? this is fucking insanse
---
not sure how its the clients fault?
---
False. They can do everything but teleport.
---
Gg sit kid
---
At least go for 82 so you can do magic imbue for doing lava runecrafting
---
Fathers day is coming up too!
---
Two more polls boys
---
I mean not sure how its set to defensive in that case as again I use the hide defence/attack option on runelite
---
103
---
close but still not quite there
---
I used to play this game on a 2003 heap of shit with a quarter of the power of that Lenovo. 
---
Yes. It will run.
---
It's about the quantity here, not whether it'll actually exist or not.
---
It's as simple as supply and demand. If the demand for gold dropped, the supply (aka botting, hacking, phishing, scamming) would go down as well. There'd still be people doing these things for personal account progression gains, but significantly less than if there was actual irl monetary incentive.
---
If you want to skip the first 30 levels you can do a quest or two I think. Not much of a trick after that, just get tasks from the best slayer master for your level. You could point boost to get a slayer helm fast if you like. But more or less just kill stuff and more than half of tasks drop profitable things. If you want some more in depth methods I have a osrs discord and cc where you can ask anything. Small community, mostly casual.
---
great point, disappointed he left those unfilled...
---
people see jagex fuck up a lot so they assume their own fuckups are jagexs fault when it usually isn’t
---
okay we can agree to disagree.
---
also i just noticed you implied that throwing out mountain dew and playing rs3 are immoral things so im pretty sure ur just meming me at this point.
---
Really? Thats pretty cray i would think thats more or less 10 jets combined i guess db is calculated differently?
---
Its over annakin, i have higher ground
---
Very cool
---
So their further solution is to do nothing?
---
(D)
---
I had the staff and do one or two ankous tasks in sos and never had problems with running out of teles there for clues and whatnot
---
Lol. Its an Always Sunny in Philadelphia reference. :P
---
I've heard that the Arceuus library is still a decent enough method of getting runecrafting experience for ironmen/ultimate ironmen, even with the nerf to banking books. Do people still use it? What is the xp/hr like?
---
Found the gold buyer trying to justify their actions.
---
Moments like this suck. I wonder why companies like Blizz can easily restore an account but jagex wont...🦀some thing some thing 11 bucks🦀
---
Pretty much only time I'll pk rc runners is if I see one with dpick or eternal glory.
---
Only dagger you would ever use for a main weapon would be abyssal dagger for strength training. Otherwise you will always use d scimmy, sara sword or a whip for 95% of your gameplay. Just use spec weapons to drain spec
---
They probably just bot the singles area now. Was over a year ago I got mine
---
What are the fucking chances
---
more pls
---
you can help with heroes after completion but not with arrav
---
Why do they hide this behind content straight off tutorial island? If you come back after a long time of not playing how would you ever figure this out?
---
I don’t buy gold, don’t need to, day one osrs player my bank has been built over the years and I don’t go arena. But If I did buy gold, I wouldn’t do it thru bonds lmfao doesent even make sense. Dumb fuck

I HIGHLY recommend looking at the quick guide rather than the full guide, since it explicitly tells you exactly what actions you need to do without the unnecessary fluff and story in the normal guide. In the wiki it tells you to: "cook a raw karambwan on a fire" -&gt; "choose poison karambwan" -&gt; "use your pestle and mortar on the poison karambwan". There is no guess work involved, the wiki gives you every single step required in the quest.
---
The staff holds a max of 12 charges if you're at varrock elite done, and nobody does SoS unless they're doing konar. 
---
Dead. Content.
---
Ah okay sorry. As someone else mentiones id deffo have at least 85 range and 70 defence before doing DS2 but.. If you check out the optimal quest guide on the wiki that should give you a good idea of which point to do each quest :)
---
It definetly wasnt a dumb assumption, but sure. I dont know you, thats true but anyone would get the same idea as me from your comments.
---
Also these arguments are completely pointless since you clearly dont want to even consider my thoughts. And it seems you've gave up with counter arguments by insulting me. Welp some are lost hope
---
Blue drags with 70 agility. Slayer/clues. You can crossbow metal drags too, very afk
---
Play some rust
---
Go do some barrows, your stats are fine for it and you need money real bad.
---
Dont be afraid to keep some of the armor you get, like ahrims top/bottom, guthans set.
---
As for goals, maybe 10m bank, and 70s in all combat stats. (Including prayer.)
---
definitely not worth losing an inventory spot for that lol
---
yeah I'm not sure who is worse. They could never update this game again and I wouldn't complain, also wouldn't care if they keep updating it
---
This has also happened to me, usually it seems to happen more when zulrah is at low hp for a long time rather than just randomize after every rotation, sometimes the 2nd rotation is recognizable and sometimes it does randomize a bit.
---
I don’t have that problem anymore after I got gud though
---
&gt;Meme starts with a slayer denying questing and ends with approving slayer
---
So you did get the joke, then.
---
Assemblers do
---
The maps, the game play, everything is exactly the same. It even has a teleport! Yet nobody gives a shit about CW... before moving a safe minigame to a dangerous part of the map, how about adding a clan wars world. Prove to Jagex that people will actually play clan wars. But if, even with the new world, it’s empty, then fuck moving clan wars to the wildy, it would be a waste at this point and would bring nothing to the game.
---
Pushing what topic? That sometimes people want to change their genders? They exist.
---
Gotta have full penance to flex on torso grinders
---
He’s put his essence into so many alter crevices though
---
"IF" anything. Damn, can you even read?
---
I'll take my down votes, but you sir are ignorant as fuck. You can add meaning to anything if you think hard enough on it.
---
The first image  doesn't represent jews owning everything... That's some skewed interpretation you've applied to it. You approached the image with "this man is a fucking nazi" running through your mind and came to what seemed to you like a reasonable conclusion. In actuality it's just a rich man who happens to be Jewish.  That could even be a "Jewish people are greedy" meme... Which was incredibly popular when cyanide and happiness comics reached their peak attention. The art style and randomness seem inspired by the aforementioned comics which is why I bring them up.. Shit it may have even been made back then, who knows. 
---
The second image... Nobody denies the Holocaust happened and is clearly a joke L
---
3rd image- definitely mocks socialism the character is clearly shedding tears while the character's girl is getting mouth banged. 
---
Think before you speak God damn.
---
By no means do I support the nazis or any similar movement, but I will not stand for ignorant fucks throwing around random accusations.
---
I really should have put a /s after my comment lol
---
Thanks :) I’m at 79 def and 73 range so got some range training to do i suppose. Back to lighthouse lol :(
---
it's really obscure items from quests and such, that people just never hold onto. Mod Mat K did a data stream once on the rarest items, think one of them was a pink goblin mail
---
doesnt make it less true
---
time for a divorce
---
hold down ctrl when you click and you will run to that location, even if you have run turned off. Great for bossing
---
Sometimes a runner is a bad boy and takes off but usually works every time
---
*all bots change to female model*
---
Yes that would be the topic that would be pushed. I know they exist and thats great for them but this game doesn’t need to cover gender dysphoria which is what i said earlier. It’s a medieval fantasy game. Not the game of life.
---
Edit: mid-evil &gt; medieval
---
I leave the long episodes on for my dog to listen to all the time while I'm away.
---
I really do think a duo only boss would be good. It's the restrictions that seem weird to me. People might think "Why do I need a partner, I could do this solo". I guess the best way would be to enforce this using game mechanics.  Interactive stuff like both players having to activate something related to the boss at the same time. One player has to do something which gives the other player a chance to attack or something, etc. Like a more complicated boss that requires 2 people in a way that makes sense
---
No I don't resell I use them for membership, I usually high alch or do yanillian hop runs for cash
---
Not at all. Low level gmaulers would just have to risk more if they're looking to continue to bully their combat bracket.
---
Sell ur rsgp to pay for the abortion
---
Lol. But you can change your gender already. And there are NPCs who mention it. But a quest is too much. 🤔 It doesn't even have to be preachy. Just use the existing lore.
---
If you want a new third who enjoys DKS and always splits, feel free to message me your RSN.
---
The clan I'm in does bossing in general and we're always up for making new friends!
---
That being said, F2 is a dumb cunt and really has shown his true colors.
---
you should step outside for a bit mate.
---
Nope, it's fishing actually. She's primarily a Fishing/Woodcutting alt. She only has 86 fletching , see my other post where I asked if hunter potions were bugged. Turns out it was just a dev choice.  I'm trying to get her combat up so she can help with multi-combat bosses.
---
Sounds like he's about to start telling me about QPUs and building up speed
---
Something existing is not an argument for it to be in the game
---
How do you phone people
---
Rune dragons are probably the most gp one can make per hour afk. Just get your stats up a small bit.
---
That leaks and slides like a snail.
---
Hank Hill was my GF?!
---
This is genius
---
I don't think it's illogical to have skill cape teleports. I think it's silly that they aren't consistent in allowing a teleport across the board. They should just have every skill cape have a free teleport to the skill master at the very least. Some of the skill capes' perks, like fletching for example, are useless as hell.
---
Again, character customization and pushing people to accept those with gender dysphoria isn’t the same thing. This is a video game not a social justice platform. If you want to push for acceptance get out there and do it and good in you if you do it. That said, topics like that do not belong in a video game. Now sure how much i can reiterate before you actually read it.
---
Every thread has a war over the stupidest shit and I love it

Seems like especially after the Lyre update today that the staff could be updated to have a high cost unlimited teleport upgrade ala Camulet and the Lyre.

dwhs always gunna go down long term, it's dropped from mid tier easy to farm npcs.

also people are becoming more aware that the bgs is superior for team raids/tob in a lot of cases compared to just all dwh teams.
---
Fair point
---
What episode?
---
Omg Tren you say exactly what im thinking. Thank you for advocating for pvp.
---
Even better. Run up with a bulwark and spec the fuck outta them. Only works in multi though.
---
diamonds are better. use dhide.
---
Still is ;)
---
I spent about 3.5m learning Zulrah with combat base 85s and 300m of gear.
---
There is a lot more to it than "learn strat, kill boss, get 1-3m per hour."
---
Well that's because people aren't saying that in support of something being added
---
Lmao good catch I’ll fix it
---
No need to apologize bromigo!
---
Maybe if you se an imbued god cape on a magic cape it loses its stats and ability to swap spell books and replaces it with the imbued god cape stats but with the same look as the magic cape?
---
But it would be great if they had fun pets like that, maybe even rarer like 1/1 bil. But having that would be the ultimate flex. (And not in the collection log - would make it too unreal grind)
---
Not at all brother. Your points are all valid. These are the answers I'm looking for when posing discussion threads. Thank you for your contribution.
---
Re: the "fuck this random guy" it's actually just a difference in mentality. Pkers will always murk you in the wildy given the chance. The reason being: even though you may look broke and naked, some players go naked or go "false 3-iteming" when they're actually carrying bank. It's a similar mindset to doing pvm for rare drops. I understand your frustrations though. A lot of your points seem to be general consensus from what I'm seeing in this thread.
---
All games look different if you look at the state they were in 5 years ago then compare to how they are present day. This is what happens when games develop and evolve, which is a requirement for games to survive and grow. OSRS is no exception, and should not be an exception.
---
https://youtu.be/tg2PD-dwsIw

One of the best episodes imo
---
Did your members try auto renew and was declined?
---
How weird, I just watched that and sent it to my friend a few mins ago, now in seeing it here again
---
For someone who claims to have quit OSRS he sure does talk about it a lot. 
---
Imagine, the guy who got 200m mining has nothing better to do. I’m shocked.
---
Looks awesome dude! Please make more
---
Imagine gold ore at blast furnace.
---
Sure you'd need protection and people to actually operate the furnace. But.. 1.3mxp/hr?
---
Amirite. Smh.
---
r/banktabs is a great source of nice looking bank setups
---
This is kind of the reason why Jagex isn't polling the removal of imbues from NMZ. They know most of the player base isn't likely to vote for an update that inconveniences them.
---
Tbh the OSRS twitter people aren't any better lol.
---
Lol who honestly gives a single fuck if it looks different? If you can't handle that tiny change you have much bigger issues.
---
why cant we get multiple trawler games in the same world like pest control?
---
i am so proud of this community
---
You eat the steel cannonball jawbreaker and your teeth broke. -10 HP. But it is somewhat oddly good.
---
I wonder how many people Eddy would scam out of their gold to buy cannonballs. lol Then Eddy would get PK'd by Kevin.
---
Gz m8. Tbh, seeing you get a pet so close to 99 makes me happy—you earned it. All these RNG Lords getting pets at lvl 23 in their respective skill hurts me inside.
---
I’ve got 65m total exp and still no pets.. I know many ppl are far beyond me even with total
---
exp with no pets
---
You wont need any accuracy for cannon since monsters we train on has 0 defence
---
There's probably someone somewhere who gives a shit.
---
Check out r/BankTabs

Whats better for barrows at 64 magic, iban or slayer dart? (dps and cost)

🦀WE WANT PETITE RS GIRLS🦀

If there's a risk there should be a reward.  Chance to pet the dog and the dog becomes your pet.
---
If they were able to completely eradicate bots tomorrow raw materials prices would skyrocket and the game would die. It's all a balance man, people are always gonna find a way to farm gold.

Also, meh

maybe alts wouldnt be a thing if jagex didnt make a fucking afk option on literally everything in this game to cater to shitter casuals who cant pay attention for more than 15 seconds.
---
"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command." - you rn
---
I've heard about that here and there but don't know much.
---
I'm guessing players want to move them to some slayer reward or diary because NMZ's so mind-numbingly boring.
---
The mod response only to Reddit/twitter has always been a bit of a meme to me. I came back after a 4 year break to osrs about 6 months ago. My account had been Permabanned for macroing during a time when I did NOT play.  
---
I submitted a ban appeal and my account was unbanned within a week and I got an email explaining that they could tell that activity during the ban didn’t match activity back when I was actively playing.  
---
So anecdotally I always feel like the “Jagex doesn’t respond to me, ban = unfair” crowd is lying and just hoping for a Hail Mary to get their accounts back.  We see the smack down time and time again.    
---
Maybe the reason ban appeals through Jagex doesn’t work (to the social media masses) is because those same people making the posts were meant to be banned.
---
so are we just supposed to ignore that chat?
---
Making an already grindy game unneccessarily grindier (imagine chopping yews with a bronze axe, good god) probably hurts new player retention a bit, which in turn impacts f2p-&gt;p2p conversions, which hurts OSRS as a whole since it eats into its profitability. More money to Jagex means that they can afford to put more effort into it and, say, pay people to rework Kourend.
---
Probably because 70% of their viewers clicked accidentally. Or like, they name their video "This is the best way to do X" and then babble on for 14 minutes about the shit they've done the last couple days.
---
Jesus Christ I hate RS content creators on Youtube. Except maybe Framed... And that one guy who does quest guides, that guy's a hero. But at least with those two you know what you're in for.
---
As an Ironman, I gladly hand this guy over to RS3.
---
I mean it's pretty much true. Have you seen some of these suggestions?
---
&gt;They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
I love this, gonna play some rs and watch ed edd n eddy now. Thanks for the indirect recommendation on what to watch
---
Jesus that sounds extremely slow
---
I feel that bro, my first time I died because I was shaking so hard I got fucking tunnel vision lol. I just completely spazzed out and died, such an adrenaline rush. I got him on my second try luckily since I drank a beer beforehand hahah. 
---
You did good man, that’s actually what you’re supposed to do! If it works it works!
---
I think people started "spite-voting" no on all pvp updates due to updates that forced pvmers and skillers into the wilderness, and/or locked some of the best xp/money methods of the game in clan-only multizones (like revenants).
---
Nobody likes being forced into pvp for non-pvp content, just to get raped 50v1 by some clan yelling racist slurs at you.
---
If pvp updates had kept focusing on actual pvp content rather than "pkers farming the rest" content, we probably woudn't be in this situation.
---
If for some reason they ran out of room in the game, and couldn't add more land, the wilderness would absolutely be my first vote to scrap it all and repurpose.
---
It's a lot of dead space, with intermittent PVM and skilling content, and the occasional guy in cabbage robes.
---
You might be able to talk me into leaving ~50 squares around edgeville.
---
So that's why all the bots survived..
---
Are u on resizable?
---
It's dead content. There aren't plenty of uses for it.
---
Thank you fella, I'll check them out!
---
Keep in mind that these are my opinions alone, and while PKer memes are funny, I have no problem with the wilderness or people who choose to PVP or PK. 
---
I think the biggest thing for me is that I don’t view or play it as a PVP game. A large part of that for me is the rng based combat system. Sure, an argument can be said for knowing when to eat, switches, and prayer management, but at the end of the day to me it’s just a roll of dice between players on who ultimately has the better spec, surprise, or whoever is risking an insane amount of money. When I compare it to games I love with heavy PVP elements like League or Dark Souls, it just doesn’t compare to me in the same capacity. 
---
Another part is I’d effectively be taking a gamble, whereas if I did any other activity I’d be gaining experience, guaranteed money, and a chance at rare items like pets. There’s very little reason for me to take the time and effort to become accomplished at it when there are things like Raids and Bosses who offer more interesting mechanics and oftentimes better money, or general skilling to further my account. 
---
Lastly, I’ve been playing since 2005 and I’ve seen how good and fun PVP can be at its peak. When games like Castle Wars, Clan Wars, Soul Wars, and Stealing Creation were in their prime, I’d spend hundreds and hundreds of hours there. Some of my favorite memories of this game were during the times you could have two 100 player noob armies face off against one another, and you’d cheer on your team comprised of total strangers from the sidelines when you fell. In that way, that spirit and camaraderie is unfortunately no longer part of this game, and PVP the way I love and remember it has no place here anymore. I’d love for it to be, but the game as a whole has changed and drifted away from that. 
---
At the end of it all I think PVP has great potential, but when it’s compared to the rest of what this game offers it falls incredibly flat. I’m still open to the idea of it though. If something existed to further incentivize myself and I’m sure many others, be it through revitalizing those long abandoned group PVP arenas, or personally for me making 1 on 1s feel more skillful in some way, then I’d jump at the opportunity.
---
Out of all the updates you could complain about... different coloured hitsplats that are toggleable? Really?
---
That game is over 5 years old now and was floundering in the last half of its first year after hype died. Regular updates saved OS and ultimately jagex.
---
Nobody uses it. Hard news, I know. Keep crying though.
---
Lol that would mean herblore has useful rewards
---
If you prefer slower progression and feeling like everything in the game matters, nothing is stopping you from playing UIM/IM status. 
---
Adding these things only increases accessibility to certain content. Doesn't decrease skill or anything besides the travel time.
---
You misspelled cancer
---
Not a big fan of the hitsplat change either. When I wanted OSRS to come back 6 years ago, I didn't want them to change the mechanics of the game. It's one thing to add new content, but to change mechanics rubs me the wrong way.
---
That would first take Jagex even acknowledging that the actual problem is the mage defense calculation, not slightly nerfing black dhide which will have a really insignificant impact.
---
And lets be real here, we both know there is absolutely no way in hell PvMers would ever let such a thing pass regardless of the fact its broken and breaks the combat triangle. Its absurd that the community of people who PvP the least and some of which just irrationally hate, are the gatekeepers for what gets put into PvP and Jagex seemingly is just going to continue to allow it? Because apparently they think hiding poll results will change that.
---
I'm getting shitty xp rates trying to range nmz. I'm lol 85 using regular void, anguish, archers (i) and using an msb(i) with rune arrows. Super ranged pot and I'm still only getting 16k/hr? That's way too low right?
---
You'd have to drop them youself anyways so your account is safe
---
Nah the old way was far to exploitable. It needs to be somewhere in the middle where people can't abuse the mechanic but still have a punishment
---
I feel that a lot of the points that you brought up stem from the fact that osrs is inherently RNG based.
---
do you think if we were to implement tasteful additions to combat skills in an effort to create additional play styles this would alleviate that?
---
Hahahahahahaha hahawow
---
Yh as the time for the internet going down was too perfect.. its i posted here
---
Hey wanna join my pure only clan
---
He literally confirms it.  "is it possible to hit an enemy but not do damage because you hit so low that it's rounded to 0?"
---
"Yes, that's pretty common . . . you'd proceed to deal damage that's an integer"  You deal damage that's an integer since HP is tracked like that for the player, but I track actual hits.
---
All the data used for summing total damage is pulled directly from the game.  It wouldn't pull a decimal if it wasn't a decimal.
---
So you also suspect DDoS?
---
Man, the ahrims looks better than I expected in the style
---
Obby-Wan Kenobi. LUUUL
---
Everytime I do barb assault people leave after level 1. I miss regular barb assault.
---
I also have an idea for bracketed PVP combat as well as a stat spend type game mode governed by the aforementioned bracketed PVP combat system that could be implemented possibly as a mini game or PVP training area
---
Yeah old name was redpanels, art style and arguments are the nearly identical. And redpanels stopped around the same time stonetoss started. It's pretty obvious he rebranded to become a "crypto fascist" to attract a larger audience.
---
Is this the new thing? like taking pot shots instead of engaging my point.
---
Jesus they already hid the polls, let's not discuss anything else in regard to OSRS content.
---
*puts pistol to head
---
Yeah I was willing to support anything that would revert EoC, I would have preferred 2009-2011 era but 2007 was the only option they gave us haha
---
Looooooool

Iban is much better. It hits 25 while dart will hit 16 at your level

you’re not using the furnace for glass making, just the bank near it. there is a lunar magic spell that makes glass in your inventory and sometimes it makes more glass than you have inventory spaces, which it automatically drops on the ground.

If you go back and watch old yt vids there were always 250+ ppl now it's 46 on a good day, Also if they were to just put this back in wild it would need some invisible barrier or a warning when trying to leave bc ppl would just try to lure n shit.

I do not have those, does an extra tree spawn when you do?

Oh so now we're up to 20 hours instead of 2? Still trivial though, right? It can be done in a single day! Do you really think any random person can go make 10m an hour from BA leeches without a ton of practice in the minigame?
---
Correct, and *sometimes* that even accounts for incorrect use, especially with BC pills or condoms.
---
damn nieve tho
---
If you don't care about the upkeep costs scythe is more useful than tbow (for instance if pet hunting is more important than gp, get scythe). The difference between scythe and the next best thing is usually far far larger than tbow and the next best thing. Generally scythe is more useful where it's good and is useful in as many places as tbow. The only exception to this is if you are camping Cox and not ToB, or if you're attempting inferno.
---
If you're camping the following places, get scythe:
---
* Thermy
---
* KQ
---
* Cerberus
---
* Grotesque guardians
---
* Sire
---
* CoX if you do teams and no one else has a scythe
---
* ToB
---
Tbow for:
---
* Zuk
---
* K'ril 
---
* KBD
---
* Mole 
---
* CoX solos or teams where someone else has a scythe
---
* Hydra
---
* Zilyana 
---
At every other place there are better and cheaper items.
---
No one would use it. Theres already "safe" places to do that like clan wars.
---
What was it?
---
fuck yeah i was really gettin annoyed at the “you’ve been stunned!” at hydra spam gg jamflex
---
That can happen with a few third age items though. When they post pet counts you can do math with the drop rates and get an idea for how many axes/pickaxes/whatever are in the game. It was believed to be around 50 of the ultra rare pieces last time they released pet counts
---
Ask again in 2020.
---
&gt;aw yeah got my max weight bonus gear
---
I wanted to get 99 somewhere other than Zeah. Kinda forgot this game had color.
---
kinda looks like a meat tenderizer
---
edit: yeah unless you’re lookin for a Belgian waffle shield get a regular hammer
---
Scythe is generally better than tbow for bossing if gp isn't your primary goal (pet hunters).
---
Back in the day when I had a bedtime, I would go to bed on time, but wake up at like 2-3am to play again. Several times my parents didn't think I even went to bed.

Sound of the dial-up was loud af.

Tried rev pking the other day with a couple friends, started fighting 1 guy and his clan of 25+ logged in.

Tried pking at wildy altar/chins but was pretty pointless with dinhs.

Castle wars is fun when teams fill but theres no rewards for doing it. Lms is fun but teams never fill. Would love some pvp updates like 1v1 tournaments/ladders with rating based matchmaking. High skill cap + no reason to do it basically.

\-Deadman mode the 'most important pvp event' does not work. Playing deadman mode doesn't benefit your main toon. As somebody with limited time to play it feels like a streamer/clan mode.
---
\-95% of people who approach me and ask to team up want me to hop worlds with them to look for people so they can smite me out as I load in. I don't feel like I can trust anybody which makes it harder to find pvp friends.
---
\-The most important areas of the wilderness that are worth fighting over are locked behind clans patrolling the area. If I go to revs or lava dragons ill be dead in 30 minutes.
---
\-Barrier to entry is extremely high as you need a specialized account to stand a chance. Which means I need to pay for two memberships. I suppose I could my main to pray on lower level players but that doesn't interest me.
---
\-The culture is toxic. Every other time I get killed in wildy I get told 'sit idiot' or something similar.

It feels like the majority of people who know/can PVP don't want the rest of us to learn it. They would rather pray on PVMers for occasional mediocre loot rather than have a fun fight. Personally I find PvP to be fun in safe mini games like castle wars or for fun death matches in the duel arena...Other than that it feels like a frustrating inconvenience.
---
Dude's body aint even... **cold** yet people already puttin out the memes
---
Interesting all of these minigames were released in the wilderness.
---
If you could take out the face cam, just have your voice. I’d watch it. 
---
The awkward sitting reminded me how badly I was sitting and fixed my posture thank you for that 😅
---
Edit: I love watching progress videos, I actually prefer those kinds of videos and would like to watch it.
---
dont worry man, a couple more zammy wine spawns and pvp will fix itself! :)
---
Use rings of dueling to bank and house tabs on w330 to use a fairy ring. There isn't a faster way, this is also what I do for cash.
---
It might be fastest to mine a bunch and bank the essence blocks, then just go between arceuus and a bank to make all the tabs
---
*HYaHaHaHaHa*  
---
*I hit him with 5000 massive whacks, and sent that goblin boi back to lumbridge to spin wool*
---
true and yet still miles better than the hlc echo chamber on twitter
---
IIRC double construction EXP for a set amount of exp/charges. Trade off was that games were rather long, so it really only lowered cost and kept the exp/hr the same.
---
let us use a chisel on the back of helmets to make a t in them
---
2011 called they want their meme back
---
i use to enjoy pvp until it turned into tick manipulation and non stop running when you are losing a fight.  Why waste my food and potions to fight someone who will run the moment they are out?
---
My cummies will know no rest.
---
Same drop rate but not same drop table..
---
This is wholesome, I hope a lot of people show up 😬
---
Christmate atheists.
---
At least you’re having sex
---
Should have gotten the arm IUD Nexplaton.. 
---
.05% chance, *knocks on wood*
---
If I don't have gpu rendering on my fps tanks a bit, even if I'm on desktop.
---
You mean the journal you find AFTER completing ToB?  Obviously everyone has done that raid and everyone read every word of that book. Why even comment if you clearly don't follow the sub rules, it was stated you don't flame on the homepage you find in this subreddit.
---
I want a task inside Nieves Cave.
---
Ok then, last attempt to convince you: an experiment with the plugin.
---
Here's how I think the plugin actually works: if multiple players hit the same NPC on the same tick, for example player1 hits a 3 and player2 hits a 6. Then the client does not know which player caused which splat. Instead, to get a good estimate, each player gets the average (3+6)/2=4.5 added to the damage counter.
---
This is very easy to test. Just hit the same npc on the same tick with 2 accounts. It gives each player the average of the hits instead of the hit they actually did.
---
V nice, that’s the pet I want to get first. It has the best drop rate, I think 1/65?
---
is the ring of dueling really that much faster than the GE?  i've never used one.  looks like might be cheaper than chewing through rings of wealth at least.
---
No but you don't have to use a dramen staff anymore, my man
---
you spelled  ***D U M M Y T H I C C***  wrong.
---
or they could just add the coliseum / arena system that was supposed to be coming with zeah like 3 years ago
---
Same reason they went down the last 10 times. They'll go back up then back down again.
---
Lol varrock.org wtf...
---
How long did 1-75def take, what methods / everything did you do?
---
Switch the mage robes wit ranger set on the two eds. Makes more sense that way.
---
Looks like Toad from Mario got 99 strenght
---
Sorry mate, but yes you are an idiot.
---
Or visafe
---
:/
---
My dad was the same. Worse in fact, because he still does it now.
---
They didn't grow up with this technology and some people can't quite understand it.
---
&gt;There was no way an account with this much time and effort put into it would risk everything for a lousy 4 mil scam, right?
---
A bitter lesson was learnt today.
---
R eally, people need to let other people enjoy the game how they want. If you don't like pvp then don't pvp
---
Why would you give a random person your blowpipe, especially when you are already broke?
---
Ah right, I knew there was something I was forgetting
---
^^also ^^my ^^herb ^^runs
---
^^^and ^^^the ^^^diary ^^^dailies...
---
Sick fuck's
---
Don't be so woke that you let your brain fall out, which is 90% of you "woke" folk.
---
Never lend anything besides to a friend you know irl so you can punch their face if they don’t give it back.
---
just stake it then chofl
---
I know I should be doing NMZ, but I'm from the year 2006 and new content scares me. Ammonite crabs are weird enough. I do need to imbue my rings, though..
---
Spirit tree to North West ge, ring of wealth tele,  and varrock tele after med diaries. If you tell there a lot, I like to put law, dust, and lava runes in my pouch. Gives you teleports to a lot of places, including house and ge.
---
&gt; Am I an idiot for falling for this scam?
---
I think we both know the answer to this mate but I don't really want to be rude.
---
There's nothing to do, you traded him your blowpipe. If you wanted to keep the blowpipe, you shouldn't have traded it away, to anyone, for any reason other than selling it on the G.E for the current going rate.
---
Reddit really is the best..
---
It's when a player claims he was wrongfully banned and posts on reddit hoping to get his account unbanned then a jmod looks into the activity of his account and tells them that he was without a doubt botting or real world trading etc etc. Aka the jmod smackdown becuase he is getting everyone on his side then gets destroyed by a jmod in front of thousands of people
---
Insanely lucky photoshops
---
Has the amount of nests you get from birdhouse runs been reduced? I feel like I’m getting less than I used to a few months ago. It’s either that or I’m just getting bad rng.
---
Because I trusted him, I look up to those with such high stats, and I couldn’t imagine someone risking their account for that.
---
Trimmed mining cape is the right answer
---
Is this the new f2p transportation system they polled?
---
Like EPIC FUCKING GAMES
---
Counts as a hammer for chests in raids...so it’d be consistent
---
what about for the rune one
---
Crabs? What are you even talking about now?
---
I like agility 😂
---
&gt;risk everything
---
He didn't risk anything. You gave him your blowpipe. It's his now.
---
Except they both suck
---
He’s risking his account by scamming me, he could get reported.
---
Burning a log, superheating an iron bar and burying a bone all in quick succession so it doesn't interrupt any of the other actions, thus giving him more xp/hr between the three skills than if he was training them one at a time (EHP is efficient hours played, so pretty much xp that you can expect to gain in 1 hours time.)
---
Where did I say that I need an elysian? What I said was that I thought getting an elysian and then infernal cape would be less hours than getting infernal cape and then elysian. Assuming I plan to get both of them then ely is the more efficient to get 1st.
---
If you have completed the inferno then you are able to get zuk tasks - which are a hell of a lot easier than killing it off task.
---
Yeah I bet Agility is up there with RC as being one of the rarest
---
Imagine joining the Black Arm Gang when the Phoenix Gang exists.
---
birdhouses have been [nerfed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Bird_Nest_Balancing_and_PvP_Changes), yes
---
il really try!!
---
The lore basically makes that impossible. Thank god.
---
oh my god thats hilarious
---
Unfortunately my gf and I dont have much content in this regard. Our choices are pretty much- 
---
Mole
---
Kq 
---
Gwd bosses are okay for duo, may only last a couple of kills
---
Wildy bosses
---
Corp is okay but it is more running than fighting
---
Also one thing to note is, since you are so much higher your friend/partner will have a difficult time getting kills which can be discouraging :/ so maybe try to keep pray off for easier parts. Or dont pot up sometimes
---
You can't block the email address either because they completely spoof the address to be the same one from Jagex. Also follow remember these things when reading emails:  
---
1. A real email will always show your character name not just "player"
---
2. Jagex will always message you via their website message centre
---
3. If you click the link, the phisher can see that and also gets your IP address. So don't click or you will get more.
---
4. Jagex will never make you enter your bank pin outside of the game
---
Finally the phisher must've got your email from somewhere, so try googling your email address in "quotes". Maybe you made an account on a rs fansite 10 years ago that got hacked, and someone sold the emails to this dude. That's the reason I keep getting these. Try checking [this website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
---
Here's an example of a phish scam I received:
---
Hey I’ve done this as well 0 raids completed for me though
---
Cool idea but having a watering canbpet is pretty dumb in my opinion, and not dumb in the "so ridiculous it's actually cool" way. If it was instead some sort of bug that found its way into the watering can I think that would be a much better idea.
---
Bruh 1% x 2% = 1 / 5000. 
---
That's the same as a draconic visage from KBD.
---
Imagine not having varrock medium diary completed
---
Glowing brain: Sell the nests and buy ppot materials
---
That’s when the Wildy was safe. Then it became dangerous again and they were all moved to this cave.
---
What runes?
---
Oh man I remembered it was like a personal ambition to see all the emotes. Whenever I saw a rare cape you know I'm asking to see that emote.
---
BONES the GOAT
---
I mean, you said it yourself, he is 125 combat with a lot of time spent on his account. Why would he beg in chat for a blowpipe?
---
Calisto. Such easy money. Just have one person assigned to hold loot and let the other person take the beating from pkers
---
I tried doing this for about 30 seconds and quit. How the fuck do you people care that much about being perfect with ticks.
---
Using the 221 ge price, raising them for 18 years (365 daysx18+4.5 for leap years) would be about .42gp/hr.
---
Unfortunately that’s the problem, there really is no risk on his part.
---
Ultimately you traded him an item and he backed out of a verbal agreement.
---
The only risk he took was potentially wasting his time if no one fell for it :/
---
I only use food dropped from other players at fly fishing spots
---
Shieet dude 2 edgy
---
People are lucky but also, they come here. Rare drops of all kinds happen to ppl. Youll get something rare at some point im sure. But it feels like everyone is always getting lucky and that simply isnt true
---
Bruh
---
Is this the Best way for getting the pet or is it still karambwans(no ticking here bois)
---
Some people are lucky and it's statistically inevitable. If Ranger boots are a 1/10,000 drop, then 1 in 10,000 people doing their first clue are going to get it on their first drop.
---
Just how it be, gamer.
---
Best of luck with that
---
Petition to relocate all minigames to a hole in the ground north of Falador.
---
Uhhh.. I dont think I have actually.. But im questing  like a madman now..
---
water spell to extinguish fire like in CoX
---
Yeah true, I should’ve thought it through more. I was desperate
