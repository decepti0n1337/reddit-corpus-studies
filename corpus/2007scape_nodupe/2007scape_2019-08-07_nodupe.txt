65m in 8 months is awful though.

You wish you could get 99 runecrafting in a mere 9 years BOY
---
Can I at least get half?
---
I mean, you could just scroll past?
---
Ah maybe this is the issue, tempted to test it now.
---
Agh!! Another one of my money makers ruined!
---
Cannon accuracy is the accuracy of the style you are equipped with/selected in the attack style screen. If you cannon with very low accuracy, you won't deal damage but you can draw aggro. So then your ironman can get the kill without being aggrod. They fixed it and perhaps banned a couple people
---
Probably best to send this to a mod to get the guy and all his alts removed from the game
---
nothing.
---
That math is really complicated so don't sweat it. With multiple people rolling you have to account for any number of people getting the pet in a single kill. You go down a rabbit hole real quick.
---
nechs and dusties are catacombs only, there are a few other ones that can be done but they are more expensive/more effort to do.
---
Couldnt you just scroll past my comment?
---
Flat as this planet

Too bad OP is perpetually stuck with Desert Amulet 4 lmao

I mean he can't really progress without it so whatever tbh

---
Jagex won't reply to this cause they always are when it comes to the Falador Massacre
---
And I said it's pointless to talk about what the top 1% makes because it won't apply to 99% of people. Also the comment you replied to wasn't talking about efficient TOB.

Here's a related tip: in order to use less battery go to the settings and you will find an FPS bar so if you are doing low activity actions such as fishing or cooking you can run it at 15fps and save your battery a ton of life.
---
Nice.
---
It'll cost whatever someone who wants it is willing to pay for it.

---
It'll never be worth it for the average person

Ffs why the toe detail!! this subs fan art is some real footscape shit

Are you able to do 25 plant runs at a time? I tried and it stressed me out so bad, couldn‚Äôt even do it.

---
I don't think it's a meme at all. People genuinely think rangers is in a boot table that's different to every other unique. And that rolling wizzy means they missed rangers.
---
It's not true. It's sucky, but it's one of the better uniques to roll in that clue pool. So it's not absolutely sucky.
---
Imagine seeing this image as marketing for a game as one of your first impressions. From the outside looking in, OSRS graphics are an absolute monstrosity lol how does it get any new players when this is what they see on the App Store?
---
and who likes you? :(
---
I‚Äôve sort of done the opposite. Rigour makes Vork a lot easier and the dhcb takes so long to save for that I‚Äôd rather have rigour for other bossing/jad tasks, etc.
---
Still don't get how or why this is useful. Phones notification bar does the same and doesn't need a tap in a tiny corner that could register as movement.
---
I agree, I like the fury
---
yeah but that's 8 months mate

Have you tried paying 2k for it to be removed and re planting a new seed you've purchased on the grand exchange?

The potions are crashing hard right now though, the Divine Range pots are still listed for like 14k in the GE, but in reality sell for like 4k.

the ultiamate flip , gratz
---
If I get 99 runecrafting in my entire life I‚Äôll honestly be surprised
---
And an Ironman account is supposed to stand alone, not utilize hundreds of other accounts to benefit just the iron account.  
---
But I'm kinda 50/50 on this one myself. I want content, but understand why he's doing it.

I've looked like I'm 30 since I was 14. It's a fine line to balance.

If you are willing to have it cost you 4-5m to access it for 2 weeks you can make an alt account and you get an extra 800 bank spaces.
---
Or make a f2p alt and use it to store all your ftp items

So give a genuine answer.

If it‚Äôs genuine and it is ‚Äúused against you‚Äù then you should be able to back up your ideas.

Or just continue virtue signaling and never offending anyone by never holding a real position.

What's the plan for the months up to Runefest? Maybe September can be a general game improvement and QOL month?

---
US and canada are almost the same country. They are closer together than say germany and france, even though they both magnitudes larger their social coherence is one and the same.
---
Both like guns, both value personal freedom above collective strength and both have origins as terrorists against hte UK creating independence. (Basically 4th of july for the US is a celebrating terrorism, though since the terrorists won it's called "freedom fighters').
---
wtf..... lol this is hilarious
---
ive never once seen it in chat ever, anywhere. i must have a setting turned off or something
---
What song is this pls?
---
Also I would imagine everyone that isn't a high combat level is some sort of pure right?
---
Could the mounted heads in the Skills room behave like the boss lair display? It currently feels like a waste having them sit in the bank. In turn, remove the combat xp that is given when mounting them.

Why not just donate them through paypal

Ruin everything trivial so poor people dont die for the crime of being poor... I mean yeah?

Nothing wrong with how it is currently.

Only people who have trouble securing a Runescape account spam Reddit/Jagex with their request to fix the mess they created. Pretty much the same as when half of this sub was unable to decide for themselves and had to hide the polls before they could think for themselves. Also, it might be just me, but I never see such an amount of users begging for Jagex to hold their hands on any other site/forum/social media then Reddit.  That said, consider the following;
---
he LARPs as a " software engineering major " student but yet he doesn't know shit about Runescape's account security or any other of his post are about this subject. I could link everything but just look at his history post to know this little frogboy is obviously dumb enough to lose his account.

They literally just released a new minigame the other week with Prif; The Gauntlet. As for why they don't remake old minigames, I mean they kinda just did with Dungeoneering and The Gauntlet. They've considered doing it for others like SC and SW, but at the same time, despite the apparent demand, I believe Minigames didn't rank high in priority polls.
---
If we do see the old minigames return, they won't be as they were, once again like with Dungeoneering and The Gauntlet. Their old idea for SC and SW wasn't as they were, but an SC and SW Hybrid. I expect we will see more of that kind of stuff in the future. But it is not something they do too often since Minigames can often be a flop (e.g. LMS, which is getting a rework to help address this) or not well-received (e.g. NMZ). They can't just port over the old minigames either since creating RS2 content exactly is harder than making original stuff. But if The Gauntlet is any sign, we may see more reimaginings of the old concepts in the future.
---
That's why he still called it a lottery
---
I've never been outside of the US, but my guess is they dont all call it Powerball. Frankly, I'm surprised the states themselves could be on the same page about it.

I mean, most people kill it with range because it's more DPS iirc. My experience with Meele vorkath is not up to scratch so quote me if i'm wrong but you can't snipe in hits with a DHL Vs a DHCB during acid phase.

Is the scythe necessary to do this? I would assume of the 3 prime would be the one limiting your clear speed to get to the other room, not supreme.

Thats incorrect. No runes are given if u boosting above 99. It has been confirmed that even if u boost to lvl 104 when u are lvl 99, you will not gain any extra benefits in any skill except combat ones.

Nightmare zone/Prayer/Agility/Thieving/Crafting/Fletching/Cooking/Fishing/Woodcutting. It really depends on what you're doing though. For instance I always found motherload mine pretty chill but I would not try mining anything else since that might be a little intense on a phone. I'd suggest trying out some skills and seeing what you like. Hope this helps
---
Only if the increased speed of killing supreme saves you from overlapping spawn times, which it doesn't.

I've never been close enough to a QC but do you lose it whenever new quests come out?
---
Maybe but I'd argue not since Ironmen can do activities that require multiple people so clearly working with other people isn't out of the question in every situation.
---
In this case all it does is save settled time since its just a numbers game for the rune xbow now.

Do you guys ever make alts that don't directly involve themselves in RWT so they have a low chance of getting banned? While you kill green drags and revs on accounts that are likely to get banned frequently, you could play the other acc on the side doing low intensity activities, slowly getting requirements up for better money maker like gargoyles or zulrah or raids or something? Idk I spend some time thinking about yalls situation and what the best way to get the most gp/hr would be.

Fuckin a I'm from Wisconsin and I've never even heard of this life hack. I've been drinkin using my fuckin belly for all these years smh

Could there be a way to make the golem drop tephla for only one person, e.g. the one who does the most damage to it? Zalcano is a great mix of teamwork and competition but I find myself despising people who run up to a golem I clearly claimed and grab the stash for themselves.

First up, you're a fucking idiot. Second, your "proper" spelling was wrong, which I'm guessing was irony, but at least make it good irony. Third, since when was OSRS just for English-speaking people?

I'm not sure if that is needed. The perk to mining in Prif is that you can get Crystal Shards. Reduced spawns as well may not be OP, but I don't think the Prif Mine was intended to replace or rival the Mining Guild just like its trees don't replace the Woodcutting Guild.
---
Lolol it seems logical to get experience from taking damage.  Its funny to see new people figure things out
---

It's more that I think such an upgrade should come from a different piece of content, like a new dwarf quest.

Well before you could leave it on over night while you're sleeping or when you're at work, school, etc.

you do not have to buy a new one, but you cannot equip the one you have until you complete them all again. Good luck questing!

this comparison is null because those people werent ironmen. the whole point of ironmen is the abolishment of player trading which is being diminished here.

---
Nice! What's your stats? I'm thinking of doing Demonic gorillas too but I think I need some levels...
---
Don‚Äôt you think they would make the lamp take a very long time to get and remove very little xp? Gaining XP isn‚Äôt the game, having fun is the game... Me having 2 att didn‚Äôt even affect my combat level... it‚Äôs just the aesthetic.
---
Barrows gloves have a def req anyways. This just sounds like a shitty attempt at making someone feel bad for a mistake they made.
---
Then Pennant must be giving you the better seeds. Because with 99 Farming and Ultra Compost, I got 8 several time and 9 and 10 like once each.
---
That‚Äôs almost 4 mil xD people make more than that in one game
---
I feel that it's in the same vain as people that splash. It's against the spirit of the game and yet it's still generally accepted as a method to train. It's an MMO. Player interaction is virtually impossible. I'd say this is unethically fun and an unethically great way to get the community involved without diminishing his other accomplishments. Hes also mentioned in other videos that he has people help him look for other implings. So this really shouldn't come to a surprise to everyone.
---
Not a fan of this
---
Bond buyer's are great. They help me keep my membership
---
Nice
---
How would you explain the update that destroyed hundreds of pure accounts to the extent that they had to register to be able to have their XP reverted?
---
I'm fairly sure jagex has said this is a bannable offence
---
Washington, USA baby
---
imagine being against the way other people play their single-player game mode.
---
Not really imo, I dont think it goes against it. Its imp scouting. Its not that serious lol.  Its not in the same vein as using a main/alt to tank for you but deal no damage for bosses etc. 
---
He still has to catch it himself, compete against others. And quite frankly, advertising something like this will get him help, but it will also attract way more trolls to go take the imps before him as well then otherwise.
---
*Durial321 intensifies*

If people are going to dish out responses like
---
&gt;Something you would know if you actually did tob yourself lmao
---
Ofc I'm going to be cunt to them. My first comment wasn't even that bad tbh, all I was saying is that the OP had a really high amount of deaths for his KC so he can't complain about getting a low droprate in FFAs.
---
I saw him in person in Tampa, my gf was shaking hands with him in one of his videos üòÇ
---
LMAOOOO
---
For what it's worth, I dont think barrows gloves have an explicit def req. It's just the quests required to get them give def xp
---
arent ironman supposed to stand alone?

Please give me an example wherein a lamp that removes 200 xp but takes 10-20 hours to get ‚Äúchanges a lot in the game.‚Äù

He complained about earning $50 for his last 300hours-spent video so hopefully he starts to realize it's better to upload more frequently.

Bummer, I guess you'll have to stop watching his content then. I'm sure you were supporting him financially too so he'll really miss that.
---
Hey dude, plesse tell us about that one time you caught over 87.000 Lizards for a 99, because you couldn't go for a faster xp rate, when available to you.

Or that time when you did 200+ hours og Temple trekking, or just 200+ hours of any dead content, not even for a 99.

Just any similar grind i would love to hear about and if you have grinds that are insane like that, pls make videos, because I love to see people who abuse themself!

My dude, 30 kill is not a sample size worthy of noting any kind of irregularity.  Youll notice it even out after 1000 kills
---
I'm pretty sure they both progress on task, but that may not be true for irons.
---
You‚Äôre right my apologies... however adding a 52 def req to the gloves would solve the problem presented.

I really dont give a fuck dude
---
We‚Äôve caught a rare glimpse of a jad giving birth. Breathtaking.
---
it's 16 per dose
---
&gt;The people that criticize him for this would be the same people that moan and complain that he's requiring time to meet goals now.
---
I couldn't give a single shit about that. I still disavow anyone who breaks the spirit/rules of the game-mode.
---
I don't necessarily apply that to novelty accounts though. That's since the main point of Swampman (Locked myself in Morytania with no bank) differs from the point of regular IM/HC/UIM (solo progression without trading other players [+no dying for HC, +no bank for UIM])
---
Okay edgelord
---
Is there a runelite setting so when you hover over a prayer it doesn‚Äôt make the text box pop up describing the prayer? That always gets in my way. 
---
Also, same thing but for hovering over an inventory weapon/armor and it showing the increase/decrease in stats.
---
As an american I also expected firearms. Though I approve of this more. Video games cause drinking not violence!
---
With the lost respect, it's not in the sense I can't stand to watch him, it's just after non-stop grinding out everything no matter how rough it was he reaches this last rng wall before ToB and then takes his following and uses it to his advantage. Any other mort only Ironman would basically be out of luck at this point. I don't blame him because it's the smart thing to do in terms of involving his community and also no wants to spend thousands of hours walking back and forth looking for imps. I personally fear when I have to go for the zammy item from lucky imps (or clue juggle) on my Zeah Ironman. Not sure if that clears that up on how I see it. With the bog tile ID, anyone could of used that while it was available. Not everyone has pool of thousands of people to call to for help. 
---
Yes the grind would be absurdly long, but there are other paths to do ToB with other gear methods. Yes it's worse dps, but still possible so the rcb isn't 100% needed. It just gives him a much better chance of completing. Overall he's not that far off from attempts without it. He would need to buff his combat stats and do some herb training.  I also get the borderline halt thing which really no one wants. He doesn't want to be sitting there failing 100+ times having to restock/gear every time when with a rcb he could get it after 10 times. That could be the difference between Episode X coming out 2 months from now or 8 months from now.
---
It's likely you could get noobier players to scout for 3m each. But I still believe it's easier if you've well known to call to people and have them help than if you're some random or small time dude. 
---
There is community involvement I think, just not on larger scales. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to bring people together and unite them for a cause. There is other ways to do that too asides from impling hunts.
---
Also I don't care about the down votes. If I did I would of deleted the comment or never made it. I was mildly surprised how fast it just jumped on though. At least I'm not the only one though he shares this opinion. Some dude at the bottom of the post I saw that got buried too.

Damn. Rip

why? there's no rule against it

That creepy bitch
---
I think that if an Ironman sees an imp call-out, it's fair game.
---
I do not think that Ironmen should be paying other players for imp callouts (trading w/ other players.)
---
But with novelty Ironmen accounts, I don't care.. since it's like they're playing a separate game-mode.

Imo, try the beads of the dead from Shilo Village quest. Can pick them back up for like 1.5k or something from the npc. They may look nice with that setup.
---
Hi Crystal Maiden
---
Imagine playing Ironman and asking people for help.
---
I think it‚Äôs also different when you‚Äôre in a 4 man of casual players with no prior experience and welfare gear. And I mean really, like 10m bank gear. And then someone who only plays mobile. You really can‚Äôt assume everyone has a 1-2b bank. That‚Äôs cool if you‚Äôre in an elite pvm clan and what not but that‚Äôs not at all the majority of people. Meaning there are bound to be people in our teams that make it majorly hard to clear tob. You really can‚Äôt judge someone on their tob k/d for that reason alone. One person can easily wipe a team.

Lol, I don't think anyone really cares about ironman integrity though, considering that the "top" ironman clan was founded by at least one bot (probably more considering they defended his "one offence of botting" defence). At least if you do the things I mentioned you're actually playing to game haha.

Since according to you, I'm condescending, I take you're a basic snob. That thinks that a game can survive without mtx at the expense of subs only.
---
Cute.
---
No one wants the sub price to go up. Kids and other people would rather play wow or FF14 since the sub price is close to rs3 or osrs and get more for the money. 
---
Players make in-game money on rs3 to get hinds for orsr or rs3. 
---
Do you really think the game is gonna last? Can you grasp basic math or just want to scream "mtx bad, rs3 bad"?
---
Dota2 generates shit loads of money out of cosmetics, game doesn't change for that. Also, Dota2 has one of the highest esports prizes every year. 
---
The fact that you think mtx are bad makes me think the only thing you played besides runescape was some shit Chinese mmo.

More condescending attitude in the form of "Can you grasp basic math?".
---
It probably died because you didn‚Äôt feed it lmao
---
I was first winning 4 million bets on the bots then I started looking then I lost every single game after winning 4 million.  So I took it as far as 100 million.  Never again will I bet those scam bots at G.E.   dam asians allowed casinos in runescape
---
Hey there! Best way to do it is in my experience is to just not DH and go for max Str bonus. Many people do full obby. Normal Rumble with Kendall, trapped soul, king roald, sand snake, and the other low level one. 
---
With this I can hit 6 hour timer while not using my full inv of Absorption pots, set a timer on your phone and just remote into desktop and click the absorbs to reset timers!
---
The thing is, can you? Because as I see it, neither can you grasp basic math nor do you care about the future of runescape, might it be osrs or rs3. 
---
Just another feeble mind shouting mtx bad, eoc bad, rs3 bad, osrs good and money falls from trees to pay for development.

My main money maker was vorkath but I've been making just as much if not more at zalcano. Should I sell off the dhcb (sold my bank for it) and make some upgrades all around or keep it.

75 defence 78 prayer 99 everything else
---
 Its called a peity pure basicily a main which can do all pking styles like bridding, venging and whatever else. Pvming is no problem cause you will have high stats.
---
I have a quest cape on my iron and basically (missing a handful of quests that I have no reason to do) on my main. My main motivation for finishing the quest cape on my iron was specifically so I could rid my bank of all quest related junk because I desperately needed any bank space I could find. However, those quest related items were typically tradeable, just hard/annoying to obtain manually (like HAM robes). A main has no excuse not to just use the GE when they intend to finish the quest. My main, on the other hand, sits at a cool 500/816 items because I just buy whatever I need off the GE when I need it. The only time it'll come close to filling up is if I decide to keep a huge drop tab, but it'd have to be a several month long drop tab, which is a huge commitment.
---
&gt;My front tab of my bank is 1-3 untradeable quest items
---
There aren't really even that many of those types of items. Stuff like goutweed and random keys maybe account for max of 50 bank spaces. I think if you *genuinely* looked through your bank, you'd find plenty of things that you don't need to keep in your bank. Random seeds, HAM sets, clue rewards, etc...
---
&gt;Aaaaaalso! I have like every teletab so I guess when I make the portals in my house that will clear like 30 spaces
---
I don't really use teletabs at all. I don't have a reason to do clues or quests on my main, so I don't have to keep a bunch of awkward teleports handy. I have a maxed house and take my rune pouch everywhere, so that covers me for every tele I'll typically use, and probably saves like 30 bank slots.
---
Got three 99s afking Nmz. Basically coppied [spellsey](https://youtu.be/z3pmWYDZnvI) guide. Custom normal rumble with kendal, king roald, sand snake, trapped soul, and count draynor as bosses. Sometimes i left to go to the store and id still be in nmz 25 min later, very afk. Easy to study or other shit if your busy while still being able too level your account.

To be honest mate, unless you're a try hard nerd, know the game off the back of your hand and have plenty of spare time, making enough money for a bond, especially on free to play is just a massive task and not worth your time. 
---
I'd just pay up month by month for a few months until you learn the game, maybe in 3/4 months you'll have enough in game knowledge to sustain your membership with gp whilst still making bank gains

Might as well just add everything settled asks for. Funny how the rules are constantly being bent.

i don't pk so this is speculation but i think most fights end before either player runs completely out of supplies, so it's just a free bit of extra def?

Yeah man it's those fuckin libs amirite? It's definitely not like poverty, or lack of access to education, or low economic mobility, or well documented systemic corruption, or poor economic opportunity.

Not much of an ironman, but tbh it's still interesting. UIM is easier to say than morytania only account no banking, even though it's pretty much false at this point.
---
Start questing! Work towards the prereqs for Recipe for Disaster, and do what you enjoy. There's an optimal quest order on the wiki if you're into minmaxing, but I wouldn't stress too much about it starting out.
---
Diaries are just a list of tasks you can perform in a certain area, and after completing all the tasks in a certain area's tier (easy/medium/hard/elite) you can claim a reward. Some of these are very, very useful. Two that come to mind for early game are the Ardougne easy diary which gives you infinite teleports to the Ardougne monastery using the cape, and the Varrock medium diary which lets your Varrock teleport go to the GE instead.
---
you think you deserve it because you got some rare rdt drops lmfao?

deserved, you're the retard who was trying to scam ppl by 'helping with fcape'. hope you get 3 def aswell. die now

i'd like the Rest option to be added.

But he had to go fulltime if he ever was to complete some of the other grinds (mainly slayer) in reasonable time. That shit took 2 months full time. The series wouldve long died if he hadn't gone fulltime

The issue with this logic is that it's by no means a compromise. The idea is to accomplish everything within Morytania. That's it. And he's doing that.
---
Did you stop watching when he left to talk to King Roald, or to get a saw? Those imstances were objectively more of a compromise to the account than asking for help scouting implings.
---
Obviously I'm not the content police and can't force anyone to enjoy anyone's content, just saying that the idea that this is a compromise of any kind to the concept of Swampletics or the integrity of the account is inarguably, objectively, unequivocally false.

Tag one, change pray, tag another, change pray etc. 4 healers in total, no hurry. Take your time

But where did u tele to
---
Ah, reposting at its finest
---
Sorry. This is not dragon impling? I met you deep in the swamp 3 days ago in a weird purple Santa costume in w495. Right after you logged to zulrah on your main, there spawned a dragon impling. We followed it for quite a while before giving up on getting in touch with you.
---
^^made with mematic^^
---
Nice! What was your stats and strategy?
---
Could we see an agility styled race minigame? You would go to a designated location and enter the race. Then when the amount of people were in it the race would start. You would have to run around a large area(like maybe through the desert) and possibly complete a few easy tasks along the way. Prizes could be certain amount of graceful tokens depending on how you do. Maybe a chance at a tradeable black graceful dye.

Given the numbers involved in the first LMS beta and the relatively little dev time its required - Most of the dev work was done outside of core working hours. Its so far been very worth it.

If you do happen to have an extra one that‚Äôs somewhat leveled up you don‚Äôt want and would also like to make a new friend to play with in the game I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it.

so how does this work? if we find a lucky implying in say, camelot, are you gonna wait for it to fly over to morytania? or are we only scouting imps in morytania?

They are bots that actually roll a dice.

Nobody knows if they are rigged above a certain amount of money.

Pretty different situation IMO. Trading items across through various means is quite different to alt usage. I do agree that buying kills in BH should be a de-iron straight away. And all those that have bought kills should have this happen immediately.

THIS. It literally shits me when people get boots and are like "tHaT CoUlDvE bEeN rAnGeRs." It could've literally been any other item as well.

&gt;Their fail-safes and lack of instant authenticator removal makes it a little more difficult to gain full access to someones account.
---
They send you an e-mail with a link to remove the authenticator in an instant?
---
And yes if you RWT/bought your account you shouldn't be enjoying the same level of support as a regular player who doesn't break the rules and doesn't waste support time. Jagex does more then the bare minimum but I can understand you wouldn't see that as you only visit Reddit and this place is truely a gathering for special kind of idiots.

&gt;I haven't seen any explicit rules saying that you can't do any of that.

*To coincide with the launch of Hardcore Ironman, and in order to protect the integrity of the game mode, **Ironmen are no longer able to receive drops if they have had another player tank a Boss for them.***
---
You literally can't use alts at Bandos anymore. Graardor has a 1/3 chance of doing a ranged AoE attack. If this touches another player, no loot for you.
---
I feel your pain kind of.

 I have 4300 kills.

The notion that information in any form threatens the integrity of an ironman is complete fucking bullshit.
---
My friends are the type to cheat if they are able too. For example in minecraft realms it took them 3 days to go in creative mode. As much as i would like doing it your way its just not realistic for us. We would need an authentic experience for it to work
---
Sorry I'm not that experienced but how did you slayer experience at the slayer master?
---
But its fun right ? Right ?????? **cries in corner going dry aswell
---
I dont mind cus everyone quits eventually i just want the experience no matter how long it last
---
I think you can't get bolt racks if you only go for a specific % (I think it's 88%), which seem to be the meta right now.
---
88% of what?
---
Rewards potential.
---
Monsters/brothers killed?
---
accwarehouse has mains for 1.3K last time i saw some there
---
but why would some1 buy a 2277 just buy some a lil over/under 2K
---
If your switch is older than 2018
---
Ahh i completely understand where you are coming from. But if someone has commited more time to gain levels and gear should they not be able to take those spots for the reason it gives the people being crashed a first hand glimpse at what its like down the road and it will motivate them to get stronger and better gear to keep the spots from crashers and crash someone if they feel so even after hopping a bunch of worlds first.
---
Its like in pvp. You go out and get sat by someone really good witb a clear skill advantage on you and it inspires you to get quicker and smarter yourself. Goals are really important and these situations sound like the perfect carrot on a stick to keep you going forward.
---
Again i get you but i also think that viewpoint is a little to much on the negative side yah feel.

My only gripe with Zalcano is that it is generally not worth it to throwing Tephra unless you are buffed by the blue marks as those just triple the value of every Tephra.
---
Osrs did it first though. Rs3 copied it :/ Rs3 bad.
---
bit weird but ok
---
never said that
---
fuck. off.
---
That makes sense. I‚Äôve never checked my log I just knowanna I‚Äôve gotten so many and traded them in.
---
Yeh thats also a super valid point tbh. Suppose its a glass half full sorta situation
---
What did you struggle with most, shorter prep or the boss fight ?
---
Oh shit didn't think about that, maybe it's for the best he won't come.
---
Can do in like 9 hours when I get on if you still need it.
---
Oh hi doggy
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games untill someone‚Äôs comes and gmauls you a 40-40‚Äì40 ;(
---
Very rare you should be able to figure out sort of how rare on the wiki. Gratz dude its a very nice pet
---
Total world, git gud at tanking and if you don't panic when getting attacked just fight back. Most people pking at wildy bosses are fucking imposers who can do a fancy 4way switch but that's about it. So if you attack back you might even pk them yourself.
---
Save your gp, it's much more valuable than USD.
---
Ill have to to check it out then.
---
You just minimise the amount of time that bandos can use range while the non-irons are logged in and kill mage + range minions as quick as possible then log out on those accounts.
---
You underestimate r/prequelmemes power

Doesnt matter. Tbow uses significantly less supplies than trident/pb. Trident/pb is barely 2m profit an hour after supplies, tbow is like 3.5m
---
25 day old post lmao

weird flex, and whos kacy

For example i got the mining per at 61 mining and at that level per iron ore the chance was 1 in 714k and i mined like 1k an hour.

I worked through the medium achievement diaries one by one and did the quests I needed to for those, then moved onto hard.  By the time you‚Äôre half way through the hard diaries you‚Äôll have the quest cape! It will hardly feel like a grind.
---
Bonecrusher, db necklace, bury
---
&gt;Lol, so if I asked you to tank bandos for me, would you just take a range hit and not go near him? If someone runs past Venenatis while you're killing it, they take a hit, then you'd say that you got that player to tank Venenatis for you? Come on, please tell me you don't seriously think that.
---
Are you baiting or just retarded?
---
I specifically said I know that's not what actual tanking means.
---
I also specifically said that's what Jagex means when they mentioned 'tanking' in their blog post. Jagex says that if someone 'tanks' a boss for you, then you don't get loot. If a player gets hit once, then they 'tanked' for you, ***ONLY*** *according to the mechanic that Jagex implemented.*
---
&gt;Jagex attempted to fix an issue (people using other accounts to tank for ironmen) but it has unintended consequences.
---
That's exactly what I've been saying.

---
Haha i did 61 like 5 years ago and dont remember. I was only at the rocks for like 10 minutes and i was crashing someone... he got sooooo mad. I did the 61 to 69 on 2 sessions on mobile while at work irl
---
Mobile 1 tap drop plus full zoom in makes it easy as
---
That makes sense like I'll be honest I don't do the whole flipping thing, I used to in RS2 when I was a teen but there was a lot less competition back then (so a group of you could manipulate prices if you had enough money don't even know if that's still possible though I do know it's against the rules so best just not even trying)

I hope not.

It's insane when people unironically say this. "Just get two rune Dragon alts wtf" like bitch the amount of time and money to get that done you bet I'm not making a bloody alt when it took me 5 years to get my main to a point where even it can't do rune drags.
---
It got about 64 fletching levels for free, so that makes me straight up Gangsta basically and means I never have to cut all them innocent trees that could be going to level 3 Bots.
---
Hard to say... Some weeks I go with 0 deaths, this week I've died 3 times.
---
I'd probably say around 40 deaths but like 200+ escapes.
---
No its not you just drew a dick
---
Looks like he changed his name, or I didn't correctly guess the number of spaces in his name.
---
I really hope so, I wouldn't mind 1 bit if they took 1.5-2 years off doing nothing but making OSRS HD a thing. The game has more than enough content to go on for a very long time. I think it's time the graphics get some love and a makeover.
---
It's a runelite plugin.  Have to enable it in settings.
---
Well yes but the expected outcome is that after a certain amount of drops you get an item. If it's 50/50 then after a certain amount of drops then your chance to have obtained the item can go up to 99.9%... even if each drop is independent
---
=(

---
But I genuinely thank you.  I am a reformed man and will not play rap shenanigans that got me muted.  I will carry on Gods work.
---
For super welfare, slayer helm, black dragonhide, rune crossbow and enchanted ruby/diamond bolts should do well enough. Use Ruby bolts for the first 50-60% of their HP and then swap to diamond to finish off. Recharge prayer at the altar above. Good luck!
---
really wish I could afford one. I'm stuck getting one kill per trip with bgs/blowpipe
---
That this was caused by reports, if the bots annoy you report them and it will get them muted aswell.
---
its 50/50
---
Just reached out to Lottie today, have hit up a lot of the Jagex staff.  I am requesting a current pet dry streak report.  Would like to see my rank.

---
Depends on lure spot.
---
Singles Lure, try to logout, then wear bulwark and dhide body. Make sure you don't get 5min TBed.
---
Current lure, just run and probably die lol.
---
Never happened to me. I dunno what kind of phone you have if it does that.
---
It definitely does not. Your odds of seeing any purple at all are affected by the teams effort. However your individual likelyhood of receiving a drop it's purely dependent on your success and effort.
---
The victim has to do everything possible to secure his house/account. That means locking your doors and using 2FA for example. If he doesn't change his behaviour people keep robbing his house/account.
---
 If someone broke into my house, I know my house has some weakpoints that the criminal abused and thus I need to make sure the next criminal can't exploit that weakpoint to gain acces to my house. Luckily I don't know people who's house got robbed but I assume people who got robbed take action to make sure it doesn't happen again.
---
I'll 100% agree we should change the behaviour from the offenders but it isn't that easy. People will remain people. Some of them have good intentions and others don't. Over the years there have been thousand of books on this subject of the mind of a criminal but none of them actually has a "perfect" solution to stop their actions, or I haven't read it yet. 
---
The punishment they should receive isn't my cup of tea so i'll leave that out this discussion if you don't mind of course. But a quick word on this; How do you think Jagex could punish hackers and other shitheads? I really find it hard to find a punishment that would actually work these days.
---
This is why I take my online ID/account security pretty serious. I know there are dickheads on the internet since the very beginning and if I didn't know that yet Runescape thought me not to trust anyone online. (Getting scammed for a 20K bank at a very young age has been a good thing) 
---
My conclussion: That's why I get a bit upset with people who say Jagex's system are shit. They're only as effective as the user using them. From Jagex's data it turns out +/-50% doesn't use 2FA at all! Compare it as using a credit card/debit card without a security code. You can't expect the bank to put in all that extra work just because you don't feel like you need a pin.
---
It's actually 86.5/13.5
---
Thanks for down voting me for politely asking what you were referring to
---
I love the design, reminds me of pre eoc. Bought it the minute I could.
---
If they made it a toggle, then every single new item would need two models.along with all the items added post 2013 needing updating.
---
The team is quite small and all of the hd models would need even more work as they are hd. This would be an enormous amount of work and would take ages, meaning no new content while it‚Äôs being worked on.
---
Also looking at the recent release of song of the elves where people weren‚Äôt happy with the new chat heads and some weren‚Äôt ok with the rework in general, there would be a huge shitstorm on twitter and reddit. 
---
And all of this would need to pass a poll by 75%
---
I would quite like to see it but it‚Äôs really not practical
---
The entire philosophy of the gamemode is single player. The current alt meta goes completely against what ironman is suppose to be. But it's extremely powerful and allowed, so of course people do it. I'm not emotionally invested enough in this game to care what people do, be it botting, rwt, alting, whatever. But the hypocrisy is clear and it is objectively against the nature of the game. I think it would be very hard to argue against that but feel free.
---
You look exactly like someone with 99 cooking lmao
---
The tower to the east is an asshole
---
I don't, because you have now idea how statistics work.
---
I don't recommend them without dhcb or tbow. BP is good, almost as good as dhcb but you need money to invest in it and your profits will quite remain low. Just kill baby black dragons for the task and do some other money maker for money
---
The retard to whom I was replying said that if the game doesn‚Äôt prevent him from doing something, it‚Äôs allowed.  I was pointing out the retardation of that statement by highlighting that it would render the show pointless if carried to its logical conclusion.
---
Shamans are some of the most fun monsters to kill in OSRS so you should actually consider yourself LUCKY. I wish you the best for the next 100k kills in the months to come!
---
Just watching films is fine too, it's just an alternative to that. I watch films while doing the same kinds of things too, like grinding hunter.
---
Yes I realize each roll is independent, I don't know the proper terminology, anyone know what I'm trying to ask?
---
What
---
It‚Äôs a great feeling especially when your like me and pretty inept at high level combat. I think it took me 11 tries in desktop with a headset
---
If you think about it being a main is like playing group ironman but with 100k other people.
---
I was in vr chat and ended up in a vr theater where I watched this entire "movie" while some random guy explained every single fun fact. I still have no idea what it's called but I know there were titties involved.
---
Games full of silly children. I 3v1'd a team yesterday, I killed two just to die to the third and they were waiting for me at edge bank to call me trash.
---
I think I‚Äôm at 200 or so now. I really don‚Äôt think Jagex does much about them, much less actually make new pmods. Seriously if Jagex really cared they‚Äôd just promote a few high reporters

Don't get me wrong, I understand WHY people do it, and even why people PK clue hunters. Chance at the individual being stupid enough to bring their entire bank with them.

It was in my pocket while I was smithing. I would Smith and lock my phone at work and put it in my pocket. It unlocks if you swipe right away after locking, which it must have against my leg. Not only did it tap the ditch, but also put me north of East Varrock.
---
Sister shag
---
I know it's off topic but I've always wanted to know. I have an account that I play on with what would be considered a "bot name" like 5 Castle 37 or something like that and somebody told me to be careful with a name like that because multiple people reporting me will lock my account/ban with the system jagex use. Is this the case or will it just ignore the report after a scan etc?
---
Chance of not getting it, 99/100.
---
Chance of not getting it 200 times in a row 99/100^200 = 13.3%
---
Yo I have a piety account with 99 range and 70 def 75 attack.
---
That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get, they don‚Äôt advertise their odds and even if they did they could lie.

That‚Äôs cool I can work with whatever
---
    P(drop) = 1/100
---
    P(no drop) = 1-(1/100)
---
    P(no drop n times) = P(no drop)^n
---
so your example is (99/100)^200 = 0.134 so you have a 13.4% chance to not have a 1/100 item in 200 kc
---
i like it and give the ornament little bit more use than being an kit for second best pickaxe
---
To be fair in most states it is legal for children to drink alcohol when  under the supervision of their parents, although letting your kids get hammered every weekend from age 10 is a good way to get CPS to take your kids. You aren't allowed to purchase alcohol until they're 21, and even that is more dictated by state, State's can choose to lower their minimum drinking age below 21 but then the Federal government will not give them a shit ton of money for said state's highways maintenance.
---
Scroll is still technically correct
---
They advertise the odds, they roll a number 1-100, you win if you get a number over 55 usually. However there's no way to guarantee that it's a true random roll. I'm sure it's rigged in their favour.

Can we have the option to cancel a spell book swap? Currently if you click the wrong one you have to either use a spell or wait 2 minutes for it to change back
---
New players seldom enter the inferno
---
Don't use mystics. 
---
For maging (everyone but ahrim and minis in the tunnels) use nezzy, dragon or dhide top/legs/boots. 
---
For ranging (ahrim, maybe minis if you really need inv space) use nezzy, dhide top/bottom, and fury. 
---
For killing minis in the tunnels you can use whip and ddef, or range em if you decide not to bring those. If you decide to range them, camp dhide boots for everything and don't bring dboots. 
---
If you want you can bring the dds to spec karil to save some prayer.
---
If you can afford it, I would recommend you get a smoke battlestaff or staff of the dead, along with a tome of fire, at level 75 magic. Fire wave will do much more damage than iban blast and will save you money in supplies over time. Sell fury if you have to, it's pretty much only a defensive upgrade over the glory.
---
Aim for below 87%. 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm gets you to 86.2%, 4 bloodworms gets you to 86.4% but it's such a marginal increase that it's not worth seeking out.
---
**Below is the stuff I bring, probably irrelevant but may be interesting.**
---
Personally, my setup only switches weapon/offhand/neck/cape, I camp nezzy/dhide top/verac skirt/dboots/berserker ring for a mix of defensive and offensive bonuses. For mage I bring trident, occult, zaros book, mage arena cape. For range I bring fury, bp, ava's. For melee I bring fire cape, salve, bludgeon (whip/ddef is better). 
---
If you can afford the inventory space, salve is a good item to bring because you'll often be killing skeletons in the tunnels. It's not necessary by any means though so if you need more supplies it's probably the first thing you wanna drop.
---
you're cute :D
---
&gt;buy a fury
---
berserker neck is better for the full obby setup, you know this but ill clarify for OP anyways.
---
I know of people fire striking lava dragons as soon as they hit 13 mage. Other than that I have no idea what you could do with little time investment
---
KBD doesn't have its own unique though. Barrows prices aren't super high but they also aren't backed at their current price by anything, alch price is still way below their current price. Can you imagine the flood of maxed and high level players that would come to barrows if a pet got added to it? Their prices would plummet and now the mid tier players who actually use barrows to make the best money they can make suffer because their profit is much lower now.
---
Complete brain fart. Good catch. Forgot the neckslot is included in that set bonus.
---
Yea at you‚Äôre level I would just trident everything but Ahrim, blowpipe that. Two things that‚Äôll make your runs faster for sure will be using stamina pots, and blood spells for healing instead of banking for food. The extra money spent on runes/stamina should be offset by more chests/hr.
---

---
Why is it so hard to make stuff untradeable, then? I've advocated for the introduction of new untradeable drops from quests/bosses/raids/etc. and no one seems to think it's a good idea. It's funny, things like barrow gloves wouldn't be close to being so iconic if everyone could simply buy them, yet every single new shit we get is tradeable.
---
looking real sharp dude :) hope you have a good time
---
Your an idiot if you think infernos should have a death chest, do you even know how expensive it is to do inferno
---
He gets a drop 1 in 22.5 raids. If he's doing trios then he isn't thaat lucky. Any bigger squads then thats crazy.
---
Yeah fair play. Runescape is a good game for stuff like that. It can be so chill as well as intense I love it
---
Stats could be better, but ad long ad you're having fun then you're doing alright! Have you been questing?
---
Your math is bad. A monster with 100hp will give you 100 slayer xp but maybe 400 ranged xp. The math just doesn‚Äôt work that way sorry.
---
I see you at the ge on a regular. Next time I do I will reference this post by saying I referenced it. You'll know.

Yew(Magic from level 75+) and Palm trees.

Gotcha, sounds like that was the right choice for you, definitely.
---
I don't really love adding the d pick to Zolcano's drop table since it's already pretty good gp/hr, especially after factoring in the crystal seed drops. But maybe if they let you gamble your Zolcano loot for a chance at a d pick. You'd lose all your normal loot so it wouldn't be worth it for normies, but gives players who don't wish to go to the wilderness a slower, less lucrative way to get it while still being locked behind a grandmaster quest.

I‚Äôve been hanging out in ‚ÄúWild CC‚Äù and they do some raids pretty often and nobody seems to mind taking new raiders. They took me and I only had 8 raid KC.

i actually just claw ahrim and trident the rest, tabbing twice per run adds a good bit of time i reckon. was getting 3-3.5 minute kills with this

Thank you! Do you know what this is called?

Man, this boss has been riddled with reasons not to camp them.

It's a love/hate thing with Jagex on stuff like this. They usually buff bosses/drops if they need them, but it often takes several years.
---
You gotta have a legit problem if you got 20b debt lol
---
You people do realize that, even ignoring quest experience, a single pack of air tiaras gets you form level 1 to level 4, right? The experience doesn't scale well into mid levels, but early runecrafting is actually pretty fast.
---
Tyty!

It‚Äôs not lol. RSBuddy is OSBuddy.  Rsbuddy.com. It‚Äôs the same thing as RuneLite but RuneLite apparently has more features for free and is more popular.

i think ive seen about 5 or 6 double chests, not a single triple/quadruple. kinda to be expected tbh, those are quite rare

There's nothing legit about it, they'll stack the odds in their favor and pretend that you're getting a fair roll.

Well actually there are daily/weekly/monthly highscores too, but yeah this isn‚Äôt competitive. Honestly even if it were for highscores it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference unless you‚Äôre taking 6-12 hour shifts to be playing 24/7.

If you want your rune platebody trimming I can do that for you.
---
245 items in 3500kc is actually pretty great luck.
---
Chance of getting at least one piece is 1/17.42. So not including double/triple chests, you'd expect about 201 items in 3500 kc. Maybe add a couple more items for double chests, but that's still pretty good luck.

It's better now at least, when you can see that it's just one or two coins. Back in the day, it was the same image for 1 coin or for 100k, and the uncertainty made it even worse.

Eh the efficiency argument is so objective, not everyone cares that much about efficiency, especially at that low of a level, especially with Runecrafting when you‚Äôll spend more time trying to figure out lava runes than anything else in that skill. Unless you don‚Äôt care about doing lava runes and just run through the Abyss. 
---
And if you don‚Äôt care about Runecrafting at all it‚Äôs going to sit at lvl 1 anyway and the only XP you‚Äôll get for it are from quests or lamps. 
---
But all these posts about how hard level 2 Runecrafting  is, don‚Äôt even care about that either they whine about how long it takes to get level 2... at the lowest level doing it the regular way takes exactly half a run to the air alter...

This offer is only for new accounts created with mobile I believe.

Why start with one of those then? You can easily make more money doing something like barrows or demonic gorilla's as they require far less expensive gear to be good. 
---
If you insist, get a blowpipe and bgs, and see what you can do at vorkath. It won't be that good tho, as I assume you don't have a pool at your house and you will at max be making 2 kill trips.
---
Rune dragons will be even worse without some decent gear.
---
Not saying you can't do one of those, there are just far better options with that budget.

If you‚Äôre willing to switch to an iPad, I can recommend one. They run it super well, even a few generations back. You might find a refurbished one for that price. Or, add about $50 and get a new one.

I believe there will be some buff in the poll tomorrow. As for it being a Longsword, it could still be changed but I'd say it is a bit late for that.

Lmao some one asked the same question two days ago here was my response to that post...
---
Mobile is perfect for all kinds of skilling! My favorite thing to do on Mobile funnily enough is Agility it's not super afk but it's nice in between commericals while I'm watching TV or waiting out in public.
---
Here's some other afk things you can do on mobile:
---
* You can train your combat stats in Nightmare Zone so you can rack up points for imbues and herb boxes
---
* Fishing is really chill on mobile
---
* Motherlode mine is also chill where you get a nice variety of ores
---
* Hunter training is also possible; with Monkey Madness 2 completed you can catch Manaical Monkeys for 1k xp per catch. On a good day I average around 55k xp/h.
---
* Woodcutting Mahogany or Yew logs are pretty afk (I personally find Teaks not afk enough)
---
*Smithing ranged ammo like cannonballs and dart tips are really afk. Definitely not as good as the fastest methods tho so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not an exclusive mobile player.
---
Here's some semi afk things to do on mobile:
---
* Agility after a while you don't have to pay attention much on where to tap
---
* Slayer because you are killing things and sometimes you gotta rebank often depending on your task I wouldn't say it's fully afk
---
* Bankstandable skills like Cooking, Herblore, Fletching, Crafting some are
---
 more tap intensive than others and you gotta rebank often which is a pain on mobile
---
* Thieving, once you get 55+ Thieving for Ardy Knights this skill becomes super duper chill on mobile, the only thing is that it is extremely tap intensive (really recommend turning run off when doing it)
---
I think most content is perfect for mobile except for the high level stuff like pvming, Questing and Construction (oh god that skill is a mess on mobile). Smithing is ok afk (for reasons stated above) on mobile you just gotta settle for really low xp/h with cannonballs/regular furnace or do Blast Furnace and zoom the fuck in when you wanna pick up your bars with ice gloves/bucket of water.
---
With the exception of the ardy cloak I agree
---
Those sent official at all tho
---
The app doesn't
---
The mechanics are good as is, if you rework or revert them a lot of people would leave. In other MMOs death mechanics aren't a big deal either. If you want an item sink then the answer should probably be in new skills, new mechanics, and new features in general to get them out. You shouldn't punish players for playing. That is a terrible feedback loop and the game would lose quite a few people including me.
---
I think it might be people using guns actually o_0
---
I am sorry, i was mistaken and i take back that first sentence. Everything after it is a good statement on its own.

They absolutely do ban these accounts. If you check, it‚Äôs not the same bot day after day, it‚Äôs a different one, because the original one was banned.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt that Jagex isn‚Äôt doing much. It‚Äôs that there is an overwhelming number of these being created all the time to replace the ones that are banned, and they just can‚Äôt keep up. 
---
They need to hire more people, and realistically, start banning the people who interact with these bots as well. If no one feeds them gp, they will go to other methods like skill botting that are way easier to detect and ban using the automated system.
---
What's zalcanos gp/h post nerf

You could always play the game. You were the whole time. You just played it in a way that isnt enjoyable. You were willing to sacrafice all the hours to think the game starts now. Well its way past that part.

Inflation. End game content is literally spewing gp into the game.
---
Another vote for the we do raids discord. It's pretty cool, there are even mentors that'll pick you up and teach you the ropes for absolutely free, and it's by default a splitting discord (Meaning even in your learner raids, if the mentor pulls a tbow, you get a full split unless they specifically stated otherwise).
---
Also, don't worry too much about "holding your team back" in CoX. It's MUCH more forgiving than ToB. You can die 50x and the worst thing that happens is you have a smaller chance at getting a unique. As long as you don't do something shady like sneak into an experienced raid group by lieing about your KC and saying it's your alt or something then no one will really get mad at you.
---
All that being said tho... If gold is your primary objective, you might wanna skip CoX all together. 400m is enough for a very nice ToB setup (pretty much BiS minus scythe/tbow) and ToB makes significantly more than CoX in the long run so yeah.

Which is the entire point, to be official. Nobody cares about normal accounts, in the same way everyone ditched their unofficial irons when the gamemode came out for real.

Other than that, remember it‚Äôs a game and having fun is your number one priority.
---
The outfit is only 2.5% bonus xp and less as you are still buying it piece by piece.
---
Unlocking upper level is faster inventories due to reduced running and change in how the ore veins work which not only gives more xp/hr but more nuggets/hr as well. Only problem being the 72 mining requirement on it, but generally you can wait to do MLM until then or just have 100 nuggets for when you do.
---
Bigger bag and coal bag both reduce the time it takes to bank. Not sure on the math here compared to 2.5% but again they do increase nuggets and xp per hour.

Yes, it makes the whip untradeable so if you die (in a PvM death, and less than 20 wildy to a non-player), it just appears in your inventory along with other untradeables. And it'll count as a piece of warm clothing at wintertodt.

Even if that doesn't happen to you often, unless your home internet is garbage it should never happen with remote desktop.

Into the abyss miniquest puts you straight into 9 rc and only takes a few minutes.

Recruitment drive also puts you in 9 agility and has basically no requirements, allowing to almost skip Draynor course entirely (which is terrible exp/h). If you do Gertrudes cat and itchlarin's little helper you gain another 4k exp which is almost level 21.

Getting 30m combat exp in a couple months at crabs is excellent. But you're right nmz would not be doable at all. Sand crabs is a very happy medium for those who are looking to do it that way.

Yes, you fill the bag with 3 invens and then bag to bank. Coal bag saves time because you fill coal into that and reduce the trips from bag to bank by 1 or 2. The bigger sack reduces the deposit-&gt;bag run. These combined with the upper level being right next to the deposit saves lots of running over time since you'll be at MLM a long time if you go for 99 there.
---
Not to be rude but it literally does work doing what they said, and you need to either assess what you're doing wrong or just practice and do it better/faster. Being tick perfect is not easy most of the time, even doing stuff missing very few ticks on a long term basis is tough.

The only way I'd ever touch an ironman account for me. Also, some kind of implementation for when all your friends quit.

That would probably fall under bug abuse.
---
For the bonesaw case, a Jagex mod officially stated that what he was doing was fine.  And it was clearly part of the design of the game mode to let ironmen buy from stores shared with normal accounts, so stocking stores with a main was clearly something that was a possibility.  And people were loudly pointing this out to Jagex from day 1.  
---
Then they changed their mind when it became clear that this gave a big advantage to accounts doing it.  Which is fine, but shouldn't go banning someone for doing what you said was OK.  And in the end when they split out stores, you could basically buy all you wanted with your ironman account, so you didn't need a main to stock it.  So it's not like bonesaw had a game-breaking advantage for a couple weeks of doing what became the ironman meta.  And even if you did want to "fix" it, they could have rolled back his boosted levels or cleaned his bank of store bought supplies rather than banning him.
---
Staking like trading was clearly something that was supposed to be disallowed from the get go, and it was.  If ironmen found they could trade after a game update, I think they would understand 100% that's a bug, and know not to abuse it.

Exactly. Training RC is only bad cause of its xp rate. In my opinion construction is the worst skill to train if you aren‚Äôt looking at xp rates. Building tables and removing tables over and over is incredibly boring. Couldn‚Äôt imagine if xp rates were 60k an hour instead of 600k+
---
Keep it super simple for you: High level players that have been playing forever now have a ton of money, there are extremely few items in the game to spend such money on, ely is one of them, the demand goes up, the price goes up. Use bullet points if it helps you. All other points further express the lack of potential additions to such pool of items. bless your heart bb
---
Now I wanna know what the 1st most upvoted post is.
---
And according to it, topaz amulets would be best.
---
Never even heard of them.
---
They will buy/sell at the listed prices and be fine?
---
No one says which amulet to definitely do.
---
We'd prefer if you stopped with the /r/idontunderstandprobability bullshit instead
---
Well that answers that. Time to feed the Venezuelans!
---
Theiving is 200K+ XP an hour, it's one of the easiest 99s
---
That is, by definition, not incest.
---
There goes your argument.
---
None of it is super critical if you're just starting out, but that guy has it a bit backwards. Normally players nowadays wait until 85-90 combat level to even start slayer. Low level slayer is horrendously tedious and slow, with hardly any gp/hour.
---
I understood what you meant. It went a long way towards ruining the aesthetic of RS3.
---
Plug it into the dps calculator.
---
i was banned because i sent a pm to a friend saying ‚Äúmy friend and i are starting new accounts together‚Äù as a 10 year old, meaning we were both going to create a new account, jagex didn‚Äôt buy it and kept me banned. good thing i was going to start a new account anyways!
---
There qould be no GWD gear as no one would be able to kill a bossnwithout anyone else damaging it.
---
2366 here pet at around 1500. ...all i want is a claw, still none
---
Really? I'll admit when Im wrong. Im just starting to play again after years so I am relearning but when I asked my cc quite a few people said it took them like 100 mil+ to get 94.
---
Are you getting 2-3 from bursting Slayer monsters ? Cuz I don't think the people I asked were doing that. They did ape still afaik.
---
"Earning a bond is long hard work? How do I get a bond without doing that?"
---
Congratulations, the first cape is always the worst.
---
Your next attempts for slayer task will be much easier, plus you'll be able to upgrade your range gear as well for faster runs eventually.
---
I'm not sure what you used to aggro the healers but chins work really well in case you were wondering
---
Yes it is if my problem is gold sellers who do not belong on the game.
---
Swampman great
---
Sad that people still doesn't understand that negative weight after 0kg doesnt matter, your run goes down as fast with 0kg than -15kg. If you're rcing with graceful, you could use a fucking wrecking ball as pickaxe and still run as long as you with your efficent black pickaxe.
---
24 hours of effective play time would produce an account insanely better than this, lol.
---
Its okay tho its shit like this that causes people to ddos thise who deserve it.
---
Not a cat?
---
You mentioned the fun factor, but then we have skills like RC and agility which lacks that so I‚Äôm unsure of that can be a good enough reason.
---
I‚Äôd pay for a 9 inch black cock any day of the week wym?

Most updates with high ticket items have passed, all your points you've tried to defend have been wrong. No need to start acting like a condescending prick.
---
Test this yourself by buying and selling a few
---
Not yet wat the hell
---
no need to ask questions and act like you cant comprehend basic economics (assuming youre pretending at this point). we had like 1 item from tob enter the pool of ""high ticket items" - just stop. peace
---
Is that a problem? What would be a good way spend money to those rich high level players who have *everything*? I don't get your point.
---
The duel arena tax have had a great impact on economy. At the start of the summer season, many item categories actually suggest that the economy is moving towards deflation. The inflation is not problematic at the moment.
---
The lack of item sinks is a problem. Warding could have remedied that.
---
What is with the 26 iron swords just go do knights sword
---
My parents pronounced it "run skape"
---
There's plenty to do aside from quests.  Training skills, making money (either through skills, combat, or merching), just being a slayer chad, bossing, PKing, pure skilling, etc. etc.
---
Runescape caters to tons of different people with different playstyles.
---
Wow imagine if people actually knew and gave an answer instead. I'm at work, just wanted to see if anyone knew before I get home. Too much to ask for I guess, nothing but negativity and rude shit.
---
It‚Äôs called being friendly, may want to try it some time. :)
---
Im not trying to fix problems, im explaining why these specific, expensive items become more expensive.
---
30 seconds every month or two = a tonne of time wasted? Huh TIL
---
In other words, this change would require ENGINEWORK
---
Play the game how you like, you‚Äôre doing good! I personaly entered the game to have afk money making/ progression when I had spare moments in the week. If you feel like you ever want to level crafting, I personally recommend making gold jewelry. You make a profit and get crafting xp. Pretty afk work but that‚Äôs a pace that just matches my own liking!
---
Being stupid lucky and getting bloodhound at kc 3 is meaningful to anyone? I'd say the person who has grinded 200 masters and still no pet has more meaning than that
---
Smithing steel bars in the blast furnace would make you 600-700k/h from the jump.
---
&gt;Does paying for membership mean they will take away my "Cool Kids Club" card because I could earn it by playing the game?
---
How would anyone know?
---
If you're the concerned with what others think then just lie and say you used a bond.
---
I pay for both of my accounts to have membs out of pocket. 
---
The way I look at it, I can spend less than an hour at my real job and buy both them membs for the month or I can spend 4-10 hours grinding bosses to make the 20m I need to bond both of them for a month. 
---
It's a no brainier for me, I don't enjoy grinding money for hours on end when I could be playing around with my friends, doing raids, or grinding stats.
---
This the internets ma dude anytimg possible
---
He asked nicely at first after you crashed him.
---
I upvoted but I don't know why
---
96/99 Rc right now, last 99 til max cape. Instead in laying on my bed, speaks to me
---
Ayyy, Farming was my 1st 99 too, twice; in RS2 and OSRS.
---
So what all pets should just be a guaranteed drop on a certain kill count? That way people dont get their achievement devalued because someone was lucky
---
I think so, yeah, though I expect the difference in max makes up for it. I haven‚Äôt done the math for the trident but I know fire wave is both less gp / dmg and higher dps than ibans
---
Biggest scam of the year
---
Both that and the people it affects actively do not want it, so it's a double waste.
---
Why? The guy posting isn't the one playing OSRS?
---
I'm in the mid 70s of Hunter doing nothing but birdhouses while AFKing ammonite crabs
---
That's why I'm working on 99 Agility almost very first thing what I'm doing with my fresh account. Sooner or later you'll have to train it after all, so why not take care of it immediately?
---
share i tbd
---
I'm confused. When they store experience, do they split the whole numbers and the tenths? That seems incredibly inefficient as opposed to using a double?
---
Is it just the Brimstone keys that make Konar better for immediate cash? I‚Äôve gotten 1 per task ranging from 50k-200k. Covers me if I‚Äôm eating prayer pots but per hour it‚Äôs nothing to get excited about.
---
about 1.3m/hr not including costs. around the 1m mark including
---
How do pkers know what you have? What if you forgot to bank your cash stack or something?
---
I think people also forget that yes voters also have the ability to vote on alts...
---
[Crab Rave playing in the distance]
---
150 people vote yes, 50 people vote no. That's 75% yes votes.
---
Half of each population votes with alts as well. That's 225 yes votes, 75 no votes. Still 75% yes votes.
---
It's elementary grade math that anyone should understand.
---
Alt votes don't matter unless one side is more likely to use alts than the other, which has in no way been shown.
---
why does the pet look like that? looks nothing like verzik in inventory
---
Sorry for the mis-understanding, I didn‚Äôt read all of it so my bad. Everybody wants a fun game to play, right? So I often wonder how we have got many skills that lack the fun factor, bare in my mind I‚Äôve only been playing osrs for about 5 years so maybe it was different when it was first released. 
---
I‚Äôm all for a new skill, I know that many don‚Äôt and want it to stay ‚Äúold school‚Äù but games grow.  if no new content was being added it would just die off eventually.
---
I think this one is sick. You can make out all the words, the map looks really neat up close too.
---
Is he using AHK to withdraw gold ores?
---
Imagine faking a screenshot for the 2007scape reddit. The chat says he just hopped but the log in timer says he‚Äôs been logged in for an hour 30 minutes.

Really loving this community!!
---
Or your the red toxic chat block idk. either your a liar or your toxic. Regardless enjoy the downvote. Do a little more research next time
---
God you're thick. If one side is more likely . What's more likely , someone paying membership for 3 accounts or 1 account ?
---
The issue is that "play how you want" becomes "unless I don't like it"
---
My man ü§ú
---
U could just not store it in the tenths lol.
---
No one:
---
Now: Twitch Prime free months
---
What I did was:  
---
Turn off stretched mode on Runelite  
---
Bellpull built in house  
---
Use screen marker to highlight ‚ÄúBuild door‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemove door‚Äù clickable areas when right-clicking  
---
Position camera correctly (plenty of guides on YT for this)  
---
Place weight on 1 key (50g weight worked for my keyboard)  
---
With this, I was getting ~500k xp/h with max focus but more like ~450k xp/h long term.
---
It's matter of taste, but I cannot tell my thoughts how different boots fits to it - I cannot turn the character around to take a better look.
---
But if I have to choose boots for that, I'd either pick  Piscarilius Graceful boots or Blue Villager sandals. Not sure how well colour themed Graceful boots fits, but sandals would be a comical addon.
---
Oh hells no I can't do ironman, I get upset when I have to even think of PvP. I'm just a crafter, ATM I'm trying to get runecrafting up, to be self sufficient in magic craft so I can smelt as I go and then use alchemy to sell as I go.
---
It's long winded and stupid, but I'm stubborn and like the difficult road.
---
So I won't say no to a little help!
---
Nice ü¶Ä

Hey guys I made my bank doing magics

If u get 126 u wont be able to bully the pures. So if u want to give that part up to not be bullied yourself, then do so. If ur main enjoyment is fighting ur cmb level deep wild, definitely do so.
---
I‚Äôm out the loop what‚Äôs the origin of the crab comments?
---

---
I think the specific part of Dungeoneering that is so costly are all the new items and their graphics. If you want to add 10 tiers of new ranged, melee, and mage gear for armors and several weapon types, that is a lot. But if we reused existing gear, at least visually, it would likely be more viable.
---
With The Gauntlet, it is pretty minimal on new assets with just 9 weapons and 9 pieces of armor, the same floor theme for a few room designs, and like 8 creatures; then a red variant of each. So I expect we will see more Dungeoneering-like activities in the future, but I doubt we'll see as many unique items. Perhaps we might be able to get 5 tiers (e.g. 1, 20, 40, 60, 80 like SC) with more limited choices in types (e.g. 1-3 weapons per style, no chainbody or such). Especially if some of those could reuse existing things like Rune, normal fish, etc.
---
The stored number is simply 10x your actual xp. If you have 200m xp it's stored as 2 billion. So they could increase max xp to 214.7m easily but a higher cap would require storing it as a 64-bit integer.
---
Runelite.net
---
Forgot the coin pouch
---
Well of course, what else would you think they'd say lmao
---
"Oh yeah, warding was significantly affected by alt-voting, but we aren't going to re-poll" wouldn't have the best reception.
---
Probably not
---
Only if you nerf regular vorkath's drop table to make room for this new one. Vorkath isn't a difficult enough boss to warrant a drop table buff without an increase in difficulty imo. 
---
I would like the hard instanced mode to also buff the boss up such as how corrupted gauntlet works over regular gauntlet (more hp, hits harder, harder special attacks). Then it would be okay to buff the drop table w/o nerfing the other one. Since your kills/hr would be lower. 
---
Question though, would untradables also be lost? Void, imbued rings, etc.
---
Slayer and salve are the only effects that don't stack, everything else does stack or takes up conflicting slots .
---
They don't split the number. It's just storing the number of tenths. If you have exactly 2048 xp, then the game stores it as ...5000, not ...0800 with an extra tenths variable.
---
It's very similar to what many financial systems do (i.e. store millionths of dollars as a signed long).
---
I'm not talking about devaluation
---

---
No- Sorry you spent a lot of time on this. Dungeoneering does not need to come into osrs.
---
Not really a bug. It's a game mechanic. A boss doesn't "reset" until it's dead
---
I think cudgel is more like a crush version of the d scim, so you‚Äôd want to use the whip for the extra speed.
---
Lol I'm already lv44. I'm curious what will happen in a month. I just hit lv90 RC and I need a damn break.

---

---

---
Yes
---
Audio is real
---
This is not Dungeoneering as a  whole, Just the Exploring aspect, i hope you didn't let the title scare you off.
---
Yeah it sucks, but it works now for me.
---
What do you mean? Runecrafting would still be the same as far as the activity itself goes. Really just thinking about the skill as a 'magic infusion' skill that covers both runes and magical equipment. I don't mind rune running at all tbh, but it just seems to be the one most commonly complained about. (And not surprisingly the single most bare-bones skill there is)
---
Using the same weapon on the same style, and ignoring stuff like slayer helm or salve only on one loadout, you can definitely say which one is more accurate.
---
I wish I had more points put into whatever makes a good RuneScape player.
---
Instead, whoever designed me was like "fuck it just put everything platformers".
---
thank you!
---
First of all, that video is gold.
---
People abyss RC with eternal glories on 2k/2.2+ TL worlds all the time lol, have you never been on one or something?
---
I don't believe so. They don't have a huge defense bonus against anything, so the extra power of the whip would more than make up for the extra defense the gargoyles will have against slash.
---
Did you read the Suggestion?  One of my main goals what to get rid of the Minigame Aspects while keeping the Exploring Aspects
---
I think that item delivery clan helps with bulk buying, "deliveritems".
---
I've recently been afking gargs with a whip/a by dagger depending on what I want to level with a guthans switch to heal. It hasn't been a problem at all
---
Feel free to fuck off then
---
Even worse lol
---
I made about 20 mil in alch when I got my dwh on my iron so that combined is a nice 50m that I think any type of account would appreciate
---
Typical reply lol.
---
Well wouldnt it make more sense at that point to just add the warding content to runecrafting? Why take out a longtime skill and replace it when you can just add to it
---
jokes on you, my first 99 will be rc (:
---
feel so free to play games that i want, thank you so much
---
I think Game of Thrones is the main reason for the spike in popularity.
---
YelmShawny and his reddit account is dead content. He cares too much about projecting insecurities into his comments, shitting on people trying to make a living (i dont blame him but no), and whining about Swampletics when big bad Settled decides to make a new season. (seriously, we didn‚Äôt have to know about how little money you make. It‚Äôs poor taste to talk about finances if you really just want to bitch about quality content).
---
r/2007scape doesn‚Äôt need well thought out discussions, we were drawn in when 11$.
---
Im not getting anything out of bad comments on Reddit. If I want to make a good impression online but when I purposely misinterpret people's actions and motivations people think *I'm* the asshole and should find a real job.
---
Sharing your negative and thoughtless opinion dude? Really? Poor taste. Being a dipshit and being an asshole: those are two things you don‚Äôt talk about.
---
Can we also discuss how he sounds like B0aty when he emphasizes some of his words? Jesus christ, find your own identity dude.
---
Please leave this game
---
But...THE FACTORY MUST GROW. Just kidding, enjoy it. I started back in 2007 or 2008 and when old school dropped I didn‚Äôt want to play it. Then a friend got me back into it and I love it.

---
No, I looked at the docs created. However, all this new stuff does not need to be added in. As mentioned there is a reason it didn't pass. That's why I said I feel sorry for you spending so much time on this. It's never going to pass and there will probably never be a new skill come into osrs. The reason being is that majority of those who vote "no" to this kind of content is because they came back to runescape to play osrs. The idea of bringing in new skills etc just takes away from the point of re-releasing osrs.
---
It is a rule. And it is Jagex's choice as to if and how they enforce it. I want even really making a comment on you personally but the fact that you claim to ddos them and dish out your own version of what you consider justice is somewhat disturbing and the pathetic. You sound like Light Yagami except instead of killing criminals you intentionally try to starve Venezuelan children to death because it's the only thing that makes you feel powerful and in control of your life.

Sure thing, I will send you a PM now with my ign

"his series" he can do what he likes ultimately.
---
My buddy is LEM at his peak (roughly top 5% of players, still a very long stretch from actually playing competitive though) and he'd certainly take more attempts than I (MG at best) would.
---
It's different skill sets tbh. RuneScape is like 70% invested time, 25% knowledge learning curve, and 5% actual mechanics.
---
CS is like 85% mechanics and 15% knowledge learning curve.
---
Fuck the what wait?
---
It sounds daunting but most p2p players wouldn‚Äôt bother playing f2p. It‚Äôs just that much better. You‚Äôre not forced to do anything but there is an incredibly large amount of different things to do.

It may be overwhelming at first but p2p opens the door to the best parts of the game.
---
That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt IP ban.
---
Already spent it on bonds, nice 11 years for my ironmane
---
The colorations are a nice way to mix it up, but I definitely agree.
---
I mean you did misread it. He didn't say propaganda.
---
I'm down to just Agility, Fishing, Mining and RC right now. 
---
I can't see RC being my last skill due to how AFK it is (can do it on lunch breaks in the office etc). Because I'd also be doing it through Zeah, I'll be getting a lot of token xp in Mining...so it makes sense to do RC before finishing Mining.
---
That you reposted an OC idea
---
Who else tries to slap you five everyday? Its Bowinkle
---
This is so gay man
---
Yes it can.
---
That's really poor logic. The yes voters alts would cancel out the no voters alts giving the same result as if there were no alts in the first place.
---
Mad respect if you do that keep the cape untrimmed to flex on everyone else
---
Yes. The same way a no vote on a main counts 3x the value of a yes vote on a main. So if all voters are just as likely to have alts as one another, you need the same 75% majority to pass as if nobody voted on alts.
---
Released about 2 years ago.
---
I love how you ran out of periods throughout the sentence lmao
---
Yes that happens especially a lot with a VPN since they have a specific range of ips for any location.
---
I‚Äôm so done with that stupid 3 v 1 argument. Think of it logically for like 10 seconds.
---
If the same amount of yes and no voters use the same amount of alts (which is how it should be statistically) it DOESNT MATTER.
---
3 yes votes and 1 no vote is still 75%
---
3 yes votes (+ 3 alts) and 1 no vote (+1 alt) is still 75%
---
Goddamn its fucking dumb. It‚Äôs like no one understands simplifying fractions.
---
These are the people that insta vote no to new skills haha.
---
* There has never been and will never be a clean 50/50 proportional split of people who use alts. That is functionally impossible, so your point is immediately invalid in the real world
---
* Even though the split is 50/50, the yes voters required 75 people to have alts, while no voters only needed 25 people to have alts to keep it proportional. Their real number of alts doesn't need to be nearly as high.
---
* Put another way, no voters only need to rack up a miniscule 25% threshold to get their favored outcome. Why are contrarians rewarded with a much lower threshold?
---
&gt; alt votes don't matter unless one side is more likely to use alts than the other, which has in no way been shown
---
* It has never been shown because it doesn't need to be shown, because it's always true, we just don't know which side it is true for. Again, a 50/50 clean split is statistically impossible. Not to mention no voters benefit more from having sway than yes voters when dealing with real numbers. 10 more yes voters in your proportion (160/50) results in 76.2%, a 1.2% sway, while 10 more no voters (150/60) results in 71.4%, a whopping -3.6% sway.
---
Maybe you should focus less on elementary grade math and more on high school grade math.
---
&gt;it's propaganda like interracial porn
---
He very clearly called it propaganda, dipshit
---
I didnt think they were able to see people's alts. I wonder how they find out?
---
If you dont use melee at all then try wine instead of swordfish. They restore 11 instead of 14, but only cost 1gp so you can use them between each brother.
---
In this vid the interface for grabbing the gold bars is different . was it updated recently? The new interface can't use keyboard AFAIK to grab the gold out like the clip you linked.

It's because you're an unpleasant person.

So essentially people are giving settled money so that settled can pay someone money if they find an impling. That's still just paying with extra steps.

I make give or take 500m a day. Sometimes it‚Äôs more others times it‚Äôs less when I get hit with a ban wave.  I‚Äôve been in the gold scene ever since the original god wars when all the items first came out and I had no chance of ever getting any so I bought gold, later sold it all back for less when I ended up quitting for a while. The website I used made me call their employee to verify the purchase. It was there curiosity took over and I just asked to talk to one of their many suppliers. This was a Chinese website and surprisingly they gave me one of their top suppliers skype at the time and through that I was able to learn about bot farms. It was kind of hard because they spoke broken English and had a thick accent.

perhaps the xp drops lol

What actually happens - 0, 0, 0

Check the actual sender email address and website link if they're proper Jagex/runescape ones you should easily be able to tell.

Absolute beauty of a game! Still hoping for #4
---
Fair enough I did it as a mem

they should at minimum make it best rate for elite clues imo

Only reason you guys say that is because he is dead

Lots of streamers now are very helpful part of the community who do amazing charity streams to helpful organizations. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong Old Nite was great at the time but the RS community has really changed and lots of great and bad things have came out of it
---
Exactly, they make plenty of money and should hire people to give us updates like OSHD and other high developer time updates.

When I got my Vorkath mat I had to flatten it out with books for a few days.

Glad to see the actual video confirms my initial suspicion: this guy clearly has some severe cognitive deficits, his voice sounds like many of the low-functioning patients I meet with Down Syndrome, and it's kinda fucked that someone with such a disability is becoming a meme because people assume it's a person with an average level of cognition who simply cares more about video games than personal hygiene.
---
Hey I remember your name from runehq! Nice to see you're still around :)
---
He made fun of me saying I misread the guys comment, when I didn't. Then I misread his comment. Oops.
---
U doing great champ

Idk, knowing I keep hitting the hydra rare drop table and keep getting everything besides claw feels worse than not getting anything. Tail is basically worth as much as a d med and the thrownaxes are just a kick in the balls with their 1 in 2k droprate. I just want a claw so I can be done with hydra, I find it so tedious to kill and start dieing a lot if I kill more than 50 per day due to mental fatigue.

Yeh it's why now I'm pretty much at a 1 inventory trip and done mentality. Gets me 20-30 kills depending on drops from hydra and then I carry on with other stuff.
---
And hey, hitting the drops is hitting the drops. You could have gotten anything else and not worried about missing claw :)
---
why get a rapier for slayer when d scim does the job good enough?
---
His voice is fucking preborn.
---
No oh my god ^not ^^yet what the ^^^hell.
---
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a lot more profitable to buy gp for less and sell it for more than it is to use a bot farm. It‚Äôs a lot easier to trick jagex‚Äôs muting detection than it is their botting detection. However, it does take time to build a trustworthy reputation if you‚Äôre going to buy and sell GP. There are scammers everywhere.
---
Daily records are 30 hours due to 6h logs my man.
---
How many are within 100 levels of maxing? 200? The logic still stands. If you were relatively close to maxing you could vote similarly to someone already maxed because you don't want to make it harder.

Damn ur weird

Yeah pretty normal if you live in a 2 bedroom flat in Caracas

I honestly have never casted tele grab outside of a quest, I just remember seeing that room and thinking "tele grab must be for shit like this" but I never tried it. I always assumed it would block you from grabbing the coins with some "a strange force holds you back" type text
---
^wat ^^the ^^^^hell
---
Nice pixels
---
Welcome to the boring capitalist hellascape ^tm
---
Did you just humble flex a quest cape on us?
---
Cynical viewpoint. Personally I like to learn what people do, you can learn a lot about what makes them tick and what their interests are. Call me old fashioned. It also helps relate yourself to someone, put yourself in their shoes, etc. But again maybe I'm just weird.
---
Thing a logically a little further. The ratio of sweats:casuals is always gunna be higher for the no votes than the yes votes. The casuals wont make 100 alts to vote no while a sweat will. 
---
The argument is sound.
---
I feel like the prices have already plummeted, with a few items being over a mil. Granted the prices would drop more but I personally feel like reviving barrows is more important than cheap items getting cheaper. Also Barrows isn't really the best money maker for mid level players unless you're lucky and only get ahrims top and bottoms, or have the diary done and then the profits mainly from the rune drops.
---
Lmfao yo trust

you cant complain until you‚Äôre at least 3x dry, or so says UIM Grams, a very wise man

And give Firemaking intrinsic value to F2Pers? Blasphemy?

You're a virgin

imagine wearing a blue helmet with prims, infernal cape, scythe, bandos, torture

What. Brb gonna make 5 alts and just camp cows all day

I was super curious and dm'd him, he replied saying he went to prison 3 years ago because he was by a river under some trees and a guy he was with stated his woodcutting level, and he didn't respond "Nice"
---
Would be sick for no t bow sara if it only took up one invent spot
---
I retract my statement :(
---
I never said any of that shit so don‚Äôt put words in my mouth bud. I dont mind them and i was saying BOTH options. Think outside the box and use your brain
---
It comes out to 750 hours. Doesn't make it balanced. It's too rare.
---
LOL you like massing dont you? Enjoy the shit loot and getting crashed always lolololl
---
[This one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/8jwmfz/when_you_and_you_boys_poop_you_pants/)
---
What sort of input were you expecting?
---
That doesnt buy half of max gear unfortunately. Unless you just leave out tbow and scythe. Way more than enough to max, tho, that's for sure.
---
Victimless crime...

That was Arcanists

He probably undersold tbh
---
No you didn't

you ever remember a time when u were growing up and you hated how adults acted like they knew everything? thats you right now. 
---
Rules / policies change. RWTing is super safe for people buying gold. selling it will get you shafted but its still unlikely they don't really target buyers unless ur buying like multiple billions at once.
---
This entire thread about how alts made no difference in the poll according to Jagex disproves that.
---
Fucking brain dead.
---
It was part of a halloween event couple years ago, which they re-used for a f2p quest
---
Lol yeah all about shit loot when massing and getting crashed when trying to play with friends. Yeah fun lmaoooo and don‚Äôt say everybody, because i know many who don‚Äôt want this bullshit how it is. They want a OPTION to do private matches. Not PURELY private. LOL
---
Loaded with hidden sugar though
---
I didn‚Äôt say my bank was good but I did.
---
Literally lost my bank
---
For inferno which is better?
---
Tbow with ahrims and blessed hide
---
OR
---
ACB with armadyl and ancestral?
---
Like 7 people actually give a shit about CML records, figured you weren't talking about Oslo specifically lol
---
That's enough to get like 75 RC!
---
You're doin great boss, looking great in that gold trim I might add. Hit up all the f2p quests and by the time you're done with the grind for skills and complete all of them you should be just about ready for members. Glad you're enjoying osrs, welcome!
---
Didn‚Äôt realize his implicit belief with no actual evidence was worth more than Jagex stating that alts had no effect on the polls and simple math
---
Thanks tho
---
You have no idea what the fuck you're even talking about lmao
---
They'll never do that with new content for a raft of reasons. Just like how they'll never make things punishing/difficult again in osrs
---
Nu uh you can‚Äôt have shared banks as far as I know
---
Dang it musr have been you. Sorry for the mute
---
Just heads up: Mod Ash replied to someone on Twitter saying that Group Ironman won't be introduced this year due of engine work.
---
pm me your ign

That‚Äôs reasonable. It‚Äôs completely fine to have some pets fit into a super rare category.
---
so I have looked absolutely everywhere online in the forums and on reddit, and I can‚Äôt seem to find any formulas for the rates for which fish are burned (specifically swordfish). I know it‚Äôs dependent on fishing level and factors such as hosidius kitchen and gauntlets. I just would like to be able to calculate specifically which levels to cook which fish based on xp and profits.

What makes you say Runecrafting is any more bare-bones than the other skills?

As you've seen, is probably a fake email. Make a virus scan on your computer before entering anymore passwords.

soooo i havent touched this game since 2013 and have been a f2p for several years, how does one manage to get in
---
Congratulations!
---
wowowow is that what's hidden in the grave?
---
Indeed. For instance, the negative range attack bonuses could be doubled on full helms (-2 to -4), platebody/legs and kiteshield, and then remove the negative range attack on med helms, sq shield (chainbody already has +0 ranged attack). Probably an unpopular opinion, but in this case the extra negative range should apply to torso, barrows armour, bandos etc.
---
I don‚Äôt... that‚Äôs why I said I‚Äôm not sure.
---
No, they still don't use the word step. Often make it very clear that it's biological.
---
its very fun and different (especially on an ironman not having to prepare pots/food/ammo beforehand) but the rewards are actually trash
---
Nah but it's fun to keep the train rolling
---
Nope, just something they've got in the backlog that won't see the light of day because it's too difficult for 99.9% of the community who won't want to even attempt it
---
This should be a mobile ad
