Ah OSRS has been existing ever since? Very well loved game by many
---
---
---
Haha. go pick your stuff up before it disappears
---
do you have 2 step verification for your email?
---
you definitely could do this, the results just wouldnt be anywhere near as good as with an alt
---
Nice
---
I just do remote desktop most of the time instead of playing mobile anyway cause remote desktop works for dual screen while official doesn't
---
Isn't using the controlled stab on a scim the best method?
---
Epic.
---
"Coin Purse". He's been hired by Jagex to replace Mod Matt K to implement some new quality of life features to OSRS.
---
[removed]
---
Horrible people laughing at the expense of others get a life mate they're enjoying them self and that's none of your business or place to comment
---
So I gotta ask; what boots are those?
---
:-D I will keep commenting for the sake of these assumptions comments. Funny
---
I maxed RS3 before coming over to osrs. I definitely appreciate everything in this post. People often blindly hate on rs3 but jagex really has done some amazing things with it. 
---

---
That being said, the mtx really can be overwhelming, and I just simply don't get the same sense of accomplishment from rs3.
---
If i were you i would do all the quests that have good xp rewards. Ie: waterfall quest, fight arena, etc
---
Every time you die you lose everything tho, so you're starting from scratch. No coffer/stash units to get some basic gear even
---
I think assuming people’s mental state over internet is not okay as well lmaoo. You’re being delusional, not us :/.
---
Yes
---
I went from 3 to 34 days. I have no idea how that's possible, it took about six hours from when I first redeemed it.
---
Lol its obviusly CCnC. It says so right there.
---
No, because a scimitar has high slash bonuses, but not stab bonuses. Controlled stab would have bad accuracy, plus it would give xp to attack, strength, and defense. If you only wanted to gain defense xp quickly, then the block option would be the best choice.
---
I love coming out to war with you guys, but when it's costing me all my supplies and money, and we can't even stay to do round 3 when they have 12 people left, and we have 26, it's ridiculous to me... It's fun and all, but damn, I'm just gonna' focus on getting a 50m+ bank like all of you before I get demoralized anymore from using all my supplies. I HEAR the calls to log out and ignore round 3, but wtf, when I'm scouting, and seeing nobody else on but 12 mother fuckers, just listen to the damn calls and stay instead of logging out. We can win a war and save supplies... nobody's gonna read this part but I like dick in my ass.... It's fucking Monday, and I get going up to war on Fridays as i've made it out as much as possible... But damn, us poorer pkers can't afford to make the numbers big in this cc if we don't have the bank to spend 500k on wizard boots, or 5m on staff of light... Fuck this shit, i'm trying to build a bank before just flaming/ragging kids to boost my ego.... Y'all have fun. I'll see y'all rarely from now on...  P.S.: Thanks for the few minis, but i'm still going negative just trying to support the clan instead of enjoying a game I learned to love in 2001.... Games are for fun, not stress.
---
Not even close; it's (debatably) good up to around 70 herblore, but OP has access to herbiboar which is definitely better.
---
Guess I should have put /s

I've never seen her play league and only shooters, and yes she is a bot at shooters

Brutal; should have gotten pre-insurance X)

I did them last october
---
You should first check your bank to see if you've got a looting bag in there. You can only have one, so if it's in your bank, then you couldn't have gotten the drop. If you don't have one at all, then you are just pretty unlucky. I've been dry at druids for 15-20 min on looting bag sometimes as well.
---
My rings aren't imbued. And glory for range, yes. I dont range that often, that's why I didn't buy anguish.
---
Condom Cape Lookin Good!
---
One chord too low... Chord is the right word, right? Pitch is too low.
---
Definitely go and imbue your rings. Forgot to check if you have seers ring but if not it does provide a bit of magic attack.
---
Use addy darts everywhere but end game pvm

I’ve been commenting on this but it never show up. Hopefully it does this time. I’m his S/O and we live together, what do you think?

I looked in my bank and I have none there and I've been killing chaos druids for the past 3 hrs trying to get one.

I got the same dude! rng finally paid out gz 😀😀
---
No-one needed OP to link to the album instead of the image.
---
Yes man! We playin'. Took some puzzling but worth it. The site is partly blocked by Chinese gov. (The links that use Google analytics it seems.) so using VPN until after this point, then opening a mail acc (no gmail) without VPN to register/unlock acc did the trick. Was lucky I didn't need VPN for the change password page. VPN from CN is definitely detectable by Jagex, even in combination with private proxy didn't work. Probs due to the CN firewall. 
---
Thanks for the help, see you on! :D :D
---
Will do, thx
---
If you've checked your bank and don't have one they're in the bh shop.
---
I was certain I'd done this before so I went to check. Remembered what patch I cleared. It was an anima patch. I planted an iasor seed by mistake and then cleared. But this makes sense now that I think about because anima patches are fully grown when planted!
---
Sounds like someone who can't afford it, I'm not going to argue, but my killcounts, fellow agreements from high pvmers, and even content creators, I'm more inclined to agree with experience than quick maffs. Besides, you didn't even lost the screenshot of the program rip.
---
Have you tried fighting in pvp? Its one of the most entertaining content in this game
---
Wow, you're fucking slow
---
I said pathetic not worst, and whats pathetic about it is that it would be the community to introduce P2W and not the Devs.
---
Looks like you’re already playing at max efficiency.
---
I do this but sweaty kids see you as a free kill so it gets old fast
---
&gt;here's a bunch of evidence

You're only retort: "ha you're wrong"

You've replied the same way to like 15 comments, either disprove it or take the L.
---
I think the problem is the tier 70 gear cost like 7k.
---
Hey, nice!
---
Keep it down, will ya? We don't drink bong water here.
---
Yeah this describes all three of my irl friends lvl 60-90 (i lied i only have 2 friends)
---
Why do I always see people commenting on osrs twitter shit that have attractive and usually Asian women as their photos?  A lot of them have names that make me doubt it's actually a photo of them, is it their imaginary waifu's or something?
---
Depends on your RNG some round you will get thrashed and other rounds are a breeze
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying it's closer to Hydra's mechanic than Jad's and that kind of messed me up when I first started to learn zulrah.
---
Lutebot uses commands not the mouse
---
Bro, can we talk about how being born in 89 equals being 30, fml, time is going by way too fast
---
It’s true you’re wrong. How would you like OP to say it to you? Want me to say it to you too? Ha you’re wrong. Here’s the L that I don’t need, it has a better place with you.
---
Nah mobile antivirus is a scam
---
Zulrah is much older than hydra, and was the second boss to use this kind of prayer switching mechanic (Jad being the first)
---
&gt;You really love to waste your time don’t you.

People that bot can already bot with zero risk. It doesn't matter and shouldn't hold a feature back.
---
Ultracompost?
---
Price shouldn't matter when it comes to balancing, otherwise the Brine Sabre would be really good compared to what it is now.
---
I think you read it wrong.
---
Prices fluctuate all the time throughout the year.
---
What's an hp level to aim for 50ish combat BH? Currently have 30 attack, strength and 85 mage
---
From 25 RC you can go and get the small and medium pouches they are well worth it in the end. Especially when you’re running abyss
---
You can't pick up more than 1 item in a tick, pretty sure that's been a ground rule
---
All for this. Or maybe make it a set effect with full d armor of any kind (chain/plate/med helm/full helm)
---
Yes, i hit lvl 86 without a single runepouch
---
what are you.
---
Hocus pocus mods please poke us
---
It's not being a lazy employee. Jagex already notoriously underpay their developers. Imagine being in their shoes, being able to make 30% more nearly anywhere else, but you took this job because you are passionate about the game, and then they turn around and give you an awful, thankless task with a steep learning curve and no transferable skills. You would quit. That is why they can't do that.
---
I think he actually trapped by the subway up the street from jagex hq
---
I think they should too, or just remove negative attack stats from armor, i just want consistency. Either have armor give negative stats to other attack types or not, but you shouldn’t have massive outliers like there currently are.
---
Also, maybe dhide is constricting except for specific movements required by archery, I don’t fucking care, it’s a video game they don’t need a reason for balancing ranged armor other than “it’s currently unbalanced” IMO it should have an appropriate defense level requirement too
---
or perhaps you could suggest which mob i can grind for armor
---
No it should be called 'rainjet' in honour of Slayermusiq
---
&gt;not ascending physical form and shooting glowing yellow light from your eyes from such extreme ecstacy in your mad gains
---
I'd rather hear what other people have to say.
---
When youre new clue scrolls look amazing, but let me tell you friend, they aint. These screen shots almost never happen for the majority of people.

You can't go upstairs? There aren't any bots there.
---
1/65
---
Ok
---
Only 28? I fill up my looting bag with 28 and then jam another 27 in my backpack
---
Definitely doable, but as a fresh member's account it's probably considerably slower
---
What's your gp/hour doing mediums?
---
The only things you can get with your stats in my list by yourself are the Dragon Defender, barrows gloves, helm of neitz, and fighter torso. For a Fire cape you'll want a higher range level, for d boots you need 83 slayer, b ring you need to kill Dagganoth Rex, Obsidan you need a fire cape, for  Fury you'd need to get an Onyx somewhere then high crafting and magic.
---
Well I guess I'm more so saying that it's not game breaking in a "twisted bow spawning on the ground" kind of way. Definitely not intended as you point out.
---
I'm going to Costa Rica
---
Most important question: do you have let yet?
---
&gt;You start to form a relationship with the other players that call it their home world.
---
Do people not have home worlds? I mean yeah I'll switch for minigames because that's where people are playing but 421 is my home the rest of the time.
---
But who HRs the HR? SMH
---
Lots of good suggestions already. Honestly, if you're starting at square 1 with no money, you might as well get climbing boots, RFD gloves, and the explorer's ring. Hell, even leather boots/gloves would be better than none. Any reason for the strength amulet over an amulet of glory? Hitting a max hit breakpoint or something?
---
How is that a problem?
---
But you trade offensive stats for defensive ones.
---
Most Wildy PvMers aren't ready to fight back.
---
It doesnt need a buff. Did Torvesta bitch to jagex cus he was tired of splashing on noobs or something?
---
Price should never determine stats of an item. Shits dumb as fuck

But in giving mid-level Ranged content more power, it still furthers the gap.  It's not as if we're giving Splitbark, Mystic, or Enchanted Robes a similar strength.

---
I remember having to use the sextant and stuff to find the right dig spot too. Osbuddy and RL have made clues a joke.
---
The splashing problem isn't a problem. The problem is that pkers think they are entitled to 100% accuracy with a high damaging 20 second stun going against the combat triangle while the opponent has high tier armor.

I'd personally like Mage to get more options.

The browser spams you 9999999999x with "PLS USE APP PLS USE APP PLS USE APP".
---
The real solution imo is to just use a good app.
---
Wow, that's actually something I'd really like to know the answer to!
---
Whats the lore behind this? Theres also a Man next to the abyssals in catacombs and just screams if you talk to him. I am very curious.
---
Y just on OSBuddy?
---
My friend and I were planning on participating and then we ran some calcs, the ones we could easily get drop rates for, and...
---
Not including:
---
Mega rare clue
---
Artefact
---
Whip
---
Dragon limbs
---
Hill giant club
---
Bryophytas essence
---
And assuming:
---
Godsword shard is 0 time (sara hilt/bandos boots grind)
---
D pick is 0 time (lord of the wild/squishy)
---
Jar drop is 0 time (kraken/cerb/zulrah, still a bold claim)
---
100 chests for barrows set
---
To simply go on rate with no dry streaks, it would take 244.26 hours of efficient bossing according to oblivion's EHB sheet, with 34 hours spent at vorkath, 42 hours spent at corp, and 45 hours spent doing lord of the wild.
---
This does not account for any time spent getting slayer points since it's assumed it is 0 time before the challenge even starts.
---
Please reconsider the challenges involving those 3.
---
What add ons would be good for my bank? I am preparing/trying to prepare for Zulrah. Currently this is my bank https://imgur.com/GBsSDw7
---
I have about 16M currently in cash and will be farming more. I was thinking about Tormented Braclet/Anguish but I am very new to OSRS and not really sure what I should be best using my money on for gearing to Zulrah.
---
D-defence? Why?
---
Question about building a pure. If I go for 50 att, 50 str, 60 range, will training mage negatively affect the build by adding hp and thus adding combat levels?
---
It's great, I'm not worried about you. You give us free advertising with your silly little auto typers. 
---
The name belongs to the community and thankfully, you aren't the community, this proves that.
---
you must have been doing some weird shit.
---
It's not necessarily what it starts with, but the sound. To give an example that breaks your rule, the word universe.  Do you say an universe? Or a universe?

Ohh shit Seth. I found our pure pictures with flippers in my old Gmail earlier.

---
Melee is the most important in the wilderness lmfao?
---
Regardless, while karils does have higher than black dhide, black dhide magic defence is extremely high.
---
Having 2m+ gear in 100+ magic bonus should not yield a 42% splash rate against a black d hide top and a black d hide bottom. The fact you're even arguign this showcases how stupid you are.
---
Magic is so underwhelming that at times, it's literally inefficient to use magic against someone praying range (as ranging against them yields higher DPS).
---
I do not skill at all myself, I just have an Ironman account that I boss/PvM on so I might not understand what is going on. 
---
But I am confused, why do teams stand on the same squares together if there is the ice barrage spell that can be used against them?
---
i was 99 atk/99 str, 80 def. now im at 93 def
---
Would actually be cool to add some random combat boss event like  this to fishing
---
Devalues my homeless only UIM

He's not, however the clan is still running strong and a lot less toxic than in the past now that there is no more Corey. No one has to fear being banned for changing their name, or standing up to power anymore.

999% sure that now that this guy posted on reddit jamflex will nuke it from orbit

That's insanity. I created the account, the name, the idea, and the server.

I gave Dagger his rank and you, your rank.
---
How is it in any way shape or form, not mine?

If you're not worried, why change that user? Maybe change it to "Levy Pools" or something, just remove the name I created and I won't have any issues with you.
---
P2W is usually a consequence of greedy developers/publishers, we have a nice mmo that lacks P2W. Gamers usually hate P2W, many are sick of it, the pathetic part is that the community itself will create the P2W and shoot themselves in the foot.
---
Funny, you call us scammers yet we've given out almost 600m in events since you've been gone. We've actually celebrated you leaving. It was an amazing to finally be free of toxicity.
---
if it's protected you keep it
---
if not, you keep it under 20 wild but it's broken and you need to pay to fix it
---
over 20 wild it turns into coins and is dropped

Tbh with what games are like now new players will likely prefer rs3. Osrs is more fun if you played it back in the day and I think a lot of people have a hard time getting into it. I’m 18 and still most of the people I play with are older than me
---
You're not going to hijack the thread and make it look like you didn't literally steal it from me. Anyone that reads the screenshots will show Dagger admitting multiple times he's stolen it from me, and that I created it.
---
Y'all should just change the name and carry on.

The more comments the better, since that'll make this thread get more attention. The more people that see this imgur post, the better.

Don't page me in your crusade, man. I want nothing to do with you. I'm not playing this he-said-she-said game.
---
There is no aftermath of anything apart from your harassment, which is easily dealt with. You simply got banned because of your insufferable shenanigans. Move on. If you actually cared about this community like you try to say you do, you'd understand that it's better off without you. I have no intention to try and lay out a laundry list, or engage in any kind of back and forth after this post.  
---
You're sitting here dragging the whole thing through the mud in some kind of petty warpath that equates to nothing more than "If I can't have it, nobody can."   
---
I used to be really fond of you Corey, but you're toxic. I've had enough. I couldn't talk you down from actions that nearly tore this community apart, and I had work really hard to put it back together again banning you.

Don't expect another response from me. You already know how our last conversation went.

I've been farming skeletal wyverns since it started and was going to leave to vote on it tomorrow. That was a fucking short poll. I call BS

just started playing osrs again and I am making a magic pure, what is a good monster to train on preferably with some stackable drops. I have mems, currently 33 magic. thanks.
---
they do drop lots of fire runes, so there is no need to bring a fire staff or runes. but im not sure about the nat runes.
---
i remember doing a Bloodveld task recently, not a single nat rune drop, luckly, it was in GWD, and someone dropped some nat runes close by.

---
A tick is how the game interprets commands / actions. 
---
Every ~0.6 seconds, a "tick" happens in game. Ticks are what make the game feel like it has a slight delay, as your actions only occur every 0.6 seconds.
---
A good way to see this is most weapons will attack every 6 ticks, but a longsword for example hits every 7. Therefore, a longsword will get 1 less hit in every 6 attacks because it is a slower weapon.
---
not bad, i dont really use mobile since im always home but next time ill check it out
---
1: Yes, they will splash significantly more often if you have 94 magic as opposed to 75. A tip to improve your magic defense further is to put on mystic might as you're running away since it boosts both your magic defense as well as your regular defense. That reduces the chance of them catching any sort of spell.
---
2: Not exactly sure, as I don't go to revs. From what I've seen, most people bring at least some food and try to tank as much as possible.
---
3: If you're using a Craw's Bow, you'll be a much greater target since the minimum loot is already very high. With blowpipe, however, you'd be risking a lot less and subsequently be a smaller target. Your combat is in a pretty unfortunate position, since you can be attacked by both max people and pures. Because of this, combined with the fact that tanking a freeze is really hard, I'd recommend using blowpipe.
---
Exactly what I was thinking about when I read that. Almost a 2 year sub :’)

Why do you have two 2200+ accts?

What was wrong with Darkscape? I think the OS community would pick it up and really enjoy it. I think its biggest failure was the fact that it was on RS3 engine and not OS. It was trying to pull a major group from a version of the game they intentionally chose to play, to play the version that many chose to quit for a multitude of reasons.
---
I'd give at least $11
---
I can't be the only one disappointed by this thought? I really don't see the appeal in RL or it's features. I mean I can see how they could be QoL in some cases, but OSRS by itself is still pretty playable even without them.
---
When did it become so acceptable for overlays and bright-colored boxes to be so tolerated and necessary that people are even willing to pay for them?
---
Really afk with auto-retaliate on (unless you're a pure). Costs GP to use but so does repairing dharoks and paying for NMZ. 
---
But as I said NMZ should give 1/2 XP rates

Im glad you were able yo tell I was joking

except darkscape wasnt dmm, u didnt drop ur bank, it was basically wilderness everywhere(aka if u didnt skull and had protect item u keep 4 items). Its completely different mode which would allow for longevity, rathern than dying every 2 weeks.

Go to bh world, get target, get damaged, tele out, die to npc, 50% chance of 150k emblem to spawn if they have emblem. Can do this once per 5mins, so 900k/h. Reqs like 20 cmb
---
So honest question, why should I invest in a ring of suffering if, at the current moment in time, my only goal is to kill her once for the diary?
---
Does it make it THAT much easier? 
---
Should I just buy that and a staff of the swamp n sell after I am able to kill her? 
---
My bank is only worth like 55m dude.

What happens to leftover NMZ potions in your inventory when you exit a dream? Are they lost? Have quite a few absorptions but don’t feel like staying signed in this long
---
just like Lynx Titan

I'm pretty sure they're self promoting anyway hahaha.

How is it crashing if he only needs 3 gems lmao

You can replace safespotting for 3000 times with "learning 3 phases with 3 attacks and repeating 3000 times" for zulrah/vork/tob/cox

If you want to train ranged do blue dragons, but it gets crowded.

Eventually look into killing green dragons in the wildy.

If you want to be effective and make money, train slayer. At around 72 slayer your start to make good money.

If his life is OSRS, would it be like Wreck it Ralph?

Underrated comment

The entry barrier for being good at PVP is massive. If your main is maxed, then you can lost alot of bank trying to learn PVP meta. There is no entry level PVP minigame. Clanwars and Castlewars are dead content. Wildy is quiet except for revs (this is the new clan wars?). 
---
I wish jamflex would revamp entry level PVP minigames by providing free gear and supplies that act like meta supplies and no risk on death to help people learn combat meta.
---
I have an elite clue with the step to pack a tier 2 or higher shazien armour and hand it in.
---
I have received the tier 2 set from the fight arena, and 40% required to get the supply crates.
---
It will not allow me to pack the crate for some reason, keeps saying that I need a full set of armour.
---
I have the 5 pieces of tier 1 and 2 and will not let me for either.
---
Any suggestions?

Hey man, try completing steps with both clues in your inventory. I had the same thing happen accidentally a while back. After completing the first clue, the count on the second clue did NOT reset. See the Imgur album in my post: https://imgur.com/o3oZwFG

Bots can make new accounts and start over again. It doesn't matter how many times you ban them. Bots are good for the game in some ways and are taken into consideration when creating new content. It's all apart of JamFlex's plan.

Just for any further reads, U never had to. Its all a joke

Unfortunate. After a little break though you might come back motivated to start another account with different goals.

&gt; This is not true in the slightest. Old accounts are way more secure because generally it’s almost impossible to get ahold of the login name.
---
you could say the same of the email address unless you give it out...
---
&gt; hack that email address and you’ve more often than not hacked that RuneScape account.
---
spoken like someone who's never "hacked" anything.
---
getting into someone's email account is not a trivial thing, and the majority of people get their usernames/passwords taken through phishing so its irrelevant anyway.
---
Oh look a parachute
---
You keep them as they are. If you used absorbtions though, any leftover absorbtion points won't be kept.
---
I can guarantee at least 95% of middle schoolers and high schoolers in the US use social media

I think if he's making dart tips or chopping yews, he'd not have a tbow or dhcb to afk brutal blacks with though.
---
Except if I don’t use the username Bumfuck69 anywhere but RuneScape, it’ll likely never be out there. If I use the email Bumfuck69@whatevermail.com for Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, school, whatever in addition to RuneScape, that information is more likely to be leaked or stolen. It’s simple, the less you use a certain piece of information, generally the more secure it is.
---
afking in the wild is just asking to be killed.

it also means if someone is hopping to find you you have to run away/hop to avoid them wasting time and xp.

It is totally possible in 5 years of hard work and good nutrition naturally. You obviously have absolutely zero idea of what you’re talking about. You have very little knowlegde if you are serious. Seems like you’re just not as dedicated as this guy, and you pulled a fast one with steroids.
---
He wanted to use veracs, hence black dhide not an option.
---
Weird but ok
---
Just wait for another clue scroller to come by and PK him for his spade
---
it doesn't matter if its leaked if you don't use the same password for more than one site.
---
having someones email login does not mean you can hack their account.

I thought that running at a target and hitting them dealt more damage, because you had more momentum

I’m so demotivated to do anything to progress my account right now. I need 60 -&gt; 65 fire making for a master clue step, chompy kills and 61 -&gt; 70 thieving for elite void and 3 more quest points for my fifth block slot and I can’t be bothered to do any of it.
---
You think botters are bad now...
---
You have yet to share how its done.
---
yeah it was you. Also GL in swamptown
---
you could easily hold aggro on prime and rex after prime has walked himself further away from supreme's spawnpoint, but if you're actually killing them he's probably going to end up having to deal with them eventually
---
It’s more like 3-15k
---
you cant use lamps on runecrafting without doing rune mysteries (can still level it other ways though), so swampletics cant even lamp runecrafting
---
The amount of real players with level 3, 20m hunter xp pure accounts would be that small it really wouldn’t be harmful to the player base if they did get put in quarantine for a while

Verac is definitely not BiS against chaos ele.

Rock hammers arent made out of rock, its a hammer made for using on it..
---
Considering this is my second runthrough this quest, i found the bosses themselves in general easy, but the damage they threw out made it much more difficult than i thought, i died about 4 times on galvek (once because i didnt see the 1 hit KO attack) and had to teleport out from lack of supplies another 3 times (2 of those times had galvek with &lt;100hp). highly recommend 3 super restores and 10 dark crabs/karambwans for your fight, but eve with all that it wont be a guarentee kill, you just gotta get lucky with the attacks.
---
good luck on your attempt. and make sure to look out for those 1 hit k0s.
---
I thought black armor was quickest
---
Haha classic
---
You mean, like, book of knowledge? Why not just use them as you get them?
---
the attack styles give invisible boosts, accurate +3 attack, levels agressive +3str levels, defencive +3 defence levels and shared +1 to each one

I've thought of upping my amulet, but I honestly just really like having the edgeville teleport handy. I know it's sub-optimal, but I'd rather upgrade something else.

wow my man congratulations on this huge mega achievement of a fully maximized account. the pure amount of passion, effort, and love of your craft has truly shone through and I am thoroughly impressed and ultimately happy for you in your future endeavors. congratulations big time, gamer! I'll see you in the wonderful world of Gielinor! Happy 'scaping gamer!

Planning on doing MM2 for the javelin head drops at rune drags?
---
3rd best imo
---
1m left, chuck it in.
---
God this guy is a douche
---
it all depends on what method you choose to use, ardy maxes out at 62k/hr, werewolf up to about 70k (but no marks of grace so you lose out on like 20m). mining can be up to 120k/hr pre-99 doing 3t4g, but volcanic mine is about 80-90k/hr and afk mlm like 30-40k.
---
rc with runners pre-zmi nerf was over 140k+ with 4 runners, but would cost you about 90gp/xp, lavas are about 70k if youre good, and bloods/souls about 40k/hr
---
Im current level 32 thieving, and the grind feels worse than runecrafting. It’s taking me just as long to level up in thieving as my level 68 attack. What do I gain xp from at this level?
---
Wow bro don’t be telling everyone my mains name

What do you mean refuse to act on?? Do you really think jagex is doing nothing about it? You're absolutely disabled. Fucking move on and play a different game you imbecile

Can’t you just use the herbs on the leprechaun to note them? I don’t grow herbs but that’s what I do on my daily pineapple runs.

Just kill Prime then have your friend rush Supreme. Most time on it that way without being comboed out. Friend stands close to ladder to avoid Rex or go up if by chance friend gets piled.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion but I like agility and tune crafting wayyyy more than mining. Literally despise that skill
---
Am i missing something or is this just maxing?
---
Because extreme legit accounts exist
---
But why do legend's quest tho
---
i would tbh.
---
Im working on the max grind right now, just got my 10th 99 today. I like maxing skills 1 at a time and have been mostly doing buyables. 
---
Would you recommend saving the shit skills for last, or mixing them in between? I figure ill be more motivated to do them if theyre the last ones but i dont want to burn out.
---
Nice.
---
Nice!  Congrats!  Might be a new record haha
---
nice collection

Ah man the memories xx

There was an old post from 2015, where a guy stumbled upon a huge Emblem farming colony, and started killing them, the people running those emblem bots, tracked his address down, along with the names of his Family members, and threatened that if he doesn't stop, they're gonna harm him. I wish i can find the post.
---
What about a lvl 3 account with 1,4B xp? Should we just lock it because of your arbitrary criteria of low combat lvl but high xp?
---
How could you know that. Skiller accounts exist and are quite popular. It’s also not unreasonable to think that people play full time doing some of these things. 
---
I did black chins for a while and chatted a bunch with the other players. Most of them weren’t bots. 
---
Red chins on the other hand is a whole different story.
---
Looks almost like a hardcore iron man... or maybe an alt skiller.

Congrats on max!

You call for hardly used methods to be nerfed below EHP of current methods, and even call for nerfs when they're well below EHP.  That is more than enough proof that my judgement of you being out of touch is correct.  You obviously aren't taking into account accessibility of methods when you call for nerfs, but I'm sure you can convince yourself it's equally as hard to start training on a rooftop versus underwater.
---
But I digress, there is no reasoning with someone who thinks they're so high above everyone else they can't be wrong.  And RuneScape is extremely easy, stop pretending it is hard.  I bet you used blast furnace, or NMZ, or literally any of the botting resources ever.  Or are you going to tell me you don't use house portals or pools because they make the game easy?  I don't think you use third party clients, which I can respect, but I wouldn't gimp myself if the resource is available.  
---
Get off your high horse, just because your opinions are valid doesn't mean opposing opinions aren't.

You still have 989k, just chuck it a few times and win it all back.

That’s just common sense. I always play games assuming that proper physics have been put in and then discover more often than not I’m wasting my time.
---
They talk less than the real bots too
---
Can u hold more than 1 at a time? And yes, im a noob

It’s like fighting a pokemon that attacks 10x per second

Yes it runs off the resolution of your screen. Higher resolution, smaller window.

Which is why he's not uploading vids of himself doing temple trekking...
---
He said his goals for the next video at the end of the last episode. 85 slayer and a whip. The slayer grind took a lot of time and now he's going to have to rely on rng.
---
if I remember correctly the rationale was that it was a method of rcing that was both unintentional and took away from the spirit of the game. Ironmen need to obtain pure essence and then rc it. The library way meant they cut out one of the steps
---
Nice, but as mentioned below I dont believe you can enter 500 total f2p worlds as it doesn't count the 8 skills that are member only
---
Thanks everyone!
---
I await the attack style update!
---
Nahe still has to 200mil in all, from this account to regular, hardcore, and ultimate ironman. Can't really play the game till 800mil XP.

That’s seriously fucked up. Why are people this serious about games.

Now see this is what the stronghold of security told us was going to happen.... But you didn't listen.
---
You have to start somewhere. Someone showed me how to touch my toes. When you go down cross your legs like put your feet in the others position. Go down and now you’re stretching the sides of the leg. Then do it the other way. Then finish with the original one going down and you should make it further. Hold a bit longer to get the stretch done nicely
---
I remember doing this same thing and then getting sad when I realized I needed more levels to use the 500 total level worlds
---
Goodbye.
---
You’re being downvoted because you come off like a dick, but the “planning or theory-crafting” actually sounds kinda neat. I’d watch that.
---
The super combats will be more worthwhile than the extra food + extra space innit you’ll need like 6 pots per run
---
Yes officer this one right here.
---
\+5 boosts from stews are hell lmao unless you get hella lucky, but its worth trying over grinding even more RC.
---
The account was probably hacked

Remove the duel arena because I'm a loser and have a gambling problem wehhhh

Im tbow rebuild and my bank looks exactly like this lol
---
Not really anywhere near 4b for max setups anymore. Scythe is 1.2 tbow is 1070, everything else u can get for way under 1b
---
I think Settled just has a vision for his series that isn't really possible to live up to with regular uploads.  He's said multiple times that he wants something binge-watchable and that definitely means he's in the mindset that every episode needs to have a decent amount of progress.    
---
Personally I'd love 15 minutes of planning or theory crafting like you mentioned or even random rambles while he's grinding stuff but I respect his decision to do things the way he wants.  
---
Also he's putting in insane hours so I don't think that's fair criticism. &gt;! as of this morning he's 44k exp away from 85 slayer which means he's been putting in at least 10 hours of temple trekking every single day. !&lt;
---
What’s the blue thing
---
Lol and this is why its a long lasting rumor. We had no idea if this was true or not. Just perpetuated it infinitely by going to talk to him "just in case".

Low defence accounts are an obvious exception. Void isnt trash, it's just not best in slot for normal accounts.

Yes it is. It's pretty simple. It's a word that very clearly and obviously has been used historically and contemporarily to show superiority to black people, and its use hasn't decreased to a point where you can claim that you wouldn't know its origin or racist use.

The healers are the hardest part, don't rush them. All you gotta do is get them off Jad. Don't worry about how much they heal him. Tag one of them for every Jad attack so you can focus on prayers. Gl next run homie!
---
Reddit should add a button just under comments and posts that you can press to show support for it, maybe also another button if to show you don't like it aswell, I'm think we can call them upvotes and downvotes, what so you think?
---
yes but you can afk and nmz, make a little money and never worry about getting pked or have to waste time running away from people doing it.
---
i have over 30m points in nmz from afking in there, so i basically get free herbs every day for a very long time now.

People who win big then RWT are actually a huge gold sink, they stake so its a gold sink and the ban is a gold sink too. Plus even if they get away with it, they dont actually add any gold into the game.

The thing is, I know how it works because I've killed thousands of money snakes but noobs fuck it up like crazy. I've taught several people how to money snake and when I teach them to go off of the visual instead of the head they have a much easier time learning Jad phase.
---
I'm not saying that it works for noobs because it's the better method. I'm saying it works for noobs because after teaching this boss so many times this one simple trick is a huge stand out for getting Jad phase down for people new to Zulrah.
---
You're not even talking about tutorial island anymore... 15 woodcutting? dragon slayer 2?
---
Knights swords were very flat to allow for this technique even when bare handed. Like how a 2h sword on runescape is very broad and flat.
---
The entire fight cave trip until you die or kill jad
---
What makes it worse is I’m already 99 cooking so the exp was pointless.
---
I'd argue close half of the things you mentioned aren't "dead content". Just because you don't use it, doesn't mean it's dead.
---
That being said, you still listed a lot of dead content lol
---
How about something that's not a scratch fetish
---
I really don't understand how they can't get a grip on Dicing bots. Seems like it would be pretty easy to catch.
---
How didn't I think about this with my bad wines lmao
---
He literally fakes all his videos how else could he pump out shitty clickbait every fucking day ruining my feed
---
shut up boomer

Why doesn’t jagex make it harder to make an account to fix this? For example, in the gaming scene in South Korea, it’s a lot harder to find hackers/bitters because every game account created has to be tied to their something like social security identification number. Getting banned makes it somewhat harder to make an account unless you have a surplus of SSNs. Now, I know most people would be hesitant to trust jagex with such info so why not something like a legit mobile number from a carrier verification tied to an account (so those texting apps/calling apps that generate random numbers don’t go through)? Sure you can make more than one account with one number but if one of the accounts from that number gets banned, places the others under scrutiny and with enough offense, total ban.
---
The only other thing I can think of is, the rapier being a really expensive best in slot strength training weapon, for rune &amp; berserker pure.  Really general training for players who don't want to train defence.  (Down from the abyssal bludgeon, which is still better if your 1 defence.)
---
Depending on how long it takes to charge this new weapon, it may only be useful for bossing.  I can't think of any other uses for the rapier.
---
Idk what kind of end game bossing you're doing, but on a good week of raids I might make 50-60m?
---
And easy to wear.
---
I skipped straight to a bcp. Best 15m I ever spent.
---
The plugin name...
---
I think he just isn't very experienced in the game.
---
Really great videos, keep it up man!!!
---
Wow lol
---
legend has it even woox didn't beat fightcaves on the first try. nbd you'll get it
---
"Poison karambwan" Vs "Cooked Karambwan"
---
How did you not take the hint of "POISON"
---
Thank you for this. Had no idea it existed
---
Theres a bot farm mining volcanic ash with all combat level 25 accounts with 99+ mining
---
Ok botter
---
I find that pretty hard to believe
---
I shall bear this in mind when I next have a battle with a tyre. Cheers, noob.
---
140k bots were banned last week
---
I didn’t even read the finished product I just kept banking them till they were all “cooked” hahahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣
---
maybe they are hand-played venezuelan jobbers working for RWTders
---
372 days gameplay but most of it was pvming
---
There is a list of the top million passwords found in breaches.
---
Password, password1, 123456, qwerty, letmein, football, and many more simple entries make up that list. 
---
People are bad at passwords.
---
Keep in mind an  accidental ban is a huge PR issue
---
Eh having done chaos runes with my hardcore this statement is highly overestimating Runecrafting.
---
Originally posted an explanation on what I thought was causing it. After posting the explanation I asked if anyone could replicate it. I took the explanation down because i realized I was previously wrong and didn't want people to spend 30 minutes trying this without being able to.
---
I'm saving it for the right people. (Verf/Swamp)
---
Its not my fault I'm disabled
---
On mobile, as a matter of efficiency, the only viable option I’ve found is mahogany tables. It’s still a slog, very “tap” intensive, and expensive as all hell, but if you’re doing the mobile construction grind it’s really about the only way to go. I just hit 80 doing this last night, same grind mobile only.
---
I got an additional visage around 10 kills later lmao this is dumb luck
---
The big saving grace is the money from the skill too.
---
aha ja danku ;p
---
Letting a few people not for a while to find a solution to the problem I find is much better then banning the players so they can make thousands of new accounts because the underline issue has not been fixed.
---
Missed opportunity. Would be much nicer to give a small chance when fishing in relekka to give a special fish that can enhant the lyre
---
I wish my penis was long enough to do that :)
---
Yea I think you must be right, I don’t think Veliaf gives the rod. Wiki needs to be updated.
---
I'm pretty sure it actually stops you from typing your password in public chat, at least it used to (the fact that this is possible would mean they're storing the passwords insecurely btw)
---
Emote clue
---
Lol. No idea is perfect, all have tradeoffs and downsides. Your idea had the considerably bad downside of affecting all legit new players, which is something Jagex just made a post about being a high priority issue for them. Making it harder to draw new players in is a really really bad tradeoff for something that still has notable weaknesses.
---
an emote clue https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Guide/Emote_clues
---
If you play so much that you can't go a few days without osrs then you probably have alts that you can use in the meantime
---
&gt;'Im not gonna show you, you can find it yourself hurrdurr. It exists trust me brooo'
---
i mean literally just google for a minute, don't be assheaded just to make an argument. and no, you cannot access anybody's steam account without verification - at all.
---
&gt;Yes he needs to, because the average human should realize that if he describes exactly how to hack accounts, he is also describing exactly how to protect them.
---
literally what are you trying to say with this? that he should know the intricacies of how to hack someone in order to set up proper account security? clearly not the case 
---
&gt;Of Course there is issues such as recover questions not being editable and not enough variables to identity owner. But its not "laughably" easy to hack accounts.
---
just for those reasons alone, you're contradicting what you've just said, in comparison to other popular services. 
---
jagex isn't an indie dev company and should take far more responsibility when it comes to user security than they currently choose to, especially when considering there's a far greater incentive to go for runescape accounts just because of the ease of selling its gp and in some cases also the account.
---
all that being said, if you take all the precautions, never get your dox leaked, properly 2fa and secure your emails and not reuse any of your passwords you should be fairly safe.
---
Panic emote
---
Ouch &amp; I thought my RNG was bad at Hydra. 1 Prayer and a big F for you my man :(
---
Imagine being this much of an elitist.
---
When it’s ready
---
ALL HAIL GOD ASH!!!!
---
So is it tied to the card or the account or is it both or am I just going crazy?
---
That's what I always wondered but I don't think the bots buy bonds cause they have so many of them and they can buy black market memberships for like 1 dollar or do the free trials
---
at this point they should start paying us for doing their work
---
Go to the al Khalid mine, and do the “panic” emote. 
---
Also, always remember  clues are going to be online too, you can google “OSRS(the clue)” and the answer will pop up.
---
D spear doesn't do massive damage.
---
SSN verification works when it's people from one country and the business is also from there handling them, but it gets VERY complicated if you want to make it global as every country have different laws and often quite strict about the use of SSN and probably outright illegal for foreign businesses to collect apart from maybe banking etc.
---
so basically any act of douchiness can be justified with "just playing the game bro"
---
Turn off your private chat
---
setting achievable goals. mixing it up. watching youtube/movies and shows/streamers while you play. take regular breaks to get up and do something else for a bit. all of this helps me stay focused.
---
hitting that milestone you set for yourself feels great. then you make a new milestone. and there are usually alternatives to grinds, like fast xp/expensive, vs slow but afk so you can multitask
---
Usually if you click login again, everything is okay. It happened to me once, might be a connection issues either on my side or Jagex's side
---
When people want to leave, just add an exit you have to click with a warning message, just like the Wildy ditch. Some people will still be getting lured, but some people never learn.
---
There's a certain bot farm that has "slut" in the begging of the bot's name.
---
The red pk skull was a glitch
---
Double kek
---
I did, he's hopping to every world and scanning for me.
---
You're delusional if you think they are doing nothing. It is an arms race, everything jagex does can be counteracted somehpw/eventually. 
---
See: the Bot Buke
---
Time killer too. So much exp wasted hanging out with her.
---
What a sad sad man.
---
Keep it up Chym!!!!  Been a supporter of yours for awhile!!!
---
They get banned, they make a new account.
---
I’m just offering some possibilities, I knew ssn wouldn’t fly hence the second part of the paragraph.
---
Like the new(ish) quest updates where if you have the items already you get a different dialogue. I really love shit like that.
---
I've used like 2 glories on the guy having to teleport out. He's just trying to waste my time.
---
I was on the fence but then you mentioned Naruto. I must be a part of this lol.
---
Yeah as I’m not exist, im not angry they got it just salty I didn’t lol, when you see people getting 1KC pets when you can’t play it’s rough
---
you're 99 cooking and instead of doing a novice quest like tai bwo wannai trio, you decided to do *more* cooking?
---
So a regular scimitar
---
This happened to me today. I just reloaded runelite and I logged in just fine.
---
Oh, I didn't know it could do that and Neitiznot (just looked at the wiki). I just remember it having a Waterbirth tele after the hard diary. Must have glossed over it because of noted DK bones. Thanks.
---
Not clicking that phishing link
---
It wouldn't tarnish my faith. I don't see you rioting in falador every time every account is forced off the game for an hour for maintenance and it'd be silly for you to do so because we all understand every time they do they're fixing and improving our game. this would be a similar situation. I have nothing to hide and would not get a hold on my account, and even if I was chosen to be quarantined for a few days on some super off chance, it would be such a worthwhile trade for those few days to be able to come back play without enourmous bot farms at every turn. If you're getting offended by somebody doing their job to try to make your play experience better then idk sounds like you got personal problems with keeping your emotions in check cause you only have to wait a day while a problem is fixed for the thousands of players. Tf you acting like it's so personal for?
---
You have no clue how bot farms start up. And it shows
---
I was so close to stop playing this game but jagex got me again.
---
one thing I love about Runelite is I can hit the rune altar from the fair ring on Karamja... The rune might be long, but I only have to click once to get there.
---
You think clan wars is located in Al Kharid in OSRS without a reason? It was placed there because people didn't want it in the wilderness for extremely obvious reasons. We've seen all the fuck ups jagex did in the past, and now people actually think it's a good idea to literally unfix content back into the shit we never wanted, that already most likely still exist in RS3. Call it elitism all you want, doesn't change the facts of the situation.
---
Farming
---
You’re a special kind of stupid if you think pugger even catches 1 percent as many bots as the auto detection system does lmfao
---
Purple lifes matter!
---
man why are you so angry, do your parents not love you or something? or is it that your almost 30 years old and never got your Willie wet by a girl?
---
So they just get a few more levels, which makes them avoid the flagging, and we're back to square one?
---
I used deliveritems, paid some dude 40k to kill him lol
---
Yeap, perfectly fine. You just need to do underground pass for Ibans staff. I personally recommend upgrading it for QoL reasons. So long as you have 43 prayer, you'll only go through maybe 1 prayer pot per trip.
---
I think a better idea for verification would be to send a blood and dna sample, along with a $5,000 refundable deposit for your account. Every 5 years you get $1,000 back, and if you are even slightly accused of botting then that money is not yours anymore. This would limit the accounts and decrease botting.
---
Sorry you're getting downvoted for being right, but dude has clearly been on his fair share of tren with delts looking like that.
---
Lair.
---
Back in real RS2 it was a Games Necklace tp right?

You monster

Version of this long dead game from 2007  (when \~2010 to when eoc landed was the peak) was brought back up just because a few individuals wanna rub their nostalgia boner.  
---
Talk about irony.
---
&gt; 3rd best imo
---
what are the 2 better ones?
---
Yeah, that’s why Corp cave is a tele on the games necklace
---
And agility
---
\&gt;Sick of the thing **weve** established youre wrong about?
---
When you're too dumb to read what you typed lmfao
---
Cute noob xD
---
You’re stalled during telegrab
---
There is an effort. They're getting banned. The dicing boots and friends just make new accounts again.
---
Ah of course, silly me
---
tbh most content in the game is made for people who play 15 hours a day...
---
You really think there's 500k+ players who wanna see CW moved to wild?
---
I usually collect 1k tokens at a time. Going to dragon defender varies for everyone. It's taken me 800 tokens before and on other accounts it's been 4k tokens
---
You’re downvoted for being right, and he’s upvoted for being wrong. The brainlets could just test it in 5 seconds but rather spread misinformation
---
got that ironman luck
---
As one grinding con right now, just hit 80, it’s absolutely wonderful. Just set up your various POH teleports and carry house teletabs, get anywhere in a second. That’s not counting even counting the stuff like gilded altar or pools, it’s definitely worth the investment.
---
This account is playing for hundreds of hours to get to this point. It can be flagged and put up for review by the anti cheat team. Which would take a mod less than 10 minutes of watching it’s activity to realize it’s botting. I don’t think it would cause an uproar in the community if someone’s extremely suspicious account got banned, because it could be reverted on the .01% chance it was a legit player who hasn’t left that chunk since it got the required hunter lvl
---
Lol I bet I’m in better shape then you/ physically look better, being on testosterone is fucking amazing 😉 just don’t wanna come off to have kids not yet at least, and looking at your posts your some hillbilly fuck who makes knifes in a toaster oven lmao, over in the trailer park bro
---
I technically had my max combat friend stake for me. 100m for the first stake. 150m second stake. 300m third stake. 500m fourth stake. Bought tbow. Never went back. Slaying the shit outta stuff. Happiness inevitable.
---
My displayname on reddit is the same as my displayname ingame. I'm in the top 500 ironmen. But I haven't been hacked yet. How come?
---
I will probably receive instant karma and get hacked just because of this LUL
---
Not a lot of people could afford a $5000 deposit. What about a $50 to buy the game and then monthly subscriptions (per account) on top of that?! And if you get banned you need to buy a whole new $50 “game code.” 
---
Not much but would definitely deter.
---
I'm sorry to tell you, you broke
---
still fletching
---
Sir Pugger: ... and that's when I discovered this underground bot farm
---
It is also giving League capsule (skins) , Crunchyroll premium (anime) , Starcraft II stuff
---
What do you mean exactly? You said go play rs3, when this was a thing LONG before rs3.  Quit embarassing yourself, clan wars being in the wild is pretty much as old school as gwd, it came out in like 2007
---
Yea just sucks the bot farmers can make those accounts back in a day.
---
How do you know GoT is OP's personality  then? Have you seen OP before? Is being angry your personality?
---
When pking was removed from the game.
---
Well, it doesn't have to be captcha i suppose. Just something in account creation or even tutorial island that's randomized and will slow them down
---
I currently raid in elite void and do Vorkath with it while I save up to afford my max gear. It serves its purpose.. and will always be BIS at Vorkath.
---
It aint gay if its in a (Rs)3 way
---
bring a chisel along, cut them and drop them
---
I was so surprised my brain wasn’t functioning well 😂
---
It would create a sort of hub in somewhat deep wilderness for people to gather and fight in multi, currently there's nothing else like that near multi. I don't know how much of an impact it would have these days but after the bh crater was removed that bank and clan wars were pretty active with random small teams on the pking worlds.
---
The Aurora Borealis.
---
How did this happen?
---
Luring isn't a problem.
---
At this time of year
---
It essentially means God Free or Without a God but I’m not 100%.
---
No it cannot.  
---
Average player in this game is more capable (in every single way, especially when it comes to programming) than average JaGeX employee.  
---
As evident by rampant bot problem and several clients, including botting ones, that are superior to official one in every single way.
---
My friends claim to have won because some shit meme post on FB that they won. I called bullshit, they still lost, i still lost and there is no way to win.
---
I did it with 40 att, 38 str and 39 def. No tele runes. You can do it too.
---
Go vote
---
I always wanted a 99 magic, and younger me was so impatient and not had much knowledge of training magic, and now I'm approaching 96 magic, the highesy skills I ever had it
---
I never said it should or should not be placed in the wilderness.  But the fact that you say a suggestion that was in fact in the game in 2007 belongs in rs3 is pretty stupid logic.  This is why you're being downvoted.  Are you really this dense lol.
---
Fruit stalls I think? Or black jacking maybe.
---
hes right though
---
Add me, do you have members?
---
“Aurora Borealis? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of Gielinor, localised entirely within Lumbridge kitchen?”
---
Mourners drop Mourner clothes. OP is looking for the Plague outfit from Sheep Herder. Mourners don't drop the Plague outfit.
---
No more splitting the communities. My ideal runescape is rs3 graphics + osrs combat + darkscape rules = perfect runescape.
---
it has an immense amount of content added to it since its initial launch we get game updates every thursday and frequently get polls that we vote on for future content aswell as dev streams every wednesday where we can voice suggestions for future updates. i would highly recommend playing again.
---
At this time of day
---
Found the emblem farmer. Too easy dude.
---
Localized entirely in your kitchen?
---
# Hey there fellow scapers!
---
It's your boy /u/suave_squirrel here to fill you all in on the deets to this joke.  Buckle your seat belts, it's about to get wild.
---
Let's start with some context here, /u/sl33k0n3 said, and I quote
---
&gt; Hot af
---
**_What in Gielinor is he going on about here scapers?!_**  Well, OP has posted a video of his supposed girlfriend's lack of reaction to Sea Shanty 2.  The catch is, she's attractive, which leads us to the previous comment.
---
You see folks, 'hot af' is hip speak for 'She is physically appealing', in reference to the gf of our little charade.  But then this comment section gets spun on its balls when /u/palboyy hits us with the punchline:
---
&gt; Turn your ac on bro
---
Woh what just happened!  Ignoring the cultural dialect discussed previously, our dude takes the comment at face value, interpreting that /u/sl33k0n3 's comment is referring to *the temperature of his environment*.  This, ladies and gentlemen, gives rise to the timeless staple of humor, irony.  And this, is why it is funny.
---
## Alright scapers it's been a good one.  Catch you all next time!
---
Lmao oh man. What a hilariously absurd thing to post about someone you don’t know. You’re the one trying to be some big man with your stupid guns. I’m college educated, don’t live in a trailer park, am not a hill billy, and just happen to have a hobby lol. Try reading a book for once instead of deep throating your guns.
---
just wiki it, haha
---
It could be an old password that was leaked, you don't need the current password to request an account recovery. just a password match that was on the account before. The more information you give the better the chance for it to go through.
---
May I see it?
---
47 - 8 = 42?
---
I see
---
Why, yes!
---
For me it was 99 fishing. Kinda weird to want but I was already really high in it already so it seemed like a more attainable goal. Even back then magic wasn't really my jam...I think it had something to do with me disliking runecrafting or some thing like that.
---
There was a 77amulet195 at kurasks for 7 days in a row

Where is the best place for me to kill lizardmen shamans on a slayer task. Looking for speed
---
Goals is the biggest one for me. Right now I'm trying to get fire cape and Morytania hard diaries done.
---
Just insta mute anyone who spams the same sentence over and over again.  Even if it's only for 1 hour it would all but kill dicing bots.
---
There's already another cannonball tier and they certainly ly should never be stronger.
---
The thing is I'm so determined to get this but every time I see a rune full helm I want to cry

Doing slayer would be your best bet. I get several hard clues a day just doing slayer tasks.

Because mining and bossing are comparable at all 🤔

Same reason why amulet or enteral glory is like 20m

At least on the bright side I'll leave the place with 400k  and the hope of never going back to the warrior guild ever again soon I hope.

I appealed my 10 year old account that got hacked and they just said “nope” and didn’t even give me a chance :/

That would eat into my margin thooooo 😩

The wiki says "You need to have talked to Vertida about the Rod of Ivandis otherwise Veliaf Hurtz won't give it to you.", have you tried that?
---
If they are a legit doubler, then your money will definitely be doubled.

2k Worlds are also some of the best for begging, I do it all the time there and it's legit 2-4 mil/hr .

Personally I would use session information instead, might be a good way to limit showing duplicate tips as well. Great work though, love the project!
---
Zulrah operates according to a few different cycles (which you can find all over the internet).  
---
Assuming you're properly geared/stats, it's about learning those rotations and being prepared for the next phase before it happens so that you can be in the right location.
---
Wonderful plan. Hope you dont get burnt out but I'm looking forward to seeing what you make.
---
Id marry her
---
It wont even be close. It will be super hyped at first but will die out quickly. Majority of people who have played wow post-wotlk and not pre wotlk will not like classic. There's so many aspects of classic wow QoL wise that are simply objectively un-fun. It's not the same as osrs&gt;rs3. Its the same game but the combat is extremely simplified and boring. bosses are extremely easy mechanically. It's not even the grinding that breaks it, but the end game is just really lackluster especially with all the game knowledge the average player has today, let alone the hardcore players.   
---
Classic wow wont even have 1/10th of the playerbase that retail has after the first 3 months.
---
Yeah that's this subs specialty.
---
Your Grandpa.
---
That is the one they didn't do because they thought it would be a quick job but required much more time.
---
This is the point everyone misses. Having safe zones in multi creates a sense of security that creates a pking hotspot that is easily accessible to the masses.
---
GenerateTask on YouTube created a spreadsheet that can randomize 'tasks' based on the Collection Log for his series and released it here  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJK\_ZS66u\_R48gJmsRQ2Qt-wxki7Nr3Dn9g8qLLQadU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJK_ZS66u_R48gJmsRQ2Qt-wxki7Nr3Dn9g8qLLQadU/edit?usp=sharing). I've done a few now and it's been a fun switch-up from the same grinds over and over, even just on my account and not creating a new one for it or anything.

It’s clearly, to most anyways, just a joke because everyone is hyped for new vid.
---
Then why did they poll it?
---
This isn’t constructive feedback, this is the ramblings of somebody entitled. His points aren’t even valid yet he still complains
---
Sounds like a really fancy explanation for just a Venezuelan clicking squares for hundreds of hours
---
Yeah I'm sure putting eggs into one basket is totally not the thing that increases the risk.
---
Good stuff, what’s the plug-in for your prayer? Is it for one tick flicking?
---
Remove yourself from this game instead.
---
Just get a house

Can you link the poll? Looked through them and don't see it as polled.

Begging is hit or miss. As a professional GE begger I have amassed multiple 1m+ in one donation, in fact I have more 1m+ donations than troll ones. I won’t ruin my money maker though.

NMZ is considered cheating , you should train your combat stats elsewhere.
---
Mystics lvl 40 mage gear, black dhide lvl 70 range gear, start risking if you dont wanna splash

Perhaps they were talking about swapping gold via a third party website which requires paying over 50% extra just to get it transferred and can also result in being scammed
---
What the hell?  No wonder people view conservatives so badly, you give them a terrible name by calling anyone with any basic decency a 'SJW'.  
---
This person isn't being a 'SJW' at all, they're just letting OP know that this is actually seems discourteous and uncomfortable for their girlfriend, and they're exactly right.
---
I verily hope they'll make an exception, it only a couple of hundred experience when you think about it haha. Hmmm
---
That offer will never go through, try offering 6969gp
---
I said this in the other comment as well - If i was worried about losing a valued item, I wouldn’t have posted it. I’ve made plenty of money off of it since i found it. Hopefully someone else can make something from it. 
---
With that’s said though, I’ve got a lot more than just that.

Eating my employee meal at chipotle

Black mask does the same thing

It kinda sucks that you can’t PK unless you’re a pure. It feels like something you just get fucked unless you grind one ability
---
They were talking about using the bonds for membership. OP wants to use bond transfer as a way to safely transfer actual wealth from rs3 to osrs.
---
I agree, the hype and subs will depend on how blizzard executes content updates later. I wouldn't see why it couldn't phase into tbc, which is loved almost as much as classic.
---
Is it possible to grow this flower?
---
Ohhhhhh. I see. I misread that then thanks for the clarity.
---
I'm all for deliberately unfunny 'dad-jokes' and inside-jokes that are humorous for, I guess, 'ironic purposes', but this just seems obnoxious and bothersome, and without a punchline.    
---
Like...if you were on a boat, or holding a bottled ship model, or something, maybe?  But why are you just randomly holding a candle and deliberately, annoyingly interrupting your girlfriend's work with a silly song?  
---
Not to put you down so much, but...might want to ease up on the manchild gag a little bit.  She seems genuinely disgusted.
---
Lock accounts behind social security si when you are caught botting, your social is banned. /s
---
Lol woops meant Iban’s staff
---
Both
---
You can stick it up your own, asshole
---
???
---
Sparc Mac wants to know your location...
---
Excuse me sir, I am a murderhobo. I never sleep, there are npcs to kill.
---
I second this. Happened to me, was unable to log in on my PC.... stupid.... logged into mobile fine... tried PC again..... worked. Thanks JaGeX
---
Hey spoiler tag please
---
I remember being scared not knowing wilderness PVP was removed and I would run there and hide in the middle of the crowd waiting for the violence to start.
---
Haha, thanks. I try to console myself by remembering that the standard drop table is still great money, but the 2 "missing" claws still sting.
---
/just casually walking around Karamja with 79mil
---
Hmm, I haven't really looked into using blender for making 3D printing ready assets yet, I *think* there's some extra steps involved in actually preparing the models for that purpose..
---
As for modelling with blender in general, have you given a look at some of the guides on Youtube? Some such as the beginner series by Blenderguru are very handy for getting started. [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYj6e-72RDs&amp;list=PLjEaoINr3zgHs8uzT3yqe4iHGfkCmMJ0P&amp;index=2) for the playlist in question if you're interested.  
---
There's also the good folks over at r/blender should you have questions about anything!
---
thats the entire point of wild slayer bro.
---
Nah it's way better to let xp accumulate and see how you did
---
Expensive
---
Seems like you just answered your own question there bud
---
Thank you! Yeah I meant Iban’s Staff, been playing Dark Souls lately lol
---
What about the fact that they’re fucking green?
---
Had a look before but happened to be just as blender had the big update, I'll take another look. Thankyou!
---
Fally West Bank, should probably include this lol.
---
Good call, thanks for the heads up
---
Whats your slayer lvl on main? Honestly dude I find that demonic gorillas are my fav task. Extend black demons if you got the points, because a 200+ task of demonic gorillas will net you 4-5m even without a zenyte drop. And zenytes are 1/300 drop rate too. They are fantastic money, easy to kill and easy to figure out how to do properly. 
---
You just need to do mm2 to have access. You can kill them with subpar stats too. I recommend at least 80 range and 80 str though. Use arclight if youre lower str/attack because they are weak to arclight, and it does crazy damage and accuracy.
---
goals.
---
sorry meant to post this in ironman subreddit
---
Honestly there are heaps of ways to bring cash into your account as a pure! 
---
Cannon green drags in rev caves with looting bag is still 900k gp/ph. 
---
Lava drags is also decent.
---
Farming contracts/bird houses and growing hops is really good passive gp which i did while lvling slayer.
---
Yeah. It took less then ten minutes to discover this person is a bot, and we don't have the access jagex has.
---
You are the one using circular logic, not me. You admit there is a big enough bot problem that jagex would need someone full time to take care of them, but at the same time your claiming jagex does enough.
---
Try to read the persons’s messages you are arguing with once in awhile, you might find out you are actually agreeing with each other.
---
NOT FROM THE FARMERS
---
Because it's poop gp and poop xp
---
I love that this follows the cadence of the original line perfectly
---
Really feel like Corp should be on the combat bracelet instead of a level 8 enchantment made for *games*
---
Just DM Pugger. I’m sure he’ll figure out a way to lure the bot into a PvP world or something.
---
At the mine now
---
Yeah but the amulet of eternal glory is actually used for runecrafting/essence running
---
do you not have access to a computer?
---
Someone tag him lol, there are like 40 of us here hanging out.
---
Even less afk if you stay at full hp with different armour and do nmz on easy. Only around 75k-80k xp/hr though.
---
max you can get I think if you are absolutely perfect/lucky is like 220
---
yep 3 mining pets 1 fishing pet 2 runecraft pets
---
Yes, it did.  'Modern' runescape, i.e. original runescape, which is now RS3, is the same game that attempted the Clan Wars in the Wildy idea.  RS3 is its re-branded name, but it is the same game, the same timeline of updates.  They tried it.  It failed there.  The point stands; there's no point emulating that failure in OSRS.
---
Can you create an API? I would like to make a script for my desktop that shows me random fact every 10 minutes or so. Would be nice.
---
I'll have to dig a bit more then. Sorry not at the computer atm.
---
I really doubt that. Top classic streamer on Twitch right now (Asmongold) has 70k viewers. Sodapoppin is a massive classic fan and streamer too and gets similar viewer numbers. On top of that, Lirik and Shroud (and plenty more massive streamers) have both said they plan on playing a very significant amount when it releases fully.
---
Obviously Twitch isn't a full representation of how well the game will do, but it's usually good enough to make a pretty reasonable estimate. If the Classic WoW team plays their cards right, the game can be much bigger than osrs. Although it could also die within a year after the hype dies down, just gotta wait and see. Although the private servers are all still doing well enough, so I doubt it will die.
---
Probably just thought thats what the cooked version looks like.
---
Well not minor but it wasn't major. What was that fighter torso thing?
---
That's the joke
---
Rune drags are not that afk, you've gotta watch you health as they hit hard and frequently
---
Oh ho ho no, patented Swampletic burgers, old family recipe.
---
You're still missing the point. Jagex might've done fuck ups in the past, but the location of clan wars was never a 'fuck up' to begin with.
---
the bigger the bag the shorter the life... so you only get like 10 uses out of the giant bag, but like 40 out of the medium one. really annoying if you don't have contact NPC.
---
I went to grab my diary reward and I saw the impling, I teled to a bank and noticed I had no butterfly net in my bank, I took my gp and teled to yanille and bought the net and then used a brimhaven teleport and ran back to the impling. I thought it was gone when I returned but it flew to the volcano and I clicked on the impling, didn't catch it because I forgot to wear the net. Equipped it and first try I caught it. I just waited for like 10 seconds and then clicked the jar and got an ornament kit. I literally flew out of my chair at that point.
---
What a silly way of misinterpreting the meaning of 'originally'. No, it wasn't in the wilderness the day the wildy was added in 2001, along with most of the entire wilderness we know today - But CW's original location *was* in the wilderness. You can argue whether or not that was a good thing, but regardless the wildy was the original location.
---
I'm not saying they need to make pure-focused content (although I appreciate them acknowledging them in updates, instead of listening to all the hateful mains who resent anyone who plays in a unique way), I'm just saying that pures are at least as legitimate as ironmen.  They don't have built-in support, but they've existed since the ancient days of Runescape and played a major, formative role in the game's PvP aspect.
---
Bobs dead :(
---
Uh. The fremmy boots already give unlimited teleports to rellenka after the elite diary. You'll end up unlocking this before you pay the fish cost. 
---
Also who doesn't have a Waterbirtb teleport in their POH?
---
Talk about dead content.
---
Im sorry little one...
---
thanks brodda
---
The simplicity of the JSON files makes an API (probably) unnecessary. Would it be hard for you to cURL the JSON file from GitHub directly and pick a random one from it? It's a simple JSON array and should have support in most languages. Do you use AutoHotKey?
---
because he has no life?

Some people took the pokemon theme song very seriously as kids and it stuck with them I guess

I mean it's pretty low priority, I'm fine with it not coming out at the ass crack of dawn
---
But how do we get our raw turtles and mantas? Am I going to have to grind out fishing trawler?
---
north, zoom out far, minimize chatbar (resizeable)
---
Nope, rs2 is what had this. Do you even know when the update happened? RS3 has nothing to  do with this. Im done here...
---
I got the dragon defender now if anyone was wondering
---
I still haven't seen how this is a net positive for the game, aside from tickling peoples' nostalgia bone.  It trivializes the intended danger and vast emptiness of the wilderness.
---
I just got it, it was worth it to not give up
---
lmao you probably shouldn't have your clan members come upvote your thread and leave positive comments when trying to promote it. Not a good look
---
?? This is literally a picture of clan wars
---
I noticed after like 3 invs because I notice the XX wasn’t as much as I thought it would be lol
---
can someone compile these?
---
Grate my man, chuck another 2k tokens at it to have a back up if you ever lose it so you never gotta go back haha
---
3rd age pickaxe though for the ultimate max setup.
---
Odd, I constantly see it relatively high on the wiki's moneymaking guide, always in the 2mil/hr range. Doesn't seem too bad to me.
---
Which you have already provided in 2 other comments.
---
Thank you!!
---
Don’t blanket statement me like that bro. I vote yes to pvp polls!
---
Because I'm a bitch
---
I would hate to ruin my afk cooking experience!  It's one of the highlights of the game!  /s
---
yeah except is like 9m/hr for runners
---
Don't think so. Best way is to price check all your supplies before and after the runs, then subtract that from your drops.
---
I was probably overly harsh with my critique, but really.  I get cute jokes, but this one doesn't come across as clever or taken in good humor.  She seems genuinely disgusted, or at least annoyed, and the subreddit seems eager to re-interpret it as *"cmon man she wants it even if she seems visibly disgusted it's normal."*
---
one person cant realisticaly deal with 30k+ bots per day, that person would need to be able to investigate, make proper judgment and ban the account in 3 seconds doing it for 24 hours.

(raw bass, don't tell)

You know this entire post is fucking satire right? Get off your fucking high horse you neckbeard.
---
Diary/music cape into max cape
---
by not having a social/love life
---
Prioritize prayer switch &gt; movement &gt; heal &gt; gear switch.
---
Remove free membership options until they can be limited then there is a cost to bit with several employees manually banning bots. Effectively increasing the price of buying gold compared to bond price. Jagex makes more than enough from the bans to pay those employees salaries even if they have no tools and are manualy banning
---
Series finale, shows over after this.
---
The higher your herblore, you get less cheap herbs.  After 77 herblore, you can get rotator. I’m currently waiting 90 and don’t get marrentil or tarromin at all
---
throwback to when that guy tried to release one page per day for upvotes
---
Gl, I just finished 1600 yesterday. Best I got was some new foot gear worth 4.5mil
---
I only have three/four switches right now - I switch chest/legs, and blowpipe or trident + book of darkness.
---
I'm hesitant to do the "log out if you don't get one specific rotation" method - for one thing, long term I want to be able to farm for profit. But also, considering I don't even think my safespots are right, I don't think rotations are my biggest issue. I've watched a bunch of the guides, but I still don't get what I'm doing wrong besides not putting out enough damage. I can't tell how they're following the guide accurately and I'm not.
---
I'm being lectured by the 2007scape reddit on why OP's girlfriend's visible annoyance and disgust is actual normal and "she wants it," while simultaneously being accused of never having had a girlfriend.  
---
I get cute antics.  This one just doesn't seem particularly clever or cute -- she seems visibly aggravated.
---
I don't think you can, sorry. On the plus side, if you get a twitch prime trial (or have Amazon prime) and redeem the promotion for runescape, you get a free month of membership.
---
No pures bitch about dhide so don’t change the chaps to spite pures
---
Oh shit he's been botting? Wonder how long for. I've seen him multiple times at myth guild
---
Damn he's gone
---
So it was a ploy all along
---
🙌 preach 🙌   Yasss👏👏👏
---
Maybe he was also smithing?
---
We don’t get it
---
I botted 30m RC and never got banned.
---
I've never seen someone with RNG in their username that wasn't a dicing bot
---
You can catch me in the wildy how bout dat 😂 
---
For real tho I know you are lonely and full of hate from when your uncle touched you but you shouldn’t spread that toxicity to others just because you are in pain. Get help bro
---
Because the goal is not to get thieving bots banned. They can do that very easily. The goal is to ban all accounts that a particular botter is using, primarily the aggregate account where the wealth is being transferred and stored. Keeping throwaway bots in the game helps pinpoint where the bottled wealth is going, and more importantly, helps keep jagex's anti cheat methods secure. If jagex instantly banned every bot the second they found them, it would be very easy for botters to work around the anti cheat
---
Kirl is way too high in that list lol
---
Only thing I wouldn’t do on mobile is solo boss or PK, everything else it’s very smooth
---
Yikes
---
No, runescape 3 is the horrible thing and update that ruined the game. That wasnt something part of fucking rs3 holyshit stop trying
---
3 day mute incoming!
---
No there was no ploy, I made a mistake and it was funny, so I posted it.
---
Not with those herb and con stats..
---
My issue is that I dont have a lot of time to do non afk stuff on the pc, afk stuff I can do on my phone while doing chores or something. Theres a lot that id still like to do like trying Zulrah, and RC has to compete with that for my time. Im pushing hard to try to get to 77 so its more afkable. Currently level 72 and have like 12 more hours of almost constant clicking. But maybe ill try listening to music for when I am doing it.
---
9m is because nobody cares to run it, not because it's so good.
---
Someone will eventually make a bot farm run for legit players at 1m each.
---
:3 I know right XD

This is suprisingly true

Tell that to your hundreds of karmas
---
Honestly will take a bit of grinding but if you safe spot every Slayer task you could end up profiting in the long run when the tasks get good
---
Didn’t they roll back because the update was bugged at first? The bug is now been fixed for ages, you gained your level due to a mistake you made, not the devs
---
Now get mole
---
Sucks for him, going to get a solid 2 day ban
---
&gt; Which part of smithing is hard?
---
For me it's just the lack-of benefits of it up until the higher levels. At the least, I think I need level 54 just for an Ardy medium task
---
An oldie but a goldie
---
Nonono, see it's called defence. You don't kill stuff to level defence. You let stuff kill you to level defence, try it!
---
I'm guessing they're on RS3
---
Happened to me like an hour ago, just had connection on your part
---
Theres alot to it, that was left out for the sake of time. And yes the market goes up and down 5 percent so im aware of that difference, but these are also way more likly to increase in higher markets than the adamaent 2 h swords because of such small price.
---
Why is that relevant at all? WoW is a bigger game that OSRS. 
---
But regardless, if you want to compare BFA release to classic, at least wait for classic to release.
---
I think they replied once, that they weren't able to find the bug. While I haven't tested it myself I'm still saving my Attas seeds.
---
Make a reddit post, get upvotes, the get Jmod smack down
---
How did you get your interface like that?
---
Sorry that people enjoyed my first post on Reddit, I’ll just quit posting stuff so your not butthurt.
---
...What? LOL You seem desperate for something buddy
---
Jagex doesn’t give a fuck cause they want the money of one dude owning so many accounts. They just ban enough to pretend like they care. If they banned ALL the bots they would lose so much revenue.
---
i think it's that he's using a whip in arma which has negative melee stats
---
Is it really a gold sink though? Money is just transferred to another player, it doesn’t “leave the world” like buying stuff from a vendor does.
---
Appreciate it
---
Would add a hitspot pking in Wildy I’m for it
---
Wow thats terrible haha. Now i dont have any doubt, classic will be a lot bigger than bfa.
---
I honestly don't know if WoW has more player online then OSRS because they don't show it.
---
does wow has more subscription then RuneScape ? Sure 1,7m last time I check
---
Only placed him that high because I dolo GWD, and it's a lot more enjoyable being able to do an entire Greater Demon task in one trip than getting melted in a solo for a few kills per trip. I don't recommend camping Kril without an alt if you're really trying to grind out a lot of kills.
---
Is that some quest dialog?
---
LOL. W0T
---
Do I get 83 or 84 construction? Thanks in advance.

Also congratulations 😊

(when i say budget for augury and rigour i also meant to factor in for the bones you need to get  to whatever prayer level you want)
---
you can def start farming zulrah at those stats, just get your range up to 75 and you're golden. i'd say grab void if you haven't already and start learning. around 100k a kill at 4ish minutes per kill is a pretty penny, and 4 minutes is what you can expect while learning with welfare gear -- it only gets faster as you get better
---
Get a password manager and use a different, secure password for everything you have.
---
That's like verbatim what people said about osrs. I almost thought it was a copy pasta from osrs release
---
Clan Wars s dead because there is basically no reason to use it. If clans want to fight, they just do it in the wildy and for safe fights, you can just 1v1 in the duel arena. It just leaves clan wars as pretty redundant.
---
Did he do twisted bow and lance?
---
It's useful for people that don't have Fremmy elites done
---
Plot twist: she’s deaf and didn’t hear any of it.
---
I did this too. Can I have 2m anon? :D
---
Fuck I'm dumb, thanks
---
oh shit didn’t even realize, thanks mate.
---
Only joking xD I’ve got plenty
---
I’d get off my throne of salt to comment in a rage but I’ll pass and add more to my seat. 😩
---
he did tbow I'm pretty sure, but the video's too old to have done lance
---
Holy shit they’re dope, dude! You should set up a shop n sell em for $$$$
---
It’s already been leaked so yeah
---
the sgs doesnt have a lot of use generally. people mostly use overheads / burst for slaying. wheres it really used? solo zammy, demonic gorillas, random melee slay tasks if you arent using overheads? inferno? it's not useless but it's not super useful.
---
I think it just doesn't have much uses for high lvl accounts atm. And as the game ages high lvl accounts become more common. So yeah supply/demand. There's very few uses I can think of for it that are actually very good and worth the price tag. For general Slayer at max combat u can do most tasks on and inv of food or with prayers on. For most bosses, flat out DPS, or debuffing their defense is more desirable the sustain offed by the sgs. I have one and rly only use I get out of it now a days is at cerb and even then I think I should be bringing d claws instead. I think it's only true good use is in the inferno and that's a temporary grind that only a small percent of the player base is working on at any given moment. 
---
That's my thoughts at least.
---
Get high level combat. Then start worrying about money.
---
Sweet, thanks!

I could care less about clan wars I don’t use it.
---
Can we petition for the elysians model to be changed to this?
---
One of the things I thought was interesting about swamplectics videos was his slight manipulation of random events. Iirc they are sort of on a timer, but also depend on your activity/xp gains. It was kind of interesting, and I feel like this is probably a demonstration of their predictability to some degree.
---
I think that ones the quest where you collect the color beads
---
Its kinda like wanting to take more damage at a boss so you dont have to juggle supplies
---
teach him to lookout for phishing emails, streams, etc. have him search for database leaks for his email and rs acc info (haveibeenpwned is a good site for this)
---
3D model? C4D?
---
Yeah I currently have full void melee &amp; range helm this is my current bank ( https://imgur.com/GjgICSr) + 17m ish in cash
---
Yes I remember that one too! Doesn't the wizard just accuse you of stealing them if you have them before the start? Cause that's pretty funny
---
I believe you :)
---
Tbh i don't think the rdt droprates are 100% accurate, many people getting those drops nothing very special, but congrats :)

Any good ways to level up?

It's mostly probably a java based account checker, it logs in, checks the bank value and then logs out.

those items are about as useful as an osrs rune 2h sword and a green d'hide body
---
I use my SGS all the time during slayer. I run preserve with super attack/strength pots and the prayer restore and health just make trips easier with less banking. I still have Guthans for tasks that I can't tank as much but overall I love the SGS.
---
You have to account they are buying gold so it’s not 2.4k profit.
---
Pump and dump dude

This sub needs more guy’s feet.

Well I went ahead and completed the quest by finding a different combination of shapes. I'm also not sure what a screenshot could provide in terms of information.

Just look what supplies you use and subtract that from your loot tracker

Shes trying her best

I remember this how I lost my robin set back in 2006 . Some dudes invited me to their house and we were boxing in the ring and then I got left at 2 hp and he asked me to cook karambwan outside in the rimmy cooking range so I can heal back up and my dumb ass did and I ate it and died . I was so sad . Smh lol
---
You'll regret that comment in a few days..
---
Drakes are a super shit task, but it’s tolerable if you have a lance

I said not saying that. Just plainly begging for money.

You're not wrong haha

Nigga you gay

Even if you not a troll, how do you not realize this is the stupidest shit ever. You’re setting up idiots to get scammed after having their 10-50k doubled.
---
Ive said before that bot and RWT detection is so lax that I'm sure some Jagex employees are getting kickbacks
---
Probably engine work.
---
No

Spoilers

I still think it's a fucked up seedy thing to do. A person wearing max cash begging is like.. implying you'll get rewarded for being generous. 
---
It seems seedy/scammy to me.

Reading is hard, sorry lol.

If you're literally just asking for money, then you aren't breaking any rules.
