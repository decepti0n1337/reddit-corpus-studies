Check out astonishing legends,  they usually talk about some paranormal things if you're into that kinda stuff

---
---
It’s not loading for me. Can someone post a transcript please?
---

---
Also why was this tweeted? Is there an official blog post?
---
I'm so happy I sold 6b+ worth of items like 2 weeks ago. Only left like 300m worth of gear if I want to play
---
rather see this than "omg iv been playing for 15 years and i finally learnt how to prayer switch and killed jad!!"
---
Thanks for the info.
---
😬
---
Just reading this doc makes me excited for warding. I would love to be there when a new skill gets released. Everything sounds great to me.
---
You are going make nature tiaras for rc xp, right? Damn I didn't even know they had a rc requirement
---
Yeah, the mentally handicapped
---
No, the point of the post was exactly that, that I might draw NSFW.  
---
I had a patreon before I became a cripple and taking on any serious work or responsibility became too much.
---
Aww
---
Looks like I’m gonna get full graceful after all.
---
What do you mean scale the screen lol? You zoom in and out, it's that simple :P
---
With a 4slot pouch and these runes, you can cast everything in the game from one inventory slot. With a mage cape, you have every spell in the game at your fingertips. This removes the necessity of ever planning for anything. It's easyscape.
---
Better not be a diarrhea cape.
---
It feels like this is inevitable at this point, but I really hope there is a chance this whole thing can still be scrapped.
---
I have played since classic, EoC made me quit.
---
This to me "feels" so wrong. 
---
This is the beginning of the end of old school if you release this skill.
---
Looking at RS3 it's easy to see that one of the big problems is the large amount of items. There are literally 10 versions of the same item. There is just too much shit. We do not need that in this game.
---
Should've been a Rank 11 XYZ, don't you think?
---
Tekton, P2 verzik, Vorkath "wooxwalking", Cerberus ghosts require prayer switching 1 tick in between each other, Solo Olm, to name a few.
---
Said beautifully.
---
tru and then they can disable trading to stop essence/warding running at the other altars
---
I went for 52 for smite which isnt uncommon. I unfortunately wasnt thinking and trained it straight to 52 before doing all the quests so ill end up at 53 once its all said and done. Thankfully though it wont result in a combat level, so itll just look retarded.
---
Except I didn’t go through your comment history? It’s literally all in one thread.
---
It’s not worth going for
---
Its already incredibly strong and not very expensive. Dont think it needs any buffs.
---
I agree its going to be pain in the ass for balancing. However current state of safe pvm is not very old school. Back in old old days, people planned a lot about their gear so they wouldn't lose so much. e.g. I remember people being afraid of taking fire cape to bandos \o/. If you can't afford to lose some item don't risk it. PVM needs to have some risk.
---
But from ironman point of view I agree, some way of repairing is needed e.g. d warhammer so you don't have to farm two of them.
---
I just wanna add like 100 cannon balls at once. So Slayer is faster
---
Im not even mad
---
In CoX people already bring enough Venges to Venge the whole team for rooms that matter like Tekton and Vasa, and themselves on rooms where it's useful like Vangs, Rope, Mutta, etc.
---
In ToB Spec Transfer does nothing, everyone already brings the spec weapons they need, Pot share is useless too because of Divine pots now, only thing that might matter is having 2 more Venges to shave off maybe a few seconds to a minute.
---
New April fools skillcape coming 2020
---
60-63 are some of the worst waves, my best advice is to identify your spawn asap.
---
if mage and ranged are stacked you need to lure the blobs asap, either use the space to the north, or the west pillar to try and get them in range.
---
try as much as you can to corner either the blob or the mele while you kill the bats and the non-lured minion
---
after these are disposed of if range is in the back flick rigour and try to kill it ASAP, then deal with mage spawns one at a time as they come back
---
if mage is in the back, just deal with it asap and finish healing off of the ranger. 
---
If mage/range are not stacked, identify which side the blob will be on and if you can corner the mele. 
---
first priority should be luring all and moving to side where blob is not on you.
---
then clear up any bats that might be in range and if you can freeze mele
---
easiest way to deal with mele in this case is to wait for it to teleport, then freeze and walk out of range/flick it 
---
once you have taken care of the mele and bats, you should have one side where there is a ranger, and one with a mager, with blob behind one of them. 
---
 worst case scenario is blob is behind mager, in this case you need to kill the ranger, healing as much as possible, then based on your preference you can kill either the mage or blob. Id prefer killing the mage because anything the mage spawns in will then allow you to safely deal with the mage/blob one at a time. 
---
if you panic, and want to run to south pillar, make sure that you tic eat the ranger while you move, as you can just get one hit if you do not(assuming mele snipes you)
---
for 60-63, i personally just use my prayer and forget about flicking for a bit
---
Just a side note, 
---
I am assuming you hit the niblers and do some suitable form of damage, so long as your pillars will last for a few more waves, they can take a bit of damage while you deal with the spawn you get. 
---
if you completely splash, decide if it is safe, if so, just go and do one more hit on em, but don't keep peeking out to try and hit them, that's how damage stacks up. 
---
wait a bit and heal off of barrage before you go for another, or take care of one of the hard hitting threats before going back for them.
---
-hope this helped
---
Maybe the teams should all be cross trained on basic game maintenance, like banning bots and making sure it doesn't take 30 seconds to log in or hop worlds

---
Aims
---
Design
---
The main design aims for Warding are as follows:
---
●	Fill the gap for magic armour creation
---
●	Create a way to recycle junk/unneeded equipment to sink items from the game
---
●	Improve the viability of magic combat
---
●	Turn splashing into a gathering mechanic
---
●	Find a more fitting home for the imbues on the NMZ store
---
Should the skill be F2P?
---
Within this document, it is outlined how this skill could also work within a F2P environment. However, there is a reasonable question on whether this should be the case.
---
Pros
---
●	Smithing &amp; Crafting are F2P skills, this being the magic counterpart to those skills.
---
o	Counterpoint: Fletching is P2P while Runecraft is F2P.
---
●	F2P Magic is underpowered compared to Range &amp; Melee.
---
o	Counterpoint: At low levels it’s VERY strong.
---
●	They get an update for free.
---
o	Counterpoint: They don’t have a choice.
---
Cons
---
●	They have no say on whether they want it or not.
---
o	Counterpoint: This hasn’t stopped F2P updates before.
---
●	The robes they’ll be able to make is very limited, so what’s the point?
---
o	Counterpoint: So are the options for Crafting armours (Hard leather body is 1 Range).
---
o	Counterpoint: If this is the case, and the effect is marginal, what’s the problem?
---
●	The free game is arguably a time capsule of the original version of OSRS.
---
o	Counterpoint: It isn’t... The Chronicle, Beginner clues, Corsair cove &amp; Maple trees etc.
---
The main point here seems to be the destruction of a memorable and unchanged aspect of the game that would stop returning players feeling that classic sense of nostalgia. The changes we’ve made to the F2P game so far don’t detract from this as most returning players are unlikely to remember the F2P game perfectly, especially if they played beyond 2007.
---
Skill overview
---
What is the skill in a nutshell?
---
Warding is a production skill that allows players to create various types of magical items, equipment and tools that will aid the player in combat.
---
If you had 4 lines, how would you explain this to a player?
---
Warding is a fiercely old-school production skill in which players can create new and old magic armours, ward equipment to make them stronger and create powerful buffs to Old School's mages to share and devastate their foes. Harnessing the power of runestones, catching a wide variety of moths and dissolving old, unneeded equipment are some of the steps to make you a master of Warding.
---
Core skill
---
How are the players training the skill?
---
Warding XP is gained in a few ways: drawing wards, channeling vis into equipment and dissolving equipment into vis. Drawing a ward and dissolving equipment will only give token XP while the process of warding equipment will give a substantial amount and is the fastest method to train Warding.
---
Step 1: Gather items
---
Warding requires a few items to begin:
---
●	Tool: A channeling lamp
---
●	Resource: Elemental vis
---
●	Resource: Material (can be various types of fabrics, barks, leathers and metals)
---
Step 2: Locate a ward
---
Wards can be created within the world by left-clicking on some vis (this requires X vis to do so) while stood outside; wards function much like fires do – players may use each other's as they please. An alternative to drawing your own ward would be to locate a Runestone Monolith as they have permanent wards carved around them.
---
Note: Runestone Monoliths may or may not be part of the final iteration of the skill.
---
Step 3: Channel equipment
---
Interacting with a ward will open a UI asking the player to select which piece of equipment they’d like to channel based on the items in their inventory. Once a piece of equipment has been selected, the player will begin to create as many as possible unless specified otherwise. Each piece of equipment rewards the player with a chunk of experience.
---
Channeling Lamp
---
A channeling lamp is used for channeling vis through a ward and into materials to create magically imbued equipment. The warders trusty channeling lamp can be purchased from any rune or ward shop for a few gold pieces. Channeling lamps can be used to store any vis the player has gathered; the higher the players Warding level, the more vis a lamp can store. To use a channeling lamp, it must be equipped in the off-hand slot; interacting with a ward isn’t possible without a channeling lamp. When vis is gathered, providing your lamp can store that type of vis, it is automatically placed within the lamp.

We don’t need gold sinks as much as we need item sinks. Items literally don’t leave the game anymore, duel arena and other instances take a lot of gold out.

Clue Scrolls are the way to go for $$$, 6th medium clue and got me rangers
---
Vis
---
Vis is a waxy substance that is generated by a channeling lamp when runes are consumed or when magical items are dissolved on a ward. Vis is integral when creating equipment with the Warding skill, however, there are ways to reduce the amount of vis needed when warding robes and armours by pairing the specific ward with the required vis. For instance, if the robes being created require air vis, using an air ward will reduce the amount needed by 25%.
---
Vis comes in 5 varieties, 1 for each base element and a final rarer variety that functions as all elements. The varieties are as such: 
---
●	Air vis
---
●	Water vis
---
●	Earth vis
---
●	Fire vis
---
●	Omni vis
---
 *Splashing doesn’t necessarily mean failing to cast a spell, this is just the common terminology for this method of training.
---
Vis can be gathered by either casting elemental combat spells upon a monolith/rune altar or dissolving items on a ward. The stronger the spell and the higher a player's magic bonus, the rate at which vis is gathered increases. The vis gained from performing spells depends on the type of spell. For instance, casting water spells will reward the player with a mixture of air and water vis.
---
Slowest rate: Magic accuracy below 0 while casting strike spells.
---
Fastest rate: Magic accuracy above 30 while casting surge spells.
---
Nature idols
---
Around the world, a new range of items can be found known as nature idols. These items only use is to be dissolved into vis. They can be obtained as drops from monsters, exchanged with shops and found rarely while skilling.
---
●	Sky idol – dissolved for air vis
---
●	River idol – dissolved for water vis
---
●	Rock idol – dissolved for earth vis
---
●	Burnt idol – dissolved for fire vis
---
Recycling
---
Dissolving, Unpicking and Re-forging
---
To bring use to other production skills, the concept of dissolving has been split into three sections: Dissolving, unpicking and re-forging; each of these is tied with the relevant skill: Magic, crafting and smithing respectively. These processes require a specific level to perform that is based on the level required for that specific resource. For instance, unpicking black dragonhide equipment would require 79 Crafting while re-forging adamant equipment would require 70 Smithing. Unpicking only requires a needle while dissolving and re-forging requires a ward or furnace respectively.
---
Dissolving
---
To dissolve magical equipment, simply use it on a ward to begin the process. Dissolving nearby a runestone monolith provides more vis. The vis received from dissolving is also boosted by using a ward of the same type; for instance, dissolving items that output fire vis upon a fire ward will greatly increase the amount of fire vis received. As different items output a range of different types of vis, careful planning should be taken if players wish to dissolve in the most efficient manner. Like how noted items can be turned into gold via alchemy, noted items can also be dissolved; this should help make the task far less tedious.
---
●	Requires a specific Warding level
---
●	Inputs: Magical equipment 
---
●	Outputs: silk scrap &amp; elemental vis
---
New Arceuus spell: Dissolution
---
Magically dissolves any relevant item that can normally be dissolved via Wards into silk scraps/vis.
---
Unpicking
---
To unpick leather equipment, simply use a needle on the item you wish to unpick.
---
●	Requires a specific Crafting level
---
●	Inputs: Leather equipment
---
●	Outputs: Leather scrap
---
New Lunar spell: Recover leather
---
Magically unpicks any relevant item that can normally be unpicked via needle into leather scraps.
---
Re-forging
---
To re-forge a piece of equipment, simply use it on a furnace.
---
●	Requires a specific Smithing level
---
●	Inputs: Metal equipment
---
●	Outputs: Metal scrap
---
Standard spell book: Superheat item
---
Magically re-forges any relevant item that can normally be re-forged via furnace into metal scraps.
---
When an item has been recycled, the player will be left with various types of scrap material. Scrap items can be traded with junk traders who can be found in the various wardshops around the world. These junk traders will accept scrap material in exchange for a range of items - known as nature idols - that only exist to be dissolved into vis.
---
The process of dissolving is a key aspect of Warding as it is where players will gather most of their vis. Dissolving's core purpose is to help remove an abundance of items from the game whilst also providing a main source for vis. Dissolving equipment requires a specific Warding level as well as a channeling lamp and a ward – higher level wards reward more vis. Placing the equipment onto the ward begins the dissolving process, from which the player is guaranteed a set amount of vis based on the ward used and there’s also a small chance to receive some scrap material.
---
Thought: Should re-forging and un-picking reward vis? It isn’t needed in their creation, so how did it come about?
---
Dragonhide and fantasy metals (Mithril, adamant, runite &amp; dragon) will reward vis due to being magical resources.
---
Wardshops
---
Throughout the world in a few select places, a bunch of new workshops have opened with a specialization in everything Warding. In these shops, visitors can find a range of utilities consisting of:
---
●	A shopkeeper
---
o	Sells lamps and small quantities of vis.
---
●	A runestone monolith
---
o	These massive chunks of magic rock can be used as magical training dummies. When a successful combat spell is cast upon it, a small quantity of vis of that element is created.
---
▪	Note: Would this functionality work better by utilizing Runecraft altars?
---
●	A ward panel table
---
o	Used to create various types of ward panels. Wooden ones can be used as placeable wards that don’t require a warding level to place while stone ones are used to make permanent wards that can be placed in hotspots around the world.
---
●	Warding tutor (Al Kharid only)
---
o	Teaches the basics of Warding. Rewards the player with some vis and silk to get the player started.
---
Around the world, ward shops can be found in various places, these include:

---
Experience &amp; Time to 99
---
The XP per hour and GP per XP rates will be informed by the other two armour creation skills: Crafting &amp; Smithing. The aim is to have Warding sit within a middle ground of those.
---
COMMON: Smithing Rune 2H Swords: 300K/Hr, 180K Xp/Hr
---
EXPENSIVE: Smelting Gold Ore: 2.135M/Hr, 400K Xp/Hr
---
Based on the above information, the fastest method is 7x more expensive, but hardly 2x faster. 
---
Similarly, with Crafting:
---
COMMON: Cutting Sapphires: 400K/Hr, 135K/Hr
---
EXPENSIVE: Crafting Black D’Hide Bodies: 3.3M/Hr, 425K Xp/Hr
---
Like Smithing, Crafting costs 8x more for only 3x the XP.
---
The proposed Warding rates are a direct average of the current Smithing and Crafting rates.

---
All “Time to 99” rates of Crafting, Smithing and Warding assume the player begins using the high-level method from level 1. However, this is a simple way to convey the relevant information, with little consequence to the logistics when the skill is trained.
---
The best way to implement the proposed rates is to make low-level methods require small amounts of VIS for small amounts of exp. As the player progresses, they can opt to train faster but for exponentially more VIS.
---
Example:
---
COMMON: Warding low-level Robes: 356 VIS/Hr, 154K XP/Hr
---
EXPENSIVE: Warding high-level Robes: 2700 VIS/Hr, 412K XP/Hr
---
Materials: Silks, leathers and barks
---
These are the materials primarily used in Warding to craft magical armours. The skill will ultilise existing items like xerician fabric and fine cloth but will also be introducing a swathe of new materials which are gathered via Hunter, Woodcutting and combat
---
While Hunter will be the main skill used when gathering materials for Warding, the Woodcutting skill also comes in handy as a few armours require pieces of bark to create. For free-to-play players who do not have access to the Hunter skill, new low-level silk dropping monsters will be added to various dungeons around the world; more info on these can be found below.
---
  *Bug net = Butterfly net
---
[removed]
---
That's not the only imbued organ incoming.
---
Hunter
---
Warding's core partner skill is Hunter as this skill will allow for any player to be able to obtain a wide range of silks through a variety of different methods. 
---
With this update to Hunter, certain items that already exist in-game will be gathered using Hunter in a way that wasn’t previously possible; these items include:
---
●	Silk – Obtainable from Thieving and shops.
---
●	Xerician fabric – Obtainable from Thieving and combat.
---
●	Fine cloth – An item which is obtained from looting chests during the “Shades of Mort’ton” minigame.
---
●	Hollow bark – Obtained via Woodcutting.
---
Butterfly net hunting
---
Butterfly net hunting functions just like regular butterfly hunting, however, areas with moths will be a little more interesting. Moths travel around in swarms and multiple moths can be caught at the same time. Butterfly jars can hold up to 5 moths while impling jars can hold 10 (subject to balancing).  Wielding a channeling lamp while in an area with silk moths will cause them to follow you. Some moths, like the mystic moth, appear only in very special situations much like rare implings.
---
Once a jar is full of moths it can be emptied, rewarding the player with 3 pieces of silk from a regular jar and 6 from an impling jar. Possibilities for larger jars created via Crafting could be a nice way to add new money-making content in the future.
---
Silk Dungeon
---
The silk dungeon is a large underground cave system heavily inhabited by several large moth nests. The dungeon can be found north of Al Kharid, nearby the mine. Each floor contains large quantities of moths that can be caught with a bug net, there are also several small rooms filled with giant moths that can be killed for silk. The top floor contains standard moths while the bottom floor houses the more sinister occult moths.
---
Lamp luring
---
Hunter/Firemaking
---
Lamp luring is a new type of hunting activity that tasks players with building large bonfires, setting moth traps around them and then luring moth swarms over to them via the use of a channeling lamp. While a swarm of moths is nearby your trap, it will gradually fill with moths. Once the trap is full or has collapsed, it can be searched for moths which must be placed within a butterfly or impling jar.
---
Moth swarms can also be gathered with a butterfly net, but this is a far slower method than using the lantern traps. Moth swarms come in a few varieties; each are attracted to a different colour of light – this can be changed by operating a channeling lamp.
---
Actions:
---
●	Gather wood
---
o	Requires: An axe
---
o	Function: It’ll come in handy
---
o	Reward: Woodcutting XP &amp; Logs
---
●	Building/Feeding a campfire
---
o	Requires: Tinderbox &amp; Logs
---
o	Function: Traps moths within a radius which increases when the fire is stronger.
---
o	Rewards: Firemaking XP
---
●	Setting up/Searching a trap
---
o	Requires: Logs &amp; Silk fibers
---
o	Function: Traps nearby moth swarms
---
o	Rewards: Moths + Hunting XP
---
●	Lure moth swarms to your traps
---
o	Requires: Channeling lamp
---
o	Function: Get more moth swarms near your traps
---
o	Reward: Traps fill up faster
---
Moth swarms come in 4 varieties and each are only attracted to a specific type of fire. Different fire pits can be found throughout the areas where lamp luring can be done, the four types are: Oak, willow, yew and magic. Adding logs to a campfire takes twice as long as it would usually take to light that specific type of log; there is also a cap to how many logs can be added to a campfire as they are not intended to replace the usual training method but rather serve as an alternative.

Note: With this update, suqah hide would become tradeable. This would not apply to any suqah hide already within the game.
---
Note: With this update, dagannoth fledglings would be made more accessible and would become a hunter creature rather than a combat creature. They already provide no combat/slayer experience. The ones near Bardur would remain. These would also have a rare chance of dropping bone pieces – this could be expanded to include all dagannoth variants.
---
Deep underground on Lunar isle sits a cave full of savage suqahs, a breed that walks on all fours and cannot be engaged in combat. These can be hunted using the pitfall technique at level 65 Hunter.
---
A new cave section would also be added to the waterbirth dungeon for collecting dagannoth hides via hunter. Peer the Seer in Rellekka can be used as a deposit box (after the easy diary) so it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle to gather hides/bone pieces.

***Mystic moths would only be blue, leaving dark, light and dusk variants unique to the Slayer skill. These could either spawn around the world with a similar rarity to magpie/ninja implings or act as random event within moth hunting areas.
---
Combat
---
As Hunter is a member's skill, there would need to be an efficient method for F2P players to gather silk. This will be done via combat by killing a range of new mobs known as giant moths. These new mobs will have a guaranteed drop of silk of the relevant type.
---
Giant moths are incredibly weak to magic damage, moderately weak to ranged attacks and completely immune to melee damage due to being airborne.

---
Woodcutting
---
Certain defensive armours can be created with Warding that can be utilised by wizards; these armour sets require a range of barks to be created. One of such items already exists in-game: splitbark. With the addition of Warding, two new types of trees and barks will be added to the game.
---
●	Bloodwood tree – L65 Woodcutting
---
o	Located: Slepe, Wilderness &amp; Arceuus
---
o	Provides: Bloodbark
---
●	Soulwood tree – L80 Woodcutting
---
o	Located: Lunar isle, Tirannwn &amp; Arceuus
---
o	Provides: Soulbark
---
Rewards/Products
---
Channeling
---
Channeling is the process of fusing materials like silks and barks with elemental vis into various types of robes and armours. Each garment requires different quantities of material while the amount of vis required is dependent on the tier of robe or armour.
---
●	Boots &amp; gloves require two pieces of material
---
●	Hoods &amp; hats require four pieces of material
---
●	Tops &amp; bottoms require six pieces of material
---
If the garment being made requires two different materials, they need to be supplied in equal quantities. For instance, creating a splitbark body would require three bolts of fine silk and three pieces of hollow bark.
---
The various tiers of robe and armour equipment are listed below. Equipment marked in italics have a set effect while all other new sets are marked in bold and pre-existing sets that have been adjusted slightly are underlined.

*Finite silk can only be obtained via the Magic Training Arena minigame shop and would work out to be slightly cheaper than buying the pieces outright, with the added requirement of a high Warding level to manufacture the pieces. This will also be the only way to obtain a new item - the infinity hood.
---
Equipment
---
All previously mentioned set-effects have been scrapped. The option to bring some of those back still exists but needs to be done sparingly with much consideration regarding the current meta.
---
All low-level magic sets (wizard, black, zamorak etc.) will have both hood and hat variants while low-level prayer sets (priest, monk, druid etc) will only have hoods.
---
Robes
---
Low-level robe sets will be quite cheap in terms of the amount of vis required to create them. The higher-level robes like mystic and infinity will likely be expensive due to resource rarity as both mystic and finite silk will be difficult to obtain.
---
Shade

---
Notes on Pado’s Set:
---
Pado’s Set can only be made after learning about it from Brother Jered as a member of the Edgeville Monastery (therefore with an implicit requirement of 31 Prayer)
---
Pado’s helm is more like a durable helm than thin fabric, and therefore offers unique defense bonuses.

---
Notes on the Thaumaturge Set: 
---
The set effect does not apply to spells from the Ancient Spellbook.
---
The Thaumaturge warper is a book worn in the shield slot, making the tome of fire unusable in combination with the Thaumaturge set-effect.
---
The set is exceedingly light-weight and a tool for swiftness and stealth amongst Gielinor’s Magi.
---

---
Imbues
---
Skilling Rings
---
Skilling rings aim to provide more profit while training gathering skills like Woodcutting, Mining, Farming and Hunter. These rings are created via Warding and require a new untradeable item that can be obtained randomly while performing that skilling activity. For instance, a ring of wood requires a stone leaf to be created; these can be found randomly while woodcutting in the same way a bird nest would appear. These rings would have finite charges and would be balanced accordingly. 
---
There is a ring for each of the 5 gathering skills:
---
Rings
---
Materials
---
Effect
---
Ring of Wood
---
Willow Log + Stone Leaf
---
X% chance to receive double logs. Scales based on tree.
---
Ring of Earth
---

---
X% chance to receive double produce from allotments.
---
Ring of Amber
---
Silver Bar + Amber
---
Water + Earth
---
X% chance to receive double loot. Scales based on hunter creature. 
---
39
---
Ring of Bone
---
Gold Bar + Fish bone
---
X% chance to receive double fish. Scales based on fish. 
---
Ring of Iron
---
Iron Bar + Obsidian shard
---
X% chance to receive double ore. Scales based on mineral.
---
The 5 unique items gathered rarely while skilling is listed below. All these items are stackable so they don’t fill up the players inventory.
---
●	Stone leaf – Obtained rarely while Woodcutting.
---
●	Old Seed – Obtained rarely while Farming.
---
●	Amber – Obtained rarely while Hunting.
---
●	Fish bone – Obtained rarely while Fishing.
---
●	Obsidian shard – Obtained rarely while Mining.
---
Combat Rings
---
Combat rings already exist in-game as rewards from the Nightmare Zone minigame. With the release of Warding, these will be creatable via skilling as well. With this addition, the imbued combat rings will also become tradeable.

The fuck is wrong with the crafting skill? I personally don't think you understand the hole in which this potentially new skill fills. Crafting makes range armor, smithing makes melee armor, Warding makes mage armor. Any more questions?
---
Engravings would be rewards from a Warding focused minigame – more on this can be found towards the end of the design document.
---
Note: These rings could be moved into the magic skill if that feels more appropriate.
---
Items
---
Below is a collection of other item reward ideas from the Warding skill. These wouldn’t necessarily need to be available on launch but could be polled separately and added later.
---
Rune pouch
---
The rune pouch is an item that can store 16,000 of three types of runes. Players can purchase the item via the bounty hunter store or the slayer reward store. 
---
●	Elemental Rune Pouch
---
o	Stores 2 types of elemental runes
---
o	Made with: Abyssal silk
---
●	Large Rune Pouch
---
o	Stores 4 types of any runes
---
o	Made with: Abyssal silk + Rune pouch
---
●	Wild Rune Pouch
---
o	Stores 3 types of any runes
---
o	Only useable while in the wilderness.
---
o	This would replace the one purchased in the Bounty Hunter store and would be considerably cheaper.
---
Note: Should empty rune pouches be made trade-able?
---
Essence pouches
---
Repairing pouches
---
Instead of contacting the nicest NPC in Gielinor to fix any broken essence pouches, repair them with Warding! This is achieved by patching them up with some abyssal silk which can be obtained as a drop from the various abyssal creatures from around the various planes.
---
●	1x abyssal silk to repair the small pouch
---
●	2x abyssal silk to repair the medium pouch
---
●	3x abyssal silk to repair the large pouch
---
●	4x abyssal silk to repair the giant pouch
---
Fused essence pouch
---
●	Requires 10 abyssal silk + all pouches + Omni vis.
---
●	Creating a Fused Pouch requires 85 Warding and 85 RuneCrafting.
---
●	Requires 85 Runecraft to use.
---
A combination of all essence pouches magically fused at a ward by channeling Omni VIS with all 4 pouches in the inventory. The pouch can hold slightly less than the cumulative of all pouches, 27 pieces of essence. The fused pouch has a 1/310 chance of breaking the magical bond when filled, leaving a degraded Giant pouch, degraded Large pouch, degraded Medium pouch and normal Small pouch. The VIS required to bind all 4 essence pouches into the Fused Pouch is the same amount required to imbue a ring. A player will not be able to obtain another one of the essence pouches (from abyssal leeches, etc.) while they own the Fused Pouch. 
---
Note: Should empty essence pouches be made tradeable?
---
Elemental tomes
---
Tomes would be added to drop tables to match the functionality of the tome of fire. The ability to create elemental pages (burnt, damp, dirty etc) would be possible via Warding. The cost in vis to make these pages should mitigate any harm to the market price of burnt pages. That may require waiting a few weeks for the price of vis to settle before adding these into the game.
---
●	Tome of Air
---
o	Increases air spell damage by 50%
---
●	Tome of Water
---
o	Increases water spell damage by 50%
---
●	Tome of Earth
---
o	Increases earth spell damage by 50%
---
The tomes themselves should become monster drops (potentially each could be given to a giant boss) while the pages can be made via Warding &amp; Runecraft:
---
●	Breezy page: Papyrus + Air vis
---
●	Damp page: Papyrus + Water vis
---
●	Dirty page: Papyrus + Earth vis
---
●	Burnt page: Papyrus + Fire vis
---
Note: Should this be part of Runecraft instead? Runes would be substituted where vis is required. This would solidify Runecraft as a skill for ammunition while Warding is a skill that focuses on worn defensive equipment.
---
Magic Incantations
---
An incantation is an item held in the ammunition slot that increases the user’s magic bonuses. These function in the same way blessings do, but for magic instead of prayer.

---
Anti-poison lamp
---
A wieldable item for the off-hand slot. It can be filled/charged with anti-poison potions of all varieties. Once equipped, the player will be immune to poison providing the lamp has charges inside it. A charge is removed whenever a player would have been poisoned. Learning to make this could be a quest reward and isn’t needed for the initial release.
---
Quests &amp; Lore
---
Wardrobe malfunction
---
Requirements:
---
●	None
---
A quest that delves into the mystery of magical robe creation. Who’s been making all these robes and how? To begin this quest, head over to the Wizards’ tower and learn the secrets of the brand-new Warding skill.
---
Rewards:
---
●	1,000 Warding XP
---
Imp Catcher 2
---
Requirements
---
●	10 Warding
---
●	Imp catcher
---
●	Rune mysteries
---
Learn the secrets of how to create elemental robes, tasking the adventurer to track down some mischievous implings that have stolen some other magical items. This quest would reward the player with the knowledge of the Thaumaturge set.
---
●	5,500 Warding XP
---
●	Ability to make the Thaumaturge set
---
Unnamed Warding quest - poison themed, Anti-poison lamp reward.
---
●	20 Warding
---
●	5 Herblore
---
Mentioned above. It feels like the anti-poison lamp would fit nicely as a small Warding themed quest reward item (as a 1 off unique thing). Could tie in a few other skills as well like Herblore.
---
●	6,500 Warding XP
---
●	Anti-poison lamp
---
Unnamed Warding/Smithing/Crafting quest - Omni-recycler reward.
---
●	75 Warding
---
●	75 Crafting
---
●	75 Smithing
---
A high-level quest where the player must create a unique &amp; useful inventory recycling tool that lets you easily dissolve, unpick &amp; re-forge items into vis, no matter where you are in the world.
---
●	Omni-recycler
---
●	15k Warding XP
---
●	15k Smithing XP
---
●	15k Crafting XP
---
Omni-recycler: Inventory object &amp; Interactable tool. Non-tradable.
---
Creatable with level 75 Smithing, 75 Crafting &amp; 75 Warding.
---
Use: Allows you to use any recycling eligible material on the omni-recycler in your inventory to instantly reduce it to vis.
---
Reason: somewhat high-end skilling reward content to make recycling more convenient &amp; encourage more people to recycle items instead of alching them on the go during skilling or combat/slayer for example.
---
Could have an interesting method of creation requiring some high value materials to make. 
---
Note: Isn’t required for initial release.
---
Minigame: Mystical Sleuthing 
---
(Placeholder name)
---
This is a proposal for a hybrid skilling method for Warding &amp; Runecraft, to be released with the Warding skill.
---
Requirements: 
---
●	Completion of Rune Mysteries quest &amp; Wardrobe Malfunction quest.
---
●	Items to make wards (channeling lamp &amp; vis).
---
●	Any RC talisman/tiara that you have the RC level to use to craft the corresponding runestone with.
---
Main Gameplay Loop
---
You’ll be employing your knowledge of the arcane magical arts of Warding &amp; Runecrafting in order to help the many citizens of Gielinor deal with magical problems &amp; threats.
---
Step 1 - Mission
---
●	Start the activity at one of a few possible wizard NPCs (e.g. Sedridor in Wizards’ Tower). Receive word of magical disturbances somewhere in Gielinor that needs attention. Get told a specific NPC &amp; their location to go and visit (e.g. Sir Prysin in Varrock Palace).
---
Level 1 Warding &amp; 1 Runecraft - Wizards’ Tower (NPC: Sedridor).
---
Locations you may be sent to help people: (F2P accessible locations only).
---
Draynor, Lumbridge, Port Sarim, Rimmington, Varrock, Falador, Edgeville, Al Kharid.
---
Level 30 Warding &amp; 30 Runecraft - Sorcerer’s Tower (NPC: Thormac).
---
Locations you may be sent to help people: (All the above, plus the following):
---
Taverley, Burthorpe, Catherby, Seers’ Village, East Ardougne, Yanille, Tree Gnome Stronghold, Rellekka, Brimhaven, Tai Bwo Wannai, Canifis, Slepe, Pollnivneach.
---
Level 60 Warding &amp; 60 Runecraft - Mystics’ Guild (new location &amp; NPC in Arceuus, Zeah).
---
Arceuus, Port Piscarilius, Hosidius, Lovakengj, Shayzien, Neitiznot, Jatizso, Miscellania, Etceteria, Lunar Isle, Port Phasmatys, Burgh de Rott, Mos Le'Harmless, Corsair Cove, Ape Atoll, Shilo Village, Piscatoris, Nardah, Sophanem, Lletya, Prifddinas.
---
Dozens, maybe hundreds of combinations of possible locations &amp; threats around Gielinor (dev time permitting).
---
Step 2 - Investigate
---
●	Arrive at location &amp; investigate any &amp; all nearby “sinister marks” to discover the problem with the NPC, resulting in 1 of 4 magical issues:
---
o	Concealed magical creature or illusion that needs revealing.
---
o	Damage caused by hexes &amp; curses that needs mending.
---
o	Impending magical attack that needs repelling.
---
o	Dangerous magical enemy presence that needs removing.
---
Step 3 - Action
---
●	Based on which threat, need to tackle by placing 1 or more of the correct wards (Air, Water, Earth, Fire), plus minor gameplay interacting with elements in &amp; around the NPCs property.
---
Step 4 - Cleanup
---
●	Once you’ve dealt with the threat, the residual magical energy will coalesce &amp; solidify into rock hard magical residue. Interact with it &amp; harmlessly siphon it into runestones via your talisman. 
---
Crisis averted &amp; NPC saved.
---
Final Step (Repeat) - Go back to the start NPC to begin gameplay loop again, or use NPC Contact  spell).
---
Description of how you’ll use wards in the activity:
---
Air Ward of Disillusion.
---
The act of revealing concealed magical threats, hidden in the spiritual, shadow or runic planes.
---
(Lore logic: Air &amp; wind used to blow away magical concealment spells).
---
Water Ward of Ablution.
---
The act of cleansing to remove a magical hex or curse on a person or place.
---
(Lore logic: Water used to soothe wounds and magical ailments).
---
Earth Ward of Protection.
---
The act of safeguarding a person or place from dangerous magical attacks.
---
(Lore logic: Earth used to provide solid foundations of magical safety &amp; fortification).
---
Fire Ward of Expulsion.
---
The act of forcibly removing a dangerous magical entity from a possessed person or place.
---
(Lore logic: Fire used to burn away magical enemies that are occupying something or someone).
---
Mission Examples
---
Using an Air Ward of Disillusion in Bob’s Axes in Lumbridge to reveal the hidden mischievous imp causing havoc.
---
Using a Water Ward of Ablution in Ned’s house in Draynor Village to cleanse a hex that was placed on him.
---
Using an Earth Ward of Protection for the White Knights in Falador Castle to block nasty Kinshra magical attacks. 
---
Using a Fire Ward of Expulsion by Sir Prysin in Varrock Palace to remove a dangerous demonic possession.
---
Gotta have another one over the logout button to make sure you dont misclick.

XP scales based on your Warding level &amp; Runecraft talisman/rune type. XP rates for both should be no more than 1/3 of what you’d realistically achieve via training the skills in their standard methods at any given level.
---
(e.g. if at your current Warding level, you can reach 300k XP p/hour, using this method of Mystical Sleuthing at the same level should give around 100k XP p/hour. Same XP ratio goes for Runecrafting - 1/3 of regular rates).
---
Runestones &amp; Magic Links (non-tradable)
---
The two primary item rewards are a small number of Runes &amp; a unique reward currency: “Magic Links”
---
(Lore: Links that tether the magical planes of existence to the mortal realm. Certain wizards may find use for these curious objects).
---
Spend Links on various things:
---
Tier 1 Reward shop - accessible in the Wizards’ Tower (NPC: Sedridor)
---
Blank Talisman Staff - (non-tradable)  
---
Cost: X Magic Links
---
Can be taken along with a talisman to the relevant Runecraft altar to create a Talisman staff. 
---
Requires same Runecraft level to make the talisman staff as is needed to craft the rune of that type (e.g. 44 Runecraft to make a Nature Talisman Staff with a Blank Talisman Staff &amp; Nature Talisman).
---
Use: Can be used in place of a talisman or tiara when entering altars, or when playing the Mystical Sleuthing activity. Equippable in main-hand slot. Requires no combat levels to equip and has no stats.
---
Note: Both serves as a throwback to the Talisman staves from 2008 &amp; gives a small amount of choice to RC runs when not using the Abyss, without impacting XP p/hour or overall ease of training. Mostly exists as a nice reward to use when training via the Mystical Sleuthing activity itself (you’d be able to equip a RC Talisman Staff in the main-hand, with your Warding Channelling lamp in the off-hand).
---
Tier 2 Reward shop - accessible in the Sorcerer’s Tower (NPC: Thormac)
---
(Note: this reward shop has no level req to use (other than unlocking access to the activity), however using Thormac as an NPC for Mystical Sleuthing missions requires 30 Runecraft &amp; Warding.
---
Learn the ability to make Mystic staves with Warding - (non-tradable)   
---
Warding recipes that teaches you the method of upgrading certain magical weapons/main-hands into their Mystic variants.
---
Note: Could be just 1 expensive recipe unlock, could be multiple cheap unlocks per item type.
---
Also, with Thormac being the Tier 2 activity NPC/reward shop, it makes thematic sense as to why he sells/teaches the ability to make Mystic staves for yourself (as he’s the current NPC for doing so).
---
            Example 1: Existing Mystic Battlestaves makeable with Warding:
---
Upgrade a standard elemental battlestaff into its Mystic variant via Warding with some vis (&amp; ingredients?). Alternative to going to Thormac to do so.
---
Requires similar Warding level to upgrade to Mystic as it requires Crafting level to make the regular battlestaff version (lvl 54 to 66).
---
Note: Would have to carefully balance it so the cost to upgrade is reasonably high so as it doesn’t become easy money to make a Mystic battlestaff then alch it (as they alch for a lot).
---
            Example 2: Mystic Talisman Staff - (non-tradable)
---
Upgrade a standard Talisman staff into a Mystic Talisman staff variant via Warding with some vis (&amp; ingredients?).
---
Requires the same Warding level to upgrade as the Runecraft level needed to make (e.g. 44 Runecraft to make a Nature Talisman Staff, 44 Warding to upgrade it into a Mystic Nature Tali-Staff).
---
Use: Same as above, but also gives basic combat stats to the staves (+10 magic, some melee stats, etc), requires 40 Magic &amp; Attack to wield.
---
Note: Could possibly explore additional effects on the staves but could get messy quickly.
---
Tier 3 Reward shop - accessible in the Mystics’ Guild (Arceuus) (NPC: New NPC) (Lvl 60 RC &amp; Ward)
---
Combat Ring Imbue Scrolls - (tradable)  
---
Cost: X Magic Links (Granite ring imbue scroll cheapest; Ring of Suffering imbue scroll costliest).
---
The official replacement for NMZ as the home of ring imbues. Places them in a more thematically fitting location but keeps the overall style of implementation familiar to the player (from a reward shop in an activity/minigame).
---
Use: Can be used on certain combat rings to imbue them, doubling their stats.
---
Note: All existing imbued rings would NOT be removed from players. Everyone keeps existing ones.
---
Each scroll sold separately per ring, and tradable so people can freely buy &amp; sell the imbue scroll.
---
Quick Talisman Note
---
Astral, Blood &amp; Soul Talismans.   
---
Because multiple gameplay &amp; reward offerings in this pitch refer to Runecrafting Talismans, it’s worth highlighting some that currently don’t exist but could, as they’d be beneficial for these gameplay offerings if they did. Without the addition of at least a Blood &amp; Soul talisman, there’d be a nasty 30 level gap (Deaths at 65 RC, Wraths at 95 RC) at the top end that’d really stifle progression through this activity. 
---
For lore reasons, the Astral, Blood &amp; Soul altars have never needed talismans to enter, as such they don’t exist in game.
---
Blood &amp; Soul - Strange altar creations on Zeah that have an unknown link to the age-old Dark Altar. They’re stated in game to draw on the power of the original Blood &amp; Soul altars elsewhere in the world, therefore it stands to reason that the original Moonclan created altars are still present somewhere &amp; the Talismans to access them could still exist (even if they wouldn’t currently be able to direct you there).
---
Blood Talisman source: Vyrewatch drop. (Thematically relevant drop source).
---
Soul Talisman source: Cerberus drop. (Thematically relevant drop source).
---
Note: A blood &amp; soul talisman that are currently “inert” when trying to locate their respective altars could open up additional RC update possibilities in the future with the introduction of the original moonclan-created blood &amp; soul altars (along with relevant quests in Morytania &amp; the desert/underworld). Could have slightly different functions than their Zeah counterparts, offering more runes p/hour with less XP p/hour. Not something that urgently needs to happen though. 
---
Astral - Being On Lunar Isle; the homeland of the Moonclan (the original creators of the stone altars around the mainland &amp; beyond after their discovery of Runecrafting), they never needed to hide away the Astral altar in a separate Runic plane like they did with all the others (to keep out of sight from prying eyes). Doesn’t negate the existence of a Talisman for altar locating purposes though.
---
Astral Talisman source: Suqah drop. (Thematically relevant drop source).
---
Mystical Sleuthing activity - Summary of problems &amp; solutions.
---
Solution: A strong focus on having a mixture of gameplay variety within each core gameplay loop. Lots of existing places &amp; characters being utilised and a sense of thought process &amp; minor problem solving/puzzle &amp; reaction based mechanics involved, it should broaden the gameplay that the Warding skill is offering to a significant enough degree so that it reaches a suitable level of depth for potential players (thus providing more of a reason to get excited for Warding as a whole).
---
Solution: Using wards in this manner of protection &amp; guardianship helps to solidify Warding as a more generic term that translates well across not just OSRS, but other fantasy &amp; IRL concepts of a ward. It also provides good gameplay variety for wards without needing to stray into sketchy territory like actual combat wards or the like, remaining strictly non-combat on the players side.
---
Solution: These ward definitions can help to add to the worldbuilding &amp; storytelling within the game &amp; offer up a great deal of potential for how Warding can be integrated into future quests (helping any NPC who has a magical threat or issue plaguing them that requires magical security).
---
Solution: Keeping the NMZ imbues within the context of a minigame &amp; not taking existing ones away from players under any circumstances while widening the accessibility of them via tradable imbue scrolls instead should help to alleviate some of the early concerns. It also feels more thematically fitting being under a cohesive magical-themed minigame that offers several relevant unlocks rather than a very loosely linked quest-boss fighting minigame (NMZ).
---
Solution: Better defining how Warding, Runecraft &amp; Magic interacts with one another, ensuring each element is still doing something unique &amp; bringing something to the table that the others do not. Only enhancing, not detracting. With Warding content, constantly be asking yourself: “Is this skill interaction making or upgrading some kind of magic equipment?”. If so, then good, if not, then ask yourself does it belong in another skill. 
---
Solution: While some may be afraid of offering alternative ways of getting Runecraft XP, this method aims to still feel mechanically like a core Runecrafting altar run gameplay loop. However instead of running back and forth to just 1 altar location &amp; a bank, you’d be travelling to dozens, maybe even hundreds of different places all over Gielinor. This should (hopefully) provide that sense of variation &amp; surprise that Runecrafting (and many other skills beyond it) so sorely lacks, while still feeling just similar enough to not be inappropriate. The big important factor for most players will be that these new Runecraft methods won’t be the meta/ best XP p/hour.
---
The Guild
---
Why not look at the concept of not just a hybrid skill activity, but also a hybrid guild.
---
The precedent already exists in game with The Warriors’ Guild. A melee focused guild that encompasses &amp; requires both Attack &amp; Strength levels (and even Defence, to a lesser extent). If there’s a strong enough overlap, I see no reason why a similar thing couldn’t be done again for other closely linked skills.
---
With a hybrid guild you can massively play up more aspects of both Warding &amp; Runecrafting, actively increase the value &amp; unique features of both simultaneously.
---
So then, where is it &amp; what things could be in it?
---
Arcanists’ Guild
---
Entry requirements: Level 60 Warding, level 60 Runecraft.       
---
Location: Arceuus house (Great Kourend, Zeah).
---
Core Features
---
Tier 3 Mystical Sleuthing skilling activity NPC, reward shop &amp; imbues
---
The high-level NPC representative for this activity would appear here in the guild. They send you off to high level &amp; quest locked locations around Gielinor to help the citizens with their magical problems. Provides best XP &amp; reward rate for the activity (better than the previous 2 NPCs).
---
Also contains the high-level Tier 3 activity shop, which is where the new home of NMZ reward imbues will be (as covered in the top activity section).
---
Scroll Lectern
---
It was mentioned to possibly move scrolls of redirection out of NMZ and into Warding too. Could do it via a unique object in the guild that lets you make the scrolls (with papyrus, house tabs, vis, etc). 
---
Silk Cupboard
---
Store various silks (moths, hides, barks &amp; vis too?) inside the guild, akin to the Seed Vault in the Farming guild. Bank saver.
---
Permanent Catalytic Ward
---
The only location of a permanent ward in the world. Can be used like any standard player made ward.
---
Unique use lets you produce 1 special kind of magic robe/armour set that otherwise can’t be made anywhere else. Or possibly a cosmetic non-tradable magic outfit? Or maybe even a unique magical skilling outfit for Warding or Runecrafting, giving a small unique effect on the skill(s) (like Rogue for Thieving or Graceful for Agility) or the traditional 2.5% XP bonus outfit (probably too controversial/unnecessary).
---
Omni Altar
---
Lore: The Omni altar is a strange stone monolith. It’s a very recent creation of the Arceuus house, using the knowledge gained from interacting with the Moonclan tribe of Lunar Isle &amp; learning of their history (what with the Moonclan ancestors being responsible for constructing the original runestone altars around Gielinor).
---
It was made by one of the more progressive Arceuus house inhabitants (much to the disagreement of other Arceuus house residents) in an attempt to wean themselves off the reliance on the Blood, Soul &amp; Dark altars that exist nearby, due to the mysterious &amp; malevolent history those altars have with dark magical arts.
---
Function:
---
The Omni altar didn’t fully achieve what the Arceuus house wanted, but it did prove useful.
---
Firstly, you can splash on the Omni altar for a supply of Omni Vis.
---
Secondly, by drawing a different ward (air, water, earth or fire ward) on it, you can attune the altar to make 1 of 4 different new combination runes. Sadly, due to the inefficiency of the altar, the Runecraft XP gained here is marginal (focus on being a direct reward output of new rune types rather than a training method).
---
Four new combination runes are: (with rune icon ideas included).
---
Level 60 Runecraft - Omni Rune  - (Acts as: Air, Water, Earth, Fire).
---
Level 72 Runecraft - Stellar Rune  - (Acts as: Cosmic, Astral).
---
Level 83 Runecraft - Balance Rune  - (Acts as: Nature, Law).
---
Level 96 Runecraft - War Rune  - (Acts as: Chaos, Death, Wrath).
---
Each new combination rune type requires a stack of each of the prerequisite runes + Pure essence to craft. (Subject to balancing - may need to change how they’re made. Key point is bad XP p/hour but unique rune reward output).
---
Reason:
---
With an Omni rune, Balance rune &amp; War rune, PKers would only need those 3 runes to effectively PK on the standard spellbook. This basically serves to provide both exclusive high-end Runecraft reward content &amp; subtle PvP content additions.
---
Stellar rune would simply condense down a few lunar spells &amp; provide further thematic ties between the Arceuus house &amp; Moonclan tribe (requiring completion of the relevant Lunar Diplomacy quests).
---
Note: This could be adding too many Runecrafting runes at once. This could also be diminishing the nostalgia of core original runes. 
---
Random musings &amp; miscellaneous
---
Elemental Tomes (air, water, earth, fire)
---
Another possible avenue for hybrid skill reward. As Runecrafting deals with magic ammo (runes), it makes a lot of sense to let offensive magic charges (tome pages) fall under that umbrella too.
---
 Could simply require both levels (Warding &amp; Runecraft), take a stack of elemental vis to the relevant elemental Runecraft altar with a bunch of papyrus in your inventory to craft the runic energy into the pages (very bad Runecraft &amp; Warding XP p/hour, exists as a reward output).
---
The tomes themselves being drops from monsters feels reasonable enough but could equally be incorporated into multiple skills. Or a monster drops a special magical item drop that can be bound in magical silk &amp; leather (via Warding level) to create the tome.
---
Existing low-level items:
---
Staff, Magic Staff, basic Elemental Staves (air, water, earth, fire)
---
Note: In the spirit of filling in gaps &amp; letting players use their skills to obtain things, just like how low-level robes will be created via Warding, this would allow players to make the existing low-level magic weapons.
---
●	Use a knife on a standard log to carve a “Stick” (new object) (Level 2 Fletching).
---
●	Use a “Stick” on a ward with some vis to make a “Staff” (level 2 Warding). 
---
●	Use a “Staff” on any basic colour bead (imp catcher beads) to make a “Magic Staff” (level 2 Crafting). 
---
Or, take a basic colour bead (imp catcher beads) to a Runecrafting altar to convert it into an elemental bead.
---
●	White bead on air altar = Air bead (level 1 Runecraft).
---
●	Black bead on water altar = Water bead (level 5 Runecraft).
---
●	Yellow bead on earth altar = Earth bead (level 9 Runecraft).
---
●	Red bead on fire altar = Fire bead (level 14 Runecraft).
---
Use Elemental bead on a basic “Staff” to make the relevant Elemental staff (level 3 to 15 Crafting).
---
(Air staff, Water staff, Earth staff, Fire staff).
---
        
---
Reason: Makes good use of multiple low-level skills. Remains semi-consistent with Battlestaff crafting (you empower an orb/bead with elemental energy, then attach it to the staff with Crafting). Gives a bit of extra use &amp; lore/thematic relevance to imp beads beyond just the amulet of accuracy.  
---
Warding Skilling Boss
---
Playing off the themes established in the Mystical Sleuthing activity, a skilling boss where you use wards in a very similar manner could be extremely fun.
---
Again, it’d technically be “non-combat” in the sense that you’re not dealing any direct combat damage (you’d still be taking damage, mind you) and it would in no way shape or form exist elsewhere in the game world.
---
Basically, a scary ancient magical creature is terrorizing a place in a dungeon somewhere. You and some friends can team up to cast down wards in its boss lair to dispel its concealment illusions, wards to heal &amp; repair things or people, wards to protect &amp; shelter from large attacks, and wards to drive back &amp; expel the beast (air, water, earth, fire respectively).
---
Rewards could be some high-level Warding ingredients for future robes/armours/weapons/books/etc.
---
End
---
Thank you for taking the time to read through this rather large design document on the Warding skill. If you have any concerns or thoughts about what you’ve read here, please give us feedback through the various forums and social platforms.
---
if you dont know what to do, run south. look at mager. turn prayer to range right after mager attacks, itll probably block dmg.
---
I'm going to assume alot more then, go on block me I'd love to see you try.. If you want to make a "official post" maybe don't make a post in the first place. Stop acting like a child who needs attention and you won't have this "toxicity" you sound like a kid who's father is Bill Gates lol.
---
Wonderful use of red/oranges.  And pretty much everything. You do such wonderful art I'm always happy to see it. : )
---
Could get first if we ever see another skill added.
---
Or -- and here me out here -- it very much IS tedious to me. I'm sorry that everyone doesn't have your opinion on the internet : (

nice

---
The fact that the game as a whole is currently in a state of deflation proves that gold sinks aren't the issue, item sinks are. They seriously need to revert death mechanics. We've gotten so spoiled by death being literally meaningless in 99% of scenarios that it won't ever get polled back in, it needs to be an integrity update.
---
I requested the evidence, and Jagex did not provide the chat logs. This is the second time Jagex has not provided the chat logs.
---
I’m not arguing that you’re disagreeing with me or not. What I don’t like is why you keep commenting ‘are you always going to repost this?? Etc etc’. It’s annoying as hell and that is what feels like harassment.
---
Now about what you said, it does not give any stats at all this item and it is simply for convenience. You use at most two bolt types in game, plus this item would not already be in game if it was not voted in for but it was. Now to make it useful.
---
Currently when switching bolts in inventory it gets interrupted in combat and it is super annoying. It is not even worth having with you because of things like this and that it takes up an inventory slot like regular bolts. So why have it in game? Hence make it useful already than what it currently is. It’s not like I’m saying to make blowpipe hit harder it’s good the way it is. This on the other hand is shit, and can do with some tweaking.
---
Been playing rs since 2005 and never did it before. Rs3 I’m 100% maxed stat wise and osrs I’m maxed 60att, still never did it. I was in over 150 attempts with closest being when I died on jad by running out of bolts. Never tried ever again.
---
Aint nothin wrong with that to me lol!

Yeah fr. Gold is removed, and inflation (at a decent rate) isn’t bad anyway. But when we have people camping bosses with 0 risk, brining in items it’s crazy how our economy even stands it lol. Personally I can’t think of a way to start removing items but hopefully jagex is more creative than me.
---
Lmaoooo

I’ll never try ever again either. I only deep wild and mage bank brid anyway, not really in need of one.

109 here with no Fight Cave attempts yet. My obby cape is my biggest shame with my account..
---
&gt;This is the beginning of the end of old school if you release this skill.
---
Agreed. Warding is going to kill OSRS if they push it through.
---
For real fuck mining
---
Please refer all price questions to the giant list of other threads from the last two weeks. Summer crash, happens every year, worse this year due to no summer PvM release like ToB or inferno.
---
&gt; If jagex banned 3rd party clients i wouldn't play anymore. RuneLite or bust.
---
I get this, official client is god-awful. But it's the only thing I can see actually making it harder for bot clients at this point.
---
&gt; Some bots (most, probably) use the official RS client. Banning third party clients would do nothing.
---
Most don't, some do yes, but the most popular ones use their own loader and injector. I'd easily say more than 80% of the current goldfarmers use a heavily modified client, to achieve the lowest performance cost (More bots) and fastest scripts. RSPeer is a grand-example before it got flagged.
---
&gt; Most bot farmers use proxies to hide and change their IPs on command anyways. This may stop your odd person from botting on their main, but it ain't stopping someone making bot farms for money.
---
You're right, but forcing a cooldown per IP would mean farmers have to use more proxies. My point is about mitigating creating new accounts on the fly, it's about making it harder for farmers to mass-create accounts like they currently can without limits.
---
Once the proxies used by farmers are flagged by Jagex (Which they already do, to make it easier to track down bots and get them quickly banned), then the cooldown then becomes a week. You'd need quite a few fresh, untouched proxies (Which are rare, and expensive at this point) to create 100 accounts in a week. Even if they aren't flagged, you'd still need quite a few to get new accounts out quick.
---
It's about making it harder for goldfarmers to keep farming, it's the only thing you can reasonably do at this point. You cannot stop people from botting, but you can make it near impossible to goldfarm with said bots.
---
Welcome to a *toxic* mmorpg you mean
---
Harassment of any kind doesn't fly at all on FFXIV, and to a lesser-extent GW2. And WoW changed some mechanics on retail to allow people to interact with the same monsters and nodes so you can't just "steal" them.
---
Have you tried.
---
NOT spacebaring through everything?
---
Rip, until he gets fed the exact same gear from his clan
---
Mind boggling. I can’t even fathom this level of playing. 
---
At this point you can safely say that your life has entirely been consumed by the game. I can’t imagine these guys have jobs or even a legitimate schooling schedule.
---
You’re right. I have no idea who he is. /s
---
And I believe you are the one misunderstanding the botting network. Some bots quite literally are ran by a warehouse of people, primarily in Asian countries, farming several different MMORPGs at the same time. This is a legitimate career for some people. 
---
I never said they aren’t also ran like you said - the way Jacmob used to. But there can be more than one way to do things and bots can serve several different purposes. Some are groups of friends crowdfunding their mains or selling the gold, and some can be pools of people working as a business to farm and sell gold. 
---
To answer your question, yes, I do know developers, and I’ve watched them get their scripts banned only to create a new one within 48 hours that remains undetected for weeks or months.
---
What is this from
---
D
---
It’s the summer. More people playing.
---
Well previously item sinks were new players joining and old players quitting, the playerbase is rather mature now so it’s becoming an issue, things like kraken tentacles and disassemble for consumables is a great way to sink items and keep value.
---
Wow! My main's almost at 50 mil xp too

^(wait...)
---
The new proposal for warding. V3
---
On the topic, the wyvern shield is also the only shield that gives negative ranged defence even when fully charged. That's pretty dumb imo.

the skills they offer and the rewards for doing said skills are complete shit.
---
HODL.

take the time to look at the 300 some topics made in the last 2 weeks and i am sure you will find an answer.

 damn the vid isnt loading for me.

Click on box trap. Wait until chinchompa goes in box trap. Click box trap. Click Box trap again. Repeat.
---
How would an alternate way of imbuing kill the prices
---
Do these guys have jobs? I don’t understand how you can have a life and also have 4.6 billion exp on osrs
---
Yea this is what I did to get some RC exp. I'm fucking clueless though.
---
A 1 hour live stream is just a terrible format for discussing community suggestions. There needs to be some other way of having a dialogue with the osrs team.
---
It has a high xp rate method that makes money, or birdhouses which is easy AF.
---
&gt; Items literally don’t leave the game anymore
---
uh...alchemy?
---
I have a feeling you won't be able to discuss this without making wild assumptions about me and getting emotional about someone disagreeing with your idea, oh well.
---
Bis mage has been moved onto staff rather than runes, you fill the staff and use that instead of carrying runes around. Rune pouches are a convinience more for utlites more than it's used for combat in the weakest combat style...
---
Herb sacks are a buff to slayer yea but its making a best new money maker out of it and only really makes some task more bareable to do so you don't bank needlessly often or only pick up expensive herbs.
---
Gem bags are a neice for who know what because no one is making much money off gem mining or rdt drops lol, coal bag buffs smiting yes but its marginal for runite and for steel where its actually making a 500k gp/h takes 4 plus hour to obtain and its primarily used in one place.
---
Looting bags are a risk reward system.
---
Please I'm trying to be reasonable but if you can't see criticism as something other than a personal attack on you maybe don't posy to reddit. Never once have I said any of the thing you are acusing me off and you're only saying them to pad out a reply that mostly consists of whataboutsisims and repeating a handful of sentences.
---
r/ihavesex
---
Agreed, let’s hear it ya neckbeards
---
An elevator pitch is in that document.
---
It’s pretty shitty to have the developers painstakingly lay out THE ENTIRE DESIGN of awarding in an extremely comprehensive document in an attempt to reach across the aisle to naysayers and improve the skill for everyone, and then say ‘but it’s too long!!!’.
---
Engaging with the player base on a topic as broad as this has obviously shown itself to be more difficult than imagined, and it’s not the dev’s responsibility to compress that dialogue down for people who don’t even care to understand it.
---
If you care, read the damn document. If you don’t, be patient and vote on the (more brief) poll blog when it happens.
---
maybe if you have down syndrome or something
---
so bad lulw

Bot farms are far far far far far far far far far from what you just explained. Those are so rare it's not even funny. Bot farms require maintenance and people who know what they're doing.
---
Most goldsellers don't even use bot farms. They use slave and prison labor. Because all you have to do is keep those people alive and glued to a screen 18 hours a day.
---
Botting is a hobby. Ever since rs3 nuked cursed energy, bot farming has considerably declined.
---
Who do you know? Because I promise I know them and I want to confront you on your lies lol
---
The purpose of runecrafting is nostalgic. There are only 21 Runes in osrs. There is no need to make it easier. It’s held to a high standard because it’s the ultimate grind. You either git gud or you don’t.
---
I understand your argument but if the xp rates were increased you'd see more people runecrafting regardless. Solo rc you can still get higher xp/hr than agility anyway, I don't see the big problem.
---
It’s funny how more people downvoted this comment then upvoted the post.
---
I thought it was obvious that I meant stuff like PVM items, no one is alching whips or BCP’s. But I suppose that was bad wording. And even with alchemy, none of those items are really that useful and only have a price because of their alch value.
---
Well, he streams pretty much every day and has a decent viewership
---
Boring
---
You can go 1-99 in 3 hours if you really bust your ass.
---
If the value of gp was going up because of the duel arena tax we would see the price of third party gold go up. It's been going down.
---
Yeah let me get good by doing Lava Runecrafting from 35 to 99, how existing, such hard gameplay right there going back and forth. We've also had an additional rune since the release which was dead on arrival because they were scared it would be better EXP.
---
isnt this just to imbue them? why would this affect the price?
---
Yeah so I've seen. Doesn't make it useful though lol
---
Let people like things

This is exactly what is concerning, there is someone who has found an exploit and ruining it for a lot of people (albeit a niche group of players) who simply want to move names between their own accounts.

It sucks because I don’t see how anyone would be out there ready to snipe at 3 AM EST with 2 webpages open ready to transfer within seconds.

no shit sherlock. hitting 1 higher isn't going to make up for 20+hp, gl having to eat every 2 times you get hit or risk getting comboed out

osrs has mobs that shit out pure ess like its candy. point 1 is mute unless ur a skillet only ironman in which case you choose to limit urself. Abyss i could get behind
---
Slaughter is great for bursting tasks and tasks that give good slayer xp in general since it’ll bring up total xp gained off that task. I’d say only use expeditious braces only if youre out/low/saving points and can’t afford to a slow task
---
Nice! I really want a pet
---
I liked Runespan, tbh. As a primarily f2p player, runespan was super cool and a godsend for rc training.
---
its still done, yes
---
Looks good keep going plz
---
The ignorance in your message wasn’t needed. Either way, your response has been noted.. Try growing up a bit as a suggestion from me.
---
Those are balls yo
---
He’s probably get muted for that comment if you report him tbh
---
600m total exp is still a lot lol
---
Slaughter for Kalphs, Expeditious for Trolls.
---
The wiki suggests that darts are the best method of training ranged. At 46 range, is there anything a little more cost effective than rune darts that doesn't sacrifice efficiency too much?
---
the hood is the wrong colour :'(
---
Yeah, out of all these items, to me the dwh price is the most surprising.
---
Thanks mate, I was thinking that as well.. I’ll give it a shot if I don’t like it I’ll just train it up a tad.

---
I watch Netflix and let the game do its thing. Sometimes I drink a prayer pot or fill the cannon.
---
My question is flicking prayers or doing the bracelet switch matter more. Dont have the attention for both. Also, why expedite troll tasks? It's good xp
---
Camp slaughter and piety. Tasks fast anyways.
---
Crazy indeed
---
My question is, who at Jagex modeled this, showed their boss to which the boss said “yea looks good kid, put it in game”?
---
Oh my god I type in the jewelry box all the time. Why am I at the fucking fishing guild?
---
dont care about the mouse aspect but i wanted to know if osrs would crash on ios 13 but you say it doesnt so im not holding back now!
---
You mean 77.
---
Ye could just be add a right click option on the entrance too Peer into the Inferno like how there's a right click option to spectate ToB at the entrance.
---
Everything is low right now and will be all going up after the summer holidays.
---
I thought for the court disclosure osrs earned them more revenue?
---
My question is whether or not prayer flicking is more worth it than switching to these bracelets during these two specific cannon tasks. No one seems to be listening to me. But thanks for the random advice
---
Well, most if not all of these items dont buy for the stated price anymore, so I think a rebound is likely already happening. :P
---
It does seem to be pretty shallow for content. It is called RuneCrafting and the only thing you do is CRAFT RUNES, however, which I guess makes it appropriate.
---
I would definitely like to see an update that changes runecrafting from just making runes to the harvest, redirection, manipulation and control of the forces that make runes. I think this is a strong concept in Warding and if Warding doesn't passive, I'd love to see most of the proposed content featured in an RC update.
---
Dafuq is "Xyz?" And why are the stars on the left side? 10/10 counterfeit.

lol, you don't know how easy it is to find ppls info online do you? ppl aren't careful with it whatsoever
---
annual summer crash + no summer pvm content releasing + panic sellers =  rapidly falling prices. See you in august for the why are prices rising will they continue? question

Considering their IG daily went from literal video game news back in the Machinima days to now focused on financial business decisions, statistics and analytics based in the video game industry, among other industry related news such as worker mistreatment and the rise of a possible industry union: I doubt that is their target audience anymore.

It's a refreshing change of news now that I fall right in middle of the above demographic

What does that mean? Are you saying you don't want to play because you think you'll get hacked?
---
mate , pkers usually only use dstone bolts (e) when pking as its best dps if special hits, so using 2 types of bolts is not worth it as food/prayer is more of a necessity. 
---
staying at vork for 1 more kill with this can make it useful. might as well lock it behind something else in ranged guild if needed besides 200k gp to upgrade if thats the case.
---
Rune Knives are better than Rune Darts and cheaper.
---
right click it and the different bolts pop up, select one to have it be used. change any time from invent or ammo slot
---
Wait, how? I don't know what that meta is
---
Lolol
---
Defensive Shields are basically only used for dragon fire protection unless you use an ely.

Using lunar is the best way to do that. Grind out the 82 magic you need. It's worth it

Upvoted for the username lmao
---
It’s a new skill. No shit it’s going to be very complicated and thought out
---
Apart from the fact that the public knows...
---
Generally 92-99 feels extremely fast compared to 1-92, you have access to the best methods, you can do those methods efficiently, and you're used to the tedium of big XP gaps, each level after that feels like an accomplishment.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee?
---
Uhh what?
---
The average efficient xp/hr in a skill is 675k/hr
---
there's only 2 skills under 100k/hr which are agi at 70k and slayer at 90k/hr and there's tons of skills that are 400k+
---
Yes this is the stuff I stay here for.
---
It was, it’s really simplified now in this doc.
---
I was strongly against it due to it not seeming old school, being complicated, and being broken - but now they’ve really sorted out all my reservations. 
---
I’d highly recommend giving the doc a quick geeze, I think you’ll be surprised.
---
The OSRS Twitter community is absolute aids to begin with. I appreciate all that he does, because my god, does Mod Ash have to respond to some stupid and entitled bullshit on Twitter.

But they do?

also peaches are untradeable so if you do cast it then they get nothing from the kill
---
How does the team feel about an actual in-game gold casino with "slots" and tables, perhaps under the Games Room. It might very well get rid of dicing bots if we have a secure way to throw our gold away, and the gold sink would be enormous.
---
For thematic sake the slots could be flipping over runes to get 3 or 5 in a row, and the tables could be all original ideas instead of blackjack and roulette.
---
I know I would hang out there and watch the conversations, throw gold away, buy a drink and hang out with people.

Hydra, cerb, Venenatis, Callisto, gwd, Cox, Sire. Venenatis sounds ideal for you with Craws bow safe spot although the gp/hr isn't like vorkath and zulrah (very chill though).
---
Should've been warding instead of sailing lol
---
i want it i need it
---
That’s hot
---
Should I be using blowpipe?
---
Why exactly was farming taken out of the warding design document? I can understand wanting to put more of an emphasis on hunter, but it seems strange to completely exclude farming as a source of warding materials. Some kind of magical cotton would make sense as a farming output, and being able to grow some of the trees that give bark would also make sense.
---
You can try to port it over to a modpack. A lot of the modpacks these days have decorative blocks and biomes (chisel and biomes o plenty respectively) that could help darken the swamp. Check out r/feedthebeast if you’re interested

Runecrafting has been getting faster every year through direct and indirect buffs towards the skill. Lavas for example are 30k an hour faster than they were back in 2013 and that's mostly from QOL updates throughout the years. 
---
&gt;pretty much every other skill in the game has evolved? 
---
I'd argue that runecrafting is one of the most updated skills. A new runecrafting method has been added every year since 2015. If you want to complain about skills not being updated do crafting, herblore, or fletching instead. Those skills are trained the exact same way as they were back in 2013.
---
Can we get gem packs added to the Mining Guild to have another use for minerals? Or something else that can benefit the use of minerals other than gloves?
---
why are you not banning bots anymore?
---
Runelite has a farming timer which was expressly disallowed on osbuddy years ago. Then runelite came out and had it and nobody said anything. 
---
The nature of plugins is that people can make whatever they want and realistically there's absolutely no way jagex can expressly decide what is and isn't ok. That's how 3rd party clients work, especially when you have an open source base code to work with.
---
In addition to the other comment, crafting is decently afk if you are at the bank. cannonballs or dart tips for smithing, woodcutting and fletching into arrowshafts is okay too - fletching experience won't be nearly as high as bows but at least you get some xp out of it.
---
Bad quality photo. Not relevant. -10/10 bud.
---
Triste vatos no mames
---
So because a small minority of the game lack the ability to train a skill to 70 (70 magic takes less then a day to get) we should create a skill that will require 40-80hrs, cost anywhere from 50m-300m (estimate) just so that a couple of splashes can have some garbage lvl 20 robes?  Not worth anyone’s time; why you guys can’t see that is beyond me. I’m fine with a new skill coming into the game, but it should have content for all individuals in the game, both noobs, mid lvl, and end game players.
---
comes back about twice a year iirc. you can get a 7-day trial membership if you download the game on mobile, just buy a month of membership, get the trial, then cancel membership so you don't get charged.
---
You mean like Lava runners which is 200k xp/hr?
---
shit dude i wouldn’t touch the game ever again after becoming #1 overall, what is there really to do anymore? collect pets? i cant think of much else at the moment.
---
I’ve got the same chair with the same problem, they just can’t hold shit like they used too

This made me laugh audibly

They said they would add it? but that's last year in August and it still doesn't work

thanks for spoiling  it bro, appreciate it 👌

holy shit some art that actually looks like its from runescape what a miracle!!

have you contacted jagex billing support and asked them to transfer the bond to your osrs account?

TL DR : gay

you're the reason why we can't have nice things/make harmless jokes.
---
If you know there are bots waiting to snipe names why do this... your own fault
---
Xyz monster: stack up 2(+) same level monsters to summon a monster from the extra deck (formerly called fusion deck). Then use those 2 (+) same level monsters as material to activate effects of the newly summoned monster.
---
Synchro monster: tribute one tuner monster (just a regular monster that has tuner next to it's monster type, like effect monsters) and one or more non-tuner monsters whose combined levels add up to exactly the synchro monster. Then summon the synchro monster from the extra deck. For example: to summon a level 8 synchro monster you can tribute a level 1 tuner and level 7 monster.
---
Pendulum: Pendulum monsters have a number called pendulum scale on them. These numbers range from 1-13. You can place two pendulum monsters in the designated slots in your spell/trap zone then summon any monster(s) in your hand and/or pendulum monsters face up in your extra deck. These monsters must have levels between the pendulum scales of your two pendulum monsters put in the spell and trap zone. For example: pendulum monster 1 has a scale of 3 and pendulum monster 2 has a scale of 9; you can put them in the pendulum zones then you can summon monster(s) ranging in levels 4-8. When pendulum monsters are destroyed they are placed face up on the extra deck instead of in the graveyard.
---
Link: Link monsters have a link number. This number tells you how many monsters you have to tribute to summon it. A link-4 monster requires 4 monsters as sacrifice. You can also sacrifice link monsters reduce the number of monsters needed to summon another link monster. You can summon a link-4 monster using a link-2 monster and two other monsters. Link monsters have arrows pointing to the 4 cardinal directions and the midway points. As a new-ish ruling monsters from the extra deck can only be summoned to an extra monster zone or to a place where a link monster's arrow is pointing.
---
thats hilarious, ive actually been shiny hunting recently on ruby, and have always wondered if itd fuck with my rng. 1/8192 chance btw
---
Could we see the introduction of some co-operative content between skillers and pvmers?
---
Maybe introduce a mid level raid targeted at ~lv100 players with rewards comparable to Barrows ect. Skillers would need to fish/hunt food, cut trees, make fires and cook the food inside the raid to provide for the team throughout the duration of the raid. Alongside bosses and the mechanics that pvmers would have to deal with, why not introduce similar challenges for skillers. Instead of just click tree repeat, would you consider adding some challenge there? 
---
Such as the introduction of resources (ores or otherwise) that can only be obtain from some boss (not mined) but a large amount of it be used to create mid-high tier gear.

What does it fix?  You do realize that magic attack from armor is only 20% of the factor for accuracy right?  All the low lvl armor they show is dead on arrival, it’s only saving grace is the 35 prayer bonuse. Outside of that you are still better off with void for welfare, Ahrim for cheap, and ancestral for expensive.
---
Yes same world and everything
---
Not really. The point of the post is that it was originally a comic showing that gay people aren’t identical (which is he exact opposite of homophobia) and is adding a second layer to the comic (and making he post Runescape relevant) by also making the joke that people don’t want to be friends with Ironmen. The part about them being gay is a setup to allow the punchline to be surprising and funnier. I think you seem to believe that the joke is “Ironman Gay lol” which simply isn’t the case.
---
Yes, people want the runners to have access to the largest essence pouch.

Yes. Player against player gambling with dice or whatnot would be perfect. Have x% of the pot get taxed and boom huge gold sink.
---
I can't even get 1 kill LOL
---
It’s basically a buyable, the rewards are unnecessary, and I’m not too pleased with how so many parts of it tie into existing skills when those skills could just receive a revamp.

pretty sure it disappears when the account that dropped it logs out. Use an app cloner next time

Can't lamp runecrafting without Rune Mysteries
---
How is RC not diversified?
---
You have regular runecrafting like air, earth mind etc. Then you can do it via the abyss which is generally faster but through the wilderness and through aggressive mobs, this also doesn't require a tiara.
---
If you don't like that you can do combination runes, these are much higher xp/hr at the cost of being more click intensive. Doing these solo are about 70k xp/hr but come at a cost of turning your chill moneymaker into a click intensive gp loss.
---
Then you have ZMI which is much more afk than regular RC and higher XP/hr but is less profitable. This method also scales with RC level so it can be relevant content at all levels. This method cuts down the amount of pure essence you need and takes away your choice of which runes you get but most of the process is afk.
---
If you need something EVEN MORE AFK we have Zeah RC which is super afk, decent xp rate and okay profit. This is completely different to all other methods requiring no pure essence and being very very afk.
---
Honestly I have no fucking clue how people can claim RC isn't diverse lol.

It's a very enjoyable goal to go for, sure most people wouldn't enjoy it but for me personally its been great. The progression is fun, the being involved in the community is fun, especially twitch, had a great time over the years going for this and met a lot of amazing people too. I cant speak for everyone going for it but for me its definitely not about locking yourself away and just staring at runescape for 15 hours a day. It's also led me to this position as a streamer which i absolutely love doing and wouldn't want to change it, so i have no regrets. Having said that i am looking forward to being done in a couple of months so i can move on to my pvm goals - all pets which i've been excited for for a while now

Yeah but they add other new stuff that people enjoy...

I was never going for a specific rank, i've just been doing what i enjoy (was never in competition with lynx) and the rank is a byproduct of that so im pretty happy with rank 2, plus i feel like rank 2 is a nice position to be at because its up there but all the attention isnt on me, so im very happy with where i'll finish at
---
Blood runes are just a re-colored water runes. Wake up sheeple
---
I highly doubt lynx would come back, he tends to have a pattern of completing his goals and then moving on, would have to wait and see though
---
Yeah, I don't use twitter much at all but I looked through the replies, and holy fuck even a ton of content creators are just straight up assholes on twitter. You can say "I don't like it" but the fact that people are just like "no one likes this, you're wasting your time, you suck" is straight up mean and entirely unproductive.

---
runelite might already do this
---
Yeah I thought that was the rough timeline, only came to your series just before your last episode so wasn’t certain though. In the end any information sharing should be encouraged so you both get the best of what you have at hand
---
wait where's zezima
---
You talk about average age of osrs players being young adults, also the average age grandparents start passing and the age you start making a mark on the world. Everyone should try to have a serious side and a chill side, this isn’t one of the things worth getting bent over
---
Fake. He made it himself. Girls aren't real.
---
Because it is the osrs sub, pvp is apart of osrs that rarely gets posted
---
What did you mean when you said to stay competitive? Just curious, because I have never used an alt. Not because I think they're bad, but rather because I'm lazy 😂
---
But i still think I'm up there in terms of account competitiveness regarding lvls, gear, bank value and pvm skill etc.
---
Wondering what you meant though :p
---
The time spend on making this is equal to a 99. Gf you played yourself
---
I suppose
---
I was just discussing this with some friends and agree. I said to them that the correct way to buff a skill like RC’s xp rates is by offering a way to get a larger pouch. This increases xp rates by increasing total runes crafted per hour while retaining 100% of the effort since you still have to go to the altar, empty the pouch and craft the runes. This method would increase xp rates while maintaining interactivity. Compare this to Zeah RC which cuts interactivity while also still providing competitive XP rates to traditional RC methods.
---
If you're going to insult every other sentence I'm not going to bother trying to have a discussion with you because youre using an edgy facade as a crutch for your poor social skills and your emotional reaponse leads me to feel that any attempt to have a reasonable discussion would end up with you leading your sentences with insults and stupid remarks. If you want to change my mind about this suggestion I'd close my mouth as the op of the post and some awkward basement dweller who can't disagree with some without spewing insults like a salty 12 year old ain't gunna change me mind.

Why not make that site yourself? It is a nice idea.
---

That actually looks pretty efficient tbh
---
When you start going for 200m exp each skill you have to find a way to cut the cost per exp down and the only way to do that without killing your exp per hour is to have alts farming you gold.
---
Oh my god you wrote all that and not a single sentence at all about the bolts Jesus Christ please say something regarding the bolt pouch before I wash my mouth out with a Ruby spec I beg you.

I’m with you on the times, the damage increase seems rather redundant to me. There should be other effects, like earth tome has a chance to poise, water tome has a chance to heal you, and air tome has a chance to dodge next attack.

Outside of my alts buying bonds, what good are they doing for the game?  They only ever see rune dragons lol.
---
Because it's impossible to kill someone who is always safing.  If everyone safed constantly no one would die.  It would just be a bunch of people fighting for a couple minutes and teleporting out.    It's more fun when both people gamble a little.  And pvp world pking is for fun for most people.  It's gambling with some skill.
---
That said, pk however you want, just realize people might not want to fight you again.
---
How are they hurting the game?
---
Im not sure I agree with these choices hahah
---
Pretty shit for the amount of risk it is. When you could get the same just chillin not in the wild
---
Fuuck.. I bought ancestral bottoms like a week ago for like 58 million.. Now they are 49 million.. Daaaamnnn
---
The game has been re-sizeable for 5 years

Best thing to do is keep your hp high and pray the correct prayer

Wow nice one of the ugliest pets though

Fraser tags ash several times daily bitching about the gam/customer support/rwt. Glad to see ash exact some justice on him today.

that last bit really answered my question, thank you

100% drop rate for a baby
---
This is the correct answer.
---
F for the 30m.
---
Well they do bring gp into the game, long term that can be bad. Thankfully everything rune dragons drop is already at high alch value so the damage is already done.
---
You only lost 2m, just buy a bond £4 for 4m with all the money you’ve saved by not having data on your phone in 2019.
---
Hey Jase? That you?
---
Most things that Alta due are at high alchemy prices, and even if they aren’t its stuff the people use all the time if it wasn’t for them some stuff would be super expensive.
---
i also received 12 emblems which are not shown in the total price check
---
Just head to rev caves in 2.2k and you’ll be able to talk to them there
---
What about recovery threats?
---
You aren't going to lose your twisted bow, since you will always protect it.
---
U fukn wot m8.
---
Like already mentioned, you can rebuild at Vork. Brutal blacks become trivial and your dps during raids will improve (olhm final head phase) 
---
Work doing if you can keep certain upgrades archers is a must keep.
---
Just a hunch, but, you’re wrong.
---
If it was worth 70m to buy and you never plan on selling it, the price no longer matters.  Would you rather have the year of use and fun with it or 25m cash?
---
Suggestion: play the fucking game mode that you signed up for.
---
You joke, but really, summoning bad.
---
How about you stop making your life happen, cause clearly you were supposed to die in 2012, right when your brain gave up
---
Keep it up bud. Youre killin it
---
I see clickbait article potential here..
---
Automate it. Others have said how to do it. Add the name you want as a friend. Monitor that friend. When their name changes snatch the name they had.
---
The fact that you are asking "what client do they code for?" is exactly why I'm not going to entertain that  request. You approach this like, again, there are a handful of clients and anything outside of the few you know are non-existent.
---
Even if I cared to tell you their names, which you surely wouldn't know (because why would you?), they would have no desire whatsoever to talk to you, kinda where I'm headed.
---
did someone buy too many logs?

rank 1,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,13,14,15,16,18,19,20 are good skillers. not hey jase

You're once again proving you have no idea what you're talking about.

And you're also proving that you're not reading what I'm typing.
---
Man, this is gonna make for a good slack conversation in the morning.
---
You act like this is a massive community. It's not. It's a tightknit group. Anyone who is anyone knows eachother. Not like there's a whole lot of places to hide. You make Runescape bots? Then you talk to other people that make Runescape bots. Those people are going to give you their opinion on which client has the most dev-friendly API. No coder with a brain would start their own client just because they can.
---
Everyone knows everyone.
---
It's a rather small community filled with toxic pricks, word travels fast.
---
You don't know what you're talking about.
---
You're making shit up.
---
You don't know a single person that writes code for botting Runescape.

---
Crikey dragon cbow has fallen a lot. Anybody have any clue as to why?
---
The reason these are an important factor in balancing the economy is because money is coming in from all sorts of sources. High alchemy, shops, monsters drops etc. Unlike real life where the production of money is very controlled. So gold sinks are a measure against the inflation you'd get if money just kept flooding into the game without a way out.
---
Market bubble popped. Too much supply vs. Demand means that you gotta sell cheaper to make money, but if you don't sell fast enough you'll have to sell even cheaper still and so on and so on. 
---
Other resources which were once less valuable to collect will now be worth more than the crashes item which means they'll begin to be collected while the supply slowly whittles down. Once the supply clears out the demand will soon start causing the price to raise more and more until we're back where we started.
---
“Death penalties” sound so wrong
---
You're right. I don't know anyone who does that. 
---
That want you want to hear?

Huh?

You like that? 
---
Mmm.
---
Fair enough
---
They also leave the swamp.
---
Probably related to people farming rune drags and more coming into the game
---
Where's the roast
---
Be your own judge though, it might not be in their best interest to acknowledge when you're not safing.
---
I genuinely like them even if they have bad rep for being gold farmers and shit.
---
Again, ignoring valid points and latching onto the one area where you can just deny and feel correct.
---
You're pathetic.
---
Reading those twitter replies gave me cancer.

Would the devs ever consider changing slayer blocks to be an "unlock" style system? With the amount of different slayer types we can do now (regular, konar, wilderness) doing blocks is a painful and expensive process and really prevents you from swapping slayer styles.
---
Could blocks become more of an unlock system where once you've paid to block a monster you can toggle them off or on in your blocks? The price could be increased to match.

Gonna need a tl:dr for this one, it's runescape and not a full-on political analysis for heaven's sake
---
OSRS appeals to the same people who played it, it's primarily popular due to nostalgia. How many 13-18 players does OSRS have because I'd wager on not much.
---
If anything, Runescape was made by people in their 20's to appeal to other people with the cursory D&amp;D knowledge probably in their 20's too at the time. It's the same reason a big group of 20/30-somethings are so excited about Halo right now. The same reason Minecraft is/did become the cool thing again.
---
Nostalgia, people growing up and realizing that they still like the same things they liked from childhood. Just ask your parents, music taste, memories of TV, what kind of cars they like, etc, a lot of it comes from childhood.
---
This is way too much of a response for your comment but that's something people say way too much : (

Lvl 99 boss vs lvl 1 crook
---
That's pretty bad.... but not eating-sharks-drinking-pots-killing-Abyssal-sire and getting 600 noted pure essense bad.
---
Of all the skills, even 99 rc hunter has been my lowest skill in the list, right there next to thieving, but thieving will be easy once I get on it.
---
looks like I'll be moving to classic wow when this is released. such a shame.
---
Are you joking?
---
There are 36 of them, out of every account.
---
not rly 2t gold cus most zulrah drops arent alchables, but thats still a shit load of resources
---
Yeah I like it
---
The first and only shiny I ever found was in the Safari zone, magnemite... guess what ran away first cycle.
---
Those skills you mentioned have alternative methods that aren't nearly as bad as RC. Also, I could craft 100 air runes per essence at 77, and would still choose bloods over it, as would 95% of the playerbase. The XP is decided per essence used, not per rune crafted; so it would be horrific to do that. Combine that with the fact dust runes are 3gp due to slayer.
---
"It's nice to have a skill that takes time to get to 99 and requires skill to get maximum rates".
---
There are plenty of skills that take time to get to 99 and require skill to get the maximum rates. That doesn't mean the non-maximum rate methods pre-77 have to be utter shit. Once again; the problem is the scaling. I'll give you another example which stems from the crap xp for runes up to 77. See below the rates for Ourania Altar according to the wiki:
---
40-49 = 27109 xp per hour
---
50-59 = 32126 xp per hour
---
60-69 = 32508 xp per hour
---
70-79 = 34802 xp per hour
---
So the increase in xp from the 40 bracket to the 50 bracket, is more than the increase from the 50 bracket to the 70 bracket. Does anyone want to try and justify that?
---
Lava's can stay the best exp - that's fine. But if crafting bloods is the afk method, ZMI is somewhere in the middle, and lava's are peak insanity, then why is Abyss RC'ing worse XP than all three methods despite lava's being the only more intense method? 
---
My proposed changes would be really simple:
---
Air Runes 5 -&gt; 5xp
---
Mind Runes 5.5 -&gt; 6xp
---
Water 6 -&gt; 7xp
---
Earth 6.5 -&gt; 8xp
---
Fire 7xp -&gt; 9xp
---
Body 9xp -&gt; 10xp
---
Cosmic 8xp -&gt; 11xp
---
Chaos 8.5xp - 12xp
---
Astral 8.7xp - 12.5xp
---
Nature 9xp - 13xp
---
Law 9.5xp - 14xp
---
Death 10xp - 15xp
---
Ourania should be adjusted accordingly with the above rates; scaling around 45k when reaching 77, giving a viable alternative to blood runes for more xp, but more involvement and less profit. Reaching a max of around 50-55k an hour before hitting 99. Still behind lava's.
---
Abyss RCing should be around 40k/hr at 65 (Which the above XP would result in), this would put it at a similar level to ZMI Altar before 77 but requiring significantly more effort with profit as the reward.
---
That’s why I wish there was a runelite plug-in where there is a timer (similar to ToG) over the drop on the floor. It could tell you when it becomes visible to other players and / or when it despawns. Would be huge QoL upgrade
---
It from mean girls you uncultured swine.
---
It just seems that the team is pushing really hard for it, despite most of the people I talk to, and myself, not really wanting it. Well, warding in particular, but I guess a little bit just a new skill in general.
---
I can at least appreciate some of the things they're trying to accomplish with it, though. As is, I would at best vote abstain, but I wouldn't be too upset if it passed. I'd get over it. Funny little thing, though, is that it's basically, for players who care about efficiency, just another buyable skill. Ah well.
---
Sharing your email address on a public platform is a terrible idea. Especially when it contains personal information, such as your name. It doesn't surprise me that they got into your Facebook profile...
---
When you attempt to recover an account it will send an email to the registered email. If you don't have access to it, there is a link directly below the email called "I don't have access to that email address". It will redirect you to the recovery form. 
---
On the recovery form you're asked to enter an email address you do have access to. Jagex will send feedback of your recovery appeal to that email address. 
---
It appears that you regained access to it. But that probably means that Jagex has to resend the recovery link. If you don't get any, there could be an issue with the email provider or the sender is blocked. To solve that you could just go through the recovery form and submit under a different email address (from a different provider).
---
To know which logins (username or email) are under a registered email, all you need to do is go through RuneScape support on this page: https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206811825-Forgotten-login

I'd rather have those memes than shit stories like this.

I'll try once again - lore question:
---
Why are brutal black dragons more rewarding than their king, king black dragon?
---
Or:
---
Is it appropriat to have a king - a unique one of a kind mob - that is less rewarding than a minion?
---
\+ the king even has some kind of risk, as you have to move through the wilderness.
---
what was the thought process when creating brutal black dragons / doing the kbd loot rework? im curious
---
Common thing on mobile
---
Bad design != Being hard
---
My bad then, I just thought it looked funny.
---
I do think it's ridiculous at all. I suspect that making this easier/safer would encourage many more players to partake in these transactions who normally would not be willing to take the risk (not just legitimate gp transaction but illegitimate rwt ones). Increase in demand drives a push for increased supply. 
---
It's possible that this could have some severely negative impacts, such as giving hackers much more incentive to target and hack accounts with rare names, which has already proven to be a big issue in the past.
---
Why doesn’t jagex just ban them.

---
The guy has 4 million Zulrah kills across dozens of account an over 30 years of playtime. People bot skilling for years without getting banned and are in top 50 on highscores. Wake up fool.
---
Same but now it's 107m up from 96 when I checked it &gt;:(
---
The 'muling game' is simply to use a proxy. All of these people have their bots on individual proxies. Jagex doesn't actually investigate these accounts and who they are trading with or anything. They never chain-ban the bots unless they are all on the same IP.
---
The same with the mule bot. It just trades with the other bots. There's no weird secret undetectable drop trading or staking technique to prevent bans. Jagex just does not investigate it.
---
I dont blame you, it's only cute for so long.
---
Yeh survivors like all the bots with over 120 mil exp in any skilling method in top highscores that have been botting the same account for years lmao.
---
as if woodcutting to 90 (redwood) takes any less time.
---
moreover, you can even make money with slayer at lower lvls. just do wildy slayer / konar. dont act like slayer is hard to achieve. every noob i see has 75+ slayer. 
---
'bossing requires skill' actually most bosses do not require skill. king black dragon, venenatis, calisto, crazy archelogist, Bryophyta, Kraken etc etc etc
---
How did u lose it?
---
It's difficult to compare it to other skills because it's hard to find like-for-like comparisons. I didn't want to compare xp/hr rates, but rather point out what I consider to be a flaw in how the xp barely increases up from air to death. If I was to compare another though, how about the gnome agility course providing 8k/xp at level 1,  and seers rooftop providing an 45k/hr (assuming no-diary, so being generous) at level 65. That's over 5.5x the exp.
---
My proposition would be to increased the xp per rune starting from water to death.
---
The Abyss is redundant. XP rates are worse than the Ourania altar. It gives less xp, is more involved, and provides mediocre profit very few care for.
---
At this level, the profit is small anyway - there is no giant pouch pre-75, and we're talking 2k runes an hour paying reasonable attention. That's no more profit than it is making tele-tabs on an alt in world 30.
---
From 27-77, the options should be:
---
(1) Ourania altar, as it is, but slightly more xp in the 50-77 range, which currently scales horribly and is barely better than at level 40. When reaching 77; the xp/hr should be at the 40k/hr mark.
---
(2) Abyss method, providing just slightly lower XP rates, but more profit and for more involvement. 
---
Currently, crafting nats, laws, or death runes through the abyss from 50-75 provides about 16 to 20k xp/hr, and around 400k/hr profit. Nobody in their right mind will do this over Ourania if they don't want to do lava's as it currently stands. This method should be about 30k xp/hr.
---
(3) Lava's as they are now, unchanged and still the best exp.
---
Then post 77, the options should be:
---
(1) Bloods etc, as the afk method as they are now, netting the current 38k xp/hr or so.
---
(2) Abyss RC'ing, netting around 45k xp/hr and still making some profit, but not as much as bloods. being way more involved than bloods, but branching the gap between Blood's and Lava's while still making reasonable profit.
---
(3) Lava's, as they are now, unchanged and still the best exp.
---
This could also be achieved by providing a small xp drop upon entering an altar, proportional to a players RC level, specifically 3 x the RC level before 77, and 4 x the RC level after 77. 
---
At level 65 this would be 195xp. Meaning an extra 10k xp/hr through the Abyss. 
---
At level 90 this would be 360xp, meaning an extra 18k xp/hr through the Abyss.
---
Wrath would still be the most profitable and more xp than double deaths despite this change. Double Nats could now be a good option from 91-95.
---
 opposed to changing the xp per rune. Most players will still choose Ourania pre-77, and bloods post-77, but this provides a viable alternative for a little more involved runecrafting journey, while not affecting the viability of Lava's.
---
Easy to say, but how would you go about doing that? Pretty sure Jagex know the detriment that bots pose to the health of the game and are trying their best to stop them.
---

---
I always thought of the messenger as a unique part of the quest and not as something tedious or annoying, I got it in the middle of the wilderness while killing the crazy archaeologist with my friend it was pretty funny.
---
7k per sip? Where’s your maths come from.
---
I used super combats whilst training my pure at low levels because a +8 or whatever boost to my attack and strength actually makes makes a dramatic difference to XP per hour. And the +5 yo defence actually makes you take less damage for X amount of time.

Doesn't matter! You got the Lumby elite challenge done before MEP2P2
---
Nah fam I'm at 94 and have made 44m since 72, expecting another 30m or so before 99.
---
You also have to do the Amishthalin Amishtery quest.
---
Damn, Pokemon are finding weird places to go after not being allowed into Galar
---
But those are free runes just waiting to be crafted.
---
Make the Dagon'Hai robes require 20 defence, not 30, that's my only qualm with this, everything else i like.
---
Your acc is obviously complete trash. Also if the average was 675k/hr itd be like 7k hours for 200m all, yet its 16k+ ehp?
---
thoughts on this unit trashing you with facts and logic?
---
Smokey does it again
---
Devalues my high total level
---
I believe the wiki has some good articles, though I don't think it has one that has everything in one place. There is a RS timeline though.
---
Did you quest your att levels? Just asking cause 1 day old account lol.
---
10. Lol.
---
I was smiling the whole time through this. This made my day, five times over. 
---
Pokémon x RuneScape = OmegaNostalgia
---
So tell me how are u gonna get 4.6b xp in 6800 hours? If you do so ill give u 10 million dollars.
---
Everything actually started to go up today.
---
The data is out there, its just held by the botter. I track a majority of my ban data to determine when I need to do major mule calls, as Jagex follows many patterns in what they do and when they do it.
---
I meant biggggerrrt
---
Look at RS3's stone spirits to see how it plays out to demonize pvmers. Nobody profits.
---
this question has probably been asked and answered. But would we be able to get loadout presets added to our banks, this would mean saving a gear setup equipped and inventory sorted by the click of a loadout sllot
---
Just so you know chasing the American dream doesn't count as exercise.
---
Right now my car is stalled out and I'll be late or work, but I'll be damned, I still have a reason to smile today
---
What exactly doesn't make sense about what I said?
---
Since you’re never gonna get the name back can you tell us what it was
---
Elaborate.
---
This is a game changer like dab cartridges
---
Ok but there's no way that ice burst would have landed wearing full melee gear.
---
You must be fun in yearly staff reviews
---
Its a piece of shit move real or not
---
Can somebody post the text in the comments for people at work? Thanks in advance
---
how do you get far enough into the game to cut mages and still don't understand basic RuneScape economics? sounds fishy lol
---
LOL I love Venezuelans man.
---
ever thought theres nothing wrong with it?
---
So we have raw data now on how dumb our community still is. Half of the active player base is still stupid enough to not even have a 2FA
---
I can't wait to vote no on the poll.
---
The hard part is finding effects that don't overlap with Ancients. Smoke Poisons and Blood Heals so probably shouldn't use that. Earth could stun, reduce the opponent's defence, increase your defence, or such. Air could stun (knock back) or perhaps just attack a speed faster (with reduced damage to balance). Water is tricky; can't exactly make your opponent slip, blood does healing, and ice is a separate thing.
---
I'm fun everywhere I go, bitch.
---
Yes because the underground pass is horrible, you have to suffer through the quest still so that doesn't change, but then after your life should get easier. I mean in reality who ever goes back to that place after the quest is done? I think I remember going there maybe twice after for some reason I don't remember (a clue?). 
---
I voted no to mep2 stuff because that changes the quest and how it is supposed to be.
---
Stonks
---
With blizzard you legit send proof of your Driver's license/State ID to get into your account. Would this be realistic to implement, at least as an option?
---
You have to understand some items are billions of gp and take years to earn. When your past 4 years of effort are stolen from you it's heartbreaking. I would gladly risk being unable to play my account for a few days if it meant it were more secure.
---
Authenticator delay is mostly security theater. If your email address is secure you don't need it.
---
You ran from a level 57... noob!
---
I like how I have to suffer because of the dumb people who lose there phones. Thanks jamflex
---
What if jagex established their own email service for accounts, e.g. cow1337pwner (at) jagexplayer that had really high reqs to setup? And it was the only way to have an account?
---
Reqs: 2fa, hard password to brute, IP locked , gov ID. 
---
I mean wouldn't this slow down/stop bots/gold farmers as well as protect users?
---
Apple doesn't allow calling it a click, apparently. If you want to instruct players on using your app, you should call it a tap. So they had to literally go to every "click here" in the whole freaking game and swap for "tap here" in order to be accepted into the iOS store
---
Lmao
---
Finally a step in the right direction! Kudos to the osrs team...this should've taken priority over adding a new skill into the game anyday! Looking forward to more changes to come :D
---
Looked through your posts--you're the one who made OSRS takes a sip and Maintenance day.. Now this. You are the true OSRS Video Mak'n Lord. Nice.
---
Ahh that makes sense.
---
I just want a mimic already for the stupid music track, I don't even want loot. Gz though.
---
Any chance of even rough timeline estimates for some of this stuff, like authenticator delay?
---
I believe you're looking into it but it's unclear if this is something on a weeks, months, or years timescale.

Whilst it is also his job, and how he makes a living.. Addicted yes, but 11 hours a day when it's what you do for work kind of slightly justifies it
---
at least they are doing something. But saying that auth delay needs to be investigates is just... over the line...
---
sounds about right it's either you get it or you don't

No worries, we all started out the same and we're a friendly bunch.

No, I don't think I will.

Yeah no, with possibility of more mod "jeds" working there we should not be sending info like that to jagex

NASA discovered time travel via wormhole last night. This post is from the future. Also, invest in "BlipCoin" in 2022. You're welcome.
---
Sought out this thread to express a similar thought
---
Assuming the recovery system is mature enough to detect other people trying to get your account.
---
But yeah, I've never seen a delay being implemented. Google, Amazon, Microsoft... No one has one. Because if accounts are getting compromised, it makes more sense to fix the problem than make a fake failsafe
---
Plus all the downsides like having a hacker use the delay against you, or being locked out of your account and lose membership time...
---
Wow. Just sounds like Apple thinks its consumer base are retards. Like if they encountered "click here" it wouldn't be obvious what that meant and they'd just be like "Where's the mouse on this iPhone Xrs42?!?!"
---
How is it even profitable, private proxy's are not free and it only takes 1 ban to get the IP flagged, and if you try to use any public proxy's most likely it is already flagged
---
I doubt that would go any better. For one, they are already doing something similar with the upcoming Gauntlet so repeating it as a skill may not go over well. Also, Dungeoneering was heavily criticized as a skill back in RS2 so I doubt that would change much. And lastly, there is a lot of stigmas around Dungeoneering, mainly the rewards, so if they were to poll Dungeoneering, even if they changed the reward (which they'd partly have to do since we got some through other means) there would still be some opposition (and support) on name alone without looking into the exact version being offered.
---
That said, I'd personally love to see a new skill with elements from Dungeoneering. What I wanted out of Sailing was an Exploration skill; I've talked about it a bunch but pretty much it would be a skill about exploring the different locations and dungeons like Slayer is about training on different monsters and like Slayer unlocks new monsters, it would unlock new areas, including new expansions to old dungeons. While I'd love part of such a skill to be seafaring, I could see one of the main training method being similar to Dungeoneering where there are themed dungeons around the world (frozen, desert, jungle, volcanic, etc) that you unlock at certain levels and explore for exp. Perhaps that will be a reality someday, but after Sailing failed I still don't see that style of skill gaining a ton of support right now.

Player Support - Account Security Blog
---
25 June 2019
---
Welcome to the second in a series of four blogs from the Jagex Support Team. In our first, we detailed plans to upgrade our systems. This blog is about Account Security and will examine:
---
What we're working on now:
---
    Strengthening passwords
---
    Breached password usage warnings 
---
Coming soon
---
    Email notifications and validations for account behaviour changes
---
    Authenticator checks on the website
---
    Investigating if we should implement an authenticator delay 
---
And in the future:
---
    Additional account security systems
---
    Increasing account recovery security 
---
Account security is a challenge for all businesses on the internet. The number of websites to which people submit personal data, and the frequency of efforts to access this data, means that breaches are happening ever more frequently.
---
It's therefore no surprise that improving account security comes with some major challenges. But we are nonetheless committed to overcoming them, although we must also be realistic - these changes will take time.
---
Here's a detailed look at the various challenges with account security and how we're going to solve them.
---
Better Passwords
---
Our first priority is to strengthen passwords, and work is already underway.
---
We’re updating our systems to allow more complex passwords to be set, and adding user guides that help users create them. We're also looking into how we can support password managers.
---
Work with a third-party provider is underway to implement a system which searches the internet for breached password data. That way we can warn you if you’re using a password that might not be safe, or even stop you from choosing an insecure password in the first place.
---
We really need your help on this, as these new systems will only benefit you if you choose to use them. In general, when it comes to password security, the essential things to remember are:
---
    Never use the same password for your RuneScape/Old School account as you do for your email
---
    If you are in any way concerned about your account safety, then set a new password immediately
---
    Use a different password for every service you use online 
---
Email Notifications and Security
---
Once password security is improved, our focus will shift to email notification.
---
One of the quickest ways you can confirm you’re the owner of an account is by using the email address registered to it. This is a very common security method you have likely seen on other sites.
---
We're going to start sending email notifications to your email address if we see strange changes in account behaviour, and in some circumstance we will require authorisation from that email address to login.
---
However, the risk of using emails for security is that we don’t know if your personal email address is secure. And if the login details for your email are the same as your RuneScape/Old School account, then you’ve made it twice as easy for someone to find all the details they need.
---
Essentially, the more secure your email address is, the more secure your RuneScape account is. If your email provider has extra security features like 2-factor authentication, then please use them (here are the links for Google, Yahoo and Outlook).
---
Ultimately, these problems mean that in the long-run we want to move away from email and toward improved 2-factor authentication.
---
2-Factor Authenticators
---
One of the most secure things you likely own is a smart phone. Some have biometrics built in, most have additional password security and importantly people are generally very protective of them.
---
We therefore want to use the security of your phone more to keep your RuneScape/OldSchool account safe, and the way to do that is 2-factor authentication (2FA) apps.
---
Do note that we already offer 2FA and it is currently used by about 50% of active players. If you haven't already done so, then please setup 2FA as soon as possible ! Our aim is for all of our players to use an authenticator and for it to apply to the game and website logins.
---
One feature often requested by players is authenticator delays. There are several ways we could do this, such as delaying change requests or temporarily limiting trades. We haven’t ruled anything out just yet, but are mindful that there is a big risk of players getting locked out of their accounts or enduring restrictions if their phones are lost in the interim.
---
We must also support users who need to change authenticator because they've lost access to their phone. These change requests already happen more times a day than Player Support could handle if they had to check everyone individually.
---
Our preferred option, therefore, is additional account security systems.
---
Additional Security and Account Takeovers
---
We’re looking into additional security checks using the same type of technology used to tackle payment fraud. This system will allow us to react to new threats in real time, create different security models for different states of a RuneScape account (e.g. active player, dormant account, not email registered, authenticator supported etc...), and respond sufficiently fast to avoid the blocks that an authenticator delay could create.
---
We believe this data driven account security method is our best chance to tackle account takeover. It can work for all accounts and for all players. However:
---
    If for whatever reason you can’t use 2FA, this will be your backup to protect your account. As a result, though, it will take a few seconds to run checks every time you login so users might encounter a slight delay.
---
    This system will check millions of logins every day, and it would be wrong of us to assume it will get it right every time. Striking the right balance between brevity and security (in other words, letting the right users in and keeping the illegitimate users out, all without creating too much of a delay) will be a process, and we're unlikely to get it right straight away. We will be doing extensive testing before going live to perfect this, but please be patient with us. We are looking at how you’ll be able to contact us and resolve the situation ASAP if you do get incorrectly blocked.
---
    If all goes to plan then this should all just happen without you ever seeing it or having to worry about it - unless you’re trying to steal someone’s account, of course. For that reason we won't be regularly updating players on progress.
---
    The build and setup is going to take some time. This is a key priority for Jagex so it will be ready as soon as possible - current estimates point to a rollout in the first half of 2020. Despite the challenges, we think the benefits are worth overcoming the issues. 
---
Recovery Abuse
---
One of the biggest challenges we face when reviewing account recovery attempts is identifying if the request has been submitted by the account owner.
---
&gt;Our focus for the next year is on stopping the hijackers before they even get to an account, but regardless we need to improve how we process account recovery attempts. This may mean that appeal information requirements become stricter. It’s going to take some time to find that right balance between safety and swiftly getting players back into the game. At the moment we don’t feel we have it quite right, so work will continue on this.
---
From The Team:
---
We understand how important account security is to you all, just as it is for us - we hear everything you're saying. And while we can't fix it overnight, we won't stop until things get better. We'll keep you posted on our progress but please keep talking to us, please keep sharing your concerns and please keep offering your suggestions. We're committed to doing everything we can.
---
Thanks,
---

Authenticator codes are locally stored. If you lose your phone, you need to re-set the authenticator.

If you add in 15 extra essence from 3 rune pouches that's still only about 3 times the exp of making airs per trip.
---
Could you imagine in 2007 a 14 year old you bout to beat his meat and you're so into RuneScape you praise zezima.
---
The key word here is they're saying they're going to "investigate". I think at this point they don't need to do any research into the matter and just add it. Players have been asking for this for an incredibly long amount of time.
---
You havent unlocked this area yet
---
*Nintendo has left the chat.*
---
Yeah this is madly concerning imo. These questions are basically just straight ezscape at the expense of completely changing a quest line. Changing items needed from 50 to 12 for MEP2? Come on. I had to collect those and it wasn’t that bad, and Ironman mode came out long after this quest did. Really makes me wonder how many people just open up polls and blindly vote yes to everything.
---
Zulrah bots are kinda crazy to think about. Like, sharks are a heavily botted item. so these zulrah bots are buying sharks from minnow fishing bots, and probably addy darts from bots as well. Like, would a bot only server actually just have a functioning economy with different bots doing most of the major content?
---
Yeah I was trying to maintain my straight face, but "Scape Ball" made me lose it
---
Dutch people are the fucking worst
---
I voted yes to the top one because why not make some people's lives a bit easier, and it's compatible to other short cuts eg the cart to shilo village.
---
I feel like some people get hung up on not making things easier than how they were back early rs2 days, but really there were other very similar things put in place for other areas of the game. People just overlook them because they were always there.
---
You know its fletching, not fetching, right?
---
I have no personal experience, but I would imagine that a phishing website would ask for the bankpin (and authenticator code) **after** the victim entered their login username/email and password.
---
This would mean their current password has been compromised and needs to be changed. It should be obvious, but you might want to include that somewhere. 
---
I would prefer if we also could get some kind of notification of failed login attempts. Attempts where the password is correct, but got stopped by the authenticator. Another notification for when the bankpin has been entered incorrectly several times and got stopped by the limit.
---

No he doesn't. He moves back and forth. You dspear the knight into the room, he isn't meant to be over that far so he doesn't move south. As long as no one is blocking the east or west spaces, he will continue to walk side to side. If you keep the camera low, facing West, and spam click his waist, he'll never despawn and you never have to move your mouse/finger except to open pouches. I've done 55-99 twice and only use that spot.
---
Just hop to pvp world

You tried to trade an Ironman.

Lol in what world is herblore considered very afk?
---
What is a screenshot button?
---
As someone who forgot to disable 2FA on multiple sites and reset their phone, no one has a delay.
---
Discord gives you backup codes when you start.  If you lose those codes your account is gone forever.  
---
Robinhood also uses backup codes, but does have a way for you to send a photo of government issued ID to prove you own the account if you lose those codes.
---
Authenticator delay does nothing but delay how long it takes for someone to get in.  If someone is at the point of being able to request it turned off you've already lost.  That account is done forever.  Authenticator delay is a non-issue distracting from real problems with account security

People complaining about losing bills  - I sell my bank to gear up for zulrah attempts and even still I'm in poverty gear

RuneScape doesn't use SMS 2FA, it uses a software tokens for 2FA. Has nothing to do with banks using SMS 2FA.

---
Wait hespori has a pet?
---
just throwing ideas out there, may give others inspiration for other ideas/suggestions :)
---
Apple knows their market
---
Looks better than Sword and Shield so far.
---
My reasoning was that people beat the quest, so why not add shortcuts to make other run throughs easier? Or in the case of the death altar change, improve the design to not waste people's time
---
Lmao my brain is just too small to comprehend the censoring in this photo.
---
I primarily use Reddit mobile so it’s easier for me just to take a picture.
---
I created an osrs account in 2018 and stopped playing after a few months. I logged in today and was prompted to create a new account and start again in tutorial island?? The email is definitely the same one I was using in 2018 as I have archived emails from the monthly updates. There are no active offences on my account but is it possible that this is a ban?
---
Q
---
The damage is lower, so the XP per hour is lower.
---
Why am I so aroused

Ash is the pinnacle of memers.
---
I primarily use Reddit mobile so it’s easier for me to take a picture.
---
If I remember right, I voted yes to 6,7, and 9. Question 9 doesn't mention it here, but in the Dev Blog it notes how it wouldn't make the quest easier; they said it was for RCing but no one would go in that way... But there is already a back entrance if you forget to rotate the mirror and the final mirror rotation wouldn't make the quest easier since you have to solve the puzzle before it matters anyway. So this would make it a little less frustrating if you forgot to rotate it the way you needed before leaving.
---
As for the shortcuts, I understand those are more opposed of ideas, but they already exist in game. There are two pipes with grates that you can only enter from one side, but instead of unblocking the grate, it just spits you out further back in the dungeon with no option to go back. While I'd assume those are meant to make it easier to leave, their design is not what you'd expect from OSRS; if you see a blocked tunnel on the way in, you'd probably expect you could unlock it as a shortcut later on. I can't remember if they give a clear warning they are one way either; at the very least I think they should do that. But I think it makes sense to unlock shortcuts like that as you progress rather than to be one way and at the very least, they should be more clear they are one way (e.g. a slope you can't climb from the bottom but that you can slide down from the top; a lot clearer that you can't "unlock" it than grate on a pipe).
---
That said, the second shortcut would save a fair bit of hassle and the thieving door is kinda already a shortcut past the section. It would probably be better to change that shortcut to something that is more clearly one way, like the above slope example. But the first shortcut really isn't that much of a time saver; all it does it allow you to skip the first rope swing and the grid puzzle after you completed it. I'd also say it is kinda bad design to make a player solve a grid puzzle and then make them remember it for later with no clear indication they'll need to know it later. Perhaps you could argue that is part of the annoyance of the quest, but even if you do note it down for Underground Pass, there is a good chance most players discard their note before Regicide, especially given the forced time gap between the quests. I still have mine saved in a paint file because I know it will probably come up again someday in the future, so letting players solve the puzzle once and get a shortcut to skip it seems fine by me; the shortcut wouldn't even save that much time since the grid is 100% success if you do note down the solution unlike the second shortcut's agility maze which does have more chances to fail.
---
Another thing to note is that the shortcuts would speed up recharging the Iban's Staff... Not saying that is a good or bad thing, but it is something a lot of players probably weren't considering (or maybe they were and that is why it got so much support). That said, I have no idea why skipping the pass in Regicide got so much support. You're supposed to suffer the entire dungeon again as part of that quest and there is even dialog referencing it (something like "those traps don't get any easier"). Even if shortcuts made it quicker, you should have to deal with those jumps of doom one last time.

Blocked Fraser on Twitter just so see them on reddit instead zzzz

I'm at 46 but it's so insanely boring to level I don't know when I will increase it.

I'll take the 100m. Just sold one for 110m.

Life is xp waste then? Damn man I need to make sure to become a lich necromancer then. And possibly turn jMods the undead to make sure they are making content forever.
---
Is is lower for ALL types of enemies? I played rs3 way too much and in rs3 it depends on the enemy.
---
Not even close to that, selling gp in huge quantities is usually 0.4-0.5 per mill.
---
That also doesn't account for any accounts he's had banned with gear/loot on it or any mules banned with millions/billions of gp.

I had just finished Kandarin Medium Diary at level 61 agility and run about 15 laps before he appeared which according to the wiki is 1 in 33,680 chance
---
Falador Elite was done.
---
How can someone sit in this abomination? Literally take a month break from the game and spend that $11 on a new chair.
---
I think there are a few cases (like quest monsters) where the type matters. Other than that just stick with fire.
---
Thanks! Just wish this luck translated to the rest of the game...

I'm not even sure if you are trolling at tgis point. I even specifically said that the average EHP rate when looking at skills WHEN NOT TALKING ABOUT TIME SPENT DOING THE SKILL TO 200M.
---
Also you're a main with like 500m xp right? :D
---
I just watched a player kill another player. The player that got the kill is, by definition a pker. This was a fight between 2 pkers.
---
Ok thx.
---
I look forward to upvoting your cry to Jagex, when the time comes.
---
Great edit! I would low key love it if the Pokémon low health alarm was put into osrs imagine the goblin boy stress levels then
---
Hol up what
---
People do suggest Sekiro to be made easier you dolt 
---
You're crying like people wanted to remove the quest.  All the question asked was should you be able to skip the subsequent trips through you had to make for regicide.  Think for two seconds would ya
---
Voted no btw
---
It doesn't make sense to complain about something for which there is no realistic solution.
---
Btw
---
Honestly they're destroying the games economy and breaking the rules I wish the mod team would ban them all
---
Would it be worth doing with your gear setup (except firecape instead) and 85/97/85 melees?
---
What herbs should I do for money? Rannar’s?
---
So... 2fa?
---
If they crafted themselves, it would actually be a good drop.
---
Delicious, finally, some good fucking content
---
Thankyou!
---
Zulrah is far harder to learn than Vorkath, but far easier to do when you do learn it or at least for me due to the rotations always being the same depending on what spawn you get. Vorkath is entirely random, but the loots are very comparable. If you're just trying to make some quick gp and not spend weeks questing I'd recommend Zulrah.
---
If they aren't salted, which the should be. The only way it makes sense is if it's only compared on use, and a temporary unsalted hash is generated then passed (in partial form) to a third party that returns all breached hashes that start with the provided value then the requesting system (Jagex in this case) is responsible for checking that list to see if the full hash is present.
---
Even managed to T pose in front of the killer, standard Claudette play.
---
Oh. My. This is incredible.
---
You coulda logged back into the original account and picked it back up if you did it within a couple minutes or however long it takes to despawn
---
[I see squirrel but where is moose?](https://media.giphy.com/media/OpSB5dvAhrDmo/giphy.gif)
---
i think Zulrah would be quicker, seeing how i desperately need a solid money making source.
---
If it’s imbued no, because you lose some points. I dunno too much dude, you can down grade. 
---
Try watch a guide on YouTube for set up or use wiki.
---
Some people even use elite void or void.
---
You stats are good to go though, just need to work out gear.
---
Good luck, dude.
---
I also hear 99 agility helps, so try that.
---
It will at peast give you a heads up that something is going on, and let you cancel the auth cancel as well as at least change your email password. If at that point you are too stupid to secure your email properly then that fault is no longer in jagex's hands. 
---
I have 2factor on my acct, and all of my emails and i have had no issues with gmail yet, but when i had hotmail someone bypassed the hotmail 2factor and tried to reset my password. They didnt get my rs account, but they got my spotify account. Shit happens and breaches happen, but if you add in time gates it allows for you the player to react and get things secured before you lose everything. If i lose my phone i have more important issues than just not being able to log into rs for 3 days.
---
I'm well aware of that, but at least if it is converted to one case and stored as even a hash then that is some indication that it's not a simple plaintext comparison, not that changing the case fully invalidates a plaintext comparison
---
made me laugh
---
This is the best thing ive ever seen on this subreddit
---
Oh i feel dumb lol. Forgot it gave farm xp....
---
&gt;Why does this chair have no seat? And what... is in his ass?!
---
Just me bossing in the Wilderness which is a pvp area where anyone can attack and kill you. (Not a place to make friends) I talked to him and we started killing the boss together. Sorry thought I was clear enough from my title.
---
It's worth it. Also the sooner you learn to enjoy questing the sooner you'll be done with it.
---
Doesn't mean anything in this context. It always was used to describe when your account was a product of something be it pest control, effigies, nightmare zone etc.
---
To be fair, overhauling security is one thing that should absolutely not be rushed. Rushing security changes is just asking for it to be fucked up and open holes rather than close them.
---
Oh you like that yellow script on that black background dont ya bud 😉
---
PHONE NUMBERS
---
There is and there isn't. Someone wrote the plugin last year and made a pull request to merge it into Runelite, but it never got reviewed or approved. It's not perfect, which is probably why it didn't get merged in, but I have it running on my RL client since I compile it myself and it's pretty handy. Not sure if/when we'll see it in the normal release of RL, since the code sitting in the pull request is hella out of date and someone would have to update it first.
---
How about... no.
---
Also couldn't be used with a Tome of Fire if you're worried about Surge max hits.
---
Yeah dude didn't you see the Warding doc? April 2020
---
Think you mean autists
---
With NPC contact you can slayer ring to Nieve (closest slayer master to a teleport) and use her to skip tasks, continue to contact Dura until you land on a good task.
---
Wouldn't really bother with this if you don't have occult altar though, gem mine teleport is good enough for the most part.
---
I hope this doesn't flood splashing bots all over the world. Lumbridge is already bad enough. They need to re think the splashing aspect imo.
---
that fucking gmaul when he breaks out of the poke ball holy shit
---
You were. he's dumb
---
Now we know why he’s shit at basketball. He’s always playing OSRS.
---
Bro like dragon crossbow is only like 6 range attk different to rune cbow. Definetly get a blowpipe I reckon u will get 4 kills or so.
---
But I think you will need to change your set up as u won’t be able to carry a shield.
---
Watch a few guides and do whatever you can do stop using the dragon crossbow at vork lol, only dhcb is worth it( maybe armadyl also)
---
Who is this “we” you speak of. A lot of people do want it, so don’t lump everyone into your opinion.
---
Elite void is great and you get a good prayer bonus as well as extra damage.
---
Withdraw a 1 dose stamina during certain coal runs and do 3 to start off the cycle, it'll save you the inventory slot while doing mithril runs. What the other people said is good, you should be banking as fast as physically possible. This video for concepts you can apply to mithril bar making, such as click timings and banking method. If you want accurate screen markers, you can use runelite to draw them and then use mouse keys to move pixel by pixel
---
Very cool
---
this is actually pretty horrifying
---
I guess. you got 2m in the bank, i assume you're doing miscellania, battlestaves, and/or herb runs? I just used those to fund slayer and questing until i got my qpc. instead of grinding a shitty money maker (or inefficient zulrah), you can just break even til you can do vorkath then make a lot more money a lot faster. feels more macro efficient but that's mostly because I don't enjoy zulrah. If you were good at him and got it down pretty quick then yeah sure.
---
Really gonna gatekeep spending 20k hours rather than 20.5k hours on 4.6b lul
---
Woo Wooooooooo wooo wooo wo wooo woo
---
laws are worth 1k don't you know
---
Dude you are way too mad about this
---
Rune drag ALTs and it's pretty damn good on olm melee hand.
---
Around 50 kills.
---
Wow, this was amazing production quality. The hand drawn scenes with the book made it seem like the start to an adventure movie! Like Shrek. With production like that, I don't care what you do, I'll watch it. Keep it up man!
---
They have not postponed anything, warding isn't finished so it hasn't been polled yet
---
Are you saying that requiring at least 1 capital, 1 lowercase, and 1 number does not allow "simple" passwords? Because Password1 literally meets that criteria.  
---
The best thing they could do to increase password safety is simply increase the minimum number of characters because the standard practice of 1 capital, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 symbol, minumum of 8 characters is complete garbage.  
---
At a certain point it isn't the company's responsibility to enforce good password practices. Their responsibility should be in regards to how those passwords are stored and transmitted.
---
I had assumed this was an Ironman which should show the old tomes as well I believe since they are only obtainable that way. I guess I'm either wrong about the Ironman part or maybe the log doesn't work that way for wintertodt.
---
Don't know why people want the game to be easier when runelite already vastly reduces the difficulty of many runescape mechanics, questing included.
---
oil pens are an absolute miracle, man. I worked third shift (11 PM - 9 AM) and without the ability to take frequent breaks to walk around the outside of the building with my buddy, look up at the night sky and take massive oil pen rips, I probably would have david carradine'd myself in a utility closet
---
I just got 14 addy ore and 3k cash from vorkath. Not quite as bad but definitely shocking
---
I'm convinced it is worth it but your kills will be a bit slower, so keep that in mind.
---
It would be possible though
---
Nice to see your second to last flip, but now I wanna see the last one. What was it?? The suspense is killing me.
---
you using a dcb or a dhcb? elite void isn't going to make enough of a difference to consistently get another kill, but with dhcb and regular void I get 3 kills per trip minimum assuming im not stoned as shit.
---
definitely get elite if you can, but dhcb and rigour will be muuuuch bigger upgrades.
---
r/theperfectpokemongame
---
Wintertodt absolutely blows Hunter XP out of the water until what, 3-ticking Black Chins? You can pull a couple hundred K/gp per hour out of Wintertodt and it's dead fucking easy and far less effort than actually chinning or even salamanders. 
---
I must have played a different version of Wintertodt than everyone else here, because Runelite literally flashes and gives you desktop notifications when your character stops their actions. It's dead easy and if you eat twice a game you won't die. Click on the bruma roots or the brazier and you've got 30 seconds to argue about the definition of afk on r/2007scape. Click again if your screen flashes. It's a million times easier than chins, which require sweaty effort to match xp rates.
---
Honestly no authenticator delay has been hella rad when I've switched phones
---
Ivestigating lmao it doesnt need a fucking investigation
---
None of these are quality of life. These are all ez scape. You guys keep hiding ez scape updates behind quality of life
---
What is authenticator delay?
---
Yes but just like the real purge where grenades and explosives were restricted. I figured that hard achievements should be preserved.
---
It's mind boggling anybody voted yes. None of these quests would be special if they didnt have the cancer. If you can't do these, you don't deserve the elf city. Glad they failed
---
Sick!
---
How do you people not realize that hes a skiller
---
You can disable the authenticator for your account from the web portal without needing to use the authenticator. That's why it is currently useless on accounts. It's literally the entire issue of the OSRS version of 2fa.
---
Farming is probably the least grindy skill :D
---
why care about net worth if you plan on keeping it anyway?
---
see it as somewhat ironman, once you get it, you keep it
---
This was fucking amazing. I need a part 2
---
Doesnt matter if ironman it doesnt work from before the log.
---
There is plenty of bank space. If it’s such an issue for you, make Allen alt to store stuff.
---
I don't have an answer for you but just letting you know i got an osrs shirt last christmas and it was a very nice, high quality t-shirt (not super thin and cheap); nice print and fit really well. Best purchase, definitely worth waiting for... hope they restock soon
---
Very nice! Great work
---
Some of these are baffling
---
lmao thats ninja
---
What are you talking about. How does it make it harder when I have to waste my time clicking on obstacles that I’ll pass anyways?! It’s just annoying and 10 minutes of my life that are basically wasted
---
I'm gonna let my Butterfree in your Meowth
---
My suggestion is add the bank pin to the first trade on the account and/or first item drop (the same way you need it for the first bank transaction). Then if someone gets a hold of the account they can't take your current gear or inventory.
---
Camp Horno here.
---
Only 50% of the playerbase even use 2FA. How is this a win when literally half of all the people you see logging in are too stupid to enable the feature in the first place?
---
What good is an authenticator delay if we don't even use the authenticator to begin with?
---
TURN ON THE GODDAMN AUTHENTICATOR YOU FUCKIN NEANDERTHALS.
---
As someone who also hates agility it's worth it, not just for run energy but also shortcuts and 70 for Sara gwd if you're into bossing
---
&gt;strengthening passwords
---
Does this mean they won’t be **case-insensitive** anymore?
---
This is the same thread where he was pissed at Mod Gee for retweeting some art from her personal twitter to the work account.
---
Dude is just begging for attention.
---
Yes and what can the eu do to enforce those laws? American companies that operate from america and offer their services in the eu currently dont have to give a shit about gdpr. There is no enforcement, no audit, all local gdpr authorities are way overworked. I filed a complaint about paypal 6 months ago and I’ve only received a letter stating it will take longer because of the number of complaints. Paypal operates from the eu so there’s a chance for me, good luck with companies outside the eu.
---
Not without getting banned almost instantly
---
You know you can just disable the authenticator and all you have to do is post a singular code to disable it? Unless you got mugged for your phone.
---
Pretty sure it despawned like 10 mins after I posted, sorry
---
You can't unless you also have access to the account email.
---
Having access to the email is, today, considered proof of account ownership (you can literally do anything, change password, remove auth, even change the account email), so that's not surprising
---
With only the account password, though? No, you can't remove the authenticator.
---
What exactly is UnOldSchool-like about this suggestion? 
---
If it's the fact that you save space, then how do you feel about the rune pouch?
---
I remember charging glories for money. An uncharged glory + 2k (on a good day) for an amulet of glory (4). Good times man.
---
I like this idea you can either have more runes in your inventory and get a better staff with more mage bonus or you could get less inventory spots filled for less mage bonus
---
I've done 1k runs and have every item except guthan's chest. I always get 100% and I think my worst reward was 1k gold
---
The team has said we literally can't add more bank space without crashes--problem is rendering too many items.
---
Between the seed vault and the various outfit storage options in your house, not to mention clue stashes, 816 bank spaces seems to be plenty to me, unless you're pathologically averse to getting rid of items and placeholders you don't really need.
---
yeah but how do you get the iban’s staff?
---
what about the bots
---
I would still really love to see bank pin on login. I hate being paranoid about banking all my items everytime I log off, and having to regear everytime I log in
---
Nah dmm is just boring to watch after being through tons of tournies
---
Where is this an assumption?
---
I see that Jagex Profits 50m, an unheard of sum in comparison to their revenue.
---
I see that bots run rampant in the game.
---
And I do realize that hiring "the very best" for 1-2 years on a temporary, contractual basis may be a good start. whats next? You actually seem to have no idea how the working environment, consulting firms or botting scene looks like. The irony in your post...
---
It does have it....? Using it for agility right now lol.
---
Seeing questions like these getting high vote percentages is very worrying, especially question 5.
---
best post i've seen on this sub. i sincerely thank you.
---
I don't disagree but there's nothing challenging about traversing the pass after you've done it just once, any time after that is pure tedium and I genuinely couldn't care less if it got a shortcut added to it after the quests were completed, it doesn't diminish my completion of the quest in any way shape or form.
---
Because are you for real? The 50 item search list to get a death talisman was such a stupid meaningless fetch quest and I can guarantee everyone who had the option just bought the talisman instead. The mirror rotating thing allows for the temple to be more navigable and actually usable for rc after completing the quest. The grid puzzle is also stupidly tedious and trial and error, you shouldn't be forced to memorize some stupid path for your second go through. The agility maze and Koftik skip are the only ones I can see argument for, and even then theres skipping NPCs for Tree Gnome Village and Karamja already.
---
I believe all of those begging for auth delay had their email accounts hijacked at the same time.
---
Summer GE flash sale
---
pvp gnomeball pls
---
Have they announced the release date or are you just guessing I’m hype for new quest!
---
What does that have to do with anything though. I agree that there are some really old game mechanics that are remnants of before game upgrades that wouldn’t hurt the experience fixing, but where did an arbitrary unofficial comp req come from?
---
I'm an ironman who has to charge an iban staff for barrows, I cant buy a trident off the g.e. the last two times I charged it I forgot my spade thrs n the next one I forgot my staff. Shits cancer and I'm low level so I cant pay the 200k to get it charged without going through, ik I restricted myself but it's not fun content i want to do after work all day
---
Good god
---
I would love this level of security. Its basically what people think authenticator delay will do but better. Plus it can be totally optional.
---
Implementing auth delay is 0 time? What?
---
I also don't get what you mean by that last sentence. You can only remove your 2fa through account recovery (bad if the recovery is bad) or by having access to the account email (good - you need a way to re-set the authenticator if you ever change phones)
---
ive had 3 shinies so far (by playing casually)
---
and theyre all shit: Rattata(crystal) Zubat(crystal) Makuhita(emerald)
---
All early game aswell, rattata was before i got pokeballs, BIG OOF
---
Of course it can 😂 the bot client will start when an account is logged in and stop when it’s not
---
Exactly what the first 10mins of the trip look like
---
Motherlode Mine
---
&gt; waste my time clicking on obstacles that I’ll pass anyways
---
You just described 90% of OSRS though.
---
aye
---
Thank you.
---
If anything player counts have been increasing especially because of mobile... plus most gamers are actually older then 20 so it's not a bad thing that osrs has an older population
---
Only 250 burnt pages?
---
I disagree, being able to work with other people to progress a quest is an example of great mmo design
---
FF14 is easily above OSRS.
---
The company that regularly listens to player feedback has run out of goodwill? People sure are strange.
---
You either die a PvMer, or live long enough to become a skiller.
---
Hahahah
---
You want it? I got it!
---
Or staking for 5 hours while coming down of coke
---
Won't happen.
---
Best you can hope for is clan instances like Corp Beast.
---
Emblem bots
---
3rd panel sounds like Mudkip lol
---
If there was a PvM tourney where the fastest person to solo ToB won $32k or something like that I wouldnt give a shit about that either. Some people just don't care about watching video game streams/tournaments. 
---
I love video games, hate esports.
---
That doesn’t justify why killing a mole gets more logs than cutting a tree. Come on, man.
---
DMM is the same thing every time. It's boring as fuck.
---
Is it appropriate to reply to your woosh with a woosh since my sarcastic reply seems to have wooshed over your head or is your woosh a sarcastic woosh and am I being wooshed?
---
Join a new CC
---
I voted yes because I don't mind people having it easier than I did, especially when I didn't have fun or feel any sense of accomplishment (they were dice rolls, not skill based).
---
LMAO oh Lord..
---
Oo TIL thanks!
---
Ha, thanks for the play by play. I was curious what the granite was, last time I touched RuneScape it was like 1999. Never made it out to the wilds personally, just spent all my time farming magic wood and fishing if I remember correctly.
---
Exactly.
---
This sub:  "Lol, I would never fall for a fishing email."
---
Also this sub:  *Find out which Avenger you are!  -Enters in name / DOB / location.- 
---
That's like 7-8 of the recovery questions.
---
Yes.
---
Because people value their time? There's jack shit to do in the Underground Pass, walking through it after the quest is an obnoxious waste of time. The poll is asking for there to be an OPTION to bypass the Pass, meaning if you want to have the "classic experience," you can go right ahead and do it. The other 70% of people who don't want to waste 10 minutes walking thru it can just skip it. To the 30% of people who don't want to skip it: I guess we should also have to go through the sewers every time we want to go to West Ardougne, or go through the lumbridge swamp cave to get to Tears of Guthix, right? 
---
Honestly, everyone is this thread is just trying to have a dick measuring contest on how much of an "OG Scaper" they are, meaning how much time-wasting they can put up with. At the same time they use RuneLite and only use the most efficient methods for every skill, as if that's anything like how Runescape was originally played.
---
Use ur head idiot
---
That's what RS3 is for.
---
All the the lines of this, I never understood why OSRS didnt have a party system like every other mmorpg. The closest thing we seem to have is partner slayer
---
Honestly with some of the people on twitch getting hacked I wouldn't be surprised if they had passwords like: 
---
[favorite_sports_team][birthday]
---
Or something that is just unbelievably easy to hack if you ask the guy questions on stream. And they probably have it as there email password too.
---
Not even close to .4 or .5 even dumping 10b at once which these botters arent doing, accounts are usually inactive/cracked and around 40-70m. ban rates are really low can be like a month before bans sometimes and most people arent paying anything for the scripts especially if they are running a lot of accs.
---
Seed vault and stashes
---
\+1 raids
---
Ummmm this is fucking amazing
---
Looks like play doh. Maybe if you were talented, you wouldn't be using thick layers of fondant for your 'cake'.
---
Really? On my main I barely have to do anything. Need to level up the majority of my skills? Farm Zulrah/Vorkath for gp and buy XP. Need a super rare drop? Farm Zulrah/Vorkath for gp and buy rare drop. Need membership on any of my accounts? Farm Zulrah/Vorkath for gp and buy XP. Don't have combat stats high enough to farm either of those? AFK at Sandcrabs/NMZ, do Barrows for gp to pay for gear. Need to do some quests? Farm Zulrah/Vorkath for gp and buy all the required/recommended items from the GE to turn an hour long quest into a 5 minute quest.
---
I barely even have to learn anything about the game. I've hardly made any progress on my HCIM (btw) BECAUSE
---
My brother and I*
---
That comparison is not even close to the same thing though.
---
Leave some pussy for the rest of us
---
Yes, that would be one element of allowing complex passwords to be set
---
You don't quit runescape. You just take very long breaks.
---
I took a break for over 7 years once and here I am.
---
Patience is a skill most haven't mastered
---
Haha, I got that. I didn't understand the runescape reference
---
Knowing Jagex they'll probably provide them with passwords in order to determine if they've been leaked lmao.
---
lol i do taxes. Trust me 60% is too much no matter who you are.
---
How so?
---
In the same boat as your right now.  
---
My goal is to murder the fuck out of that fucking giant mole.  Cocksucker face-fucked me back to Lumby too many times when I was a kid and I want to exact my revenge on it until I kidnap his son and make it follow me around for eternity.  
---
Beyond that, Barrows seems like it would be fun since I never did it back in the day.
---
My suggestion would to have a lockdown period (similar to bank pin) that would occur anytime a recovery takes place. This would give the owner ample time to re-recover the account with the slight inconvenience of loosing X(7) days of playtime.
---
yo just saying these accs usually are stolen but definitely do not get banned in 24 hrs, ive seen accs that have literally gone over a month before then get the ban appealed lmao
---
Glad i'm not the only one that thinks the dude is just fucking dumb. It's her twitter, who fucking cares that much?
---
But it's a Pokemon reference
---
Fire your servant.
---
The dart throw was perfect for the pokeball lol
---
Ingame notif. Text message or notif on authenticator app.
---
rune**scape**
---
good input. im proud of you
---
I came here for MEMES, not wholesomeness!
---
Because backtracking is almost always considered poor game design and people are trying to make the game more enjoyable for new players. Why do masochistic assholes continue to vote no to poll questions that offer corrections to poorly designed content?
---
How come I'm not scared when I turn him upside down?
---
Yeah, this is my average barrows luck with Mory hard. I actually had to stop doing barrows since I was losing money.
---
DUDE XD!!!!
---
Sometimes I really wonder if people forget that it is just a game. I wish my venezuelans all the best.
---
Because there’s always a chance they didn’t bank other items. I’ve gotten a few scroll books with 500k+ worth of teleport scrolls or laws or something. Also most people aren’t pking for profit. They’re doing it because they enjoy it.
---
we need just a "bank" pin before logging in and every problem is solved basically
---
?
---
So true haha
---
Such a dumb argument. Maybe they should create another game which is before eoc after 07. That way people like you are happy.
---
Losing to the best skiller in the history of this game isn't a big deal though
---
These changes look great! I become more comfortable with the idea ever time I see more information. 
---
As a side note, thank you for all your hard work and sorry for the rage on your Twitter post. While those people are passionate about the game, I do not think they are treating you fairly nor with the respect you have earned.
---
I've been editing the wiki for months... the page was entirely overhauled by me. As a general rule, MMGs don't present maximum rates.
---
Are you just trolling? Come on dude.
---
The champion would obviously be authenticator delay.
---
Missed the window :(
---
O well i also panic bought an arcane for 117 so ill wait toll that goes back to 135 to compensate the rapier loss xd
---
It means he's someone who wants to play RS as though it's a solo game even though it's an MMO and contribute to the diminishing interaction within the community slowly ruining the game in hopes of achieving youtube stardom by making boring progress videos.
---
He's a streamer, so he gets paid to play RS. Not bad imo.
---
No xp waste
---
Are you the same guy that was #2 for most of the Suomi era?
---
Yep, it's 100% this and also because it's summer (more players). I'm going to wait to grab my high end PvM gear until a month or two after Song of the Elves.
---
This isn't even true dude, you can have max hp, max prayer, praying melee and still get smited to mace clans.
---
Now days with password apps on your phone (like 1Password) there’s really no excuse for not having good passwords everywhere. Back in the day remembering a bunch of 8+ character alphanumeric passwords could be shitty, but now days it’s all right there in your pocket.
---
Work on slayer is always a good go-to default option.
---
Sire BAD
---
Real talk the loot is pretty terrible
---
Sweet, i definitely think ill end up turning it into a zerker then at some point in time, Thanks for the advice!
---
You can't prevent shit dude
---
You dont have to support anybody. They will do that themselves. Just keep playing your game, for them their worries are a bit more than that. 
---
If youre that worried about a game economy then honestly I dont know what to tell you. You honestly prefer a healthy(it will never be) game economy over the well being of other humans.
---
Maybe you can use granite warhammer? It’s better than the Kong’s word, but might have a strength requirement.
---
!Thesaurizethis
---
Nah man. Harpies are weak against necromancy.
---
Very cool. Was this a commission? ;o
---
You literally posted admitting to vandalizing the page. Its clear that it is you that is trolling. 
---
Wikis are fundamentally unreliable due to vandalism from users like you.

I can go in and change the name of Wyrms to lolipops and then post that the wiki says the name is lolipops to everyone who calls them wyrms. Its just nonesense distracting from the helpful advice given elsewhere though.

Of course im not a moron like you who actually does it.

Nice PokeballGS Spec.

Very good idea. I wonder if you could get a more interesting scoring system, but honestly x/638 or whatever if still pretty nice. Probably needs engine work tho

My intent is melee. 
---
I know ranged/mage is the better strategy but I want the satisfaction of murdering him with a sword and then later with his own weapon (If I am lucky enough to get one). I would not doubt that I would be going through some eats to do it but I am more asking if anyone has done it melee style with similar stats or if more training is required before I waste some time and items on failed attempts
---
I assume prayer switching may be my best strategy going in to the fight to minimize damage or even just leave it on anti-melee as his ranged is generally weaker than his melee.
---
Thank you for helping me workshop this.
---
ok so my main misunderstanding was that I thought you got the shortcuts after the whole questline was done, meaning that you already had no reason to go in there anyway. i agree that if you still have to do the cave for regicide you should have to do it again. but either way I still think this is barely comparable to the features you're talking about just because it literally only affects one instance of having to use the caves as opposed to a widely used mechanic. the example that springs to mind would be like if they removed having to call during BA which would basically remove any player/player interaction as well as the only thing that makes the game difficult.
---
Wow what a unique and totally new kind of post thank you very interesting
---
50% of the playerbase is a very small percentage now? Fuck you’re brain dead
---
why don't you read what the spec actually does
---
I don't remember what stream but back during the attempted rebellion by Jagex against 3rd party clients one of the things they stated after giving up was types of plugins they wouldn't allow and Theater of Blood was explicitly mentioned as a plugin that was against the rules.
---

Because they suck at the game and just want to afk while at work all day.

What about allowing custom-length bank PINs?
---
Nothing about this is against GDPR if done properly.

Ah, what stats are recommended for them? I've done mith drags and they take a long time to kill, rune drags has got to be even worse.

The only way he spawns in that location is if some noobs block him from moving. You stay north of him and your character will follow him. He will never despawn.

When someone walks in and complains and has nothing meaningful to say and brings literally NOTHING to the conversation other than "I don't like it, and I don't need to come up with a solution because it's not my job!", and then blames the company for apparently "Not doing enough" when you clearly have no idea what they go through in the process in the first place, yes I will sit on my high horse and call you an idiot.
---
As for believing the numbers they provide AKA your argument for signaling theory, I am a bot developer, and actually hire the client developers to work on projects for me, so I am quite in touch with the dynamics of this 'market'. I'm quite aware of the solutions they could go through to make reasonable and fair attempts to prevent botters from having major access to the game, but in doing so they'd also prevent normal players from coming to the game too. They've deemed that bots are not significant enough of an issue at this time to damage the accessibility of their game for the average user.
---
They are currently in a golden era of growth again, for a second major run especially with their mobile launch, anything done to try and limit access in an attempt to prevent bots would CRUSH this time for them, not only did I clarify this in my first post, but the fact that you claim I know nothing of their business and HR decisions while pointing out the whole reason its currently the way it is is actually sad. 
---
"As long as I see a bot, that's my proof that they aren't doing enough, and in fact are basically doing nothing."
---
What an ignorant piece of trash. Grow up, and figure out how a million dollar business is properly ran.
---
Sir Pugger has a video about sneaking into osrs botter discord’s and it was quite common for them to post screenshots like this showing off how much they’ve made. https://youtu.be/Aoqt0kcaee8

RoT is a clan though, so they'll be team rocket while Jed would be giovanni

That's definitely what id assume.

Loooool why so salty bro? Ever think people can both understand and still not enjoy 5x xp clanmode? Just because most people disagree with you about something you enjoy doesn't mean they don't understand what you enjoy.
---
fr tho I would play the shit out of a osrs/pokemon crossover game.
---
But how is buying the Talisman from other players any more personal than buying the items for the list off other players? The Talisman is a skip, but the intended method still allows for player interaction. You can help players find items for the list or sell them to players, so if you think cooperation is good design, the list offers far more of that than the Talisman. I can't see how you can argue that buying a single item to skip a scavenger hunt of various items around the world involving a bunch of content like minigames and dungeons is good design. Even if they did intend the talisman to be rare and worth more than it was or for trading to be harder, it doesn't change the stat of it in the current game. The intent of the design can be good while the reality of the design is still bad.

To be fair, most skills are shit. They just don't take 300 hours to get to 99..

Every time I run out of membership and all the laws are in my rune pouch, some lucky F2Per will get 5K for a law rune so I can GTFO of Lumbridge.

If a removal delay of 2fa from an account was a good idea then it would be an industry standard. I already said that. /r/2007scape isn't some kind of infosec pioneers with this shit idea.
---
Controversial but not out of the question, especially if untradeable (lore explanation: unstable, unfit to trade) or expensive.
---
With this inclusion though I'm more and more in line with Gentletractor's suggestion that this be implemented as the second half of Runecrafting though. I suppose it doesn't have to be, given that we have Wc/Fm separate, Fletch/Craft separate, and Mining/Smithing separate, but it's really starting to feel tied to RC. Which isn't bad but means it definitely needs discussion/examination.
---
This is all great! Thanks !

Grotesque Guardians
---
Its not. U lose &gt;1000 hours if ur a uim, hcim, or specialty acc if ur hacked. Id take 30 days. 7 is conservative. Could also just do opt in. Default 3. If the person also gets ur acc banned u lose all ranks. So if u were ranked #5 cooking, ur now ranked #1000 or whatever on unban.

And they called the voting community the 'Mobile morons &amp; Reddit retards'. How rude.

Does osrs have a different draw/ render range in the wilderness? In rs3 no matter what setting you have toggled in the highest detail the draw range is like 12~ squares for the wilderness only. If so than it is pointless for osrs but if not than good for you :)

Thank you

Jagex is sitting on it's very own monopolies.
---
IF you ask me, Runescape (osrs) is a stronger monopoly than google.
---
Spare some change? Chaaaaaange
---
You buy and sell, it's basic cashflow. Unless you are hella poor (in which case why are you going for high herblore?) it's trivial to the point of being mild QOL.
---
It's not worth then whole potion economy, and by extension pvm economy being messed up for the sake of mild QOL.
---
One additional form of security I've seen suggested is having the bank pin lock features:
---
1. Login lock
---
2. Trade/GE lock
---
3. Inventory/Equipment lock
---
I feel like that would help with reducing damages on accounts that have already been compromised as some people only lose equipped items.
---
Why don't more people have 99s? That's easy the skills are repatitive and boring to the vast majority of people. When you ask someone what they find fun in osrs very rarely do they say training cooking or runecrafting for example. They might describe it as relaxing, but it's not difficult by any means.
---
The argument of "I have a job/school/obligations" is easily one of the most damaging arguments to MMOs when it comes to making content easier. People who say this are literally saying "I have poor time management skills, so make the game easier for me." 
---
If you work 30 minutes away, are you going to leave your house 31 minutes before work? Or are you going to be an adult and properly allocate the appropriate amount of time required to get to work on time? 
---
Stop ruining the integrity of games (easier content, 6h splashing, 6h nmz) because "i have to work". If you have to work/study then stop playing games and get your priorities in order.
---
I also think that re-introducing security questions could be a good thing. Granted, it isn't perfect, but does it have to be?
---
A lot of people seem to get hijacked through their email. Jagex doesn't ask anything other than having access to it. Jagex could ask to answer a security question before sending the email.   
---
Many services still use recovery questions. There has to be a reason why. Most seem to use them in the way I described, but I could be wrong. 
---
As for the previously mentioned problems, there has to be a way to mitigate most of that, right? Jagex could allow us to change them when our account has been in "good standing" for 12+ months. Or when Jagex determined that an account has been hijacked. 
---
Just a thought...
---
It’s helps to weed out the weak.
---
I just completed the Waterfall quest... Is there any point in keeping the Glorial Pebble and Glorials urn?
---
everyone knows. you can check the item database in the cache and see literally everything. You can also spawn every single item code on a private server
---
Same dude
---
Sure a group of people can come together and help one person complete their list and then trade the talisman between, this seems to be the intended route for completing the quest. The fact that a quest becomes less interesting over time is inevitable.
---
Yep and things like materials used, shift click to walk here, and a few other things I've put into my copy of runelite.
---
originally he said tbow is 10x the dps of verac, seems he editted it away after my comment about it.

Turn gpu plug-in on

I don't think they'll change it because ardy diary has effectively turned dsq into a cash sink for basically every mid to high level in the game. Pay 800k for two shield halves that alchs for 300k when combined to finish an arbitrary diary req.
---
Thanks for your work on this. Sorry for all the garbage thrown at you on Twitter over this. Certainly not justified.
---

You sound like someone who had *only* played rs and never ever completed a single masterpiece singleplayer game. RS is good, but to pretend every bit of it is decent design? no way
---
&gt;If a removal delay of 2fa from an account was a good idea then it would be an industry standard
---
Not always the case that something that could be a good idea is industry standard, that's a moot point aswell since Jamflex isn't google security.
---
&gt;/r/2007scape isn't some kind of infosec pioneers with this shit idea.
---
I mean, looks like your whole life is a shit idea if you have nothing else to do but bitch and moan about an online forum.
---
again,
---
Simply stating that "a delay is a stupid idea" is stupid, give me an ACTUAL reason as to why it's stupid, other then "boo hoo, google, the multi billion dollar corporation that has multiple ways of protecting your email that jagex cannot possibly do due to team size, doesn't do it", and then maybe I'll consider it, but for now I see no reason why there shouldn't be an authenticator delay similar to a delay when deleting your bank pin.

He is making 0 sense. Where the fuck does that ridiculous 675k/h figure come from?

Slaughtering Venusualans will probably not solve the bot problem in a vacuum but it's the effort that counts.

I wonder how low d limbs will go. 6 months ago they were close to 9m each and now barely 4m and with thousands of players mass farming them everyday on alts and such then might drop even lower. Hopefully not.

Because Poll results were hidden and I can't make logical choices, duh. Easiest way is to tick 'yes' on everything.

Thats fine imo

Its still a collection log

You still collected the item
---
&gt; We're also looking into how we can support password managers.
---
Enabling pasting on the login screen like what has been done in RuneLite.
---
I use Lastpass and have never tried any other password manager so I don't know if this is a common limitation of password managers, but it doesn't work on anything outside of the browser. If I want to login to any desktop app I have to first open up Chrome then copy the password from Lastpass and paste it into the app.
---
Some chosen Mods from Mojang have. Like you can get a city texture pack, dead space I believe and a few others.
---
However, op may be able to purchase this on pc, log into their Mojang account and then edit the biomes. Save it, then load it up on the switch and carry on.
---
Not sure if it'll actually work due to you trying to load a modded map on the console but minecraft, like osrs, has cross device play.
---
Holy hell this is the best shit. I wanted to try coke but this is stronger
---
You need to have some type of progression and development for the game. You cant expect it to stay exactly the same for the life of the MMO that’s the recipe for disaster (no pun intended 😉). I understand the updates are fresh content but to win market share and continue to appease the current generation of gamers there needs to be some type of graphical enhance otherwise the game looks dull and boring and even with more advertisement it will look like an out of date game. For example if you gave a teenager an Nintendo 64 with let’s say super smash bro’s or a switch with the same game but better graphics which do you think that teenager would chose?For us players so have been there since day 1 we love the nostalgia but we won’t be able to sustain the game off that nostalgia. I believe the downfall in player base is already taking place..hence the X marks the spot quest and the beginner clue scrolls as well as the new dungeon boss which is catered to mid-level players. Something has to be done or the game we love will have a third of the already falling player base in the coming years.
---
Went into dungion, person a would fish for food.  Person b would find ore for armor/ leather for range/silk for magic. One person would key and complete puzzle rooms.

It’s gonna be annoying for people who already got so much shit before the log was released
---
Solomissions killing it atm tbf
---
Well you would be risking this expensive weapon in multi so unlike ancient mace there's a lot of rusk and it's therefore more fair.
---
Also there is plenty you can do to avoid getting maced like staying not full hp or wearing a necklace of faith, or better yet just not stepping into multi with expensive +1s lol
---
Overall not a fan of this spec idea or yours, which would probably just be used to grief people in bh/pvp worlds
---
I wanted this as well, but atleast we got a reason as to why not
---
Oh no happens to me all the time, I need a fix mayyyn
---
Sounds like a good idea, but I'd worry about hackers looking up certain accounts to see if they've got good drops (and therefore more gp) and focusing on attempting to hack that account.
---
Making me max cape to my house,run to the jewelry box, hit the wealth tele, then run to the npc when I have a music cape that literally should have the teleport on it seems unnecessary
---
It always seems to happen upon the first login. It's really annoying
---
Unfortunately not everyone has common sense. \^\^; And when one neglects it on cases like this, damage will be done before one could fix them.
---
But thank you.
---
&gt; You would be required to type bank pin BEFORE you are getting access to account at all. This would delay the hackers at least a bit, even if they get an access to your account.
---
Isn't that literally what 2FA is? This is wholly redundant if you setup an authenticator. I don't see how this would improve anything
---
Everyone I tested would keep the trade box open until they get kicked out for inactivity 10 minutes later.
---
I once had 4 within like 6 kills and I didn't know what do do with my life, there was just like 15-20 sharks sitting there while I tried my best.

The only quest which gets easier is regicide, which is literally the underground pass twice with 10 minutes of actual quest.  That's just bad design.

what do you mean
---
Who? People who share experiences about the subject of a post? If this was a post about baby mole then I would be saying im well over 5k kc for the pet. Fuck outta here
---
Edgy
---
Some CCs can be very strict as far as speech goes. That is why it is specified.
---
So have it be a toggle in your account settings, this is a non-issue.
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
You still aren’t getting it. ZMI isn’t a production skill. Let’s say you can do an action every 3 seconds then it is xp per ward x 1200. There that’s max xp/hr
---
Can you explain the bank fillers in detail for me? I've been wanting to do this for Runecrafting where I can press deposit inventory and have certain items not go in. Is that what this is doing?

Get some self awareness you stupid fuck

Why do that anyway?  It seems pretty sore to be denying someone loot when you're in the pvp area.
---
And gods forbid if you made the same mistake in the last 30 minutes.
---
No but the clip is posted on this sub and doing well, so that's not really a good point
---
I chose to read this comment as more of a threat than a complement and I believe I was correct in doing so.
---
Wowowow falador diary helps so much. I made around 70 mil total going for 99 from upper 70s mining in Mlm. That would’ve helped significantly but too late at this point
---
Yooooo we should get a J-Mod Smackdown in here if that's true! Maybe we'll finally stop seeing him weird flex this account over and over.
---
low level trees/fruit trees. Also teak/mahogony are good. You can always do herb runs on the side for some trickle xp.
---
Manked is clutch on twitch
---
You’ll also read that 50% of our community is dumb
---
Lootsgare was polled multiple times and failed every time. My best advice is to try and find a reputable clan to do PvM with. If you must do randoms, look them up on rsjustice and if they’re on there, offer to FFA or find other teammates.
---
That is fucking embarrassing, OP must have some serious issues to feel the need for that much validation
---
not particularly, no. you only have to break the bank if you want to go fast. you can definitely go to 99 with willows, papayas, and regular hespori/celastrus/calquat/herb runs. it'll just be very slow.
---
if you *want* to go fast then yes, you'll have to break the bank, but the cost of the expensive trees is easily mitigated by bossing. if you don't mind putting in the time at vork or zulrah you can fund 99 farming without much of a problem.
---
it should also be noted that, with the three disease free patches (you could also make a case for planting at farming guild for increased yield with the diary, if you have the resurrect crops spell) if you're planting the most expensive seeds (snaps and torstols, ranarrs are pussy shit) you have access to you can potentially offset the cost of tree runs.
---
really it's just a matter of being regular; either through your herb runs or your bossing.
---
Dang congrats! I've done like 100 hard clues and the most I've ever gotten was like 500k... I usually get like 50k in rewards every time.

Am i the only one who went to the east?

I’m confused what exactly are you trying to say?

If you're going to send out increased email notifications then you NEED to add a way to verify emails. Please offer a corresponding message in the message centre and inform people to verify emails by checking the message centre and discouraging people to click links in your emails unless the email was sent manually by the player (password reset links for instance) otherwise you introduce another phishing avenue.
---
far from shot down--that's a work in progress right now
---
I got one kraken on 45 kc, the next on 52 kc, and another on 870ish kc (iirc). Might have ya beat but gz regardless! I’m shit outta luck on the tent and trident though
---
You need the mourner outfit and get a key in west Ardy, then you can enter the area iirc.
---
Honestly, I have no idea what's happening with the hijacking in the community. I have 2FA on my email and my RS account. Never received a phishing email before and haven't been hacked since OSRS release.
---
Is most of this due to people using emails for logins, cause I still use a username I made back in the day.
---
That said, I'm sure curious their reason for delaying this so long after seeing this has been a reoccurring topic for years.
---
Lol I was just doing this the other day got 36 kills in a couple hours
---
Just pay the 25k ... items dont despawn in the instance. You also dont waste time looking for a world.
---
People should leave their account in whatever state they want. If you choose to toggle this off you'd be less secure, but that is your choice. You're not forced to have an authenticator at all, but if you want to have a more secure account, you get it regardless of it being an inconvenience.
---
Just received this bad boy as my first pet as well at 79 agility. Congrats bro!
---
How does one remove a pin if they're in the login screen, right now you talk to a banker to disable it.
---
That’s beautiful, is that James Joyce?
---
So looking back that makes sense, but still not too much. Zulrah was released back in 2015. So let’s say he made 15 bots that never got banned in 4 years. That means to have 30 years of play time, each account would need 2 years worth of play time. That means half of this mans life is upkeeping 15 accounts to make sure they do not get banned for 550B over 4 years. At $0.60 per Mill, that means in 4 years they have grossed $33,000. That is roughly $8,000. Why in the actual hell would you just not get a job?
---
I saw a guy at Wintertodd called F
---
He said he hasn’t gotten the pet yet, so I said Fs in chat for F, was the best thing I’ve ever said
---
Yeah, a bit underrated considering the amount of time and effort he puts on every video.
---
Its not that I really dislike the idea of the item sink, I think there needs to be an item sink and its really hard to make everyone happy with how its implemented. I kind of glossed over the item sink aspect in my last post, which I realized doesn't make much sense, cuz thats the reason the repairs were suggested in the first place.
---
But yeah actually that would be a good compromise. lets say you dismantle a BGS, you could then use that to repair your current BGS....3x? 5x? Idk what would work for balance but you get the point. If you also needed the skilling resources for those repairs, I actually like the idea much better (though I'm not crazy about the idea of everything item needing repairs regardless)
---
I was comparing it to EOC in a way that it completely changes how the economy functions, maybe it would be a better comparison to summoning. But I was just getting at the point that it changes a huge aspect of what runescape is. It doesn't feel old school. It might be healthy for the economy, in regards to item sink, but it rubs me the wrong way.
---
I'd have to see how they would propose the changes to really make up my mind. I am just wary that gameplay changes like these often affect poor rather than the rich. Like a rich guy getting a speeding ticket vs someone who can barely make rent. If they scale it well, it might work well enough.
---
As an outside observer I think both of you guys are very helpful and neither were rude. Good on you both for being good people.
---
Given your budget, and assuming you'd want to keep ~75% or more of that for gear and supplies, I'd say certain benchmarks are important:
---
83 construction (+boosts) - pretty much maxed house including ornate pool, jewellery box, portal nexus, fairy rings, occult altar etc. 
---
78 herblore - very useful for gaining points in raids, as well as necessary for quick and efficient raids
---
69 mining - unlocks a lot of useful quests (with boosts)
---
Agility is a useful skill to level in general due to the myriad shortcuts it unlocks as well as the decreased obstacle fail rate and passive run energy increase.
---
I thought they removed all possible methods of suicide? What did he use?
---
Yeah, stay away from trees if you are low on cash.  Stick to stuff like herbs, mahogany trees, papayas, celastrus, and allotments.  Palm and maple trees are a little more expensive but are faster xp if you really want that.  Stuff like herbs really add up over time.
---
Tithe farm is mind-numbing.  Don't go there for xp, just the rewards you want.
---
Damn dude, that is a dandy calc sheet. Thanks for exposing the holes in my plan.
---
Assumedly when you say rune sword you just mean which ever of the one handed swords, not specifically the short sword.
---
Currently From your checklist I have:
---
•Rune Scim (Ol’ reliable)
---
•Full Rune &amp; Kite (would I be better off equipping the chainbody or the plate body? I have both regardless but I am assuming Obor uses crush based attacks)
---
•Amulet of Strength and Amulet of Power (
---
•Potion of Strength
---
•Enough prayer for all the buffs mentioned (could always use more though)
---
Also patience is something I have. Maybe I will wait until 80 str and then switch to attack training before I attempt this, I was drastically overlooking the attack stats dps factor.
---
True but most people just buy it after they unlock it for the diary rewards rather than wait until ds2 to get it.
---
I'm not sure of the right half is tradable buy itd be nice to make it unreadable if this change was made to prevent people from buying it and selling it to people who haven't done ds2.
---
Id love to just hear what the dev's think about it though.
---
You mean like forgetting your spade when clue hunting? Hmmmmmmm
---
I just use my phones hotspot lol
---
This is incredible
---
Ah, well your title makes you sound like you're salty over it failing and that you wanted it to pass to the Underground Pass would be less annoying

I use a set of passwords that I can remember well but vary enough to avoid guessing. Everything 2FA and just general care to avoid the password being found. This along with making it so your rs email is ONLY for the account will make it so they have no chance of logging in regardless. 
---
*If you receive scam emails from RS- It was not kept private to any degree that I would consider to be secure.
---
You posted twice
---
Damned if they do damned if they don't
---
Well, I don't play OS myself, so I have no idea when Zulrah was released.... But instead of 15 accs, maybe he had 30, 40, 50... It all depends on what his PC can handle.
---
You can kind of compare this to the bitcoin miners. Aside from doing his job, he just lets his PC afk on all of these accounts, and take the money once in 2-3 days on a few different accounts and sell it further.
---
Why would he not do this, when he can just make 8 grand in 2 years for pretty much no upkeep time
---
Dam very cool good work
---
Pedo
---
im just hoping after a few thousand kills I'd have gotten lucky once somewhere
---
Awesome if you can find it id love to check that out
---
Screenshot of extra cash and gear pls
---
As a Mexican, I can’t speak for Venezuelans, but occasionally they mix in an English word or two in their sentences. I.e “congrats men pero esta bien cabron para hacer vorkath”
---
Hey don't hate m8 thats all I do for the memes. Getting 99 WC the inefficient way, but at least I don't have to pay for membership.
---
S
---
Is hasent been polled for the first time yet only suggested by Jagex and I personally dont see any harm in it, they listen to our views on it and change content if its moaned about if it gives me a different way to get my rc to 77 I'm all for it
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you can't even paste the password on the first party client, so that'd be nice
---
I'd much rather prefer them to figure out how to prevent people's accounts being hacked through recovery than this tbh.
---
I would use obby sword and zerker necklace at 60
---
SirPugger exposed the farm in one of his vids.
---
I cummed
---
Quite the contrary, the fact that they have an authentication system this broken is funny. The fact that they're _considering_ improving it is even funnier.
---
Although you can kill Zulrah now priovided you know how, 70 defence just so you can wear Ahrims and just one more magic level because vengeance is super helpful.
---
Safes
---
It seemed like a big part of their reasoning was they can't afford to respond to all the players that get locked out and want to remove the authenticator. 
---
Well the solution is simple, make it very clear that if you sign up for the optional delay, you could potentially be locked out of your account for 1 week if you lose your phone, and give like a triple dialogue confirmation that you are ok with this, and that you understand that Jagex cannot help you if you lose your phone, and that you'll just have to wait 1 week to play if that happens.
---
Hell, the delay would almost be pointless if they do help players remove the delay, if someone has enough info to recover your account through Jagex and bypass needing email access, and then have them remove authenticator, well then they would also be able to request Jagex to remove the authenticator delay. So the delay wouldn't accomplish anything to stop those types of hacks unless Jagex has a policy to never remove authenticator delays.
---
I agree with you, but you can't ask others to have some respect when you just heavily insulted them. I get why this kid makes you angry, but flaming him isn't the mature thing to do.
---
Question 9 maybe. It's far too easy to teleport out and forget to turn the mirror, setting you back a long time
---
Yea I ran through there a while back using s red salamander.  Its definitely a budget option if you need it.
---
Thanks for this, I got most of that gear already. Maybe I'll grind out ds2 this week and unlock them.
---
Maybe not at immediate access, but I would be willing to bet that they are connected with people who have access to account lists that can provide them with thousands of accounts.
---
Why do people who spend hours engaging in an argument about videogames only choose to go for the "lol loser why do you care so much?" argument after they've lost?
---
Like, you've literally spent as long as me arguing about this if not more lmfao.   Going for the "why do you care so much lol?" play for the first time now is an obvious "Fox and the Grapes" scenario and you know it.
---
\&gt; Is that better? Are you still angry you lost an argument? A week later, and you still think about me? I bet your flaming loss kept you up at night. How flattering. 
---
P R O J E C T I O N  W E W 
---
Let's see, I baited you back into a week old argument with a single smug link, you responded only to go for the "why do you care so much" cop-out when you clearly care just as much if not more.  And then you think a "umad" is going to stick?
---
Man, you should probably get off reddit.  I can't see you having much fun doing what you do this poorly.
---
I voted yes and would have voted yes in 2013. People having opinions differing from your own is something you’re just gunna have to learn to live with. If you can’t accept new player friendly updates then I fear for the future of this game.
---
A 66% majority should be the requirement. As it stands, a few morons who think that Old School shouldn't evolve basically control what content gets in or not. 
---
News flash: It's Old School, not 2007scape. This is a different timeline that should be allowed to grow. If someone disagrees, state your feelings. I'd love to see why you think a game that the average user spends a thousand hours on should become stagnant.
---
Damn rs3 and their .... “system for splitting loot amongst party members” ...like come on you can’t be so self loathing.
---
The portal takes you from the entrance to the treasure room. You can't go up from the next entrance, back to the previous treasure room. It only bothers me because it's the same ladder. You should be able to go up and down, back and forth between the same rooms, using the same ladder. I thought I might be alone on this one, but it's mildly irritating, to me.
---
Absolutely amazing vibes coming from this piece. Would you be willing to do requests? I’d be more than willing to pay!
---
Haha, can’t miss the description of house tabs😆
---
I ended up taking the tank route. Only died twice.
---
Hope he reads this lol
---
thanks for the answer.
---
that’s what i figured but i wasn’t sure!
---
Why am I not surprised he supports Trump. And I'm not even left.
---
Make a new account and restart
---
You've been very unlucky since it's 1/302 (~13k xp per ranarr drop) and doubled with full rogue. At high level you stop failing (~94 with ardy diary or 99 with cape) so you can do up to 3000 pickpockets/hr which translates to 19.8 seeds/hr with optimal rate.  
---
I recommend getting a higher thieving level since you fail so much at lower levels.
---
Is there a way to increase the amount of people you can see at one time on your screen? Currently on world 302 GE and I only have about a 9x9 box around me of people, with people on the edges occasionally flickering in and out. 
---
Using runelite if it's a plugin.
---
h
---
lol imagine thinking that a game economy is more important than an actual one where the consequences could lead to actual death.
---
Not jealous of the actual people, jealous of their situation which enables them to play and compete. I’m a competitive person, I’d like to compete.
---
Tick eating?
---
Also each spell gives a certain amount of xp. That's why splashing fire strike gives 11.5 xp per cast I think and water strikes like 6xp per cast, not including any damage if not splashing.
---
This is the quality content that I subscribe for.
---
That’s right, you cannot paste to the login screen on the official client.
---
Yeah 100% dude buy it all day long but just make sure you stick to vork and you will rebuild easy I made 72m at 500kc i managed to do that in just over a week misses wasnt too pleased though Haha
---
Pretty much all of 'em, check out the optimal quest guide on the wiki and work through to at least barrows gloves
---
Change name on website, not in game, if it's not available, nothing you can do.  Jagex will not make a special exception for you.
---
Old mate in the pyro gear just gave you an invitation for something to do.
---
Maybe the ones that are willing to go stream.
---
The problem, for me atleast, is getting to 77 in the first place
---
But wouldn't that mean any lvl 3 can just skip 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors and just instantly claim all the loot once reaching gift of peace in 1st floor?
---
Yeah ofc, but you gotta thieve to get a better level right? Lol. So, I am using dodgeys tho. But I don't get it, all I see is master farmer this, master farmer that, when it's harralander seed this, tarromim seed that.
---
"Who would attack me?" is a terrible reason for lacking security. Using a good password is not hard, and it's only beneficial.
---
Accounts are hacked through recovery are completely the users fault how could you hack an account through recovery knowing absolutely nothing about it not even the login email ?
---
We need auth on the website
---
I think that guy fell for the streamer loot meme
---
he pretty much just runs back and forth so if he’s left side chances are he’s about to go middle and then right
---
More like throwaway2IQ
---
Grats mate!!
---
Yup! Thats why bosses like vorkath are bad (imo) because id say about 80% of the profit is from alchables
---
that’s just rs classic
---
You should have made into a house tab instead
---
You’re not doing it right if you’re spending more than the low average range for chest values. Probably too low level or not maxing potential.
---
The fact you seem to think an authenticator removal delay is a security feature yet criticize Jagex's security decisions is pretty ironic
---
Woodcutting was my favorite 99 and I had it before Vines by cutting yews. Still pisses me off how devalued I felt woodcutting became after the introduction of Ivys and everyone had 99 woodcutting.
---
they should just give us a second bank if they don't want to do engine work.
---
Bro u obviously care lol
---
Yeah. The nest alone is a 1/256 chance and I don’t know the odds of it being a bird egg nest or a regular nest (plus the nest stays on the ground for like 15-30seconds so very easy to miss while afking) and a piece is 1/300. They say you need roughly 1200 eggs for the full outfit. In my 80wc levels I only have 1 egg lol. I think managing miscellania would be the best ways to collect eggs but still 1200 will take some time.
---
I totally agree. I now cannot overlook the incredible absence of wind balls in my comics lol
---
That's even more intriguing, everything else I know of was changed
---
I wonder what else slipped through now, lol
---
It’s worse on an average based on mean, which is misleading. It’s significantly better based on a median average.
---
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
---
Well that’s pretty...
---
...unplayable...
---
I think we found the guy who got his helmet stolen
---
Articles 44-50 of the GDPR give exclusive rules, including support in order to comply with, and limitations on the GDPR with international cooperations. So, no, the laws are not the same for an American cooperation and a European cooperation.
---
I'm not defending Jagex unjustly, it makes sense that a local government wants to enable you to do buisness with their people. 
---
How big this assitance is, I don't know. But I know that Blizzactivision DEFINITELY commands more respect internationally then almost any other video game company, maybe EA commands more. So, the EU would definitely provide them ample resources, as they did 2.5 Billion USD in sales in the EMEA market.

Nope that can't kill you
---
Just checked out your other work all really well done. Keep it up.
---
How the fuck was discovering a race that locked their civilization behind an adventurous cave filled with agility obstacles that no human could get through not fun? And then forcing yourself to camp and survive off rabits with an axe, tinderbox, and your skills knowing that if you telelported then it'd be brutal to get back. I wish they'd have tossed some PvM content inside the Underground Pass tbh.
---
This ^
---
What in tarnation
---
But you get the shortcut (charter ships) after completing regicide. Going through the underground pass again is part of regicide
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Now you wait for warding
---
200m runecrafting
---
Redditors are idiots thinking they're smart because another idiot said something with conviction.
---
Not sure why Authenticator delay needs to be investigated. A player called for support just within the last week who lost his account because they disabled his authenticator.
---
Just keep your health high and you never die
---
How was magic your last 99......?
---
"Champion PANIC EATS" LOLLL
---
The experience is part of regicide too.
---
Theyre removing part of regicide.
---
Extend this to real life, and this is why good things cant happen
---
I suggest getting rid of recovery questions altogether. If we can no longer set, change, or delete them, why are they used to help recover an account? If a hacker learns the answers to your recovery questions, they have the **permanent** ability to recover your account no matter how many times you change your password or associated email. Its insane that Jagex won't let players delete their recovery questions for the sake of protecting their accounts. 
---
If you don't believe me, Jagex [says the same thing](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115005381989-Recovery-Questions) on the support page.
---
Mika is pretty chill
---
Which is a proper description of everyone using these 4th party clients.
---
That would be an improvement in vocabulary compared to the current dude. Fuck it, needhelpmaxing 2020.
---
Lmao woah. Someones triggered. I was simply making a point. I still don’t see yours tho? Too busy pounding your keyboard little guy?
---
If you weren't active with over 2b at the time you weren't a victim of the mod.
---
nah it would be a pin that u can set in game just like the bank pin
---
Just go to a skill total world lol. Rarely any in the 2k worlds
---
Well that escalated.
---
Doesn’t matter it would be handled by third party therefore not their liability. No company outside of the financial industry does there own ID verification lmao. This ain’t 2007 no more.
---
You mean the guides on the wiki here: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Barrows/Strategies you know, the ones I USE. I’m really sorry, but this isn’t something you can invalidate. I lost money, fact. You cannot change that even if given a literal infinite amount of time.  I’m just unlucky and that’s that.
---
The accounts Jed hacked had their wealth returned. Either way your stolen wealth will not be returned as customer support is not within Jagex's abilities.
---
I voted yes for this skip because I did underground pass roughly 5 months ago. I want to do regicide this weekend so I will have to re-discover the grid, just seems dumb if I already did the quest.
---
Tbf someone said they’ve provided IP addresses before which is really good on their part but obviously has the potential to be abused by people wanting to access accounts for GP. 
---
I think this is legit though you clearly care enough to make sure his guys alright. 
---
Hope he sees that someone’s asking if he’s ok, I’m sure that would be nice.
---
They invited a God to jagex...
---
Nah I dont believe you. No way you lost money from 100 barrows runs how is that even possible. At most you're sipping 2 doses of prayer pot and eating 5 sharks. I sip 1 prayer pot and eat maybe 2-4 sharks each run. That's less than 5k right there so you'd have to get 3k barrows chests 100 times in a row to lose money. Ur full of shit.
---
You mean ultra stretching, looks terrible tbh.
---
Sell the account and complain about it getting hacked
---
But there is a option to “recover account without email access” that legit bypasses that and then disables 2FA instantly.......
---
Obviously it's mega blocks.
---
The thing you use for dragon slayer 2.

Pls don’t feed this troll or else he’ll grow stronger
---
Efficiency would be nonexistent lol
---
My point was just that the offensive bonuses during slayer from the helmet make a huge difference, especially when a low defence account blows through so much food
---
Bronze (g) with a gold chefs hat
---
I think mod ash brought this up on a Q&amp;A, he was in favor of improving it more but it would require engine work
---
True but it would be nice not seeing their spam in every world.
---
What is that?
---
Ive sadly had to craft runes for diaries and also leveled rc up just a little when i was testing the abyss
---
Yissssss
---
Username checks out
---
What is nah?
---
Go for wealth and unique untradeables. If it ever feels boring, or like a chore... stop lol
---
Loooooool
---
You should split with him
---
kek
---
Find out what? As stated before, trading in-game names is not against the rules, but not endorsed by jagex. So if you do it, you wont face any consequences, but if you get scammed doing it then jagex doesn't give a fuck.
---
This is so cool. I know exact where this is (ge right? Looking east?) 
---
Great vibes man. Good style.
---
Okay, thanks for the details.
---
Okay, thanks I likely wasn't a victim then since it was around 450m at the time.
---
Make it an stl now :)
---
I think a month is a fair wait tbh, you can never be too careful!
---
K'ril reminds me of Skarbrand from Warhammer 40K. The looks are too similar XD

What are the best herbs to be running? I'm currently doing Snaps for the gold, but I can plant Lantadyme.

Well damn...
---
Didnt u check the post? It was the bees
---
pvp world with retaliate off and he cropped it so the pvp symbol is hidden?
---
This farm in particular with that outfit have overrun non skill total worlds
---
200mils or pet hunt. Or start over on an iron. Regardless congrats!
---
Flew right over your head, huh
---
It's not up to chance so it isnt karma roulette
---
ooeh what a handsomem lad.

Damn grats on the 17 diamonds my man
---
THIS IS NOT A DRILL BOYS, REPEAT NOT A DRILL
---
It's like seeing the food chain in action. Big fish eats the little fish, gets eaten by bigger fish.
---
I would be quite worried if there were bots at the ge of a 2k skill total world
---
At least they don’t try and scam
---
Someone get swampcomments and swampcommentletics in here pronto
