Team Seren???

Thanks! And just to confirm you can‚Äôt have 2 + clues in your inventory? 
---
honestly same
---
Why does everyone seem to think this would stop clanmanmode? Clans would just completely ignore the zammy/sara/guthix shit 
---
Thanks! And to confirm you can‚Äôt have more than 1 clue in your inventory which is why he needs to get it within the session?
---
Or just use wines with regen bracelet and avoid the swamp thing. You can pretty much always avoid him
---
To be fair the clip is old. It was from before the update where you could have clues of different difficulties at the same time. The update might have broken it. I am going to give it another shot some time this week.

Why would you not have 2fa

you don't need to spam click; you can increase your yield speed by double clicking right as your have harvested. You will know it's a success if your player keeps their head cocked to the side going forward and you receive two items per action.

It takes up nearly the whole tabard; not sure how much larger you expect it to be.

The Age of Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century, the "Century of Philosophy".
---

---
Some consider Descartes' 1637 statement "I think, therefore I am" to have sparked the period. Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687). French historians traditionally date the Enlightenment to between 1715 and 1789: from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. Most end it with the turn of the 19th century. Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the monarchy and the Church and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.
---
The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of knowledge and advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state. In France, the central doctrines of the Enlightenment philosophers were individual liberty and religious tolerance, in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church. The Enlightenment was marked by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, along with increased questioning of religious orthodoxy‚Äîan attitude captured by the phrase Sapere aude (Dare to know).

But it kinda did. To upgrade gear, he needs 85 Slayer. For that, Temple trekking. For that, seeds. For that, vampires anyways

Watch it back. Watch back the final hour. Look at how many active accounts there actually were. Now look at how many of those had a legitimate chance of making the final 256. Now look at those accounts and work out how many of those had a legitimate chance of winning.
---
2000 slots are not all being competitively used - qualifying several accounts isn't difficult either.
---
The random team thing also doesn't stop players from one team feeding players from another team, since we haven't even discussed death mechanics and how bank keys are transferred.

Lol maybe if you have zero other adult obligations and literally zero other life. I'm lucky if I get to play 3-4 hrs a night.

Stop spreading lies

They are debatable, Vanguards are kind of annoying from my experience and can drag the raids fight if bad rng.

As for the lightning at olm, i thought it would make logical sense, as insulated boots work at Verzik. BUT, it's debatable at olm.

For the most part i just want the stackable drops and anti-fire shield buffs.

Thank you for the support. I gotta say the decision wasn't easy but I've done it now. It makes me feel a lot better knowing and getting the proof from you that playing Ironman is kind of viable only if you can really put in the hours and enjoy the grind, especially in the lategame. Knowing that I can barely log in daily, I now know (thanks to you) that if I still want to enjoy the little time I have on this game, deironing is really the right choice.
---
Thank you.
---
There are things that require practice to get good at so I would say for those things yes it would take some degree of skill.
---
your rs account isnt your property.  Goodluck trying to get it settled.
---
You have to get it from a clue scroll
---
I really liked this helmet, the lesser winged helmet has so much more character than the bucket.
---
Still sadly a piece of kit with more or less no place in the game though.
---
lance is pretty good for rune dragons, but brutal blacks are killed with range. the only places lance is useful is at rune dragons, wyverns and olm, but again, lance at wyverns should work nicely but it's weird to see a 100m weapon at wyverns as they're a medium level moneymaker, and it's definitely not worth picking justiciar and lance for wyverns, kinda overkill. You sound like you got plenty of money, perhaps you shouldn't be killing wyverns and be training slayer instead, will be better for your account in the long run
---
Ah you're fine then, very easy to switch gloves for those bosses.
---
I somehow managed for like two months to clock in 40hrs a week at a job and 40hrs a week on RuneScape.  Was kind of a disgusting existence ngl.
---
Yea im not gonna risk my items i spent 500 hours getting because my internet cuts out for 5 seconds, but since you like this idea maybe jagex can give you a toggle option :)
---
the gamemode is on a MMORPG game btw.
---
You sure about that? Makes absolutely no sense if you can withdraw noted but  deposit noted. Im almost 100% certain that they updated it with the farming guild update. 
---
And even if im wrong, wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to push for the ability to deposit noted, a broader qol update, than push for a very specific warning message?
---
i forget what he wanted, what was it?
---
Remove? Haha move it to infront of the ladder
---
Of course you could get a bond, but it'll be a an unnecessary way to do it. More efficient ways to get a bond but, if you want a cool challenge do it!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah for sure man. Not only is it hard due to the hours, because I can play 5 hours a day if I feel like it (and I frequently do lol) but the grinds are so awful sometimes that you‚Äôll thank yourself. Yeah if you‚Äôre playing less than 10 hours a week Ironman is basically the longest term goal ever haha.
---
To each their own. Efficiency-wise it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but that‚Äôs not how everyone plays. Weight is a factor, but being negative is no different than being at 0. In this quest you don‚Äôt need to carry much weight and so boots of lightness can cancel out most of the weight you have to carry. I did this quest never having touched an agility course and never failed a single jump. Of course that‚Äôs partly RNG, but even if I had failed a few times it isn‚Äôt worth grinding low level rooftops to get the marks for graceful. 
---
Haha nah that‚Äôs engine work

Right, but IIRC your previous name is held for you for a period of time in case you decide to change it back, right? That's what I'm asking about. Can't change my alt to my original name if it's still being held.

Why are you doing NMZ if it makes you bored? The main benefit of NMZ is that you don't have to pay attention to the game but once every 20 minutes. If you're sitting there watching your character auto-retaliate you might as well go engage in real content instead of coloring tiles.
---
Don't need FPS to do NMZ
---
I know youre trying to sound smart and I usually let people on this sub take their W when they can since most are pretty depressed irl but the guy you were replying to was making a joke.
---
Steph Nuggets add me! I started playing recently and Would love people to chat to who are playing the game to reminisce about the old days
---
My bad. I thought I was obviously being sarcastic. Sorry squirt.
---
yeah... Definitely not worth going double 99 exp just for the tome. It's not THAT good even for an iron.
---
For consistency sake, they could make the dragonhunter weapons not work on Olm, which would refute my suggestion as well.
---
BUT because they already work, they may as well do this. I get you don't want olm nerfs but this is a glaring inconsistency.
---
Besides, being properly equipped against bosses was always part of this game.

Most pures cant even get no pray fire cape which is insanely easy compared to the inferno.

Go to edge and you will see a lot of pures who have it. Ask them any general knowledge question about inferno or their strategy to get it and I'm sure you won't get a proper answer

The other reply does a pretty good job explaining it, but tl;dr: the entire editing community got fed up with Wikia's ads and bad decisions, and left Wikia to start the new official wiki with Jagex's help.
---
Nobody has been updating the old wiki since September (e.g. your link doesn't have any recent quests), and the old site is slowly withering away. Support the wiki community and Jagex, not Wikia's moneygrubbing. They don't deserve your clicks.

Great idea

Start of DMM Tournament - randomly assigned a team. Final hour of DMM Tournament - randomly assigned a team. This way there's little incentive for clans to try to qualify multiple accounts. Also, limit trading to the GE only (to prevent feeding/muling) and make it impossible to attack a player from the same faction.
---
A simpler explanation:
---
Think of it like you're locked in a Walmart and you have to build a house.
---
Normally you would just go to the hardware store, and the paint store, and have the contractors come in.... and get everything you need. But he can't do that, it's only a Walmart and it's only him.
---
So its like, how do you get the wood (the armor he wants)? There isn't wood in Walmart, but he realizes that he can use the crates that the boxes come on and has to spend 100 hours disassembling them. But he has no hammer. So figures out there is a miniature one (rune scimitar) in a toy set, so he will have to do it with that (takes MUCH longer and is harder to use)...and after all this, hes trying to build a mansion (theater of blood boss) not just fight an easy boss (normal house).

I've been a F2P member for 2 weeks, in which time I've reached a combat level of 45 and completed every quest except Dragon Slayer. An incredibly generous person saw me farming cow hides near Lumbridge, and gifted me 3.8mil GP so that I can buy a bond.
---
Before I cash it in, I need to know: how can I best use 14 days of membership to gain enough money to buy another bond? Id love to be a member, but i don't want to spend any IRL money to maintain membership 
---
Holy shit I would actually buy membership again just to play this

it really shocks me that when you make a new account theres no option of like "keep my settings" or something... i swear the login thing wasnt even there when i first started using RL, but i might be wrong about that. either way, if they want people to use the login feature they should make it a little more intuitive and easy to get your settings moved over.
---
I'm gonna be the devil's advocate here and just say that the dude didn't "call it" a circle jerk, he asked a question. 
---
I did it in one try with this armor...
---
He also however states some impling drop is gonna fix that. But that's probably years away.
---
The people saying they'll pass tickle me. Literally why the suggestion features a toggle, just for you fine folks. Whether or not it'll happen is irrelevant (it won't), I just find it hilarious you would pass on an optional opt-in feature that doesn't impact you in any way, shape, or form, and can be ignored completely.

Real story:  
---
I was working on a discord bot for my CC, and I typed:  
---
"Alright, gonna test this bot out then boom baby, we got this shit automated!" -&gt; Referring to the automation of our CC by using a discord bot.   
---
Unfortunately that message got put out to the entire GE I was standing in at the time, because I forgot the "/". Boy did I look like an idiot and probably get reported several times.  
---
Did you see what he attempted to do in this video? Going for the chance of not only getting a casket, but getting the item(s) he needed. The chance was so depressingly low I was baffled he even attempted it. I doubt nothing anymore
---
No, its that high level mains can generally tank solo pures, especially since they'll usually have better gear.
---
Level 60-90 mains are just awful in terms of PKing stats.
---
Gl I went 20 games dry and said fuck it 
---
What will you be training on? Obby, Berserker and obby sword is also a reasonable option 
---
I started playing again 4 months ago. I took a similar approach. I‚Äôd say stick to it, I had no idea what wintertodt was at the time so never did it but I think for the cash and the free fm xp go for it. As for the agility I did bang out 45-50 ish for some graceful pieces which helped a lot. So I‚Äôd say stick to your plan, bang out quests for easy training and when you get bored do some money makers and train quest req skills. I just got my quest cape today and doing a lot of quests at a low level has definitely helped with that since I never had to go back and do low level quests. Also, use all your lamps on runecrafting. 
---
The account was just started a week ago and I got all my combat skills to 50+ and 22 slayer, 61 wc, 61 smithing and lost my 2 mill and bank, full samurai armor, and amulet of fury

Some players refuse to discuss buffing because there may be a handful of players that profit off of it. This always leads to a pointless argument that leaves me with a headache when all I want is to discuss game design. Well here's a couple things to think about:
---
1. The OSRS community freaks out when even the tiniest thing gets nerfed so the only thing left to talk about are buffs.
---
2. The OSRS team has shown they'll poll buffs and the community has shown they'll vote for them. At this point I think its unreasonable to attack a person who has a suggestion. Its an efficient way to make old content as playable as new content. 
---
3. The entire community profits from a well designed rework because they get to play fun and varied content. Yeah a couple assholes profit monetarily by doing nothing but its impossible to prevent that unless you want to wipe the item from the game and scam everybody who obtained it. 
---
4. The amulet of the damned is an extremely common drop at 1/16. It would go up, as buffed items certainly do but then crash when people find out its a great, easy money maker with the ezscape flamtear bracelet.
---
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed my vision of a more fun game.
---
Looks pretty mad, send it to one of the art mods
---
What type of death? It's untradeable, so on a death outside the wilderness (which I'm not sure why you'd wear rogue equipment in the wilderness, but I also don't have it myself so I really have no idea), you would keep it in your inventory. In the wilderness I'm guessing it would be destroyed on death.
---
Could do some Blast Furnace smithing. That's not bad money.

A buddy and I got a few ppl to help us wrangle the bots and trap them in Juliet's house. The bots are funny but clutter up the get tooooo much
---
I did tell him ‚Äúhow to play‚Äù, I just guided him in the right direction in order to have more fun. 
---
He hadn‚Äôt played since way back in rs2 and asked me how to train prayer, so I took him to Rimmington world 330 and showed him in game how to effectively train prayer. Way better than burying big bones from hill giants back in the day 
---
Perdu I believe. He's also in the lumby and Camelot spawn areas (presumably fally and edge too) on pvp world's.
---
G.E. Spirit tree is pretty nice. Even for btw's. 
---
I'm talking about dieing in ardougne, so I would keep it in inventory after death then?
---
Dropped by possibly a new dragon-themed boss. 
---
E.g. Leviathans etc.
---
Do you know of any other commands than the ones listed above?
---
And when did you trap them?
---
Have you seen any in member worlds?
---
yes runelite.net
---
Yeah they could definitely do a better job

---
I agree. 
---
wow ty. if im being honest here i tried it about a month or 2 ago and just now thought itd be nice to have again, and i didnt think to check if it was updated at all.... gonna check this out thnx so much for the reply.
---
Nice
---
yikes
---
They're literally all scammers, I don't know of a single one that uses an entire table.  
---
You might think 54-100 doubles my money? that's almost 50/50. Yeah no, they might only roll 1-60 and your 50/50 odds suddenly turn into into 10% (if that even, some of them go so far as to use slot machine logic &amp; only roll losing values except for pre-determined roll #'s.
---
Cant wait for you to fight our real bosses, Jad is just the beginning tbh; It may be sacred but there is some bosses that are similarly mechanically complex to RS3's.
---
&gt; In terms of non-wilderness or non-pvp deaths you pretty much always keep untradables or they drop to the ground on death unless you die in a instanced area e.g. fighting Vorkath in which case they are either lost or are found within the item reclaim chests for the respective area.
---
This just has me totally and utterly confused :(
---
Do you lose untradables in instanced areas or not? Do you keep them on death or do they drop to the ground?
---
I appreciate the answer, but you're essentially saying that you keep them unless you don't, which doesn't answer anything.
---
Just cast it earthwards for the peasants at the Grand exchange
---
oh cool! thanks for letting me know!

Huh not even that works. Something fucking weird is going on. 
---
It was bs lol. I was in mikadmm open cc and we were allies with bbdmm, but we were still a small clan. 
---
There was a huge team behind us so we had to move, we got barraged and chinned when we tried to enter the GDZ final area, most of my teammates died and I almost did but I managed to run across the other side outside of the safezone. Luckily there was another player on my clan that survived, we were getting harassed by this solo barrager, so we hid behind the tree after waiting for a couple minutes we said fuck it everyones dead might as well try to kill this player and we did, after that we killed another 4 solo players outside the safezone. 
---
There was 20 seconds left on the timer before we would get insta killed, so before the timer hits zero we ran in the safezone, I ran inside the desecrated temple, there was so many players and I lost sight of my teammate. I was just there standing in the middle beside a wall with protect magic running back and forth every few seconds, waiting to brew whenever I would get hit and trying to keep my stats up and finding potions to loot. I was doing this for like 10 minutes. 
---
Then the game was paused. There was 250 players left, my whole screen was filled with ground item texts, maybe thats why I didnt get focused, no one can see me under all of it. There was 3 players under me and also a Karil top and Ahrim bottom on the ground but we couldnt pick it up, then this player under me started typing a lot and starting conversations with people around us and bringing attention to us. We waited a long time so I hid all the unnecessary ground item texts and then before they resumed the game they removed all the loot from the ground so i was exposed, then they resumed the game and my fear came true we got piled by a clan.

Has a 7m limit or something

Omg this is a game changer

---
Go watch the latest swampletics video.
---
True lol
---
Ok, so now you have a clan 100, 33 of each faction. They travel together. And whenever they see a group of whatever faction, it's 66v10 instead of 100v10. 
---
Alternatively, a big group of 1 faction all team up, and the big clan can now send people to follow and scout everything they do, and there's no way to kill the scouts
---
Big clans can now scout out other groups with no risk of getting killed.
---
&gt; Also, limit trading to the GE only (to prevent feeding/muling)
---
That been suggested a million times, but wouldn't do anything, as rebuilding is so fast, you can just die to trade items to feed your best PVPers.
---
Now that old school is out, can you get banned for using things like google remote desktop for helping you do things on your phone while at a pc, like dart making / cleaning herbs /  stopping yourself from auto logging while holding a raid n needing to go to the bathroom etc. ?
---
Looks cool!
---
normal work days are 12 hours where?
---
To be fair, he'd definitely be perfecting it in those 2k hours hahahaha
---
I can't find a source to how they came around that 11% proc chance, but it most likely means an extra 10% of the usual chance (not flat chance)
---
So if the base chance is 10%, it goes to 11%
---
No, it means that the pre-diary proc chance is 10% and that is increased by 10% which results in 11%.  Not entirely sure if these are the correct values, but this is the principle. 
---
did you use long range the entire time?
---
If you don‚Äôt care about exp/hour then 100% Magics. 1100 per log as opposed to yews only being 280 or so
---
Tysm
---
HAH! You actually think there would not be sub-teams? Yeah, good luck with that. Look, I want to fix DMM as much as the next guy, but forcing players into teams doesn't really do...anything. The player-run clans will still not attack each other no matter what team they are on in-game and if the solution you propose to that is "disqualify the players that subvert the system," well, that could be doing that this whole time...but they don't...and this does nothing to fix that. It is just clanman mode with less legitimate player choice. 
---
Thanks for showing us this bad design.
---
Jk looks cool mate 
---
yeah that is what im using now but i was hoping for something with a notification sound before the aggro ran out. i also would like to use it for other applications outside of runescape.

Finally one person gets it..

This is the only team cape id actually wear. Would look cool with an ancient staff.

Bond and construction

why aren't you allowed to wear pineapple rings in your finger slot

Depends what you want. Definitely a bond. Then maybe obsidian armour set if you want to train melee stats. Don‚Äôt forget the necklace.

In the video he says that if a new clue scroll drops, it resets the counter and it's back on step 1.

That's truth on the brassard, it might not have a lot of uses but it's not one of the coolest pieces of gear, I don't know what is.

Ok thanks! I didn't know this and it's not in the new wiki!  So like if you get assigned a wilderness boss or a God wars boss you can decline without losing points?

If its real popular (eg seed vault, sandstone, bucket packs) maybe month or two?

if you really dont wanna pros+prot melee id keep going to 70 def and barrows gear will help you a lot

Youve had to many tendies so the ring doesnt fit.

Aren't these items already in shops though? So it really shouldn't affect ironmen.
---
Haters will say this is fake.
---
No they won't, because nobody cares about someone with a quick 99. It has no use, no idea why the OP even made this post. Camo top sure, that requires skill, but this doesn't.

&gt;FTP
---
If you paid any attention at all during this video you might understand why that is. 
---
Upvote if you would come into my room.
---
Technically yes, but in a previous video he was adamant on not being carried through so I doubt it. My best guess is that it‚Äôs limited to only gear he could reasonably achieve outside of ToB. 
---
I downvoted this.
---
Did you seriously just ask this question?
---
Yeah lad mad as fuck this lads a mad chad.
---
You have a balance, a crippling addiction would disregard almost
---
every other aspect. I believe mental health is a huge contributing factor and it is so disappointing how jagex flat out deny any responsibility. The clan I am in has a guy with 200m all on rs3, he still plays a minimum 10+/day.

I get you completely on this. When I got back into OSRS it felt so good doing that trek up to Varrock for the first time in 13 years, but now I'm all about cutting down time and teleporting everywhere
---
Devs are obsessed with making drop tables worth more and more everytime by adding items like these... 
---
I quit back in october and lost enjoyment in the game due to it being increasingly easier and easier to earn money, and levels. 
---
Making the game better and having longevity is great, but not when you continuously make it easier and easier to do everything and cater people who limit themselves. 
---
This is one reason I never liked Mod Kieren. I used to watch the Q&amp;As every week and almost every week he would say ‚Äúyes that‚Äôs a great idea‚Äù to something that would make the game a lot easier and simple.
---
Doing a few things here and there are great, but when you continuously do it, it ruins the game and makes it so easy. 
---
Shift click drop
---
Shift click fill rune pouches
---
Automated banking with x 
---
Making everything catered to left clicking to make it go as quick as possible
---
Realistically the game has gone so far away from its original state, or even a game that represents Old School
---
Go ahead down vote this but I realized this years ago and tried to keep playing but it started getting worse and worse so I quit because I didn‚Äôt like the direction the mods took the game.
---
And btw, they rig the way polls are done in order for stuff to pass... have fun (:

aww yeah they should have kept the economy breaking bug in the game to save you from having to redo your dailys...

i don't think it should be the tzhaar staff. That staff should have a different update in its own right.

The dragonhunter staff would probably just be a drop from a new future dragon-related boss.

98 range, I have full elite void and no rigour. If I want to go to fight caves for jad pet/slayer tasks, should I use void? also if I switch to dragon darts for jad, could I out DPS healers? thanks

I'm curious, did you think it was a bot at first seeing as no normal human would ever kill that many vampires or were you out looking for him?

Seems weird to me that you let other people memeing about something affect your enjoyment of said something.

I also find the memes a bit annoying, but since they're standalone from the series itself I don't see how that can and should affect your enjoyment of the series.

Working in a kitchen in a restauraunt is the worst experience of my life. Cooking in most jobs is not like what you think it is. Is the skill hard? No. But the labor itself takes a toll.

Thanks for the reply!

I agree 100 percent its weird.  No idea why he gave me the money or came to me.  Im level 9 so I had nothing to offer him.

You pretty much nailed my concerns.  I know nothing about networking, so please forgive, but could this person get things like my bank account info?  I havent logged into my bank account since before I came across him, but I am apprehensive to sign on in the future as well.

Some people abuse this though by begging at the grand exchange. When someone in half bronze armour shouts "selling 13 trout" that's what's going on.

I think often with new players the best bet is not immediately trying to get them to do max xp/hr methods but instead letting them figure it out, but then if they ask offering them help. Ie, letting him to train to ~30 burying bones before he turns to you for advice.

Good sport

Yea hes the man to ask

This is actually a masterpiece picture.

What's stopping jagex from adding there own npc in certain areas and auto muting this kind of stuff?
---
Just remember to pay it forward one day. I would be willing to bet someone hooked that player up in their noob days and they wanted to keep it going. :) 
---
Because the bots would just change what they say constantly 
---
It doesn't make sense for it to block it, and no one would use it if it did.
---
Not true at all.

put it @ prif and give the new crystal tools as rewards. insective to play, recharge the tools only for points at stealing creation shop. done
---
Is there a reason he stays only in one place ? Like is this his thing ?
---
It was 48 hours but yes It's for 2 hours now. The reason has something to do with it doesn't take 2 days for the average person to vent. 2 hours tends to help. As for muting botters it made it worse. It should change in mute time by what you're reporting the player for.

I would try dmm if this was the case. Being an iron man and a pvmer this seems like a nice entrance to pking without being a solo with no friends and just getting stomped by clans.

you're a genius. you deserve to be well compensated
---
Give me their 100m and I‚Äôll be your friend in their places :)

Well what's going to stop people from ignoring the system and just group together as a clan. With voice chat and calls you have a huge advantage I doubt the big clans would actually use this.

split 4 way or solo, why such difficult thing

This post violates rule number 5.

Seeing lots of comments about how badass this guy was, did he play loads of ToB and do lots of bossing? Anyone care to give a quick overview of his run? Seems like a massive loss

But you have to bear in mind that the items price changes over time so if an item doesn't sell/buy for weeks, its price may have changed to something completely different.

One of your maxed friends literally made a thread about this situation a couple days ago lmao

For anyone that doesn't know, this is the (ex) hardcore with hundreds of ToB KC, an Ely and almost every notable PvM drop in the game.

Very sad day but I think we've learned that dying on a hardcore is just an inevitability if you do dangerous content due to disconnections.

Dont be a dick. Go with what you agreed previously.

He uses a client called runelite. You can get it at runelite.net, but make sure it's _exactly_ runelite.net when you download it, there are fake sites that will give you a fake version of the client to steal your account

It's probably partially people like me who just don't really watch their content but haven't really bothered unsubbing cause they still occasionally put up stuff that interests me.

Even if the majority of their content is whatevs.
---
It‚Äôs been talked about many times throughout the years and the main excuse they use that it ‚Äútakes too much time and engine work‚Äù makes sense with this one.  Stealing creation just due to how it worked back in the day is a big project for the team with its current size and resources, if the community were to really want it it would be an update the would have to replace one of the big content updates for whichever year it came out (e.g. this content is large enough that it would replace something like Kebos, Priff, Warding, etc. just to name a few of the current updates that size.)

Could be his net mate.

I honestly think prims/tassets  and a torture with a w torso are a better looking combo instead of bcp with veracs anyways.

---
If ya want to see the old stealing creation this is probably not the move as with this type of reward system the main people you are going to force into the mini game is higher level players as prif is going to only be unlocked by a grandmaster quest.  If you make it content locked to where only high level players can access it, it‚Äôs going to become more of a chore than a fun mini game.
---
If you really want to see Stealing Creation take off and be a relevant thing for a while and not die off like other mini games it needs to be in a place that is accessible and playable by any level account and just more efficient for higher level accounts.  With rewards balanced accordingly.

I dont really know how controversial something like this would be, but given how dangerous TOB is even if you dc (last I heard of, dc without death means death? idk could be wrong). What if there was an item similar to the teleport (or even just the teleport) that allowed you to use it on members of your party with accept aid on.
---
Considering how this item would work, there is room for refinement to prevent being an idiot and trolling idk.
---
The way I see it, HCIM losing status over a dc is pretty shit, almost forcing them to use backup internet to ensure they survive a dc that might not be their fault (blackout etc). 
---

A new say crossbow that's basically the equivalent of the twisted bow in dps would be about the same price bc the second it's a 100m less expensive ppl will but and vice versa.

Man if only plugins could be disabled so you don‚Äôt have to use them......oh wait, they can! Imagine that!
---
There are only two ways for this to happen and it was due to your carelessness. They had access to your email and was able to turn off the Authenticator, if this happened they would have deleted any emails regarding what they were doing, this means you‚Äôre using old passwords that are compromised. Or you got recovered, in that case, someone else knows enough of your old passwords, security answers, membership payment details, creation details, and all sorts of stuff that nobody but you should know, and was about to use account recovery to bypass the authenticator. Also, before you start shouting like a dummy about authenticator delay, this wouldn‚Äôt have helped you at all, like 99% of cases, as you mention last login was over 100 days ago.

That page is for both osrs and rs3, as you can see by the logos at the top. Since you havent played rs3 in a long time, but you've been playing osrs, you must've done something in osrs. Sucks

Fake. Knowing Abyss, these "randoms" are most likely members of his own clan. Abyss is trying to act like he was a ddosing, edating, doxxing scum bag a few months ago for a majority of the time he's played this game. Just pathetic.

If it was about kids getting a Jmod's attention is only going to make it worse.  The reason I know vaguely what happened the last time is because the Jmods came out and posted it.  You might end up getting other accounts banned if you have any.  Since you're not denying that you potentially made an edgy joke about kids I'm assuming that might be the case.  If it is you should probably just cut your losses and make an ironman dude you're just gonna get filet'd by Reddit if they find out what you said.

I mean, who said you have to gamble tons of money for it to be fun..? Like I think all of your are missing the point. Even if I had lost money overall I wouldn't really care. I do it because knowing I could lose money makes it exciting and fun. Winning releases a load of endorphins, that's why people can get addicted to going to casinos and stuff.

Well, killing the same monster 16000 times for a drop where you have no chance of other drops makes it a lot harder to obtain that item. Over time you'll likely kill hundreds of thousands of monsters, so it is indeed easier to get :)

that's what happens when you try to actually play the game on a HCIM, or any account for that matter. you die to the servers or worst of all, your own internet!

They could reasonably re-draw the teams every 24 hours to avoid this issue.
---
Do all high level hardcores just die to disconnects? Have any of them died to just being totally stupid?

Josh?

Large fries? Yes sir that will cost 600 upvotes and a silver

If you randomise the teams every 24 hours it would negate the issue of people forcing a specific team.

I'm looking to grind out my magic to 99 soon. I've been killing brutal black drags to level my ranged and was wondering if there were any combat involved equivalents for magic. I liked the idea of being able to make some money as I go.

As far as barraging goes I wanna say when I was doing slayer nechs were about break even if I picked up some stuff, there's dust devils also, and there's always monkeys but that's just a money pit. Are there any other aoe options?

Also are there any ST spell options that aren't just absolutely dirt slow?

Thats amazing to hear. I hope you are doing better now. I didnt know I could respect can anymore than I already do,  he is genuinely a great guy.

I think what people forget is that there's a difference between poking fun and just insulting people's work. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b8yrin/the_mimic_boss_room_looks_like_its_straight_outta/) is a great example. Mod Ghost spends 2 weeks designing this boss and the top post on it 'this shit look straight outta kingdom hearts on the PS2'. Imagine spending two weeks working on a project and the primary response is 'wow i don't like it' with no suggestions for improvement. It's disheartening. I have no issue with poking fun at Jagex or providing constructive criticism on their work, but there's an obvious difference between that and just mindlessly insulting people's work. 
---
It's not really gatekeeping unless it's unrealistic, every account maybe barring skillers or certain pvp builds should have f cape and b gloves

Sociologically that is not the definition of a minority. You could be a group of people that make up the majority of the population and still be a minority if you experience social inequalities and don't have the same opportunities as the group in power does.
---
I never used any ad hominem attacks lol. If you're referring to my example of your tattoo, I never had an opinion on it, I just brought it up as a personal example to help it make more sense to you. 
---
How is you saying that playing games improves reaction time and critical thinking less of a justification then people who say playing poker improves critical thinking by having to calculate the odds. 
---
Even if you spend no money on games I could have responded to you saying I'm going to end up in a box by saying "I'd like to check in in 20 years when you're still living in your moms basement as a high school drop out because you decided to play video games instead of doing homework and now you're an adult with no skills at all, besides good reaction times and critical thinking i guess" I want you to see that the money aspect of gambling isn't what links it to video games, it's the endorphin release that you can become addicted too. Yea if you play video games in moderation (which is exactly what I pointed out before) then it's fine and probably you do get some sort of reflex and critical thinking bonus, but if you get addicted and sucked in, even if you don't spend money, if you never leave the basement and just sit in front of the computer for 16+ hours a day, how is that less of a "mentally destructive behavior"
---
Tl;dr there is no difference between someone who gambles a little bit every once in a while and someone who plays videos games every once in a while. But I'm both cases if the activity consumes your life then it is a "mentally destructive behavior" they can be compared based on the fact that you get addicted to the endorphin release involved. 
---
sucks cause I really didn't want to go into p2p on this account and honestly thought that I had used a bond this way before on a free account. Obviously I was wrong.

Let's just ignore the context of the post and forget that basically no women play runescape, relative to the number of men who do.

Women are considered a minority by MANY social scientists. Sociologically being a minority refers more to power than it does to number of people.

With a face like that you should keep it on
---
Honestly this is a good reply and very true. I'm glad to see you guys have thought of the options out there. I hope to see changes because the current setup is getting kinda stale for me personally (as a viewer, I don't play DMM)
---
And change the system that ppl who are interested in learning to pk are going to the wildy and kill pvmers or ppl who are doing clues. Make them interested to go fight in pvp or bh in edge. For example as update that you can unlock a new thing from the slayer master (a handy teleport for slayer tasks, an item or whatever) but you need kills in pvp/bh to unlock them together with x amount of slayer points. Like how more kills you have the better beneficial things you can unlock. Pvp kills aren't even tracked yet, yet for pvm kills and clues everything is tracked. Or like the slayer master concept of osrs, add a pvp master and make you earn points by getting kills in pvp and bh and be able to unlock and buy shit with it at the pvp master. Current pk reward system with mysterious emblems is worthless to me because BH is always dead or I get deep wildy targets (probably clans or pvm/clue killers).

every game has random disconnects from time to time. i play runescape 10+ hrs a day every day and i get DC'd maybe once a week (and i think its honestly probably less than that). i think a lot of people blame RS for their own connection or simply exaggerate
---
Well it's not combat and might be a little mind numbing but I worked by way to 99 by Humidifying Clay, Superglass make (which got me to 90 Crafting too) and Tan Leather on dragon hides. All around 500-800k gp/h depending on GE prices.

Issues involving money are always dealt with in a timely manner at any company, even ones where people talk about slow support, because if they are slow or shitty, people would dispute payments, and enough disputes gets them dropped from card companies like Visa.

I don't need to remind you what Jagex did to free trade and the wilderness when refunds were threatening their visa support in the past.

All this being said, I believe the higher your points are, the more likely you are to get an extra reward from the crate. Most people get to 500 and then just stop, but I‚Äôd recommend you go hard all game - more exp and a slightly better chance at an extra item.

I would really like to see a focus back on clans again. The most fun I used to have in RuneScape back in the day was the clan fights in F2P at greater demons that would sometimes go on for hours. Now, we all don't have to do that anymore and it seems to me that no one bothers doing clan fights anymore because it's just not worth the time compared to raiding for 1B drops.
---
Pures still seem to have giant 50+ player fights every weekend in the wilderness. Big fights like these are fun. If there could be tournaments and some balance brought to PvP so make multi clan fights fun again.

When I was five I asked my parents why there was Fathers Day or Mothers Day, but no Childrens Day. They responded by saying "Silly Hemlor, every other day is Childrens Day." There's no white history month because that's every month, no straight pride week because that's every week. This wasn't hard for me to grasp at 5 I have no idea why there are so many guys out there that somehow think these things are an attack on themselves.

Ah, I think there was another one where some dude said something about kids though.  I probably mixed up some of the details somewhat.  That guy might not have actually had the police called then, but he was perma banned.

You‚Äôre retarded. You lose nothing if you dc in DMM - you lost a chance at winning a tournament that you had a 1/256 chance of winning. Boo hoo. It doesn‚Äôt even compare to losing an entire account built around the entire idea of not dying.

School emails aren't generally the best emails to use, and people can without doubt get access to them. Also, some malware can hide in the background of the computer, making virus/malware detection software pretty useless. One of 3 things are happening right now:

2. You clicked some fishy shit and have a RAT or you entered info on a phishing site

Why?

I'd try this out but keep in mind some teams would BS and leak information to their real team (whichever of the 3 teams ends up getting the most members, or something along those lines).  ROT actually spies on enemy clans pretty regularly by having people join those clans and leaking information.

I suggest mentioning this in the official Runelite discord or creating an issue on their GitHub repository describing your issue with screenshots where applicable.

Oh yeah, guess you do.
---
My account got a manual permanent ban when I was not playing the game. Took about 6 weeks of ignored Reddit posts, people telling me I would never get my account back, I cheated etc.....then I realised you can appeal the ban.
---
Got unbanned as soon as someone looked into it.
---
Calm down Rudy
---
&gt;why bcp over prims it rarely even gives you a max hit over obby plate, it's only +1 str higher
---
Because obby plate has shit defensive bonuses. Most people are using barrows armor when they go to bandos

On my local branch I have the ability to type in the item, then the preferred first option.

Random would just make clans roll accounts until they all got what they wanted.

I think adding in Zaros/Arma/Bandos would be great, 3 gods is too few imo.
---
Why is this?
---
This happened to me too. I had stopped playing for years and when u decided to log on i was perma banned

big fact, im stupid

I was trying to avoid going onto p2p servers with this account but wanted to change its name. If I realized I would not be able to redeem a bond for a name change on f2p servers I would have just gone p2p and left it at the G.E./f2p areas after the name change.  
---
Well there it is, hopefully more people see this. 
---
"f2p" pure account. 
---
Right, I suppose even if you let them choose their team the ones that would have died to their friends on the other team are still oing to do so.  
---
So randomizing the teams is probably a good idea. Also yes I believe you would need proper distribution of players throughout teams, you don't necessarily need lots of teams, you just need to make sure no single team is too strong.
---
Why even input
---
It's like medieval times around here where at 4pm everyone gets together to watch the hanging, and then afterwords make it to the pub/inn and get drunk together while discussing how great the hanging was.
---
To outsiders and people reviewing history they say "why would they waste their time doing something so barbaric", and idk just something so gratifying about hearing that floor give out as everyone watches the poor schmuck swing back and forth.
---
In this case a hanging could be substituted for the phrase Jmod smackdown, but of course this is assumed by the reader as jmod smackdowns are synonymous with hangings ever since the great Tracying of last month. Some say Tracy is still out there today trying to haunt Twitter looking for rectification from those who slew her.
---
since it literally just links to their faq, yes. this reminds me to actually go see if i got a reply on twitter. ty
---
Top post and all the upvotes are defending it.
---
Is this a dedicated f2p acc? I definitely understand feeling a little dirty making it p2p, even for such a non game play effecting thing. 
---
Karamja-only iron man had something like that happen to him minus the blowpipe haha
---
Yeah I've been wondering this as well. Tbow is invincible because you literally need it for half the content. But scythe? I can't think of it being used anywhere other than tob and bandos, and I hadn't considered that you tag the minion at bandos with it. The guy saying he uses it at sire is delusional because you hit 70s with tbow for 1/5th the price. 
---
I think what's happening is that the volume of scythe is really low compared to tbow. The merchants have decided that they are willing to pay 1.5b to turn around and flip it for 1.51b. The fact that it has much higher margins than the tbow--which is often within 1m--suggests that there is a bit of a lack of confidence in its current price. Merchants are likely aware that as more come into the game it will inevitably crash due to low usability. 
---
Of course if it does crash beyond a certain point then the people who lost money on it will come together and petition jagex to buff it. At that point it would be smart to buy it in anticipation of it going up. I think the right price point for that would be 1.2b because 1180m will create the perfect reddit narrative "wow scythe is cheaper than tbow now because it's so useless."
---

on my part, obviously. would have just sucked it up and exchanged the bond for mems if i realied doing the other option would be useless anyway.

This doesn‚Äôt make sense

It's like the same conversation of people calling Idris Elba "African American." Some people really don't realize that words sometimes are, or aren't, applicable in different situations than they're used to.

I used to think that when I was younger but then realized all the reward points/cash back you get. I get like a grand back and a bunch of air miles  every year just from using a credit card for any purchase i can.

That‚Äôs the entire point - you can have the exact same gameplay, **for free** with runelite. You don‚Äôt have to use any add-one you don‚Äôt want to.

The typo is in "Riki the sculptor's model"'s dialogue in Keldagrim.

Depends a bit on your ranged level but just off a guess you will most likely use 200-300 darts. So I would say bring at least 500 if not more just to be safe 
---
You literally make more money killing bosses in the time you do a herb run.
---
Nobody is forcing people to play HCIM.

They know what its like before going in.

Also, you're hilarious if you think Jagex has the capability to deal with any additional support requests. When they quite clearly struggle/fail with what they have already.

herbs take time to do. it's not a ton, but you make more money off pvming for that same amount of time, and any time spent doing herbs *could* be spent doing trees for like 50x more xp, so it's a waste to do herbs as far as efficiency is concerned.
---
That said, I don't think the average player should be that concerned with efficiency, and I think herb runs are a great way to make a lot of money over time and get a 'free' skill to 99.
---
Msb i has 50%specs instead of 55

99% of the time, "I got banned and it was unfair" falls apart pretty quickly once you start reading the context.

I never made it. Its something that was posted here a while ago about this exact situation and was titled something along the lines of "When your blowpipe runs out of scales in the middle of the fight caves" or something like that.

Can you post the tab to this?
---
thank you man :)
---
There's like 10 posts about this already haha

And plugins like this make it able to be a game for me.

It's not a perfect solution. The best outcome would be to have something like this, and be able to change the font size.

Noob question but how do you do that in runelite? I would love to rearrange left click and right click options, like making ‚Äúpickpocket‚Äù default left click where applicable 
---
No but no checking your scales before you do the fight caves makes you seem pretty dumb. 
---
I did that setup for about 500 kc with &lt;95 ranged, usually i would dump specs on first kill and have at least 1 spec for the next kill. If I hit that spec then I kill, if not I teleport. Rinse and repeat until out of supplies.
---
I was ranked in thievinghost cc about a year ago. I was a pretty popular splasher since i splashed like 12 hrs a day, and i got to know people over the course of a few weeks. One day someone asked in the cc ‚Äúcan you still autoclick ardy knights‚Äù 
---
I had then said ‚Äúmy dad works for jagex, youre getting banned for autoclicking. Give me all your gp now‚Äù
---
The cc owner then banned me for attempting to scam, i never splashed at ardy knights again, went straight to rats after that

You only plan on 1 kill trips? If not, switch to all sharks and get two dose antivenom+. You can definitely do 2 kill trips consistantly. If you want 3+ kills/trip, then switch to mantas.

One thing worth noting is that Resurrect Crops is not factored into the profits; it essentially cuts the costs of planting expensive seeds like Ranarr by a decent amount! It doesn't change much other than to favour Ranarrs highly at a high farming level in practice, though.
---
That scimmy is so out of place man!
---
Actually, i believe in max range gear and rigor, BP even with bronze darts is better DPS than scythe, you can check the 'Gear' Discord made by I believe Turnii and Gerkinz? What this doesn't mention however its thats in a team setting, you dont want to be soloing Bandos with a BP.

Main point of this paper was a comparison with real world markets tho

If someone was to recover an account through the website, the authenticator is completely removed. The authenticator is only useful to people who access your account via password, but does nothing to stop someone attempting to recover your account. People are advocating that there is a delay in which the removal happens. Hopefully this delay would allow the real owner of the account time to recover and secure their account.

Slayer since you're new to members, farming isnt profitable till higher up, you have a better slayer lvl just grind that out, or just farm the shit out of green drags for a day or two!

Often science articles will have a very brief one sentence ‚Äúconclusion.‚Äù They usually do a very brief ‚Äúintro‚Äù talk about results briefly and give a tiny hint at the discussion and conclusions section. Calling it a true conclusion is wrong though. I agree with you on that.
---
Tested it out with both max hit dummies. I hit a 31 on a normal on with gear, no prayer or boosts, and then I hit a 36 on the Slayer dummy.
---
I got dust devils from her for the smoke area, and went to the catacombs. Boosted attack and hit 5 31s in the wrong area.
---
I feel confident that you only get the boost in the are assigned.
---
Yeah fr lol think he brought it for web

Just keep grinding slayer. Farming takes time and money before it pays off

I smashed out a half assed 12,000 word dissertation I didn‚Äôt really care about in 4 days, was the worst 4 days of my life, sleep deprived, hallucinations and immense pressure. I ended up getting a 2:1 (equivalent to a B?) for it so was happy in that regard. But if I did it on something I was genuinely interested in, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have felt like a chore and maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have procrastinated doing it until the very end.
---
fun is subjective little guy
---
I'd farm run in between slayer runs. Just do whatever is the most profitable herb at any given time.
---
Eventually when you get to the higher slayer/combat levels, it isn't hard to keep a bond if you play a decent amount. 
---
Just nerding out at barrows for a few days easily made a bond. 
---
Can you elaborate?

---
it literally takes minutes to do a herb run and you profit 150k~
---
Lol, u genuinely think 1 str bonus is going to save you 2 hours before you can afford a bcp?
---
Yeah but Jagex doesn't even restore your shit if you get hacked
---
Big CCs tend to take things that are obviously ironic too serious.
---
Wait, so you're saying if the ban was for OSRS then it would be understandable...?
---
Most likely lol
---
Yeah this is true. Recently wrote my masters chemistry thesis still very fresh in my mind haha 
---
Not that I don't agree with you but that seems like something they'd just mute him over, it would have to be something real messed up for jamflex to outright ban him
---
It will be interesting to see if this leads anywhere
---
Fletch, molten glass, cook, redwoods, mlm. 
---
Do it. You wont.
---
Yeah, agility while watching a show is good.
---
Make sure you look up the best way to do this, and depending on whether your herbs die you can easily make 500k per day with maybe an hour of work total, after you‚Äôve figured out the runs to do (basically you tp as close to the patch as possible and then run the rest of the way).
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEpost
---
I've never had an issue with the herbs, but the seeds will definitely be nice. Will they be separate options so I can just have it on seeds, and not on herbs?
---
Ah yeah that makes sense if you're just looking for quicker cannon tasks and such. Have you tried smoke bursting/barraging them in catacombs? It's a decent bit faster than meleeing but does require some RNG to not be expensive for the exp
---
So they just box eachother

You can use the new [herb farming calculator](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) to see what profit you can expect from different herbs per patch
---
Slayer isn't really profitable until higher levels. After 70 you start unlocking some good monsters. Before that it's very hit or miss. Konar's Brimstone Keys can make up for bad tasks though.
---
That's not what hes asking. He's asking what's stopping those dragon picks from showing up in the collection log because he got them from vettion. This is because if you get something from one boss that is on another bosses drop table, it will show up for both.
---
agree completely with the xp efficiency of trees/herbs etc but i think you'd be hard pressed to profit 150k from a boss in the same time it takes to complete a herb run
---
its less points but more firemaking xp to not fletch.
---
If your goal is to get 99 FM and you dont care about the pet, you'll save alot of time not fletching at all.
---
If you goal IS the pet, you should fletch as much as you can to achieve the highest points possible.
---
Herb runs aren‚Äôt good efficient either :) sorry I‚Äôll stop being pretentious

---
yeah it broadcasts it out loud whenever you open the chest. this also happens in other places like gwd or corp.
---
you're totally right, i was just making a cheeky comment. the ultimate test of efficiency is "is this something i want to do?" cus if you dont wanna do it chances are you will get less xp a day/week doing the fast method you hate rather than the slow method you enjoy.

Power creep and inflation go hand in hand. It brings extra resources and items into the game for no extra effort, diminising the efforts of skillers and making expensive items more expensive because it's easier to make money.

My goal is gp/exp efficiency. Smoke barrage max hit is 35. Since the accuracy against the monkeys is the same as their magic def is 1, I can estimate that the GP/exp for smoke barrage is \~4.0-4.3 GP/magic exp. Although this is faster, I'm not willing to pay for it. I'm going to Ice Burst to 99 at 2.76 GP/Magic exp.

Would be very useful for mobile users, never pick up random shit by accident.

Low level slayer was always garbage. You'd wait until Nieve or Duradel to start slaying because Chaeldar and below give garbage tasks with stupid weightings. Now you have an option to go with Nieve for better xp for a horrendously slow skill or go with Konar who is more gp and points.

There's still a chance for it to die, and the numbers on the disease page specifically may be incorrect (Kieren may have made a mistake when giving us them). The general mechanics are known, but take those exact numbers with a grain of salt.

Maybe a little tip. There are some peer-reviewed published scientific articles that have researched Runescape specifically. I think you could incorporate them in your first page to give it more substance. You can find these by using things like Web of Science. Good luck with the thesis!

It takes less than 2 hours to get a torso. I don't see why people just become dead weight in barb assault because it's too much work to look up a 5 minute guide on how to play defender. Defender in all reality is the fastest and easiest roll of them all. All you do is place bait the same way in each wave and stand north of the east trap to stack up the runners. It's takes literally 2 minutes to kill all the runners.

I‚Äôm also farming vorkath I have 93 range and can always get 2kills, sometimes 3 if I get lucky on specs.

If I hit above 50 on the first spec of first kill I‚Äôll save my special for the next kill so I can spec twice with bgs. If I hit 0‚Äôs both times on first kill I usually still have enough supplies for second kill. Never tele out unless you don‚Äôt have enough supplies for kill

I agree that all skills should eventually get a teleport. However, I don‚Äôt want them to teleport the user to the best place to train the skill, but the matching guild. For example, Mining cape should teleport the user to Mining guild instead of Motherlode mine. 
---
Wintertodt is a though one, since the community has pretty much agreed that Wintertodt equals Firemaking. I personally hope the skill sees some future development instead of just being tied to one minigame.
---
Runecrafting, Smithing, Thieving and Agility are also difficult ones, since they are done all across the world and lack a guild-like hub.

Name checks out.

honestly it just seems spiteful that they even allow this.

they have code that specifically prevents non members from doing member stuff... but don't apply it to things that you can buy with real money?

I had only a jar, 2 tails, 5 ring pieces and 12 heads in 2500 kc. Got 3 claws i my next 300 kills though

Often times they just follow and ask over and over again. If I say no and they still ask I usually just teleport, but a lot of them are super persistent.
---
No clue tbh
---
no not in anyway shape or form, the duel arena is for people that want to stake there gp 1m-10b. a lot of players cant afford these types of duels. My suggestion encourages 1v1's between all players rich and poor. The reward would come from the items the losing player loses on death not gp. Also solves the item staking problem a lot of duelers have so thank you for strengthening my argument

1v1 takes skill and not just rng related.

Uh excuse me? Maybe a long time ago, but in the current stage of PvP thats just false. Maybe deep wildy tribridding 1v1s yes, are more skill related. However the GE/edge 1v1s are absolutely 98% reliant on RNG and just prod specs with ags/gmaul.

That's fine if you play as a team entity, but these guys are considering scamming a tbow. These people won't be playing as a team for long if this is how they act (proposing absurd splits and not honoring their splits).

I've been mulling this around for quite some time now, and I thought this would be a pretty sick addition to the game, and with Jagex asking for ways to reinvent or revise Deadman mode, this seemed like the perfect time to make a suggestion.

Can't have people joking now can we? if only we had another way to punish someone for making poor taste jokes on the game, like a mute function or something? nah probably requires engine work
---
What taking off armor and timing a venge stack? While yes, that will increase your odds youre still hoping for a prod spec because of the current combo foods available. You can eat nearly 60hp in a game tick meaning youre still relying on a huge spec. Also taking off your armor like that may work the first time, but anyone expecting it if theyre smart will eat accordingly especially knowing youve got a venge already on/or up to be cast. Sorry but RNG right now plays a bigger role than "skill" in PvP, considering youre not a complete potato and have some sort of experience (in the sense of knowing how to combo eat, watch for obvious baits such as degearing to stack a venge combo).
---
No clue, but they‚Äôre so cheap right now that investing in 1 at this price would probably be worth it lol
---
Yeah I most certainly had all Fs due to RuneScape 7th and 8th grade. Still went to HS. The surgery I had kept me out of school for like half of 7th tho anyways
---
No. 
---
I've made my own plugin that does this but rather than keeping it only for herbs/seeds I just expanded it for any item I want.
---
Do a couple quests for farming xp and plant ranarrs with ultracompost. Easy 150-200k or so for only 5 minutes of work. You can do these every hour and 20 minutes I think. Of course it‚Äôs worth trying to unlock as many herb patches as possible 
---
Does this mean buy?
---
I love my farming cape now! It‚Äôs almost as op as the crafting now, obviously not quite but still super close for unlimited tele in cape slot!

Ahaha I can only imagine I‚Äôm not the first in the threads to be saying the same thing.  I am apart of the problem.

Just gotta stay calm before and during the fight, deep breaths.
---
Classes RS community dialogue
---
Still is browser-based if using Internet Explorer.
---
generally curious, how is this issue not resolved by right-clicking or looking at the top of the screen?
---
As long as it doesn't replace the current perk. Personally, I don't think Teleports to Guilds should count as perks as they should still get a perk relevant to the skill. The point of Skillcape Perks was to give you a reason to wear the capes while using the skill; not just keep in your inventory to teleport.
---
i‚Äôve had some pets spawn underneath me and some spawn directly next to me. think its just random, so its not fake in that regard. the first point is very true though

He spent a lot of time researching random events, drop tables, trekking efficiency, and clue juggling. He researched the engine related stuff that there really hasn't ever been a need for until now because why on earth would anyone grind random events or Morytania clues?
---
Yes it does.
---
Never help a beggar. 9/10 they‚Äôre an experienced player who‚Äôs too lazy to make their own money.

Plant tree &gt; pay farmer &gt; cut tree once grown (or right click pay 200gp to remove).
---
Also try out fruit trees which are typically better xp/gp.  Once you unlock the farming guild things will really pick up.

You pay the farmer after you plant the sapling in the patch each time. Having them watch it ensures it wont die and grow fully. Depending on the cost of the protection payment and the tree while factoring in the disease rate will give you an idea whether its worth protecting. Generally it is and I would encourage it if youre learning. The payments can be given as notes so for willows each run take out your saplings and your noted basket of apples. You can pay 200gp to the farmer and they will clear the entire tree for you, which i again recommend as it saves time and most logs arent worth the effort to bank. If you chop the tree once its grown itll eventually leave a stump just like normal trees do. This will regrow just as other trees. Once it is a stump you can clear it completely with a spade and plant a new sapling to continue gaining farm xp.
---
Just FYI you misspelled grindiness in the intro
---
Clans are fantastic and it‚Äôs great to watch them in dmm

But these bosses they can probably do with little to no dmage taken anyways and i dont know i guess it could be good for P2 verzik but hard to use phase 3.

I guess if you really don't want to spend any money that's fine. Idk how far you should take it. You can efficiently do members content from lvl 3, you're still spending a part of your life trying to get enjoyment out of the game. Might as well do it with the extra perks. 
---
This is why I'd never even bother with it.  My main isn't even max combat and it's already died 3 different times from disconnection - twice due to my own internet, and once due to Jagex's servers.  3 unavoidable deaths and it's only got 100m xp.  Fuck that.
---
herb runs aren't gold efficient or anything on a main lol
---
It depends how they ask imo 
---
Why are they crashing 
---
Smithing is such easy money for low levels now too, like in the time they spent begging for maybe a couple hundred K they could've just made rune arrowheads/dart tips, killed chickens, or my current favorite of making kwuarm incense sticks, all of those are well over 1mil an hour gp which is way more than they'll need till they hit level 80.
---
Do you think its possible to make it so my mouse automatically moves and picks up the herb off of the ground? I really dont enjoy playing this game the way its intended to be played and would rather not look away from my netflix show to pick up some silly leafs. thanks in advance
---
probably because it's international 
---
No, that's actually exactly how it works. It's approximately a 300 hour grind to 99 rc doing bloods and then souls. If you do lavas, the grind is slightly more than half of that. You would save nearly 150 hours by doing lavas, and even with a shitty money making method, spending those 150 hours doing nearly anything else will make you more profit than doing it slow with bloods. This isn't just an opinion, this is fact. Numbers don't lie. However, I did not suggest lavas to OP because it is clear that he wanted to do rc afk. As for souls being less afk, they are *barely* less afk. It's still the same process. I would know. 99 rc btw. My advice for you is to take some time to learn about the concept of time cost though. Just because you don't believe it doesn't mean it's not the truth. 
---
Patience. Personally farming was a big help, after 99 agility, farming became my favorite skill, because it's extremely helpful to break the monotony. On top of that a herb run every 80 minutes will end up making you a nice cash stack and a decent amount of XP.

1. Sort of. New methods have have come out and people have learned a lot so in general I think XP rates have increased.
---
2. 75 range for a blowpipe. It's just so good.
---
3. Imo yes, it's worth it getting membership early. You can skip a lot of early levels through quests.
---
4. Depends on what you're doing but generally yes. 
---
5. It's pretty much always easy to make enough money for your level. It can be hard to make money for the best stuff at your level though. There are some things you can do early on that make good money though. If you get a coal bag, ice gloves, and 30 smithing you can do blast furnace making steel bars and make like 300k+ per hour pretty easily. I'd recommend taking a look at the [wiki money making guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide). It does use theoretical values though so  don't expect to make as much as they say.
---
6. Not really
---
7. Depends how you do it. I'm mostly training range through Slayer and Vorkath so I'm making a lot.

There's a WC guild?

Hey OP, I realise you're going more for research style but for a thesis you generally want a title page leading into contents and the like as it's going to be a large file normally. Although maybe you have a heavily restricted word count.

Also, an abstract should be a general summary of the work, including the results. Typically you want to write this last.
