Last I checked gold was .58 USD for 1m. I just did the math from there and saw it was 70k. The price has been dropping though.

You get maxed stats and hope someone doesn't scam you by switching rules. Than its 50/50 but your ev is like 48% or something

Crystal tool seed has hit its high alch price, around 300k.  I don‚Äôt think the displayed price has caught up yet.

I kinda just started making an alt while playing twisted league on the main.  it's currently at 197 qp 75att 89str 75 def in terms of prepping for rune dragons.  It's also living at bbd's right now (94 range started bbd's at 88) since that seemed like a good way to make my alt more self-sufficient, and not be 100's of mil in debt to the main.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The other guy is kinda right that it is like making a second main, but while I'm working on maxing the main I might as well do something else while bank standing right?  As for most rune drag alts being an iron's main I don't think that's all that true.  Sure there's definitely plenty of people who do that, but I personally know a guy who has two rune dragon alts running at all times, and they're definitely not just his irons main.  His main isn't even maxed he's basically a Zulrah prod and has absolutely ZERO interest in playing an iron.

You're complaining yet you've hit the 1/5k drop table eight times with 14k kills. Come and see my dry streak then you'll have something to complain about lol

Are there any unlocks I should point boost to right now before I start grinding out XP task to get to that level?

Have a brand new Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max with all of the updates necessary. I literally just got it yesterday. There‚Äôs no way it could be my phone. I literally only have like three applications on it, two photos. Maybe they did not optimize it for this new phone? I mean but it‚Äôs been out for a while
---
Best area in the game. I always felt weirdly content here.
---
Huh? Kodai would still be BiS ..everywhere.. it provides more magic attack and defense bonus and the same % boost bonus. And I'm not sure why you *wouldnt* consider the rune discount. It makes a huge difference. The kodai is better in almost every way. 
---
Why do you think it would only be BiS at smoke devils when it's clearly superior? 
---
&gt;But why should the nightmare attachment be given to a minigame reward thats easily bottable instead of one of the rarest items in the game dropped by one of the lategame bosses?
---
What? The nightmare is a group boss. What bottable minigame are you talking about? And what do you mean by nightmare attachment? The siren's charm? or the orbs? Both are dropped by the nightmare which is a boss.
---
Worked fine on my iphone 8 and ipad 6 today.

I suck at zulrah but the way I was able to beat him (her?) was doing a ranged only setup with a bunch of brews. It will take longer, but you can learn the phases without worrying about your switches.

Is there a certain time the poll results are released or are they random?

I mean it's not bad, but real talk vorki is a pretty low tier pet. So fucking common cause vorkath is farmed to shit

Im pretty sure someone gave me something worth a bit of money back in 07 in noted items. I thought noted items were just a troll item and i dropped it.

It isnt working for android either. I've only been able to play one in the past week. Quite frustrating.

It's my opinion. You have yours and I respect it.

I never played Runescape but damn this is nostalgic for some reason

A lot of people have been playing since release and have become kinda elitist with time, don't worry about it. Hope you enjoy the game :)

Are ferocious gloves the next gear upgrade I should go for? I have bandos, fire cape, barrows gloves, torture, prims, d def, and tent whip. I usually do slayer as well.

Ah, shoulda added stats and gear:

88 HP, 85 Ranged, 83 Mage, 80 Prayer.

I had no clue there were beta worlds I could use to practice.. I have to try that.

Thanks!

No one says they don‚Äôt make mistakes. They‚Äôre just incredibly rare and the vast majority of these ‚ÄúI‚Äôm innocent I didn‚Äôt break the rules‚Äù posts are false.

I love the light - it really brings the feeling of starting in lumpy when I was younger. I can feel if

I don't like it because of all the raging when someone leaves

The arcane also makes me incredibly hot and bothered on the inside uwu. As an iron Man.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure, I was just joking about how everyone looks at their old bans and then thinks to themselves ‚ÄúI said WHAT?!‚Äù Lol. But I would definitely demand proof as well! Good luck with that!
---
I support removing bars as they should be a result of using the ores. And I support removing runes because they're unrelated (it's just because there's a "bit" of runecrafting in the boss.) This would help the onyx value issues a bit too.
---
I don't support nerfing a bosses worth in doing because you don't like it. There's many alternatives easier than this, and several better than it.
---
Except you could use it, it wasn't down on every platform and was fully accessible to 95%+ of the userbase.  Jagex would either have to give every single subbed account 1-3 days (which is unreasonable) or give none since you can't prove you didn't have access on said days because mobile was "down"
---
Eh I think it's the appropriate amount of reaction because you just know some folks are going to crawl out of the woodwork and screech at him going against his values or some dumb shit. This should theoretically help alleviate that.
---
True. I‚Äôm used to thinking like a main

Is that a thing?
---
I‚Äôm so God damn proud of you boy

What does that have to do with a blue party hat though?

It‚Äôs just a fashionable piece

Honestly, 99 crafting is more impressive and rare than getting a fire cape today.
---
Oh no please don‚Äôt get rid of the iPhone notes pictures.
---
There is literally no other boss that is as afk as zalcano that provides the same gp/hr and has zero risk of death. The table is too strong for the content, same reason zulrah was nerfed multiple times.
---
You're literally ignoring pvp, the best content in game. Grow a pair and lose some items son.
---
Can confirm, I derped lol
---
I can hear this picture
---
What is that?

You have a garage? Must be nice.
---
dr Jekyll was a man to be feared, you best have a herb for him when he showed
---
Imagine i'm talking about ironmemes, or skilling.  Zalcano isn't done for xp is more afk than WT the drop table is too strong and needs a nerf.
---
Same thing happened to me with Raw Fish Pies. He talked me for like 40 mins while I was skilling to buy them and in the end I lost 4m. He showed me a stack of 120K of them in a trade claiming he was a collector, I've helped collectors before so eventually I bought some off the ge for him. He logged out after I showed him what I bought for him. Turns out he is selling them on the GE when they are really worth 1/50 the price.

Yeah, we can still give people the benefit of the doubt and let Jagex sort it out, though.

2 episodes in: Fuck, there's nothing left to do here without leaving Zanaris. Thanks for watching!
---
Not gonna lie that's a really dumb argument. First you say it's too small of a benefit for 3m then you say low levels need it? It's super easy to make money in the game and 3m isn't all that much for the best amulet for def/offense/pray overall before you get into zenytes or occult for mage. And the teleport is useless outside the wildy cause you just use house tabs and mounted glory. Lastly - the only way chaos runes leave the game other than trident casts is to sell to tzhaar shop for tokkul and onyx - and they leave the game wayyyy faster that way than from actual magic. Glories were 100k before they added dstones to everything's drop table too don't forget.
---
Time for you to become a pker. DM me if you need help getting started.
---
My buddy and I do this with the black chin bots/venezualans all the time. After about 10-15 kills they will actually have a main log in and try to chase us off. TBH it feels like a cool boss fight.

Imagine being a company worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and you only have ONE big game platform in Runescape, yet can't be fucked to offer customer support without reddit threads and tweets.

Missing the guy in bronze plate and a chefs hat standing near AK gate asking "anyone got 5gp?"

Every OSRS streamer has fake responses it's to hype the children in the chat up.  It's disingenuous but they are "entertainers"
---
I mean the way I look at it is if this quest would have been out already when he started swampletics then he probably would have just knocked out vampire Slayer too and doing this quest would just been a goal before ToB.
---
This quest cool have been a huge part of the series but unfortunately it's coming out way after the series already started.
---
I don't think it hurts the integrity of the account if he were to leave and do vampire Slayer.
---
I haven't been playing for awhile, but was just wondering, was the lag really that bad? I know the tendency of this sub to overexaggerate things and you seem like someone who isnt biased

Yeah because I don't consider being able to login but unable to o anything as "playing the game"

For me, it sparks joy.

I just got hacked and banned the other day. I appealed it but was denied. I just want to get my account back I paid for a membership and now it has all gone to waste. I went through the customer support online but it doesn‚Äôt help my situation. Is there any fit of recourse to get my account back?

i know both rocket league and league of legends will with continued reports.

The boss doesn't need to shit out resources.  It really should go back to just basic EXP and rare drops.

Most people didnt play classic. They started with rs2. And considering this subreddit is for a remake of rs2, the target audience is not those that played classic.

League does not ban for language, it bans for harassment. Targeted, harassing behavior will get you TEMPORARILY banned. Even then it's not permanent, not even a permanent mute typically. So you could not even use a swear word and get banned for "language" but that's because it's not about the language.

I didn't see the Rendi video, but the glitch was going on well before it.  There is zero chance they got rid of all of the money it brought into the game.
---
seriously, insulting people/cats gets people to talk fast. I was trolling in the osrs cc (talking about kicking cats, ofc i love cats irl) and holy shit it is the best troll to piss people off in this game.
---
I really doubt "the money never went anywhere."  Why would you make that assumption?

Sounds like you're projecting. I miss being able to chat with friends and also coordinate with other players.

If I knew precisely why I was muted why would I even bother making this post?

Give it try man. Ironman is something that kept me playing this game. When I was playing on my main account years ago, I never thought I would make ironman account, I always hated the whole game mode, but after my main account became boring (I was about to quit aswell, took breaks tho time to time), I tried ironman for fun and now I havnt been playing on my main account for over a year. When you play on ironman it feels like things actually matter, on main account my main focus was always to make gp, stake, pk or pvm. I never liked skilling on normal account but on ironman I love it. Playing on ironman is totally different and imo more enjoyable

presumably british, since jagex and the in game clock are both based on british time

Runescape art should be it's own sub. Plz steal this idea.
---
Wut? Really?
---
Not a question and don't mean this to come off as a complaint, but I just finished my 81st barrows run on my account and no item yet.  
---
  
---
If anyone wants to make an account, get it Barrows ready, and see if they can get their first item before me, I'd be happy to follow along like a game show.
---
And regardless I can assure you I'm not withholding evidence. If I had quality evidence this post never would be been made in the first place

My Morytania locked ultimate iron man
---
At level 33 magic you can use Telekinetic Grab and grab items out of reach like the gold bar in Varrock bank basement, or Wine of Zamorak without the monks attacking you.
---
It's a spell you unlock at magic level 44.
---
It allows you to grab things from a distance some odd few square tiles away. 
---
In the wine of zamorak example, there's a chaos temple west of edgeville right at the border of the wilderness where you can see a wine of zamorak on a table. People usually telegrab the wine to sell at the GE because the priests in there hit you when you take the wine and lower your combat levels too.
---
Good stuff.
---
I imagine it would be very easy to misclick on mobile, making a first cape pretty difficult.
---
Yeah buddy big difference between someone with light banter versus someone sperging out saying they kick cats for attention. But uh, good luck with that.
---
One day last week I was cannoning Suqahs and my game just stopped responding. Couldn't drink a prayer potion, couldn't eat any food, couldn't use a teleport tablet, couldn't even log out. Had to forcibly shut down the app twice, then run and switch to RuneLite because it __still__ would've respond.
---
I literally got out of there with 1 HP.
---
I actually stopped doing barrows because of that. The average you get is not really from playing 1 hour. But rather hundreds of hours averaged together to get that 800k average. 
---
I actually heard most of the consistent money comes from doing the hard diary and getting that 2x rune boost. Most of your money comes from runes.
---
Thanks for your post. I agree with that and that's why I think having variety is important. Also, I took this into consideration since I made the items untradeable you have the option to get back the arcane so it can be resold back but at the cost of the loss of the essence and elixir. Losing the god pages in your books and essence to me is a balance where people will go for that but in the long run want to upgrade to arcane version.
---
Are you killing all 6 brothers?
---
Bruh a large portion of the community sees it as 100% waste of dev time. Personally i believe it will have negative effects on the longevity of osrs, but not like jagex has ever sacrificed something sustainable for a quick buck before... but i digress, TL is good publicity for the real game. I just hope it flops on the second or third season we dont waste more dev time on it.
---
He made his money trough woodcutting
---
Fair enough. Good luck on the grind.

Only unlock I have is Slayer helm I barely got it, block list I also need to work on getting a decent amount of QP to have a good size

I took a break from the Zulrah grind to try to get some Barrows items to do some Arma at GWD. Hasn't really gone to plan, lmao. Zulrah is a pretty interesting boss for a while. I finally got tired around 700/750 KC
---
And what happens to the cards once you draw them from your library?
---
Keep appealing. It took me over 5 tries and 4 years to get unmuted but i did and it changed the game for me. There is nothing more depressing than continuing tk play a muted acc. I didnt even know i was muted for months and just thought people on osrs were rude.
---
I was against removing them in the first place. Not like they actually do anything to prevent botting, but they do bring back tons of nostalgia. That's kind of why I started playing oldschool.
---
Looks like a tack through the top of every card.
---
I don‚Äôt get this at all
---
Massive epeen alert ^
---
Leylines!
---
Yes, and lock his xp rates.
---
 The mechanics are extremely easy to surpass and the boss is borderline AFK. There is zero mechanical skill required at all. 
---
Would you say there is a mechanical skill required for Zulrah? I don't think this is a root problem.
---
Yeah his stuff is pretty sweet. They literally talked about doing the skilling sweaters collab with that redditor but its been radio silence ever since sadly

now go get a dragon harpoon/dragon axe

If Swampletics or Settled himself don't appear in the new quest line i'm going to be *so* pissed. We'd better get a mythic woox-style NPC wearing the ToB completion set, if not an extra in the background of a cutscene.

Your right but unlike actual casinos Martingale works great in the duel arena because there are no limits to a stake there will always be someone to stake no matter what hoping he‚Äôs had more than just 1b... maybe not by now this post was a couple hours ago

Not to mention that the Gricoller's can holds so many charges that it's basically infinite, and since you no longer need to use points to refill it, it's basically exactly that a quasi-infinite watering can that you only have to refill every 1000 times you use it.
---
Are strength potions made of spinach?
---
I will thank you!
---
Depends on rarity and how it affects the number of people doing corp, but corp only has 3 good drops and trashing one for the sake of a boss that could well have 7 others is not right, and having it go the way of the Pegasian would be the lesser evil.   
---
Irons should not be taken into account on things like this, its not like its impossible for them to get Corp drops.  
---
Special affect on Arcane would be nice, but who knows what it would be in terms of what fits and would be useful.
---
I like it very much, how long did it take you?
---
They might have sped up the release of it, but it was obviously already planned before Swampletics was a thing.
---
hmm i should probably post my account bit of unique situation: it has expired perm ban from website advertising, prior to 2013 it was i believe expired or squashed mute. it doesn't effect on my account in any way, but its infuriating to me to see that its "ban" rather than mute.

They should make it so you can choose to pause membership when connection issues occur, or add additional days on to make up for the days lost.

Luckily for me though, the low points aren't very common.

yes, I used to have a 10000 day account back in 2007 because there was a glitch where you could change it. Unfortunately I put too many tags in my youtube video so it got removed. They were really tight on those things back in the day.

---
I never said you risked items, did I?
---
You risk dying. Sometimes that includes 100k fees. You need gear and levels and high attention. It requires full attention and varying levels of skill to get decent profit. If you stop clicking in Zulrah or Vorkath you die. If you try PvM with low stats/bad gear you won't get good gp/xp per hour.

These have never been on the same page, nor should they be.

Youre probably trolling so this is my last reply.
---
Jagex doesn't need to explain what's good for business to you. They can ban everyone if they want. Why are you trying to talk about how it doesn't make sense? Nice job falling into your own fallacy.
---
Yes jagex had an automated system to mute certain words. I'm not suggesting banning. I'm saying you can tell people what they said to get banned, there's no risk in doing so. Idk what makes you think I'm saying there's no automated system. I think you might have brain damage tho, because this post is also about a manual mute. Keep talking about automation tho like you're enlightened. Its literally the epitome of irrelevant.
---
yes, runescape is a rarity
---
Go make good life decisions. Jesus fucking christ your post history is depressing. It's not that hard.

Just stop being a creepy fuck

Yes if you use a racial or homophobic slur towards a person as harassment, and you do it enough, that will at least be a temp. Do it even more, I'm sure it can be a perma.

Keep your hp around 60 to avoid getting stacked out on the mage phase. Bring karambwans as combo food so you can heal 38 hp in 1 tick instead of 20(assuming your using sharks). 
---
Just stick with it once you get better, dont worry about dps just worry about staying alive on the mage phase, you do more damage on the range phase anyway.
---
Shouldn't it be agility?
---
This is actually cool to think about because the winning odds are exactly 50/50 too which casinos would never do. A kinda cool property is with 1m stakes the probabilities of avoiding losing your entire cash stack matches how much the stack is worth (to the closest power of 2, so using 1024m like the post means you are trying to avoid a 1/2^10 = 1/1024 chance to avoid a 10 loss steak). But since the probability of going on a streak over time depends on how many stakes you do over the long run, you can show that hitting an *n* loss streak over 2^*n* trials is ~39%... but since the expected return on each stake is only 0.5m, by the time you‚Äôve doubled your money by doing 2^(*n*+1) stakes you‚Äôve had a ~63% chance of hitting that loss streak and losing everything. So on average you wouldn‚Äôt be able to make arbitrarily large amounts money by using this method and reinvesting your winnings to make the loss streak required even less likely (this is because you can‚Äôt properly reinvest until you‚Äôve fully doubled what you started with), you‚Äôre more likely to lose everything at some point and have a leftover return of less than what you started with. 
---
Small aside I think you‚Äôd also need to go slightly over a 2x bet after each loss to cover the tax taken out of each stake for this method to not just bleed you dry even with perfectly average luck.

It's because they reuse the same areas instead of making them single use while you're leveling up.

That would be nice, but only problem I see is if an account gets hacked, then RIP, but you also have the problem of people trying to be the lowest level to complete something and that would ruin it, maybe they could make it where if you get 99 in something, you could reset it with a marker that it was reset?

I was gonna disagree with you, but you do have a point there. Osrs is a singleplayer game in an mmo world. You can still talk with others but you never cant really use other help or directly play with others. Just trading for the most part, at least when we were kids.

Wasnt there a league like game mode before. Either last year or the year before around this same time. Everyone was an ironman and could only play a limited number of hours total over the course of 2 months or something like that. Pretty sure they had prizes for the top 5 in every skill.

it's neat for tithe farm, and for leprechaun considering you can only effectively hold one watering can

It's the reverse, chaos rune prices are dependent on onyxes lol
---
It's a good idea but it seems abit crazy, I feel the 100k to reclaim is absolutely out of this world, as I've died plenty of times for just making the wrong turn etc, and 2m isn't a lot of gp an hour at all considering I use to make a flat 6m an hour, but fair enough some people have no other way to make gp.

TBH ‚Äî 90%+ of those players died a long time ago. The hardcore audience is strictly players who are the type of people who play the HC go progress on it as far as they can, but they don‚Äôt do any risky content, they‚Äôll never do wildy clues or content, they‚Äôll never have god wars gear for fear of dying to a DC, etc. 
---
And when they die to being careless in a quest or while doing slayer afk or something, they start a new HC, or a UIM. And that‚Äôs how they enjoy playing OSRS.
---
Getting loads. Are you trying to get them from fishing or wcing? There is a bug I think if you leave an opened clue in the bank, it removes the ability to get new nests/clue bottles (unless they fixed that)
---
Killing stuff still works as normal I believe
---
Panic sell Arcane
---
Panic buy Mage's book + tome of fire
---
If you had any clue scrolls in your bank/inven when you selected the perk, you have to finish them first before the perk can "activate" and give you stackable ones.

HOW DOES ANYBODY DIE ANYWHERE JUST EAT LMAO
---
Thematically sure, but as long as things keep shitting out Chaos runes it won't make a difference to the price.
---
HC was my first IM(and still is, haven't died yet), so when I die I'm probably going to keep playing on it. I haven't caught up to my main yet but it's fairly close.
---
Update last week said this weeks update would be on a Wednesday, that's plenty of warning :)

Thank you

‚ÄúChristmas is always a special time, doubly so this year as I've been working on my first project for Old School. It's been a great experience working on a new piece of content for the game I‚Äôve been playing for so many years, especially since it‚Äôs one of Old School‚Äôs iconic holiday events.
---
‚ÄúAs fun as it has been working on and developing the event, I'm even more excited to see you all playing through it. I can‚Äôt wait to hear your feedback! Hopefully you'll enjoy the touches of humour I have thrown in, as well as the return of some festive favourites ‚Äì and the rewards, of course! I've learned a lot from creating this event and I'm excited to get started on my next project.

Harmonizing orb or whatever makes fire surge 1 tick faster which makes it way more viable. Tome of fire gives 50% more damage to fire surge.

Or wow? That was hot back then too if not even more popular among rich kids with high performance rigs. I only played rs because I had a potato for a computer and membership was 3 times cheaper.

Group ironman mode is coming out. Time to get the crew back together.
---
First off, screw arcane.

Second off, instead of crying that it won't be bis anymore, why not advocate for a buff giving arcane magic damage?

Did they say a release date

I can confirm, it's real

Of the recent rewards (here: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Event\_rewards](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Event_rewards)), what would you consider meme rewards? I do recall that some players weren't overly keen on the Eggshell outfit, but nothing else on that list immediately screams "meme!". 
---
In 2007, the year you mentioned, there was a giant chicken outfit for Easter, and no Christmas cosmetic equipment - just an item and an emote.

Got that as a 1/137k drop yesterday. 100 kills later I got 100 noted silver ores as a 1/8k drop. Useless drops but still feels awesome to get extremely rare drops
---
I legit thought that was a seal at first
---
RS is a long ass game.  Honestly I think you're absolutely mad if you max/complete the high-end of the game without having taken some breaks inbetween.  I'm at 2150 total closing in on maxing soon but I've stopped playing OSRS for as long as a year since release.  When I got 99 RC I stopped playing for a couple months to relax from the grind.
---
Don't look at it as you need to quit forever.  Just play other games, do some real life stuff.  You'll develop the hankering to play again.

i appreciate your help.  i talked to him and went down to the bakery worker and said  there's a (spoiler) i have to face?  should i not do this quest without leveling up? or are all christmas quests just silly fun?
---
Lol like anybody actually reads that
---
Can we give him a bath now he has fleas.
---
tsk tsk, somebodys getting coal in their stocking
---
Sure, I can see that being argued. However I don't see who would want such an option. Who travels back and forth between two locations using charter ships on the regular?
---
I also highly doubt that wording would've passed a poll. Having it work similarly to Fairy Rings' last destination would make sense.
---
Oi!
---
I mean, that's our perspective.  We don't have any proof that the recent events hurt profits
---
Holiday events are all without gaining xp, just to have fun. You shouldn't be worried about dying or leveling up skills, a level 3 fresh from tutorial island can do it (I have done the event myself).   
---
It seems your next step is to talk too Santa again.

Why tf am i cryin in the club rn
---
Sounds like something they would say over at R/notanotherdndpodcast
---
Yes if you were a traditional owner of the company. If you are a shareholder or C-suite then it doesn't really matter. You just move on from company to company and maximize your bonuses while there with short term profits. It doesn't hurt them.
---
Well, let's hope this boss is actually challenging, requires a team, and doesn't cater to ironmen.
---
So many triggered downvoters lmao
---
"destination" was in the poll text so i think they just implemented this wrong based on how they worded it.  agree that it should be changed or clarified.
---
stil the new armor has negative stab/slash bonus so will be shit for scythe rapier etc
---
The requirements for that shortcut are wayyy to high.
---
What happened?
---
No you're crying
---
Probably but you‚Äôll likely be broke as fuck after. Also there‚Äôs skill/xp calculators online and on runelite that can tell you exactly how many planks of a certain type you will need, and you can just figure out your total cost from there
---
One of the new rewards is the Inquisitor's Mace, a new BIS crush weapon.
---
I had no problem with them replacing the abby tentacle, I just thought rapier seemed a little too strong, especially since it doesn't degrade at all. But just because something has been out for 5 years doesn't mean it needs replacing, that kind of logic is how power creep happens and then long running games go to shit. Also, this whole comment is completely irrelevant/ off topic to my post anyway lol
---
The Arcane is 90 mil this fine morning. When it was 140mil it was probably 100mil overpriced.
---
Satisfaction.
---
True. I have used a cannon on every slayer task (that's possible to use a cannon on) since level 60 Slayer and I'm nearing 99 now. Even the tasks that return no profit will still not come out as a loss between those that do.
---
Its 100 percent worth and it leveled my range from like 60 to 92 just off using cannon lol.
---
If your account is brand new, you'll have to wait.
---
That explains it. Much obliged
---
That is because they take time to update...
---
I'm literally flipping it rn, it's in the 80-90m range. 
---
It'll likely bounce back, but that's where it is right now.
---
Whine!
---
oh ok I get what you saying. Thanks for replying!
---
Because gamer culture is disgusting and toxic
---
Maybe I get on better with Oasis than you do with your chef :P
---
Ideally, what would you have wanted? For the arcane to stay BIS forever? (it's already been BIS mage offhand for 5 years)
---
New BIS mage shield passed a poll that offers 4% magic damage. The Arcane already dropped to 90mil from 140mil a couple weeks ago.
---
Cheers dudes you've all legitimately helped only time I've died since reading this is getting comboed out in magic phase or not doing enough damage and running out of food, average kill time at the moment is 4minutes
---
Thhbbbbbbbt!
---
Jeez, imagine being that bad at runescape.
---
Should give you the diseased debuff
---
Also we should be able to spec him on pvp worlds
---
So by your logic you should never introduce new better weapons? I think games will go to shit faster by not adding better weapons. 
---
Anyway have you even done any calculations? I think it's weird how this mega OP weapon doesn't even have a max hit over the current BIS. But I guess my comment is irrelevant if you can't counter it.
---
I am being the change I want to see. That's why I'm on 2k worlds not talking to anyone lol.
---
Wow kinda find down votes simple oddities in this game. Get fucked
---
1000% They do. I got one like 4 days ago there. Unlucky G
---
Yeah just like how every weapon that isn't rapier/scythe/tbow is dead content right? You **never** see anyone using anything else
---
What a legend! Thanks for the quick guide my guy LOL.
---
Well the original point was how arcane was devalued by tome. If you can afford tome im assuming you already own or afford an ely. Arcane is okay but people who can't afford tome will be bringing arcane anyways.
---
Lol no one risks anything at wildy content. Not pkers, not pvmers.
---
Look at how much the integrity of hcim is shit and it's just dc lottery. That's all this would be. It wouldn't add anything beneficial to the game at all.
---
found the 12 year old
---
I imagine most players who are buying 150-800m raids weapons are going to have 65 defense, so yeah, it makes sense they'll get Bandos. I'm not saying nobody ever has a reason to use bandos now, I'm saying that this tears a hole in the balance of melee strength gear.

You should try. You will fuck up a few times learning it, but once you get it, Vorkath becomes one of the easiest bosses in the game.

I lost like 1.2m ‚Äúlearning‚Äù the boss, and I made that back easily once I got it down.

I don‚Äôt think I am lol

lost my L4 HCIM to a half because I wasn't paying attention to HP

i died to an ogre shaman -_-

thought i was using the potion on him, nope

Sadly the companies trying to build a name dont get a look in, because gamers are fickle and ignore everything they claim to hate once advertising starts.  AAA games are the pinnacle proof of this.  The MMO market has taken after the mobile market and it's all just profit driven.
---
But that was my point really, investors and business men took over what were developers and enthusiasts.  Pretending they're going to take you into consideration and not profit is ridiculous and it's amazing people still believe that, the polling on here really shows the sheltered from the realistic sadly.

Enjoy unlimited bank teleports!

dw, account recovery isn't that easy. Jagex knows that acc creation date can be leaked (in ways such as this), so they don't give it much value. You actually need to know more about the acc to recover it. You're good.

Why not both? Just duct tape that fucker onto the shield

I also switch between runescape and Club Penguin at that time, it's full of snow in Club Penguins regardless but especially festive during Christmas.

I'm still sad my 2005 account for banned cuz all I want back is my scarves

Lol
---
In what situation would you even use the new armor. It gives negative attack bonuses to slash and stab. There might be 1 or 2 places but thats it.
---
I played runescape all day with the headphones on listening to system of a down so I didnt have to hear my parents arguing but ok.
---
But if they ignored reddit and polled it with 10% it would still pass.
---
Jagex is punishing you for taking the worst relic in the game

Ok fetus

RIP Arcane
---
Is it gonna be 200m ish? It's has str bonus yes  considered is has negative attack bonuses apart from crush?
---
I have the same memory except for the Halloween event in 2009? It was the one with the Reaper Hood. 
---
Skipped school because I knew the event was coming out and I wanted to play all day
---
thats cause people can't afford it but all high level pvmers literally have bils sitting in the bank. Your literally on drugs if you think it won't make arcane dead content.
---
If you have a problem with our methods feel free to coment down below.

Would accuracy of DWH's and speed on Tekton really make up for the fact that it would noticeably worse on Olm?
---
Yep
---
Thanks.

+5 mage accuracy was very small my man. All its value came from being "BIS". It could've had +2 mage accuracy and would've been the same price.
---
think its a runelite theme over xmas periods
---
its accurate theres even wc bots!

PKers

You gotta understand people are not keen on voting for content that makes pvp even more 1 sided and enforces the prey vs predator style we have atm.  I would argue that pvp has gotten some love lately. Reworked lms and bounty Hunter on top of larrens keys with dagon haircut robes. Maybe its not as much as pvm but pvp is a much smaller section of players. You might not like the pvp content they add, but they are trying to revive something that less and less people are interested in.

You got a TL;DR?
---
No... it wouldn't have... it would failed by a mile. But there's no way either of us could prove the outcome.
---
The rapier is not even BIS in the most places.
---
At Bossing it is being outclassed by dragonhunterlance and abby tent (at tob).
---
At gwd its fine at bandos but thats it. Sure it better for slayer but it is not anywhere near being broken. 
---
The new mace fits in the same place. Sure its great for slayer. But i am not even sure if it is being using anywhere besides things like sarachnis or tekton.
---
Proove me wrong :-)

I visited this bitch 3 times in total (I am a rather new player, cb90) and got bronze dragons the first time and now iron dragons the 3rd time

Fuck my life

Why are your schools getting closed because of snow?
---
How many hours did you ask crabs? I find melee training to be a fucking GRIND
---
It'll likely be pretty similar in rarity to Corp drops considering it's supposed to be a similar style group boss. Therefore all the drops will be very rare and with that and being BIS the price will reflect it
---
Yo saw your comment on that guys thread asking to pay to leach a raid. I‚Äôm an almost combat maxed med level account. And have finally started to amass a cash stack that could get me some bis options for raids.
---
I have maybe 5 kc in cox, I‚Äôm a quick learner and have been spending tons of time learning the room rotations and mechanics of the bosses. I‚Äôm looking for a mentor basically, maybe I could tag along on some duo raids.

Im not a pk'er so I wouldnt know, but you would rather have them pull it back and do nothing again? They made something and okay its not exactly what people want, but it is hardly neclecting pvp updating it. If you hate what jagex makes you are more than welcome to bring your own ideas forth.

Bcp is nice at demonic gorillas, but I just sell it after each task

Any BIS with high expected time played is anything but overvalued, genius.

Those who live in places without snow in the winter truly missed out, there are no words to describe how glorious that occasional snow day felt, especially on a Friday or Monday

Events are XP waste would rather sniff glue.

We lived at just the right time in history lads

Can y‚Äôall delete the destroy button?  When would that ever benefit anyone?  Seed, looting, coal, herb pouches/bags etc..
---
Only way i see it beneficial is when you hack someone then destroy all the items they puts hours and hours into.
---
I never do holiday events anyways, it's waste of time, I could be bankstanding
---
Thanks :) I'm not at that level of PvM yet anyway, so it's largely irrelevant for me.
---
I kinda agree... I sorta like how the Armor is a stronger Bandos, but only for Crush. If it was only Atk and no Str, I can see it quickly being declared "dead content" and only used for DWH specs. That said, I wouldn't have minded if it has a bit less Strength than Bandos, though for the legs you can't really do less without none. I think its other tradeoffs are fairly reasonable to the point we likely won't see Bandos be replaced. And while Atk can be useful, the DWH already exists so if you have a DWH, Rapier, and Bandos would you really have a big need to upgrade to Mace and the new armor on bosses with no weakness?
---
It should at least create more variety in gear, which isn't a terrible thing. Like for Slayer you might not need more accuracy that badly and you might prefer the defence of Bandos to make it more AFK or such. So I'd say the armor works reasonable well as is; if I were to nerf anything about it would probably be a smaller crush bonus than reducing its other stats. The Mace is the bigger issue since it is such a huge jump from the Bludgeon and it really didn't need to rival the rapier this closely without the armor. Even something like +89 Atk and +89 Str would have been a lot more balanced since then it is a fair bit less accurate without the armor. Oh well, let's just hope it is significantly rare so it doesn't hurt the rapier too much.

The Slayer Ring teleports are missing the Tarn's Lair location.

Are you trying to say that racism will be fine in the future?

Ironic that you also think your view represents the community.

Merry Christmas you filthy animal
---
I think next years event should just be adding pet options too all animals/monsters in the world
---
It's not needed to keep the book relevant. A boss drop that will probably cost 100m+ wasn't going to compete with a 6mil item.
---
Aww baby gonna cry? Maybe piss a little? Shit and cum?
---
&gt;r BiS Crush Weapon. They could have made this a fair bit weaker while still being better than the Bludgeon (Bludgeon minus Avernic is +74 Atk and 77 Str; new Mace is +95 and +89). It honestly isn't far off from a 1H Bludgeon, which is kinda crazy. So even if they made it +90 Atk and +86 Str, that would have still be a huge upgrade over the Bludgeon and m
---
You play it off like it's nothing, but rapier being bis for 2 gwd bosses, demonic gorillas, and a whole bunch of slayer tasks is actually quite a lot of content. I'm not trying to make this post to complain about the rapier being broken, I want the rapier to be left alone and not be overshadowed by this mace. Or, at least make the stupid mace less lame looking lol. The new armour set indirectly makes this mace a lot stronger too. Also the devaluing of the bludgeon/abyssal sire is an issue.
---
This is my plan for my alt. Courier, artisan, endurance, dhin, and wisdom. Afk gathering skills and afk wintertodt while slaying and/or 3 ticking on my other account

You can shake the snow globe from previous events and it makes a pile of snow you can take snowballs from any time of year

You realise the reindeer hat and snow globe both make snowballs throughout the year?

Where in the world would you need defence with an arcane? It's about proper item progression not taking some dumpster botted content and making it BIS because one jmod is to lazy to do corp on his iron.

Im the guy telling you that that's definitely not the case

Yeah for stuff like blowpipe i like to just be able to buy one. And i cant imagine doing gwd like bandos withouth flicking. Ill stick with rhe main...ironman should be like rs3 where u can ffa with other ironmans but then we dont have lsp or share loot options

do not listen to any of these people

That is how it was originally offered. But whether it was a standalone or an Mage's Book upgrade, neither help the Arcane situation any since both still devalue it.

Can't believe that you guys put in a new best in slot shield without it polling? how times have changed..

You will most likely lose more damage due to inventory Tetris when you use an offhand at xulrah than it would save you from being damaged.

Hey everybody! New to the sub, told this is the right place post here :) I've been playing OSRS on off for 3+ years now taking breaks for a month or several at a time. I often struggle to keep playing for more then a week or so bit then go back to that rut. Part of it is I tend to feel lost with all the new updats, new "slang" I miss &amp; feel lost when hearing or trying to talk to people about it.
---
I really do love RS it was a large part of my childhood with close friends, whether just goofing off in world or writing wild fantasy stories in the RP Forums (god I miss those days lol) Feel like thats probably another big part to ot as I have no more friends to play with or talk to &amp; share silly probaly meaningless achievements in game with. 
---
I was just womdering if anyone here has any tips that might help me enjoying playin longer or if anyone out there also needs a OSRS buddy lol
---
what is the change from the poll? i guess i missed it and dont know whats different now
---
What's the criteria for pets with hats here? None of mine have santa hats :(
---
First paragraph: correct, but it'd be nice to not get a big prayer bonus penalty item as a rare drop from a group boss which isnt even guanteed to give an additional maxhit.
---
Second paragraph: Seems like you misunderstood me there. Arcane not being an upgraded Mage's book is NOT reason to buff it. Was just saying that it isn't a problem if arcane's 2% damage boost doesn't give a maxhit, unlike your 2% tome proposal.  
---
If tome was not made with a mage's book, my first and main argument remains valid. The second argument would indeed not be valid anymore. Stat balancing is indeed a priority, and my first argument was exactly about that.  
---
About my second argument: currently, upgrades are ALWAYS better than the object it was made from for the content it's supposed to be used at, including zammy spear --&gt; DHL. DHL beats zammy spear on dragon-like creatures in all scenarios. But for mage's book --&gt; your tome, that's not the case: tome is supposed to be used for better magic dps, at the cost of prayer bonus. But if your gear gives the same maxhit for ice barrage for mage's book as for tome, then the tome would be objectively worse than mage's book due to the additional negative prayer bonus.
---
Third paragraph: not a good comparison. Tome in its current state would out-dps arcane in ALL situations, while inquisitor is only extra crush bonus. Bandos would remain better for scythe (on slash), rapier, blade of saeldor... Also, bandos comes from lower-level content with a higher droprate than arcane does. So it'd make a lot more sense to get a good upgrade over bandos than over arcane from the new group boss. In fact, both arcane and tome should be a decent upgrade over other magic off-hand items for this reason. Thus, instead of nerfing tome by 2%, why not adding 2% to arcane? Arcane vs tome balancing is exactly the same between our ideas with tome 2% more damage bonus than arcane, so I'm not sure why you're mentioning it.
---
If you really want tome to be nerfed, lowest I'd be ok with is +3% damage boost. Arcane should be buffed regardless, but 2% damage boost would be too much compared to tome. Rather than adding 1% damage boost, maybe buff the accuracy to +28? Then it'd have 28 more magic accuracy compared to blessed spirit shield, just like spectral has 28 more magic defence compared to blessed spirit shield. The dps boost would be minimal because you'd have near-100% accuracy on npc's you use magic on anyway. Tome would probably always be best DPS. But arcane would be the preferred option in the few scenarios where catching a freeze is more important than dps increase.
---
Thank you, It‚Äôs pretty cute! I got it halfway through level 93 :)
---
I'm an ironman
---
So the dragon hunter lance with bandos is significantly better than the mace at Olm.
---
Dps calcs for Olm's hand on regular CoX is:
---
0 dwh specs - Lance is 9.1 dps and mace with armor is 8.4 dps
---
1 dwh specs - Lance is 9.89 dps and mace with armor is 9.1 dps
---
2 dwh specs - Lance is 10.4 dps and mace with armor is 9.6 dps
---
People making the weird choices like this work is one of the coolest parts about the league imo, keep doing you brother
---
It would be boring if we were all Endurance-Selection-Warrior-Blessing-Focus

Why is this argument even happening? Lmao.
---
This is not necessarily a suggestion but more of a question I'd be curious to get the couch's input on.
---
What would you think of total level giving more votes in a poll? I.E. Min reqs giving one vote, 1k total giving 2, all the way up to 5 votes or something at max.
---
Magic secateurs dont do shit for anything except herbs
---
I have a problem with your savage methods. You're ruining the game for other people.
---
Yea same for me every time I get a few hours spare to try play the game I can‚Äôt because it says too any login attempts 
---
I tried making a post about it yesterday and everyone just said just wait etc. 
---
don‚Äôt think any of the j mods care tbh
---
Michael Scott: \[Softly\] Don't.
---
No one is gonna use the mace at olm. The bandos tassets will sure be dead content.
---
I‚Äôll never burn out my brother

Yes, but most games have a "death timer" anyway

Im not talking about RS specifically btw, just the general idea of appealing to whales
---
Duel arena responsible gambling 
---
Everyone knows somebody who‚Äôs bank has been cleared many a time at the duel arena, at this point people can‚Äôt stop as soon as they make that 5 or 10m they‚Äôre back in the arena.
---
Have you considered implementing ‚ÄòResponsible Gambling‚Äô controls much like other gambling websites.
---
They have 2 different options which I feel would be beneficial:
---
- opt out for: (1 day/week/month/year) etc.
---
- Limit staking amount (daily/weekly/monthly)
---
This update I guarantee will help SOME people and will not affect those that don‚Äôt step foot in the arena - ofcourse there are work arounds in the wilderness but come with greater risk... just a thought.
---
Wtf. Been playing RS since like 2006 and I've never heard of the enchanted valley until now. Wild.
---
White bead will look even more special boi
---
There are people who have been farming the same boss for 12 years for the same BIS items that are still  BIS. That's why people don't want the power creep, they don't want dead older content. 
---
This is why I'm a fan of having a 'progression tree' of sorts for gear where you need to consume lower tier items to make the new BIS items.
---
I know that.  People were saying to just use water surge and I told them you need flea shampoo.
---
Yeah, I always prefer my tank at Bandos to be completely naked since sweaty nerds on /r/2007scape told me the defense stat is useless
---
He keeps asking to use a DFS and Fury but then I break out my jumper cables and he puts his defender back on like a good boy
---
Dfs is more afk
---
Update for you: Vodafone said everything is fine on their side. Just tried half an hour after calling them, mobile did load without issues on mobile data. So if you did something: big thanks!
---
One of the ways to make defense better, imo, is to have it act as passive damage.  There's no way "kill things slower so you can be safer" will work in this game as long as full protection prayers exist, and pray-flicking is accounted for in new content.
---
The DFS is a really good interpretation of defense-as-offense.  The dragonfire attack itself isn't very useful, but I can imagine several mid-range cost defensive shields that are monster or attack style specific (like if an Avernic defender was 50m as the offense option, you might have 3 varied defense options that cost 5-10m each).  Rebounding magic and ranged attacks at a small percentage, storing attacks while leaving yourself unable to attack only to unleash one big hit (DFS but regular attacks and can use more often), etc.
---
Lots of room for creativity here I think
---
Wow. What I would give to relive these days again.
---
Why not require an arcane sigil to make the new book?
---
I don‚Äôt remember an argument.
---
This is the video game industry, games die all the time without needing the assistance of short term marketing strategies.
---
If appealing to whales can give you x3 boost in revenue, then the longevity gained by not doing so has to be more than 3x, and many games wont achieve that either way.
---
Im not talking about RS specifically, Im just saying that appealing to whales definitely isnt an inherently bad business plan, in fact, Id say its probably a good idea more often than not
---
Well i did
---
Love the rainbow accessories in this game, it makes my kind feel welcome &lt;3

I think he‚Äôs saying they should slow the pace. If new bis comes out every year the old bis will continually fall in price

"You can be dramatic and make anything look bad, but truth is it's not even op lol."
---
Just because you can draw random conclusions like that doesn't mean it's a valid argument or a proper indication of its power.
---
Thanks Adam *We*
---
The new sirens tome will be much better than arcane and you attach it to a mages book.
---
Hmmmmmmm did not know that
---
Idk it's kinda nostalgic. I'm glad they brought f2p back to osrs, the bots were there before and they still are. Still same clothes, generally doing the same f2p money making methods

There would have to be over 2000 infernal capes yet to log in for it to be more common than max cape.

IDK, its probably pretty close.

Wait so can you not have Bandos equipped when you sip a strength potion lol
---
Lol this literally just happened to me.
---
At slayer dungeon hell hounds, get with msb is like ‚Äúhop?‚Äù.  Note there is only the 2 of us there, and hes only killing them one at a time (1/spawn).  Its also a single combat area.
---
Im like ‚Äútheres plenty of room‚Äù.
---
Get a hound and the guy hits it once when im running to the safe spot.  Im like ‚Äúbro, you greedy‚Äù.

Just logged out, theres no winning that sort of situation.  People like that literally get off on flexing resource spots regardless of they are needed.

Ironman BTW, wouldnt get a clue if theres a hit.  Could still get my task done i guess but without drops.

Fucking neckbeards man.
---
Our characters literally never bathe. Ever. The body odor must be something special.
---
okay and? Its a good thing that you can get close to BiS with some quest  items/cheap items like Ddef, nezzy, occult, glory. But the very BiS that puts you over the edge shouldn't be that powerful. The ancestral pieces were 2% why does this book need to be 4% down from 10% what are they thinking
---
Best mage accuracy along with great defense and a +3 prayer bonus was far and away the BIS..
---
I‚Äôd say buff the prayer bonus to give it a major distinction from the new offhand that offers a -5 prayer bonus
---
Its only cause it's rare af from corp
---
Can you make it so when you PK someone an animation starts where you pet the dude saying 'who's a good boy'
---
The game needs to develop if people are going to stay interested, new skills is a part of that. What's healthy for the game is highly subjective. Too many people are too afraid of new content imo
---
I agree. I have untrimmed RC and i feel attacked xD
---
Its rare af and bis for pvp multi or deep wildy essentially.

It blended in! Awesome!

Holy shit wtf - I don't know how twisted league works but surely this is still insanely rare?

I've been waiting for this moment since I was 8
---
Elysian makes Inferno MUCH easier, especially when combined with Justiciar. 
---
I'd argue the infernal cape is worth that, which makes the Ely worth that
---
 But like the other guy was getting at with the 3rd age pickaxe, rarity has a much larger impact on price than functionality
---
Its 112 right now

Smithing is currently a 300k+ xp/hr skill @ &lt;3gp/xp (ZaLcAnO iS bALaNcEd GuYz) - borderline cooking cape tier. Anyone tryna flex with that shit can get in the bin.

So many people waited AFTER poll passed to buy In, they were already late to the party. Now they are panicing because they realized they won‚Äôt make that quick flip that they initially thought and now everyone Is causing it to spiral because they don‚Äôt have have patience and let their emotion get to them lol. I‚Äôma stock up again and it will bounce up once more when the update actually comes into game

Huh, the answer's that simple isn't it?  If you consider why people play OSRS at all, it's not hard to figure out why they don't want to leave their comfort zones.  Even I got kind of irritated at SotE's announcement because it was interrupting my Quest Cape I was close to getting, despite liking the quest and new content after all.

Also, FF14 represent.  I still play it periodically but I'm nowhere near caught up, just at the start of Heavensward.

bonus points if swampletics switches female for the episode
---
Wait, you guys grind bosses for that stuff? I just buy bonds lmao.
---
Some items are really good and cheap/free/from quests. Like ddefender/pots being better than full bandos. Thats a good thing.
---
For magic thats the occult at 10% costing 500k, and the imbued cape being free at 2%.
---
Previously we have a almost 200m shield being +20 magic accuracy and 0%, then why should the next step be 4% magic damage which is better than two pieces from raids combined?

What year is it?!

Speed runners and 2 Kc+ people? Sure. Otherwise Ely with Justiciar is king for 1st timers. It's a good poor man's shield for 1st timers though.

Hi Husky
---
But one guy owns like the entire 3rd age pickaxe market lol
---
No problem! I made 40m osrs in like 5 minutes haha, figured I would share the love and try and help people some money!
---
Sadly wr can't but boi its nostalgic
---
We didn‚Äôt have that in Florida but we did have hurricane days
---
Yeah, one guy not liking Corp means he gets to completely decide the content and rewards added by a new update no matter what the rest of Jagex thinks
---
I know this community fucking hates the company that made the game we're all addicted to, but this has got to be one of the most idiotic takes I've seen during the couple years I've been playing
---
Wdym us players you dont even have the cape
---
they can implement new content without completely shitting on old content. Why take the giant leap of 0% magic dmg with +20 accuracy and suddenly introduce a 4%(first introduced as a 10%) dmg boost which is way better than multiple ancestral pieces coming from raids.
---
I‚Äôm a high level pvm too and I too was agains‚Äôt the mage tome when it was announced , even when nerfed to 4% dmg i was still agains‚Äôt it until they finally made it 15+acc now I‚Äôm alright
---
Lol yeah man I just hit lvl 4 and can finally wield my steel battleaxe that my brother bought me
---
&gt; Arcane still has uses for casuals like me in the inferno
---
no it doesn't
---
This answer single handedly has shown me you have no idea what you're talking about
---
Yes and I don't wear a Santa hat, what's your point?
---
But why
---
Thanks lad.
---
Inferno is something you complete once ever and sell the gear back to ge. Unless you are some freak that actually enjoys it and does it for slayer xp.
---
I low key love it lmfao
---
Insane! That‚Äôs more money than I‚Äôve ever had (embarrassingly enough) üòÖ
---
I play Iron so I do have to engage the content and have already done the D pick grind. I didn't enjoy being pked for basically nothing and just extending the grind. I am not saying that they shouldn't put Bis items for Pvm in wilderness because of iron, but rather because it makes no sense. It would only satisfy pkers that would get another way to prey on pvmers.
---
Cool, good talk bro
---
Doesn't effect the gameplay in any way so i don't see the problem
---
Specifically for mage hand olm Sang with new BiS mage (aka new off hand) is still better than surge. Both max 49 with overload, but sang is more accurate and has healing built in. 
---
However, for any other mage content where sang was used surge is now more DPS.
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs an Asus, around 4 years old I think.
---
Invest in gear for slayer would be the best idea imo
---
What‚Äôs the armour? Looks cool
---
Yes he deserves one! He feels left out :c
---
Wait a month and buy an arcane
---
Well not at all, he's one of my best friend on osrs i even met irl, i would never scam him even for a tbow, but I know he bought gold and I just don't wanna get banned for trading with him
---
That design was never for Justiciar; it was for a different set of 3 Raids armors that went unused. You can't say using unused assets is reusing assets. It is also a bit silly to complain about using unused assets when the community has literally been asking for this since ToB.
---
I went to school there from the chi burbs but while I was there normal police had a scandal where a few cops came forward saying they felt excessive pressure to get tickets.  It sucked that people associated our school with shitty cops because they loved to hand out 200 drinking tickets at once by blocking all the doors of a frat house or whatever.
---
good post
---
diarreha!
---
You need 85 combat for Dream Mentor though, so it can only ever be that low
---
Hopefully they don‚Äôt give in to people trying to make quick gp. That‚Äôs the whole reason they didn‚Äôt reveal whether or not there would be a tank mechanic at the new boss.
---
I don't get it, you need both hands free to do Tears of Guthix.
---
Jeez bro calm down. I was just adding my 2 cents. There‚Äôs been multiple places where people have said this, and it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs easily ‚Äúfact checked.‚Äù Like hey guys here‚Äôs a picture I snapped of my boss snorting coke?? What are you expecting? Lol, maybe it is a rumor maybe it‚Äôs not. Either way it doesn‚Äôt even matter, because it doesn‚Äôt effect you, or me, so why get so pissed about it? Jumping down people‚Äôs throats for no reason seems like a bigger ‚Äúproblem with Reddit‚Äù than anything else you commented about.
---
Previously I saw people calling others who were literally boomers, boomers.

It's the situation where a Pizza Hut sends out a bunch of coupons for discounts on  bulk pizza orders. When someone comes in actually asking for 20 anchovy pineapple pizzas at 75% off, everyone looks at the coupon like "What the fuck this wasn't supposed to happen," then management is called and they give the dude his 20 fucked up pizzas and they all agree to change store policy.
---
Verzik is a Pizza Hut franchisee.
---
been meaning to ask, does the new shield protect you from wyverns' breath since it protects you from the icelords breath? if not you should add that in for a laugh
---
Honestly though. People that max and kinda lose interest of what to do rly could take on champ cape grind. Can guarantee they‚Äôll be busy with it for a while

Osrs is it's own journey, make your account now and you'll find friends along the way.

The people who enjoy the game and want to make friends are on osrs already, waiting for you.

Reddit is... reddit. Here there be trolls.
---
Still OP, instantly teleport to everywhere basically
---
Join the union
---
I mean, I guess but my argument was if it HAD to be an attachment, it should at least make sense. And kodai makes more sense than the sirens charm.
---
As fas as balancing, I think it's mostly fine. You are right that magic bonus basically doesn't matter outside of pvp or raids and even in those places magic damage is still better. I think if the tome was its own stand alone item rather than an attachment to mage's book, it would be balanced just fine (though I never managed to test it in the beta).
---
Yeah if you say you‚Äôre Australian then they have to type the recovery questions upside down and that just increases your layer of security tenfold.

I'm seeing over 30k from a 2 minute kill, just from the bones and hides. Vorkath is nutty because even if you get 0 drops you still get paid.

They should have let us vote for other options for the siren's tome. I'd rather have the item attach to the arcane or be a standalone drop, anything that doesn't give attention to the shithole that is MTA.

Speaking about censorship and obscenity laws, not state of network infrastructure.
---
You‚Äôve just explained why you don‚Äôt see many of the accounts you describe. If they‚Äôre low-mid level, they either aren‚Äôt playing much on the account at all, or they‚Äôre as I described ‚Äî they‚Äôre ignoring most of the game to keep their HC alive.
---
Most HCs aren‚Äôt just playing the HC just to play it. This has nothing to do with the high level community ‚Äî most HCs literally don‚Äôt even make it to high levels.
---
This needs to stay forever.
---
Grats also I hate you

But those are RS3 quests in OSRS, just like Fairy Tale 3 would be.

I've had double teak before. I've had double dbaxe too though, which completely evens things out.

what are you even on about you silly cunt? this isnt a restaurant

Count Draynor's full name is Victor Draynor Drakan. It kinda makes sense why he would be a part of this story.

I don't know why Desert Treasure isn't a requirement as well, though.

Depends on what you would like to do, you could get a ton of Skilling xp with it, or maybe upgrade some armor, you could get a BCP with that
---
I was going to put that into my comment but I deleted it thinking that my point was made. The boss doesn't somehow get more fun if you are going for a pet, it just makes it more worthwhile once you get the pet. Mostly the point of games is fun, and for example I really like the Dusk pet and I had tons of fun learning the boss the first day. But after 1 single slayer task I was so bored of the boss that I stopped going for the pet. A year later I had a task again and did like 7 kills and gave up again - that's how boring that boss is.
---
it‚Äôs a line in the new Christmas event

Those quests aren‚Äôt in rs3

Wrong

Every seen your mom in leggings ?

Lol it‚Äôs amazing I love it
---
I understand the frustration of not having evidence. I‚Äôd be the same way, if it‚Äôs justified then show me why and I‚Äôll accept it without a fight.
---
Doubtful. The attachment will most likely be the bulk of the price due to MTA being extremely extremely easy for bots to farm out. The book going up is handing so much money to botters right now.
---
Out of the loop. Can someone explain what happened?
---
/u/jagexgambit /u/jagexsween With mage's book coming back into relevancy, it'd be awesome to get a little refresh to the mage training arena to make it more bearable! Maybe some new minigames or changes to existing to make them more fun

Nope, not a thing. Sorry.
---
If Count Draynor mattered at all, he would have been mentioned already. We're like 5 quests into Myreque questline with the vyrewatch now and nobody has even mentioned him as far as I can remember. Even the cutscenes with Draken nobody seems to care.
---
I agree, DT would have made more sense since you actually kill vampire nobility within Morytania, and vampire slayer is a req for that. If anything, the fact that DT isn't included feels like they wanted to force swampletics to leave morytania briefly. Something like DT would have been nearly impossible for him since it would take several hours of questing outside morytania, rather than a brief 15 min hop over the border.
---
I have multiple inferno kc so you can shut the fuck up. Its not recommended to bring arcane, the crystal shield(or ely if you can afford it) is way better as it has higher defence. You shouldnt need the magic accuracy even with justiciar, if you do you can bring something nooby like eternal boots.
---
Even if what you say is true(its not), arcane is now more niche than ever and the new tome completely shits on it way too hard
---
\- Maxing combat takes aprox 150 hrs of EHP 
---
\-Lets roughly estimate that at max combat doing TOB you can expect between 5-10M an hour and that Max gear costs around 2B.  thats 200-400 EHP doing the most intense PVM content in the game.
---
\-Do you really believe majority of players are maxed?   I don't know the exact # but I doubt theres over 2-3k maxed players.   
---
My point is there is plenty of use for non BiS gear and getting BiS is not easy, its actually quite challenging and can take a minimum of 500 EHP.
---
According to the wiki green d‚Äôhide bodies are cheaper gp/xp and also more xp/hour than other methods you have listed higher here
---
Lmao private should be on friends
---
Is it bad I voted yes so I could afford one
---
Yeah according to the data here making earth battlestaves is a good balance between time spent and gp spent, with a reasonable rate as well. Black d'hide is very close, but extremely expensive so it takes a rather large dip in 'efficency' when making your gp back.
---
It looks like that book in Harry Potter that is alive
---
...F you...
---
Yep that's it.
---
When untrimmed 99 cooking cape is more impressive than a Mythical cape which requires 200+ quests including a Grandmaster quest lmfao!
---
he got me good
---
Why would you try to give someone advice then?
---
Back to tutorial island baby.
---
Correct, I was just stating that the new bis would have less requirements.
---
Always been like that lol, it's a diary task
---
I would also like to know the answer to this question
---
Ignore all the haters, of course you can reset.
---
Simply go to www.runescape.com, select login and follow the steps provided below:
---
1. Create new account
---
And you‚Äôre all done. :)
---
I hope this helps.
---
/s
---
First you gotta pick the stat you wanna reset then you drop all your stuff and press alt + F4 at the same time; works like a charm.
---
My dad always said, just because you can doesn't mean you should
---
Are you sure? The Black D'hide bodies are 425kxp/hr while Green D'hide bodies are 306kxp/hr. So black d'hide bodies are faster xp/hr but cost much more (11.13 vs 4.01 gp/xp)
---
I second this motion
---
I met some kid once and he recorded us doing a bunch of stuff, nothing that interesting. But I‚Äôve long wanted to find that video out of nostalgia. I try to search it up like once a year.
---
arcane's price is going to drop and the tome is most likely going to be super expensive. if the price difference between arcane and the tome is also in the 150m range, then people will naturally use arcane as a stepping stone if they think it's worth it in the interim, and people who can't afford tome will still use arcane.
---
if tome is super cheap, like 10m, then yeah, you're right, arcane is dead content. but bis items are expensive and so tome will likely be expensive.
---
Stop being poor and just cut Onyx lmao

Its "new" because people here throw so much shit and demands towards, the only people who will actually see it (jmods) who are the same people who cant do a single thing about it (for example the whole refunds thing over servers).
---
And this post solidifies the fact that jmods are not going to go to upper management and suggest a refund when it could potentially compromise a promotion or their job, as they could be seen as "not in the interest of company growth". 
---
I feel so bad for the JMODS when they get all these attacks on customer service and refunds and shit like that, as if every time they see a post they are going to being it up at the next meeting. 
---
they cant do anything about it, and until there is a steady decline in membership payments, nothing will be done. So your better off quitting than making a post here, but lets be real, non of the people who post shit like that are actually willing to pull the trigger, because in the long run, things aren't so bad in OSRS.
---
\&gt; No? That literally not what efficient means. 
---
Thats why I said 'in a way', stop reading into a joke lol
---
\&gt; Even in your made up situation it stacking tank gear wouldnt be better than just using prayer pots/prayer gear. 
---
Usually yes, but not when soloing some GWD bosses with an alt, then you'll need both
---
\&gt; Even outside of max efficiency you would have to reach pretty far to find any situation where it is ever a smart idea to chose more defenses over more damage. 
---
Theres a bunch of stat threshholds where more offensive stats dont actually give you more damage so then the tank stats are just free. 
---
Easiest example would be Fighter Torso vs BCP, if defenses literally didnt matter at all then BCP would only be as valuable as the time it costs to get a Fighter Torso

How about some dedicated servers? 2019 and this MMO refuses to put money into decent servers.
---
first of all why in god's name would you use fire bolt as an example. Ofc 2% is not gonna give that a max hit you dingus. However with trident or sang staff, 2% in most cases with ancestral already/occult/god cape (i) will give 1-2 on your max hit. Maybe check a dps calc before you start claiming it's miniscule because your fire bolt is still going to only max a 12 LUL
---
Video games are art, and capitalism is inherently antithetical to art.
---
I bought 156 pairs of Infinity Boots believing they should rise in price along with the Mage's book. 
---
They really should, because if it is more profitable to spend Pizzaz points on the book, Infinity Boots will cease to enter the game until their price also pretty much doubles. Same for all other pieces of Infinity--granted their supply does not already match demand. 
---
Basically I got impatient and sold them all at a loss, but maybe someone will take my advice and make bank.
---
Don't make me do one for gem cutting I swear to god

It's actually good for money making.

Not really, it's closer to 4m, rounding up from high 3s.

I found it was easy enough to just join random groups to get the torso, you should be able to find a pug to do one completion. If you've never played I would watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSur4bZ4qvo) on the defender role, and read up on the queen room (10). Everything else should be straightforward.
---
tl;dr 9:52 min about how hes gonna do vampire slayer and some other stuff to unlock new content in morytania
---
In theory that works but defence is useful almost nowhere. 
---
Then if you look at someplace where it is useful, like the Inferno, the ely is arguably even better than it there, especially for first timers.
---
All gf collectors have pets

My job doesn't have anything that's just incredibly terrible. My boss isn't the worst boss ever, he's just kind of annoying and calls me on the weekend a few too many times for my liking. It isn't grueling back breaking labor 14 hours a day, it's just kinda boring and I don't like it. I hate it because all of the little things added up, but individually it's just whatever. I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't like the little bit I do know, but it took me 8 months of job hunting to get away from my last job, and I definitely can't make the money I do now doing what I actually want to do.
---
&gt; Gamers have to be the only group where they cant seem to comprehend companies are there to make money out of them, like theyre surprised they want the maximum profit possible.
---
Where? Where does this happen. Did you only just realise this and so decided to inform other people?
---
Twisted League has seen a lot of gear skyrocket.
---
Went to pet a stray dog.
---
The fact that people blindly follow the hivemind here, or pretend it doesn't exist, is baffling to me.
---
Ah, makes sense \^.\^
---
They could have released "corp level rewards" without making one of corp's rewards useless
---
Arcane is the only one of the 3 without a passive effect, think it's time it got a buff
---
Justiciar with the Ely is the way to go sir. If you're doing a first time Inferno run then you put in Justiciar and Ely when running pillars and put ancestral back on whenever you mage. Arcane's accuracy is negated in that case.
---
My 30 defence iron thanks you.
---
Prettt disappointing tbh
---
The funny thing is they thought 10% damage boost was ok at first.
---
Like 4% is huge, but 10 is ridiculous. Its almost like jagex doesn't know how to use dps calcs
---
What gear would be better? Asking for a friend....
---
It happens on every game outrage or are you new to this
---
This is the mentality of the high level community because it‚Äôs dead to *them*.   I swear they forget that the majority of players are in the mid game and can‚Äôt always afford the BIS items for every situation.
---
Yeah. It's pretty telling the top reply chain is "why are you so God damn sensitive" about disapproving about some random wanting to scrounge through a mod's undergarments drawer like some creepo freak.
---
Everywhere you need defense you don't use arcane
---
Arcane is worthless where you need defense.
---
Its basically a contradiction, its not a niche that anyone uses the shield for.
---
.. That should never be a "solution" in 2019.
---
Jagex promised UI scaling ~4 months post resizable and have just forgotten about it/don't care.

Tbow and especially blowpipe would be the typical "OP" weapons. Most of the others are a lot more niche.

Probably just leaks to the bottom of the furnace or something. Obviously it‚Äôs not realistic for the amulets to be weightless, but they should definitely be lighter than the full gold bar and ruby

I don't think it's exclusive to osrs. Power creep tends to affect any long-standing game, and I know it's been quite an issue with WoW even with much more sporadic updates.
---
I think it's just rare to see a game as old as runescape PLUS such a frequent update schedule. Both of those factors make power creep particularly relevant to runescape.

Ah, I was misremembering the dragon to be top 5% and rune 10%, still I think the question is worth asking as it shows if they thought the point spread would be higher or lower from when it started.

I disagree.  Balancing concerns lead to level requirements, and then said level requirements generate side stat bonuses.
---
I've almost maxed with this method lol. Play for like 12 hrs a day for 3 months then dont touch the game again for like 6 months.

If the account has truly been "dead" for six years, the name should have been released by now. If the account has been inactive for that long and the name isn't available, it was probably banned. And, as far as I'm aware, banned account names will always be unavailable.

It was one of "those" skills I never did as a kid, Farming, Construction, Hunter. Once I learned how to do it though it became my favorite skill. Glad to see the grindy part come to an end though, construction left my bank for dead and farming trees curb stomped me with a spiked boot.

When I was grinding for the KQ head, I used a bgs and blowpipe with vengeance and flinching (walk under every bgs attack, and every other with blowpipe). Doing that, I got anywhere from 1-3 kills every trip, with 2 kill trips easily being the most common.
---
there's nothing wrong with "trying hard" but you are doing it for a negative reason (conflict/distraction), whereas OP is just "trying" to make people laugh/smile/whatever
---
Id really like them to spread out the blowpipes dps progression tbh.
---
Raids3 for example could drop weapon w current bp stats, whereas current mb could be between current msb i + amethyst and current bp addy darts. Thatd be the best thing long term i think.
---
They couldve literally had like 3-4 + ranged weapons with increasing power idk wtf they were thinkin

No arguments there. Just waiting for the good comedy.
---
No.... Don't tell me. That's a 16kg difference from real life. How could you this happen!
---
yeah. All you can do is state disapproval and report. Given jagex mods post here i hope they keep the place cleaned up on inappropriate comments (and downplaying them).
---
Sorry I saw a white dot and pussied out.

It's a fun quest shut up
---
Honestly means nothing if I see you're a normie. I just assume players like you bought bonds unless proven otherwise.
---
Yeah you can use dual monitor setup but have one window be Netflix or whatever.
---
So is runescape. The problem with power creep goes far beyond progression. The trivialization of old bosses and content, as well as making the game less friendly for people who have taken a break (and suddenly find the armor they hundred hundreds of hours for is now mid-tier or straight up useless), are also things to consider.
---
I started using it. I'm still new to being back in time and I just went where I would go 10 years ago

Why are you so mad? I stated very clearly in the original post that this was just my opinion.  Stay mad forever my friend it won‚Äôt affect me in anyway.  RuneScapes market is easily manipulated and cannot be compared to the free market we see at the NYSE.  Google that too if you need a refresher just like you did a minute ago.
---
For fucks sake stop comparing an end game boss you'll likely have to kill hundreds of times to a fucking quest locked mob, it's not even slightly comparable. People are going to have a lot more incentive to do Nightmare than Corp and if an item sits in the bank for hundreds of hour doing sweet FA, that's not progression. 
---
Arcane won't be like the Pegasian either because it's not a 1/512 drop from a boss you can kill 35 times an hour. Again, not really comparable.
---
Me too

Can we gently caress Elvarg and assure her everything's gonna be alright before decapitating her?

---
93, and 8k bloods from 94. No pet. Gz man.
---
I'm not terribly experienced in either, so I can only echo what I've read and what friends have told me.
---
Largely, it doesn't matter in favor of DPS, since any damage you reduced from armor, you could have just killed the boss faster and not taken that damage at all.  Defense comes in the form of actually walking away from relevant attacks, or accurately and quickly switching prayer protections.  I've watched Theater of Blood runs, and it seems like players take turns taking the aggro, then retreat to heal while someone replaces them.
---
So probably no, damage reduction on gear isn't valuable for high level PVM.  At least not in its current form.  What I do see, though, is people paying pretty careful attention to their defenses for Slayer tasks - I use Karils over Void when fighting Wyrms (a magic-based enemy) because its enough to sustain with food rather than prayer, so that actually is valuable to me there, as opposed to the time saved/money lost using prayer + Void instead.
---
I guess the short answer is, defense matters more when you're outlasting something.  So bosses, usually no.  100+ slayer monsters, maybe yes.
---
Dh is only good xp from 90hp and around 80+ str otherwise obsidian with zerker neck blows it out the water. Worst case regular void with bis works but not ideal.
---
Callisto cub too pls
---
Santa bad
---
Not sure if it's a good idea, but why don't we add give and takes to potential powercreep items.
---
 tome has 4%(I think) more magic dmg, so when wielding the tome the user take 4% more dmg for all sources.
---
Either works so use whatever is easier for you.

That‚Äôs over 11 years ago... and OSRS has not been out that long. How?

No, the actual problem is people think it‚Äôs okay to make comments like that in the first place. And another problem is when people come by and manufacture consent for the person the comments are targeted at.

I also stopped at 83 for some diary. I probably wont train it until I go for fally elites that requires 90 something. Speaking of clues I'm stuck on a clue step to smith a rune med. 88 smithing I think.... Fuck that

---
&gt; That said there probably isn't a way to tell of who has 99 in a skill what their first 99 was.
---
Yeah, Jagex has said that's why they could never offer to let people keep an untrimmed version of their first 99. Without doing the drop trick, there is no information stored on the servers about the order you max your skills in.
---
that one has a while before any gear swaps so you only have to focus on your positioning/prayers for the first few phases, yeah

Twisted League Q - What is the best weapon for training before you can get a rune scimmy drop?
---
You've accepted responsibility, that's not a simple step for everyone. I'll also second the opinion that trades are a great option (especially if university is off the table). 
---
You're off to a good start, and I wish you the best of luck going forward.
---
Nah made this one myself, independant research to quell my own curiousity
---
cox shamans drop curve bones : )
---
Well at least smithing is fast if you have gp, mining is like 70k xp/h max if you are casual
---
Zulrah is a zero risk death as well. Learning it takes an hour. Doing it in void is more than suitable. Sure you can be more efficient, but the same can be said with Zalcano. You however are satisfied taking one at its entry level, but the other isn't possible in your mind.
---
Zulrah is a boss locked behind an Intermediate quest that gives equal gp/hr without needing to train anything other than 50+ agility, magic, range, prayer, defence and getting void. Zalcano has a much higher gate of entry than that, and a more expensive gear setup..
---
Oh yeh I can't even begin to imagine the bugs and technical issues. But I just like to dream ;)
---
U take Grant's D?
---
i use carti to describe mumble rap even though i don't use that boomer ass phrase. thug is my favorite artist and r/youngthug is the sub i'm most active in.
---
alot of thug's vocals are hard to understand due to his accent but he almost never mumbles (although sometimes he does, purely for a scat type of melody). thug is not a mumble rapper though. he has some of the most melodic singing in rap and says quite a lot compared to the average rapper in today's industry
---
I didn't compare the difficulty. Zulrah is harder to learn. I'm fully agreeing with that. However you can get an account to zulrah status and learn it if you haven't already, and be farming a boss that's equal gp/hr well before you've even got to the requirements of Zalcano.

its around 20-30 skips per hydra task, which is why you dont skip for it in the main game you turael cancel.

fuck wit us we pvping hoe

That's how shaking hands work. Which is usually done when an exchange or deal is met and agreed upon.

If you haven't yet check out volcanic mining. Imo its the most bearable method outside of mlm, which is just too slow for me sometimes
---
I mean this is your fault for buying the worst BIS  item for its price.
---
Price of mage book is also going to affect infinity pieces and master wand.
---
They're just keeping it realistic. It would ruin our immersion since we never do either.
---
Yes, and the colloquial use of "weapon speed" is the speed it actually fires at, which is on rapid. 
---
Regardless of this, most people did not interpret the blog the way it was implemented, so it is misleading. Misleading doesn't necessarily mean false.
---
It's a great method. [Got 99 in a little under 4 days](https://i.imgur.com/mnwjjZY.png) on my alt and I wasn't even playing that sweaty. Diamond bolts all the way to 99. It was expensive as fuck though.
---
I'd argue the game is rangescape at this point. Blowpipe and t bow being god tier weapons along with rigour.
---
slatt i see u be in r/youngthug
---
You know that if you have two items and you kill a repeated mini boss, you automatically get the third item
---
weird i have a few member skill levels even though i'm not a member?  they just keep track of it in case i buy a membership?  that's cool.  my free level total is 493, so a little bit further.

Yeah, all the greyed out skills are members skills. You start with lvl 1 in everything except hp, so those are still contributing a little bit to your total level.

Yeah they just used the same sprite and changed the angle instead of putting in the time to develop a right hand as well.

I love how they do the upgrades in this game. Hope they never change that.

Your comment about crashing worlds 161 days ago was ahead of its time.

do you mean metal as a whole? you could look at subgenres and ask about how they‚Äôre changing for a better glimpse at the landscape imo, I think lumping it all together might wash-out some of the less popular subgenres or lesser-known bands

mod vs job
---
The game was designed with only level 30 combat in mind and we are hitting the stage like in RuneScape 2 where we are getting massive 2 hit power weapons that ruined the health of the game. 
---
Like RuneScape classic didn't have rune armor for so long. It's obvious the developers never though about what would happen at level 99 because they thought no one would obtain it.
---
The thing is we've never fully addressed how broken our game is, and the limitations that comes with it. We've never successfully made it past this stage of runescape's life.
---
What is nice is we can discuss these things and get them balanced appropriately like we do with all the other rs2/3 content that comes in the game.
---
When we start pushing the boundaries again on what the balance of the combat triangle can withhold we are going to have to start asking the same questions that bring us into the end times.
---
Do we give people more health points, do we start making armor give damage reduction. Who knows what the best solution at that point, but you can't have tier 99 gear or whatever in old school RuneScape without the combat system being DRAMATICALLY different, or the tier 99 gear being barely any better then the tier 75 gear. No one's ever had a solid idea on how to balance for that kind of content without completely changing the concept of combat in the first place.
---
After a certain point... yes? The good songs have been done already, theres only so many ways a human being can create desireable
---
music and eventually all possible combinations will be made so either all of the new shit is a clone / copy cat or either just undesirable garbage.
---
So technically, given time and human creation never ends, yes.
---
It's a doggy dog world.

I kinda hate you for that one, but yet im impressed.

Inquisitor set + mace is better dps than bandos + scythe on tekton for any number of hammer specs 
---
It‚Äôs better dps than bandos + rapier on any slayer task that isn‚Äôt specifically outrageously strong to crush
---
It‚Äôs better dps off-task than bandos+rapier anywhere off task that isn‚Äôt outrageously strong to crush. 
---
It‚Äôs better dps than anywhere dwh specs are largely effective 
---
- Places where bandos is better 
---
1. For tanking gwd 
---
2. ToB because you don‚Äôt dwh verzik, bloat, or nylo/although debatable because you dwh maiden, Xarpus, and bloat has virtually no defense anyways with salve(e) accuracy buff
---
3. That‚Äôs about it. 
---
Most slayer monsters that you afk already aren‚Äôt so accurate to which the def bonuses from bandos would outweigh the increased dps from the crush accuracy in pair with the mace. The inquisitor set also has a decent prayer bonus so if you use protect from mele, the lack of defense is moot. 
---
This (imo) is genuinely not ok for its placement in terms of levels required to wear it. Especially under the assumption that due to nightmare having SO many drops and it *likely* following the trend of armor pieces being more common than weapons; it would presumably be relatively common.
---
A better balancing solution would be to lower the Str bonus and give it a set effect to make up the difference (similar to obsidian, but in this case more viable) to which it would still hold its niche equally the same for limited def accounts and *some* off-task instances. Or they could just raise the defense req since the increased crush accuracy is already insane for dwh specs and especially with the mace
---
I just thanked you then, why would I do it later aswell?

Saying Husky has 0 Corp kc on his iron is kind of disingenuous don't you think? That'd assume that Husky was the only person involved in this update and the decision to have the Siren's Charm be an attachment for the Mage's Book, would would be far from the case. 
---
Arcane Spirit Shield will still have use elsewhere in the game, just not everywhere it used to be used. Siren's Tome has *worse* defensive stats than Mage's Book, plus a -5 prayer bonus. The Arcane still has +5 accuracy over the Siren's Tome too. This is just reddit reeing over an update that "devalues" their previous achievements and possibly decreases their bank value.

It always upsets me when people get so involved in politics thinking people are actually actively pursuing their best interests.
---
Like anyone that is mainstream enough to become a president doesn't give a shit about you. If we do get something for the people it's only to benefit the buisness partners and ex ceo's of major industries.
---
For instance when we asked for free health care in America we got this fucked up corperate moshposh where the corperations are allowed to jack up the prices of their drugs because the state is taking the bill any ways.
---
We want healthier food for kids, we get corperations fighting for that spot on their plate at school. shoveling down different processed shitty foods from different grains/fats that haven't had all the nutrition sucked out of it from abusive factory farming.
---
If even someone that was Independent and didn't take part in this soap opera called politics became president it's not like he would have the backing of Congress or any other people because they're all revolving door ex ceo's and major industry heads who will just stiffle anything that the president has to do. Those Industry leaders are the ones who fund all the campaigns and write the laws, not the president.

I'm complaining about the general sentiment on this subreddit from a really large number of people that new gear should only ever fill niches and NEVER be stronger than any other commonly used items.
---
have you done the stronghold of security already for 10k?
---
the early game when you dont know anything is one of the best experiences you can have on rs, and you can only really have it once. id recommend not looking up too many guides
---
I mean it is worth mentioning that the way they set up polls it seems like the only options are ''Add this new item this exact way'' or ''Item will not be added'', without an option that says something like ''good idea, but not with the current stats'' and a lot of people are going to vote yes simply for the added content. A simple mention that if it fails it will be looked at for a rebalance and then repolled would go a long way.
---
I think Wolf even mentioned they would consider this for the future after the Basilisk Jaw backlash, so either they didn't actually consider it, or don't want to do it.
---
Then again most people probably don't care about new items being too strong or devaluing other very rare items anyway, so good chance it would still pass
---
Now we get a fucking gnome shield.

---
I'm not saying I have been hacked before but its definitely not impossible for anyone to hack u even with 2fa it's still possible but that's not the point of the post the point was to have someone insure ur items so if u ever somehow lose them and the biggest upside would be how much gold would leave the game

&gt; I'm assuming an artist working on an old MMO from 2001 for a poor salary would be passionate about it.

As opposed to working on an old MOBA from 2004, am I right? You might wanna stop making assumptions then. By the logic youre using here 100% of all JageX employees are passionate, you might wanna be more careful in your assessments unless you really want to make "passion" be diluted and redundant. 
---
Im gonna try and be careful now. I would say Ash is pretty passionate about his job. Worked for the company since 2004. Works overtime without extra pay. Responds to all tweets. Paid out $10000 out of his own pockets to a player of the game hes developing for. Now, stop throwing "passionate" around as if things dont have a meaning.

You should bring the highest level defensive gear you've got. Most of the enemies there can just be run past. A few are higher level and you should bring food in case they hit you while you're running by.
