the whole point of construction exists as a money sink.

I think all the replies are wrong tbh. I think splashing is balanced, it's shit xp but extremely afk. I just think it's ugly. Imagine being a new player and having to wonder why there's hordes of people decked out in armor casting spells on really weak enemies but failing every time.
---
I can't tell if this is the normal one or with more added

You have to have it blessed though, which requires 31 prayer.

Thank you very much

old one looks so much better, new one looks garbage. ive been hating on this for more than 13 years

I would almost guarantee I’m older than you. Age has no bearing on what humor I find amusing. Check that attitude mate and lighten up a little.
---
People will still be right next to you like a urinal meme.
---
I appreciate the feedback
---
Half the comments on this post hating on splashers are currently splashing in the lumbridge basement as they type. 
---
I’m the same way, I’ve done about 70 runs and  have only gotten 2 pieces. Guthan’s Warspear and Torag’s Hammers. 
---
Suqah my balls.
---
Why not just use airs at that point lmao
---
no i don't have a job, why would i feel insecure enough to lie about something on the internet? 
---
Sounds like dailies
---
Well, it's not far from that atm... Is it? I mean, you can just go to wilderness crab yourself  5 ecumenical keys and die 4 times inside bandos room and you have lot of supplies. This spell won't allow you to teleport inside boss rooms or instances, but outside of boss rooms.
---
do you even know how annoying raggers are if you like pking and you get bullied day in day out by people who play the game 12 hours a day just to make sure you cant pk lol...
---
Soooo... this is what you do for fun? 
---
maybe take note of the fact that me saying my language skills are bad have nothing to do with the original comment and it was just a distraction, which worked.
---
Babooony or Lilbaboony
---
U can choose which one 
---
that's twice you've replied to me, are you sure you're not wasting your precious time with irrelevant threads on the internet.. maybe you have too much time on your hands? self reflection is a wonderful thing
---
not on my old school reeeee
---
Armadyl cb definitely going to make some money, just not a mad profit.
---
Because they didnt really nerf it. It only made botters have to re-enter which was no problem.
---
now show me where i claimed my statements are correct. you're just assuming that i think i am correct beause you're unable to accept the fact that i think differently to you.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
now look up the word "irony"
---
Yeah it’s bad. I was also assigned that very first tasked, skipped it and haven’t been back to Konar since 🙄. I’m still only level 60 Slayer so maybe I’ll go back to her when I get better stats. 
---
I’m lying in bed talking to you my love whilst waiting to drift off as I have university tomorrow. Wubu2? X
---
Nice try but you didn't pixelate the login enough, my account now
---
this is actually the original, holy shit
---
I though he added extras, but no
---
\&gt;whilst waiting to drift off   
---
must be hard to stop thinking about it, right?
---
My only concern with this is that currently the Mining Guild is *heavily* botted. 
---
Adding an ore pack would mean there would be even *more* incentive for bots to flock there. 
---
It's already super annoying since bots will camp the iron ore and you can't outcompete them since they're programmed to literally never give up.
---
Protip: cream your pants
---
Smh my head.  If you're on this sub and you splash do yourself a favor and do teletabs to 55

Konar is better for money not the best for xp

it's good you felt the need to inform me that you reported the thread otherwise i would have never known, thank fuck you did that

Why would they put an actual QoL change into their PvP balance polls?
---
Wearing a charged glory at Gem Rocks makes them faster to mine. Maybe some item (even Varrock Armour or Lumbridge/Draynor Ring) could make them mine faster too?

Mahogany trees have a small chance to give 2 logs instead of one. As a result the 1/8 chance to chop them down is far too quick. Can you make them 1/11 like Redwood trees?

The latter one

Who gives a shit
---
Nope, it's seriously mad money, it's nice to just have so whenever you need some cash just go RC Blood Runes for an hour or two.
---
Just a word of caution about Konar, sometimes you'll end up having to fight in the catacombs, and tasks can take absolutely forever there at lower cb levels

isn't anti dragon a good f2p shield as it doesnt decrease magic attack? increasing its defense slightly might give another step for f2p pvpers more incentive to do some skilling to get "bis" for them. Spices it up a tad I guess?

---
The metal dragons and also the brutal dragons. If you like blue dragons beware of getting a task to kill them in catacombs, they are brutal blue dragons and are a very difficult time consuming task. Not sure if you know but slayer becomes really good at level 75 but at level 70 you unlock kurasks and those are good money, but konar doesn’t assign those sadly.

Have you ever heard of paying trustworthy clanmates/friends? If money isn't a problem this is near zero effort and will get you 99 magic in less than a day. Of course this requires you to have clanmates/friends.
---
The average amount of cash it adds per kill is very low, most tasks are less than 500 GP/kill.
---
Actually would vote YES

---
Done? This is the weirdest collection of stats I've ever seen for a "completed" account. I presume it either meets all the quests you need to do and/or the diary's, but do you just not intend on maxing the account ever? I know you can't get 2277 total, but maxing a pure still has benefits. 90 Agility means your revenant cave kills are easier. If you bang out 91 crafting might as well get 99 for the cape. 99 then means you can do 77 runecrafting, after 77 just afk when you can and like 2-3 years you'll be 99.
---
Just a weird set of stats you have here to say you'll never skill again.

Regardless of this, the team continues to neglect skilling for resources/cash with the excuse of botting making resources too easy to obtain, so they put them behind PvM content. Killing a mole should not be the primary method that bird nests enter the game when a Hunter skill with bird houses exists.

Ouch. I got 2 b rings first 20 kc

“This helps Pkers too much in the long run. Voting no.” - some salty pvmer 
---
I agree it was obvious what they meant, some people just like to be awkward.
---
Don’t go for dragon armour. Unfortunately it’s nothing more than fashionscape - get full obby. 
---
Also, the best way to make money passively is through skillling is herb runs farming. After this just train slayer as hard as you can. If you do it right it’s about 500m+ profit to 99. 
---
As far as that 17m, get obby as I said above, and gear for slayer. So a black mask (eventually turn that into skater helm), fury, bring, d boots, whip (once you can use it), obby cape (until fire cape). And definitely go for a dragon defender, b gloves and a fighter torso. 
---
This is the best advice I can give to really start making money. Other than this, skilling isn’t the best for money and is mostly very afk slow xp. If you’re really set on a skill, mining at MLM is pretty decent. 
---
Less natures = less alches = less gold.

i got into an autism war with a splasher. i would kill his rat, he would select another rat, i would kill that rat, repeat. then i started killing the rats before he could reach them, but it did not stop his resolve. then i brought my cannon, and he still stood strong. then my hellcat grew into an overgrown cat and i had to leave with my tail tucked between my legs like a little bitch. i sold my cat for death runes after that, nobody embarrasses me in front of my girl like that

Vampire slayer gives lots of attack xp I’m pretty sure..I’d check rewards before doing it just in case but I’m almost positive that’s a good one to do. Im sure a quick google search for best pure quests would give you more results than posting to a forum. 
---
Yea nmz is the best. I recommend getting all three combat stats to 70, then getting full obby with a obby sword and zerk necklace and going to nmz. Then once your health is in the 90's, you can use the dharok method

Now, THAT would be an actual bot lol

You utilise the block list (follow my spreadsheet I made when I went for the 99 grind) to remove high weight tasks, so that the tasks you skip are lower weighted (rarer to get the task compared to devils and nechs), and the tasks you do are enough to give you points to continue skipping.
---
It's slayer point positive even with bad RNG, you just need maybe 300 slayer points to start it off (assuming you've blocked all the correct tasks already) in the event that you start with bad RNG.
---
It being a take x option...? I don't see how

The majority of the posts you link are well within the rules and only a few are borderline. We could be a bit more strict on some posts, but that is not something that will change overnight since this has been the norm for quite some time and most are fine with it. It seems you only want to see posts directly relating to the game, but that doesn't mean any other posts relating to the game less directly shouldn't be allowed. For example, that animation of the setup is OSRS related even if you don't care about it.
---
And if you do just want to see Suggestions or Discussions, we do have flairs and some filtering. Hopefully in the future, we will be able to further improve upon that and require flairs to prevent unflaired posts. But for now, I'll look into getting the rules tweaked to at least be clearer where we draw the line.
---
Why the fuck would you toggle that? Do you know how much extra data they'd have to store??

Plan to get fighter torso?

You should do some research yourself and possibly read update notes. http://services.runescape.com/m=news/bird-nest-balancing-and-pvp-changes?oldschool=1
---
Your comparison is totally ridiculous. "Minimal requirements" are 89 hunter and 90 crafting for the rates you're talking about, meanwhile people who do **giant mole** use cannon and tbow?? The news post says level 5 hunter gets you 2 nests per run on average, scaling up to 10 at 99. 
---
I guarantee you not a single person in the world who has a tbow is killing giant mole for cash lmfao. As if praying melee and running to an arrow is hard. 
---
The whole point is that they specifically state that they want to focus on skilling resources coming from skilling, but nerf the skilling method.
---

Its almost as if gating content behind pvp is bad for the game... Also dont add "ironman" to this, you just didnthat because you personally dont like ironmen, more regular players abuse bh and pvp then ironmen, especially considering IRONMAN PLAYERS CANT LOOT THEIR KILLS.  All they get is an emblem, so grow up and report the real abusers, the bots, gold farmers, and troll pkers.

Idk what he did at all my point was just that it happens

If you are dying to sire with that kc you are pretty shit, sorry to inform you. I don’t know what method you regularly use but using rejuv pool in between kills makes for literally 0 supply kills with the odd stamina dose and shark eat every now and then.

If they look like they have nothing in the wildy I'm more suspicious they are holding bank.
---
except it doesnt, most skills yield 0 profit or even use money if u use efficient methods, rc and agility are the only skills that will give profit if u do it efficiently, others will use money or wont give any resources. In general if u know what you are doing you will be either killing vorkath or doing raids for money

With 77 prayer for Augury, 98-99 HP levels you from 106-107 cmb. With 75 prayer you could stay 106, but no Augury. 83 happens to be the next highest possible level before gaining another combat

I don’t believe iPhones have a background data option in settings.

Oh wow, a great QoL addition that doesn’t really benefit me in anyway what so ever but would definitely help new players and would aesthetically make the guides a lot better. You already know Jagex are gonna come up with “3ng1n3 w0rk”
---
Personally I voted no on chaps because they should have defense requirements to begin with. Why is a t70 piece of equipment that provides roughly the same defense bonuses as adamant plate legs be able to be worn on someone with 1 defense?
---
And then when something as simple as resizeable icons is turned down MULTIPLE times for the sake a maintaining some perverted "skill" in pvping. I personally think PvP is a vital part of the game but the PvP community is incredibly toxic. I can sit in a PvP world or rev caves for 10 minutes and hear a "sit retard" or something equally as stupid.

I’ve heard hackers send a fake email that looks like it was sent from Jagex saying to enter your info and stuff so hopefully u didn’t do that if u did, GGs
---
Muh feels
---
maybe if runecrafting had something like the graceful outfit people wouldn't hate it as much. Maybe buff magic at the same time since its expensive and not great compared to range.
---
They could only carry maybe 4 planks though
---
Real question is why are you friends with him? And is he retarded? Vpns don't cost even close to that much unless your buying for months to a year at a time

Jesus, just realized guthix claws spell icon is three claws.

Grats on no ban? That's either a bot or extreme autism.
---
Putting aside the ignorance of  voting against the entangle buff(people not gathering a team every single time out of necessity to pk because they aren't useless on standards), the god chaps for 1 def not only failing, but failing by such a huge amount feels like a  marker for the start of no pvp/pvp related account updates ever passing again. You had a harmless fashionscape update that would have made pures really happy while having no effect on anyone else. It didn't make them more powerful, there was no "choose to limit yourselves" justification it didn't make pures more powerful. It was the most "this doesn't effect me but I know it would make a minority yet substantial portion of the community happy" poll as a poll could get. Yet people wanted to lord authority over pkers so bad it got 25 motherfucking percent. Until a minimum wilderness kc is required to vote in related polls pvp is fucked.

Thanks for not knowing, Serene’s Mom!

Not sure how you're banking, but I was able to bank really fast by teleporting to clan wars (ornate pool works too), bank, reset stats, and xeric's amulet to the inferno.

They’re all bots though

Range and Mage is fine for zulrah, kills might take a while though. Never bad to get both of those up. If you want to cannon something for xp, I would cannon + blowpipe dust devils if I were you. With mith darts+balls+scales you break even and I was getting like 90k xp/hr at 90 range. I think Ice trolls are good too for breaking even.
---
Might be due to the fact that the dependencies are usually shipped with the java program. It's not js or python.

I’m not, blue is our other teammate who got killed too since we were doing a 4man. Red said he was going to buy it for a year. I was shocked at how pathetic this was so I screenshotted the chat

All my alt does is cut yews and then immediately sell them on the ge. How does my THOUSANDS transferring gold could lmao right?
---
Thanks!!!!!
---
Thank you!!!!
---
QOL became an update category because they dont fit traditional stuff like buffs or nerfs. Things like tweaking interfaces and moving commonly misclicked objects, not "being able to do X content almost the exact way it is done now but faster" 
---
What are you killing hydra with, a mith c bow? Those times are realll slow
---
getting 85/85 range/mage for zulrah would be preferable, but you won't have issue getting kills with your levels. Also if you can help it, use dhide and ahrims instead of void (switches are harder but the kills are faster)
---
Chinning is faster and more efficient gp/exp wise for range training, or you can cannon slayer tasks as you train that. 
---
Nothing

you can use titanium backup (or whatever, i'm sure there are lots of things to do this) to extract the apk you have on your phone and then just copy it over with a cable or the cloud or w/e you like

I checked the email after I got hacked, so it’s not that, thanks anyway

You bought over $10,000 in GP? 
---
Trawler is fairly random, you can get it easily or just have a horrid time and never get any pieces. Aerial fishing is more of a guaranteed way to get it that ALWAYS takes a long time. So the choice is to either have RNG dictate when you get it or have a guaranteed long grind.

Im 68 farming on my regular ironman. Been farming trees that I got from wintertodt. My melee stats and mage stats are around 60, range 52. Started slayer with chaeldar recently. Should I start my herb runs? And which ones should I focus on? 
---
Also, any advice for a newbie slayer?
---
Managing your kingdom of Miscellania, killing the Giant Mole and trading his skin and claws for bird’s nests, and slayer are my suggestions.

RIP in peace to that guy

this account is gonna get ruined when you have to do demon slayer + shadow of the storm

But it seems to be gone on their Facebook page right?

Both drops are 1/500 and you have two rolls per kill on the table, this is a 1 in ? chance

I don't know the formula to calculate this so if you could tell me it that'd be appreciated.

damn you must be really bored in the game considering you even figured this out

&gt;No it doesn't? QoL changes are changes that need to be made to extend the life of the game....... (Literally stands for QUALITY OF LIFE)
---
Are you retarded? 'Quality of life change' means 'making the players' quality of life in the game better' i.e. it makes the game easier.
---
It has nothing to do with the fucking game's life you mongoloid.
---
kwuarms and irits should be your priority. You need those to speed up slayer. Ranars would be helpful as well unless you want to flick everything
---
Ahahahaha you seriously think youre the first person to get a raids drop on mobile? Pipe down noobie

Not gonna lie this picture tripped me out.. Looks like you are walking down a long narrow path until I realized you were standing at the corner of your house
---
I just keep going up and down the ladder until I can run past supreme without getting aggro 
---
I don't run out of energy during agility or farming anyway (herbs + trees), without the outfit. I'm not sure if ardy course is different but I wouldn't think it is. 
---
I got quest cape a long time before I could be bothered grinding out graceful so I didn't consider them.
---
Turn on rooftops in the settings.. problem solved
---
but slayer is nothing like hunter and mining?
---
 2 jars and no pet :(. Gz man!!
---
I call dibs on posting this next Tuesday
---
You can do revs for some starter money. If you get your Magic up you could do Zulrah from 80 Magic, it's far more consistent than GWD for money.
---
hell yeah I've been doing one level a day and I just hit 70 a bit ago, will have those noted dks bones in no time
---
Yeah, i talk about buying. There is a lot of monsters, the ones ive mentioned were just examples, were you profit gp with buying the runes, which is very fast. 
---
Wouldn't require much dev time, the minigame already exists. I doubt anyone is purchasing membership so that they can attempt Champion's Challenge. As an F2P minigame this would give non-permanent members a reason to keep engaging with the game during membership lapses.
---
Don’t click on any quitting streams or 10b giveaway streams on Twitch if you want to watch content creators. These are phishing scams and can steal your account if you click the links and enter details on the stream.
---
It's a normal account, do the best money making an hour and just buy the tassets
---
Something equivalent, or straight up death runes, heck make it a tadk so more people do so.
---
You should have tinted the skulls so they look like different slayers. 4/5.

Hi. Meet Swampletics.
---
I can't understand some people's reasoning sometimes
---
The voice... the joy and emotion that is displayed through his voice alone makes his content so fun to watch! Srsly how the hell are we even entertained by a man jumping a bridge a million times to get an agility level lol
---
I mean lower as in 1/125k, or rather a higher drop rate. 
---
First got members myself in 7th grade. Right as school started 2007. First thing I bought was allll the dragon weapons, I thought they were so cool. I couldn’t wait to try them all out. You can probably picture my embarrassed, and defeated look as I soon realized nearly every one of them required a quest to use. I was way over my head on my 10+ purchases. Ashamed, I tried to sell them back as quickly as I could to try to recoup my failure. Ah good times indeed
---
And the level is 8 levels below the actual level, since the bot has been woodcutting for 50 hours straight
---
I'm stealing this.
---
Can I have a bond please
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
It does tho feel free to pm me in game

---
You can do it before 60 if you train at canafis.
---
Or just make it really expensive to make in the first place. That fits the theme of PoH teleports cost a lot to build, free to use
---
Ow 
---
For me it was White Knight armour, I was mesmerized by that shit in F2P seeing the NPCs in Falador and the very first few things I did when I got members was do all the White Knight quests which took 11 year old me a fucking while.
---
What's the best way to go about training slayer at a low level? 
---
I got a crocodile task as my 5th and I'd honestly rather never touch slayer again then spend another 4 hours killing them at the rate I was going. They're in an inconvenient location, they have a relative ton of health, and they're both bad exp and drops. I've spent more time killing crocs than I did on my first 4 tasks combined, and I'm not even halfway done
---
It's not exactly what you're asking for, but [the osbuddy exchange ](http://rsbuddy.com/exchange/summary.json ) is a nice data set
---
It's great for Chinning range on mm2 monkeys paired with bonecrusher...but that's about it.
---
The game is gigantic, if you want the most rewarding experience, I would recommend playing an Ironman. I think your enjoyment for the game will die down very quickly when you realize your woodcutting is useless because you just worry about what boss gives you the best money per hour and buy your logs.   
---
Ironman makes you responsible for everything including learning the game better. Touching pieces of content that are ignored by normal accounts.

when i'm on my Iphone SE i can't even read the chat unless i really try.
---
Damn that wall of text bro.
---
Ok first of all, for your stats, I don't recommend Zulrah. You want at least 85 mage IMO, I guess 80 is okay for trying out a few kills but I wouldn't go below that. 
---
Once you level up your stats though. My tip is, use Zulrah Guide, I'm not really into the whole learn one rotation thing. It's just a waste of time since the melee phase is very common and you'll keep running back and forth or wasting huge amounts of cash on teleports hoping for that range phase. If you can afford/don't mind it, it's a good idea though.
---
For gear, use ahrims with torm bracelet if you can afford, god d hide is fine. Ring of suffering highly recommend over archers/seers ring. You can make it easy on yourself by bringing void mage + range to lessen the switches though it is less tanky and damage is not as good so would switch to Ahrim's once you're more comfy. 
---
yes, i enjoy reading the chat, but american servers are constantly arguing about trump and the wall; or global warming. I prefer normal weird discussions without politics.

---
Because addy gloves
---
Yeah I meant he got cleaned. 
---
If only ppl realised this 
---
It really is a big difference. They're usually 14.5k, a 3.2k difference. 
---
Yeah just ignore those illogical aspects of this place
---
bro it's literally like a couple hundred gp if that. Removing them is just as good as any other toggle.
---
It's actually really convenient. It's right next to the bank. It takes like 2 seconds. Just because you want to use the new "inconvenient" buzzword everyone is using to get their "QoL" change doesn't make it actually inconvenient.
---
That still doesn't remove gold from the game. It may slow the entrance of gold into the game but it never removes a single gp.
---
Did you keep a tome?
---
Doesn't feel like people are buying xp lamps anymore. My rankings don't even dip even If I only drop in to play 30 mins a day on rs3. I'm ranked top 16k in rs3 for just playing a year and a half. I'm not even trying hard enough nor would I buy those scam of a lamps. I could put in some time on easy skills I don't train like Cooking,Firemaking, or fishing and I could maybe go past top 10k in total xp ranking. 
---
QQ
---
I’m pretty sure they usually sit around 11k no? I tend to but my supplies in huge bulk so perhaps I’m remembering wrong, but isthere any chance they just spiked to 14k prior to Kebos? I could be completely wrong but I don’t remember them being that costly.

- Use a warm color for your display, specially at night (windows 10 has a built-in function for it)
---
- Always have a source of light, like the sun light coming through your window or your room's light bulb at night.
---
- Avoid cold temperatures while using your pc or phone.
---
- Don't use "computer glasses" unless recommended by your oculist, they tend to do more harm than good.
---
- Try to look away and focus a far away object every now and then.

This among other things will help to heal your eyes, or at the very least, they will decrease the amount of harm you're doing to them.

Runelite and other clients have ruined the community. People take the time to type out look up on Runelite when itd of been easier just to type your level. Its also a very good start of life long friendships. 
---
Yes, it's all my opinion, but I think it begs the question, what is it about carrying a spade and seed dibbler that gets people so worked up. If everyone cared so much about the "inventory management challenge" they would play an UIM, but the vast majority of players do not. What are you thoughts on mini game teleports? Tool leprechauns noting shit? Zeah AFK runecrafting? *In my opinion* all of these types of changes have improved the player experience in OSRS as a whole, and so would a toolbelt.

Sorry it just makes me report them because I want the bots to stop but i know it's a hard thing to do If i was a bot banner I would ban bots all the time I specifically do farm runs and wait at the willows to report the bot and watch them get banned sometimes (very rarely does it happen but i have seen it i think where they just disappear after you report them) so I know it's a herculian task but I am up for the challenge of reporting all bots.

---
Maybe instead of a money vs xp tradeoff, or afk vs active tradeoff, it could be a normal training vs training multiple skills at once.
---
I'm imagining training methods where you, for example, train farming herblore and magic all within a single method, or mining smithing and firemaking. that way if you want to get 60 smithing as fast as possible for a quest, or 94 magic, you wouldn't use these methods, but if you just want to get good hourly xp distributed amongst a few skills, you would have an incentive to use these combo training methods.
---
This would need to have some kind of progression of materials so that you can't just train one thing and ignore the other skills, and the goal should be the production of some kind of end product that the player can sell or use.
---
These *should not* be minigames. One of the things I hated in RS3 was runespan, because everything you did in the minigame was completely detached from the rest of the game. You brought in no supplies, and exited with none of the products of your work. These methods would require you to bring your own gear, runes, potions, and your rewards would be whatever you made or gathered while skilling.

in that case, great!

If you’re playing on mobile you can filter the spell book to only show spells you have the runes to cast, or the level required to cast. It should increase their size substantially.

Lmfao pictures like this give me nightmare flashbacks i remember doing this on my main with dharok's literally left the computer on for whole night and autoclicker aswell after a while the nmz session ends and my dude is pray flicking like nothing suspicious is happening.

This happened to me about 2 years ago so after that i made a new one and its even better than my previous.

Is there a clan for bjj in osrs?

I’m more confident I’ll get my black belt than a combat 99.
---
Pre vent when you go in, keep magic pray on if possible to try and not waste it on a minion if you get screwed over on a rotation.  Pop veng as you see a range attack about to hit you during mage phases. That’s all there is to it. Considering you can get an extra 30 damage reflected, Venice can really help lol.

those are 100% bots I have watched and right click followed names like this and there is no goddamn way in the world they are real players I can assure you. it's not a very good troll if people do play the game like that so we have to rule that out so there is nothing left but that they are bot accounts. and on top of that they are always grouped up togeather, making it more obvious. and more often than not they are in free to play 
---
I dont, but then I usually stick to low pop worlds where theres like one spambot max which you mute and then its chill.

Then its a no from me. I like the way it looks atm

Was gonna say wouldn’t you do HP first but you have it nailed. Nice stuff.

Training multiple skills will only be used if it's more efficient than training them individually

Unfortunately not. You can however use the same filter system to isolate them, making them easier to find if you get lost in the swarm of spells.

I can't stand revs. It's like 5% actually killing them and 95% dealing with pkers trying to kill me for my several monkfish. I don't bother with it since its so annoying. At my CB especially since I get attacked by everyone. 
---
If you believe what OP says you are retarded
---
You mean the prepost?
---
I understand you, and I completely agree with your sentiment. Your "accusation" or statement is totally fair, since you don't know me as a person. I like to think I'm fair and that I'm accepting of people's point of view, even if it differs heavily from mine.
---
When someone has a different opinion from mine, I like to hear the reasoning behind their line of thought. But that was what I tried to convey in my original statement. I've read many replies where people angrishly explain their opinion with very weird explanations. 
---
I think this community is one of the only ones I can't understand sometimes (Atleast some of them) 
---
Dumb horny people.
---
Right? If you wana roll the dice flipping, you can't have your hand held to make sure you don't cock up.
---
People like you are the reason so many people are deluded beyond belief
---
Not that I’m aware of, you wouldn’t believe but I actually came across a guy in a raid who had trained with two of my coaches and had stopped in at my gym once.
---
Was crazy lol
---
You could always start one? It would be nice to have because I’ve found osrs to be plagued with players that have developed a superiority complex based on their levels and acquired wealth within gielinor(myself included at times). It would be nice to bring over the culture formed in bjj gyms and also go over technique while raiding and shit.
---
But for sure I’m getting a black belt and I’m not sure if osrs is going to be around long enough for my sporadic bursts at playing to ever max.

Tbh after finally getting Quest Cape, can only really say the worst quests I had done was Mournings End pt2 purely for the shades, and those quests that require to wait X amount of time.

No because poison only hurts if you eat it

Ive only had 2 dd tasks since 65. I never get it assigned. It's so frustrating. I don't mind spending money to make money. I will be looking to do some zulrah for sure. I may do a little barrows but I've not done those diaries so idk if it's worth doing without them done for the extra runes. 
---
Nope. I average triple s most games with at least 10 kills. Other day I had to wipe a full team of hackers out. 10 times sks bullets to the face
---
Why? The same argument can be made for the people who want the change.  I just don't want it and think the current visual aspects look better, how is that sad at all? Typical hypocrit lmfao

Took me 4min+ for my first kill. Gj
---
How come downvote + agree? Just curious lol idm the downvote
---
Awh the baby is upset its ok you don't suck
---
Zulrah is very hard at first. You have to learn the patterns and then it becomes easy. Take your lumps, you will probably die very often at first. Dont worry. Most of us did.

Not to mention how big the table is compared to a NPC lmao, it's such an incompatible difference.

You got a lot of negativity, you fucking spastic. Are you shit too? I was making a statement and even pubg know there's hackers about
---
I love that I hate you.  
---
People in the lumbridge cellar splash on spiders. The cats can't do anything about those. 
---
Gz! Would recommend range pots to speed up kills. Also as you become more confident with Zulrah it’s easier to survive off cheaper food. All the best with your future Zulrah-slaying!
---
Awww mummy jokes. You're so fucking original dude
---
I didn't delete any messages, plus I could give 2 shits for downvotes, reddit karma does literally nothing, I don't even know how you people know if you got karma.  Must be sad eagerly awaiting to check a post and seeing how much karma you got from your comments. 
---
Downvote away.  Downvote this one too while ur at it, could give 2 shits
---
Brazilian Jiu jitsu techniques use leverage and shouldn’t require strength.  It is very common to see a technical player defeat a much larger and stronger opponent.
---
There are countless of examples of this on the internet and you can witness it if you go into any open mat session in any gym.
---
I like the face censorship 
---
Yeah I’m with you on this one, need to make other skills more viable compared to slayer, I’d be happy nerfing slayer drops but I know I’m in the minority

Okay, Thanks. I’ll just go Alch Myself.

Hasn’t slayer like quadrupled in xp rates since vanilla osrs? 
---
It was definitely a good addition.
---
If you dont PK often and enjoy slayer why are you a pure? Doesnt make sense, just level defence a ton
---
Not even a bad idea if you place it in the resource area
---
Understandable.  
---
Jagex could at least remove the auto trim feature.
---
Not everyone is playing ironman.. 
---
The item would be tied to the Slayer level requirement. In other words you would have to have a Slayer level to get the item drops both on and off task. That way they aren't just farmed nonstop for coins. It would still provide incentive to get a higher slayer level.

I close the chat box completely. It covers so much on my iPhone XS.

Guy at blast furnace was having a conversation with himself about fucking zulrah and making her squirt, watching the people rip into him made last night a bit more interesting.

---
&gt;it could be a tradeoff between normal training vs training multiple skills at once.
---
Well we already had an instance of training multiple skills at once which was also the most efficient method of training both skills (underwater agility/thieving) and it was still pretty dead. And the new attempt (aerial fishing) doesn't seem all that loved either, although I don't mind it personally. I'm pretty sure the underwater fishing/hunter is also extremely good and dead.
---
Maybe it's just that not all that many people are super into skilling in general so they don't care enough to try anything new unless it's super overpowered. Things like blast mine are way too good both xp &amp; gp wise to be as unused as they were when I was doing it. It's content that's basically perfect for casual to semi-serious players which is like 99% of the player base.
---
Omg who did this?🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥😂👌🏼
---
He's probably sending it via the autochat system and you have it configured to filter it out.
---
Real reason is youtubers Jagex like started account sharing like crazy to make pk videos so Jagex made the rules different

---
I understand stand that you don't have to use them but it's just adding more and more to the daily scape. Alot of people log on and feel like they have to do these before they can actually play the game and it makes it feel stale real quick.
---
After that many kills you probably don’t give a crap about efficiency any more and just wanna spice things up a bit. 
---
Having fun idk
---
I remember dying to the brutal green dragons in Otto's dungeon during my first Runescape membership. I lost full rune, my cat, and a whole lot of other stuff, too.
---
Konar isn't that varied, if anything it's a more restrictive Slayer Master with a chance of opening a lootbox with each kill.
---
Like, literally you are getting monsters you already get from other Slayer Masters but you can only kill them in a certain location.
---
Fair enough 
---
Well. I can only usually play around 3hours a day. Sometimes double. Sometimes less.
---
But I reckon I'm around 100-140hours away from 85 Woodcutting at maples. Then I wanna swap to yews.
---
Hoping to have that black axe by then.
---
So the time line of the entire account? 1-2+ years no doubt.. More?

20

I use crossbow/shortbow.

Wyrms should be like 90 hp and be put in multi-zone so they can be a quick cannon task.
---
Yeah but DCL/broadband was out well before 2007 dude lol. Same with lcds and flat screens. I had dcl by 2002 and I lived in europe at the time not the US. Just saying it's weird seeing the now 18-20 year olds talk about 2007 like its the start of dial up and shit and use of CRTs. That was the 90s. Not 2007 lmao. 
---
haha me 2 i can never remember which is which
---
The cost of tree seeds is very high in relation to how much xp they give you. It's more cost effective to do fruit trees and hardwoods. 
---
Yeah, not blinking is pretty bad for your eyes. Gamers sometimes don’t realize how little they blink until they’re done gaming and their eyes feel like needles are being born from your lids. 
---
I really like it.
---
That one doesn't fit to well though in my opinion. The harpoon makes sense. Wintertodd is a kind of minigame roll based loot drops. Trawler again a minigame with roll based loot. Mlm is more just casual mining
---
Back in the Xbox 360 days call of duty 4 was my 2nd game. I had over 300 days played.
---
It has some unique properties to it though. Its the only patch that can grow the Bloodweed herb (the seed can be bought for 50k in the rouges general store, dropped by Revs or from muddy chest) which can be turned into three different potions. 
---
A) A luck potion - made by adding 6 onyx bolt tips to the Bloodweed Unf and has the effect of a ring of wealth for an hour. 
---
B) The Aggression Potion. By adding Searing Ash which is a drop from the wilderness slayer task Lava Strykewyrms. You get a 3 doses Aggression Potion which when consumed makes every enemy within several steps aggressive and lasts for six minutes.
---
C) Camouflage Potion. Made with a Black Salamander. It removes your character from the minimap when consumed. 
---
The concept did not revive the wilderness at all as its RS3 so obviously. The luck rework a few months later killed the little value the wealth potion had. I forgot the camouflage potion existed until just now. The aggression potions are valuable for obvious reasons. 
---
I used a tool called "dungeon painter studio" which is 14,99€ on Steam. You can layer your stuff just like in photoshop or gimp. Building stuff feels like "the sims" though. If you are interested increating rp maps this program is definitely your way to go
---
Don't quote me on this, but wouldn't a fury, obby legs and chest be better than tort, d legs and torso? 
---
Too far.
---
Make it so anyone can harvest it
---
&gt; Why not just make it so you can trim/untrim any cape

Because then untrimmedness loses all meaning. :l

Reds are usually the best balance for gp and xp

What’s the point of this post... I can better edit a fake picture from my Motorola Razor
---
Try melee, it works surprisingly well. You can kill Vorkath with a budget of around 37 mill (which is fairly budget at that part of the game). What you need is:
---
\- Zamorakian Hasta (lance would be better but hey)
---
\- Torag's set (apart from the helm, bandos armour would be better)
---
\- Serp helm
---
\- Dragonfire shield (anti-dragon if you don't have it/can't afford it)
---
\- Best boots you have
---
\- Barrows gloves
---
\- Fire cape or infernal
---
\- Bandos godsword
---
Pray mage constantly and flick piety. Use a bandos godsword if you have one to lower his defence and jab away at him. During the poison phase you can do a much slower Woox Walk.
---
Are you the OP? Or what?

I first "got membership" in 2006 when a random guy PM'd me saying he'd give me an account with membership for 250k.

I did, and he actually gave me an account with about 2 weeks of membership. The character was a girl so I bought the blue shirt and shorts, with blue flowers. I was 10 at the time, living out my deepest fantasies.

No one would have an issue with splashing if a player had to interact with the game every 5 mins, just like you do with every other single afk training method. People splash with fire strike for 10 gp/10 xp a cast. These players are getting 1.8m xp monthly for 0 effort and minimal costs while they sleep. It is the epitome of ezscape. NMZ is just as atrocious to the fundamentals of the game and that is why there was so much outrage when it was implemented.
---
Depends on how you examine them
---
You can easily kill one in 40 seconds, the real bottleneck may be that theres only two of them and you might have to wait for them to respawn.

The games "Meant to be played" however you want lmfao, you can't deny it does make things easier in that way, no missclicking tiles when its literally lit up for you and you can turn it off, but whatever dude I literally don't care how you play.
---
Are you sure it’s from playing? I’ve had 20/20 since I was born and I’ve been a heavy gamer since day 1 
---
Just spam clicking prayer as fast as you can isn't going to work for pray flicking, you have to actually click just once or twice per game tick (depending on method used).
---
Methods like rebinding your mouse are fine because you're actually still putting in your own effort, however little it may be. This guy can just turn on his autoclicker and go to sleep while still gaining full experience.
---
To like 60, yeah. Putting in 100 hours to save a minute or two here and there isn't worth it though. Unless you're planning to max efficiently I guess.

Slayer with ppots is awesome

I know this is mosty a joke, but on a serious note. Don't compare yourself to your siblings in any way. What they do and enjoy defines them in a way it will never define you. Just do what you enjoy, and as long as you are happy, he could make 10000x what you do in a year but that still wont matter.
---
Either way I think both NMZ and pray flicking need to go. 
---
I think most would disagree.
---
That rng is nothing I went 437 kills for an earth talisman off an earth wizard south of fally.
---
2 months? get the fuck out of here.   it takes 2 years to get 31 RC
---
Grind 8 hours of work for 15 days and buy gp is probably the fastest and most reliable :o
---
maybe if the luck potion was a tier 4 luck item it would have use because then you won't be risking the expensive ring while still having the effect (and you need crushed dragonstone, not onyx bolt tips). ring of wealth effect is useless because it's 11k. tier 4 ring is 39m

---
But but bills
---
It was definitely a fun idea to think about for a while, I remember tweeting Mod Ash about it in ~2014 and got shot down due to engine work. At this point it feels like it's too late in the game to add a new game mode for people to make brand new accounts on. I know won't restart all over again to do it after a pure, main, ironman, and another pure. If it was added shortly after, maybe a year after ironman release, then I'd be all for it but now it's just too late to add yet another game mode for people to keep track of.
---
It's cause his Supra looks like shit and he is just now realizing he's a cunt.
---
Unfortunately PvM content these days needs pray flicking to even stand a chance at succeeding. They actually design new content with pray flicking in mind.

Most phished accounts are used for botting probably hacked mate

Wrong sub and also just plain wrong.

I've always felt like Agility is far more unbearable than Runecraft. More attention required, less profit... why does nobody complain about Agility as much?

Regardless if its RS3 or OSRS I am locked. The fact that this happened twice even when I did not file any dispute is what is fucking annoying
---
Have you considered staking? 50/50 chance of getting tbow 
---
Sounds like a good time
---
Truth. They're selling better than my toadflax right now 
---
I don't like slayer for a few reasons, but mainly two things: the xp is so fucking slow, and hitting the hop limit trying to find an open spot is aids, especially at places like dust devil's where there's 1 good area for bursting.
---
Doesn't help that have 99s in my cb stats too so it's not like I'm making up for the low xp.

i got banned for botting, and splashing is the worst thing ive ever done...

Not sure about that, I see a LOT of graceful

was like \~26 off kill count
---
Well compared to those two you can at least afk most of slayer, and there’s a lot of bosses to kill. I do love when people tell me MLM is afk tho, that shit triggers me.
---
haha i don't think i'll ever get that :p
---
the stat boost timer doesn't work like it used to now there are 5x12s intervals (i think) and if you are at 48s and relog you'll still be at 48 or at least what I explained is pretty close to what is true
---
why do we keep posting these pictures again?

He's afraid people will look up rsn somewhere else because apparently genius uses the same tag everywhere. He fear that people will make fun of him for being gay.  Odds are none of this will happen and you should report it to a clan leader to take action if it does. But ya the whole post is stupid. 
---
Personally, I prefer the idea of a potion. I know that the economic access provided by the GE makes profiting on herblore difficult (or at least it used to). I also know that people tend to sperg out when suggestions from RS3 are presented. But I think the item has to be consumable to remain valuable, and the wilderness definitely does need some rejuvenation, and so on. Yes to everything—patch, seed, herb, potion. 
---
Do you have a source about them not pursuing legal action? Not saying you are lying about it, just haven't seen anything about it

I did Galvek with a rune crossbow and ruby bolts at 76 range. Pray mage first phase and range the rest. He hits hard, so bring brews and restores, but you'll probably be okay as long as you pay attention and don't get hit by the fireball or phase3 waves.

I do not think it should be tradable either. I feel like it is one of those unique tool items. I also like the idea of suffering until you get it lol

how do i see this? is this part of runelite?

I thought of this but I wasn't sure how much I liked the idea. I don't think I am opposed to it but it doesn't hurt to create a whole new item.
---
It works really and is pretty afk at mole. It is also good at black brutals. Anything with a high magic attack really. I've heard you could use it at zammy gwd but I haven't tried.  It works well on the mage and range DK.

---
to make the pot sweeter, the herbs you pick get 3x the amount of xp and 3x the amount of herbs and the herbs picked will be noted. however the twist is that there will be an area chat where the player has picked x amount of herb with the current prices

it's weak to slash so people usually use a whip I think, blowpipe for shooting the flowers. Unless the meta has changed

No you're not. You even say your self that you're not looking at the screen. The game plays itself when you're splashing just like botting.
---
i can get like 5 kills solo if i wanted
---
Not his fault. His parents probably told him thats the only way to be happy.

Absolutely agree. I'm not supporting botting so much as I am attacking splashing and afk methods.

Ugh I feel the same way. I’ve been procrastinating on finishing the Kebos diary because I’m too lazy to find people to do a raid with. 
---
idk maybe some old fisher dropped his harpoon in the sea and you reel it in
---
TFW they could add free coin drops to the wildy to "rejuvenate PvP" and it still appease the brainlets.
---
Not sure why you're bashing, this outfit is worth about 5-6m ?
---
1.5m mask
---
1m chain
---
150k skirt
---
500k boots
---
All the ornaments 300k-500k?
---
Whip 2.5m
---
You're onto something there. A tower defence minigame would be awesome
---
Would crafting darts auto load a blow pipe
---
I wouldn't necessarily want a constant icon on the enemy but it would be nice to have  an animation for when it happens
---
The activity bar definitely helped PC. 
---
Stop fighting. :(
---
this thread alone makes it pretty clear that people absolutely don't want be to talk about my sexuality at all so yeah the community is pretty anti-lgbtq
---
Your a brain dead loser. Read this from a few weeks back from a JMod.

Clearly here he states that there are people out there persistent enough to hack your shit and there isn’t nothing that can be done.

---
So? Who cares? If I want to show off that I jumped through those hoops, shouldn't I be able to show off that I did? I want my achievement to stand out, it is an MMO after all.
---
The above is a dumb argument. It's an achievement that is oddly specific, requires a lot of effort, and can only continue to exist by exploiting game mechanics not meant to be exploited. Just because you *could* do it and get a visible reward for it doesn't mean you *should* be able to do it. And yet if we didn't have the ability to choose to untrim our achievement capes you would have people arguing that the ability to untrim it shouldn't be added because people did jump through all those hoops to keep it untrimmed. And that's exactly my point. If we had the choice from the very beginning to untrim skillcapes, no one would care. Sure, people would still do HP or Slayer as their first cape as an achievement, but they would either take a screenshot and move on, or keep their untrimmed without leveling any other skills to 99. No one would even think twice about it. 
---
People need to be able to show off their achievements in MMOs, that's true. And you should be able to make up your own goals that aren't intended by the developers, it keeps the game interesting. But making up your own goals, using a reward meant for something else entirely as the reward for your goal, using a glitch to keep that reward, and then expecting the developers to facilitate all of the above is just insane. And the fact that they have up to this point is also kind of insane.

you be surprised how many women are disloyal. its honestly damn near on par with men.

This.

I've been with my rsgf for over 6 months now. I'm pretty certain she's a guy, but why rock the boat? She makes me happy, and that's all that matters. I get to cyber with her everyday, and all she asks is that I buy her some gear and give her a gift here and there. Pretty good deal if you ask me. 
---
This isn't QoL
---
QoL is if you also give each spell +5 higher max hit, smh people these days don't know what QoL is.
---
Nah, bp only holds 16k darts anyways. You can make 10-20k darts a raid depending on how efficient you are in doing both the raid and the fletching.
---
You missed the point homie, look at op name...
---
Great idea. Lets make every slayer monster have at least 1m/hr drop table. 
---
Isn't it only worth it if the +1 strength bonus gets you to a new modifier that's divisible by 4 (i.e. actually gets your a max hit)? Otherwise investing in tank legs would be the way to go.
---
Source: Obby legs didn't increase my max hit, opted for Torag's instead.
---
Dev time isn't the issue. Non permanent members are a very small portion of the active community that it wouldnt pass a poll
---
saw nothing pking related in there sadly
---
Yikes. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Just use apkpure 
---
change the font and add a lockpick?
---
just leech a raid, you just get to go afk while the other people finish and it counts as a kc for you
---
If you care and want to see the numbers, look up “Bitterkoekje DPS calculator.” You simply enter in your stats, gear, pots/pray, and the NPC name and it’ll show you the DPS as well as other cool info such as accuracy and cost/hr for things like blowpipe/trident.
---
You can also compare two setups to see which has higher DPS. In 99% of cases the setup with higher DPS is the better one. Exceptions include things like bursting where more pray gear is better than magic accuracy because the DPS increase is negligible 
---
Awesome man. I was on that exact beach in November and I rock the exact same slayer set up Purple slay helm etc. Only issue is I’m 97 slayer!
---
Bis gloves...

feel free to stop posting and leave the post if you feel like it's a waste of time

At around which combat level do 1 Defence pures start losing to mains or tankier PKing builds within their combat level bracket? It seems like 85 cb near maxed pures would struggle against meds or even 100 cb mains
---
I wish we had aggro pots in OSRS.... I miss those things

bless you for being stupid but the guy gave out his information lol. there wasn't "nothing that can be done". just dont give out your information like a retard lole

Try getting your magic higher and unlock fairy rings. Walking to some of the dungeons is a real ball ache.

You'll get more herbs when skulled, but Jagex won't tell you that.

Do you know how to reddit? I was responding to his comment?
---
Trees. I have like 12 extra atm
---
Could you explain the 90s health and dharok method?
---
I thought the dharok method was getting melee only monsters, eating rock cake to get your health to around 1, then praying protect from melee at low health?
---
Dude's never getting laid ever again.

I do like grinding.

 If you bite it and you die, it's **poison**. If it bites you and you die, it's **venom**.

Thanks. 
---
Unnecessary, half my bossing content is in the wildy anyways 
---
Defense over attack bonuses isn't super necessary in most PvM encounters with only a few exceptions
---
What are your combat stats?
---
how many places would they realistically be used at? They're useless for slayer because of the silver bracelets and kind of a waste of money. 
---
Why would you expect people to talk about your sexuality? I don’t care what you identify as. I understand we should not judge what you are but judging the whole community as homophobic is just toxic. 
---
o

Hump dayyyyy

Because we are here to play runescape not talk sexuality?

Aren't all trees just small versions of big trees?
---
Yep, also seeing the RuneLite logo on some students' taskbar.

Take your senseless bitching elsewhere. We dont know what to do about mtx chargebacks, the reason should be *obvious.* Try lighting up one of your mods on Twitter, that is basically what we do over here when we have unreasonable demands.

What is this, skyrim?

that's great and all but then I get in discord and people tell me I "sound gay" etc
---
This is why polls should be locked behind a "x amount of hours played" and not  fucking 300 total or whatever it is.
---
You're not very bright are you?
---
It really is
---
thats why just only few stay "rich" lmao
---
Morytania locked
---
Is this a rope joke
---
Zulrah is pretty easy tbow only 
---
I mean so far no clans have said "yeah we're ok with lgbt people"' only people here so far have been talking shit
---
judging the whole community as homophobic is not far from accurate
---
There were definitely people in my last clan that sounded gay but no one got on their case about it. Like I said tell the clan leaders or ranks you are being harassed and if they don't take care of it find another clan. 
---
If they said THEY were not pursuing jed, that simply means they are not pursing a civil case against him, with the severity of his actions its entirely possible there is a criminal case (which would be out of the hands of jagex) 
---
I'll have to look in to that, thanks for your detailed answers, and thanks for making such awesome rs inspired content :)
---
Can we take the Tithe Farm fromZeah with the GE and add it to the Stam sink bridge? 
---
and then theres the whole runefest thing.... why does anyone still care about this guy?
---
yes you can bank the whole stack. Its nice when you have like 300 chins stacked up you can just run south a screen and send them to the bank and go back to catching chins in like 10 seconds, but in my experience I rarely manage to make it past 200-250 chins before someone comes along and I have to leave, at which point if you can use your imp box you can just tele out with glory or seed pod, or you get teleblocked in which case you can't use the imp box anyways.
---
Its up to you how often you want to send a stack of chins home, but each imp box can only be used to send two stacks before it becomes the magic box trap item again. so if you're sending off chins every 50-100 then you'll need to bring a few boxes with you, and they aren't tradeable so you have to trap the imps yourself which takes time.
---
I like you and runecraft

Can you post the entire email address?

I would reccomend against high level worlds. In my experience even with just the 1750 and 1500 worlds it's the first place pkers check.

Wanna know something crazy? I got the firecape on my first try ever when I was a kid. I got INSANELY lucky. I didn’t know Jad hit with both range and magic so I only prayed magic. I tanked over 10 range hits.

I did this yesterday lol

I didn't play until 2003 so I'm not really sure what pures were like before then. I didn't really have a basis for that statement aside from assumption, so my apologies. What were pures like in classic?

How do the phishing streams have so many views? Do the phishers just have their own "bots" viewing or is there a way to fake the viewing numbers?

I loved the grapple boats simply because you could move the boat over land.

That sounds incredibly fishy to begin with.

No reason to.

Can someone explain to me how people make money at revs. I legit have gone 5 times and before my first kill I'm tbed and then ploop I'm ded
---
You can buy views easily I'm pretty sure.
---
Change both agility and runecrafting higher exp rates 50-60k p/h no money made to balance it out. 
---
Probably 50% view bots.
---
I had this, me living in the UK and some Californian girl, we talked for about 3 years till she moved over for 6 months. Nothing but crushin' muffin for half a year. Good times.

Now that’s $11 I can get behind 
---
How can you tell how many hours you've played?

agreed. bad trend of people on this subreddit just wanting the game to be as easy as possible.

Whats wrong?

Good to know. I haven't ever participated much on twitch so I wasn't sure how that was possible. You'd think twitch would try to resolve stuff like this.

How long does this stay? Can other people see it?

Did you accidently stumble across a Japanese server by any chance?

Agility IS just runecrafting...  but you don't get runes at the end of each lap so it's for free

Takes one hell of a company to do it too.

Pobodys nerfect.

...no lmao

I know, wtf is up with it? It's a good youtube series but the amount of reddit attention it's getting makes absolutely no sense

It's rigged for clans like RoT to farm and make infinite money, but not solo players, basically.
---
you type idiot or retarded with every response you make. it's seems like you think a bit too highly of yourself.
---
And you didn't answer my question, you just explained what RWT is like I have no idea what that means, lol.
---
VERY smart, ahead, and talented. 
---
Damn you’re retarded 
---
Zulrah - Using mag is faster kills but tbow makes it semi afk
---
Sire - It's better than arclight, worse than a blowpipe with Rune darts (assuming 1 hammer hits)
---
Hydra - Yeah
---
Chaos elemental - If you're comfortable in the wilderness (craws is slightly better)
---
KBD - You take a bit more damage, but tbow rips KBD.
---
Mole - I wouldn't bother unless you hard fally hard+ completed
---
Dks - Makes killing prime a breeze, giving you much more time for the other two
---
K'ril - Better than arclight, and BiS for some solo methods.
---
BBDs - About 1m/hr afk profit with a tbow

If you’re low level, just try to stick to less populated worlds, don’t bring any items you’re not willing to lose, have a quick teleport option and watch your minimap like a hawk. If you see someone appear log out or tele immediately. You’ll probably die more than once to pkers, but if you bring the bare minimum you’ll more than make up for your losses with emblem drops.
---
Don’t ever attack someone or retaliate and risk getting skulled. A lot of pkers will try to trick people into retaliating and getting skulled so they   drop everything. Best bet is to try to run to safety.
---
Not hiding polls is defenitely infuriating

Gold sinks are important imo. Without them it's just inflation forever, and this seems like an elegant way to do it.

If you are using RuneLite, it will mark a suggested cannon position in the room (if there is one)

Lose some switches, i only do split scaled raids so losing 2 mins and 2000 personal points don’t matter to me.

Hespori and GE

It would be less OP in osrs since there's less AOE. And you'd still need to trample mobs to get them to stack for AOE

both of them suck

Didn’t know you could get from GE, thank you!

It's a chargeback whether you intend it or not. What you are asking for is absolutely irrational. They have outlined exactly how to get your account back. Imagine trying to use a debit card with $-10 on it, and complaining that your bank won't let you do that. That's basically what is going on here. Of course they won't let you use your account dude, *you owe them money.* What are you not understanding about this? If the money is out of your account it doesn't necessarily mean it's in theirs. If your bank flags your payments as often as you say, it's time to find another bank. Beyond that, we can't wave a magic wand and help you. If you were physically in front of me, I'd probably hand you 10 bucks. That's literally the only thing you can do for this. Jagex isn't a shit company for charging you for services (not saying they aren't a shit company).
---
If I were you, I'd pay for bonds in-game and not bother with mtx if you like the game but dont want to give them any money. You still owe them $10.

If you are going to include any exceptions at all, then the entire premise is already invalid. You have added a laundry list of exceptions that basically says, I plan to play runescape on this account.

Ah thanks for the update man, seems like you got the exact same issue as me! Glad it wasn't just my account 
---
Picking a good spawn and your box placement is important. Not sure if you're inquiring about this stuff, but I'll give you what I found to be best.
---
First find a chin spawn, in my opinion in the northern spot the best spawn is the one that's most southwest. Then set up your boxes like this
---
[ ]  [ ]  X
---
[ ]  O  [ ] 
---
X   [ ]  [ ]
---
The second best spot in the northern area would be the most south spawn. Set the traps like this
---
[ ]  [ ]  [ ]
---
[ ]  O   [ ]
---
X   [ ]   X
---
It's definitely worth it to hunt with other people (if you don't think they'll attack you), as the chins respawn faster and stay closer to your boxes if they get caught more. So knowing that second spot is pretty useful.
---
There was a RuneScape clan called "the RS police" a long, long, long time ago and I remember getting in trouble for "impersonating Jagex staff" for talking about it.
---
He's an ironman, though. They can't buy essence from the NMZ shop.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=osrs+ironman+reddit

Probably buy me a bandos chestplate er something

I don't think an aggro potion will hinder inflation. Lol
---
Besides, you can make it chargable with runes or whatever
---
Ecks dee 
---
Can you show us validation of non members and your bank?
---
You may have planted as it ticked. Thats not celastrus first stage
---
Thats the sum of all the non unique drops, it does add up over a long period of time tho :P
---
False

Thats where ur wrong

This is brilliant lmao

You don't get them from the Falador Hard diary, that's RS3

I like your name.

That's the tank don't worry

850 Raids till first tbow split, ouch

It's really good and a lot of people like it. Like Westworld, GoT, Witcher, and many other things, their popularity gains upvotes, which increases visibility. Then karma whores wring the train dry. The Reddit cycle.

This is a player thread, mods don't read these
---
Stake it again = 600m
---
What the hyuck*
---
Well now that hydra craze died down lance going to linger around 100m for 3-6 months before reaching its intended price which is like 30-75m. Gonna vote no on any buffs and my 20k alt accounts.
---
Bonus points for having a legends cape vs their obsidian cape.
---
Could the hunter kit spell be reworked so you can cast it multiple times instead of being required to open the box before casting again?   It used to be like this years ago.
---
Bots don’t respond though...
---
That's inconsistent though. If you're in the middle of a fight does the enemy really stop and let you have an hour long shark picnic? Does eating a sandwich or a handful of shrimp also somehow take an entire hour? Is time convoluted in this land? 
---
Why are you juggling? The drops stay on the ground for an hour. I just leave all bones on the ground til the last kill, then pick them all up before I tele out. 
---
I find using preserve helps alot in combat pots
---
Who actually presses close bank? Just tap randomly on the map so your character starts moving. The map's big enough on mobile.

this man gets it

Needed higher slayer for that

Can we remove the maple tree as a hard farming guild contract task? Iirc it’s a 45 farming requirement that people often skip for faster plants and since the skips are “easier” you can get screwed with growing banana trees etc. Might be better as a medium requirement.
---
Apologize in advance for shitty comment, just think it’s not the right spot to assign maple trees.
---
If I place some  tool on one tool leprechaun do all of them have it or do I have to place them on every single one of them?

OMG Pog, right now we have 9, with this, it wil be 11! from 9 to 11!!
---
&gt; Likewise, it doesn't make sense for non-skillers to vote for non-skilling related updates.
---
Whats a non skiller?
---
i cant solo raids i suck lmao
---
He wants to make sure his herbs dont die
---
Yeah I mean if the portal nexus can have that option, why not the jewelry box too? The code cant be *that* different right? and I cant say it really pushes EZ-Scape too much, a little but I wont be mad.  
---
Funny thing about high alch is you used to have to time it on the second shine of the animation. Now you can just spam it...
---
This.
---
I would drag my balls through a mile of broken glass for this.
---
That's like playing a horror game and then turning up the brightness just so you can get to say you beat it
---
Agreed I'll never watch a fuckin stream with annoying ass glowing boxes all over the screen
---
Bgs is pretty mandatory yeah. You also absolutely need the salve ammy ei which is free but not listed here so if you don't have it, get it. Elite void is also recommended. 
---
As long as you have the spec pool you can gimp through bgs/blowpipe kills, ornate pool is nice cuz it gets rid of the venom but you're just looking at occasionally spending an extra antivenom+ dose which is not the end of the world. So you can just use low level pool/altar almost as well. You definitely want a lunar island portal in house though, that's the best banking method. 
---
I’d say mine is quiet average/below average. Had loads of kodai and elder mauls and was 850+ without tbow, I’ve also missed 3 bows in my clan with people I always raid with and clan mates have less KC than me with more bow splits. Always missed by waking up late or sleeping early. #NeverLucky 
---
Do you guys have any plan on making a new method of training RuneCrafting? It's a quite hated skills.
---
Facebook is absolute trash for finding posts like that on a page. No idea how it works
---
south of the volcano, or by lava sounds cool, considering volcanic ash is used in ultracompost and the patch could be a permanent ultracompost patch where you could grow a new special herb that only grows in that patch. 
---
That's literally the dumbest analogy I've had the priveledge of reading, thanks chief.
---
Yeah the dick-riders do
---
For Mat K, where's Crack The Clue 2? we need more mystery in the game 
---
why do they care? it was a long time ago, it's ok to move on from things in the past, this is the first time i've heard her name in years
---
oh shit an hour! I thought it was 30 minutes. and not so much "juggling", as more just rearranging my inventory, decanting pots, alching shit, and my inv is basically full of bones &amp; loot at that point. Poor choice of words, on my part. 
---
Having a bad day man? Let people enjoy what they enjoy. 
---
Allow us to chisel a large ornamental statue similar to that from The Giant Dwarf quest. The Elder Maul would only need to be in the inventory to serve as the hammer and we could even use a Godsword as the chisel.
---
It's killing me.
---
Tasks above 70 slayer will generally make more money
---
i dont really think it would, but it could potentially be a t65 weapon instead of 60... 
---
viggora's is way better for strength training than d scimmy at 60 attack anyway, and at 70 or 75, there are even better options so it wouldnt be much of a power creep imo
---
Either a more afk to train it (can't train it on one window while slaying on main like most skills) or make it more engaging with faster XP rates (think agility pyramid or burthrope sudoku), just something that doesn't force you to play run simulator for hours.

Can you please add more people of kharidian descent and maybe add more kebab stores to cities across runescape to make the world feel more realistic?

Can the farming guild and warriors guild options on the equipped max cape be switched.

Reason being that the warriors guild is rarely used by maxed player, but the farming guild is frequently used.

I’m 1265kc, never seen a damn bow
---
or how i like to call it, kkk uhcim
---
No I meant bits and pieces across a long, drawn out fight. Like the old legends, it would take them hours or even days to kill the dragon. Our characters are so powerful it takes forever to kill, so there is a lot of time during the fight to steal bites if food to recover strength. 
---
Use those yellow tinted gamer glasses. They actually work.
---
Stop being lazy, get the agility shortcut and camp the darkbeast and ork. Literally impossible to die if you have that.
---
unless you just can't stand a whole task that upgrade is worthless, no extra xp and less chances at the pet.
---
Hidden detail!  nice touch on the router!
---
Daym, no splits? What size raids do you mostly do. 
---
"Much" worse is a stretch.
---
Obby cape gives +9 defensive stats
---
Legends gives +7 defensive stats
---
Legends is also locked behind a quest and imo way better looking. It definitely holds more esteem imo.
---
Yeah, but depending on what those things are, you might ruin it for the dedicated pvp community.

He’s been on f2p for a little more than three weeks now, he’s had a blast but I can’t help but feel he’s seeking more now as basically we all know most of the content is p2p. It seems like he’s at the point where f2p has nothing left to yield for him but grind and I’ve been researching quite unsuccessfully methods for time efficient grinding on f2p to get him a bond so I thought asking around here might be a better source of information.

Can i get banned for using osbuddy?
---
That's up to the Jmod's discretion.

I personally think it's fair to consider a person that is below level 30 in a certain skill a non skiller.
---
What don't you get? Ironman has been out for a few years so there's plenty of people who you can watch max out or the like. Area restricted ironmen are playing the game in a new way, and its more interesting to think about a series that's challenging for the player, anyone can google p2p training methods, ARIMs make their own path.

What you mean abusing bounty hunter mechanics? It seems to be working just as intended.

Looting F2P widy pvp drops, depending on your total cash stack you may want to look for some quick flips, look into mining as well. Perhaps doing something together can make it feel less of a grind, this is a game after all. Good luck!

This. Construction is one of the best investments you can make imo. Although if op just wants to pound Cox all day, buying bis for more gp could be the way to go till you get bored of it.

Defense requirement on blessed chaps seems more like a balance issue than a poll issue tbh. +1 pray bonus but more risk is basically the perfect example of a good risk/reward system, should just be implemented tbh.

Is there any way to actually prove you didn't leave the room during these kills? Only 92 slayer, so not too familiar with Hydra.

I mean it's a ton of work to get done. Granted, for a lot of older accounts it's not so bad but I just came back when mobile dropped and had to make a fresh account, I'm level 104 atm and by far my most difficult achievement was RFD imo just due to the sheer volume of requirements to be met. You have to get like 176 of the 266 quest points just to even finish the damn thing. It's a bit of work

Don't blame you dying on clans like rot. Rot only camp the high total level worlds, which from the sounds of it, you're no where near having access to those. If you don't do what you can to avoid being pked, then the death is on you.
---
Its intentional, there's actually a lot of statistics behind it. If they type properly, they risk the chance of intelligent people wasting the scammers' time and possibly reporting them. By typing like a retard, it makes the spam go over the heads of anyone smart enough to not get scammed thinking, "who would ever fall for this?" But people stupid enough to fall for a scam wouldn't notice the awful grammar, sentence structure, etc. But if it's too bad, then they risk even the people they scam getting suspicious or the messages become unintelligible.
---
Official lore could prove me wrong, but it makes the most sense to me. 
---
I'd definitely take the time to use desktop clients for that and agility. It's just too difficult to do on mobile

Thankful for the profanity filter so I can talk shit without getting muted.
---
For some reason a large portion of the player base of this game play for bragging rights instead of just having fun.
---
Add a separate bar for the acb spec and I’ll be happy
---
Yeah I see what you’re saying. I’m not sure if it’s the same for other combination runes, but with lavas there is no 5 tick crafting delay meaning that you can empty your pouches as fast as you can click them and also teleport away much quicker. So yeah, it isn’t possible with ‘normal’ runes due to the crafting delay; would need someone else to confirm if there is no crafting delay for combination runes other than lavas though.

The prices weren't even all that different tho dude lol. It was cheaper to get dsl (not dcl i didnt realize phone kept auto correcting it) and a flat screen in 07 vs dial up and a crt in the 90s. If anything i understand the monitor upgrade if you werent able to - but internet wise it was cheaper than dial up.

They become unusable in f2p worlds 
---
I'm not sure they were voted no out of spite, although that's a possibility. I've seen many users here give reasons why they voted no: because they thought armour should have def requirements. Whether or not that's a good reason is another matter, but they did vote with some reason in mind and not just out of spite.
---
I found I had this mentality about a lot of quests when I got back into playing, was shocked how much easier they are then I remember

Not anymore .... They disabled it ffs

But rs3 didn't exist 14 years ago

Theres an option called stickykeys in windows that does exactly that.

I would like to know where your "computer glasses" statement comes from. How do they tend to do more harm than good? I've gotten half my office hooked on these yellow tinted glasses. It literally makes all office work easier on the eyes.

Not saying there's anything wrong with that I just can't imagine not having at least a laptop and being able to do what I need to do for much of my day-to-day tasks, but then again you may be in different circumstances

There isn't as much spitefulness as reddit likes to think. Why would somebody who only pvms vote yes to anything that makes it easier for them to die? It's logical that they vote no.

If they actually make meaningful pvp polls that aren't "we're improving this method of killing you", they'll pass.

No they switch right before the kill

i clicked the forum link he had in the description, didn't write in anything though, am i fucked?

Are you saying legion was bad? Because it was honestly one of the best expansions the game has seen. BFA though? Is a pretty strong contender for worse and I'm hoping it honestly gets even worse to the point that the game has so little subs that they have no choice but to either release a good expansion of drop the game entirely.

Cannon in wildy on krys task and you get like 40-50k slayer/hr, emblems = mad profit/pay for cballs. You dont get killed often and even if yoy do still ahead, not afk though.

Welp, sorry for the not-so-quick response now, and not very useful either. But I remember a few months back I had an issue with payment before and after going in a roundabout way for a good 10 minutes through their website, I found something along the lines of "problem still not solved?" and was able to submit an actual ticket. I couldn't tell you exactly where it was, but I remember it wasn't easy to get to. 
---
And yes, while it is unfair to be paying for two accounts you don't want to, but this way you'll be able to do something afk on one game while playing the other if that's something you want

At your level you just breeze through the entire thing. The only possibly hard part is dealing with the healers and you could get around that by just out-healing them with a Tbow if you can't be bothered to aggro them.

IGN: Calming Rain
---
There is a shortcut between the Trollheim Teleport and the disease-free patch. Currently you need both the agility level AND the Freminink Hard Diary complete in order to use this shortcut. 
---
I notice however that the Freminink hard diary ALSO provides a direct teleport to the top of the shortcut once completed. This seems like it defeats the purpose of unlocking the shortcut. 73 agility is already quite a requirement in and of itself.
---
Is there a chance that the Hard Diary requirement could be removed for the shortcut? 
---
Just started doing NMZ myself. If you're going for points make sure you have the desert treasure bosses on or you'll see a huge drop in points. There are a few that are really annoying to fight like the dag mother, dad, and the haunted mine boss (I can't spell his name), so I turned those off. I also turned the RFD bosses off since their a boss in there that behaves like the dag mother.

Let's just turn rev caves into a new darkscape. Because that worked out so well...

dont worry man most agree with you, these people "enjoying" quests are just losers who have literally nothing else to do in life so they get on video games and do chores. Its extremely pathetic

You should honestly just knock it out. I'm lvl 97 as well and I just got my fire cape 2 days ago on my first try. I didn't even use great gear. Rune crossbow and full blessed d'hide. Took me about 1.5h and Jad was honestly way easier than I expected. Just remember to stay calm and only do 1 thing at a time between prayer switches. 
---
If you're pking in BH worlds via 1v1's, then I like to keep HP on the lower end for the sake of having higher stats @ a lower combat level.

But if you're going to be pking with friends in multi then don't worry about your HP, you're going to want as much health as you can get. 
---
Just wait until you have to get level 2 rc

what kind of absolute loser gets on video games to follow step by step quest instructions as the most fun thing to do? honestly man you need more hobbies

&gt; What's stopping somebody from recompiling runelite from the source and adding their own custom plugins?
---
Nothing I imagine; I recall seeing some GitHub repo a while back with "extra" plugins for RuneLite, but can't seem to find it anymore
---
"You can put somewater on me and i'll be ok" waterproof.
---
Not "you can dive with me and farm watermelons on OSRS at the same time" waterproof.
---
Camo pot is busted af.
---
how is an entire kill being deleted sweaty 
---
if you're getting *another* herb patch there shouldn't be extra herbs.. the incentive is you're getting *another* herb patch 
---
Love the 1 RC though.
---
Can we change the look of the lizardman shamens in Chambers of Xeric to look like the ones from the Lizardman Temple? I believe the new design fits the overall themes of the CoX.
---
It won't be released. The RL devs aren't retarded. Just because someone codes their own plugin and uses it doesn't mean it'll ever be released for everyone to use, even if they submit it to the devs. 
---
Start getting your farming up when you start members as it's essential for maintaining a bond as a lower level

10/10 botting
---
Well it's a little slower for sure but if you use black chins which have higher range then that'll probably make it faster. 
---
And you have a chance to fall off even at 99 agility and you slowly swim all tbe way back to the side you came from
---
Have never heard anyone use this
---
Fire making to 70 so my tears of Guthix can go to RC, and probably Zammy later. Easy day
---
He also punched a osrs streamer or something
---
Your technically correct, but in actuality 23.8m agility experience is the equivalent of level 105
---
There's a bunch of phishing streams each day, whether they're quitting stream or double xp streams. I've even seen a triple xp stream.
---
As long as runelite is allowed then all custom plugins are fair game so long as it doesn't trigger bot detection.
---
Ah that's sad, luckily never saw a bow in one of my ffas
---
Tbow is less reliable than dragon dart blowpipe on jad if you are looking to burn healers. Sure you can get big hits with bow but its slow so if it noodles you're fucked.
---
black chins are always worth getting. you can do it offtask but that just means even more chins per kill and shorter trips.
---
&gt;not stomping on a crab irl to achieved simultaneous 99 Slayer irl

Have my upvote anyway. 
---
Not enough gesturing.
---
but did you not complete barbarian training or something lol?
---
Yeah, just not sure if the trade off is that big that it's not worth it?
---
Hehe, l8er virgins. I’ll meet you outside Lumby by the fountains bb.
---
Yeah I guess if you're mainly going for just slay xp. I use slayer for melee xp personally, and do boss variants more often than not.
---
Also like, a good chunk of people don't care about "max efficiency" 
---
At the top end Ferocious Gloves are BiS melee, Torment Brace is BiS Mage, and Barrows gloves are BiS for ranged.
---
Idk how people act so high and mighty about Barrows gloves like it's not a priority for us who don't have it. I'm literally over 700 kc dry without a glove drop. 
---
What yellowsucks said. 
---
If you have PVP IQ it's much easier to last longer/get more kills/escape, etc. Mainly because of have the experience of PvP scenarios, you understand the mechanics better, you know where the typical login spots are, you can spot a scout/bait/potential unskulled pker lurking around faster. 
---
But it will still and always will be in favor of clans since you're in multi. 
---
Sometimes it isn't even your skill level but bad luck - hop into a clan, in combat with a rev so can't logout, rev freezes you, you misclick on your tele, etc. 
---
Barbarian training is for people who don’t like living on the edge.
---
Bruh you think a 124 without a fcape has a tbow?
---
But also buyable+requires no stats(I think?) vs long annoying quest

:o I didn'tt even think of that. Just reset my task each time if i Don't get it to get easy task?

Happy cake day!

I’ve thought about using the dragonbone necklace to extend trips like this before. But man, didn’t think anyone would do it and complete a whole task in 1 trip lol. Very nice!

I was a PMod back in 2007. I was also 13 years old. It was always a lot of fun talking to people. Most people respected you, some hated you. Getting that letter asking me to be a PMod was pretty exciting at 13, so that's up there, but this one takes the cake:
---
A mod friend and I would go to common botting areas and report them for botting. The system back then pushed mod reports to the top of the list. This meant a frenzy of random events would start spawning as we reported hundreds of bots. You couldn't dismiss random events back then, so we could clear out an entire area of Willow or Yew cutting bots pretty quickly. 
---
I have very vivid memories of the random events poofing in and players poofing away. It always started slow and ramped up to a couple a second poof poof poof poof.
---
It's not. It's another pk based client that has cheats in it well before this. Like being able to tell it who your friends are so you can't attack them in wild.
---
If you aren't using Expeditious/Slaughter bracelets than you aren't doing it right which is perfectly fine, but don't act like you are some how superior to the guy who tried to correct you.
---
Disgusting 
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I still try to do 8ish kills or so per trip but I suppose you're right that teles are really cheap atm. Guess I'll have to try teleing after each kill and see if I notice a big difference in kills/h. 
---
This, it's kinda enjoyable with the hasta. I'm about 7000 deep. Your post gives me simultaneous stress and inspiration on my grind. Can you help me by telling me how you hasta in the canyons. I usually take too much damage and end up doing it in the temple with peaches and monks

Is this only for new links? Or will people that have already linked their accounts get 14 extra days?

Questing
---
Indeed, not too serious anyways. Just an observation of this trend.
---
I love this idea. I get at least one seed almost every time I do a tree run. Plus I got bucket on 1kc and now the rewards just feel underwhelming for a boss you have to wait so long for.
---
I really like the temperature bar idea that was mentioned last time this was brought up. Everyone has a bar of 100 "units" of temperature. If it hits 0, you die/teleport out/0 reward/whatever, food restores this temperature at the same rate of health so every account is on equal playing field.

Karamja Elite Diary notes Iron and Steel dragon bar drops already. Making it easier to obtain those notes bar drops would be incredibly detrimental to the economy IMO.
---
BURN!
---
At least you have 65k scales now
---
Considering the collection log watches for the drop dragon warhammer. It can be tracked if it has been dropped. I was wondering about the possibility to include a guaranteed reward for 10000 shaman kills being a Warhammer if it had not been achieved at that point yet. 
---
In terms of lore. There are crates of Hammers in the caves and the soldiers are constantly dying to lizardman. It could be a reward from them for incredible service to their cause.
---
In terms of logistics, it wouldn't raise the bottom line too much because at 10000 kills there would have been an 86.5% chance to have gotten one at that point and the average person would have recieved approximately 2.3 Hammers by then
---
The hammer is an invaluable and indispensible item with one source and a drop philosophy that is unique from all others in the game except the visage but the visage is a bonus drop that is found supplementary to the dragon activities in RuneScape of which there are many. I feel like applying this unique drop design would counter the existing design that would already stand out from typical unique drops.
---
Economy wise, the value will always increase with every melee style boss that comes out. It would be too much of a hit to the price.
---
I just finished this grind and have been playing this almost every day for several years. I can say confidently that if anything started to drive me away from the game. It was this grind. It's an emotional and physical toll doing these shamans. This would be similar to vorkath head and kqhead in design. Please reply with feedback and opinions guys :)

Stickykeys are definitely allowed, it's an accessibility function for people with disabilities so they can't disallow it.
---
Yeah but I've seen this sub complaining about content not passing and that the polling system should be changed etc
---
Seems strange to wish for this change if less content will get implemented

How am I supposed to sit in that chair if a ladder is blocking the way........?

I mean farming in the wildy wouldn’t be that bad of an idea, i made a suggestion on it like 4 years ago and Kierrn commented saying he was interested
---
Here it is if anyone wants to see it, this is a reposted and revised version, the first one I ever posted was like 5 years ago and that has his comment. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/7dzqmo/suggestion_farming_in_the_wilderness/

look at 98 upside down :p
---
Is thermy a mediocre lvl93 slayer only boss that is totally outclassed by its minions actually that busy?????
---
if you don't like pvp then what do you like? Because most PvM content is just the same mechanics as NH pking but either dumbed down or not randomised.
---
But he keeps on forgetting

[Here's](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4av4b7ysh1lwddb/metronomeextended.zip/file) the source for an updated one I made the other day. It uses the default audio libraries so shouldn't need anything external. It allows custom sound files to be used as well as in game volume control. There is a bit of a dirty workaround to resolve some issues so I didn't make a PR for it.
---
=S
---
So that they can continue to pk if they ever want to. 
---
Anything above 52 prayer ruins his build for singles pking. Anything higher is for a competitive clan war build. 
---
If he isn’t in a clan then it doesn’t make sense to get higher prayer unless he’s going to give up solo pking. The combat levels gained from 99 prayer outs him at a disadvantage for BH. 
---
I mean. People did it with a friend, people did it with slayermusiq1, people did it with b0aty a few years back, and people will do it when a similar popular content creator arises to the spotlight. Not much of a surprise tbf

---
The hardest requirement is the 175 quest points. If you only do quests for RFD you end up with around ~135, so you have to grind a lot of unrelated quests.

Congrats on the trip achievement. While I'm here: "Hadn't of" and "could of" aren't correct. the 'of' is the wrong way to spell 've as in "would of" --&gt; "Would've". In the "hadn't of" case you can just drop it.

---
I think he means "only" in the sense of that is his only 99, and all other skills are not at 99
---
Its easily worth it if you boss or do raids.
---
Then it would be inconsistent with other spells, whose color is clearly distinguished by which runes are used. 
---
If you are planning on grinding Crafting and CON, then I'd suggest also considering buy some prayer levels depending on if you have enough for rigour and augery. Look into diaries as well. You could set up for bursting if you want to speed up mage training.
---
No such thing as an "OSRS account" or an "RS3 account", it's just a runescape account.

Usernames are universal between both games.

The username for your account will be the same on RS3 as it is on OSRS.

Oh I was under the impression that it worked similarly to the bgs. I need to be learned on some osrs I guess
---
I'd get either Armadyl armor or a lance if it drops below 100m. Both are useful in their own way. More leaning toward a lance for KBD grinding.
---
If you ignore bots you can find lots of #names in your ignore list where they've been deleted.
---
Why KBD specifically? I feel as though lance is very situational. 
---
That's why he posted it
---
Or maybe they could make successfully casting a spell yield much more xp than failing to cast one, instead of waiting and getting crap xp people might pay slightly more attention to get more.

Does the amount of free spaces in your inventory affect your herb farming yield???

I feel like it I only have 8 free spaces a herb run I get less yield than if i have 16 free.

There are more serene like redditors, like that iknowhatudidlastsummer

This could be an issue for pages like the guthix set, making it really cheap to get the best XP rates (since they stack). You could turn in 13m XP in just one inventory and only spend, like, 12m-15m. Although it could raise the price of the pages. So idk if it'd be a good or bad thing

You can pretty easily compare value when swap rates have been established over a long period.

The way most people pronounce "should've" is "should-uv," which is pronounced the same as "should of". So people who aren't thinking about grammar, are typing quickly, or who just don't know any better might end up typing "should of" without thinking. I'd wager that people who pronounce it "should-av" are more likely to correctly type "should have" when not using the contraction, since that makes it more obvious what words "should've" is a contraction of.

my two work buddies were both around 80 cmb and didnt understand the importance of a firecape. I told them id give the first person to complete fight caves a whip so that served as their motivation. Sometimes it take an outside source for the motivation lol

Yeah I agree but people would be pissed if it was an iron handicap and no one else got the benefits. Like completion is who wanna fill their log. It would have a zero percent chance to pass then I would imagine.

If you can try to do fairy tail part 1 to get almost 19 farming. Then try farming yanillian hops. One run you can make 50k to 75k if you use ultra compost. And you can do a run every hour.

I usually go for 10 hp levels over combat level when pk ready. But i mainly pk deep/multi. Not the end of the world if your hp is same as your combat, just make sure your stats are maxed out for your level. 
---
I agree with you that there are too many bots, because that is actually the cause of the problem. Because there are so many bots, people go over the top with it and accuse everyone who doesn't talk to them of botting. As a level 3, even with a skillcape on and non-standard clothes, I get accused of botting with regularity. People are just insane about botting.
---
You definitely could at one point in time. Early in the game. 
---
I agree yet jagex and this sub gives no fucks about our best game promotion via tournaments, youtubers and streamers 
---
Oh i get it
---
First thing i grinded for and got em around low 60 cmb, 100% worth it, even if people argue the stats aren't that much better than combat bracelet, the quests you do working towards getting r4d done are really nice to have. So it's not really just the gloves being first priority it's getting essential/qol quests done with barrows gloves at the end.

I’d say I’d agree to an extent. I definitely wouldn’t want them to pull resources away from more crucial projects, but based on ash’s dialogue it seems like something they could do relatively easily. But that’s why I want the mods to discuss it to see if it’d be an easy fix or not. Fashionscape is a growing part of the game so I wouldn’t necessarily say it’d be a waste of time imo

I think you sure as heck can with context. The only time jackpot stuff happens is really with UIM or when you're near the path people take to the Wilderness Altar. If you're above 30 wilderness and to the left of mage arena I'd let it pass because of the good odds of training prayer.

Naked. Near wildy altar. Best case: bones for days.

Pvp polls won't pass because jagex has flooded the wildy with too much content already. It's a pain in the ass needing to go there for d pick, clues, getting gwd keys, kbd, black chins and sallys, chaos altar, ring of wealth recharging, revenants, and I'm sure there's more I missed. 
---
If pkers would kill eachother instead of harassing those of us forced to go there by lousy requirements, maybe people wouldn't vote against pvp updates. Some shit like clues and chins they do it literally to be assholes.
---
It doesn't really work tho cause it's obviously not actually from jagex haha

The boss is not as good as normal Smoke Demons, so it's not nearly as busy. But it's also one of the bosses that people will often make quick bank trips every few kills, and can easily be crashed in that time. It can be quite annoying.

Probably, your hardest fight would be vorkath and not galvek. This is because I'm assuming with 96 combat and those stats you have good melee levels which will make the first boss easy. For Galvek you def just needs to be good enough to not get obliterated as well as your HP. Range doesn't matter much for Galvek cause you just go at him with a crossbow and Ruby bolt (e). With those bolts, regardless of your ranged level you will occasionally shoot him for 100 damage when the special effect procs. However your low ranged level does mean you might not do much damage outside of those specials which means the fight will be very long and rng dependent (you need more than an average amount of special effect procs probably to kill him before you run out of food).
---
Now vorkath would be the real challenge for you. He does depend a lot on your ranged level cause you can't cheese him with ruby bolts. However his mechanics are very simple and you can avoid most damage on his fight, so even if it takes you a long time to kill him I'm sure it's possible. However, it'd definitely be agitating.
---
Other than those mechanical things an obvious decider for you would be gear. I had a 21m cashstack going into this as well as a blowpipe already on the side. So I just dumped my money into karils, a dragon crossbow, and a dragonfire shield. With all of that, it was a breeze (DCB for Galvek, blowpipe for Vork). If you use black d'hide with blessed coif and boots with a RCB and Ruby bolt (e)'s as well as an anti-dragonfire shield for Galvek I'm sure you could still do it. However, it'll probably just be even more rng based is all. The real challenge if you skimp on gear would be vorkath since once again you can't cheese him and your stats are low. For Vorkath I'd definitely want a blowpipe. I never tried it with a RCB though so you can make your way to that point in the quest at least and give it a shot if you're on a budget with diamond bolt (e). 
---
Username checks out... I guess?

It is a great change of pace but it runs at less than half efficiency unfortunately because of the power of cannons. It was a great step though

No I didn't even enter a website and am pretty sure I didn't download anything.  
---
I will change my passwords though, thanks for the advice :) 
---
Jakeyosauras' vid? If so his miscalcd it be meant 277k not 2.7m
---
Ouch. But that ruins the whole nostalgia feeling of these types of photographs. Takes me back to the 00' days.
---
I like it.
---
mazeltov!
---
Oh yeah that was the one, that explains why it seemed so massively high, thanks for the clarification!
---
Omg Woox is quitting?!?!
---
Barrow’s chests it’s pretty unlucky bc getting an item is like 1/17
---
I think I have found the issue guys. I purchased this account from Player Auctions about a month and half ago and I think the seller has recovered it. I emailed Jagex Support and hopefully they will get it all sorted out. If anyone has any other suggestions please send them my way.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.  
---
Head-canon is best canon.  You do you bro
---
Right click, commune Ava's.
---
Problem solved.
---
Yes please

True he probably has all the sets but the gloves

nice pheonix pet sink

Are you a female?

Youtube runescape content is 99% terrible but this series is amazing
---
OSRS is CPU orientated, so generally its quite a struggle to get high fps. If you use runelite enable the gpu setting and that can help.
---
Support!
---
Maybe it's to balance it a bit more?
---
What are your thoughts about the thammarons sceptre being near useless compared to the other rev weapons 
---
Congratulations, I don't think I've been this confused by a post on this sub in weeks. Hat off to you
---
As others have said, make sure you have authenticator set up. Put one on your email address to if you really wanna be super safe.
---
R/murderedbywords
---
That's an awful idea as described. Cw will die if first time players lose then have to grind out another chance to lose
---
Thank you!
---
Not nearly as bad as that but I’ve got a 5x green dragon task and I’m level 72. Ultimate Iron Man with full Addy and a rune scim. This is trash. 
---
They literally polled this already and the community voted no to hiding the results. Perhaps nicely asking for a repoll while putting the pitchforks down would work better than everyone mindlessly attacking Jagex for something the COMMUNITY already voted for.

Beat you too it, friendo.

?????

Top Quality GIF right here!
---
Why does everyone want poll results hidden?
---
1. I bought the account
---
2. I believe the seller has recovered
---
3. I'm asking all you wonderful people for help &lt;3
---
Thank you...
---
It would also be nice if you could have leprechauns note compost rather than making 20 trips to sell them 
---
lmao that's too OP. Getting attacked? Just tele them to Falador and hooray Pking is ruined!
---
Why repost when you can post even more high quality OC?
---
Basically how I get my questing done. I make a list and blow through as many as I can before I get annoyed and do something else.
---
Just bite the bullet &amp; do nature spirit then fairy tale so that you can access fairy rings. 
---
One of mine was from 2006 and I decided at random typing out "SE}{ POWAAAA!!!!1" in what I assume was edgeville at the time was a good idea.
---
I was a very stupid child.

Must not have ever chinned/barraged in mm2 caves...

I wasnt even aware that town existed, but just on that quest name alone I'm suddenly pro-Slepe.

How IS runecrafting nats on mobile, I'm curious if it's doable? 
---
Either this or 20k xp/hr 
---
Im down either way. Superb idea.

Current games is way different than Vanilla. Everything has been made easier from when it was released. Group ironman will probably come when new skills don't pass polls and everyone is 2200 total and bored. 
---
Get a life faggot
---
Nope only me.
---
Yeah I already contacted them, to which they have yet to reply
---
They aren't taking long to do anything. The community already voted to not hide them a while ago. Ask for a repoll maybe, but blaming Jagex for something the community decided is asinine and probably contributing to the reason they haven't addressed it.
---
Thoughts on a new Lunar spell caalled "Skiller Kit" similar to "Hunter Kit", could provide basic skilling equipment such as bronze axe,bronze pickaxe,tinderbox,lockpick,rod,harpoon?
---
so stuff thats entirely unimportant anyway
---
Sounds like you don't know what sunk cost fallacy is or your reasoning for watching him is incorrect. 
---
I think a restricted world that costs 100k to enter (or however much the community thinks is good) which lets you customize your account, have whatever gear you want and so on would be great. You pay 100k, you get to try out an account that you might think is fun, and you might make a new account because of it.
---
Pros- the barrier of entry to PvP would be massively reduced
---
-it’s more relaxed as it’s 100k to enter and you get a 6 hour session to fuck around with different builds
---
-people would find pking more fun once they’re good, and make news accounts and hopefully rejuvenate the pking scene
---
Cons- no actual loot so efficiency nerds might get mad
---
-everyone would be able to practice OP combos before they go into the real game, eliminating risk.
---
-no yellow text black background.
---
I like his kit, wtf is up with that decal though
---
Updoots to the left.
---
I'm comparing his popularity here to the popularity of other things on Reddit. It's a much smaller scale in this sub, but the pattern remains. Since he is popular his likeness is milked for karma. 
---
There are genuine posts about his content but this sub recently became inundated with low effort karma grabs like this post. Fortunately it's a meta meme and can be appreciated by both settled enthusiasts and folks frustrated with the low effort content his series has brought to the sub. 
---
Just like any popular anything on Reddit. GoT, Witcher, and Westworld were honestly pulled out of my ass and I can definitely see how it looks like I compared them to Settled! 
---
What in the hell is up with your font rendering
---
Oh man, even you’ve got higher smithing than me, I’ve gotta work on that 
---
What 
---
Just started playing and I'm combat 90 with a bank of 15 mil, while you have 144mil in drops.
---
flair checks out.
---
Not to take away from the achievement that is maxing a UIM, but lowlander tanked bosses on his main account for his UIM... then complained about hidey holes/zulrah storage devaluing UIM. Kinda hypocritical and shady.
---
Also pretty sure he was the first HCIM to get a sigil and pretty much did shady shit again by speccin Corp on an alt before it was patched..
---
Well how often do you repot? If u let ur str and atk drop down 3-4 levels like i do before repotting and it gives a max hit for any of those levels, its worth it
---
If your account is that jacked, yeah.
---
What stats do I need for that?
---
This exact same thing happened to me too!
---
The one I got looked way more real but defiantly fake and in the junk box lol 
---
This has been brought up several times. The "solution" mentioned was a Sandstorm lunar spell that fills all empty buckets with sand.
---
No poll as of yet, however. 
---
You missed the point of the post it seems
---

I got hacked lost 200m bank all my untradeables and they lvl my def

Most bosses and almost all endgame content does not have pure melee involved, so most of the time Barrows is still better to take.  The only pure melee bosses I can think of would be K'ril, Graardor, Cerberus, and some wildy bosses (can all be ranged or meleed, depending on setup, but none of them involve switches). 
---
Almost the entire rest of endgame content is either exclusively range (Vorkath, Hydra) or involve all members of the party switching combat styles (Sire, all of TOB and COX, etc).
---

I dont need fairy rings all i do is pk and afk cerebus on my main
---
Cheers, I'll drink to that bro
---
I made an account again and started playing because of mobile, now I play more on the PC again thanks to Runelite but am still super thankful i can play on the go randomly. Love that it works so fucking smoothly on mobile too, 50fps no dips like ever so far just going around doing stuffs. Only like 600 total skill atm so not very high but still much enjoyment
---
Where do you live?
---
We do
---
Nah, I got a list of goals to follow post max not worried at all 
---
I feel ya. I attempted my 5th try and failed with the same stats as you. Since then I’ve trained my ranged exclusively and it’s now lvl 76. I still can’t afford a BP though so I’m waiting to buy that before I get back to Jad. 
---
Also, turn off Public when you’re pvming. I turn it off because there’s bound to be someone giving me crap for wearing an Ardy cloak at my level.
---
To add, how is emptying pouches on mobile? That seems like it'd be the worst part.
---
Are you trying to cancel the one month you paid for or stop it from making future payments?
---
He told him that mithril is blue instead of purple. Cough virtoso cough
---
B8
---
Why do we need pill results hidden? 
---
Yeah i used to just run across to the other side to be safe. Itll come with repetition, and also challenging yourself in small consistent ways.
---
You dont gain xp while running for someone else.
---
Tithe farm is an abomination. They sound make it an actual farming minigame, not whatever this current thing is.
---
Although I agree this is insane, please note this is not possible without having first 98+ on a skill. If huge lamps are used on a brand new level 1 skill, you'd get 5 xp as opposed to 3.4k xp drops this player is getting.
---
In other words, yes, it is insane and should not happen but for this you need the hefty pre-requisite of a 98+ skill to get these xp drops.
---
You just chat in and get it refunded lol
---
Should HAVE*
---
There’s a clan chat to find people you know? ‘Osrs Soa’
---
stop it from making future payments
---
For input on the rest of you post. Construction. I never knew how amazing it was to have a max house before I had it for myself.  I regretted waiting as long as I did. 
---
I got used to it pretty quickly tbh, I tried initially to change to one click right click but that just slowed down everything so much. I really don't have a problem emptying the pouches,  I've already long pressed while they're being crafted!
---
No xp waste 
---
&gt; even if people argue the stats aren't that much better than combat bracelet
---
They are just flat wrong.  Especially when using a D Scimmy, the extra strength bonus compared to Regen Brace can mean *two* extra max hits.  Considering this would mean a hit of, say, 26 increasing to 28, that's actually a very big difference.
---
A whip + fury + d defender with regen brace alone, versus the same setup with barrows gloves is about a 4-5% increase in dps.  Then you add fire cape and berserker (i) and overall you'd be doing about 15-18% more dps with the "harder to obtain" gear. That's huge.

He said money maker, not training method. 
---
Yeah, I was picturing them treating empty vials like cigarette butts
---
Haha I actually found a rune axe head on the ground in lumbridge once . Made my entire week by selling it in the general store for 5k
---
Cool, I'll give it a shot then. Thanks!
---
Oh really? Woops... Thanks for letting me know! 
---
It takes like 20 extra hours of quests to get 175 QP.  Most of us would so much rather watch ~~cooking happen for 12 hours~~ Netflix than ~~do quests for 20 hours~~ take the wrong gear, wrong spellbook, wrong items, fail agility obstacles, and choose the wrong text option.
---
HA 
---
Oooh wilderness patches, good concept
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Non Ironman, should probably upgrade the gear a little or skip the task buddy 
---
Hmmmm.... If you need a desktop to do agility you have some serious issues. There is nothing hard about either of those skills on mobile at all.
---
"Im gonna hyuck you up"
---
you dont gain exp tanning hides, or buying things from shops to sell on the GE but people do that for 300-1m an hour anyways
---
Did my first bursting task ever last week and did the exact same thing. 
---
Because you dont gain xp while running for someone else.
---
All personal preference I block all dragons and spiritual creatures personally and sometimes black demons
---
I don't care about the xp. I just don't want to spend hours walking back and forth for a skill. It's so tedious and annoying. I want other training methods. 
---
Wym you can't wear them? They don't have a req to wear aside from the quest
---
Good to see more uim in the game :)
---
There’s only 1 reason to do this. Your only plan on your account is to pk. Otherwise it’s just stupid to do.  
---
Also, if you account that you only plan to pk on has 80 prayer then lul. 
---
Nice
