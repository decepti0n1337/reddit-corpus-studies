Lmao look at this rich spoiled brat with TWO pillows. Fuck me.

Yep there really is only one other reason, weapon poison.

From what I gather, the RDT only gives gems in F2P. And, if I'm not mistaken, it would have dropped 67 nature runes instead of 3.

Mine gems at al karid mine for sapphire, emerald and ruby. Free craft xp. And at 50 mining it gets pretty quick. Make sure to buy a gem bag for 2k dg tokens first. Ring of dueling to bank :)

???? you know with these bots grinding becomes harder, because GP will be less valuable, resulting in higher priced gear?

I have more fun actually playing the game.

I think it's time to make the tough decision and remove emblems.. or maybe bring bk bh mountain maybe that could help

I don't, because I value long trips over crazy DPS. If I don't pray boosting prayers I can stay there forever. If I do, I'm capped around 30 kills.

If you're looking at getting a PC and you aren't planning on gaming other than Runescape, do yourself a favour and look for a used one. You can probably get something for like $100, and if you need to upgrade the RAM or something for cheap.

Dang, i whooshed myself.
---
Are they against using a mouse with additional buttons as well? 
---
They've made camera movement controlled on the mouse now, so the (more casual aspect of) the game is almost entirely playable with just the mouse. So I bind Shift to one of my additional mouse buttons, and now I can play without using the keyboard.
---
not at 120 but I'd say 99 is fair
---
if you already enjoy hydra, I advise you to start doing Raids, that's like 100x more engaging and fun than slayer bosses.

Agreed, the count is still throwing me off between the specials, especially the lightning one haha. But the money has been decent and I'm still hitting three per run. I'm hoping with time I can manage to do more per run.
---
Yeah, I start in the corner and then run toward the green pool. Can I actually dodge it on reaction? Doesn't seem like I have enough time.
---
Went looking for this exact information the other day and couldn't correctly Google search for it. Thanks

And the RoT bots come out to play

Noted
---
Wiki says it's upgraded by killing target which I thought were random. How does he get targets just among the bots that are in that spot?
---
WITH NO FUCKING AGILITY REQUIREMENT
---
I hate them too, and agree: if they were polled today, they'd be shouted down in a chorus of "EASYSCAPE!"
---
No
---
Gotta love that "added" then never spoken to again
---
Fuck
---
I will!
---
At this point there has gotta be some sort of corruption going on, how does the same bot farm still exist months later? "same names", Jagex don't even care about their public image anymore, $$$$.
---
Agility shorcuts behind diaries is fucking retarded.
---
"Any rare drops?" Usually gets a rise

Lol - google it gdi

What’s the significance of 77 rc despite crafting bloods? I see 77 rc posts and whatnot all the time.
---
I have seen some arguments before that they might not be technically breaking the rules. If this is the case, then just make a rule specifically against this, give them a week or two grace period, *then* ban them. They’re clearly not playing BH as intended, and if this guy is able to make 500m per day, this is waaaaaay too powerful as a moneymaker.
---
Also if he’s making 500m per day he’s almost definitely rwting it, since max gear is only what, like 4b?
---
I'm gonna guess 3
---
Dude, you realize giving money to noobs actually ruins the game for them? Giving 100k to a noob doesn't do much damage, but giving anything over 500k to one player just destroys their progressive satisfaction through gameplay. The game is most fun when you have the least amount of money and gaining money is only satisfying when you earn it yourself. Hence, the popularity of ironman mode. 
---
If you wanted to help players, you would offer quest advice, help complete diary tasks, minigames, godwars dungeon, etc. What you're doing has scumbag written all over it. 
---
And yes, I would expect a scammer to make a reddit post telling people to give him money. That's exactly what I would expect, lol.
---
i mean you could but its only temporary.
---
try it on your own account.
---
I appreciate that feedback thank you
---
This isn't rs3, 99 is the highest level you can get. Unless you play rank S you're not level 99 js bb
---
Tryna learn man, not just trying to be a dick/stick in the mud!
---
If someone shows me something that contradicts what a believe, and I can’t even consider it, how strong am I actually in my belief?
---
They probably auto skip if they get a target that isn't one of their accounts.
---
I can't carry 28 loafs of bread and certainly won't be able to carry 28 in a single bag, let alone 420. So what's your point?
---
You should skill a lil.
---
but they *could* have something.
---
not like it takes long to find out.
---
I don't yet have the stats for raids efficiently, nor do I have a dedicated team to carry a zerker... but I hope to do them soon.
---
Username checks out
---
Jagex got cash from a bond that could have gone to any other player, legitimate or bot notwithstanding
---
they are same combat level so its almost a given they get eachother +they skip if they dont

“Sorry didn’t see you here”
---
Shit I'm down man
---
I have three accounts and I typically play two at once but I’ll sometimes play all three, very rarely.
---
I have a maxed main, a near-maxed Zerker, and an upstart UIM.
---
I’ll typically do something afk on one and something less afk on another. Example:
---
Afk Hellhounds task on the Zerker, go Corp on my main. Or woodcut on my UIM while duoing DKs with myself on my main and the Zerker, a rare case of me playing three accounts at once. Typically I play two at once and also have YouTube or Twitch so I’m also watching something in the background as well.
---
I lied, you go on the east side and do 2 lines and finish your inventory 2 tiles away from the bank clerks.
---
What I did: 
---
barrows first to get enough GP for standard gear... 
---
Join a a good clan and build a good reputation
---
Do dragon slayer 2
---
Borrow dragon hunter cross bow from your clan mates with your trusted reputation
---
2m+ per hour killing vork
---
Now my bank is over 200M and I’ve done over 100 raids
---
Laughable
---
Either you enjoy the game or you don't. If you don't enjoy the game, don't play it. What kind advice do you expect anyone here to give you? Do you want a link to a bot program so you don't have to train smithing? Are you seeing to buy an account?
---
I usually get "What are you alching?" And I have to wiki the drop table to i don't have to admit that I iust stupidly alched a steel battleaxe for a net loss
---
True. Cayman and 911, both on steroids.
---
This shit right here. Slayer=best skill
---
Lay off the drugs idiot.
---
I gave you my advice dude. If you don’t enjoy long-hour grinds, or can’t get motivated to complete them, this isn’t the game for you. Sure raids and bossing can be super fun, but that stuff will still become a ‘grind’ after a while, or a lot of KC. The game is a grind from start to finish with little active bits laced in like quests and stuff, and if you don’t find setting goals and grinding for them, and you still want to play rs, pking is really the only option and even then you’ll still have to grind many hours to train the account to get it ready. It’s not that expensive to make a msb/gmaul pure, so that could be an option if you’re interested, will get stale quickly though as it’s basically F2P pking with a spec bar and an OP spec weapon.
---
was it as fucking awful as infinity war?
---
It should work, but wouldn't a mouse be more precise? That's just me though lol
---
Not him but redwoods, monkfish, karambwan, eels, amethyst, zeah rc, some slayer tasks with proselyte, Barb, etc all good.
---
What's with all the salty comments lol
---
That... Would make more sense actually.
---
Yeah I don't think so
---
Wrong.
---
support, i remember with resting how sometimes it was nice to just sit down
---
Thank you so much. I’ll keep you updated on my attempts lmao.
---
you will die. don't bother.
---
93 range I believe. You think so? I wouldn’t have to worry about the healers? 
---
I’ve got around 40-50m cash
---
Are you suggesting that a bot made by some guy somewhere is about as trust-worthy as the game developers (whom don't have any vested interest or reward in gaining GP...) 
---
Jagex tax all stakes so they win in any case and have removed trillions of GP since that update anyway.
---
I think the argument is that it's implied scamming based off of greed. You see someone rich asking for a bit of gp, you think he will give you tassies or something if you trade him the 50k and he just ignores you after or hops.
---
It's the fault of the person who traded him thinking they'd get something in return for sure. Just explaining the logic behind the report (I agree with just mute and move on, though).
---
HOW DOES THE WATER MAKE IT DRIER???
---
I imagine that you have 1 runecrafting.
---
some dude made a fake music video with the Crab Rave song that made jabs at jagex's recent poor performance and now its a meme
---
Why not just make it so you can't get the same target twice within 6 hours? I cqnt imagine bounty hunter is very fun if you're just killing the same guy repeatedly anyways
---
cant tell if sarcasm or
---
All the time! I'm a firefighter/medic and basically live at the station on call 24 hours at a time. I can only ever do things that i can easily stop at a moment's notice, but this game is pretty great for that.
---
To be honest, no idea ! I once pushed a girl into a lake for the lulz and for total fun, and I went around telling everybody how wet I got her.
---
It takes no time at all to bot 45 cb

If you hang out at ge often you get the pm spam, they don't check if you're an ironman either
---
Gl man, definitely let me know how it goes.
---
NightmareRH on suicide watch.

Any update on if this will be implemented?
---
I did it for the sick boots
---
This meme is actually dumb af but i find it so funny
---
Yeah, I know. That was mostly directed at OP.
---
But I don't even walk through there anymore, I use the diary teleport reroute and the spirit tree. Also would overcrowd the north west hole under the wall or the castle walkway.
---
I do that and still get hit though :(
---
I’m gnot a gnoblin
---
because it's an instanced area, and if you leave loot or dropped items behind you are a sad cookie... so a warning.  Next time tele lol

---
I'm confused by how this worked.
---
Was the tablet to somewhere in the wilderness and you didn't pay attention to the warning it gave?
---
Or did you sell the spade for the tablet?
---
Here we go again
---
Just spreading awareness at how easy it can be to fall for a well known scam. Clearly upset and reddit is the place where i chose to decompress that's all.
---
They could oopsie woopsie a Tbow spawn.  I see absolutely no QA team going through changes with a fine toothed comb.
---
I KNOW ITS ALMOST LIKE EVERY OTHER MMO DOES IT NO PROBLEM
---
Its current special attack isn't bad; it just has a high drain. It is effectively an upgrade Magic Long/Comp Bow spec since it never misses and drains magic. But while those cost 35% spec, Seercull costs 100%. I think it could be lowered to say 55-65% without issue; lower than that could cause some ragging issues in PvP with double spec. Ideally, I'd say make it 35% spec so the Seercull could act as an upgraded Magic Comp Bow for places where you use the spec, which is very few.
---
You the type to lose 10gs in a pyramid scams irl 😂😂😂
---
Oh I'm sorry if the word affected you. I'll try to avoid using it from now on. &lt;3
---
Yes sir pugger found someone to make a hundred bots for a video and then made a video killing them.  you're a genius
---
Correct he spoke for a a min or 2, i had placed the spade and without thinking i never took it off the trade box. There is no warning when both players have an item
---
Fuentes was radicalized by Ben Shapiro
---
Right
---
Q
---
Wasn't this already added? At the very least I remember it being polled and passing during the February qol polls.
---
CannonsI second the Dragon defender and fighter torso. Personally I would shoot for 70 attack for whip without letting strength fall too far behind, this will make getting 70 defense faster for barrows equipment.  
---
 Cannons are most efficient in multi combat areas unless you plan to use a safe spot, and they are very good xp for early range levels. Keep in mind if you aren’t willing to buy prayer pots for tasks that aren’t profitable you probably won’t like the cost of a cannon.

Switch Alexandria for Saitama and you have the ending of ep3
---
Not everyone is an iron.  We can buy staminas.
---
Well yeah but that doesnt help if hes right handed though
---
yeah its worth leaving dhides, it **might** even be worth leaving a set of bones or two but i haven't seen any math on that.
---
Your logic is completely backwards. Botfarms consume bonds. Driving up the demand for bonds and thus increasing their price. Providing an incentive for players to buy them as they'll get more GP for their $.
---
&gt;Bot runners/owners need not factor in, they just keep the cost of bonds down. 
---
Either you're underestimating how many bonds go towards the botfarms or you're just an idiot and have no idea how economics work. But the absolutely last thing they are doing is driving the prices down lmao jesus christ
---
I always do 5 kill trips and never run out of space. Vorkath drops 2 bones and 2 other items usually so that's 20/28 spaces. No need to pick up the d'hides at all unless you're using blowpipe and run out of food.
---
D'hides are like what, 2k each? One more kill of vorkath is 100-150k. So you can pick up the d'hides for an extra 2k per kill or just leave them, kill another vorkath for 150k.
---
True genius.
---
what is
---
Rest spell?
---
Who ever coded that drop for those chances must have been high
---
Saradomin brews can't melt obby mauls.
---
at cb 45 you are now exposed to 10 hp teleblockers, which can effectively shut down an emblem farm with 1 person with a free afternoon.
---
This suggestion has been made pretty much since Zul was released. Its the reasoning given by Jagex however many years ago.
---
Ethically, you're choosing the value of money over integrity. That's fine, but when the value you're saving is next to nothing in the grand scheme of things and you're still foregoing integrity it shows that you are severely lacking funds.
---
There is no reason someone should support gold sellers, unless they have very little money of their own.
---
Or, if you truly want to save cents at the cost of integrity then that speaks volumes about your character.
---
Either way, you're poor or an unethical person 🤷♂️
---
Take up anime and become a filthy weeb like some of us
---
Remove niche of slayer staff on maulers and replace with the more easily obtainable rune warhammer?
---
That makes sense how?
---
Yes.
---
what did they do? i don't play or keep up with rs3.
---
combat is always nice to have high but work on some other skills, questing will get most of them up without ever having to train. itll open up more content and useful items/prayers/slayer monster etc.
---
You have your own room?
---
Nope!
---
Glad to hear!
---
Look at Mr.athiest here's with his masters degree in quantum physics.
---
looks like an inferno adz lol
---
Yeah but the veins are based on a timer so less click-intensive and you don't fight for spots. You'll get nuggets back in no time.
---
i wish they'd nerf it even further by making the tab delay 5-10 seconds longer. as it currently stands, all a rusher needs to do is blitz/barrage, run in and spec, and then immediately step away and wait like 2 seconds and they are home free
---
this actually is a good point. thammarons is a SUPER rare drop but it's good for literally nothing in the game except maybe crazy archaeologist. and even then, if you have the gp to use this damn thing, you must have better things to do than archaeologist
---
nobody does that
---
Upvote for last sentence
---
You don’t need to a programming language to know that that doesn’t make any sense. Changing the color of an object should literally mean you go in and change the color value, not create a unique item that has the same properties as the original but takes up even more space.
---
4 unique POG
---
That is not what every world-first player I have ever talked with has said, but, I'll take your word for it instead of theirs I guess
---
its rarer on the other revenant monsters
---
Little functionality tbh
---
TIL
---
Thanks
---
It's not much for most but unfortunately it is for some med level accs. I can't go bossing or raid yet or anything of that sort.. it's just the demoralizing aspect as well i trained rc and made 70k natures to make most of my gp (like 16m) and some asshole scams me after all that grind. It's tough, but ty for the encouragement: )
---
A bot farmer fires up his 10 bots to do any sort of f2p gathering (clay, shop buying, static spawns, etc.) untill the next day. Now all these bots were making around ~150k/hr in f2p. The bot farmer then buys a bond on the GE with the botted gp. Now the bots have membership. 
---
No bot farmer (at least any farmer trying to get gp to rwt) would risk purchasing membership.
---
It for OCD and aesthetics not functionality. HHaha
---
White and born in 95. Should have known noone under 22 plays OSRS

Thanks! Added (USN: HappyAppa)
---
29 I think.
---
29 and 29.9 are the same thing (game rounds down for max hit), so I would assume the last one you used was rounding up instead
---
just buy the item at the lower price.. itll take time... just like trading lol no one is forcing anyone to buy items at higher prices, if youre patient you can get it at the lower price, but what youre saying sounds just like "me me me now now now!"
---
One time a guy caught me on his way into a dungeon and gave me shit for only having half dragon armor. Said it was disgusting and he couldn't look at it. Dude left and then came back with the missing pieces. Blew me away.
---
I guess you could say I am in love.
---
Lure it on top of vent, stand to the north (?) of it and after the third attack run under /through to the next vent.
---
Been months since I've done hydra so idr the orientation of the room
---
I didn't realize how much I missed team dungeoneering.
---
I'm the original owner, but I was young when I made the account, shared it several times, had the same password on Runescape and other sites, and had a high-profile name for a long period of time that made it a target account. It's entirely my fault, at the end of the day, but I wish Jagex would give me a method of wiping all former information and starting over without having to make a new account.
---
You can use the Runelite loot tracker on the bar to the right to show all your drops as together.
---
I have horrible luck with the nuggets but once I pulled 5 runite ores and felt like a god
---
So I work in international money laundering and it gave me an idea.  Has anyone considered that maybe SirPugger started a bot farm (or had a friend) farm mysterious emblems?  And then this is how he "launders" the gp?
---
??????? That's not relevant at all to Runescape password security. I don't think that term means what you think it means.
---
The problem is gmaul, it has nothing to do with spec tabbing mechanics.  Im sorry but anyone that thinks gmaul is healthy is just flat out wrong.
---
Not everyone is american here with competent tax offices I legit exchanged 7 btc (30k$ at the time cash in hand with a person i met at an anonymous btc atm so we both save 100s on atm fees in my country) the atm gives you any amount of fiat or takes any amount of fiat and coverts it to/from crypto/fiat without requiring ID or any identifying detail
---
How is it hard exactly?
---
OS already has the best aspect about bounty hunter that RS3 took from it - that you can get emblems from monsters in the wilderness.
---
RS3's is that, you can only upgrade emblems in the wilderness while on a slayer task... because the straight forward PKing aspect of rs3 is dead
---
Forcing people into pk brackets to partake in bounty hunter would be the better thing to do here
---
They have feet shoved into their backs. You’d probably be a tad upset too.
---
Because the common people like you still believe that this is important and pressure companies to have these kinds of absurd requirements. When in reality all this does is that people will use their regular password, but with the first letter capitalized, and with 1 added at the end.
---
I always do this because fuck Ironman
---
Whats your bots name so i can report it for botting. SMH
---
I think you might have me confused with Pookaguy - he's the original OneChunkMan. I was inspired by his series to make my own account, except I choose the chunks instead of RNG.
---
Congrats dude! I'm 90 farming hunting the pet, doing seaweeds, mushies, cacti and papayas mostly but I'm hearing all the 60m horror stories of no pet, how likely is it that happens or is it just a bit of confirmation bias cause I'm pretty spooked
---
*cough* jagex we lookin at you *cough*
---
No attack requirements.

Prayer pots are your best bet till 52, then super energy pots. Would cost you around 1.5 mil.

Dude, that's sickle
---
god forbid the devs have to put effort into their game
---
I doubt it's 1 person making 100k accounts in a week and even if it is, it shouldn't be too hard with how much of a throw away all those accounts are. The emails are probably just a spam email that you don't even have to make, the names are the suggested names, etc.
---
By reworking it you mean got rid of BH all together. They adopted wilderness slayer and made it so you get emblems from slaying or pking people on task. I'm not saying its a bad idea but, as a last resort they may want to consider it.
---
The problem with this reasoning is it isn't clear how much the livelihood of pking is contingent on a medium-low level, reliable killing spec weapon such as this.  If you nerf it, you think you make pking healthier, but it's much more likely you 1) cause fights to stagnate into eating wars of attrition, and 2) kill off a significant portion of the community that pks only at a low level.
---
Reminds me of courage the cowardly dog's attic
---
We have all invested to much time to just walk away at this point.
---
Wow Jagex is truly a joke
---
theres a fetish around "blueberry" inflation, just FYI
---
Clicked and was not disappointed
---
10/10
---
What about demonic gorillas and trolls are quick with cannon and don’t lose gp?  Green drags are quick with baby drags. Your slayer block list sucks but if you enjoy the game then go for it!:)
---
That would be 9 quintillion, 223 trillion, 372 billion, 036 million, 854 thousand, 775 hundred and 807. Sorry if I got that wrong, not a native speaker.
---
This is amazing
---
this is how the game was ment to be played
---
It's okay, you learn something new every day.
---
Alch yourself
---
Plot twist, he is a girl
---
I'm dumb and blind, sorry
---
Alkan has received every item from raids except for maul in that kc. This also means that he’s going to do risky PvM.
---
Doing good on mechanics, I heal/ppot during the ice spawn or the acid pools while walking back and fourth. I haven't tried woox walk with dhcb, didn't know it was possible honestly. The guides I saw only covered that with bp.
---
That would be 9 quintillion, 372 quadrillion, 036 billion, 854 million, 775 thousand and 807 hundred. Sorry if I got that wrong, not a native speaker.
---
It's almost like people can choose what to do in this game and efficiency isn't always the main goal.
---
Chaotic Evil plan: wear bandos + prims + whip one day and tell him all about that other guy who gave you these.
---
Did you die
---
Omfg I'd grind the fuck our of zulrah
---
This would be the funniest shit if it was intentional but now I feel sad
---
35-70 with it?  gmaul cant hit 70. you  mean ags?
---
I enjoy barbarian fishing because it's super easy to drop on mobile, it's afk, and it's effective to train three skills at once (although agility and strength are slow, they do add up).
---
Hop loser
---
I tried getting the basics of farming down, but there’s just a lot of info to take in. I’ll probably re visit it when I have nothing else to do. I only have the easy varrock diary completed, so i’ve been getting 20k from the staves but doing the next diaries are definitely on my list.
---
I’ll have to look into miscellania, and i’ll keep up the birdhouses. Thanks!
---
Id be down for level 80 range armor
---
If you see someone coming to kill you it’s part of the method
---
I'm not sure, it all happened so fast. 
---
It could be possible he ags -&gt; gmaul speced lol.
---
If I can find the clip (cause all my deaths are recorded), I will show it to you lol
---
Hill giants on great Kourend are good.
---
What are we even looking at
---
Better to always have a tree to chop instead of all being down, basically.
---
Less afk but more efficient
---
Can't see any error. Take my upvote.
---
Only thing I can think of is that where the special attack of the waves ended where you ran through it, killed you? Since the sound for the wave went off the moment you did.
---
save em, you'll need them for some clues later. One of them is a wildy one but I had to buy these items using chaos runes for mine.
---
Yes it is, there is a safespot where you can kill one dragon with range. Make sure you don't risk too much because sometimes there is the odd pker but you can just teleport if needed.
---
So instead of 500m a day he laundered 9m?
---
I would like to see a global chat message when a HCIM dies
---
Why does he have a verac helm ?
---
Is that verac helm I don’t have 70 defense !
---
This is the stupidest post on the entirety of Reddit today. This is basically the equivalent of someone's kitchen catching on fire and telling them to go to their bedroom and close the door. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't affect you.
---
You’re doing it F2P?  Just reminds me of the YouTuber that made a bot to give out holiday items getting banned.
---
F
---
You're cool, dont tele to GE tomorrow
---
I always thought it was bones, a bit like Rag and Bone Man
---
I wouldn't mind changing this to give them more of a use; it is really hard to balance them around Battleaxes and such, especially since DWH. That said, not sure if I'd want to see too many weapons change from Attack to Strength.
---
Also, it might be worth checking with PvPers, specifically Obby Maulers, more about this. It would probably be fine, but the DWH is the same Strength as Obby Maul while being 1H and a faster speed with a spec... Though I don't expect DWHs to be common in PvP given the cost.
---
Your only option is giant seaweed and sandstone or charter sand if you don't have cash
---
Absolute unit
---
Hehe you knew it was for dt. Is alright I did some bandits... then when to  pyramid plunder. It’s decent xp
---
It’s like the most random building in the game and does nothing so yeah good idea
---
or mor ul rek (he has a fire cape)
---
I agree, also.. You should take up that guy on tripling your gold, he is even kind enough to do it TWICE!
---
No lvl brackets in cwars
---
sounds cool but ***Engine Work*** is about to ruin your whole career
---

---
Well they can kiss my ass with that excuse because new content needs engine work. They can't just re-skin existing assets forever.
---
was that just a graphical glitch or were you really just.. lost?
---
I did birdhouses on mobile till 68ish hunter and started catching red chins on mobile with the tap to touch option on.
---
Draynor manor teletabs put you close to the patch too
---
You would think a person with like 50 bots running at once would be 50x more likely to be detected, but apparently not
---
i kinda agree, its lame that the hydra pet loses its heads when you metamorph it
---
Big support
---
Barbarian fishing only gives strength, agility, and fishing xp I think. No hp or other combats I'm pretty sure
---
Watch KempQ 10hp pure
---
If you are strong enough to quit the game, brother, please tell us how
---
that isnt a good reason in my opinion

Just wanted to clarify for the original guy 👍🏻
---
Are you Ironman? If not flip on he or get another acc not lvl3 to trade
---
Make gold bracelets until you can make emerald rings. Consistent money in f2p because they're used for rings of duelling in p2p. 
---
I tended to just tan hides for a little while to get starter cash so I wasn't back and forth at the GE; you can just pick other peoples up so you don't have go gain combat levels killing the cows yourself.
---
Play on skill total words if you can :) I haven’t met one spammer since playing on these words.
---
Yikes I did that yesterday.
---
Was carrying all my money like an idiot (3m), didnt realize I died till I woke up hours later.
---
If you feel that way at the lower level you will probably feel that way at upper level too, still pretty shit xp rates.
---
Imagine not just doing wines in the myth's guild.

^this

Just saying, it affects gp and xp rates

All jokes aside. This is one the chillest places in the game. Beautiful design.
---
How about just 60 agil
---
I've always just portaled to waterbirth and taken the boat back. I wonder which one is faster...
---
The list is literally endless but I’d put money on instakill or unlimited darts
---
Hey now, that's sad. 
---
I'm a pure and I can't physically get the diary reqs due to the def exp gain :@ 
---
That is mainly the reason why I get mad at shit like the al-kharid shortcut for when I want to go to the shanty pass.
---
There are a TON of videos on YouTube for the exact thing you want to do. Personally I'd say it would depend on what route you would want to take. Whenever I think of ways to make money, I tend to stay away from the ones that don't also give me exp. So I'd suggest things like mining clay and turning it into soft clay to sell on the ge, or smithing ores into bars over something like looting pvp armour, sitting next to a water source and a bank and making soft clay, or tanning d'hide/cow hide into the leather.
---
I love the sense of calm this gives me
---
should have told them that the chest is closer and stubbornly continued to use it
---
Yeah, I figured. Might as well try though.
---
How did you get the engine?
---
Didn't censor 48 agility, rip account.
---
The guy can just have a shower and he'll be all set, the guy isn't gonna die from sitting in a bit of shit. Our boy didn't wanna waste xp, and i respect that
---
easy ardy tasks double the amount of runes fyi.
---
Ehh, I did 1k wines at 35 cooking and that got me to about 70 cooking.  Only "burned" about 300 wines which cost \~100k. 100% would still recommend.
---
Old farming guild teleported you outside
---
no, if it's demonic gorilla it can drop it
---
This^ also it is hard to tell but I think you were only 1 tile away from the fire ball. Which will still hit you just reduced damage.
---
Temple trekking maybe for some dopamine tomes

What's the ingame crab song?

This is the type of rs art that I love. Usually we get bombarded with drawings of people’s in game characters doing some weird shit.

I met him too, I was like how did you do it. And he told me graveyard, so crazy
---
Damn, how did I not think about that.
---
I played this once for a diary and had no idea what to do so i just caught monkeys and released them in the other  players base.
---
Everyone else was also just standing there with 1 girl going around actually playing lol.
---
If I get like 1 more person that wants to play I do more than buckets. I only really play on my ironman though so I can't really do that whole pick flowers and trade thing.
---
Same, how is this even a question lol we are actually 200 iq and everyone else is dumb.
---
This had me absolutely dieing. This has happened all the time playing the game over the past decade. However the last time I was in a slayer dungeon with this other person for over an hour and not saying anything, i decided to say hi. This person and I formed a bond like none other. She is now my best friend and SO, and we turned a long distance thing into the real deal as of recent. Can not express how gratifying it is for the both of us to see a post like this. Its literally how we found eachother.
---
I agree completely ridiculous who's horrible idea was it
---
aight thanks.
---
holy shirt your flair! I thought I had it bad with 0 mutagens at 2k
---
This is what pushes the game to die more than any RS3 similar update
---
I took this as 88/88 is what the white supremicist say because the 8th letter in the alphabet is h so 88 would be HH(heil hitler) and the white thing coming out of the pot are a bunch of shitty kkk members ...

Oh no.

 *’Forgotten but not lost, what is forgotten can be remembered. We should cling to hope, for he could undo us of the shackles that is called max efficiency. We should follow the way he paved, for surely it leads to better times.’*
---
These were the words that were uttered not by a prophet, but by an ordinary man. However normal he was, he held hope as tight as the formidable shackles held him. His hope was not in vain for a controversial legend was being made, and he rose in a time of great need. He is known as John Q Playmyownway. His former identity is unknown, he lost it when he became the embodiment of playing your own way. Which brings us to this day…
---
Past Lumbridge castle, where it all began, over the great fence and in the vast desert they stood. John Q. gripped his magic bow tightly as he studied his foe. A hulking mass of autism and hatred was standing across from where he was. Mister Efficiency looked down towards him, but all John Q. saw were two empty pits staring at him. There was nothing there but a vast emptiness in which he felt trapped for what felt like an eternity. Ordinary weapons could not fell such monstrosity. *What could one do when pitted against such despair?* His descent into the depths of despair was suddenly interrupted by a voice shouting ‘WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!’. The fear in his voice reignited a sliver of hope within John Q. ‘USELESS CRETIN!’. More insults were being hurled towards him, but they could find no purchase. It lended him strength instead; this place is unfitting for the thin-skinned after all!
---
John Q was refilled with purpose and zeal. He cast away his bow for conventional weapons were useless. He knew now that he had to use a rock from these dead and empty sands. He placed a rock in his sling and started swinging it in an arc. This day he would end the tyranny of Mister Efficiency.

It's not that it has high defensive stats; it has pretty high defensive stats, but also +3 prayer bonus. Guthan's/Torag's helms have better defense, but 0 prayer bonus. Same with Verac's skirt, but that has +4 prayer bonus. Dharok's and Torag's legs have better defense, but no prayer bonus. You would theoretically do the same thing for your chest, and go Verac's Brassard, but then you would be losing out on the accumulator's ammo saving effect by using a metal top.
---
Still further as the house portal is pretty far south of Relleka compared to being kicked off

But realistically I get less than 20 kills an hour because I don't find it at all entertaining to grind vork at full efficiency.

Regardless of what you're doing in the game it's the exact same waste of time
---
Is this bait? Or are u an actual brainlet.
---
The idea is that by doing this, even if it has literally no change besides positive for someone that isn't you, you are actively making the game stagnant and less fun for others. Basically, ruining the game for others in the long run, and driving out that part of the community slowly but surely. 
---
PvPers aren't that big of a percentage, you're right, but drive em away and you DO lose an important part of what makes runescape, runescape.
---
Cant be as shocking of a revelation as your Uni-Leg is going to be.

Glad jagex isn’t gonna poll pvp updates anymore.

Nysadia!
---
Yeah, runecrafting,  thanks for the information, i didnt know that, i usally have it on most of the time anyway tho, but other then dense ess i would need it on for the other perks?,
---
Given the number of people I get at black chins, quite a few people still do them
---
oh :,(
---
Cooking fletching smithing which more are easy free skills?
---
Are they different from normal bank tabs? Or do you just get a couple extra tabs
---
When they move all of the clue steps out of the wild I'll agree with you (or some other solution that lets people complete clues without going into the wild).
---
I have no problem with things like the Prayer altar/Black Chins, because there's alternatives to those pieces of content.
---
Just as a note, never personally been killed doing a clue scroll.
---
Until I'm no longer forced into the wild to do the non-PvP content I want to do, I'll just vote no to PvP updates on all of my accounts, lol. :\^)
---
No weapon
---
yeah because that assumption makes any sense
---
Welcome back! I pretty much in the same boat, but have been learning the content that wasn't around when I played (quite a bit has been added) if you have any questions or would like to play together PM on here! (I am a noob only level 50 :c)
---
Stacking range str some how of like 5 different darts?
---
Nsfw tag pls im in public place
---
Fair enough
---
Thanks for the advice :D
---
My friend told me he bought a bond to check if I had any valuable member items lol
---
The people who kill skillers and people who risk "nothing" kill them because often times you can't tell the difference between someone who risks nothing, or people who are risking an inv full of glories, or take off their gear trying to look like they risk nothing.  It takes near 0 effort to find out if they have loot or not, which is to kill them.  The people who kill skillers also do it because there is money to be made.  If you don't want to do activities in the wild, don't do them.  When I don't want to fight in PvP or get killed, I just do shit outside of the wild (which is by far most of the time).
---
As for the "alt right PvP clans" - that has nothing to do with the game and more to do with them being shitty people, which shouldn't influence how you vote on the polls for the game.  That's like voting no on any update because skillers, pvpers, and pvmers will have alt right members seeing as every group has a large amount of players.
---
What’s the Jmod going to say lmao? That they actually were making 500m/day? This is damage control
---
Tbh if a legit player is doing the gambling thing they should still be banned.
---
or when you dc on mobile when your mobile data takes a dip.... vorkath knows!

Maybe vorkath isn't sleeping before you poke him, more like learning how to ddos
---
Appreciate the feedback, based on what your experience was with your setup, I should be more then able to get it done, thank you!
---
From reading your comments, it clearly does if we're talking about your life.
---
Why should it?
---
[deleted]
---
Me too i assumed it was a fish stuck in head first
---
There is way to much content to do a full rewrite lol, if you want that just play RS3.
---
Additionally rewriting things is looked as a last resort solution in the software industry. Rewriting will most likely end up with core mechanics behaving definitely because of interactions between pieces of code within the engine no longer interacting.
---
Oh ok lol, for a minute there thought there was a very considerate hacker in the midst lol. As the other comment stated that I didn't see before barrows isn't the best for you. If you've done nature spirit and have decent prayer I'd recommend running Mort myre fungus. When I run it I use a ring of dueling to go to clan wars for the bank and alter and salve graveyard tabs for quick access to the swamp. I'm slow at it and kinda slack around but still manage about 1m an hourish.
---
Spend a day grinding your range then you MIGHT get lucky enough to get a couple items. But tbh your stats are just too low for it
---
good tip, thanks
---
Wow, going to o far there, don’t you think? I’m going to have a good cry now.
---
He said that you shouldn’t care about small things that you don’t have control over in your life. 
---
You said that being apathetic to things in your life wouldn’t make a great life. 
---
What I’m saying is that those small things above should be such a small part of your life, so being apathetic to just those things has a negligible effect on your life as a whole, almost as if they werent in your life in the first place. 
---
Of course being apathetic to big things in your life makes for a maybe bad life, which is what your comment can imply. But that is not what the comment above was implying.
---
Well shit if you know how to do it and how RuneScape works internally you should totally go work for Jagex and make this for us!
---
Someone attacking me in the wilderness clearly is an even that takes part in my life and you're denying reality if you say otherwise. You reading this comment is a part of your life now. Assuming either is the "whole life" like /u/12345hottakes73 did is just stupid.

I've got 40 defence 60 str and 60 attack. I've quested the 40 defence and i'm currently trying to train the attack and strength at NMZ. i'm using protect from melee and a tonne of prayer potions and overloads but still getting only 30k xp an hour tops. What is the strategy at to increase my xp? Should I be using rock cakes and absorbs?
---
same here...finals in 4 days and still camping the fuck out of vet'ion, got a nice RoTG tho :D
---
Returned to the game after a 2 yr break a month ago. Loving it so far, been slaying a lot and I am starting to get close to 80s in melee/ranged
---
I need some gear upgrade suggestions. For range I currently use god d'hide, book of law (? and rune cbow / blowpipe
---
For melee I have obsidian pl8 and legs, whip, ddefender and a sara sword for str, bring (i)
---
I have 20m to blow, can farm a few m more. I always use slayer helm (i) and fury too, no preference on melee vs ranged
---
Should I go for an acb? Bludgeon? Zenyte jewerly? I am a casual player dont expect to build this sum soon, still waiting for that slayer money..whenever that comes!
---
no but if it was atleast metioned to be a rumor it would make more sence to post it here. if i wanted to i could just copy paste the post. change it abit and i could make it so its about any other game. this is a osrs reddit. but nothing proofs its osrs related outside of the poster saying it is.
---
That's good, I was asking mostly as a comparison to foot pedals. If they allow additional mouse buttons, they shouldn't have a problem with various accessibility tools.

[Pretty sure its not balanced as pkers get to bully the naked wildy boys and there is no pvp polls anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a9q5r2/im_so_sorry/)
---
You understand with that logic it just comes across as you being mad that you can't do anything to retaliate in game so you take it out of the game just to spite that group of players and "show" them? To Jagex it's just going to be an indicator that pvp updates aren't being voted on with the integrity of the game in mind.
---
Control runescape's volume individually through your OS's volume settings.
---
If they had infinite time and manpower, a full rewrite of the game engine would reduce bugs, increase stability and make any additional updates easier to implement, yes. 
---
Seeing as they have neither infinite time nor infinite power, I recognise that they cannot do this and so must try their best to do fixes where they can.
---
That was kinda a thing. Look up potato only HCIM
---
&gt; ofc it's not feasible
---
I'm everywhere
---
Oh that's interesting, I didn't know that it never misses. The problem with quite a few older weapons is the amount of energy drain on the spec, and I agree that changing the drain would probably be the least game changing way to buff it, and see where it goes from there.
---
How do all these ppl text themselves
---
Yep, I dont look at vorkath while killing it because every you need to know about has a unique sound. You can look back when you hear something like a firebomb or prayer removal dragonfire, and anticipate acid/ice.
---
Do all the f2p quests
---
That's actually dissapointing. 
---
At least you get a sexy 99.
---
There are so many people that wear nothing but have risk. Just people need to accept the fact that if you enter a PVP zone voluntarily you can get pked..
---
whether you believe it or not it's up to you, i won't gain anything from spreading lies as simple person compared to commercial broadcasting who actually do get paid based on publicity and ratings.
---
We get massive updates and people still think they don't have the resource to add a new skill. They constantly update the game weekly and communicate with us about why certain things won't be done or will be pushed for a later date. I love the osrs devs
---
lmao dead content nty
---
I'm thinking of building an Obby Mauler, I'm aware of the fact that it should always be melee based so if I'm correct I'll have to get 1/74/1 first, then get 50 mage for Slayer Staff so I'm melee based at all times? Once I go mage based (let's say I get 1/50/1 and then get 50 mage), is it possible for melee to take over again? 
---
Other advice regarding the build of an Obby Mauler would be appreciated aswell!
---
This information might get me hired at this new place opening up. Thank you so much !
---
Nope. Higher attack = less misses.
---
Better equipment = higher attack and strength bonuses, so you get higher boosts for both

Would you like to explain why?
---
That is not*
---
Just minding your own business?
---
Blessed
---
Bp is a fking defender!
---
We do not need a new skill.
---
That wasnt w mistake though. Bonds are only 2 weeks of membership. So that's around $14 per month if you are using bonds.
---
But he’s specifically talking about the magma so this is irrelevant
---
I know it's 1/3277 for any mutagen, but he was specifically talking about magma, which is 1/6554 per kill, which is why I used the numbers that I did.
---
Great, now all we need is a guide on how to get friends play this minigame.
---
Pretty much all "completionists" have just used bond on an alt, ran 100 buckets and then afk'd 20 mins for points.
---
Don't leak his world man, some lifeless dude (probably torvesta) would start camping him now.
---
Holy shit this happened to me yesterday at earth warriors. Except before this the dude was whining like a bitch because no one would go north of the monkey bars.
---
I've seen this a bunch of times of this sub. It has nothing to do with there being to many unique items.  
---
  
---
For anyone curious this is why the blowpipe can't be recolored.  
---
They cant store any more the information on the item without engine work.  
---
Each item only has a 4 bytes that can be used for storing information about the item.  
---
Since the blowpipe needs to be able to hold 16383 (2^14) - 1 darts and scales it needs to use at least 13 bits for each. It also needs to hold the dart type which can be any one of 8 which requires 3 bits.  
---
Now you might say 13 + 13 + 3 = 29 so they should be able to use the last 3 bits for color right? Well I assume they can only partition into signed integers which would require a sign bit for each value giving 14+14+4 = 32 bits or 4 bytes.  
---
Now that last part is just my theory, it could be that they need 3 bits for other information we don't know about.  
---
Either way they don't have any bits left to store information about the item color.
---
Nah Rellekka is a big tune
---
Too bad it was only minor injuries.
---
Is atheist supposed to be some kind of insult? Given the lack of evidence of the existence of a god it seems like not believing in a god is the default state of a human that hasn't been indoctrinated or introduced to the idea of religion.
---
Sort of. Most melee equipment only affects defense. Most of your melee offensive bonuses come from jewelry and weapons.
---
Attack bonus and attack level = accuracy
---
Strength bonus and level = max hit
---
When has jagex ever given us accurate information? Winter 2017
---
How do u click the spawn on mobile?
---
Which is always why it's good to let them know of those options, but it's never okay to ostracize them if they prefer not to use them for whatever reason (although not really in this case obviously. He took it like a champ tho lol)
---
Is this a new update on smash ? Creation mode ?
---
"and yes I have completed rfd"
---
I'm pretty sure they've confirmed it as rulebreaking, as it's rigging a mini-game in your favour.
---
And who wouldn't RWT if they could make about $120k/year from automating a process.
---
Yea, if you dont mind build last nexus portal
---
Req 92 con (84+8)
---
Yknow I can't find anything saying that, I think I just took my friend at his word awhile ago. Made sense at the time because when I heard it they were 37k in the ge.
---
Just gonna use this post to say I got Vorki yesterday after 2717 kc and I'm so happy
---
Omg yes!
---
Your ranged level is too low for barrows.
---
Or you could extend it to a year, at 14 hours per day. Income and social reclusiveness aside this is very much possible.
---
Mostly. However if you want upgraded portal nexus you need 84 plus boost.
---
You cast the spell then attack the spawn, usually its an easy path to predict so you can jam your finger where it is going to be and its usually right.
---
you always lose masters on death dont you?
---
This is less than 100k an hour....
---
That’s sad. I feel like osrs right now isn’t set up to have a long term robust economy
---
It's not a meme, it's real. I got my gloves on 420th chest.
---
This just proves that the people being lured are literal dumbfucks
---
I can buy ur mom though
---
What? He botted and made videos about it for everyone including Jagex to see.
---
NMZ using Chrome Remote Desktop to control your PC through your phone is superior in terms of AFK factor for training melee/ranged/magic. Logout timer is 30 min and you only need to reapply absorption pots to continue to be logged in.
---
I got both ranged and magic up to 90+ in just a few days, and even hit the 6h logout timer a few times since it's so afk.
---
people always hate the free trade removal, but actually those days were epic. The worlds were filled with players, there were no scammers, no goldfarm bots, etc. It was basically sort of ironman mode but you could use the GE :)
---
Not if it's in your 3 protected items.
---
i honestly hate how olm looks... Sad for such a rare pet
---
Lmfao

---
There's nothing wrong with this, it's a wholesome "blonde moment" thing. But if the guy said he liked the little walk for whatever reason and they all started calling him a retard or just wouldn't accept his reply then it would turn into the whole toxic efficiency thing.
---
Fix bird houses 2019!
---
Con training sucks ass. Especially at 90+ when you have nothing new to look forward to because you can boost to unlock everything anyway.

I kept getting killed hunting salamanders on my iron the other day so I told them I vote no on pvp polls and made a strong suggestion they hang themselves with the ropes they'll get from me
---
Dunno, just draynor manor teleport and it's 1 click to the patch
---
Thats ridiculous. Tangleroot is the only pet I want. 95 no tangle!
---
Takes a special type of person to look at an incident that resulted in only minor injuries and think it would be better if both parties had guns
---
Doesn't pull aggro from enemies though
---
this is hugely underwhelming. Good effort though
---
Ya know, you pkers can laugh and say "don't bring your stuff if you don't want to lose it" or whatever all you want, but the fact is that any poll with even the tiniest shred of benefit for pkers will never pass. Which is a little disappointing, 'cause I would've liked to have the ability to resize the spell icons for vorkath or whatever, but hey, I guess that's the way it's gotta be.
---
I thought mass emblem farming was also illegal for legit players?
---
I remember a couple years ago a jmod banning flax bots on stream, and one dude dressed up like a flax bot and started picking and then got banned and made a big deal about it

---
Hey better than nothing but I was wrong on that. Can't find anything supporting the 30k, turns out I key a friend of mine mislead me lol.

---
Then where will i put my dragon knife?
---
You'll get there dude. Took me probably 10 tries because I always panicked on healers. What finally worked for me was running back and forth to line them up then focus solely on jad
---
So uh....how?
---
It's upto you really, if you're strictly sticking to edge/ge fights then cannoning it will be worthwhile, however if you're going to be going deep wilderness ect I'd prefer to have the extra gp.
---
Interesting thought. I guess it all comes down to if the team thinks it's important enough, in terms of community interest and dev time.
---
lava maze emote has 5 items required and i brang lobbies to tank the dragons
---
i usually 3 - 4 item
---
Nice. Wish I'd meet a bronze gold trimmed Chad myself
---
It’s just account security
---
But I think it’s same case as gambling where you can ban them regardless of bot
---
I'd you're wearing nothing it takes even less effort to kill you and won't use any supplies, worth the time imo
---
&gt;sweet extra long vein on the upper
---
You're assuming absolutely not bots get banned with their wealth on the account while it's being run 24/7
---
Also, I don't know if bh boosting is zero requirements, but setting up the accounts definitely has a cost as well, specially if they're all members. One account getting banned with membership before it transfered out the gold is actually a net loss of like 4 mil. And this should be too rare, with the mod's comment that all accounts have been banned in a matter of two days.
---
Do you think this will make pvp more active? Because I don't think you get it
---
Yeah I tested it myself
---
Like always, most us consumers can hope for is report them and hope they get resolved as soon as possible, we can mass report if that's what you want, but don't worry twitch will ban em before we can coordinate an attack. we're shit out of luck here unfortunetely mate, its on twitch mostly
---
\&gt;But  they don't have control though? That is literally the definition of addiction.
---
This isn't a thread about addiction. I don't know why you keep bringing it up.
---
Good, that's what we want
---
Because spamming 4 and 1 is not good content. They need to add the pit, at level one construction all it requires is a spade. You dig a hole and toss money in for construction xp. It's serving the same function as construction and isn't a fucking mess
---
Melee, ranging, magic, it doesnt matter they all take a ton of time to get through that many black demons. And they don't drop anything valuable. You'll walk away with a rune chainbody and a rune med helm, what a crappy reward.
---
Dds rushing doesn't really work nowadays
---
Can’t believe people still post these honestly
---
Had no Ava’s device for the first 13m ranged xp ay lmao
---
Skeletal hands!
---
practice makes perfect
---
It’s a shame Twitch isn’t taking action. 
---
What we, as a community, could do is write and use a script where the phishers get a mass input of fake details so it’s harder for them to know which inputs are succesful results. 
---
But doing this is probably against the law aswel, no?
---
Unfortunately not, even if we all reported them every day and they all got banned every day it's free to make a new twitch account and they just bot it to the views they get anyway so. Not much we can do
---
We hope they get banned is why...
---
Pathetic snitch

You should recreate famous NBA moments in the gnomeball minigame, it would be quite funny and original, and unlike the NBA none of the gnomes are black.

Ignore, be smarter and educate the community. Just like People beging at g.e or spamming "quitting rs giving 10% of what you show" there's nothing more to do then report.
---
Congrats, but was the person able to get a large set at homehardware?
---
Nah
---
He's bullshitting
---
I can't even blame the guy owning this bot farm, even if 500M is a lie if he makes half of that that's some really good profit that can be done on the side of whatever job you have since it's done by a bot.
---
Not sure about you but I'm not willing to risk being attacked by a knife to see if it will result in a minor injury.  If you're coming at me with a knife and I have a gun, you're going to die

If we as a community stopped buying gold these types of scams would stop

Now that I'm trying to complete Falador hard I'm regretting that decision
---
Wowza gz man
---
i dont have that on runelite?
---
99% of the time it isn’t a real player and just a bot farm making more maxed combat accounts. Posting it on Reddit just gives PMod/Jmod a list they can easily ban by name. More evidence=quicker bans
---
&gt; Why then did bond price soar directly correlating to the Venezuelan  blackouts and power rationing? That is a massive bond demand  disappearing overnight. Or maybe its more complicated than that 
---
no it didn't
---
&gt; It isn't just supply demand though, because it isn't a 2 party economic system working in a vacuum 
---
alright you explained it yourself, not to mention bond prices have been steadily increasing since before that incident and continue to increase, clearly that incident had very little affect
---
&gt;Without Jagex revealing actual bond purchases we can't really know. But love how triggered you got.
---
stupid people trigger me yeah also RSBuddy tracks bond trades of people using its client, because of the bond tax to make them tradeable it's safe to assume very few bonds are re-traded. [https://rsbuddy.com/exchange/?id=13190&amp;](https://rsbuddy.com/exchange/?id=13190&amp;)
---
And RSBuddy/Runelite's advertised population numbers are people who have the client loaded not those logged into the game. But a long time ago it was revealed about 55-65% of those are actually logged into the game. You can do the math to figure out how many people are using RSBuddy/Runelite/official client and then extrapolate how many total bonds are traded per day with that.
---
I too wish to die.
---
So for anybody who is interested, I did some math for this post:
---
The total experience needed for 99 is 13.034.431.
---
1 Normal Bone gives 4,5 exp times 3,5 for the altar which equals 15,75 exp per bone. The altar has a 50% chance to not use a bone, which doubles the experience gained in total, equalling 31,50 exp per bone.
---
Same math for big bones, which give 15 base exp, equals 105 exp (15\*3,5\*2) per bone.
---
If we can assume that he fills his inventory with 1/2 normal and 1/2 big bones it would mean an average of 68,25 exp per bone (105+31,50 = 136,50 / 2 = 68,25).
---
If we now divide 13.034.431 by 68,25 it would've taken him about 190.981 bones to reach his goal of 99 prayer.
---
For as long as they get victims, they'll keep doing it. The only way to truly stop it is for everyone to wise up and not fall for the bait. Unfortunately, educating a community this large is impossible...

---
&gt;the more people will be camping wilderness content
---
Currently most pkers are just world hopping certain spots with pures to grief PvMers who are risking the bare minimum right? This is a certain type of person who plays like this, it isn't about efficiency at all. They are making pure accounts to world hop dead content after all. They will increase in number to an extent but not proportionally to those going to try new content, *if it is decent content*. The problem is that its pretty much all localized so world hopping is effective as fuck; pkers poof into existence on top of PvMers and obliterate them while they try to run in the only direction they can so no one bothers. This goes both ways too, PvMers poof out the moment other white dots appear on the map.
---
On the other hand there are areas where the wilderness functions how it is supposed to where players go there for profit knowing pvp is inevitable so they come ready, pkers who want to actually fight go to those places. So while I do agree with you that "content" like black chins or other mindless skilling centric stuff doesn't have any place in the wilderness to begin with, there is some stuff that works.
---
I think that the wilderness can be in a healthy state but certain changes have to be made. The change that would have the most impact imo, but may be controversial is to make the wilderness activities less predictable. For example: Don't have a "black chin spot", have them spawn randomly all over the entire wilderness with a heat map type spawn system so that hunters can have the option to farm a high spawn spot that might be camped but also have the option to farm less efficiently but be much harder to camp. Chins themselves would probably be a complete waste of time with those changes but I was just using them to illustrate what I mean.
---
Well, you replied to my comment about addiction, talking about them being 'in control of the situation' and also brought up crackheads, saying "it's their choice to do drugs, addiction or not".

---
ok jason blaha
---
Cool concept, I'm sure its been thought of but the problem is the amount of dev time to make this into reality.  It's just not reasonable mate
---
Well it’s certainly a good thing that only you will ever have a gun in *THE LAND OF THE FREE*^(TM)
---
Screenshot in your Runelite options.
---
If my research is correct then every 8675 team points the whole team gets the 1%, and then if the team is lucky it decides between the players without rounding. (ie. team gets 86750 pts and a player gets 2000 pts then he has 2000/86750 chance of sniping the drop)
---
I was talking about goldfarmers in general, from the video the guy running the emblem farm didnt seem very smart when he just made his accounts teleport out whenever a specific name is next to them lol.

At first I'd agree with you but then I wonder why he has a bunch of 3a gear and a serp in his bank. Although the serp is uncharged so it might just be a pk loot tab
---
&gt; Can some random person "hack" into your account with authenticators set up on both your rs and email account?
---
Not really, no. Not outside of someone installing keyloggers onto your computer. The term "hack" is often super broadly used, and often includes people just falling for phishing schemes. All the account security in the world can't save you from yourself if you're just going to give away all your account information.
---
I would never say none, there's no such thing as perfect security and you can always get unlucky no matter how careful you are.

TBH, double Seercull specs really wouldn't be too strong; I mean DWH is way stronger and it has 2. The only issue is potential ragging in PvP. But I also wouldn't want to see the Seercull spec disabled in PvP since it is useful in places like Castle Wars... Perhaps 55% would be reasonable? But at the very least, it needs to be less than 100%.

---
Lol jokes on them. I don't even remember my original password.
---
Yes, despite every possible effort, I agree with you on that. I don’t need to do the clues and put myself in the situation. I guess the biggest flaw in my stance on this is assuming someone wouldn’t go out of their way to mess with somebody who is only putting themselves in a situation of being in the wild to just get a thing done and over with. I’m trying to tackle this with the idea that there is some form of mutual understanding but that apparently doesn’t work with people who actually are the stereotype brainlet meme/spade wanting pker. Not every pker is like that, but a good portion are.
---
It's enough for you to sign up to a rs site who's database got leaked (for example, a username you use, an email, maybe a password), and a completely unrelated site who's database got leaked (maybe something with your irl name, an email [not the same from before], from the same ip. 
---
Now they'd have 2 emails, your irl name, an ip from which they can roughly get your location. Then they can start to look for more information about you.

Someone please explain me how people can sustain whatever dead meme for way too long and yet redditors keep getting excited over and over again for the same over used memes? Posts like these getting upvoted and comments against gets downvoted (like my comment is most likely going to).
---
Could be but staking is a thing, I doubt there's many non rwters with this kind of cash but once you get past a certain threshold of gp you never really lose it again, it just becomes easier and easier to make gold due to always having max gear/merching etc. If you've been playing since the beginning of osrs and you're smart then reaching that kind of amount of gold isn't really that ridiculous. There's also macing/skull tricking etc which can bring in a shit load of gold very quickly.
---
Msb to ags to gmaul can hit 147.
---
Stakers still buy things. I'm sure if you could track a single piece of gp you would have some kinda like drugs on dollar bills. Less money for one group still slightly affects the overall game. There's still too much gp.
---
That isn’t a runescape community thing, a lot of people think this way about things in real life as well.
---
Stop making memes of this mans account this guy is a fucking king, nobody on this earth would get 99 range and slay without quests, this guy is goat

He did his first Jad on mobile? That's actually pretty impressive.

This's probably going to get buried, but it was really wholesome and surprising, so I'm sharing it anyways and accepting any karma loss as a Reddit mentioning-being-sorta-trans tax.
---
People tried to hit on me a lot too when I started playing as a kid. I went "haha sorry nty" and zoomed away, because I was 15 and awkward, but it was a trend! My favorite's still the high roller who tried to give me a gold ring and a poem. Good luck in life, you majestic pussy magnet.
---
I acknowledged sometime before drifting back to OSRS that I'm agender/genderless, despite how much I've tried to pretend otherwise. Didn't change my game avatar, or name, so I'm still playing as what looks like a woman. Gotta pick something.
---
But *nobody has treated me like I'm female since I got back.* I'm not even talking about "haha heyy, looking for gf". People literally just react as if I'm neutral, besides the ones that assume that everyone in the room is a dude.

What I'm saying is...the "hey gurl" effect is there, but also vanished in a bizarre, refreshing way that I still can't explain?

It's 2004-level hard, like Legends Quest. The challenge comes from the daunting atmosphere, being far from a bank, and low success agility obstacles, but there isn't actually any difficult combat or tedious to control your character through.

Whos the real dumb ass though, $1/mill lookin head ass
---
lol @ last screenshot
---
"U gotta cut down the wrist right?"
---
I could see that lmao.
---
no its game, but a good one (used to be)
---
It was already evil to take the 2mil.
---
Suddenly all people dying with d armor get to keep the five monkey nuts they forgot to bank
---
Then you need to record a video because you are clearly doing something strange or are lagging or something. This is the easiest part of zuk imo so I really am confused what is happening.
---
I wish there was a betting bot on reddit, so we could bet on if OP rwt'd or is innocent.

One of his clan members leaked his address, the Netherlands is a small country it only take 1 hour to get from point A to B, also it isn't hard to find someone's address here in the Netherlands.

---
1. Wildy circumvents this
---
2. You already have a pin to prevent people from dropping your stuff or trading. It's called a fucking password lmao, it prevents them from even logging in.
---
If you mean taking pictures of your computer screen with a cell phone rather than taking a screen shot then yes. Some people have been doing it ironically. I saw a good one the other day where they took a screenshot on their computer and then took a picture of that screenshot with their phone.
---
480k in supply costs :\^)
---
I quite enjoyed getting 5m Cooking xp in a day with karambwan 1Ticking honestly.
---
Stats where around base 50s with 80s in Melle, not all that  interesting
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
You won't even do any clues for the off chance you get a wild step. Dude you're scared as fuck of the wilderness and trying to hide it. That's irrational.
---
Ya I care and I hope pkers continue to prevent you from completing your clues entitled little rat. :)
---
&gt; if he’s caught selling gold again he won’t be unbanned.
---
If "his" accounts since the "hacker" did it. Not him.
---
Free week trial so you’re not wasting any money
---
And I on the other hand would be glad that that psycho doesn't have a gun himself.
---
If this is truly the case it's hard to feel bad. Seems fishy
---
Yea my mouse clicks are scuffed as fuck. Might try on mobile later. Been hoping to learn more about tick manipulating but can’t really get it down on PC.
---
When you showed your stats, it showed 23 agility. My guess would be that you need an agility req for catching salmon and sturgeon.
---
With that much gp it would be sold for far less than .80/mill
---
ya.... that's . .. .. nvm
---
"This spring, don't miss 'Jmod's gone rogue: 2019' coming to a Reddit sub near you"
---
That sounded so cool in my head :(
---
Read my next comment under you muppet.
---
Problem is, if you have a gun, that psycho probably has a gun too.
---
Yeah I'd probably just delete this my dude.
---
my game is on the left
---
you have a whole thieving skill dont you? get to using it
---
oh what a coincident that 90b was dumped 1-2 weeks ago
---
MVP right here! They're mildly full but it's actually possible to get a world. Just needed to bring more food since reloading takes a hit
---
thats weird i have lvl 63 agility
---
The separate email is because of common database leaks. 
---
If you don’t use the email with anything else but RS then the only way it can be leaked is by yourself or the email company having a breach.
---
You're just nitpicking why they shouldn't.
---
Jagex isn't full of idiots. They know they would have to do their best to verify someone isn't faking a hack. 
---
And to me it's far more important to accidentally give someone double their wealth than it is for an innocent person to lose all their wealth. Similar to why society has innocent until proven guilty. It's more important to not throw innocent people into jail than anything else.
---
And the reason why items are so valuable in this game over others is because of Jagex's policy to never give items back.
---
Not really a gold sink. It's been rwted and is still in the game.  In fact this is worse because it was more of a sink doing nothing on one account.
---
Just replying to say u can add auth instantly and get the 8 bank spaces so that means nothing. But yeah he knew bank pin. Or OP fell for a fake link and submitted bank pin and auth thru email or was ratted.
---
Lol holy shit as if most every major update isn't voted on, the community has a lot of say in how things are molded leading up to release, and even on balancing afterwords.
---
Yet you sit here and act like everything we get is force fed to us and we never asked for it.
---
Take a big step back and evaluate this.
---
is 52 pray zerk still a viable pk build?
---
Easily.
---
At least he would be able to say something because he wouldn't be dead.
---
If you do decide to play and stick around, keep in mind there's a lot of scamming, at Grand Exchange and Twitch streams. Rule of thumb, because the Grand Exchange exist, do not buy or sell by trading other players. Do not search up some random words on YouTube because someone is advertising a giveaway. Do not click any link as they are designed look the official site to steal your credentials. Any streamer mentioning quitting or double xp is boogus and you will get hacked if you try to "sign in".
---
Well, a dark crimson
---
It's also based on how many scales and darts are in it
---
Imagine not having a bank pin with 90B lol. Looking forward to the smackdown
---
A lot of these hackers post the pics in Discords dedicated to this kind of shit, or on Twitter. When it was posted in the Discord the name probably wasn't censored, and whoever sent it to OP censored it.
---
If you're getting 2 kill trips, thats already fine. Even with void and BP, I can't get more than 2 kills a trip.
---
Sorry to hear bud. I think I've seen u at ge a few times. Sick account

How much higher? just for the extra points right?
---
He won't respond and he knows you're 100% correct.
---
Im sure they went 58 miles with a knife and only the best intentions.
---
did u have a bank pin?
---
So serene :) Great job on this.
---
prob be suspicious and seen as rwt.
---
Yes it is.
---
He's going through some personal stuff right now. As he notes in one of the videos, he really isn't interested in making smaller videos, so it takes him a very long time to make the content for his videos, as opposed to someone like Swampletics, who is making far shorter videos with more condensed content. 
---
I honestly don't know if he will come back to it. The concept was certainly very cool but it's going to be even worse at points than it is for Swampletics and I would imagine most people would get burned out pretty quickly doing something like this.
---
In the meantime, there is a similar series where a guy is doing one chunk at a time, but he is actively picking the chunks, so it's a bit less frustrating.
---
Blows my mind why someone would keep all that gold on a single account. You could buy whatever you want with 10% of that amount and keep the other 90 on a secret mule you tell NOBODY about with a 2fa email used specifically and ONLY for that account. Unless you were flaunting it, nobody should have known how rich you were, implying it wasn't another inside job.
---
I was but a humble viewer to this event
---
&gt;I don't do clues (or any wild content) because I don't want to PvP, the difference between clues and everything else is that nothing else requires me to go into the wild.
---
Do you not realise how sad that is? You can't grasp something as simple as point and click pvp on a 15 year old java game, even though you have the advantage in most situations due to not needing magic. (assuming you prepare yourself properly as intended)
---
&gt;PvPers either need to stop killing people for Spades or they need to push for moving clues out of forced PvP locations if they want me/those that think like me to not vote against the things they want.
---
None of that is going to happen, Jagex is starting to realise that spite voting is a problem and I doubt they will make the mistake of ruining the wilderness again just to please some people that barely play the game in the first place.
---
&gt;Clues don't. For as long as PvPers kill people for Spades I'll continue to vote no on all PvP updates with all of my accounts.
---
So why do you have such a big hard on for clues to the extent that you want to drastically change how the wilderness has worked since before you knew what the game was just so you can compete? If you really enjoyed clue scrolls (I do too, despite knowing they're 100% a waste of time) you would spend a few hours learning how to defend yourself.
---
Yea im calling BS on that
---
Referring to your title
---
If I die I lose everything except the 3 “saved on death” items right?
---
Can you elaborate on this? 
---
So every time a flax drop happens that means It could of been a Mutagen?
---
Accurate
---
That iron man who posted a tbow drop and got hacked right after didn't. I'll try to dig up the post when I'm on my pc later.
---
easily. a few B, sure, attainable with standard luck. 90 fucking bill? either got super lucky at sand casinos or dice bots or something
---
I dint know if its an announcement with a title of its own or when it was posted. Trust me I would have found it myself if I knew it was easy.
---
People will go through dumps and find old emails from 15 years ago. They can find ur full name and details from there. They then search for rs related info and try to connect the dots.
---
If you can submit the creation date/isp/creation address along with any other information that only the account creator would know. (‘Recovery questions/payment details’)
---
Could contact Jagex Support on twitter and most likely they can point you towards which recovery forms you would need to fill out. 
---
If you get an automated response (email) from them (aka within like 10 minutes), mention this in a new tweet. It’s a hassle but if you remember everything you should be able to reclaim it.
---
It's not perfect but by god it is pleasing to the eye. No neg comments from me:)
---
Yeh having more points means you will restore more per dose
---
I mean it’s newer so maybe.  Or maybe it’s like all Sherlock’s have the same ID or something
---
I mean, with a physical addiction, you don't have the choice to just not do it, my argument was that drug addicts like crack and smackheads don't really have a choice anymore, their bodies literally start shutting down when they don't take it, hence why opiates are prescribed when someone is trying to get off it.
---
They have the choice to want to stop, they physically can't without serious medical intervention, and even then the best cure for it currently is getting them to take less harmful drugs that feed the same addiction, take heroin addicts that end up having to prescribed methadone for the rest of their lives. Just not taking the drug can literally kill them.
---
With a psychological addiction, trying to stop your addiction can be boiled down to trying to rewire your neuronic pathways, you literally have to change how your brain works to do it.

The only group content besides pvp will be locked behind 60+ hours of combat stat grinding.

This, they don't care about the minority of players with billions on their accounts.
---
I have aound 3.3 billion, good security knowledge, all set up correctly but I still can be hacked, a succesful impersonation trought a recovery request can still skip my email/authy and get access to log in and steal my shit. And what can I do against that? Nothing.
---
I've already made a fake recovery request just to message jagex support via that request at the "commentary" section that this was just for them to read I don't want ever to recover my acc trought their weak arbitrary standards of recovery, what I got.. is they actually recovered the account and I had to change pass after that.
---
LOL so it's not even manually checked
---
Why? you're happy to go and do something like jad/inferno for the first time but you can't handle attrition based pvp which is the easiest form of pvp?

I've quashed the offences on your accounts. You need to immediately change/secure your email account because that's how you're being hijacked repeatedly. If you fail to do so and gold is sold off your accounts again, the offences won't be quashed.

I'm not nitpicking. I'm pointing out a massive problem with your suggestion, which could easily be abused.
---
In real life you don't get given an additional 10 years of life for being proven innocent of a crime with a 10 year jail sentence. If you did, it would be incredibly desirable to be accused of crimes but found innocent. It would be a more optimal strategy than just living your life normally. In the same way, it would be much more profitable to fake hackings and abuse Jagex's item return system (if it existed) than any possible profit you could earn by just playing the game normally
---
The wilderness is still mostly pkers fighting each other. The entire rev caves is multi teams fighting daily to clear each other out. There's like 10 singles team that fight and hunt each other down daily. Unless you're in the clanning scene you won't just randomly run into teams fighting each other. Most of this sub knows nothing about what goes on in the wildy so of course you wouldn't know this.
---
Still, those specific screenshots alone don't prove shit. Nobody knows who or when those were taken. We don't know If they're from discord or Twitter or anything. To the outside observer, those screenshots don't prove anything

Because I don't enjoy PvP, I've only ever enjoyed 'PvP' in 2 games; WvWvW at the start of GW2 as a Mesmer main and Holy Priest in WoW, both had me as a support for people that actually like fighting.
---
I've never enjoyed something like LoL/Fortnite etc either, specifically because of PvP.
---
Worth noting that while the Mage capes/RC Pouches are the same concept, I was okay with them, since it's a 1-time sort of thing.
---
&gt; you're happy to go and do something like jad/inferno for the first time but you can't handle attrition based pvp which is the easiest form of pvp?
---
I am 'happy' to do something like Jad/Inferno for the first time but I don't want to do any PvP, including attrition based PvP, even if it's "the easiest form of PvP".*

Nah. He forgot it is only 50% effective in PvP.

You *probably* won't. There are of course no guarantees, as always.

---
In reality this pin on trading or dropping OP brings up is probably some sort of engine work. Most people that use a bank pin use it to protect their items and simply banking your gear upon logging off seems pretty easy to me and alleviates jagex from spending time to add an additional thing that is just as useful as storing your gear in your bank protected by the bank pin.
---
If you’re truly lazy enough to not be able to hit 2 buttons to deposit everything on you and regear upon login you shouldn’t complain about getting hacked or losing items lmao

wait what

bank pin seems completely useless anyways I've never used one because it's a hassle to type in, and if you get hacked via recover or email or if you are on a 3-7 day hiatus, you're fucked anyways.

That's why I know this is bullshit. Guy with 90B logs out with his bank in his inventory? Not a chance.

I only just came back a week ago. Game motivation comes and goes. Stopped back in November. If you aren't motivated to play, take a break. It kind of sucks when you come back, because you think of all the levels and shit you could've accomplished. But it's a game that's meant to be played for fun. If you aren't having fun, don't play.
---
Exactly, these screenshots don't constitute as proof of anything, I'm invested for the smackdown
---
Twitch can absolutely do something.
---
&gt; But the right constantly covers up the crimes of their cohorts and is actively engaged in actions to delegitimize the press. So I man they are at least attempting to be fascists.

Hi, I have been away from the game for a while and tried to get back on today. Come to find out I have been banned for Macroing (major) resulting in a permanent ban. I have never used any type of bot nor was I even playing at all during the time of the supposed infraction. I have appealed the ban but there was no where to write a narrative about the issue. Is there any way to contact support to give more of the story?

Genie lamping his golf skill to level 30 would be an impossible grind. Need to make some area exceptions for key skills.

I just tested this actually. The authenticator removal request gets sent to the registered email. Meaning they need access to my sign in email, password, my registered email, and my registered email’s password to carry out removing the authenticator. I’m fairly certain my email is close to a 0% chance of getting hacked.

I'm kind of wondering why you're so confused. You don't necessarily just tell your email, but even if you use the same username as your RuneScape display name on forums (lets say, someone Googles your RSN) and on one forum your email happens to be set to display publicly, they have your email, they can search through leaked databases for your details, etc. 
---
You would be surprised how easy it is for leaked details to be found out and to be used against someone.

trust me its very very right leaning. eu and aus people like to meme him tho

Fair enough.  I remeber all the gripe on Obama over literal nothing stories. All the pearl clutching over mustard and tan suits.  What about when there is legitimate news and the right just calls it fake? It's not good when everything negative about someone becomes "fake". Anyone who can't see that it's obviously disengenous is not as smart as they think they are

ohhhhhh got it!!

Thanks for that information.

I'm not mad at people who don't risk, I just think they're missing out on one of the best things rs has to offer which is risk/reward pvp, there's very few games that allow you to take your opponents items via pvp. If we're being honest here, clue scrolls are already risk free and i'm baffled that people still have the gall to complain. The only thing you can realistically complain about as far as clue scrolls are concerned is the fact that your time is wasted when you get attacked, which you obviously don't value very much since you're doing clue scrolls in the first place, I say that as someone who has probably done far more clue scrolls than you and never been close to dying. 
---
You have so many fucking options to avoid dying/losing your clue scroll it's not even funny.
---
How is this not nsfw lol
---
Rank 1*
---
theres really no way to explain this if you still don’t understand. basically just have an account that no one knows the login to, and make sure its an email you have never used for anything else. then you should be okay unless you click a phishing link or get ratted. not really anything else to say about it
---
I don't personally do clues (plenty of more efficient ways to make money), let alone clues in the wild. I'm just arguing the point on principle, and you seem to have missed it.
---
Pk whomever you like, but if your enjoyment of this game is derived from repeatedly killing the same clue hunters for no personal gain other than the satisfaction of inconveniencing them, let's just say I wouldn't think very highly of you as a person in general. 
---
Obviously not every player is the same. But some people get off on causing others harm, on a video game or otherwise.
---
I’m glad you have no power
---
So you can tell your name because problem is on email. Problem is that you share your rsn on some random forums without checking if they cab see your email

Is void only bis after ~92 range?
---
&gt; All I'm arguing is that this whole "no to pvp polls" isn't completely without reason.
---
So what exactly is that "reason" then?
---
PvP is by far the most neglected aspect of the game, if anything needs updates its PvP. 
---
And if you literally do not PvP at all, and dont know the problems in it and therefore have no idea what is good or bad for it then why vote no on something you have no clue about and dont participate in?
---
And by reason, I mean what are the actual VALID reasons to vote no on these things, again if you do not participate or know at all if it will be good or bad for Pvp?
---
Sorry wrong answer, two conversation atm and I thought this was other one
---
Well I mean they could search by full name too, but yeah, generally people re-use their same email address and sometimes even passwords for multiple sites which makes leaked databases even more dangerous.
---
Original rng is back!

I can send you a picture if youd like. You're waaaaaay off base. I may not be the sexiest but no one has ever called my jaw line weak. And I have a full beard. It grows so fast when I was in the Army I had to shave twice a day. Never had to worry about unkempt stubble.
---
If you're looking for instant group activities,  then I suggest WoW. The group activities in osrs aren't doable until you are a medium level, like 85+ combat. Even then it would be a struggle. This game is a big time commitment so it's up to you whether you want to dedicate a lot of time to it.
---
That said I love doing raids, which are end game content. It took me 2.5 years of casual play to get a main account to the point where it could raid.
---
I'm legit thinking of farming easy clue scrolls via Goblins to try to get a couple of these while they're still expensive
---
does it matter?
---
What? Hitting a 70 with dscim and 60 strength? Is this satire that went over my head?
---
Block list. You generally block slow tasks to maximize xp.
---
If you really don't care about that you coukd start extending tasks that you like.
---
I mean its really quite simple 1/6556 is much smaller than 1/24.9. Flax is much more common than mutagen. Yes you need to roll flax to get a mutagen BUT the mutagen has a 20/5264. AFTER you roll flax. So there is no where near the same chance to get flax as mutagen.
---
 When it says "both mutagens are equally likely" it means both the dies have the same chance of dropping not that flax and mutagen have the same drop rate. My point is that you're correct about needing to roll flax to get mutagen but you have a wayyyyy smaller chance to get the mutagen vs the flax. I think that's all this other person is attempting to say.
---
And I still cant do it...
---
weak bait
---
I do the opposite if it's a nech task and i see the little parasites hopping with fire staffs in hand. You bet your ass I'm picking up every single alchable
---
The guys who started on mobile after not playing RS for a while are highly efficient. I have an in game friend who is 1750 total within the span of 4 months maybe, almost all on mobile.
---
So why post on the sub when the wiki tells you how to get or make one
---
Got my clue scrolls from pick-pocketing HAM
---
And there is the reason, if you are smart your risk to getting hacked lowers to below 1 prosent
---
the macro ban appeal is pretty much a "i wasnt using my acc when it got banned" by default. it should be pretty obvious to whoever looks at your appeal if that was actually the case.
---
Shortbows are 2.4s attack speed while Comp bows are 3.0s. Comp bows are very slightly more accurate. Comp bows have an attack range of 10 while shortbows have a range of 7. Shortbows are usually better.
---
Ah yeah, forgot the email notice. Would still be in Jagex best interest to add a 2fa step to website login though. I have my account on a throwaway email so I'm open to that attack vector if I was on anyone's radar, good thing is that my bank is locked down.
---
How quick is that method? You can get them really fast with Goblins but pickpocketing may be easier
---
Alright, thanks man. I’ll stick with the short bows
---
90B with 55 prayer! Hahaha
---
vestiments, ahrims for smoke devils iirc
---
/r/woosh  but not really, haha
---
Do goblins still drop easy clues? I'd have assumed they'd be changed to beginner.
---
Either way ham members are definitely faster
---
Wow that's awful. He could have done better by doing Pest Control repairing walls.
---
Yeah they can drop both, but HAM is probably faster. Guess I got some pickpocketing to do tomorrow!
---
I haven’t actually checked a dps calculator so take the numbers for granted, but I’ve heard tbow against zuk specifically is 34% better than acb. So slayer helm wouldn’t make up for the gap if true, but it shouldn’t be crazy hard if you’ve done it before.
---
You haven't said yet why I cannot tell my name, what they do with my name on game with hundreds of thousands players. Just don't tell your rsn anywhere where someone can see your email and you fine?
---
I mean generally yeah it helps to know security but I mean, if I had billions of GP on RuneScape, I still likely would have been a very big target for Jed. There are no guarantees for security.
---
 That's your right
---
If he knew he would’ve told you stop being a cunt and take the advice.
---
Nice explanation. For the dummies tl:dr version : runescape players are nonsocial virgin neckbeards. Right wing politics attracts nonsocial virgin neckbeards. They encourage each other and they all live in a bubble. Everyone outside is an enemy.
---
PC has a combat level requirement, he can't do that.
---
It won’t me build one without the first. :/ 
---
I’m in building mode as well
---
Thank you sir. I’ll be doing the 1hp method with obsidian. Is it best to use bludgeon with full obsidian?
---
Jmods fck up, which leads to unfair bans. They can fck up again when reviewing a ban..
---
It just keeps happening. People keep screaming "if you do it properly there's no way to get hacked" while completely trusting the security implementations and the word of Jagex. Somehow conveniently ignoring the lack of authenticator delay, passwords not being case sensitive and other bad practices.
---
We'll get another epic Jmod smackdown here - without any proof - just like how when MatK made the legendary "lmao no Jed's not stealing your gold" smackdown (which has been swept under the rug ever since, by the way).
---
Honestly hydra sucks. They definitely silent nerfed this boss shortly after release. I have 1200 kc, no leather or claw. Didn't get my first ring piece til 720kc and still have not finished one. Its so damn boring and is less gp per kill than Zulrah, yet it takes twice the time.
---
Quests, quests and more quests. Get all the required quests done for RFD, hit some more relevant quests to get your QP up to 170 and then finish RFD. Once you did that get your range and prayer up and do fight caves. Get your fire cape and start doing pest control for full elite void. That should pretty much take care of at least the entire summer for you.
---
Will do, thanks so much for the advice!
---
&gt; The economy doing well does not erase the atrocities his administration has and continues to be responsible for.
---
Okay I'll bite
---
Like?
---
Can you explain that better? 
---
Anyone can purchase data base leaked into and just start typing in that email, and pass word they seen you use for other websites.
---
If you are taking about username logins where you don't need emails to log on, you can still log in via email if it's linked.
---
If it's a email that never communicated with anything outside of RuneScape then you could have a rat of some sort, or there is a leak jagex side.
---
Oh good! I'm glad it would've been the outcome regardless.
---
Most claims are suspicious at best.  I firmly believe pretty much only the Jed cases were legitimate.  Otherwise the account owner is almost always at fault.  My point is, everyone here likes to act like the recovery system is a massive vulnerability when overwhelmingly it seems to be these staking addicts just selling their gold.  I mean, why wouldn't they, what are you going to do with 90 bil, just stake more?
---
Nice thank you. Xil ak over bludgeon?
---
i made this :)
---
Stringing amulets is extremely afk and about 120-140k exp/hr
---
Damn. I really hope you get your account back.
---
Upvoted for support or smackdown
---
Thats crazy
---
ayyy, my hero!
---
JaGeX has never been at fault except that one time they were at fault. 
---
Got it.
---
You'd be surprised how much of the newer generations make the same mistake. I'm not sure its intentional or lazy so much as misinformed.
---
Which is why it's a slayer monster - and it probably wouldn't hurt Zulrah gp/h since it is killed as much as it is.
---
That sounds like a trick to me! I'll just vote no on the first one.
---
Yeah I had a feeling you were gonna say nmz. Gonna be honest I hate nmz lol but it definitely seems like the way to go. I haven’t really committed too too much to nmz outside of getting my imbues but I just struggle with the afk time with dharoks. If you’re rock caking down to 1hp you have to click your rapid restore every minute or so. So unless I’m missing something the most afk I’ve been has been inside that minute. Granted I’ve mostly been after the points but now I’m starting to get real with the xp grind. I’ve just come to hate nmz because the way I’ve been doing it has been the complete opposite of afk lol
---
fairy ring
---
&gt;I fucking hate being American.
---
So leave. No ones keeping you here.
---
I was hacked too except my account was cleaned literally today, when I just got on yesterday.
---
Say that one more time and I’m meddling in your elections! Watch your mouth, boy.
---
Its a copypasta from the vanilla wow forums. He replaced ret paladin with osrs
---
Do you use runelite?
---
What else are you going to do if they only respond when you gain enough attention on Reddit? Use your brain.
---
You know what else is in the game? Scamming, gambling, phishing, fake links to instal malware that could steal your identity. 
---
Just because it happens online doesn't make is okay :p
---
Stop acting like anything less than stabbing someone is perfectly fine. You might be okay with rolling over and taking it up the ass, but other people pointing out scamming is a bad thing hardly makes them soft.
---
Also check email, they hacked me through mine.
---
??????
---
Yeah i wanted a clean invy for ess. Hooray for runelite tbh
---
That’s definitely a part of it. I remember pking in the 65 combat bracket and for a while even the d scim and ancients was uncommon.  
---
The introduction of hotkeys changed the game the most, I think.
---
Some dude called me his princess..
---
Crafting your own slayer rings is really nice
---
Probably a combination of all of it. When those that are teaching aren't educated about it you kind of end up with the same wrong result.
---
Yeah you won’t get the boost from the obby set if you don’t use an obby weapon, and the obby sword is the best DPS
---
Part one of the mueller report clearly established that there was an extensive Russian hacking and propaganda campaign benefiting trump
---
&gt; Your account can always be recovered by someone who knows details about you
---
Best account defense is having no friends confirmed.
---
afaik jagex is insolvent and there won't be any more game after next week so no reason to hold a QA stream anymore.
---
The good thing is, the USA have a very strong constitution and legal system which for now keeps things somewhat in check. The past has shown that the president can't do whatever he pleases, there are limits and controls. If your state hadn't grown and been stable for centuries, the risk would be much higher. 
---
Anyway, I wish America would stop breaking and challenging established partnerships with the rest of the world. I don't want to judge in what regards Trump is better or worse for the country than other presidents, but certainly he is making it very difficult for others.
---
&gt;make easily 500m per day
---
theres no way they were making 500m a day lol
---
I don't think overall theres much difference between getting emblem upgrades and loot roles from killing players, you "generate gp out of thin air" from killing monsters too... far far more consistently.
---
the issue is obviously bh alt/bots.
---
&gt;Second, isn't this just encouraging shitty pkers to rag people? People think, "I don't need to risk a lot of valuable items because I'm risking my emblem."
---
the emblem is worth far more than your avg pure set.
---
&gt;If this incentive were removed maybe people would actually be forced to risk decent equipment.
---
like what? in the low and mid brackets there's nothing thats worth the cost to risk.
---
None of anything in this comment thread is advice, and I didn’t ask for advice.   It’s just info thats not related to the simple only question I asked, regarding cannonballs.    So, there’s that.
---
Omg i’m so sad I got killed in the only place in the world where people can attack me, besides that very specific place, the entire game is a safe spot.
---
PKING BAD
---
I was hacked too, only thing I didn't have was two step verification because I don't have a smart phone.
---
130k players by the way (but tens of thousands of bots, easily).
---
I'm just gonna cherry pick one thing out of your bullshit:
---
&gt; Just as an example, the right tends to be for traditional values and therefore opposes non-traditional marriage.
---
Supports president who literally cheated on his wife by paying a porn star.
---
I'm not a Democrat, hell I'm not even American but its so embarrassing to read this shit.
---
i've literally never been lured because im not a dumb fuck but ok lmao.
---
Replace verac top and bottom with proselyte
---
The individual who did it is at fault.  They removed him as soon as they discovered what he did.
---
looks kinda disfunctional to me but if it works for you then power to you bro.
---
sparc mac has over 100b+ from staking.  It happens.
---
cus theyre salty little babies. they have no concept of "gg go next"
---
when you get put in an unwinnable situation in any game, just brush it off and move on. but reddit is for getting very ANGERY at the smallest things. get yourself worked up into a fit cus some guy wasted 45 seconds of your time.
---
Oh yea thats a given. Well put too tbh. But you just see flax and think, just once be a mutagen...
---
Well you decided to not do it, and then still did it because of your addiction, therefore you must be weak according to your logic.
---
Personally I don't struggle with any addictions, so I don't know how I can be 'trying to justify [my] problems'? I just have enough experience with addiction, both personally, and from researching it.
---
I just think you have to be extremely narrow minded (or have some serious projection issues) to dismiss someone's entire life experience and personality and label them as a weak person because they got themselves in a shitty situation.
---
- "But the right constantly covers up the crimes of their cohorts..."
---
This happens exponentially more often on the left than the right. Right now there is undeniable, irrefutable evidence that Hillary Clinton broke the law with her email server. Good people have made honest mistakes with classified information that didn't put our country in any danger that ended up being put in prison for misplacing a single document. Hillary Clinton let thousands of classified documents be emailed to her on a private, unprotected server despite this being totally illegal. This email server was hacked by every big player out there and actually put the US's national security at risk. What she did was thousands of times worse than what good, honest people got sent to prison for and yet she walks free because her last name is "clinton". 
---
- "...actions to delegitimize the press."
---
The press delegitimizes themselves. 4chan has made a sport of making the press say the most absolutely batshit insane things. The fact that the media reported for two years that Trump colluded with Russia and yet the Mueller Report showed absolutely no findings to support that obvious lie should have been a clue. If you believe anything the press says then you're a complete retard.
---
Irl clan wars
---
I understand what you're saying but the stakes are very low on a game, if someone is that invested into RS then thats an issue in itself. This is a game with virtual currency and virtual items, its different than ripping someone off for real money or items and to me thats the difference and why the outcome is so disproportional to the action
---
Yes use the sword over bludgeon. The obsidian armor + berserker necklace gives you bonus damage with obsidian weapons.
---
There’s politics in everything, my man
---
also if you edit the menu entry swapper code, you can get it to work on any pickpocketable NPC
---
Ezscape. warding bad vote no to pvp polls
---
90% of the posts have been smackdowns where the account was RWT or botting though...
---
Well I wouldn't say it that way but... you're pointing in a similar direction.
---
Because you traded on zybez back before the ge which linked ur rsn to ip and maybe also to a different name you go by. Then zybez gets hacked, they find your ip (even just to know your area) then you mention your rsn in a public discord or on reddit and now I have 3 or 4 aliases for you, your locatiom, and your rs account name.
---
Next is just sleuthing enough to find out enough info to put in a recovery request.
---
yeah, you think it had something to do with that?like i would’ve rather then taken all my money then for them to probably advertise websites to get me permanently muted
---
Really helpful thanks...
---
Should have been the giant mole lol
---
"I fucking hate being an American"
---
*literally the next comment*

"I love America kid."

Lmfao shut the fuck up and go watch some more buzzfeed and huffpost. If you were reading "documented evidence" you wouldn't have made your initial asinine comment.
---
Where'd you see it was an ely / it was on runescape? Just curious
---
Fastes moneymaker in the game
---
not even the dad?
---
??? how is climbing over a 6 foot wall in any way comparable to being a master smith?
---
I always thought noodles
---
I like rusty scimitars
---
Could it technically be qol because someone could mistakenly open medium caskets intending to open hard or vice versa.
---
Screenshot from Swampletics ep 2 on YouTube
---
Nah, it's an easy task. Drops are shit if you don't get a whip but getting a whip is nice. Plus there's a chance at an abby dagger.
---
You're not very observant like his whole comment went over your head lol
---
lol oof
---
It really depends heavily on what the application for this gear is. Some places Veracs pieces are more worth than bandos. Sometimes proselyte is going to be better to mitigate protection/piety prayer drain. Of course if money is no object just maximize dps and eat the cost of the ppots. If you focus too much on the pray bonus you'll be spending more time getting kills and end up using a similar amount of pots.
---
Easily you can do it! 60 prayer will help a lot but not necessary. Buy blowpipe and use addy darts. Only hard part is prayer switching at the jad. Best solution don’t panic and you will be fine. Gl
---
Awesome thanks man
---
Thanks!
---
Don't use same password twice? We ere talking about recovering accs, and my point is that if you are smart and don't tell your rsn, email and full name, there are very very little chance to get "hacked"
---
Adding another source of mats inevitably lowers the price of said mats. (See skilling resources) you still haven’t answered my question about what the demand is for this new source of scales.
---
This is great :)
---
monk robes, zammy book, dragon mace, climbing boots, neit helm, holy symbol.
---
You can find so much help and info from people and internet. Its really nice
---
Haha maybe I'm just that locked into the Ironman mode I can't waste stuff 🤣
---
I got a viggoras mace, and the tankiest gear I can afford, but my problem is running out of supplies. Would venge help?
---
Lmfaoooo

RemindMe! 2 days
---
ye or just spam brews
---
Plus pages never sell for their GE value unless you let it sit for a long ass time. If I’m cashing in loot I have to almost halve the price for it to insta sell
---
It would crush scales which is alot of the profit per hour from zulrah. Have to disagree here bro.
---
I love the idea for new mid tier bosses and monsters but... Nah on the scales drop.
---
this list makes legit no sense lmao. cox is 85% ranged, lets upgrade to solo tekton items before getting essential boots/jewelry
---
if a req is boostable/nonboostable
---
what you have to kill in the quest, level and if there are safespots
---
This is a really good list.
---
We should be staking here for a jmod smackdown or a recovery. I stake 50m on a jmod smackdown
---
Heck yeah it happens! I had a clue step at the dual arena and got the Robin Hood from the casket!
---
Lol bruh I alch my gold bars from blast furnace just because it's an easy stack of thousands
---
I was just talking to a friend about this yesterday, lmao! Would be sick if they let us do this.
---
Why does his political affiliation matter? It's a funny response that is neither hostile nor supportive towards Trump.
---
Ignore him, the beak is great
---
&gt; So to your first point, the "if you have a lot of gold" example was used against my point. All I did was adopt it to show an opposite perspective, so me using the example to "push a narrative" is a reach at best. To the original example used against me, whats to say they weren't using it to push their narrative?
---
Yes I know, and im pointing out why what you said was very poor logic.
---
&gt; To your second point, yes I understand if wildy bosses were moved from wildy the profit would be cut down bc the game is risk reward, although I'm not sure what making that point does since that's not even a topic anyone brought up, nor a solution anyone should consider. Taking wildy bosses out of the wildy is an asinine example of a solution.
---
....what?? I brought it up because its extremely relevant. People complain about PKers while doing PvM content in the wildy. What theyre complaining about is they essentially want to have all the reward, with zero risk. They want to be able to kill these OP monkey making bosses/mobs of course, with no risk to them at all which I suppose is human nature but not reality. If you cant accept and prepare for the fact PKers are one of the risks for the insane profit of Ven/Revs and are going to complain about it, then simply dont do them, but theres nothing wrong with that being a risk for such an insanely rewarding activity that req nothing at all to do. Im not saying take them out of the wildy, im pointing out that if the people who complain about having to be in the wildy as a risk for 2.5m-5m/hr as a reward with no requirements clearly dont realize thats the ONLY thing that makes them so profitable. Not to mention, if you just come prepared and know what youre doing while PvMing in the wildy...it really isnt very difficult to tank/get away unless youre in multi and get hit by a big team. So if you CHOOSE to not be prepared and not know what youre doing, and die then its your fault only.
---
&gt; Your third point was that people who don't want to be killed in the wildy shouldn't go to the wildy and I've got to say, this insight is unparalleled and I don't believe I've ever seen anyone else with this perspective, its just another level of thinking honestly.
---
Yes, if youre going to go into a risky place for a great reward and youre going to do so completely unprepared and without any clue what youre doing in a PvP situation and as a result die then simply do not participate in it? If I suck at Zulrah and also dont bring an anti venom and then I die, should I go complain to Jagex about it or is just my fault? Because thats the exact same thing. But complaining about it on reddit and then spite voting because of your own choices is simply immature and stupid, so yeah just dont go into the wildy then until you grow up and come prepared is clearly the best advice. I mean I genuinely dont understand what goes through peoples heads when they get so butthurt and salty trying to PvM in the wilderness, you KNOW this is a risk and yet are completely unprepared and cry when you die. Ive rarely ever died doing anything in the wilderness (excluding actually Pking) and when I have I just said oh well who gives a fuck and moved on with my life like any normal mature person playing the game.
---
&gt; Think of any other game that has PvP and PvE/PvM. Legitimately go to any other game and the PvP and PvE/PvM are completely separate game modes
---
Um have you ever played WoW? There are Pve(where you have to toggle on pvp when youre doing stuff in the world) and PvP servers, you can get ganked doing ANYTHING in the game(by any level) that isnt instanced, its basically how pvp worlds work in RS but thats how the server you play on ALWAYS is. 
---
&gt; Maybe our definitions of PvP are different? In my mind PvP is between at least two parties that want to compete. **How am I competing when I'm naked with a spade? I'm not.** A fully kitted pker killing a clue hunter is a disgusting excuse for PvP and if you are someone who's advocating for Jagex to address PvP, you should agree. 
---
PvP doesnt have to be "consented" upon by both parties at all really in most games. What does have to be agreed upon is usually you CHOOSING to enter a PvP area, and if you enter a PvP area then you ACCEPT whatever else comes after by default. PvP is not supposed to be as fair as possible most of the time, if you think that then there lies your issue. 
---
Your biggest problem is right here: "How am I competing when im naked with a spade?". While quite frankly youre not going to be able to, and why is that? Because you deliberately CHOSE that before going into the PvP area. Did someone force you at gun point to go into the wilderness with absolutely no gear to food/brews to fight back or tank? Dont think so. So then dont complain on the extreme off chance you get killed (ive literally never been killed doing a clue, rarely even attacked so Ive got no clue what all of you are crying about in the first place). Its pretty fuckin simple dude, either come prepared or if you die for nothing because someone wanted to see if you accidentally took something you shouldnt have by chance (and that chance is basically the same exact chance people will kill Corp, or Arma for a rare drop, so whats the diff) then dont cry and complain about it and take it so personally. Just do what everyone else does and accept the waste of a single minute of your time and move on with your life, who cares.
---
Boomers were a mistake
---
So after all of that, how it is jagex fault? I assume that there are lots of recovery reguests and if they can get all that info, I don't believe that jagex have recourses to ask 50 question to make sure you aren't hacker, that's would take more man hours than developing osrs
---
This post is severely underrated.
---
Yeah, if one was unprepared I could see how difficult it would be.
---

funny how people downvote me, but look at Sparc Mac, he has like a 150b bank, where did he get it from? The arena. So do most other people with over 25-50b
---
Ok this is not true, he does not accept donations
---
Lol how much did he get lured for?
---
mfw this alwyas happens at redwoods

Uhh... you got it backwards. I can see someone buy 1 maybe 2 bill. Nobody is dropping 90k on runescape my dude. Definitely not rwt

Quest cape not being S teir. You have failed mate
---
Obama was going to go public with the information but Mitch McConnell threatened to turn it into a partisan shitfest so Obama held his tongue. So yes, McConnell wanted trumps campaign to be positively effected by Russian efforts.
---
He's saying $60k is a lot and that "pocket change" usually denotes a small amount of money.
---
&gt; Well you decided to not do it, and then still did it because of your addiction, therefore you must be weak according to your logic.
---
You don’t understand. I’ve tried to clarify, but if you’re going to keep your head up your ass I can’t do anything about it. I will try one last time. Please read carefully. 
---
Addictions last a lifetime. Once you acquire an addiction, it will not go away. You will have to battle it every time you are put in a position to give into it. 
---
There is a *distinct* difference between a weak minded person who makes every excuse in the world to justify their addiction. These people do not battle their addictions. They let that addiction run them over. Making excuses for your addiction is a fancy way of letting everyone know you’re a weak person who can’t fight it. People who are actively fighting their addictions will be fighting it for a lifetime. They made the specific choice to continue to battle it. Sometimes they lose, but they don’t make weak ass excuses and get back on the grind. It’s a choice to be weak and be the victim, or actively fight and change yourself every day. 
---
You seem perfectly okay with being a slave to your own weaknesses. You justify their weakness. You make excuses. I have no respect for you or anyone who pretends that nothing can be done. That they cannot in this very instant come to the realization that they can control their addictions and make an effort to change. People with your mindset will not accomplish anything important because you fold the second it gets hard. You do it to yourself. You’re a victim of your own self pity. 
---
The good thing is that any day you can decide differently. You can make a choice. To stop putting yourself and to start changing things. Not just you but anybody, with any problem.
---
Wtf is wrong with this world..
---
This aged well, it’s like a b ring and surprisingly people do risk them :)
---
If rcing was 300k exp/hour nobody would complain. It's literally just the fact that it's slow that people don't like. The issue is absolutely not that it's insufficiently engaging. Do you think blast furnace gold bars are engaging? I sure as shit don't. It's not really any different than rc. But it's 300k/hour so you don't see any complaints about smithing. 
---
I am not 99 rc. I have no claims to rc achievements. But I do know that maxing in osrs means something and maxing on rs3 means nothing and the difference is quite simple- everything in rs3 is comically fast and afk which invalidates the achievement. Having literally 3 of 23 skills be slow is not the end of the world. You can get 99 in 10+ skills in under 50 hours apiece.
---
At least hydra is still solid alchables and stackables. But that kc without the flagship drop is really bad luck.
---
Cleverest post today. A+. Got me to chuckle.
---
Not a fun boost though
---
I also get what your saying and appreciate you saying that yourself.
---
That is true however a lot if not most of the player base are unhealthily addicted to the game some of whom value virtual currency more than irl currency.
---
The reaction was very disproportional however there are some very irrational psychotic people out there. The best course of action I can see is just to treat those how you yourself wish to be treated even online therefore you cannot run the risk of pissing off a deranged person and having them brandishing a knife at your door.

can confirm. I've been a NEET for 11 months now, playing runescape fulltime and all it really is is a form of escape, other people do it with drugs or alcohol or w/e, I do it with runescape. It's a sad life, and after max I'm going to change again, hopefully.

The thing is, they do respond outside of Reddit, but now there's this precedent for Reddit posts.
---
People rush here without even attempting to submit a ticket or do it if their ticket was looked at within 5 mins.
---
How can you expect them to fix their customer service when people won't stop using Reddit 
---
99% of the time all they had to do was be patient and their ticket would go through. Most of the time the problem isn't even solved on Reddit and the posts didn't need to be made. Redditots shouldn't have an opinion on  customer service problems.

Anyone with that kind of money that doesn’t have it spread to multiple accounts with multiple passwords and emails is retarded and deserves to be hacked. You also can’t even be hacked unless you have allowed others access to your information or gotten yourself phished. So unless this actually is a mod jed 2.0, this guy is worthless garbage. Nuff said.

It requires email verification to remove the authenticator, so they need two passwords to bypass it...

&gt; Nobody is dropping 90k on runescape my dude 
---
I can see why you would assume that no one would spend such an absurd amount of money on a game, but it happens. I read a story about a housewife who spent upwards of 40k on some facebook mafia game, and remember that dude who dropped 70k on fate: grand order?
---
runescape has been around for a *long* time, I can absolutely see someone rich and mentally ill enough to spend 80-90k (likely closer to 80 with the prices advertised for RWT) over the years

Your entire post screams "im a f word who gets my news from /r/politics and /r/news exclusively", but this quoted section was just a straight up lie. There is nothing illegal about that.  If it was, our corrupt as fuck government would have moved to impeach him already. I would be front page news every day until he's out of office. You are straight up lying, there is no way you actually believe this. Fucking idiot. I hope to Allah we can get a civil war started and purge everyone like you from the planet.

&gt; Separating kids from their parents at the border with no plan to reunite them simply to deter immigrants &amp; asylum seekers. Before you say Obama did the same, he did. He also reunited the families shortly after their parents were processed through the courts &amp; released.
---
That's not an atrocity, what definition of the word are you using? Maybe those parents shouldn't be trying to enter the US illegally?
---
&gt;Vetoing a bipartisan bill to end the support of the Saudi Arabian genocide in Yemen.
---
Ah, now here's time for more research on your end: what are the provisions of that bill, and to what extent is the US supporting the genocide? Is it "we support the government and they happen to commit genocide" or "here's $20, go start a genocide"?
---
&gt;Allowing a US residing &amp; work visa holding journalist to be brutally murdered by the House of Saud with no repercussions.
---
Boy, that's loaded af and I'm gonna immediately call bullshit. What's Trump supposed to do, bust through the wall like the Kool Aid man and stop a fucking murder?
---
&gt;Using human beings as political pawns, whether it be the manufactured humanitarian crisis at the border to promote his border wall, ending DACA &amp; attempting to use it as leverage for his border wall, shutting down the government for a month, causing hundreds of thousands of governmental employees to miss mortgage payments as well as not be able to afford medicine, food, water.
---
See, that's still not an atrocity and those employees received back pay - and as far as I know, nobody was *actually* ruined by it. Further, it's not his fault that congress didn't want to play ball. They knew what was going to happen and they did it anyway. Why are you exclusively blaming Trump for something that is clearly not an atrocity?
---
&gt;Implementing the transgender ban in the military. Those young men and women are willing to die for our country, and in return we say they are lesser people because they were born the way they were.
---
lmao if you sincerely believe that a group of people who are extraordinarily less mentally stable than a vast majority of the population belong in a high stress environment with access to weapons then you've got another thing coming. Furthermore, they make up less than 1% of the population - it's not our job to cater to them. The military has every right to be discriminatory towards people who want to join. There's a reason why we don't let fat people in.
---
&gt;Attempting to give nuclear capabilities to the Saudi’s. 14 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.
---
K, source? Furthermore, was Trump trying to literally give nukes to the government or people acting on their own agenda? I thought discriminating against people based on their national background was wrong? We better ban all the mexicans from entering the US because of MS-13, right?
---
&gt;Not to mention the obstruction of justice, breaking the law by not handing over his tax returns the Congress, disregarding our intelligence agents when they told him our election was influenced by the Russians &amp; saying he believed Putin over them, lying about the Trump Tower meeting to the public, Barr attempting the spin the narrative about the report &amp; blatantly lying to our faces, and constantly attacking and demoralizing the character of people who have allegations against him (Stormy Daniels, et. al.,) or are investigating his actions (Comey, Mueller &amp; his “13 angry Democrats,” Schiff).
---
1. Too bad the Mueller report indicates a lack of evidence for any obstruction
---
2. It's not a law to hand over your tax returns
---
3. lmao that's not an atrocity, and don't forget that the "muh russia" narrative is flimsy at best. They had no real impact.
---
4. The Barr report was wrong and yet there was no collusion? K.

5. You mean all the people who made baseless or exaggerated claims that were later found to be baseless and exaggerated? Color me shocked!

&gt; You are probably the saltiest, most selfish, most immature and childish pussy I have ever seen on this sub comment about PVP and clues LOL. You literally do not even do clues because youre so terrified of getting a step that involves 
---
Ad hominem
---
&gt; I mean you have the ultimate victims mentality and such a completely warped view/perspective on PvP its actually pretty crazy. You seem to think the only thing all PvPers do is sit out in the wilderness waiting for people who are naked doing clues,
---
Strawman
---
&gt; how delusional are you to actually think like this? 
---
I don't believe the strawman you created, no. Lol.
---
&gt; 90% of Pkers could give a shit if youre doing a clue, if they just happen to see you while theyre out running around moving from spot to spot then SOME maybe attack you but youre terrified of practically nothing and voting no over practically nothing. I mean you do realize, less and less people would be even out there trying to kill people doing clues (which is such an extreme minority of pkers, and certainly no actual good Pkers) if you actually voted yes on new content and updates for PvP right? Youre actively spiting yourself, while spiting others and youre completely oblivious to it.
---
If it's such a tiny part of PvP then why are so many Pkers against a toggle to remove wild clue steps in exchange for clues with an extra step? lol
---
I've had multiple people on this very thread suggest that removing the steps would literally "ruin" the wilderness. 
---
Thank you for your opinion that people people against it are not good Pkers though. :\^)
---
&gt; Ive never ONCE even been killed doing a clue, its extremely rare I ever even get attacked doing one 
---
Being attacked in PvP, I don't enjoy PvP. I've stated that I don't enjoy PvP at least a half dozen times in this thread, how many more times would you like me to repeat myself? :)
---
&gt; so what in the literal fuck are you so terrified of?
---
&gt; I know its tough for you to use actual sound logic and not be some crazy delusional, irrational terrified PvMer
---
&gt; ust imagine Jagex completely ignored updating and fixing your favorite skill or PvM activity....thats the current state of PvP. Its completely valid for people to be complaining about Jagex choosing to ignore PvP entirely for years.
---
Can't fix RC when it's already perfect. :)
---
If they were ignoring PvP entirely for years I wouldn't have anything to vote no on. :\^)
---
&gt; You however, choosing to blindly vote no to every single PvP update regardless of if its good for the game and how needed it is in PvP SIMPLY BECAUSE wilderness clue steps exist
---
I do not believe any PvP updates are good for the game because it makes PvPers more likely to PvP. 
---
&gt; most irrational, immature, and delusional shit I have ever heard. And yes, you are a massive pussy and I feel bad for you in real life since if youre too scared to even do a clue in fear youd get a wilderness step then I cant imagine how tough real life would be for someone like that and nothing you say will change that.

---
Gl with this one m8
---
Poggers
---
that would explain it
---
No you are not settled reeeeeeeeeee
---
As for the basics:
---
• Positioning. You should basically never take damage from poison clouds, if you are then you're wasting supplies. Pay more attention to the rotations and try to learn each one (there are 4 in total) so you can avoid this 100%.
---
• Swaps (Gear and prayer). Pretty much just like positioning. You should be fully swapped and able to attack Zulrah as soon as the game will allow pretty much every time (With the exception of the start of the 2 rotations where you don't know if a mage or ranger is gonna pop up). If you aren't, you're wasting valuable DPS time (resulting in a longer fight and more supplies used).
---
• Eating. Try to eat between phases, you can always get down a piece of food (or 2 if you combo with karambwans) every time Zulrah goes down without losing any DPS time. Eating when you could be attacking wastes valuable DPS, resulting in a longer fight, and more supplies used.
---
More advanced tactics:
---
• Dark bow. Pretty cheap, but can easily cut some time off your average kill length. Use it for the last hit on the mage phase with amethyst or dragon arrows. Takes some getting used to, since you have to figure out exactly when you should use it (since blowpipe is better DPS, you only want to use it for what would be your last blowpipe hit before the mage phase ends). Shorter fights = less supplies used = easier to get multiple kills/trip.
---
• Snakelings. Try to blowpipe them in between phases if you can, it'll save you from having to take damage and let recoil kill them. Again not hugely significant, but killing 5 snakelings this way saves you from a potential 75 damage. Do NOT do this when you could be hitting Zulrah.
---
• Ring swap. If you don't need your recoil/suffering equipped for snakelings, another ring (like brimstone) would result in more DPS. Takes some getting used to, since you have to figure out when snakelings are being spawned etc... But again, more dps = shorter fight = less supplies used
---
it’d be fun

E

not gunna lie your series is one of the shittiest series i've seen on OSRS, now that I've got your attention, you're a beast man keep it up!

Oh this is neat, I like these theories. Especially the one about adulthood. Makes sense that we all went by WYSIWYG as kids, but as we got older, became more conscious of the people behind keyboards.

It really is so middle school haha. Feels nowadays like most of us are college-aged and just here to play with pixels. Today's middle schoolers are probably busy trying to buy Fortnite gfs or something.

90% of osrs players are over 18, so that probably has something to do with it

Also most of the player base is the same people who were 12 playing back in 2006, but are now grown.

&gt; I listed an actual example of the left's position changing radically in the past 11 years. You simply insinuate that the right has changed their position in the past century without actually providing any examples. My argument has substances whereas yours is full of shit. In fact, this is representative of your entire comment. It's a bunch of pseudo-intellectual, pretentious bullshit with absolutely no substance. 
---
See: Wendell Willkie's campaign speech's from the 1940 election
---
&gt; It's not. It would be convenient for you if it were, but it's not. There's no such thing as a government so right wing, IE so small and weak, that it magically becomes powerful enough to exert its will over its own people. Small, weak government and fascism are two suggestions which contradict one another. 
---
This, again, reinforces the fact that you don't know the origination of "left" vs "right" and think that political ideology MUST be held on a single line. 
---
&gt; "'BuT tHaT's NoT rEaL sOcIaLiSm!!@!@" That's some especially generic NPC dialogue. 
---
Not what I was saying at all. Nazi Germany wasn't called socialist until very recently, because it is a fascist government. If you want to consider fascism a leftist government then why are you so against calling it fascist since that's what it is?
---
&gt; you're an atheist because you quite clearly do no thinking for yourself
---
That's hilarious. I'm an Atheist because I was raised in a religious household and have read the Bible and studied the bible, as well as Christianity as a whole and many other religions. But I can assure you that I am most definitely not a "leftist" as you would describe them. 
---
A gun owning, freedom loving, veteran that bought my first house in my mid 20's and have a good paying job that is entirely centered around logic and reasoning.

&gt; You're one of those "...stupid, and therefore gullible people..." that I described because you parrot whatever you've been programed to believe.
---
Ahh yes, I was programmed to believe things by reading primary sources and looking through history and taking into account multiple sides of arguments from multiple sources and then coming to my own conclusion is being programmed?

If you haven't already, two-factor authentication, a bank PIN, and a regularly changed complex password are all encouraged methods of better securing your account. That said, Jagex can't seem to adequately secure their own servers/databases though:

At least 2 range pots and an anglerfish or two to overheal before jad (in case of prayer screwup) and an emergency heal if necessary. Take out the Guthans. It shouldn't be necessary to have so many brews using barrows armor if you keep prayer up and stack mobs well.

When will Jagex actually have a discrete and proper security system for account recovery, for real this shit is something you would see in an MMO back in 2007.. Use 2step verification, sms.. phone calls..

You use about 1.2-1.3k chins an hour, so if you are using red chins that's about 1.5m an hour. MM2 caves give you a little over 600k exp an hour at high efficiency, which makes it worth it, however I think it's much lower for MM1 caves.

Use Italy rock safe spot, take a rune crossbow and use long range. When healers spawn, run back into safe spot. Tag them as they run past. Then you can pray melee while jad is stuck behind the rock and take 0 damage. After they're dead, you can still see jad as you leave the safe spot. Source: got my fucking firecape on mobile.

Grinding first Bond is definately not worth, its around 30hours of halfassed xp and horrible money due to how heavily botted f2p content is
---
Well there is the question of why the playerbase like that type of humor in general, but otherwise I think this is an accurate summary. Anyone who has spent any time on 4chan can see the same traits in many OSRS players, especially in CCs.
---
To clarify I want to know what would be the most inefficient ways from 1-99 in every skill.
---
Assuming the account was a UIM and would not want to lock itself out of any skill.
---
for example to train runecraft I would need rune essence so mining would have to allow mining of rune essence
---
Just to clear things up here:
---
1. Yes, this had to do with OSRS.
---
2. No, this had nothing to do with the clan of the assailant.
---
3. The assailant has been permanently banned from both the in-game clan chat aswell as the discord of his (now ex) clan. The clan does not want to be affiliated with the assailant and/or the situation at all.
---
4. No personal information was shared by the clan of the assailant. The assailant found out via an advertisement on Marktplaats (Dutch Ebay/Craigslist) by the alleged scammer.
---
5. The alleged scammer and the assailant were friends on Facebook with both their real FB accounts, as a part of the scam I believe. (You can decide for yourself what this means when it comes to doxing)
---
Now this - I can believe...
---
Literally minutes after one goes down it comes right back up again under a different account. This is a bigger issue with twitch overall. There's not a lot that we as individuals can do to fix this aside from asking twitch to fix this and spreading awareness of these scams.
---
The lucky implings dont give the clue, you actually get the items from the clue droptables.

Well the harpie bug swarm season is over, the main goal of harpies wasn't the clues but the combat/magic xp and money! Thanks &lt;3

I’ve always started with combat. Once I get those up to about 80-99 I start skilling. It makes running through the wilderness easier and slayer gives you a good amount of gp once you hit 99 to train more expensive skills like construction.

Octopi and squid also have jizzballs, but they work differently. Their spermatophores embed themselves into the skin of the female and the sperm burrow their way towards the eggs. These spermatophores can embed themselves into any species and improperly cleaned octopus and squid can jizz into your mouth when eaten. The jizzballs then embed themselves in your mouth, impregnating your tongue. (But not actually because your tongue has no eggs)
---
Don't think that's criticizing your country but okay.
---
Its my fault since I don't own a smartphone? Sure I could have protected it better if I had one, but it also is way too easy to take over account using email alone-and there is no protection items you may never want to get rid of or enter wilderness with.
---
Gmaul being 50% at lower levels where pures dominate/even zerkers is completely broken since you can 1 tick it from MSB/ballista etc. really easily and stack a dumb amount of damage fairly accurately at those CB's. Its less OP at higher levels because of defense and gear since it hits high less often but its still pretty fucked because of AGS/claw gmaul which can easily stack 100+ damage and its just a stupid game of who gets better RNG. You can be in 350k rag tribrid gear against someone in 300m risk tribriding and easily kill them with some decent AGS/gmaul RNG and if youre good and just camp melee pray a lot in karil/dhide top you can pretty much have little chance to die.
---
Gmaul isnt the only problem at higher levels though, PvP mechanics in general are pretty broken (especially mage defense) though since being in better gear and being the better player isnt rewarding enough just like being in much lesser gear and being a shittier brid but camping melee pray makes it pretty hard for you to even die still. They need to make quite a few drastic changes to the mechanics, including fixing gmaul.
---
They only risk a spade, obviously. No one ever brings their wealth into the wilderness. Smh.

what the fuck does this have to do with $11? Did you just plug a meme to try to farm karma? Sad.

And it keeps getting worse folks
---
It's funny, the first one or 2 are invaluable. It took me like 600 kills for first one.
---
Then the other 50-100 from trying to get a dwh are just insulting. Not sure why we don't have any other uses for them than just breaking them. Pay 100 talismans to upgrade a talisman to hold extra charges or something.
---
How did u get a pic of my bank

Yeah because msb&gt;gmaul or ballista&gt;gmauling at 60-80cb stacking like 80-100dmg really takes a ton of skill and youre totally bad if you die from it
---
/s
---
Shit is pretty damn accurate at those levels and people just will rush you and if they dont kill you/hit well theyll tele 5 seconds later. 
---
Youve also clearly never been 1 tick AGS/gmauled for 110 dmg bridding on a med/maxed main, and the only way to not have that happen is sit near max HP and camp melee pray every other hit which is just shitty gameplay but basically what you have to do. A guy in rag with AGS/gmaul can easily hit you for that when youre in 100m risk if youre not camping max hp and praying melee.
---
You too, man. Take care. Hope work goes by quickly and easily.
---
I like to set some short term and long term goals for the account. It sounds like your account has a solid base where you can work towards some of the later game stuff. For example a short term goal could be barrow gloves/fire cape so you are able to train your melee stats to 99 more efficiently.

If i was to do it, it would be entirely fake points. Not sure how you would earn them but they would be completely worthless

 So your argument that you’d rather have guns on the street than knives is that you’d rather get shot than stabbed? Ignoring all other circumstances, and an anecdote where it didn’t matter whether he had a gun or a knife because you didn’t get hurt

I mean, all three are mental illnesses that are easier said than done, can all in theory be done by themselves, and are a lot easier with the right help, and are all an oversimplification of what goes into it (albeit, yes the depression was slightly more oversimplified than the others to make my point)

Yes the one news channel that has some programs which are not controlled by the left. How about literally any other news channel? 1 news channel does not balance out the many opposing channels.

i agree that scamming/luring is scummy and illegal if you did it in real life, and there should be repercussions for it. However, the penalty should not be death or being stabbed.

It's literally impossible to prove that the accounts go through the actual support, [but the only instance of an post actually bothering to contact customer support was a praise on it actually working.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/b825rp/didnt_need_reddit_for_customer_support/) I can't find a single other post where the reddit support meme actually led to anything other than a smackdown, but it takes a while to search the entire subreddit. Do you have a single example of a reddit customer support post panning out?

Nazi Germany set about systemically disarming the minority groups they planned to exterminate. They did not "ban guns". Gun ownership rose within the white German-born population. They were encouraged to militarize.
---
On a related note, the first major gun legislation in America was a Republican effort with the support of Ronald Reagan, and it was aimed at disarming black people. Really makes you think.

---
I was expecting answers like this, and to be honest, I totally agree it might sound that way. Tried to make it not sound like Im hating on a political side, but apparently it failed. So the question I asked myself is why gaming seems to correlate with being right wing. My train of thoughts appears logical to me as long as we keep in mind Im just talking about tendencies and not individuals or political parties. Saying conservatives have and are "low social skills, negative world view, scape-goating minorities, and hateful." is ridiculous, yes. But assigning these attributes to a number of gamers isn't. And these attributes lead to them sympathising with the right wing. That is different to saying that conservatives are like that.
---
Well done! We could say... you got lucky
---
No where why is this simple question taking such a huger detour?! But since you asked and didn't read my previous responses at all so it seems, I do not agree with current gun laws in my Country. 
---
All im fucking saying is if I had to either get shot or stabbed by a random person (they could be a sadistic mother fucker for all I know) I would rather be shot (I prefer a quick death) than be stabbed 30 times like you see in Mexican cartel videos. 
---
And I just pointed out that the person with the knife had no hesitation from cutting you where a gun weighs a little bit heavier with the consequences of actually pullin a trigger, which is probably why you got harmed and I didn't.
---
Leave it to the internet to start making wild assumptions from a basic statement. I like cats more than dogs. Oh what so you hate dogs?! you wanna just round up all the dogs and gas them is that what your saying?! And fyi you brought up "anecdote" first.

He replied to a tweet that said that the game didnt feel like it has ever needed a skill in the last 6 years to feel complete and that he fully agreed with it. Basically he doesnt believe a new skill should be introduced to osrs no matter what it is

that guy said too much but he's right that you should've just checked the wiki. osrs has one of the better maintained wikis for a game. actually even just googling your question "osrs short bow vs composite bow"  has old archived reddit threads with answers. basically plop your question into google first before posting, you'll likely find an answer there.

Those "clumps of cells" physically resist the instruments used to slaughter them. Those "clumps of cells" fight for their lives and it's all visible on ultrasound.

Anyways, your side of the isle now argues for partial-birth abortions and even after-birth abortions. You're perfectly okay with a baby being a few inches from being completely outside of his or her mother before he or she is killed? You're okay with a child up to two years of age, the age your side of the isle argues is when abortions should then become illegal, being euthanized? 
---
How do you sleep at night? No, seriously. You go to bed saying "We're the good guys!" while supporting a child that's 1 year, 364 days, 23 hours old being killed because the mother changed her mind. It's sickening that you don't have the decency to jump off a bridge to rid the world of yourself. You're evil.

Nazis: Disarm minorities, encourage gun ownership for white Germans.

Republicans: Literally the same thing except for white Americans.

Carrying out your lawful, constitutionally protected right to bear arms in America **will** get you murdered by the police (I.E. the enforcement arm of any fascist state) if you're not white. Afterwards, the pro-gun, pro-constitution, pro-freedom party will say you had it coming.

I will imagine he's going to spend a lot of time at Barrows in the future, he's going to want 99 mage for the added magic defence bonus and Barrows provides him with those runes, as well he will get a lot of coins from alching the barrows pieces which he will need to buy the Verzik's crystal shards as dying in the theater will require him to have 100k to reclaim his items which will mean he'll have to get 100k cash from Gargoyles every time he dies in the theater.
---
Or crazy idea here, you need to verify your email to stream, I doubt there would be as many, also phishing/scam stream reports shouldn’t make you click through 5 pages of options to get to it.
---
(Before I continue, I wish to make it clear that I wasn't meaning verbatim in my first response, and I was obviously running off memory. Now that that's said...)
---
I was actually very curious myself so I decided since I had extra merching accounts I might as well use one and go through the questions at the first door until I got to the one I roughly recalled. This is what I found.
---
SoS Door: "To pass you must answer me this: What is the best security step you can take to keep your registered email secure?"
---
Inputs:
---
1) Set up 2 step authentication with my email provider.
---
2) Have a complicated password set to my email.
---
3) Use an email address just for Old School RuneScape.
---
Answering 3 returns: "Wrong! Even if you dont use your email address elsewhere there is still a risk that somebody could access it."
---
Answering 1 returns: "Correct! Enabling 2 step authentication on your email means that nobody apart from you can access your email account."
---
What I take from this would be that even though it says the answer is wrong, it doesn't mean it doesn't help. My first response doesn't reflect this and I wish to clarify what I meant instead in my second response: QED that the answer was wrong. Secondly, I also recall there are other questions (at least one) in the SoS that have a primary "correct" answer and a different one as an "okay" answer, and still allows you to pass if you use that choice (so theres actually 2 answers that return the same thing as "correct"). This tells me, assuming the questionnaire is unbiased, that this question we are talking about should ALSO have 2 technically correct answers that let you pass. And yet it does not.

Since that episode runelite has added a feature where they anonymously aggregate drop data, so a lot of the wiki is now updated with exact drop rates.
