shoutout hozw in this thread he wasn't bullshitting

Gl, bossing is definately what makes the game fun for me, especially group bossing

Putting a space in front of the / is user error not the game lul

It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
---
Maybe to you, but people that have been invested into not just OSRS but RS in general for years and years dearly love this game and have seen a lot of the negative changes throughout the years play out. OSRS was supposed to a second chance for players who loved what Runescape used to be, not what it ended up becoming. It's disheartening to see a lot of the community forget about the mistakes we were supposed to learn from.
---
Totally agree on the korasi spec! What else would you put in your top 5? I'd say DDS, D Claws and AGS are iconic. But the tune throwing axe spec was the first I ever used in members and I still get nostalgic thinking about it now
---
I want a gem bag to level up my crafting via tzhaars shops so im doing barrows for better gear to kill venenatis for the d pick 
---
Gz on the achievement, but my god that is pitiful loot.

My alt is Rimjobington. 
---
Definitely helped ruin the game by making it too easy. 
---
No it's not 
---
I don't care what they unofficially said in random Twitter conversation, read the fucking dev blog and stop being stupid. 
---
&gt;As this method of influencing the contents of your dungeon is earned, we'd prefer that players not be able to bypass it for free by using an alternate client to scout the dungeon 
---
This literally says that scouting will only be removed if the scroll method is passed as it's "earned". 
---
I care
---
Where's the coke and sluts ?
---
Rest was actually pretty neat. It was fun to stop by and rest, maybe end up around some other players who you'd chat with until your stamina recharged. Rest was the golden period, I'd say. Having SC, resting, and the decent graphical enhancement before it strayed too off. Dungeoneering was also pretty fun with pals, when you knew what you were doing.
---
Honestly, I just miss Stealing Creation... 
---
'lose'

Let's not kid ourselves. The only thing you really lose on death nowadays is chins

I’m guessing pretty much exactly base 70’s?

The changes are to normal hydras, not the boss fyi
---
Reading the question explains the question
---
Yeah 10hp doesn't compare. Have a HCIM that I occasionally play and I've mostly just done fm while it's 10hp to avoid wasting supplies later. Same thing of never needing to resupply due to how op cakes are for low hp players.
---
Skip to 0:11 seconds 
---
Forgot to mention the part where is swears to a reward at least triple your amount 
---
If you are that concerned with efficiency, then buy the stamina pots. Absolutely nothing would change there and there would still be a demand for stamina pots. 
---
Yes, some call it power creep while others call it new endgame content 
---

sick bro
---
And mage+smithing
---
Not a fan of the wards, rebalancing rooms should be enough to lower the overall time people need to spend scouting to find a "good" raid, don't need to add any additional methods to aid that, just properly rebalance the puzzle rooms, (thieving and ice demon take too long), I don't know the specifics of points compared to tightrope but that probably needs addressing aswell.
---
The energy pools should not remove poisons, if the raid has shamans, you pre anti, or bring a sanfew, if you forget, you get poisoned, do not cater to someone making a mistake like that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Although this isn't a balancing change but I would absolutely love to see the metamorphic dust have the option to transform the Olmlet into Vespulas flying form.
---
If your looking for a clan join : average joes
---
We do some learner raid sometimes with clan mate. 
---
Lol! I wish that was the change. I actually decided to drop out of med school irl to pursue something I really want to do instead of what I’ve been pressured to do. 
---
Edited out of the video
---
You mean like hiding poll results, which was polled and failed?
---
Personally think Jagex should classify more things as game integrity, but that will go down like a lead balloon.
---
Almost yeah, my highest skill is 81 ranged

Good thing it gives no exp, otherwise there would be all those people with lvl 99 firemaking trying to get 200m exp for free.
---
That's not difficulty, difficulty demands some level of skill. remembering your spade has nothing to do with difficulty. The only way I could see it actually making the game easier is like how if you got koed in the wildy while doing a clue, you wouldn't be forced to drop a spade to keep your clue. In that way I guess you could say it changes the difficulty slightly, but I can't really see how stopping you from having to walk back to the bank mid quest is "difficulty" related. When I think of "difficulty" I think of things like boss mechanics and avoiding damage, things with actual risk, etc.

---
The Arceuus spellbook could have been the OSRS equivalent of summoning but at the moment it’s a bit underwhelming. Has so much untapped potential, I hope they rework it at some point
---
Judging from the fact that this looks like the only bank tab it seems like all other skills are probably lvl 1. Since skill lvl plays a role this might be about average loot.
---
Because a lot of these dicussions aren't "hot" right now. And those of us who have tried to fight against them aren't seeing Jagex listening. Blowpipe has been a problem for almost 5 years now, which is more or less the same for clients. Most people at this point see those things as the status quo, and those that still have an issue with them have been trying to argue against them for years at this point.
---
It's not like it's been that long since these topics were frequently discussed though. People were clamoring for blowpipe and tbow nerfs with Hydra's release, and Runelite's development has been a huge community debacle, especially when it was open-source and saw opposition from Jagex before it went closed-source.
---
The thing i never understood is why the demi-bosses don't have drops... It's way more exciting then just grinding till the end.
---
I do indeed :) Drop me a DM if you like!
---
We shouldn't use currently bugged mechanics as an excuse to add more.
---
That was my understanding, but I never directly affected me so I couldn't say with too much certainty. Thanks for putting it into words 
---
Whats more profitable to do herb runs with? Ranarr or Toadflex? Im currently at lvl 39 farming
---
Fishing monks. 5.8k till 94

Dont change ballista, tentacle, saradomin blessed sword, slayer staff, staff of dead, and i think it's good. Maybe toxic trident gets it's magic requirement raised by up by 5.
---
Not that i'd want this:
---
But It was a fun thought when I was reading the list of if we bumped up attack level for whip to like a 80 if it'd change up what is actually used for a lot of people.
---
Not sure, sorry. I did them individually. Trained str with a Sara sword then trained attack and then defense with a whip.
---
Hah, good one mister geneticist. Multiple decades of research into human biodiversity debunked by a retarded leftist ideologue who thinks categorization is a set fact instead of a scientific method to find meaningful groups of correlation and dataclusters.
---
You don't think acquiring knowledge and remembering things is a skill in a game? You're wrong. An extra inventory space is OP. 
---
For bursting slayer tasks, what gear should I buy to increase my max hit?
---
Since dust devil and nech magic defense is so low, accuracy doesn't matter, so prosalyte for top and bottom. 
---
Occult necklace, tormented brace, and imbued cape are boosts. What staff and shield slot should I use? I dont believe any boots can boost mage attack
---
I got a medium farming contract and got a magic tree, is this a thing? 
---
You dont just get hacked, especially with 2fa. You're purposely leaving something out, and it's very clear. 
---
Join we do raids discord server, they have mentors that teach raids and many people that raid. There's no single cc for it, more of a place to find people to raid with and learn
---
I think it's harder to stay alive for 5 minutes at hydra than it is to kill it in 1:25 honestly. Are you a wizard?
---
Yeah, other than the obvious (firemaking, fletching, construction and wood cutting) all stats are 1!
---
Super Saiyan/ DBZ comments can be filed under here.

I disagree, see. In your hypothetical "perfect world", we've already been given EoC, squeal of fortune, effigies, etc.
---
Player polls are the only way to ensure that the community controls the flow of content, it isn't going to be a 100% perfect or foolproof system, but it's what we got.  You implying that the devs inherently know the best direction for the game shows how inexperienced you are with the devs choices, they have fucked the game to the point of ruin in the past. This version of the game started with a player poll, and should strictly stay on that system until the day it shuts down. 
---
Hi, I woke up today being accused of using a 3rd party program/macroing or "botting"
---
I personally stream Rocket League 6-8 hours a day and usually afk train in NMZ / cut magics as I'm doing this throughout the day. (I use my laptop as its easier than alt tabbing whenever I have time.)
---
My question is I recently downloaded Runelite as I see nearly 95% of the community suggesting and using already and wondering if this has anything related to the matter. The ban itself is only a two day suspension but the next offence will result in a permanent ban that I won't be able to appeal. I've been playing again for approximately seven months and would hate for my progress to be deleted for afk training.
---
Do you think Runelite is the thing that triggered this or should I just stop afk training as I am multi-tasking other things throughout the day?
---
minor note I have come across a few people ingame chat that I am not able to respond to immediately because my attention is elsewhere but have told me they recruited their clans to report me for being "a bot" . This has happened a couple times and I would be shocked if this is all it takes to get someones account deleted

At 10hp in Wintertodt, how much more often will I be taking damage with only 3 pieces of warm clothing vs. all 4? I'm trying an armor-restricted HCIM and the only option I have to get 4 pieces is the lit bug lantern or tome of fire in the shield slot. Would it be much safer to cannon the 33 Slayer requirement for the lantern, or will 3 pieces be enough?
---
LOL 
---
This is cool, I see no reason why this shouldn’t be implemented. 
---
The extra 5,000 points when completed a Chambers of Xeric: Challenge Mode raid should be added towards drop potential and not just be personal points. This would push more people towards this endgame content and would be much appreciated by the Challenge Mode community.

Welcome to reddit.

i was under the assumption that runescape doesnt run off of your gpu, only the cpu.

after testing while running runescape my gtx 1080ti sits at 1% usage rate while my cpu sits at 8% usage so i guess who knows.

I have a f2p account with 40-50 in most skills. Only real low ones are rc and mining.

I'm getting close to a bond, what should I knock out first, once I have membership, to progress my account and continue buying bonds?

A portmanteau (/pɔːrtˈmæntoʊ/ (listen), /ˌpɔːrtmænˈtoʊ/) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word, as in smog, coined by blending smoke and fog, or motel, from motor and hotel. In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes.

That's how Runescape works!

Is SS2 on the record?
---
runelite and afk training dont get you banned for botting. autoclicking/botting gets you banned for botting.
---
Alch yourself
---
I've never seen someone so dense in my entire life. If there was a requirement to get 100k castle wars tickets and I completed and then they removed it and let people who didn't do that get the same cape where I got 100k tickets you'd be pretty pissed off they waste TONS OF HOURS of your life. If you want comp you need to put the same work in that everyone else that currently has one to deserve one.

big brain thinking right here

Peculiar muscle contraction but alas

It sounds like you're trying to mock anime, but any self-respecting weeb would say "yup that's accurate and I love it"

Oh brother are we stuck 2 years ago???? Lmfao

I'm only a fan of removing small scavs and changes to theiving. Tekton doesn't need to be made easier. Vespula doesn't need to be made easier. Scrolls seem pretty pointless tbh.
---
Also, with this:
---
"Some dungeon layouts don't give you a scavenger corridor before you get to the rooms that require the items they'd drop; we'll aim to weed out these possibilities."
---
Are they just saying that they'll make alting easier lol? The only item that you (might, but don't really) require is a bank. Seems very pointless and only really makes alting easier lol.
---
Dammit and i thought i had taken every precaution....

yup you are correct. Just tried it, good know! thanks

Yeah baby blues are super easy to kill. Any of the metal dragons are a safe block, it’s just iron and steel dragons get assigned the most out of them and they suck to kill

Guess you’ll have to try again next year!

RuneLite itself almost certainly didn't trigger this. You may have downloaded a fake RuneLite client that intends on stealing your account.

Just one more week for your tears of guthix. Hang in there man. 
---
If any sort of rest mechanism is added, it will act as a sign of the coming end.
---
Try doing 12 hours of a tick manipulation method, it's hard. It being boring doesn't mean it isn't hard. You have to put in a ton of effort to do that, which is literally what it being hard means.
---
19hp is the optimal I think, it still hits as if you have 10
---
Ah, sounds good then. You do this in RS3 as well, but its even worse since you gotta swap gear to use an ability, then swap back, its horrible.
---
well if you turn the gpu option on the game IMO runs better, however I don't know if it works well if you have on board graphics which is most likely what he has.
---
Good thing the foil has a 75 agility requirement.

That wouldn't solve the problem it would just shift which raid people scout for.

So I asked my cc this last night why there were so many lvl 3’s? Are they leveling up smithing or smithing a certain item to farm gold or craft?
---
The odds of you getting this are normally about 1/1,800,000 id say you getting it at 48 is about 1/3,000,000 lmao very nice. Im not good at math and i didnt try but yea lol. Very rare.

I mean nuggets are like 1k ea i wouldnt call them worthless

We literally have staminas which are 10x better than resting why the fuck do we need to add resting or god forbid 134953453540 musicians around osrs that restore energy? It's just not needed. The ONLY thing that should be considered is the update kieran proposed to do with graceful pieces.

What do you mean? What are the charges for, what do they do)

Presets are actually 2 ticks to load up unless you immediately press escape after the preset button.

Unfortunately I can't do any of them :/ no way to get hay anywhere in morytania for the hay sack (scarecrow task)

Guthan's warspear, verac's flail, and torag's hammers all have pretty similar stats. I'm sure you'll be grinding some barrows for tank gear before getting a whip, so maybe you'll see one of them along the way.
---
Bucket!

Get your combat stats to 70's. Then get full obby, obby sword, and zerk necklace.
---
For bosses do: King Roald, Count Draynor, Me (lunar dip), The Kendal, Tree Spirit, Bouncer, Khazard Warlord, Black Demon.
---
At higher stats (80-90+), use these bosses: Ice Troll King, Dad, Arrg, Jungle Demon, and either Count Draynor or Me

this is east ardougne bank if anyone cares enough hop 200\~ worlds to find him

But sotd cannot autocast burst can it?
---
Suggestion: what about charging the cape with firelighters, this will give the cape one charge per firelighter that will be used when you create a fire with the cape (this fire would be the same colour as the used firelighter). When the fire dies out there would be no ashes. However, this might be complicated to incorporate with the max cape.
---
Saw one the other day wearing full rune with an addy scim, he asked for a rune scim and after he got it he had a conversation with the person that gave it to him and got advice to do slayer for money so he said he was off to do slayer and said goodbye. I had a weird feeling so I added him and his priv was on in a different world, hopped to it and there he was at the ge asking for a rune scim.
---
It's almost like there are no real noobs left anymore, just beggars in disguise.

What?
---
Now, what we need is......A WALL! A virtual wall. Makes OSRS great again and gives us some damn boots for all armors even 3rd age.

Man back in my day we had to actually pull chisels out of the bank. It was amazing.
---
What are they nerfing in NMZ? The XP rates?

Thats a tragedy
---
#YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT IT WAY TOO MUCH, TRYING TO EXPLAIN YOU’LL DROP NOTHING IS LIKE IF SOMEONE WERE TO TELL YOU “HEY, YOU MIGHT BE WASTING YOUR TIME KILLING NPCS, THEY MIGHT NOT DROP A CLUE SCROLL!”
---
You won't keep it for very long if you keep cooking on that side of the range
---
lmao
---
right
---
I'd actually like to see this. Wouldn't be much easier than using NPC contact but that would be a way better perk than a 10% chance of getting the same task as before.
---
Currently I'm not a member I only have the free quests, I've been flipping so I'm going to flip and get a bond
---
everyone seems to be picking at what I said and coming to their own conclusions of what I meant, I’m not saying that nothing in osrs is hard, but just playing the game and building up your account isn’t hard. Yes if you want to ehp the shit out of it and tick manipulate all day then yeah that shits hard, but realistically nobody does that and it’s very very very far from the standard play style.
---
Bruh I had to remove flute salad as my ringtone from just how much puss I was drowning in. 
---
Resting would primarily help newer players/f2p players. It was inefficient beyond 50-something agility anyway. I think a lot of the people that want it back want it because it was just kinda comfy to have your character sit down and chill for a bit lol.
---
Oo forgot that trip wire was there, I’ll remember it next time! 
---
*trips over it when it’s directly in front of you* 
---
Theres a subset of the community who has longterm goals they research and think about. An ironman may have in depth knowledge of the Hydra for when they can eventually kill it. Requiring access/completion of content to be able to vote on it wouldn't fly for one second before enough people complained it had to be reversed.
---
The blind yeses still happen, but so fuckin what? They weren't asking balance-breaking meta-shifting questions, they asked if people would like to have a chance at a hydra head and another slayer helm color.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the help. :)
---
Would i be better off ranging or is melee still much better for Hespori?

Not sure if its a weird dream or thought, but more often than I'd like to admit, the thought of "Just use the search button to find my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ " passes through my mind.

\- Phone, Sneakers, Specific article of clothing, etc...
---
&gt;Sorry but you’re gonna have to figure this one out on your own man. The meta is the best way to do something.
---
Actually they're right, the 'Meta' is not, by definition, simply the best way to do something. In a literal sense it's the broad state of the game, the most used methods etc. For obvious reasons the best method and the most popular method often allign somewhat in online games, but it's very much possible that the meta way to play the game is not the best or most efficient, but the easiest/cheapest/most accessible. Or maybe it's just what a lot of streamers do. 
---
mayb because it was inactive and heavily botted

Oh then you'll enjoy the members quests that will give you lot of xp, will help you get into the 50s :D

Can we get the CC bug fixed? After hopping world from world, doing PVP/PVE, every 3rd or 4th world bugs the cc. Effects us who do team pvp/wars against other clans. 
---
I only need 70smithing and 68 mining for quest reqs
---
Soooo they can’t make a hot that can use gates...?
---
Imagine if there was ability to scout boss drops. Like, you get to corp, see it's not a sigil, hop and repeat. Once you find a good world you call in the team and you do the kill.
---
We don't have such feature and I don't see anyone whining about how most of the Corp's drops are shit and they have to waste time getting those drops.
---
That being said, if scouting gets removed, droprates probably should be buffed accordingly so that reward prices don't change too much.
---
Enemy difficulty = group cb

Enemy hp = group hp

The opposite of the last attack used is 100% true on the last phase. If your thinking it's 50/50 your not paying attention. The only damage you can take randomly is first hit and random poison splats.
---
Look... At the... Spellbook....
---
Thing is, you can use the Nightmare zone to teleport there, as well as watchtower teleports and the Yanille teleport. It’s more convenient to those who have houses in Yanille too as these areas aren’t easily accessible unless you run there from another teleport spot.

Whoa, how certain are you that it doesn’t interrupt?

Well, I usually equip them to get the effect  although this has been a controversial topic as to the need to equip them to obtain the effect
---
Then try to make sure you have it before you leave?
---
This isnt qol its a straight up buff to the game
---
IDK. Hcim btw.
---
Damage is done now though. If raids were released without the option of scouting then sure everyone wouldnt care. But now that scouting is accepted and highly used by anyone doing raids 1 it's not going to happen.
---
Jagex fucked it by making the raid randomly generated. It's so obvious that some rooms will be better than others that people will abuse whatever system is available to get an ideal setup.
---
1) What the fuck are you on about? Eugenics? Buddy you are about 35 miles out of your depth.
---
2) Insults aren't arguments and using buzzwords like science says so! is about the most reddit thing I've read all day. Nice one.
---
I read the post. And youre freaking out over someones username having your first name in it. 
---
And my point is that unless your name is "kaldbxuem" then it's safe to assume youre going to have a pretty common name. Which you just said it, and you certainly do. 
---
Not an argument.

Best series since GSSFS by Runeshark. I've never been so excited to see a video pop up in my sub box. Keep up the good work man!
---
That drunk wont
---
3rd party clients do completely change the game relative to people who only use the default client though. Good example of that would be scouting in raids. It's literally impossible to scout a raid in the default client, so raiding is actually more efficient purely due to 3rd party clients.
---
&gt;Whats the point of calling it a dragon hunter lance when its not the best option against dragons,
---
But it is the best melee weapon for killing dragons. It's not the best weapon period, sure, but that's not a problem with the Lance, it's a problem with the Blowpipe being broken as fuck.
---
There's always an efficiencyfag like you in these threads lol.
---
I had at one time or another each of the accs you mentioned I went from 60-99-1 to 35 def with turmoil got 80 then 99 attack with chaotics made a 45 def 60 attack with turmoil, shared a 75 def 60al attack piety account with a friend and ended on a low cb handcannon void acc with rigour.
---
That was the most fun era I had in pking but largely this was due to these broken builds..while pvp is no better now with void range being the strongest till mid levels and even somewhat competent at mid level... I disliked the fact that chaotics ruined the trend of pking with risk or any variety but I surely enjoyed it... nothing felt better than being on my 60-99-35 with a yak, ch crossbow, staff and claws in fungal with the old patented snakeskin top black dhide slay helmet or ram bone helmet and just absolutely rolling low level mains and 99 attack pures at drags.

The fastest rc method relies on other players and is MUCH more expensive than smithing.  Paying runners for zmi is like 10m gp/hr and around 100k exp/hr whereas gold bars are 400k/hr and much, much cheaper.  It also doesn't rely on other players as zmi runners does.
---
Blast furnace wasn't in 2007, or exp rates anywhere close to that weren't a thing either.  Why is that okay but an update to rcing isn't?
---
RC is much more click intensive with lower exp rates, weird to me.  RC doesn't make you tons of money at all.  It makes you a few hundred K per hour, or if you do lava runes you lose money.
---
That relies on other players and is MUCH more expensive than any other skill in the game, while still being MUCH slower than the expensive skills in the game.
---
Like how potions normally work...
---
Second time in a row your and Verfs videos dropped at the same time. Makes for a great ass day.

---
I agree with the tool belt point. It completely nullifies like the point of having utensils to begin with via inventory management and remembering to bring them if you have them on you at all times. 
---
The most I would be comfortable seeing is something like the Dwarven Army Axe. It still requires an inventory space, doesn't completely remove ALL tools from the equation like moulds and some more niche items, and stays in your bank meaning you actually have to think to bring them still. IIRC contained some common tools like  chisel, hammer, tinderbox, knife and a bronze axe and pick. Only really combines inventory slots and reduces the number of tools you need to bring. I can't think of many things where you would be using more than one of those at a time, and since it's only equivalent to a bronze axe/pick it's only really useful for map traversal or questing rather than Skilling. It could even be tied into a Black Guard (Dwarven spec ops) Quest akin to Barbarian training, but with this new tool. 
---
Because would OSRuneScape still be the same game if you weren't able to forget your chisel on your birdhouse runs? 
---
literally the only reason why I voted yes there, otherwise it would've been a straight no.
---
You are correct
---
I rather see them balance rooms points wise too. But thats never gonna happen.
---
Just make every raid 5 rope rooms. I would vote yes to it.
---
...this guy
---
I believe this guy 
---
This right here is the hardest part of the caves. The anxiety that sets in is too goddamn much, especially if it's &lt;5 attempts. 
---
And it's not because it's a particularly difficult achievement, either. Jad himself is not a hard fight. Prayer switching and dealing with the healers, while a bit more difficult than most other fights in the game, is still a decently easy and manageable task.
---
What makes it so goddamn hard is knowing that if you fuck up, you have to grind for another unprecedented amount of time, taking no liberties, making no mistakes, being on top of heals and prayer, just to get back to the fight so you can inevitably fuck up again and miss a single prayer that will send you sobbing back to the beginning once again.
---
And I fucking love it. But too much of Jad can seriously cause palpitations. 
---
You're right. But that's not what he did lul.
---
Oh? Blast furnace wasn't a thing back in 2007, yet the exp rates for rcing remains near the same.  Why was that change allowed but something can't be done about the shit method of rc training?
---
The fact that a 5m item is the second best behind a 1.1b item should speak volumes to how necessary it is to nerf the pipe lol.
---
They own reddit.
---
I don't think fletching should be 1m/hr (actually 3-4m/hr), but that doesn't mean rc should have its best training method at lvl 28.  That's just fucked.
---
Olm difficulty does not scale down at all, but points for olm DO scale down. Meaning someone at 114 combat gets 20% fewer points for the exact same olm kill.
---
KOREKT
---
Even the 1/1 counts as 1 towards your total. So you’d need 750 without those 
---
Is Runelite closed sourced now?
---
If you hate the skill don't train it? I guess you're one of those.  "Wintertodt should never have been a thing, or minnows, or blast furnace, or motherlode mine".  And content is locked behind RC.  Retard.
---
Devalues my potion scam only account
---
Noone is losing shit when they die anyway. Except for instanced boss fights where noone brings cash already. While questing you only need like 50k anyway which is no risk in the grand scheme. I dont often find myself out in the world thinking "ah shit, I could use 15m right about now, if only!" which means I never even bring it with me. There arent any reasonable downsides, it would just save 1 inv space and maybe that 1 noob who died holding his stack and somehow couldn't get back in an hour would be affected.
---
I loved summoning and soul wars, spent most of my time doing those two for a good few years
---
No it's not, that's a misconception, because as I said, the most effective often alligns with the most popular. People who weren't aware of the actual meaning applied that label retroactively. Meta is an established term with a definitive meaning in this context. 
---
What do you mean by in-group preferences and other evolutionary group related things?  Like are they things taught to a certain culture that you worry will keep being taught?  Or that certain groups are genetically predisposed to it?
---
Doesn't feel so bad cause the quest gives you runes to tele there and then it teles you back
---
That's fine I'm not calling for 400k/hr methods, I'm saying there should be a faster method in the game than the lvl 28 method.  And blood/souls are at what most consider an already high rc lvl, which are still much slower than a lvl 28 method.
---
It's the same reason why reddit hides comment karma on a ton of subreddits for a period of time.

See I can totally get behind regenerating guilds alot of them could use the love. The requirements to get into the guild are really not that steep. Some of the teleports are a bit too high level for what you are suggesting. So maybe some tweaking could be done. 
---
I like this idea
---
&gt; Jagex fucked it by making the raid generated not randomly enough to not be predictable
---
FTFY
---
They probably didn't have resources to make it truly random like Dungeoneering and/or underestimated this community's ability to research game mechanics. They might be able to fix it now, but the comminuty reaction won't be pretty.
---
Was fifth grade for me. Started in classic when my older friend showed it to me. Was at least a year or two before they had the rs2 beta. Was members only, luckily I had members even though I was only ever logged into f2p worlds cause memb worlds felt empty, and my game play consisted of pecking out "free stuff plz" with my two index fingers. When I log into classic The progress I did, and didn't make amazed me.
---
I had 20 attack and def, but around 50 str, and 56 fishing. I put a shiiiiiit ton of time into the game too at that age. 
---
The only other game I played at the time was a lot of pokemon silver version
---
I don't remember when I played on and off. I often stayed at grandma's over summers, and sometimes ran out of AOL minutes. One point we just didn't have internet for a year until I got xbox live and rainbow 6 black arrow in like my early middle school days. 
---
It's a temporary mechanic that's been in the game longer than it wasn't in the game for. As far as anybody knows it's permanent, or at least it's very low on the list of future updates. It's virtually impossible to solve the reason that it's necessary so it's kind of unlikely it'll go. My guess is that eventually we'll get the rs3 system of buying your items from a character that saves them for you at a percentage of their grand exchange cost. It's not a perfect system but it's a nice coin sink and it's better than the current no-risk situation. 
---
Shopping efficiency has always been a "guy" thing, but osrs definitely intensified it lol
---
30ms ping last night, 250ms today. Good job jogrex!

Just wait until they level up and become a wife, the armor they want to go out on quests and cosmetics for the occasional nightly boss fight costs a lot of gp
---
I have been in White nationalist circles for multiple years, have talked to national socialists, have dealt with right wing anarchists, right wing authoritarians, monarchists, absolutists, etc. 
---
Literally none of them wanted whites to rule over others.
---
Literally none of them made the case that whites are "superior".
---
I assume innocence (although as I said before, thinking X is superior over Y isn't immoral, no matter the groups you put in there) before guilt.
---
So I will change my position if proven wrong. Until then, white supremacy is a myth. And it DEFINITELY is a leftist demonization tactic to take away the humanity out of their opponents. (you can see this being done to me right now, not that I care)
---
But please don't waste your energy posting some retarded media slander or something that isn't muh supremacy which you can misrepresent. 
---
The definitions I gave are the only ways you can possible define the term in any meaningful way. And I will need direct quotes.
---
Also: saying X is better than Y at Z is different because in that case you have a measurable standard, which makes it an objective statement.
---
E.G. blacks are better than whites at running long distances. This statement doesn't make you a black supremacist because it's not a value judgement, it's a statement of fact. These types of statements are either right, wrong, or maybe lack precision.
---
Slayer is the most popular skill by far, with some of the best variety.  You have many methods to train it, afk, non afk, fast methods, methods that earn you more gp.  The same can't be said about rcing, pre 77 bloods its a complete shit show of a skill.
---
That is definitely a valid and very solid statement. It should be nerfed but, I say for certain bosses. Maybe Hydra? 
---
I don't own a T Bow and I only use my BP for Sara GWD, Zulrah, and very few Slayer tasks. 
---
I mean.. How hard is it to memorize how many runes you need? 
---
How many pearls?
---
It's many, many hours to make a set, and it's not BIS. It's on par with the armour you can get from like 4 hours of PvM. To make it BIS melee you need to do a bunch more PvM to get the essence to smith the better version, making it require PvM too.
---
&gt; TECHNICALLY it won't kill EVERYONE
---
I think it would if you factor in prayer which you didn't do
---
&gt;You can hit nonstop 72 hits with dragonstone dragon bolts
---
No you can't hit max hit consecutively, not to mention you can combo eat and then eat again between hits so it's not even remotely as good
---
&gt;Dharok's axe has a max hit of 100 without spec.
---
 Dharok's axe's max hit is if you risk having 1 hp 
---
and the value of dharoks set makes it reasonable (high risk, high reward)
---
&gt;You can hit 188 in 4 ticks with dragon thrown axes.
---
Who cares about 4 ticks? You can eat 6 pieces of food between the specs. If you get 1 ticked, you die before you have the chance to eat.
---
&gt;If you go to 70 or 99 def, you'll just get literally raped.
---
I like how you don't bother to check 1 def because it wouldn't help your narrative. Fact of the matter is there are more 1 def pures than any other pker so surely it should be accounted for.
---
&gt;Alternatively, you only do pure PKing, where it OBVIOUSLY is pretty good, since there's not really anything better.
---
You just admitted that it's the best spec weapon among pures. If the opponent has 1 defense, gmaul spec is more dangerous than d claws, etc. You don't see an issue with that? Clearly you don't 1 defense pure or you have a gmaul pure yourself.
---
&gt;Again, you've gotten brainwashed by all the gmaul compilations.
---
I don't waste my time watching runescape videos so you just sound dumb reiterating again that I watched and got brainwashed by gmaul compilations. I've literally never seen a gmaul compilation in my life and I've been playing since 03-04.
---
&gt; if you think that happens every time you take out the gmaul for a spin, you're sorely mistaken
---
Nobody said it happens everytime. Again, the accuracy is not relevant, it's the potential damage output that I'm focused on. Again, if an inaccurate weapon like obby maul could 1 hit in 1 tick even if unlikely, surely you'd see that as unfair. It's honestly baffling how you don't see how a 1 tick spec that can hit over 100 while costing 30k is fair but no point in arguing with someone that thinks it makes sense for your potential-to-hit-all-3 goes down from 11% to 10.75% AFTER potting up
---
Isn't there a skillcape that gives you a small item? Could FM give you a log and automatically light it (ie without a tinderbox) 
---
I'm saying there's nothing morally wrong about giving commands to a muted phone. You've stumbled over yourself so many times that I'd rather you take a few minutes and collect your thoughts before you proceed to waste my time even further.
---
Lol downvoted instantly, no wonder why people hate this sub.
---
I didn’t disregard any of your points. You think the only way you should be allowed to have a quality of life change is by spending hundreds of hours getting a stats for a method of training that in inferior to how you were doing it before. Again, “it devalues my time” 
---
I just don’t vote. It’s pretty chill. 
---
&gt;
---
Not everyone finds it more fun to get the drop at the task. You still get the knowledge that you're going to get the konar loot roll when you get the key, which can be exciting. You then get the excitement of actually opening the key after the task.
---
The real difference is that it makes a little bit more sense for the monsters to drop the key rather than the items themselves, because why would they have access to this completely new drop table just because you're on a konar task?
---
Fletching has an all option does it not?
---
It would be 1 thing if there weren't dogs or if there was a reason for not being able to attack these. But with how it currently is I don't see why these aren't attackable.
---
Oh yes that makes sense. Yeah it was great, unfortunately Jagex just gave up on it and didn't advertise it besides one tiny bit of text on the main page. Most people on rs3 still don't know what it is. 
---
But yyyyyyy
---
I wouldn't mind scrolls that allow for an instant bank. 
---
I second this, a stylist would definitly help you he more precise when it comes to switching gear/prayers. Ive Done a few kills on mobile its def doable.
---
Yikes, sorry you're too insecure that your accomplishments are compared to others rather than what you've achieved yourself. Quite ironic calling me the crybaby when you threaten to quit over something taking less hours to get than it took you :( 
---
So was the entire game lmao
---
I’m at 4, it honestly made me take a month and a half break just tilted to the moon
---
So, you want a "sit" emote.

We don’t want to be anything like RS3. I would vote no to anything that brings anything related to that dead game to old school.

Not sure where you’re getting this “devalues my time” quote from. would love for you to quote me &lt;—- notice you won’t do this because you seem to enjoy using  straw-man fallacies. You definitely disregarded my points, even with this comment. You’ve ignored my argument for realism in fantasy based games, literally twice ( I can quote you ). 
---
You have made no good arguments thus far and every-time I’ve responding to you and made you look like an imbecile you move on to the next talking point. Maybe try controlling you veins in your forehead before they pop and stop being so inflammatory in your debates so you don’t come across as a moronic parasitic asshole

Last week I was hoping worlds looking for a spot to set up a cannon. I found someone who seemed to be AFK, and didn't respond when I asked him if I could set up a cannon.

He came back a minute later and swore his head off at me. I would have been polite about it. Instead I spent the next 40 minutes kill sniping with a crossbow. 
---
By 6 encounters I mean puzzles and combat rooms yes
---
I know people pre scout with alts. That's an alt method, which is functionally doing 2 different activities at the same time where both accounts happen to interact, not a single activity. It's like saying runecrafting is twice as much gp/h if you runecraft on 2 accounts at the same time. That's just doing the same activity twice and calling it one activity.
---
Alts are dogshit game design as well so I'm happy for anything that makes them less useful.

How do I give reddit gold
---
yep, alching will stall the action. It might be possible during three ticking, but i have no idea.
---
Anything already in there can still sell, and will stay in there until it does or you take it out. Keep in mind the value of the item might drop over time, making it less and less likely for it to sell
---
I finally got the highest level needed for a quest requirement and I’m not touching it again until I go for max

Well, good imo. Would make it even more profitable for non-bots, who can then just pk the bots.

Ah, That's hot, That's hot

After you do the barcrawl mini quest, you have the option to crush empty vials so they disappear from your inventory. I'd like this to apply to empty jugs too.

I agree but be real, how would only having 1 fire impact anything assuming no ashes spawn after? Multiple fires wouldn’t make a difference

Do you plan on going for the red or yellow reward tokens for the temple trekking?

I agree that Jagex shouldn't cater to streamers but it seems like an oversight that the dogs aren't attackable in the first place.

Repeatedly getting downvoted because you can't see why what you're saying isn't very well thought out isn't helping yours, either.

No. They were not. They were responding to a stupid question that was asked and it was immediately shot down by everyone on the couch.

Holy shit fmod Tuffty still around. The way that guy would lock threads and always leave a snarky remark was rage inducing. Now it seems he’s getting confused in his old age and misplacing posts. I haven’t been on forums in ages because it was so restricted by the fmods.
---
Alright, so that person **honestly** cant believe a single person cares at all about somebody playing this 18 year old game in a unique way?

Na, that person either can't fathom somebody liking something he doesn't in general or is just be contrarian to seem cool.(?)

This is literally [UIM Verf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCymoZh5mmZIKSqTtadRf3ow/featured) on his UIM Karamja only account. There's a guy with insane dedication!

For example, he [raked a farming patch 2,430 times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw7CW94BJ0U), he [fletched 118,000 teak stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1rjuKlLs8Q), killed [2500 Tzhaars with bronze darts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXfRRYOW_as), and has been lamping for 5 months straight. It's my absolute favorite series because of the sheer amount of time that goes into it. Big shoutout to him!

i now see how that part can be taken the wrong way also make me laugh

devalues my broke ironman 
---
Its alright, at least you're not wearing dragon boots
---
Why are we able to make a profit making bronze and silver bars but not iron or steel bars or anything higher than that? In other words, what is keeping the price of silver ores lower than the price for bars while most other ores cost more than the bars you can make from them?
---

16 tries...  with at least 70 def. How?

I 1 tried it on my iron at 61/40

So farming would also be impossible for this idea
---
You aren’t doing yourself any favors by saying that. 
---
I get that scouting only being available on the 3rd party clients is a bit of an issue but removing scouting entirely is NOT the way to solve this issue. I was expecting that if this was ever touched they would add an npc to the vanilla client that tells you the rooms in the raid. in RS3 dungeoneering, the smuggler npc at the starting room performed a similar function, giving you a hint so you would know what the boss was in the dungeon. This idea of no scout raids doesnt work because there are special items and spells to bring depending on the rooms you get. in order to fully prepare for everything you would need a crush, stab, freezes, salve, pick, antipoison, and ideally tinderboxes/axes/lockpicks on an alt. I'm all for making the less popular rooms more attractive but preventing us from scouting makes raiding overall much worse. The thing is, people don't just skip bosses because they are bad, they also skip bosses if they are poorly equipped to deal with them. For instance, if most people on a team dont have hammers, then it's best to skip tekton. This was addressed in the changes but there are other things like this too. If there are no bows on a team, vespula is probably not worth doing, and if people are using leaf bladed sword or d sword, it's probably worth skipping vasa. This puts the players in a hellish situation where they might have to quit the raid because they can't defeat the bosses in the raid. Everything else in this update seems fine, but I would like to add that a lot of people have been saying to add the skipping scrolls and leave scouting untouched, and as much as i don't want raids to be nerfed, i also don't think scouting needs an extra buff from these scrolls. The boss mechanic changes are good enough.

Let's talk mid level gear progression.
---
You've got a Helm of Neitznot, Dragon Scimitar, Dragon Defender, Fighter Torso, Dragon Platelegs, Dragon Boots, Glory, Combat Bracelet and DDS spec weapon for melee.
---
Archer Helm, Rune C'Bow, Broad Bolts, Red D'Hide + Shield and Glory for ranged.
---
Farseer Helm, Elemental Staff, and Mystic for magic.
---
The obvious thing that springs to mind is an Abyssal Whip, Amulet of Fury, Berserker Ring and Barrows Gloves.
---
I'd guess that Whip &gt; Berserker &gt; Fury in terms of  buy order, but what comes after this? and in what order is it best to get them?
---
What sort of priority is getting items like Iban's Staff, Trident or  Blowpipe? How much better is an Occult than an Fury for mage, is it worth getting?
---
Where do you go after that?
---
Have you tried testing out the different fps limiting options?

You can try twitter but it will most likely change nothing.

Fun fact: “Third World country” simply refers to any country that wasnt aligned with the US or Soviet bloc during the Cold War.  US was 1st world (of course).  The USSR was 2nd world.  And everyone else was 3rd world.  Maybe/probably not how this user meant it, but thats what the term originally meant
---
This is a weird ~~bug~~ feature that I just noticed. If you try to log out the tick after you kill something, you do not get stunned.
---
How about a creature that constantly heals you? And since we’ve already added a few prayers to the game, can we get a prayer that heals you for a small portion of the damage you deal? 
---
For items that multiple uses per day like explorer's ring 2 teleports, does the cooldown start when the first teleport is used or when the third is used?
---
Regardless, it kind of rewards lack of preparation. 
---
It's not our fault that they're added to the client we have no say if they do or don't. But we do have a vote on what comes into to the game through Jagex what's so hard to understand? 
---
This is why the wildy course is my favorite, the odd pker encounter will be the most exciting thing that'll ever happen while training agility.

what happened to his phat?
---
Because smelting bars is a popular money making at blast furnace, which only uses half the necessary coal for steel and above. This creates demand for ores iron and above, and lowers their bar price. Which is why you don't profit the regular method, only doing blast furnace.
---
Literally the entirety of the game *is* annoying and unnecessary steps. Are you for real?
---
Why do you even go through them

Okay, multi-million go/hr player-run workarounds do not equate to a design choice. Clearly there was no intent to balance around having paid players essentially train the skill for you. All you  have to do is click the altar. That's the shittiest counterpoint to Runecrafting is slow I've seen in a while. Sorry I can't be more of an input, im too tired tbf, 
---
Pretty sure he cant complete bone voyage + prereqs for it without leaving morytania
---
Lol you cared enough to comment :p
---
Apparently roughly 50% of the viewers of the OSRS dev stream want resting. 
---
Why go through all map work when you could just remove the Hunter skill?
---
Then why make a eternal slayer gem
---
This is just poor lab practice.
---
Yeah, the mage minion will wreck you if you don't have mage def. Grador's ranged attack is very accurate anyways, and the benefit a bcp provides in a solo/duo isn't much. Bcp is useful for larger group sizes when you want to prioritize dps at all times and also because the kills are faster, so the mager gets way fewer hits in.
---
He can use the spell instead.
---
See ya next week! 
---
Why does the textures look so bad?
---
What poll?
---
I'd rather it flipped personally
---
eagerly awaiting your "My first screenshot" post next
---
I did not know this existed in the game. My bad. 😅

On some of the unban threads. “Bad tuning” or “we set the threshold too low” or “you fit the criteria but” are all basically saying saying jagex is guessing. Its part of the reason for the ardy knight nerf (presumably, jagex will never say it), because someone misclicking for an hour appears very close/indistinguishable sometimes to someones autoclicker fucking up for an hour. Jagex doesnt have the tech to see that ur clicks are 3 hours of recorded actions sped up or delayed 1-100%. They just guess based on ur character profile they build. Its why bot guides tell one to not bot more hours than they usually play because thats part of jagexs profiling they use to guess ur botting. 
---
Okay just to rephrase, there are ways to 100% catch a bot, its just jagex will ban you now if they think you are most likely a bot instead of just know as of 2019. In prior years they didnt ban unless it was 99.9% (ballparking), but i guess they have “idgaf” money now. 
---
That nose though...
---
Good thing there aren’t any ibsticles in the game
---
Your character just likes the high from the poison.
---
haven't seen a botting unban thread in a loong long time.
---
Cry aboot it :)
---
Aviansies for kree, greater demons for kril, but graardor is actually an ourg and can’t be killed on a goblin task as far as I know
---
Feel onto your channel by accident. Binge watched everything (up till 7 at that time) and proceeded to watch all of caveman only, uim verf, only trails, Mac h (10hp) and a ton of other restricted iron men. You're videos are by far my favorite. Keep the grind going!!
---
Just make it require an eternal slayer gem. 
---
Have it on it’s own table, showcasing the prized gem , sitting atop a pile of bones with the gem glowing. 
---
Damn mining was highest level until 75, still is if you ignore combat skills. I don't mind it because I mostly play on mobile at work so MLM is bearable.

Killing a random innocent man strolling outside Lumbridge Castle isn't very nice either, but the game still lets you do it. I feel like lore reasons don't really matter too significantly if they'd respawn anyways and you can slaughter a million other innocent bystanders in the game and nobody bats an eye. If they were named or something, I'd get it.
---
Can you look at fixing the layout of the houses and make them feel like a part of a Kourend Kingdom? 
---
Mod West’s idea for hosidious to have a farmers market with possibly an agility course sounded excellent and gave it a better feel. 
---
Also his spellbook rework sounded far better.
---
Finally, I think that a minecart should be added to amount Karullm so that you can get around kebos using transport methods outside of fairy rings and some jewellery but keep methods inside zeah. Maybe connect this to lore as a lovrajki mining outpost or something?
---
I also think the medium diary requirement needs to be changed that what’s you to teleport to the fairy ring. Why is another lazy requirement that is found in 5 other diaries still being used when it has zero relevance to kebos. If it was an Easter egg like the ardy zoo Tele then it would make more sense, but this is just random. There are plenty of possible tasks you could add instead that fit into the theme of Kourend.
---
Got it first try. Just watched the how to video 5 times. Pretty easy if you play video games. 
---
I met this dude the day I bought my twisted bow and ended ghosting him because he wouldn't stop trying to be friendly and I'm antisocial as fuck. Looking back at it I'm not surprised 
---
I'm not sure about ward scrolls. Jagex has correctly identified the problem, but their solution is off. Scouting in raids is an issue: it feels "hacky," you need to use a 3rd party client to do it. So their proposed solution is targeting scouting, and trying to get rid of it altogether. The thing is, instead of trying to fix the rooms, they're just giving a workaround through the use of skip scrolls. The better solution is to fix the common skips (Vesp Vangs Ice Thieve) by making them more fun to play and take less time. Removing scouting is a good idea and I agree with removing it, but this is not the right way to do it. 
---
At this point, if you remove scouting it just lowers gp/hr from raids 1, which just means people will do other content instead. I don't think that's Jagex's goal with this update, (maybe it is?) but that is the effect it will have if the poll is passed in its current form.
---
This idea is basically just a piece of the proposed skill "artisan". That said, I loved artisan and I love this idea. It's a shame people didn't let it pass the polls. It would be a very nice addition to compliment all the Slayer and bossing content they've been producing
---
It requires a major engine rework

There are many guides on Youtube in setting up your PoH. In the end you have to decide what you want to have in your house (but keep in mind a smaller house will load quicker). Some tips for leveling.
---
- The crystal saw applies a +3 construction boost.
---
- Keep your house as small as possible to reduce load time, eg 2x2, 3x3. Having a second floor and/or basement will also increase load time.
---
- Your leveling method will most likely be making crude wooden chairs from 1-33. Oak larder from 33-74. Oak dungeon doors from 74-84. For increased xp/hr and gp/hr you could make mahogany tables from 52-84.
---
- When you hit 40/50 con, build 2 bedrooms and hire a butler/demon butler. (From the servants guild in east ardougne).
---
- After hiring your servant, build a dining room and a bell-pull, so you can call your servant. 
---
- At 58(55) con build a Servant's moneybag.
---
Don't worry too much about building extra rooms, you can always remove them later and they don't cost too much. Don't commit too hard to your portal chambers as you will be building a portal nexus later to replace them. 
---
Ara ara
---
Revs camped 24/7, everyone knows that skulling = better loot, weapon is only good in the wild so it has limited usage opportunities. 
---
nah, wasn't gunna bother arguing, its pointless. people who cheat constantly claim unfair bans.
---
How would it add gp to the game in the first place..?
---
For quidamortem? They're directly south of the xeric raid spot. You can find all konar task locations on the wiki 
---
that's a totally unrelated issue, that guy got banned in the early stages of jagex touch pad testing. 
---
“Let me address 1 of your points only.” 
---
Is hydra boss afk? No. Do people skip it? No. You’re just failing to address the fact that drakes are a shitty task in every aspect, not just that you can’t afk them. 
---
You don't DH until like base 90s basically. Until then the best set up is full obsidian, zerker neck, obby sword method. 
---
But wouldnt it be better as a item so u can use it to tele from anywhere instead of needing to go to ur poh first? 
---
Your point is to give content creators a chance, but that's literally what he did? Why comment this lmao
---
\&gt;You snag the trip wire as you step over it.
---
\&gt;You have been cancered!
---
Neat, for whatever reason I can’t do it after 4... I’m by no means a bad gamer either just don’t have runescape mechanics down apparently.
---
Duped max cash stacks? Hacked accounts? Trimmed armor?
---
Obviously only Rick knows, because he'd been banned if he'd been caught...
---
So unless you want to have a completely dreadful gameplay experience you need to level up agility first.
---
That's not very healthy game design.
---
Add to that that most people dislike agility, it makes even less sense to not have rest.
---
The coin pouch ruins immersion and world-ish-ness for me.
---
In medieval times, they fucking handed each other COINS. Not waved their debit cards at a scanning thing and have the exact amount magically deducted from elsewhere...
---
there was a reason for it surprisingly, it was because damage can be delt in 0.\_\_ . but however, rounding showed the damage as 0, even if it hit for 0.4 damage. although small, there was a reason. if all damage was x10ed, then how could damage hit in the ones place? not saying i'd like it in osrs, just more of a... fun fact then anything.
---
So rest button = game ruined because you can sit down to regenrate run energy slightly faster than by walking. Ok.
---
2002-2011 and 2015 until now. 
---
Hahahaha what cunt? You dug yourself a hole by saying its literally useless and tried throwing in some shit about iron-man but that didn't work so you're trying this out now? Git the fuck outta here son
---
I agree, I don’t mind the QoL but don’t poll to change something that nobody has complained about.
---
Well i am 6'4
---
Kitty looks sad :c 
---
This is about where I stand. I don't get why it matters unless it would change up the wildy game, which I doubt it would then you'd drop coins from your pouch I would imagine..? 1 hr death time, death literally means nothing anyways. I'd be pro coin pouch because I simply don't get why not? What's it matter? Save me a bank space unless I'm going to wildy.
---
I think they’re slowly just debuffing runelite from major content, why, idk. 
---
I never said it's useless? I said it's less useful than potions and full graceful.
---
Yeah, so i put my dragon pick in my toolbelt and i can safely no item in the wildy for example. Its super "useful" for knife, hammer, needle chisel etc but its super overpowered in a sense. Idk, to me people just dont want it because they got 99/200m the "hard" way..
---
Please dont ever kill hill giants and bury the bones as a member. There's an infinite amount of better solutions to just make some quick gp and buy d bones.
---
Why would you ask reddit, how are we supposed to teach it over text instructions? I swear half of the new posts in 2007scape are just people looking for any excuse to post something to reddit
---
haha xd 
---
No you didn't, you said it was worse than just walking wherever you're going and using the replenished run energy... which is correct. So why do we need it cluttering up every path between kingdoms if it's quicker to walk?
---
If that’s the case, they should have just said no to the Chamber of Xeric plugin like they did with Zulrah.
---
You will try. 
---
Gollum eyes and the nice tids 
---
Nice dude. People are dieing. But karma though eh. 
---
clans charge 32-44m for a torso carry. Assuming by the post, you dont have that type of GP. Just learn it, I'm sure you can do it, it is pretty straight forward.
---
Improving ability =/= making things possible. 
---
Yeah ive been massing harralander on my ironman so I could start using mine. Are there any other instances were a salamander would be good?
---
Just use dragon fire shield I still can’t see the animation 
---
Pro: cant buy votes by using bonds on fresh accounts
---
inventory management and item risk is part of the whole feel of osrs. coin pouch and other people keep saying about the tool belt is just not the style jagex and 99% of osrs players are aiming for, i personally wouldnt want it because i appreciate the need for inv management etc
---
Would being able to equip items straight from your bank make this RS3?
---
Not worth 30m just do the grind. It's worth it. Not worth wasting gp made when you can get it without wasting gp
---
Where the heck have you been.
---
Or maybe have as an additional requirement 200M in at least 6 skills
---
Who even wants resting. Stamina pots are way stronger. Resting doesn't belong in the game as it was designed because it would be shit.
---
I mean i know what todo, its just not having a team.. I read the tut and watched videos. I get whats going on but ive sat in the barbarian assault server in wave 1 room and nobody picks me up, and if they do someone leaves half way thru or some stupid bs. I just want people todo it with. 
---
You're thinking of musicians, resting is simply sitting down. There isn't any cluttering happening. Resting is more enjoyable for me since it's more afk than walking, that's the whole reason.
---
It doesn't make sense to poll a lot of the balance questions, players don't look at it from the perspective of the health of the game, they look at what can make their life easier. 
---
Sounds like something an RS3'r would want
---
what ring are you wearing
---
What’s wrong with not having to carry gp on you to pay for shit like farmers and charters? Idiots. You don’t mind runelite and all your fancy plugins, but the ability not to have to carry gp perplexes you?
---
&gt;Resting doesn't belong in the game as it was designed because it would be shit.
---
Resting was in the fucking game for 3 years b4 eoc and plenty of people used it.
---
You're mother should have paid for the abortion
---
Since he's been able to lamp construction he bought a house before starting the series.
---
Ah I actually didnt know this. I knew rounding was a thing, but I thought 0 was always 0. Either way, yeah keep it how it is lol.
---
They're probably just going to lower the render distance or add black space that they send to the client in the instance.
---
Except Stamina Potions were supposed to be a replacement for Resting.
---
Still makes no sense for the minority to dictate the game, its always the same argument aswell "here comes eoc 2.0" they haven't changed the combat formula and don't intend to as far as im aware
---
Be nice he thought this was his moment to shine on this sub :/
---
If I'm not near a bank and need to use a tele that I don't have, I'd have to run to the closest bank and search for it then it also takes up an extra slot in my inv. Or I just carry a stack of house tabs where I can 1 click to my house, everything I need is in one spot and they don't run out of charges.
---
Why would you pay 21m for an eternal glory when you can mount a normal one in your house for next to nothing. 
---
I still don’t understand why people watch skill specs 
---
Raids will lose the “r” if it passes. 
---
Why do u think the glory holds its value?
---
Can't believe you're doing barrows with an addy kite and mith armour! I look forward to your videos and am excited for you to hit 100k subscribers!
---
Wtf?
---
Stumbled upon Verf the other day. Legit series, but Settled's excitement is too infectious
---
You use 1-2 restores assuming no terrible hits with bow. 
---
Meanwhile you only bring 2-3 restores (2 if you aren't using void) on a solo. So that's pretty much all your restores right there. 
---
RuneScape wasn't a game. It was a community.
---
Don’t worry about those battlestaves friend, I got a guy in Varrock that deals them on the cheap!
---
My point exactly, nice addendum sir 
---
U that worried about karma??
---
TaKe A sCreEnShOt
---
All your down votes say otherwise hmm
---
I do think there should be some progression of gear in order to make it more worthwhile to do. I think the majority of the incentive to do the tasks comes from the allure of having the best possible gear in game, regardless of whether or not it's even worth it in the long run. If it takes long enough to obtain it, it wouldn't even decrease the amount of time it takes to get to level 99. 
---
I'll pass on whatever you're smoking. 
---
I learned solely on mobile, got from 0-270KC in the last couple weeks, I honestly found it easier on mobile

No, like they aren't socialist, full stop. They have a large "social safety net" but they aren't socialist. They are a social democracy not democratic socialists.

*complains about RS being too easy*

*uses an OSRS 3rd party client that tells you everything, borderline cheating in some instances*
---
Gotta love the logic of this community. 
---
Downvoted for something so outside the spirit of osrs.
---
???? Why would you ever not use stamina potions even IF resting was implemented? I feel like most of the posts here don't even know what resting does.
---
Oh you mean like the rune pouch that was added oh what about the herb sack or coal bag or gem bag or seedicide or bonecrusher you guys are fucking idiots

Good updates:
---
-Cerberus. Good, balanced drop table, takes a reasonable amount of time to get there, solid mechanics, etc.
---
-Inferno. Fantastic use of game mechanics and a fitting, untradeable reward.
---
-Blast Mine. Fills a niche within the mining skill. Gives money, but somewhat less xp than existing high intensity zero profit methods like 3t granite
---
-MM2 and DS2. Great quests. Good rewards. Nothing to dislike (except for Vorkath's drop table)
---
-Deadman. Incredible transformative game-mode that resulted in some of the most fun I've ever had in game. Generates a lot of attention for the game as well, and the finals are consistently exciting.
---
Bad Updates:
---
-Zulrah. Love the boss, but quite possibly the worst drop table in rs history. Had to be rebalanced multiple times, completely fucked up teleports, has uniques that are literally some of the best weapons in the entire game (blowpipe may be THE best weapon in the game) that are worth absolutely nothing because of how farmable it is. Started the trend of consistent gp bossing through alchables and resource drops which I really disagree with.
---
-Rooftop agility. Good in theory, but completely and utterly devalues every other course in the game. Makes stuff like ape atoll dead content for no reason. Existing courses had to be buffed to be comparable. Very boring with little interesting mechanics and theming compared to existing agility courses (Dorg, Agility Arena, werewolf, ape atoll, etc.)
---
-NMZ + 6 hour splashing not getting nerfed sooner. Stupid that they ever let this get to a poll. The former also did the extra damage of taking people out of other big combat training spots in the game, and created a ton of max accounts that you could get 99s on in your sleep.
---
-Not fixing death mechanics yet.
---
-Lots of QoL I can't think of off the top of my head but just various things that have added up over time.
---
Gotcha, thanks for replying.
---
Correct. So my original point.. that you replied to. Is that adding resting as it was originally designed simply isn't worth it for anyone outside of btw's because it's simply put shit. Staminas are cheap as hell and better in every way.
---
That’s a lotta gold
---
At 60+ agil, walking + natural regen was more efficient than resting. It really is just a tool for newer players and for people to have a comfy sitting emote.
---
Since when? If that's true then why are there bots that are built to buy out items from shops. Ore bots, Battlestaff Bots, Etc. ?
---
&gt; prevents government tyranny
---
You're off your rocker, mate.
---
Yeah fuck anything that makes the game easier. I like runelite though. That’s okay. 
---
You say the game loses what little challenge it had by removing inconvenience. So to you the challenge of runescape is partly walking in between running on long trips. I don't know chief, that don't seem like a challenge to me. But you know what does? The inferno. Guess what, one of the most challenging challenges in this game would still be just as hard with a rest button, a toolbel and lodestones(note: I am not for lodestones). You do not remove challenge by introducing convenience.
---
They should rename Runescape 3 to something else and just call OSRS "Runescape". RS3 is not Runescape. It's some failed attempt at WoW in your browser.

Right, it's the biggest hypocrisy point in the community. People will outright refuse to play without all the client advantages that they feel they *deserve*, and it's been that way since Orion in 2014. 
---
The only client in history that got anywhere near the amount of community support was swiftswitch and swiftkit, but they were also against the TOS for much less severe reasons than clients nowadays that play the game for you.

---
Excuse me sir but can you SUPERSIZE my D Long for me? 
---
I agree
---
staminas arent cheap as hell. And if it isn't "just for BTWs", it's also for f2p players, as well as players who don't play runescape as much as your regular redditor and value their time being spent on other things than agility.
---
Resting wouldn't make agility, graceful or staminas obsolete, it would simply make pre-graceful less dreadful.
---
This is peak normie
---
Wouldn't terror dogs in Tarn's Lair work once he has the requisite slayer level?

actually it's because it sucks ass and not a lot of people play both, most are on osrs

How do you think that even makes sense?
---
I have 2 glorys in my poh 1 on wall and 1 in jewellery box i also have a eternal glory in bank, im also maxed so i dont need to spend money on skilling i guess the eternal glory becomes more useful the further u are in the game for a quick tele sort of item where u dont really want to travel to ur poh to tele and u can do it in the bank / anywhere u are 
---
"imo kill your series a little. It would made for no viewers" 
---
Idk but I’m from Texas and I love it 
---
And we need to see Settled take one on. 
---
It’s still stupid. As a maxed main who hasn’t done raids at all I think scouting is nice because who wants to do content that isn’t fun or rewarding and just aids? Makes no sense. This is how dead content is created 
---
What came up in stream was resting, not the other things.
---
They stack up 1 by 1 for you until a minute passes then it appears as a stack to everyone else
---
Why are you so fucking far away 
---
Yeah rs3 death's can cost you anywhere between 100-200k if you were in basic gear up to 3-4m (or even up to 10 if you were skulled but died a pvm death) if you're in BIS gear.
---
&gt; Yes, why isn’t it a nuisance? It’s an annoying part of the game that we all deal with at some point or another.
---
Walking is the default. Running is for when you have energy to spare. Are you actually being serious? *Walking* is too much for you to handle?
---
&gt;And stop talking like nothing stupid in RS annoys you.
---
I appreciate a lot of the annoyances, nuances, and oddities. They're charming, and working with them is rewarding. I don't know how many weeks you've been playing the game, but if you know the game's past, you'd understand that when you remove every inconvenience in RS, you're left with almost nothing. The entire game is based on dealing with small obstacles and annoyances, and when you streamline something too much, something else becomes a worse annoyance, and things become faster, easier, less fun, and less rewarding, because you're no longer overcoming anything.
---
I hope you never get to see what I mean, but it has happened, and it ruins the feel and flow of the game.
---
Oh really? So it’s completely different than dropping. Different mechanic , got it. Thanks
---
Imagine being this big of a baby.

Oh yes.

Usually people just give away location here or in their cc :P
---
Agreed 100%. I'm very happy with OSRS in its current state, but 2011-scape would have been ideal for me.
---
With the second point, you should also consider the other side. Prevents noobs from accidentally losing their cash stack. 
---
I think you're right though, people just want it for immersion and nostalgia. And because they dont want a direct ripoff from rs3 
---
Yeah I like both and actually prefer rs3 but there are definitely a lot of things from rs3 that should never be added to osrs. Even pretty small things like toolbelt and coin pouch
---
Isent that dark souls on the computer though

Almost all of those are the the opposite of what's going on in this thread. I'm asking for one monster that can be completed on multiple different assignments. Skotizo is the only one you've listed that works, since it can be completed on either a Greater Demon or a Black Demon task. Good find.

So what insight do you have to offer, OP? Anything more than just "RS3 BAD, IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT RS3 WITHOUT SHITTING YOURSELF IN ANGER YOU SHOULD ALCH YOURSELF IRL"

Or are you just on the bandwagon? Can you give even a single reason for why these features are bad? I know why I don't like tool belts/coin pouches, and it's not because RS3 has them.
---
BTW Leprechauns are literally just tool belts for Farming and Graceful (which didn't exist in 2007) is literally just Rest but locked behind a shitty unfun grind that nobody likes, yet this sub's never up in arms about those.
---
Wish more people would understand this. As someone who has been playing since 2007, I've seen the game change over time. OSRS is a breath of fresh air - not just a hit of nostalgia, but a damn fun game in its own right, precisely BECAUSE things take longer.
---
The journey is long, but the rewards are... well... more rewarding because of it. 
---
People are complaining about the graceful grind, as well. Took me a week. They respond with "A week isn't a short amount of time," well of course not, why should it be? Why should any reward in *OSRS* of all games be a quick hit of dopamine, and instant gratification? That's what RS3 exists for.
---
Unfortunately, this sort of thinking is considered "elitist," so whatever.
---
I'll clarify some things here.
---
The login "email" doesn't need to be a legit email address. The login "email" is just a login username in an email format (throw in '@' symbol). I can even have ilovedrake@music if I wanted to. Your registered (recovery) email will be important, active one.
---
You can create another account modash@twitter can tie that account to the same registered email.
---
To answer your question, no one else can use "ilovedrake@music" as his account login anymore because the login "email" uniquely identifies an account.
---
Hope this helps! :)
---
Not even mentioning Rooftop agility and graceful set, and Motherlode Mine which osrs has but rs3 doesn't, which undeniably makes training agility and mining easier. And again, THAT exception is ok, but god forbid Jagex add a QOL update like resting that is literally less efficient than every other method of run recovery, it'll devalue my stamina pot only ironman!
---
Jesus fuck it looks like you’re the one who got scammed here
---
And I as a skiller (btw) would go and neck myself since I would need to get to back chins.
---
If good person means idiot then sure
---
I'd recommend joining one. It's nice to have  group you can easily ask questions of, find groups to do stuff with, or just talk to.
---
Ugly
---
I don't even play osrs, but I'm constantly waiting for that new vid notification pop-up on my phone
---
Helps Very Much! Thank you!
---
Was refraining from making a members purchase due to this but now I will.
---
:)
---
i wish this could be at the top lmao
---
Yep, that's a good one that I couldn't think of. I don't think there are any other ones, though. 
---
1648 myself after starting in November, 1250 is definitely not too high.
---
Got any recommendations? :P
---
He even had the ‘moms credit card setup’ of BCP and Dlegs, that’s fantastic. 
---
Vevezuela isn't socialist then either my man. As well 76% of all non household wealth is owned by the gov in Norway. If venezuala is socialist Norway sure as hell is going by whatever criteria you are using.
---
That was why I ended up enjoying it so much. Had no1 to play with and to get pubs you had to learn how to key. Once you got the hang of keying it was such a fucking fun skill
---
Sure you would make money. Doesn't make it efficient in any way, not sure how you don't get that lol.
---
I usually skill while watching movies or playing other games, depending how afk the skill is. But it really isn’t hard to get the skills required for quests as they don't need to be insanely high for the most part. Just setting yourself goals every week or so is useful in everything you want to progress in anyway. Highly recommend. Who knows, some things might grow on you - I sometimes do several quests in a row just to find out what happens, or I get used to the rhythm of training skills like runecrafting or agility (I used to hate training those more than anything in the game). All in all, it really depends on what you’re trying to achieve, but you might just go beyond once you get used to doing things you’re repulsed by.
---
You're probably right. Stick with what you know, Settled. You're a snowflake. Keep it that way.
---
according to wiki you dont fail against master farmers at 99 thieving, pretty much the only npc ive ever wanted to thieve from, so whats your point?
---
I would love musicians being a reward for completing achievement diaries or some sort of community tasks. Like you helped the town become more lively and the reward is little points of interest where you can restore your run energy more because of it.
---
That's not quite what's being asked here. What is needed is one monster that can be completed on multiple tasks (you've given the inverse, one task that can be completed by killing 2 or more monsters). Skotizo is the only example I can think of, as this can be done as either a greater demon or a black demon task.
---
Ninja, obviously.
---
This is why I was shocked when the KQ head poll passed, but I already knew that it was coming when they made the Vorkath head auto acquire on KC 50. 
---
A bit different to earn a bag than to just get a toolbelt and coin pouch. You can also lose those if you die. 
---
Im not fully against those if the community says yes. Just personally prefer this way. Most games these days try to get rid of anything that involves thinking and Im glad osrs isnt completely in that boat.
---
I know a lot of people probably liked when they changed keys to be available to everyone on pickup for for me it really dampened it. Back when you actually had to coordinate your teleports and keys and players with various high levels in different skills it was a blast. 
---
/rwoosh
---
Fun fact, these pictures are from 2016
---
yeah, so?
---
In the wilderness, yes, but only for the coins you have deposited. Realistically though, the death mechanic in OSRS is inferior to RS3's right now.
---
RS3 still has graves (with smaller timers than osrs, without other people blessing your grave), but you have the choice to claim your items back for a fee (proportional to your items) without having to go to your grave and your items will degrade when you receive them back (regardless if you paid the fee or went back). i.e. it's a money sink unlike OSRS at the moment, and the fee system is useful if you are lazy (e.g. rage quit) or if you disconnect
---
With their system in place, having your coins with you at all times is some-what necessary.
---
Yup. i don't know the solution to the death problem. free for all sounds good, but we know it doesn't work.
---
These opinions are so hypocritical, it's almost like they're being said by different people, but taking that into account would make it much harder to paint hundreds of people with the same brush, all in the name of making myself sound more correct, so I'm gonna go ahead and not take that into account. Sarcastic btw
---
ONE PUNCH MAAAAAAAAAAAAN
---
I fucking hate walking and running. Can we poll a QoL update for the players to get a Rotten Potato so we can just teleport around RS? 
---
Do tell me how does one get 500k xp/h on agility, then i might actually get 99 agi
---
If you're afk and not always there to move to the next vein, it makes much more sense to use an empty spot.
---
Just get higher agility
---
PB is currently 2:50, 83 range
---
You’re trying to appeal it? So you’re saying you don’t deserve a perm mute? Thats literally what you’re inciting. 
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Torso is super garbage in defense. I honestly dont get people who say that defense is irrelevant, while they bank 3-4 times on an abby demon task.
---
Because we want Agility to be useful and provide benefits for leveling it up. With resting the difference in run ability between 70 Agility and 99 Agility is basically nothing. 
---
Besides, we already have infinite run energy for very cheap. There's really no need to make it free and hurt Agility even more by butchering profit from marks.

We spawn in lumby and most of us start off by murdering an innocent man or woman just minding their own business. You wouldn’t put it past our adventurers to kill a dog for shit and grins?

I thought playing osrs was bis time travel by itself. 
---
This would be pretty awesome 
---
I'm curious why people are against toggles. I am intrigued
---
Let's bring politics into a gaming subreddit by taking a joke the way you'd take a dick. 
---
Not for melee, unless I'm mistaken. Melee is pretty much all I do, lol
---
Hey, take your most expensive item, and alot of other random crap, to a high level boss instance, with me, a complete stranger! And ill pay you a shitload of cash for stuff thats not worth it, cant scan ya, look it up on youtube! **gets scammed** Oh boi i didnt see that comming!! Watch out guys!
---
they should nerf it because its extremely overpowered.
---
It could just be right click to examine, the same way normal objects are left click to move and right click to examine.
---
Take a sink for example, you can left click through/on them, but the examine is always right click only.
---
Also, I had some ideas for the bosses attacks which I didn't include in the image.  
---
1. While in his melee distance, he will attack with his spear. (Melee attack)  
---
2. When you are not in his melee distance, he will throw rocks at you. (Ranged attack)  
---
3. He can summon groups of goblins. The more goblins there are, the higher their max hit is, so you must keep their numbers down by killing them or else you will die quickly. (Basically Adds)
---
Stam. Pots cheap? When?
---
I don’t have fuck you money.
---
Your herbs want to die
---
Fyi running is the default.  Most higher level players don't ever actually walk anywhere with graceful, high agi, and stams.
---
it just makes sense tho, this is 100% what i expected the perk to be when i got it, its a firemaking cape for crying out loud, and i cant make a fire with it?  it would be probably more useful than the lightsource perk now even tho i like that one
---
Yes please
---
If you arent doing it with a group of people that know exactly what they are doing, its a waste of supplies.
---
Hold up, these things are all real things that devs are actually considering? I thought they were just memes
---
Are you willing to do a trade in? I have a banana peel if you are interested??
---
I disagree that it'd be dead content, more of a niche item for certain uses. Of course it wouldn't replace Anguish or Torture for most things. 
---
Dude you said white supremacists don't exist, then immediately said there are Jewish people who believe in supremacy as either "ruling over" or "being superior to". So it seems like the only forms of white supremacy you believe in is Jewish, which is fucking retarded. You hate non whites and include Jews in that as well. 
---
After doing the evil Dave part of recipe for disaster, you can use your cat to kill hell rats to get these spices. Each color boosts a different set of skills. You add 3 doses to a stew and drink the stew and it can give you anywhere from -5 to +5 for a skill
---
What game changing content does the desert elite provide? The KQ shortcut? The shortcut is there for people who want to kill the boss. The head is a nice boost to make your pet grind more convenient. You do not NEED the convenience of the shortcut, it’s a nice bonus, as it should be. The boss is no harder or easier if you get there 60 seconds faster. All the other desert perks are outclassed by better content, even the water skin portion is circumvented by increased HP règen.
---
The diary serves to help those who already plan to kill KQ for the pet or fun. That’s the only good thing KQ is for, the pet. So no, it’s not game changing content that’s locked behind the Diary. Game changing content is being able to scout raids with a third party client. Not using a third party client literally changes the way that end game content, raids, are completed. The Desert elite diary is not game changing content in the slightest. It’s meant to be a nice boost in convenience, nothing more.
---
Be wary of any suggestion that starts with a positive descriptor. The speaker is trying to sell you something, much like a used car salesman.

So the farming guild contracts came about due to a design I was working on currently going by the name of ‘The Otherwordly Merchant’. Essentially a D&amp;D version of Artisan where a merchant would appear randomly around the world (similarly to how implings do) and offer a range of tasks varying in level and skill for each of the 5 gathering skills. These would be limited, only a handful of players would be able to claim a certain task. The reward for completing a contract would depend on how many others had already competed it, so the first to finish would be greatly rewarded.
---
However, Farming fit into this quite awkwardly. You may not have the necessary seed and the time it takes to complete could be extended through no fault of your own (diseased plants etc). Based on that, it seemed like a great thing to try out with the farming guild so I put forward the idea during the Kebos design week.
---
The unique rewards from the OM are also a little contentious and I don’t see them passing. Back when I suggested the dark spell book rework, there were spells that would boost the rate in which you gather resources (logs/ores/fish) and potentially note them. Such a useful thing being spellbook locked seemed like a bad idea based on feedback so I repurposed that idea by making them an item that would be equipped in the ammo slot - these would be the rewards from the OM. Interested in what everyone thinks about this design - the idea is to make resource gathering a bit more profitable and interesting. These new items (working title ‘Totems’) could also be dropped by monsters instead of pure resource much like the suggestion from a few years back called something like ‘resource boons’.

You’ve had to change because you’re permanently muted? If you weren’t permanently muted you’d still be the same old you most likely. People do change, I know that l, my first account was perm muted, I had to start fresh because perm muted was too unplayable.
---
You haven’t shown any evidence that it was unjustified or specified what it was for other than being immature, so of course I’m going to assume it was something that was worth perm muting, especially if you only had one prior mute. 
---
*Slaps roof of rest option*
---
Statistically it's super rare, 2x 1/512 drop rate in a 130kc task.
---
Yeah this isn’t about you. Congrats OP
---
Rest would be nice 
---
Osrs players already have bobs, called alts/supply alts lol.
---
Also the meta has shifted a ton vs things like godwars bosses. You probably last longer or just as long at godwars bosses in osrs as you did in rs2/pre eoc.

The submenu is literally called "RuneLite", so just go inside it in sidebar

if i am on task is slayer helm(i) better or ranger void?
---
Too much engine work 
---
it is in official client
---
Because that's one of its only uses. It's a useful skill, so train it. What's your problem? It sounds like you just don't like the game.
---
go back to RS3 please, ty
---
Same problem for me with the servers, went from 12 to 254 ping overnight
---
You can probably do zulrah at 80 and 80 with trident and blowpipe. Though kills will be slow, 3-5 mins which isn’t ideal.   
---
Magic is super important, so work on that skill/equipment first. 
---
Not a fan of that idea of oldschool. Not game ending or anything, just not needed imo.
---
To add on to this make sure your slayer helm is imbued when you do the task for the 15% accuracy bonus
---
Yup. 
---
There's a reason people tell Serene to shut up.
---
Vorkath head being auto acquire on KC 50 was an excellent decision. 
---
Well if you look at the size of Grubtoe, maybe he could drop a giant goblin mail, and when you try to equip it... it will say "It's too big to fit humans!"
---
Like literally the easiest task in the game? Enter the cave north of the Freminek Fairy ring and slay out my dood?
---
Devalues my iron gloves only hcim.
---
good update: farming guild.
---
bad update: zulrah's droptable. Drops were too good and I hate venom.
---
I was thinking that as well, would be the ultimate tease.
---
Oh rad. Well regardless I'm gonna be using Barrows for the foreseeable future because I'm broke af and dont have 80 atk/def, but that's still awesome that the new gloves aren't just an outright upgrade
---
You won't require the other ones ever. Keep in mind if you happen to get PK'd or die and lose your only defender, you'll have to reacquire it starting from Bronze.
---
If you toss the addy in your bank, and lose the rune, you'll just have to get the rune back. 
---
No Drive &amp; Play?
---
keep the addy for now till u can wield dragon then drop that and keep rune/dragon thereafter
---
I think the meta is to start ardy at 86 or 87 using summer pies with prayer items and preserve.
---
As if it was ever a question.. 
---
The complaints against these features are often asinine. People are fine with runecrafting tiaras, the rune pouch and wielding tools for mining and woodcutting, but a tool belt would apparently kill the game. 
---
There’s also a complete lack of thought that goes into any of this from the detractors. A tool belt could easily have its slots scale with something like quest points. Every 50 points you get to add another tool, etc.
---
I get it, you’re all scared of EZScape, or so you claim. Except grinding isn’t difficult, it just takes time. Very important distinction. Most people play this game AFK - that’s not anything close to being difficult. People are so dense they literally so no to things just because they were in RS3, as if every single feature in that game was the reason for its downfall. Learn some nuance people. 
---
Easy but slow as hell.
---
The fact that people even think things like this say a lot about the world. So desensitized and calloused. 
---
So do clans still mass report advertisers and get them banned? I was thinking of asking a friend to advertise for me to test the waters before I go and buy a bond for my alt to advertise, but I don't want to get my buddy banned...
---
The first thing I said when I read it is "who asked for this?"
---
beating women haha
---
Good on you man!
---
You heard the man, no more criticising people for copy pasting responses.
---
I wanted to use my battle staffs from wyverns, so I needed to charge orbs. To charge orbs I needed cosmic runes. To do that efficiently atleast (and orb charging) I needed stamina pots. To get stamina pots I needed 77 herblore if I didn't want to boost. To do that I really needed to use my lantadymes. To do that without losing my sanity I needed 70 agility to use the shortcut to blue dragons. To save time on that I needed to do the hard kandarin diary. To do that...you get the idea.

Same issue in rs3.
---
It's a universal problem.
---
Not really dude, pretty average basic task.
---
Drops are kinda poop, I dunno how they weigh against Konars table or whatever, I've done 180 greater demons and about 20 black demons and haven't gotten a drop yet, so maybe the lower combat monsters arent quite worth doing.
---
But trolls aren't a skip in my opinion
---
Personally I like to put it in agility as it's also slow to train, is less afk than zmi or zeah runecrafting and makes less profit.
---
Dang that's a good line up, might have to get one of those for myself. Thanks for the info.
---
He could alch the armour after it has depleted. Might seem like a stretch but that would keep the account more 'pure'.

Seems you got news mixed up with politics, a topic can be discussed without taking sides you know, then again, maybe you don't. You are truly the epitome of a joyless militant cunt who has to politicize everything. 
---
Not gold bars, gp. As for the rest of it I’m as stumped as you are. That area does seem glitchy as hell and I wonder how people even figure out about these glitches...
---
It’s not that I don’t like it, I think it just sounds like a good mini game or other event. Actually would be a fun mini game or task style activity that grants xp to other skills like you stated but without itself being a skill. I’m no expert on what players would or wouldn’t like though so don’t take my word for it :)

Unlocking fairy rings isn't hard, but you could also use the skills necklace to farming guild.
---
Some people I see on here do have skillcapes in suffering.
---
Does this interrupt though?
---
Yeah but they're reporting actual incidents so I doubt anything would happen to your account. Most likely would just raise more red flags to see one certain account getting reported over and over. I mean if someone is reporting someone 30 times in an hour and I'm a Mod I'm most likely going to check that out quicker then the other reports whether it be fake or real reports.

Its being routed through Hong Kong.

I think their reasoning might have been that bosses are hard to kill and regular monsters aren't. Therefor KQ and Vorkath have guaranteed drops and regular lizardmen don't.

I agree the 1 KC would make more sense than 50, for the guaranteed drop. The main difference between this BiS cape and the others is reacquiring. Can't make you complete ds2 again, so they made it a drop so you couldn't just reacquire it for free after getting pked.
---
potions never interrupt combat if its a single dose

Maybe he was in lumbridge swamp after. 
---
The downside was that you can’t retrieve your items from it anymore, sacrificing 4m or however much dragon pick axe is to have it stored would be too much for quite a lot of people.
---
And no offence but your point is completely invalid, QoL changes are essentially time savers. Hey that thing was a ball ache so we’re going to make it EASIER so that it’s not so much of a ball ache.
---
I don’t want this tool belt update either, but the osrs community needs to get off their high horses and stop saying it’s due to not wanting things to be “EZscape”. There are so many things that have come out that make the game straight up easier, and just because you like one EZscape change and not another doesn’t make one more game integrity damaging.
---
The tool belt update would be a QoL, and I’m not against is because it would make the game easier, I’m against it because it would lose the integrity of skilling.

So, as the title says, i escaped f2p last week and have been exploring a bit and doing some quests. But it is all way too overwhelming for me, i just have no idea where to start or what goals to aim for.
---
A lot of people mention questing and slayer, which i tried a bit and i will be doing a lot more quests in the time available. But i would like to work a bit to earn a little money.
---
I already have a bond, bought 2 before going members because i saw this coming lol, but i would still need to find a way to make more money in the future.
---
As much as flipping helped in f2p i never got a rewarding feeling from it. But going out of my way to earn money either through combat or other skills is rewarding. So if anybody would know a way to do so, that would help immensely!
---
Yeah this just makes more sense all around. Make a redwood fire at current location with no logs. It wouldn't be a big deal. I don't know anyone who ever brings a tinder box and logs to cook raw food while pvming. I doubt people would ever care enough to do this. It's just better to bring food.

People don't really want content added from RS3 into OSRS. The inconvenience of forgetting something and going back to the bank is what OSRS has been all about rather than having something conveniently stashed permanently in your belt / icon for you easily access. There's always something they can tweak or change in order to make things more optimal rather than simply copying and pasting the same idea which many people didn't like in the first place.

Members? Not much. Rcb and broad bolts at 70 ranged I managed 5 kills in a trip. 
---
Yeesh these people have no sympathy for extreme dryness. For the record you were statistically in the top 1% of driest players, there is about a [1% chance of going this dry.](https://imgur.com/a/36TGC0z)
---
This sounds soooo good
---
Rs3 players should stick to that shit and not ruin our game
---
It would literally break the game and render it unplayable /s
---
or.. make him summon zuks and basically multiple shields so you need to also be good at inferno to get the goblin gloves (just trying to make my hardcore ultimate no run lumbridge only range only iron arrow only no gp use only ironman revalued)
---
Yes you'll be at a massive disadvantage, if you're any good you'll still be able to 1 tick with bad ping(assuming you already know how to), the issue will rather be being able to eat in time since your clicks register slow.
---
My advice, go do wintertodt till 99
---
it’ll take 3-4 days, you’ll get a good few woodcutting fletching and construction levels, your first 99 cape and even if your luck isn’t the best you’ll still make a good 5m+ 
---

Had to be me haha, thanks for your comment!

woah careful saying you want what rs3 has around here that's some risky business 
---
Drinking a antidote doesn't interrupt combat either does it? At least when I blowpipe big drag I don't seem to lose gameticks when I drink a antidote
---
Level 70 slayer isn't coming any faster with that attitude! Good luck (:
---
Craws bow is mainly used for wildy slayer, an activity that a lot of high levels were doing before Hydra release. This is likely why the price sharply rose prior to the Hydra update and is now falling.
---
I'm also ready to vote on raids balancing &amp; drake fireballs
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ib6IDSn.png
---
I will look into that! 
---
That seems like a doable goal for now. Thank you
---
Drakes are a fine task, fine profit/fine level of interaction.  This isn't afkscape, new content sometimes requires you to be active at your pc.  If you don't like it block it or skip it.
---
This isn’t RS3. I don’t think many OSRS players want any of that..
---
Felt like a fucking visionary when I did this because I got the entire thing done without failing once
---
Np if you need any help with the minigame im not in the house atm but pm me ur rsn and i’ll teach u how to play and stuff?

iirc from doing ironman zulrah it doesnt work with lunars cure

Get your eyes checked bro

This is my favorite comment

You're right but atm this is what we have to work with and 2FA on the email would have stopped 90% of these recent hacks
---
Pls put one musician between barb village and falador ty
---
It's a stupid idea anyways won't pass. Don't get why they suddenly feel the need to add scrolls when everyone is so used to scouting. Ok maybe scouting takes a little longer but it's certainly faster than doing 1 raid with room u cbf with then do one without. Unless they gonna give 50 or so scrolls per drop.
---
Hahah yeah i know, its just that i've been running around and training these skills on and off, because i wanted to explore those skills.
---
Going for 1 skill in particular is indeed the way to go. And will probably my way once i get a hang of it all
---
Also an AOE damage effect for all the flying teeth
---
I went for 75 attack 75 strength and 75 def to be able to equip all, now I’m almost 75 99 75 with attack being next
---
btw tho
---
rc almost feels better though because at least its good gp, not great by any means and I would rather pvm but gp is gp
---
Nothing I suggested is even remotely close to how it exists in RS3 most of which is substantially different. The tool slot isn't even a set and forget way of doing it, if you'd been doing clues you'd still have to remember to change it to go karamja dungeon. What icon are you referring to? I didn't suggest there is a coin pouch. 
---
&gt; People don't really want content added from RS3 into OSRS
---
then why is 90% of content copy/pasted from pre-eoc/rs3?
---
Without the multi-core rendering that sounds possible. But with it that's surprising.
---
Ya but put it on the swamp if asshole ghost 
---
RS3 players are quitting their shit game and spamming OSRS Reddit to make it more like RS3
---
Hey
---
Haha! I get it. It's because these things are popular right now right? Funny meme! 
---
learn farming and start doing herb runs, unlock kingdom of miscellania, do varrock medium diary  
---
your mining is decent enough to start grinding MLM  
---
you could do Wintertodt to 99 firemaking  
---
you could do thieving to 91 via blackjacking  
---
Hunter can be very good

Newsflash: People’s opinions change
---
what would be a good way to get my stats up to 70? currently AFK at rock crabs with 50 base, but i want to b ea bit more engaged. Not sure if i should start doing slayer or if i can do anything else that would be kind of efficient.
---
This is probably something that might need to happen to make it feel like an actual achievement. If the gloves were tradable members would just farm the boss solo and crash the prices making it a freebie upgrade for non-membs.
---
Friend and I have started new ironmen. not gonna look at a guide or anything cause that's boring.
---
What are some good early goals? Currently rushed wintertodt but other than that not sure what to do.
---
because jagex would like to do that stuff to their own client but lack the time and resources.
---
when it crosses the line, jagex forces the client to remove the feature.
---
They just play in fixed mode with no stretch. 
---
I always look forward to tanzoo and virtoso's challenges, they have such a good dynamic and are so entertaining 
---
Exactly, just use runelite to show where you need to click and it's really easy to afk
---
Yeah if I remember there was that music npc you could listen too to rest.
---
Which seems pretty bullshit to me.
---
By all means I think they can adjust content without polling it, but hiding behind "QoL" is ridiculous.
---
Buffing and nerfing and changing mechanics entirely is not quality of life.
---
In fairness to Dungeoneering, I think without making it a skill, the same progression wouldn't be possible. Besides just the floors themselves, there were other bits and bobs that were locking behind a level which you wouldn't have got without it being a skill
---
devalues my I'm an ironman btw 
---
btw
---
Stop making Settleds account easier to progress it'll make it less interesting to watch.
---
And also bring back the shiny bottle that they used to have pre2007
---
My issue with RS3 is that its too complex and bloated. 
---
RS2 was fairly simplistic and very grindy...but I played it because that's what I enjoyed. If I wanted to play a more complex game, I would have found one. 
---
I mean just take mining as an example...in RS2 if you wanted to train mining, you could just equip a pickaxe, find some iron rocks and off you go.
---
Now look at the mining training guide for RS3....

Thank you for the options!

---
You should add Barrows to the list. It's amazing content and don't really need high stats for it. Plus, it can earn you a few mills on the side
---
&gt;the osrs community needs to get off their high horses and stop saying it’s due to not wanting things to be “EZscape”
---
What is the reasoning not to implement the tool belt then? You just said you didn't want it so please explain.
---
Yeah, there are definitely EZscape updates (Rooftop Courses?) but Jagex's OSRS team really does put a lot of effort into avoiding power creep whilst still providing interesting updates.
---
I've heard youtubers talk about these, dont know what they are and what they add, but i will look it up!
---
yeah agility and mining are more efficient to lamp. especially if you use runners at zmi.

Happy Cake Day!

They addressed this in the last Q&amp;A pointing out that the jugs are metal and the vials are glass so it wouldn't make sense.
---
YES FINALLY A BOSS THAT WON'T KICK MY ASS
---
Would a better change be to make KQ a little bit more rewarding and keep head drops the same? That way it wouldn't feel like as much of a waste of time
---
It's basically 'Do x in x area' and when you do all of them you get an xp lamp and rewards that have to do with that area.
---
Ardougne is a good one to do, for example. The easy ones are incredibly easy (Reqs are rune mysteries, biohazard, 15 fishing, and 5 thieving) and you get the Ardougne which is a decent prayer cape and provides unlimited teleports to the Ardougne monastary. 
---
They definitely need more f2p content 
---
if you do go WT make sure you purchase a POH from the Construction tutors so you can earn Cons XP from fixing braziers.
---
Anyone who wants these updates should go play rs3
---
I think with some bosses a more scaled approach to food/healing supplies would make them worth doing without disturbing the whole raid. Especially if someone wants to do vasa, van, vespula or something like that it should be viable to do them in a group with health supplies awarded.
---
This. Not that I agree with OP, but it's either both or none.
---
Cannon?
---
Yeah, but he is putting so many hours into it that it's kind of is a big deal. We only see the highlights, but he's spending tons of time to get those upgrades. I'd be pretty excited too if I finally got a drop after grinding all day.
---
Aah that seems like something that is kind of diverse, which i like. I'll check them out and see what achievements give some decent or convenient rewards!
---
Alright, I’ve given this a lot of thought and have come up with the perfect solution that will solve ur problem 
---
kys
---
Why? It would take a long time, cost a lot of money and resources. 
---
Including the fact that Reddit is more accessible for a large part of the community very easily. Plus you get a lot of free marketing with posts hitting the r/all page and popular page. Which definitely brought some players back to the game who saw it pop up on their feed suddenly.
---
And reddit works perfectly fine. Would be nonsensical and even a waste to improve the forums.
---
thanks obama
---
There is nothing on 47 prayer so I'm assuming you mean 43 for protect from melee
---
Thanks friend :)
---
I didnt know thay was neccesary, but if thats the way to go, i'll do that! 
---
It's shocking to me how many people think that 1250 total level is high. That's like a month of playing the game. Honestly I don't even know what requirements are there now, but maybe that's why everything just passes randomly, if people who play for 1 week can vote.
---
The specialty/pure/uim/pvp accounts argument doesn't make sense too. It's absurd anyway, that one person can have more than one vote by playing multiple accounts, this should not be the case. I guess this is partially the fault of the antiquated "Account" system, which forces you to create a new account for every single alt you make.   
---
One person should get one vote, and yes, they should have some basic knowledge about the game. I'm by no means an elite, I played OSRS for a total of maybe 5-6 months over a couple years and managed to get to 1700 ish total over that time. With this, I still lack knowledge about many dimensions of the game, that weren't there back in RS2.
---
Vulture capitalism at its best. 
---
This and the caveman only guy probably the best 2 series i like.
---
They should a little work on f2p, I think it's a good idea because of the mobile f2p players, if they get that far they have a cheeky taste of bossing
---
Not really, agility doesn't have any benefits to most players, other than the shortcuts. As Agility level does nothing when you are running and every player is going to have staminas/energy potions on them anyway. Except for early/mid game irons and very new players. So the run restoration aspect of agility is dead content to most.
---
I don't mind gating content when it makes sense, e.g. the story of the content/quest relies on something from another quest having already happened, but it's annoying when there are quest requirements that are completely unrelated.
---
I mostly get annoyed by skill requirements for quests that don't even use the skill, like the fremmy isles construction requirement (I know it's low but still). The worst for me is slayer requirements for anything. I don't understand why I shouldn't be allowed to kill something because my slayer level is too low, or even worse I'm just not on a task. What's the point? It's content lock for literally no reason. Quest slayer requirements are the same. Why shouldn't I just be able to kill the thing from the quest??
---
So to answer my question since you didn't.
---
No, not you can't point to where he said the game wasn't AFK enough.
---
They're using code from 2007, everything was coded terribly back then, lol
---
Yeah it gives a good reason to train skills and do quests. I got 70 thieving specifically to do Western Province hard for elite void and crystal halberd
---
u/modmatk fire this man
---
Never attack back, just get out of there, use auto retaliate if you have to 
---
Honestly fuck off. Tired of this shitty attitude every time f2p is mentioned. It’s where people decide to become members. If they had more trial bosses or skills like this, the conversion rate would go up. Level 30s can’t kill Obor and Bryo so they don’t even have a concept of bossing and how cool it is in members. 
---
This guy puts time into creating a mock-up of it with a picture and description and you put zero thought into your comment on it. If you aren’t going to add value to the conversation, then don’t post at all. 
---
They legit re-used this, added monocle and hat and made it rarest pet. 
---
I do on mobile constantly
---
Thought it was just me. 
---
I'm not against the idea of having to kill the adds before the boss, but most other bossing in OSRS teaches you to ignore the adds and focus on the boss, and then when the boss is dead you target the adds (unless they despawn after boss is killed). In the fairly rare cases where you must kill the adds or some other entity, this is usually indicated by the boss being immune to damage until the adds are dead.
---
I'm thinking there must be some indicator to tell people to focus the adds, perhaps just a chat message about the goblins making Grubtoe stronger is enough, idk.

The technical answer is that their DDOS mitigation kicks in, and decides that a bunch of legit traffic is suspicous so it routes it through LA/LV. The real question is 
---
1. Why do AU worlds have this issue and NA/EU/UK don't and 
---
2. Why don't you have DDOS mitigation services in AU. 
---
turn off prayer reorder and then reload

Brawler gloves as in the double(?) XP gloves? No.

99 combats can be fully afked to 99 in a few weeks.

Sweet, thanks
---
just turn off prayer reorder and teleport. it fixed for me
---
Because I'm forced to to do certain quests.
---
The only other interaction I have with slayer is trying to kill things and being told I'm not allowed to.
---
its runelite not the game it's self, turn off prayer reordering and refresh
---
50/50
---
What does this even mean?
---
If you had a window over top of the minimap, it would click through? If so what instances would even prompt this to happen
---
Because that unifies people a lot less than trying to blame it on the "new players" lol.
---
These people are just salty they are in the minority for changes so they're looking for any excuse that would explain that.
---
 its runelite not the game it's self, turn off prayer reordering and refresh 
---
You definitely sound like the type of person that would *have* to buy a girlfriend anyways.

Also, them having a dragon defender still doesn't help you out at all unless I'm forgetting the EoC v2 update where you can combine attack bonuses from different accounts.

yeah i just noticed that, mb

I expected at least one weeb in this comment section.

Well I hate runecrafting, but I have to do it for certain quests, but I wouldn't want it made easy, because I know some people do enjoy runecrafting.

I got 60 agil and this trap never had been activated on me lol

I don't blame them for having it, it's a required thing for obvious reasons.

Just the fact that this only happens to the AU worlds, routing through completely different regions, as soon as they're touched.

I've made an image showing how potions across all 4 doses would look with OP's proposed change: [https://i.imgur.com/L2QBRth.png](https://i.imgur.com/L2QBRth.png)

Personally I really like the change. It definitely makes the 4-dose a lot more easily distinguishable from the 3-dose.
---
Read all of the 10 posts under your post. It's a Runelite issue.
---
weird flex but ok
---
I personally don't find slayer fun at all although I can see why people do. I don't think any of the incentives would be removed if you got rid of the restriction on killing things that you aren't on task for though?

If you clicked on the edge of the minimap (edge that's on the map in ur top right) it would open the map and make you run toward where you clicked which was super annoying

It's a Runelite setting. Turn off reorder quick prayer setting and then relog. Fixes it.

I don't think there needs to be any other argument against "players with thousands of hours know what's best"
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
They should really add this as an april joke or something
---
Yeah and that was a cool achievement. If jad was locked behind 70 slayer that would never have happened and what benefit would the game have from that?
---
What do you mean by redundant? Do you mean certain monsters just wouldn't make sense to kill?
---
As a non 85 slayer ironman, support 100%. Also make climbing boots BiS Jamflex pls
---
A better suggestion then would be to name the dogs.
---
Like in what way? Just wanting to cast a right vote lol
---
I'm still not quite understanding.
---
So the hitbox for the world map button was slightly too big, and spilled over into the minimap, so if you clicked too close to the map button on the minimap, it would open both?
---
I've never noticed this.
---
We're making jokes you autistic mong

Thanks!

Dude there's like 1 mil posts on the new update. Scroll down.

Goblin slayer EYES LIGHT UP*
---
Runelite issue not Jagex
---
thats usually only for some slayer specific dungeons or spots, so yeah.  Compare downstairs taverly blue dragons to the task only ones upstairs
---
Read those posts below you, don't blame Jagex. It's an issue on Runelite's client.  
---
Go to configuration, turn "reorder prayers" off and relaunch the client.
---
True, I should have gone with the black slits for eyes :D
---
Yeah haha
---
nice try Osbuddy PR
---
Yes! That way we can have Swampletics and UIM Karamja only work together!
---
While we're at it, lets make both of those locations underground!
---
But runecrafting is a skill that makes sense. You learn to craft runes and as you craft more runes you learn to craft better runes.
---
With slayer it's like learn to fight stuff (combat) then learn to fight stuff again for some reason (slayer).
---
If I have to make a certain type of rune to do a quest then cool I have to get the rc level for it. If I have to kill a certain monster why shouldn't I just be able to kill the monster without arbitrarily having to fight a bunch of specific other monsters in between?
---
Ah thanks

Terror dogs are their own task.

Yeah he should have trained to 126 combat before he entered it, maybe even maxed total while we are at it
---
Should have a darkbow as a grand prize for an exorbitant amount of tickets 
---
In hindsight, I think it's a bit harsh to make dragon darts the only viable ammo option. A base +20 ranged strength with doubled dart ranged strength might be better. 
---
This would give the blowpipe a ranged strength bonus of +34 with mithril darts (down from +47), adamant darts +40 (down from +50), rune darts +48 (down from +54 and about the same as bp with mith darts now) and dragon darts +60 (equal).
---
Because someone's opinion is different they're automatically wrong? 
---
1st. How do you do the quote thingy? Shit baffles me.
---
2nd. I’m at a loss for how “experience” is being equated to socioeconomic inequality...let alone race, or w.e. group you feel I’m going for next lol.
---
Basically, it’s a false equivalency. 
---
Lack of experience is not equal to having experience. Lvl 1 slayer should not have a say in issues that affect a level 95 slayer task. Not saying  only 95 slayer should be able to vote either, but some reasonable form of experience should be required (maybe there already is some idk). Mind you I’m not in that category and skip most poll questions that I’m not informed on. 
---
Note: I understand the we pay we say logic, I disagree. I’m ok with disagreeing. 
---
Equating how experience relates to income inequality or race, etc doesn’t make sense to me so if you have a logical train of thought for that equation please enlighten me. I’m all ears (eyes).

I got to 82 prayer there, I also learnt how to Pk there, and got pk’d while pking. I love chaos altar

Blast Furnace is an update from 2005. Before worlds where dwarves ran it, clans could. Anything where you have to pay several other players to do it will be expensive. 
---
Why does everything need to be fast just for the sake of being fast? RC has a fast and very expensive method being ZMI runners, cheap but still quite fast with Lavas, very slow but profitable with Astrals, Nats, Laws, Deaths etc., and even an AFK method that is a decent speed and makes money. If they can come up with something cool and interesting to train it, sure, why not. But just making it fast for speed's sake, no thank you. 
---
If you want non click intensive RC, do Bloods and Souls. And RC does make you tons of money. Is it as much as high level PvM? No, but it is still among the most profitable skills. Don't want to spend the time on RC - don't.

"Opponent information"
---
"Show Percent"
---
Harra then my ass in your face.
---
I'm for it, F2P needs a useful glove slot item.
---
Damn, he gave a pretty good estimate. 
---
&lt;3
---
Gonna wrap this up here and leave. GL progressing when you still think pray flicking only exists in inferno and not bandos, sara, DKs, LMS, etc. Stay away from poll booths.
---
Probably the quests. Most of the God-related quests released post-2007 are amazing from a lore perspective (While Guthix Sleeps, Temple at Senntisten, Ritual of the Mahjarrat, Fate of the Gods). I would also love to face Nomad himself again, instead of an (imho weak) substitute.
---
Thank you, it must be a glitch as toggling both options still displays the percentage.
---
Thanks again.
---
Support this.
---
50m total xp would be fucking gorgeous
---
That's why they should sell prims to get ferocious gloves and guardian boots
---
When he used infernal cape as a reasoning, I can might as well not debate with him
---
People blackout their name to avoid being hacked. Then there some people that black out 50% of the screen because they are memeing 
---
If you customize the shift click options to drink on shift click, yesv
---
It's been suggested before to make it more useful, your solution is probably the best idea I've seen. You would only really need 2 slots for it to be useful as well seems as PvM the only bolts worth using are ruby and diamond. 
---
Instead of adding the extra slots to the equipped screen you could also have it change bolts by right clicking it selecting the bolt to use.
---
F2P doesn’t need more content or time dedicated to it from the dev team. It’s fine the way it is. 
---
I know people who have gotten banned for it (they got reported for RWT, wheather they actually did it or not, I can't prove) but that shows that they do, or did within the last year, care about it
---
And also key quest items are mostly retreive able items that u can get back by talking to some random dude.
---
If you want people to buy membership forcing the, to experience one of the most important aspects of this game which is talking and interacting with players is needed. I’m surprised none of the previous bosses were able to be tackled as a team
---
You can block pussi destroyer when you receive a message of him replying to your comment
---
You are totally wrong. Do not discredit the extra attack bonus.  
---
For example, at the abyssal demons, you get extra +0.31% dps:

---
Also, if you are super combat or str pots, the extra str bonus keeps the max hit +1 on some of the levels between max poted level and your base str level. This averages out as +0.5 bigger max hit
---
Could you add a hay bale to the farm next to the ectofuntus? Throw Settled a bone please.
---
19 law runes! Gratz op
---
mate shut up lmao
---
If the community is sadistic and doesn't want it, let it stay gone, I say.  RS3 does exist, there's two versions of the same game, you just gotta pick one or the other.  Let the OSRS players have their game with no resting, it's what they want.
---
I mean clearly it was about the law runes and the blessing!
---
Sounds like mtx so it should be removed.
---
Remember when RS3 did this or when OSRS changed maple logs? They invent icons were butchered...Yeah that's this all over.
---
This all over
---
Because they need their hand held through basic stuff. 
---
okay, what % of the runelite number do you think is people actually playing the game?
---
It’s true, adding slots to an interface is definitely unfortunately engine work
---
Come on guys, dont you have the new void slayer helmet upgrade? Was introduced last update, only 200 Pest Points per Void Helmet
---
I like how you compare 'bandos, sara, DKs, LMS, etc'' to the inferno as if it's not med/average tier content that every casual player can do.
---
Hey Mod Gambit, there's also a dead pixel on the Toggle Run Orb that makes you click on the minimap instead.
---
The exact pixel is this one I believe:

Can you name some of those reasons please?
---
I just was up not using any themes in my superior gardens because the plain grass just goes better with the other gardens, I wish there were nice themes that made me fill that whole hotspot that aren't either bright pink or edgelord lava
---
you just ruined exp lamps for me
---
I'm just getting into Slayer (37ish and have done 2 tasks so far) and I'm trying to figure out what I exactly should be doing. For context, I just switched to mems a week ago so I'm pretty new to all of this...
---
So far I've just gone to Konar since I'm looking to make some money and I've been told that she has the best tasks/drop table for someone low slayer and mid combat (base 60 meelee, 61 range, 65 magic)
---
Should I continue to use Konar as the slayer master?
---
Also is the Black Mask worth it for someone like me just starting slayer?
---
You don't know how to type an @ sign? this is your computer's problem, probably related to the language you set your keyboard to.
---
You can also try copy pasting your email adress into the client.
---
Level 100 Boss
---
Just make it a toggle option like smashing vials is. Speak to fortunado in draynor and toggle smashing wine jugs when empty.
---
Call it a dungeon instead
---
Why nerf the tench ahhhhhhhh
---
the default grass of the superior garden doesn't even match the default grass of most poh themes.
---
atleast allow me to un-mow my lawn.
---
Sure if you have the money and you are fine with loosing a ton of defense.

RS3 happened
---
I now have for about 50 days worth of anima seeds banked, i’m already stockpilong

people getting woosh'ed left and right

I didn't even know there was a minigame like this in the game.

Skotizo is a greater and a black demon

Should have summer pied up.
---
I died twice to Jad last nights got because of that. I got so pissed because I knew I had the right prayer at the right time. Guess I’ll have to wait even longer to get my fire cape 
---
He’s talking about the already popular post at the top of the subreddit about this. 
---
NO THEY ARE STUPID I AM SMART - Reddit and it’s low self confidence 
---
No one is going to take the effort to post one of the most common capes in the game to proof your dumbass wrong lol bye 
---
Ur literally wahing that it's too hard to pray flick and trying to flex inferno in 2019 holy shit you are bad lol
---
If you don't catch sarcasm on this sub you get down voted to hell..
---
Nearly everything is sarcasm though so sometimes its hard to fucking tell 
---
It's like you didn't even read my incredibly short post. 
---
&gt;There are definitely reasons to wear prims and bgloves.
---
It's very possible, you'll never have more then 600 ms ping so you can always 1 tick. It's just at first when you're a bit slow you'll have to account for the delay so you can use the full 0.6 seconds to switch, spec and attack, as in beginning the process 200 ms before the start of the last tick so it all goes off at once. 
---
Another EZScape suggestion but people seem to be eating it up 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I feel it really shouldn't be too long of a boss fight. Maybe like 5 minutes with F2P gear. It should have basic things drop like low level ores and logs, mind/air/water/earth/fire runes etc.
---
yeah you're right i forgot about runeloader shutting down 
---
I think they said they couldn't turn the grass to Lava because it would affect the base floor of the house. They can't extend the theme over the grass because it would cause clipping and they need to leave that much room to fit the Tree and Rings there.
---
Pull the lever Kronk!
---
HA! i tihkn you;ll fidn i tpyre fastest heer
---
I mean the first thing someone should test when a bug occurs is whether the main client is having that issue or not. If they report a bug without doing any research on their end, then they deserve a bit of ridicule. 
---
If you need money, or you generally find slayer slow, I'd go with Konar.  Last night I made 500k on a hellhounds task which allowed me to break even (maybe even profit a bit) on prayer/cannoning the task.  normally that task would have been a sink one way or the other, but instead it was fast and profitable.
---
Basically Konar makes slayer offer decent money before you have the profitable slayer creatures unlocked (Dust devils, Gargoyles, Nechs, etc.)  Albeit it's a bit slower since sometimes you get a crap task.  However, the extra points enable you to skip a bit more, so all in all it's not too bad.  
---
Except it doesn’t. You can literally sit and kill goblins every day for 16 hours and EVENTUALLY you’ll have enough money to attempt the inferno. Picking flax is technically making money, do you consider that more skillful than the Inferno since you don’t earn money from the Inferno?? I’m now genuinely convinced that you’re either a stupid troll or you have an IQ of 7.
---
He's not saying that he would be leaching randoms to begin with. He's saying it's unimpressive for this account to do theater if everyone else is max gear plus scythe and shit. He could literally die in the first 20 seconds and the team would be able to crush it in what used to be record pace anyway 
---
Ive watched pures do 6h to kill Jad because they have to sit there and let their health refill n shit. Sure they *could* do it, but cmon, no *normal* persons going to do it..
---
Ty /u/clout2147m for the pic
---
my first dead back in 05 was from a farmer north of lumby.
---
rip full iron i received from my cousin.
---
That's a terrible idea.you can already use any axe if your wc/mining skill is high enough. You just can't equip it.
---
We need more low-mid level bosses that can be done with friends. Full support! 
---
No it seems I can’t fill all of it out. I’ve only tried on mobile tbf so might be that
---
Can you explain to me why you think it's an "EZScape" suggestion?
---
Never said it was, but that doesn't make 85% any less of a ridiculous figure. The difference between 85% and 60% is huge, it implies the amount of people who don't use runelite is more than double of what's claimed.
---
If u want those things just play RS3
---
But silver is unaffected because it does not use coal. Makes sense. 
---
But what about gold? Gold ore also costs more than the bars. 
---
I always felt like blacks weren't represented enough in this video game
---
Have you seen the eyesore that is snow? Please no rain. 
---
This meme speaks to me 
---
Dont go west of the guild then... a whole bunch (all?) of them are gone :o
---
There goes my big tree close to fairy ironman only
---
IDK if he will respond, but these episodes are going to start becoming further and further apart.
---
He is about to start temple trekking for weeks and it will take a while to get enough content for a video. I assume he is going to try to make one every week though
---
What makes you think that?
---
No there aren't. Just Obor (hill giant boss) and Bryophyta (moss giant boss) and both require protection prayers
---
This happens all the fucking time, like I see a similar post every 4 months. They really don't care for some reason
---
It’s a fucking hyperbole used for a point. You don’t have to nitpick everything.
---
1 drake kill. Yeah, that sums up my experience with them too
---
It should only take a min or two to right click delete all of them. If its too much effort, you could use WMK
---
I’m fucking with you bruv. Just that anytime you suggest saving bank space people go crazy and tell you to go back to RS3. I was expecting the replies to be ripping into you especially after the tool belt suggestion yesterday. It’s a cool suggestion imo and wouldn’t mind seeing it 
---
Duuuuuude thank you so much! That's helpful. I haven't been using the rune cause I'm a little strapped for cash atm
---
no max mains want easier runescape
---
Any situation where you'll be using more than just melee, any situation where taking magic damage will be common, and not having to waste a bank space for guardian boots.
---
If no one beats me to it I'll do it tonight after school
---
I can't see why you'd get banned for giving him a gift, and yes the rs3 membership will carry over to osrs. Sounds like a good plan to me.  
---
Those aren’t my favorites tho, so no problems there
---
/u/JagexGambit      
---
Why is the fish still getting nerfed? I'm not part of the low level pure/obby Mauler community but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving them something new while encouraging participation in a new activity?
---
No volcanic whip mobile graphic fix? 
---
I think this is more a question you'd have to answer for yourself, but personally I think yes, there's plenty to do at all levels on OSRS.  
---
How does it have a negative effect? People in the wilderness can't use an alt to make themself unattackable.  If you're in the wilderness you should be able to be attacked
---
Agility is my highest skill. I don't really get all of the hate. I call my grandmother while I'm training it.
---
Kbd bro.
---
rune cbow? Pfft. Anyone who *actually* knows how to pray flick can do it with nothing but the training bow  
---
Get your range up nub
---
I already have 84 slayer wich ive trained trough melee.
---
Wich darts should i use in nmz? And elite void or blessed dhide?
---
Go to haveibeenpwned.com, they have a password and email checker. It's completely legit and you search the password without the email, it just checks if that password has ever been leaked before.
---
I'll bet you it has. 
---
Alright but it will spill every time you open a 4dose
---
Know Jagex they’ll probably flip the whole potion upside down and make it negative coloured or something. Maple logs V2
---
The irony here is a killer
---
&gt;The Golden tench's combat stats now match the stats of other fun weapons.
---
Rip kench. Wish this was polled...
---
Other than that, thank you for the changes.
---
Oh no, now it's harder to escape the wilderness when people want to attack you. 
---
How will the game survive?
---
Cmon man, so if one person (you) can't get one item for diary, then suddenly jmods must change drop rate of that item just cause of you ? Think about it twice 
---
Basically just normal vorkath.
---
just told me that pass hasnt been pwned
---
You don't deserve an infernal cape if you need 3rd party clients to baby you through it.
---
What's your point?
---
hw probably saw you train runecrafting lol
---
Just please make the boss only appear in F2P worlds. These types of bosses are farmed out way too hard on release by members.
---
I'd consider this position if you didnt fuck up the sentance so badly. 
---
Thanks guys! After an hour of deliberation (the Old Wise Man took shit all out of my bank) I've decided to just drop it all\*. Good luck me...
---
\*this does NOT include the items I think I need for everyday use (ectophial, key ring, locator orb, sled, sickle and a few odds and ends)
---
If I need to, I'll edit this post at a later date to fill in anyone who is also wondering if they can drop all the quest items. 
---
Take one out of the rune pouch and drop it.
---
Was trying to make light of someones snide comment
---
[They already did a goblin boss in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeUv3bOJT4)
---
Yeah buyable exp lamps? ezscape smh my head
---
If RL is60%, let's add 20% from OSB numbers, which still leaves us at like 20% of people using the default client. If we deduct konduit and whatever else there is, it becomes even closer to the 15% estimation given for default client.
---
VANILLA CLIENT MASTER RACE WHO IN?
---
In
---
Got it first try after praying ranged with only 1/9 brews left lol thank god.
---
If we're adding rain, can we add a day/night cycle?
---
Rather weird if you ask me. The thing about this game is that it's purely based on nostalgia. Sure, we see some updates here and there. But none that changes the feeling or the mechanics of the game. This community is very stubborn about just that. Sure you can toggle it, but if that's an argument we could of added a fuckload of updates. 
---
They are called bosses for a reason. If Obar is too hard, you arent ready for killing bosses. Its practically the introduction to bossing atm. Besides, killing bosses in only a small fraction of what you actually experience as a member. 
---
Ice barrage before “take a seat”???
---
I have a few things i'd like to see changed, speaking as a regular w65 FFA raider.
---
* We should we able to see the individual points for all team mates to prevent people from capping the potions. potion capping has been a problem since the realease of COX in the FFA community.
---
* The sub 115 combat average punishment should be deleted. As a host you want the average to be 115 to not lose out on points. The 115combat rule should be deleted.
---
* If someone leaves mid raid, the team gets let's point while the bosses stay as hard as the scale at the start was. We should still be able to get the points for the person who left the raid.
---
* If you freeze the mutadile ( or tent/zgs spec) when it is walking to the tree it sometimes walks back to the tree and sometimes it ignores the tree. Can this be adressed?
---
* The vanguards aggo range needs to be fixed.
---
* Vespula starting before even entering the room needs to be fixed.
---
* After vasa does his special attack, you cannot immediately turn back on your prayers, there is a delay where you cannot activate your overheads, can this be fixed?
---
*thieving/ice demon rooms should provide stackable kindlings/grubs. Currently, someone needs to get the chest to do the room properly, meaning he loses out on the points for that room. Getting the chest should not be punished in terms of points in the FFA community this is a problem.
---
*some drops at scavangers in raids don't make sense, why is there a butterfly net drop on the table? If someone cookes food (which almost nobody does) they bring a net themselves. This just makes scavengers a bigger chore.
---
* I would like to see 3 different scavengers for the 3 2nds needed to make pots. This makes gettings 2nds less of a rngfest than it currently is.
---
*thieving/ice takes too long to be efficient to do. This should be looked at.
---
glad i could help mate.
---
Yeah because having them in your back pack doesn’t make enough sense you fucking idiot
---
Hello please comment the worlds you like kill revs on and I’d be happy to come by and collect your next blowpipe, thanks! 
---
Finally I have an advantage using the official client
---
Check mate runelite bois
---
You’re not helping 
---
Looks the same. 
---
Prob is they won’t let us play ‘the floor is lava’
---
I was really dreading it as well but once you get into it it’s really not that hard at all if you focus on one role at a time. Also it’s a lot faster if you pick up a scroll and invite people rather than waiting to be invited, plus then you get to pick your role first every time 
---
Your fucked
---
And maybe you could add to your POH on the slot you would put decorative CW Armor.
---
Having an opinion isn't jumping on the bandwagon you wanker.
---
Spending 5m on bis range gear v 50+ on mage bis gear when range completely owns mage in almost every scenario. I didnt watch the fucking stream, I made this after trying mage on demonic gorillas lmao. 
---
Sorry I dont agree with your opinion.
---
RoT don't deserve new content.
---
Same. The reason I have a job is because end users don't need to talk to developers directly, *I'll* hear their concerns and decide if it needs to be escalated.
---
Definitely at least 1B.
---
Terror dogs are dogs.
---
Should of fixed the 4K crash on waterbirth island.....
---
Void, torso, anglers, farming outfit uhm...
---
Best in slot armours and weapons with a tiny bit of cash stack 
---
If it’s a daily thing then surely it means it works, so why not post about it and potentially save someone’s account?
---
this guy has the same face than me when i train runecrafting for more than 1 inventory
---
Not even remotely similar 
---
Assuming he’s members
---
As someone with only 1 CoX kc I fully accept that my opinion shouldn't really matter here, but just out of curiosity why do people want this change? So many people have been using scouting all this time and suddenly they want to remove it? This seems like something they should have realized before releasing raids, now that people are already used to scouting its too late.
---
I guess I should have quoted Gambit so that people understand I was being sarcastic/poking fun at not being able to understand a joke 
---
because unfortunately the only restrictions for voting is 300 total and 25 hours playtime
---
Who me?
---
Ironman actually with previous rs3 boss record times. 1 tick prayer flicking looked interesting so I learnt it very easily (it's really not hard...), you're what we would called a warden boi from rs3. YOu learn 4taa and get some meh pvm achievement and think you're actually good at the game. You've proven how shit you really are though.
---
no all those accounts can vote still u dumbass
---
Upvoted for taking responsibility and seemingly honest post 
---
I like it, maybe even a goblin spear weapon as a rare drop that could have a special attack for freebies. I don't think f2p players have any weapons with specials right?
---
I'll have a medium fries with that
---
&gt; You completely disregard f2p players as people who deserve content for a game they are spending time on
---
Sorry, what?  By pointing out that f2p has 2 existing bosses, I'm disregarding people and treating them as less than they deserve?  Please stop inserting hostility into my comments.
---
I'm not trying to say that this boss shouldn't be added.  I love f2p content.  Literally all that happened here was someone commented that f2p needed a taste of bossing, and I pointed out that they had 2 bosses already.
---
Sorry if reality offends you.
---
Farm oufit not worth it unless you're going for 200m
---
no exp so doesn't really matter... not like any form of fishing is good gp or anything
---
Its just annoying, i don’t even think people think its a bad mechanic, but because it was implemented in 2009 they think it sucks because its not an “old school” mechanic. Yeah well neither was fucking God Wars Dungeon and Grand Exchange but here we are with that. I swear the elitism on this game is actually retarded. 
---
all buyables + 500m net worth
---
Its a weird system right? The melee gear that requires a one time investment is significantly better than mage gear that requires constant gp poured into it.
---
any 3t weapon works, shortbows on rapid, darts on accurate
---
Always happy with more ftp content!!! 
---
Poll: change Rick’s name to Rick Sanchez 
---
Sorry to hear man, I just got back in to the game and wanted to watch some streams at work. Turns out all the top channels are scams and Twitch does not care.
---
They are view botting a scamming accounts.
---
is it really though? they made 6m off your blowpipe in like 30 min, if you watch some of the skulltrick videos on youtube, you’d see they make tons of gp.
---
not saying i agree with the whole concept but hey if you play stupid games, you’ll win stupid prizes. 
---
So past events have no weighting on current state? If you’re actually using this as an argument then you are either 10 and don’t understand anything or mentally challenged. You’re comparing rs3’s ~20 year old economy to osrs’s ~4/5 year old economy.
---
When dealing with stuff like this you don’t compare in absolutes, 1gp osrs &lt;&gt; 1gp rs3 so by saying money is easier because you can gain more in the same amount of time means nothing.
---
If all you wanted was money, and you didn’t care which game you played, you’d play osrs. Comparative to market values of the commodities, the money making on osrs is much better. 3-4m consistent money from zulrah/vorkath is much much much more op then 10-15m in rs3 and the requirements for zulrah/vorkath are much easier to get than any high level rs3 bossing.
---
I have 0 bias I play both games and enjoy them both for different reasons, it’s you that probably doesn’t even play rs3 but just thinks that shitting on it is cool cause osrs is sooooo much better of a game. 
---
Your argument is similar to disregarding ww2 when discussing the economies of America and the uk in the 50s, just stupid. 
---
“Really Nigga ?”
---
That's exactly it. It's not that I hate F2P and want to limit how much content they have, but between making content for those who pay to play and those who don't, it should be obvious. The dev team has so much that they want to do for P2P that dropping any of that to make F2P content would be stupid.
---
I think the goblin gloves should be better. I mean it’s level 80cb and you’re getting a drop that is already irrelevant at literal tier 1 equipment?
---
What exactly does this mean? :P i don't understand.
---
Lander
---
Lol. People will hand you Abyssal Whips just to flex sometimes. I wouldn't worry too much.
---
I didn't include smithing and fletching as that's pretty much impossible to maintain
---
How has no one thought of this before? This is genius. 
---
Also make the gloves untradable so noobs cant just have it bought for them and forces to PvM.
---
I really doubt this is enough of a difference between making and breaking whether or not you'd need to bank or not.
---
At least make it so 99 farming gives you a disease free herb patch in the farm guild... I thought it was insanity when my herb died there at 99 farming. 
---
that logic is incredibly flawed. I've seen dozens of these posts and never saw anyone saw 'thanks I almost fell for it'. I have seen a bunch of posts saying 'oops I feel for a Twitch phishing scam' though.
---
He doesn't play on the regular client anymore, due to it freezing all the time.
---
yeah....i was super tired after grinding for many hours and saw "[secure.runescape.com](https://secure.runescape.com)" and just went in to auto pilot and kept typing. After the bank pin went through I said out loud "wait. wait a minute..." lol. I don't really care that I lost all my money and gear. I just want to be able to play on that account again
---
People whined and whined about RS3 not getting placeholders because it would require heavy engine work
---
Bucket
---
Is your roommate Jim Carey?
---
Weird that it goes to tokyo then back to Australia for the last hop 
---
It does work as intended, people are just ignorant to go into the settings and realise that prayer reordering was turned on by default after the update.
---
1t
---
Seemingly so....sucks because this all could have been avoided. I owe it to myself to at least try though...
---
wait prayer pots are p2p only? Idk why I assume they were f2p. They should be allowed in F2P just not able to make them.
---
It's not nearly as bad as it seems. Just go to ba world and form your own group. 
---
Read a guide for each role and you should be fine. Most people will be understanding as long as you listen to any advice if someone notices you messing up.
---
yeah....i was super tired after grinding for many hours and saw secure . runescape . com and just went in to auto pilot and kept typing.

---
Extremely similar. Melee/range/mage/agility/woodcutting/mining/thieving/Herbalife/farming 
---
11 skills in 1 go. Pretty similar to dungeoneering.
---
I feel like this would be pointless outside of Ironman since anyone who's done LD certainly has the money for Stam potions
---
oh, word, haven't bought one in a while
---
? maybe they didn’t know it was an issue with the client and thought it was a game issue
---
Group pking is really lit, I suggest going to either the rev caves or at chaos altar.
---
True Vespula with Prayer Enhances can be extremely fast. But doing the Redemption method requires it to be preceeded by Muttadiles or Tekton, or to have you bringing in additional prayer restores.
---
I'd rather have the room be good in the way it seems to be intended to complete (grounding Vespula whilst keeping the grubs alive). 
---
Are you actually suggesting that the majority of people who vote on changes that they have no experience with google the proposed changes? "Master farmer hop seeds" takes me to the old wiki, where it showcases drop rates like 1/76.2. Well, how many times can you steal from him per hour? What do you even use hop seeds for? You can find answers to these questions but the majority of people with no experience won't. 
---
Voting with the crowd is always going to be a problem until poll results are hidden, but an informed voter is more likely to vote in line with their experience. My point is that a less experienced player (300 total compared to 1500 total) is probably more likely to vote with the crowd on content that they do not understand. 
---
I love how this captures the pixilated nature of the game itself. :)
---
&gt;Slave, stop fucking around and give me pets. But only exactly as many as I want, too much and I'll scratch you

Doubt youre the first tbh

Oh, right. Surface bosses are kinda hard to do though especially that close to the "start location". The only bosses just on the surface are wildy bosses and that's cause the wildy is a dangerous place. Imagine walking toward the cow field and just getting shagged by Shrek on steroids. Gg 25 gp
---
Imo runelite doesn’t offer anything overly op. If people don’t want overlays they don’t need to but to bring in the most recent drama, if runelite some how added a tool belt that would be a bs feature. It doesn’t so much make the game easier as it makes it smoother
---
I would go ammonite crabs or NMZ, if possible.
---
While I like your suggestion, it is something that changes the game mechanics and combat of the game. Sure, this feature alone is rather innocent, as I can’t think of any OSRS bosses that require multiple bolt/arrow variants and a full inventory of food and pots to kill. But lately I am more and more concerned with the quantity and type of updates we have been getting... With enough seemingly innocent updates and changes, eventually the game may suffer from it and become a different game from what we remember. It’s hard to blame the community though, because players are not professional game devs, and the content we vote for is the content we think we want right then and there. People don’t reflect much over their votes, and may not consider what all these updates amount to in the long run.
---
You’re giving the osrs a very bad name here. They’ve never given us any sense that they’d monetize anything, or ruin something by not listening to player feedback. 
---
What can i say? was training agility then i fell and got stuck on that tree, don't know why.
---
It wasn't a waste. You need that for rfd anyway iirc
---
Thank you for trying to help. I know how to type that sign, my problem is nothing happens when I do press the correct buttons. Like if there was no input at all, when In fact there is one. 
---
Also it doesn’t let me paste anything into the client. Reinstalling the client didn’t help either. 
---
Same issue as me, I posted a post few hours ago and some of my friends are experiencing this. Hope jagex could get some attention about this especially at the night time of Singapore.
---
Pics or didn’t happen
---
If you play mobile exclusively then that obviously doesn’t apply to you
---
Okay so on a dog task you can kill dogs, guard dogs, and jackals, no terrordogs. On a bird task you can kill birds, chickens, vultures, terrorbirds, rooster, and undead chickens. 
---
Lmao pvpers are the reason pvp sucks now. 
---
While Guthix Sleeps
---
decent amount of experience
---
Thank you much now make the opengl features were for Mac and I will scream from happiness so hard that my whole area code will hear me
---
Two people are able to attack simultaneously in single-way combat. Meaning you could have 10+ people waiting for the box to end and they can all attack at the same time, basically stacking someone out. 
---
This is funny cause a lot of devs (all of them) use 3rd party clients regularly.  
---
This post is dumb on so many levels
---
First off, b gloves are hybrid gloves.
---
Secondly, dont fucking wear guard boots unless youve calced that the str bonus doesnt make a difference on every scp decay you mong
---
You're the reason why people play with public set to off
---
RS3 content in OSRS? No thanks, don't need any more ezpoll
---
Lock it behind ranger guild with some weird minigame

---
Oh, the greed...
---
The time saved means you can just start another raid, and the points/hr is much higher overall vs. just doing any old raid which can take up to twice as long as a short good scout. Part of the issue is that raids layouts are so wildly varying, they can be anywhere between 5 and 8 rooms, if there was less variance the necessity of scouting would be reduced. The points/time of the various puzzle rooms also vary dramatically.
---
&gt;waste of time for everyone involved
---
Minimally I've gotten fat stacks of bolts so definitely not a waste.  Sometimes you get way more than that because generally people bring more than 3-4 decent items to kill kbd. 
---
I love how this isnt common knowledge. Not on wiki or anything. Always put me off raids...and forget forgetting to buy something at the GE
---
you gotta cc my man? would love to be able and observe this 
---
Canceraids
---
i think you would be very disappointed in the outcome is that every happened
---
that's fair, i fully remember being where you were :)
---
You gotta have it typed out and ready to go
---
Why would we want Jagex to waste dev time on a boss that will not bring in any revenue for them, i.e. memberships? After a month this will be dead content.
---
I mean the game knows when each player got there, how else would it know when you lose aggro. Still, I'd guess it's either pid or random. I'm not sure though
---
Why fletch?
---
This game is so efficency focused. Stam pots will always be the efficient option. Particularly for skilling and questing. Resting will just make the game less shit for people who don't have access to them. 
---
on task should be wearing silver bracelets... 
---
It could be a right click option like teleports, i.e. radus blessing.

Mining one doesn't take that long to get, but yeah only fun for fashionscape

Taking advantage of peoples good nature for views on your video. Its just not cool... Im not sure what you are expecting from reddit by promoting this here. 
---
In regards to the video im downvoting this as the content was poor anyway. very underwhelming reactions. Have a good day at school tomorrow.
---
Deserves a medal tbf. Am just poor.
---
I work mcds yknow? Lol
---
No post showing poll results without good reason will just end up buried, not to mention Reddit makes up a pretty small portion of the player base so even if it were the case the majority of players still wouldn't see it
---
What I love about this tattoo is that there's multiple levels of recognition. Anyone will see it and think "look, a skull and crossbones". A smaller segment will think "interesting, It looks rather pixilated". Then the inner tier will of course reflexively think "ha, nice". 
---
To anyone that tries to impose any kind of ink regret on you, remember this mantra a wise old man once bestowed upon me. "Fuck em". Nice ink :)
---
I hear the woodcutting one is worth it just because it doesn't take all that long to get from Temple Trekking.
---
i wish this wasn't accurate at all
---
Maybe. Times have changed. When I got back into OSRS this year I was pretty nooby, and I watched tons of guides and googled stuff immediately. 
---
For example, I googled how to train melee in F2P, found hill giants, googled giant key, and then youtubed Obor strategies. 
---
You the man Mod_Kelvin, generous of you to sort by new and take care of this.
---
I doubt you'll have time to respond, but I am concerned by the amount of phishing attempts on Twitch at the moment. I've returned to the game and love it, but I am shocked that the Twitch Page has turned in to an elaborate phishing attempt. Have you guys been able to work with Twitch Staff to ban these people? I nearly succumbed to the scam myself.
---
I am a returning player and saw the Dev Stream mention "Active Double XP here" and it looked so legit. I managed to snap myself out of it before supplying any personal information, but I'd imagine a lot of players are falling victim to these viewbotting fake streams. 
---
Finally, we can play the game.
---
Man, anytime someone presents a thought out suggestion for an addition to the f2p game, in roll the assholes who only use it as an opportunity to shit on people who either can't afford the cost of membership, or don't sit at their computer all day and spend enough time playing to justify the cost. Osrs will only grow if f2p players keep enjoying the game, tell their friends, and they start enjoying it too. Jagex makes a lot of money, they can afford to evolve f2p in small ways that will keep f2p players engaged and enjoying it.
---
This sub: "fuck coin pouch, a free inventory space is bad for the game"
---
Also this sub: "add bolt pouch, a free inventory slot is good for the game"
---
Support!
---
That’s awesome! Maybe I’m not giving people enough credit. 
---
Did not know there was a bolt patch in this game. So now there's Bolt pouch, gem bag, coal bag, looting bag, herb sack, seed box, and rune pouch
---
How expensive are them lobs?
---
I can't imagine Jagex actually considers AFK splashers a big problem
---
You can just go to tob world and spectate to unlock the music. As for joining a pvm clan, look on the official forums; that is where clans recruit.
---
But what conditions allow this? Isn’t the point of boxing to go until you’re left alone? 
---
Tbh once you hit ZMI Runecrafting is alright, took a couple days to go from 61 to 77 with Runelites GPU plugin and render distance ramped up, let's you 1 click from the bank to the altar and you can quickly bank with the new [1 5 10 X ALL] options. 
---
Once you hit 77 it's chill as fuck, I did 77-80 straight after hitting 77 and I barely even noticed. 
---
202 raw atm
---
wow, TIL. thank you!
---
WG_CC (wilderness guardians clan). We do daily PvM/PvP/Mini-Games/Skilling Events +F2P stuff! Feel free to join us to find some friends
---
You seem capable of having a reasonable conversation.
---
How can you be so staunchly against things like a tool belt when RuneLite exist? 
---
You buy a hammer/tinderbox once and have it for the rest of your account. The only thought that goes into it is trying to remember where it's at in your bank. It marginally increases xp per hour because you can carry 1 extra bar. ( In the case of smithing ).
---
Farming timers, potion timers, agility obstacle indicators, menu entry swapping, prayer reordering, etc. All impact the game in a much more profound way than something like a tool belt does.
---
What about a tool belt makes it so much more of a violation of the game integrity than that of RuneLite?
---
Open source companies are acquired all the time though. Usually for their development team and processes
---
I like the idea but between the giants and Elvarg F2P has bosses.
---
 
---
For sure. I would have never thought to do that as a kid when I first played, which is why I never got shit done, but as an adult that plays casually-ish now, it just makes it easier to search stuff up.
---
Are you serious?! That would help a lot! 
---
1b 
---
it would be faster for me to teleport to farming guild and go down the cave then to teleport to my house, switch to lunars, go to bank, figure out which runes for geomancy, then cast it
---
If you really wanna do raids you'll get the teleport in no time anyways.
---
I find it weird that this got downvoted so much.. But putting feldip hills in morytania is appearently very funny because HAHA ITS FUNNY CUZ YOU CANT TRAIN HUNTER FROM LEVEL 1 IN MORYTANIA HAHA.

Guess this humor is too dark for reddit : \^ )

How much profit?

How many game hours?

Coin pouch is forced, allowing everyone to have access to it on creation of account and is also clunky and changes the whole aspect of the coin system. 
---
Bolt pouch would not be forced, you dont have to get it if you dont want it. Its not directly attached to your user interface and this update would make it a lot less clunk and give the item an actual use. It's not just some hidden interface that you have to fuck with every 10 seconds like coin pouch.
---
No coin pouch, no tool belt. 
---
Yeah i'd like a source on "freely choose which shop/currency" statement as that's not what the law does.
---
Sit on it and find out?
---
I disagree, stuff like the ranging guild is almost completely dead content. Some things sure, don't rework them but some need doing so. For the bandits and dark warriors well wilderness slayer exists, nobody really wants to be killing level 17-30 every task getting next to no experience.
---
Took me about 10 mins to get clips. Not gonna sit for 2 hrs getting “good reactions” for a shitty joke video. Ya’ll are taking this too serious 😂
---
Stock is bad but using runelite GPU and animation smoothing makes it bearable
---
Devalues!
---
Guilty 
---
Then don't make the video?
---
My suit is red not blue :p
---
Sure a new player is going to go completely grind out 99 firemaking. 
---
Tape 
---
I have no idea what this means. Do i have to watch garbage streamers to understand?
---
Are you going to allow yourself the use of Edgeville? Don't think there is a bank in wildy 
---
Okay, is this instrument called a harmonica in anyone else's native tongue?
---
the point is probably to prevent someone from x-logging bc they need to deal or take damage to stay locked in single, but i guess people can coordinate it so that when the person who needs the box x-logs the person still on can bring some kind of range switch to deal minimal damage once they x-out
---
You don't need 100 different plugins when you're good at the game. 
---
25 seconds is not possible alone even on wave 1. It is more like 36 seconds to attack 8-10 times with a blowpipe. Its not that hard. 
---
Also attacker is not the only way to join therefore as I said, max combat is not even near a requirement.
---
Thank you :), wait is 125k not much? D: I might have to make more in that case
---
Afaik Jagex uses an external service for payments (which is why its web is vastly different from the rest); could well be that Jagex in short-term can't do much about it themselves. 
---
I think you’d be surprised, LD isn’t a huge requirement quest, especially in things that bring cash in
---
Awful video, stick to being a cunt off camera maybe.
---
Hats off to you for this achievement!
---
How does runelite make money? I’ve always just used Jagex’s client but I’ve been wanting to test out other clients now that I’m playing old school more. Subscription for “pro” right?
---
Also, the mage arena bank
---
I miss that guild and GOP.  BIS f2p 1 attack item and BIS pure robes. 
---
Nononono
---
Ahh yes because a person with 300 total that has 0 knowledge of slayer up to this point, is going to go out of his way to research and check how a level 95 hydra creature or how a level 75 combat slayer master works, and can easily understand what poison pools and what can figure out what separate drop table the poll is referring to based on context clues. And you really dont see anything wrong with him voting on changes in a area where he has not even stepped foot on?
---
There's a difference between adding client functionality, like price tracking, item tracking, and things like that, vs actual mechanical changes that affect the way you play the game.
---
people WANT OSHD. Over 11k+ players were registered in less than 40 minutes to use the OSHD client when it was launched!
---
Holy fuck cool off
---
you,
---
im 99% sure you dont fully understand most of pvp updates and higher lvl content but still you are allowed to have say even though you dont even understand it
---
As you well deserved 
---
You can get a cat to kill the rats...
---
Not really since p2p is literally being kept behind a gate. 
---
Why? What's the point in something being there if it serves no purpose and nobody interacts with it?
---
OH MY GOD IT WOULD BE OPTIONAL AND TOGGLE-ABLE......... sigh 
---
Idk man like I said I just feel like RuneLite has a much, much wider and profound effect on the game than the tool belt could.
---
Yes, I agree that a tool belt would break an UIM ( but you could disable it for that game mode ), every type of account uses RuneLite. 
---
In RS3, I would do farm runs much less frequently because I wouldn't keep track of the exact time. Now, I get way more runs in because I don't have to worry about doing it early. 
---
Agility was aids because it required focus. Now with the highlighting of the hit boxes, agility is pretty afkable. 
---
And at the end of the day, tools are the least impactful thing in the game. If someone was proposing a food pouch, or potion pouch, I'd agree that inventory space matters too much to consider those things, but most Skilling activities that require a tool the 1-2 extra spaces you'd gain from the tool belt makes a negligible difference at best.
---
But, agree to disagree. Have a nice day.
---
I agree. A niche item requires a niche method of obtaining
---
Did not hatspect this! 
---
Yes super fast , and we got hilt actually haha
---
Devalues the 3 runecrafting levels i’ve trained manually.
---
The patch was made to RL a couple hours before you commented. Sorry m8
---
Great vid man you’re a total badass! Gave the vid a well deserved thumbs down, keep up the great work! 
---
Yeah I had no idea what Runelite is until I read this.
---
wow no class
---
My bad, not sure how I didn't associate the clearly descriptive title "oof" to a prayer reordering bug
---
76 for Zulrah I think too.
---
What do you mean desynced?
---
There was a guild in Runescape prior to OSRS?
---
Reminds me of the Big Enough meme. AHHHHH!
---
I hope to god that never happens
---
Why I can do what I want
---
They want to remove scouting from raids 1 which is wildly unpopular amongst those that run it. 
---
You know I would, but for some odd reason Chymistry, you make me wanna runecraft. 
---
No
---
I’m sorry, but this looks pretty bad 
---
Bis? 
---
They're speaking for themself just like you all speak for yourselves. There are players on both sides that either want some form of OSHD or don't want any of it. I personally don't care as long as I can still play old school.
---
I’m a pretty nice guy though
---
You deserve the cummies
---
I just don't see the point of making a bad video
---
(raises hand)
---
I did technically play rsc and some rs2 when they were new but I was a dumb kid and never made any stats past like, 30. It was pretty easy to chill and watch stuff grinding this out. :)
---
Honestly then you seem smart enough to look into what your are voting or just not vote. 
---
Arealocked UIM are felons in my book. 
---
Yeah I absolutely hate the idea of an extra arbitrary step. It’s my loot and I want it now!
---
y'all fat and are probably 40 years old irl. GET A LIFE OLDIE &amp; STAY AWAY FROM OUR GAME.
---
Thanks, you're a peach :)
---
I'm getting 50ms from nz
---
Except for the fact that training with Slayer is way slower
---
Excess ink, plasma and blood make a really nice cocktail to stain clothes with.
---
Easily one my least favorite grind in the game. Excluding rc of course
---
lol moobs
---
You can turn in bones a few at a time. Doesn't have to be all in one trip
---
If you're using both sgs and guthans, you're doing it so fucking wrong. SGS and a few pieces of food is all you ever need.
---
&gt; Also Jagex would never be able to add something like agility course overlays without the Basement Boys shitting themselves about EZ scape
---
Imagine thinking negative of people who don't want bright-colored highlight boxes in their game...
---
&gt;When you log into Runescape*
---
hey i'm a cute guy 23y, we should exchange Snapchats,
---
my snapchat is Jonaaathaaann
---
:3
---
No, it's at least 500k an hour from just the scales since you use 2000 an hour on rapid and the scaled are 250 gp each. Give lance a recharge cost and i'l happily vote to buff it, otherwise no, a free to use weapon should not be better than one that costs at least 500k an hour to use.
---
Yeah it's a bit strange to be at experiments going for exp with an attack lvl that high 
---
Im colorblind so they are all green for me either way....
---
2spooky please delete...
---
First off, like i said i dont agree with all runelite plugins, but because of jagex are not willing to put time into their client we dont have much choice.
---
Second, runelite being overpowered doesnt justify adding something into the game, that logic just wont hold up, actual new in-game things trumps all utilities a client can provide. Everything runelite offers you can do just as good without, except the puzzle helper maybe, where you can lose maybe 10 seconds each time
---
Farming timers, agility course highlighting, potion timers, menu entry swapping, prayer reordering, hunting trap timers, etc all have a much wider and much more profound impact on the game integrity than saving 1-2 inventory spaces while doing a handful of skills. 
---
Right? Jesus Christ 
---
"Damn gurlll, thats a booty hole."
---
It looks like its also going to Hong Kong &amp; Indonesia before it routes to Tokyo. Maybe a BGP issue on Telstra's side?
---
omfg we would still have to watch videos and streams in HD...
---
Then you understand the game and how you want it to be played.   The player base grows and changes and the game needs to stay true to its core but grow with the community. 
---
It's not going to last a month tho🤣
---
I make like one video a year lmao
---
Tells me how to solve clue puzzles
---
I love your big dick energy &lt;3 BLOCK ME IF UR A NECKBEARD THO.
---
Basically u use ward scrolls to skip rooms and to get the scroll you have to go through the room previously is what I gathered from it so to get the scroll you have to suffer through a room you already don't wanna do 
---
If you really think my reasons were not justified and that your were more justified despite you not providing any sort of factual information either, then you're more dense than a rock and don't care about looking at anything other than your point. There is clearly no changing your opinion on this matter, so i don't want to waste my time arguing with you. I'm not replying to this anymore. Have fun. 
---
he's correct, dummy.
---
Oh I was pumping it way up to like 90, that may be my issue.
---
Second post because the first one didn’t get the response you wanted eh? 
---
From the blog post,
---
&gt;As this method of influencing the contents of your dungeon is earned, we'd prefer that players not be able to bypass it for free by using an alternate client to scout the dungeon and re-randomise over and over again until they get a "random" outcome they like, for free. This means that we'd need to remove scouting...
---
And goes on to say that they get that we aren't totally cool with that and to work with them to come up with a feature we'd accept
---
Cool I'll look into runelite, thanks for the info
---
I know what you mean about knockout being unresponsive, but I don't remember a time when that wasn't the case. Don't think it had anything to do with the update.
---
"More money than I'll ever need"
---
.. Oh honey.
---
Because the times of recovery were viable enough to still be useful to a majority of players. 
---
So you don’t want oshd what you damn posted? 
---
Got em. 
---
You know you cant go repair your barrows at someone’s POH for far cheaper 
---
Yeah I love economies personally myself its fun.
---
How did that black chin get an obby maul? Why is it killing it's family? So many questions...
---
Osrs has limits tho, not sure what u mean by it not having a limit.
---
99 everything, all diaries, max cash stack, max token stack, all boss drops, all quests, etc.
---
There are so many limits
---
Time played != game knowledge. You’d have to be playing pretty casually to only hit 1200 total in 13 years 
---
There's an armour stand repair thing in your house you can use to repair armor cheaper than Bob
---
You can build an amour stand in your POH :)
---
They did mention that the scrolls would be tradable with an alch value of 6k, but where the price would actually balance out to it may not be worth it
---
Qol
---
Having the ability to select an active equip slot? Or dinamically add and remove slots if the pouch is or isn't equipped? Yeah, that's not in the game, lol
---
What's in-game is an item, and you can right click bolt types to equip them if the pouch is open. Very very different
---
Why not herblore, herblore is buyable lol
---
because u found it to be humorous 
---
He is right for sure. Extra str bonus almost always come into play when you're potted no matter your gear or stats. He probably got downvoted because he started his comment with "you're totally wrong" instead of something a little more diplomatic. 
---
For everyone who doesnt know.. This is what a QOL update looks like
---
Well it isn't practical to expect Jagex to provide any support for clients they had nothing to do with creating.
---
Do you have one for 2018 averages?
---
Now this is Qol
---
Hah some people can’t wrap their heads around that one
---
So you can stay on other spellbooks. I do it a lot for alching drops while I barrage nechs
---
Cool. Yeah I'm sitting at 22 prayer right now because of the ghosts ahoy questline. Thanks for the info. 
---
But what if OP secretly supports HAM? 
---
Another post to make f2p better lmao 
---
THANK YOU. Ffs i so tired of these know it all dbags that have 7000 hours in the game and cant even comprehend taking you time and not doing everything The most effective and efficient way or always have all best in slot gear. Lol i wont be a slave to this shit like most people seem to be.
---
Do you do any work with jagex while creating RL? Ive been using you program, but scared if being banned. The risk seems to be worth it, because i love rl. However, still scared.
---
Because everyone has a different limit, it doesn't make sense to treat 200mil as the limit, by that logic only a few 100 will vote. 
---
?
---
Aww poor noobs slumming it not being able to use their 3rd party eascape stuff. Poor things 
---
May of means nothing. It's may have.
---
Cool. I'm at 50/50/22 R/M/P right now. Was just trying to decide how to level going forward, there's a lot of quests/diaries that are requiring defense. Thinking maybe I'll just do two separate accounts at this point haha
---
Are you hiding rooftops (in-game setting) by some chance?
---
How do you play on Mac lmaoo, i have a 2015 Macbook Pro wit Retina display and my fans sound like a jet engine and battery drains fast with OSRS playing
---
That's right
---
Yes! My body is ready. 
---
Sorry, a demon told him to do it so he kinda has to.
---
Great, thanks for the response!
---
You're literally the King of all autists.
---
Mobile Runelite when?
---
&gt;If you really think my reasons were not justified and that your were more justified despite you not providing any sort of factual information either, then you're more dense than a rock and don't care about looking at anything other than your point.
---
Mate anyone can read through the exchange and see me asking you mutliple questions, clarifying and justifying my argument, and also see you repeatedly essentially restate the exact same thing with no reasoning.
---
&gt;There is clearly no changing your opinion on this matter, so i don't want to waste my time arguing with you. I'm not replying to this anymore. Have fun.
---
Lol this is such bad faith argumentation it's actually unreal. You're clearly a compllete fucking cunt
---
Maybe you have enough gp to take screenshots now 
---
&gt;iron man
---
I think Mage would need something more like this than range. Rune pouches are not equiptable, why should range have one?
---
Range is already overpowered IMO.
---
I went and made another 1,000 flax. so now at 250k, I now realize its not much but hopefully it will last a day or two while i mess around with some quests
---
&gt;btw
---
There's a prayer guild?
---
Or if you can afford a mansion you can probably afford a nice pool in the backyard. 
---
Best in slot. 
---
Just waiting for some millionaire to create and buy bonds to 100k accounts so he can decide what changes will go through and what will not.
---
I prefer the normal client over anything to be fair
---
On my 10hp ironman I went right to 70/71 slayer doing only wildy slayer. It's nice for ironman as they will most likely be killing wilderness monsters and bosses for their unique loots.
---
Yes, but that doesn't affect other tree patches, right?
---
That's why black salamanders give no profit right? Stop crying and do red chins if blacks are too much for your pussy ass.
---
Rs3 model
---
Open question, but what's wrong with Pest Control? You get normal XP for just general combat, but you can also dump points into combat skills too.
---
Ice Barrage is my ring tone, always get compliments on it, even from people who have no idea where it's from. 
---
You only got to 64 wc after 99? Seems like it should be higher
---
Queen but ok.
---
Posting this again huh? Keep trying you absolutely retarded cunt no one cares about you
---
“Kinda pointless to play it” is a photoshop meme waiting to happen
---
To everybody their own as they would see fit, brother! I'm glad you enjoy vanilla, as long as people keep having fun who cares what client you're own!

Nice crop

I don't condone this amount of loot, if im honest. broken AF

So the plebs can keep doing it efficient as possible without doing the ones they don’t like and are slower

rofl you just reminded me of a lewd Facebook post XD

Replace 100 herbs with 160 magic logs and the point still stands lmao
---
Show us South African boys some love pls Jagex 
---
unfortunately mod mat k didnt do a data stream in 2018 so there isnt one
---
We need Antarctica worlds too! 
---
Not too sure, but does toggling the option to show rooftops fix the tree crown?
---
If anything, Jagex needs to fix that setting; it does far more than just get rid of some roofs, and also gets rid of details in other places.
---
Yeah :( Cutting only gives like .3x your wc level in exp where burning was like 3x your fm.
---
Lmao i did exactly that friend told me the max was 60 i put it at 90 :p 
---
So unless you have a unique account like yours nobody does wildly slayer for xp 
---
You people need to just shut up, this game isn’t even close to RS3. If this is even close to a step for you then I doubt you’ve ever logged into that game. 
---
It's like they don't want games on mac lol 
---
Its not useless, I use it on every god wars dungeon trip I go on with my pure.
---
Just got that :-) *slips off into oblivion red faced**

Yes

A good way to show you only do sandcrabs on the game

Damn. i must have been real lucky then, haha - Thanks for the answer :D

I did this for spice doses already, had a lot of trouble with the yellow spices haha

It basically just saves 5 seconds typing into google.

Puzzle boxes solvers I can see being OP, but they're basically trivial when you know how to solve them.

That is irrelevant to the above comment.

Idk? Why don’t you report it before you cook your pizza rolls and crack open a can of Mountain Dew, and get as much gaming in as possible before your mom comes home. 
---
#1 - Is very important, but imagine dbow squads in deep wild... Should cost 100k x levels past 20 wild.
---
#3 - Just makes escaping large teams (which are currently partly to blame for killing the wilderness, imo) almost impossible.
---
#6 - Would make botting way to easy and would tank the economy so badly.
---
#7 - Would be abused/farmed
---
#8 - OP af. No one except pkers reminiscing of the glory days want this monstrosity of a weapon back.
---
#9 - What about clue scroll hunters/etc. that want to take no part in pvp? Why force them to pkers more?
---
#10 - A few p mods would be more realistic, but corruption would be an inevitability (depending on their power).
---
#11 - Pking is shit right now because you need to hop hop hop hop to find someone. Making more worlds would further increase this frustration.
---
The rest of them are good fixes.
---
He left out removing the log in time-out when you've hopped too many times.
---
Osrs polling format does not support hidden results. You will end up with fucking empty content. Areas passing with little content in them. Because the fucking neanderthals chose to add the area but not most of the content in it. The only way to do it is to poll the entire update as a package and you get it or you fucking don't. And no fucking dev team is going to concept an entire area and not add any of it because some neaderthal wanted hidden poll results.
---
Pets are dope af
---
Literally just opening to the take-poll page instead of the results page would be such a huge improvement.
---
Reported.
---
If you were not thinking about it it might not occur to you that its runelite causing it and you would there fore have no way of knowing.  
---
I wasn't talking about you.
---
Literally unplayable
---
this was actually a thing back in the day, but mostly on people who were splashing on PVP worlds cause the potential rewards if you broke their combat with a bond was actually decently high. 
---
As someone who has 200+ ensouled goblin heads  and two goblin champion scrolls if this dropped keys for it, I'd be guaranteed to farm that rare drop.
---
Get IP banned you friggin coconut
---
thanks
---
Wow I didn't know there was that many rs3 players posting on other forums, thought we were dying out 
---
Wow! Your brother is going to love this! 
---
Wow nice screenshot!
---
The thing about this game is that if you take literally 1 step back from the screen, you realize that none of it matters. Pets are just as important as anything else in rs in the sense that the entire game is just setting goals and achieving them- goals you set for yourself matter, and goals you don't set for yourself don't matter. 
---
I'm not saying it can't be improved but if you're bragging you have inferno cape yet think the default prayer book makes it way harder then you should probably get a refund before jagex bans you for cape buying
---
Get a room you two
---
I don't really consider standing around cutting / burning trees for hours super interesting content, lol.
---
Somebody close the damn window, it's drafty in here
---
Lmfao I just choked on some water reading this 😂 
---
Been playing for about 2 years now and have never heard of this item.
---
But I was led astray
---
The only part that's closed sourced is runescape code itself. Anything that a user can change and modify is open source. It is safe
---
I'm in central US, can't say I've ever had an issue with existing US servers
---
No?  Slayer helm gives you pretty good DPS rates, and most monsters have low defense as well so you shred through them.
---
I'm actually kinda tempted to make a HCIM and go fresh, I didn't really get anything i NEEDED from it so meh. :)
---
Move an iconicly placed rock because you can't lure muggers to kill bots? Nah I'm good. 
---
What an absolute beast
---
I’m actually with you man. I’ve gotten two skilling pets and both times I’m just like meh. Wish i got something valuable instead 
---
It could be burnt grass or something.
---
Healthy green grass makes no sense

---
New Zulrah meta?
---
Dude has 20 rc. 
---
Mayyyyyyyybe they should have something to work towards, then?
---
Idk who they is lol. It's only good money if you go on rate for claw. Kills are around 2 minutes and claw is 1k drop. That means you're basing your profit around a drop that has an expected value of 33 hours. 
---
Idk about you but I cbf with that noise. Drops with that high an expected value simply cannot be relied on unless you're spending 500+ hours at the boss. 
---
What's wrong with the ZGS spec as is?
---
And you saying all of this and making this decision is showing pact mentality had an effect on you. No getting away from it my doggy 
---
I'd agree RC does suck. Implications of easier/more fun training methods are interesting though. If more people start training RC with a new method, price of runes will decrease. Price of runes is already pretty low, not sure Jagex would want them any lower
---
"Reposting" is generally seen as a negative thing, so thanking people for it comes off as sarcastic.
---
Alright child 
---
.net si the real version, right?
---
Thanks 
---
&gt; I’d love to see them play back in 2002 era they’d prob quit and cry
---
That's because it was a boring and terrible game. I'm sure you had so much fun un-noting all your items on inventory at a time.
---
You're getting downvoted but your comment is far more self aware than the bullshit one posted above.
---
Everyone here complains about how there is no community anymore because people care too much about efficiency and XP waste to have fun. Well guess what? Barely anyone gave a shit about efficiency prior to 3rd party clients plastering your XP rate right in your face and solving clue scrolls for you.
---
It isn't the community that's gone. It's the fact that the community switched to a client that outright tells them there's only 1 efficient way to do any 1 task.
---
This is the opposite of the point of the bank pin and ofc should not be done lol. Same reason you cant enter bank pin with keyboard, whole point is that it's pretty good at dodging malware.

Is it true on death everything is lost in the pouch? I was reading on the wiki and it says this:
---
WARNING: THIS ITEM AND ITS CONTENTS ARE LOST ON DEATH.
---
I sometimes die on tasks when afking and this would be super lame.
---
to y'all saying it would take away the oldschool feeling, we people that want OSHD voted for osrs only for it's combat system, but wanted HD also, but never had the chance to vote for it... so osrs would do.
---
Returning player,old times moderation was lower while browsing seems like people getting banned for it.
---
Outstanding move 
---
DHL doesn't need a special attack.
---
There is nothing wrong with ZGS.
---
His home router's IP means nothing to an attacker. Everyone's '192.168.x.x' address is a private address behind their NAT router. The first hop after his router's internal IP is generally the WAN connection IP of his modem or from his ISP. This could be represented in hop 2 if his ISP is blocking ping (Why it's showing up as \* \* \*) but if I was him, i'd google 'What's my IP' and if his public IP is the same as his hop 3 he should erase it from the paste.
---
All an attacker needs is a person's public IP to initiate DOS or DDOS attacks. 
---
Did you have your nap today?
---
I don't think extra inventory space is what (most) people are against. We already have rune pouches, essence pouches, herb sacks, etc.
---
The issue is that tool belt and coin pouch implemented as they are in RS3 wouldn't be consistent. All the pouches in the game still take up an inventory slot (although they do save you more). All of their contents are (as far as I'm aware) also dropped on death. All of them also need to be obtained in some way.
---
Making the suggestions more consistent with all of that stuff will probably make it more palatable to people. That being said, coin pouch still wouldn't make it because there's no point in it if it still takes up a slot (unless it can store different types of currency).
---
Variety 
---
This is dope but to actually rate:
---
If you can't afford justiciar (which is actually flames for rune dragon alts) then replace neitz with fighter hat, it's marginally better 
---
Zulrah is safe so long as you go collect your items before you die again. God wars will drop your tradeable items on the ground (except the 3 most valuable, which you will keep) and you will have 1 hour to collect them.

I didn’t know that. But if you think everyone’s going to check with the official client when they’re pretty sure it’s a game mechanic issue then you’re reaching for the stars
---
anyone want to link me to the vid this came from thx
---
To me 
---
It's only 5 cb levels though, and it gives me access to AGS to take out the zerks. Maxed 60 attack zerks are 94 CB. Pretty sure I'm dealing with them regardless.
---
Yeah I agree with that
---
Sounds like it get full void you'll do less dps but until you learn the switches it'll make shit alot easier. 
---
Some of these suggestions are complete bullshit and not even relevant to pvp, but on some of them (3, 4 and 8) you can clearly see that the youtuber who made the video is just a random skulltricker trying to make videos in the same style of torvesta.
---
Hes just trying to make it even easier for teams to follow a person and braindead cast barrage and spectrade until that person is dead. Not sure exactly how that is supposed to make PKing more attractive. Basically just tries to get skulltricking buffed.

Yeah i have the same macbook 15” screen. This has been an issue for me the past 3 years. UNTIL i found out about runelite’s “fps control” feature a couple of months ago. I played with it a bit and completely changed everything. I set the fps at 30 and don’t notice any difference and the fans dont go off. If i have a screen in the background training or afking i set it to 15-20 and its almost unnoticeable

And has lower base value than goblin mail on ge lol
---
ZGS is underused and underwhelming ,it being the Zamorak good sword ,Lord of fire ,yet all it does is freeze players (rarely used ) it's a low tier sword and lore wise does not match. This proposal will allow more usage and compare it to it's rival Sgs which heals ,and this shall DMG. Only 3 gs that have majority usage is bgs,sgs,ags zgs was never meant to be a ultlity sword ,Jagex just left it that way.

True,  I'm just salty. I've been hunting mole for a month now. The extra money from magics instead of yes would be a nice condolence.

It’s free real estate

Jmods know they can't just outright remove scouting without huge backlash. Make no mistake, if you vote yes to this you're voting for scouting to be removed. This solution is bad anyway since when scouting you're usually looking for a 3-4 combat raid which the scrolls don't control, and it can only eliminate 1 skilling room. This is a massive nerf to raids since it will drop kc/hr by a lot, probably reducing GP/h to under vorkath.
---
Well then why are you bitching? This game is already ugly as fuck and you're complaining about add-on aesthetics in a third party client that are 100% optional.
---
Buying gf 25 gp
---
Why is this downvoted
---
shouldn’t be locked behind combat level bc there are a lot of pures that still raid. i agree tho i don’t want people voting on something having no idea what it means
---
Awesome picture of god ash!
---
It is definitely not 100% safe to use. But, that doesn't mean you will get hacked by using it. Its not 100% safe bc part of the code is closed source, and could therefore have some code which breaks game rules. Also... I've seen a few cases where people lower the graphics settings for less latency (so its easier to maximize efficiency around game ticks) and cause the bot detection system to raise a false positive. Its not widely discussed bc it's a grey area between whether this falls on runelite developers for causing the bot detection system to trigger,  or if it falls on jagex for the bot detection system flagging on tick efficient users. Regardless, this has happened and within the past 6 months to a year. Outside of messing with graphic plugins though the client seems relatively safe to use, based on personal experience.

how dare he try and communicate effectively with others

How is it QUALITY OF LIFE when you are literally working against the bank pin, and you want to compromise security for everyone?? People this fucking stupid actually exists? Just fucking disable it instead.

Disagree. BGS and SGS are mostly pvm weapons and have their roles. ZGS and AGS are mostly pvp and have their roles.  Watch vids of clans pkng and shit and you will see ZGS is used often as a melee freeze.

Spin flax for an hour and buy a few hundred energy pots. Problem solved. We all had to do it. You can get to 30+ agility in no time with quests anyways. 
---
Is there talk of nerfing it? If anything the dumb thing needs to be buffed. The special attack almost never heals anything worth while and you're spending a ton to even use it. Who cried this time? Goddamnit lmao 
---
I think he means about how solo todt also gets you some herblore and a tooon of construction xp compared to multi 
---
DHL zammy hasta has a special attack and since DHL is a fused version of Hydra parts and zammy hasta ,removing a enhanced weapons special attack and defensive stats made no sense. Upgrading weapons should never feel like a downgrade /degrade ,other wise zammy hasta +piety acts just the same as dragon Lance with no prayers 
---
What's the logic there...
---
Why does having an Inferno Cape mean you can't think the original is awkwardly designed? 
---
I wouldn't exactly say blow pipe is the most affordable. I mean you could use a crossbow and it's way cheaper then buying scales. Dragon chow only costs like 3 mil more which you would probably save that in scales real fast. I dont want it nerfed either but a better arguement might be it leaves little in terms of variety in ranged combat. Especially for around that level. 
---

---
How about “glass cannon” prayers with narrow, high dps or def boosts but clear situational counterplays? They would have a Def requirement since pures basically are glass cannons. 
---
Another angle that hasn’t been explored yet in OSRS is a prayer which much drain a certain amt of prayer points before activating as well as ones which cost prayer points to activate or when they take effect. One of the cooler prayers in the game is smite, but prayer management is trivial once you have 70 prayer. Even at 52 people are a]rarely in a position where they get smited. If a prayer book operated on thresholds it could lead to an opponent recognizing the chance to deal a special attack while order to take advantage of the prayer points drained simultaneously by smite and the player using a given prayer (yes it would have to have a visual cue) which costs them some number of prayer points when activated. 
---
It was just in upstairs Varrock general store, he couldn’t stall me with a door or kick me out or anything,

"Hurrrr durrrr iTs jUSt piXeLS" is absolutely one of the dumbest online cliches though so well done.

Tool belt and coin pouches are irl things, it's not like it's less realistic. Matter of fact, if someone were to carry many, many coins with them on a regular basis, chances are that they would have a pouch of some sort to keep them safe. Same with tool belts and people that need hammers a lot. I don't see how "it ruins the feel" of the game by making it slightly more realistic. If anything it's better for immersion.

I know what zgs does ,but that's not what gs was meant to be ,players just made it that way ,players ignored lore and what God's are and created a meta for each gs,if anything sgs should have SAra sword spec which deals lighting damage ,and blessed Sara sword or bss should heal and restore prayer ,the name and lore matches ,but the content is reversed ,does that make sense my child ?

---
Huh? Lavas give ~430xp for an entire trip using pouches at under 75rc, and at 74rc an xp lamp gives 740xp cos they scale with level
---
Nah fam. 
---
I think it's just people posting complaints here on reddit. I do not think its needs a buff though. You may just be unlucky with the specs or be using cheap darts idk. I dont really have trouble hitting specs myself. You do spend alot to use it, but it probably should be this way since it is BiS in alot of cases 
---
Oh you may have to use the google sheets app on mobile 
---
Naw bro :3
---
You are using DHL against monsters made by dragonkin. You want to point me to the dragonkin made monsters that doesn't take up more than 1square, and therefore the hasta special can be used on? And if you can, you mind pointing out how it's useful?
---
It doesn't have a special attack because it's supposed to be for melee what DHCB is for range.
---
What the fuck are you on about with this zammy hasta piety stuff? The lance is much stronger than the hasta when USED WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED.

Just give the mugger ability to use ice barrage. Also make the area multi, problem solved.

They should just make all rooms the same points and just let people scout if they want to waste time at the start of a raid to not get vespula or w/e

Yeah, the only reason ecu keys aren't OP is because you have to take a risk in getting them 
---
They would probably play rs3 because they love microtransactions 
---
I guess I liked the Boondocks. 
---
Blowpipe wouldn't have been this broken if jagex used the shield slot for defensive items, instead of making offensive shield slots. 2h weapons should be the highest dps weapons, but they need to make bigger sacrifices for the dps. Avernic defender was a mistake for example.
---
Also it becomes even worse now when dragon dart tips are flooding the market, which is why people wanted them out of the KDT to begin with.

I do agree about ice and thieving scaling for solos, but imo a good bit of the other stuff isn’t necessary or is just an across the board makes its too easy

All of RuneScape is a grind, so judging where people choose to spend their time is really what’s pointless. It’s a game with tons of content, and if there’s certain content you don’t really favor, that’s just personal preference.
---
So basically a useless bachelor's degree. 
---
It’s funny because when you typed “masterpiece” it somehow got auto-corrected to “abomination”
---
When is the nerf / buff coming to seed boxes, to make the reward fit the time spend on a contract?

How the fuck do you even notice this, let alone have picture comparison?

If you never raided before then you don't know about them. Yea you can search how to do them but it's not the same as actually having done them so it's not gonna change your raiding future in any way because it will all be new to you

Idk I don't feel or see any difference

It would help UIM alot too, wouldnt have to use up an inventory space for a hatchet! I approve.

Seriously? You don't think this comes across as condescending *at all*?

And I guess to answer your question directly, yes. I have absolutely killed people on the way to kbd. Because tele block exists and it's in 43 wild.  
---
dwarf weed and guams look almost identical

I would quest and slayer then go afk on something like crabs.

Wouldn't put elder maul on that early unless you do solos.

Mage is actually extremely strong in the early game. To a point where it's kind of ridiculous. Range has always been the most accurate(a lot of offensive stats in the armour), also look at crossbows. Now it's highest DPS as well(melee used to be), because of blowpipe. It is however somewhat expensive to use as you pointed out. problem with mage is that it would become extremely oppressive if it was on par with ranged/melee DPS wise, because of the extreme utility of magic. Maybe it would be balanced by the cost though? Blood barrage is the most expensive spell in the game I believe, and if it was the highest DPS as well, it would be absurd.
---
In case you didn't get it, I agree with you, not an easy fix at all.
---
I agree, but then other content would be overcrowded. I think Jagex's direction with specific rewards for wilderness content in BH worlds is a good direction.

This is my worry about the blowpipe being nerfed. In max ranged and strength gear, melee with whip vastly outperforms any cbow, apart from dhc on dragons. I don't want to go from "rangescape" to actual pure meleescape.

what? yes it is. http://prntscr.com/mbpaqz  here is a melee comparison on the olm hand. ahrims top bottom + barrows gloves is comparable in damage to void with better defenses too. its better. prove me wrong with the dps calc if you think differently

That’s exactly what I’m saying. The level requirement seems extremely low for what you get in the protection prayers.

Sweaty sweaty oh so sweaty prayer flicking would negate this balancing

it's good but with the new tekton changes it might be needed even less. (25% less defence)

BP is the fastest DPS on anything with low defense.

Panic get infernal capes
---
I somewhat agree, but it would just change the meta for a ton of things so much that i'm unsure if it would work. There would be a ton of specialized accounts with items the same accounts would never be able to get again.

you ever get that slayer helm imbued? 👀
---
Why do you think spirit trees require suqah tooth and monkey nuts as payment? Jagex mods knew what they were doing
---
blowpipe is better for olm head. dragon crossbow is an upgrade from the rune crossbow. the reason you need it first is because of how much better dragon bolts are than adamant bolts. during olm just use your blowpipe.
---
fuckkkkkkkkkk
---
True that, but that would legit make it convenient for both sides as I see it.. for all of us players too
---
? What? I like runelite and use it for somethings. Osbuddy has some better features though. Friend finder comes to mind. Runelite requires them to have private on which defeats the purpose of it

Haha high if he keeps shitting in the house 😂

It would also need to be updated manually which would be a huge hassle.

Honestly, if you're getting this email you should change your email address.

Yup the Monastery near Edgeville. There's a 31 Prayer requirement to enter and the altars there overcharge your prayer by 2 (So if you have 51 Prayer when you pray there you'd have 53/51 Prayer). Other than the altars Brother Jered can bless unblessed symbols but that's it for the guild.
---
the incoming bp nerf makes this post look redundant yes.
---
What does ' The dragon hasta (KP) is no longer tradeable.' mean?
---
You don't seem to know what flicking means. Flicking is not the same as switching prayers...
---
This probably isn't what you came here for, but I would recommend getting Mortania Hard diary and doing Barrows Runs for most high-end offensive spells costs. You get Death, Chaos, Fire, and sometimes Blood (depends on score). Mortania Hard diary will give you bonus runs, meaning lost of the loot gp-wise ends up being runes. And while restocking your rune pouch, you get some rolls at some decent 1-4m drops.
---
And on top of that, you also get a Bonecrusher, one of the free-est QoL items in the game. The trickle of exp adds up, and imo it really cleans up the game when your slaying or bursting. Being able to pick out seeds from ogre drops on mobile is pretty nice. 
---
I don't really mind it. It's just clicking something different. There's technically no difference in what you're doing between say fishing and agility. Clicking is clicking.

It used to be melee scape, shit is pretty well rounded now.

Maybe a higher level just for the sake of HP. Like a max hit of 10-12 but 200ish hp so it makes since for low leveled players to fight it together.

If scrolls get passed you have to bring a pick/bludgeon/salve/anti to every raid. I'm sure since you are an experienced raider I don't have to explain to you how stupid it is to force us to bring useless items in our already limited inventory.

I haven't told her to do that.

You can also only do that at level 90. Meaning the first 5.5m'ish exp needs to come from slower methods.

Protection prayers are one of the biggest staples of RS, they are not going to be changed. Waaay too many repercussions
---
Adding new filler prayers so they have to make more room in the pray book or make the icons smaller, which would kill muscle memory for  switching. There is that more of your liking? 
---
yeah i do it as soon as it finishes growing, im enjoying the farming xp but ive got absolutely no money from it yet

Q
---
Im currently getting about 45 kills/h which is 1.7m/h after supplies and taking into account uniques droprates on an account with 90 all melees. I can see max melee accounts scraping the 2m/h barely by getting around 50 kills/h, any more than this and people are probably exaggerating.
---
Would highly recommend switching from bandos to justiciar, trust me when i say the +9str bonus just really isnt worth the hassle, especially if u play other accounts at the same time. I was doing 5-6 kill trips but with justiciar i get minimum 7 and usually average about 8-9. My trips used to last about 9-10 min but now im getting 11-12 min trips so im actually using the full extended antifire dose and doing 1 less trip/h (5 trips instead of 6). The time saved banking less supplies used more than makes up for the lowered dps, the end result is justiciar gives both better kills/h and profit/h.
---
Did your brain stop functioning when you “read” my comment or what?
---
Just curious, what are some of the repercussions? I'm not 100% sold on the idea myself I just want to know what would change?
---
Oh sick I’m rich with a bank of 25m
---
In the grander scheme of things? No, my life will go on. Do you lose sleep at night over the state of a video game?
---
No, but as shown in the picture, whip is vastly better than ACB, with a 2.7 difference in dps. Whereas blowpipe with dragon darts is 12.8 dps, compared to the 10.3, which is only 2.5 difference. So if the difference of dps between blowpipe and whip is not okay, why is the difference between whip and acb?
---
And of course cost to use should factor into somethings power. Why would an item cost more to use but be vastly worse than another? If blowpipe gets nerfed, it should have it's cost vastly reduced, as well as other range weapons be looked at for rebalancing.
---

I wouldn't call them filler prayers anymore than thick skin and rock skin are filler prayers - just stronger versions of the same prayer. I'm aware that some monsters are able to hit through prayer but the majority can't. Your muscle memory argument doesn't seem like a great one. So what if a sub lvl 37 prayer is polled someday? Are you going to vote no because it changes the layout of the prayer book? 
---
Then why is everyone acting like they will nerf it?
---
Blowpipe is so expensive to use. I'm level 85 and I use my msb with rune arrows to train range. My slayer also isn't high enough that I can cover scale costs using blowpipe training slayer so really my bp use is limited to quests and wilderness. It's so expensive

??? Tool belts and coin pouches are not things were everyone magically has a 15 different tools and coins on them without any other thought. If you're bringing a shit load of money or tools with you irl you have to go and fucking grab them, and it still limits what else you can bring/hold.

Don’t get 100%. 88% is better for loot.

I rather have RS3 having polled content but no hidden results for polls than the other way around. OSRS polling is still far better than RS3 polling. This poll in RS3 right now is just an opinion poll, not a guaranteed content poll like most OSRS polls are.

What the fuck?

Oh nice, I didn’t realize it was that old. It was new to me. I saw a handful of others doing it during my run but didn’t know it’s been around for a while. I couldn’t find any details on it.

Not sure how true it is but someone said a while ago it would be better to do one trade. They only ban the sellers so they need reason to believe an account is selling. Which wouldnt happen if youre only trading between the same 2 accounts

Or play game without 3rd part stuff 🤔 dumb ass noobs 
---
Most optimal way for you to improve your DPS is:
---
Imbue zerker ring &gt; Barrow gloves &gt; Fire cape. 
---
Getting a trimmed skillcape and the 70 def for dharoks won't increase your DPS either.
---
If you play mobile you aren't part of the playerbase?
---
It was in a poll blog, but they revised and never actually brought it to a poll. 
---
That's pretty smart. I haven't done gorillas in a long time but will try that out next time I go. 
---
Imagine caring so much about a video game that it is more important than survival IRL.  It just goes to show how little you know or care about in your sphere of an easy life. 
---
&gt; probably reducing GP/h to under vorkath
---
Eh, this I find doubtful. Prices of items will adjust to less coming into the game, especially since Dex and Arcanes are consumable and Dexes make up a large potion of your gp/hr. It'll probably end up being a buff to solo raiders who self scout anyways but a nerf to team raids who will have to cut down on switches (lower DPS) in order to bring the self scout setup.

Hmm... What if it’s not released on the app stores though? That would work

You should never do 100%. Kill all 6 brothers + 3 skeletons for around 88%. This will provide best reward. With 100% it gives u a chance at a dragon med helm. If you get the helm, it would of been a barrows item if you didn't have 100%.

Is the upgrade to adamant from lower tier darts worth the extra money

Yes you can, but I would advise against posting your username along with your stats, as this could lead to your account getting targeted.

There is an elf diary reward in RS3 that removes the damage dealt and poison from this so you can just safely run through it. Can OSRS have this?

How was staring at the eclipse?

Not even that op tbh. Gorilla is using ranged, count 3 hits then walk away and pray mage. Switch melee pray if he walks forward. If melee guess either magic or range and if you take damage flick the other prayer. Is it really that hard to do people? 
---
Well you could do zmi with runners which are people who bring you the essence so you don’t have to run back and forth, but that’s expensive

Make the gloves only dropable in f2p, so they will have some value.
---
Also add gloves for ranger and melee and make it drop splitbark
---
"Im not used to using the tools i already have. Give me something else"
---
It's more efficient if you can do it faster than 4x the time of a 4-man. So if a 4 man takes 30 minutes but you can solo efficiently(without shitting out purple sweets) in under 2 hours then you'd be making more money per hour. Solo'ing sounds like aids though.

I seriously doubt the bias effect is actually significant.

It's worth changing because it's fairly straightforward to do. But I'm unconvinced it'll materially affect the results.
---
In terms of polling integrity updates there's lots of stuff you could do which would be illegal in real elections that wouldn't be against the game rules that would have a real impact.
---
That they don't happen suggests to me that the rather more minor bandwagon problem is a lot less of a problem than people think. 
---
Get b gloves mate, then fire cape. Trust me. Youre at 149 qp - that's honestly not that far off man! It would only take you a day to complete. I promise it's the best thing to have all your untradeables done and out the way early on. Thats why IMO barrow gloves should always be the first priority. And this is coming from someone who hates questing. 
---
You dont need many stats either from your current, so you could easily get the quest points and stats in a day or two tops. Remember - you can boost stats for certain quests, and you dont actually need to complete legends quest to finish RFD. You just need to start it which you can do without thr required stats :). 
---
Just look up quests on the wiki. Find all the ones that are novice/short and pretty much do all the required ones you'll need to finish RFD and get the quest points from those, and for the leftover ones you can either do quests that will help in the future, or just spam the easiest/shortest/highest point given quests to reach 175. (Also you get 2 qp for doing the rune and drag gloves upgrades so remember that). 
---
Seems youve got enough $ to be able to power through the quests. Honestly they arent that bad if you just buy everything you need at GE and buy stamina pots. I believe I finished barrow gloves on my brand new acc where I havent played in 12 years in 2 weeks. And I wasnt even super grinding or playing 14 hour days. 
---
Then after b gloves get 70-75 range and do fire cape. You already have torso and DD, so you'll be set after FC and B gloves! It may seem like such a drag but believe me man it's worth it and will speed up everything you do basically. Once you start doing quests you get into the flow of it and it's really not bad! 
---
Just set aside a day to quest. And if you want fast range exp go to the Light house and cannon dags down there with auto retaliate on and pray melee. Just use a crossbow or something with good range bonus, you'll get 150k+ exp an hour. 75 range will make fire cape stupid easy with blowpipe. 
---

Yeah you have to pay for scales either way so best to use addy darts, theyre under 200 gp each anyway

Did they announce a bp nerf? I saw it suggested but the mods were noncommittal
---
With all those emblems he makes like 1m per trip and he risks 1.5b.. I'd say not worth. Plus you can only do it in the BH world so people can camp you.

No clue why he wouldn't use Justicar also. He doesn't die if he is wearing Justicar there

100%. Something people don't realize is that the BP reaches like 6-7 dps, while melee is behind only 1-2 dps max. Range options aside from BP and TB for general use are fucking shite with kbow being like 3-4 dps. Literally half of BPs damage output. Of course there's not equal investment but if they decide to nerf BP substantially then all that happens is that melee takes over and the same issue prevails. Maybe even worse since melee doesn't require like 400k/h in investment like the BP.

Not arthritis (though I probably will be once I get around to 3-tick fishing my way to 99), but I've lost all will to live.
---
Melee has always outclassed Range and Mage DPS wise. It’s still true to this day. Barring blowpipe and Twisted bow which both are very expensive to use if you want the best DPS. Melee is just as good but a one time purchase. There’s a bullshit narrative going on that range is op, but you take away blowpipe and it’s the weakest of the 3. And I know for a fact that 99% of the player base  can’t afford a tbow. Meanwhile mage mage is over here struggling and hella expensive to use.
---
Because there isn't one. Unless you're a mercher of some kind but guess what? We shouldn't cater to the people who manipulate market prices anyways. Merching used to actually take effort. Now you hedge your bets on updates and they usually pay off

There are a ton of people who live in venezeuala.. They play runescape because it is easier for them to make money selling gold on runescape than with a normal job because of politicians in their country...

I said let them know that we have empathy for them and have their backs and want better for them...

You don't need a tinfoil hat because they only poll things they know will pass in the first place. The first years of polls were trial and error, but now Jagex can gauge pretty well in advance whether poll questions will pass or not before offering them. Real life legislative bodies work the exact same way, because bringing things to a poll that you know or should know won't pass is a gargantuan waste of everyone's time.

You could always keep the Ring if Wealth in your inventory and swap it on right before you get a kill. After the drop out your B ring back on. It’s definitely not afk method but best of both worlds if you wanna swing it.

Make goblin mail the requirement to enter the dungeon.. Make the gloves +2 strength... and give the gloves increase magic damage by +1 and range strength by 2.

Not nearly as cheap as mith darts
---
Yes, because the BP is OP for doing DPS. And you do DPS in order to gain something. A weapon merely doing insane DPS isn't grounds enough to nerf it, I don't think. For instance if that was the case, you'd see people wanting to nerf the dragon hunter weapons as well. The BP is OP for farming stuff because you get so many kill pr/h and that increases chance for getting uniques which boost your profit by a ton. 
---
Reported for encouraging rule breaking. /s
---
New boss everytime
---
How does it feel to be level 3 runecrafting?
---
You literally said in your title to let gold farmers know we support them. That is exactly what you wrote. Fuck off.
---
I never thought I'd get this far. The adrenaline is pumping
---
If everyone sees this as a good change then it should pass a vote, right?
---
nice 8-)
---
Lmfao. Great response.
---
The seeds arent notable, kappa
---
DT is gonna be rough (little did I know I had dysentery)

Skotizo is both a black and greater demon for tasks.

One step closer to toolbelt-&gt;one step closer to rs3

DAE RS3........BAD?
---
LOL

Oath

Because you just encountered something that looks like a bug and you want it to get fixed, but don't want to put in the effort of double checking. It's like doing your duty of  throwing shit in the trash but saying fuck it when it comes to throwing it in the proper container if it's not in front of you.
---
they were extremely overpowered.
---
Agreed
---
Because it's good business practice that earns you respect and likely dedicated coders. It also extends the longevity of your game.
---
No offense, but this isn't a well thought out comment.
---
nice
---
Went from clear to grey!
---
I was carried through a scuffed raid &amp; got a drake kill by boosting with pie l0l
---
Only experienced players would understand the huge benefit of the small bonuses these gloves provide. The noobs that this boss is aimed for wouldnt probably give a fuck about some lame brown boring ass gloves that in their eyes would probably be not worth the hassle. Definitely would need to look unique/colourful because thats what they would value... 
---
You realize that the higher level your account is the **more likely** it is that you've done these things, right? Obviously you can skirt the requirements and even a 2k minimum to vote (still fine imo) is going to get voters who are ill-informed, but you will get far fewer of them than requiring a total level of 300. A skill total 300 main has approximately a 0% chance of having done a raid, a maxed player has a much higher chance of having done the raid. Which would you rather see at the wheel for balance changes?
---
Everything that has high defense generally has high magic, so t bow shreds it. Everything that doesn't have high defense gets shredded by blowpipe. Blowpipe or T bow is BiS against 90% of the game. 
---
No honour pking is the peak osrs content.
---
Fossil Island or Skeletal?
---
thanks for both your suggestions, ill do mage training arena and if i need more start doing barrows!
---
npc contact and slayer ring-ing to steve for skips is the slayer meta
---
when someone steals my woods i give em the one-two and speak my mind.  if they wanna pick a fight they might as well go to a pvp world i say!
---
Yea probably not haha 
---
Alot of workplaces do not allow you to listen to music either lol. But I like the idea
---
Unfortunately, this is the shift we're going to continue to see in gaming. The only way to fix it is to be the change you want to see.
---
Username checks out
---
hitting em wit my stale baguette always seems to fix the problem too!  you gotta set down your dominance when skilling!
---
At least your username is right, you are a pretty huge dick
---
Wtf how do I even add this flair thing? I received a message here after I posted telling me to add a flair but when I click to add a flair it doesn't shows any and my post might get deleted.
---
You talk about being able to negate a boss mechanic that require attentiveness. I can't think of a single example of that, could you help me out?
---
U might deserve it 
---
He's done 70 solo raids at 1 hour+ per raid.
---
He deserves rewards.

this would fuck up the old school integrity. its a no from me
---
what does this even mean
---
like your door knob?
---
Fucking poll this crazy shit right now
---
Line up the first row, then the second row without touching the first row, then the 3rd row without touching 1 or 2, then the first column of the remaining 2 rows without touching rows 1,2,3, then the second column without touching rows 1,2,3 or column 1. Then the last 3 pieces will fall into place. 
---
Runecrafting unranked. I am shocked.
---
Don't worry, the only reason you're being downvoted is because the people downvoting you are lazy and stupid. They'd rather waste someone else's time than take their own time to do a simple bugtest.
---
Spellbook filtering poll version 3 wants a word with you
---
Quite literally no different than what he’s asking for.
---
They're still very very good. Fossil Island is dead though; you just got lucky with your world.
---
It's also inconvenient to have people report bugs that only affect third party clients. This attitude is selfish.
---
This is actually dark souls so seeing this, I’m not really surprised.
---
No task requires banking. Dps all the way
---
Why chop chop!?
---
Nice eternal glory you got there. Oh is that a d pick
---
This is actually a great explanation lmao
---
If you're training high level slayer, it's relatively inexpensive. 
---
Compared to rapiers hourly cost, it's huge.
---
Yeah, but isn't Lynx Titan more of a state if mind? In a way, we were all Lynx Titan today.
---
He’s too busy working hard on his no sense of humour Ironman
---
Do you really need those npc indicators? I don't get why people want their game looks as scrubby as rs3 
---
You can make your own ringtones for Apple.
---
You just need an m4r audio file.
---
Stage the file into the tones folder in your iTunes and then sync it. 
---
Should show up in the list of ringtones on your phone.
---
alch yourself
---
While under 10m for BiS gloves seems quite low, you need to remember that they require DS2 which lowers the amount of buyers significantly.
---
No you need the base level to use the prayer
---
It's not even a debate. Bandwagon effect is real and affects the accuracy of polling. It doesn't matter by how much, the fact is it does, and can be the difference between a pass and a fail. 
---
Most people are pretty dumb then.
---
Siege and Scape are a good combo!  Prep phase and drone phase farm 😂
---
Ha. Ha. Ha...
---
Hmmmm, another pens fan on here eh?
---
No ammy (mounted in one house so tele tabs) and a rune pick. Lmaoo
---
Good for you. Just starting playing myself on mobile a few weeks ago. Been setting small goals for myself in between making what money I can.
---
First I took the time to earn Ava’s back piece for ammo collection and I just completed the Rogue mini game to earn a set of rogue clothing. Next up is probably getting the full Graceful Outfit(I think I’m about halfway on marks to buy it all).
---
Keep us updated, it’s nice seeing occasional posts from people who haven’t been playing for a decade or more.
---
Lol haven't had any limbs yet bro I really have only started rune drags in last few days
---
Yeah, its definitely gonna be a little off. I assume he's making at least 1.5-2% profit otherwise why would anyone do it. When I checked the OSB price earlier the 16m one was selling for 15.75~. 
---
&gt; relaxful
---
You left how long you were logged in visible. Gg account.
---
I can totally see Pegs now, even though I just like the extra range personally.
---
When you’re explaining Tekton I can see your point if you’re soloing, but the likelihood that you miss all specs as a group is fairly low and the offensive bonuses of the Torture are universal.
---
DHL v DWH is something I still just don’t get and I think this is very opinionated and impossible to reduce to pure mathematics. I haven’t run the DPS calcs, but even like a 20% DPS increase in Olm hand wouldn’t be worth it to me unless you’re either soloing or the obligate melee hand member.
---
Doesn't the bolt pouch destroy all your bolts on death? I'd love to use one if that was changed.
---
But the other people said yes and if more people think it's good who am I to question?
---
a level 3 skiller can walk away from the mugger
---
this guy bots
---
FUUUUUCK
---
He's just able to move them like that, so he does.
---
Now sell it and get 85 construction 
---
Those guys sound like they're in their 20s....
---
More uniques than my 350KC, so that ain’t all too bad.
---
he's saying that the text is yellow which is usually only yellow for npc's
---
they're busy raiding and pk'ing revs, missing out indeed
---
Like what
---
You need to leave your room more often .
---
If only you can use the herbs I support it 
---
I used Dharok’s until 90 strength at NMZ and then went with Bludgeon until 99 doing slayer. It worked pretty good for me but I’m not honestly sure if it’s the most efficient.
---
Got my upvote
---
I can say with the utmost confidence that just about anything said in reference to runescape sounds like blathering nonsense.
---
Sometimes I go out of my way to tell my wife about my in-game accomplishments and I derive joy from watching her face as I dive into the nerdiest commentary I can think up.
---
Occasionally she'll just walk away.
---
Unfortunately another hobby is investing and when I talk about the stock market, she reacts in the same fashion. 
---
The monastery is right on the border of the wilderness, there’s a pretty cool opportunity to put some wilderness content in the basement.
---
I'm guessing fastest would be max str gear with scythe + piety + ovls. 
---
But yeah, obby would be better in your case. Still with piety and ovls. 
---
Real question is why are you watching rs3 q+a...
---
Scythe is ~1/200 so he got it quite a bit under droprate, but not incredibly far under. No different than say a 170 kc prim or 100 kc zenyte
---
Kill npcs
---
They were complaining about it when it first came out lmao. 
---
And it’s only become a bigger issue with it being the main weapon when it comes to every new boss. 
---
‘You nerd’
---
found these guys really easy to deal with. Their live chat was easy enough. Thanks man
---
Selling hats without a licence? Above the law?
---
Loot from 150 greater demons on konar task taken with my iPhone 4s, while ignoring Runelites screenshot feature, running on an Rtx 2080ti off of a toaster plugged into a generator. What a time to be alive
---
go afk at sand crabs with whatever bis strength you can afford and it will cost you literally nothing. 
---
Its free though so it could just be used as rag gear for pkers
---
I am using RL and Linux mint and OpenGL is totally broken. Windows is your only option if it means that much to you. 
---
Not over yet &lt;3
---
&gt; pkers doing elite diary
---
Tbh they need to get away from the whip concept and just introduce some damn variety back into the game. All you ever see are whips, blowpipes, etc.
---
That being said, updates don't always have to add end-game content because, believe it or not, the average player can't do end-game shit. ([Reference](https://i.redd.it/c2e89tgaqfc21.png)) That means the vast majority of players aren't at end-game, and would enjoy new content that they can participate in.
---
&gt; You could spec out someone boxing before they start boxing.
---
The boxing part is the issue, though... So that is irrelevant. 
---
&gt; And yes you are invincible because teams swap out after specs and have the person with BiS fighting. They hop off if getting wrecked and someone else takes over.
---
They technically aren't. You can get 1shot with a lucky ags/gmaul spec. 
---
&gt;By your logic people shouldn't be able to team with one person on ancients while another is on standard because the game never intended you to use both spell books at the same time. 
---
What? That is just a stupid sentence. 
---
Obviously the game intended to allow different players to be able to access different spell books. You can even have 1 player accessing multiple spell books via Spellbook Swap or the Mage Cape power. 
---
&gt; Or how about people shouldn't be teaming in singles areas because those were intended for 1v1s where as multi is meant for teams?
---
Where does it state the 1v1 area wasn't intended for teams too? It just means the area is intended so that only 1 person can attack you at a time. 
---
Not that teams can't move around it and hunt for people. 
---
&gt;You dont know what you are talking about.
---
You don't know what you are talking about.
---
He was the first, but quite a few have done it at this point
---
There's so many fucking acronyms to OSRS, lol 
---
There should be a quest where the goblins invade lumbridge and that as the final boss
---
Three skeletons opens up the possibility of getting bolt racks. If you don’t want those, stick to the following: 5 small crypt rats, 2 skeletons and a blood worm, or 4 blood worms.
---
I read the title as "first time on in 07 months"
