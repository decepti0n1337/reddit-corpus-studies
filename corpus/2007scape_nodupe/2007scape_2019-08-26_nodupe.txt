I know people liked soul wars, but all I remember was an AFK mess and too many bots. I think SC and FoG were better minigames
---
RNG comes around. Gratz man
---
On the Q&amp;A they were talking about adding tormented demons, so not adding things from pre-eoc is out the window.  Also I'm pretty sure we added more rs3 inspired updates rather than updates from 2008.  To your last point about FoG being dead look at castle wars, and the rewards are trash yet people still play

You're 1/11 for barrows pieces. These droprate is 1/17 so yeah your above droprate.
---
Its actually pretty cheesey. Has an absurd 4(?) hit true combo

I mean it replaces the current BiS melee helm, so yes.

Just buy gp from gold sellers then buy bonds. You'll literally pay like 3-4$ of a month of membership

---
strange
---
I can't tell what the minimum skill requirements are for getting from the outer to the inner ring. Each activity has a (level+1)% chance of success, for that skill. For mining you'll need a pick, for firemaking you'll need a tinderbox, and for woodcutting you'll need an axe. Or, you can use agility or thieving. Level 50 is a good baseline for whatever skill/s you choose to use.
---
Combat... More is better ofc. Should wear armor with magic defense, such as dragonhide.
---
Really depends on what you're slaying. I use prims, ring of gods(I), initiate plate/legs, slayer helm, and torture.
---
95% of melee slayer is beneficial to do with prayer, otherwise range.
---
When you gamble all your points for hydra task.
---
Remember the golden rule of one action per attack. Aggro one healer per attack. Move to the side so that they line up instead of all attacking you. You don't need to rush getting the healers off of Jad unless they are literally about to fully heal him; it's much more important to keep calm and pray correctly.
---
Oh no you saw my xp!

Would be too expensive then. No one would pay an effective 1k per cannonball

Theyre easy af to get and u already have granite cannonballs, if its going to be stronger than they then they need to cost significantly more

 What's the ideal prayer points to have when cerb summons the 3 ghosts? Without spectral.
---
Would it be 61 (or low 60s, 62, 63) so that the 3rd hit will only drain the fewest amount of prayer points yet fully blocking all 3 hits?
---
Wildy needs an update?... I think you may be the only one who feels that way. Kappa lol

Expected to see a moderator lock this, like all the other cry baby subs. Glad to see it wasn't the case.

Any good ways to go about steady income? I've stepped away from my slayer grind to break monotony. Some tasks gave good profit, but I want another way. I'm sitting around 6.5 mil, but I want to work towards getting bandos to finish my melee gear. Even tried to farm for Bryophyta's Essence, but the key drops aren't worth the F2P loot. Enemy drops to sell or high alc, crafting/gathering, whatever are all good.
---
If your mining your own essence??? See you in 6 years of play time
---
The best money making method at Vorkath is to use the DHCB and DFW. Even though this is the most efficient way to kill him, is it worth it to purchase these two items for roughly 135m to farm him? Should I stick with the blowpipe?

It os not the people he is staking doing this, a random person. He is doing this for shits and giggles. Hes been doing this to other streamers recent like sparc mac when pking in bounty hunter world.
---
99‚Äôs possible: attack, strength, defence, woodcutting, cooking, firemaking, thieving, fletching, prayer and mage. 
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs it.
---
Reinforced club is only used in SL1 runs, BKH is used in speedruns. Very different categories.

If you want a less RNG route, you usually use the Gravelord Greatsword or a moveswap.

x to doubt. 1m/hr since you're only spending about 10 mins on it, but you only make like 200k per run.

I liked the idea of giving him a wig and nieve's equipment

Wait, what do you mean people don't know how to do anything apart from PVM? Are you implying that it's difficult to afk minnows for sharks? Or afk magic logs? Or afk karambwans? Or afk anglers? Or is it difficult to do bird house runs? Or to do herb runs? Unless you're talking about tick manipulation or efficient skilling (which it seems you are not talking about), then skilling isn't something that is difficult. The strong majority of it is just afking lmao.

I used a mix of Karils top/bottom with blessed dhide head and boots for prayer. I had some left over cash so I bought a dragon cross bow and the normal emerald/diamond bolts(e). I'm also 95 range and have rigour, so that definitely made it a cake walk. With lower gear its still easy, you just wont hit as hard. You got this homie.
---
First time, probably 75+ range and 70 def/prayer
---
Resource wise, I agree you could run like 10 OSRS worlds on low end hardware. However, if one world gets DDOSed it'd take out all the worlds.

That's world 424-427, if anywhere was going to be on a single server it'd probably be Australia. Could be VMs on a single server, could be multiple NICs, could be docker instances (HA! jagex can't into modern tech) but I don't think we're seeing multiple worlds per server. I could very easily be wrong though.
---
Fletching you can get 3m an hour with darts
---
Make it 10 minutes
---
No u
---
1m is sorta a max, you're extremely lucky to get 1m a run. That's my fault for that. I edited it to 600k. 600k is much more feasible, 200k is way under.
---
Ok so if the guy hits 99 damage on him first he will die and if the guy always has first hit it makes it easier to do 99 damage when you always up ONE hit.

---
I think you're thinking of magic accuracy, not damage. For example, why even wear an occult necklace while barraging? Or your slayer helmet?
---
Yeah, relying on auto retaliate means you forfeit the first hit. However, I'm not sure how the ddoser guarantees getting their attack input in when the server goes down temporarily. Maybe something to do with the timing of the ddos, or maybe they're just fishing for whales who have auto retaliate off. I'd have to do some research into some shady sites and discord servers in order to find the answer to that, but that's a fair bit of work for content I'll never interact with and subsequently don't really care about.
---
I fully understood your point and I'll re-iterate mine because it seems you didn't get it... this post has nothing to do with politics. Let me give you another example of politics:

Mate, you can very much protect live services. I'm talking about a specific technology designed to protect live services. You ranting and raving about "it doesn't work" when its literally *the standard for doing so* just looks a bit berky. A 500gbps DDoS isn't pennies either.
---
So...
---
&gt;You can not protect a live game server like this one no matter how much you spend.  
---
Yes, yes you can. In fact, I've done it. So you can say "bad, incorrect and misleading" a few more times, but you're as wrong now as you were initially only now you look a prat as well.
---
For the record mate, it wasn't etiquette advice, it was life advice on how you might change so anybody likes you.
---
Only if it‚Äôs in morytania
---
Nope. Slayer helm is enough tbh. I burst my tasks on my ironman in prossy, damaged god book, glory and slaughter bracers lol.
---
Back when they still had that random I saved up for like a month to get a dragon axe. I was cutting yews and decided to hop world's because it was crowded (back when things were crowded lol) anyway I hopped and tried to start cutting again and couldn't. Turned out right before I hopped the head flew off. When I finally got back to the other world.  Some lucky noob grabbed the head and I begged him for it back but he wouldn't give it to me. So I ended up just keeping the axe handle and I would use it for fashion scape. A lot of people would ask what it was because it just looked like a bent gray pipe. Well eventually the random was removed and they deleted all axe handles from the game to prevent a new discontinued item from being created. I was pretty bummed out about losing that damn handle. It makes me wonder how many dragon axe handles were even in the game at the time they removed them. Who would be dumb or aware enough to not put the head back on. Anyway pointless story sorry to bother you.
---
I imagine this helm will probably only have a marginally higher strength bonus, trading the venom immunity for prayer. Biggest issue with Serp is the cost associated with it. If it didn't need scales to make it useful or maybe had the old venom mechanic it used to have, it'd still have a pretty solid niche. They seem to be very adamant on keeping that mechanic out of the game though, so unfortuntaly I can't imagine the Serp helm will see much use if big boy Nezzy has higher strength, prayer, AND no negative bonuses.
---
I did and I‚Äôm using runelite. Seems to not do anything still stuttering often. Should I turn gpu plugin off maybe? Thanks for the tip tho.

It's actually the wrong answer. They're only using 2/5 available ops. "Use" is auto added by the engine to every item and doesn't count towards the 5.

Ppl act like maxing in runescape is a major feat.  Sure it is to the regular player who cant always play.  But to these people who stream everyday and always are playing it's nothing.  Runescape is just a game that takes alot of time and no skill.  I love the game dont get me wrong it's just anyone could have 3 maxed accounts if they were allowed to get paid to play 8+ hours uninterrupted every day.
---
This is correct, as well as 5 isn't the maximum amount of inventory options.

I like how everyone that brings up this fact is being downvoted hard, even though there's absolutely no negative connotation associated with the post.

From Mexico it looks like I can buy membership for about half of what it costs in the US when you calculate the exchange rates. So either if you happen to be traveling or you use a vpn, you can get a discount on membership probably due to regional pricing for markets where people have less money. With PayPal, it automatically changes the currency for you. I bought 6 months of membership for only 27$ a month doing this.

It won't affect the game that much tbh. WoW and OSRS are two completely different MMOs and the playerbase for both games really don't have much crossover.

You barrage in proselyte to maximize prayer bonus to cut down on ppot usage. That extra max hit is kinda negligible. To each their own tho, if you got mad cash and dont care about usin a bunch of ppots then ancestral is better. But if you're trying to use the least amount of ppots proselyte is best.

PID is basically the server deciding who gets to complete a action first when 2 or more players do it at the exact same tick. Think of drop parties/looting Multiple people are clicking on the same item at the exact same tick seeing as theres a pretty big 0.6 second window. PID decided which of those players gets the drop. This also applies to when 2 players are fighting, One of you has to attack first even if you both click on each other at the same time. 
---
PID is extremely important in the sand casino as in a tent whip duel they usually last around 8-10 hits so getting a extra hit in first is a massive advantage

"bloopie is the 2nd person to get all pets in the game"

Ya see how this is a bad title.

It's like saying le me was the first person to max on the main game because he got maxed first after a new skill.  It's fucking zezima.

"bloopie is currently X person to get all pets and is 1 of only 2 people who currently have all pets" would be a better title

Account recovery is pretty simple. All you need is basic information such as..
---
¬∑ Previous passwords. The more you remember, the more likely you'll recover.
---
¬∑ ISP and Zipcode used to setup account.
---
¬∑ Date setup
---
¬∑ Latest membership purchase dates
---
¬∑ How membership was purchased (Amazon, Debit Card, etc.)
---
It's pretty straightforward. There's also a comments section when trying to recover to help Jagex out in believing you're the actual account owner.

Give it a go, it can't hurt. Good luck!

Well while serp technically had better combat improving stats the cost associated with serp puts it out of the question for a lot of situations. Nezzy is still widely used at all levels of gameplay due to the good stats, prayer bonus and low cost of the helmet

All BiS gear should be quest locked. I jave no problem grinding skills and quests, but saving up 1-2B to buy items like a tbow is just difficult. Plus it doesnt make it any more fun knowing some guys just shell out $600 to buy  the gold for it.

Bronze hasta, Fremmy shield, Tyras helm and red cape is as good as it gets, I think. Maybe makeover your shirt to be skin colored and plain so you look shirtless. I don't think theres any subligar style armor in OSRS though.

How'd you get enough money to pay for leveling construction that high? I've been a member for about a month and have about 20mil total in my bank mostly gained from doing herb and bird house runs because going into the wilderness is just not a fun experience anymore.
---
1 inch per episode (2 part series)
---
Aside from herb farming as I've mentioned before. The managing Miscellania minigame is good for making a chunk of money weekly/bi-weekly/monthly. Just toss a million in (there's actually a minimum amount of gp the kingdom requires to make max profit) login every day and chop a log or two and keep it moving. Alchmate and the oldschool wiki will usually tell you which resources are worth gathering. Check out a youtube guide, its super easy and only takes 5 mins a day.
---
If you've done varrock easy/medium/hard/elite diaries. Go to Zaff's staffs and buy the discount BATTLEstaves in bulk from the little barrel in the corner. The better the diary you complete, the more battlestaves you can buy in bulk. They buy for 7k each from the barrel and ge usually sells it for over 8.1k. If Zaff's actual store inventory of battlestaves are full (5 staffs) buy it out and sell it along with the discounted ones. Instant profit every day.
---
These are just daily tasks to do every day that increases your bank. Now if you want active money making advice, show us your stats.
---
Im cry laughing. Good reference.

What does that even mean.

She's supposed so sort of be claw-gripping the spear, using her thumb and index finger, and keeping it balanced up straight that way.
---
I feel like that should work in real life, but I only tried it out with a broom, since I didn't have any warspears lying around :P
---
Also it's supposed to look like she's pushing the helmet against her body, but I agree, it doesn't look super natural. And yeah, the right hand sucks, I'll probably redo that at some point.

My cheap ass just hangs out on world 330 so when I am doing stuff that requires ornate pools, jewelry boxes or teleports I just tab outside the POH portal and hop in to whatever house the bots are advertising.

Going to assume youre a HCIM and due to that you choose to limit yourself so get over it. Also there wasnt a huge complaint about forcing people into the wildy before the death mechanics became nonexistent.... bring back risk for pvming to the rest of the game and people wont whine about wildy content

I just pay the membership on multiple accounts. Hate the feeling of my cash stack going down in game just so I could play catch up. Rs is something I enjoy so setting aside $11 a month for an account isn't bad at all when you think of the fun you'd get from playing.
---
Am I the only one who wish this was a spoiler. Or at least UIM\_Verf(lucky impling drop)
---
you dont and never could
---
Some times i see shit like this and i want to get back into RS and then i remember i have barely any free time and wow Classic is coming and Borderlands 3. I need more time damn it.
---
I pay the $11 monthly. Its literally just the cost of lunch. But I do know people who RWT gold to buy bonds in game because 8m for 2 bonds costs like $5 lol.

Fist of Guthix is literally one of the worst minigames ever. Your nostalgia blinded brain may think it was good but it is not. You just afk in the middle while defending, and you just free spell mage afk when attacking.
---
If it was impossible what would be the point of the goal, there might be a little rng involved with rune thrown axes and wave scouting to hold pillars for as long as I can but yes it's possible but not easy

I‚Äôm still upset they weren‚Äôt named Niamh and Stiamh

Even with solo this is really good rng, especially seeing there aren't many duplicates

Definitely looks good! Can't wait for the quest;)

Good you prioritised the helm slot this time.

He's not worth your time, friend.

You get give the outfit in a certain order, so you won't get duplicates till you've got the full set in bank/inventory

It's always on 2500 gp, I am more scared selling it to a general store because there is no warning. Going to equip it at all times now so I can't do that lol

Same here, I teleport back to the GE WAY more than my gameplay requires, but it just feels cozy.  More than my poh even.

Doing the math, if he got max pints for 35 games, giving him 27 loot rolls per game, he would have 945 loot rolls total (about 472.5kc @ the bare minimum 500 points). Do yeah he's lucky cause he got the d axe (1/10k) but he's almost spot on for the tome (1/1k) and pyro pieces (1/150),

I think that Ill go for 83 anyways so I can teleport to more useful locations ( Ge, Draynor, etc. )

Thanks for your insight!

i like this comment, i do feel burned, to a crisp infact.
---
They talked about it last week... and it was a no
---
why are you using karil over god dhide?
---
so there is depending on if you like to collect. As you level your cooking you burn cook less and less to where you will not burn food anymore. Some rich players buy burnt food to collect it cause they cannot get anymore of it. for example i was gonna sell 1.5k burnt food for 1m but he switched the offer before i accepted and made it 10k
---
lmfao
---
How the fuck did you get scammed for that?
---
He was a good man... What a rotten way to die.
---
It really doesn't tell you everything. I did my best to keep it as vague as possible without making the title completely unrelated. But Verf himself said he doesn't mind spoiling, and he even posted this to his Twitter. But sorry if I spoiled it to ya.
---
Alternative name: Dinh's ballwark
---
So this is the reason behind the new line of sight update
---
cause im stupid alright, really really stupid.
---
I did my best on keeping it as vague as possible. I didn't mention the impling, didn't mention the loot.
---
I mean truly it's because I didn't read the guide fully &amp; was just using karils, I'm using gdhide now
---
470 dry you say xD? 
---
I got mine first at 1200kc and second at 1400kc.
---
The whole game is becoming rendiproof
---
Tbow is really only useful if the target‚Äôs mage level (or mage offence bonus) is around 200 or higher, which is only like 10-15 different enemies, most of which are bosses ofc.
---
Log out and change world to F2P?

It was 0 IQ play man.

You said you're doing a lot of slayer atm so I would use Ancient altar. You'd wanna do a lot of burst tasks so having quick access to ancients is ideal.

Jagex needs to make more quests that teach you to not just hold space bar through the dialouge.

Only issue is that serpentine helm exists and is a rare drop from zulrah.

I get that it has the whole venom / poison effect, but I'm curious as to how they'd upgrade nezzy by much without making serpentine crash hard

That's a horrible long merch. 800m made on a like 3.2b hold for half a year is nothing.

Warding was never coming out this year. Ever.

Isn't that like less than 50k? What's burnt foos going for these days

Is it true that the person who got him this particular imp get 1B?

Yeh thanks I have to walk all the way from the death spot grab 81 more runes and keep going enjoy 200k/hr next post

You should look up Jakeyosaurus' vid. Hellhounda in wildy are not great.
---
&gt;Some rich players buy burnt food to collect it cause they cannot get anymore of it.
---
??? You can *always* get burned food regardless of what level cooking you are. Just used the cooked item on your cooking utensil of choice again and you will intentionally burn the food.
---
They had to implement a guaranteed way so burn food as it's needed for some quests.
---
What a fucking nest
---
If you have about 25-30m you can farm mediums and masters through eclectics for profit. You just have to heavily invest and male profit per rangers and master uniques
---
Oh no
---
500 points = 2 rolls, 750 points = 3 rolls , 1k points = 4 rolls at the drop table. After that I don‚Äôt know because I use the wintertodt world
---
Isn't one of them guaranteed to be a totem piece, though?
---
You're both competing for the drop so yea it is competition. Some people prefer that to mindlessly following the same sequence of action to get you garenteed drop.
---
If you can't handle a bit of competition i don't know what to say.
---
Nobody wants more gambling in this game.  If anything it's a problem we all tolerate not enjoy.
---
I think it would be neat if it was on the actual tutorial island maybe just have it in an area where the noobs can see the bank area where the raiders are preparing and hanging out. Like behind a fence or put it in the cave area by the rats down a little cliff. Imagine killing your first enemy a weak ass rat and just down the cliffside you see endgame gear players prepping to fight some of the hardest enemies in the game. Maybe have vanakka mention to the noobs what's going on down there. It would be a cool way to show new players what possibilities they have before them on their adventure. Hell have a way to spectate the raid from there so they can see how awesome endgame content is. Get them noobs hooked early.
---
Not exactly. 500 is 1 roll, 1000 is 2 rolls guaranteed. Points in between increase your chance of an extra roll. 750 pts and you have a 50% chance at a third roll
---
I'm really bad at multi drop odds, but if I'm right I think like 1/~29,411
---
If anyone knows the correct answer please let me know and let me know how you figured it.
---
I did this 
---
    1-(511/512)^3 = 0.00584793835
---
    0.00584793835*0.00584793835 = 0.00003419838
---
    0.00003419838 = ~1/29,411

Should I buy BGS or DHCB first for vorkath?
---
I‚Äôve never really saved for big purchases before, and wanna start. Currently I use blowpipe only. 
---
Does the BGS spec make that big of a difference in kill time? How much better is DHCB in comparison to blowpipe?
---
We can only blame jagex's greed for this. It was a low cost monthly subscription. Then they increased the price and started pushing mtx on the players.
---
Gives me very little faith for osrs to preserve game integrity because no matter what they tell us now they're the ones in control.
---
you get a totem, an ensouled head and 3 rolls on the npcs drop table.
---
I know this might not be quite what you want, but you only need the interface open for 1 tick to teleport to any location other than the stronghold slayer cave by hitting 1+2 in quick succession if you want to go to the slayer tower.
---
Youre disappointed that you clicked something marked spoilers and got spoiled?

I'm pretty sure that you get the totem piece and the 3 drops, not seeing

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,‚Äù Mr. Trump told New York magazine in 2002. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.‚Äù
---
-trump parties with epstein regularly back in the day, same as clinton (who im not trying to protect, its just trying to get you to see that trump who is currently president also likely wanted him dead)
---
-epstein used maralago to recruit victims
---
-trump gave alex acosta, the states attorney from florida who gave epstein a sweetheart deal to avoid prosecution (why he wasnt in jail) a cabinet position (Secretary of labor)
---
-trump immediately pointed fingers after epstein died, a sure fire sign of guilt, knowing how trump operates.

To accuse Clinton and leave Trump out is essentially propaganda. Trumps fingerprints are all over this too.

50 bots all have mithril spears and bumrushing corp after dying, always having atleast 1 bot alive in the room so it doesn't reset hp, it's definitely doable. And it's all automatic so there's no effort.
---
Blowpipe is definitively not worth it if your trying to make money.
---
Regarding the bolts you use like 200/h so that's 60k/h cost.
---
Ruby bolts might be worth it at your range lvl but its minor.

I think it's more like 87 522

Hitting 1/512 two times on three rolls can happen three different ways: (1/512, 1/512, 511/512), (1/512, 1/511, 1/512) and (1/511, 1/512, 1/512). The roll that didnt hit the 1/512 can be any of the remaining 511 numbers, so you have 3x511 different ways to get two whips on three rolls. The total number of possible combinations of the three numbers is 512^3 and so the odds of getting two whips on three rolls are the number of combinations that gives two whips divided by the total possible number of combinations. 3x511/512^3 = 87 522
---
Are you poor?

What's your problem, are you angry or just an asshole?

The issue with that is that spears give shared xp on all styles and most of the accounts were 1 def iirc

Bots and gold farmers have already gotten the price dirt low. And it requires nothing but gold and 75 Def. This helms requirements are much more. It should have better stats.

As someone who actually has been diagnosed with OCD by a professional OCD is a living hell. The easiest way I can describe it is having repetitive thoughts. These thoughts are usually bad and can lead to things like anxiety and depression.

Doing it with Lavas is gonna take like 2-3 hours, just man up and do it, or don't train Rc. Remember it's a game, you don't HAVE to things you don't like doing

maybe an alt account and make that ur main or make ur current account while splashing on an alt til 94 mage

Hmm, this does make sense, but I can see this getting polled and failing.

I normally do all the brothers + 3 skeletons. Get a decent drop rate. Did 5 runs last night after a month of not playing and got my 3rd verac‚Äôs helm. So far maybe 170 runs in total and 10 armor pieces all together the best being Karil‚Äôs top.

I mean you only got 5 mins before needing to bank?  Sounds like they are controlling the world pretty well.   Also there have been clans locking down the high level world's for over a year that I know of.  You can use that world if your ok with being ragged constantly
---
I normally do brothers + 3 skeletons. What do you do to stay below 88%?
---
You're totally missing the point. The lesser demon is the arcade machine in this example.
---
You do realise that you are also just making your own life harder, right? If two people are fighting the same thing you both get less xp and have to spend time waiting for the respawn. You're just being a dick for no real reason.
---
When you get into the game more and become a member, I truly hope you get crashed doing whatever boss you're trying to do. Then you'll realise how much of an annoying pleb you were at lesser demon in f2p.

Im pretty sure you'd get +4 ranged bonus for a similar amount of wealth if you used rcb with twisted buckler but I could be wrong. Definitely upgrade your archers ring, literally doubles its effectiveness for very little effort. It doesnt matter if you havent start NMZ. A couple of million points isn't going to take long. I like bringing a ruby bolt switch for the start of the kill then diamonds for the final ~60%
---
The phishers are XtremeFish and other similar phishing companies, The people who setup the warning streams are usually from the group "RuneFake" run by "Asentrix".
---
They've started changing up their game to include fake chatters and fake followers which really slows down the detection rate since twitch has an API, they usually grab the top 5-10 streamers in the osrs category every minute or so and compare their account creation date, follower count, view count, active chatter count, title etc and then use that to build an automatic flagging system like "if someone has 4k viewers but none of those viewers are logged in or talking....it's suspcious, or if they have 4k viewers but less than say...10 followers" etc etc etc.
---
Using this they can have streams flagged to the twitch staff automatically so they can be reviewed and then banned manually..speeding things up.
---
The issue with those anti-phishing streams is they're also flagged, as you can see in the one I have running on my Raspberry pi Zero (it's been running since last Christmas when my wife bought it for me) = [https://i.imgur.com/K8uvKpB.png](https://i.imgur.com/K8uvKpB.png)

My noob ass friend literally clicked a stream when he saw double xp weekend. He called me and even sent me the link over discord.

You would need to obtain 152,877 master clues. If you would obtain all the different tiers of clues from impling jars, gaining one master clue would cost around 9400k with the vast majority of the cost coming from the dragon implings for elite clues (this takes into account all the other loot you get from the impling jars). Your reward casket will be 844k on average, cutting the net loss to 8550k. Multiplying that with the 152,877 masters you would need tells us you will lose just over 1300b to get all the 3rd age items. However, if we calculate that you can obtain and complete 2 master per hour, this way the time it would take is only 8 years, 8 months and 3 weeks. New meta!

I agree it doesn‚Äôt need a buff but i feel it needs a buff. Nice one

Was he in melee or range gear? He‚Äôs got blessed Dhide chaps but also B-ring, kinda confusing.
---
Best monster to kill for shield left half? Btw btw
---
Thanks
---
Shit happens when u buy gold lol
---
very nice
---
Melee. He had lance, and since I didn't get it on second thought there was no way for him to be a UIM. I just never expected the DFS and ring, thought I'd get the mask at best.
---
Wow! 150 kills, that means they have no chance of controlling the world.  You got lucky, try it out again a few more times.  I've been trying for over a year to get items on my Ironmeme, I dont have a main to buy the world with so I like you get 20-100ish kills and then give up for the day.
---
Should be way rarer, it should cost you a lot to get around carrying multiple.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm curious what his chest slot was to protect over the Dfs and B-ring, maybe BCP

To be fair, it's easy to put in insane hours if you're doing something else. You can probably work/go to the gym/play a console while doing it. Better than making no money at all for that period
---
Damn and I've had my offer to buy prims for 23m up for about 3 weeks :(
---
yeah basically since there are 3 rolls total and the whip is 1/512---
---
essentially we consider the chance of not getting a whip on the third drop (which is 511/512)
---
I‚Äôll get around to it . Shudder thinking about getting void on rs3 back in the days

SOMEHOW I DIDINT TELEPORT BEFORE HE CASTED A 1 FUCKING BIND OF TELEBLOCK ON MY ASSS BUT WHEN I CAST IT ON PEOPLE THEY NEVER GET THE FKING BLOCK THEY ALWAYS GET TO TELEPORT BEFORE I CAN FUCKING TELEBLOCK THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
id shit myself
---
Why do you keep saying their rsn like that's the only person there? we have 30+ people on at any given time. If it took us 5 minutes to show up then we were busy fighting in another world. If you think it's us and 2 salads why don't I invite you to the discord, show you 200 people and then kick you?
---
Keep crying. We're not trash, we run these total worlds and you will get attacked and forced to teleport every single time. I dare you to stay for longer than 2 minutes and you'll see exactly how many people log in.
---
Keep teleporting. You'll see us here every day and there's nothing you can do about it :)

Corn production which is also one of the leading contributors to air pollution in the world. I didn't mean to imply we will just die if the rain forest dies. But we will certainly kick ourselves into the next gear racing towards a complete eco collapse. 
---
  My point stands that we really need to give a shit about what is happening to our ecosystem and not try to downplay the importance of things like the rainforest burning down.

if you want constructive criticism canvas for opinions in a forum that allows for it.

I don't think RS2 following the naming structure past Isles since the next one was Glorious Memories. If I recall right, Exiles wasn't going to follow it either until one of the other mods pointed it out and Wolf updated the quest to fit the new name. Since he mentioned on the Q&amp;A the finale would rejoin the Fremennik and Moonclan, something like Reconciles would fit pretty well, but I wouldn't be opposed if they did a non-rhyming name either; there aren't that many good words that rhyme with Trials left...

Yes, biting in it will deal damage towards your dentalHP.

These videos are only because what they posted in my original threads saying i wasn't farming revs on 2k total worlds.

1: We run a protection service on the 2000 total worlds. We've helped hundreds of iron men get their rev weapons because they can't do it on normal worlds.
---
2: Our discord has hundreds of people in it, we're online and occupying those worlds 24/7.
---
3: You didn't tell us we were cute. You flamed us and cried about being attacked, and then proceeded to teleport immediately over 5 times and try to come here and say "oh they couldnt even kill a pvmer".
---
4: You got so triggered you had to come and make a reddit thread (which .. nobody is going to see) because you're angsty that we made you leave.

5: I see everything that goes on in these worlds within 60 seconds of something showing up. There's absolutely (and I know this for a fact) zero chance you killed 50x of any revenant in this cave without us knowing about it.

&gt;That motivated me enough to max from scratch, which I did in under 6 months with around 1700 total level. There was enough time inside maxing non-buyables to train an alt to a high enough level that by the time I needed to do buyables, my alt could do Zulrah, Vorkath, raid and fund all my buyables.
---
Bullshit. No way you're doing that while working+ studying full time.
---
That's over 6/hr a day at MAX efficiency. There's literally no way you're doing max efficiency for 6 months straight WHILE building an alt and farming money. Bullshit. Almost every single max ehp method is near tick perfect. You're not doing any of those for extended periods of time while making an alt.

Assuming no rune pouches and wearing air tiara so you carry 28 essence per trip: 93,104 trips.

Assuming each trip takes about 3 min: 279,312 minutes.  
---
279,312/60 = 4,655.2 hours = 193.97 (nonstop) days.

Assuming you‚Äôre not completely insane and only do 8 hours per day: 581.9 days, or a bit over a 1 1/2 years.

it isn't an excuse, it is a reality. the resulting drama and opinions that lead from misunderstanding that reality, that is, this post and posts like it are objectively non-constructive. they only serve to perpetuate a narrative of x-bad because they're on y-platform for the purpose of drama. obviously constructive feedback comes in from every avenue, this point was never in contention nor should it be - it is common sense.
---
this victimizing (yes, this very post from OP) serves no real purpose, other than to call-to-arms people to fight for a side. this post and others like it are adjacent to the conversation and take it out of context. that is to say, fostering a terrible place for constructive feedback as there is now room for an inherent bias if your opinion and or constructive feedback under this adjacent-to the conversation post goes against the narrative.
---
this is why it is not the fault of the user, it is the fault of the people canvasing opinions within these distinct and unique sub-communities of the game that don't have a heavy focus on constructive and objective feedback.
---
simple, obviously. but as seen with the warding fiasco that essentially devolved into a flame war, not constructive nor productive in the sense that real and earnest feedback was buried. quite literally on reddit, out of sight.
---
Censors his own name but leaves the stupid pvmer's name in, typical brainlet.

Yes, they're absolutely assholes. From my perspective, your delivery of all of this information also makes you an asshole too. Sure there are levels to all of this, but it's been incredibly petty on both sides of this thing.

Real world trading. Paying real world money for runescape gold.  A common way to give people real world money they bought is the gold buyer will sell an uncommonly bought item at a really really high price, and the seller will pay the price.

1. Any tools to help me train to be able to prayer switch and weapon switch against Crystalline Hunllef?

2. Once I am able to complete the Gauntlet every time, is this a decent method to get elite clue scrolls?

3. Does the corrupted Gauntlet give double chance of getting the pet and elite clue scrolls?

Thank you for your time and input!

I got void in about 7 hours on the med boat tbh, Mobile came in clutch for this too. Id just pop a random game having my morning coffee, pooping, at the airport in vegas playing slots before my flight home, waiting for my food at lunch, only took like a week playing causally and I didnt hardly notice the "grind"
---
The amount of doubters in the comment section always bothers me. Who is gonna get an achievement, and then lie about it. It's really concerning. Just say GZ and move on.
---
It's a pretty decent upgrade. The difference becomes less negligible as your KC increases, as the little amounts of damage add up to a lot of time saved. At the very least it saves at least 1 restore dose in a kill for me.
---
I used a guide and still fucked it up because I glazed over the line that says every players incantation is different. Then I wrote it down.

Do you not use prayer at Vork?

I've found the prayer bonus to be very relevant.

Daaamn. You rich irl? Could make bonk selling that name

9 year olds are becoming the majority of the playerbase

I have no idea why people don't like it. I looked at it and I was like "yeah that seems about right" and then I just saw everyone talking shit on it and I just don't get it.

Lance, amulet, boots, and ring. The rest of my gear will be worth maybe a hundred k.

all u could to is increase prayer bonus by getting blessed dhide body instead of karils. Scrap the wrench, and prayer pots, get 8 brews, 3 ranging pots, 30 chins, rest super restores. Addy darts are fine for jad, no need for dragon. Chins are for aggro on healers so that u never stop attacking jad. Minimal switches possible and u can out dps 1x or 2x healers.
---
I'd be fine if this one gave negative mage/range bonuses. It's got a lot more coverage around the eyes and will have better stats.
---
Pretty sure that's /u/LothricLegs

I wish maces and warhammers were more useful......

Watch sparc Mac's video about his rock golem/all of his pets next time you're there, that's what I attribute my luck to haha

They kill pvmers because they know they don‚Äôt fight back a majority of the time and they risk more than the 200k pkers risk.

It's not even just about oxygen production. Forests are some of the most effective carbon fixers on the planet. Without them, the rate at which atmospheric carbon accumulates will increase. Not to mention the burning of the rainforest is generating massive carbon emissions. This IS a disaster and shouldn't be downplayed.

Crucifixions are so damn expensive nowadays!

I personally don‚Äôt like the closed look of the helm and what I really like about the berserker and neits helms (besides good stats) is that you can see your characters face/beard.

With that being said we‚Äôre still very far from this quest‚Äôs release and there is plenty of time to get it right or just get used to it maybe.

I think PVM'ers are influcing that pole. The wilderness could use a nice revamp. Larrans Keys have junk drop table and could use TLC. The bosses are nice but 99% of the time if someone is killing them is because they need the pickaxe or are going for the pet. if all the bosses had more notible drop table it might bring more people out into the wildy. It would be cool if Calisto had some unique armor drops, venenatus had weapon drops, etc. I know people are generally against PVP weapons but i would be cool if they dropped from wildy bosses at similar drop rates to Bandos gear. They can balance it by making it buff you in the wildy only. So it is only BIS for pking.
---
That's precisely it. The Construction Cape can teleport you directly to your POH without the need of teleport runes or tablets. It also allows you unlimited teleports to any of the POH portals in Runescape. And as you said, you can then use any of your unlimited teleports inside your POH to go wherever you need!
---
and: you need 3 drops to create this itemscape
---
It's not that hard to draw a nice dick. That one looks worse than a would-be Runescape Classic porn webcomic.

The other one was better

Yeah but at least we are still getting things now, sparsely. How does the saying go? The loudest people are always the smallest minority? Something to that effect.  
---
I can understand their hesitation though. They don't want to fuck up and send the game into the dumpster again. They got lucky being able to reboot it, and having OSRS fall will probably result in a huge loss of RS in general.

Bonds are so expensive right now cuz everyone is bossing and buying 10 years of runescape in bonds.

Or you can do uber eats, deliver 3 pizzas in an hour and make 30 bucks. Boom, you got 15 mil.

I dont like it just because the house is already insanely overpowered. If they removed the pool or something a deposit box would be fine, but just adding more op shit to an already op skill is a no go from me.

Jagex just had to remove all references to "gambling" in BA in order to keep their app in the app store. the real reason they don't allow gambling is because they would be subject to new regulations because of it. if they actually cared about gambling restrictions the sand casino wouldn't exist, but that has enough reasonable doubt to keep people from classifying it as such.

There were like 5 people and I asked if someone dropped them but only got one reply and it seemed kinda shaky.

I should've just asked if someone dropped something instead.

except his point about marginal opinions was that downvotes hide them.

here is the reality of the situation, nerds on the internet have never been about to healthily provide feedback because healthy communication isn't a skill the average neet possesses. Why do you think online gaming communities are literal cesspools?

I'm sorry bro, but it looks like barrows just isn't for you lmao
---
I personally hate everything about the Freminik story line and would greatly prefer it if it was scrapped replaced with anything else, it's literally my least favorite
---
Don't need to say why the Diablo audience dislike them only announcing a mobile game. Anyone who's not a brainlet knows why they're upset.
---
I guess the idea is that it's not overpowered because it would not be viable for most bossing and pking due to negative defense bonuses. Also, with massive negative prayer bonuses, it hopefully wouldn't be OP for training or bossing since it would massively affect prayer point consumption. Just a fun piece of niche content (I hope).

Whoever bought that bowl seriously underestimated how much this Hydra will grow.

If your issue is banking, you are missing something. Take out the runes you need for teleporting and payment, your gear and pouches. Remove their placeholders. Next, fill your bank with the blank placeholders in the settings.
---
You can set up auto payment with the banker npc, and then use the deposit all button to deposit the other runes.
---
But yeah, diary lamps are nice too.

I guess it would probably have its passive removed. I do agree it is good for NMZ on its own.

No, it attacks with typeless dragonfire. Its not magic and magic defense has 0 effect on it. His reasoning his wrong so why defend it?

No

Lavas are the fastest but you lose money doing them
---
Steams are made in almost exactly the same way as lavas and are 5% slower but you do earn maybe 200k/hr instead of losing money, so that's something to consider

They really should ban the buyers, sellers don't care of one of the 100's of burn accounts they have is banned a player cares if their account is banned so players wouldn't risk it (especially when bonds exist) so the sellers wouldn't have the custom they need to make it worth it.

I would disagree. I'm pretty sure both ancestral and clue hunter set didn't have multiple takes and they both looked pretty great. Also, the wintertodt arena looks well done as well, though I'm unsure whether or not he was the artist/designer of it because iirc, ed had a pretty big role in it's making as well.

You know why they do it? Because it works. If idiots didn't give them shit, they wouldn't be begging.
---
Why?
---
Mod West's name was not in the news post of the original release of Zeah, if there was an update to that area with his name on it fine. I'm not sure if he was even hired at that time. 
---
I agree that artists of the game often stray away from the art-style of RuneScape 2. It's happened with Ghost, West, and most recently Gee. I don't think it's right to be spiteful to an artist and say all their work is bad, when it isn't, you just remember the bad stuff more.
---
Thanks for the comment.

Stick around for part 2. lots of improvement to come.

Most of the scammers and lurers nowadays are bots, thats why it seems like there is so many of them. Jagex bans thousands of them each day, but they have a way to get 1 week of membership for free so they just return everytime. Nothing will change until Jagex gets rid of that free promotion

Anyone else like this with the farming guild after 99 farming?
---
I use the cape tele to bank for most things anyway, and with the spirit tree right there I can then go tele anywhere else.  Plus I can do a few quick contracts while I figure out what I want to do next.  Farming guild is basically my home base now.

False, they are used all the time and are the most efficient for Slayer xp
---
Far from it. Most of my activity is on mobile too of they would freaking look into it
---
Way back when around 2002ish if you saw 1 or 2 people out by them selves usually just outside of a populated city you could bet they were trading between alts. As soon as the one logged out you would run to where he was standing and keep clicking. Stole so much stuff from people using alts. This was when no one trusted anyone. Scammers were way more prevalent and money much more valuable.
---
Fuck yeah, looks dope af!
---
I'm actually excited to get my hands on this! AHHH! I can't wait! The helmet itself looks pretty badass; I love the wings and faceguard, and I wonder how this'll look with justiciar for fashionscape reasons lol.
---
It doesn't. It looks too much like justiciar. I think design wise an item with a presumably high strength bonus shouldn't look like a defensive piece of equipment.

I just broke an 80 dry streak and got myself a dupe ahrims hood. Good times.

does this mean the hydra is a man
---
It‚Äôs /r/iamverybadass more so for the ‚Äúas for a guy he‚Äôs getting decked‚Äù. 
---
Also I completely think what you‚Äôre saying makes sense for the woman. But the fact you think a guy on the other hand should get decked right off the bat but not the girl is ridiculous, almost white knight sounding. Actually i can hardly even call it white knight sounding because it actually is disrespectful to women. it makes it sound like you have a lower expectation for them so youll be more patient or some shit. Keep it simple: someone is being a hazard towards your shop? try to kick them out or restraint them. Why should the gender matter.
---
Add ‚ÄúM a d Nuts‚Äù

I have quest cape and am doing diaries right now as well. Lvl 103. Hmu
---
Do quests until 30+ farming
---
Grow ranarrs for money if you want to.

For xp, do fruit trees and hardwood trees.  You can do regular trees but I find the gp/xp too high, so I'll only do willows.
---
Use runelite man. Can do a puzzle in 10 seconds

Are black nails not simply put useless as they‚Äôre not specifically required for anything?
---
Logged into my old alt and was surprised to see nearly maxed stats and several very rare items in my bank. I went to put a pin on my bank and logged out, the account was banned by the time I tried to log back in. Jagex says account was selling gold and would not do anything in the way of recovery. Just reset all my stats and wiped my inventory and bank.

Thanks will definitely try to do all of this

At first I was surprised, I thought you meant rs classic.

It‚Äôs honestly sad, the helmet looks amazing and for once fits in with old school and these nerds are going nuts over ‚Äúwhat have they done do my nezzy.‚Äù Now it‚Äôs going to get changed slightly just to satisfy them and look worse. I get it if their criticism is that it changes the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of old school because it might literally replace everyone  from wearing nezzy, but instead they‚Äôre just saying it looks like shit??
---
My initial drops were basically right on the kc, but I just recently broke an 80 dry streak.
---
If this was an ely or tbow or something sure.... But not a ring...
---
You think you're the first person to cry about this? Look up the youtube video by "imalsoben". He's a no namer but still got further than you ever will into this. Jagex moderators already gave an official reply, which was "It's the wilderness, nothing is forcing you to do anything with us and as such if you don't like what we do you can join a team and try to take over".
---
I like how you call it extortion when we've literally got a great community full of completely normal players and provide a way for iron men to complete their logs. You're delusional. What do you think would happen at 2k revs if we weren't there? you think random players would be able to just walk in and start farming?
---
No. Another clan would come shut you down and the difference between us and them is they wouldn't allow you to join them.
---
Keep crying to mods we've been open for over a year. You're a narcissistic freak who thinks they shouldn't be attacked in the wilderness. Lmfao you literally pretyped "stop attacking me ur wasting ur time on 1 person in 2k total"
---
It's def serene

Try 6

You pay once and wont have to unless there is no one in the instance. So I assume there is one bot standing there so u only have to pay once.

---
Not yet
---
I like the way it looks.
---
1) your best bet is to get accustomed to the "rhythm" of four attack sounds which should mentally prompt a prayer switch. Until you feel the rhythm, you should just count "1...2...3...4..." out loud
---
2) we don't know the drop rates yet, but from my experience, yes, it drops quite a lot of elite clues
---
3) again, we don't know drop rates, but it is believed that uniques are dropped from Corrupted at about 2.5x the normal rates

How to you spend the remainder of the points not spent on rune pouch?
---
i think it looks dumb. that is my subjective opinion on that helmet. it looks dumb. i dont like how it looks. that style of helmet is not something that my personal tastes enjoy. sometimes thats all there is to it. but im also not saying it shouldnt be added to the game. im just saying that me; an individual who plays the video game RuneScape, does not enjoy the look of that helmet.

To be fair to Twitter, at least on the Android mobile app, there's some sort of sorting algorithm in replies to tweets that seems to go by people you follow, and then by number of likes or other interactions.

I think the original design looks badass and still is easily identifiable as a Neitiznot derivative. The helm might be more tank oriented, and that would justify the closed-face design.

Not true but okay

Yeah bro you're right we're just a group of shitty people with a discord of over 300+ members that all interact with each other and pvm together and enjoy playing the game/laughing/having fun together. You're damn right that sure makes us a group of shitty people. Without us iron men would have no real way to complete their collection logs. Sorry that we have to charge a price for people to use our service. Money makes the world go round. We're not a charity. We can't have 5 clans stand on guard for you 24/7 losing hours of sleep each night for free. You're just so angry that you can't go in the wildy without being attacked. Keep crying lmao

170 dry on ironmeme. I actually quit for a few months because of the demotivation in this. All post collection log. Might post screenshot proof when Im home later.
---
Hey I keep seeing an add on facebook for like double experience for a week, is it real? It looks like its jagex but I do not know
---
is it so weird that an IRL friend could just be nice and not see a tbow as 1000$ but a couple of pixels. My friend does Duel arena and has bank value of 3-5b one day and 0 the next. I've held onto a tbow for him and hes gifted me atleast a bil in coins. Many people have too much gp to know what to do with it.

I was gonna say no one quits but sounds like he beat the game, nothing else to do lol
---
I‚Äôm not sure, nobody has gotten into the instance to see what they‚Äôre doing, but I assume that 100+ bots with mith spears returning could take out Corp
---
Also, if you're suiciding on the wine, you can run back at the last hp to the altar to die where you offer your bones. This leaves you additional food should you need to tank an actual geared pvper :p
---
The surprise is he changes worlds.
---
I noticed more neckbeard PvMers with DHCB crashing my KBD trips honestly then I did pkers. 
---
At least pkers leave me alone once I‚Äôm in.
---
I don't know but they constantly crash me self-splashing my alt :(
---
&gt;People lie about literally everything on runescape.
---
Is this somehow different than real life?
---
People don't understand how crazy good the stats on cheap shit is.
---
I think its kickass

It took everything I had not to burst out laughing

I‚Äôve seen a person give their irl friends a tbow while I was bankstanding, it‚Äôs not impossible to believe. Especially at a 4.5b bank (which isn‚Äôt unbelievable either) it‚Äôs not like that 1b is gonna do much to hurt him

Okay, I'm a junior computer engineering student and I don't get this.

Very much

I thought they put it back 2 weeks after this happened?

Yeah I'm kicking myself for it

What a dream.

Ya 'tis so cool, I like it.

At this rate we'll have to lock every piece of content behind a quest just because bots exist. Seems like we need a better solution to the botting problem doesn't it
---
Before I get railed, no I'm not a genius I don't know the solution either.
---
is 4 man best just because you get it down in three phases and have a "better chance" of being mvp? lets say I suck at zolcano and will never get mvp, does it matter what the group size is then? do you get better drop rolls if fewer people are doing it? genuine question, I defer to the community that 4 man is best, I just haven't ever actually seen someone say why other than "best profit"
---
No go away
---
We don't need any more 18 combat tier gear anyway. I support
---
Ruining another merching secret smh
---
Runecraft bad
---
Runecraft also profitable lol
---
\#keepitclosed

found the one league player lmao
---
Why not do Kumar's magic then? More profitable and more xp
---
Wowow, my hero &lt;3 
---
I feel like that deserves a post on its own.
---
Trade budget riley in for Riley Reid
---
Holy fuck this is actually revolutionary. I will take this over to Jagex HQ right now!! This innovative thinking is exactly what Jagex needs. Great thinking. I expect all bots to be banned by tomorrow if we implement this idea in the game. Thank you.
---
The exact point of this post is to propose a solution that *doesn't* fuck the Serp helm again. 
---
The current proposed helm is likely going to have a str bonus that matches or exceeds the Serp helm's str bonus, while having higher or at least the same defensive bonuses of the current Neitiznot helm. In its current form, it will be preferable to the Serp helm in most scenarios except those where you really need the venom.
---
This proposed suggestion is a way to make the helm BIS without being a direct upgrade to the Serp Helm, so it maintains its uses.
---
Thank you I really needed that laugh today
---
Yeah lol so many people who never been in medieval sword fights commenting üò§ smh
---
Thanks brother
---
Hello! Thanks for the reply, I have a question about the enemies in the tunnel, I've heard some people say that you should kill 3 skeletons and, I'm guessing that it is not worth it because you are just better off getting no bolt racks and more runes? 
---
Also I've read somewhere about killing the spiders in the tunnels to get closer to 880 but not actually go over it, so i was wondering if thats actually worth it or if spiders are just worse to kill, and last, im guessing the dragon med helm is not worth going for because of the time investment to get it vs the times you actually get it?
---
Sorry if im being annoying and asking too many questions, I'm just wondering because a lot of people seem to have different opinions on barrows and what you should do.
---
Still waiting for my 1gb tbow offer to go in
---
I wasn't trying to be a dick. Even if warding passed with 95% it's a humongous piece of content that would go through multiple revisions and announced public testing. It wasn't going to come out till atleast Q1 2020.
---
Never said that mate, but the helmets still exist, common sense tells us those helmets weren‚Äôt for decoration
---
Thanks for contributing to bots and gold farmers fuckface
---
Yeah, the Ironman thing is me. I‚Äôm happy to pay way more than I would ever feasibly use, but I don‚Äôt like having to do things regularly. Like the salts/crystals for the trollheim tele in the nexus.
---
No need for it really. If you make a not bis str variant then it‚Äôll just be obsolete. No reason to not have open visor when you have serp and justicar already
---
Wtf would even be the scam?
---
nice
---
I use void to minimize switches toxic trident occult  god book eternal boots. Range I only swap helm and bp I also bring melee helm and ancient mace to over prayerpot at my house between runs I also heal at my house with bp spec. I have 80 prayer and I only sip 1 dose in final tunnel.  U may need food with your stats.  U could bring better melee gear to spec higher with ancient mace giving higher prayer.  And I think u need like 55 cons for attack dummy

It's not removed, the limit is just higher. I am still hitting the limit when impling hunting.

No children are not typically abnormally small. There is a difference between small &amp; abnormally small.

That dynamic login screen was so epic.
---
One bite will fill the stomach of a grown man!
---
I think you've missed the part though that I mentioned just "being loud and annoying" is the motivator. I know as a guy, if I'm yelling at another guy while drunk and getting close to him and pissing him off, I can expect to be met with a physical response. I wouldn't ever say that's the right way to handle the situation, moreso just what I'd expect from my own life experience with how guys react to things.
---
But a guy doing that to a girl (in my opinion) shows a greater lack of morals. I'm not trying to say hitting a guy isn't wrong, just moreso expected. And I don't want to delve too deep into the "men are biologically stronger than women" point because it's not really the fish I was trying to fry.
---
I think you're an idiot if you resort to violence as a response to anything other than violence threatening the safety of yourself or those around you. And at that point it doesn't matter if it's a man, woman or animal.
---
You‚Äôre being downvoted so others don‚Äôt see lol

I know this guy, he's a friend from Escape From Tarkov. Jeeze...

Not a smart move.

Hes eating his words now

Potentially Neitiznot helm + slayer helm combo?

Start by finding snd following a guide to get barrows gloves. They make everything combat related significantly easier.
---
Yes but I think by the time these cards existed in stores it was up to $7.
---
People would vote "No" and say they don't want 07 to become rs3
---
still better money than the other log cutting options.
---
Well at least you cant do wintertodt. This might be one of the most original ironmen out there because of that.
---
You want 50m? Nah POTIONS
---
mining is regarded as one of the more aids skills in the game despite having several training methods. I‚Äôm on the road to max and going to 100% do mlm. I‚Äôd rather keep my fingers happy.
---
Honestly. Most people pking, aren't pking on their main. They're pking on an account with dedicated stats to pk. You will be at a disadvantage and most people will be able to tell pretty quickly. Pking is very unforgiving but very rewarding. Which is why most people enjoy it. Try leveling the playing field with an account dedicated to pking. I think this will help you a lot. I always kind of struggled pking until I made an account dedicated to pking. Which is now my main account. And now I have two more accounts dedicated to pking. Watch torvesta. The accounts he's using are legit.

Damn she thicc

Some guy at the GE was dropping a godsword and picking it up as people ran to get it. One time he was to slow and a lvl 32 me had a fancy new sword.
---
Actually, the problem is that there isn't better gear. Justiciar gear is the best gear to use for the easiest run through the inferno, which is why people think it's less legitimate when people use it.

&gt;dehumanization
---
you mean treating the 20 million amazon residents like normal human beings in need of care and opportunity, just like everyone else? yea sure buddy, no. 
---
the fact is that mainstream media hates Bolsonaro, globalists that want the Amazon for themselves hate Bolsonaro and probably you too hate him. It's also a fact that fire isn't nearly as big as the one we had in 2015, which you heard nothing of. 
---
I recommend watching Bolsonaro's most recent statement on the whole situation, published on the official twitter account of Planalto, if you want any real info on what's being done.
---
Upvoted for positive interactions

When did they release reqs?
---
there are multiple calculators online, for any skill

Did you though, did you really, or are you just spamming these stupid fucking subs

I‚Äôm new-ish to the game, haven‚Äôt gone wilderness yet besides Ardougne lever. Can you protect your items at all?

Wow your friend got so lucky meeting such a generous player! /s

Mining guild iron ore spawn with varrock platebody gets me 72K exp/hr with full concentration and dropping ores. Did this from 60-70 for SoTE.

Honestly just watch the video WOOX put out.  It'll be way more helpful than anything you read

Mine was a 6 hour justiciar cape btw

If you go to the volcano on karamja and climb down the rope, i believe you can go north up to a gate that will lead you to the entrance of the Dragon. As opposed to going through Entrana or whatever Island you originally came from!
---
haha yea i thought his name was quite fitting!
---
I just got mine too with 20 hours of playtime. Gz man!
---
Liked and subscribed. The edits you made were pretty hilarious. My suggestion would be to make an intro to use for every video that outlines some of the logic for your account.
---
R u sure 70k? I got 50
---
Iron men cant use others houses?
---
Yea I was surprised how full it was on w2! It's nice to see people are pvping for fun still, but yea i'm sure there are plenty of toxic ppl there too :P
---
i in capital makes I
---
Yeah the grey handle would just change to the standard brown if you attached any bronze-rune and the wooden one worked on the dragon axe head as well.
---
Also you couldn't re-equip the axe handle once removed so I doubt the fashion scape statement unless he literally never did any combat.
