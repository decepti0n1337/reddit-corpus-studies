After my 3rd age luck, I swear by clue scrolls. Little rolls of gold

How is this even possible? I can‚Äôt wrap my brain around that much wealth honestly. I tend to blow my money on the dumbest shit or just flat out give it away for no reason. Props for the amount of hours that must have went in to the account. 
---
This is actually a really good idea. Or even if they dropped like seeds or something. 
---
What are you doing step bro??
---
I fully agree. 2330 total rs3 Ironman speaking, best gamemode there is (although there are many flaws like beach event and such but very small in comparison to mtx). 
---
Yeah i just got on my main and did it with a few buds...just leeched points 
---
Don't be braindead!1!!!!1!

No one asked you to go in the wilderness lol. You are the definition of a little bitch, inserting yourself somewhere and crying when things dont go as planned. I kill people with no gear just so people like you cry.

You posted this in the wrong place u/ditchthesnake111

r/2007scape is basically a roast thread at this point with a few lewds, memes, and swapletics sacrifices sprinkled in.

I used to do speed alot but that shit fucks you up. And mainly use coke to go bossing during the weekend.. fuck long term skilling XD!
---
You are an absolute unit compared to me when I did Dream Mentor lol, abyssal whip and dragon chainbody is all I had
---
Name and shame the little snake who reported you 
---
Yeah. Me mocking someone proud of PKing a UIM is why ‚Äúeveryone hates us.‚Äù Okay. Lmao.
---
Took me forever to realise it wasn't just a regular zipline, and the character is literally holding on to the thing with his teeth...

On the bright side, it could make quick work of a tooth infection

The real issue with RWT is that it encourages gold farming which in turn has a pretty significant impact on the economy. In the past, we've seen items like Dragon bones plummet due to gold farming en masse. This can be unhealthy for the game. Moreover, some gold farmers bring actual coins into the game, potentially contributing to inflation. Whether or not inflation is an issue is debatable, but it should be obvious from these examples how RWT can adversely affect the community as a whole. If RWT did not affect the economy and was conducted in a completely legitimate manner (i.e. bonds), I think you would find many players to be more accepting, even if they do not participate in RWT themselves.

Do as many early member's quests as you can. Starting with completing Fairy Tale part 1, and starting Fairy Tale part 2. This unlocks the Fairy Rings, which are one of the most convenient teleport systems available.

Use alt(s) to venom slayer monsters, attack with blowpipe till they're low hp and finish the monsters by attacking at the same time with your alt(s) using range/mage and unique account using melee. Your unique account gets half slayer xp each kill.

No.

Because Runescape is the #1 MMORPG in the world right now.

How do you plan on making the dragon javelins

If you want bis range def, it needs negative attack stats.

Graceful is useful for absolutely any time that you're not in combat, or using a skill outfit.

You still need to pay attention to the falling boulders, sometimes you can't be sure of which style it is going to use until after it chunks you a 35, not to mention switching your own gear and your protection prayers AND piety/rigour. I can do zulrah by paying just as much attention as I do when I runecraft, gorillas are way more attention demanding due to their random nature vs zulrah's list of set rotations which is narrowed down to two after the third "spawn", and then down to one depending on where the range phase spawns.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
And the drug is runescape
---
1. That's why I called it lame
---
2. "Some people play for fun" doesn't even apply when you're comparing training cooking with wines vs cooking with sharks. It's not like something like "It's a waste of time to play castle wars, that's inefficient." It's a simple cost-benefit difference where it makes no sense to give up a significant amount of xp for negligible profit compared to actual dedicated money makers.
---
Nobody is watching their character cook sharks "for fun," so don't pretend like you are.

One word for that is IDIOT.

I've played runescape through some Rocky times. Removal of free trade and the wildy, EOC and Mtx  and it has never really crossed my mind that it could just disappear. I suppose if it did disappear I don't think I'd be sad because it ended, is he happy that it happened. We have a lot to thank  Andrew Gower for. This game has helped me through a lot of bad times in my life.

Please lock this thread.

You're not training RC properly, you need to get a tbow drop from CoX then use the money to pay for 4 lvl75 ess runners at the ZMI

ah yeah. those 11 woman are far from any "leftist diversity ideology". having 11 woman in a company with 300 employees is rather quite underwhelming.

Fairness is being judged on merit. If you have to make a point about diversity then you aren't judging on merit and thus being unfair.

yup. this is far from diverse.

67 is max range for someone with 99 attack or strength without gaining combat levels.

Of all the things to lie about, why this?

did you find a guy with like a bank‚Äôs worth of stuff and then kill him to take his stuff? I don‚Äôt know most of these terms

We're all aware of the dangers of the wild when we step out there. The first rule of the wild is never bring anything you're not willing to lose. Don't sweat.
---
I would froth at it for bandos tanking
---
I wish were people in the gaming community were like you OP. Most of them are not good people. They literally hate people who aren't like them. It isn't worth it to try to convince them. They will always hate people who they've never met. They've never gotten out of their home town and actually experienced the world.
---
 67 is max range for someone with 99 attack or strength without gaining combat levels. Nice one you fucking idiot. BTW he's 67 range already.

Allow crystals to imbue your moulds so that you can use them on a furnace (only in priff) and not need to carry them with you on every smithing/crafting run to the furnace. (amulet/ring/sickle moulds etc)

Meh

Why are you sweaty?
---
Google it for the email you're using. The set up is different for gmail, hotmail etc. It will be easy to put 2fa on email. It's similar to authenticator on RS. I'd suggest you adding that ASAP. Someone knows your password..
---
Literally the first post on there included a screenshot of a guy saying to contact Jagex cause "he probably rwted the tbow". And again, how is keeping your drop scamming? Never has it been against the rules, and always has the mechanic been that one person gets the drop. If you want to guarantee getting splits, go with people you know well. 
---
no. in fact its encouraged.

No cuz he aint there

As someone who is tattooed from throat to feet I just want to say that having something meaningful is the best. Maybe a part of the game really struck a chord with you or you've a vivid memory that makes you smile you could get immortalised on your body. Tattoo artists can turn ideas into a beautiful piece if given the freedom :)

Yea they had one or two of them when I went there

honestly you shouldn't have a problem on your own. nobody pks at vetion. the people hitting you will be in jaja tier rags and probably not very smart. a little understanding of the wilderness and you can easily get gap and log
---
I know it‚Äôs 60% percent women. But then again what do I know, I‚Äôm posting on the osrs subreddit
---
Because OP didn't pick it up, when you die your items can still be picked up even if you're an Ironman. But as soon as another player grabs it by any means they can't drop it for them or trade it back
---
I have reported you for real world trading. Enjoy the ban, kid. Stay in school.
---
I know man it's a bitch. Everytime i think i'm getting close i remind myself I'm no further than where i started... except richer lol
---
Despite the fact that PvP in Runescape is highly punishing compared to most mmorpgs, ridiculous situations like this is how you keep some level of interest in getting people into the wilderness. Absolutely unconventional in nature because you could have gained so much more, you prevented someone from probably rage quitting and taking yet another person out of the wilderness.
---
Unfortunately (or fortunately for herb prices) the white lily only affects allotment patches, not herb patches. At least that's my understanding.
---
They protect allotment patches only, not herb patches, so they wouldn't help herbs survive. The patch will remain alive when fully grown until you harvest it, so you can leave it indefinitely. They're useful if you're growing snape grass or watermelon in your allotments for exp.

It's just a stupid idea. I don't have to dissect such a poorly thought out and needless idea in order to express how bad it is. 
---
Why did you take such offense to feedback on 'not your idea'
---
It sucks.
---
People here are being nice nobody really cares when you say ‚Äúbase‚Äù anything but ye gj or whatever 
---
Think of it in terms of a dice roll, where every roll is completely independent of each other.  
---
You have a 1/6 chance of rolling any number on a dice, so say you're going for a six. If you roll 6 times, that does not mean you have 100% chance of getting a six. If you roll 10 times, still won't be guaranteed to get a 6 even though you've doing something with a 1/6 chance 10 times. This person has essentially rolled a die with 2000 sides about 3150 times, and has not fallen on the single digit he needs on the die to get a pet.
---
My body is Regicide
---
Take my boards in July/August. Just finished a cardiac critical care rotation haha. Shame college flew by so quickly.
---
Non-instanced bossing helps keep the influx of unique items stable
---
So basically you want more xp/h while crashing rune prices even more?
---
Much better than warding. 
---
You can get a master clue scroll as a reward from a medium clue, that's what he's saying. So instead of the normal route where you hand in 1 of each clue, you can just farm mediums and do master clue scrolls whenever you get them as a reward.
---
Where did I take offense? 
---
We shouldn't not have new content just because it makes shitty old content "dead content."
---
I dont even have base 50s and I'm almost 2k total lul 
---
Fuck rc and farming 
---
Is one extra second gonna really crash prices?
---
/Zuhaar please 
---
You can see my previous post in my history, where I did an earlier set of 150 barrows runs. That set equaled out to 11mil.
---
This set of 150, I had really good RNG (I think), and the value of my loot almost doubled the last set, for 21.4mil.
---
Why have I been doing sets of 150 barrows runs? To put it simply, because I'm garbage at pking. I did the first set of 150 because my bank dropped from 50mil to like 20mil from drunk pking. Then I ended up getting smited for a staff of light, a zgs, and a b ring (i) on 3 separate occasions, so I decided to go for a second set of 150 barrows runs. 
---
Now, my bank was sitting at about 30 mil again after this recent set. So I immediately went pking on the pvp world once i hit 150 runs, and within an hour, I lost an ags and a zgs. Fucking British pvp world and that fucking lag. I am so fucking rattled right now... Anyways, I quit for at least a few weeks lol. 
---
I will be back in 2 weeks or so.

---
Like I literally asked my doctor if she would prescribe me addy. She was like 'in the future everyone will be using it"
---
She didn't even care
---
When you bring nothing but a weapon, some food and attack pots, and they leave everything on the ground when you get back, track you in a spot which gives no good loot, just a quick slayer task, and spam ‚Äúsit‚Äù and ‚Äúbye‚Äù, bringing 4 people to do it, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty much griefing.
---
Thank god for turning private chat off

I really don't see why such a minor change would break the integrity of Oldschool

You knew you were going to the wild, you should‚Äôve just banked and then went 
---
I'm not suggesting we change up things completely, this isn't a major rehaul of the skill, it's a simple QoL change that will make it less annoying to train. I doubt it'll have very much impact in the game outside of making the skill slightly less annoying

I'm sorry that you feel such hostility toward a statement recommending self protection. I can only presume your reasons for being so against someone having proof that they handed someone potentially hundreds of dollars worth of in-game gold.
---
I didn't say it was right, but that's how the world is. A very small number of shitty people ruin things for everyone else. That's why sites like runewatch exist. If you hate the idea of runewatch, maybe you're the reason we need it.
---
Which spaces? I just need to get in tweeter for five minutes to see all this bullshit propaganda, get mad, and hope I didn't. I don't need others to tell me what to think, or what to do. Just becouse you are a brainless puppet, doesn't make everyone like you.

I will reference others, and link or credit them, be ouse a quick search will bring enough info to back my words, I don't just talk shit and hope other to believe it, not everyone is like you.

If you ask me, the POH has been desecrated by the culture of efficiency dominating modern day RuneScape since the majority of its player base is too old to be imaginative anymore. No one does anything fun with their POH anymore its all about prayer xp and tps. These house owners are providing a service that only exists because of our boner for efficiency. A good ass house back in the day was Sirfalcon44 that crazy bastard had 5 rooms that weren't underground and the rest was steel dragons and a massive dungeon where you'd have an actual house party killing people. Those were the golden days of the POH, then xp didn't dominate the game and no one criticized anyone for having sub optimum gear or whatever, cause we were just dicking around and that's how I liked it.

Now days you have a team of 50 log in on you and take turns speccing you and barraging you all the way to edge if you tank the specs. This never happened back in the day, or rarely ever. At worst I'd have an elvemage wannabe come try and msb spec me and run when I start dds speccing him back.

Revs is aids. Its good money if you have the patience - personally thats something I do not have. Literally having to tele every other minute is fucking aids. Being DD'd by a team of 20 for a few monkfish = literal aids. Pking as a whole now is different from back in the day and its either maxed pures/max efficiency pking accounts fighting each other in the same setup at edge/ge or its clans camping revs because killing 3 itemers for nothing is "fun" or whatever. 
---
I got no problem with people pking in the wildy. Its what it's there for. Obviously you take the risk of being attacked. I just cba to deal with so many tryhard raggers lol.

If someone has a pet in the wild near the boss that drops the pet they probably just got that pet. If you kill that person you are scum, for what like max a few mil PK? Most pkers aren't new to the game or hobos, a few mil ain't worth taking away someones pet and if it is let me repeat that you are scum.

i got perma-banned for typing 'redtube' as a joke in a clan chat. someone reported for website advertising

it took me about 5 seconds to type what i typed lmao
---
Agreed, sometimes you have to compete for resources it‚Äôs a multiplayer game after all. If it‚Äôs too busy go at a different time, and if you can‚Äôt manage that I‚Äôm afraid you don‚Äôt get to do the boss without crashing someone 
---
Once? Not hard. 700,000 times is slightly more cumbersome. 
---
Equal opportunity dose not exist

92 according to Hiscores
---
Yes addy darts

1. no1 watches their character cook sharks, it's a fairy afk thing to do
---
2. not everyone can stand doing one boss every single day for money. people like variety. 
---
3. wines require more screen time. 25 hours of more constant screen time is not as valuable as 35 hours of 1 minute afk intervals to most
---
i agree
---
No

April fools idea: tbow spawns once every 20 seconds near farming guild, doesn‚Äôt get rolled back

Really worked out huh?

They are called big sharks you cant eat them

Hahaha get rekt noob

you can let me have your account, lol

big sharks that you can stuff and mount in your house

Do Knight‚Äôs Sword

haha perfect

it's a good way to spread players out across the world. instead of nobody doing werewolf agility, it'll be populated and players get rewards for it.
---
Who hurt you 
---
That's assuming that you would only be smithing. A lot of people would want to split it up and do something else instead of doing all the smithing in one go.
---
How much easier do they need to make it you can already drop a whole inventory in less than 5 seconds 
---
The wikipedia says you can, but I would seriously recommend ranging. During one of his phases you will be very limited for attacking him as he sends waves of water where you must stand in a certain spot. Also you will take more damage has he can also then hit you with a third attack style. 
---
why does this exist

imagine raiding with someone who has 32k gp. That seems like unnecessary stress

I am level 65 combat and got 38 lava dragons as a slayer task (lvl 37 slayer), what am I even supposed to do? I can't ask for another task and got no slayer points. I was using vannaka as master but by mistake talked to krystelia and messed things up. Any advice for a noob.
---
You will know when you lose the quest cape, As they havent added the quest yet, Its called the song of the elfs, You would need to have  at least 70 in 8 skills ,agilty, woodcutting, mining, thiveing, herblore, construction, hunter, smiteing, farming. 
---
You're a fucking loser irl
---
You‚Äôve gotta remember to empty the pee every now and then
---
Would you rather a surgeon who has killed 100% of his patients or a guy who just watches some youtube videos on the surgery but hasn't actually killed anyone.
---
mlm is like 35k exp/h if you're paying some attention, little lower if you're afking pretty hard. blast mine is solidly not afk but more like 60k exp/h at 80 and higher exp at 90+
---
&gt;:^)
---
Crops his own name, but leaves in Meaty Donger. 
---
Nice
---
I think it's fair to say that randomly boosting exp rates of any skill and calling it QoL is frowned upon by the general community
---
Loads of people lol? Why would I get 99 cooking? Really can't be fucked, completely useless cape for a main
---
LMAO wonder what he was doing in the wilderness
---
... How is that racist?
---
purple black
---
Yeah I need to hear this too lol
---
Its usually about the gp, you can save gp from 70-73
---
What? You can't think of a single scenario?
---
I rarely use both hands for my phone. Only when typing. Sometimes I'm eating or holding my girlfriend's hand or even petting my cat. Even if I'm not using my left hand I usually am holding my phone one handed. RuneScape is the only app I can't do that with and it's annoying enough that I won't play sometimes. 
---
It would count as your first cape either way 
---
Better than a sand casino addiction!
---
why does it take you six seconds to empty pouches and click the altar again? is there something i'm missing? it only takes me like 2 seconds at most with 3 pouches
---
runecrafting is life 
---
The ironic part is that efficient cooking is over double the xp/hr of wines and profit
---
What is wrong with cringey autists doing these "i got no1 to share with posts" how about you make some fucking friends dipshit
---
Sounds like a hormonal/circadian imbalance.
---
In no way is amphetamine the permanent answer to any disease.
---
I see no reason why this shouldn't be a happy medium.
---
With shift-click empty, anyone can 1t empty...this would be a true QoL change without impacting rates
---
Maxed main 
---
mad respect ‚úä

Just get the fire cape it's extremely easy 
---
I am meaty donger and I approve of this 99

Do you guys date? All this talk about nutting and boners. 
---
I didn't believe you at first but I just checked and what the hell it actually uses spec.
---
:) gz 
---
What's up Sallom, it's Mishani. Pretty sure you and I have flamed each other too at times, but I don't see why you should be permed.
---
Why the fuck would they perm mute you but people like Lucinda who Sabo all the time, being reported through tipoff relentlessly, aren't banned and aren't perm muted. Same goes for anyone else that has sabod for years or flamed just as much. 
---
Hm. I'm sort of on board with it however te fact is that its locked behind a "hard" quest. So bringing a freeze type spell to f2p would be kind of..idk. I dont think it could ever happen simply because it would have to be a brand new spell coming over. 
---
Yeah, I've gotten a few opinions over the years. I got mononucleosis when I was 16 and that's when it really started getting bad. I've tried everything from regular exercise and cardio to sleeping pills and yoga. 
---
??
---
If you‚Äôre dual monitoring and doing something that only needs a click or two a minute, that‚Äôs pretty easy. It‚Äôs not exactly difficult to find a second to click during league. There‚Äôs plenty of walking around, sitting in bushes, and just general afking. Hell now that you mention it I‚Äôm pretty sure my support is probably doing inferno on his other screen, that‚Äôd explain a lot. 
---
An open tunnel agility course that goes under the main pathways through the city so we can watch people train would be cool. It would be a neat contrast from rooftops where we can't see players when they are on the course. 
---
Maybe even something to interact with them. Like throwing rotten tomatoes. They get an exclamation over their head and if they click it in time they dodge the tomato, gaining them some xp. 
---
meaty donger confirmed
---
yes absolutely.
---
Having no moral qualms is one thing, but taking pleasure in ruining their day is another and it's pretty messed up.  
---
Might as well remove the defence requirement for full bandos so pures can use that too
---
Your inventory is a mess. Clean that up lad.
---
You're like fifteen years behind. Modern woke means taking a university spot from an asian person with low 90s and giving it a non asian person with mid 80s and keeping detailed information on everyone's genetic history so that you can report your diversity metrics. This allows people to look beyond skin colour because of good reasons that we can't tell you.
---
im sure ur streams are far more interesting
---
There‚Äôs definitely a cap, but it takes a long time. Here‚Äôs an example: https://imgur.com/a/IqHKj

There's a couple better things but require actual effort to do like Sacred eels, Anglers, and Amethyst mining.

LOL bruh
---
There's 2 other ranges 1 square from a bank people can't stand on so it's not a problem at all
---
Here‚Äôs some ideas, they‚Äôre not all reasonable:  
---
Increase attack speed by 1 tick  
---
Slight attack bonuses in melee and range  
---
Low weight, maybe a similar effect as graceful with the run energy  
---
Some kind of recoil mechanic? Like if your opponent hits, your next attack has a higher chance of hitting  
---
Boosted range strength  
---
As a set, reduces degradation rate of other crystal items/weaponry  
---
My brain hurts. Like everything in life there needs to be a balance. Can‚Äôt say x amount of dopamine or serotonin will make you happier. Wish the brain was as simple as this pic. 
---

---
Not to mention the permanent brain damage.
---
Amphetamines are one of the scariest drugs that physically alter your brain.  It completely fucks up your dopamine response completely turning you into a drug addict.
---
Better idea: lets not.
---
Instead, keep the game how it is.
---
How the fuck is that what you get from the chatbox? I thought the brainlet thing was just a meme on this sub but I guess not
---
Negative. Unless hes with a clan or team of several its utter aids to skull at revs even if naked. That place is aids riddled even when unskulled fucking 3 iteming. Youre a prime target if you have a skull.

 ü¶Äü¶Äü¶ÄRUNECRAFTING IS BAD ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
well he replied to me,
---
 I was already being attacked when I got the kill. Was focused on staying alive so I actually didn't even notice I got the pet. I said something along the lines of "Enjoy your 50k loot" and then right as they killed me they said "Gg pet". When I respawned in Falador I scrolled up and surely enough there it was. Haunts me to this day 
---
gg unfortunate situation really, I was obviously wrong and do apologize for wasting your time, he also said he got tbed before he finished kill and there was 3 pkers.
---
Actually it's pretty great because almost everyone is level 1 or 3+
---
Seems interesting, thanks for the recommendation!
---
But it asks you to go kill a variety of monsters.. like artisan would have you go do a variety of skilling activities.
---
Those are really good!
---
"What the fuck are you talking about?"
---
i am 900 dry. Please kill me.
---
Sounds nice will wanan join the discord
---
oooh yeah bossing sounds good! i've never had the oppurtunity to try late game bosses. pretty nervous
---
Runelite's idle notification + something uber afk like NMZ / etc.
---
Just click every time you need to walk a long distance or home TP. Definitely should be dual monitoring. 
---
Brainlet 
---
Nice try deep wildly clanner.
---
Nah, he should just start shooting heroin. More effective.
---
I have no idea ive never had nor pked an ult IM but im assuming you can cause ive seen a couple posts of leaving UIM their loot but i dont have any surefire proof
---
Why not just incorporate that into each skill? Seems lazy, at least dungeoneering had a better plan to combine every skill
---
How is it you can get 10 ranger boots to 1 unicornmask but I'm sitting on 0 and 4 respectively with 500 clues logged?

You know you get bonus xp at the end of a boss slayer task, right? And at the end of a fight caves slayer task, right?
---
I did DS2 a couple weeks ago, on mobile none the less. I have max melee except for 92 def and 95 ranged, I failed galvek like 15 times using ranged but then I decided to give a go at it with a lance and got him on the first try, zammy hasta shouldn‚Äôt be much worse but I had a lot of time to memorize his attacks.
---
Do you have an online collection of art by chance?
---
So is dopamine and most neurotransmitters hmm....
---
This is definitely RWT.. And what's funnier is that this reads like a Venezuelan getting this weeks food together.
---
So you're opposed to slayer then, right? Because you get bonus xp for completing a boss slayer task or a fight caves slayer task.
---
ooooh i member

Quality assurance. Basically people who make sure that what is presented to the customer is what the company delivers. 
---
In games that means testing updates so the experience is delivered as intended. 
---
This asshole won $2000 with my Facebook account and charge back$100 on PayPal. Do not make business with this Asian.
---
Lmao the customer support 
---
Just give f2p the whole game while you‚Äôre at it. Not to mention unlocking ice rush requires access to members areas and quests. So there‚Äôs that.
---
u/Unratedex is the shit! u/girl_send_nudes_plz can only dream of having a life as fulfilling as u/Unratedex

Got any more?

Rank?

Honestly this is the best way to start nowadays. You can boss for gold and have so much more to do. But that magic and ranged is sad you cant even do barrows

Clever

---
Um my landscape HCUIM would like an apology from you.
---
HAH GAEEEE!
---
You shouldve demanded 10m lmao
---
Why not incorporate slayer into the various combat skills? Maybe you need 90 str to turn the winch to open cerberus's lair, 90 magic to be able to manipulate the abyssal energies to allow yourself to teleport into sire's lair, maybe hydra needs to be fight using a special prayer that you can only use at 90 prayer, etc.
---
if it's a PK then the loot disappears after 2 minutes I thought? 1 min pker only 1 min to everybody then it despawns 
---
Sure?
---
you REALLY want to risk another big fuckup for them attempting to fix something...?
---
Oh yes god forbid magicrock make gets an extra 1k xp/hr
---
Can someone explain what‚Äôs going on here?
---
Its a crazy balancing act that requires an intense investment into the game and more game knowledge than even most skilled players possess. I'd look up some stuff on youtube about the different strategies they use to skill and what not. I believe someone recently maxed a UIM account if I'm not mistaken so it isn't impossible to be successful with the mode just a crazy time sink. 
---
The main way to do it though is to only do one thing at a time and only have a few items you keep with you forever. So like a dragon pick would be something you keep forever but before you get a d pick you just buy a new pick ever time you need to mine. So coin stack would obviously be another thing you keep on you at all times. This could an outdated method as well, it has been a while since I last tried the mode out. Your best bet for checking it out would be youtube like I mentioned before.
---
Jagex needs to respond
---
What makes people do stuff like this on their first account? Whenever I am out skilling, I see people with extremely low stats, but they will have 70-90+ in whatever heinous skill they are training (wc, fishing, rc, agi). I honestly don't get it. I can't picture anyone picking up a game with such a vast world and being like, "I just want to afk click instead of exploring." I always just assume these people are bots. If you are someone who has an account like this and are not botting, I am genuinely curious what prompted you to make such choices. 
---
See now I've always been the opposite. The quests are well done and all but Camelot always just seems so.....cheap? to me. I love the stories about King Arthur, but I feel like it's out of place in Runescape. 
---
Of course, that's just my opinion, Camelot doesn't have a (relatively) major impact on the rest of the content, so I'm glad someone else enjoys it lol.
---
thanks you! They can check my account  bank or invent..  I have 2b or more. since 2 months ago I only have 10m -50m cash stack to avoid sand casino.

this would drastically lower the skillcap on lava runes. hard pass from me.
---
should ensure that i can create my own gender because none of the mainstream genders shall suffice
---
Bush did 9/11
---
Yeah I mean that's kinda the point. Pretty much any of the currently existing skills would fail a poll if they were brand new nowadays because people would always have one complaint or another about them. People's standards for a new skill are way too high. Any complaint you could make about artisan, you could make about slayer, too, yet slayer is generally considered the most popular skill in the game.
---
He reworked the tune crafting code, but this change was not implemented or will it be without a poll. Ash just said it would be possible, read it again 
---
I'm now a big fan of this game.
---
My inspiration haha
---
By that logic, we should just never update the game again. Programming bugs happen. You can't possibly think of every scenario to test before releasing an update.
---
However, as far as the twisted bow bug, that one seems like someone fucking around and forgetting to remove something. I can't think of an explanation.
---
But his intention was there, amirite?
---
I‚Äôve been meaning to suggest a shift click dismiss for random events cuz misclicking left click after right click is sad times.
---
I‚Äôd vote yea to dungeoneering.  Was the perfect skill
---
That's amazing 
---
I take it you never heard of Muggsy Bogues 
---
It is equal opportunity you fuckin dingus. You want equal outcome, which should not be strived for.
---
As someone who has 225ish total levels with 57 in fishing and 56 in cooking, its because the quests are hard lmao.
---
this is exactly how it felt 
---
Your argument here is weak, I don't like slayer but this isn't slayer at least with boss tasks and fight caves they take some skill to complete to justify extra xp where running a course that doesn't change takes literally zero. 
---
Also Pearl Rods should have an invisible +1-2 fishing boost considering how long they take to acquire. It‚Äôs  so players won‚Äôt have to carry a D Harpoon for the +3 and be back again at 26 inventory.
---
Thanks doctor.

Adderall is frequently prescribed for sleep disorders. Pretty sure actual doctors know what they're doing.

Well for a bit of context, I had just finished reading an abridged version of Le morte d'Arthur, so that's probably why it stuck with me
---
This shit makes me scared to actually get good at this game. good thing i am a perma-noob.
---
Lol you name the smallest player in the history. Yes I know who that is. As well as Nate Robinson and other small players who can dunk. But 99% of players in the NBA are over 6ft tall 
---
Pretty prestigious. Only 1 person ever has had all pets at once. I believe we're at like 40-42 total pets or something. 
---
I really don't know a single person. Like out of hundreds, no one. 
---
Nice! Was all of this on mobile?
---
Only decent chick in that picture lawl
---
Take a break if ur lacking motivation.  No need to force urself to play.
---
This is absolute bullshit and beyond wrong.
---
My combat stats are pretty mediocre, and my highest stats are skilling ones, currently doing fishing and cooking. Honestly I'm doing other stuff. Homework, CSGO, League, Apex or whatever really. Have it up on a second monitor and do AFK stuff that makes me enough GP to play another 14 days.
---
How's that possible? That's over 350k xp/hr if you played for 24 hrs straight
---
I love zulrah, but my start was aids. Best thing to do it dump 1-2m into tele tabs and just keep going at it. Ring of suffering helps so you don't have to worry about your recoil breaking. Always keep hp above 40. Each time you go in try to learn what the next phase will be so like ranged to melee, then mage. For the most part you can assume after range it will be mage aside from the  2nd phase after the starting range phase. Slap on the prayer before worrying about switches.
---
Repetitions will turn you into a pro, honestly I looked at the rotation list like 5 times after that I just started memorizing it on my own buy dying alot. You'll get there soon! 
---
Good news everyone! The make-up mage can increase your dick size!
---
You‚Äôve probably been planing for this since you hit 123m
---
A distemper shot should do the trick.
---
Oh lawdy
---
No, there is no implied intent. If you look at original context, a player was asking Mod Ash if it would be difficult to implement the change, in which Ash replied not difficult, pointing to the reworked code for runecrafting. The only implication is that the skill was reworked similar to farming code was by Ash a few years ago because the original code for these skills is archaic and needed reworking. Since the new code base is mode modern, it would be easier to implement feature changes on a technical level, but doesn‚Äôt mean it was made with explicitly that intent in mind.

Last one swear to god.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST

You have no idea of how much I hate you

I saw a guy on here get a hardcore ironman tat. Said he was going to get it greyed when he died
---
7k zulrah kc no pet
---
1 Handed Crush Weapon on par with the Whip.
---
Elves seem to be all about agility, so how about an agility training master that gives you agility tasks throughout the world for bonus xp and maybe some rewards - tasks could be something as easy as 
---
- do 15 laps at the gnome course 
---
- use 4 different short cuts located on karamja
---
- do 12 laps of rooftop agility in seers village
---
Etc.
---
Complete these tasks for a little bonus do that doesn‚Äôt break the Xp meta  let‚Äôs but allows you to add some variety to your training and perhaps some extra rewards to spice things up a bit
---
This made me tear up
---
To be fair, half the chat could‚Äôve been him bitching to his cc about losing a pet after he died.
---
I think you can boost it and then clean guams/make attack potions. It's nothing crazy but a cool stat to have none the less
---
No second GE! Maybe a spirit tree to get to the main GE but no thank you to two of them. 
---
The loot is useful. The money is less useful but you still need it for a bunch of things. And his cash stack wasn‚Äôt huge. 
---
That language should result in a permanent ban. No questions asked. I don't get how the community is ok with it. 
---
Very nice! I just got my fishing pet at just over 16m fishing xp. It's a rly chill skill to do while afking
---
I dont think a perm ban is adequate, a mute would be fine by me
---
Very helpful :) why is it important to have hard frem done for tanning?
---
Hiding was a skill at one point in runescape classic
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I said unless you're forced to. In those cases you have no choice. Not sure why you're so hostile but you can have the last word since you seem to be so invested in this. Have a good night. 
---
thanks for the info. i'll probably just stick to regular ironman. a lot more respect for UIMs now.
---
Why is this comment here any time anyone even tangentially mentions being pked?
---
Yea, we know it's the wilderness. No, it's not the point. Quit trying to karma farm. 
---
Just max bro

#prayforneive
---
Im a pker, please repost in one sentence or less, thanks.

Well I don't really like the suggestion as a whole either, but I'm just speaking out how I'm against adding more activities that reward bonus xp
---

Same. D battle axe was my favorite weapon in the game. By the time the child hood fun ended and GE got added and efficiency took over (not close to ehp, but I actually did stuff) I got around 82 str, and with special I remember my biggest hit was 27 and just addicted to seeing that number.
---
I went through at least a week of swapping in some inefficient Slayer on my iron with a dbattle just to kinda re live that. 
---
And
---
It's a new bug.
---
From my understanding a sort of double loop has been introduced. 
---
First it counts item stacks by a single item GE value.
---
1. Godsword (2)
---
2. Blowpipe
---
3. Coin
---
Then a second loop happens where it unstacks the item a pushes any overlapping item out.
---
1. Godsword
---
2. Godsword (blowpipe is bumped and unprotectable)
---
My guess is it has to do with the recent patch. Previously noted revenant artifacts where protected on death (they aren't suppose to be). The recent patch stopped that, but I think they might have messed with how the death mechanic deals with multiple stacked items.
---
Not named nic :(
---
You‚Äôre a good dude 
---
abyssal dagger is pretty good if you have the money for it.
---
No you didn‚Äôt...this was posted here months ago lol
---
Says the guy who just took literal methamphetamines and dexedrine
---
Why three thousand bronze arrows instead of the best you can make at the time?
---
Because without any xp (or gp) incentive, it's a complete waste of my time to go and run the draynor course if I'm above 20 agility. It would be like being opposed to brimstone keys on Konar tasks and saying you should just use an objectively worse master for fun. 
---
It's fine if you don't like the idea as a whole, but being against it because of specifically the concept of bonus xp being an incentivize for running lower level content is kinda silly. There needs to be *some* incentive or else it's just completely dead content, like Konar would be without brimstone keys.
---
No you didn't, you reposted this??
---
I completely agree. Part of the problem is it exists in a completely ordinary location and it just a place you teleport to or run past. It might have made a little more sense when its location was the overworld's western most point.
---
I feel like Prifddinas is in a similar place now as well. It's supposed to be isolated to the point of mythicality but it would also be visible from the sea by any ship going to/from Kourend

Bursting. If you want it fast and easy. 
---
Other methods are slow, and monotonous. But I get it. Not everyone wants to spend money to boost a skill faster. Thus why my herblore has been stagnant at 66 for awhile.

I am also dumb, and also on the Osrs sub Reddit.

You require the diaries to unlock "tan leather" a lunar magicks spell. Tanning the dragonhides the regular way grants no exp \^\^
---
Do some barb fishing. Afk so you won‚Äôt get burned out, gains some agility and str levels. You can even 3t without very much effort and great xp. Sprinkle in some quests and quest/diary reqs and do clues from fishing. Ones that are reasonable to get the stats for. Those things will all build up your account and shouldn‚Äôt be too repetitive.

Have you tried Runelite? (Hide NPCs 2D)

**Crystal Glass** \- A new craft-able glass to fill the gap between 49 for bullsey lens &amp; 87 for dorgeshuun light orb.
---
Could be used to craft something like new glass tools (needle, chisel that decreases chance of crushing silver jewelry gems, etc.), parts for other items &amp; maybe even some slight gear improvements.
---
All just ideas but I think the concept in general would be neat.

Actually this is wrong. Zulrah the items get deleted yes, but not in Vorkath. Also, I was talking about the despawn timer for ground items. They stay there for an hour and you can kill yourself, then go into the wildy and come back within an hour to pick up your items.
---
Or you could work 3.5-4hours and have a year of membership paid for and keep your 96m for better items ? ü§î

There should be the Chaotic longsword equivalent of the Ghrazi Rapier. I have suggested the Crystal Longsword!

When I got desperate I told the Venezuelans that didn't have 80+ Hunter in puro puro to pm if they saw a d imp and I would give them 500k from my main if I got it. Anyone who understood me agreed.

Sorry bud, but faux positivity and screenshots of your achievements don't prove that you didn't rwt. Honestly, the way you worded everything just makes it look like you are trying to deflect. Also sounds like you are trying to butter people up with stuff like, "god bless and gl with purples&amp;pets" which has no relevance to the actual situation at hand. 
---
RemindME! 24 hours "J-mod smackdown"
---
Quite impressive
---
50 hours a year? If you are unable to play 1 hour per week then maybe runescape is not meant for them and they should look for games that provide either faster progression or do not involve training at all. 1 hour per week will not get you anywhere in RS and definitely should not be the starting point to argue xp rates to reach end-game content.

I mean aside from maybe a few clues and a hops farming spot, is it really used for anything else? I'm not against it, it just doesn't seem necessary at all. Rather than this just make the teleport cards stackable and let us buy more than 100 per day.
---
Ooof

Next it will be Slayer task in a certain location with certain protection gear, then you have to ko the monster with a specific spec weapon, but do less than 10% total damage.

Is that like the Catholics Jesus? Or like some deep South Jesus? Catholic Jesus is a lot more hardcore.

Right. Because making RCs shitty archaic design slightly less shit is the thing that will turn this game into RS3. And not the multitude of actual changes to various other skills since then.
---
yup
---
Happens every time ffs 
---
WE test the game for them.
---
Maybe just make it so you still have to click on the altar a couple times, like once to craft what's in your inventory and another to craft what's in your pouches

Yeah, but its almost always people moving large amounts of wealth from their main to an alt or vice versa. IMO theres a pretty solid cha,ce this guy actually did rwt and now hes upset that hes being punished for breaking rules.

Clearly thats not the case, and you are trying so hard to fit bullshit to your false narrative.

I have good news. It already is.

YOU. ARE. NOT. ENTITLED. TO. HIGH. STATS.

Stop trying to change the game to fit your bitch ass needs and go find a different game to play.
---
I don‚Äôt care much but I wouldn‚Äôt have added it. I do like wyrms drakes and hydra (only complaint is the high prayer exp on bones). But I default to thinking less is more unless added content fills a gap, examples being anglerfish/amethyst mining for end game low xp high afk, also unique things like birdhouse runs for hunter. Konar doesn‚Äôt seem necessary to me and doesn‚Äôt fill any gaps imo. Adding a bunch of average things that do no harm no benefit are bad in the long run
---
Runelite - Stretched fixed mode and change the ratio to around 60%
---
What better way to train agility than by playing the age old game of tag?

Plus I see it as kind of PvP without the combat. All you would need to do is touch your opponent once and evade obstacles rather than meticulously prayer flick and protect items and switching gear and all of the other nuances many of us don't feel like learning.

The best way to see if something is OP or not is using bitterkoekje's dps calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wzy1VxNWEAAc0FQyDAdpiFggAfn5U6RGPp2CisAHZW8/edit#gid=158500257

Click on 'File' &gt; 'Make Copy' and edit any values you want vs any mob you want. For a 3 tick weapon you can use the Event RPG and add Custom Values at the bottom of the gear tables.

Buying a bond off the GE makes it untradable. It costs 10% of current bond value to make it tradable.

Other than that there really aren't any catches. It's just 14 days of membership. It's somewhat difficult for new players to make the money but pretty easy once you get late game.
---
Having a job and just spending money on mems is usually more efficient so they're really not that OP
---
No I get that. I just haven't seen a really good suggestion on how to implement it without completely changing the meta, or the update not really changing much.
---
I think the solution is more dependant on monster's defence then it is the weapons them selves.
---
We'd still have to change the weapons around a bit, but in conjunction with monster weakness. It'd be much easier to keep the meta how it is, and reassign niche categories.

Why‚Äôs it like a huge emblem with a bit of string around it. Just because it needs a unique design doesn‚Äôt mean we really care what the design is or how much we wanna see it.. just want new items looking different to each other..

551250 gp is quite a specific price.

3t mele weapons are tough to balence. This thing is real good, in max with pots and prayer it thing competes with a tent whip. With solid gear it beats a hasta or abby dagger easily.

Everything about this sounds pretentious as fuck. Do people actually have phone interviews for online game chats or is this guy some next breed of special?

---
Ash must be so annoyed having to deal with these people
---
Is the damage inflicted by melee random between 1 and your max hit?  Or is it based on your stats?  I know there is a formula for max hit, but it feels like more often than not I'm hitting 1's or 2's, even though I calculated and saw for myself that my max hit is around 9 for my current strength and strength bonus.
---
In reality its a great country to live in and it gets better every year
---
looks surprisingly balanced for the fact i just picked a random Str bonus. I'd almost like it to be like, 10-20% worse DPS &amp; just fill a niche in being effective in killing lots of low level mobs (example: spider room of tob, BA).
---
The GRE is almost an IQ test more than a knowledge test. The questions can get a lot harder to deal with. Think SAT in terms of difficulty ranges. Your score is percentile based, and they need lower difficulty questions for the lowest percentiles of takers.

Also yeah, its not uncommon for grad schools to expect a near perfect score for anyone going into engineering. Even a perfect score doesn't mean all that much.

Do you realize that you still sound like a twat even with the "justification" that you don't care about imaginary internet points?

I think theyll make sure to only be able to hit 0s , with lets say flowers or something. And the way Slayer works is, theres mutliple ways of getting xp. Either u do over half the monsters health of damage, or u do the finishing blow to kill the monster. But theres a third way, that doesn't require u to deal damage. When hitting the monster, doesn't matter if its a 0, the same tick someone else hits the monster, and the monster dies, in this case by the damage from the other acc, both accs will get slayer XP. So u just partner up with ur main via coop slayer, skip all non mutli tasks, make sure both accs have a 4tick weapon and just att the same npc at the same time. This way both accs will also finsh their task at the same time

You're the one being pedantic fucking moron. Maybe if you weren't so trash at the game that you consider a quest cape an achievement you'd realize he was obviously talking about skill capes, not a useless cape that happens to have the same stats and model. Why do you think your shitty 99 cooking didn't trim your quest cape? You're literally fucking retarded. Go finish off your 99 fm or whatever fucking retarded goals idiots like you set yourself in this game. You're blocked, hope you use the time you would've used to reply to me to jump off a fucking cliff. Bye.

I'll probably get down voted for this but this game is going down a really bad path in terms of all the EZscape "qol" updates being added/suggested. Sigh.

Dont fail school it will fuck you over later in life.

Would you rather have it easier or make you wanna kill yourself?

This just Shows how bad of a Reputation gaming has. Gaming is just another "Hobby" you most likely do on a daily Basis and for fun. So why would spending 120‚Ç¨/year on it be so bad? If you do any other Hobby like Football or anything else you can think of, the 120‚Ç¨ dont even come near to the amount you have to spend on these.
---
You have an addiction problem. thats different

They dont QA the entire game when they release an update you know? Thats just not feasible, but i also do think they need to step up their game.

Main catch for me would be throwing away $3mil ingame for 2 weeks, when i could just spend $11 irl for a month. If you make minimum wage, a bond is roughly an hour of your time. As opposed to 16+ hours at blast furnace or cannonballs or whatever you do to make money in game.
---
Unless you WANT to spend your first 2 weeks as a member grinding boring moneymaking skills to be able to afford the next bond.
---
As others have said, once you go members, f2p is worse than not playing at all. Chances are, once your two weeks is up, youll end up buying membership, so i reccomend saving your 3 mil and using it to explore some of the members content, as membership isnt going to be as fun if youre jumping in with 0 gp.
---
HAHAHAHA no
---
This is actually a good idea
---
If everyone stopped paying for membership and only paid with bonds they would go up and eventually run out. Bonds are only purchased from real money. Jagex doesn‚Äôt just give bonds out, the ge doesn‚Äôt generate them. 
---
People value their time differently. A maxed player in a good pvm clan can easily earn a years worth of bond money in a day or 2. To someone else who works a full time job they may just prefer to spend their time enjoying the game and progressing their account without having to worry about maintaining bonds. 
---
I had lower stats than you when I did the KQ kill for diary. like the other commenter said, suiciding with supplies works well. 
---
if you start running out of supplies mid-fight, tele out after damaging KQ, grab more supplies, and run back ASAP. KQ will have healed up a little (although not completely if you‚Äôre fast), making it a little easier to finish her off.
---
You got issues

I finally got my girlfriend to play OSRS, and she spends half her days just woodcutting Oaks and banking them. She's like level 45-50 woodcutting now, so not that high, but she keeps cutting Oaks all the time, instead of moving on to better trees.

It's relaxing to her.

Oh ok that makes sense. I'm an electrical engineering senior and I was wondering why such a trivial problem would be on here and how answering it correctly could tell you anything about the applicant.
---
Creating too many task based systems would make them dull. People wish other aspects of the game were as engaging as slayer tasks, but the more we use this system the less exciting  it becomes. Imagine if this was in game along with farming contracts and the artisan skill. It would be Task-Scape. I think we should be asking for fresh fun gameplay systems from the OS team instead of just re-suggesting the one system that people like at the moment.

Im not saying that you are gay for using macbook, but for recording with a phone.....

* A crystalized pouch shard; this could be added to the pure essence pouches to automatically make runes from the pure essence in the pouches (So you will not have to grab the essence out of the pouch, it will automatically do it for you). This shard would last about 10-15 uses before it runs out of charges and would only be acquireable with skilling in the city.
---
exclusivity breeds desire, making things not special anymore absolutely ruins games. this is why wow died, but osrs still has prestigious achievements like 99 skills for example
---
It feels like a different game; people who don't play the mode can't imagine why anyone would do it, but the overwhelming majority of people that actually try it, really enjoy it. Inventory management is a big feature in many games, so much so that people sometimes refer to games like RE4 as "attache case simulator".

Exactly this. 
---
I don't personally want this change but it's laughable to consider this as some kind of overboard "easyscape" change when we already have much more significant things like shift clicking and left click withdraw x. 
---
Besides I don't think it's possible to "devalue" RC more than Zeah RC has. 
---
How about you click the altar, it instantly uses up your inventory, then it uses up your pouch 1 by 1 every 2 ticks, so if you want it quicker you can still just empty them manually.

Fishing barehanded is just as fast as fishing normally with a harpoon, but it provides small amounts of bonus Strength experience (see the table below); however, it takes a significantly higher level to fish this way.
---
Droprate from eclectic jars is 1/25, so the expected value would be just south of 50k assuming they were pretty good about not opening extra jars. With a jar extra opened per clue, you're looking at 52kish (since a lot of players open in batches, esp when doing in bulk).

I play the game to do no thinking what so ever. Fletching was my first level 90, and I have no problem with mining/smithing/agility/RC.

Honestly, I'd love to see a Max Guild be introduced as a reward, like RS3.
---
Lol just contact support /s
---
&gt;something of qol for the people that have let off rcing for too long because most don't ahk abuse.
---
You don't need "ahk abuse" anymore though. You can shift click to empty pouches (so anyone can easily 1 tick) and left click withdraw all makes banking fast even for slower players. There's quite literally no point in mousekeys/AHK anymore especially for RC. 
---
You're improving.
---
I like the idea of black marks but not the bonus xp.

It's not QoL

But it's a shit skill because it's so fucking slow and something this minor wouldn't hurt in the long run.

wtf you got against fairies?

Your only one who sounds rude 
---
Dragon Harpoon would be the best thing to use whenever doing harpoon fishing because it will always net more fish/hr. 20% more to be exact due to it being. . . 20% faster. Unless you are for some reason a fishing only Ironman and trying to get str levels or some other gimmick like that.

Good shit

yeah sorry i play rs to have something casual i can play and not worry about sucking at while i take a break from cs and dota 
---
i hate those people

Why is this ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù? Why do you guys love using that word

Long term goals are important :)

Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood.
---
New wall looks nicer (if still a little short) and I prefer the new high poly trees.
---
Thanks for reminding me to jump back on MW2 once in a while, it's a lot of fun. 
---
The stickiest of the icky.
---
That was fire. 
---
Until everyone is 78 
---
Meet Bi9531, my shark only acount. After recently starting playing Runescape I decided to up the ante. To forge my own journey from scratch. With banking, no trading. But this time, I can't do anything else than fish sharks. All leading up to claiming one of Runescape's greatest capes: the fishing cape.

&gt;devaluation of a skill that 99% of the community hates 
---
&gt;complaining about making the game more fun
---
holy fuck
---
yeah but it wouldnt beat the current top xp rates, so its fine
---
you should watch how literal 20 man maxed main clans swarm around people bringing void/graceful past lvl 20 wild - they are all that way
---
Difficulty is subjective. I got called an autistic retard after I failed for the 10th time.
---
What did it cost you?
---
If you haven't done all the quests before, I recommend not using the guide. It's more satisfying and none of them are too hard if you read your quest log in game, it generally prompts you what to do or try next. At least for f2p quests; after that they can be significantly longer.
---
Ah yes, the cardboard dragons
---
Big appreciate it Mr. Mod Ash Sir

GAMERS RIIIIIIIISSSSEE UUUUUUP

What's you defense level, and are you using defense potions?
---
and your choice of aim or msn
---
He didn't.  It was in level 40 wilderness, so as a level 73, he could attack the level 85 (+12 levels) while not being able to be attacked by the 120 (+47 levels, aka more than 40).  
---
As to why he could take down a level 85, it's because as you said, he's probably min-maxed his account.  In other words, he's a level 73 pure (based on the fact that he has barrage) built specifically to kill people, and the target was essentially helpless because, being a UIM, wasn't carrying a large amount of food on him.  Probably died in like 30 seconds.  
---
Pretty bad plan by the UIM guy.  A 120 is not good protection for a juicy looking 85.  He was dead to any pure in the 70s, and there are a lot of those.
---
Yes, but Jagex doesn't really explain those situations. You'd see an edit by OP saying account unbanned without a JMod reply or only a reply that says check your account center. 
---
his parents are confiscating his shit but his mom let him use her old laptop
---
you didnt work very hard on that one did you
---
If I was playing League while scaping I'd also just fish sharks xD
---
I mean you have like 3 seconds to switch your prayers, just pay attention
---
swamp tar heroin
---
Sure, but you get no experience.

Meh, already got the cape. 
---
and it'll make those people who aren't PKers vote down every pro-PK poll.
---
Idk if you thought this one through.
---
Gz on the blowjob been hunting that for ages all I ever got was thordurs black hole
---
Honestly, while I don't enjoy snowflake ironman content (besides verf, but that's due to generally liking his videos), stuff like "HCIM ROAD TO 60 ATTACK (YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE DRYSTREAK) (NEARLY DIED)" just has no place in the community.
---
Well lets at least agree it is good that he did the right thing. Many others wouldn't have.
---
Common doesn't mean peasant, peasant. Cooking is a peasant cape because it's mostly just for the sake of having it. A true chad wears combat max capes to flex his power level 
---
No other way to get the Kraken pet.  
---
If you don't care about pets... The block 'em.
---
It takes 1 hour of Vork to buy around 1300 Dragon bones. How long it take to get this much on an ironman?
---
A Veracs brassy takes less then ten minutes to buy, yet in 300 hours of barrows i haven't gotten one. (Got all the defensively that)
---
Can you explain to me how playing an account regularly vs iron man mode is not nearly as slow?
---
Let people enjoy the high quality gif. Just because you‚Äôve seen it before doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else has. 
---
Support. They will fuck it up and allow me to finish some of those ridiculous diaries without getting the proper levels.
---
Why don't you guys play rs3 if you like ezscape so much?

I always used a scim because it was faster, to hell if the monster I was killing was weak to crush lol

Love thinking about the good old times.
---
When you didn't play to get maximum xp/hr.
---
When you didn't care what armor you were wearing.
---
When you couldn't get specced for your full hp.
---
When (most) of the community was nice instead of toxic.
---
When you did the same thing for 5 hours just to make 100k and thought it was alot.
---
I remember when mobile came out.. hadn‚Äôt played since 8th grade. All i did was get on and fished until I could fish lobs. Shit brought me back, it was nice. 
---
This is mega. I feel his pain too. The grind is real. 
---
Lmao they made brainlets from osrs into a real thing
---
Lmfaoo what?? Like when do you say it‚Äôs enough! 
---
Make a new account and never go to the duel arena agakn
---
Crystal shields and bows both should be banned from pvp. Literally the best rag equips. 
---
Just Sc Tbh, we won't get both and Sc was superior. 
---
I'm someone else. Honestly if you start using needing money to get to the better money makers as an argument you're gonna lose this. If you wanna do stuff that makes you like 100k/hr be my guest, but there is lots of 0 req stuff that makes more and will get you to the better money makers quickly. Tho ofc the level of afk is always a factor but that's why I said you can't bring a financial argument. If you are speaking purely on efficiency, it is objectively wrong to do something like gold bracelets until you have enough money to do better things. However, if you are speaking on a balance of what you can do for money and maintain your sanity, that's personal. If afk methods are as intensive as you can get while maintaining your sanity so be it (tho I don't really suggest aiming for methods like vorkath then).
---
&gt; most players cannot 1t empty

ever since we removed the need of ahk/mousekeys via shift-click, literally anyone can learn to do it now

it's piss easy and not something i'd really care about "devaluing"

Obvs not dumbo, hes in morytania
---
thanks bro i put a lot of effort into making this gif
---
Hum, wasn't aware of this. Just re-read the section of the blog; 50ish depending on activity. I honestly don't think the shards will be extremely expensive (my train of thought on this is that they won't have an extremely huge demand, and that the boss probably isn't intended to contend with zulrah/vork), but if they are, I support this. 
---
I'll try it out next time! Exp seems my best use of that task right now.
---
Both were amazing in their own ways honestly.
---
I agree that Sc would appeal to the majority though, because it included parts from all aspects of the game + other unique ones.
---
(I loved that pickpocketing mechanic lol)
---
This is pretty well done! Finally got her cape this last week too, so this is really good timing. Hope you post more like this, as Id love to see it.
---
Logistically, this works.
---
Can you please give us the reasoning for nixing the sand gathering method(s)? It clearly has popular support, but has been pushed back despite passing polls. Would appreciate clarification!

&gt;*Q:* Can lucky Implings be updated to only a roll on the unique drop table of all 4 tiers of clues instead of giving anything a clue scroll can give?	
---
&gt;*A:* Yeah, I think they need an improvement for how rare they are. Stripping the non-unique stuff off the list seems to be a fairly popular approach. We could manage that and it seems to have popular player support.
---
When might we see this implemented / polled?
---
Non-stat degradation as a reward for MEP2 sounds awesome.
---
Dharoc,torag and guthan all have the same defence stats. I would go with torag, because it's alot cheaper
---
No. D Scim attacks at a 2.4 sec interval and the Mace is 3 sec. 
---
Whats the max hit with the Obby Sword? Toktz-xil-ak? As it attacks with 2.4 sec interval. 
---
Bh2 update when? Pvp dev team when? WE ARE STARVING FOR CONTENT. 
---
Not crashing if you leave tho
---
I've started a few times from scratch and it's really not that hard to get going.  That being said, having 2 members accounts is a requirement as you will want a mule. 
---
It could 'revive' skilling by giving the good old pickaxe, harpoon, axe give them one new effect and more stuff to help out skilling imo
---
Your karma whoring life is a joke 
---
Can you revamp the underwater thieving/agility reward shop? It's currently super underwhelming with nothing worth purchasing. Could potentially offer buckets of sand (packs) in exchange for mermaid tears.
---
Fits in doubly well with the giant seaweed patch nearby and adds another solution to the current sand debate, it's a method which takes reasonable effort and the rate can be readily controlled.

It would pass
---
&gt; Its called a compromise.
---
It's not a compromise to just capitulate to people who barely even play seeking to devalue all of our xp so they can get all the levels they feel entitled to without putting any work into getting them.
---
99% of the Games available are really casual. You want literally every Game to fit your personal schedule. What game are the people like me who do have the time to spend meant to play exactly? If you don't have the time to achieve what you want to achieve in RS then fuck off and play one of the thousands of other Games made for you.
---
Just because you (or anyone else) don't personally have "50 hours a year" to spend on the game isn't reason to make it easier for you.
---
Runespan was why I quit RS3 for over 5 years, specifically only came back to OSRS this year because it didn't hand everything to you without you putting some effort in.
---
"We demand a 5% increase in molch pearls" settle down lad.

I don‚Äôt mind not doing AFK stuff, just generally I‚Äôm not sure of what actually makes decent money in this game before you max out your combat level. We all know high level PVM will make you millions but other than that, it seems there‚Äôs not a huge deal of information available. 
---
I checked the money making guide on the Wiki and they just suggest what monsters you can kill but don‚Äôt suggest herb runs or anything else, most of what they suggest is out of my range. I checked YouTube but unfortunately, once people post videos of new easy ways to make money, those methods become too saturated with other players trying to do it for it to become viable to new players. Perfect example was when I saw a video showing how much you can make just looting off the ground from PVP worlds/wildy, it looked so easy but when I tried it myself it seems there are at least 20 other people trying to do the same thing who are clearly far more experienced doing it than me.
---
Crafting gold bracelets is a legit, low-level way to double money and you can make as much as you want just as long as you make sufficient investment and are able to actually sit through hundreds upon hundreds of inventories doing the same thing over and over again for days. I would gladly explore other options if more information was available on what low-mid levels like me can do to earn decent cash quickly but I feel like there‚Äôs often such a dominant focus on high-level content since it‚Äôs only at this stage that you can really be considered to be ‚Äúplaying the game.‚Äù
---
28 I believe.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. If we had gotten a "preview" so to speak of wintertodt, blast furnace and NMZ they would have failed the polls, garuanteed. You also don't seem to get that the less you have to focus on what's happening on the screen the easier a skill becomes, which not "fair" by any means. You just want this update because you're lazy.
---
Like customer support
---
Cringe
---
And they still thought that the farming guild doors and sara brew konar drops were good ideas.
---
They like polishing the visuals but the ideas and implementations are still often poor om first release

Not entirely. It was legal once but these computers are not in use so license was removed but by the EU rules when you purchase software you should be able to move it to other device. My version for 3$ is still there after more than a year of having it.

While that may be true, he takes INFOWARS Lion's Heart‚Ñ¢ supplement ($140.00 50% OFF) which makes his heart completely immune to heart attacks. The research I've conducted on this life changing product allows me to confidently say I've never had a heart attack after I started taking Lion's Heart. And for all the men that want to ask me, yes, it keeps you rock hard no matter how much your wife resembles a goblin. Trust me when I tell you this.

I think they'd need to revive some old minigames, BA is total cancer, but that's just how the minigame is set out, torso hunter leaves wave 8 and ur fucked. There needs to be a way to improve that

TB has always been dead, that game needs to be redone entirely.
---
People want the better minigames, fist of guthix, stealing creation and soul wars, obv with adjusted rewards to fit osrs but ya

For the last month and a half I haven't been feeling the grind as much, so I've been doing something similar. I started selling raw sharks by the thousand, but now I'm stockpiling until I have enough for 99 cooking.

Come on. Go to a politics sub if you want to bitch about politicians.

When i saw 100 upvotes and 400 comments i knew it was going to be carnage lol 
---
Then why should combination runes have no delay? Crafting them is still an action, and should take time according to you. It should be standardized, and honestly zero-tick rc crafting feels the most fluid. 
---
It is subject to the OSRS problem just like all mini-games. First, it will be substantially used for only a week or two. There will be some players that will play many games of it but the majority will play it for a few hours, get a proto tool or two and be on their way, which leads me onto my next point. Second, depending on how mini-game is implemented the rewards will either be essential or useless for most players, neither of which being ideal for a mini-game. In rs2 many people went into skilling stealing creation worlds where people tried to end as fast as possible. For many, this would be the only way people could afford to get 99‚Äôs like crafting, smithing, and construction. This is unlikely to pass a poll in OSRS however and I don‚Äôt blame players for not wanting to implement a mini game that is, essentially, almost on par with xp-efficient methods for half the price of what it would cost. If they get rid of the game ending early then it will forever be niche content for many players. Third, the mini game was historically buggy upon release. We can, in hindsight, see how some of the bugs were caused and fixed, but the OSRS code is, now, very different than stealing creation in rs2 and will likely require a significant amount of time to create without the certainty that some of the bugs that intitially existed will be gone.

No.

What are u competing against/for? Whoever can get cleaned the most/fastest? Lol

---
stahp. my dick can only get so hard
---
It's a math.
---
As someone who has 90 rc, with almost all of it being from lavas, this is a fine suggestion.
---
It's not going to devalue anything, it's not going to speed up xp rates by a significant margin, and more people won't suddenly like runecrafting because of it. The core of the skill does not change. 
---
Bank presets would, however. I am against those. Pouches should definitely always be filled manually as well. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äòmental addiction‚Äô (conditioning) and actual physiological addiction (withdrawals, eg. tobacco/alcohol).

I dont enjoy the rc skill but if comparing between them one is more enjoyable. To me it depends on if i want afk or do more click intensive tasks which changes daily/hourly.
---
True. But it costs a bit and most noobs dont have that kind of money so if they level it up through sharks i gotta respect them.
---
Not sure if you know what you're on about if you think empyting and rcing in 1t is easy but fast banking is hard when they essentially require the same skill.

For all the wrong reasons. Identity politics is poison.

I dont think thats how it works lol

People can become addicted to anything, may not be physical but it can definitely be mental
---
Just remember this bad boy game used to run on very old systems. Anything is good for OSRS. The one thing to keep in mind is if using a 3rd-party client, they use a lot more processing power. Would be good if you can let us know a budget and I'm sure some setups can be configured for you.
---
I'm just generally opposed to changing things that have been a certain way since osrs launch. That is what really makes lavas so good, being able to 0tick them.
---
I match with girls on tinder, add them on snap and talk. And then lose interest by the next day cause would rather scape and I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore. I‚Äôm weak :(

With last week's server rollback after the tbow bug, we learned that account progresses are saved at different timestamps. This caused some issues with item duplications/deletions which you manually had to fix afterwards, and was why you were hesitant to do a rollback in the first place.

Why aren't accounts saved simultaneously? What's the reason for not doing it this way in the first place? What advantages does it offer to have one account saved at 12.05 and another one at 12.15?

Could the elder maul possibly get a small buff? Currently it has very little if even any use in the game due to other weapons replacing it like the abyssal bludgeon at tekton after the defence reduction and the viggoras chainmace for revenants.

Spiritual Creature slayer assignments are unlocked after completing Death Plateau which doesn't make sense since you can't get into the GWD after Death Plateau.

And then you woke up. 
---
Audiobooks/TV Shows/Movies is how I play all games, not just RS. I've never found a game that I can actually stare exclusively at for 15+ hours at a time, lol.
---
Higher exp methods/easier training is exactly how we define ezscape. Increased xp doesn't make anything inherently more enjoyable, just take less them. Even doubling all xp rates in the game wouldn't stop people from wanting to multitask while playing RS.
---
I'd definitely recommend starting out with HCIM, just to see how long it lasts. If there's ever a time when you don't need that pressure anymore it's easy to become a regular BTW and do normal BTW things.

Give it a shot =D

I think I'd rather see that Mega Pouch that merges all the other pouches than this. This would be a massive speed increase to RC since you not only skip having to empty the pouches, but it avoids the delay after crafting. So it would go from craft, delay, empty, Craft, delay, empty, craft, delay, and tele to craft x3 and tele. The impact this would have on exp would vary altar to altar, but I don't think that kind of buff across the board is something RC really needs and it may not be great for Rune Prices either.

Ah yes, back when powerskilling was really simple for gathering skills because all the extra items just dropped to the ground... But crafting skills (Smithing, fletching, etc.) took ages because you had to go through so many different options to make one item.
---
And "Home Teleport" was finding a random player and challenging them to a duel, taking your armor off, and letting them kill you... And the "duel arena" was right outside Lumbridge.
---
When PKing was determined by who got lucky enough to 3 hit the other... And Magic was a no-go on pures since it raised your combat level.

Back when skilling was really about the only way to make money... So the fishing guild was always crowded.

---
before christmas during a q&amp;a, mod sween said that you would address the hiding poll results issue at the beginning of 2019. when will this happen
---
Plat here, but I can only tolerate playing the game if I'm drinking.
---
Come back season 3/4, we miss you bbgirl
---
I think it's rather sexist that you're HAVING to hire women over men just because they're women! 
---
What do you think squidward is doing on the bottom left?
---
League is what I afk on my second monitor, osrs is too important. 
---
I wanted a pet so bad so i went for one of the fastest Chaos elemental 1/300 drop rate not so bad. 800kc atm and....no pet FML
---
No shit right? Most quests I sit there and wonder how shit it must have been for the first batch of players doing them to work this dumb ass shit out haha 
---
Is that a coin pouch ? Indicating he stole money to fund his addiction ? 
---
Damn how do you plan to give urself the succ?
---
As much as I appreciate NMZ as a training method, I would love to see imbuing come from elsewhere
---
Sure, but I vote for Firemaking instead... Maybe Slayer...
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had any reason to go to Slepe since the release just to check it out, so I completely agree some changes would be nice. Quest name is great!

Hmm, I think I know A friend that could use this!
---
So be it. Once I get a good income going on my main I'll start one as I can barely sustain bonds on one account. I won't make an UIM though no matter what the cost is.
---
Haha sex joke xD
---
But... he's died in the swampletics series before ._.
---
Looks retarded
---
Just weird that you're calling yourself a DMT addict to justify talking about it. 
---
If you turn on shift dropping you can empty your pouches with shift left click.
---
Why though? It takes 3 hours of afk content to grow a cat.
---
I don't do much on mobile, but I found that it helps a lot on things that are kind of hard to tap (birdhouses, using compost on herb patches and not the bush next to them)
---
He did a great job on your gift.
---
This made me laugh more than it should've haha üòÅüòÅ
---
Get the fury before upgrading your D legs. Instead of barrows, there's also obby legs that give a strength bonus, else get any of the barrows legs that others have suggested.
---
Wish I was this talented 
---
I'm a pker, and I agree yes I am kinda retarded but the good kind the one that makes friends.
---
There was this one time I was selling pot to this Amish dude. You know those guys who got like the beard with, like, no mustache or some bullshit? Well, he says that he only wants to make furniture.
---
What is good about it? Heard it‚Äôs decent but what kind of rates are there?
---
I'd be happy with an update which also makes it so withdrawing essence automatically fills pouches first.
---
I‚Äôm going to go put on a limb and say the answer to that is probably no
---
yeah but you also would have to spend time banking and going back right?
---
Make it a perk of the runecrafting cape 
---
Every account I've ever had has terrible B ring luck.
---
Nope, all of those are faster than RC
---
Anything that slightly makes RC easier to train is okay with me. 
---
If this gets added everybody would probably resort to cheap gear so nobody risks anything

I play on the go, it takes a long time for me to get it to grow. That‚Äôs even if I remember to take it out the bank. Since my kitten died it‚Äôs becoming a chore to grow another.

Yeah, but hear me out... what if we don't recreate the abomination that is RS3?

Can the toggle button for tap-to-drop on mobile be made instant and not tied to ticks? It feels really clunky to use and is significantly worse than shift click to drop on desktop because of this.
---
forgot about him ty
---
(Travis Scott adlib voice) 
---
I don't get what you mean, there's no spaces between you, the bank and the fire at rim.
---
1-(299/300)\^800 = 93%. So you had a 93% chance of getting it and a 7% chance of not getting it.
---
Wrong, I'm not even 1675 total yet but have 4 level 99 skills. It just makes me laugh when seeing a 100cmb+ or high total level without a single 99. Like 2 are so easy to get.
---
How about Fist of Guthix, that was amazing
---
Gz
---
Would require engine work
---
1) What is the possibility regarding the ability to wear capes in Barbarian Assault? At the moment, the cape slot is taken by the role icon i.e. if you are an attacker, healer, defender or collector.
---
2) On a semi-related note, could a Penance Cape be added to the rewards shop? My idea is that the cape would be egg shaped and have differently coloured variants e.g. red/green/blue corresponding to the different egg colours.
---
PS: It's become such a meme with Mod Gambit's failure to pronounce the usernames of those asking the questions. To help you out, my username is pronounce EST-TEAM-STURS ;)
---
Thanks!

I'm three quests way from my quest cape thanks to this guy.
---
Idk
---
Yes if you're doing amethyst 
---
Me? I love agility! I train it non stop although I went on a short 2 day break now because Jagex told me I played to much.
---
imagine how fast alex jones could solve crack the clue 2 for us
---
Can we get a new item called the "Ashcuum" that automatically picks up Ash? As well to go alongside this, could we make Ash stackable since the only real purpose of collecting it is to make Serum 207.
---
Ideally this would be a quest reward, maybe an Ava follow up?
---
Isn't the point of gaming to get better and better at it? 
---
Lesser demon in great kourend castle
---
Maybe we could get xp lamps for certain kill counts? It would probably be easier to pass since players who already have diary reqs won't miss out.
---
And so the duo becomes solo
---
Red is best. Facts.
---
Fist? Of? Guthix?
---
Guess it didn't work

What? Dude pkers will gawk and flock for a fucking monkfish, they will 20 man DD on you for a power ammy, TRUST me if you are skulled then you ARE the priority lmao.

Just wait for RuneLite Mobile to be released :P 
---
Can you post constructively on how adding content to a skill is comparable to changing how a skill works?
---
By your argument, zeah rc is the content that was added as a major overhaul to rc..

you missed the point

That‚Äôs the point of the leveling system within the game... and when you max all the levels what do you do? Hunt for loot and pets... they‚Äôre just weak devices to keep people playing, and we‚Äôve all fallen sucker for them....

I was able to sneakily play on mobile at work last fall. Hammering bars is fairly afk, so I'd price check and then buy several thousand adamant bars and just spend all day making dart tips or bolts. I have unlimited data (not that RS uses much at all) and a phone charger with me. Some days I could smith for 8 hours or more.

With the addition of Crystal tools, will 3rd Age tools be updated to match Crystal stats?

When this was last brought up, I think Mod Ash said they would do it when they revamp the death system (which was polled, passed, and has still yet to pass if I remember). That's why it hasn't been done yet.

This girl plunged herself into a hive of kalphites and decapitated the queen, killed all 3 of the strongest dagannoths in runescape, all 4 of the god wars generals, a cave full of obsidian monsters including tztok jad, raided the chambers of xeric and killed the great olm, killed a massive venomous snake in the middle of a toxic bog... Not to mention a giant mole, a skeletal wyvern, *several* dragons, 1300 black knights, callisto, venenatis, vet'ion, the crazy archaeologist, the chaos fanatic, scorpia, the chaos elemental, and various other creatures throughout runescape. This girl is *dangerous*

Obviously the QA's aren't going to just play the game in the testing state but considering there was a game breaking bug over the summer that caused the first ever rollback because someone didn't QA the money pouches properly, you'd think they would comb through specific updates that revolve around whatever is being changed.  Even more recently with the Tbow glitch and how it was reported that QA didn't notice it when testing Hespori indicator is BS because it would have taken someone a second to see it standing within the lowest level of the guild.  All in all though it is not only not feasible to keep putting out broken content because then people have to go back and fix it but you also have outcry from people who eventually just stop playing 
---
May I know what other details u would like to know I can fill u in if u have any queries. My flips are all from buying fire runes at 4gp and selling them at 5gp

Add a 1 in 10k crab pet as drop to Sand-, Rock-, Ammonite- and Swampcrabs with morphs between the individual crab forms.

Potentially add a 1 in 3k dropchance to King sand crabs.

True Reddit usually paints a pretty cancerous and sad picture of the game. The bad part is we affect content so much, I wish Jmods would learn to take this sub less seriously.

See you when you get back.

Also it‚Äôs so easy to hack accounts because NOBODY SECURES THEM. Bank pin, good password, 2FA on your account AND YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT, you‚Äôre account will literally never get hacked.

Considering one of those pixel friends will be living with me this summer while he interns somewhere I think it's a bit more than that. Also, I'm not saying trust someone 1000 I'm saying don't scam people on the assumption that they'd do the same.

Fk that

No, the osrs team could make their own new minigame. Which includes combat and skilling.

The relation between Third-Party Clients and Polls is an iffy one that has never really been addressed. In a way, I'd say it is one of the biggest undermining factors of OSRS; one of the core aspects of the game is players vote on everything that goes into the game yet Third-Party Clients can effectively add things to do the game without needing that 75% support and it impacts the whole community.
---
Then there is the more obvious examples like the Spellbook and Prayer rearranging that has failed polls three times yet Clients are still allowed to offer it. That kinda defeats the point of even polling it since the main reason I've seen against it is because players didn't want their opponent to use it against them, but they still can...
---
As for what should be done about it... I have no clue. I wouldn't say using Third-Party Clients are cheating per se, but they do offer unapproved features and can sometimes fall into grey areas. But I don't think banning Third-Party Clients is a good idea nor is offering all their features to the game itself. But Jagex has been doing something regarding Third-Party Clients over the past years so hopefully, that will lead to a better stance on them and what is and isn't allowed or such.

It's a game. Play it how you like!
---
I play RS3, but play in full legacy mode. Why? Becuase it's how I remeber playing the game in the RS2 era! You'd log in and there'd be an event running or new content or feature that give you something to do.
---
So what I'd do more damage in EoC? So what 'Legacy UI sucks' I play the game how I want.
---
The wild is currently dead due to an abundance of worlds. Would limiting wild access to a certain amount of worlds ever be considered to rejuvenate PvP interactions within the wild?

this makes so much sense! would pass the poll just like enchant jewelry!

Temple Trekking is a members-only minigame in which the player must escort victims of vampyre rule from Burgh de Rott through Morytania to the Paterdomus, the temple on River Salve,

I mean there are very rarely any exploits or faults in the big updates (aside from drop tables). Just seems like they have very unbalanced resource management.

Unpopular opinion: full graceful looks like shit in all colors

Love the art, but I have to point out that the guy has a huge ass

red cape best
---
Gl rebuilding
---
The spot that it's in now is currently best for Vorkath so I can see a lot of people saying no for that reason.
---
I agree I don't care if people use the third parties as long as some of the qol such as filtering makes it to the game... Because they can already do it on the clients.. And having it as well would level the playing field a bit.
---
Make a f2p range 2h pure.  Takes a couple hours, before 40 atk you literally risk 10k.  At 40 atk you risk a r2h.  This will teach you the basics of when to eat, when to switch, etc.  
---
No. That would be op.

Rip if I really have to rebuild after more than a 100 hours I‚Äôll legit just quit

There is no logic there my man lol. Sorry you feel that way about my brain :/.

you're whats wrong with this game lmfao
---
With clients you can turn on a plug-in that shows the next attack and a timer until it happens.. So let's use jad as an example... This allows you to know exactly what is coming next and pray accordingly..

In regards to pvp prayer switches there is a plug in that will auto prayer for you that will switch based on enemies atk style...

Bro, I would be so hyped for a crystal longsword, its time we get an accurate and strong 1h wep witout whip speed.
---
Of whats a popular opinion or not.
---
But you aren't spending the time it takes to get 82 RC just to save 4 seconds a lap; that would be one of many rewards and the Fremmy Diary is already pretty rewarding. Also, something being difficult to obtain does not automatically mean it should be superior. Rellekka Rooftop is already one of the best courses of its level range and it doesn't need to be better than it is, especially if that limits choices.
---
Am I monologging? 
---
(How tf do you spell that?)
---
Black mask/slayer helm imbue should just cost slayer points IMO. Buy an item to use on the mask/helm. Maybe even make it tradeable.
---
I spend a lot of time in full graceful but I would 100% support an update that gave you the energy regen perk whenever you're at &lt;0kg total weight. Maybe with a couple of new pieces of weight reducing gear.
---
Yes you should absolutely change it every now and then
---
You know what I‚Äôm more curious of? The fact that your mind is so narrow that you can‚Äôt believe people enjoy things in their own way. Should everyone do things the way you do? How much brainpower do you need to realize that? My goodness! 
---
That gladiator theme always gets me emotional
---
I've looked further into it, apparently they have detected botting software being used on my account, I am begging a j mod to review this cause I am beyond disappointed, I literally yesterday just got back into this game and I was excited to play it.
---
You'll notice from my home laptops that when I assume my account was jighjacked was extremely early in the morning, I would also add that today my account password was changed 3 times and the authenticator disabled and enabled twice, if this doesn't indicate foulplay to you I don't know what else to say. Look at the IP the game was being played on this morning there is no chance it's anywhere near me.
---
Please jmods, come to my rescue here.
---
Is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too rich to understand?
---
This meme brought to you by the white graceful set gang
---
It's 'illegal' because they're selling operating systems, that are not made by them, as they are only removing things from Windows.
---
However, it still is TECHNICALLY 'genuine windows' as you can activate it by using your official license key and the fact that its just Windows without the unnecessary bs.
---
You can also do it yourself, but obviously someone out there is doing the work for you, in exchange for money.
---
For preferring there be choices and variety than just going from the best method to the new best method?
---
Or when they know you and you don‚Äôt know them. And they keep talking about you like a stalker and turn out to be a big white whale. Maybe if she was crazy and attractive I would of digged it

Barrow Gloves 
---
Awesome, thanks. 
---
Brainlet guy right here
---
idk man. i wouldnt consider it much of a requirement. you need like 70ish for quests and 70 for sara gwd. thats like the level everyone should get anyway. youre basically just getting the entire one of the most useful sets of equipment during it without any extra effort.
---
dwh is very strong. hold onto it.

Your advice is better off at r/relationships, be free neckbeard

Cows aren‚Äôt very good training Xp you know 
---
And wrong 
---
Pretty sure he's using the Runelite plugin to put the HCIM symbol next to his name, as he's continuing to play the character as a non-official hcim.
---
It's not QoL as far as I can tell. It would almost certainly cause rune prices to crash, even if they made it so only 2 essences could stack per inventory/pouch slot. That'd double the xp rates of conventional RC, as well as increase GP/hr. I'm not sure how it'd affect ironmen, but I imagine it'd change up the game mode significantly. 
---
Maybe you'd have diminishing returns on xp after the first essence/slot, but this doesn't address the mass influx of runes, and it's not clear what a good number would be per essence. 
---
I do think RC is in a weird place, though, given the many different ways runes now enter the game. In classic, runes were dropped in small to medium quantities by monsters and sold by certain NPCs. RC was added to remedy this, it being a way to consistently make runes with a moderate investment in essence/a large time spent in the mines. It was incredibly slow, but gave some of the highest gp/hr. Essence and GP are now more abundant than ever, runes drop in large quantities from many monsters and bosses, and RC is generally seen as an intolerably tedius and boring roadblock to questing/total levels/maxing. 
---
I'm not sure anything needs to be done about RC, but if something is going to be done, I'm not sure yours is a good idea. 
---
I wish more skills were like slayer imo. Every other skill feel so boring and repetitive. 
---
Oooh wow you're right and I'm stupid
---
It isn‚Äôt making the game easier. It removes gold + takes twice as long for a kitten to grow. My suggestion leaves the normal way for growing cats to be the most efficient and free way. This is an slower, cost alternative. 
---
I call it disgraceful. 
---
Pretty sure hitting a few dwh and then a couple bgs is better than arclight. You only really need to worry about his mage hits unless you‚Äôre soloing, in which case yeah I‚Äôd use arclight. But you aren‚Äôt solo lol
---
I loved that minigame
---
That's why I'm so drawn to PVP and wish there was more content for it - Instead of dreaming and grinding for more wealth and levels, you just focus on being a better pvp'er and having fun.. there isn't really the "grass is always greener". 
---
i agree that slayer is in a good spot and could go a while without some updates. but your idea to merge existing skills is maybe the dumbest thing ive ever heard.
---
Meet Cowletics. My barn locked UIM...
---
Instead of Christmas eve, like the picture shows, its Swampletics eve
---
Exactly, this guy gets it.
---
When are you going to hide poll results?
---
Take good ideas from by far the most well liked skill? Whaaaat?
---
It's my dick in a box
---
I don't use the jad plugin, guess it might exist. Anyone with half a brain who can handle a bit of stress can do jad with 0 issue anyways. The plugin just let's the halfbrain people get a fire cape then? Kind of useless plugin to begin with yes. I don't support the Zulrah/Gorilla plugins either, but I used the gorilla one considering I did over a thousand kills without it.
---
PVP auto prayer switching is fucking botting lol, it's doing inputs for you. Why are you even bringing that up in this context..
---
Oh yes you can zoom the camera, which the regular client does as well. What difference does this make when max rendering distance is what 10? 12? squares or something.
---
The reordering of prayers makes things more convienient, the filter failed the poll because most people don't use it, and those who do have it in runelite.
---
I think that's the point
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that mean doing Dragon Slayer 2 and Theatre of Blood?? (Along with all other quests) 
---
Native. 
---
My duo partner was using The bgs while I did  dwh and arclight doesent really take to much extra time as I do them while my duo is bgsing 
---
Jaack you‚Äôre the biggest troll on here lol, it‚Äôs amazing that nobody here understands that you‚Äôre fucking around
---
he clearly does it for his own fun lmao
---
So I see your point to an extent. If you‚Äôre trying to rush 70+ agility you just do wilderness course all the way from 52-70 and you don‚Äôt get graceful and save about 20-30 hours of playtime. So technically you are locking it behind those extra 20-30 hours by doing Rooftop courses. We could say that full Pyromancer is the same way but you are getting the absolute best rates and you passively get the 5% increase as well. 
---
Brutal Black Dragons; Max GP in Arma is 1790k hr or Void is 1730k hr
---
At least he showed her his swampletics
---
I was like this before, if you quit eventually the void gets shallower and shallower until it disappears naturally, without you having to do anything.  Just takes some patience and willingness to be empty for a while.
---
6.4m in 60 kills. poor baby!!!!!
---
Three hours at Brimhaven well spent.
---
I didn't claim that ironman is as fast as a main. I claimed its not nearly 2x to 50x,as the other poster showed. Most skills are actually pretty equivalent.
---
Me and a friend restarted when mobile launched. I worked on quests and getting base stats to 50, then 60 and 70. He was deadset on getting fletching to 99. I told him he would burn himself out and they he should mix it up a bit. He finally got 99 and quit the next day.

The brimstone ring is mainly for tribridding  at places like Xerics or Theatre.

There is still room to add this item, it has better accuracy for meleers and adds some variety in general, not to mention the main purpose for this Aggression ring is saving inventory slots.

If you have venge you can pretty much just grab ags, rune and d scim and start out. You most likely won't get smited either assuming you have 70 pray. Go to w325 (pvp) ge and you will most likely find fights either a few cbs higher or lower. Once you get a few hours in you realize it's not that scary. It's just the getting into it part that is hard. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

I spent a good bit of time in F2P, grinding to 77 combat (melee). Got a couple of lucky PKs, had about 2.5m in the bank when I went P2P
---
Not true at all. While there may be people that still play it strictly for fun, they are a very small minority of people. The average age of players has easily gone up a ton since the game mostly only retains older players who don't have the time to bank stand all day, and with all of the extra information we are given and sway we have on the game with voting, it is easy to see that.
---
I weeped tears of joy. Good on ya mate

The 0 magic attack means Mages will splash on anything unless they have no magic levels. Range will miss a lot without any d'hide on, and they will be vulnerable to magical attacks if they use crystal armor.

I don't see it being used in PvP, it would probably only have PvM uses but who cares about that.

The only methods I've found to work quickly are either, not replying or talking while continuing to train or have your clan come crash until they leave.

Issue is peer pressure. A true poll doesn't reveal results until after voting. Look at any other poll system.

This is a legit mistake in your part just not the one you wanna hear. You did something dumb when because everything you‚Äôve explained says you were on a phishing site when you did your info. I know this sounds condescending but even the most basic thing in the game the stronghold of security tells you that you made poor choices when browsing. Next time don‚Äôt use weird links or emails you can‚Äôt 100% verify as real. I work in IT and you‚Äôre essentially the most common user there is. It sucks but you‚Äôre the one who fucked up no one is to blame and Jagex won‚Äôt help you here. Either rebuild or quit that‚Äôs on you 
---
Does anyone have picture of this they could link me? I googled it and bunch of different combinations came up is that what people mean? (I don't know if there's like a meme I've missed)

Lol he didn't claim credit, he just said he was too lazy to look up who did make it (still bad).

Ok well you have to watch virtuoso and tanzoo. They're 2 separate channels but they operate together. Watch their osrs challenges series starting from I think around episode 30? The first few episodes are poor no voiceover or many edits but when they changed style their videos quickly became my favourites. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just take the ectoplasmator?

They would have had to update him to return his status, if that was the case they would have both updated.

Vote for track outfits. Short little shorts, tank top, sweat bands for our wrists and head, nikes on our feets, and the cape can be a towel draped around our neck.
---
I don't know what we've lost due to spite voting now. Also I don't think that many people vote no to pvp updates. It's just a vocal minority announcing it here. I still have a lot of fun in pvp worlds so it hasn't bothered me at all anyway.

You feel entitled to get 77 when you don't even NEED to get 77 but you just want the reward without putting in the effort and you're complaining. 
---
&gt;I'm not sure what your point is anyway; whether or not there's evidence of you scamming does not change the fact that you scammed. Getting away with a crime doesn't mean you never committed it, you know?
---
But it's not a crime, and it's not scamming. It's not against the rules of the game and it never will be... The game mechanics have always been this way. If Jagex considered it scamming, they would introduce a system to guarantee split drops no?
---
Only if you high alch it.

Construction contracts would be cool, a better way to actually train construction instead of having to build and demolish the same thing over and over again (which doesn't really make much sense).

No one is forcing you to do the diaries. Players were perfectly capable of doing PvM before those diary rewards existed. Just don't do the diaries if you hate rc that much.

You've played for 47.5% of your time alive since mobile release (1427/3000hours)?

With 7 hours of sleep a night, 67% of the time you've been awake you've been playing Runescape for the past four months. Impressive. 
---
Who hurt u lol

It‚Äôs a use the completely kills the difficulty of inferno. You can face tank anything with no negative penalty. At least with justiciar your accuracy goes to crap.

For one, the Brimstone ring is too powerful to be imbued.

It might be possible for one locked into melee.

As an ex-high level UIM, I absolutely think you should have taken all the gear you could from his drop. Using a main to protect his ult goes against the spirit of the game mode

So you don't have to carry 3 individual rings.

Ouu no Microsoft support for ms paint GL bro

You have no idea how this game works. If you prefer bosses with no unique mechanics go face tank bandos.

Can Jagex start including stats for all major content releases?  Recently the skill and quest requirements have been released for new elf quest, it would be interesting to see 
---
1. How many players are capable of completing it before/as it was announced
---
2.  How many players are capable of completing it on release (or shortly before), who did not meet the requirements initially at the announcement
---
3.  Which requirements most people did not have to complete the quest (maybe top 3 skills that most players did not have, or a bar graph of players who did meet each individual requirement).
---
It would be an interesting insight into statistics, like for Hydra how many players were eligble and how many worked towards 95 before release.
---
add Pure Ess to that list too.
---
Oh no...
---
Do you also believe the rabbit's foot increases nests dropping from trees?

---
I think you should tell Dovydas that was a bit more than a mute.
---
More bosses like that would be preferred actually. We would go back to where defense bonuses matter.
---
That and the simplicity is better for mobile users.
---
I bet it‚Äôs SwiftKit, that was the shit back in the day.
---
Stop playing the game, bro.
---
I feel like the ice boss was decently challenging. But yeah I guess I can see a 4 now a days. I do feel like ds1 is a 1 one though. It's got a level 80 dragon to kill. For F2P it's hard but it's hard to rate them on the same scale
---
All I do on mobile is birdhouse runs and fishing. I do abyss rc on pc.
---
Fight caves is just a time investment. The only thing that can kill you if you take your time is Jad, so it's just a matter of taking the time to get there to make attempts at him. 
---
I mean I guess there's nothing wrong with it just seems really odd to me that what others do would heavily impact your own views? But obviously if the only reason you got bored of it was seeing it constantly then that's fine. The way you said it just made it seem like ''if it's popular I can't like it'' I definitely feel you though, as I dislike wearing the same shit (even in rs) for too long, just get bored of it.

You could've been maxed combat if you didn't get 67 rc lmao

I think the problem is RS3 Distractions and Diversions are just so prominent now. There's one for like every skill and they're constantly firing off like every half hour. It feels impossible to just sit down and grind one thing because you're incentivized to run a never ending revolving door of D&amp;Ds.

How much work is it to recolor your graceful ? With the house favour 
---
I think you're right. If your able to watch/interact more Hard is the way to go. Defense on them stays the same. More health on the bosses means potential for bigger hits and less downtime as you mentioned. 
---
Some people will use the xp boosting bosses, but im not sure how much difference they make vs using just the low defense guys.

I have a max cape and wouldn't mind this change. Am I high enough level to have an opinion?

‚ÄúEffort‚Äù LOLOL. Forcing players to runecraft is not effort, it‚Äôs just making pvmers who want to pvm slightly more efficiently go through a shit skill for no reason. Dks has nothing to do with runecrafting, vice versa. I rather kill 5000 dags than get 77 rc. Fuck u and ur fake ‚Äúeffort‚Äù.

Do your scrolls. I always do mine. I'm 29 clue scrolls total with a little more than half of them being hard clue scrolls. My one and only decent loot was about 3m (Robin hat, arma page, and a few other cheap items). I believe I've had only a few that were in the 200k-300k total, the rest being 100k on average and maybe 30k or so being my lowest. Not to mention, most of my hard clue scrolls always involved the damn wilderness, which is frustrating and tedious work for 100k, but it was always an adventure and exciting to see what I'd end up with. Anyways, the point is do your clue scrolls. You never know when you'll hit the jackpot. Also, it's usually easy profit.

Could you give us a toggle to turn off other player sounds? This would help mobile players with afk skilling at work or doing other activities.

Ogresses warriors are really good they drop rune items, nature runes, and gems. I think it's about 100-300k/h. They are safespot-able.

90% of people use gay the same way Eminem does in his songs, more to describe something as annoying or something that isn't normal to them, not every word or phrase comes down to maturity. That's like saying people who swear loads are immature, when that just isn't the case.

And what time zone would this be?

If you think it's shitty, don't do it
---
Okay? My point is runecrafting has nothing to do with pvming or dags, so why force players who want to do them more efficiently to runecraft? Jagex can keep going down this trend and all it will do is keep dividing pvmers and pkers from skillers. How about we add a 100k exp hour rc method only allowed in deep wild? I bet rcers will blow their fucking mind being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to engage in pvp to achieve better exp rates. See how stupid that sounds?
---
*Actually yesterday, not today despite the title*, I came across him mining mithril on Fossil Island so I asked him why he was doing it (as it's inefficient, reee.. I know). He got back to me via PM, saying he was waiting for his birdhouses to be done and wasn't in a hurry as he's retired, and also asked if he could buy my flippers from me (cue heart melt). So from there we got talking. 
---
Was definitely taken back to find someone just enjoying the game like that and how it keeps him close to family, as for a lot of players (myself included) it's more like a second job. I will say his stats are nothing to sniff at, he may be cute but he's far from a noob! But yeah super chill guy, he loves exploring the game so hopefully I will get the chance to explore a little with him in the future.
---
Oh, and he got back to me this morning to let me know he did in fact get his very own pair of flippers :)
---
You're gonna pop a vein with all that flex.

Because Yule has nothing to do with swampletics : \^ )

More than one way to do it would be problematic.
---
Say we want players to be able to do is for 10 mins aggro with 1hr cool down.
---
If we make 2 items the same but different, we go from 10 mins e ery hour to 10 mins every half hour which is a lot more.

I agree with all of this! At least close the head slot requirement!

Hey guys, I wasn't hating on SC. I found it tons of fun when I was younger and had all the time in the world to play RuneScape. Now that I have a job and school though I really wouldn't have time for minigames unless that was all I cared to do. Anyone saying the efficiency community back then was just as large is just flat out wrong. Lots of players in my position where they only have an hour or 2 to play daily.

If you haven‚Äôt done much questing there‚Äôs a few quests that unlock better gear. Fremenik trials will get you a better helmet for all 3 styles, fremenik isles will get you an even better melee helm.

Doing Pest control for Void armour is beneficial. As is doing barbarian assault for a fighter top, which is Best in slot for a very long time for melee. Animal magnetism is essential for range.

Tier is the BASE Power for gear. TECHNICALLY there can be all tiers 1 to 69 before, even cosmetic tierless.
---
In practice, most gear early on follows divisions of 10, with niche gear being in divisions of 5. Beyond t70 it's usually in divisions of 5 or 2.
---
Tiers also don't need to be tied to respective level: Bone Dagger is 1 attack but is T12, but this is really rare. Then there's more fuzziness with t85 weps with t90 accuracy but t80 strength, weapon passives and more.
---
Max tier is 100 which is only on comp cape, current equipment max tier is 92 which is currently getting developments. T92 is about 1.7x stronger than T70.

Then he has a dharok friend and his alt declawing crabs when their spec is up. Dude with ancients etc.

He says he doesn't have work so he can do this all day. Eventually his friends leave, his dharok friend drops prayer and gets hit a 1 by a rock crab and dies. Main guy leaves and just has his zerker alt tabbing to the koruend house portal and declawing my crabs with his spec pool.

OR maybe they get the most views because theyre all very famous people who are polarizing...so pretty much not surprising those podcasts end up with the most views (although many other podcasts with physicists and other interesting people rack up tons of views as well). 
---
But live in your little delusional bubble and believe whatever narrative you see fit, common sense and logic is light you should seek howver.
---
You said it was banned for macroing. Which is it? 
---
I hate when I‚Äôm at Seers Village trying to enjoy the peaceful beauty of northern Kandarin and a bunch of people in graceful are mindlessly running around the rooftop course 
---
Does Bob also have 2 step authentication on his e-mail account?
---
ok

The percent is all that matters, you don't.

Hi! i would like to join a PvM clan to do bossing etc. Not interested in Raiding atm but in bossing i am. Currently i do not match the combat lvl req i am combat lvl 101 atm with 80 att/ 80 str/ 77 def and 80 prayer.
---
Planning on getting the req 105 combat ofc but atm i am grinding out for quest cape and after that i can grind my combat stats up to get a higher combat lvl ofc.
---
So my question is can i already join? to meet you guys etc and after i have the right combat stats i can join in pvming and things like that?
---
my rsn is: Rietenmand
---
lol wtf guys
---
No fix. Only bad.
---
Gotta admit that‚Äôs what got me 
---
I did a raid with a Spanish dude, gave him instructions all the way up until before olm and he didn't listen or respond and I got really mad, he then said "no speak English only Spanish" and I whipped out Google translate to help him prep and give him call outs at olm

yOu dOnT hAvE tO rEaD iF yOu dOnT wAnT tO!

Very unaware poster tbh
---
any good blackjacking guides? I am 50 thieving and only getting 35-40k exp/hr... this is shitty right?
---
I knew how to spell monologue but I was like there's no way I include the u in there. Fucking English üò™
---
No it's not. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about. Why don't you learn a bit about the game before doing what you're doing?
---
You can hide auto chat. 
---
damn man nicee, hopefully we can trade places, haha nice exchange
---
Going from a climate change denier (Jordan peterson) to a conspiracy theorist is not a big leap. If you already consider your opinion to be more valuable than 97% of climate scientists then why wouldn't you also believe in inter dimensional DMT trips?
---
I don't know why so many people are on reddit are being so petty.  I think we should make content accessible to pures and not have them locked out of ape atol or prif because of some def exp reward.
---
"They choose to limit themselves"
---
They chose to limit their combat so they can kill people in pvp not so that they couldn't chin in mm2 or enter prif because on minor quest in the reqs gives def xp.  
---
now maybe the pvp community on the whole doesnt want to have access to a piece of content due to balancing of pvp but I dont see why they shouldnt have access to content like prif.
---
Also if they are busy questing and skilling that mean they farming your spades in the wilderness.  So win win for everyone.
---
Btw i personally dont have a pure and think their community seems pretty toxic but the "they choose to limit themselves" argument triggers me.  
---
Not to mention that EHP for mains assumes that you are multilogging alts to make money lol
---
Isn't EHP runecrafting like, fucking ZMI with runners? Something that costs 12 mill an hour?
---
I have 71 agil and still don‚Äôt have full graceful lol
---
Wolq Pew\*
---
I'll be there, hopefully with a joke
---
Ohhhh yeaaassshhhhhhh
---
Not that kind of fantasy game smh.
---
That'll do, donkey. 
---
I tried barbarian fishing, but It was also painfully slow at 62. is that suppose to be the ticking method? because i'm more of an afk fisher 
---
I know what you mean, lol. I‚Äôm mobile only tho so I got used to the puzzles through questing lol. They still suck tho!
---
Regarding The Gauntlet, can you showcase what the breakpoints are for the various skills utilized? Do rewards scale off skill levels, or time of completion, which is indirectly tied to skill level? 
---
Sure! I will be on in like an hour x)
---
if  you can serve me a cup of coffee so that we wait together, I would appreciate very much. thanks  for comment.
---
Oh my ducking god please yes 
---
Thanks man! Really love the series
---
Because he‚Äôs helping other lanes but you‚Äôre too busy looking at your fishing to realize your jungler is 5-0-4 and has gotten the other 2 lanes 4 kills each and solo killed the enemy jungler once. 
---
Loadouts from RS3 were really fuckin useful, but it would devalue a lot of different aspects of the game (will affect fletching exp/hr, superglass make gp/hr, etc) since a lot of skills or money making methods are bottlenecked with a complicated banking method and it will become ridiculously fast to do.
---
I would love it as a QoL update, but I fear the economy would be affected
---
Fair enough, thanks man
---
Yeah this makes more sense but I still think they should remove some of the slayer rewards that make no sense being slayer related like the rune pouch and herb sack and put them into other content. 
---
The slayer reward shop and skill in general is already oversaturated as it is. 
---
Runescape robbed my house, got me arrested and fucked my wife. Not to be trusted.
---
&gt; why force players who want to do them more efficiently to runecraft?
---
No one's forcing you to do anything. You still don't get it. This is why you're entitled. If you want to unlock those perks more than you don't like engaging in the content, then do so. If you're turned off by the skill more than you want the rewards, then don't train it.
---
Listening to this hurts.
---
That‚Äôs a good point, man, thanks.
---
I'd give up.  Ugliest pet IMO, and I got one at lvl 73.
---
I know. I thought it would and then I realized I made a huge mistake.
---
I'm all for challenging bosses, just not movement or unblock-able typeless moves. 
---
Some mechanics i liked was the shadow spells effect on sire, ice barrage freezing the ToB spiders/inferno nibs. And the dagganoth mother/Sarian the Twisted.
---
Something like where using a wrong attack style would enrage the boss causing it to heal/deal more damage. 
---
But crap like demonic gorillas boulders or Drake fire ball just serves a nuisance and should be scrapped.
---
Dodge moves CAN be good mechanics, look at nomad in pre-eoc for example. But current these are becoming excessive. Vorkath is one of the few npcs which are imo cancer.
---
A majority of people will vote for whatever is going to win, this is the definition of a poll. It‚Äôs far worse to have people vote with no opinion just to see the actual results 
---
PMod mutes are 1 hour.
---
Haha, sounds like you've had enlightening experiences. 
---
One thing ive noticed is when you're "on the other side" it feels like you got all the answers, like you know the answers to humanity and everything but as soon as you're back, you lost it all hahahah. 
---
My nitrous ballon, you mean those whipitz? Im very familiar with them and love combining them with acid. 
---
One fun combo is MDMA, LSD and THC. Its hard to go bad on this combo because of the MDMA. 
---
Ill share something as well, please note that english is not my mother language. 
---
Highest ive gone was about 6 tabs of void realm 105 micrograms each. This was with a friend of mine and his friend (we all worked in the same company) 
---
So his friend had a crush on my ex, and kind of "feared" me because im big. He always thought that i was going to beat him up for having a crush on my ex. 
---
Im 120 kilos and 189 centimeters and I look pretty agressive but im the sweetest teddybear once you get to know me. 
---
Anyways, I and my friend started the trip. 
---
We both took about 600-650 micrograms (i cant be certain that this was correct because i didnt create the blotters) but they were ordered from GG and im pretty sure they're reliable when it comes to the dosing. We got a 100 tab arc from them.
---
About 2 hours in his friend comes by and at this point we both are already pretty fucked up. My friend is having conversations with himself and everything that i was looking at was melting and zoning out into all different shapes. We both were feeling extremly good. 
---
So i go up, get to the door and open up. I see his friend and he has a fucking aura around himself, im not joking. He had this red'ish aura around himself. I welcome him and go back to the living room where my friend is and now i see that he also has an aura, a blue one. 
---
We told our friend what and how much we took and he told us he was on about 200.
---
It all went good from this point, some reaaally weird shit was happening but it was all satisfying, for all 3 of us. 
---
Now, his friend brought up my ex. Not sure why but he did. I told him. Look, its fine you are safe here and no one is going to hurt you. He was sitting in the middle of the couch, my friend on his left side and me on the right. 
---
I noticed that he started to shake a bit and kind of started to lean on my friend, away from me. I repeat to him that everything was going to be okay. 
---
Didnt work too good. 
---
Fastforwarding a bit, he started to get very anxious, walking back and for in the room, mumbling something. 
---
We were still sitting on the couch trying to calm him down. (at this point we both are peaking pretty hard, and we have also added a fuckton of THC into this trip) 
---
His friend starts to take his clothes and suddenly jumps on the table. It was a crappy table from IKEA but man he broke it good. My friend stands up and kind of pushes him away while he then runs to the other side and starts to smash stuff. I stand up and try to block him from destroying valuable stuff. 
---
He attacks my friend.
---
My friend was about 100 kilos and same lenght as me, and his friend is 50 kilos, skinny.
---
So we try to hold him and move him to the bathroom.
---
We put him in the shower and rum cold water on him. Didnt work too well because he started to panic even more. And trying to control a situation like this, on fucking 650 micrograms of LSD is not easy. 
---
Fastforwarding a bit again. 
---
AT this point, almost the whole apartment is shattered. (my friend has a pic somewhere) 
---
Im standing by the door to then apartment and my friend in the kitchen holding him. He escapes my friend, rushing at me/door. He just charges and smashes at the door(its locked) he bends the fucking lock and I thought fuck it, if he wants out imma let him out, so i open the door and he runs out, naked and this is december, in Sweden. 
---
Me and my friend just look at eachother both chocked by the incident. The whole apartment looked like a garbage yard. 
---
We came to the conclusion that we have to find him or he might freeze to death. So we go to my car...... 
---
My car... 
---
On fucking 650 micrograms of good LSD. 
---
Luckily i couldnt start it because it was like trying to start a space ship from year 3029. 
---
We walk around in the town trying to find him but there was no clue of him. 
---
We go back to the apartment and kind of plan our next step. 
---
I mean, we got drugs scattered all over the apartment, what if someone heard? This was in the middle of a friday night, there was blood on me, my friend and in the gate. And it was impossible for this incident to go by unoticed, what if someone calls thr Police? 
---
We quickly gather what we could and I went out of the apartment to hide the drugs. 
---
I come back and we kind of just sat down for a good hour, ventilating and just breathing. 
---
So after about an hour, we thought fuck it, if someone heard and called the Police, they shouldve been here already. 
---
I go out and go to the place where i hid about 50g of weed, white plastic bag and glass jar.
---
We roll a blunt and smoke it. 
---
Then guess what? 
---
Door knocks, hard knocks. 
---
We both get silent. 
---
"OPEN UP, POLICE."
---
This was a moment where if i had eaten something, id shit it out in an instant. 
---
"we have to open the door, we have to" my friend says.
---
Im just like yeah fuck it. 
---
So he opens the door and tells them to come in quick. 
---
3 cops, 2 women 1 man. 
---
One of the women immediately sniffs and says:
---
"it smells like marijuana in here" 
---
So my friend tried to take a bullet said, yeah, thats me, we partied a bit and my friend just lost it, explaining the situation (without saying that we had taken LSD, just alcohol and weed)
---
So long story short, the man, he looked like a superior officer says this:
---
Well boys, it looks like you've had enough of a hard time already. (rough pronounciation) 
---
They turned and FUCKING LEFT. THEY LEFT. 
---
After this point, i treat these drugs with the respect that they deserve. 
---
Sorry for the wall of text but i just kept going. 
---
Potato picks you
---
Or move it to a tile northwest of the most northern west stall in the picture.

Every player is perfectly capable of engaging in PvM without noted dragon or the max cape. Plenty of player have done before those existed and there is an option to not do the diary. Not a single player is forced to train rc for diary rewards. PvM is highly profitable without a single diary completed.
---
Noob question but what do you mean you can stab and also get strength xp ?
---
You want Shamina in the UK. Stay banned from rs.
---
If stealing creation gets added to OSRS, I'll eat my socks
---
Lol found it in ours aswell
---
Your reply explained the ex part right away.
---
Hey man no problem, I accept your apology
---
Now *you* dont get the joke
---
Good thing the Dutch Defense libraries has it
---
Is went to my best friend‚Äôs house who had just started playing. I was instantly obsessed. All our friends played. It was a glorious time, we all got into the same stuff in waves, like MtG, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic, Age of Empires, WoW. It was great to have so many friends to play games with. I only have one friend who plays, I was trying to catch up to his stats but he got hacked, botted, then banned, and all he has left is a low-level Ironman. I miss certain things about being young. 
---
All for buffing skilling methods in regards to resource gathering.  An important point here would be to update associated drop tables though.  If you add better skilling methods, but don't update the tables, you'll flood the market with resources, resource prices would fall to a point where it isn't worth it to get them from skilling, and the monsters would continue to be the main source.
---
"That tobacco was amazing by the way"
---
I get similar combat exp rates doing slayer compared to NMZ, theres no buff needed to slayer damage.
---
It is yeah and the guide recommends monkfish for afk lmao. Id just do trout + salmon for 10-15 levels/ ur patience wears thin and make the switch after that
---
Thanks. I don't know of any community or anything of the sort. I just see other people doing clues from time to time and chat.
---
The high construction level is easily one of the most useful things to do in the game. Helps out on basically everything. Gl on the clues
---
Yeah not one. I even went and bought a new ring of wealth lmfaooo. I was asking everyone I was there with too and they said they weren‚Äôt getting any either 
---
Are you going to try to pretend that Joe rogans fans aren't also big fans of Jp and Shapiro? You realize that literally every time they are on (JP has been on like 6 times btw) they get massive support in the comments, both reddit and youtube? You do realize that Alex Jones had a ton of people defending him in both the sub and youtube comments? 
---
You claim I live in a delusional bubble, yet you ignore the facts and make up whatever narrative you want based on nothing but your feelings.
---
Barb fish until Atleast 78
---
rEeeeeeeEepost
---
Hey man, you're the one that asked. And I'm going based on how PKers talk about it on this subreddit. You want to know why people don't like PKers, it's because they're assholes to everyone else.
---
And you're right: I don't like PKing. I don't find it fun or enjoyable. But I'm not sure how me clearly not having PKed makes me unqualified to know if PKers are assholes on Reddit.
---
Even so, the difficulty of theatre of blood is in another ballpark compared to previous grandmaster quests like MM2 and DS2. Just look at how many people have done MM2 and DS2 compared to how many people have just 1 ToB KC.
---
That's not how slayer level reqs work, you have to have 44 slayer to damage them
---
Especially considering you can actually make bank with slayer 
---
everyday
---
You've been had twice now.
---
Any updates on a weapon that can be combined with hydra tail
---
Nice repost.
---
Bro chill out. It‚Äôs a new series and Something fresh for the YouTube scene. People are just hyping it up because there hasn‚Äôt been much other amazing content lately. And it‚Äôs very interesting to most to see the tedious grinds he does.
---
Jamflex mage him immune to magic damage for bullshit reasons. 
---
"we don't want ppl to safespot with no risk" 
---
...even though range/melee can do that with less expenses.
---
An untrimmed agility cape... finally, a worthy opponent.
---
Just say neigh to gambling
---
leaked his name and amount of time played mine now
---
You're SOL then
---
Thank you! So is Void armor considered good for mage? or sort of a jack of all trades armor?
---
I was considering buying Mystic armor, but not sure if thats worth it.
---
Yes and at one point in a dev Q&amp;A someone asked the devs what their least favorite areas of RuneScape are and one of them said this exact thing. They at least know Herblore sucks.
---
Sure that makes sense. What kind of ideas do you have for expanding herblore past just making potions? 
---
Or just use the ardougne one ;)
---
Hi thecanadianbum,  
---
Yes, you just join the clan chat and start playing with the other clan members. Ask to be added to the clan discord and somone will get you on it. Once you want to start ranking up you can apply to the clan and you will be added to the ranks roster and skill of the week/boss of the week.
---
Dude me too and same age lol
---
Woke up with no head? 
---
I'm just spitballing, man. 
---
Who's the mr big brain gay boi now
---
65 agility is not 60+ hours lol
---
Is this true haha? I see this joke all the time, and I was wondering why they didn't just change it to shut everybody up.
---
I don't think anyone would go in to the wildy to pk the clue hunters but if theres literally no one else to pk why wouldn't they lol. This is what happens when no pvp-content passes
---
Train defense with magic bursting instead?
---
oh shit it is, increases success by 2%... what a worthless boost lmao
---
More fun things like this, I love our community.  
---
You shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to do anything in a video game. I swear this is the most toxic mindset of this community
---
Not everyone should be able to get high levels in some skills and that's okay, it's part of the game and part of the MMO experience. There SHOULD be some crazy difficult/grindy aspects of the game that only appeal to a certain type of player. It separates those who put in the hours and those who don't. It's okay to not have, or never get 80+ rcing.
---
I've gone 900 kills at demonic gorillas without a zenyte or any ballista pieces. Your luck actually puts me into a fit of rage. I'm seething. Fuck you.
---
What kind of pvp-content would help with that? I dont understand the whole "we need pvp-content" thing. You kill players, what other content can be added? 
---
100%. agiles were great content. gracefuls managed to do just about everything worse.
---
You can, unless you like sharing with people and getting shit xp. 
---
Damn, nice RNG. I love barrows, so easy, pretty good money overall.
---
Lol it was all over the CSGO Katowice major chat this past weekend. This sub is leaking hard.
---
I mean I guess, i dont play the game to visually watch 120p pixels fish though, i play to complete goals and to do that with the time given to me you must be efficient. So then, you use the best gear thats easily attainable and here we fucking are 
---
EMA My Ass
---
Sure *passes coffee*
---
I miss this game so much dude
---
Hello that was my very valuable lost item, I forget the name of the valuable lost item, but I do remember losing said item in the south Ardy bank world 330
---
I never said it wasn't buddy, I'm just a simple man trying to get his runescape account back
---
Same here, shown Miniclip through a friend at 8, 22 now.
---
Burh, Wtf. Put a guide for that. Quest

Mod West showed off a possible Arceuus Spellbook rework about a year ago. Is there any update available on this, or has the idea been scrapped?
---
For the gauntlet, could you please add a cosmetic reward to show x amount of completions? Similar to the raids 1 and raids 2 cape. Perhaps a crystal cloak?
---
Secondly, could you add a reward that gives you a small bonus within the gauntlet? Dungeoneering had the Ring of Kinship, which you could upgrade using dungeoneering tokens. Perhaps you could have the ring use charges over time so it sinks crystal shards.
---
10/10
---
I mean if it was any other teleport, yeah. But it's Lleyta. Even if you were just doing fruit trees to 99, you'd still only ever use like 200 charges max. Lleyta isn't exactly the Grand Exchange.
---
Too much effort I guess.
---
Tell him about anglerfish. They're even slower than sharks.
---
I bet you are one of those people who would vote yes to cosmetic overrides if it gets polled
---
Addictions are nothing to be ashamed of my man
---
If you read the whole comment you would know we are talking about getting full graceful taking that long not 65 agility. 
---
If you're going full focus you empty your pouches in a tick. That's 0,6secs saved per trip. It's not applicable to lavas, and the for rest (abyss nats, zmi, astrals), you'd get roughly one extra trip per hour from this. And that's being generous. 200 was lowballing it, but you get one extra inventory. 600 seems like a closer figure. Which is still negligible, especially since it doesn't affect the methods people use to train currently - lavas and bloods/souls.
---
The locator/scrying orb makes things a lot easier. (the one you get from DS2)
---
Although i still manage to fuck it up hahah
---
is there a way to keep your items worn upon death? like im doing chaos temple and i gotta keep constantly equipping dueling ring and burning amulet after I die b/c it takes up 2 inv spaces
---
Negative XP allows for broken account builds. It's not just a matter of hurrdurr let me reset my xp whenever I want.
---
they could but they would have to make different tiers of ashes then. and its Rs3 content s√• i doubt it would pass. i love to use it on rs3 tho makes the loot piles look so clean :D
---
you are right....
---
It looks fucking beautiful
---
Yeah that's me i dropped my twisted bow by accident 
---
mIRC*
---
MM2 is definitely not hard for casuals.  At worst it's annoying due to puzzles, but you can restock after almost every step of the way
---
LMAO what diaologue is this from?!!
---
Marks of grace won't repay for the time you have wasted to make 25k more per hour . Relleka is dead content.
---
Three more quests until QPC so yeah.
---
You chose to limit yourself. 
---
This. This 10 times over. I'd feel bad for the guy but but if you're not going to take the challenge seriously you can get out.
---
I saw this YouTube video the other day about how a dude killed kbd on a level 3 hcim, but only thanks to the venom from his main... so pretty fucking pointless if you ask me.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt they add the most inefficient tools to the game? 
---
I call bull shit
---
Burst/barrage in MM tunnels and spice it up with bursting slayer tasks. 
---
I have a maxed range tank with 70 70 melees and it‚Äôs boring work to train 99 def but it isn‚Äôt painstakingly  slow if you barrage/burst it. 
---
I too can comment your username in quotes see "CallMeIbra"
---
I don‚Äôt think it necessarily would be OP for that teleport to be unlimited but the more that come into the game the easier it is to justifies additional ones that may be OP. Plus it would make the current lletya teleports completely dead content
---
This looks like a porno i recently watched. 
---
I think you‚Äôre letting your nostalgia cloud your brain. We are not all 12 year olds who have unlimited time do stuff for fun. We know a lot better and I can say with 100% certainty that people that play for fun only and not to be at least somewhat efficient are in the very very small minority.
---
Ash deserves a raise
---
Just shut the door lol
---
Something mildly inconvenient happens in game, please make it easier!
---
You train agility passively just by grinding for graceful, agility would be dead content 100% if graceful doesn't exist
---
Can't tell if braindead or trolling, but based on the username I'm going to guess you're just trolling. 
---
I have a game addiction for sure. Mainly because it‚Äôs cheap and more fun than real life activities which cost nothing. 
---
Runelite client
---
Swampletics
---
We do it because it looks ugly 
---
I‚Äôll try!
---
Getting full graceful doesn't take that either
---
Are you serious?? You've had twice as many items as me in less than 1/4 the chests
---
God damn i wish i was that lucky
---
Congrats!
---
1. account gets hijacked
---
2. Hijacker uses account to bot
---
3. Account gets banned
---
Is it that hard to follow? 
---
Why don‚Äôt you do your research first you idiot. 
---
Use someone else‚Äôs poh on w330/319
---
Yeah I‚Äôm only able to do one a trip, I still take a lot of damage cause I don‚Äôt know every single rotation yet, I‚Äôm loads better than I was though.
---
a decent 99 ;)
---
The wiki absolutely contains more than killing pvm stuff. I used the wiki when I was starting out too. I don't recommend this one but as an analogy showing it's not all end game pvm stuff, one of the listed methods was picking white berries in the wilderness. Literally running out to the wilderness, picking white berries, running back and selling them. It also has low level pvm activities like farming chaos druids. The wiki has a ton of low level content you can do. I'm under the impression you only skimmed it
---
c
---
This post doesn‚Äôt mention being banned at all, just hacked. How hard was that to follow? 
---
Pretty similar stuff happens on the daily with my buddy
---
"Hey whatsup?"
---
"BAREHANDING SHARKS STILL"
---
It's been 2 weeks and I miss him
---
You're tripping balls and hallucinating. There is a reason Yannille has so few people.
---
Mood
---
Yeah, cause they'll be way safer in Syria after talking shit sayin IS was corrupt, absolute genius, but anyway were talking about more serious things here. Runescape. Try to have some perspective 
---
Thats really good tbh
---
Why does it matter? You can just click the vote button before reading? Self-control combined with not letting other people influence you isnt that hard of a concept.
---
You mad man
---
jar gang! woot woot
---
Gz mate! 
---
49, cause u start at level 1 not 0
---
That hardly seems relevant. You think two things can only be true if they‚Äôre in the same reddit post?
---
Congrats bro
---
do you wanna go do karate in the garage?!
---
How
---
Dragon are better. You will max more often with dragon.
---
QPC teleport is still faster though
---
Not sure if you made this or found it but I love it
---
Yeah thats me, dropped my cabbage by accident. My RSN: CabbageMan, thanks for picking it up for me. 
---
50, cause u start at level 1 not 0
---
I introduced it to a friend of mine I met through Final Fantasy XIV that had never played before. He is currently around 1400 total and going for barrows gloves and his first 99.
---
He plays it more than FFXIV now.
---
Why
---
Did this about 4 days ago imbuing my slayer helm. Instant regret
---
Are there any ideas or updates coming to pvp soon?
---
When someone makes 3 posts in a row about being banned for macroing then all of the sudden says they‚Äôre hacked in the 4th, how does that not seem relevant? How does not having any information at all not seem relevant? It happens all the time I‚Äôm not denying that. It‚Äôs stupid of you to assume I am
---
On my 1 defense pure i used to minigame tele to port kazard and take the charter.
---
I would do upwards of ten kills in one inventory though so the tele always had time to refresh.
---
Jeez I didn't know Dragon Axes were 81K
---
Dudes got talent, 
---
No because this will allow pures to get into Prif
---
Its weird I've always worked towards the general goal of being so rich I can just pk and fuck around. But whenever I'm that rich I get bored of pking in like 2 weeks lol.
---
nice idea but itd make the other rings completely useless unless you take out imbuing this ring
---
That's fucking amazing
---
Wow you‚Äôre a genius for thinking of an idea no one has EVER thought of or suggested before!
---
For real FOG for 11$ sounds fair
---
Only Arrows worth a damn are addy+
---
And if you're not pking in f2p, only amethyst and dragon, and rune I suppose if you don't want to spend on amethyst IMO.
---
At 100 gp per rune arrow and 200 for amethyst, they're not too expensive (1/5 break, so they're around 20 gp and 40 gp/shot each respectively).
---
I too wish to get 99 in a single button press.
---
Because it's the only UIM series that doesn't suck. UIM is (imo) the most interesting game mode, but no one does it because it's cancerous. The only other UIM series either start half way done already. Or they're just paced incredibly poorly. I saw a different UIM series where his first episode he gets 1-99 firemaking from wintertodt. Just horrible progression, no build up, no suspense, and not interesting.

Wilderness course is better xp than the rooftop course of that corresponding level range so I sacrificed marks of grace for quicker agil gains.
---
Original white/grey-coloured Graceful is the only passable choice. It looks quite beautiful.

Not true, pet takes priority and the resource drops on the floor.

---
Yeah, it doesn't take that long for graceful. I just went members and that was the first thing I went for. Timing it from 1 agility to when I got all the marks (at 57 agility) took me 17 hours. If you go super hard on it you can get up to 20 marks an hour on the canafis course and bring it down to about 14-15 hours of agility training.

What‚Äôs your ign? I‚Äôm tryna see your total lvl. Bet you‚Äôre casual :/ 
---
I played this all the time as a low-mid levelled player, always being envious of the high leveled players using ice/blood barrage. The sound effects I hear of those spells still remind me of those days. This game needs to be brought back, make the rewards good enough to keep the game worthwhile but not OP... that is simple enough. By far the most fun minigame runescape ever had.
---
Smithing is so fast who gives a shit, plus the +5 is an 8% chance, you‚Äôre better off boosting with an ale from 72 then you are +5 boosting, ever besides construction.
---
Rune crafting can be removed from the game. Fuck that aids
---
If you‚Äôre using any of those for kraken you‚Äôre an idiot and need 4 per kill.  So addy, rune, amethyst, dragon, and bronze/iron for kraken. Even cut out the addy that‚Äôs still 4 types, plus there‚Äôs already a bolt pouch and that only holds what 4 maybe 5 types? Very much an equivalent.

&gt; As another has said hiding the results would be a pain
---
In terms of dev time required?
---
&gt;the devs had it that way so the community actually knows what's passing and what's not and they aren't just pushing updates that they want in the game.
---
You're able to see this after you've voted though,  or alternatively if you go through a couple of steps
---
if you were capable of killing other pkers you wouldn't be worried about this &amp; if you cant kill someone wearing bulwark in multi thats only a failure on your part like jfc

My first week on osrs I decided to make a dds staker and after doubling my bank from 3.5m to 7m I encountered the newly released blowpipe and lost everything. It taught me a valuable lesson: fuck the arena.
---
Oof, my thoughts exactly.  I'm all for shooting down an ex with a good meme here and there, but an obscure sweaty OSRS meme just doesn't feel like the right move.
---
So an iron bar gyve more xp then a runite bar. Ye i got ya. Makes alot of sense. Ohh and a leather chaps also gyve more xp then making black d hide chaps. Ohhh and casting air strike gyves more xp then casting fire blast. Makes alot of sense ya !
---
You talk about Qol but don‚Äôt even mention the horrendous sound when casting plank make? Honestly I‚Äôd rather them fix the casting noise above anything else. 
---
Isn't pushing updates you want in the game the entire point of polling..?
---
Would it be possible to remove the Zanaris "random events"? It's my favorite bank but being locked in an animation for 5 seconds every now and then makes it annoying to do herblore or other things that require some sort of bankstanding. Possibly having it be a sort of reward from Fairytale 2 to give some sort of incentive to complete it other than just starting it for fairy rings.

Hmm what about if the small seed is just a tool seed and the crystal saw is unlocked via doing the eyes quest. When asking the elves about it they refer to believing that such a tool was rather pointless and didnt think the player would use it but will allow them to convert any tool seeds to a saw after that point.

I think you guys lose sight of just how idiosyncratic OSRS is in terms of the video game landscape as a whole. OSRS takes repetition and boring gameplay to the next level.

It really is pretty rampant throughout the game. As much as people like to hate on agility, its interesting to see how many people have an agility related outfit
---
No. For me on task slayer helm i bp dragom darts eagle eye and 97 range i cant out dps them maybe 2 out of 8 kills i tried with real good rng
---
That last one tho
---
I'm stupid/dumb because I think using noted Pure Essence on an altar is a bad idea? Please explain.
---
Tele scrolls allow you to get ~ 5-6 more kills/h give or take depending on the method you‚Äôre currently using to get to Zulrah. 
---
On average, if you‚Äôre doing 3 kill trips, that means you‚Äôre doing roughly 7-8 trips/h. 
---
Avg Zulrah kill loot = 130k/kill x 6 kills = 780k extra gp/h 
---
8 x 25k (scroll cost) = 200k extra cost 
---
= 580k increase in gp/h. 
---
Now this is a pretty basic calculation and it also represents pretty much max efficiency unless you‚Äôre using a sanguinesti staff. It could be lower depending on deaths or bad rng trips. 
---
Takeaway - scrolls are significantly better 
---

---
Guessing you've never heard of a thing called normative social influence? The MMO context is irrelevant, people will always tend towards following the crowd because it's hardwired into our brains.
---
I could be wrong about this, but I'm reasonably confident the interaction between the bonus Marks of Grace from the seers diary and the 20+ level mark reduction is broken. In my experience, with the elite seers diary completed before hitting 80 agility, my Marks per hour did not go down after hitting 80. It's still like 12/13. 
---
This asshole isn't permabanned though.
---
My WC is lvl 98 
---
I could be making it up but I think pets roll on the experience drop which is why different fish have different pet drop rates, so I doubt it affects pet chance 
---
The dragon hatsa has nearly reached the same value as dragon spear, despite it being as rare as it is. would you guys be keen on changing the dragon hasta spec to be the same as dragon spear? it would see a whole lot more use, atleast in the wild since it would be able to be used with a shield.
---
Yeah, thanks for editing your comment and adding that *after* I made my reply. There are people who actually would want something like that.
---
Been around for a while, never had a problem with jagex customer support.

Literally there is a picture up right now if a guy who got the agility pet at 230k exp (59 agility) and is still missing 2 pieces of graceful..... You are basing all your facts on maximum rng and not averages....

i think it's more that every day you forgot to properly secure your account

U don‚Äôt pk, u don‚Äôt know what ur talking about. Nh stake me if u wana keep shit talking about shit u don‚Äôt even participate in. The only reason I complain about bulwark is because I abuse it myself and know how strong it is for a 0 risk item.

Better client infrastructure so that updates aren't held back due to the impossibility of programming it.

Dunno why people are judging OP so negatively. We don't know what happened. Maybe she cheated on OP with his best friend so he hates her guts and never wants to speak to her again, but she messaged him out of the blue, and he's still mad at her so he sent her that to confuse her. Nothing wrong with that.

Yeah I posted elsewhere today about Corp/maiden/bloat/p3. Some people suggested claws beat hally at Corp even accounting for the damage reduction but I didn't check yet.

I know it's sad, but I've died 7-8 times on jad and it's when the healers spawn that I choke on the pray switches. I'm kinda ready to just grind a few more range levels in nmz and not deal with healers.

This is the comment I was looking for 
---
That brings back fond memories of high school.
---
The tinfoil hatter in my says they use it to pass more polls. Obviously Jagex isn't going to poll something they don't like. By even asking if we'd want something, they're pretty much endorsing it and likely want it to pass.
---
I forget exactly how seeing results affects votes, but I know it does. Maybe they're using this to their advantage to pass polls.
---
But you have to wait for your house to load for the POH ring.
---
Bold of you to assume he's anyones friend

Ill try to be there!

I practiced fight caves on an unrestricted world with guthans and an rcb and did just fine.  With blow pipe you'll probably shred it

Fuck no fatigue and backpacks were hell but they did fight off bots for a while so I can understand why Jagex added them.

Wow, this is top tier trolling

Theres one female commentated guide that was actually very good. I used it to do regicide a while ago. Well spoken, good quality mic so easy to understand, and she goes over the lore to without making the quest drag on. Very efficiently I must say. I'll try and find it real fast. Not sure how many guides she has

---
Lol I love all ur assumptions. Stick to ur 3 ticking ironman little guy. Anyone with half a brain using a bulwark won‚Äôt be killed by a team of 5 or less. I know how strong it is because I abuse it as well. Only good thing about bulwark is for multi war callers that get tagged by 10 bolters. The wilderness is not meant to be a safe space for anyone. 
---
It will live on in my gallery too now
---
Then why not ban all discussion of poll results if you have a problem with people conforming to social norms regarding game updates? Why is it wrong for you to be influenced by raw vote totals but not by a reddit post where someone pleads that everyone vote yes? They do the exact same thing.
---
Vorkath/brutal blues for blue dragon, Abby sire for Abby demon, skotizo for greater or black demon, guardians for gargoyles.

Just fap to your sexy avatar while fishing like the rest of us

You must not watch that many people. Let's go is a generic catch all phrase that shouldn't be offending anyone. It is literally impossible to make a less offensive phrase and yet you seem to get caught up on it.
---
It's like saying "alright" or "okay", it's more to fill dead air. Like the average streamer isn't going to be able to pull out insane dialogue every second of their stream unless they stream for less than an hour at a time. Sometimes you aren't prepared with the world's greatest speech and just blurt out the first thing on your mind.
---
Yeah the thing is I have blowpipe + guthans and plenty of money for supplies. I've done plenty of bossing so I know if I attempted it I could probably do it. So why do I keep postponing it all the time you may ask? No idea. 
---
For future reference, this really isn‚Äôt the place to ask this kind of question. This thread is more about prospective updates to the game. This type of question you could answer quite easily on the wiki, on a different thread, or with a simple google search. 
---
That said, your best bet for melee gear will be barrows armor, like Torag‚Äôs. It has the same defensive stats as Dharok‚Äôs for much cheaper. You could also try to play Barbarian Assault for a fighters torso for a nice strength bonus. Though I think it‚Äôs an awful mini game, and is not very beginner friendly.
---
For magic you can wear mystic robes until you get Ahrim‚Äôs, and for range just black d‚Äôhide. The blessed d‚Äôhides are exactly the same aside from a prayer bonus, so unless you have money to throw around they aren‚Äôt really worth the much higher cost during lower levels. You could also use Karil‚Äôs but that‚Äôs more for magic defense than range offense. 
---
I hope this helps, and good luck in the future :)

Oh I had no CLUE about the board at Watson‚Äôs House.

---
Thanks, I have seen posts where jagex reply and seem to do this for people
---
thanks?
---
Did I hurt your feelings? Grow some balls you little bitch. If you want to have a private conversation then take it to pm.
---
Idk why so many people are agreeing with you. Claiming pvmers are just people who couldn't handle pvp is extremely arrogant and just not true. Even if you want to call it more difficult (which I disagree on, even as someone that's done both. They are difficult in different ways) you can't act like that just makes it better and people who don't do it aren't doing it because they can't. To top it off you're calling a pvmer lucky if they out farm a pvper for gold. You do realize raiding is like 4-8m/hr right? You've got the roles backwards. As a pvper you'd have to be lucky to make that much. Even top pvpers I've watched like torvesta can't reach those numbers consistently 
---
spent like 12 1/2 minutes typing it up 
---
Same here, I had a relatively low level account that someone hacked and botted to 2k total while I was studying abroad for my dog's funeral in Ireland. Jagex gave me my account back but not the 2k total? What gives?
---
As an addition or rather, a way to tie in more Zogre content; give us As a First Resort...! Maybe the pool rewards would have to be reworked, but I would love to see more Zogre / Ogre content!
---
Oh trust me, there's plenty of condescending assholes lurking to, that being said, the support for this post is mind blowing I am literally beyond thankful 
---

---
Rc bad slayer good
---
Pretty sure the point of ashes is balance. So this mob has "x" benefit but you don't get "y" benefit, in this case prayer exp.
---
Ashes are balanced around making the mob's xp value similar to that of other mobs xp. So greater Demons have high hp and decent drops compared to other mobs around its level but you get the same xp comparatively because even though they have higher hp they have lower prayer. So a Blue dragon is worth say 500 xp to kill, a greater demon is also worth 500 xp to kill. The overall xp distribution is what is changed per mob.
---
Basically what I am saying is that ashes are balanced around them doing nothing, adding value to them is unnecessary.
---
And you suck your fathers cock for a living. So what?
---
I find it much better to not question it.
---
Those are assuming efficient play as well. In reality, most players will take thousands of hours to max whether they play a normal account or an ironman, it doesnt really matter. Unless you set off the goal from the get-go to max, it will more than like take 3000+ hours either way.
---
Hahaha this is great.
---
It‚Äôs so frustrating 
---
Just copypasta from my original post when I first said it, anything girlfriend related turns into his sister
---
Could we see As a First Resort... ever added to OldSchool? Perhaps the pool rewards could be reworked slightly (and maybe not stack)?
---
Yes clearly its my feelings that are hurt..
---
If you paid attention to my posts here you would see i have been nothing but calm and mostly done explaining stuff you brainlets dont understand. Its hilarios actually. All this because i said ‚Äù i dont make the rules ‚Äù.
---
Anyway i am not in any way interested to speak with you in pm, you are clearly 12. Good night kid.
---
Nice to see that resolved. I am curious what the issue was for it to take so long. I mean, I doubt it was high priority compared to other jobs, but it seemed like something that should have affected more than just those items if it were a bigger issue.
---
PvMers are toxic.

Holy fucking shit

What inventory/teleports did you use for jamming medium clues?

make a new acc jagex has terrible customer support. they can probably prove it wasn't you that did it by just looking at IP adresses, but since you can fake all that stuff nowadays people could probably do this maliciously (IE chargeback and then try to appeal)

owo very nice! 
---
That's never the reason for this argument lol. The fact that players can see the current poll results likely influences their vote. In some cases, players could see the current results and may think the poll is a lost cause, and then they don't vote. Gives huge power to the first few thousand voters.

Lmao this is actually true for me.

So let me get this straight:   
---
OSRS came out in 2013. Zulrah was released almost two years later, and flax was added to the drop table to combat bots. So after two years of data, pre-Zulrah, Jagex concluded that flax picking bots were basically the only people picking flax, so they added it to Zulrah's drop table.  
---
...Yet you want to make flax picking "viable" again?  
---
  
---
Sorry your flax-picking bot farm got hit hard, mate. I see you ;)

Thanks, I hate it

---
it's closer but there is a download time when you enter your poh, so the quest cape teleport is actually faster
---
i upvoted this. i play on mobile 75% of the time and only time i can use map without crashing app is as soon as i log in.
---
You can not get anything if no one is buying for your offer or higher.
---
People need to get with the fucking program ASAP as possible
---
New RC training meta?
---
there, general Kenobi.
---
I had this happen to me two years ago and if you can prove the account was compromised and then booted you can get it back, My account was used to bot barrows and I have it back now. So its possible,  just really need to provide a lot of info
---
No rollback for you, can't rollback everyone that makes a mistake on a pure.
---
Woah another person who knows Alcest music?!
---
Hes been playing it for 14 years
---
Just fill them all. It's way simpler.
---
Are mime shows desirable random events? I always dismiss it
---
What in the fuck is that and what does it have to do with anything else in your post. 
---
How is it embarrassing? OP willingly posted the chat to Reddit; he's clearly not embarrassed about it. 
---
Cringe worthy? Maybe to someone who's a bit prudish... Clearly he doesn't give a fuck about the ex or what she might think of him after receiving that text. 
---
And if you think this message can retroactively justify cheating on someone, then you're a bit of an imbecile.
---
Imma say probably don't do that
---
Nope unless your other stays are absolutely abysmal. Keep it. 
---
Get a note 9 and a good 12 foot charging cable then go to town, the pen is just as accurate as your mouse and faster just cant right click 
---
I pretty much refuse to wear it outside of Zeah RC for this exact reason. It's kind of frustrating that it generally outclasses all other equipment for questing/clues/etc.
---
this was the first thought that popped into my head... obvs not nieve, where's the claw?
---
No but gold gives more than rune lmao. And iron ore is faster to mine than runite ore (which was his example, not smithing) 
---
Will you ever hide poll results until after voting?
---
They should also differentiate between upper and lower case.
---
H1
---
Let‚Äôs not and say we did 
---
Do all the quest you can because you'll level passively and actively for requirements, which gives you direction. Slayer to follow if you want a break. Then just find a skill that you really vibe with.
---
Just research other stuff you have questions on during the downtime of skilling.
---
Great vid!
---
proof or it's fake
---
Or add a chat option with bankers. That way its not locked behind Construction

Spider is venenatis, bear is callisto, vetion I think is skeleton. Birds are avianses. Monkeys are also demonic gorillas. These are for when you are just turael skipping though which isn't really the point of it.

nope, looks fine

vorki is a common drop now  #kid

You probably set that all up yourself

Happy birthday tho

Not sure if castle wars is dead content or not, but when I first became a member a million years ago, my mates and I stayed up for hours playing that. 
---
Isnt hydra already the most profitable boss in the game?
---
What builds would become available if OP's suggestion is implemented that aren't already?
---
Middle of march IIRC
---
Youd think it would wouldnt you, but then what else falls under that branch they should test, i dont even think they have much depth or regression to their testing is what im getting at
---
LMFAO the kodak face
---
Wear headphones on max volume for the optimal experience
---
That's hilarious! I'm so happy.
---
It doesn't matter. The clients won't know how everyone is voting because the community on those clients is so small. All you would know is how the other 200 brainlets on that client voted.
---
8 is unload you uncultured swine!

If you don't laugh, you cry.

A red potion? Did she give you a fucking regular restore?

wouldnt it be funnier if it was a 1, but then he hammers his thumb and the 1 drops off back to a zero as he runs away in pain?

So she wouldnt see the bigger pussy

No you‚Äôre supposed to give the SGS to Maria to help her kill cows

It does work with minnows.

You do realize not everyone has push notifications for their email on their phone?

Gross

Funny how you think reposting stuff from a year ago is wrong... 
---
It is funny and I have never seen it before and would never yave if he didnt. Reddit is a place where you share cool stuff you just found out and let people upvote or downvote if they like it. 
---
I did. It's mentioned above. ^

At least you got one my man. I‚Äôd still call you a winner c:

Don‚Äôt drive your car and play runescape you mongoloid.

Imagine having 99 magic and thinking that means you shouldn't be barraging them anyway 
---
shoulda stopped stealing his wine. GAH!
---
fuck the haters this had me dying man ive never ate early before lol
---
The OSRS art on this sub recently been really impressive. Nice piece! 
---
Content dood.
---
The Q&amp;A last week had the requirements. The skills required where all level 70. included Construction, Agility, and 3 or 4 others
---
I just use w30 and bring house tabs and dramen staff and duel ring for castlewars. Always keep the spade and rope. That's really about it once you have all the stashes built. I can get 7-10/hr but I'm not concerned with being as fast as possible.
---
Withdraw 10 at a time, keep noted stacks in inventory and go town until you get a clue
---
I had 2FA. And this is a new computer so I doubt there's a RAT on it.

Try Slayermusiq1 his guides are 2016 but still follow every step needed and you can just skip ahead if you don‚Äôt wanna watch him run :)
---
How can you know he had rigour and augury and that he potted? 
---
Not much &gt; 0 BTW
---
Not just each lap, each obstacle. Everything that gives an exp drop at rooftops gives like 3%.

i keep seeing these swampletics memes but I haven‚Äôt played rs in ages, anyone care to explain what all this is about?
---
300 kc wtf
---
I actually really miss rev wildy. But I know I‚Äôm in the minority on that. I just really don‚Äôt like pvp content in osrs. 
---
Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescape's biggest challenges: the Theatre of Blood. 
---
Well I just downvoted this...so.....
---
My accounts and email were recently stolen and the hacker managed to actually change my passwords and get in. I was able to save them, thankfully, but my steam accounts email was changed, so i can't even recover my password. 
---
I haven't played RuneScape in months, but I downloaded the mobile version today and found out the guy did some shit and now my account is macro banned.
---
The rain is drowning it out
---
I thought it was hilarious
---
Golf mk6?
---
:( 
---
Big yes!
---
I‚Äôve always wanted the ability to build agility shortcuts in certain places with construction. Maybe use the shards for this to introduce new shortcuts?
---
I remember picking 1k flax back in the day when I was a kid and thinking fk this man that was torture 
---
Nice 
---
It‚Äôs not hard just really annoying. 
---
All of this Swampletics circlejerk for Karma is starting to get really tiring. 
---
Verf‚Äôs karamja UIM is really fun too. Definitely recommend checking it out if you haven‚Äôt already. 
---
I don't see why we don't hide poll results? Polling could be implemented like Strawpoll where the results are hidden until you vote in the poll yourself. 
---
I have massive respect for that, based op
---
oh god please don't
---
Is it possible to implement a warning when tryin to drop untradeble outfits like trawler‚Äôs outfit? I accidently dropped my outfit on mobile last week and I think this would be a useful feature!
---
I like mixing 2 colors. Legs and chest one color, cape boots gloves and hood another.
---
I‚Äôve seen purple + white and dark blue + yellow that look pretty good.
---
Are you a feministi lol? 
---
Sorry if I came off as rude.  I'm just trying to illustrate the point that information was out there.  They tried to notify people and are even going out of their way to fix it, there are only so many avenues they can take to notify.  From what I understand it was on the website, reddit, and Twitter, and maybe even FB?  Aside from putting the information in the game with a quiz for comprehension I don't see how they could force that information to be read.
---
It's unfortunate that it affect so many pures negatively, even if many do like the update. 
---
I use to be an Ultimate Ironman, but then i took a Swampletics to the knee
---
Nothing will change because we have too many ezscape players in the game now. 
---
However, to enforce the integrity of polling, there's no harm in actually doing it. 
---
Moreso RS2, This is very old. 
---
Jesus dude. I bet you thought this was gonna make the front page too. 
---
They say they're for Runescape 3. v

It‚Äôs alright, important that u understood ur mistake and learned from it

Attack jad with chinchompas when the healers come out to tag them
---
As a kid I'd waste hours there. 
---
I literally will go pull open a map via the internet on my phone over opening the map in game on my phone because it crashes so damn often.  Being able to see how to get from one point to another without the game crashing should be a priority.  It's pretty ridiculous this is still an issue 6 months after mobile release.  
---
A pretty good idea to me
---
I use my original log in from 2005 on osrs. So I guess yes they‚Äôre for rs3 but the account is on both games. 
---
ok but don't forget agility bad and slayer good
---
Here here!
---
Do your part. 
---
Make sure this stays in New.
---
Arguably I guess. I feel like it‚Äôs pretty basic, but I guess it‚Äôs based on one‚Äôs education level and or understanding. 
---
Yeah, grind Barrows Gloves. Just google something like quest progression barrows gloves. I found a google excel doc I've been picking away it. It has a good quest order and what skills you will need along the way. Super Helpful.
---
I am merely preaching the will of our savior.
---
Mate sort it out you cant just start off with a blue Cape get the red Cape on
---
We're waiting
---
I always make the front page.
---
Imagine not having 200m slayer
---
yea i love them
---
10-20% increase in xp &amp; runes per hour is not "QoL".
---
Bless you
---
That is an unknown fact
---
It honestly doesn‚Äôt matter the stuff is going to pass regardless. I don‚Äôt think hiding poll results will have any effect on the game at all. 
---
I‚Äôll make you stay in New.
---
oh fuck off
---
Can you please check if my account was hacked due to Mod Jed's actions? I was hacked for 6.3b about one year ago with circumstances equivalent to the other victims. I've had two reddit posts and never received a Jmod reply. My reddit post from 5 days ago that made it to the trending page also has comments of other players with their RSNs who had similar experiences.
---
For reference here they are:

RSN: "G P"
---
Thank you.
---
This is true. The polls could be compromised due to the nature of the game currently, which is a bigger problem in and of itself.
---
Imagine wasting money 
---
Again, how is saving 1-2 ticks per trip a 10 percent increase?
---
Polls should only pass when 75% want it to pass, not because people vote for it just cause it‚Äôs winning. Same applies to the opposite as people will often vote against something if they see it already losing. That‚Äôs why poll results should be hidden. 
---
I watched G4-TechTV back in the day and they did a segment on Attack of the Show I think for Runescape 2 launch. Made an account and got hooked
---
Found the guy that buys girls $100 worth of drinks and wonders why they still won't sleep with him

I vote 1 head per pet drop received

!remindme 4 hours
---
I was drawn to the normal ironman gamestyle because I was intrigued by the idea of being forced to use content that is effectively "dead" for regular accounts. 
---
UIM takes this idea and runs with it to the extreme. Not only is dead content now important, but entirely new and unique strategies must be developed to optimize the gameplay.
---
Settled takes UIM and puts a further spin on it -- he locks himself in Morytania, a region that has enough content to keep the series interesting but not enough that the progression is too easy. It's also exciting to know that he has a true endgame goal to work towards - the ToB.
---
Settled isn't unique in creating an interesting self-restricted account. There are a lot of content creators doing similar things right now. What sets Settled apart is that he truly understands how to be an entertainer. His videos show us the grinds he endures without making us feel like we're grinding it out with him. It doesn't jump so quick that I can't appreciate the struggle and doesn't move so slow that I can't get through the video. Every video has varied content; I know he'll be showing me more Temple Trekking, but I'm never sure exactly what he'll be working towards in the next vid. I had no idea last week's video would largely revolve around making a maple shortbow, but the goal felt important and necessary.
---
To build off that, Settled does an amazing job of outlining his thought process and showing me where he's taking the next goal. He doesn't jump around from target to target: "Oh I did this and then went and got that." I love that he takes the time to explain the progression one piece at a time. It feels like we're having a conversation, like I'm included in this behind-the-scenes creation. I really appreciate that.
---
Lastly, he's doing some really interesting stuff, at least from my viewpoint. I've been around this game since 2004ish, off and on. Knowing that the game isn't 100% solved (like with Settled finding new drops that weren't documented, etc.) is exciting and breathes an air of mystery into a game I feel like I knew inside and out for quite some time.
---
In short, he's an amazing entertainer putting out content I find interesting. I can't wait to watch his video every week and discuss it with a couple friends.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy it has not been addressed yet. Even cost me a death once since I accidentally tapped it and it crashed my game during a fight
---
Just image us users voting ourselves into what could be another rc... if its not at least 200k exp/hr im not about it
---
Piggybacking to see what the outcome is. Im' in the same boat.
---
Just another low life reddit troll huh? Get the fuck off my screen moron.
---
With prif getting a house portal (a decently high lv one at that) and it being home to skill challenges and upgrades i would like to see something added for construction. You see I love construction because i love seeing my one room shack turning into a magical mansion over time, but actually leveling the skill be a chore because smashing and rebuilding larders in an instance makes me feel less like a master builder and more like an oak fanatic with commitment issues. So i suggest some kind of mini game to help train construction in Prif. Maybe we can build crystal structures or use that Crystal tree to make crystal planks to repair something, or perhaps it could be tied into the wanted agility course where you "build" the course and change the course or increase your speed or something. The possibilities are endless and i know folk that are more creative then I can do better. 
---
TL;DR: Lets take construction out of the instance and lets add a social spin to it.
---
Nice, personally sitting at 1900 total with 0 99s lmao
---
Currently full recolored graceful at 68 agility and I always did the highest available rooftop course.
---
Method = WoW Guild that's true
---
He's streaming right now and just started playing today.
---
Just water under the fridge
---
Only for as long as you leave the client open
---
I feel like if it were to be hidden the % would certainly need to be lowered. It‚Äôd be hard to hit 80% without the sheep. 
---
It kinda doesn't tho?  If I were here for the game you could pretty much say I was behind my computer 100% of the time, since that's the game.  But I'm not.
---
What a swoley polley 
---
Please create a poll for this, Runecrafting is definitely the most monotonous skill to train. (ToG is personally the only bearable way). I don‚Äôt know a way to fix this skill without making people scream but something needs to be done or I will scream. RC is holding me back from diary rewards!!
---
Because he plays runescape lol
---
Can I bring my gf
---
I thought people did it to trigger people. 
---
They're not making articles about OSRS but there are plenty of articles about the dangers that can come from playing any MMO too much. Fortnite just gets articles because it's the biggest game right now. All video games have the risk of becoming addicting and interfering with your life. 
---
Imagine not knowing that you can basically come out even or with little loss bursting/barraging
---
Bring more maple logs!
---
I feel like we should have some kind of "Enhancing" net that yields untradable but better loot table implings so theres an actual reason to open some.
---
Oh I understand now. By Authenticator delay, I was assuming there was some sort of delay after authenticating. It's an authentication removal delay
---
Spells mostly consist of purely teleport and damage.
---
One freezes, another heals you, another one poisons, and last one lowers opponents attack lvl.
---
i'm indifferent about the safespot tbh.
---
The real threats are pvp clans in the wilderness. And the reason why people safespot them is due to them spamming their unblock-able +60 damage shit.
---
And tbh i'm kind of accustomed to safespotting Vet'ion. I think of it like fighting Rex and it's sort of more enjoyable.
---
people became more boring 
---
There are burglars in runescape? What do they take?
---
Depends on what streamers. If you watch pk streamers that brid many use autohotkeys that make it so they can‚Äôt drag items 
---
What are the chances we could be allowed to either have non-functional cosmetic versions of lower tier diary rewards ***or*** toggles for the tier of appearance that the diary reward uses (while maintaining their perks). I would personally prefer the latter but the former I imagine would be simpler to dev. 
---
Also QOL-not-QOL-month questions:
---
Why does the farmer who you pay for protection in the farming guild have extra lines of dialogue to protect plants instead of the usual right click options? 
---
Will we ever get some sort of PoH incorporated Dorgesh-Kaan teleport involved with Dorgesh-Kaan spheres ***and/or*** the ability to create spheres with noted molten glass? 
---
I can't stop; it's too addicting!
---
C
---
You‚Äôll be back
---
Personally I'd consider it scamming though I'd ask Ash myself to be sure.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get it to work, but I can‚Äôt link my GC account. It‚Äôs quite annoying this still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. 
---
Have you found a way to do it?
---
Ill repost it next time ok?
---
Ah man Im just joking ha
---
I'd imbue her ring
---
I laughed. IDK, didn't seem cringeworthy to me. Seemed funny and he obviously said it with intentions to post it here. You're browsing a sub for a children's Java based browser game, I don't think you're a good judge of what is and isn't cringeworthy my guy.
---
I see
---
Cool story sis
---
I‚Äôll be there not to win anything just to listen to some jokes 
---
Bad post
---
Lmfao "quiting the game cause i was stupid"
---
NSFW warning ^
---
"Crystal Butterfly Net":
---
* This would "Enhance" caught Implings. Enhanced Implings are untradable. Enhanced Implings would be the original impling but with alot of the less desirable loot on their loot tables removed (Again these caught implings are untradable so they cannot be sold).
---
* The point of this would be to add a reason to catch AND open impling jars in some capacity while also making implings something more interesting.

Stupid long horses

Holy shit how did Ash not know about this
---
Even with weeks of drama and criticism pre-release about how the necklace would be stupid op if it wasn‚Äôt a necklace, or that players wanted glory-stats added so they could still use a powerful necklace with the dragonbone effect
---
I‚Äôm absolutely blown away that Ash of all people seemingly forgot the entire point of the dragonbone necklace (or that this was the intention with the upgraded bonecrusher necklace all along, in which case it was never once mentioned when polling the upgrade)
---
wow u better sue him for all that money he's making off your oc

This is a dank format

My grandfather has been playing since about 05/06.  My cousin and I played a lot back then and he wanted to help us so he would stand in varrock or cammy merching feathers and would give us the gp he was able to make. Now that osrs is out, and me and my cousin are back into it, he's playing again. He was doing fletching for a while and is up to about 80 or so, then he was doing wc until around the same. His goal was to make gp like he did before, but he's bad at merching on the GE and feathers dont work, neither do the aforementioned skills. Since he doesnt like pvp/pvm either, I finally convinced him to start on one of the best skilling moneymakers: runecrafting. We'll see how it goes!
---
tl;dr by being born with a brain
---
Either way, its really weird the fact that the way to make an ironman on os and rs3 are different. Why not have them both be the same methods so people switching know whats going on. Or if at the end they forced the player to talk to Paul as the last person on tutorial island so that way everyone talks to Paul to be sure people wanna play the mode they are about to be stuck in.
---
at least you know how to raid and can rebuild, one twisted bow drop recovers everything basically.  goodluck man =/

Its a dragonstone necklace.... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Naw. This guys a genius. Completely showed her that he gives no fucks.

How deep is swampletics inserted in you?

Can I get this one without osrs logo? This is homescreen material

Why not?

Gold necklace with a dragonstone in it?

I suggest quests if you plan to be a long-term or permanent member. Quests will help you train easier, get you around easier, as well as give you access to more resources. 
---
Possible Method: Find important quests and prerequisites. Example: if planning to do Legend's Quest, find out what prerequisites you will need and work towards completing them. Do a few quests, take a break and train a skill or two for an evening or day, make a little money then get back onto grinding quests. Repeat this method or if you find another method more suitable for you, repeat it until you at least finish Recipe For Disaster. After completing RfD (Recipe For Disaster), you can then slow down on quests if you choose to and focus on money making and training your combat and skills further.
---
If you don't plan to be a long-term member, explore a little bit of member's content when you need a break (don't focus too hard on quests that will be useless in F2P) but focus more on leveling combat and skills (since methods in P2P tend to be faster and more efficient) while making money for when you go back to F2P.
---
In short: Just make good use of your time whether you continue membership in the future or not. But once you get membership for the first time, you'll more than likely not want to go back to F2P. Good luck! Need help, feel free to reply!

Username makes it worse

What‚Äôs so important about knowing what‚Äôs going on?

Different spells and many are capable of hitting targets in multiple squares in a single cast, so you can kill a bunch of dust devils at a time

Easy mode makes it so that you don't even actually get hit most of the time (Watch the vid, blue 0's are misses and don't affect your absorb, the red 0's are hits that were absorbed)

Mobile sucks for anything intensive. It's good for afking redwoods or nmz or something, not high effort skilling or pvming.

magpies and natures are both significantly better for getting a hard clue scroll than ninjas, since the math comes out to ~60k per hard clue for magpies and ~70k per nature, assuming regular rates of loot and the impling jar remaining intact, where ninjas make you spend about ~210k per hard clue. 
---
the osrs wiki has the estimations. maybe they're actually inaccurate, but i've been pretty happy with my results from doing natures and magpies over ~200 hard clues.

i know its not easy, but the hardest part of raids is learning them.  I'm going to assume that you can solo raids even in min gear at this point and then slowly progress your gear back while getting drops.  As someone who has had to deal with this before, the information you already know for pvm is more valuable then your current bank networth.

Go play rs3 if you want that feature.

now if i could actually get dust devils or nechs.. probably 5 levels dry on devils and ONE nech task during 80-82. are they really this rare?
