is it worth it to use regular void (non-elite version) as an attacker at barbarian assault? 
---
Too much work for such a small player-base imo
---
Where is it from? I used to see it a lot in old videos, but I never knew why
---
How?
---
that is op i must say, only if i had cash to train fletching this way
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I don't think I've ever cared for a person pking me while running a clue. Cos I could be charging glories or similar and look identical.
---
The people I hate are the ones who kill me while I'm on a clue, I drop the clue to not lose it and come back for it. For them to be waiting there to pk me again.. full well knowing they're spending more money than what I'm dropping. That's when it turns into griefing and not just killing someone for potential reward.
---
It's those people I call low skill. So bad at pking they have to go and kill people with no loot or weapons to feel good. Because the moment the other guy can fight back they aren't good enough to win.
---
:3
---
Yeah, there's actually a lot of time to just walk away from it. 
---
But muh special snowflake feelings. (‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•)
---
I already got my answers mate, don't care what reddit thinks of me lmao
---
And that is Basically the point. The pkers don't get anything from killing cluescrollers. It's just to waste time.
---
account support has not existed for runescape since release date.  
---
Wierd as it is,I havent got a single tweet reply back to some of my cases about my account which is sorted now although I sent many messages, do they pick people to reply randomly or is this a setup to show they have account support?
---
LMFAO
---
I do, but I remember in the old days you were able to select different graphical options via the official RuneScape client such as anti-aliasing. I'm just wondering why they don't officially support it anymore.
---
You could've avoided any problem by using the tools jagex provided and setting up the Auth, that's why they give you 20 reminders a day about it. And if you would've read my whole post you would've seen that I said jagex should've emailed you to make sure you wanted to change the email ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Auguste the hot air balloon guy haunts my dreams.
---
When you first make an account, t doesn‚Äôt set a registered e-mail (despite your login being an e-mail itself).
---
So presumably the hacker simply registered their own e-mail to the unregistered account.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people feel obligated to get them, even though they don‚Äôt really want to play the minigame. So if they can leech it, they will
---
kurask, basically a reskinned gorilla with horns
---
It's this logic that makes me understand killing easy targets to feel good. Because actual PvP is way more fun, but killing no geared players is easier and thus people do it for an easy rush.
---
But you also sound like the exact type of person that makes people complain. Enjoying annoying others isn't exactly a reciprocated kinda feeling, so as long as you leave it at the first kill and don't camp the corpse to grief them returning all the power to you. I don't understand how it's fun but I also grew up as a kid pking in edge and on low accounts at varrock, so I've never understood killing people who don't fight back.
---
Mini game teleports to get you close maybe? 
---
EOC is not the same as MTX, furthermore - apparently even with so many people leaving, the game somehow makes more than osrs, or hopefully used to at least. The problem with MTX is that too many people are okay with it as long as it isn't P2W, once they get fully used to it, then when start pulling this bullshit like rs3 does.
---
My whole point is that publishers push shit like this slowly, so that everyone wouldn't quit. The mentality behind it is - okay, it's just this one thing, it's not worth quitting over this, though I am very upset. After you calm down they pull this crap again and again and again until you have rs3.

Even when I click 'verify email' on the welcome message? If this is the case then you've definitely cracked why I was never notified and how they managed to change my email.
---
No, they need to change the way ranged levels effect combat level. Range should be treated the same as receiving an attack or strength level: .375 combat levels. But you could level attack and ranged to be the same level without gaining additional combat levels (the same way it currently works with ranged/magic). Then the strength stat should render the max hit of both melee and ranged.
---
A maxed ranged tank is 110 iirc with 99s all and atk/str x 1.5 &lt; 148. They have the same survivability as a main and can dish out the same amount of damage with ranged in it's current state.

He literally was developing a Runelite plugin on stream once and did so before Jagex took down the Runelite deobfuscator so the man has literally seen the client's code
---
If you're already actively trying to ruin the game for pkers because you cant laugh off the occasional getting attacked during fucking clue(having to endure danger for reward???) in which you lose absolutely nothing then you're just a petty prick and that's not gonna change.
---
It‚Äôs good xp
---
Nope, it isn't. I don't recall saying I *was* in favour of that. Something like adding the teasing stick for verf is a fairly minor transgression, but it's still pandering.
---
On the other hand, two wrongs don't make a right, and removing the requirements here would just cement that bad precedent. Each instance makes the next easier to push through on grounds of 'But those people got their thing, so we should too'.

Olmlet. 
---
Mammoths were added before we had dedicated artists. The olmlet was actually made by the art team. 
---
I have no idea how anyone could have looked at that thing and thought it was acceptable. 
---
I honestly though it was a placeholder model when it was first shown. 
---
The ava's is worth the 2 combats for the convenience, so either get 15 pray or 99 range. 
---
They are so god damn cheap. People pay 30m for tassets for +2 str, pay 30m for prims that give +2 s/s/c and +1 str, pay 120m for avernic for +5 s/s/c and +2 str; I think paying 8m for +4 s/s/c and +2 str is a steal!
---
&gt;  you would've seen that I said jagex should've emailed you to make sure you wanted to change the email 
---
You never said this originally. You asked who they should email, not that they should've emailed me. You added that as an edit after the fact, so I missed it. Apologies.
---
&gt; You could've avoided any problem by using the tools jagex provided  
---
Whilst true, does that really mean we should actively ignore these other concerns? Personally I'm not too fussed about the account, it's a low level and I could probably grind everything back in a couple days but I still find it deeply concerning that these other issues have been left unresolved for 10+ years.
---
God yes I do this every time now
---
&gt; it makes me really depressed knowing only maxed accounts can participate.
---
Well then rejoice, because today you learn that non-maxed accounts can stake too.

Those look like Graceful gloves. Probably just takes the fairy ring back to Zanaris.
---
They should have a way to contact them on runescape.com. No one understands how bad it is until they have a problem themselves and try to get help only to find customer support is nonexistent. Or at best a lottery.
---
But the spellbook icon thing was an update that affected both PvP and PvM. Why would you feel the need to "get back" at them for something like this when they just voted in their own interest? This update would have no effect whatsoever on PvMers, other than increasing the value of hard clue scrolls, how are they the same at all?
---
I concur with this point. I was questing like mad that day and having to wait for the stupid courier was a pain. Took like 3hrs iirc.
---
They‚Äôre not scaled in anyway though, a clue with just fairy ring codes is worth as much as one that sends you all over the place 
---
They won't vote in favor of it. If they were any good at pking they would be fighting other skilled pkers, not the pvmers forced to be there.
---
Yeh I'm often too lazy to bother cos if I lose the clue it's not that big a deal.
---
Then I like you :)

It could be slower than 5 ticks on startup. Say 8 ticks and resets on new target/dif wep/pray pot sip/eating.

Yea I also hate this, catches me all the time. I‚Äôm just typing my usual ‚ÄúOsrs dad on son‚Äù and then halfway through I realize my mistake 
---
What?? No way of getting out??? There is proper protection. 
---
1 skill? No. You need to level mage to up magic defence, you need to level defense to up melle and ranged def and to wear better gear, you need to level hp to you know... Have hp, you need to level prayer for obvious reasons, you need to level ranged in order to wear better magic protection gear.

You can look up search topics rather than search terms. It will include in the search anything wow related and anything RS related. So if you searched "tears of guthix" or runehq that'd be included in both RS3 and OSRS. Similarly if you searched BFA or Legion or Wowhead or a specific wow quest, they'd be included in wow.
---
When you do that, [here are the results](https://i.imgur.com/HJ8vj7o.png).

Yeah I was hoping I‚Äôd be able to try out the grotesque guardians.. haven‚Äôt done them yet and it sounds like a tricky fight for a first timer.

Can someone explain why every single stream he does says "last stream"? Is it some inside joke?

tell that to the guy i killed who had is 10m cashstack on him lmao
---
It's not a cycle. The resizeable spells affected both communities, it's not as if pkers voted no to something that only affected pvm, or only affected ironman, out of spite, but that's exactly what happens every time something like this is polled.
---
Funny enough: they used to do this. It didn‚Äôt end very well for their game. It lead to the entire existence of Old School Runecape in the first place. That is the exact reason why OSRS has only been growing, because they *don‚Äôt* make these decisions without our approval.

Oh, you're actually this retarded. Incredible.

When you have 6 jads hitting you the sounds are all jumbled up with the sounds of your pray flicking and eating and attacking. Additionally two of them might attack at the same time and play two sounds at the same time. This could potentially make it hard to discern what you just heard.
---
If you knew even the basics of jad you would know that his attacks all have a wind up animation associated with them that occurs at the same time as the sound. So if you were unsure you could just look to see what attack he will use.
---
Now suck my ass.

Without wanting to sound picky. I noticed some pots ingredients are on 1 line where as others have the secondary on the bottom. Maybe could choose 1 format.

Lmao these were actually all the points I had in mind while making the video so i‚Äôm glad those points were hit. Hoping future guides will be just as funny, informative, and short like this one. Thanks for the view and much love my man!

why does he have a glory and a stack of coins with him? don't pretend like you're getting anything other than bones lmao

Hope you enjoy my sloppy seconds.
---
Why would you hate on pkers for this...? You voted the wildy PvMing content into the game knowing the consequences of being in the wild. If you can‚Äôt handle PvP then stick to afking Bandos for 3 hours. 
---
Also, the wild has never been fair. There‚Äôs always going to be someone with better gear, better stats, and better skill. That‚Äôs always been the case in a Player vs Player game, be it RS, Fortnite, CoD, PUBG, etc. 
---
Not doing what is necessary to survive and then crying when you die is such a cop out. 
---
A minority of pkers kill you to piss you off, while the majority kill for fun/loot. 
---
So all pking is bad

Nothing stopping you, but it doesn't scale down as much as you'd want. Lvl 62 will get creamed at olm

&gt;Generalizing everyone into the 'toxic group' is also mornic.
---
toxic behavior is not exclusive to a group, you idiot; its universal.
---
&gt;Also, your assessment of if "what has this to do with anything" is moronic; things go wrong for the KKK and similar groups due to their toxicity.
---
and again, its not relevant because toxicity is not exclusive to a certain group. things go wrong for failures like you who never pursue an education past high school too, but that doesnt mean we can use that as a basis to make unsubstantiated statements like the comment i responded to. 
---
I'm not currently playing osrs but before I left around 3 months ago I was trying out deep wildy pking in various areas. I sucked so bad, even though I'm a max combat main pures could easily handle me. Trust me I spent 100x more time fearing pkers than being a pker.   
---
Anyways, I think the dude is totally right. That is the cycle of the wild. If you think pkere should fight with pkers there is bh there is duel arena there are minigames there are every kind of different activities for pvp but wilderness is a unique one of them, it has uses for non pkers too, and that is what makes wilderness the wilderness.   
---
I wouldn't say pvmers have to pay for being bad at pking to this, I would say pvmers are missing the opportunity to not trying out to being a pker in wilderness.

Id say make the cage key drop rate 1/100 not 1/20, too easy to get one then, and the drops they give would cost less.

Would also be nice if logging into these worlds it didnt reset all you game settings each time, like left click attack and transparent chat.

You misspelled "misspelled"

That‚Äôs pretty bad

Pretty sure most of the time everyone runecrafts once a week with ToG lol. Until they finally decide to go for that 77 grind for Bloods.

Due to your awful grammar, I cannot honestly tell, but I think you just tried to say that I did not pursue education past high school. Again, an unbased assumption, which you seem to be full of.
---
OSRS mobile does not support mice. 
---
I just looked it up - they're tournament worlds with free items, maxed stats, all achievements and quests done
---
Aren't you just over the drop rate by like 100 because you need 1,000 kills registered for the Elite reward which includes the ability to get the pet in the first place...?

Yah but he would have had to know ahead of time that that there were no offers &gt;1gp or else he'd be taking a big risk. If someone had an offer in for 2gp they would have got the boots. Maybe if he was the one that originally tried to sell the boots for 1gp, then when they didn't sell decided to buy them himself.

id appreciate it if high school dropouts such as yourself didnt mention grammar. we both know you wouldnt be able to address any matter about a topic regarding grammar.

You should‚Äôve gone for the heaaaad.....

Why did you post a photo of the poll instead of linking the poll?

Yeah bro + farm cape
---
Any guide suggestions btw?
---
You get 5 pts per dmg 115-126 avg combat. 4 at 114 and below, 3 at some point as well.
---
Per account you get diminishing points per. 30k-24k-21k for solos duos trios. 4-7mans are around 20k and it decays from there. 
---
What you said about really big scales isnt true. Big raids the points per min drop hard for a bunch of reasons. Crossbow sucks compared to blowpipe, also monsters defense goes up in large scales.
---
Solos are the best points per hour unless you do alt raids with alts that do more than prep (help dps combat rooms). 3-4 mans w one alt that just preps are worse but not by much.

Maybe change worlds after the 2nd time. Put your private to friends/off and they won‚Äôt be able to tell which world you went too. Easy way to avoid getting griefed. Though I definitely understand your frustration and I agree it‚Äôs kinda toxic when people do this shit for ‚Äúfun‚Äù.
---
I agree with this post, but I don't think the problems with the wilderness are pkers or pvmers fault. It's jagex's fault for their sad attempt to "revive" pking only by pushing non-pkers into the wild with updates that give incentives to make money/do clues. And a lot of the updates are actually awesome and bring more people in, but they have to do something different if they want to make a real change because there's clearly a big division between pkers and pvmers. Compared to back in the day when I feel like there was no division and people went in the wild because they wanted to, not because they felt forced to

You‚Äôre a whiney little bitch who doesn‚Äôt understand core mechanics of the game that have been around since before rs2 was even a thing.

There are realistic means that aren't as egregious as what he did. Granted, it's impossible without leaving the area to an extent - he would have to do Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl for Horror From the Deep.
---
However, that quest is Fremennik-based, and the miniquest is purely talking to NPCs and gives no rewards.
---
There may be other ways to get a fishing net or harpoon that we don't know as well.

On top of all that, it would be less egregious still if he had allowed himself a single small fishing net to get 76 since he is now able to purchase everything from the store he got to anyway.

&gt;The final concern I have is that in the last 24 hours I have seen a large number of posts reporting that they had been hacked in a similar fashion.

Pkers try to use mage on a guy with full anti-mage gear and and protect from mage on then cry for nerfs when it isn't effective. They probably also got upset when their Charmander struggled against Squirtle.

Its natural human attraction..bloody normal instincts for god sakes. Not sure why you're so SJW about me saying every dude playing osrs would sleep with her. Jesus Christ man, loosen up the fuckin feminism over there. Nothing wrong with natural human wants/instincts. Im sure you find pornography offensive and disgusting too right? (Nothing wrong with that, your opinion. Just trying to get a read as to why you're knighting so hard)
---
Fun fact, a t bow is worth about 3,000 USD in bonds. 
---
Damn that sucks man, sorry.
---
The pker is guarding the scroll still, he dropped it on the ground before dying, that isn't going to move worlds with him
---
This is an unnecessary unnatural step towards ezscape, so much so that I cant tell if this is genuine suggestion or just a classic meme of stackable rune essence. 
---
lol i saw ur rc levels, hacked
---
I grind those capes because I use em for singles pking, I've only been attacked once in about 20 capes and they were just Venezuelan-esque pkers who were just so bad, I escaped through 14+ wildy levels in multi. Even if I were to die, all I would lose is 60 blood runes and a dhide set. The point being, it's rare to get attacked and if you do die, it's sub 50k. No need to be so scared of the wildy lmao
---
Precisely this. Big difference in the wording. Saying you would sleep with someone is a more direct way of saying they are very attractive. Its also the fucking internet..obviously I dont go around telling every attractive woman i see "hey id tap that" but good lord this is Reddit. The white knights/sjws here..the fuck 
---
I fit in well there 
---
Shaggy = lynx titan
---
I am an engineer student so i love nerd stuff like this.  And I sort by new because I like seeing what everyone has to say.  Keeps doing cool stuff!
---
At least weapon poison works like real-world venom therefore it's probably safe to digest.
---
Thanks for the support! 
---
The way you spend 99.9% of the time just running back and forward seems broken to me, i think were RC to be added into the game today  it would be completely different to what we currently have
---
Still a better idea for a restricted ironman that A Friend's joke of a cash grab "series".
---
Better than Underground ~~only~~ sometimes ironman too, because you actually stick to your restrictions by the looks of it.
---
Do you know how to do this for iOS? Guzzling Rock cakes in NMZ is cancer
---
The only people who get ess from mining it are extremely low level irons. Rc is abysmal without energy potions/staminas so wait a bit until you‚Äôre more established (assuming you‚Äôre an iron). 
---
 Its not a good thing that theres a resource almost exclusively brought in by monster drops, but the purpose was to combat bots. 
---
I think they should just half the str bonus and give it double hits. That would be awesome.
---
There's a big difference between making exp rates like RS3 ("EZscape") and buff shitty skills that have abysmal exp rates so they're more in line with other skills. This whole "anything that makes anything even remotely less awful is EZSCAPE" mindset that half of this sub has is completely counterintuitive and serves only to preserve "MUH NOSTALGIA".
---
I care
---
It probably would increase the amount of runes coming in to the game as more people would be runecrafting, however to what extent are rune prices fixed by the rune store price?
---
Completing** 
---
But I like the idea! 
---
Just left a three hour bandos trip in a US world, dunno what you‚Äôre talking about 
---
Yeah, definitely rings a bell!
---
The PKing community single handedly gave us this game.
---
Yes, Dragon armour is cosmetic
---
No fix. Only bad.
---
I don't get it.
---
I mean... trying to trade 10m beer glasses on sythe for gp doesn't violate the tos.
---
The only place you'll consistently run into people is chins, 44s, chaos altar and rev caves and sometimes lava drags. (Mage Bank is so dead) 
---
Any idea how much easier it would be with a twisted bow? Been thinking about saving for one and didn't really consider trying without it, but maybe it's doable
---
Nah lol
---
True
---
Damn that's nice. ( for me at least )
---
That's a stretch mate
---
Why stop there? Make all agility courses 1 click action but keep the xp/h the same so it's balanced. Also make mining ores stackable but the xp/h will remain the same so it's fine.  
---
In fact just make every resource stackable but keep the xp/h the same so people won't cry ezscape
---
No, they have stated that training fletching via touch is not bannable, using the zoom function is a phone function, in no way is it bannable 
---
Well forget making spells bigger then fuck
---
G I M M E T H E L O O S E
---
I mean the clue is forcing me to go into the wildy. I would be fine with it if I opted into getting wilderness clues for greater reward(like wilderness slayer). Or a system that I could trade in a wilderness clue for a different clue but it added 1 step to the clue scroll. 
---
There's really no way you're just going to go in and start soloing raids. I'd say get at least 150-300 kc with a team before even attempting to solo otherwise you won't know how to deal with anything in cox. No amount of youtube guides is going to prepare you for solo olm, or even some of the normal rooms, solo tekt alone can drag on for 10+ minutes and you can't really mess up too many clicks. 
---
Make it like tears of guthix where doing a mini game gives xp to the lowest skill.. you can only get this reward once a rotation.  Gives a way to get rcing xp, and revives minigames
---
Oh noooooo
---
Oh sick, you can instateleport after buying an item to do so, legitimately didn't know about that. I guess you could also use runes to do so though....and neither of those are free so I'm not sure what you're trying to get at with that point. 
---
Secondly, "you're an idiot" if you think that being able to teleport to major areas will somehow make people not want to be able to teleport everywhere else in the game or have an ornate pool. 
---
I'm not going to start carrying around skills necklaces in the bank to get to the woodcutting guild or a games necklace to repeatedly get to corp, while not spec regening. 
---
FUCK RS3 SHIT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE except it would change absolutely nothing because they don't give the most useful teleports or regen all of your stats.
---
Tithe is actually enjoyable in a sort of meditative way, you can get into a real groove doing it haha
---
What are you talking about? Design is more important to get right as it is easier to rework rewards or their benefits than the mechanics. 
---
I don't think every skill needs to be afk. There should definitely be a spectrum of how "grindy" skills are.
---
Players that runecraft currently should definitely be rewarded because RC is definitely one of the grindier skills.
---
If you don't enjoy the skill, you don't have to do it. Runes are tradable. Even as an Ironman, you can get runes without runecrafting.
---
.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Oh nooooooo :(
---
Would probably also devalue tears of Guthix too, damn :/
---
Solid RC level by the way!
---
It does take a small incentive away, but by and large would not affect the usefulness of a max house and all of the teleports + other perks provided.
---
Should‚Äôve shown someone pickpocketing when Travis says gimme me the loot
---
Yeah I know haha, I just remember everyone had theories that it was all staged
---
....well if they community wants it? :P
---
Haha that would be a cool idea! Maybe one for the future, nice progress lad 
---
You don‚Äôt *need* to finish the clue. No one is forcing you to do anything. 
---
Oh shit I think I remember you from the forums, I was Lugia if that rings a bell
---
Your quicker then my one buddy. Couldn‚Äôt really keep up so I saw no problem ü§£üòÇü§£
---
Their\* and Accommodate \*
---
Your argument is as weak as your spelling LMFAO.
---
Lmao gay
---
Expanding on your point, Oldschool Runescape players are mostly in their mid-20s (I'll hazard this guess), people who for the most part are familiar with the ins and outs of tick manipulation and cornering an escaping target, plus incredible reflexes (literally) when switching gear.
---
Considering the fact that the playerbase has shrunk considerably since 2005-2007, I'd say today's wildy is encounter-for-encounter far more dangerous than back then even.
---
Gold amulet I mean 
---
It's a self-contained activity with unique items and interactions that aren't anywhere else in the game, I'd say that makes it a minigame
---
You do realise the pures that can fight mid level/high level accounts are playing with high level stats, you could also just get your mage range up to an okay level and be fine. If you're going into the wildy with 60 mage/range and some average melee combat stats you don't even have the stats to do some of the most basic wildy content. Trying to fight any player below 85/85 mage range you may as well be on f2p.
---
Pures aren't gate keeping you from the wildy your own confidence or low offensive stats are, also if you see a dot just hop/log/tele (under 30 wildy) if you don't wish to fight or tank your way out. 
---
Usually 2-4 at once it depends on the day. Atleast 2 at a time tho. No xp waste
---
Turbo Negro is a good band. I think Jackass really liked them for their song "all my friends are dead" . Grow up dude.
---
Why are you so over sensitive that this offends you and you feel the need to repost and bash him on the internet?
---
the blessed coif is like 4 times better than regular coif, thats big boost 
---
They kill you for fun and for the chance at high loot.
---
Thats how I know you don't pk. Pvp fights are rarely profitable, but being semi-decent at pking pvmers is profitable.
---
So you‚Äôve only played for 11 years off and on lol, theres many with more time who haven‚Äôt gotten a fire cape, including me. But forget all that, 23 with a wife and a house? You got the irl fire cape my friend.
---
could put actual farmland in the empty spaces, with farmer npcs walking around digging
---
I am. That's what mobile means.
---
Tassets is easier to get tbh than shouldering stone from hellhounds
---
Hmm ,red key ,blue key ,green key ? Blue being higher chance for good loot n Slayer XP while red n green being lowest . I can appreciate that more ,and yeah this was complicated, keys simplify it alot.more 
---
It's clearly against the subreddit's rules to accuse other players of wrongdoing.
---
Just waiting on youuuuuu
---
I wouldn't say I have a vendetta, just a less than positive opinion.
---
95m mate, loot tracker maxes out at 65k
---
I like his guides because they walk you through the whole thing, no need to pause the video, in a few quest I practically only had to listen to him and I followed along great. He messes up a few times which pisses me off but often makes for a funny moment. I enjoy them, if you aren‚Äôt looking for efficiency they are perfect.
---
Couldn't this also work on Windows with the Magnifier tool?
---
Lucky jagex doesn‚Äôt allow me to use symbols in my password and isn‚Äôt even case sensitive. Or I would probably use the same pass as my email. 
---
Or just 1 type of key. Higher level slayer monsters could drop them more often and lower level ones less frequently. They could keep the current drop table or change it and add a small amount if slayer xp
---
I mean I would say yes but is it going to give you carpel tunnel?
---
Talking about how great my little pony online is. 
---
Tell me your secret
---
season that chicken!
---
No keyboard and mouse. That‚Äôs what mobile means.
---
Even assholes don't deserve to die for it.
---
BDE
---
Lmao
---
I'm sure they make a difference when fighting void rangers and zerkers though, and since you're not sure who you'll be fighting it's best to take them anyway given how cheap they are. 
---
Does this shop have a stamp card program?
---
Relax cc. Great cc, they have a discord page stop on by :). They host learner raids and theater of blood
---
i have these daggers, blurite sword, silver necklace, green ghost-speak amulet.  totes keeping quest items you cant reobtain is my fetish.
---
At least we have the Grand Exchange, items' ability to hold their value is more dependent on their usefulness to other players than anything.
---
None that I can think of.
---
Might wanna change the font to be more readable especially from a distance. Just a nitpick thing. 
---
This had to be made. The internet is a better place because of it.
---
Doing Saradomin's work.
---
Why would you need noted food to fight?
---
6 total accounts. Usually play on 3 at a time. 1 at a time if pking. 4 of those accounts are pk builds. 2 are NMZ prods that make money when I‚Äôm focusing on bettering one of the pk builds. 
---
You can‚Äôt get banned for pking on multiple accounts. 
---
Hmm, you say it would be the same xp/hr with these changes, but because theses changes might make me runecrafting, the xp/hour goes from 0/hr, to xp/hr, which I think ruin your argument. Haha.
---
okay thank you i wasnt sure if there was a specific format or anything so just wanted to check
---
probably is
---
This is one of the most retarded thing I've seen this sub upvote. 
---
But Ppusiwt is? 
---
That happened a long time ago, People didn't like it. Player protests happened...
---
didn't read lol
---
After I put a stamina pool in my POH, Abyss runs became the most enjoyable thing in the game - I went from early 60s to 77 in a matter of weeks
---
I‚Äôve gotten 2 of them lol. You‚Äôre just unlucky
---
fortnite is free too
---
i have karamja hard now but before i had it when i went to do a shilo clue or get a slay task i would absolutely click-&gt;all pull my cash stack instead of having to do click-&gt;X-&gt;230-&gt;enter when i run ardy to hajedy
---
as far as not banking coins when youre at the ge, he never said people do it all the time, the point was that sometimes you accidentally forget to put something away and then lose it in wildy
---
i have a friend who lost his firecape like that, the fuckin dummy
---
Try a 2 finger touch and drag? You should do it the same way I would think
---
Their mage attacks are pretty strong and most likely what was hitting you hardest. Mith drags and above it's best to pray mage in melee gear.
---
I use Karils top and bottom, pray range and eagle eye, using diamond bolts.
---
Didn't say he deserved to die, said who cares why he hasn't posted. Pretty far stretch to assume he's dead/committed suicide.
---
the zammy brew and sara brew are missing.
---
Naw b you just gotta do barrows the quest takes like 2000 hours so doing barrows is worth it to get the GOD gloves
---
being at a high latitude does not make you immune to forgetting to bank your shit
---
Pretty much grandfathered in. Andrew Gower was always purported to dislike the fact that pures existed, and there were numerous times in the history of the game where they intentionally patched certain types of pures (plate-pures, for example), but after the Gower brothers gave up control, update like that didn't really happen anymore.
---
Thanks dude :). Here are my thoughts on what should be done. It's a long one
---
The current methods of RuneCrafting should be retained as a way of creating Runes as a money maker. End game RC GP/h is about 1 mill/hour.
---
For better XP/h, the following should be considered:
---
RuneCrafting Masters. RuneCrafting should have masters like Slayer. Slayer masters give assignments for things to be slayed, give points that are traded for items and teach you certain abilities with enough points to speed up tasks. In addition, Slayer is one of the most engaging skills in the game because it breaks down the skill into smaller easier steps to accomplish, presents many different rewards to players to choose from and makes you explore the map. 
---
So why not have RuneCrafting masters make you go to person X, or place Y or kill target Z to collect resources for the RuneCrafting master? For the sake of lore, he/she would use the materials gathered to experiment with and to create new RuneCrafting items. This would further his research in RuneCrafting. After doing so, he'd give you a tome for RuneCrafting XP that shares his research. While on the task you'd get some RuneCrafting experience for talking to a person, going and collecting a resources, etc. 
---
So, it could be like a skilling alternative to Slayer where instead of solely relying on combat skills to slay ,  other skills would be used to gather resources along with combat. Combat skills would be used with Combat related Runes (IE-- Killing Lava Dragons for a Wrath Rune related tasks) or mining Clay for Earth Rune related tasks. 
---
By doing these tasks, you'd be given a very small reward of Runes, but would get points that could be spent on gear. Some gear could be sets of items that give XP bonuses while RuneCrafting, rings that teleport to areas where tasks are commonly done for gathering resources, and others could SLIGHTLY increase the drop rate of items within a particular area to speed up XP rates when gathering resources.
---
this would make it more afk. rc is not supposed to be afk, especially lavas/doing natures. zmi and blood/souls are something else.they are pat afk, vs the rest is running. i do see your point, and as much as id approve of it, it would change the skill completely, and thats why im against it. 
---
Its the scythe.
---
‚ÄúIn a matter of weeks‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why that made me laugh so hard
---
CSGO got 500k players and barely has any viewers, twitch viewership doesn't really mean that much
---
That's really cool! Could you make it work with [something like this?](https://dimple.io/)
---
Or even better, a [BlackBerry Key2](https://www.amazon.com/BlackBerry-Key2-BBF100-6-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B07FSZGFFG/ref=asc_df_B07FSZGFFG/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=250190711216&amp;hvpos=1o2&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11990801886889415681&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007461&amp;hvtargid=pla-524330638214&amp;psc=1) with the physical keyboard?
---
The Android one seems to inject a 0.5s delay into the taps :(
---
Two in the goo,
---
One in the poo.
---
Dbek
---
Great idea! I really like this! 
---
You should really put this into a suggestion post, I think it would get a lot of support! :D
---
Il have to give that a try sometime! Maby it will change my perception of RC :P
---
It matters in wave 10 where the queen is dabbing on everyone at once. 
---
It can be useful 
---
This is really cool! Could you do this with phone dimples?
---
Or a BlackBerry Key2 using the physical keyboard?
---
I tried linking the two products but for some reason my comment is auto deleted when I do. 
---
You should generally never be getting hit by either prime or supreme in a rex safespot.  For gear i just take a ranged top, melee leggings, slay helm, blowpipe, and pegs since prime takes the longest for me to kill.  I also bring a melee top swap when i'm not killing prime since the spinolpys roll both their attacks off of ranged def.  I kill all 3, so this might not be helpful, but i bring blood blitz as well as trident for rex, for if i ever need to heal more than my blowpipe and bass drops can sustain.  This means your trip generally lasts as long as your ppots and other boosting pots (only range really help, but imbued heart is nice here too).
---
You want tips on the rex safespot though.  It'd be ideal to go down the ladder and simply walk along the east side of the area and neither attack you.  This isn't going to be common though.  It'd be best if you can just kill supreme and prime real fast to start up your safespotting.  If you only aggro 1 of supreme or prime, you can walk to the safespot (either deal with rex during this time or have him not be close).  There you can X-log while your prayer is up.  This will force your character to log out after about 30s or 1 minute of it not receiving data from your client, even if you're in combat, you will still be logged out.  After that, you should be able to log in and are now too far to aggro supreme or prime yourself.  
---
This guy gets it
---
Early on it was the best melee armor set for anywhere you'd be taking damage. The alternative was d legs and a torso
---
You mean people were stupid enough to get scammed with a warning message. No different from the wilderness honestly.

Use runelite and it's super easy

Yeah. But if you don't having lightning fast reflexes and precision aim. Then you ain't gonna get jack shit you stupid ass hat clown. So don't come to Reddit and complain and bitch.

I never said mobile didn't attract new players. I played mobile exclusive and my friends started.

Fuck off with your stupid wingey cringey assumption

I started playing 4 days ago, whatever this means, you've inspired me to do it. 
---
See ya in 11 years.
---
Today I did a slayer task on earth warriors and got PKed when I had 1 earth warrior left. All I could do was say ‚ÄúRIP‚Äù and laugh. I saw the dude log in skulled when I had 2 left, I thought ‚Äúif I can just quickly attack the next one I can just tele out.‚Äù Dude just destroyed me in like 4 hits bc I was risky with my health 
---
only quads can defeat him
---
that's why reporting does nothing
---
Looks dank
---
Now they‚Äôre gonna nerf that and say it‚Äôs not okay and rubelite will drop a plug-in for it no big deal.
---
See, but if PKers disappeared completely, the area would be filled with people, literally flooded. PKers are the reason PKing is dead
---
Fair shout
---
The only wildy clues that require you to carry more than 4 items are master clues that have you fight brassican mage/ancient wizards.
---
Yepppp
---
It's a bit ridiculous.
---
Three of them are protected, too.
---
Runecrafting slow fix plz
---
?
---
Why should using protect from magic not protect you in some way from magic? 
---
pkers are actually just retards, would you vote to give kids with aspergers prostitutes to bang?
---
What are u using to make ur health and prayer like that on the side of ur INV?
---
Just returned to the game today, after being afk for a while. So I was just wondering if anyone could update me on some of the crucial things that has happened since Dragon Slayer 2, which I quit before. I spent all my bank on prayer, crafting and construction and was wondering if there is any dailies apart from herb farming I should be doing to rebuild.
---
Because fun only starts when you max and own all the gear in the game. And I find playing efficient to be the most fun 
---
Zulrah much higher now that serpentine is like 6m and blowpipe also?
---
Either you completely misworded your first comment or you have no clue what he just said. He said pures destroy mains in fights when they are the same level. You said pures are only hoping for the chance to kill a main.
---
What do you mean? I use the controller to DJ and there‚Äôs no need to use the trackpad while DJing unless you want to search for a track. 
---
Better players will focus more whilst training it, travel to and from the altars more effectively and re-supply more quickly, the devs could probably build in a method to give the more hands on players a bit of a boost too
---
Killed like 100 steel dragons before realizing I had a black dragon task
---
Now you're not even making sense. I mean, at least I understand how basic pvm and bossing works. 
---
Searching for a track is all DJs do though? I've already agreed with the other guy that it looks cool don't be defensive now I don't own a club. 
---
But if 90% of your time is spent jerking off at the altar, shaving 1 tick off your bank time isn't going to do much.
---
It's a runelite plugin. Install runelite, and press the wrench in the top right. I don't remember what it's called, i was basically just going through them one at a time to see what they did
---
Do the boss, it's slow but you practice switches with gear and prayers. You will profit too and one of best pets in game :) if you get burnt out jst finish task at regular gargs then come back next task
---
Just learn it solo like me. Use synqs guide
---
So farming gets a slayer like update and now rc needs one?
---
Guess I know what I‚Äôm doing tonight lol 
---
You don't know that until it happens. Who's to say some fanatical information hoarding alien civilization doesn't record everything and upload it to the omniverse in the future?
---
As an advocate of a lot of the changes that have come to OSRS since it's release, this is something I would most definitely vote against. Runecrafting is a unique skill and isn't meant to be fast, and even though bossing is far superior for money making you can still make good money with little effort once you hit 82. Just because it's slow if you're not doing ZMI with runners doesn't mean it should be changed, hell, agility is literally all running..
---
shouldve had blue dragon mask
---
He didn't ruin his method, this happens often with items where you can make a shit ton very quickly but then it's gone.
---
except there are plenty of videos showcasing pkers killing someone who look like they had nothing and they end up bringing their bank with them. If your a pker, who keep in mind is already often looking for a long time for someone to kill, why would you not kill the unarmed player who takes no time to kill? 
---
I guess he finally shut up.
---
Got my kbd pet at 54, just got my spider pet at 65 AMA
---
I watched it live on stream but someone posted a short clip of it. It took over 40 mins
---
You‚Äôre PussyNigga#1
---
What's does op mean?
---
CSGO just went free. The 2 most popular streaming games started free (fortnite kinda). If SoT goes free and adds buyable cosmetics it compete with LoL and Fortnite imo.
---
Got skotizio pet. Decided to say fuck it right after and do Vorkath for some money, got Vorkath pet 2 kills in.  crazy RNG
---
It would be spot on, only you would have to empirically measure that at every level that the fish you are able to catch changes which means you would have to go from level 48 to 70 in order to get those points and then also to 99 to get the end point which by my calculation would take about 228 hours that I dont want to spend like that. That's what math and programming are for! Also, that would not be an average leveling path, that would be one rout where as another rout will be slightly different in rates. This code gives the expected rates and leveling paths, not just one of them. 
---
No, searching is not all that DJ‚Äôs do. . Matching BPM &amp; key allows you to you mash songs together to shorten each track which allows you to play more tracks than just playing whole songs. Not being defensive I just don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs in question lol
---
I tend to run pretty light so I could probably make a full lap of the tunnel even completely drained
---
even so thats still insane, you expect starting players to pay 10k+ for a mithril scim?
---
I read somewhere that you aren't technically dry if you are 5000kc for a pet is this statistically true?
---
Bro chill out I don't even know any club owners your secret is safe with me
---
Thats how people told me it works too. Explain? 
---
i think the reason they didn't put inferno in the first place is so it retains its difficulty
---
I‚Äôm chill I just got payed to get drunk &amp; play runescape

That‚Äôs just plain not true. The only way to contact Jagex directly is Twitter. Their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù page is just a bunch of useless FAQ‚Äôs and info pages.

Overpowered

Beavis should have a glory around his neck.
---
seriously, is there a way i can have this made into a poster?

It doesn‚Äôt destroy his game though
---
It destroys theirs

50/50 then
---
!
---
When you realise screenshots exist
---
Yeah why can‚Äôt it just snow in the wilderness instead so all the snowflakes don‚Äôt feel so alone
---
I can't imagine being so upset over a non insult like druggy apologist that I would have to post about it multiple times and hate someone over it.
---
I'm referring to where you said:
---
&gt;no matter what he says, even if it happens to be meaningful or pertinent to the topic at hand.
---
That's an untrue statement 
---
Yeah man once I get past level 60 anything I'm lost. Just found out I'm at a level to do Barrows but I have no idea what it is lol. Sounds intimidating.

I wrestled in high school and once we lost a match by default because one of our guys stuffed his singlet with toilet paper to make it look like he had a massive bulge and came out on the mat to wrestle like that. The ref gave 6 points to the other school and he was benched next meet.
---
OP didn't say to make Runecrafting faster in the post. The post specifically says to keep xp/h the same. They want the player character to spend more time actually Runecrafting instead of running.
---
Of course Agility is all running. It's Agility... that's the point. Which is the reasoning behind OP's suggestion to have the player spend more time Runecrafting.
---
Did you get pkd often? Safe spot it?
---
If you notice, the only time in this clip he almost messed up the barrage was when he missclicked a few millimeters to the left of the barrage icon. If the barrage icon was bigger there would be no need to precisely aim your mouse after switching your items and any average person would be able to instant barrage this easily 
---
Yes it's shit. Apparently he's fremmy only but he needed a raw shark so he did restless ghost and priest in peril so he could go to canafis and buy one lmao
---
Man I'm glad people still remember RS06 (2006Scape) good times on the forums and IRC chat.

Yeah, it's 2007 now. Get with the times OP!

Did you take a picture of your phone, and then screenshot that picture?
---
Also what are we trying to look for here. I like to think I'm decent at these hidden puzzles but you have me stumped.
---
Because the ones actually PKing for something are the minority and the overwhelming majority are just toxic shitbirds harassing you to harass you.

Well some medium/large updates include [Raids 2](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Theatre_of_Blood), a new [quest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Making_Friends_with_My_Arm) which involves a new herb patch, [OSRS Mobile](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Old_School_RuneScape_Mobile) full launch, the [portal nexus](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Portal_Nexus), the [collection log](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Collection_log), and the [Kebos Lowlands](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kebos_Lowlands) which has the [farming guild](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming_Guild) and a new [slayer master](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten) and much more.

---
If you want to rebuild in passive ways such as farm runs I'd suggest doing [Miscellania](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Miscellania#Managing_your_kingdom), [Bird houses](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hunter#Bird_house_trapping), and varrock [achievement diarys](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Varrock_Diary) if possible. Here's a [huge list](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide#Hourly_profit_table) of money making methods provided by the wiki.

Thanks for the red circle, couldn't tell what I was supposed to be looking for!

---
Maybe they're a black dude who thought the name was funny? Is it still racist if that's what he wants to be called lmao
---
Ahaha üòÖ as you can see, my talent is not in the video industry
---
I'll tell you how I would react. By voting no on the next PK related chance PvPers want.  
---
And so the cycle continues.
---
It‚Äôs honestly not much of a difference
---
has reporting a name ever done anything ever? or reporting botters or scammers? honest question. a report happens but we never get to see the results of it
---
You don't need the /s, just like we didn't need a giant red circle
---
hes lying.
---
Nice.
---
Except the cannon gives ranged xp and higher dps, this just gives you afk.
---
Forcing people to have to group up or be blocked from an entire portion of the game is a large reason why it took mobile to boost numbers.
---
Killing someone who will literally drop nothing when you are spending 2.5k per barrage cast is being an asshole. There is literally no point in killing someone 3 iteming doing a clue. You are losing money.
---
Or 10m drunken dwarfs in 5.9 seconds
---
At least TF2 is still way more interesting than Overwatch
---
It's because people used to associate racism with fact, that BECAUSE you were a certain race, there were qualities you lacked.
---
Nowadays people just say things to rile other people up.
---
i knew it was moving around, and i was not that crazy, I would support this QoL.
---
If youve been training agility at rooftops since lvl 10 you should have your graceful by 60 but if you want your graceful as fast as possible id say stick with canifis until 60 then go seers
---
there certainly are. there are bots for everything. xD
---
Mom said I had to get off after that wave. I'll play with you guys again tomorrow. That and I only need few 100 points in defender plz help

‚ÄúCure your depression‚Äù you need to educate yourself somewhere along the line you have been horribly missinformed

Check his account overview. Dude has almost a million comment karma even with his ridiculous views and constant downvoting. He's almost a meme on world news. 
---
&gt;They don't react to you simply being there. Normal players might run away, but they won't be so scripted about it.
---
\&gt;not activating developer mode in RuneLite so you can turn on interacting indicators and instantly know if someone has clicked on you
---
RIP that karamja uim settled just ran in there and stole the spotlight
---
I don't know if it made it better, but it definitely made it more bearable. Perhaps with Warding, new ways will be introduced to make it less awful (particularly for F2P players).
---
And by killing some one you have almost no chance of getting anything from you run the risk of getting that person so salty they vote no to every PvP update.
---
jagex doesnt care unless youre buying like 500m-1b+ at a time

Congrats! The grind must of been real

I've been getting too much into slayer to do rc right now

Battlefront teleport. The tabs are like 2k on the GE

Just report jagex support for botting

i have 10k of all elemetal and mind and body runes
---
I was forced to change my name of "bacon nite"
---
Why does literally everything have to be buffed? Can we leave at least one skill partially oldschool? :/
---
i have that
---
Great point. I attack everyone I can when I pk. i took my friends pking recently and started attacking a naked character. They asked why i was even bothering, until i killed him and looted an entire inventory of glories.
---
How come for the repost?
---
Right only bosses man, there's like a million items that are extremly important for ironmans that are locked behind stupid wilderness bosses. 
---
Ive seen tons of people over the years take a cash stack into the Wildy on accident you are 100% incorrect about the ‚Äúno chance‚Äù part it‚Äôs a mistake that most people make at least once

When i was in second grade, it was still oldschool runescape before 2010 and i couldnt afford membership. It was christmas holidays where you could get the cake wand and cake cannon emotes. I was so amazed by it i woke up everyday 5AM, i don't know why. 
---
I don't remember it well but my dad was asking me why i was up so early on the computer and it was christmas time.
---
If you do some digging you can find fan updated versions of those addons on github! They still work for the current version of WoW as far as I know.
---
It takes two or three ticks per craft, and with pouches you craft more than once per lap, so 99% is incorrect, let alone 99.9%.
---
Keep destroying pkers reputation!
---
Bird lol
---
Just because you don't like RC doesn't mean that there's necessarily anything wrong with the skill -- you can't please everyone with everything and having niche content is fine.
---
The issue is with stuff like achievement diaries and other recent additions (like 95 Slayer requirement for Alchemical Hydra for no other reason than to arbitrarily restrict most of the players from doing it) that are pushing the game more and more towards "MaxScape", where you need 90+ in every skill to be able to "play the game".
---
Without achievement diaries there'd be no reason for people who don't like RC to push it higher than 50 (or whatever the highest quest requirement is) and that's the way it should be.
---
Players should be able to focus on the content they like without having to grind skills that they don't enjoy for hundreds of hours.
---
Obviously it's good to have some requirements (like quest requirements, which are pretty low in comparison to diary requirements) to get people to try different things, but people shouldn't feel forced to get 91 RC just to get a faster teleport to Duradel or 90 Agility and 94 Magic among other requirements to get a teleport to a farming patch.
---
Why? I have nothing to gain from it, it will just cost me more time and supplies
---
But that's like, your opinion man.
---
No herbs in the breading wtf are you feeding your family
---
Bring 1m rune ess to nats :^)
---
Xp/hour might be the same, but cash/hour goes through the roof.
---
Store bought... It was on sale. Can't afford to make my own, I just spent $11 on some game :(
---
I know every1 says this but train your slayer 75+ you start making good profit
---
Until then, you can range blue dragons for 200-400k/hr
---
Lastly you can also do barrows
---
You seem to be under the impression that Jagex is good at making healthy decisions for them game. You're talking about the company that came up with EoC, removed the wilderness entirely, removed free trade, introduced the Squeal of Fortune, and much more.
---
I always kinda liked serene. I never interacted with him directly but when I did come across him we got along. I got it was a meme to tell him to shut up but I never had a reason to dislike him. He seemed popular even if the attention was negative. I think his absence shows that.
---
Meet me at the ge 11:16 am March the 7th 
---
You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.
---
Look at his post history mate. He hadn't gone more then a couple hours without posting since he'd made that account.
---
Imagine you had a buddy that was at a certain bar, at the same time, everyday like clockwork. If suddenly he wasn't there anymore without no warning several times in a row, you'd assume somethings up. 
---
I have a super super cheap method of doing it that makes barrows around 50gp most runs (4k if unlucky with spawns). I do single inventory runs with one prayer pot, void gear, ibans blasts and rune crossbow with broad bolts. I use ardy cloak to restore prayer and burgh legs 3 to bank and get to barrows. 
---
Just got 99 crafting, as my first 99. Can people list me their uses for the Capes bank teleport?
---
What do you do for work? Can you toss mobile on your phone and Woodcut throughout the day?
---
I've been doing this up to 90 Woodcutting and 81 Fletching -- I plan to alch about 25k yew bows doing Agility soon
---
With the stats you have now I would do Konar slayer, great for a mid lvl account 
---
Best uses for Crafting Cape tele?
---
I was under the impression that usually the bots are chinese and the venezuelans are real people.
---
Nothing is stopping you, you're just technically wasting your time as the raid literally rewards you less for being low level (meaning that the average level of the entire party needs to = 115 for full rewards).
---
Get 78 herblore first, I see you are 64 herb, I don't see how it's feasible without the potions. 
---
ironically it was already buffed insanely with zeah/ourania altar but thats not enough I guess

No you don't lol. Yes, it does happen. Just like those posts of people getting pet 1 KC at a boss, or getting pet + clue + unique item on 1 kill at a boss, or rangers on their first med, or a whole host of other unlikely stuff. That doesn't mean it happens "all the fucking time."

Cooking was an exaggeration to get my point across, if you want me to be realistic, 100k+ afk exp an hour for everything minimum is what everyone desires.

Awesome thank you!

That could be a dns issue. This is often fixable by flushing your dns records. If you have admin access on your Mac, you can open terminal and paste the line I posted above. This will force your network to request the latest dns records from your isp.

Is magic the best way to kill zulrah? My friend always uses range so I just assumed that'd be the best so I've been training my range for it.

Would be balanced in PvP as you can pray, in PvM it would be OP and basically be the melee blowpipe.
---
This is EXACTLY it. You nailed it. People want the sense of achievement from getting these levels without actually putting in the effort themselves. 
---
Runescape is a rare holdout from a time when games weren't completely centered around instant gratification. It's unique in that it's difficult grinds reward persistence and consistency with a genuine sense of accomplishment. It's deferred gratification: the game, in a time where every other game on the market has transitioned away from that model.
---
If anything, people on this subreddit are all 1200 total with 30 runecrafting who have never actually tried to RC themselves because "meme on reddit say rc bad". ZMI really doesn't have bad rates, took me a few days of casually playing to get from 60-77. You can follow people from the bank to the altar, making it even easier. Runecrafting to level 77 really isn't that bad.
---
Yeah, and voting however I want is also part of the game.
---
Still voting no on all pvp updates until people start voting no on skilling updates 
---
Surely serene's entire account was a troll? Every post seemed like 99% levels of troll with the occasionally well thought out comment where he forgot to account switch or something. 
---
Yeah, but you have to gain xp and level up in order to access those methods. That's unacceptable.

Ive bridded for many years and recently come back and just in 2 weeks ive come nearly to 1013s level.  I dont know why I never missclick smoke barrage like u, maybe ur just a noob. And tribridding is not only about 1 tick barraging its more about predicting ur opponents attack and correct prayer switching
---
osrs how to cope with rejection
---
It's just pathetic that people who enter the one PvP area in the game and then complain about dying at the hand of a PKer do this. Seriously, something needs to be done about it. Downvote away.
---
magic stone creation skill slow

Imagine dying and losing HC right before 200m
---
I've tried a bunch of different setups, including justiciar. It all just depends on what you're comfortable with and your playstyle. I stopped using justiciar because I realized I was plenty tanky from bandos chestplate/veracs and without the huge negative magic bonus (some waves I even turned on steel skin for the extra 15% boost).
---
I think the chance of freezing a nibbler with ice barrage is around 75% with full justiciar and around 91% with bandos (assuming kodai/occult/crystal shield). 
---
But this is just what worked for me personally. You should experiment with your setups  based on your performances until one 'clicks' with you
---
Hes fine, I follow him on Twitter.
---
"Clue reward balanced" my arse.
---
You can get 5 "Dig here" clues that never send you to the wilderness and end up with a 5m reward, or get 3 wilderness clues in a row for 40k
---
I just saw the clip. Basically, there's a bug in the game where enemies freeze up if you try to interact with items or other things outside of your inventory. Woox brought a sack of cabbages to act as filler items so he could keep trying to pick up the sharks he was dropping. This made Robert the strong freeze in place so he could flinch it.
---
So why is this post karma whoring then?
---
I got 15 just then
---
disgusting item highlighting, downvoted 
---
You all suck 
---
Those inventory tags though, thats overkill
---
It's an achievement for him though, he posted fucking everywhere
---
He's maxed on the main I think?
---
Because they tried to offer item suggestions to replace alchables but they were all shut down so they didn't really have a choice
---
The blessed d'hide one was gimped because they put the coif in the poll blog, and polled it at the same time as a massive buff to PKers' ability to kill PVMers (snare change). 
---
The second one isn't about buffing the max cape, its about making the ranged cape less useless compared to the assembler. 
---
The requirements for wildy bosses is much easier though.  Vorkath requires Dragon Slayer 2, Zulrah requires 76 Agility and insane gear.  Venenatis is safe-spottable, the wilderness crazy mages you can do with 50 magic, revenants are 1m+/hr with the only requirement being a few prayer levels.  In what way is the risk-reward for wildy bosses shit for low-high level players?
---
I didn‚Äôt say that the time scim drop was QoL, he‚Äôs opposed a ton of different updates for literally no reason other than he got it the long way, some of which were QoL updates that made doing things more efficiently easier and was simply bad game design to have to do a work around in the first place. The rune scim drop wasn‚Äôt the only update he opposed like this.
---
‚ÄúDevalue‚Äù is in quotes because it‚Äôs idiotic to think that it should ‚Äúdevalue‚Äù anything. If you want to get value out of putting arbitrary limitations on yourself in a video game go for it, but that‚Äôs for self gratification. Affecting everyone else‚Äôs ability to play the game because you feel jaded is just selfish and will always get you hate
---
He achieved what he did regardless of if there was an easier way, he should feel that achievement regardless of if they made the change. The only reason he should feel any form of ‚Äúdevaluation‚Äù in his achievement is if the only thing he cared about was trying to show off to other people for internet points. That‚Äôs not something that should be catered to for game design.
---
Also, extending this idea in the most simple of cases means that no content can ever be created which makes anything faster/better/easier or else it ‚Äúdevalues mah achievements!‚Äù Which is where the circle jerk came in. His attitude was always that of a selfie jaded child and he approached topics extremely abrasively, that‚Äôs why people didn‚Äôt like him. People don‚Äôt circle jerk about someone for no reason, no one is that important for everyone to care about without a reason.

Thank his for Unrestricted Worlds, honestly Zulrah on main felt like homework you constantly got punished for. Man doesn‚Äôt want to study the rotations.
---
Because content has been built around blowpipe
---
You keep jumping back to QoL when that‚Äôs not what I said these things were. I said SOME of the updates have been QoL, not everything I‚Äôm referring to. Yes, some are buffs as well. There‚Äôs only so many niches you can fill until they all become worthless and pointless. In the end you have to eventually move up. We can‚Äôt just keep making an infinite amount of equally good tier 70 weapons for example, eventually we have to make something that‚Äôs simply better or we just stop updating all together. The same can be said for skills. Unless you want to just stop updating skills all together, eventually you‚Äôll need to put in something that‚Äôs better/higher level that didn‚Äôt exist before. If it‚Äôs equally good, then there‚Äôs little draw to doing it, and if you have a dozen equally good methods, half will be dead content just because of too much variety. Scientific studies have even shown that too many choices are often times worse than having a few concise defined choices to pick from. The phone market is a pretty good example. There‚Äôs a few big manufacturers that everyone buys from, and the rest split maybe 5-10% of the market. Not because their phones are worse, but because too much choice stifles people‚Äôs ability and desire to choose.
---
You‚Äôre right that RS3s main downfall was devalued achievement, but not in the sense of devaluing what people have already achieved, they removed the feeling of achievement from people actually doing the content so those actively training skills didn‚Äôt feel anything. It had absolutely nothing to do with maintaining a sense of achievement for those who already completed it. It also largely had to do with the P2W and bonus xp feeling brought in from MTX more than changes in the skill content.
---
Also, again, the sense of achievement should come from what you did, he still achieved getting a rune scim the hard way, why should it matter if someone later on can get it easier? That shouldn‚Äôt affect his sense of achievement whatsoever because he still achieved what he did. Also, regardless of any of this, he still had the smithing level to prove it which was never being ‚Äúdevalued‚Äù so even if someone else got a rune scim easier, he still had the smithing requirement that they didn‚Äôt have.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking game, hurting other people‚Äôs enjoyment for selfish reasons is going to get you backlash period, that‚Äôs what happened, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it was justified or not. To not expect some hate from it was naive.
---
Found kid who can't afford rigour
---
Nah, SoF had already been released them.
---
Yes, but how to detect leechers? There‚Äôs quite a few jobs that quite literally involve waiting til someone shows up, so a normal activity bar won‚Äôt work. Same goes for all the low levels that play it for fun, who won‚Äôt realistically do any notable damage to the other players.
---
Basically what I‚Äôm saying is, to combat leechers there needs to be a bigger incentive to actually contribute, or they need to do something about people feeling obligated to play a minigame they‚Äôre not interested in.
---
Unless of course you just have a person stationed there kicking said leechers.

"To player" should be the biggest red flag. Except maybe your rs name is player. 
---
Look a lot of people hate runecrafting, that isnt wrong but to think that going by reddit upvote percentage is a good indicator of if it would pass is dumb af. On top of that changing RC to be easier would just lead to rs3. Osrs updated isnt about changing the fundamentals of the game they are to add to the game and add in a way that fits the osrs style, the suggestion you make is literally easy-scape and if you want that yo to rs3. If you dont want to iron man rs3 then sorry enjoy osrs for what it is and dont fuck it up for the real players.
---
theirs a diary with 60 fming req, and a quest with 66 fming req
---
When you die, always think of something you learnt, I guarantee you will learn at least 1 thing per run. That honestly made it fun for me and much less painful.
---
I thought about this as well and think it would fix pking on mains without killing account builds, but it would never pass. 
---
Im the opposite, 6-7 of the like 15 boys in my class started accounts around 2014/2015 and played during class. Im not hiding, but im not mentioning that im still playing either unless asked directly
---
Aha, you seem to have mistaken me for someone who thinks Wintertodt was a bad update. 
---
I want him to whisper me erotica tbh
---
That's left for the organised gamer 
---
Where do you get having a talisman + fangs = finished arch alliance?
---
I had a talisman + 2k fangs for months but never finished the mini quest cause I couldn't be stuffed doing the favour. So this would have gotten me the diary done without needing the favour grind
---
Yes. I have similar stats (a couple less range and defence) and similar gear (except normal void and dragonfire ward) and i average 4-5 kill trips easily. 
---
I take 2x ranging, super antifire, super ani venom, bgs, 7x manta, 1x karambawan, 4x restore, rune pouch and the rest super restores. 
---
Make sure you are praying range, and just focus on taking 0 avoidable damage and only take damage from his magic attack. 
---
With this set up i get consistently  2M profit/hr after supplies are taken into account

Jeez you cunts are really writing books out here

I'm afraid that's how the real world works mate, a lot of things are going to have risks and those risks can vary as can the rewards. If you want to learn boxing you're going to get punched in the face, there's no way around it.

Off to plant some stuff...
---
Well considering torvesta has near 300k subs, framed has 230k channels based on nothing but pking, and other pk content creators have a decent amount of subs I'd say pking is pretty popular.  Maybe not as popular as pvm but I'm sure there will be more than 25% of the votes off pkers with multiple accounts.  Like the spellbook resizeable update icon not passing.  Keep spite voting, only makes pkers want to spite vote back, and while in the minority, every pker has 3-4+ accounts.
---
He's retarded
---
It's a thing you have to take in context. Firemaking didn't necessarily have that much value to begin with, and Wintertodt still isn't efficient despite how strong it is. That being said, I'd be in favor of both the xp and supply rewards being nerfed.
---
Imagine unironically caring what phone someone uses. You're probably all in your 20s, get a fucking grip.

He just doesn't appreciate the game getting easier seeming as it's supposed to be an Old School game. The game getting easier just makes it look more and more like RS3

Yall need to change to search terms into video games, wow seems to be at least 7 times bigger that way. hmmmmm
---
&gt; but I've seen plenty of people shit themselves over any proposed changes even though it's practically indistinguishable from Agility training
---
EHP for Agility starts at 96, when you stop failing Ardy right?
---
EHP for RC starts at 75 and you craft level 23 runes even though there's a rune that can be crafted at 95...
---
Let's be honest, no matter which side of the fence you sit on crafting a level 95 rune should definitely be better exp than crafting a level 23 rune.

Was the BCP for the SGS spec or did you find it useful tanking?

you can't see what other people risk, so you may aswell kill everyone. that's it. if you came to the wilderness, you accepted the risk of death.

that's as simple as it is, stop making it personal or bringing feelings into this lmao.

It's almost always going to be high level armour amd weapons or high level resources. Assuming you have a moderate value bank or higher.

Have you played around with the runelite bank value/item value settings?

It is for that. If be willing to bet about 50% of accounts is would actually benefit have under 11 prayer or whatever it is for desert treasure

Chose a diary and work it! It's a pretty nice way to focus on a goal that needs a lot of requirements. Yesterday I finally did my wilderness medium diary just for the fire giants shortcut (point grinding)

It's a meme around here. People claim they can hack your account by knowing some obscure fact about your account. Same reason you censored out random part of information... or so I thought.

That's why he contacts customer support. Customer support gives him three times the exact same answer which doesn't help at all.

Yeh at the area of the wildy I totally get it. Because they could be holding several 100k of loot.

Actually doesn't make protect magic dead content cause you still have ancients. Also it actually gives you a reason to use entangle and the standard spellbook or else tangles are dead content.

hahahahhahahahahahahah

Keep it up, soon you won't be able to vote on pvp content, especially if you guys make it so blatantly obvious that you don't have the best interests of the game in mind.

But we took your head? "Tis but a scratch"
---
Yeah it sucks so much i have a baby on the way in 3 weeks which leaves me with less time to play so will take me alot longer to get my stuff back feelsbadman 
---
That's not the whole story though. You can just look back at just how simple all the mechanics from those early year bosses. We were bad at the game. These days any top raider is required to do all mechanics near perfectly, while all doing near perfect amounts of output.
---
Just look back at the hardest fights from BC. M'uru? Kill adds. Felmyst? Don't stand in bad. Illidan, Kael, Vashj? Their difficulty was just learning relatively simple easy mechanics, in many different phases and doing them for 30 minutes without messing up.
---
You know what else didn't exist in BC? Day raiding, split runs, gear funneling, all the WAs we use. All those guilds have spent literally thousands of hours preparing for this week.
---
M KJ, which is pretty widely considered the mechanically hardest boss ever, took 12 days to kill. Over 12 days they had 653 failed attempts, raiding ~16 hour days. BC bosses would stand for months before they were killed, but with only having a small handful of attempts a week.
---
WoW is now an actual job for all these top guilds, in a way it never was before. That's what makes comparison by kill dates so irrelevant.
---
Doubtful. And removing duration halving from Entangle is not a game integrity issue, it's not important for the games health. The same amount of integrity/health can be achieved by enabling duration halving on ancients.
---
Another problem is that the devs have no idea what fun and interactive skilling is. I have a feeling wintertodt, rooftop courses and zeah rc was supposed to be a lot more interactive and fun but that's not really what happened. Or they create something decent and it becomes dead content, like solo wintertodt (dead compared to normal) or underwater agility.
---
It gets better the more you look
---
I think his channel is for the more casual player, looking for basic information. Because from an efficient perspective, I've heard in the past that he's left out certain important details and misleading his audience by not involving the absolute greatest methods as examples in the skill guides.

Autumn Elegy is the person that I'd trust the most when it comes to these sort of guides, but he's unfortunately not as active anymore.

Holy fucking shit this is the fastest "no" of my life.

I received an email saying just "Testing" with the subject line "Your Account Has Been Involved In Real World Trading". A couple of minutes/hours later this one was received.

Is that a new ring? Sibling to the berserker ring?
---
My RSN as a kid was Cracka154 or something close to that. Got banned at 100cb. Young me was devastated.
---
hey thanks for the reply, gwds is sadly not because why would I choose my level 100 friend over my clan mate who is maxed. the level 100 would do less dps and i have to share the loot the same. less kills less gp/hr still same split. 
---
The point of this is to have 1 place in rs where i can play with my friend bossing but not harming my gp / xp but without bringing shit tons of gp into the game. 
---
I always thought it was 93 whooopppssss
---
And it‚Äôll be because of pkers and not PvM players lol

After that? Which swtting

Swampletics literally won‚Äôt train construction because he has to take one step out of his house to teleport back to Canifis. So many other snowflake Ironman accounts have way too many ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù.

I love how you went from a [RWT'er yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/alhjiu/post_regarding_a_false_punishment_towards_my/effj30e/?context=3) to a snitch.
---
Im pretty sure he meant that as a joke, calm ur tits yo.
---
He does make a really good point. Rc is 99.99% running. It should be called ‚Äúrichboi agility‚Äù
---
He really needs to fix his lunar diplomacy guide.  
---
The amount of "lamp oil" requests we've had is too damn high.
---
Idk how much you do in the wild that's not pking, but rewards are marginally better than non wildy in all but a few spots, which of course are hotspots for pkers, making the risk vastly overshadow the reward
---
It's a PvP area, a pk hot-spot, and you expect to survive without even bringing anything to survive?
---
Damn, kids. Don't enter the wilderness if you don't want to die, easy as it is.
---
I played Wow, all says in PvP servers. You don't get anything from killing anyone, yet I loved it. There was always that fucking retard that went into an account in your factiom to complain, beg or insult you. IN A FUCKING PVP SERVER!
---
You are warned every time you get in the wilderness. So either die like a weakling, or fight back like a champ. But don't cry like a fucking kid. 
---
That wasn't what bothered me about AE. The reason why I dislike him is due to the whole AHK issue. He acted like a child and "REEEE"d the hardest. Talking about how the JMODs can't do a proper job in making decisions. That's what makes me think he is a selfish asshole.
---
The only change id want for rc is lavas being removed as the meta and wraths giving the most xp per hr.
---
I do not like skills where the max xp per hr can be done at like level 50.

No thanks

Ge prices aren't accurate because they can only move 5% a day. The Lance is about 108m. 
---
how abt it's all pvp and theres a bit next to it where they can't attack u from with barrages and range 
---
He has also suggested buffs to things that he was currently using at the time too (brimhaven agility arena springs to mind immediately). So you can't touch a skill that he has 200m in, but if he doesn't he suggests buffs to it. But only to methods he uses, anything that brings a casual player not tick manipulating closer to his xp rates is bad. Total hypocrite. 
---
I got zulrah pet at around 600 kc, but I was drunk at the time so forgot to insure it. Lost it a few kills later because I died. After that I was so mad and I wanted the pet back. Got to 8000 kc and no zulrah pet :'(
---
Let me do this for 0 rune gain and it's balanced. 
---
Honestly think you‚Äôll be fine, it‚Äôs going to take longer to kill but it‚Äôs 100% doable with that range level. Here‚Äôs a little tip from the wiki quest
---
&gt;There is a safespot in the arena across a bridge on the outside edge. From there, you can either range him, or lure him into the 10th Squad gnomes, who can weaken him. 
---
&gt;	Once the Jungle Demon is within lethal range, with Protect from Magic still activated, run up to the Jungle Demon and Melee it once and run back. This will prevent the Jungle Demon from using his Melee attack while he continues to hit you with Magic which you protect from. Standing still once you are teleported to the arena will keep distance between you and the Jungle Demon. The demon will not move, and thus will not be able to approach you and use its Melee attack, which will result in you taking no damage throughout the fight as long as you keep your prayer up.
---
Either that or he‚Äôs just foreign 
---
no
---
Join "deliveritems" cc and ask for one
---
You‚Äôre an actual moron. Good lord.

You think it‚Äôs completely impossible that, oh I don‚Äôt know, he made a new account? Or got tired of posting? My point was why in the hell was the first thought for everyone that he killed himself.
---
I mean they can't even add a fucking colorblind mode or a cutscene(s) button on the log in page without the retarded autists that want Vanilla throwing a fit, I doubt it'll have any updates whatsoever

it EASILY could be enough yes. Likely no, but possible for sure.

Guy that made guides and plays 120% efficiently.

Yeah it sucks ive even got photos of him admitting it all calling me stupid and shit lol its all my own fault love to see this kid irl rofl

I don't blame you at all lol.
---
They're new items and it takes time for the G.E to adapt to the price players are buying and selling them for.

You need magic imbue spell for lavas sounds like you are doing it without so you get 50% xp rates.

Nicest looking pet in game imo

How is killer a player in a pvp zone griefing? It annoys me when I die trying to do a clue or whatever too, but I understand the risk I'm taking. 
---
Yup, if there's no benefit to you, the only thing you get from it is hindering another player, AKA griefing.
---
true, but a rudimentary understanding of the tick system which there are in-depth videos on allows you to pick up on what they're doing fairly easily, especially when you account for the fact that most of them talk about the method in their descriptions
---
Why wouldnt it be?.. You can even sell rs gp for cheese if you want. 
---
If there's no benefit to you outside of hindering another player, it's griefing.
---
Been using tap to zoom and force rotation control so my came is portrait since the beta. Is a much better experience. I can hold my phone normally, type easily and quickly zoom on any small icon I need to tap.

torags legs and body or torags body and veracs legs i think veracs doenst have the ranged defense that torag has. I sometimes take verac skirt instead of torag legs

The thought of the game being balanced around mobile isn't very promising though. When will the loot boxes which give level boosts be coming out?
---
The whisper song
---
you're in no def bonus, you're gonna get bopped by everything.
---
most of his xp rates make no sense its usualy either too high or too low, especialy for mid level lik 80-90 the xp rates he gives out is either you can only achieve at 99 or way too low that you can get at lets say 90.
---
I guess your reading skills are also off the charts then. As it said "edited 42 minutes ago" my reply, "43 minutes ago". I'm not really sure how you can be stupid enough to blatantly lie when both your edit and my comment are time stamped by reddit and my literally shows I posted before your edit.

Slayer already has a ton of pets, and the construction one could only ever come if they added some kind of construction minigame.

Take a guess

They could have cash on them, they mightve opened the casket and gotten rangers or anything, you never know
---
Cat.
---
Damn true..
---
Really that fast? Damn.
---
Pkers cannot see your inventory, they dont know if you risk 0gp or 50m.. do everyone a favour and just dont go into pvp areas. 
---
The thought of it dying off when dropped by mobile and forcing the entire user base to newer runescapes isn‚Äôt promising.
---
Maybe they should just ban all use of third party apps and clients because that‚Äôs how they balanced wilderness.
---
You either want more players or you don‚Äôt, fussing about loot boxes that don‚Äôt really affect you in other games doesn‚Äôt make sense here.
---
you're only 30% of the playbase and a lot of those accounts are just alts.
---
basically nobody gives a fuck about ironmen.
---
Except they don't. The only thing you get from it is making another players clue disappear. Griefing. 
---
Like I said, if you don't want people to rally for removal of pvp, stop being toxic.
---
hes not saying he can or can not do the guides he does, hes saying he can use google and find the same information and probly more accurate information then a guy making a guide not from his personal expierence with methods.

That all sounds fine to me tbh.

Construction pet suggestion was just from childhood memory when it was fun to get the chairs to follow you.

Why u have to be mad,its only a game 
---
@ me when a clue is worth 50m and doesn't just disappear on death. Y'all so retarded.
---
Stop fuckin snitchin you little bitch. 
---
I think he mostly cared for not making xp rates faster like rs3, which happened on osrs for some skills. Some skills are the same as back when he played, others arn‚Äôt
---
I dont know why you got thumbed down so badly, you‚Äôre completely right.
---
Yeah I do agree if they did one the chair would probably be the best idea.

Just leave 1 at all times xD

You didn't get stunned a single time in your story

I left konar for duradel, she keeps assigning slayer monsters below hydra, and all over the place.

That was actually definitely true. He‚Äôs one of the first to make guides and focused the most on efficiency. 
---
Is Tome of Fire really worth the grind for an Iron Man? 
---
Yes. 
---
my mum still wipes me ass when i poo poo
---
with the content farming got in the past years, you can do farm runs nonstop, also tithe farm.
---
I meant it in a good way. Summoning is *the* ironman skill.
---
I highly considered this but the temptation of farming xp got the best of me
---
&gt;Regardless of what happens, you can claim you're right.
---
Very different scenarios. Time will tell which one will happen.
---
&gt;Nihilum didn't even flask and use full potions
---
Yes they did and had people gathering resources if they didn't make the cut to be in the raid group.
---
&gt;class stacking, a concept that was never even considered back then
---
Class stacking was very much in use but using simming to show it is possible is definitely good enough for me. 
---
Taking it back in time to 2007
---
I remember back when autumn elegy was getting close to the rune scim on his f2p UIM account and the suggestions started coming up on the Q&amp;A streams to add the rune scim to Obor's drop table. a few comments on reddit were like "let's get this fucking neckbeard to quit his account over a rune scim how great would that be lol."
---
Ok farquad, you're just jealous.
---
holy fuck i‚Äôve watched this like 3 times it‚Äôs hilarious 
---
‚ÄúHated the layperson and person who wasn‚Äôt interested in efficiency‚Äù.
---
If you find a quote or a source of him saying this, I will give you 10m.
---
Thats how confident i am that you‚Äôre spreading misinformation.
---
Maybe he should work at his comedic timing 
---
There‚Äôs an NPC in puro-puro that gives you a few free impling jars if it‚Äôs your first time. But then after that you can trade in jars with captured imps for three empty jars. Basically you shouldn‚Äôt need to make a bunch of jars because you can acquire them from the game
---
i dont have rigour, but eagle eye does the trick almost all my hits are near max hit with blowpipe
---
Pray melee
---
D defender worth it?
---
Killed some guy with 300 superior bones once, that's why you get attacked lol
---
Generally people go for base 90s then max strength then attack and lastly defence. Nmz is good for XP but afking isn't rely efficient unless ur a busy person with very little time to play. 
---
\#imfamousboyz
---
Lol rip. I just need veras skirt and helm soni can get pray and def bonus for friggin bandos. Guthans swapping maybe but id have to get comfy first lol
---
At the soft price of 500m gp!
---
New players is always a good thing but it doesn't mean the game needs to change so drastically for them. RS3 will be releasing their mobile version soon and I think that will be better for a younger, mobile audience and could do that game a lot of good.
---
It only resets if you log during the 5 minute growth window before the farm tick happens. If you log during a nongrowth window it wont reset no matter what. It's only really a problem for the trees that take a long time to grow since their growth cycles are so much longer and more easily to mess up.
---
Not if you don‚Äôt have a squad of friends to make sure you can do chaos alter
---
Why is smoldering so fucking high then! Lol 
---
Or the cabbage mage in wildy agi arena
---
Except that‚Äôs not the truth. After his 2 day ban he just started using mousekeys. He quit LONG after that. He even managed getting 200m mining xp and a ton of xp in rc i think. He quit because he lost interest.
---
I'm not a pker though, I primarily do PvM. I can't pk for shit lmao

I can't be bothered looking it up for 10m, make it 100m and we have a deal.
---
I'm a software developer by profession, a systems and network administrator by education, and have experience in computer security including participation in computer defense competitions as the team programmer.

You have far too much faith in the systems at work here.
---
I disagree, generally when people take it and or ignore it, almost everyone stops because it's not fun/interesting anymore. People generally do it to instigate. Look at A Friend for example and all of the backlash he's gotten. His videos were getting 2-3 times the dislikes as likes and all kinds of hate on here. He owned up to his video and moved on. He never talked about it or acknowledged the hate or dislikes. A few videos later and the people who disliked his videos just to flame him stopped and his videos got normal like/dislikes again and no one really talks about him on reddit anymore either aside from the occasional random meme like this.
---
I mean this was also somewhat accompanied by some gaps in content that he claims were for other reasons, but could also have just been to take a break and get a fresh start to lesson the annoying hate. This is how you handle changing. Your goal shouldn't be to change the people who don't like you's mind, it should be to genuinely change and you can then bring new people in who don't know your old issues because they aren't there anymore. 
---
I know you‚Äôre not hating, but for everyone else in this thread, as a relatively new player to OSRS since mobile came out, theoatrix has been a great resource aside from the wiki. He explains the skills very well to a noob audience to at least give them some grounding to getting more advanced. His videos are also very well made and easy to navigate. I appreciate what he does and think he‚Äôs one of the best OSRS YouTubers that really contribute to bringing in new players.
---
Bonfires from RS3 were a good update. Change my mind. 
---
https://youtu.be/zuQ531zO0H8
---
It's a dude who just reads a wikia and makes a video about it. He has no experience or knows stuff about the game. There are many mistakes in his guides and should not ever be used aside from very beginner players imo
---
He made his youtube account in 2012, people were making efficiency guides for runescape back in 2006.
---
Simple misunderstanding my boy, the skill was never mean to be "runecrafting" but rather "Run eCrafting", running is part of the fun!
---
Yeah, but have you considered the risk needed to do such high dps as opposed to the risk required to cast ice barrage?
---
died in the wilderness with 7 dragon bones? M'HARASSMENT, JAGEX HELP ME!!!!!
---
More like a psychopath 
---
And the game will lose players to it lol
---
The game won‚Äôt change drastically but the balance around the wild will
---
He didn‚Äôt want the game to continuously get easier which is what happened to rs3 and that‚Äôs a bad thing?
---
I don‚Äôt think he was that bad guys lol. He just had pretty unpopular opinions. I didn‚Äôt see his political views tho... 
---
To be fair my meme should have been clearer that this was about the blessed d'hide chaps/vambs being available to people with 1 defence. I'm undecided on the entangle changes.
---
There‚Äôs a ton of misinformation and pure bull shit being said here about Autumn Elegy. Makes me sad a lot of the people don‚Äôt even know why he was disliked so much. 
---
I'd only be salty about all the slayer ive already done without charms and waterfiends tasks ive skipped
---
funniest shit is watching people with ironman flairs point this out and then get downvoted for it
---
people who literally have no interest in pking but still acknowledge and accept the risks of being in the wild and people still get mad
---
agility is a non issue in rs3 due to downs. agility in general isnt that bad.
---
a ton of rs3 players (myself included) started playing osrs due to rc btw, some years ago. easy money
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I got B gloves, d scim, and defender but on my Ironman I‚Äôm currently working on quest cape and hard diaries. Other things might include fighter torso, void, slayer helm, slayer rings. Mostly though it‚Äôs just up to you
---
but it did DEVALUE every of thos "qol" updates that most of the time are just meta changing updates effect xp rates/methods.
---
Yeah but Slayermusiq is slow at times.
---
even thought i‚Äôve done 211 qp‚Äôs with his videos 
---
The game has to update, power creep will happen. Those are facts to any game that has a future. Yes you need balance out how fast it happens, but his main issue was how he approached the topics in a toxic way.
---
I would be lying if I said I‚Äôd give you 100m for this. Besides, he just didn‚Äôt want the game to introduce higher xp rates. Which i think everyone would be against that anyways. 
---
Nah. 70% of the people in Boaty‚Äôs chat say stuff like that 
---
&gt; E: wow people really get upset 
---
Makes a rage post
---
cries whenever people call him out 
---
deletes all his comments
---
???
---
Say other people are upset lol.
---
in osrs none   
---
but when I was my teenager days, i used to play like 3-5 accounts at a time , probably made over 90-100+ characters for nearly all brackets combat 5-10 (magic pure), 10-15(magic or steel 2h pure), 20-25(Black wep or mith wep pure) 
---
Do you not understand how bad it is for the game if people vote for their own interests over the integrity of the game though? I don't want people to vote either way specifically I just want them to vote intelligently and not use their vote as a way to get back at people who are just playing the game the way it was always intended.
---
Personally idc about the entangle buff, I have an alt to tb if I really need it like many others and honestly most of the time deep wild tb's are irrelevant if we're talking about pkers hunting pvmers since they die way before the 30 line most of the time. People argue that it would be too much of a buff to solo pkers (who tend to kill pvmers more often) but even with a buff to entangle trying to solo pk on normals is a huge disadvantage due to the inventory spaces required, it's so fucking easy to fight back and outlast someone tribridding on the normal spell book, but most people don't know that because they've never tried and just assume it's impossible when realistically the pvmer can have the advantage if they prepare themselves properly.
---
I thought the construction pet was plank from Ed Edd and Eddy
---
&gt;the diary done without needing the favour grind

I tried teleporting from someone's mounted talisman and it said I need to finish Architectural Alliance.

Provided you've done the easy diary you'll most likely get the talisman from killing Lizardmen.
---
He said he was quitting after he started going to the gym and learning piano. I think he also picked up a girlfriend at the time.

50-180k an hr easy asf just get to work m8
---
Seen that, ye. 
---
I have to disagree with this. For me, runescape is about the prestige and achievements, and runecrafting is hard which i like. If you want to go for diary cape, you have to train agility to 85, and thats alot of rounds on the rooftops. Should we change agility to more afkable then? No. Theres a certain mindset involved to play this game non-casually, and not everything should be catered for those who like to play casually. Im not taking a piss on casuals, but like infernal cape, not everything should be easily achieved. I dont mind the grindiness of said skills, i like the rewards. If you want to go for 99 rc, you should be ready to sacrifice something. Same goes with agility.

THAT'S WHAT I LIKE

The worst part about this post is how fucking dishonest you have been. You have tried to come up with some pseudo-intellectual theory about how runecrafting is suffering from a problem of not having the player spending the right amount of time doing the actual runecrafting, and then presented your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù which - here‚Äôs a surprise - just happens to also turn the skill into an afk joke of a skill. 
---
In reality you are just a scrub with 30rc who wants the skill to be easier and have tried to find some bullshit justification that fools nobody. Go play adventure quest if you want a casual game that throws achievements at you. 
---
People hate AE because he was one of the only players to not want easyscape. Now if you look at the game, it‚Äôs much easier. I remember crafting being a real pain to train on an ironman and now it‚Äôs literally one of the easiest skills because of giant seaweed. There will be a stage when this game truly loses its identity of being OSRS which is why people make accounts with stupid challenges.
---
No I‚Äôm not saying Autumn Elegy was the very first person to make efficiency videos. I‚Äôm saying he was one of the first video makers to focus on efficiency videos and play style. Definitely the most well known for it
---
PVP should only be on pvp worlds. Most toxic racist and retarded community shouldn't be enabled.
---
Elegy was a contradictory spastic who defended AHK yet was against third party software and any QoL updates. He should have been perm banned for cheating, as should everyone who abused AHK back then.
---
Yep.
---
I had a great social life and played two varsity sports for three years and never told a soul lol. when my friends would come over i would have to close down all my osrs tabs and change up my setup so it wasn‚Äôt sus. now as a senior in college living with 10 other fraternity brothers i just don‚Äôt give a fuck and they all know i play. i get called the occasional nerd but i have pretty high stats and honestly some of them watch me and are interested. didn‚Äôt tell my girlfriend for a while but eventually played in front of her and she could care less, literally weight off my shoulders. 
---
So you basically agree with him, you just think he spoke in a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù way
---
OP is the type of person to get offender over something that doesnt affect him. He will go out of his way to be offended for you.
---
runescape is more popular than WoW by now, look at google trends
---
Yeah and what makes you think I was speaking for an entire community. I'm talking about a word ya knob, not a community of people who use the word. These days that word is barely offensive, get over it soft cock.
---
not sure if its efficient but since im lazy I just leave piety on and never switch to ranged prayer, Usually my blowpipe hits 25 20 25 or something like this then he switches back I put on melee gear and hit 30 or 40 with arclight then another high hit and he switch prayer again.
---
You know that PvPers vote no to any poll that could allow new people to get into PvP right?

Why does jagex always set the starting price of items at some ridiculously low value that takes forever to catch up to the real value? Surely they must know roughly how much something is going to be worth considering they know all of the drop rates etc. 
---
That's unfair to say. A friend back in 2011 or so, and even much later, did use to put a lot of time and effort into it, like in his 10 hour loot videos. What Settled has over A friend is that he actually has a personality, originality, passion and ambition, instead of a monotone voice and a funny accent, and is also not afraid of putting many hours into the game.

It's not more *popular*, it's more searched for. That has nothing to do with player numbers or actual popularity. WoW still has 10 times as many players as Runescape does.
---
Shit, even back in WoWs peak it wasn't very searched for on Google. Not much reason to google stuff in WoW anyway.. whereas in RS, 99% of your knowledge comes from the wiki and googling (if you're new)
---
On some topics yes, others no, I think he takes it way too far to the extreme to where he wants literally no new content other than stuff that‚Äôs dead content. But yes, the majority of his ‚Äúvilification‚Äù came because of his behavior when talking about the topics along with him being a vocal figurehead of a small minority blocking updates that the majority could point at.

Wtf

they shouldnt be able to phish you by just clicking the video on twitch main site, but if you clicked a link on the video they might have had inserted some program to get your details
---
I like when skills have outfits to work towards like graceful or pyro. If they added more equipment or something like that, even if it's not super useful or just cosmetic it makes me not mind the grind as much
---
Hcim/uim drop wildy steps in fear that they might die and lose all their items/status
---
Redditors go to wildy, die, then cry on reddit about how pkers are retarded for killing them in a pking area.
---
The redditor then tells you that all ironmen are mentally handicapped.
---
Since some dude disguised himself as the lever near the lava maze this wouldn't really be surprising.
---
A useful one
---
your not following me. under the hypothetical scenario, where, all PKers stopped playing the game, and nothing else changed, the wilderness would be flooded with people trying out content that they otherwise have considered dead content due to the nature of where it is. its literally only PKers stopping the wilderness from being populated
---
Got dragon throwing axes at 31 kc last night. I cried :(
---
Well, I kinda felt that when they introduced runespan on rs3. I had grinded over 500 hours to get 99 rc and people would genuinely compliment the cape when I walked around. It was a cool little interaction with people asking for emote, asking questions about the grind and whatnot.
---
After it turned into an afk-fest with runespan, it just died down. People assumed I had done the new OP method and I just didn't feel like even wearing the cape anymore. It was pretty sad.
---
You utter garbage man
---
Do you know what a logical fallacy is? You're a walking logical fallacy. Nothing you've stated is of any value and doesn't refute what I've said, if anything you're onny giving me opportunity to prove how much of a fraud you are. Go ahead, if you have any shred of real experience you'd be able to tell me how it is possible to bypass all of these security measures. What you're alluding to is something that is unrelated to Jagex; everything you've stated leads to a single conclusion--you've been RAT'd and you're simply in denial of this. There's no way for someone to remotely access your accounts without needing authentication from a new device, it simply isn't possible, and what you've stated has never occurred. 
---
If you're going to push your random bull shit about "muh profession" then at least be honest about the fact that you don't know shit. 
---
Go ahead and make a thread and include your RSN so aa J. Mod can publicly humiliate you as well, because I can `100% guarantee that you were hijacked due to your own negligence, and not because of the magic hacker fairy that magically bypassed your authenticator and left zero trace. Is that how they did it? With a magic computer with no IP? Dumbfuck.

Itd make sense for you to be the prey unless you brought a similar setup. You came to pvm while they came to kill people like you. Thats why wilfy pvmers bring a switch so its not so one sided.

What did fletching, construction, and cooking get? 
---
No no i think you‚Äôre overlooking something with skilling updates. We‚Äôve had tons of skilling updates for skills that havn‚Äôt gotten faster: mining, rc, fishing, etc. Jagex takes an approach which I like, they balance xp, gp, intensity. For example, barbarian fishing is a bit afk and gives good xp and no gp/ compared to minnows which is leas afk, less xp, more gp/ compared to sacred eels which is a lot more afk, gives bad xp, but really good gp

How do you keep up with the meta? Is there any resources to use? CC, discord etc.?
---
You're insanely stupid and I laugh at you. You provided them no RSN or any other information about your specific account. You literally, word for word, asked them "I'd love some help... How to avoid it." And they did just that, but when they did their job that's somehow not sufficient? Do you want them to read your mind as well? Do you want Jagex to hold your hand and properly secure your own email account? 
---
helmies were a mistake 
---
I take a heavier brew outlay - 14 brews and usually that‚Äôs fine. Sang staff does a decent job of stretching supplies too.

When I am focussed I don‚Äôt take that much more damage than a main since most is avoided by running the head. The very end phase is the most annoying bit since runningg head is not very reliable in random FFAs.

All in all I seldom die.

You say that like its a bad thing. Ironmen can do these bosses too. Ironmen should be thankful for bosses like the crazy arch for dropping a rcb instead of hoping to the rng gods you get it off a random clue scroll.

yeah i agree with you. he was definitely right sometimes but other times his opinion was just too wild

We get maybe one or two decent skilling updates spread across 15 skills every year and a half dozen put into slayer, that‚Äôs the problem. Yes, we‚Äôve gotten some decent skilling updates like MLM and Wontertod but I‚Äôd hardly call adding sacred eels a ‚Äúfishing update‚Äù it added almost nothing to the game and is mostly dead content, it was put in place to keep zulrah scale prices in check better and that‚Äôs it.
---
Fist of Guthix, it was a minigame that existed pre-EOC that was actually really popular. 
---
That's hilarious. Will do in the future. 
---
In your downtime from a high effort method in one skill, you don't have to keep training that same skill. E.g. while you're burnt from darts, you'd be better off doing some afk fishing, woodcutting, etc. for \~0.4 ehp/hour rather than longbows for literally 0 ehp/hour. Of course, if you want to rush fletching at the cost of slowing down your overall progress, or if you'd enjoy doing longbows more than those other activities, it's a different story.
---
I think you have to talk to the King

Because placing something with a starting price that is too high will make people use it for luring, as you saw with all the shitty Treasure Trail items 
---
youre pathetic. i wonder how you handle irl challenges. 
---
I read most of your and /u/AuroraFinem 's comments, and I have to say that I agree with both of you to a certain extent. While I side with your opinion slightly more, I do believe that this is a minority mindset and is more commonly shared among the high levelled members of the community.
---
The truth is that a game needs to change in order to retain players and bring in new players. Skills do need to be devalued over time to appease the majority of the playerbase. I think having 5 or 6 skills devalued by an average of 10-20% per year is something I can live with. Ideally, having it be slightly lower would be better for the long term balance of the game, but it is not so much of an issue at least for the foreseeable future.
---
While I sympathize with the HLC's sentiment of not devaluing skills at all (technically I am a part of that group myself), the truth is that devaluing skills is much healthier for the long term viability of the game and the growth of the playerbase, even if it is not in the best interest of game balance and achievement. As a business, you'd be idiotic to push back certain skilling updates just because it'd appease 10-20k players, when it would grab the attention of 500k average players and bring in newbies.
---
And how do I know that this is a minority opinion? Well, both you and /u/AuroraFinem both typed out very fair and well written arguments, but he has significantly more upvotes than you, and you need to consider that reddit's average player is probably better than your actual average player as well.
---
Unfortunately the HLC is just not very good at constructing arguments and convincing the rest of the community that we know what's better for the long term balance of the game, but that's to be expected since most of us are clearly autistic. Autumn Elegy was sadly the main face of the HLC at least in the eyes of the average player, so he certainly received a lot more shit than he deserved.
---
It is, but it takes a LOT of prep, the Arc hunter outfit for 5% xp boost, enhanced yatwee stick for xp boost, hunter urns, potions to 1-tick the traps, and familiar boosts. Potentially the rewards from Sliskes Endgame as well

i can confirm this shits real. over the past year i had to switch to a verticle ergonomic mouse cus of wrist issues. i had a period of a couple months where i could barely do the most afk skills for more than a couple hours a day. it was torture.
---
protect your wrists, gamers!
---
That feeling when at the end of your run you realize that you forgot to pay one of the farmers.
---
You're misunderstanding. The overall rewards of the cluescrolls are balanced around the chance of getting a wilderness step. That doesn't mean every clue you get with a wilderness step will be a better reward, but it does mean that for the chance to get a third age item, there is also a chance to get a wilderness step.
---
Sure you did. Good job googling

Lmao says the idiot crying about not getting loot.  Your comment makes no sense rofl 
---
Eventually all 3 of those factors have to go up, not really all at once or even with the same update, but there‚Äôs already click intensive methods with zero profit, according to this you could never make a method with better xp because it‚Äôd be impossible to balance it by lowering the profit or making it less afk. That restricts potentially good content arbitrarily. I agree that things shouldn‚Äôt generally be the best at everything and you should have some kind of choice, but that choice doesn‚Äôt really exist even now except in a few cases and for a few skills. This is only exacerbated by the fact that skilling in general is absolutely horrible for profit and the only reason to do it is for level requirements or to max, so no one gives a shit if a new fishing method makes 400k/hr but almost no xp because there‚Äôs better afk methods to make more money than that and far better active methods, so the only thing that really matters is afk vs xp 
---
My father is white and his mother used to call him and his siblings peckerwoods, he never learned it was a derogatory term to white people until he called someone a peckerwood at work and one of his black friends told him, lol. He still doesn't give a shit about being called one either, and neither do I. It's probably because it doesn't mean anything to me, I suppose it might be more impactful if my great+ grandfather had been a slave and had his human rights denied on the basis of skin color, but I don't know if I would even care then since it didn't happen to me.
---
I mean if it's between 2 consenting people at or above the legal age... Why not?

199 using runelite
---
Are you better than others because you read your quest guides rather than watch them? Why is the Reddit oldschool community so weird about bashing people for YouTube guides?
---
I concur! So why then does Runecrafting have to be a skill centered entirely around running (rip agility) and be a miniscule part of actually making runes? That design aspect lies entirely outside of the realm of Fun or Subjectivity, so making the argument that" some people enjoy running being 99% of Runecrafting" is entirely pointless. It's just poor game design from more than a decade ago. 
---
i wish more people made guides like this
---
Respect the grind my guy
---
It might theoretically be BiS helm for melee, but in practice it's not actually being used anywhere and that's the only thing that matters. So by definition it is dead content.
---
Where do you actually see the serpentine helmet being used right now? Pretty much everyone is using the helmet of neitiznot, slayer, or the veracs helmet, all because the serpentine helmet costs 180k gp/hr for literally only 20 def bonus, -3 prayer bonus, and -5 ranged and magic bonuses compared to the helm of neitiznot. The envenoming effect and venom immunity are hardly worth mentioning since most bosses are immune to poison and don't atually poison you. 
---
The only places I can think of where it's being used right now is combined with a bp to mass envenom mobs, such as at sara gwd or at the bloody mutated bloodvelds inside the catacombs lol, and at zulrah itself where I think it's only really BiS for ironmen.
---
Currently the helmet just lacks a niche. It's not used as a dps helmet since the helm of neitiznot has the same str bonus, has higher pray bonus, and only loses you 20~ def bonus. It's also not used as a tank helmet since the veracs helm is straight up cheaper to use and again, it has prayer bonus. So what use does it actually have? Lose you 180k gp profit an hour is the only niche I can see that it has over the other helmets.
---
The serpentine helmet also isn't the helmet that prevents jagex from introducing new helmets. That was their argument at the time because one of the jmods was working on a project that has since been cancelled that would introduce a better version of the helm of neitiznot. The real helmet that's actually preventing jagex from introducing a better helmet is the slayer helmet, not the serpentine helmet that costs 180k gp/hr to use.
---

As someone who came to osrs from RS3, maybe it's just me and I'm fucking stupid, but the osrs grind has been a lot easier for me than rs3. Maybe it's because of mobile, or maybe it's because I just didn't know how to skill properly in rs3. Either way, the osrs grind has been wayyyy easier for me. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if it gets buffed or not. But there‚Äôs no reason for the skill to be cancer to train. It can have the same exp rates and be more fun to train.
---
Yes iirc he agreed to a similar system to the NPC chat. Where you can choose an option with a number. He disagreed with shift drop because there was a better solution out there.
---
rc is about 90% afk on rs3, with over 100k/h at lower levels
---
Who's complaining exactly?
---
Thanks for the heads up! 
---
Saradomon mage doesn't appear in the wilderness 
---
Pvp is pretty dead but "no that'll make it too easy to make other people do well enough to be able to compete and I want only me to be good!"
---
They'd rather let pvp die than have other people be decent. 
---
Hard to tell based off pic what you‚Äôre doing but based off title it sounds like you‚Äôre ranging in the burst side of dusts so it makes sense why you got crashed...
---
EHP is not chaos altar, it's gilded.
---
They aren‚Äôt, this sub circle jerks over the quest YouTube guy more than they do about anything else.
---
was that without ardy elite? Because I have ardy elite and already 2,3k marks of grace from 93-98(12,5m xp)
---
The real question is why the other 2 so small
---
Lol he couldn‚Äôt take the heat so he had to delete
---
What the hell am I supposed to do with Sailing? Fish?
---
Why not just add fishing boats to the Fishing/Construction skills?
---
What would happen with charter ships?
---
Timekeeping would be way more unique to the game like Runecrafting.
---
No balls
---
Even thingsl ike ensouled heads which are super chill are over 300k xp per hour. Prayer is fast. Period. There's no debate.
---
This makes it EXTREMELY afk. This isn‚Äôt a fix, this is straight up easyscape.
---
The real way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù runecrafting is to make it more profitable so that the people who endure the grind get a larger benefit for it.
---
It used to be the best money in the game when the game came out. Nats were 2m an hour when the highest pvm was only like 1.6m an hour at max gear and stats.
---
Now RC is at most 1.5m an hour while PVM is all the way up to 4m an hour.
---
RC is still a hard fucking skill, but now it‚Äôs unrewarding. Too many dumb updates like the one you‚Äôre suggesting have made a powercreep in terms of profit for PVM.
---
how are the pre-olm bosses without overheads though :O
---
becaus it helps them out 
---
I'm not annoyed too much by giant seaweed making crafting "easier" because shopmanmode is shit these days with so many irons playing. We still need a viable alternative for smithing because buying ore from the blast furnace shop is shit.
---
At least with giant seaweed there's some more effort involved in other ways, as you have to collect a ton of sand yourself (on pvp worlds!), and you have to cast superglass with 3+18 and pick up the excess off the floor for maximum efficiency. It's not quite as sweaty as charters, but there's still some "skill" involved in crafting.
---
The downside to skulling is that you risk getting maced for your bp/craws/mace
---
I personally don‚Äôt mind RC as it is now and personally I‚Äôd rather have it left alone. I‚Äôm not deciding whether RC should be made easier or whatever I‚Äôm just saying this ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to do x‚Äù idea is stupid because you actually do have to. 
---
OP is a whiny little bitch
---
They clearly give a shit
---
Yes times 1000
---
Yeah but that was a case of them setting the starting price far too high because they weren't very useful, i'm not saying the price needs to start at something crazy like 1b or something but we all knew lance would be worth far more than the price they set.
---
Back when d claws were released they set the price at 500k, right after they removed free trade funnily enough, when they do that kind of thing it just indicates to me that Jagex are out of touch with how much of an impact some content they add is going to be.
---
This sub has the absolute worst of people, and some of the best of people.
---
The majority is sadly the worst imo
---
This it my ultimate nightmare.

Always kill your nakeds

Well I don't need to build anything for that :p

Does your phone uses a USB-C or mini-USB plug?
---
As you can see in the video, I use an adapter before plugging it into my phone. All you have to do is plug a USB HUB into your phone then, plus a mouse and keyboard into the HUB. 
---
WHAT
---
Love this! Would like to print this, is there a digital download for this?
---
Agility also has similar to the pre thieving nerf here at rs3: set your camera correct and you can just click away without moving mouse while every 5 lvls the exp you gain is increased. No fails, you get rewards occasionally, take your time to priffiddinas course while you just click away. And since the 23 hour log system you can do it pretty much the entire day. Yes, as far i am aware, rs3 people can be logged in for 23 hours straight, before needing to restart the client vs our 6 hours. 
---
Honestly you could say the same thing around balancing content around ironmen
---
You have some really good points here. While I'd prefer the Serp helm's niche lie somewhere other than in its strength bonus, you're right in that its BiS status is only theoretical. Thank you for answering my question.
---
75 attack at some point in case you ever want to go bridding with Staff of the Dead or whatever

Any well adjusted, normal individual that caught you looking at this would think you are a fucking weirdo. 
---
Dragon Crossbow is pretty shit tbh. Very small upgrade over rcb
---
yea i got 10k mithril darts, its just the scales i could only fill it up to 20%. shit blew my bank acc 
---
It‚Äôs not about RS3 Itself. It‚Äôs about the movement from rs2 to rs2 post eoc that people are talking about, anyways
---
I just really really find that hard to believe
---
And your collection log proves nothing. It doesn't count drops before it came out but it does count all kc
---
this is kinda serious since runescape has  @jagex.com as a safe sender in their list.  
---
Why was it flawed ?
---
I used bind and earth blast with fairly medium defense levels and praying range.  Pretty simple fight, I averaged roughly 5 lobsters and occasionally ran out of prayer points if I missed a ton of shots.
---
Pretty cool, incense seems OP but when we‚Äôre in need of a new update and power creep would consider it
---
23 and you still can‚Äôt beat jad? Your wife must find you inadequate. 
---
Vespula was never a bad boss given how absurdly fast it is. Good to see another guide out there to discourage skipping it.
---
this is why I like runescape, you can be hours there and not get one or be there for couple mins and get 10 drops of an item, rng on runescape is i love
---
Yeah the sand/seaweed collection isn't really sweaty, though they both still require quite a bit of time to get. The sweaty part mostly comes from using superglass make as you can save a ton of time if you're tick-perfect banking for it.
---
i see, but dont selll blowpipe for dragon crossbow its not worth it
---
Friendly reminder blowpipe+addy darts+rigour is stronger than chaotics with turmoil and overloads :) for you spaz retards on this sub 
---
Well, You could‚Äôve phrased it differently but you choose the asshole route.
---
The 1~3 minute run to the hydra really takes the kills per hour down. Even if you have max gear. Instant shortcut would mean more profit and most likely a nerf to the droptable. But please. If your response is going to be negative again feel free to keep it to yourself.
---
biggest tip is always call as soon as it can be called (there‚Äôs a timer in top right corner) it is pretty easy too get a hang of after that 
---
Manual investigation I believe.
---
Why are those points so low?
---
Well rng is not my strong side... Played hearstone for 2 years and trust me my luck was SHIT.
---
there are a lot of comments in this thread saying they had no problem recovering their accounts through the actual support on the website
---
seems like twitter isn't exactly the best place for customer support for certain scenarios
---
you‚Äôll be sweet
---
Ironman btw
---
fucking aspies in thus sub that cant detect sarcasm downvoting you
---
You think it would crash, but in reality if the XP rates were fair, people still wouldn't be doing nats or bloods and instead would choose the faster XP rate to max the skill.
---
Im sorry if i gave the wrong impression. I have the qcp on my iron. Well, that‚Äôs a lie. Havent done the last new quest üòÇ
---
Agility is the best skill in rs3 dont @ me
---
E
---
Ahk 1:1 is identical to mousekeys........ mousekeys are not against the rules......
---
yoo im eating pasta! small word crazy
---
That‚Äôs an option as well but it‚Äôs much more tedious since the bind only lasts 5 seconds in f2p. I personally never did it because I never liked f2p mage but I‚Äôve heard of quite a few people who like that method
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get why people shit on others for doing what‚Äôs fun for them. And if you‚Äôre making profit, you can make ‚Äòbank‚Äô if you do it long enough.

Q
---
I‚Äôm not going on the website what is it?
---
Man I did this too...feels bad. Just wanted +5 const for my pool. Was so angry I just paid for 2 more const lvls instead of raising a new cat. RIP.
---
We legit rip her head off though? How is she going to text without a head?! She won‚Äôt be able to see 
---
Those point avgs are awful for 3+1/2. Are ppl dying 2-3x every raid?
---
RuneLite doesn‚Äôt have it. How‚Äôs that solving the problem?
---
When good rewards have hard requirements üò†üò†üò†üò†
---
How many brews staminas and restores?
---
I also played the beta for the week before the update. It just wasn't an enjoyable experience for me. Everyone has a different opinion, I don't think its great but you do, so you do you
---
Basically talking about how Jewish people will take over the world after WW3 between the US and Russia. It's one of those psycho-religious websites which plasters MASSIVE walls over text with clip art images haha.
---
Yeah, exactly. I wonder why they abandoned that feature? I thought it was pretty useful.
---
People don't really have a problem with the +4 lvls ovls give, they have a problem with the stats boosting back up after u saradomin brew.
---
Are we talking about the same Chris Archie? He's literally still making pking vids, he just dropped one last week. And he still owns! 
---
They didn't abandon it. It was never in OSRS. It was released after 2007
---
Torture over Prims
---
you can never quit playing btw.. tried and tested kek.
---
if your account is relatively new, just make a new one and start fresh. if its an older (1k total maybe), just rebuild, fall in love with the game again
---
Wearing it in off hand and having a rune pouch of laws dusts and water lets you have access to every teleport in game so good for teleporting around 
---
First couple don‚Äôt count 
---
I know I‚Äôm taking about RS2
---
Super random but low levels can also farm Yanillian hops from 16 farming! The seeds are almost free, Chuck a bucket of ultracompost on it and it's a guaranteed profit. You can even protect it.
---
Again, only for those in need of a steady (but small) income.
---
1. Don‚Äôt have access to rigour or armadyl, so I do less dps than an average main.
---
2. Was below 115 average, so we got hit with the arbitrary 20% point penalty.
---
this idea would make torag's the best dps in all of runescape....
---
and i bet you voted no to pures wearing godchaps because you thought we couldnt wield black dhide chaps 
---
SMH
---
Jagex set a limit on how much coal can be mined all the way from the beginning of the game. Nobody knows when it will happen but someday all the coal will be gone and we will be helpless
---
imagine making troll comments, designed to piss people off, then having lots of people getting pissed off at you
---
it's just not fair!
---
Some people need to get over themselves 
---
Not a bad idea tbh
---
Rs2 turned into rs3 which I assume still has thjs feature. 
---
I just found it more manageable at a lower level.  I was willing to lose some mage gear but I was really concerned about losing tune equipment back then lol.  Not like I ever died to him, though.
---
Reading is hard
---
No they don‚Äôt. 
---
Then you should ask on the rs3 sub
---
Uninformed noob players don't like when someone who knows more than them has more informed and legitimate opinions than them, because they're unable to effectively disagree, therefore, he must be tarred and feathered.
---
What were you alching?
---
Great. More potential for dead content. Fucking idiot's
---
Never really did an ironman but my guess is to do all the quest you can and get 99 fishing the barb method then fuck it and do 99 agility
---
But you just agreed the point wasn't to max when runescape came out, now your saying its the point of every game ever. If the point is to max whys lore and minigames in the game? More open sandbox games must really confuse you..
---
200 death runes right there mate
---
Pure, on mobile
---
Pretty sure you do not profit unless you are doing slayer tasks on bosses. You more or less break even.
---
Runespan is only slow because they added a 350% xp modifier to abyss, lol and eventually added soul runes.
---
Before abyss was overbuffed, Runespan was more than double the next best training method outside of paying runners to bring you ess.
---
&gt;Calling anybody who wants to improve the game a rs3 player
---
I'm doing magic trees, and ever since farming guild coconuts have gone from like 500gp to 2000. Truly insane. This isn't relevant to your comments, I just am upset by coconut costs. 
---
They are bringing murderers, flamers, complainers, braggers, and some I assume are good people.
---

That‚Äôs Paul‚Äôs clan chat for ya

an Ironman can use 1 herb to get 99 lol. 
---
Ironmen dont get flak on here? They are highly regarded at least in my experience
---
Pretty much this, my buddies and I went in at cb 80 or so and we were fine
---
Lmao whining bitch omggg jagex plz nerf drop parties plz I need free gp plzzzzz

It doesn‚Äôt say how long the effect lasts, so it also depends on how long it lasts. 
---
*answers question calmly and politely* BRO CHILL OUT
---
I suppose. But at the amount of time and clicking it would take, I feel like they would deserve it. Regardless, easy to just not let ironmen re-grimy herbs.
---
Trial and error is how I learned which teleports to use. Glory is the most popular. Seed pod from mm2 is the best when you get it. Other than those two I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything else tbh
---
Hehe Runelite has a plugin that shows a timer on the tears easy 200+  ;)
---
Deserves gold.

---
That unregistered hypercam.
---
I‚Äôd be curious how the community would react to a partial boost reset. So, say it keeps the stat reset/restore frequency, but each cycle only recovers like 80% of current level to boosted level. (E.g. at 80, max boost = 110, re-boosts up to 104 on first cycle, 109 next cycle). 
---
Same w half the bosses in rs...

U want a bond bro?

It's about 2.2 to 2.4 after supply cost with the normal drop rate of uniques

That‚Äôs what fishing and woodcutting is for
---
Onyx bolts, probably (e)
---
I tried this in the osrs app when doing 99 fletching, and determined that it‚Äôs actually even better to run the game on your pc and use chrome Remote Desktop. I think the mobile app limits your inputs or something, as I could rarely fletch more than 2 sets of darts per tick on the app but with chrome Remote Desktop I was averaging 3-4 sets per tick.
---
Wow, amazing ideas. Some balancing would be in order, but very, very, minimal. Loved it all.
---
xp waste?
---
I believe that "No Changes" mindset will definitely become less prevalent over time.
---
Right now a lot of the hardcore "no changes" people are that way because they believe if Blizzard does anything at all to Vanilla, it will open the flood gates and they'll start to make a ton of other changes that will ruin the game and screw up the meta (sharding, WoW tokens, updated graphics, class balancing).
---
A good middle ground, if they do decide to develop new content, would be to have certain servers designated as 'True Vanilla' while active development continues on other servers.
---
Damn nice!
---
I have 22mil mining xp and no pet
---
Friendly reminder that  because one side of the combat triangle is completely busted and needs nerfed (blowpipe) doesn't mean we should make the other sides of the triangle just as busted. For YOU, spaz retard right here.
---
Dont conflict MY opinions with HIS opinions. You are calling him out for his hypocrisy and im saying why he isnt a hypocrite. 
---
&gt; You agree that these tools go against everything intended for interacting with the game.
---
I agree that WMK should be banned and so should AHK. They are not willing to ban WMK so I dont see why AHK wouldnt be allowed to mimic WMK when that is allowed. Except for 1:2+ actions, fixed jump distance, coordinates and messed up stuff like that. For remapping and mimicking the behaviour of AHK its fine.
---
&gt; He initially lied about the ban, and then made up bullshit for how he was testing the limits of the detection system.
---
He said he thought he was banned because of mass reports during knights because he hadnt been banned for what he did on stream before. Thats the confusion. He knew he did AHK and that AHK was bannable but since they hadnt taken action against him prior he didnt think it was because of 1:1 WMK mimick that he got banned. He was the first person they banned for this.
---
Appreciated!
---
Ultimate ironman btw
---
Great suggestion. I appreciate how you have one ‚Äúserious‚Äù con of it being overpowered. 
---
A slow, almost underwhelming introduction of this content with some rebalances later will get my vote. 
---
I‚Äôd rather this is underpowered with slight tweaks following rather than releasing new meta overload pots and whatever follows that 
---
I mean, having 0 favor locks a ton of content on Zeah, and this was the easiest way to show it. 
---
70 is not a high level lmfao
---
70 is not a high level lol
---
And then people dont understand how they get hacked with even authenticator on
---
He said you can‚Äôt complete the game. Lynx titan did. 
---
I think thats rather impressive mate. I never bother to do my farm runs.. even though low lvl trees/fruit trees &amp; some herb runs can net 50k/h, I just can‚Äôt be bothered. 
---
So I always find a 99 farming impressive, good job to you sir!
---
You don‚Äôt need a cosmetic pet to complete the game 
---
cons: stretched out flask icon from rs3 NO SUPPORT
---
80 runecrafting doesnt count
---
Ahh forgot to add that. I always BGS spec and almost always tele if it missed or does minimal damage 
---
Agreed, its better to start small. 
---
Farming is in no way profitable enough at 32. He can at most use 3 or 4 patches and the best ones/disease-free ones are locked behind quests or kourend favour. You break even if you get 7 herbs with ranarrs and can potentially lose money if one dies. It is not consistent enough.
---
my whole life is a lie
---
idiots*. You fucking retard.

I plugged some stuff into a dps calculator and void with blowpipe is the best unless you‚Äôre on blue dragon task with full armadyl slayer helm assembler with blowpipe.

Thanks! (:

To be fair people learning it before the tele drop nerf had the luxury of 200gp teleports. When I learned the only expensive stuff was the runes and antivenoms.

Yeah you can. You won‚Äôt be super efficient and if you aren‚Äôt raiding with friends it may be a little difficult to find a team but you‚Äôll survive it if you understand mechanics 
---
 Chop willow?

Apparently thats 11:30 here so ill probably be at sara

Are u racist or why u hating on name with "nigga" in it?

Look up wooxs or synqs solo raids guide and it explains how to do it. 
---
Pray range and he won't use the ice burst attack.
---
I did construction over the course of 2 days to get to 83 and my wrists legitimately hurt for the next few days. Started using my whole arm to move the mouse instead of just the wrist and doing stretches. Also haven't done anything high apm. The thought of not being able to use my hands properly is terrifying.
---
I really like this idea, was thinking maybe making the tinctures untradeable. This way you need to actually make these possibly new best 'potions' instead of just buying them.
---
Yes 
---
It‚Äôs more generating the sprites into item models which does take some time. Some of the details could also exceed polycounts if their mode header isn‚Äôt sufficient.
---
Also, generating a whole new system for two skill guides is inefficient, requiring intertwined systems which could later lead to update difficulties.
---
They could make items that look like those sprites and simply never have any way of acquiring them in-game.
---
It's a bit of a hack, but sounds like it'd work.
---
OSRS in general has an extraordinarily toxic community in my experience. I have no idea why tbh.
---

---
I got around 3500~ from just ardy with the diary.
---
Devalues my 0 effort farm runs and OP herb gathering method for iron memes
---
Do it man. Get Ardy elite first though 
---
If you run out of food you can just bank, run back, and then finish the kill. 
---
I will be killing revenants and hopefully land another rare today üòÅ
---
I think so, I've noticed a diff after switching to ultrac from superc. 
---
wow you are so smart, you got me! haha lied for no reason!!
---
Ardy is 63k/hr but long term most people do between 55-60k
---
There are no ‚Äúunrestricted teleports‚Äù. Up to level 30 you can use: Glory, Seed pods,Wealth, slayer ring, skills neck, Pharohs Sceptre, Combat Bracelet, slayer ring, ring of life. Home and spell book teles work up to lvl 20.
---
I thought it would have been since they didnt poll it. I would have voted yes on the coif because pures have few head gear options. 
---
Neat idea but +7 on any skill seems like a bit too much. I'd say maybe +5 at most to spare you the trouble of grinding out spicy stews
---
Shes missing a toe bro
---
If the lance goes for 100m, the claw+spear will probably go for 100m as well "you dick"
---
Get stuck into slayer. It pays off in the long run
---
Not sure about anything more than +5 boosts. They make diaries and quest requirements easy enough as they are.
---
All combats are 99 but the only Skilling one I have is fletching. Got it as my first 99. Gz man. Feelsgood
---
I‚Äôd like to know your location.
---
Wave 1/2 are honestly shitshows anymore with the achievement diary. I wouldn‚Äôt have been too upset if you left after wave 1. Happens all the time.
---
Now, once we past wave 2, you‚Äôre in it for the long haul or you‚Äôre a scumbag.
---
Making coif 1 def makes no sense. Theres no equivalent for it, it would be BIS for no reason 
---
It's 2007scape, the people here only like retarded overused reposted memes and posts whining about rcing.
---
90k range xp, not slayer. 
---
You can get 23 rc without ever touching a rune ess
---
Hey man, it's good they got it in the 1st kc, cause then maybe it can finally hold all of their bullcrap :P 
---
Nobody had a problem with AE until he asked for Jagex to change Zeah RCing to be what was actually polled.
---
The models and sprites would look different, and amongst this community would cause an uproar as players like things being identical.
---
Though it is not identical now, creating item models and then having sprites within the spell/prayer book would look very different from each other. Differential shades, rotations, the only solution I could think of is updating the spellbook and prayer book with those generated item models.
---
Haha never read this before haha.  
---
Are you fucking retarded? You get interrupted every few seconds, sometimes 4-5 times in a row. The only downtime you have is chopping the logs. Wintertodt is not afk, you're legit more braindead than wintertodt if you think it is.
---
There's a guide on wiki that sorts questing in order of stat requirements/rewards so you can do it with minimum amounts of skilling yourself. This is what I did. 
---
This image triggers me
---
double cosmics is like 650k/hr, let's not exaggerate here.
---
you don't need frem diaries. If you think about it, 1-77 rc will take u aobut 50 hours. If you just don't get the diaries and do 50 hours of vorkath instead, you'll have about 150M cash instead of 77 rc. So you'll need about 16k DKS kills (which not that many people have) to even make fremmy elite diaries worth it.
---
I am so proud of this community
---
These are invisible boosts. You cant use them to get resources you previously couldnt/quest reqs, just for getting resources faster.
---
Like chopping trees in the WC guild, you have a +7 invisible boost
---
Overload in any form definitely should not be brought to OSRS in my opinion. But there are good ideas here and I like the implementation. However my main issue is with tinctures competing directly with potions. Games are based off of decisions, and the reasons a player may choose a tincture vs a potion must be considered. 
---
OP I would love to hear your intentions specifically - when would a player choose a tincture vs a potion? To me the tinctures as they stand seem like strictly better potions or completely dead. I acknowledge the difference in stats: tinctures would provide 2 levels less than potions but not decay over 5 minutes, and potions would provide 2 levels more but decay by 1 level about once a minute. 
---
When would a player care about this tiny difference in effect distribution over time enough to switch between the two? Does it justify the extra inventory space? Seems to me like tinctures directly compete with potions while failing to differentiate in a meaningful way.
---
Farming, agility, slayer, hunter, construction. You can look up training guides to find good ways to train them or quests that can help skip early levels. You can get 35 farming, for example, just from quests.
---
You'll need em all eventually to do achievement diaries.
---
I think it may be sort of common because IIRC my pattern was either a straight line or very simple
---
Dont even bring a glory. Bring a royal seed pod which teleports at 30 wild and a clue protects over it.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Ah, understood. Support
---
Sounds a lot like me ü§î Guess im killing everyone I see from now on 
---
Slayer, definitely get agility to atleast 30, it's easy and requires nothing, and I'd start farming
---
yo that sounds good could you link it
---
y tho
---
Ooh, I forgot you had to get def xp to unlock fairy rings.
---
I assume you're referring to teas, those are invisible boosts.
---
You cant use them for quest reqs, ect, just to get resources faster/burn less food
---
90 kills per hour
---
Impressive tbh
---
His twitter post was about how he claimed he was using wmk but instead used ahk. Never for OP scripts though so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre one of the brainless who hated on him for no reason back then too.
---
Good enough. After Rcing for 43k exp pero hour, anything above 50k sounds wonderful lmao.
---
People in game don‚Äôt have access to your reddit username. Hackers might be able to link you through post history, etc to get more info about you. Perhaps be able to find you on social media. More info about you = more likely to get hacked
---
&gt;The same people asking for a RC buff think that getting 70-80 RC will mean something but it'll be the same as their current 50 RC due to the skill being trivialized by faster XP rates.
---
If their aim is to flex then you're right but if their aim is to complete diaries then it absolutely saves them time doing something they don't enjoy doing in order to get perks from diary items/passives.
---
&gt;5% faster. AT MOST.
---
This is just wrong. Maybe if you‚Äôre dealing with someone can can drop an inventory really fast the old way it‚Äôs true, but for us normal people it greatly increased exp/hour.
---
Also, if you have a bit of cash, I'd reccomend using bones on a gilded altar to get 43 prayer, it shouldn't cost too much
---
So would Harvard, I'm saving myself for marriage. 
---
Needs (kp) spears :]
---
no offense but max cape and no zeah favor? there‚Äôs a lot of fun and useful content you‚Äôre missing out on.
---
Well the videos I've seen, pures have 0 risk. The coif would at least guarantee 60k pk.

I assume youre referring to Teas, those are invisible boosts. You can't use them for quest reqs, ect, just to get resources faster/burn less food.

To me it looked like he was on his way to do the "kill KBD and open the chest in his room" elite clue step.
---
Why would this be ban worthy
---
Eh can‚Äôt really complain about soul rc xp. It‚Äôs actually pretty op for how afk it is. It‚Äôs not like there isn‚Äôt any fast options. You can do lavas for &gt;70k or zmi for 160k+.
---
You can do it with way less bro, made it to triple jads with 450m bank in about 20 attempts. Just start and dont give up!
---
:(
---
IIRC he said in a video his ideal RS time was like right when OSRS was released because he didn‚Äôt want updates or something. And if that‚Äôs what makes the game enjoyable, I don‚Äôt see a problem with him voting no.
---
It‚Äôs the tourney/unrestricted world lol
---
you didn't read what op wrote did you
---
&gt; So are non-leaderboard achievements meaningless then? Is being the first person to get 99 rcing with Air Runes not respectable because there‚Äôs no leaderboard position for that? Does doing the Inferno without an SGS become not respectable because the SGS exists? All of those things would be a respectable achievement to almost 99% of people on the subreddit, just like other achievements are that can‚Äôt be tracked per say (boss kill counts for example) Using that same argument means we aren‚Äôt allowed to add any new gear into the game because it devalues all the boss kills people have already done. No matter what you change, you are bound to devalue SOMETHING.
---
But none of those things rests on anything firm. Take PVM as an example, you dont know if it was solo or duo, dolo, etc. Highscores does this nicely because its based on actualities and not on nothings. It doesnt mean that PVM achievements are meaningless, they arent, but you cant base it on the same foundation as you can with skilling. Theres no proper way of measuring it objectively, although clans have been working on an EHB system which is cool to see and I hope they get highscores as well. I also personally dont propose for a no-update to PVM and most PVMerrs want new challenges as well, I only want no-update for skilling because I dont think its needed.
---
Highscores should actually mean something, thats why we have them in the first place. It doesnt make sense if one player can be ahead of another with way less work (if we assume they did the same skills) just because he happened to login to the game on a later date, then that system becomes meaningless.
---
This happens to me on my tablet every time I use the app, regardless of which way the screen is rotated. I've searched a lot and never saw anything about a fix. Although I have seen multiple discussions about it.

Grats brother. That‚Äôs some lottery luck right there 
---
Are you sure that‚Äôs not just me on an iPhone 5s trying to open a door 
---
H
---
You should, but it's not critical. To be honest it's all luck on how many range hits he decides to do in the fight, and how much dps you're doing. Less dps = longer fight time = a lot more chances for unavoidable damage. First ~300 kills with 99 range, regular void and no rigour, bgs-bp, I was getting at least 2 kills, often 3 and sometimes 4. Knowing when to eat without wasting time that could've been spent attacking makes a noticeable difference. Especially because shaving 3 seconds off can sometimes mean 30 seconds because he didn't hit another special phase. 
---
Something no one told me while learning:
---
Best time to eat is during the frozen crab event - you can get 2 mantas in before casting crumble without wasting a tick, and if you eat just as the crab dies you only waste 1 tick (good if you got pummelled, need a 3rd eat).
---
Once you learn to woox walk the poison stage it's very rare you have to eat at all outside this stage unless vork is spamming range a lot, which you'll never be able to control.  
---
I think you meant to tag this with humor
---
&gt;He was using multi-action scripts that moved the cursor in varying degrees
---
you sound like you have about as much knowledge about ahk as mod mat k lmao
---
I wasn‚Äôt being a dick, I literally did know know what you wanted me to answer. In the screenshot you can see I have leftover brews, reduced stats and poisoned, so evidently I did the PvM side of it.
---
You clarified that in the post you just made but it wasn‚Äôt at all clear before.
---
In response though, yes, it can all be done. Tek is the only really annoying bit due to 50 atk.
---
So you're saying that....an easy clue won't send you to the wilderness, but a hard clue will? 
---
Wow sounds like higher level clues have better rewards, higher risk, and higher requirements. 
---
is there a cc for masses?
---
Seems pretty reasonable to me, although maybe 75% might be just a bit better, but that is just opinion with no real maths done to back it.
---
Yet you still don't understand that prayer is going before the HP no matter the HP.
---
Got mine on 1 kc and I've seen several others.  Starting to wonder if it's actually more common on the first few kills.
---
Funny post! Its a shame you marked it NSFW to get more views.
---
Seems like the topic of the conversation has shifted. I said "I think he mostly cared for not making **xp rates faster like rs3**, which happened on osrs for some skills. Some skills are the same as back when he played, others arn‚Äôt"
---
I'm talking about how most skills still have the same method for fastest xp ph since the release of osrs. Like barbarian fishing, mining granite, making wines, etc.
---
Here I am at like 15 KC with nothing to show for it.

Chopping the logs is half of it so thats half of the time fully downtime and the other half is also downtime except when u get hit once in a while lmao.

You can no longer get oversmites depending on your current hp. If you have 1 hp and 99 prayer, you can't get smited, previously you could. I go to revenants skulled with +1s all the time to pk and pvm and have had clans with maces on me numerous times. Haven't gotten smited because im lowering my hp. 
---
People who would even attempt that actually have issues

Great idea, but I think these boosts should not exceed the current possibilities. Because it might be new, doesn't mean it has to be better than the alternatives. This giving smaller increases than spicy stews but still being bankable would make it more balanced I think.
---
Smiting is in the game dude, it actually works fine.  It's fair and balanced and you can negate it.  Ancient mace there's no negating it. 
---
You should be praying ranged for Vorkath. It's confirmed he hits more often with it than magic. 
---

Fortunately, all of those are already in the game. You can play that version [here](https://www.runescape.com). Have fun.
---
I haven't really pk'd yet in osrs. I plan to though. In eve, the reasons to kill someone, like you said, are more obvious. Could be killboard or could be your stuff. It's really only questioned by new players flying a trash ship.
---
In osrs, it's less obvious because most people in pvp zones that are doing pve/pvm are carrying frugal gear.
---
Here's the thing: most people play games for achievement and/or efficiency. Especially efficiency... which is why people get so upset when their time is at risk.. whether that's losing items to PKers or simply being killed while doing a clue.

Hey would you like a zuk task?

It‚Äôs 3-4m/hr per runner, so 9-16m/hr. 4 runners is pretty intensive so most people opt for 3. Price is depending on rc levels of runners.
---
I haven‚Äôt run the numbers recently but it was still worth doing ~2months ago because time saved was still in the black with free combat xp and tob pet rolls. That is assuming you have access to efficient tob teams.
---
In my case it would be worth doing regardless as I‚Äôll be going for tob and cox pets anyways post max so it doesn‚Äôt really cost me anything time wise to earn the gp as I‚Äôll be getting it passively as a result of raids pet grinds.
---
I have been doing souls until now (97) but will switch to zmi as soon as I get pet (souls is best pet rate, no point paying for and rushing rc if I have to do post 99 for pet anyway).

---
We dont like your type round these parts
---
How? you only have 130ish upvotes atm, thats only 13 wildy levels right? :P
---
Thank you. Makes me appreciate arma more after two curved bones haha.
---
I really like how they did Soul runecrafting on RS3, they could implement a similar system on OSRS but with OSRS xp rates ofc
---
Just fairly common in general it seems
---
This was my 4th zuk, second time at healers. I did forget to equip the arma skirt! I equipped full justiciar and ely when I was on the west side and didn‚Äôt kill the ranger so I could tank it. Guess I didn‚Äôt click the arma skirt when I switched back
---
Nah let's be honest, you know you came across as a dick. You could have asked what I meant but you instead tried making me look stupid lol. I'll admit though I could have been more clear, but I don't know much about raids to begin with.
---
Thank you, that's really good news. It would be fun learning these boss mechanics with that build. 
---
pm me your world and I'll give you reddit gold, no bs
---
Still, how? I logged in to RS3 a few days ago just to try the wheel and see if I get 200m so I can laugh at my friend who actually plays RS3. I got like ATLEAST 350k xp in lamps just fucking standing at the fally bank for maybe 4 mins.
---
When you die and drop your items in an area where the 1 hour timer applies, is that in game time or real time?
---
Waited for some SGS specs but more importantly I‚Äôm just not good at the game lol
---
It's against the rules to ask for upvotes in any form
---
What is the absolute max hit in the entire game? I‚Äôve gotten a task for turosks(?), the mobs which require leaf bladed weapons. With the battleaxe and a slayer helm I could hit a 58. My normal max hit is around 45. It made me wonder what the highest possible single splash dmg could be. 
---
Big mistaken giving your run energy, enjoy getting hacked.

Feel free to explain why his prayer drops to 0 before his HP?
---
Guessing every direction is random, it'd be around 1/27
---
on rs3 100k xp/hr is quite slow
---
Can you give us an example of these "multi-action scripts"? 
---
yes plz i dont like having to waste slayer ring charges every time i want to beat my pp
---
smoke devils do not drop bones.
---
You're able to boost for a Hydra kill, so technically the 93 slayer req for Smoke Devils is still the highest slayer req! :)
---
It isn't just a time risk at revs? You risk the stuff that you get as drops from the revenants themselves? No offense, but maybe play a normal account in a normal way before commenting on things as an ironman with a lack of experience.
---
It is definitely doable with less but since I‚Äôm a massive noob I didn‚Äôt bother. Give it a try at least
---
We need this nerfed. Slayer is OP.

üòÇüëå bruv roflmao who made this

Speak to Gertrude and she tells you Wilough has a terminal illness. She sends you out to find the ingredients which takes five hours, then when you get back she tells you she needs 500k to gain access to the exact preparation instructions from the snake oil salesmen, then upon bringing the vial to Wilough he rubs the oil on his feet and then he just fucking dies. 10/10 quest, would kill Wilough again. 
---
There's a clip floating around of m2k Jiggs getting two phantom rests in short succession. No wonder the guy doesn't play the character :') 
---
I'd much rather have current skills updated like this than have warding
---
Just think, everyone killing vorkath for mills was once where you are now. You‚Äôre all gonna make it bruh 
---
W00ters
---
Oh, that's right you don't have to be on task right? I guess you could boost for the task, but gotchya. So 93 :P only 11 levels for me to go... That'll never happen xD.
---
Waaaaaat ty Sir
---
Je woordenschat laat mijn ogen bloeden, eerlijk
---
I like the tincture idea, maybe making them untradeable so I'd actually have an incentive to train herb. Not sure how I feel about teas since the reason I  skill is so I dont have to worry about micromanaging things and can go afk
---
More like 8m. Runners are generally 2m an hour and 4 runners gets you 160k. The thing to look at is time saved and money gained from other sources. 
---
 Now you have a stack of scales to fill it with! Gz

I'm offended by the name row3boat.
---
Summoning wasn't bad but if rather not see it in osrs
---
Dungeoneering was fun, id enjoy it as a minigame rather than a skill though, rewards would need to be reworked 
---
potion flasks, meh
---
curses were great 
---
EOC Lol I'll take the graphics from it that about it
---
Bonds are already to much MXT for osrs
---
better graphics, absolutely please
---
Runespan, anything to make the skill more bearable I'll take it
---
you missed extremes and overloads, nex, stealing creation, fist if guthix and the comp cape
---
Prayer is affected by the mace. It will always show the prayer dropping before ho dropping. But the fact is, if he wouldn't have ate to 94 hp, he may or may not have been smited, I don't know the math behind how much points would have been taking off. What I am saying, is if he had 1 hp, prayer would have dropped first, but not to 0. 
---
:d
---
Bold.
---
My point wasn't to imply that it needs to be as fast as cooking or fletching. My point was that it's incredibly slow as it is compared to every other skill. I wouldn't mind maybe a very small additional xp per essence buff. I like the guy's idea, but I can see where it's faults are. 
---
The one thing I would love is a guild for Runecrafting. Maybe with a minigame that provides a bit more xp, in exchange for the money you receive out of it. That way, for the people who want the 99, it's achievable without needing hours upon hours to train the skill. People got jobs and stuff as well. 
---
Also, adding a mini game with higher xp gain, and less gp gain, it doesn't change the fundamentals of runecrafting, but adds something more fun and less grindy. But not make it 100% afkable.
---
Oh dear...
---
The best printscreen picture in history

Settled has a maxed UIM, A Friend hasn't even obtained max cape on a normal account, that itself is telling of how much time they spend on their vids.

Polls that pass aren‚Äôt automatically going to be in the next update. Some things take months or longer to be implemented even if they pass.

I used this somewhat effectively lol. Thank you. Used fire wave and it took fucking forever lmao. Zero drops aswell

Well, that's good to know. I'm still way off from ever attempting Inferno as I'm not max combat and I don't have max gear lol.

How much crystal can you buy with 2246 marks of grace?
---
Yes it means 3 ppoints per bone buried. The incense is made with a ranarr, so depending on how long the incense lasts you could be looking at getting around the same prayer points as a 2 dose potion would give. 
---
Depends on balancing, I would prefer you get around 2 doses worth of ppoints per incense used or less with the incentive to use it being saved inv space
---
Perhaps a prayer enhance effect would be better?

They can't update the game engine, and the team which can is working on more important things for both OSRS and RS3, like mobile, group ironman, and fixing things which are actually potentially game breaking

Is there a way to change the trollheim teleport to the shortcut below the herb patch instead of
---
The top of the mountain? I think I‚Äôve seen people teleport there but I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how.
---
I imagine this will get fixed soon if not solely for the impact on ironmen. Otherwise this will become similar to WT where you 'just get 90s magic" before even starting the rest of the game.
---
Yeah that's true. The polling system is tough because, tbh almost none of us is better at deciding what's better for the game than Jagex is. Especially we aren't good at deciding as a community. Then again polling is like democracy, it protects from occasional bad ideas of a few people (Jagex)
---
Aka they have a small dev team and there are more important things to do
---
3.5 years of occasional farming but only 2 weeks for 6M farming exp
---
This was my original intention, but it proved controversial/hard to balance so I settled on this interpretation
---
Sorry, it's not that easy. Skill guide icons are rendered from 3D models, much like how inventory icons works. Prayer and spell icons are just custom-made 2D sprites. Unless they get the engine team involved to allow skill guides to support 2D sprites, they'll have to create 3D models of every prayer and spell icon in the game. 
---
And not only that, these new models have to be rendered at the perfect angle, or else the icons will look slighly different than what they do now.
---
REAL QOL 
---
God tier guide. Jumps right on into it and has no bs to bloat out the video. All guides should be like this.
---
I disagree. Wilderness clues are still balanced around the chance of being pked. If someone wants to roleplay as the guardian of the clues and prevent you from completing your clue that is 100% okay
---
I disagree, I like it more than how much you like it. No comebacks.

Why do we need to be constantly pumping content into the game? 
---
Nice skill levels man. 99 mining impressive
---
All irons
---
When this game was made there was no intention of anyone getting 99 in anything. Why cater the game to "those with lives"? "Allowing people to get a 99" should never be the reason for an update. 
---
your account is a day old with 0 karma. And I know for a fact the tweet  is  fake as that‚Äôs my twitter account and I  never posted that.
---
U WOT 
---
Sad but true 
---
Ofcourse its a "buff"... quality of life updates change things that are tedious and weirdly coded generally resulting in a smoother experience and thus a "buff".
---
They already do that.
---
For role playing you should probably find a clan or clan chat that actively does it.
---
Its racist to tell him to change it

:-o

More like they have way more content (RuneScript) developers than engine (Java) developers. Not sure why they have such difficulty with hiring Java developers, maybe they just don't want more.

They have way more content (RuneScript) developers than engine (Java) developers. Not sure why they have such difficulty with hiring Java developers, maybe they just don't want more.
---
ah; but updates complicate engine work, so working on the system now helps, as well as the dev team can assist alongside the engine team
---
But if it takes more than 5 hours to get it‚Äôs useless.

Yeah I remember back when people thought about the questions and voted. Now everyone just votes yes to everything. I like updates, don‚Äôt get me wrong but somethings just make the game easier for no reason.
---
You can still go with either a 13 or 20 def build
---
I would recommend OBS (Open Broadcast Software). I've really only used Windows, but it should be supported on Mac. It may take like 15-60 minutes to learn how to set everything up your first time, but otherwise is pretty reliable and great to use.
---
And if you ever want to stream, OBS is what you'd want to use anyways.

For any business that's a small team.

---
Is your chat on?
---
Saw a girl selling her nudes with her snap "and voice chat if you pay more!"
---
When you get the agility requirement for the shortcut the teleport will take you up there.
---
Slayer is easy though when you have things like Hydrix Dragons that are 1m+ xp per task. 
---
I think so how do I check?

They should also change the magic icons and make them like the construction ones where you can click on them and find out what kind of runes you need to cast a spell. As far as I know currently if playing on mobile there's no way to know what runes you need to cast a spell as hovering isn't a thing. 
---
Jagex is free to file a suit in the US. The whole scenario is ridiculous though and only morons would fall for it. What a loss.
---
Pc culture 
---
Mobile is fine for most of free to play so you won't have an issue. Playing on pc gives better functionality and you can use third party clients like runelite that give a tonne off features.
---
A lot of regular players treat it as a pc game that they can maintain on mobile while theyre out.

There shouldn't be risk of your bank value going down. The only two encounters in pvm that risk your bank value going down in pvm are ToB and Vorkath, which btw, the gear you risk at revs is worth more than that. You're last sentence couldn't be more true, because I don't see you campaigning about the lack of risk outside of the wilderness. You just sound like a salty iron man who doesn't want to pay ROT the fee to use revs.

Jagex can file suit in the US and would actually be required to if the person they're suing is a US citizen. Still a dumb premise.
---
I'm not brave enough to try imagine how bad their tech debt is. I won't even start talking about how crap their desktop client is compared to mobile (MacBook Pro '18 vs iPhone XS Max - iPhone is way smoother even when limiting fps). But hey it works, and at this point IMO content developers are highly needed, to ensure there's enough content. Not everyone is going to enjoy every aspect of game, so it's kinda easy to get bored.
---
I would think that but not sure how they would manage voice chat realistically... Maybe they would sell the nudes first then just take the extra go and log lmao
---
Dunno, I guess it wouldn't be as suspicious as a brand new account? Like if you had a decent distribution of stats/quests/items on the ironman account, I imagine it'd reduce the chances of being banned for botting.
---
Although tbh, my first thought when you posted this, was that this post is just covering for yourself so that if you get banned, you could use it as evidence that it wasn't you or something.
---
Jagex isn't gonna revert it because it would lose them players. Plain and simple. And it costs them nothing to keep it that way.

Eh... I'd disagree a bit there. PvP was a bigger focus back in the day, but I wouldn't say the game was ever PvP driven. PvM has always been a big part of the game; it is just that early on there were less monsters and bosses to kill. So just like you might say PvP is lacking now, PvM was lacking then, which is part of the reason it did see so many updates to better flesh it out.
---
But even back in the day, PvP didn't get too many updates. It was more they added a new quest or boss that awarded/dropped some new gear that was used in PvP like Fremnneik Helms or Abyssal Whips; or expanded the Smithing Skill if you go way back. And we still do get those kinds of updates. So I am not sure what you're really getting at with this. Jagex is aware of the PvP Community and they try not to neglect them. We just recently saw a bunch of PvP Ingreity changes to address the issues with PvP and a lot of the new equipiment is designed with PvP in mind. So just because a trivial Pure question fails a poll dosn't mean that Jagex needs to change their approch to PvP.
---
It's one day a week though?
---
Doesn't it seem okay to have a single day where the subscribers get the perk of being the only ones to use the chat?

Having gone back and made guesses to stats and plugging it into a DPS calc, yeah ballista gets pretty bad without near BiS, and seems to not even overtake rune crossbow in the best scenario possible for it in team raids.
---
The grub thing might just be my personal experience, I felt like I was getting that 0 grub spawn at a way higher ratio since the update, maybe I was just getting lucky.
---
FYI 81% is better then 100%. Can‚Äôt roll karils bolts as a drop at 81% but still everything else. 
---
While they are changing the guides, maybe have a skills that require ingredients, show ingredients when clicking the icon of item  (similar to construction).
---
Yeah but did you see the Wiener I drew on the equipment icon?
---
Absolutely. There‚Äôs no shortage of Monty Python references already so very on theme.

Since we‚Äôre talking about it, isn‚Äôt ridiculous that there‚Äôs spells that can stop your characters movement?? And bolts that can go into bows to shoot you from far away??

Lol slayer isnt even hard or tedious.

It already takes long time to make one its really not worth it to do in F2P imo. You want to be able to use all the afk methods of members this is your alt after all it's not your focus.
---
In general though you really don't need a guide to make a slayer alt its pretty easy to do. I mean I pretty much made mine like this:
---
1. Just knock the skill requirements for quests you want the rewards from (gear, travel, skipping early combat levels) then bang out the quests. The most annoying non-afk part. 
---
 2. Do afk shit to get your combat up to a decent levels (crabs, cannons, splashing) pretty quick.
---
3. AFK NMZ until the end of fucking time. Get high combat.
---
4. Grind slayer for a quick million years  to whatever your goal is monsters are
---
5. Farm monsters make money. 1 billion years later.

- I'm surprised smithing is as low as it is. I knew it was rare and difficult, but never thought it would be lower than construction or even mining.
---
- Surprised that fishing is lower than woodcutting considering it's better and easier in most ways.
---
- Surprised that defence is so high -- higher than fletching? Wow.
---
- As always, interesting that runecraft takes the prize for rarest 99. I think that mining/agility/construction should be considerably rarer. Runecraft is bad, but not as bad as those

Are you fucking retarded? Trying to fix what isn't broken is what ''makes companies crumble''.
---
This isn't broken, isn't needed, and the work required is not worth doing. You need to work on your logical skill. You don't even have basics down.
---
225 kc and only hydra eye fuuuuuck uuuuuu
---
The last thing osrs needs is about double the amount of potions it had now.
---
Meh, not as afk as before. Although I will not touch thieving in regular osrs unless i go to 200m. At perm dmm, when new quest comes and i need cash i will do it. Still bit bitter about my 2 deaths worth of items when I recently did the tower quest at zeah... 
---
Thx I got it done. Someone was there doing 1st form and got it to 30% and I cleaned it up. Got really lucky.

Who the fuck is this guy!!! Fake new!!!!
---
I think it is telling since as an UIM you have to sink so much more time and effort in to max. For many skills you will have a cluttered inventory and you won't be able to get the same amount of xp rates that mains and other standard ironmen can get. 
---
Dovy did put a lot of time in, no doubt, but he afks a lot. Settled puts time *and effort* in. 
---
Put offers up for herblore ingredients at really low price and let them be in GE for few months. More uncommon and useless the ingredients are, the better.
---
Tons of error and outdated info. No dragon hunter lance included? Taking a fire cape to kbd? You know you lose it right? Recommending rune gloves but not mentioning barrows. Also please never take a rapier to kbd when lance is a thing that is 1/3 the cost. You're just asking to get skull tricked and have a clan follow you around.
---
Good point. I saw it on the right and auto made the distinction.

You didnt specify
---
Comrade Kwestionable knows the secrets.
---
I'm surprised so few people have smithing 99. It's one of the easiest skills. 
---
It's still so vague. When you instruct someone to TELL a teammate something I assume that means by telling them, not right-clicking an item that I haven't seen yet
---
Just useless requirements. Does the skill do anything useful in of itself? I wouldn't mind a Firemaking rework instead of a whole new skill. 
---
If I die do I keep my items? Or can I just wing it?
---
This is actually a really good QoL. As someone like me who is new to Runescape this would help a lot.
---
I'm sure it depends on your iOS version.
---
So use the organ in your head that was made for thinking and decide for yourself whether you think each suggestion is a good idea or not

Defence! :)

I'm still not settled. Me and settled started our separate series at about the same time without knowing about eachother.  
---
I'm not copying him, and we are co-operating on a lot of subjects in Morytania.  
---
I really wish people would understand that we are not enemies. I think settled is a great guy. Hope you didn't get too disappointed by this but I've never pretended to be him. Have a good night. 
---
You already posted this 8 days ago and no one cared. Are you just going to spam this each week till you get the number of upvotes you desire?
---
No not even close. Agility is the slowest skill
---
No xp waste like ur style 
---
wow
---
I'm a F2P for now, I've done some quests and have some decent armor, some due gifted me 300k yesterday, what should I do with it lol.
---
i would argue this is because its true about most popular online gaming communities :/
---
1. You're talking about Lost Tribe, not Lost City.
---
2. Yes the dialogue varies depending on what quests you've done.
---
3. No this is not new.
---
What if i wanna save some for later lmao. But also, i don‚Äôt hand my phone off to anyone, as is my right to do so.
---
Dude I'm 93cb and I'm still afraid to try fight caves lmao
---
But the first one says it's the official site!

[oh boy it's brother day today? ](http://i.imgur.com/jysJqSn.gifv)

Interesting to see that agility has fallen to 2nd last from I think 4th last or something a couple years ago. 
---
no way
---
What, you think Settled's 10k games of pest control or so were all full focus games? Do you think he did not afk a single one??
---
1666 KC btw.

This is actually better than settled's, watch it!
---
Big if true
---
wtf is this army of strawmen.
---
&gt; There shouldn't be risk of your bank value going down.
---
never said there should. no risk of bank value going down = only risking your time.
---
&gt; The only two encounters in pvm that risk your bank value going down in pvm are ToB and Vorkath, which btw, the gear you risk at revs is worth more than that.
---
relevant how?
---
Hahahaha so true
---
Can't you go to the Wise old man and let him delete them for you? I believe he won't remove the quest items that are usefull outside the quests such as the Holy wrench
---
&gt; Make an ironman

i mean i love it as well, why did i not come up with this
---
k, thanks for the help. 
---
#O
---
pls no
---
No green patch? C'mon RS, you're letting IRL do it better.
---
Yeah, the ovl is weaker than a super combat but much stronger than ranging or magic potions. So not adding it is not a problem with me
---
Thank you!
---
88% is the goal. 
---
ooooooooooooooooo wahhhhhhh
---
You got it man. It‚Äôll take a few tries to get over the jitters of Jad but it‚Äôs not so bad once you get used to him 
---
Costs a bit to do efficiently and servers little to no purpose.
---
Well you can use it to save of for a bond if you want to try membership, or put it toward leveling a skill or even some gear!
---
I posted a rough draft to guage responses and make changes before making a higher effort post...
---
sorry i forgot about the lance, but the rapier, there is nothing wrong with that, i made this before the kebos lowland updates. Ow and about barrows gloves, these are 130k... and the kbd is a LOW level boss, so this guide is not just for high levels
---
Yes!!! Do this please!
---
I feel you, today I had pet at 160kc üòÖ
---
The first few pics are my untrade able and quest items. But yeah majority of what I have are trade able stuff.
---
ya, I am going to hop on a tournament world tomorrow and start really learning everything.  most depressing part of this all is im 120cb
---
Run energy was gone too... I was freaking out
---
Wanna buy a box?
---
No idea but personally I'm not going to think about it for a longgg time
---
How do you fall for this? The syntax is beyond ranarrded. 
---
I play RS3 and I got to 93 the good ole' hard way. Remember RS3 players love to play osrs also!
---
Yeah probably around 3 bil for everything. :( 
---
The game survived because the balance of progression and nostalgia that the game has to offer in its perfect form. PvP is a big part is osrs but I‚Äôm no way is the staple in which the game has survived. It‚Äôs got the player because it has today because they have had years and years of trial and error with content in the game and a well balanced system that makes up every quality of a good mmo. There‚Äôs wayyyy to much enjoyable pvm content and skill progression that the game has to offer for it to be looked over for just pvp.
---
If you want afk then BP + NMZ + Blessed d'hide = your best bet. Mith darts, some range potions (or extreme ranges from nmz if you have some points) and auto retaliate. You're good to go. It'll be a bit more pricey for the cost of afk however.
---
Gzz mate :) I know it's common to say "literally shaking" but I was literally shaking after I killed zuk. Called my friend and my voice was wavering lol
---
Gratz man! Just got my first 99 ever too!
---
no point replying, they will check logs when they have motivation to resolve this.

The hero we didn‚Äôt know we needed.

Underrated comment
---
oh no theres def xp waste, but its multiplied by like 5 so it just looks like less lmao
---
That's what he told me it was for.
---
I don't watch his vids so idk if he's finished it yet. Perhaps he's waiting til he actually hits 99 to release it, or perhaps there's just a lot of content. 
---
How is it any different? You never have to move your mouse. Just hold down and fkey and click
---
This is in no way related lmfao
---
Firemaking was 6th rarest cape before wintertodt was released. It's now right behind fletching now lol.
---
i cant see the amount ofm axed players?
---
Pest control with chins/blowpipe (not sure if chinns are better) but chinning at shitty spots arent more efficient. You cant chin at mm tunnel withput attack xp, idk if you missed that or what you mean. 
---
Eh? How? I might wanna do it while I feel lazy and I want to afk. 
---
88 kc? Just got my first tanzanite at 1050 yesterday 
---
Not sure if you are braindead but if there are 120k+ people online at one given time, that doesn't mean there's only 120k members playing.
---
Yes it is idiot
---
Only 1 strength level to go until you ruin your account! &lt;3
---
How are they doing the animation smoothing and GPU stuff then? 
---
Even with access to ancients, chinning is the fastest possible hp xp in the game. Ancients are not.
---
&gt; rare and difficult
---
I did 88-99 smithing lately with adamant platebodies and it was as easy as wintertodt imo, probably even easier.
---
Loved the vid again!
---
Could be wrong, but I think you missed an obvious troll.
---
his music is trash
---
Let's not act like Runecrafting is hard in any way, shape, or form. It's *tedious*. It's *not fun*. It's 99% bank running, 1% crafting runes. No skill involved.
---
Removing some of the tedium wouldn't make the game *easier*, it would make the grind *easier to tolerate*, and there's a HUGE difference between the two.
---
Who these guys? The guy who made this thread did not start range yet and the other one did not chin hp. 
---
I really would love to see more skills tie into construction. The vat idea for tinctures is cool, and could be worked on in par with construction - like higher level vat yields better tinctures.
---
When sailing was seriously being thought of as a skill, I thought it was silly they didn't want it to tie into construction. Like you're building a ship, using VERY similar skills to an already existing skill. It could have been very cool.
---
&gt;Surprised that fishing is lower than woodcutting considering it's better and easier in most ways.
---
WC is a lot easier from lvl 90. Redwoods are literally 5min afkable, decent xp and you only have to drop like 5 inventories per hour. Compared to barb fishing, where you fish like 1k fish per hour, making it like 40 inventories, not to mention barb fishing being way less afk.
---
Nope. :(
---
It was possible for a little while because of a bug I believe, but not possible as of right now.
