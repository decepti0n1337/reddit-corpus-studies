Yup I have 2FA on my account and email, email only used for osrs, and password generated with a password manager. Also I obviously don‚Äôt click on fishy links. Bank pin as well which was randomized. As I keep growing my bank, I‚Äôm just afraid I‚Äôll become a bigger target. Maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid

There was a Minecraft server where you could play Runescape on the f2p world, and it was like the game where you could train attack, mining, woodcutting and etc.
---
I must be too new
---
What about raids 1 and 2, do i need magic and melee switches or just magic switch can do fine?
---
Is that an OSRS Minecraft mod?

I mean people doing wilderness slayer get emblems worth ~150k that are always lost on death so they are definitely worth killing
---
I always thought of them as like killer whales. They have something that resembles eyes, but not eyes that you can see. They use other sensory organs to view their surroundings. 
---

---
I also always thought dagannoth rex was the only one with an extra chromosome. 
---
Quite easy to get The Stuff. I have over 20 barrels of mature chefs delight thanks to it.

You dont get banned

The server itself does this on crowded worlds to not strain itself. You can't change it unless you go to a non crowded worlds AFAIK

Ahhhhhhh makes sense

Rune? Seriously? Black pickaxes have lower weight and you only need the pick to get through tunnels. Idk why anyone would bring anything besides a black pick.
---
It would be longer than one piece and even slower paced lol
---
I think West has said that rework Shayzien and Lova houses are on the list next. With what he's done with the Hosi rework, I am more than excited
---
Seeing this after WGS is kinda feels ;-;
---
I forgot how chaeldar used to look so different.
---
Very nicely done art! :D
---
on the bright side, your stats are low enough that you can do almost anything and improve your account. I'd say work towards barrows gloves and then firecape. after that, yeah slayer is good and you'll want it eventually, but there's enough goals you should focus on first
---
That happens with ALL players, in ALL worlds? I honestly thought that only occurred on bounty hunter worlds, or if you already had an emblem on you.
---
Holy shit dude, are people allowed to be proud of their achievements?
---
What do you define as crazy amounts?
---
OSRS already isn't oldschool anymore with items that were released post-HD update. 
---
I mean we've got dragon claws, gloves that are better than barrows gloves, shift-click dropping, 3rd party clients with an insane amount of plugins that make the game much easier to play (and also makes the game look like a spreadsheet with item overlays and tile markers).
---
It's funny and you're a crybaby who came back five days later lmao
---
They did get a slight overhaul with the seers ring buff. Not to mention archers ring is worth quite a bit. Ironically, its the ring I never get of the 4.

Opposite here. RL plugins don't mean much to me compared to the atmosphere OSHD brought with it.

Also lets be real here such a client would without a doubt get plugins that RL and OSB have.

why 2 options though?

It‚Äôs more afk if you run normal rumble with super combats. You only need to click 24 times for a 6 hour session you‚Äôll get like 80k an hour

---
will do, thank you good sir.
---
yea for real. the roads are 5 tiles wide. Nowhere else is it that wide
---
Spec opportunity I suppose? It adds 10 to the max hit potential, making speccing someone when the bolt procs a little easier 
---
To be honest I think I'd prefer an official version of [Gudi's Bronze Man Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNfa2saOJg) over Iron Man Mode that could capture most of the same concept.
---
I get the idea behind Group Iron Man but Bronze Man Mode could emulate something similar by making it so you can only trade with other Bronze Men if you both had unlocked the items being traded through other means (such as one of your party getting it as a raid drop, thereby allowing you to trade duplicates amongst one another as long as you do instances together consistently). The only other thing they'd have to keep in place is not allowing you to pick up other player's mob drops unless you pked them out of their inventories.
---
Sure you'd still get the benefits of PKing and the GE but those are all opt in and still have to be 'earned' as long as you don't wintrade drops.
---
Using runelite theres an option named inventory viewer I think
---
Yea I kinda expected to get downvoted. People upvote nooby questions in this thread because they think it‚Äôs cute and mine is clearly not nooby lol
---
Thanks for your input. With the mod Jed stuff happening, I‚Äôm a bit paranoid but I guess all I can do is stay on top of my own security and hope (or switch to default client)
---
The lure one? What part does he talk about the level 3 bots? I don't remember that
---
If and when you do come back to the game I‚Äôd recommend setting goals that aren‚Äôt luck based, I take since you‚Äôre doing barrows that means your account isn‚Äôt maxed, Ive recently been working on all hard diaries after finishing my quest cape. They‚Äôre attainable goals that have little to no rng. Also if you have the stats for it try a boss like vorkath or zulrah, you can make a tab in your bank strictly for the loot you get from the boss, and although you might be unlucky with the big drops it‚Äôs equally as satisfying to watch your bank tab accumulate millions of gold worth of loot you can eventually cash in on 
---
Ah ok. Didn't know there was gambling. I'm pretty new tho so haven't got very far away from lumbridge.
---
I'll have what hes having, DM me OP.
---
I think there‚Äôs a niche of content for everyone to enjoy in the game and mine for sure is clues. I‚Äôm not saying that I could enjoy *just* doing clues, cause that would get preety stale after a while. Switching up content is key to enjoying the game!
---

Good point

Man, you just can't get enough lol

Would still be nice to have an option to have HD graphics

Dragon hunter lance and all the alts camping rune drags with it play a part too. Not that I‚Äôm complaining it was always bound to happen lol

Of course they are. Are you implying that a cheese cape is an achievement?

for anyone else interested, please email treeboyosrs@gmail.com
---
You‚Äôve got a good attitude! I think a lot of people who play OSRS often could learn a thing or two from you. Variety is the spice of life and that‚Äôs no different in Runescape, but finding a niche and filling it is always satisfying and gives an inherent feeling of individuality. If I were you, I could safely look at those 10000 clues done and say ‚ÄúWow, I held myself to the grindstone and accomplished something great‚Äù. Thanks for this post and thank you for the concise replies.

How and where could i look up my country's community? I'm argentinian.
---
I mean what got me to return to runescape was for 2 reasons.
---
1st: I realized I could do ANYTHING in runescape and I've always wanted to be a blacksmith in videogames and sell my wears like a real blacksmith and proudly know someone's putting it to good use.
---
2nd: I watched some youtube videos about OSRS especially https://youtu.be/p7a5PIQYFec helped me get back into the game after tutorial island.
---
This changes everything
---
LSD BTW
---
Missed a perfect chance to have your groin be the grand exchange.
---
some random came up and traded it to me so i graciously accepted
---
Wholesome
---
highly depending on prices I guess. It's good now but it will be less good in the future

We need a OSRS Isekai 
---
At a little over double your KC, I have twice as many drops as this single chest, and for less gold.

Nice luck, keep it up!

As a man going through divorce at the ripe age of 25, marriage dont mean shit.

So I could just play an unofficial hardcore?

Oh boy, here we go.
---
Nothing in kourend feels right, imo it looks like they built it in Minecraft and then ported it over to RuneScape 
---
Runescape has the lore and world build potential to have a strong animation series for sure. Some of the quests could even become episodes. Imagine a Recipe for Disaster arc...
---

I also no life rs, and im depressed too. Welcome home boi!
---
Can't wait to beat my letics.

You can't click items though, just visual

uhh...yeah? absolutely. if you actually want to play the game mode then you can just enforce the rules on yourself. simple enough.
---
name out chekcs
---
Why is settled in this? 
---
Imagine having money for a dhcb lol
---
monkeys works cause you are always hitting the max target with burst/barrage. problem with using it at pc is you'll almost never hit max number of targets cause they don't spawn fast enough/people killing them.
---
Sweet, came back to the game a couple weeks ago via mobile and been trying to make friends. All the cool people I met so far never log in =(
---
Ard those 3rd Age Longswords?
---
Swampletics upskirt lol
---
So say with an attack I hit 4 different targets, would I get 4x the exp from the cast?
---
More of that anime style dunce plox
---
If you aren't an iron man just grind it out lol
---
Lord, this is well above average lol
---
Lmao. Care to answer the question?
---
Episode 3 - We've unlocked so much cuntent
---
Food + mage prayer + dhide should do the trick assuming you weren't in the 70-90 combat range with maxed pures.
---
Fishing is slow as dirt. Im fishing for karambwan so I can cook em after for xp. Is there anything faster that still gives me cookable fish? ie not barbarian.
---
You get xp for every point of damage each cast does yeah 
---
You need skill to do diaries and raids.
---
I was around 70 combat when this happened. Not sure what the other guys stats were 
---
You'll get sucked in and before you know it 2000 hours have passed. Osrs is like cocaine, get out while you can.
---
Have you seen caveman only? He's the og swampletics
---
I feel like a war room would have an oversized table to allow for strategic planning on maps. You should be grateful you get such an impressive specimen of a table for a mere $11/mo.  
---
There are definitely pure and main multi clans still around in pvp. However pvp is not the most updated thing in the world due to minority playerbase. I would definitely say give it a go.
---
The 'plan' is keep OSRS MTX free (except bonds, those were voted in by players (\~3m for 2 weeks of membership or $7 AUD per bond)).
---
I never saw any tbh
---
Unlike the rest of us who get laid at least every 2 weeks
---
Isn't the best thing to do just immediately x log when you see a clan come running with dspear?
---
At first I thought this was a joke. But now I see these people actually get their pepe wet to this stuff. 
---
Or just sick of hopping, decided to take the world of the lowest level as that would be easiest. Nothing personal. Not everyone is the living embodiement of Satan.

Dw mods took care of it and deleted this dribble thankfully 
---
With the stats he posted he‚Äôs facing maxed gmaulers who are going to ruin him. It‚Äôs either a long road ahead to a mid account with beefy stats or starting over and making a pker. 
---
Pretty sure West wasn't hired until afterwards.. I think it was mod Alfred who did the mapping (he went back to school not long after so he probably didn't have that much experience)
---
Not for zulrah but definitely if you plan to branch into more pvm
---
It is really good money, once you get the boots. That's usually the catch with money-making methods like raids and clues.
---
You could have membership without paying real money of you buy bonds
---
I'm doing my periodic play again for a little while (just missed twitch prime, rip). What launcher do people use these days? OSBuddy? Runelite? What are the pros/cons?
---
KempQ's 'Playing Runescape properly' is definetely a good one. UIM Verf makes vids on a Karamja restricted UIM and a main UIM.  J1mmy's 'By Release' is good aswell.
---
The barrows gloves are the real accomplishment here tbh. My fire cape took 2 hours, I've been grinding for three weeks for b gloves. Grats tho!
---
Runelite is the top dog these days. Has pretty much everything OSBuddy Pro has and more. If you download it, make sure you're getting it from the dot net site which is the real one.
---
This guy has the most silky smooth voice on earth. Should record a podcast or something. That‚Äôs why I sub to his channel. Can‚Äôt get enough. Not in a weird way.

---
Oh shit rofl you‚Äôre right. Tbh I didn‚Äôt read his stats lol. All I saw was can my account be a pking account and 1750 total lv lololol

You can make a 60 def obby pker you‚Äôre pretty close to that.

You don't really need skills to do raids, if 1 player has them to make pots you're fine and other than that you can still do it without
---
Ah didn‚Äôt think about that.
---
Was more thinking about if someone attacked me and I had ice barrage on autocast and someone else was nearby or under them. Or the same thing with a scythe (or any other multi-target attack)
---
Gratz broski
---
Can you talk about details here? Size? Price? Stuff like that.

What if I retaliated with a multi-target attack?

I wouldn‚Äôt mind a cross over just for the shits and giggles. I‚Äôve often fantasized about it

Came here expecting crab memes. Wholesome post warms my jaded heart. Ty. 
---
Yoooo congrats, dude! I got my first fire cape in my 14+ years of playing runescape just this morning! I know how you feel. Feels good! Next time have jad unlocked for slayer tasks and use an imbued slayer helm. It'll make it a breeeeeeze. :)

Yeah I‚Äôve been using Karils top and bottom, neitz, anti-dragon shield (with anti fire), rcb with ruby bolts (e), bandos boots, warriors ring. My stats are 77 Attack, 81 Strength, 77 defence, 84 ranged, 65 prayer, and 75 magic, 
---
Using saradomin brew, ranging potions, and Super Restores. 
---
But why would you keep the rest of the gear and not upgrade to dragon defender? Lmao
---
When I used OSBuddy a couple of years ago they had a setting where you can set goals under the stats tab like multiple levels ahead and I really wish Runelite had that
---
source plewse
---
Just clarification, the melee void set gives only 10% damage and accuracy, not 15%. Still definitely worth bringing if you use blowpipe.

You should this is awesome!
---
Nice, How long did it take?
---
Hahahaha 
---
I considered that. I was going to start doing either vork or zulrah. As I thought about it, I had two options.
---
1. Take the time to learn all of zulrah's rotations, dying quite a bit in the process and losing a fair bit of money, which I don't have much of in the first place
---
2. Take what I already learned about Vorkath while doing ds2 and use it to get going on making decent money right away.
---
I chose the latter. Besides, I needed my assembler.
---
https://imgur.com/eoVlBvI.jpg just got 61 attack on my zerk. Can we please fix this thanks

i has this one friend who went staking. they said if they made it to 1b they‚Äôd give me 50m. ended up making it to 4b and then only wanted to give me 5m. i said nah, forget it. they kept staking and lost it all. i was glad.

It could go either way. No way of knowing if this id true without more information.

I believe we are all an equal part of the same thing contributing to the greater dimensions of our consciousness, working toward a neutral peace without the constructs of ego, opinion, good and bad, love and suffering, self, etc.
---
well i don't really have all the twitch streamers' account names memorized
---
Why
---
Stats and gear seem fine - I used Sara dhide instead of karils, and mantas instead of brews, for the higher healing per click, though lower per slot. Plus I didn't have to worry about chugging restores and ranging potion after healing. I also used a bastion for the defense bonus since I didn't bring brews.
---
Is there a specific phase you keep dying on, maybe?

Is true?

Honestly though who actually wants to see shit like this lol

Lmao this is hilarious, is he really pretending to get hacked so he can pretend he wasn't the one botting? No jagex pls you can clearly see here I made the post on Reddit that said I got hacked. Never mind that the bot was logged in on the same Ip Address that the account has always been played on 
---
I think the algorithm for filling your inventory is at odds with this, and I‚Äôm not sure they could do that without some sort of engine work. Maybe Runelite could make a plug-in for that or something? 
---
I too read the LN "Meet Swampletics, my Morytania locked ultimate ironman. After recently maxing my ultimate ironman I decided to up the ante, and forge my own journey from scratch."

How could you blame constipation for being missing from work for 30 minutes if you were aware of how much time you're spending

Its because you are using resizable mode if you switch to standered it will change

ore bank is for banking ores and making masterwork armour....

What is there to know? The game is retarded lmao.

No bonds is bc the free membership twitch prime promotion is ending

Imagine not buying dhcb when it was 25m lol

It all makes sense now.
---
You can also swipe down and see your battery life but that is shown in the osrs app.
---
Yup it‚Äôs retarded that a skill in the game creates some of the best power armor to use. Completely idiotic.
---
3rd Age is 3rd Age haha. And to get it on the first clue is still amazingly rare.
---
Call me crazy, but I reckon knowing if your device is going to die while playing is a tad more important than knowing the time.
---
Are you okay?
---
The osrs app even shows your connection like it shows when you swipe down. So it shows battery life and wifi/data connection but not the time.
---
Naw if he never played before f2p will be enough. There‚Äôs enough f2p worlds these days

this reminds of me of a reddit post I read awhile ago several artists said the only reason they draw bdsm, feet, and furry porn is because it sells more than their original/preferred SFW art. Zuhaar is a great artist but it's sad how his most upvoted arts are the ones that are sexualized because that's what r/2007scape would rather see. 
---
Then justiciar with occult, suffering i, eternal boots, ma2 cape, tox trident, mages book, and either karils top/bottom or arma top/bottom.   
---
Alternatively, go full justiciar with either kodai or trident.   
---
Maybe look into the wiki as well. 
---
Perfect for tanking in GWD as part of a team or pkers at black chins or wilderness alter. Also good for getting aggro at popular bursting spots. Other than that, not much use because OSRS is built around DPS and not defensive capabilities.

I saw after and a lot of text and thought this was going to be a swampletics thing, but good for you bro

I mean, Thursday is update day and Friday is when a lot of people have time to give feedback on content. So it's more the substance of the post that attracts the interest rather than the time of the day. If you post something off topic during a meme wave or complaint flood then nobody will even read it. Thanks for the data though.

What if it's ashes from a fire? I'm an ironmeme, and I was doing shade of morton. Needed ashes, so I just took an axe and a tinderbox with me, and I light my fire while I'm doing the quest.

I no longer play osrs but I seriously do not understand the logic behind hiding poll results. If you can‚Äôt see the poll results why even bother voting. Jagex could legit do whatever the hell they want saying that it was voted for and the player base would have not just allowed it but would have begged for the transparency to be taken away. Stop complaining about something a game developer has done to give you evidence of actions they take. That is a rare thing to have in a game developer and the reddit community is complaining to have it taken away.

Is it viable to do zulrah without switching gear? I‚Äôm on a budget and I want to just bring trident and either ahrims+serp or just void gear. I can use the extra inventory space for food, I just need the one kill for the diary. Thoughts? My stats are 90 hp, 88 ranged, 80 magic

Runescape is an extremely dense game. There really is so much content, I would just recommend using the wiki as much as possible to help guide you. I would also recommend doing quests, but I realize some people detest them

Stop being so obsessed with pussy, dude. It seems to be quite literally ruining your life. Girls can sense desperation and they will be repulsed by it. So keep lifting, take care of yourself, look for a job in construction or maybe look into a trade school and you'll be fine. Also I would suggest getting off those meds ASAP, everyone I know that's hooked on those things are miserable. Good luck out there.

You should probably do celastrus and plant a palm or papaya. The seed is so cheap that the average hard contract will pay for itself, especially celastrus thanks to the battlestaves you can craft, AND is effectively a reroll. If the next one you get is, say, watermelons, you've effectively gotten two rewards where before you would have gotten one.
---
Assuming the worst case scenario, a celastrus is a 50k loss. This is assuming literally 0 good seeds from the hard contract, and the minimum amount of bstaves. But even in that worst case scenario, it's worth doing because the next contract might be worth 100k and cost nothing, say pineapples.
---
Plus you actually gain more celastrus seeds than you use when including them in your contract.
---
The same reasoning carries over to palm. Palm seeds are just 36k. Less when you account for the 6 coconuts you pick after checking it. Assuming again, a contract with 0 good seeds. No yew, magic, maple, palm, dragonfruit, redwood, celastrus, torstol, snapdragon seed. It's still worth it because of the reroll.

Its not gonna be every weekend, and how is double exp for non combat skills a bad thing? I dont see it.

To get better at it, get all the drops, max your skills, do everything.

It's for special attack. Or if you don't want to level construction. Change your house tele to outside the portal and do bosses on the the house party works. It only takes a few extra seconds to drink from the pool.

specifically really sad about how every dungeon made by the OSRS team is just incredibly bland. theres such a contrast between tavernly dungeon &amp; catacombs or rev caves. every single dungeon they put out singe launch is like "heres a room with several monsters followed by a room with several more monsters". its so depressing

No, its little over 13m from 1-99 so if you were to manage 1-99 in 96 hrs then the double exp weekend would therefore reduce that time in half, and no not double the exp to hit 99 you get double the exp from the skill you're training, say catching lobsters award you 90 exp per catch, instead it reward you with 180.
---
If you didnt deal with it on the day the update came out you are basically fucked now
---
Oh, I thought you meant it would take double the xp. Your idea sucks.
---
730 meds no rangers btw
---
Yes, Dragon crossbow with enchanted dragon bolts should be alright.
---
I would argue that you should plant whiteberries and ultracompost (supercompost if you're cheap). The reason being exactly that poison ivy never diseases. If you get a poison ivy contract, you can remove your whiteberry and plant poison ivy and not have to worry about it. The other way around, you have to worry about whiteberry dying when removing poison ivy to plant whiteberry.
---
That way if whiteberry does die when you're on, say, a watermelon contract, it's not a big deal because you can fix it before it comes up in an actual contract.
---
Just still for stats one quest at a time. Looking at them all can get a bit over whelming. Quest cape is definitely a good long term goal though.

Everyone makes the same argument about everything..

Yeah everyone is opposed to removing the effort from an effort based game. Wild.
---
Hunter 17, btw.
---
Dude, its just a damn idea, no need to be a dick about it. Besides my skills are perfectly fine I have no problem with not having double exp, I merely wanted a discussion and to hear said peoples opinions, all you literally needed to say was "awful idea"
---
Ya I know that too. It's too bad our bodies best solution to avoiding issues on a cellular level is to just give them a lifespan.

It's to make the person on screen be seen as a friend instead of a guy in a video you watch.

Instead of some guy reading a script you now have a friend video calling you with stuff both of you love. It feels more real even if it's just as scripted.

Im a structural engineer and this tent makes me sick. The span lenght between one column and another is as long as a redwood tree, thus making this shit completely illogical. They could hire someone with engineering knowlegde before designing a tent that is a size of a castle.

How about trying an ironman? I did that and it completely changed the way I played, gets rid of that GPscape feeling.

OSRS wiki claims 308 dark crabs per hour with diary done.
---
Absolutely not. Terrible idea. Like they said before it‚Äôs a slap in the face to someone who achieved 99 or 200m without it. Just because people are lazy and don‚Äôt want to grind a skill and take the easy route. This game is meant to be a grind. Even 1 double xp day a year would be bad you could easily get a 99 if you started at a decent level. Shit idea. Play RS3.

You choose. 
---
Typically players are broken down into three types but everyone enjoys different things.
---
PVM = I like to kill boss monsters, get better and better gear and chase the rarest boss drops.
---
Skilling = I like to see my XP go up and make progress towards "maxing" (Getting the max level in each skill)
---
PK'ing = I like to make a specific type of account build tailored to best fight other players.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt work at Carl jrs if you paid me....wait 
---
Yeah but I wanted you too realize HOW awful it was to cause me to feel the need to be rude.
---
  
---
You put no thought into this and it's just bad in every way. This "discussion" is just 80% of the posts telling you how stupid your idea is.
---
Alright, you got me. It would completely destroy every buyable/bankable skill. And only half destroy every other skill.

200 xp till 18 left btw

I just miss logging in one day and seeing "Holy shit Ritual of the Mahjjarat came out today and there are these new monsters, Glacors, and they drop these cool new boots." I get you wouldn't want new BiS gear coming from an unpolled monster but I wouldn't be opposed with a new slayer mob being released like say gemstone dragons, there could be different tiers and they could primarily drop gems and be decent but not great profit per hour. All of a sudden we have a new fun task to do and a new way for ironmen to do crafting.

I play the game, doesn't mean I have to have my nose into the community and this sub reddit 24/7 I have a life. I am an active player doesnt mean im active and diving into the community all day long, there are no awful questions, just awful answers, you didnt need to belittle me all ya needed to do was stat that my idea was horrible and why you didn't like it and go about your day, anything else is unnecessary everyone has different opinions even if they all are different then mine, I wasnt rude to you or anyone else so no need to be to me, besides maybe you are right everyone would hate this, but the said 5 people who commented on this post isnt everyone, and im not gonna lie I dont know everything or even alot about this community, theres no harm in posting about a topic like this, this is how you learn about what people like and dont like, same thing as chaotics or old minigames like souls wars for example, a decent amount dont want them and some do, how do you know this information you ask about it, I dont care if you despises this topic with a passion, all I care about is you being civil and not a dick.
---
Thank you very much! This really helped.
---
Wish I could tell you more, but google is your friend here! 
---
why is it that people say slayer is the best way to train combat? is it simply because you're training two skills at once?
---
Man. When you are well known for pretty much exclusively (at least now what you are known for, yes I know you do non lude work) for the sexualized art. When you draw a female staff member on her knees with anime girl bubble butt looking up at mod ash, who has a sword at hip level...
---
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but are you really that perplexed as to why that piece was perceived as sexual?
---
I mean.... you really only see the first two questions right away. It takes actually effort to look at all of them before voting....
---
Thanks bro its cool
---
Like 2x faster
---
Nice try neckbeard.

Yes, quests are a great way to skip the early levels and unlock tons of content for the mid and late game.
---
If you have the money Id get one of these: Team Cape Zero, Team Cape i, Team cape X 
---
Best looking capes u can wear in f2p imo.
---
No problem!

Team capes are f2p right?
---
I used to wear a gold team Cape, looks dope.

Also if you get rune (g) it looks pretty cool.

I've read the questions many times and I still have no idea what they're trying to ask. The context did not help. What is ironman only content suppose to mean, like fishing karambwans and crafting through charter ships?
---
suprised pikachu
---
You keep making the same argument to everyone. "It's only 48 hours". 
---
If this was introduced into the game, why would you only ever want it for just one weekend and then never again. What is the actual point of introducing this into the game.
---
Maybe just play the game like normal and put in the effort rather than hoping for a 48 hour (yes only one weekend as you keep saying) shortcut?
---
The people who achieved 99's through pain and effort should never have their achievements devalued by suggestions like this. 
---
An ironman that only plays on half xp weekends
---
Like a new type of ironman that receives half exp?
---
I'm not too familiar with zulrah, gonna learn him soon myself. However you can practice him in tournament worlds, then you won't spend anything on supplies and have nothing to worry about!

I got mine st 5kc lol

I had a similar experience the other day, only I was the one giving a drop back. Was killing greater demons in catacombs, and some guy that was killing abby demons got a tooth half drop. Not much, but I ran over there and picked it up. Told him "Dude, you got a drop. Sure you don't want this?". He responds, "Oh fuck, was it a whip???". I reply "No, just a tooth half. Come here when you're free."
---
He killed his demon, came over, traded me and got his drop. He invited me to a CC that I still hang out in today. Chill guy.

You real lucky it‚Äôs your cake day

&gt;The highwayman told you to stand and deliver when already dead
---
Lmao the pker equivalent of telling you to sit
---
The idea was that it would be for the whole game. Everyone would get half xp for a weekend.  There could be a type of ironman with half xp. Imagine the content that could come out of it! Double the wintertodt grind!
---
Oh well at least it wasn‚Äôt something worse! I‚Äôm just a poor boy trying to get blowpipe haha

Hope you actually got it!

report it and move on. There was Amenity clip about those being in wildy also. not much we can do about it besides warn people and report.

I think all you need is ds2 for ferocious gloves and dt for ancients with base 90 combats. If you scythe/chin/barrage mm2 tunnels you can probably get a ToB account in 2 months. 
---
That was a solid translation, I'm surprised
---
That also came to mind for me
---
ok bye
---
It would only be if introduced 1 time a year, I do just play the game normally im not hoping for a double exp weekend,its not a suggestion its just a discussion post, youre acting like it takes away the pain and effort, as if double exp is like a walk in the park, you still gotta sit there for hours on end to reach 99 depending on where you start of course, its just shortened.
---
yeah i played about 1k hours on osu, got to top 100 NL, played 2.5k hours of TF2 and a fuckton of Minecraft
---
Bout to get 1k in EU4 aswell
---
o and i have like 1250 hours in runescape now aswell
---
Nope
---
That's assuming they don't have something like Oracle installed. I doubt many work places have that I've only seen it done at schools 
---
Wtf
---
Use runelite, there's a plugin that displays price on hovering over the item.
---
What boots are they?

Do you even have admin rights to your PC? There is a decent chance you would not be able to install OSRS in the first place.

Waterfall and the Knights Sword are the most impactful.  They'll give you 30 attack, str and smithing.

Doing the tourist trap and using both XP options on agility is a good way to skip the early agil grind.

You don't understand, I would attack a monster far from him and he'll come SPRINTING across just to hit it, I tested it multiple times by switching monsters after one hit. He did it on purpose

What motivates you?

Its more like state your opinions and talk a little about it, thats it! I know my post isnt special or whatever, I posted this because I was thinking about it, theres no harm in being a little curious, its not like this was a suggestion just a share your thoughts thing.

iOS does disable your apps on the background so it saves battery life so that‚Äôs why your osrs disconnect

Stop sharing your account. Problem solved.

They also have ads that say ‚Äú2007‚Äù and ‚Äú2019‚Äù with two side by side images and the ‚Äú2007‚Äù one has players coloured slayer helms and full graceful. 
---
Maybe. Just did that to make it match the right click collect items option 
---
Hard to say right? The only guy in the shot that could probably hit someone with a combat level matching that gear isn't even skulled. So I would say fake but still pretty funny
---
Dwh for sure, im 6k dry with 1 curved bone. Im burning out
---
What are your combat stats? There aren't really any requirements. The fighter torso requires 40 Def, however. 
---
More likely to be the empty slot from the rare drop table.
---
I was thinking of skipping rune plate and going straight for torso on my uim. This could be just the thing. I might drop by in a few days!
---
Just use the scan thing instead of a code

I dont see how you were lucky, its a 50/50 on 3rd age in elite caskets
---
Your gear setup is pretty solid, if you die a couple of times consider switching to d'hide ahrims with a serp helm and investing in a ring of suffering. The added difficult of trying to learn where to stand while also having to remember to get a new recoil or repot for poison can be cumbersome. You can always switch back over to void once you're more comfortable.
---
Maybe theres a misunderstanding.  I meant the button is helpful if you have say 6 items you just bought. And need to use them straight away. Aka quest items. It's much nicer to be able to click the button and collect them all unnoted instead of manually going into all 6 things to collect them unnoted. It's just a qol suggestion lol

I did not share my account with anyone, but I know you have no reason to trust me.

That's an awesome gift but 2 things really annoy me about it, likely more than it should.

1. North is not up on the material.

2. The recurring thought of "That's gotta be an extremely infurating map to use. "Where is the ranging shop in Varrock? Idk, check my right calf"

naah.

5 minutes if you're not interacting with the game and not in combat

20 if you're not interacting and are in combat

6 hours if you're playing actively

If you're doing nechs with an alt. You lure the nechs on the alt and pick up the loot while your main barrages. This gives a window of opportunity for Venezuelan gold farmers to pick up your loot, which they then in turn directly RWT.

I'm glad to know that I wasn't the only one walking around asking everyone what my combat level was lol
---
Eh, if a skill has a +3-4 alternative I'll usually go with it. Can't be bothered to catch a bazillion rats to get enough spices for the number of tries it takes to get a +5 boost.

Will there ever be a support system in place to reinstate Hardcore status to HCIM who died due to disconnections?
---
People lose hundreds to thousands of hours of playtime to DCs constantly and it makes the gamemode, which is one of the most watched content on youtube/twitch, seem inherently flawed. 
---
Obvious limitations would of course be that the death did not occur to another player and each death would have to be looked into, so that you cant just pull your plug after you die and claim it was a DC. I think it would make the gamemode alot more popular.
---
I believe the developer mode features are only available for developers and certain content creators now tho I could be wrong.
---
Not hard to be #1 when no one plays anymore
---
It‚Äôs actually profitable due to the ranarr and snapdragon seed drops. With the missy keys you‚Äôre about 18k on average per key, plus you bury all the big bones for a bit of pray XP on the side

Every wedding has the Wop, Gas Pedal, Cupid's shuffle, and Wobble. What RuneScape emotes do you suggest?

Best in slot capes for melee, ranged and magic all have better stats than their respective bis helms. This would literally be a downgrade for all situations.
---
I hope they answer but I know in my heart they won‚Äôt.
---
Maybe in some cases.  I've known a handful of people who only got worse when they started therapy/medication. 
---
at least rework challenge mode, more mechanics on olm, for example white circles on range phase, falling rocks randomly every now and then... etc. and MORE points.... crrently it's worse points/hour than normal mode and only worth to do if you have the pet...

Not to be overly-dramatic, but I would literally die for Roo

Oh damn sorry. Next time! I had jad trapped behind italy rock. I tanked all the healers in blessed dhide while attacking jad and switching prayers.

\-  ‚ÄúUnidentified minerals‚Äù from Mining Guild are currently useless after  240 (cost of Expert mining gloves). Could there be more content added to  Belona store i.e clay pack, gem sack or something similar?
---
\-  Prayer training altar. Idea would be to add a f2p quest to introduce  using bones on altar for more exp i.e \~100%. Currently this is used at  p2p POH altars up to 350%(still best solution to train prayer). This  would make more clear that bones should not be just buried for f2p  users. For f2p currently best option is to bury giant bones for 15exp,  increasing this up to 30exp at altar would not break the prayer grind  and could be balanced with location between altar and bank (for example  make Edgeville monastery altar usable for prayer training after a new  quest. Distance between monastery and bank is long enough). Overall  prayer training speed would not increase drastically, yet people would  be introduce saving up bones for altars by a quest

\-  Wintertodt damage scaling to reasonable level, when? Just plain bad and  punishment for players who are high level. \*beating a dead horse\* If  its meant as a ‚Äúmoney sink‚Äù its not working as people just use wines  that are near worthless. Why not just add deposit box for 50-60k/h to  enter and remove the damage at all after you have warm gear.

Any chance it could be made so that when plank-making via the butler, when we ask to repeat the task, we could remove the last 2 lines of dialogue? Currently the sequence is 1, space, 1, space, with him asking if you want him to repeat the task and confirming the price. Needless to say, if you‚Äôre making thousands of planks, you know how much an inventory costs.

My point is if there's a +3 boost available, I'll just grind the extra 2 levels and use it over the +5 from stew. I could still get +3 from stew but at that point why bother if I can just get a guaranteed +3 from something else?

I just wanted to know if there was a cc so I could hop into it really quick. Sell my items. then get out and make note of what the cc was called. People doing konar slayer and not skipping inefficient task locations could benefit, and runners could be an easy profit.

I'm not planning on making a cc for it, was just curious if one existed so I didn't have to bank.
---
It was a drastic change. Weapon atk speeds, no more maging while in melee cb, moving and eating while in cb, multi and non multi zones, no more fatigue, running, and ranging while in melee are a few changes
---
thank you, I'll definitely check on that

Could you halt new content updates for a month or two so you can work through the large backlog?
---
As much as I want this, it's probably more work than you'd expect. That duration is most likely decided by your phone's OS depending on the "long tap" duration. If that is indeed the case, they would have to basically re-implement their own long tap to offer custom durations. Depending how they've set up the input handling on mobile, it would probably be a pain in the ass.
---
You can look into your specific phone and see if there is a way to reduce your long tap duration in general.

In some sense quality control but not of the whole product. Just parts of it. And given that 99.99% are ok anyway, I kinda learned how to multitask in my job over the time. Never missed a faulty product yet so I guess it works.

Nah, for me it helped because I was at rock bottom, gave so little fucks I wouldn't even tie my own shoelaces, and it helped me relearn how to set minor goals and achieve them in aid of an even larger goal. Those little dopamine bursts help a lot. But you just gotta know when it's time to transfer that goal making scheme to your real life and quit the game. That part can be hard without self-discipline

I dont think you understand how many twisted bows this is gonna spawn.

There is no way to implement this reasonably. In other games with HC-mode, such as Path of Exile, people constantly die to DC's, lag and crashes. They never get HC status back, it's a risk players choose to take.

But infernal cape is better than any helm you can equip

I'm guessing some people just sell it off to get a quick buck.

Wintertodt as a whole needs a major revamp, just removing damage to make an already overpowered activity even better isn't the fix it needs.

Saw a level 60 something burying bones in the GE the other day and I had to explain to him that he can use them on altars for way more xp and he said he was a new member and his mind was blown. I agree a f2p type thing introducing it will be very good for new players.
---
Also please GOD give me the wintertodt scaling please. I have 99 fm on 2 ironmen cas I was 10hp but don't have it on my main because I have 99hp and it's the worst, so I refuse to do it.

Tbh i havent watched your first few episodes, but ive always been wondering why you arent considering using dharoks, i'd imagine ist way better dps then torags Hammers and  you can use it in pretty much every room you Need melee; e.g you can intentionally get hit by flies at bloat to get low and deal good dmg, at nylo you can stay "lowish" health aswell since you you have pretty much no Chance of dieing if you pray right, tbh i dont know how it would be at sotetseg compared to what you got planned for him, could also be a bit risky because of melees, maybe you could make it work at xarpus since ist melee defence is substantially lower then range without def lowering specs, and i can see it work at verzik too since it's a slash weapon.

Sometimes running and trying to right click a fairy ring at the same time I have to hold like 1-2 seconds before my cursor goes over the fairy ring to right click it. I can‚Äôt right click while I‚Äôm hovering over it as it takes too long for the drop down menu to open and by the time it does, the drop down menu opens the option to walk here on the grass a tile or two away. I fully support this and I hope they add a change.

You talked a few weeks ago about making member skills non-member, so if the community voted to make a P2P skill F2P and you *had* to do so, but they didn't pick which one it would be, which skill would you choose and how much content from it would you open up to the F2P game?

The skill capes have good bonuses. Its not a downgrade.

Most realistic use is black chins.

Saw a suggestion on Reddit the other day it was a 'ring of disconnection' as when you d/c the ring teleports u as like the ring of life 'non wildy or pvp' I think that's a decent idea to help prevent losing status as returning a hardcore just seems wrong otherwise won't seem so legit but this ring idea I think is decent

It would probably be best to have the slayer helm (i) bonus and void bonuses non-stackable.

Don't say that, I dont want to think about that. What would i do with my life? Be productive and.. play.. other games?
---
A good point, and a fair one. 
---
I agree the cape needs a new perk, but this just ain't it.  I think the perk should be something regarding task selection, maybe 1 free skip daily, or a preferred task to make one task 2x as likely or something of the sort.  The cape is nice but when you have to rely on "hoping the effect works for the next task" is just not right.  Another option could be similar to RS3 how you could use some ring or something else (i forget it's been a while) and get 2 tasks at once, and choose between the two for a small price either in gold, or slay points (again, forgot...)
---
Want to go ahead and get 83 hunter on my uim.  Maybe more since its my favorite skill.  Going to use the red chins as early as 60 range.  If I use the suicide method on uim while theyre in looting bag do I lose the chins?  I know a pve death while theyre in my inventory or equipped I will.

Hydra tails are not seen as valuable of a drop to receive from Hydras anymore, besides for the Bonecrusher necklace. I was wondering if there could be other uses for the Hydra tail. These are my first 2 ideas:  
---
 
---
Can a Hydra Tail be used to receive a hydra task (limited to one every 10 regular tasks to maintain slayer balance), plus an option to extend future hydra tasks? This could help with the problem of spending slayer points trying to get the task. If the extension were cancelled, Konar would require another tail in order to ‚Äútrust again in your capabilities‚Äù for another extension. This could first be unlocked at the slayer master if needed be.
---
Due to its rarity, can Hydra Tails be turned in for a ‚Äúkey item‚Äù half towards a chest with 5 Alch Hydra re-rolls (One for each head)? One of the rerolls would have a small chance at a unique drop, except for the pet. This could help players get the last piece of the ring or give additional resources to Ironmen. (The chest element was recommended by Mod Ash)

I'd much rather them fill the gap on the far right first. Having an XL phone is great, but not when there's load of empty space.

What are your thoughts on updating achievement diaries to include new content? For example, adding ‚Äòslay a demonic gorilla‚Äô as an elite western task or ‚Äòwield an ivandis flail‚Äô as a hard/elite Morytania task. The award for recompletion could be an exp lamp giving half the exp that a regular completion gives. This helps achievement diaries stay relevant 
---
Granite make you look like robot
---
You give up the cape slot though, which arguably has better gear than the helmet slot. You can use void, but max strength is usually better for melee and you‚Äôd have to not use the ava‚Äôs devices with range. This would be really good for some tasks, but I don‚Äôt think it would be overpowered.
---
Why does the Augory provide no damage benefit to magic like Rigour/Piety do for Range/Melee?

What are the plans to expand Slepe, Meiyerditch, etc.? Is an Agility course still in the works?

Void elite helps but normal void at minimum is a must.

B gloves/New Avas are important, and the rest of your gear depends on what GP you have!

I got a dudes whip this way and I gloated about it to him was pretty funny
---
I don't know where you are looking but green dragons aren't good training. What level are you, combat wise?

It could, but range without avas gets annoying or very costly, with melee void you give up a lot of strength bonus, and mage void is pretty bad compared to other mage gear.

I just couldn't give a fuck about this cringelord replying to me to be honest. Feel free to care more and reply again though. 
---
No. Play resizeable and ~1100 raids.
---
Fair enough, we appreciate that.

On behalf of all of us here, you are cordially invited to go fuck yourself.

Way of the road, bubs
---
Basically, don't stress and enjoy playing the game.
---
There is no correct way to play and shouldn't be a pressure to get members.
---
Thanks, thats a bit helpful. Just seems like Ancients isn't worth it anymore with how little you gain by using it over the other spellbooks compared to how much you lose by swapping to ancients. Especially with Fire Surge being a base 36 with Tome of Fire, 6 more than Ice Barrage for roughly the same cost.
---
I did 50 runs didn't get a single thing. Decided fishing is way better money. I think I made the right choice. 
---
Good money maker for f2p kills imps for mind talisman and beads. For whatever reason mind talisman was selling for 2.5k last night yellow beads were 1.5k and the others around the 1k mark
---
Ladies and gentlemen we have a liar. I can see his spade pile from here. Vote no on pvp polls.
---
Your not wrong my total isn't very high compared to my combat stats. https://i.imgur.com/Lkb6E7J.png
---
 ‚Ä¢ Can you guys look into removing the delay when you equip the **ancient wyvern shield?**
---
‚Ä¢ The **dfs** and **dfw** don't have negative defence bonus when fully charged, in the other hand the wyvern shield has a **-5 range defense bonus** can this be changed to be on par with the other 2 shields?. 
---
this guy is lowkey speakign some truth but hes getting downvoted, if youre dealing heavily with depression rs07 isnt a good way to get out of there
---
And you can freeze and do way way way more things on the standard spellbook as well, all while also having a base 36 damage spell in Fire Surge with a tome of fire, which is 20% more damage than Ice Barrage. Seems like Blood Barrage is the only thing Ancients has going for it nowadays.
---
Hes funny, and the more attention osrs gets, the better.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry to my Ironman friends, it makes up being unlucky elsewhere 
---
ye but what after TBow? Youll want Max, after that play ironman etc :( it's a never endign grind
---
Has anyone ever seen Serene and Mod Ash in the same room?
---
Good question hope it gets answered
---
honestly you dont even have to train it, just do 1-9 at museum, and 9-x at birdhouse runs whenever you feel like doing it. A run takes 1min and gives decent xp in the long run.
---
Ice Demon has a special mechanic, you hit like in the 10s with any other attack but in the 60s with Fire Surge.
---
Agree, it's a dragon item. For me dragon weapons always stood for having a spec. As a f2p noob that was the coolest thing to unlock. 
---
Do you have an example I can listen to? 
---
So she knows the game is called runescape which explains the runing, agility was truly a lucky guess, and she thought the pickaxe was a scythe, hence harvesting.
---
&gt;You could walk off Falador castle
---
Same update that introduced runecrafting :thinking:
---
Yeah it‚Äôs already in the game..
---
Compared to the whole of runescape there isn't that much content in the wilderness.  There are a couple wildy bosses n demibosses,  rev caves, elder chaos druids, and some skilling methods.  Whatever profit ratios you think you can make in the wild there are equatable or better not in the wilderness. 
---
That being said the better part of the wildy pvm is for the most part they don't have any requirements besides the gear needed.  There will be pkers at hot spots though which includes, elder chaos druids, revs, kbd entrance, lava dragons, n wildy bosses. 
---
You said you are 89 cb, what is your slayer level?  Can you do brutals, gargs, or wyverns?
---
Take a look at [this.]( https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide)
---
They don't want barrage to be any more powerful than it already is
---
Could you remove the bank deposit items from the bank deposits (If they have that disabled for their bank)
---
Also for the love of god can you make it possible for leprechauns to stock pineapples or watermelons for compost bins. There's no sense in having to bank between every patch on a herb run.
---
Those boots, pride scarf, and rainbow phat is what I skill in
---
Watch [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NSur4bZ4qvo) and hopefully you won't hate it as much. 
---
Ice Barrage freezes for 5s more which matters a lot because if the freeze wears off too early at Muttadiles then there's a far higher chance of it healing.
---
Is this done on purpose?
---
I have brought this up several times, but i will keep doing so. I want more then anything else some kind of more public facing construction method. I love construction as i love skills where i can see the effects of my build up, but i dont like leveling construction. It makes me feel less like a master builder and more like a table fanatic with commitment issues!. What i'm asking for here is some kind of Constriction mini-game and maybe it could be in Prif and use the proposed crystal trees. On a slightly lesser note i would love  for the skill to have a solid use outside of the house, maybe something like building buildings for your kingdom or the like.

bigredjapan is the person who designed the agility rooftops. OP is referring to that, not the saitama cosplay.

Why do you as game developers choose to ignore some issues that the community has? Wouldn't it be better to give an official answer instead of just letting us meme for years about it? ü¶Ä

Slayer does not need *any buffs* of *any kind* for a very, very long time. The current perk is already quite good. It sounds bad but if you consider that 10% chance makes it equivalent of weight 26 or so, you realize it's actually already good AF lol.

200IQ hackers would somehow extract his account creation location or something from the video and then shoot Jagex and quick text to clean out his account instantly

Good for you man. I use OSRS to fill the grieving period when I get depressed, too. All while making positive steps during my productive time, of course, which it sounds like you did too.
---
Definitely a great way to set perspective, distract, think iteratively, and accomplish short term goals. Don‚Äôt mind what the emotionally impotent naysayers are whining about.

Do Piety, Barrow gloves and all those sort of items work?

Imagine coming back to the game and seeing the DHCB for 20m and researching to find out its garbo, so you buy an acb. Only for the DHCB to be buffed in 2 weeks. Feelsbadman.

If you know it's a overused trash post why do you still post it? 
---
That manga is probably some hentai shit you fuckers drew.
---
If you have a decent healer sure. I've definitely seen beginner healers not being able to keep up with someone lower than 50 hp and low defence. I think it's definitely worth getting some extra hp levels (which costs almost no time at that level anyway) to make it a little easier on the rest of your team.

I would have loved to have seen that. I like to do a similar thing with clockwork penguins, but it's not a duplication glitch, you actually need to make a load of them, but it's funny to watch them run around a small enclosed place.

If only we could have joined the penguins in the Cold War quest series instead. Bring on the penguin invasion!

Would it be possible to pay gertrude to provide a kitten care service where she will raise a kitten for a fee?
---
To balance this, the time it takes for a kitten to grow into a cat would be doubled in Gertrude‚Äôs care. It would also cost 100k (Or whatever amount deemed reasonable) for gertrude to look after a kitten. The fee is there as to not devalue the 200 death runes people might get by trading in cats. 
---
This leaves the original way to raise a cat the fastest and most efficient, while providing a time and money cost alternative. 
---

---
Just finished 82 to 92 fishing at minnows. Xp varies between 45 to 50k per hour and profit is about 21M
---
Yeah thanks, it's just annoying for a lot of PvM and skilling content where you have to switch up between right and left clicks often.
---
For instance, Abyssal Sire requires you to click "walk here" to run between a couple squares (so you don't attack the spawns) and is basically impossible on mobile.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs just a goofy and fun joke and there‚Äôs no way they will play everyone‚Äôs songs. Probably just pick a few of the super popular ones or from people who are most important to you.

Also if you don't have friends to share exp group on monsters above your level don't bother it's too grindy. (still less stupid grind than rs tho)

Those stats kind of suck for pking even if he was to stay a pure. Too high prayer and attack.

If you turn on "one click" (iirc) in the settings it makes it to every tap opens the right click interface.

Yeah to be fair the false positives are much easier if you‚Äôre transferring lots of wealth many times. I looked at the post again and it said they traded the gold back and forth like 4 times which is sus.

Does repairing the lamp really take that long? You just bank, grab the bulb + wire (both obtainable in bulk without much effort), then Dorg Sphere teleport until you're in the general area of the lamps and you're done.
---
Fine a fuck ton of body runes at 99 lol.
---
It's a lance made from Hydra claw which is dragonkin so not a dragon item, just a dragon hunting weapon :p
---
Currently 80% of the people in Castle Wars are afking at the home base just to get easy tickets. Would it be possible to add activity timers (like in Pest Control) to make people actually contribute? Camping homebase makes games really slow and fights outside bases rare. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs because of the twitch prime promotion, free membership. Hopefully will be less soon &gt;.&gt;
---
I've seen a dex a bulwark and an arcane in 80 KC. rng has to even out somewhere 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre just flat out wrong. This is how people pk in the wild. Ice barrage is essential and you also need a tb‚Äôer if you‚Äôre close to level 30. If anything the normal spellbook needs a rework. It‚Äôs damn near impossible to tribrid on normals. Just because ancients isn‚Äôt used at Chambers doesn‚Äôt means it‚Äôs dead content. It‚Äôs absolutely essential for ToB. 
---
Certain QOL updates, such as ditch removal and color of certain items, shouldn't be polled (especially without hiding the results so we don't have bandwagon's created to pass certain ones *Cough* SPARC MAC *COUGH), what's the OSRS developers plan on moving forward with such updates? Are you really so afraid of player backlash that will result in nothing more then angry messages with next to no impact to your revenue as long as you understand the meaning of 'QOL'
---
Revs too, unless it‚Äôs a huge clan but then you‚Äôll have a few extra seconds for your life to flash before your eyes 
---
Hum? What did they do now?
---
How though? I don't see it having castle wars or trouble brewing reqs lol. You can't really "complete" those.

This makes me uncomfortable. Imagine standing in that much uugghhh, no thanks.

Will you be doing this tomorrow too? I saw your thread about it last week but most of the time I play after 6pm PST. Ive never played BA and need the queen kill for the diary. I even considered doing the BA services but they charge 8M.

whoever has those accounts just never logon Jagex will forget eventually and you will have the rarest account in RS

Chaos Altar Prayer training too, I see it there all the time whenever I run by for Clues
---
Why not make them "charge" the gloves for an additional buff to exp/add rune as an option?
---
The ignore list is your friend
---
While this can be true this game has been there for me when I felt nobody else was. I could vent and relax thru my love of this game. To each their own but RS has always been there for me when I was feeling down about myself and I feel like I can actually do something right even if it‚Äôs just a video game.

Real mvp for taking time to resolve this

Why rat yourself out you fool

Do you even know why he left? This is a stupid post.
---
Base 80s with 67 RC lol nice
---
This is kinda dumb.... it takes 4 clicks to unnote items from GE dude. Literally 4 clicks. The bank is one tile away and you want the devs to spend time and resources coding in that? When they could make way better simple QOL changes or even work on bigger issues? This isn't a QOL change, this is being lazy and wanting to remove 3 clicks in an already very easy unnoting process.
---
If you need an emergency holdover, you can use runelite inventory tags and make your own colors outline the items of your choosing
---
You just right click on the inventory bag once the plugin is on and choose "tags" and then you can right click items to pick 1 of 4 available colors you pre-make.
---
They dont even want to add a MAX CAPE, let alone a COMP one retard
---
Yes i know why. They can move jagex closer to his home.
---
Could you give us a rough estimate when raids 3 is coming out? 
---
Here we're talking about 24 accounts, 14 of which have already been fixed. The rest we'll catch up with individually when they're able to come online :) 
---
I‚Äôm not against them, but a ton of people I know won‚Äôt do vespula, and some hate vasa
---
i understand that, but thats not what i meant. The right-click examine option is basically player x has slain x general grador or player x has x exp in farming.
---
Congrats OP. That‚Äôs a huge milestone!! I‚Äôm still working toward my first 99 in game. I‚Äôll get one one day ;) 
---
Could very well be the case, tedious work like this is something you would get your intern to do üòÇ
---
whoever has the other accounts, never logon and you will have the rarest account in RS history
---
I'm a big fan of the RS3 mix of Trinity, but that's also one of my favorite OSRS songs. Barb Wire is also pretty good.
---
Returned relatively recently and certainly haven't been back around long enough to train RC. What's at 77 that makes it the turning point? 
---
Yeah basically, maybe like the fletching interface but with a horizontal scroll bar so you can scroll through the items, then it "remembers it" - dunno, all i know its outdated AF compared to other skilling interfaces

I was expected another "Meet swampletics"

Let‚Äôs make it so one click on tinderbox on a log burns the whole invent for you, let‚Äôs give 10k xp per runecrafting run, let‚Äôs triple the xp rates of all skills across the game. We can all take it to the extreme mate, then again you‚Äôd probs vote yes to all of them cos you love ezscape

It would have been perfect to rotate it a bit so the Dwarven Mine was right over the crotch instead

But cats are a lot cuter than scam links and fire capes

You can craft Blood Runes. It's done differently than other runes and it's a lot more AFK. 
---
OSRS was released in 2013.
---
The first time I saw the rune shop in Varrock, I had no idea where everyone kept disappearing to, I figured if I typed the 'incantation' that appears above your head when you tele it'd work. 
---
I spent a good 15 mins writing down that stupid phrase, waiting each time for someone to tele so I could write a small amount of it. 
---
Needless to say it didn't work. 
---
The second part was a death sentence for your chances of getting a reply
---
Most employees have at least some affiliation with the game, it would rather be a pro than a con to hire someone from one of the biggest PK clans.
---
go to w310 lumby and they will fix it afaik
---
Maybe introduce like a weaker TB style spell for f2p? Like if TB is too powerful etc maybe introduce a spell that gives a teleport a 50% failure rate so you can get a potential TB to keep in the spirit of the rng based pking we use without making it completely broken?
---
Enjoy your impoosible ironman pure. 
---
Oof nvm,

shitty but true

It lets you get to Duradel faster, right at the moment when you can instantly teleport to him!

Not really a mercher. Just feel it's ridiculous just having a few hydra tails at the boss and having to either straight-up sell it at ge or collect dust on an Ironman account.

I was just wondering that if you're looking closely at these accounts for potential RWT? Obviously these accounts are now very unique and if they don't contact you or accept the increased Defence exp they could be sold for quite a bit of money. Do they have to manually accept an Exp Lamp, for example, or can you force the defence exp on them when they come back online?
---
Fyi anyone responding, it's not that serious
---
Yea, but the downside is that warding is basically runecrafting, but instead of runes you get armor, and it would cap at mid-tier armor like mystic...
---
Too many glitches and fuck up lately. Stop bringing RS3 mods to the osrs team, they‚Äôre clueless.
---
Congrats! Farming on mobile is a chore for me so more power to you!
---
Lmao just what I was thinking. What kind of clown show is this game turning into? These fools must not use test servers.
---
I'd also say that, but then again, their database rollback procedure should be synchronous and it isn't, so I wouldn't be surprised.

Dudeeeeee you could have had such a sick account if you didn‚Äôt make this post

Void is faster but has less def, I‚Äôd only use it if you‚Äôre experienced

Yep. It's like smoking crack.

I did fine with 80 range and rune cbow
---
Nah, for the same reason as the dragon Hunter crossbow - its special is passive which makes it strong already.
---
Yeah that's a fair place for it. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely possible. I have a 20 def account that I did my first 40 or so kills with trident and dragon crossbow with diamond dragon bolts. Kill times are like 4 mins but it‚Äôs fun

I really like the idea of a runecrafting blast furnace. I'd gladly burn runes if it meant getting more xp.

I kinda did this too.

I tried to type "Senventior Disthine Molenko!" to see if I could TP to the Rune Essence Mine from any location.

Any chance on getting gilded gloves? Would be nice for fashionscape since the yellow gloves dont go well with gilded things :(

For them I‚Äôd say minimum 70 range for black dhide and rune cbow. They don‚Äôt need much else if you‚Äôre 93 range with decent gear 
---
[But they already added a Max cape?](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Max_cape)

Have there been any discussions on bringing minigames such as Soul wars and Stealing Creation to osrs?

Coincidentally, 6.8m xp is 92 so they might've made a typo manually setting XP and added an extra 5 or something

Why do you say I'm geh?

Buy BIS for everything which is like 3-4b and then do whatever youwant with the rest. If you ever come back you have everything you need, if not you still gave away/staked like 2b which is a lot

Right, I said 90 as the high end and they're standing in like lvl 35 wild. You'd assume wizard robes are going to be lvl 20-60ish, but could easily be more. Assuming a pking group has a min lvl req is a bit of a stretch also.  You have to remember how deep wild this is
---
I‚Äôd say u should RWT most of, if not all. If not all, definitely leave yourself with enough to actually do stuff on the game (500m-1b) if you return

Okay still. How many players are using their service an hour? That amount is divided by those benefiting, let‚Äôs call it 5. The paying players wouldn‚Äôt do so if it wasn‚Äôt less than what they‚Äôll make at revs in most cases, so let‚Äôs call it 2m/hr. 
---
I understand that the fee structure may not be hourly, but it can be broken down to fee/hr for a $/hr comparison. So for every person using the service, ROT leaders (5) are making &lt; $0.40/hr. So they would need somewhere around 20 people there at all times, 10 hours a day to make the US minimum wage.
---
Obviously this is super laden with assumptions, but even adjusting the numbers ROT isn‚Äôt making a killing irl off this.

Yeah and say 1m was bet on tuna and 500k on swordfish. The person fishing has a tuna and swordfish in his inventory, drops them so everyone can see he's not holding any fish. Then he fishes, catches a tuna. Drop the tuna, pick up the swordfish he dropped, profit. It would be really easy to fake, but then again people trust bots picking *random* numbers...

This game and everything that's changed in 6 years is what we ask for
---
Could the grand exchange take platinum tokens from your inventory as long the the item your buying matches exactly?
---
I was listening to the intro of killing in the name of on the radio as I played this. It was absolutely perfect timing
---
Can Bryophyta's staff be changed to hold more charges, or perhaps there could be some way to upgrade it to hold more charges? Currently it only holds 1,000 which doesn't last very long at all if you are alching a lot.
---
Lol yeah, I am that girl for sure.
---
9 quests.  Plus an extra 4 Rods of Ivandis. I'm nothing if not persistent. It's only my second slayer task, and I couldn't figure out how to give it up. So I just started doing it.
---
I think they accidentally made Occult necklace overpowered, and are scared of further compounding the mage creep
---
Ya all of my 99s and all my quests we're reset too, Jagex plz fix kappa
---
I would think they keep probably a weeks worth on site. They probably (any company I've worked for does this anyways) have archives offsite that they can get at for even older data.
---
Torvesta be like "there is literaly nothing i can do'' 
---
Its possible to level your combat to level 40's with just quest rewards. Also questing helps you figure out a lot of stuff about the game and locations of things so my vote is for questing. Aside from that id go level a skill you can get some money with like woodcutting or fishing.

February taught us to wait til the end of the month

What gear are you wearing? Why veracs helm and skirt? Why not dhide or even better blessed

---
It‚Äôs pretty much honor system but if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll pretty much get blacklisted in a lot of clans and eventually it will be hard to find people to raid with 
---
Kodai is great for slayer though.
---
You're right. There's absolutely no way to pick up a different fish or rig bots picking numbers. Oh how you have enlightened me sir, carry on your mission and teach the world!

I‚Äôm so confused by that website. Jebrim has 40mil agility xp in one day for an ehp of 414...
---
OSRS Mobile launched in November 
---
Because we are addicts
---
They're betting on an animation that you cannot fake...... Not about what fish is in his inventory you fucking retard.
---
You can do Slayer to make money or any profitable monster. Use a blowpipe or cannon of you feel the revenue is going to exceed the costs of using those methods. Obviously you want fast exp and to make money but those objectives can't always be tackled at the same time. 
---
Or you could find a great money making method and grind that for cash so you can chin to 99 ranged. 
---
When it comes down to it, you need to figure out which is going to take less time and become more valuable to you. 
---
Any word on pvp polls getting any requirements?
---
Are you on mobile? I've had this happen and relogging fixed it
---
O.o How so? Like "girls don't exist" or "will you be my runescape girlfriend?!" Because I'm a married lesbian and I just ignore those lol if it's misogynistic jokes, I dont mind.

Or he was saying that at GE and got caught?
---
Hey OP guess what, fuck yourself

He has 76m defence xp now. Not sure if another fuckup or what hahaha

LOL what the fuck

Know what else you should identify? A fucking problem and avoiding it for once. Is jagex HQ located under a giant pile of cow shit? Because the mistakes that come out of there are no different
---
lmao. /u/JagexGambit posted in a different thread that it's been sorted on about half of the accounts so far... yet 35 minutes later from your post this guy still has 76m def exp
---
Since when does curfew not matter for NCO‚Äôs? Lol
---
Unit tests are still possible, but this isn't that big of a deal.
---
wear the coif instead. a difference of 9 ranged accuracy is worth losing 2 prayer bonus for. if you kill stuff quicker then you can turn off your prayers sooner, and if you can wear barrows armour then you have at least 70 defence, so tanking the rangers won't be an issue since you also have the blowpipe spec to heal you.
---
otherwise that gear is fine. archer's ring can be imbued, fury can be upgraded to anguish if you can afford it, and don't forget to wear a blessing with the blowpipe since you don't use the ammo slot, but none of these are required. 
---
He still never fails to satisfy every woman he meets.
---
You can join the runelite discord and ask them there 
---
You're the kind of dipshit to virtue signal on the internet huh?
---
Quick question if you have a moment Gambit - I had also posted my account on the thread for pures affected by the glitch but it doesn‚Äôt look like anything has been done on it. Any idea on how I should follow up on it? Thanks!
---
Yo, saving this for when I get serious about my slayer grind. Thanks for the write-up.
---
‚ÄúNot many‚Äù

"and a Warrior will be do best when fighting against a Ranger" Oh Jagex, you never change. Or learn English.
---
I'm not out here to worry about my friend - I know him in real life, his parents included (who are heavy christians so would definitely not like him scamming anybody, video game or not) plus I don't plan on swapping a lot anyways so I wouldn't expect he would, but again - even if he did he would be in deep shit.

---
Wilderness rejuvenation idea: 
---
"The Great Hunt"
---
Have a ONCE a day event where a special Tier 10 emblem spawns in a random location in the wilderness in all BH worlds simultaneously. While in the Wilderness on the given BH worlds an arrow displays on the minimap showing the current location of the emblem whether on the ground or in another player's possession. The emblem will prevent teleporting for the carrier.
---
The special Tier 10 emblem can be either traded in for the normal point reward of a Tier 10 or a 50k exp lamp from the BH NPC.
---
To make it interesting their should be a system message that appears 30mins prior to a "Great Hunt Event" that counts down for all players regardless of world.
---
Let's say your a content dev. You already know how to make items that give xp, therefore it's an easy fix.  It's removing the XP which seems to be hard and that's what they scuffed up on.
---
Well they also added an extra 0 and gave 10x as much xp...so they scuffed up both.
---
p servers

Not defending Jagex but gold sites have a lot less customers than Jagex does.

Uh oh

lol nope, whats offensive about 'cancerous' anyway? sure, not too good a thing in concept or reality, but it's a fact of nature. 
---
But he can‚Äôt equip the helm
---
Because this isn‚Äôt runescape.support.com. This is reddit. 
---
Enough to complain about it. Plus that ones that don't.  
---
&gt;Not many use wilderness for income or training unless theyre in a clan or paying a clan
---
This whole statement is what is not true though. 
---
Yea. Maybe some people actually wanted to start training def.  Unlikely, I know, but you can't tell intent just from someone getting a def lv or two.
---
A Farm Brother, Congrats mate.

I bet you were LITERALLY so excited to win

Out of sheer curiosity, what happened?

Your best shot at learning is making a baby pure as the gear risked is much lower.
---
Rip your account kiddo
---
This post was made by the account recovery gang
---
I don't think it would get implemented, but I do think that the market efficiency of the GE causes some problems, such as the disappearance of traditional trading/skilling spots (seers village bank+bank second floor, al kharid to sell cowhides, for example) and it definitely makes it very easy to dabble in flipping because there's no real danger of taking significant loss, and no real danger of accidentally paying too much to somebody flipping because you jsut set it and forget it at the GE while you skill or whatever.
---
I really wish that was the case. I can't figure out how though.

I believe wolf bones are a member only item.

Hey Honor. If you're one of the pures affected by the original XP bug a few weeks ago, you can expect some comms on this to go live on Thursday in the update newspost
---
As far as bans, you have nothing to worry about.
---
They're only just now starting to fix people's xp. You probably have a couple weeks wait still
---
Jmods have been ignoring this sub for weeks 
---
Do I have to check all my stats now when I login to make sure they‚Äôre still good?
---
Btw my 99 rc is now 32 for some reason... üôÉ
---
He's talking about honor bridding where they don't use overheads. Only mains really do that, it's pointless not to use overheads on a pure. 
---
They added an extra 0 to his xp is my bet. Imagine if these people worked in a bank. At least it wasn't an item like the archer ring fuck up.
---
Dude is probably too exhausted at this point to react fully. He‚Äôs been grinding the fuck out of that place.

shutup ;-;
---
Complain about what lol
---
Second statement is true.
---
It happens exclusively in PVP worlds, typically at Edge Bank and Camelot. You won't really find anyone bridding without overheads except maxed mains, so you're not going to get away with risking under 500K basically. 
---
Nice I need to do this soon, I‚Äôll hit you up. Thanks! 
---
Delete day post before u get flamed my man

That link doesnt work

Still better defence stats than pure gear.

In pvm you dont lose untradeable items

It's more logical just buying them unless you want to gamble with time and money

Bob's death was shit, man. An iconic fixture of the game, the fucking *Jagex cat*, killed off unceremoniously for some cheap shock value. I'm salty about it.
---
I'm saying enough people do these wildy pvm because we often see the complaints about dying on here.
---
It's really not. It pretty much only applies to certain rev worlds. Most notably the 1750+ ones.  It doesn't apply to any other wildy activity. 
---

Pker here, Jagex decided to save money we only have one alternating world every two weeks where the ping is worse than dial up AOL back in 2008 despite there being 300+ servers now
---
Gj 
---
kind of depends how much money you want to spend. you're (give or take) 450 games of wintertodt away from maxing firemaking, so you can make some serious money if you want to do it that way, or you can just bank your resources to fund some levels in the other skills.

But i'd be down to do it. Im a hobbyist graphic designer and would be a fun project.

No one on this sub does bitch.

People like you are why there are folks with rune platebodies out there.
---
&gt; when you take off your auth, and add a new one, it resets all the "code" that was previously used within the last 30days. If your account got hijacked, can just do this so it forces them to get another auth code.

I can just imagine the lootations

Can we not post this so the admins don't have a reason to attempt to shutdown this sub because of edgy dipshits like yourself.

Not gonna lie. Was looking around the screen than I should have for $11 memes.

Nice.

Wrong game to flex a phat set
---
Id be willing to donate like 5 mill if you help my pure get a torso?
---
Do you take the dose before the fight or when you get venomed?
---
A party hat set is 46k
---
Dont mean much anymore? How is 2M+ not much? For a second I thought I was in the RS3 sub where whips are alch value..
---
Or are you comparing it to a time when whip had it's OG spec of hitting 0, or hitting your max hit possible? The time when it was worth more than p hats?
---
Oh yeah? Well my Dad would totally crash your dad. 
---
Maximum kek
---
Are you praying the triple attack? I don't have experience ranging it, but I believe the main reason ranging is viable is because the tbow hits so hard on it.
---
fuck outta here with this garbage repost. we didn't like it the first five times it got posted and we don't like it now.
---
Tbow bug was in February, not March.
---
Was that in the catacombs? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw the interaction go down, I mean I saw the tooth half drop but not the convo 
---
Dude. You literally read my first post wrong. 
---
I said someone. Aka 1 occurence. Also all that stuff is irrelevent. Point was b gloves and co had def reqs added because of a bug. They didnt match tourny worlds. Sorry i didnt write up a 5 paragraph essay on mobile just to give your ignorant ass every minor detail
---
I recently came back to the game and started an Ironman and those are the two I‚Äôm most looking forward to since they‚Äôll be the first quests on this account I‚Äôm doing for the first time.
---
Congrats on the cape. :)
---
Fuck off, asshole
---
Hahaha, buddy, they will find a way to make this game breaking. 
---
are you sure you didnt log into a different account created with the game center rather than your email/username login?
---
Damn son. 
---
The thing that makes Runescape so comforting is knowing that no matter how bad life gets, we will always have Runescape :).
---
Your rules say you'll never reach out in-game and only through the messages on the account page on your website... 
---
How do you get this hp bar and pray bar on your view? I do not get this
---
For Dagganoths you would be best to be using protection prayers with high prayer gear. Proselyte would be best and isnt too hard to obtain.
---
You probably want to look into getting a fighter torso because it provides the best strength bonus short of the bandos chestplate which is fairly expensive. Higher strength bonus means better dps which will get you through things faster. 
---
As far as weapons go you'll probably want to look into doing Monkey Madness to unlock the d scim which is a substantial upgrade over the d long. Its faster so again it'll give you big dps boosts.
---
Overall you're gonna want to work towards things like a whip, barrows gear, bandos gear, etc. 
---
Am I welcome to join if I‚Äôm trying to finish the kandarin elite diary task?

Prepare to get smacked *a lot* unless you have prior pking experience. I was lured in by the promise of easy bot kills at green dragons to learn on, but of course a lot of the more experienced players already know this and were ready and waiting. Took me a couple months to start breaking even and I'm still several mil in the hole.
---
i mean quit if you want, i wouldnt though.
---
why would you risk doing abyss cosmics though, you can do cosmics easily without abyss
---
Made a whole new account for this. How brave. Might be time for a full IP ban, huh? Could get you to finally quit this insensitive bullshit
---
when you get venomed
---
Gamit, I BEG YOU, please also reset my account "eat the maul" as I also got affected by the glitch but wasn't made aware of the forum thread in time. Please please please make my day, sincere thank you.
---
Perfect, I‚Äôm 2 lvls away thanks to tome of fire grind
---
Prayer Renewal potion would be nice. I wonder id if special restore potions would work well.
---
Maybe a "water into blood" spell for the Arceuus spellbook, turning vials of water into vials of blood.
---
So you saw that he got his fire cape then?
---
This is 100% going to get added to the crab dance video
---
I think you're actually pretty stupid, it's not just about how hard you hit. Did you even understand what he said ?
---
since they supposedly know which account it happened to id bet any attempt to abuse it would result in a quick ban.
---
Perfect, I‚Äôm 2 lvls away thanks to the tome of fire grind. 32m dry btw :(
---
Do any of the quests require defence levels? I know they award a decent amount of def xp, but I thought that was the only reason why it's impossible on a level 1 def pure. 
---
&gt;I didn‚Äôt want to bitch and ask for rollback, I just rolled with the punches
---
so youre complaining that you didnt ask for the rollback, and didnt get rolled back?
---
"Hidden poll results" -Jagex, probably
---
Captain hindsight here: don't risk going into the wildy on an uim.
---
Just do some stuff you couldn't do with a lot of wealth now.
---
venom.
---
just keep grinding zulrah is like riding a bike you can do it in your sleep once you learn the patterns.
---
Accuracy only affects whether you hit a 0 or not. I think when it was just the new gloves it was less common, but with the bonus on serp helm it's more common. Max hit chance rolls only off strength bonus, and it's always rounded down so you can be more likely to hit a max even if the max hit is the same I believe. 
---
My main is 4800 and i probably have 4800 combined om other accs lol
---
It's also pretty good at trolling people because a lot of players don't know that it instantly teleports you away when you rub it =]
---
so are you going to sign his phattie or not?
---
I would suggest using addy darts just in general because you're already committing so much money with zulrah scales you might as well make them count by doing more damage. 
---
As for Jad if you can get the prayer switching down you will have no trouble at all. There is a flash program somewhere online that you can use to practice, it's all in the browser so don't download anything. I believe it uses RS3 graphics but the attacks and prayers the same.
---
&gt;They should presumably be able to alter that first tool just a little bit to put the xp back to whatever should be in the log that they presumably still have which they are currently using to give xp back.
---
Honestly automating this step is much much more work than doing it manually with the same data.
---
How does it feel to have grinded for so long and still not even have a third as many as kerem?
---
With the upcoming Clue Scroll expansion, would it be possible to standardise a couple of anomalies with Elite Clues. For example, dig spots are 1x1 as opposed to 3x3 on other tiers, and challenge scrolls have to be completed by clicking on the scroll, rather than speaking to the NPC.
---
Did you log into a deadman mode world? Try a regular world. 
---
‚ÄúYes uh We‚Äôre gonna need you to remove the one thing that‚Äôs protecting your account and in turn making it more vulnerable. Don‚Äôt ask why just pls do. Thanks!‚Äù 
---
yessssssssss
---
Wow this gives me hope that I might actually try to get the torso in all my years of playing runescape.
---
Made an Ironman not too long ago and that thing would be the bis item for a loooooong time. I might hit yall up once I have the time. 
---
Why would you ever make this post jesus christ you've got the best pking acc 
---
Leave it to someone with rot in their name to make such a brain dead comment. 
---
L0l what fuck bullshit this
---
You‚Äôre able to add an auth without having access to the account? 
---
Def xp is almost worthless if you're able to efficiently barrage, so there's that.
---
Probably logged into Deadman mode world.....
---
Erm..more so in the sense that there are much better bosses/tasks out there to farm now. Stuff like zulrah, demonic gorillas, vorkath etc. 2m+ is still a great drop and value, that wasnt my point. 
---
Whips were only more than p hats on the first couple days of release, and the lower tier ones at that. The og spec lasted for quite a while and by that i mean several weeks or more i cant remember exactly. Before the spec got nerfed I wanna say they were still in the 10m+ range. 
---
I‚Äôm in
---
Dude, please please also reset my account "eat the maul" that also got affected but I didn't see the thread in time. Got screwed by a rune halberd in pvp. I would be forever grateful, thank A LOT! /Luka
---
I cringed a little bit.
---
This makes regular max capes feel worthless. Like 120 capes vs 99 capes. 
---
ü¶Ä Reddit and Twitter are not costumer service platforms ü¶Ä

Zulrahs still good even if you use a scroll per kill
---
perfect for /r/Catswhoyell

I just tried to get the promo on 18th of March and it said that I missed the promo... not sure why
---
incredible how stupid wintertodt made fm
---
You'll be fine, but expect to be bullied at first. These main brids literally focus exclusively on switching as fast as possible and you have some like 1013 that can pull off consistent 8-way 1 ticks. 
---
The combat bracelet post is what I was going to say to you..
---
How did Lynx Titan get 28m Def XP this month???? O.O
---
Just get agility scroll eats into profits a good bit
---
Nexus is better because you have all the teles in one orb. You can build multiple portal cgambers with all the teles if you want. Having a portal chamber with your 3 favorite teles can be useful for single click teles.
---
I'm juat gooing to build the nexus.
---
Would it be though, if they already had most of it built? 
---
I suppose it depends on the scale of affected accounts, but in my mind it seems like a small tweak.
---
Can they take my 2 def pure back to 1 plz.
---
Through doing one/two daily farm runs which takes like 10 minutes, on your phone?
---
Shame nice seercull
---
I‚Äôll get that torso man legooo
---
You're always more likely to hit a zero than your max hit
---
You should be able to simply tap sign out on the log in menu. Then sign in using your RuneScape details instead of the Game Center 
---
Fucking safer
---
I'm 14 and everything is cringe haHAA
---
Depends on how you do Slayer. But really all it does is save Water Runes and let you Autocast; a SotD has the same rune saving effect and 15% damage. The Attack difference isn't a big deal for barrage tasks.
---
Either way, this whole topic kinda misses the point in why I brought up Kodai. I didn't mean to suggest it isn't worth the price; just that it doesn't give that huge of boosts over much cheaper items and it is that price because it is rare and BiS, much like the Arcane.
---
Yes I do! Someone in the cc will always be playing too!
---
Defence bug
---
You could do this in the wildy too. I'm a pvp noob but enjoy tribridding occasionally and usually go up near kbd and you can find fights fairly easily. Most everyone is on ancients and doesn't tb so escaping isn't too hard if you want to run to kbd and tele out. Pvp worlds are prob quicker since you're near bank but you'll probably have to deal more with rushers and raggers.
---
The fuck? Ya boi just got smoked
---
I do teach people and set up games. Carry low combat people. Play with pet hunters as well. Just come stop by and we will play üòé
---
It was never officially confirmed
---
Group ironman is literally retarded and anyone who whines about not having it is retarded as well.
---
damn now i don't want to play on my UIM until this blows over because of a potential rollback
---
While faster than collecting manually from spawns (marginally), it's still terrible and unrewarding. 
---
Disagree. This game has massive amount of dead content and F2P is barren.
---
More just making fun of all the ‚Äúlost my house, have no friends, jobless, depressed, but here‚Äôs my fire cape‚Äù posts that have almost become a meme
---
RoD is for access to barrows gloves. There are better hand slot items for mage/melee, but at 50-100 times the cost. It will also force you to do many quests to get to it. 
---
Ancients is useful in certain situations. I only use it for stacking nechryael and dust devils during slayer tasks currently.
---
I'm sure there are plenty of people that don't record or stream or post on reddit that may or may not have hit it.
---
Think they're the exception, as they are entry level gear.
---
I have 77 prayer and I tank Torag and verac every trip. I usually do dharok&gt;Guthan&gt;Karil&gt;ahrim&gt;Torah&gt;verac.
---
Ironmeme could go w/o zammy hasta
---
Whoosh!
---
Whoosh, they're obviously taking the piss.
---
It‚Äôs a way to gain advantage in pvp. Woth a D of 1 a pure is keeping his combat level much lower than if you were leveling all of your stats about equally. This means that people of similar combat level will have much lower overall offensive stats than the pure. The pure optimizes their equipment and weapons as best as they can, to put out a very high damage output for his combat level, which can catch people off guard and unprepared, or just be very powerful in general. 
---
can i have some rc xp?
---
i think it was 99 before *wink wink*
---
Damn, all that but you don't even have the mental capacity to take a screen shot instead of whipping out your cell phone and taking a picture of your fucking screen. Smh.
---
You have to have one of the unique items? I thought it was just skull

I would say rfd, followed by the rest of the quest, maybe base 70's then start working towards achievement diaries
---
you can go as low as 250k
---
I think I might do this!
---
If you didn‚Äôt know you can gather red spiders eggs and unicorn horns quite quickly from the tower of life :) But this is an issue particularly Limpwurt root farming, it‚Äôs very underwhelming compared to other forms of farming. It would be nice if it was affected by ultracompost like herbs and had a minimal yield of 6 instead of 3 regardless of compost used.
---
Why buff a very powerful weapon any more?
---
Hey, my pure was also affected, but I missed the main thread. Is there anywhere else I can post to be included?
---
ZERK TEAM GANG
---
Coulda sworn he went to work at rockstar after osrs
---
Are there any good money makers to skill with? I started about a week ago and am sitting on a 2mil cash stack right now so I have a little room. (Total level is around 500 if that matters at all)
---
&gt;if all 5 party members spam it
---
The collector can't spam it, for obvious reasons as they have to put the egg in... And the leader can't spam it because some priority thing. 3 people spamming with 2 eggs is the usual.
---
Pretty sure you need to attach a valid email account to the Game Center OSRS account in order to log said account into a different phone/computer
---
I think I met you at BA bank
---
you can use this ui setup in the client iirc
---
Sensor your battery life too. Otherwise someone could steal your phone with that info. 
---
Autists can‚Äôt deal with talking to people, so thanks but no thanks.
---
There's a 0.000343% chance of that being hit if someone is in maxed gear, maxed with potions, and assuming someone has 100% accuracy. So it's actually even more rare than that
---
Holy fuck üëå
---
I posted this while at work....my boss upvoted it l0l
---
Just a wild pie, or whatever one boosts agility. That's what I did when I chinned.
---
It is far more useful than the arcane though. The arcane is almost completely unless everywhere. And not worth buying unless you already have a tbow scythe and every other bis gear. While the wand is extremely useful for slayer. 
---
Alexa. Play sea shanty 2 on max volume. 
---
Way too ambitious and under-delivered. 
---
Some of the most iconic Runescape locations are single square tiles, like the telegrab spots in f2p. The original designers of Zeah didn't really know what made Runescape great. We don't need big maps just to be big. 
---
They clearly mean though the inbox which shows up in game after login my dude
---
You must have autism because you are over analyzing everything. It‚Äôs the internet, Reddit in fact. I look at a lot of different shit very quickly and if your analyzing people‚Äôs comments this far you have a problem. This isn‚Äôt college and I‚Äôm not trying to appeal to you, I asked a question not for your theory
---
But... but... which baguette!?!?!?
---
Yeah maybe next time champ.
---
Safe one more time I tele noob
---
Starfish thank you for helping where can I do this?
---
I hope you ended up paying him more lol.
---
well is there gonna be another batch or no? i dont kow
---
Dat a tent
---
You still hit zeros pretty often even if your accuracy roll succeeds
---
That is a funny bug. And an annoying one. And a awesome one at the same time.
---
What is your bank PIN?
---
Its a finn, what did you expect 
---
They actually removed nearly 70m exp off someone account. How fucking incompetent can you be.
---
Believe it or not, poor people actually exist. We aren't just government propaganda
---
See previous comments.  It's sound advice.
---
gey
---
Nobody is arguing against this, you're missing the point
---
Are you kidding me -\_\_- FML
---
I assume you either make a note of it in case you need it, or you can guesstimate and they'll take it into consideration
---
Right, but he‚Äôs saying just because they don‚Äôt wield it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have it or don‚Äôt know about it.
---
The Dungeon of Kourend and Korluum look pretty good in my opinion. The surface is a pretty big eyesore. I always look at Zanaris as a wild, completely different, example of early Runescape map design. It was out of place when added, but it was supposed to be, that's the theme. Looking back, you can clearly see even while being different, it adhears to the original Runescape design philosphy, which a lot of the new OSRS content does not.
---
The Farming Guild is amazing though. Butterflies and bunnies, with nicely made glass walls (unlike the tithe farm). Makes me hopeful for future content. 
---
Idk why he won't answer me, bummer.
---
wasting his time at the GE instead of abusing it in pvp smh
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
Make a HCIM and crack on...
---
strive to be a sweatier boi and calculate it based on the gear and stats in the vid
---
Why? 2k is a very high amount. I have been playing this game for quite a while now, ever since around 06' and follow a lot of things that go on around the community and I don't even have 2k on either RS3 or OSRS.  
---
Don't need to have an elitist mindset that just because you have 2k stats means you understand the game. A lot of players are no where near 2k and most likely will never be (or will be years for them) even though they really enjoy the game, why should they also not get a voice?
---
ok why you telling us lol
---
A basic google search resulted in the following information from the wiki -
---
&gt;Splashing is the act of purposely wearing items with bonuses that total at least **-65 Magic attack**
---
How many fire lighters you have there, chump?
---
And the floor of the calculation includes 0 even though the game sees it as a hit. The accuracy only affects the % chance of splatting(miss) and not splatting(0)
---
#Ive been asking since the first week of Hydra release
---
Currently the only way to weaken the defences of Hydra is if its standing on the necessary tile before the chemicals shoot up, but not if its walking into it.
---
Can this be updated so chemicals will weaken it either way?
---
How many soul runes is equivalent to one soul?
---
You need -65 in order for it to work
---
Yea it‚Äôs an iOS issue. Lots of people reporting it. I don‚Äôt think jagex has said anything about it. 
---
You need -62 minimum to splash I believe 
---
Would it be possible to have a friends chat update?
---
For example, could we have ‚Äúwelcome messages‚Äù in our friends chat upon logging in? They could have a 50 character limit, etc. In addition to more ranks. 
---
- A_G_4 
---
Can the process for recoloring slayer helms (switching from one head to another) be made simpler? Currently we have to dismantle, reassmble, and use the new head on the slayer helm with a confirmation message. Can we remove this confirmation message? Can we add a right click &gt; remove head option to slayer helms?
---
Understandable have a nice day
---
Bruh, hope this goes too page so customer service can handle this.
---
Why would you ever post this on Reddit?
---
/u/immoray /u/zonawoah 
---
mocked up an in game example for you guys
---
https://streamable.com/
---
Agreed, would be nice if we could store all firelighters in that gnomish firelighter box though
---
Lured gg
---
Like i said I do fish cause it's consistent. I had it on trees for like 3 weeks and got 1 seed nest and 1 clue nest didn't seem worth it.
---
yeah but he could be less of a fuckin cunt about it 
---
It is a meme, you have nobody to blame but yourself if that's the case.
---
Here I am too afraid to finish DS2
---
1- or 2-egging queen is pretty standard because every click during the omega egg's fire tick (by people other than the leader) registers a hit; you don't need 8 eggs just 8 clicks. People shouldn't expect others to know that, though, especially if they're  new to ba.
---
LOL, look at this fucking guy. Doesn't understand memes whatsoever.
---
Wow, funny seeing your post. When I started old school, I went from 1 def pure to 45 def to of course becoming a main and I remember having you on my friends list. Not sure where or how we met but glad to see you‚Äôre still doing your thing. 
---
Wait so your fine with goving ironman a free armor set at the start of their adventure while other only get a wooden shield and bronze sword. But a recolor of the BiS cape because they put 2000+ extra hours in a ironman is a no?
---
Hey guys we will be fixing accounts party on world 310 from 8:30-8:45pm GMT. Make sure to wear a wacky outfit, it should be a great time. Unfortunately we all have a mandatory pub meeting afterwards. If you miss the meet up don‚Äôt worry we will have another one TBD. If this doesn‚Äôt work for you feel free to make a Reddit post about it and we may reach out to you depending on upvote quantity.

Thank you.

You can actually have jesus in your name due to complaints, but people on rs3 took the names by getting buddy buddy with jmods.
---
Thank you for revealing OP's location, their account is now mine!!!
---
Wasn't Nieve killed because of her association with Mod Reach?
---
Bob, though... yeah, that was crap.
---
Does anyone know a combination that can achieve this in f2p without 40 range (d hide vambs)?
---
Are you telling us you sold 4b for only $631....
---
Considering I'm rushing Quest Cape, I don't have much because it hasn't been a problem yet, for melee I have just a D Scim/Defender, with Obby Legs and torso, I have barely any mage gear and ranged is just a Rune Cbow with black d'hide.
---
S
---
How does he know his account is hijacked then? You don't need the authenticator to delete it or change your password this topic just proves people jump on the bandwagon of jagex support hate without using their braincells.
---
That is just lovely. Hope your troubles are gonna be worked out!
---
No. Is that the only transaction you are on the link?
---
Damn 4 rc. You must've been grinding some hours man. OT: nice job OP! Looking good.
---
WHEN I SUCK YOUR DICK TONIGHT YOU WILL CUM
---
You can raid on an ironman with friends 
---
Nice I'm gonna be doing this, though likely stopping at 56 HP 14 combat for 10 hp heals on Sara Brews and not gaining a combat level. Which will be good for black chins (and maybe Emblem trading???)
---
Torille
---
Probably not 
---
Jeez I gotta stop afking slayer and get into bridding lol. Shit looks fun
---
Use curse goblin staff. You get it from the toy dude in draynor
---
My main just became a 1 def pure
---
Thanks, Jagex! Saved me a lot of time!
---
I didnt know this either! 
---
how does he know hes been hijacked in that case. also, doesn't hijacked mean the account is under the possession of somebody other than the owner of the account?
---
link to the original vid?
---
You also did it on a character you haven't unlocked, impressive
---
I‚Äôm level 77 cb and I was gonna put off getting the torso since I had no one to do it with, and I‚Äôm pretty new to BA. Could I join y‚Äôall? 
---
Steel plates from the lava maze sell for 1.5k each
---
Maybe not to you but to some buyer it is definitely worth it. It‚Äôs funny how the market almost doesn‚Äôt revolve around you huh?
---
damn
---
The M lol
---
Yeah aim for barrows gloves. BiS melee and ranged gloves. 
---
Agreed. It took other people pointing it out to notice. "That's not how math works" makes me think he didn't notice either, because it was really unhelpful for finding the typo. 
---
I see now, managed to skip over your link and only saw the cover photo.
---
No but actually yes. They have to be an F key, but technically you can remap your keyboard buttons manually to have lets say q=f1. Not very practical but hey I'm just giving an example
---
This. Also would be cool if they could take some assets from the Quest Cape and Diary Cape emote and make them into unique teleport animations for those skillcapes. 
---
Biggest what?? Chicken? Challenge? Cheetos? I need to know!
---
It's real and an honest response. Instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon, use your brain and think logically.
---
Probably fueled his addiction 10 times over.
---
&gt; Though I think iff you max one of those accounts you deserve some extra praise.
---
What a weird thing to say. What about people that maxed in 2014 do they deserve "extra praise" by having a special 2014 tag on their max cape because maxing a main in 2014 literally takes longer than maxing an IM in 2019?
---
how do you do that
---
jihadsquad's sheet, dps calc sheet
---
Not how it works
---
man hunter is by far the worst skill.  rc is just slow but it isonly 3 hours at bloods for 100k exp each day.
---
Current CM does a piss poor job. They literally just look what‚Äôs most upvoted on reddit and roll with it. Comments and concerns are never read only the circle-jerk upvotes are looked at. Glad wolf hosted the last QA though. That‚Äôs a step in the right direction.
---
I had also looked around the Reddit for a while cause I had no idea what to put it into and most people seemed to recommend fish or trees but when the trees were disappointing I switched and never looked back cause the fish give a consistent profit
---
i second it whos brilliant idea was it to made broad bolts tradeable but not arrows?
---
 Q 
---
Max cape spam lmao
---
Noob here, is there any reason the 47-47 could be more likely than the 46-46 was? Attack bonus or something?
---
Lets see you guys win a dmm tournament now. 
---
Close your eyes
---
It‚Äôs funny how he‚Äôs saying he wouldn‚Äôt do it and you assume he‚Äôs speaking for everyone and then proceed to be a dick. 
---
it's everything I could have hoped for
---
no for the 100th time
---
Nice 
---
My roommate situation ended on bad terms. All 3 of them play osrs.  My fear is they will spam report me for things I never did or said.  Is this possible?  What Can I do to help this of anything?  I really don‚Äôt wanna lose all the progress I‚Äôve made in the game. 
---
What even are fire lighters supposed to be? Mushroom on a stick?
---
I do remember a few weeks ago I got extremely unlucky with like only 70k worth of seeds out of 30-something nests, But it balances out when I've gotten close to 500k worth of seeds.

What'd you do for money making? And check out the crack the clue 2 rewards man they're all f2p.

---
Save a copy in your own google sheets to edit it.
---
Dont know if its still this way but about 2 years ago it wouldnt auto log the hijacker if you added a new authenticator, they had to hop worlds/relog. This means that they have 6 hours to do whatever they want on the account. Happened to my obby tank and they autotyped advertising a rwting site at the ge til the 6 hour log, and the account got an unappealable macro ban the next day.
---
can tell u dont exercise those fingers need to get fingering or atleast type some more.
---
That's his alts name A\_Zerker. Yeah kinda click bait tho i thought the same.
---
11 whips 2.2k kc haha
---
Hhhhhhhhh lmao
---
I never said I did it quick, with apex I did it between games (solid 5 minutes every 15-20 min), with league there is a lot of time where you can alt tab and click really fast. 
---
Do some slayer jesus
---
This is one of those things that changes so much you really have to just look it up lmao
---
I see several reoccurring complaints with the current state of the game which I totally understand. I would however like to ask for context on Jagex being powerless against a PvP clan?
---
Bro come join Arab nation for egypt
---
Understandable of course
---
If so then support did indeed make an oopsie woopsie.
---
You can still appeal it through the support page tho, just not through your account settings.
---
It's less likely than a 46-46, but that's just how RNG is, you don't know when it'll happen and if they'll get it on video.
---
It sounds like they sampled a blown speaker for that bass sound.
---
i'm in - what should our min requirements be?
---
Haha that my ad don‚Äôt report
---
Everyone starts somewhere. Not every new pker is going to go out risking 50m in no honor fights.
---
Yeah I appealed it when they opened up macro appeals for hijacked accounts and it got accepted pretty quickly. Still annoying though, since I had lost a few months of membership on it when I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.
---
Wouldn't that be the world record for overall exp in any and all skills too? 
---
I think both Shen and another guy have their povs uploaded somewhere
---
‚ÄúFire‚Äù cape. 
---
yea it is there are 2 outcomes and only 1 can occur so its 1/2 thats 50 50 man either it happens or it doesnt
---
eye don't know about this one chief
---
This isnt a zerk account, its a maxed main
---
it doesnt have a purpose anymore than it did before, the only purpose is still to do just do the fm training method
---
doing 100 hours of burning maples + the lost resources from kingdom on maples instead of other things is a much bigger roadblock than todt. 
---
also it being a skill with no real reward and a resource sink meant that only people who enjoyed skilling did it, now its braindead, and shits out resources
---
Welcome home. 
---
Hhhh yes kiss you sister
---
Joining in, though it was on my rune drag alt T_T
---
I bet you think this is some sort of achievement.
---
Fuck you runcraft
---
What happens when an HCIM dies to a disconnection? Do they revert to black caps? 
---
65 rc here and every single xp is from quesst, lamps or tears. Ef that shit
---
Damage rolls are on a uniform distribution, you‚Äôre just as likely to hit a 46-46 as you are to hit a 1-1
---
What platebody is that?
---
Idk what armour that is but it looks dope.
---
You got sever ADD if that's distracting.
---
Go bro
---
yeah i goofed
---
Imagine giving the sweaty goblins that hack osrs accounts all this juicy info üò´
---
Nothing else is missing. I watched this happen in real time.
---
Thanks to whoever gave me silver, I always love sharing my dumbass mistakes.
---
You were clearly a better fighter than Thomarse
---
It's more afk than not using Runelite but still not as afk as Bloods. 
---
I don't know how theater works but it could be something like the private Corp scam or something. Convince you to drop it then kick you not sure though
---
Back to back to back ~~boats~~ drops

---
well, i mean theatre bank is not safe in pvp... there isn't any way for you to lose items in the theatre (unless you drop them).
---
its probably just the regular scams.
---
Big if true
---
Try the next dmm seasonal. Closest you're gonna get.
---
Reading comprehension can be complicated. I understand, he said the account is not worth it implying everyone else would think it‚Äôs not worthy. 
---
Think I'll just save them for now, you never know. Plus it's only like half of what I paid for them to alch so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
Yeah... Just like how crafting is like runecrafting except without the runes. Or how smithing is like runecrafting except with metal.
---
Gives good exposure. 
---
People see it and say hey that‚Äôs RuneScape. I used to play that. I wonder how it is?
---
Than bam their trapped back into the cycle. 
---
&gt; Instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon, use your brain and think logically.
---
That's condescending and derogatory as fuck.
---
&gt; Nope, it's real!
---
Was all that was needed to be said.
---
*cough* revive the RuneScape book series and have T.S Church pen a underground pass linked book series. *cough*

I need lasik eye surgery after seeing this

I'm finding agility much more cancerous than runecrafting after recently getting 99 rc and at 98 agi atm

Super sick man, much respect.

lollllllllllllllllllll botted as fuck

Thanks!

This is completely wrong on a technical level. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why a database must have a few erroneous records updated when they shouldn‚Äôt; Wells Fargo and Visa guarantee you they won‚Äôt arbitrarily set your bank/credit card balance to a penny, and they use the same database technology everyone else does, because those databases were *designed* to be reliable.  Secondly the fastest way to fix any erroneous update is to roll back those specific transactions; databases are designed to make this as painless as possible, again because they are designed to be used in much more critical situations than storing video game user data.  Anyone who has ever dealt with a critical software bug knows the first priority is to restore the system to its last known working condition; adding more hacky patches or panicked manual intervention introduces the possibility for further fuckups (which is exactly what happened in the case of the dude who got 75 million def exp).  Nothing in the way Jagex has handled this demonstrates technical competency at all, and I‚Äôm frankly shocked that asking affected players to log into lumby at a specific world to have their account fixed manually was even considered, much less chosen as their preferred fix.
---
Sure, perhaps an authenticator delay could be added. But the thing is, people are still going to get hacked.
---
People are way too quick to give out information. There was this dude that ran one of these phishing sites that was in my old cc, the sheer number of people that fall for phishing scams is ridiculous. Most people never even realised they were phished and redirect the blame towards the system. 
---
Jagex have clearly seen all the authenticator posts, and are most likely going to deal with it. The thing is, if your RS account gets hacked **as well ** as your email, you have much bigger problems than getting hacked on a video game. If we're putting all of our details onto computers, to the point where most of our life is probably on cloud storage somewhere, if you aren't taking preventative measures to secure your shit on the internet, you need to take some time to really reconsider your priorities.
---
There are people in the pure clanning community that would probably pay a lot for this account. Dedicated clan war pures completely max their accounts ie. 99 att, str and prayer. Barrows gloves on top of that would be insane
---
And veng
---
All of this definitely depends a lot on what type of pking you're doing. I don't have enough experience trib ridding, especially at that lvl, so your anecdotal evidence might be more accurate than my speculation. At edge and on pvp worlds, however, plenty of people fight without mage. In that situation I think I'm probs right with my order. But I'll believe you on the mystic
---
Lawl literally the same thing for me.
---
No joke, I had to plant my last satchel. As I was running to it, I looked at another window that was open and misclicked into a guard. Added a good 20-30 minutes to the quest for me lol

Hi, I'm looking to join the discord and learn ToB. My IGN is Helix IX.
---
Well that's not how it works in my opinion. You see other people's drops all the time  and get the temptation to make gameplay easier. I would like it to be official and have symbol near nickname
---
Good meme
---
I can't be the only one who thinks that the people making high-effort posts about Authenticator Removal Delay are often people who bought their accounts and are terrified that the original owners are going to come back and hack them.
---
D
---
Honestly, shit most likely got leaked. Like real data breaches, but since nothing was actually stolen from Jagex they would rather not have what got leaked come out. Only thing that was taken was gold from players. Jagex lost nothing. What is the point of basically exposing yourself to lawsuit if nothing was actually taken from yo. 
---
True, but I, for example, have only just started Vorkath. DHCB still costs far more than my entire bank value right now. Will that change? Yes. But it is still most certainly unattainable for me, right now.
---
Why does everyone make gifs?? Vastly inferior to videos and it‚Äôs honestly harder to make a gif than just take a video 
---
Wow I remember back when Cooking was the most common 99.
---
You can roll a zero on a successful hit. So if you hit, it rolls 0-47 on both attacks, it's 96 with possibilities.
---
I'm more fun at parties.
---
I don't really care one way or another. I'm just saying there'd be no point in implementing these cape designs if not for the specified purpose. 
---
are you retarded?
---
Yeah but sometimes you want 2 click too
---
Public opinion can change
---
There's a lot of effort put in this post. I recognise that and applaud you for it. But holy shit, this is such an abysmal fucking meme. Like, for a second there I genuinely though I'd gone back to 2006 era internet with the trollface and rickroll. But nope, I'm here in 2019 looking at perhaps the most poorly executed meme that could ever exist. Congratulations, your meme has somehow actually managed to leave a horrible taste in my mouth.
---
So your saying if they would like to remain an OP pure to stay low for the next while? 
---
That‚Äôs cause it isn‚Äôt there 
---
As more and more quests are being rolled out, will you be looking to add more end-game level quests with skill pre-requisites in the 80's-90's? The current highest pre-requisite is 75 magic with the introduction of Dragon Slayer 2. I would love to see quests that parallel content such as high-end raids.
---
Lol what are you talking about
---
I was affected. I can't prove it, but just take my word and put it right back to level 99, cheers
---
Why didn't they just do it on their POH's punching bag?? ^/s
---
no fletching holds the most xp in a day.
---
You want credit on your repost ? Get real
---
That would be really OP for nmz with the special attack perk
---
Cause he plays the better of the games available
---
Runelite makes way less tedious in my opinion.
---
Just get elite void and knock it out.
---
Yea but not at all. Runecrafting is annoying bc you have to take all your materials to a single oddly specific area in the game.  All those other skills you can do at or very close to a bank.
---
They should get the artist's in here to reset players xp too while they're at it
---
You have to be really soft to be this offended ^(2019 btw) xD
---
Well done mate what seller did you use?
---
As an ironman i hate this because those bankslots are so value
---
Did you try using both the website and in game to change your name? Sometimes one will reject what the other will accept
---
X'D
---
How ignorant. Good luck on osrs newfag. 
---
These sounds have surely come from Crash Bash.
---
Iirc it literally happened like 5 times with Sick Nerd
---
Grats man! I recently got 85 slayer and grounded 90-95 str on mobile! Managed to get 24 whips in about 8k kills or so and defo would recommend. I used prayer setup with bulwark and just tagged all the demons and left it for 5 mins a time. Gl!
---
Not really. G maul or claws would by far be better. The attack rate of a whip is still to slow for that to matter..youre more likely to get way more damage off from using a gmaul which would be idk 4 attacks or so? vs every 1 special from whip. 
---
who are you?
---
Eat your lamps! There‚Äôs starving UIM‚Äôs in Morytania! 
---
Make a new account, buy like 100m to get you started and you‚Äôll fly by 
---
Cant say I‚Äôve seen much exciting thing apart from ranger boots and master clues honestly.
---
It's not their fault this is how the game engine was built. If you need an outlet for your anger I suggest going to the gym
---
Oh
---
i have 500 kc and got the fuck outta there the second i hit 99
---
shit activity, shit pet
---
Could the Items Kept on Death interface be updated in safe areas (such as a PoH) to tell you what items would be kept on death if you were to die outside of that safe area. It‚Äôs annoying to have to step outside, click the interface, and then wait for the house to load again.

I propose the interface be tweaked to still show that you‚Äôre in a safe area and will not lose items, but also; the 3 main items you will keep, and a highlighted 4th item that would be kept if you‚Äôre using the protect item prayer. The first item (the most expensive) could be highlighted red stating this item would be the item kept on death if the player were skulled and using protect item.
---
Also, is there a way to show us the items that won‚Äôt fall to the ground during a death in pvm, like max capes, imbued rings and ornamented necklaces.
---
You‚Äôve got a text btw.
---
Could we have the ability to cast Vengeance in out PoH? This would be beneficial for both PvMers and PvPers to have their vengeance already activated, as well as using it for combat inside the PoH. 
---
there are programs that do the same exact thing but use webms instead.  gifs (and gyazo in general) are just far inferior at this point.  
---
They'd have to wait for the engine team to be available to work on that, complaining won't rush that process
---
Yes you're a fucking idiot, Go recover your steam account it removed the authenticator, go recover your blizzard account it removes your authenticator every single fucking service removes it because if they don't they still lock you out of your own account even after a sucessfull recovery attempt (assuming the "hacker" put an authenticator on the account).
---
I love how you keep changing the subject from adding a delay upon requesting to remove it to adding a delay upon account recovery and now its "they require extra verification to remove it" seriously buddy how fucking clueless are you?
---
Yep you can easely remove the authenticator compared to other services on OSRS congrats you've got that right took you changing your story 3 times goodjob.
---
You know what steam and blizzard have in common? They have their own authenticator and aren't using googles so they have more personal information on the user BABAAMMM tell me google has nothing to do with it again.
---
No, I only tried in game, but that sounds like it‚Äôs worth a shot! I‚Äôll give it a try, thanks!
---
Claws would be more op, but whip would be better than gmaul imo, either way your idea is pretty dumb. The whip is already op as you‚Äôve stated, so why buff it even more? 
---
&gt;Do some slayer jesus
---
&gt;75 slayer
---
Ah I see this is the classic part where you realize you may play a bit too much runescape
---
It's none of your business what they do with the money.
---
Yup, you can see my hypothesized calculation for how it would have worked in another post. But apparently Mod Ash confirmed hits are a uniform distribution from 1-max hit, so I was wrong. 
---
happened to sick nerd, should be a twitch clip out there somewhere
---
Thanks dude :)! It was so cool seeing one drop from pvm. I played like 02-07 and only ever pvped so I never did much pvm. I did a little bit on a couple later stints but never did slayer or any bosses really. So this was new to me. Ive pked hundreds of whips, but a drop felt different from actual slayer task :P

&gt;  or could I go without that juicy +6 prayer bonus?

It also gives damage boost of 2.5% to both the mage and range sets.
---
Stop thinking about the hours it will take to get it and just grind it out.
---
just use dhide torso, its better on avg than void anyways
---
If you are using void then get Elite, but even elite void isn't that good in raids.
---
cuz we don't have enough max capes already
---
I‚Äôd much prefer the Zamorak redesign suggested here, while these are nice I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to be worth anything unless the change is extreme as justiciary is already falling hard in price.

I don‚Äôt mind any level in my teams in my personal experience so, some do and that‚Äôs okay lol. To join there is no reqs. Just message me. The other guy that responded to you helps out a lot too. He‚Äôs a good gen 
---
I still get a little chuckle, good to see this repost again 
---
&gt; Jagex has both rate limiting in game and recaptcha on the website for logins which would prevent brute force/automated attacks so I am unsure what you are trying to imply with that. 
---
Sure, it slows them down, but it doesn't stop them.
---
&gt; Recovery questions are not the main method to regain access to an account and often play a very small role in the whole picture. 
---
I think you underestimate how many accounts get hacked through the recovery process, i'm not only talking about the 5 questions. The "other" usefull info, previous passwords are also knowledge based answers that are a bad practise to recover accounts.
---
&gt; Please, anyone, show me a website/service that provides a authenticator delay after a successful *recovery*. It literally never makes sense because a successful recovery is that person proving to Jagex that they have a valid claim to that account so why the fuck would they not remove the authenticator.  
---
I'd agree, if that succesfull recovery would be done through a phonenumber or  government-issued photo ID, but not through some random info I can scrape off the internet &amp; database leaks for some accounts.
---
Think of all the cannonballs
---
This would be great,  full graceful is not my best best looking attire

omg can you find the picture please
---
On the bright side, we share a common recent goal (sort of I suppose) hit 85 slayer recently, but as is the case with Konar, awful awful tasks and I‚Äôm almost 86 without seeing any Abby Demon task. 
---
Been maxed for years, and play causally after leaving a completionist main to rot in RS3 back in 2013. But just started doing slayer after a huge break from the game(returned during mobile). 
---
I remember when the new Kebos expansion was released I was still hunting all the skills I need for Diary Cape (while purposefully leaving slayer for last since it‚Äôs my most enjoyable skill), some pretty smart folks did the calculation of how bad Konar was for actual slayer tasks. Boy were they right, I‚Äôve gotten only 5 different slayer monsters since I started slaying again (RC was killin me with boredom). What is up with this slayer master? Such awful tasks.. before blocks: Fire Giants, Hellhounds, Bloodbelds, Drake‚Äôs, Metal dragons. I shit you not this were all the tasks I had for like 3 days straight. 
---
The brimstone keys are always a cool fun surprise for money. But jeez, the tasks themselves make me feel like I did in OG RS2 upon slayer release, same shit over and over.. 
---
Have you get this by any chance? Or have I been away from slayer that long? 
---
Data caps are another reason why GIFs are amazing. I can't watch a few 30 second youtube videos every day without breaching my data cap on my phone. 
---
Devalues my questionable life choices
---
I make that a month every month bro 
---
Yeah im just done with RS then. Pretty stupid this is possible and they dont even show IP login history if this happens. Pretty demoralizing to even try and rebuild. Farewell RS if this is the case
---
Was expecting no authenticator delay tbh
---
1) Can the deposit 1/10/X/All interface be added to deposit boxes on desktop?

2) Can the deposit loot button in deposit boxes also empty coal bag, gem bag, herb bag, rune pouches?

Probably all to and from him.

With a name and comment history like you have, it is rather obvious that you just intend on trolling. It's a shame really, you could have at least been original with you're insults, but nah, you gotta act your age and hurl insults  made by 10 year olds around the country

Really not worth it if it‚Äôs for raids. Join the wedoraids discord and choose the budget non-void set up

ye we all say that after losing some items. I'm still playing this game 3 years later and it's like it never happened.

We'll cya after the usual week long break.

Basically dont stake unless you're 99 all melee

Ive always use tele tabs and pay farmers to remove the trees. Easiest way for me.

Mahogany trees are more affordable than yews I take it? Can‚Äôt check GE rn.
---
splashing wasn't really "designed" or intended to be anything, its just a method of play that became exceedingly popular during the days of "6 hour afk training"  
---
it makes sense to me that the much more active method would be faster and thus more cost effective. 
---
I lol'ed
---
i don't get it
---
i'm proud u no longer play this stinky pure
---
It seems to be a legitimate thing, i havent personally ran any tests on it though to check but I see a lot of folks use it. 
---
I don't use those though either so i dont blame you. 
---
Are you on mobile or pc? I feel like it's more mobile players that are being hacked or at least it seems with mobile release came a lot more people claiming they got hacked even though they had proper security. 
---
Also did you have a bank pin? Its literally the best form of security on an account. Bank your items before you get off for an extended period of time. Its a good habit to get used to. 
---
Membership?
---
You are a champion

It's barely more active though. It doesn't really scale. I'm not complaining, good for me that it's that way, but it's way too OP (and I'm glad).

Expected crab rave... I am disappointed.
---
Any F2P method of earning GP doesn't stack up against buying your first month of membership with real cash. There's lots of ways to earn cash online via reward system or if you have any way to earn cash in real life...
---
At the risk of answering your question with 'just spend IRL cash', that's exactly what you should do. Once you've got access to member's money-making, even the most basic of methods will mean you can always be self sufficient. From there you'd then do well to look at training crafting via cheap and chill methods like glassblowing.
---
Would you like to join my religion BoatMormons?
---
This question depends a whole lot on what kinda player you are. If you're only playing a couple hours a week then this advice is probably not right for you, but if you're gonna play a lot and go for max my personal opinion is that a rune dragon alt is super worthwhile. Takes a few hundred hours to max melee while afking super hard at crabs and then nmz, and then maybe another 100 hours random skills and quests to finish ds2 and mm2. But all said and done, you get an alt that cranks out like 1m/hour that's quite afk. 
---
kinda wish you included regular as well just to see the relative difference

They should rethink this, now that osrs has gotten this big. It's kind of retarded that rs3 has a big ass dev team compared to osrs, while having a player base that's at least 5 times smaller...
---
Every form of security possible but no authenticator... barring that, something of yours was compromised.  Either password re-using, computer has a virus, sharing account info with someone, email on account compromised, etc.  Even if for whatever reason Jagex did consider looking into restoring stuff, they would ding you on the authenticator bit.  
---
lol
---
Hey man don't knock that shit, raspberry is the best.
---
Yea I think I remember a 70m+ drop on cooking posted here before.
---
How/why did you get 99 mage so early? Just curious I don‚Äôt know much about UIM gameplay.
---
With good credit, a mortgage company would ask for a 3% minimum down payment meaning that for $2,600, OP could be purchasing somewhere in the ballpark of an $85,000 home.
---
but i am 99 all melee
---
God damn this is so funny
---
&gt;I had every form of security possible on the account.
---
&gt;Only didnt have the authenticator

I agree that seeing people running around in the same thing doesn't look good. Back when spottier cape + boots of lightness was a thing, you'd see a lot more variety.

i have not been affected by any rollback, user error (stat reset etc), or anything else. i dont see any problem with jagex (just avoid getting alot xp when its update thursday, maybe take poontless pk trip or something and browse new posts on reddit after 1 hr of update)

I love how you resort to petty trolling now because you hopefully realized how dumb you are and how wrong you are. Lol seriously arguing that a whip spec that hit max or zero would be more dps that an endless spec g maul. Its laughable. Carry on though, good day to ya. Use more of that brain next time before starting an argument. And i do love the resorting to troll comments after youve been ousted as an idiot tactic.

How am I supposed to be able to get into pking when I can literally be 1-hit at any time?

Depending on the year this could be a terrible headache to come.

Bugfixes, QoL, and other smaller changes. If something like the right click option on Veos passed a poll and it has been developed and tested, why delay it a week or more? And chances are even if they waited, the same bugs would be present so putting them out sooner in smaller updates can help them be resolved more easily and quicker.
---
imagine their EHP..... will never be beaten
---
Your username says it all buddy
---
Syntax? What do you call runescript
---
They key problem is working for Jagex on OSRS does literally nothing for your career, it's outdated and unused coding so you wont gain any relevant experience so no one wants to work for Jagex.
---
It wont look good on your CV If you work for Jagex for say 4 years and go to your next job basically 4 years out of practice + with no knowledge of current coding techniques because you spent 4 years learning Runescript and not working on actual relevant coding languages
---
and most of those staff possitions are probably still there on rs3, where this quote would have come from, people need to remember that osrs even though being more popular than rs3 has way less staff due to the vote system they used to bring back osrs in the first place...

wym? just put option hide read and theyre gone

No I really absolutely love this country, it's the situation I have to deal with here. I've been performing in Japan for over 6 months and it's just working with theater staff, working with sponsors. It's so different than what I'm used to and it's just hectic and stressful. However, I really love this country I just wish I could visit as a trip and see friends here opposed to constantly working being away from America for so long.

The real question is whether or not you guys added each other and whether or not the guy will continue to be as nice as he was in this first impression.

It's about the amount of money the games bring in the microtransactions make rs3 more profitable so they spend more time on it.

Original kourend was made in 3 months. Kebos also took like 3 months and that is significantly smaller in scale. So no shit Zeah looked like shit when it launched

Well yeah, but I meant that as in, why the crab rave, and not something else
---
Yeah I saw that one, an alternate color scheme wouldn't hurt but for fashionscape purposes I personally feel like black has enough things and it even got the CtC2 armour recently.
---
If the colors were to change, I'd rather have a "restored" color scheme where the armour becomes all white and shiny like initiate and proselyte.

Barrows legs cost ~5k per hour to use (or less if you repair them at a repair stand). There's very little reason to ever use dragon legs.

Tb would be nice. I don‚Äôt even know why they removed it, let alone polling it and requiring a ridiculous percentage to add it back. 
---
Kurask alt nets like 300+ per hr. Should be enough to get that. Then make it a garg alt and eventually a rune drag alt. 
---
It is. I've worked for a lot of customer support jobs. Xbox customers were the fuckinh worst to talk to. It was a fun place to work though

Nah. The mainland would be way too cluttered if they moved shit to it. It was bad at launch. But now it is paying off, sort of. As they have to redesign it as they go.

Can we get an equippable crystal needle with the release of prif? It could also give an invisible +2 or +3 crafting boost similar to how the crystal saw does for construction. It would free up one inventory space while crafting d hide bodies allowing you to utilize your whole inventory rather than constantly being stuck with two unused slots.
---
Nah it‚Äôs safe

Why not NMZ instead?

I would say it doesn't harm to delay it one week. Second point you bring up is pure speculation.

Barrow gloves. Absolutely 100% finish RFD first :). They are by far the best untradable to have done as your first real "goal" on an account. Your skills are quite high actually so this will not effect you but having RFD as your first goal will train your skills up to levels necessary for other important events, and also give you much more efficient training. Personally i never liked quests so when i started playing again a few months ago after 12 years my first goal was barrows gloves. Took 2 weeks to finish and its felt great. I went for all untradables before i really focused on any combat training other than the necessary stats to get them (d def, torso, f cape and b gloves). Like i said they will get your non combats up for other requirements as well so its just an all around great thing to work towards early on. And it feels like less of a grind at an early level. 
---
So I would get those items first. You can get b gloves easily, you have the stats by far so just grind out the qp. Getting fire cape at your stats will be extremely easy, so id do that after b gloves tbh. Get 70 def since youre so close anyway. Use blowpipe, tank skirt/helm with blessed top and shoes (or karils top/rangers if you can afford) then just use BiS ammy/ring you have. Then I would get torso/d def if you havent already. 
---
Now youre all set for the most efficient combat training and i would do slayer :). It depends what you want to do though, do you wanna work on skills or focus more on combat now? But definitely do the untradables first mate. 
---
What exactly about not hiding poll results prevents Jagex from manipulating the results if they want to? Seriously though, if they have manipulated several polls recently would you even know?

what are you on about reddit pvmer lmao

read my reply again
---
The engine team doesn't write runescript though... They work in java, building the backend which supports the runescript the devs use.
---
The problem there is people with the knowledge and experience to write fast, well written and robust java code for systems of that scale are in huge demand, and as such can demand much higher pay.

He gained 68.558.529 exp in a day
---
60 x 60 x 24 = 86400 seconds in a day

68.558.529 / 86.400 = 793.5 exp per second

You can say that about literally any car, dont get too spooked by homie up there. 
---
Nothing, that's the point
---
Nobody does vanguards.

It's pretty straight forward. In exchange for a bit of risk, you essentially get to consume 50% more bones absolutely free. If you're uninterested in cheaper supply cost, use the gilded altar.

You will never live in a place more prepared for earthquakes than Japan, especially after the 2011 earthquake.
---
I would get your base stats to 70, you're already well on your way toward it!
---
They're easy in 4 mans too lol
---
They are lost on death if you have other items that protect over them, regardless of where you are in the wilderness
---
The crossfire has aged so well. 
---
Just got 99 farming too and no pet :(
---
??? I know lots of people who do vanguards. They take like 2 minutes if you know what you're doing.
---
Oh without a doubt. She grew up in one of the few prefectures that were barely ever affected by earthquakes, though, so she gets spooked.
---
But we're moving to Okinawa together next year. Maybe by then, Jagex'll have Asia servers :(
---
It didn't really give it a purpose, since having higher than 50 fm doesn't provide much of an advantage besides slight damage reduction.

There are some inconsistent mechanics in the game when it comes to bosses becoming invincible. Most bosses that can become invincible also become untargetable or unattackable, but there are some that don't, even though they probably should.
---
The grotesque guardians become completely untargetable when they do their coloured light phase change, but dusk is clickable during the phases where you need to kill dawn, even though dusk can never be dealt damage during these phases. **Could you make dusk untargetable during the first and third phase of the grotesque guardians fight?** This would help especially during the third phase when dawn throws out her energy spheres, since it is very difficult to pick up the spheres if they land underneath dusk.

When vorkath uses his ice breath to freeze players before he sends out an undead spawn, vorkath becomes completely immune to damage, but players that were attacking him before he uses his ice breath will keep attacking vorkath even though there is no reason they would want to. This can be detrimental when using a crossbow since sometimes your ruby bolt special attack can trigger, hurting you but dealing no damage to vorkath. Also, because of the slow attack speed of crossbows, accidentally attacking vorkath while he's invincible can make it unreasonably difficult to cast crumble undead on the undead spawn in time, causing you to take unnecessary damage in a way that does not feel fair. **Could you make it so players stop attacking vorkath when he becomes invincible?** There was a poll near the start of QoL month which asked if players should stop attacking when frozen by vorkath's ice breath, but this wouldn't fix the issue of the invincibility being inconsistent, or with ruby bolts triggering while vorkath's ice breath is in mid-air. That poll question also had a very high rate of players voting to skip the question, which should indicate that many players didn't understand what benefit the change would have for players. If the change (that makes players stop attacking) was based on vorkath becoming invincible, then it would be much easier for players to understand the purpose of the change.

&gt; ? I don‚Äôt have a new clue goal set atm, I kinda got everything I could think off; all untradeable rewards from clues, gilded, noted pots, 3rd age, 10k mediums and bloodhound.
---
Any luck on your screenshots?
---
At the end of the day it failed a poll vote. At this point as much as I love the memes the best thing for those who want it is to look up times when Jagex has repolled something and have it pass the poll a second time. If Jagex hasn't gave content a second chance or only does it rarely what makes people think Jagex will this time?

Luck of the draw I suppose
