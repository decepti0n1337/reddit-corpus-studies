Omg I have found a ticket number for my account proving its mine jagex mods if your reading this please look into the hijacking of my account “shadostrike4” here’s the ticket number

This was just posted. How many reddit accounts are you ROTards going to make to spam this trash?
---
2 clicks either way

They had access to my email. My computer got logged.

Mid you get keylogged your essentially fucked
---
you should expect to be there for another 7k  
---

---
god speed, it will be worth it and provided you don't do anything retarded you will never have to do this specific grind again  
---
for the record, it is not any different than clearing a GWD collection so if this is outside of your ability you may want to just De-Iron.  
---
god speed.

The Tor network typically has a very small number of exit nodes and most exit nodes are either publicly listed or easily discoverable.
---
I had a RC bot within the top 100 highscores at one point. It takes an hour doing fire runes to get 40+ not a big deal.
---
TIL moms credit card is at the air altar. Brb boys.
---
With the release of mobile and the influx of new players to the game, does Jagex have any plans to do another Character Name Release as was done in March of 2017?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm sure there are a large number of both veteran and new players who would love a chance to claim a display name they desire but are currently unable to obtain due to inactive or banned accounts occupying the names. As someone who returned to OSRS after mobile was released, I found it extremely difficult and time consuming to come up with a display name I was content with.
---
Pretty shitty drop if u ask me
---
puff daddy
---
I don't get why we can't have an activity that's fast but at the same time requires skill and is challenging to the player.
---
I mean aren't activities like Volcanic Mining and Sullicep Mushrooms cool because of this? I wish other skills shared an activity as dangerous as those two.
---
You haven't been to the wilderness much have you?
---
PKers kill players when they're walking around with 0 risk anyway. 
---
Java is a shitty language and it's really badly optimized on macos. Macbooks always try to stay silent to the very end of 90+ cpu temps. When I used my 2015 mbp to play runescape I had some software that could be used to tweak the cpu fan speeds up.
---
But can it play Tekken though?
---
I'm not sure what you are objecting to. I don't really know what the fuck the helm does other than something to do with venom. I'm just saying that if level 126s are deep wildy PKing while wearing the helmet then there is obviously some use for it and it isn't dead content. 
---
Just nerf neiz helm thing is stupid op. Neiz should give - range and mage stats like berserker. And serp needs reduced zulra scales use now that it doesnt venom.
---
Yes, I've donated a few spades in my time
---
You're talking about an efficiency that normal people can't reach. You're talking about the .1% of the game. 
---
You're right. The only thing you can do is be more careful. About websites you visit and things you download.
---
The simple fact is, the easier it is for you to get your account back, the easier it is for someone to steal it from you. That is why it's so hard to get it back. Because it's hard to take it in the first place. 
---
I just guess a lot of people are excited for seeing someone overcome a different challenge than what the base game offers and what a lot of other youtubers have done in general.
---
It's a change and a challenge. Sure he has to get lamps for 15 con and mindnumbing hunter.
---
But there's so much more involved in it too. The lamp grinds are secondary. I don't think anyone is mad hype over the 10 month lamp grind lmfao.
---
I mean technically the April Fools', Birthday events and Crack The Clue aren't holiday events either, can't recall anyone being mad during those. The holiday thing was just made up as a front to deflect criticism of homophobia.
---
They should bring back the original Graceful, it looked so clean.
---
something around 800M
---
That solution doesn't change much at all: it would just continue to be slightly better but more expensive barrows (pretty much same melee def, worse range def, str bonus, poison protection.) 
---
I think for something as expensive as a serp helm, it should be the dominant helm overall with a few niche uses for neitznot and barrows.
---
* Neitznot would be the bargain option, and the best if you're not really concerned with def.
---
* Verac would be good for caves/inferno/solo sara where you need prayer
---
* Torag/guthan would be better for solo Bandos because of the 12 range def
---
This also leaves room for another helm that's better offensively for melee at the expense of defense.
---
How many weeks of tears of Guthrix? 
---
Idk why you assume that i am, or even if i was that its a bad thing some how
---
This world be nice. But for the time being if you're up for it you can find little batches if code that run in command prompt (.bat) which will check the ping of every single world then spit out the world with the lowest ping at the end.
---
Hahaha
---
I’m just going to say it, you are full of shit
---
Calling it now, you said you got cleaned at the duel arena?
---
You got cleaned, sold your account, then tried tor Recover it when the buyer loaded it with gold and now you’re pissed off because they got warned and took the gold off before you could recover the account.
---
You’re a scamming piece of shit most likely.

---
Test comment please ignore 
---
Removed it for no reason? Keep making shit up. The reason was that it was broken. You can still venom minions with serp + BP/tentacle 
---
Which they've done plenty of times already.
---
Great! That'll get me to 10 rc on my new ironman

---
Hahahah!!! Get a load of this guy!!

I'm 13 and I just started in 2018
---
"ya bitch" killed me
---
Yo make him play so it’s like having a bot
---
Can you sort this by location then in order of number? 
---
Wait till 60-70 :) I recomend watching stand up comedy in the background. Only thing that keeps me safe while I grind 
---
I’d imagine the reverse is true.
---
Maybe a VPN will do the trick. Worth a try.
---
Temperature is around negative frostbite here in Toronto area
---
Aw man, having to click autocast iban blast is so annoying.
---
Did you blast/trident the skeleton/bloodworms? I usually whip them to save charges.
---
Having trident also lets me freeze melee brothers with ice burst instead of using prayer prayer pots. Probably not very gp efficient but way more enjoyable personally. (Full pray -&gt; Ahrim -&gt; Karil -&gt; Everyone else)
---
It's been talked about by the Jmods for so long, I just wish they'd implement it. Heaps of people were suggesting an agility course around ToB to earn it
---
Rs3 came after eoc so you have something wrong lol
---
How the fuck u can be sure its "safe", only the creator knows that. I ve seen so many topic with scammed/stolen acc's. Im more than sure half of em are caused 3rd party (to make game ezpz) software. Are u guys like autistics or something, u cannot play the game without help?
---
99 fisting
---
I'd recommend downloading a task manager, there are probably some background apps that you can kill off to help. At least, that's what works for my Fire 7
---
I've just been using an onscreen keyboard.
---
In my opinion, warding aligns more with runecrafting than crafting. It just makes sense as warding and runecrafting are crafting by magical means. 
---
I'd say more people can, they just prefer the safer easier methods. I was mainly just pointing out how off the rates assumed were! 
---
Then why are so many OSRS players against it?
---
Yeah you guys did fine. It sucks only having 1 bgs as well. Nice tank.
---
Lmao didnt blur prayer, Im stealing that shit
---
So that’s why I’ve seen people leave so many drops behind. I’ve looted probably 200k worth of items during tasks from them leaving shit. Rannars for days
---
Unironed shirts are causal as hell don’t hate m8, tell your friends.
---
Don't worry I'm not that retarded 
---
Since you dont watch his area restricted ultimate ironman, I doubt he does anything to you.
---
I believe the software was macs fan control. You can set nice temperature curves with. For example at 55c the fans speed is 35% and at 80c 90% and so on...
---
I reckon C Engineers’ PvP only HCIM series is awesome. It’s up there. 
---
Tbh you coulda done so much better on gear choices like obsidian legs bandos plate serp helm uncharged sgs obby cape (r) d boots (g) eternal glory but I get the joke.
---
They're all over pyramid plunder as well. They have the weirdest stats, lvl 45 melee stats with the rest at 1 except for 90+ thieving.
---
I feel the same way.
---
I recommend malwarebytes and malwarebytes adwcleaner. They're honestly one of the last standing reputable anti-virus companys. Malwarebytes pro is also extremely cheap, like 10 bucks for forever if you buy it for live protection.
---
Nice, congrats
---
Why do I never see people use Odium wards?
---
It's got the 3rd highest range bonus in game for only half the price of the archers ring
---
Yes but thats at the high levels. With a skill like smithing looking at the blast furnace [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/htmlview#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1SlxbHJokMGsPGqIHcY4SXvzouuYdbZ8TYHYCbFRTWXA/htmlview#). At similar levels (up to the 50s) your profits are similar or greater but with experience rates 2-3 times higher. 
---
I'm entirely okay post 70s with the skill but something about the lower levels is atrocious. 
---
How about reworking shit skills like mining, runecrafting and agility?
---
Can we please rebuff the serp helm, it was nerfed to become basically useless and it really should be better as the bis helm... if not can we have a new helm proposed from the gauntlet ect or from one of the new things coming
---
This is really misleading.
---
So, we know from Jagex that there's ~1m subs. We know from highscores there's ~250k active RS3 accounts.
---
Now, [from this page](https://realmpop.com/us.html), we can track how many active characters there are, characters have logged in in the last 6 months. Now every WoW account can have up to 50 characters, though obviously most people don't actively play 50 characters. Most probably play just a few.
---
From that page, there are ~47.7 million characters just in the US, and ~48 million in the [EU](https://realmpop.com/eu.html). This page doesn't track Chinese, Taiwanese, or Korean realms though.
---
But from that data, we know at a MINIMUM, there's at least 2 million subs. Double the number of RS subs, and realistically there's probably 4-5x as many at least.
---
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
So why the discrepancy in google searches? My best guess is that your average RS player does a lot more searches for the wiki than wow players do on wowhead.
---
RS has a lot more items we interact with, a lot more drop tables to look up, a lot more quests that require guides.
---
So you want the reward for frem isles to be purely cosmetic?
---
I’m running a windows defender scan and I’ll probably look for malware too after that. Thanks for the suggestion I really appreciate it 
---
I actually didn't know about this feature. Thanks for making me aware. To the point of the original post I replied to tho i think that calling Arceuus library a good RC training method is laughable, I hate doing it.
---
Show me how to buy 99 agility? Through bonds of course.....
---
thanks. i was looking for the right words and you got em.
---
Excuse me it's swamp Linux 
---
I believe 2004 RS started off as RS2 but became RS once RS1 was renamed to RSC, RSHD was then used interchangeably with RS2

This looks too OP, good idea, but I can see jiggle flex nerfing the shit out of this in less than a week and reduced to that one new weapon we got worth a decent amount to camp boss for a little then totally stop at price dump.
---
Both malwarebytes and adwcleaner run alongside windows defender without disabling it unlike traditional antivirus. Run adwcleaner as I can guarantee it will find something defender missed.
---
Yeah, if they add the gay event, they need to add a hetero event where players can go on a date with Nieve's corpse.

Where are you guys running into these toxic people? Everyone I’ve ever talked to in game has been super chill and all the people I see in youtube/twitch content have been positive and generally cool people
---
I know I'm just starting out and I still have a loooooong road ahead of me, but I'm at about a 200k margin above my hp xp and pretty happy with where my account is overall so far
---
Are you suggesting the cats should burn to death or that they get tiny boots of stone?
---
No, cause depositing everything like if ur trying to do a quest and go to entrana with certain items would piss me off if it did that. Toggle option or hell NO.
---
&gt; So you don’t understand that there’s different levels of morality and how cheating in a game and breaking the rules can be seen a negative morally impactful decision?
---
Construction cape for the free + quicker tele to house and you're good!  
---
Also, you can opt in to bring 25 noted bones and 1250gp if you don't mind the risk
---
Yeah thats bullshit, I constantly move hundreds of mills between alts and never once been banned for it.
---
You spelled elly wrong.

Damn that’s a rip man

you can already do this using the fill all option

Say to her "while I would obviously choose you over video games, I find it disturbing that you would make me choose between 2 of the things that make me happiest in my life." and then add "I don't think we're going to work out" or "can we make a compromise" or whatever you're thinking is best

God damn i hate agility
---
Cool update for the 100 remaining pvpers
---
I head “Swamp legs” for the first 5 episodes.
---
you mean your “girlfriend” did?  ;^)
---
I made a walkthrough [Here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rogues%27_Den#Walkthrough_(Thieving_51+))
---
.  Don't worry, it's easy.
---
Wait, does this happen? Because I'm going to do that quest tomorrow...
---
Partyroom to small and building to the mines to big maaaan

Nice
---
WW3 has started, all POW’s are being forced to do lavas on one account and seers agility on 2. Anything below 90% efficiency is 1 day without food... they killed them selves.
---
Well you can argue btws have to run around getting stuff in order to be able to bank stand 
---
Imagine spending years on an account for like $2000.
---
I don't think I've ever seen an untrimmed Slayer cape in the wild.
---
Or you just list viewed your drops and reset all your other kills.
---
It is worth mentioning that both of these accounts were included in a list of rsns being mass-reported by bots in Lumbridge. Coincidentally the people running these bots have had their accounts banned for luring, rwt and macro related offences. 
---
It is mind-boggling that you can perform what is arguably a service to the osrs community (hunt down lurers and interrupt them mid-lure) and they can then proceed to have you banned via mass-reporting..
---
Lol I hope this made you feel better about yourself. I do have a career and a family, and I play 1-2 hours per day. I was calculating whether or not it makes sense for me to spend those 1-2 hours just farming end game bosses or if it'd make more sense to take some time out of my 1-2 hours to do some herb runs.
---
Again, hope you were able to cheer yourself up a bit :)
---
There has been an update with new seeds, old nests dont give those seeds so they give you different nests since the update :)
---
copypasta
---
I couldn’t play a game for money for me it would become a job and I’d hate it being forced to play 
---
Really? Cuz every time I meet an ironman out doing slayer with a fire cape they're going to tell you all about their business and how you're living your life wrong.
---
tl;dr
---
Can’t support because marks are solely from rooftops which the wilderness course is not.

Ah I see thank you!

Magic KO wep, i like that, interessting

Chicago Western Suburbs checking in.  It got to -25 with a -50 F windchill. NOPED right out of going outside today!

---
Ftfy
---
This is fucking terrifying. 
---
Redundancy maybe?
---
Already got the whole set. I appreciate it though!
---
I always pick up my loot in addition to what they leave behind. Just go to the kurasks in fremmy caves and go nuts. When I got there the first time there was about 7 people and the floor was littered with herbs and other misc shit. Then I went to the top floor and there was even more people doing the same, had no idea what was going on
---
[Just in case](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Desert_Treasure/Quick_guide), I followed this and got through it in a few hours. Good luck.

Remove all skills and just have Strength, HP, and Slayer.

I know right? People think they want bots gone but the truth is the bots are doing all the shit nobody wants to do. It's actually a lot of work getting a bot farm set up and running. 
---
Bots are a crucial part of RS. Let's see how you like it when jugs of water are 200gp ea because the bots are gone...
---
Oh you're right..
---
I'm sorry let me correct what I said. 
---
Bonds are a P2P way to speed up every skill except agility.
---
And everyone was downvoting me when I said there was bots cutting teak at castle wars and theyd say the same shit over and over again or logout if you said "bot?"

I'm 70/77/75, with 76 range and 63 pray. I'm wondering what order to level my combat stats so i can start bossing more efficiently. I'm using rune cbow and diambond bolts at KBD right now but can only stay for 3-4 kills solo. Do i need more def first? Higher range?

Well I’ve heard people say you can already make the xerican magic armor via crafting, so why not mystic/splitbark etc. but yeah I agree with you. RC is more magic based

---
I don’t hate agility but it’s definitely not my favorite either. Definitely worse before the canifis course so maybe do barb fishing to 40 and then go there. One thing I did to help when I was grinding for my graceful was I got my marks in chunks to break up the monotony. I did 115 one grind session, 75, 40, 30, (you can see the luster wearing off lol) basically grinding for big pieces to keep me driven and feeling rewarded afterwards but I would suggest doing it in more digestible chunks because I was honestly pretty burned out afterwards
---
Im guessing your pretty well on the point considering the downvotes on my previous comment.  My friends who play RS3 at one point of time arent as in tune with the community as I thought they were
---
It’s more like if they made a dark skin characters awareness event. There’s a time and a place for social justice but a medieval RPG is not one of them. Being opposed to civil rights movements in a video game doesn’t make someone racist or homophobic 
---
Only real men play RuneScape LMAO.
---
But no I don’t play fortnite. Wrong again. It’s becoming a pattern with you 🤔
---
Keep those paws creamy!
---
Those arent mountains.
---
Those are *waves*
---
Well I definitely won't be taking it to the wild ;P But yeah, it's been my goal since coming back to OSRS so I am suuuuuper excited to keep on the grind
---
Watching him get so excited over a lamp that was worth 10 hunter xp was hilarious. I feel like it’s his enthusiasm that makes the videos so entertaining.

---
Most good range weapons (MSB, BP, Tbow) are two handed. Usually if you use a Crossbow you need some kind of defensive shield like an Elysian/Crystal/Anti-Dragon
---
Best imo. Settled's just depresses me tbh. 
---
Did you bond 99 fishing? Or mining? Agility? Oh how about Hunter? Who knows maybe you bought 99 woodcutting. 
---
Buyables were never respectable skill capes since you could always buy gold 3rd party
---
At this point everyone who would quit over dxp has done so already and the leftovers are so small that it just isn't really a complaint at all anymore
---
Your lack of self awareness for a start
---
Easier to get caught by the repetitive clicks the bot will do at the bank etc would be my guess
---
That's great. I really wasn't fishing for some EHP nerds sympathy though.
---

---
lets just move the entire game there
---
I totally I support this and it needs to be addressed. I am a defence pure/tank and it would be great to see it come back. The AOE toxic was an Interesting feature that should be re explored imo
---
U know nothing Jon snow
---
meet swamp lettuce
---
In general DPS &gt; Def. The faster you kill a thing, the less chance it has to kill you, so focus on getting range and mage up if bossing is your main goal 
---
I'm sure glad Oldschool doesn't have microtransactions
---
Except the ones I tolerate
---
This community will never vote in any microtransactions
---
Except the ones we tolerate
---
Bonds are okay, but anything else is too far
---
Until they propose the next MTX that benefits me
---
Then he would have to actually use mom's credit card, bro. He hasn't found the drop yet.
---
Then that would give starting out players more ways to make money though. I know when I first started in November the amount of bots made picking up planks a fucking hassle and that was the best "money maker" for no skills on the money making wikia guide..
---
Sure no one wants to do all this shit but Id rather bots be gone that have to compete with them at certain things.
---
You seem to know a lot more about it than I thought i did. In all fairness i based my “you hit harder...” on memory of being a noob 13 years ago when I first started. Since osrs I don’t believe ive ever intentionally trained on accurate. Coulda sworn you hit harder on rapid but if im wrong im wrong 
---
ha ha
---
If you actually think thats a valid arguement, then youre so stupid that no one can help you.
---

Definitely look up J1mmy. He makes humor-oriented videos.

Bro. It's $11 for a month. You'd be getting so much stuff. In fact, you could just buy a single bond at like, what, $6? And use that just for while you train range. You could be getting so much more for a burger and drink homie.
---
I’ve got a maxed 75 def tank, working on my 2.2k stats and trying to do all diary’s.Let me know if you have any specific questions.

Well, if you're into bots then check this beast I found at rune dragons with the nickname "WOJIAOMT"
---
That fucking bot was rank 200 defence... with all meele skills at over 70M xp each, really shitty stats, welfare gear (torags, hasta etc).
---
Absolutly nuts, that acc has already farmed at rune drags over 1,5 billion.
---
This chat is still around? I remember years ago in rs2 days me and my edgy friends were going around trolling clan chats. We found the furry chat on 4chan and fucked with them
---
I mean if we are talking efficiency it's basically always better to do skills at max xp/h no matter your cash stack since pvm is such better gp/h.
---
To the top

Especially the leveling up clips. Really funny guy.

It’s not just that, it’s also constant bug fixing after that as they iron out all the kinks. I could only see that happening if they had nothing else to do.

Dont forget Mining,Woodcutting,Hunter,Fishing,Runecrafting, slayer (which technically could be bought, if buying better combat gear) or theiving.

I'm glad I'm not the only one

Why not 260 spades?

Okay thanks, So my atk str and def is okay for now? Just work on range and mage? Just to be clear, when i level my combat i want to get as much str as i can before i level my other cmbt stats?

Who cares if you play fortnite? it was a rhetorical statement so no it wasn't wrong. That part seems to of flown over you though. As for patterns, I could say the same about you. 
---
Well there are implings
---
after thinking about it, i don't think their alternative sounds like an amazing idea.but from their point of view i can see why they think scouting shouldn't be a thing, it isn't brilliant game design.

Please no. This would make crystal tools dead content for ironmen, and way too expensive for normal accounts, to the point where you can't profit from gathering skills anymore (which is what resource gathering skills should be right, profitable?). They aren't powerful enough to be worth such a high price. 
---
Besides, there is no real logic in recharging a tool with another tool. This mechanic only exists to sink out an overflow of special items out of the economy, to fix something recursively that is clearly already broken. Harpoons and pickaxes aren't available on the market so much as to call it "broken". Axes might be, but smouldering stones are already a good item sink for those.

Cool, thanks for the answer :D

I never said you can't work that much. I've worked more than that. I said you can't work that much AND have time for multiple hours of gaming a day plus a relationship all while tackling daily duties like showering, eating, etc.

lol nope, i've never even tried VR before. also the original guy i was replying to is a real jerk

If you don’t enjoy raids then that’s quite unfortunate because they’re the best moneymakers in game. Otherwise you can kill other bosses for money.

You could buy the same 99s with no risk at lower prices without bonds too, which is why people don't consider bonds P2W because RWT was already in the game.

Main issue for me is I like to play with friends, but any time I get a friend interested in the game, they drop out at the lower mid-levels. At first the game can be fun because you can level up a lot and experience new things, then at high levels you have a ton of content, but at those mid levels theres nothing to really grab interest and I think the best thing would be team stuff. If I could tell a friend I need them on so we can do stuff together, that's fun and keeps us invested. Telling a friend "hey want to do this solo quest simultaneously?" Is kinda boring. And when all my friends drop out at mid level, I wont have any friends for late game stuff.
---
You should have people shout on the streets: "doubling money"
---
"Oh no I can't scout the raids anymore. Welp! Better to quit the game."
---
You're just legit retarded man. 
---
Can someone explain what happened with the pissy jmod?

OSRS is damn boring with it lacks of updates people are creating new challenges for grinding.

It's actually funny how this works

No he doesn't lol. It's not humanly possible. Take five days a week. That's 14 hours a day. That leaves him 10 hours to commute, eat, sleep, bathe, play video games (for hours apparently) maintain a healthy relationship. 
---
Simply not possible. 
---
I wouldn't sell my account for 10k in a heartbeat and I'm not rich at all lmao. I've sunken in thousands of hours, multiple years of my life, into my accounts. You'd have to value your time stupidly little if you think what boils down to 2k dollars/yr is worth 5 yrs of your time.
---
 
---
He also didn't even get a punishment. He said he doesn't even care about losing his account, so what punishment did he get here? If his other accounts got banned THEN he would've REALLY felt the punishment. 
---
This "jealousy" argument is also really annoying. I don't give a shit how much money he made. I'm not that shallow, unlike you apparently. I do give a shit about people getting away scot-free doing something that has been hurting the game for years while having fanboys make excuses for them.
---
The guy's a notable part of the community ffs. If he can get away with RWTing by sacrificing one of his accounts, what makes you think others won't follow suit? "Oh, if only my mule account gets banned while selling gold then why the fuck should I not RWT?!"

Should I use slayer helm and black d hide over full void?

I took a full inv of spades to the wildly agility course a while back after a CC m8 was getting killed repeatedly even after the pker knew he wasn’t carrying stams on him. I showed up and he immediately started attacking me I actively tried to get away thus making him think I had staminas on me. I proceeded to let him kill me. After that my CC m8 said he hopped because he no longer was around after that.

I think he had a heart attack after hitting the spade jackpot.

He probably realised he had annoyed everyone in the community with his irritating personality. I actually started to feel really bad for him. Every time he was on stream a lot of abuse was sent his was, even on the design streams. He also really irritated me too and I would hate to have to work with him but I don't think he deserved all the hate 
---
!RemindMe 12 hours
---
Yeah, but saying the things a LOT of people were saying is homophobic. No pride event in our game = political. Kill the faggots = homophobic. Or do you mean to say there were only political threads/memes around that time?
---
Yes except for undead tasks like Vorkath and Aberrant Spectres.

Like I said I can clear all of the rooms, I don’t find any of them particularly hard, (especially vanguards it’s simple math) but I def don’t think vespula should begin the hatching process prior to entering the room.
---
And no, the unfair complaint is completely valid. Better late than never on game breaking issues sure. I’m not complaining about zulrah, that was a quality/needed nerf.
---
DWH safespot and and raids scouting though are not issues in terms of the economy or longevity of the game. Raid items are still expensive as fuck, and raids are still the most time consuming pvm content.
---
DWH price has not went up since safespot removal. Not only that, the safespots inside the canyon weren’t even entirely “safe” and it was still possible to aggro other shamans. Bots would of died. Idk about the swamp safespots I never used it.
---
If you trade the gold to the mule your main gets chainbanned. Thats not how things work.
---
Also thats straight a lie. You and every fucking person on this subreddit would. Maybe you dont THINK so now, but if you were actually offered your thought of it would change VERY quickly, like every person who doesnt make a living off their account.

You are just straight jealous and any talk of morals is total bullshit. You have no clue what you are talking about but I guess i shouldnt expect much from the incels that populate this subreddit.

Their system does not do this. They are extremely conservative when applying rwt bans per a mod post a while back. There needs to be a good deal evidence before the account is flagged.

What’s funny is I was gonna actually change my name to something I’d keep for a while hahaha I had 1 more day till I could change, but this is a pretty good name too 😂😂
---
Learn to actually SOLO a raid as it's intended to be random. My first times raiding where the best with all the surprises. I'm so glad they are changing it so you are forced to so a randomized raid like it was meant to be.
---
Yea mad that’s not gonna change as long as this game is FTP so just kinda got to deal with the FTP ones and try get rid of all member ones

The construction cape would indeed be the only possible upgrade here - free teleports and 1 inventory space saved. However, you are more likely to die while wearing it because you'd have to sacrifice the defensive bonus of the leg slot in order to protect it in death, so I don't recommend risking that
---
Stop it they release plenty. It’s a youtube series for entertainment
---
Quickest route imo. Quest to barrows gloves then at least MM2 (DS2 is also great for Vorkath and bis melee gloves). Get 70 prayer and unlock Piety (even better to go to 74 and grab Rigour) NMZ to 90 base melees and Chin/Barrage to 90 Range/94 Mage in MM2 tunnels. From there, slay your ass off when you’re not bossing.

holy shit man take a chill pill, its tagged as humor for a reason

Did you even consider for 1 second that perhaps the technology existed that would allow you to login to your Reddit account from the very computer you were taking a shitty picture of?
---
Yea, members has much fewer, all skillers basically. Never see them doing other stuff, I hear there’s a zulrah bot though.
---
If that's your coping mechanism, go ahead. It's not my fault you're too stupid to understand that the game in question was only a placeholder and was used to show your incompetence. In other words I was essentially saying "you're about as dumb as someone who plays fortnite". Doesn't matter if you play it or not.
---
I'm not your bud btw. Keep commenting and I'll keep debunking you.

Yeah I’ve done it before then saw the shitty design and said fuck this iPhones better . :)

Since half the player base is bots no it isn't just you

There is 0 rng involved in zeah library, if you don’t know the method the literally google it, and watch woox’s guide. Rng doesn’t play a factor
---
I’m not going for max I’m unlocking aspects of the game. The highest I’ll ever want it to be is for the elite diaries and then I’ll be completely done. 
---
I can understand the dedication and work put into it and I think nobody is seeing that I don’t want a complete overhaul nor the suggested idea in this poll, I think the early levels are concerning, so the most that would be devalued is a few hours. Kind of annoying that people are misunderstanding what my issue is with. 
---
Woops, overlooked that, good catch. Maybe Ankou would've been a better example.
---
No one actually cares besides your friends in your little club

Please make your own subreddit 😁

Oh man if this actually does work I'm gonna try it next time I see one these guys..

I wouldn't be too upset lol

The incentive for everything should be that it's enjoyable to do. Rewards should be icing on the cake.

Not necessarily. It they literally just add some rocks that you mine ash from, or something like that, it can be done with existing art assets.

So you are basing this on absolutely zero facts. 10-4

In reality no one in this thread knows for sure how the rwt detection system works. You’re guessing that’s how it works. I’m guessing there’s a significant amount more to it.  From the few mod posts on the subject, what you’re saying is not in line with what the mods have said. 
---
I’m at work rn but I’ll try to find the comment I’m thinking of. I’ll pm you once I find it since I found it pretty insightful to their ban system and review process. 
---
Not at all, you’re using bis. The dude I replied to was arguing serp helm was great at zulrah just bc it saves an inv space 
---
There are zulrah and Kurask bots but yea skilling and training combat basically (nmz sand crab etc)
---
Dvt?
---
Well no one tried to play it seriously. They would get banned because they were trolling and thus cried on reddit because they couldn’t destroy the account that others put work into.

haha you think most of RS have jobs?
---
I... uhh.... did you read my original post?
---
I can solo lol. In fact I only solo, and I can clear all the rooms. Doesn’t mean I think they’re designed well or should be done. Tekton is garbage for players without dwh or bgs, vespula you may as well abandon solo if it isn’t the first room of a floor cause if not the grind will hatch by the time you get there. Theiving room is just crap. Ice isn’t rewarding for the time put into it.
---
When a raid can range from 1hour solo completion time to over 2 due to different numbers of rooms or what’s in those rooms, it’s bad design. Scouting is necessary to avoid poorly made content imo
---
The Dodgers already got that New England dick, Rams are next! 
---
Play a different fucking game.  RS3 isn't as shit as this sub makes it out to be and has a lot more to do.  Stop trying to change a game that you don't like and maybe find one that you do like.  
---
You guys don't seem to realize that after you have maxed there is literally nothing to do except keep grinding.  And if you reach that point (you won't) you'll bitch and moan about lack of "content" without realizing that the grind *is* the content.

Purp is excellent
---
Game integrity updates most likely will never be polled because what’s best for the game isn’t how people are likely to vote- players will rarely vote to nerf things they like even if they’re overpowered or convenient 
---
Can confirm this works. Just tried it on my Kurask alt lol thank you! 
---
As I said in another comment:  
---
Did you have your accounts mass-reported by a group of players who also ran bots encouraging people to report you? No? Well then, bit of a false equivalence...
---
Working harder for stuff is the point of an iron man but it doesn't make you special.

Where did they mention black d hide? What did they say about it?

Because I enjoy the game mode, I said it was long and dull- but I never said I was avoiding doing the grind for that reason.

Bull fucking shit, if this game dies, it is because instead of customer support, money is thrown at the fucking cheaters every DMM.

What's the point of trying to lure more 0 risk people into the wildy just so 'PKers' can 'pwnz sum nubz' and grief people trying to get something done?
---
If people want to fight each other, they should be totally encouraged to do so. Add more PVP weapons, PVP armours, PVP worlds, PVP minigames. But let's stop with "pvp" content just being trying to lure more skillers and PVMers in to the wildy for just to be killed risking nothing.

you buy things from various shops, planks for construction, runes and so on.

Buying from shops, construction, Kingdom management, crushing secondaries /making unf potions in Nardah are the primary uses of gold that I've experienced.

---

---
rc is agility with extra steps
---
It's been posted like a dozen times so at this point it's spam
---
I'm assuming Theatre of Blood and other things such as Inferno Cape is out of the question? 
---
I mean I did “abuse” the canon safespot for dwh in the canon lol. That funded a good amount of membership time for my iron before I quit my non iron all together. I’m not complaining I didn’t get to “abuse” it, I’m xomplaining it was “fixed” despite not being polled or stated as an issue.
---
If it was an issue they could of fixed it within a few days by rearranging some grass and other scenery. Or at the very least said it wasn’t supposed to be safespottable. Instead they let it go on, and then introduced a new swamp area with even more safespots.
---
Then they decide to patch it over a year later, conveniently not long after most big name streamers get theirs. Like I don’t believe in streamer favoritism for the most part. Some people say they’ll go as far as to “give” certain people drops by making it happen in game. I think that’s absurd. But the time frame between big name streamers finishing dwh and tbow grinds, and then addressing the resulting source of those items borders on excessively convieniant. And neither case was it made an issue earlier.
---
They said they wouldn’t make content changes without polling it unless it was game breaking. It wasn’t by any means. Dwh is no more expensive now than the days before the nerf. And look at raid rewards lmao. You think there’s an excessive amount of tbows or ancestral robes in the game? Far from, it’s still time consuming content. If anything the amount of points mass raids generate is a WAY bigger economical issue than scouting.
---
Even if the dwh safespots were still here I would use canon and blowpipe out in the open like I do, for more kills p/h. I just think it should of been polled because it wasn’t game breaking in any manor. Neither is raid scouting. Zulrah nerf made sense. Konar table nerf makes sense. I could even get behind a small hydra nerf (though not too big given the slayer req). Raid scouting just doesn’t fit well with me.
---
I don’t think raids need to be any more solo friendly, I love solos. But I don’t think raids should be a blind thing given their layout and how poorly designed some boss/room mechanics are.
---
The amount of time, and skill/gear, required to complete a raid varies far too drastically, because it’s designed bad.
---
Crabs-rope-shamans-mystics-guardians
---
Vs.
---
Tekton-vanguards-vasa-ice-theiving-vespula-vasa-mutas 
---
That’s literally over an hour difference in completion time for a solo player. I haven’t done team raids so I don’t know how that scales, but still indefinitely longer.
---
What about that makes sense? That’s complete fucking garbage design imo, and scouting is necessary to navigate it.
---
If they insist on getting rid of it, which I don’t think they should, they need to do a lot more than their proposed fixes for vesp, Tekton and theiving.
---
Giving raids a set layout, always x boss rooms and y puzzle rooms, and always a prep room after x amount of rooms, would be a start.
---
And the scrolls are an aweful idea.
---
ur strange thats right
---
Definitely a lot harder but I think doable? Not entirely sure.  
---
you're toxic.

I remember getting shit for wearing the skirt every once in a while, as if a handful of players weren’t guys prancing around as women for most of their playtime.

Herblore is 100% the worst skill to train. There is exactly 1 way to train it. From level 3 all the way to 99. Training it goes the exact same way the entire time. Withdraw X unfinished potions. Withdraw X secondaries. Combine. Repeat. Also no potion at any level is ever profitable to make compared to selling the ingredients on the GE and buying the potion. Combine that with the fact that every potion anyone needs is tradeable so that nobody ever needs to train herlore to make their own potions. The only use for training herblore is for completing Fairytale II and for achievement diaries.

Weird to see my current weather represented in an osrs meme

There is only a scouting plug in

This is more accurate for regular accounts... imagine storing 28 sharks in your backpack lmao

Me too, it's not a perfectly funny joke but it feels very aggressive for not the right reasons. 
---
The owner of the accounts has used that link only to receive an automated reply stating that permanent bans aren't appealable. If this were a manual ban he would've left it at that but since it's an automatic one and there is evidence suggesting it may have been unjust, the owner and his friends are wanting to pursue this as much as they can in order to invoke a statement from Jagex.

yes, i don't think anyone understands what they're doing. Herb runs used to be 200k profit for like 5patches now you have to do 8 ... 9... 10 for the same profit.  Their goal os to make herb runs take 40 minutes so you can do them continuously and make them 200k/h constantly botted.

winter 2022. go back and watch some of the past q and as to get a feel for how long it will take.
---
Is there still a "best" placement though?
---
I'd love if the destinations were in the right-click menu, e.g. Travel White Wolf Mountain. I have definitely sent myself the the GE accidentally more times than I'd like to admit.
---
This makes sense. I didn’t really get it since I’ve been back after a long break and always just did things the fastest way for me to do them, not technically striving to be a perfectly efficient player. 
---
He could, but your body gets used to that within a few months and he’s been doing this stuff for how long?
---
honestly they should just buff mage armor and be done with it. it's not like a buff to mystic or salad robes would do anything to pvm or bossing
---
They should announce its release, and only make it available in a single world.  Everyone will flock there, and it will be a huge clusterfuck.  But theres a catch.... they actually didn't even add it to the game, they just fuck with everyone!
---
they've said they're going to work on this, in the mean time get good and get 99 mage.
---
Sure thing, stay safe out there. 
---
? There are plenty of non-rooftop courses... Roof-top courses aren’t even the best xp/hr at the moment.
---
Idk why but that gives me chills 
---
It’s beautiful 
---
Always. Have a good night
---
Defensive stats and prayer bonus are why people use Veracs pieces. Barrows gloves are also bis for a reason so just use them. Vambraces become useless once you have them. 
---
Not sure if you’ve ever done fight caves but unless you can prayer flick against multiple combat styles you’ll need defensive stats to tank damage. Nonetheless good luck. 
---
I'm just surprised at how hard it is to find them. It can't be that difficult to track repetitive movements.
---
Just need the one for the elite diary, thanks! 
---
I bet you wear a combat bracelet
---
darn. thanks for replying. 
---
I dont like looking like a blob?
---
That's interesting. :o Were you just googling the soundtrack?
---
Only using magic agaisnt the melee ones, whip in the dungeon. You should use barrows tab and ring of dueling, after each chest just use the ring&gt;bank&gt;portal&gt;barrows tab, you use 0 to 2 sips per chest, if you dont get ahrim/karil, you can safespot in the squares rooms or one of the long sides rooms, making use of 0 sips of pray pot.
---
I tried many methods, i only used trident, because i could spend i little bit more, i like the randomness of the chest, but for consistent profit, iban would be better, at that time, dunno now, its easily calculated.
---
No need for barrage, just do dharok&gt;karil&gt;ahrim, the rest of them you can facetank easily, maximizing the profit and minimizing the cost.
---
Barrows isnt that great too, if you do super efficient runs, you can do \~12 without max stats, its impossible to do even 1m of pure profit in barrows consistently , if you use toxic, 60% of the profit goes to the staff, its dumb to do barrows with it and no point doing barrows maxed. 
---
I did count about 200 and something chests, some hours i was super focused, others watching something else, but just to myself, it was 400k gp/hr, with hard diary, pretty bad, i was at the time 80 in each combat stats, if you have more than that, barrows is irrelevant.
---
I can tell you 100% that barrows isnt worth, just train slayer and do wyverns or gargs, super afk and same amount of money or that furnace minigame, you get 600k gp/hr with mith bars.
---
Woah. My birthday is not until October though... (my name is also Logan 😂)
---
Make the high alch value 15k thus making it an alternative to pyramid
---
Settled
---
Does each fossil storage crate have its own inventory or are they connected? Can I put a fossil in a crate on Fossil Island and withdraw it in the crate in the Varrock Museum?
---
Remove barrows, its just bad.
---
The drop table is fine, just the weighting of the task and the unforgiving special attack needs changed in my opinion. 
---
because of the upcoming Song of Elves update *(poll)* that would introduce the crystal axe.
---
"Once a piece of equipment degrades, it will revert into a Crystal equipment seed. The **Dragon item** used to create the equipment will be recovered but the Crystal shards will not"
---
I'm an afternoon to late night player so I see alot of bbd bots so, I just leave kills 80% finished and bring half the ppots, letting them do alot ot the work. Works best if theres 2 of them you're sharing a world with.

---

---
Unfortunately, that is correct.
---
&gt;I am asking if they said "Hey, we will hide the polls only if voting changes to 70%"
---
That's not how the voting works in Runescape. The would poll 'do you want the polls to be hidden' and 'If the polls are hidden, should the threshold be lowered to 70%'.
---
if you’re going to give your useless opinion, try to make it less shit.
---
Should add a new f2p boss to deep wildy and have its only drops be big bone and rune axe

When anothwr scaper gets this ip adress shuffled to them they are immunized. Consider it vaccinating your ip adress!
---
Depends on how you plan to pk. Just so you know, 13 prayer is really good for g maul pures at 80+ strength. It’ll make a big difference in your special attack damage. This is an ideal build for pking around edgeville/pvp worlds. 
---
For anything deeper you’ll want 43, potentially 52, along with the appropriate magic and ranged level to survive out there.  Hope this helps you 
---
I first began my Runescape journey on Tdc Kagen 14 years ago. Before Runescape 3 came out, my only decent stat at the time was 99 fletching.
---
The utter confusion I felt upon the release of RS3 back in the day I wouldn't do justice writing about. So I'm not going to. Suffice it to say I spent many hours trying to get the hang of the new way of things....but I never could get the hang of it. I just stopped everything. I quit the game entirely.
---
Fast forward a good few years. I started getting emails from Jagex about old school runescape being released again. At the time, I was stationed in South Korea while serving in the army. I honestly couldn't be bothered, and couldn't give a f\*\*\* less about anything RS related. I had been out of the scene for years, and the way I saw it, the game I love screwed me. If I ever logged in again, I decided, it would be a very cold day in hell.
---
That cold day in hell came when I became one of the lucky beta testers for Osrs Mobile. I had since shattered my L4 vertebra, became divorced a second time, and had nothing else really to fall back on. Runescape gave me purpose again. I feel like a lot of you guys on here can relate to that. I've spent months browsing this sub without a post, and finally found the courage to do so. I know this isn't the biggest accomplishment, so please take it easy on me in the comments. 
---
Thank you all for reading this, and without further adieu, my first 99 since coming back to the game. Hope to talk to you all in game soon! Peace brothers...and happy grinding!
---

Agility affects how fast you regenerate your run energy.

I've died several times due to random events beyond my control like my net lagging and disconnecting. Don't know why you fault other people for playing safe when tens of thousands of hours can be undone because of circumstances in a split second beyond one's control.

That is literally just a picture of a person playing, there is nothing sexual about this except girr fact that there is a female???

So far two people in this thread alone have confirmed that rwt bans can be automated, if the ban wasn't automatic it would say manual, it didn't... Try again sweetie. Also seeing as my friend has literally never interacted with a Kiwi in his life I suggest you stop making baseless claims, wouldn't surprise me if *YOU* were xxnx.

Yup I quite like rfd for most part tho

Yea nah

The weebs would appreciate it being called Nechryandere instead!
---
Imagine playing the game for long enough to have 33m, and still falling for literally the oldest trick in the book. Gf bank.
---
Nah im not a vegan. Not 100%, it's just that I realized it's the more ethical choice, and that it's doable.
---
It is interesting to watch new ideas go trough different stages before being widely accepted. For you it seems to have reached the stage where you feel threatened enough to respond to it.
---
It should also be known that the first 50 levels of Agility give you 50% energy regen while the last 49 levels only give you another 11%. If you only care about energy regen, just crank out 50 agility.
---
Hey guys, I’m so grateful everyone is still interested in these! I’ve gotten a few messages asking for updates and I apologize for not responding sooner. I was in contact with Jagex before the holidays, but have not heard back since then (which is understandable), so not much has happened yet. Sorry I can’t give an exciting update, but thank you for staying interested and being patient! 
---
Guess I'm r/outoftheloop

Good thing you're not an UIM

Cmon we like adieu better xd

That’s what made it for me I wasn’t quite sure it was quality till I saw that 
---
I'd want it to be a buffed version, not just a recolor.  Give elite marks some requirement like  80 agility to be able to have them spawn, make them tradeable, make buffed graceful have agility requirements to wear, also 80.
---
this was good
---
Not at all. Look at somebody like Thorin who has autism and his job is literally to speak about esports. He's very eloquent. As for enthusiasm, that can very easily *come* from autism, narrow or extreme interests in specific topics are common. 
---
Not much has changed, check out Konars slayer monsters if you have the level
---
Besides what others have said about the ultimate purpose (combating RWT)
---
think of it in terms of opportunity cost. How many people do you know would seriously spend that much money to play RS when they could comfortably afk it in game? I mean I  make pretty easy money, but I don't know that I'd waste 125 USD of my real hard earned cash on Runescape. Think of the real life stuff you could spend that on instead.

Can we get a QOL update to spirit trees? Atm their scaling with level doesn't match the number of spirit tree patches. 
---
83 for 1 patch
---
91 for 2 patches
---
and 99 for all patches doesn't make sense when there are more than 3 patches in the game.
---
lol.
---
exactly. And Jagex bets their business on people being discouraged from buying too many at a time, and it works.

End goal should be to hit 10 subscribers on youtube, because no one actually cares about these snowflake ironman accounts

I actually don’t understand why you can use Trident in Castle wars but not the wilderness. Similarly, you can venom people by casting spells with a Toxic Trident in the wilderness (1 am req btw), but cannot cast the tridents built in spell in the wild.
---
Just let it be useable in the wild, it’ll add some nice variety by making magic viable outside of bridding and venging while meleeing or ranging.

Autumn elegy was the first guy to go for pets and other miscellaneous stuff. His "completionist series" is still really good if you haven't watched it.

Then he drifted away and got 30m base stats and after that started the 200m mining grind instead. It's a shame that he didn't stick to pet hunting and trophy collecting.

His in-depth guides to skills and game mechanics were really good. I think that's what the community lacks right now.

Great Reddit name to ask this question, and if you have runelite it should be named "Inventory Tags" as a plug-in, then you right click your inventory icon, and click "change inventory tags" and then right click on items and select the color tag, then right click inventory again and select the save inventory tags option

I love Tithe Farm minigame, I just wish there was a reason to do it even with most efficient 5 plot cycle, it’s much much better to do a tree run, which is almost 10 times the xp/h (100k vs 1.2m xp/h).
---
Also the farmers outfit isn’t worth the minuscule 300k extra xp you get on your way to 99, I stayed there for Seed Box because that actually has a decent use for Slayer or camping Skeletal Wyerns. Other than that, Tithe farm is dead content.

Hes clearly asking between the 2 sets though. Maybe he isnt able to spend the time on getting a torso.

So yes the obby plate/leg are better. You always want to maximize the highest +str bonus you can from gear. And yes the fighter torso is BiS for chest piece (other than bandos chest, which that only has higher defense. Same str bonus) if you have the time to go get one. Witha decent team it dont take long.

OwO what's this
---
Jmods always come and give the smack down on people like OP. They claim they didn't get phished and they have 2 step blah blah and then it turns out they've shared their account at one point or gave out enough information to get recovered. Dumb as hell and a waste of Jagex's time.
---
Tagging /u/Mod_SteveW, hopefully he can look in to this. 
---
Meanwhile, I would suggest you to check the recent login activity of your registered email. I don't think they breached it, as they didn't seem to have changed your password and removed the authenticator. 
---
What I'm most curious about is how they breached your bankpin. This indicates that they knew it. You must have leaked it somehow or made it easy to guess (e.g. your birthyear).  
---
If your authenticator was still active, I'm also curious about that. The code change changes frequently and one code stays active for -I believe- 5 minutes. If you did in fact have an authenticator active, you must have given them the code somehow. 
---
Again, if your password/email/authenticator stayed on your account unchanged. I honestly don't know how they got it, other than a RAT or Phishing link (or account sharing/buying). If they were changed then they managed to breach your email or somehow pull off a successful recovery appeal based off compromised details.
---
Unfortunately we can't do anything against compromised details. Only Jagex can disable those after your account has been hijacked...
---
Yeah how dare someone have friends. OP was asking for it
---
B0aty forgot to turn off his stream a while ago

PvE is boring.. Killing a pre-programmed monster that is programmed to be killable by players is hardly worth writing home about. That's beyond boring to me.

I'm trying to do the Dwarf part of RFD in order to get the rock cake. I've done the fishing contest and when I go to Lumbridge, the dwarf is not in the dining room and I don't know why :(

Can we get an update for the Mobile users that still can't play the game ( ANDROID 7.1.1 and more).
---
GUTHIX IS DEAD
---
Love how he includes his mains rank. No one cares. Has nothing to do with your alt acc. My main is sexism and I got hacked please help. 
---
It took me over 2 thousand tokens for the bronze defender I thought I was doing something wrong. After that, it was relatively easy. 
---
You're going to make new people not watch with your trolling. 
---
I am guessing you revealed enough information on twitch over the months/years and someone could finally recover your account. Twitch is prob the biggest security risk of all.
---
Now that is an idea I can *get behind* 😏
---
If you want even easier and more braindead, try elder maul. The dps isnt really impacted that much by the speed because you usually get 1 hit in before switching back to pipe.  It's definitely not optimal but I enjoy it more than arclight.
---
Nice post steal. Saw Op post same thing earlier today. Rip

He's some boi

Marks are like 100k gp per 10 marks, so thats why I do rooftops!
---
Right lol? Being that this was my first task of them I looked up the wiki on them and thought the drop table was ehh. But 15 minutes in i was at 400k and it just kept rolling in lol. 10kgp drops like every other kill.

Imagine enjoying video games - /v/

Following to see response. Sorry to here this bro, I hope it gets sorted out for you.

Another great one for money is Gargoyles. Super profitable- always get 750k-1M per task there.

Yeah i don't even know what to say at this point lmao, i've been blessed with rng these past few weeks it's crazy

---
Wanna send some my way? I just started Lear ing raids 2 weeks ago. Only 70 kc in so far, so I havent earned the right to complain yet, but I would sure love a Tbow drop.
---
Its probably due to the banking system, people have wanted more bankspace for a long time which is also a problem somehow, the bank must be a mess.
---
They should add a whole wilderness town and reward these for the new rooftop agility course there.
---
Probably some cannonball alt. Need to do Dwarf Cannon and it gives Crafting exp.
---
Runescapes account protection methods are literally just security theatre. Jagex could easily solve the issue by adding a delay to your authenticator but they refuse to. I don’t understand why. 
---
Im more impressed your doing vorkath and hydra on mobile
---
Only the real og’s will understand the best monster grinding game of all that is maplestory. I’ve never had more fun playing a game where I could kill thousands and thousands of monsters endlessly and felt so rewarded for the grind. Runescape would have to be the 2nd best but maplestory takes the cake for monster grinding.
---
Most of the people who play this game use a 3rd party client, so yeah. Odds are you’re right. too bad that literally means nothing though
---
If you're an ironman why are you worried about gp/h? On my ironman skiller I did yews from 75-90 and 90-99 at redwood
---
It's a spec weapon 
---
Sounds like you got socially engineered via your stream and they recovered your account. Hence the two step auth becoming obsolete. There isn’t really any other option unless a friend hacked you.
---
&gt; I am guessing you revealed enough information on twitch over the months/years and someone could finally recover your account. Twitch is prob the biggest security risk of all.
---
This is what I was thinking and I agree. It's pretty easy to give out what you think is innocent information but turns out you're just getting social engineered.
---
If the person doesn't have their location on their profile its easy to ask where they're from and then from there you can probably pin point which internet provider they're using so that's already key info. Some people will just straight up tell you their internet provider and when they started playing just not thinking about it. If you wanna gain information on someone via twitch its a cakewalk.
---
Lol
---
just got tang fang, 479 fully complete
---
They were decent back in 2005
---
Haha yeah man, rng can be real weird sometimes. I was grinding Zul for pet gave up at 3.3k kc... that same night after looking up for a new boss to try out, i open Venenatis guide, buy veracs and go for a few kills, 37 later pet lmao. Then in a month i got 4 other pet wayyy before droprate that's crazy
---
-24 and people are referring it to hell, jesus Americans are weak
---
It's a waste of servers. There'll probably be like 20 accounts online in a mory locked server.
---
And ironmen also need to worldhop to buy stuff from stores.
---
hear
---
Tons of items out there that give profit alching. This seems a bit slow tbh
---
That's not how the cape goes on
---
That seems perfectly reasonable I suppose, I figured it was either because I'm not openly begging or people were excited that I wasn't a bot.
---
Lmao 
---
People keep posting pictures of water freezing to random walls and shit.

Pretty fucking cold.

How many gold bars u got in ur bank bro?
---
Took me 28 for first piece, around 120 or so for full set

Can we add a multiple jewelry enchant option?

Yeah im new and ive been given 100k out of nowhere

Man this is the best thing I've seen in awhile. I do the same thing with hats. I always wear hats so I adjust it a lot and on the rare occasion I'm not wearing one I catch myself reaching for a hat that isn't there. Happens every time.

Fastest upvote i've ever given, hope they can see this.

How am I arguing in bad faith? You can't just tell me I'm trying to deceive you and leave it at that, lmao.

No, I'm calling you assblasted because you can't move beyond your hang-ups, and on to the actual fucking criticisms being made.
---
Thanks for proving my point you moron.

I was thinking low level smithing xp as well, think it only requires about 40 
---
Totally intended that

That's pretty much what I said. Zero demand for this kind of thing, or at least not enough to warrant maintaining a server. World hopping is a touch mechanic to replace though.

*implying it is finite

Gotta go next level. Make entire bait accounts. Wait to find out where the gold goes.
---
So in addition to being doctors and lawyers, everyone on Reddit also worked at Jagex?
---
You can speak to Guildmaster Jane to find out how many contracts you have completed. It's not possible to find the breakdown of Hard/Med/Low tier as this data is not recorded.
---
Honestly I've tried doing stuff like that and it felt like more effort than just leashing healers normally. I'd only do this if I was really low def or something.
---
Of course, I just happened to fail that run. I'm sure if it worked it be telling everyone how easy it makes it, as everyone tends to buy into the method that works for them. If you want it as easy as possible, it's probably best to force a spawn and use the "airplane" leash.
---
And if I don't have torso?
---
I shake and cry in pure joy every time I hear it 
---
13 :thinking:
---
For faster smithing and magic xp/hour your better off doing blast furnace (gold bars) and alching an item at a separate moment.
---
its not uncommon?
---
if you're still doing it I want to go graardor, haven't been before though apart from back in rs2 ages ago. 110 cmb

Probably want 75 atk for BGS before you level strength any further
---
People love saying this when it fits them then when they get crashed at Bandos they start wailing about toxic high level players.
---
 Very excited about the Aerial Fishing changes! I hope the higher rate and Angler Outfit give more incentive for players to try out this new content. I'm still afraid it's going to be dead content soon, as it's very click-intensive for rather underwhelming XP rewards. It would be great if you could catch multiple fish from 1 pool since right now the only purpose of this content is to collect the Golden Tench and the Outfit. I'm not asking for top-tier competing XP, just a tad less click-intensive.
---
Why are you under the assumption it only took two days?
---
They could have been working on it for weeks, the blog detailing them only came out two days ago.
---
However, it was Mod Ash's work - so yes it definitely could have all been done in 2 days. 
---
Do farming contracts give the same rewards for medium and hard tasks? I heard they were so I've been doing medium even though I can do hard contracts.

That sounds fucking sick actually. They are found right near me in the WC guild? Awesome. looking up now

---
What's the ideal order to kill the barrows brothers? 
---
Most of the high value accounts being recovered have someone actively playing them. Playing a lot is usually how people build up wealth.
---
You could also just transfer the wealth to another account with an authenticator. On the very slim chance they could recover that account too you could just move it to a new account? I don't see the point you're making, how would you be any worse off with an authenticator delay.
---
It's not like adding an authenticator means they can't do what you're saying to improve security. They aren't mutually exclusive. 
---
Still no drop warning for the golden tench?
---
I’d really like them to look into lowering the point reduction for raids on CB levels under 115, 30% reduction is crazy
---
They've been working on the jar for a while while the helm was a player design. 
---
Really milking this aren’t you, think you’re cream of the crop.
---
No word on removing the 115 cb penalty. 
---
Big oof. But still. They got into his account in one afternoon. There isn’t an excuse for Jagex’s security measures to just not work at all lmao. 
---
It hurts my never missclicking only ironman 
---
I think adding a system where you can remove recovery details is a very bad idea.
---
Scenario 1: p1 goes on vacation for 2 weeks and isn't able to login to runescape. p2 a scumbag hacker recovers him, and removes all of p1s recovery informaton. p2 now has a free account he can sell because jamflex let hm purge all of the accounts recovery details.
---
Lol the day before that got posted I was thinking “man I need to bring that hoodie post up before someone else has the idea”

And the very next day we get void hoodies

Thanks for the response.

wilderness ones are more logs per hour but those ents are in multi-combat and you need to risk it to get the bisquit. i would suggest you to look up some videos for ents from youtube

That's why it's funny

It shouldn’t be 5 grand though. That’s the issue. It’s fucking in game currency lmao. The fact that you “shouldn’t have a fat load of coins” in your account bc you might get hacked is fucking stupid.

Answer: no 2fa on email. The same as every other sob story.

I want to kill Zulrah, but I’m terrified of dying and having to pay to get my stuff just for trying to learn - especially if you don’t use a guide. So this allows you to do stuff like that.

For the western hard diary I need 65 construction to build the isafdar painting but currently have 58 constr. The wiki says I can boost plus 8 w/ crystal saw (which I have) and an orange stew, but I don't have a cat so I'd have to train it. Should I go the route of getting a cat, training it and trying to get orange spices? If yes, how many spices should I get? If no, then what should I train from 58 to 62 and what kind of GP loss would I have? 
---
GE Tracker makes money from subs, it'd hurt their business to hack accounts. Pretty sure there's a disclaimer not to enter any RS login information too.
---
As someone else has mentioned, fake Twitch streams which are view botted to #1 are a pretty popular method to phish account information. I'd also recommend checking your email address/password on haveibeenpwned.com to see if your information was included in a data breach anywhere
---
Wtf is ge-tracker? That just sounds sketch dude, I can almost guarantee that was it or you registered with them using the same email and password you used to register your runescape account. DONT USE 3RD PARTY SOFTWARE. If I'm wrong about both of those you probably clicked a "double osrs xp weekend" stream and then got phished through that.
---
What do you mean?
---
In the words of Sheogorath "I dont like it and it really began to smell to be honest."
---
you don't have to pay to get your stuff at zulrah back
---
No like I'm genuinely curious if it's objectively really fucking cold there or if it's just them not being used to it. Living in Finland I've obviously gotten used to it way more and am subjective, I think people will get triggered but it really wasn't my intention
---
There should be more lines of defence if this keeps happening. Especially when RWT is a thing and people are actually earning thousands of pounds / dollars. At least give us text notifications a that someone is recovering or with the authenticators they should have their own app for it. 
---
Really happy that tournament worlds are permanently open now.  That will be really fun for fucking around and different trying things out.

What about the 115 cb level restriction in chamber of xeric? It’s annoying because it makes me not want to raid with friends who are pures/lower cb.
---
Weird Flex but okay!
---
Oh dang lol thanks for the heads up. At least I can still practice in better gear, while slowly making my way down to gear I’d realistically use. Stuff like that. :)
---
B0aty looked totally different, damn.
---
Sounds like the same thing that happen to a friend.They were banned for macroing, but they hardly trained their skills just logged on to chat before logging off. They were temp ban-&gt;perm ban-&gt; then it was later quashed.
---
there's no retrieval fee at zulrah, but yeah it should be easier to learn with the teleports being free
---
Ughh then people will just burn out after a day or two doing high level content in max gear with no reward like one of those private servers where you spawn in with an inferno cape and dclaws.
---
But like, pretty fucking cold to me is lower than -35 C and up until that it's just cold, I mean sure it's not nice but we have clothes :S

RRRREEEEEEE

No, I cook there.

As a Chicagoan I can confirm this image to be 100% accurate. Just started my car and immediately took damage from the cold. 
---
i dont see the problem, my friends are very low level so it would be fun to just fuck around and practice bosses and such with no risk or rewards
---
On the other hand there's a poll open for over two weeks and none of the changes have been implemented.
---
Highly unlikely but not impossible. And I'd say someone with 350kc does atlest 20k pts per raid since I can do 20-25k in a trio after 35kc
---
You are correct! Thanks for the heads up. 
---
at 122 combat. doubtful.

Can't argue with that lol, just coming from more...exclusive online communities made it seem very odd.  Hopefully one day I can pay it forward and join the fun

At least you actually gain something else while grinding it, though. It's not just literal mindless clicking until RNGeezus deigns you worthy for no intermittent reward whatsoever 
---
Yes, the IQ of this community
---
The same kind of thing happened to me a few times on OSRS. If you ask nicely, there's usually at least one person with some spare gold they can give you. I've asked for gold for teleports before and people are happy to help.
---
I know that its possible but usually people would get some 90s-99s before they get base 80s. Im 2k+ and i still have a few skills in the low 70s.
---
You got my support!
---
Haha! Same with glasses. Ends with poking myself in the eye
---
why not simply make recovering an account impossible when it was logged into the game in the past 3-7 days at least?
---
Fuck you
---
-1150 kc dry
---
The way Runescape works, is that many of the good and easy moneymakers unlock at later levels. We all been beginners before and know how helpfull 100K is at lower levels, and takes ((ages)) to get. However, at higher levels 100K takes about 2 minutes.
---
Youtube is saturated with OK guides. So if you search for anything + OSRS you'll find a guide that will help you.
---
rrrrEEEeEeEEeEEEEE
---
those damn gnomes
---
&gt; Now I do realize that its not a perfect system. As it is vulnerable to social engineering and guessing. However, the key with them is to answer them incorrectly. You don't answer the "What is your favourite food" question with "Pizza", no you answer it with "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple" and other random stuff (like Passphrases).
---
this is the exact reason why the old system got removed. people would set passphrases as their recovery questions and completely forget the pass phrases and it was preventing honest players from recovering there accounts because of how heavily weighted recovery questions were to an appeal.
---
&gt; We do also need more security features than this, like proper notifications when something happens, the ability to view our account login activity (like Reddit and other services do, but without showing sensitive stuff like IPs) and yes, an optional delay on either removing the authenticator or account recovery.
---
they recently did start notifying people about account appeals, whenever you try and manually appeal an account now it automatically emails the registered email a password reset first, in theory if you see a password reset in your inbox you didn't send you know someone is trying to manually appeal you.
---
That's a thing?

the cutest!

What does "feel" even mean? I'm assuming it has to do with humidity?
---
It's dry as fuck here and we get below -40C every year, and that's really fkn cold but when we have like -20C with strong wind it tells me the real feel is in the -40s but it isn't even close to as bad.
---
Does it really matter though? It's a medieval fantasy game, maybe the player character doesn't know wtf is inside so he just calls it chemicals.
---
Bank fillers work, but they are a roundabout multi-step way to accomplish the same goal that a shift-click option would accomplish in a single action. Just because an in game option already exists doesn't mean that QoL improvements can't be made.
---
Blessed image
---
Nobody's suggesting that Jagex implement a delay and never improve security after that, they're just saying that a delay is an easy change to make that would at least give a lot of players more ease of mind (and actually would improve security for a great deal of players). 
---
It is not the last step, but it's a very simple first step.
---
I know a very good reason.
---
scenario:
---
Timmy goes on vacation for 2 weeks, comes back and some venezulean successfully recovered his account and raspberrys him in game because theres nothing jimmy can do to get his account back because jagex auto denies recoveries on played accounts.

Michigan stays relatively "warm" compared to the states west of it, due to the giant lake of warm water. Downside is that the west side of the state gets slammed with lake-effect snow. If you want to see the real cold temps check out Minnesota/Wisconsin/north side of Illinois (Chicago). It's a bit warmer today than it was yesterday, but still pretty bad with the wind.
---
Just FYI it's probably easier learning for you in Void instead of going in max gear, as you will have a lot less switches to focus on while just getting the timing, mechanics and rotations down.
---
You could also just go with tbow-only, but that would mean you wouldn't learn it "properly" for the live game.

Yeah it's more a matter of perspective, at my level it seems like a lot because I have to basically quadruple my current ranged exp to get to 75, but ik that it just gets harder at higher levels and the blowpipe is such a good item that it's worth going for

Plus it should be fairly easy to get the exp while leveling Slayer, I'm just impatient and want to go for a fire cape sooner rather than later

---
One of the first people I've seen comment on the actual issue. Delay is useless when your details are leaked.
---
No one in their right mind thought to take such heavy precautions when they created their runescape account 5-10 years ago. No one expected runescape's in-game currency to hold so much real life value that it would cause bad people to buy database leaks in an attempt to recover accounts with wealth on them. No one has a chance to change any of the details that are used to hand over accounts to a hijacker.
---
The recovery system is archaic, serves no purpose other than fixing something which should be easily preventable. Hacked accounts would occur far, far less if the recovery system wouldn't be around.
---
you look like you're from Michigan. (ohio btw)

if you'd be able to try zuk isntantly inferno cape will become a lot more common lmfao. The ''hard'' part about inferno is that you have to go through hours of waves and if you fail, you gotta do it all over again. If you could just ''try out'' 100 zuk fights in a fakeworld, you can get inferno on first try in main game lmfao.
---
Agreed.
---
Everyone comes with the argument of "BuT mUH f00DcHAiN", as in by getting PVM-ers into Wildy, PK-ers will kill the PVM-ers, and "bigger PK-ers" will come to camp the PK-ers. And the Wildy will be fixed. But that's not even remotely close how it works.
---
In any sensible foodchain, the "top dog" can't be arsed to bother with the bottom of the chain. Because it's not worth his time. That's why it's a chain. A-&gt;B-&gt;C. But since PVM-ers are 1: Easy pickings and 2: Have as much, or in cases more loot than a PK-er, why not just pile on PVM-ers all the time, right? That's not a chain, that's a heap.

There are MANY problems. Income outside wildy is too high. If the way we want to bring PVM-ers into Wildy is by even better rewards, then there will be no reason to kill PK-ers. Just camp those who PVM. PK-ing is also relatively cheap. Welfare gear, and supply costs are mediocre, and the risk is also minimalized compared to the rewards of killing a (90% of the time) helpless PVM-er.
---
It just baffles me how some brainlets still don't understand that simply getting more PVM-ers into wildy won't fix anything. 
---
PK-ing is also a "flawed system" due to the combat system. In the old days it worked, because everyone and his mother went to wildy to PK even with homebrew unoptimized mains. Now you are ether a min-maxed PK account, or you are already on the backfoot. People won't ever want to just randomly walk around the wildy. Putting more content there won't help, but people are so stupid they don't realize it.
---
Rev caves was an "eh" solution. It gives huge profits, but people go there expecting a fight anyway. The multi-nature of the caves forces people to go there prepared, but most just stall for an escape or accept marginal losses on welfare gear. Clans locking down entire worlds also makes that it's once again a non-factor for solo players, neither PVM-ers or PK-ers. So we're back to square one.
---
Can I ask why you went down this route if you knew you were guilty? 
---
All your doing is ruining the chances of legitimate victims getting hold of the support team.
---
I understand it must suck to lose what you've built up over time but that is a risk you take when you dabble in RWT.
---
Yet you sit here and give him your attention nice life moron lol
---
Thanks
---
It means that the rate you get frost bite is at that temperature instead.
---
I'm not talking about your opinion on it. I'm talking about subscription numbers
---
He doesnt know what hes talking about
---
I just used Bitterkoekje's calculator and your claim isn't true. If you use rune darts with void and arma with tbow then your dps is the same. However, rune darts are **crazy** expensive and counter productive if your goal is to make money.
---
Void with the tbow is 8.17 dps and void with BP and addy darts is 8.10 dps. Using rune darts with void brings you up to 8.47 dps at the cost of around 300-400k/hr extra which is not worth it ever.
---
That small fucking thing makes me miss being 10 so much 
---
**Quick**, repost all A Friend memes as Settled memes.
---
wow very smart :O How did I not think of playing on my servers that do not exist?
---
Craziness! I hate that place!
---
What world is it?
---
I can do inferno for fun whereas i cant on my main
---
Ty sir I will try that.
---
She’s wearing an obby cape. Noob level 1000 :p Imagine that.

Thanks for wasting his time and making it that much more difficult for people who are actually innocently false banned to get help.

Runescade
---
Eh I got ~800 manta rays in 40 trips along with sharks and sea turtles when going for the angler outfit. It’s not *completely* worthless. 
---
Jagex flushing all the Miscellania only HCIM back to lumbridge
---
I'm personally definitely going to try out Zulrah, raids 1, Vorkath etc. with the gear I'm working on getting.
---
Sit down kid 
---
Presets were huge but they were just to make mobile banking easy. 
---
This is a pc qol, even though pc benefited from the mobile one.
---
It's like 200 gp per time
---
For it to be worth it, you'd have to grow 2500 trees in that patch.
---
I think that's a bit excessive.
---
Maybe 500k for all patches
---
Autoclicked 85 range and mage on my baby pure. : ^ )
---
Or pvm that we don't have access to yet.  
---
Hell, it's nice to just practice Zulrah quickly without spending 200k on teleports.
---
Omelette, but yes that's correct :)
---
When is the Hydra Head coming? 
---
Thanks, thought he sounded familiar. I didn’t watch many runescape videos growing up.
---
Why do you need it just click one more time 
---
Why are you killing Abby demons on an unrestricted world
---
I mean, the title is false with two strength. But ok
---
So true rofl. I swear the most toxic people i run into are around the 85-100cb level range. I never really run into conflict with anyone with 115+. Anecdotal for sure. But my experience. 
---
Was trying to get 85 slayer and wanted to see how good the loot was, seems pretty good...
---
The dream goes on 
---
All the people killing Hydra, myself included, want this helmet lol. It's a huge achievement. We're not asking for wings on our back or some shit, my guy. 
---
# RING-A-DING-DING BABY
---
The fool
---
The exist for mobile. They're greatly helpful to pc but so would shift click being all / your x option.
---
Lmao What?
---
Probably was until he got PK'd because Sandwich Lady got in the way
---
Is there any reason the defence requirement wasn't extended to Blessed God Coifs and Bracers? Just chaps?
---
So how is attack/strength gonna work? 1-99 attack seems like it would take ages, is it be faster to do strength first with barb fishing? Maybe pest control?  
---
no
---
Just a heads up: Fiancé is a man and fiancée is a woman.
---
100% this. I just arrived at the point where I am starting to want to learn how to fight Zulrah because I need to kill him for the Hard diary, but I'm scared shitless about dying to him and wasting my time. 
---
This is a breath of fresh air because now I can set up my gear and get practice in before actually risking my setup and losing valuable inventory!
---
It’s not so much about the content as it’s about the presentation. A comedian can tell the same joke as you and I and it would be funnier. The video edits and contagious enthusiasm of settled is what makes him so entertaining to watch. At the end of the day, rs is just clicking and it’s just a matter of doing the least amount of clicks possible for the maximum reward.
---
/u/tanzoo &amp; /u/virtoso (not sure if these are their actual sub names if not someone should link them.

Well considering you worded your header “I had to do it to em” implies you are crashing. (To me at least) when you post a picture with no details you can count on the human brain creating its own backstory to fill the gaps. By what I saw and how you’ve worded it, not to mention the fact that you’re geared and headed back seems to me like you’re happy with the fact you got your pet and are going to continue to try your luck and take another drop. 
---
I may be wrong, and if so I do in fact apologize. Sincerely and congratulations for real. But if you were/are crashing. Straight up fuck you. 
---
I always tell people to go for Quest Point Cape. There is so much important content locked behind quests (teleports, items, ect.). If you do that your skills will also be rounded out to mid-game levels due to stat requirements.
---
How the fuck is this not removed yet? 
---
Aww well fuck
---
thank you!
---
I have over 2.3k vorkath kc, and everytime I take a break from raids to go farm a couple vork kills, I almost inevitably fuck up woox walking and die. 
---
Also I have 0 pets on my account despite well over 110m xp. 
---
Add dark wizards too for the noobs. Call it superenergy'pot bridge.
---
it's wierd but it's pretty much exactly the account I left when eoc was introduced. I just started grinding slayer, made a couple of mill, got 77 slayer started absolutely grinding brutal black dragon, got 70 prayer, started doing herbruns. meanwhile range, attack, str, def got 85 went bandos, got tassets from a minion, then 10 kills later got tassets from bandos, got the rest of the full armour + a hilt in the next 100 kills, started doing arma, got agility lv 70 and that's pretty much where i am now, also did a shit ton of quests along the way. i think i got very lucky but it was a big grind 
---
He didn't just show his wealth.  He showed his bank pin.  He showed his main accounts login username which happens to be an email with his full name in it, therefore allowing people to research him and find more info to use to recover his account.  I am sure he leaked other info if I were to watch through previous broadcasts.  
---
elf quest is part of a different poll so obviously that's not going to make it, but changing the xp of certain bones doesn't seem like its a complex update.
---
I can relate to that Hunter hate
---
Need to go until 13,034,431 so only another 13,034,066 days to go (35,709 years) you gonna need to find someone to pass this onto.
---
NO NOT THIS FRICKIN SHIT AGAIN
---
I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
---
This should be an integrity change.
---
Not knowing the rules doesn't mean you shouldn't be punished for breaking them
---
lmao well that makes sense, the reason i have this picture right next to gwd is because my first screenshot was at GE, but it didn't include my kc, as i was running back to my buddies who were unhappy because we were still dry for an item with 3 sapphires and a ruby drop, now a pet drop, to finish the trip, i realized "oh my screenshot doesn't even include my kc", so i quickly took another one outside the dungeon, I'll see if I can pm you the original screenshot
---
It probably isn't. And it clearly isn't a priority over the other polled changes.
---
Weeb leave the house. Now. Youre not welcomed. 
---
Yeah it sure is!
---
how is this relevant
---
When Autumn Elegey did it, he was ostracized by the community, i really don't understand what's different about Settled. 
---
Why that exact number?
---
Case sensitive passwords are just not needed. You can’t brute force an RS account and there’s plenty of combinations without case sensitive.
---
Heard you cant do inferno on the beta worlds
---
So does this mean I can bring my 105 cb to raids 1? It's been the dream since I started playing osrs 
---
You didn’t honestly think “braugjt” was the correct spelling, did you?
---
They need to create an S rank HCIM where you play as Shaggy and there's a hunger bar that you have to keep up on. Food only heals for 1/8 of total health gained. ZOINKS
---
I remember soon after Vorkath release a Jmod (I think it was Aiyza) says that it was intentional and it allows better players to get faster kills
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
Yea dumbest thing ever, why do they add useless shit just to keep the game from goin “easy” scape even though u had to grind hours for the damn agility level. Treating this game like everyone has hours everyday to play. Seems more like a job if u think about it. I love the game but damn they need to remember it’s supposed to be fun and rewarding.
---
Do you even OSRS bro? That's total xp for 99. God damn!
---
It's a t75 item though, shouldn't it clearly be the best in slot?
---
I suspect that a massive amount of bots are run by Jagex so they can get in on that sweet rwt money. Why wouldnt they?
---
Roses are red,
---
Dragon med helms are too,
---
I love youtube videos,
---
Damn, unregistered hypercam 2.
---
You should prioritize purchasing upper-level access before anything else. The speed increase alone makes getting the mining outfit not hard at all.
---
Not saying those who don’t know the rules shouldn’t be punished. I was saying punish those blatantly break the rules before we punish those who do so unknowingly
---
Yeah happened to me.  Was streaming a clan event so some of the clan members that didn't make it could watch and someone came in asking questions.  I looked at who they were following and all the people they followed were 1 viewer streamers and were getting asked the same exact questions.
---
What your saying is kind of true but doesn’t apply to this situation as not only did he show he had wealth but people are saying on a LIVESTREAM he leaked his bank pin, login and pass length and other important things. So you can take your obnoxious clap emotes elsewhere
---
the pin leak is why they might have bothered. You cannot dismiss that. Its extremely relevant to the situation.
---
Pins are an extremely safe way to protect your bank if you aren't leaking them on stream. his bank is not guaranteed if they get a recovery and he doesn't leak his pin. so a hacker might not be motivated at all to target him, they only get one chance. why not wait until you know hes not going to be on for a few days to wait out the cancel?
---
If you only want one kill for the diary and have 75+ mage then just do the mage only method with a trident. Terribly inefficient kills but its easy to get one kill.
---
I thought the total xp was 23 x 200m :)
---
I've never pked in my life (always was the one getting jumped for my spade) until an hour ago when I killed my first dude on the new world. I felt so good even though he never changed prayers. 
---
Why do people even have cballs alts in 2019, it takes like 30 hours for those alts to break even on the bond
---

Kebbit falconry itself was awesome, it's how I upped my Hunting mostly before I found out about the MM2 monkeys. Fishing falconry is kinda... Lacking. It's a fun semi-minigame but there isn't much insentive to actually do it. 
---
Just wait for the hutsplat to disappear, it's really not that bad
---
Except there are bot scripts that will bruteforce a PIN in like an hour
---
I was thinking about getting coal bag first so I can go to Blast Furnace and turn my membership trial into a bond... I guess 4 days is long enough to get another 100 gold nuggets
---
Your edit reminded me of when goldmember refers to the piece of skin he just pulled off of his neck a “keeper”
---
Why is ignorance of the rules an excuse? Report them both, they are equally guilty.
---
It was a shitshow of amount of people.
---
He was dropping, dont know if he dropped every thing, but it was impossible to get into a world, the world would instantly fill up in a second after he announced the next world..
---
Get quests and graceful out of the way 
---
Lmao getting triggered because you didnt get a reference
---
YEW
---
it showed +4 when the poll went live
---
You are correct, my bad. Delay wasn't mentioned until further on.
---
You took a picture of a YouTube video that is your account? Interesting
---
90% of the bots get banned by the system, those that don't get banned by the system because people report them
---
This can be solved if they limit the stack amount like the coin pouches from pickpocketing Ardougne knights.
---
Why was one of the birdhouses changed?
---
/u/JagexGambit also curious, new twitch prime promo??
---
Argument is not to let those who don’t know the rules go unpunished. It’s to punish those blatantly breaking the rules first
---
I was not saying that he had a degree in gender politics or whatever. I was referring to the typical news outlets that make everything seem like women are oppressed in some form or fashion. They twist events constantly to seem like there was some sort of oppression going on. Just sick of the propaganda 
---
I wish it was higher fishing exp, with hunter being minimal.
---
*tipping intensifies*
---
Lol it's not a YouTube video it's on my laptop
---
in your dreams.
---
pin exploits like that were fixed long ago. I'd personally pay you 500 USD bitcoin if you find me a working one in 2019 with tested proof and PM me it. highly interested.
---
Having one skill high level while the rest are 1 or some other low number
---
You wouldn't be wrong and damn who's dicks getting sucked to down vote me for this?
---
Half Venezuelan half Gielinorian?
---
runecrafting bad
---
Yeah I just walk in and do whatever is thrown at me. It's good to learn all of the rotations anyway. The airplane method is surprisingly useful!
---
Duplicates are possible or is the wiki wrong? Also you arent guaranteed the zombie bridge encounter. Isn't it one of four or five possible trek encounters?
---
This. The max str bonus just keeps getting higher and higher.
---
On mobile, in the top right corner there are 3 vertical dots. You can click that, then click "hide post" to hide the post to keep browsing!
---
thanks il try that
---
You are forgetting that using the serp helm costs 250K GP per hour, that's 6 neitiznot helms per fucking hour to just use it.
---
Fun fact: RS passwords aren't case sensitive 
---
right click the report button in-game to report bugs
---
ruined account, time to start over
---
lol not a chance it will pass then. 
---
It was a video recording, then I went back to take a screenshot lol
---
Autoclick will repair that too, it's just a left click. 
---
I was going for the set but once I started thinking of the hassle that auto weed would take...
---
Think of it.
---
If you rake every patch in osrs, it will NEVER grow back.
---
Best unlock I ever got.
---
That quest will make for a good episode. But then he is just doing Temple trekking and construction for a good couple months.
---
The good news is he can throw some barrows content in there if he wants to as it is going to take him a long time per trip
---
Because the guy in the OP is not Primitive Technology, it's Andy from HTME..

Any implementation is fine from what’s currently being used!
---
He's saying the boss variant, Cerberus, is very profitable. Not hellhounds themselves.
---
Hey I was on the opposite side of this, was training a noob and he got the same pet and I helped him insure it.
---
Speedrunning my barrow gloves
---
His password is Hunter2, but his alt's password was Hunter3
---
Mmm, sure, whatever you say.   
---
The abyss? Are you sure you don't mean Zeah runecrafting? The abyss is not afk at all. 
---
Wow. I'm an idiot, didn't think that it's a left click
---
But that is some ridiculous amount of cballs to train range
---
Max str bonuses just keep getting higher and higher each update... Yet no defensive armors to go along with it. Should really consider justiciars effect being put into PvP... it requires 3 pieces
---
Yes, but that doesn’t solve the problem
---
he can just do contracts for STR with a cannon etc, its like 100k+ xp/h if done efficiently. After 99 str 99 attack will be a breeze, and then 99 def too.
---
Lol, seriously? I have played this game for 10 years without noticing it!
---
People like you made the game better for me when I started. I was so confused by the pet too. Didn't know why the random event wouldn't let me do anything. 
---
I always went with black (t), the gold trim just doesn't look that good with the green robin, tunic, and rangers boots imo. (t) kept it more subtle and matched the Accumulator more 
---
I don't get it. Some days I wooxwalk every kill perfectly, maybe take one fireball of damage all day. Other days I die 5x in a row trying and give up 
---
Like right now I'm doing magics at WC guild.  This level 3 has 1 in everything except fishing which is 10 farming at 11 and WC at 84. Seems like a bot maybe lol.
---
RS passwords aren't case sensitive either, so once you know the password length the number of possible combinations is already about 40% less. 
---
Shame
---
Can I take a part? Plox
---
Vorkath heads currently can be used in place of Ensouled Dragon Heads, which give 1,560xp. It seems a little weak to have it give less than a third of the experience when offered on the dark altar.
---
So can a wind chill be more intense? Because i've experienced-25 with wind chill and it is much colder than regular -25, but i wouldn't say it chilled me to the bone (though where im from we are more used to the cold than most.
---
Adding something like this would be an "event" of sorts, people would hear about shit going down at the agility course and go there themselves to pk/anti-pk etc creating chaos and activity for all, obviously if people are looking at it through the anti-fun efficiency solo ironman lens it's gonna sound like a terrible idea.
---
People misunderstand the idea behind adding content to the wilderness, it's not to bait people to a location so pkers can kill "defenceless" players, it's to spark activity and hopefully a long term pking hot spot.
---
Rip I died to vorkath probably 30 times when I first tried him
---
This was my first full trip attempt. I did 23 kills. I’m maxed with a Twisted Bow and dragon arrows so that helps. I also got a lot of supply drops lol. Still 5x easier on desktop
---
That’s exactly what the osrs population doesn’t want lol. Catering to new players will ruin the game. 
---
What would this unlock for Verf though?
---
can confirm
---
Pepega
---
Weight is approx 73
---
That's even more reason why it should be useful and better than nezzy helm.
---
Auto weed. That is damn useful
---
Haha, funny because now I'm deaf.
---
Pros: they don't fall out.
---
I already know what I'm voting no to B)
---
yup tried this
---
It's sweet 
---
He's already sat through 99 agility and 99 mining, I can't imagine RC being much worse. 
---
Are you kidding, this is hilarious 
---
Dude he trolled me yesterday too when i was setting my iron up for todt lmao
---
Pretty much any online system can be breached with social engineering.
---
Nah it would still be too slow compared to rope/crabs
---
Oooooo.... Cuz he would have more hp to survive the chemo hit splats. 
---
somebody s having fun in the unrestricted worlds
---
Yeah I mean abyss. It's really easy to afk, I'm really glad I grinded rc up to the point I could use it.
---
Ugh. I've been taking it easy on my Hydra task hoping it would come out today. I guess I'll just have to hope I get one when it comes out. 
---
I've done Birbhouses from 81-[currently]94 hunter exclusively, and it's the only Hunter I can tolerate as it's sort of a herb run thing.
---
It doesn't. I'm using an online zulrah helper to learn the rotations. And also using a Runelite plugin to mark some tiles. 
---
👏👏👏
---
my word that's a lot of gp brother
---
This wouldn't be a poll. If they polled it the polls would not be hidden, and the threshold would not be lowered
---
This would have to be a QoL changed. I'm asking if it is one the community would accept or would it be worse then the system that's currently in place
---
Yeah it can vary afaik
---
If the wiki says that duplicates are possible then it is wrong. Are you using the new wiki? 
---
And no you aren't guaranteed it, but the method is to just do the easy route with an easy npc and to instantly leave if you don't get the zombie encounter. It took me 20-30 minutes a few weeks ago, no duplicates. 
---
Because why would you talk about the community on a post that had nothing to do with the community in general. I'm just saying you're retarded for doing that.
---
Lol but most pking is killing lower level players, and people that mostly - Don't want a fight.
---
Just got into this series, and I'm hooked. It's hilarious in the beginning, but soooooo entertaining. 
---
I think the logic is dark altar = prayer, along with the ensouled heads giving prayer xp. 
---
Also, most slayer heads can be obtained while not on task. It sort of makes sense that they don't want players to obtain slayer xp while not on task.
---
&gt;Most cases of recovery don't even use your password as a recovery point. They get the information they need through e-stalking and then Jagex just gives them access to your account.
---
What people don't realize is that this can happen in any game, if a person can get a bunch of your personal information they recover almost any online account.
---
The reason that it's so impactful on Runescape is because your account might have literally tens of thousands of dollars worth of easily sell-able gold. 
---
Jagex's security is industry standard, but there's no avoiding the unfortunate situation where someone leaks (or gets doxxed) for a bunch of personal information. 
---
I feel like being in the world for 5 minutes is enough of a restriction as that would take more time than banking almost anywhere. Support though, its ass to loot kills on PvP worlds.
---
Sounds like RS3 is the game for you
---
Fishing trawler doesn't take remotely as long as farmer.. I got trawler set at about 1 hour 30, i've done 3 hours of tithe and it IS FUCKING SHIT
---
Nerf
---
23 kills?! I'm still on my first task and manage about 5 kills a trip =\\ I have welfare gear and poor mans Rigour sadly. One day I'll be able to afford nice stuff haha.
---
Similar stats and much much cheaper.
---
That's the direction of the game, buddy. Either hop aboard the buff gear nerf enemies train or stop giving them $11/mo.
---
If you're on mobile smithing steel bars at pre-60 with no coal bag I could see 100k an hour. But you should be making double that with steel and triple+ with mith.

---
yeah but remember abyssal demons r locked behind 85 slayer only, where as vorkath is locked behind a ton of quests and numerous other high lvls, so realistically abby head is more common cause its easier to obtain
---
yep, it would make perfect sense as long as there's no way to cheese the mechanics
---
It depends how they are attacking you. I stay pray against Magic when being Ice Barraged because I don't want to be hit for 30+ on top of being frozen. So even if the Entangle doesn't have its damage reduced, the Fire Surge still would.
---
Sounds like an adequate punishment for fucking up the one-at-a-time rule
---
Then when he's done he can level up defense using ranged without worrying about running out of ammo
---
Actually pretty difficult if we're using Jagex as the model.
---
in 2 instances yes spider outlay is a finger and those lil spiders so u got it twice over unlooky m8
---
yeah i immidiately logged in on the official runescape website and checked my accounts status, it said i was clean and did nothing wrong (i did nothing wrong also ;)) after i calmed down a bit and took a closer look, i saw more emails like that and figure out that it was a fishing link, don't know how they got my email... scary, i've already changed my password just to be safe.

I just did my first Cerberus task. It took just under 5 hours and I am trying to figure out how to increase my kills per hour. I think I averaged about 27 per hour. 
---
 I was trying to keep my prayer as close to 31 as possible for the ghosts but it seemed like the timing was just off on every kill after the first. I was pretty consistently having to pot at 25-30 prayer right as the ghosts were about to attack. Maybe its just confirmation bias, but does having higher than 70 prayer make a noticeable difference in kills per trip?
---
99 def would be super quick with chins 
---
(Barrage too, but DT has a bunch of skill requirements, no idea of it's doable without "ruining" the account)
---
Game is brutal.
---
Wait months and hope it bounces back or say rip to your profits
---
BIS for where, exactly? +2 Strength is in no way make-or-break for any content in the game, while Justiciar offers far superior survivability 99% of the time. This buffed Serp helm will still only be used to poison a purple spider.

They mentioned in the blog that inferno would be  closed in tourney worlds
---
See here's the thing though, most of the people voting on polls are salty PvMers that insta-vote down anything pvp related. I would love for this to pass because #HighFashion on my initiate pure is one of my favorite things to do, but I don't think it will pass. &lt;/3
---
Just search zulrah mage only on youtube. I'd post it but im at work.
---
With 99 Construction you should be able to teach your people on Miscellania how to operate machinery and cut down all the woods. Sell it back to the elves. Profit.
---
That would be crazy OP with the defences it has + negate of venom onto the user of the helm + the 3 str bonus.
---
This on the unrestricted worlds? Can't watch right now 
---
Not everyone likes to rush useless 99's mate
---
If you can stick with it to get popular, streaming is pretty good 
---
It costs money to learn pvp, but it's possible to make a lot through pvp. This lowers some of the cost of entry where you die every fight as you can regear for free, but once people learn they might take that skill into the main game and do pvp there.
---
The problem with that is you have to do barb fishing to like 99
---
Great if you were going to max fishing, but...
---
Thanks, I've been reporting them and doing this for a few weeks. Glad to have more people know about this. 
---
bro you literally type trumpet kid into google and it pops up..
---
Why the fuck is that sexist
---
lol imagine being mad about a pride event
---
Yeah. I stay off YouTube because of what it’s turned into these past few years
---
Are you sure?
---
He would need to get like 50m fishing xp
---
But how many instances is it used for just melee? If it’s just a 0 range and mage bonus it would actually make it worth again to use. Especially at the cost of nearly 150gp every single time you get hit (whether it be a 0 or not), it’s really not worth the +2 str. In the end, it’s still a pretty crappy unique 
---
Sure, let's talk about it. The map is showing temperature ranges. For example, you can describe a temp range from 50 to 59 degrees as "in the 50s". You can describe a temp range from -10 to -19 as "in the -10s". How do you describe a temperature range between 0 and -9 degrees (or hell, even 0 to 9)?
---
It will, but you’re not factoring in scoutingtime. Most people don’t use alts for prescouts and would rather waste a minute more at ice demon than scouting.
---
One was polled, one was implemented without a poll.
---
If the first one was polled, surely this should have been as well.
---
I'm not okay with things being implemented without a poll if the entire basis of Old School Runescape is that everything is polled. It would have passed with like 85% yes, but still should have been polled.
---
It's a slippery slope and not about this update, but potential future ones.
---
Where does it stop? Hammers near every anvil? Rock hammer near gargoyles? Mirror shield near basilisks? Anti dragon shield inside KBD lair and metal dragons?
---
This isn't hyperbole and is entirely possibly unless things are polled. It's not difficult and there have been other ridiculous things that people are like "why is that being polled lol" - this is why. Because if everything is polled, no one's specific agenda or bias can enter the game without 75% of us agreeing to it. This goes around the entire poll and just implements it anyway.
---
This might give a max hit on olm melee hand with lance. I'll have to check though.
---
If I'm totally honest, I don't like this.
---
Now we're creating all kinds of arbitrary rules to mechanics, that will make them behave differently depending on your location. 
---
Just imagine you're used to the regular PvM mechanics. At some point you decide to start PvPing. Now you're in a larger disadvantage because you're unaware of all these changes, than you normally would be without them. The more of these rules they add, the more difficult it will become to learn them. (Is there even a list somewhere with them?)
---
Now let me be clear, I do want autocast and I understand the reasoning behind wanting to exclude PvP.
---
Can we get some ironman to move to Minnesota, thanks.
---
I did MLM straight from 30 and by the time I got 72 I had coal bag, full prospector, gem bag, and enough left to buy upper level. 
---
Not really, it's just odd shit until Tithe Farm unlock and that probably until 99 tbh
---
Yes but if it unlocks him nothing, why does it matter? His goal is inferno so i don't know what it would unlock. I doubt he could ever build pools to help
---
Fix this tho, changing the levels should unequip all equipment you can't wear. Or at least just unequip everything
---
Yeah but I started later :(. Iron is wayyyyy faster for early levels
---

Ge tracker was previously linked to a stint with hacking accounts. Entering your account details anywhere but on the official website is asking for security breaches.

UNPOLLED REEEEEEEEEE
---
I upvoted this post and you should too.
---
/s. Or is it?
---
Which is also why Serp is no longer really useful anywhere in PVP baring niche exceptions. Where will this +2 change make any impact to the Serp Helm's usage? All it does it make the Serp Helm even stronger in PVP where it was already used plenty.
---
Awesome again man! Been waiting on this. 
---
Sher are locky...
---
While we're at it, also add this functionality to the price checker. 
---
That's like not studying for a test and then complaining the teacher didn't pass you.  Jagex can only do so much, but if you're going to leak your own info, that's 100% on you.
---
Brother I uh. Well.... you... err... yea
---
Yea that one seems weird. Ensouled dragon heads gives 3x more prayer xp than what this suggestion. If you have 93 Magic there is no reason to do it this way.
---
Fair enough
---
Personally it's not worth it, I just do 3-4 kills max and then bank banking takes about a minute so its not like you're losing out on millions by missing half a kill.
---
Rip tbow

in dungneering we had skill pots too mmm maybe bring that back?

life just sucks, ive lost it all.

Alch it first and then we will upvote it

No fucking way lmao. How can he forget to turn off his stream?! 
---
CONGRATULATIONS!
---
Always recommend doing as many quests early on as possible, as the exp rewards they give can really get you through those slower lower levels. I’d also train as much of your combat skills through doing slayer tasks as possible, as later on, slayer can make you easy money. Agility is also good to start early on as you run almost everywhere. And just like any other game, osrs has it’s toxic members, but for the most part the community is pretty awesome.

Scared shitless about wasting 10 minutes? Jesus

That’s garbage suggestion, easily brute force np to rookie hacker. Are you that stupid?

What do you mean, bugfix? I spent like 5 years throwing stuff down that sink to clog it and now they do this. Thanks jamflex.
---
I will give your opinion the consideration it deserves. 
---
Gz
---
The Serp Helm is meant to be the Venom Melee Item. Giving it back its BiS Strength would make it a good Melee Item again instead of just a Hybrid Venom Helm. You'd use Serp anywhere you want BiS Strenght off-task, which is a good amount of places. Pretty much anyplace you use Neit, it would be better to use Serp instead.
---
The literal god 
---
Nah I'm pretty sure it ends up being roughly scythe &gt; rapier &gt; tent &gt; lance
---
Bludgeon probably still pretty trash unfortunately.
---
No this is the brand new update jagex put in, no need to train stats anymore
---
The logic is the same with police. Do they go after drug dealers or drug users? Dealers, because going after users does nothing to stop the problem. My original comment just made the point that we shouldn’t be reporting the person gambling with the bot, because it doesn’t solve the problem, there are still bots, and there are and always will be gamblers. We should be reporting the bots themselves. But everyone in this thread seems to be against gambling in general and just wants to get the regular gamblers, not the people providing the gambling service. Vigilante justice over actual process driven methodologies with proven success

But MuH PowErCReeP
---
Well every other shortcut is tied to Agility is it not?
---
&gt;You don’t take that much damage that it’s required kinda pointless in my opinion.
---
It's still nice to have a path with no risk of upsetting your inventory, depending on how finely tuned your setup is.
---
I don’t really have a problem with any of the questions, but in what world are some of these changes “quality of life”? I’m really not a fan of how every change that isn’t new content is being dubbed QoL.
---
When will you be implementing the rest of the stuff polled for Kebos?
---
Terrible idea lmao 
---
There's no winning with anything. Look at all these fucking crybabies in the comment section, crying about how a chisel spawn wasn't polled. Pathetic.

Melee for vorkath is BIS strength gear iirc rather than void. Yeah helm switch is nice at raids 1, especially if you don't have sang staff yet. Even then you could probably still take the three hats anyway.

Runecrafting is a slow skill!

This is why people should use a password manager and treat secret questions like a second password.

Are you questioning why you can't use mouse keys (which you can) or if you're allowed to use mouse keys? I can read but you didn't ask a question.

yes agility bad slayer good upvote!

Why is it terrible?

People would have to sacrifice Salve (ei) to use it and protect only 2 items instead of 4.

Yes it has. Tirannwn quiver means you can ignore most of the traps.

As much as I hate people who unnecessarily waste y'all's time, I really don't think there's anything better than the good old jmod smackdown

---
Imbued heart brings these a lot closer together and being able to cast vengeance while still using trident makes trident much better for Zulrah.
---
Wew it's insane that you think any of that is true (it actually objectively is not). Thieving for example is over 200k/hr at higher levels, while max agility rates sit at 1/3rd of that. Not to mention thieving is somewhat exciting compared to literally running in circles for agility. Is thieving too RS3 for you?
---
You make 600k-800k/hr off of runes with the hard dairy done doing efficient runs. If you do 9 kills/hr (which isn't difficult) you'll be looking at a unique every 2 hours given the drop rate is 1/17.4. The average barrows drop is worth 780k/2 hours = 390k/hr from uniques.
---
Barrows is looking at an easy 990k-1190k/hr and could be much higher if done better. 
---
Look, your personal tests don't mean anything when looking at the raw numbers. What you think about barrows doesn't mean it shouldn't be on this list or that other people shouldn't do it. If you hate barrows fine. I don't care, its still a good way to make money for lower levels.
---
Honestly it's like Thanos propaganda. He's trying to maintain the skill balance by making sure some people do Runecrafting.

Considering it comes from a boss that only uses range and magic, I support.

lol blizzard is so far up their own ass. classic will not be like osrs at all

Similar to heads, can extra boss jar drops be brought to the museum for xp in hunter and slayer similar to the quiz. (After the quiz the historian tasks you with filling his empty display)

Why? It would be the same as the normal game would it not?

why do so many ppl complain about blowpipe? We fucking literally have a Twisted Bow thats stronger than BP in many situations and is almost free to use. BP at least costs 550k+ per hour to use.
---
I've hunted down hundreds of herbiboars to get fossils and turn them into slayer xp. From hunting herbiboars, you gain herblore xp and hunter xp. Fossils are "rare" drops that you basically use to get xp lamps. If I can currently trade in fossils for slayer xp, when fossils and herbiboar have absolutely nothing to do with slayer, then why cant I trade in my useless stacks of heads for 500 slay xp each, just to be able to get rid of them while making use of them somehow?
---
I think that was the 1 pet at a time guy
---
Definitely won’t happen. I think they should buff it somehow, but I don’t think this is how.
---
People need to realize the autocast question has no upside in pvp, autocasting always takes 1 tick longer
---
You’re misuse of grammar makes your statement confusing AF. 
---
Ah. Well, I'd disagree. Players would be willing to use to Serp Helm at end game PvM if it were better than the Neit; the only reason it isn't used now is because the Neit is better. It is just like how the Tent Whip is used in PvM; it isn't used commonly but it is used at bosses were you want the extra stats.
---
Tbh I liked those kinds of quests in WoW too.
---
What i didn't enjoy were the quests with lots of talking, or fetch quests where i had to go pick up an item from an NPC and bring it back or gather up a bunch of some item laying on the ground sparkling. Those were boring.
---
sharks all the way to 99? I was planning to switch to angler fish at 90.

That would technically make you an incel for posting this
---
Weird way of admitting ur an incel but alright 
---
Do you know if they're spread/close together? I'm at work now, I might just go there and check when i get home. I couldn't find any good maps of the spawns anywhere online. It would be cool if they are all in the center area fighting other monsters, then you could do the whole task without really taking damage. Maybe tap a few mages while you're there for dboots?

This is HUGE for my hardcore ultimate Sinclair mansion only Ironman

I think **Poll Question #10** would primarily be more beneficial in PvP; especially if we want to see more solo magic builds. I would love to see this as a Pker!
---
The Poll Question
---
*" Should autocast options be remembered when equipping a magical weapon? Each autocast configuration layout will be remembered seperately. Magical weapons which share the same layout will share the spell remembered. For example, the Staff of Light and Staff of the Dead share the same autocast configuration layout and would, in turn, share which spell is remembered. This would only be for non-PvP areas.* 
---
***PK-ers:*** *if you want this change to also affect PvP, please let us know in your feedback to this poll blog and we can consider it.*  *"*

Yeah I did tuna to 82 then monk fish to 89 then sharks the rest of the way

Mma and OSRS are my two biggest hobbies. Very excited for Cain's return.

One requires 92 magic and one has no requirement, seems reasonable

I think length of the password is also limited or maybe it isn't but doesn't show the password

I absolutely love **Poll Question #8 !!!** this will make PvM content so much more enjoyable for me personally :'D

The Poll Question:

" *Should Weapon categories remember the previous attack style being used when equipped? For example, if a player used any sword previously with the "Defensive" attack style, any other sword will continue to be used with the Defensive style when equipped.* "
---
They've said it countless times, it's only a minor increase in security.
---
I like how there are two zulrah shrines
---
You stay off YouTube because of r/2007scape Settled memes? 
---
he said after strength and attack.
---
at 80 I had less than 1% burn rate on sharks with cooking gauntlets at hoseidus kitchen. But at 85 I am burning anglers like crazy.
---
We did it reddit, poll question #8! "Should Weapon categories remember the previous attack style being used when equipped? For example, if a player used any sword previously with the "Defensive" attack style, any other sword will continue to be used with the Defensive style when equipped."

Id say a good amount of them dont go killing people who have nothing out of joy or griefing... rather 9 times out of 10 they might get nothing, BUT you know there's definitely that 1/10 that actually did bring a ton of teleports or some risk so now they just attack everyone for that chance

From my experience, TBs are usually done in a team with someone else to Mage you on Ancients. I don't recall the TBers using much offensive magic; I feel like they tend to have a Ranged switch.
---
Have the wiki page always open and be reading anything and everything you do. Knowledge is power in this game.

Yeah but the 'accomplishment' was meaningless from the beginning. And if for whatever arbitrary reason you still somehow ascribe value to grinding 70-99 construction by spending billions, you could just not participate in the dxp week

Abyssal tentacle is a poison weapon not venom
---
thanks for making this quality content &lt;3
---
It is QoL in this case because right now the helm is essentially useless. Who the fuck wants to buy a degradable, expensive item when the next step down is similar (arguably better) stats and also a free quest reward.
---
Personally, I would rather see them add a dark beast boss with the new elf quest, instead of just adding more skilling/alch items to another slayer monster.
---
No &gt;:(
---
Slayer.
---
You will likely get 99 str while training slayer even if you do nothing but slay.
---
\&gt; but gmaul rushers/pures would have to either lvl up or deal with it.   
---
no one would die in at lower combats anymore, actively killing the only active bracket in BH.  
---
gmaul as it is right now is essential for the survival of lower brackets in PvP.
---
I'll take the bait.

You can only use F1-12 and ESC to switch between invy/equipment tab/prayer tab/spellbook tab and spec? -&gt;

Fps in this game is almost entirely based on your screen resolution, if you maximize the screen size of rs to 1080 youre probably going to get 30fps, as you start lowering the size of the client you will see it decrease.

And yet it’s still unfair to all the people who aren’t getting their unsired tracked that they can personally justify a reason for having it tracked. For instance, ironmen should have everything tracked by your logic. They obviously couldn’t have gotten the items anywhere else, right. So by your logic it should be tracked. It’s not. But guess what, you don’t see them here throwing a hissy fit over something that doesn’t matter. Start over. If you want unsired track go kill sire. It’s that easy.

holy fuck this subreddit really has the dumbest ppl doesnt it LOL

Spade spawn effecting gp per hr? Lmao

i dont have rigour and 6+ kill trips are the norm. you are praying prot range right?
---
Eh. I’d say it’s steel needed for solo. I can speak on team raids, but I’d imagine 1 person having it will be good. It’s not the craziest nerf to Tek. It’s been reducing my solo Tek kills by about 1-1.5 mins.
---
Do DS2, you filthy redhat.
---
Yeah man I’m really sorry to hear that that happened I would say if you do start playing again just make sure you get a bank pin before you put any real amount of money or get items in to it.  Because even if they’re able to get into your account as long as you have a bank pin that they should not be able to get into your bank.
---
Here is a tree run I did  from start to finish including banking :)
---
https://youtu.be/zt1PqHhhf2o
---
Lmao true, but from that perspective you have to consider the fact that membership was only $5 and per account back then, added to the necessity of adjusting to inflation. 200k GP in runescape 10 years ago was far more spending power than it is now. There was less GP in the economy/more players in the game. Not certain of the exact figures but I still can see it

I have a feeling that /u/kuzaemon is the kind of person who could forget their sunglasses, leave them unattended in a public space for an hour before remembering, and come back **outraged** at the inhumanity of those *dirty thieves.*

In a perfect world, nobody would have to worry. Unattended items would be left alone, and accounts wouldn't be hacked when all the necessary data was leaked.
---
But this isn't a perfect world. Watch your shit. Be mindful of security and your possessions, and admit when your carelessness resulted in their loss. That doesn't mean you deserved it, or that it's your fault; just accept it as a wakeup call to be more careful next time.

this shit is why they're taking their time to rebuild WoW classic..

You do know most trees take a few hours to grow full right? Tithe would be more applicable in the scenario or all allotments/herb/bushes/etc. Since it is 1 skill at a time, that would be a lot of wasted time just doing 1 tree run a day.

Congrats! Cookinf was my first 99 too. Occaisonally youll get that guy thats like "ew cooking" but just ignore them. Youre 1/27ths closer to max ;)

I don't get paid for my "days off" like that. I would hate for my work to just shut down like that and fuck me out of a couple days pay I may or may not need that week.

It seriously reduces the number of permutations for a password though, making brute force exponentially easier.

This sub can get weird if you don't watch streamers

But I mean, is that actually a problem? If someone takes time to get to the raid and get an ice demon room just to make low-level wc better I don't really mind. Still would just hack other trees.
---
its a runelite option i believe

You mean you spend 1M and make 1.5M? Your wording was just unclear.

What in the actual fuck are the replies in this post. Y'all are genuinely stupid for chastizing a person's personal preference to play the game with mouse regardless if it's on the mobile platform. Like y'all are really this serious about this? A person is not supposed to be allowed to go buy a Microsoft surface ARC mouse, pull it out on the bus and use it on his lap to play the game on the way to school or work? Smfh, let people do as they please. I've been tweeting mod ash about this for months now and he keeps telling me that it may be implemented but it's not a 'super important feature' to add just yet,which is fine. But why the community is so toxic about mouse support on mobile for this game bewilders me beyond belief

No you're not, ever heard of EHP?

how about you have 200m in items in the storage because you died, and you dc on the run back and lose it all? There's the biggest reason it needed to be added right there imo.

Yeah but this makes zulrah pre trident actually doable for ironmen.

Inefficient sure but still pretty interesting.

Could it be because I have my attack option hidden

Waited a bit but nothing droped. Some other legit player got them hopefully.

Awkward when you accuse someone of getting found out but it was really just you getting your facts confused due to your misinterpretation of text.

I notice you're not replying anymore..

yeah, its really good. you hit 62s w/ firecape max strength on task vs 56 w/ whip and its like 4% more accurate

Yes. Should probably try changing that first..

Does the diary increase your odds of getting barrows items or does it just increase the runes?

It's a forum that is more focused on pking and clanning for mains and pures.

“More common”  as in more common than the others. But yes it should definitely beat least as much as ensouled dragon heads

The vorkath one is nice.

It's ice face is a bit buggy in my opinion. I've sometimes shot Ruby bolts at it after I kill the Undead scorpion, I'd be taking my 10% damage but I don't notice any hits Splats for vorkath

This is legit the funniest thing I've seen all week on Reddit.

americans are complaining about it
---
Yeah, sorry. Best way to find a method like that though is to find an obscureish processing method on the wiki and just find a variation on it. At least one is guaranteed to be decent.
---
Just another autist publicly displaying their autism. 
---
1. Blessed d hide so the same as back but with a small pray bonus
---
2. When they say ignoring prayer they mean the duration on the bind it’s self, made pay doesn’t make you splash more or less.
---
3. When SERP was nerfed originally they took Venom and str bonus down, bringing str bonus back will make is viable again, nezzy shouldn’t be BiS for melee 
---
Why would you affiliate yourself with the biggest scum on runescape known for flaming dead people and flaming religion. This guy will never off you as far as i can tell. He told me he has been Anti-Ragging for around 3 years, that's an awful long time imo. 
---
lol yeah right
---
That's still massive m8
---
Can you tell me how giving pures +1 prayer bonus is giving them "full fledged armour"?
---
Also why should a serp helm be worst than a 30k helm that you can get free from a quest? That makes no sense to me.  Serp is barely used and the only reason it is worth money is that it can be deconstructed for scales.

Id get 99 runecrafting for +1 str
---
Awesome, I'll also register on there thank you. 
---
Last night here too! Nice man!!! 
---
Another issue is that people will see a soloer and lookup their name. If they realize its an iron they will just crash half the time :)
---
Money making method
---
Agree. A solo instance would not hurt anyone and having to use alts to get around hop limit to find worlds is shit.
---
Nah I'm pretty cautious about that stuff.  No real/useful info given :)  it was the first thing that came to my mind as well when a random just walked up and started asking questions.

I've noticed that people don't really understand what a Quality of Life improvement is when the JMod thread on here fires up every so often. 
---
Some of the suggestions are HUGE. 
---
1) Learn to read. It clearly says vambraces and chaps. Making it require no defense (only 70 ranged). The same as black d'hide chaps and vambraces. The only difference being +1 prayer bonus on each party. +2 prayer is not "full fledged armour".
---
2) So you think it's fine with normal spellbook being utter shite in PVP bar teleblock, while 20s barrage freezes are aite..? GL getting barrage to splash without wearing dhide. (I am impartial on this one, I will skip the vote).
---
3) The only thing that does not make sense is nerfing serp helm to the ground. It should've kept the str bonus in the 1st place.
---
Have you been reading about song of the elves?
---
Because construction is a skill designed to be a money sink
---
Looking for Slayer XP only. Still soldiers or Guardians?
---
Then just freeze again after the freeze wore off and you would keep the same dps. The freeze duration decrease will not influence your dps as long as you can refreeze immediately.
---
unfortunate that the regular spellbook buffs probably wont pass because people see things pkers use to kill them being buffed as an automatic no vote. 
---
Thank you brother!
---
Can you start bursting before 70 magic? I'm at 68 at the moment and non of the normal training methods look appealing to me and I'd rather just use the lower burst spells, but not if it's insanely inefficient or something.
---
There’s a narrows road in my town too!
---
Bandos is the only boss where finding a world is a struggle, its really lame. you shouldnt need alts to get around hop limit just to find worlds

---
&gt; @WBG\_MAFIA Thanks for your thoughts there. You may have noticed one of your requests mentioned in the blog, in fact. Unfortunately the others are not feasible as the items have data stored on them, and thus cannot stack.
---
Yeah even other gwd bosses arent an issue. The ironman only corp cave was a great idea that i hope they can implement here as well.
---
I don't get it, I did 2 Rune dragon task, 1 steel dragon task, 2 iron dragon task and only mange to hit a 61 once out of all those task. I have max melee and Bis gear.  Did I do something wrong or is that just the worst rng ever. I ended up selling it and going back to Dhcb.
---
Seeing as how people do die I don't think instances will really hurt the item prices and they will almost exclusively be used by iron man or people soloing. It's a stupid packed boss since it is really easy and has high gp drops compared to say zammy.  
---
No mercy for splashers!!
---
yeah i dont think uim is for me
---
I swear I just bought a pair for 2k..
---
Thanks man! I appreciate it!
---
I disagree. Having an ironman only instance for Bandos would have very little effect on normal players or prices of items. And yes ironman choose to play a different way, but i think most can agree that its primarily for the fun of gathering things on our own/having to do bosses for their drops rather than just buy them. World hopping and hitting log in limits isnt an integral part of the game mode.
---
Wouldn’t really bother. You’d have to predictively clucked and you’d likely mess up the timing, regardless if you were clicking correctly
---
Items dropped from death don't show to other players unless you're on a pvp world 
---
Would be a pretty fun, strong account in pk with 99 str. However 99 pray kind of fucks it, but it would still be fun.
---
If it was me playing, i would get 99 str, then pk while getting 99 farming 
---
I think they should do what is best for the update. I'd rather see a well designed solo challenge than an okay solo and group challenge. Like Kieren said on the Q&amp;A, there is a lack of both solo and group content still, so I'm fine with this being just a solo one and getting other group content later.
---
Also, if we were to get a group update, I'd prefer it be more casual like Dungeoneering was than something challenging and endgame. Even if they don't make it Inferno difficulty or such, it is locked behind a Grandmaster Quest. So that alone kinda limits the group aspect.
---

honestly its probably because runescape theres just a lot of things to look up.  wow theres practically nothing to look up because its all streamlined garbage that you can pretty much just slap your hands on the keyboard and progress.  i tried wow again at the start and i maybe had to look up 2 things. ill look up 5-10 things in a long play session of OSRS.

so sick of seeing asmongold videos though. i cannot figure out how anyone finds the guy entertaining

---
21 and 19 is fine. 21 and 27 is fine.
---
21 and 17, however... not so fine. And it’s not a legal thing! It’s because 17 year olds are still in fuckin high school, whereas 21 year olds are already out the house for a couple years and drinking at bars. 
---
I didn’t claim people’s’ brains develop at 18. I claim that it’s nasty to make the line about who’s a pedophile an ambiguous one, because that justifies pedos who think it’s okay to fuck around with 13 year olds. The “argument” that says that “well she’s old enough to know what she wants” is really horrible, and it’s apologia for pedophiles. If you say unironically say “well 17 is fine she’s not too young” then you set a new line, where the next person says “well 16 is fine she’s not too young” etc. It’s always wrong.
---
Its funny because thats actually all you need to do
---
I think it may be individual Jmods running the bots, not the company as a whole. It's kind of likely considering how little play Jmods get at Jagex.
---
Try playing the game
---
No. People just generally kill these jads with a twisted bow and 99 ranged. 
---
Because plenty of them are low requirement, require barely any initial investment, and afkable, and some can make you 500k+ an hour 90% of the time which isn't exceptionally good, but for new members, low levels, or for people who want to make money when doing something else, it's pretty damn good.
---
Imagine bragging about crashing ironmen on Reddit
---
No but its 99 attack with 2 str
---
Yeah lol, 10 Vorkath kills and you get that 10k from the actual bones smh ...
---
99 def with 2 str 
---
Imagine caring about ironmen.

Would it still be op if, for example; your stack can only be the same as your current woodcutting level?

More like $111 with that gear he bought.

If you only started a month ago you can't have had that much stuff can you? Fair enough if you bought a load of bonds though I guess.

&gt;pedophile. 
---
An adult, usually male, who is sexually attracted to prepubescent children
---
you need to shut the fuck up lol.
---
I'm not saying its fine to fuck around with 13 year olds. I'm saying 17 is a grey area of an age and some people in that age are definitely mature enough to go for older guys. Most of the world has understood that, except america, and you.
---
I don’t read paragraphs from closet pedophiles dude just get help your nasty ass mf
---
They’re all pretty close to each other, minimal running to get to the next one after your has died

But then why would that be a secret. New players are a small niche, who would try to hide something like that. Some stuff on that money making page is low req, practically afk, and makes 500k or close to it

I mean you can't spawn in morytania so that precludes everyone. Some content has to be done outside to start the account

---
That's amazing. I'll give that a try. Unfortunately it's pretty difficult to export, but I should be able to work around that
---
"If you think about it and disagree with me you're immature" is probably the actual lack of maturity here.
---
Agreed. Now that school started again I’m trying to refrain from grinding as much 😂
---
It’s not bad I must say.  Coming from a guy who usuAlly just watches pk clips. 
---
Look I get it. You’re somewhere between 16-18, and you think you’re totally mature and your peers are totally not children!
---
You’re wrong. 17/18 year olds are children. They still live at home usually, and they haven’t started experience in the real world. They’re still teenagers, and from a developmental point of view, their brains are insanely different from a normal human brain (seriously look it up - there’s a greater difference in brain structure and activity between teenagers and adults than the difference between 9-10 year olds and adults. Your brain is the most different as a teenager).
---
Not to mention the cultural aspect, where the adult is convincing this young girl that she’s special (grooming) because the adult is choosing to be in a sexual relationship with the child. Usually just because she thinks she wants it doesn’t always mean she’s in the right mindset to do something like that. She’s clouded by the need to feel emotionally mature. It really does happen.
---
True. I'd hope it'd not be polled in the first place, but if they did for any reason. I did not mean to say they should poll it.
---
Standard has teleblock though.
---
just google it lol. spawn pk server or something. revision is 317
---
You can start with a proper screenshot, then quests until you complete rfd then train slayer and do monkey madness 2 and do more slayer so you can do dragon slayer 2 and do even more slayer and then raids and then slayer again, put some more slayer and raids. 
---
This game plan may take you awhile, good luck.

Log in on runescape website and under account management disable authenticator then reenable it

I’d rather just have the heads sitting there in my bank as keepsakes as opposed to getting like 30k prayer exp. weeeeeeak.
---
Why? It can be used as an ensouled head if you have the appropriate magic level.  Why should vorkath heads randomly bypass the requirement of casting the ensoul spell killing the dragon?
---
sorry, english is not my native language, that's why i asked if someone could explain it to me.
---
Except one takes hard work. You're talking about a chemical reaction you can get from food, nearly anything
---
its not better explained really, theres just absolutely no depth to any of it anymore because they systematically spent years removing any trace of it. i cant think of any meaningful choices in wow that you would even need to look up info or advice on. you cant really mess anything up because none of your choices really matter.
---
Why does Jagex punish Inferno cape buyers but not fire cape buyers? Aren't both of them personal pvm accomplishments? Why the double standard?
---
leave me alone
---
It appears I was incorrect before. Your comment was not well structured. This one however is incredibly well structured!
---
yeh. if she legal, fair game. 
---
Because they’re adding a reward to heads. By your logic since it can be used with the spell it shouldn’t even be included here.
---
So why add it if it doesn't make anything easier or take less effort?
---
This usually only happens every 3rd crystal that Vasa goes two. The 1st and 2nd she leaves only if team didn't dps the crystal fast enough.

&gt; looking at it through the anti-fun efficiency solo ironman lens

Didnt they teach u that in preschool?
---
"haha hes funny lets give him money"
---
You're so detached from reality it's sad. You must have been homeschooled or something. I know people 17/18 arent the most clever people on the planet but they are grown. they are sexually matured for the most part.
---
That's a mechanic, Vasa heals for a certain amount across ALL crystals then leaves the Crystal after healing that amount to teleport you to the center. So for example, if Vasa's threshold is to heal for 250HP, you kill the first Crystal after it healed 200 HP, then by the time it heals 50 HP from the second Crystal, it'll leave the Crystal immediately to teleport you once it reaches the center.
---
If you don't mind, would you care to explain?
---
So would it be open for anyone to buy or would you have to get your character's skill to 99? Would be cool to link it to accounts that way and have your RS name written on it.

Uhhh yikes. Talk about projection. Because being staunchly against pedophiles could only possibly mean in a closet pedo. Air tight logic. I think you might need some help with your weird ideas about pedophilia and your obvious hidden desires being projected onto internet strangers. Because if you read “I’m against pedophiles” and think that’s somehow a personal attack upon you and you feel the need to personally insult me, well... I got bad news for you
---
Thanks for the update! Will keep that in mind
---
I never complained about being in the minority of the community. If something was polled that didn't pass because a majority didn't want it, i don't go REEEEEing on reddit. If they polled it, and it passes, then it should be removed. Because that is how polls work lmao. 
---
99 2 str at a time
---
Holy shit I was trolling at first but you’re legitimately a confirmed pedophile lmao who has this much time to write literal paragraphs (x5) to some stranger on the internet about not being a pedo lmaoo if someone called me a pedo I’d just move on with my day cuz I’m not w kiddy toucher. Get help bud 
---
I know girls in their 20s who still look like kids and there are definitely underage girls looking 18+. Claiming that being attracted to a 17 year old is pedophily is just retarded.

Its entirely possible to type in a phrase with the word Wow in it.

I dunno, to me that's like saying it's really expensive to learn Zulrah because you have to buy a 120m arcane spirit shield to have BiS gear. You definitely don't need all that fancy stuff to do Inferno, as numerous people have shown. You can definitely do it just in the lesser gear that you do have lying around your bank 
---
Excellent work, mate.
---
Was your Olm perhaps inspired by the [Baby Dragon](https://i.imgur.com/rzn03cz.png) from Yu-Gi-Oh?
---
Who said mentally unstable?
---
17 year olds are **all** mentally in weird places. Did you know, from a developmental standpoint, when the brain is the most different from any other time in your life? Teenage years. That’s right. A 17 year old’s brain is **literally** more different from a 30 year old’s brain, than a toddler’s brain is from a 30 year old’s brain. The entire structure is different. It’s not mental instability as you have so eloquently misread, it’s just science. 
---
And no, there are literally 0 17 year old girls on this planet who are emotionally mature enough for a sexual relationship with a 23 year old. None. There are plenty who think they’re ready, but they’re wrong. 
---
And thinking that kids who still attend high school and who live at home, and who don’t understand any semblance of true responsibility, are totally ready to start banging adult men, is super wrong. 
---
Was he using a bow? Cuz thats not how bows work if you out of ammo with a bow with auto retal on you dont fight back
---
recovered account disables auth
---
Adding new best in slot items to an account build is not a quality of life change. Balance changes like that, or the new spellbook fundamentally changing how pking works, are not quality of life. Period. Regardless of whether or not you actually want the update to pass that's not even what is up for debate here.
---
You have no idea what a quality of life update is. The guy you are replying to does, and his idea of it is consistent with how Jagex used to poll updates and focus on certain updates when they had a little more integrity in how they used the polling system. Pull your head out of your ass.
---
Let me get this straight. You are arguing to make an already expensive Bis that is inaccessible to a large amount of the non dedicated player base, more expensive? Get the fuck outta here. This isn’t even like accidentally shooting yourself in the foot. You’re aiming for it. You’re literally attempting to cripple ranged, the next best option for anything like you said is Tbow, so it’s either 1B+ or 6m and then 2-3m every 9 or so hours after that. Why did you even post your trash opinion? 
---
How are you sure that ROT isn't getting paid through all of this? I don't think you can really say you control their purse strings or those of the shared members, so to claim that they aren't is disingenous. 
---
Why do you lie to us? You clearly got 2 strength before 99 hp
---
the new part is that the mainstream is pretending that they didn't sweep it under the rug for decades and he is being officially investigated now.

Isn’t this the guy who got caught accidentally using his scamming bot/auto typer on this account?

QOL Suggestion: Can we add a bank to my POH? It is inconvenient to have to teleport again somewhere else
---

---
If you were playing wow and found some guy lvling by only killing mobs w/o questing, you'd make fun of him too.
---
Way cheaper than construction too...
---
Whip is the best training weapon for melee and most slayer content with melee. So let’s just make that cost 40m as well. It doesn’t require a recharge so we should make it ungodly expensive. &lt;—— that is your logic. 
---
Technically if your ROT members are getting paid, ROT is still getting paid. You cannot refute this and I won't stand for you slandering a pvmer with a crystal bow in light of your clan's lack of transparency.
---
making the standard to ancients comparable is qol. I didn't realize coif was including with the vambs. I've stated earlier in the thread the def req should sitll be 40 for coif.  I think they look at balancing as a qol.  The term qol is too specific when qol has a broader meaning to them. The serp helm is qol since there will be a an updated fremmy line with a better neiznot.

&gt; I know girls in their 20s who still look like kid
---
Not about looks. It’s no pedophilia to like those girls because they have the emotional maturity of a girl in their 20s. They live on their own most likely, and they take responsibilities in their life
---
&gt; There are definitely underage girls looking 18+
---
There’s the creepy pedophile apologia I was waiting for. “I know she is just a child but she looked so mature!” That doesn’t exactly hold up morally (or in court). Just because a girl put some make up and nice clothes on, and looks mature, doesn’t mean adult men should be groping her. And it doesn’t mean she’s emotionally ready to be in sexual relationships with adults. It actually usually means the opposite, since she’s trying to convince the world (and herself) that she’s so much more mature than her age would let on.
---
&gt; And no, there are literally 0 17 year old girls on this planet who are emotionally mature enough for a sexual relationship with a 23 year old. None.
---
wow.
---
you're retarded
---
Even just using a black d'hide shield is fine really.
---
Funny
---
whoosh
---
i did solo wintertodt.
---
the rise 
---
Found the pedophile.
---
This question was already polled and got 44% yes so i doubt it passes. It was even me who sugfested it on qna all those years ago
---
Can I please get a pocket ge? It's tiring going to ge to update merch. 
---
Magic potions are pretty damn cheap, you could probably get away with it. But you'd have to carry several and bank a few times
---
Thank you! And no it was not. I just drew him as he is, a sassy wyrm with a wonderful smile! The only references I used for the picture were the in game models so I got the colors and designs right.
---
The problem with bows though is that they use far more ammo for the same damage output so are more expensive to run than crossbows.
---
At his ilvl id say the tank mage tower was harder than inferno...
---
People already splash up to 5 times between freezes against black dhide? We literally are already up to 10seconds of no damage and we havent even applied the bullshit change you want to add? 
---
Kid my math is a dumbed down version of a very real problem in pking. It was never meant to be 100% accurate as a dps representation. IT WAS MEANT TO SHOW THAT IF YOU ARE A PKER AND YOUR TARGET IS RUNNING YOUR FREEZE TIMER IS THE ONLY TIME YOU HAVE TO DPS THEM. It was supposed to be presented in a layman's way that even a pvmer who has never bridded before in his life could draw the correlation, not as a 100% numerically accurate count of dps vs freeze time. For fucks sake i literally said i was even averaging attack times for the sake of easy math when in reality its a .3second tick system............
---
Really kid? Your gunna pull the semantics here of my math to draw your strawman? And I quote again "Pathetic".  
---
you saw nothing
---
Jad is 8 tick. 1 attack for 6 ticks and 2 ticks off.
---
Thanks!
---
Just go to his YouTube. He has playlists for all his accounts which will start you at 1. 
---
Who even needs Zezima when you got woox?
---
Where did I say it was morally okay? Things don’t have to be pedophilia to be morally unacceptable. You’re just using the word incorrectly. Pedophilia is a psychiatric disorder, not a catch all term for sex with minors.
---
The good: pures may risk more pking, value of these blessed chaps and stuff goes up so clue scrollers make more, pures get more fashionscape
---
The bad: pure update. 
---
Aw I’m sure you’re just a child yourself who doesn’t get it yet.
---
I’m sure you’ll understand when you’re older. Because in every adult’s perspective, 17 is a child. When you’re an adult, I’m sure you’ll understand better. I thought like you when I was a teenager too. But you grow up and realize just how young and immature 17 year olds actually are.
---
lmfao 2 strength, whats the point you already failed it and everyone knows it, just give up already 
---
The page about S.T.A.S.H units on the wiki
---
That's not what quality of life means though. Those updates were generally reserved for small updates that make little things playing the game better. Interface changes, changing clickboxes to be more convenient, clicking with the scroll wheel to move the camera, things like that. It was like that for years, and keeping that clear focus was massive for this game becoming a lot more enjoyable to play.
---
Balance changes like what bis items account builds use, what the bis melee helm is, etc, are really not quality of life changes. Fundamental balance on how different spellbooks function in pvp is not quality of life. Outside of the coif update I'd be happy with things passing. That doesn't  change that the way they are proposing the updates is manipulative and misleading and that it isn't the intended focus for qol development time. These are balancing changes not quality of life changes. Period.
---
The difference between zulrah and inferno is that the requirements for zulrah are lower and the time sink is drastically lower.  It took me hours to kill my first zulrah since I was using normal trident and a rune crossbow with range and mage in the mid 70s.  It's unfair to compare zulrah to inferno since you don't get a free ticket to the end boss.  You want to have the best gear available to you since it can be win or lose by the time you're against zuk.
---
? surprised this is coming from you tbh. Why isn't tob scaled with pures? This isn't a novelty issue, this is an issue with jagex incompetence with balancing. There is 0 legitimate reasons to back up reducing points for cmb below 115 avg. Highly scaled raids are NOT efficient, just fun. Time = $ and sub 15 3+1s &gt; any scaled raids. 
---
A plus one prayer bonus doesnt give them more power. Its purely fashionscape lol
---
More variety of bosses to fight for fun even if inefficient.
---
Oh shit its the man himself 25 buttholes
---
No epci, is coke ok?
---
Yup, just noticed the total xp. Makes sense now.
---
It was legal????? By law not a pedo lol. It’s not like he’s preying on elementary kids 
---
The point completely stands that 17 is for all purposes a child compared to a 23 year old and it's beyond creepy for him to be fondling her. Stick to the rule of 1/2 + 7 of your age as a minimum for socially acceptable dating. Also, far more than age goes into consideration. A 17 year old is still in high school living with their family. They are a child in society's eyes.
---
Yeah what the fuck "So what if she was a child? He was only like 7 years older than her that's not that weird!"
---
Dude's music isn't nearly good enough to die on this hill lmao. 
---
So you would prefer the meta for the top tier PVM content to be low combat pures to be effecient? Alright mate lol.
---
Update: Finally got them on KC 553
---
How did you take 30 30 30 damage and didnt lose health?
---
You can, but my skills are grindy that I have left that I am focusing on. No time for a run, even if they are quick.
---
But you know what I mean, so why are you trying to turn this into a semantics argument? Is it so you can make the entire argument ambiguous? Or is it because you really think it’s worth your time to get me to agree with your own personal definition and have to reword my argument without changing the moral fundamental behind it?
---
I'm not talking at 15 year old girls but legal age like 16 or 17 in most states if not all. There's no excuse needed since it's legal but somehow everybody blows this out of proportion and equals it to pedophilia lmao, you're insane. Not only was she legal but she could've looked like a grown woman for sure, now I don't care enough to find a video of that and see for myself but this thread is in a dumbass circlejerk right now.
---
He said it's ironic, which it is.
---
i hope you get crashed on every slayer task forever
---
For someone who has apparently never played RS he seems to dislike it quite much.
---
Lol so many "Yeah but it's possible". That argument means literally nothing. Anything is fucking possible, you're just arguing circles while saying nothing of substance. If you REALLY want to believe that the reason the keyword wow is more popular than the keyword osrs is because wow is an actual word, then please, be my guest. You are arguing like a fanboy, WoW has way more subs than RS, of course it would trend better, that doesn't say anything about the quality of the games.
---
Vambs and chaps should be on the same question / seperated from coif. Coif is a significant upgrade while the other two arent. U have coif then robin hood hat as gear. Coifs are only -1 on robin hood hat so its a big change. 
---
This is very blown out of proportion. The definition of pedophiliac has been destroyed. 
---
Found it! 
---
Thank you!
---
I meant the 30% less hard raids. Just make them all the same and remove the 115 cb limit and 30% less points. 
---
That way the pures don't have an advantage
---
You can get a grapple buy searching a max cape and I'm sure you can get hellhound tasks. just keep canceling tasks until you get. 
---
r/wholesomerunescape
---
are u serious smh lol
---
Do you know what grooming means? lol.
---
The triple jad's in normal inferno attack every 9 so it should be possible
---
Now for my Sinclair Mansion only Ironman!
---
&gt;op
---
rcb i guess
---
damnit you beat me to it
---
Remove morytania so there would be some challenge even. 
---
Anyone who plays the game, quests, and makes real achievements has better gear than this. He paid to win by spending money on bonds to get that gear which only has stat requirements but not quest.
---
What's his intro. song? Driving me bloody crazy trying to find it while powering through the series.
---
lul :P
---
Im not a big fan of it personally. Not because I dont want to help out new players, but because the new player struggle is so engaging and the achievements feel so genuine. Id recommend not taking money from others anymore :) makes the game more fun IMO
---
Popular recolor with mutagens suggestion post, that got a supporting jmod response. 
---
Woah there buddy, what do you have against flat earthers?
---
Pretty sure the most common age of consent is 16, at the very least it's not 18
---
This is a stupid comment 
---
Absolutely not, and furthermore, ahk was 1:1 while shift drop is 1:3.  
---
Because it's 100k an hour for little input.
---
Add infernal cape on ge for 10m.
---
&gt; The freeze duration decrease will not influence your dps as long as you can refreeze immediately.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If it takes 5 splashes on black dhide to land a 10 second freeze, do you realize how much of a distance buff that is compared to a 20 second? Do you realize how much further a pkers target could run in those 10 seconds of splashes? And now you want to make this more common? Your nerf is only balanced if magic accuracy is properly balanced in this game, and its is fucking not. Black dhide + the way magic defense is (70\*mage level + 30\*def level) + augury amplifying this effect means that the pker in todays wilderness splashes often. If they change how magic def scaling works then yes they can half the freeze timers too, but if you cut the freeze timers and keep it the same you would be able to run from 40 to 20 wild in 2 freezes. Thats 20 levels of wilderness for 20 seconds of dps.   
---
&gt;bro..

Sir Digby Chicken Ceaser!

I seasoned my steak with all the salt in this thread

yeah good one. just sit there and jerk off for 20 minutes lookin for a world. real fun.
---
Absolutely, everyone and there mom knows the earths true form is shaped like a donut. Primitive apes.
---
I did not mention anywhere about anything coming from Slayer. The attachment can come from anything. All I mentioned is that it should be over 10m to give value. Please take your time when reading if you intend to reply. 
---
devalues my "only one slayer tower" only ironman
---
It's mainly because raids 1 buffs = lots going there, demand up
---
It’s a screenshot of a username. There isn’t even proof. I’m not promoting botting but this post tells us nothing.
---
How many times do I have to tell this to you;
---
ROT IS NOT BEING PAID. NOBODY IN ROT IS BEING PAID. Why can you not fucking understand this? THE PVMERS PAY THE OWNERS OF THE CC. THE OWNERS OF THE CC ARE NOT ROT. Slandering a pvmer with a crystal bow?
---
HE'S NOT A PVMER YOU STUPID FUCK HE'S A RAGGER/HARASSER. HE HAS NO INTEREST IN PVMING WHATSOEVER. Holy fuck I've been so transparent with you and you keep failing to understand the fucking words I KEEP REPEATING TO YOU; NOBODY IN ROT IS BEING PAID.
---
WAKE THE FUCK UP DUMBASS
---
&gt; They can but they don't. On release as it is warding is more useful than firemaking.
---
Use doesnt matter. It would be very "useful" if we had a Ditto skill where we could replicate other monsters such as Zulrah so we could walk around as Zulrah and Jad and Corporal Beast. THAT would be useful. But it wouldnt be a skill. 
---
&gt; Also Magic is useful for so many damn things. If you talk about medieval combat you talk about range, melee, and mage.
---
Where did I state otherwise. It could simply be a utiliy skill.
---
&gt; ​What doesn't make sense is random monsters dropping magic armor just so we can have it in game.
---
Fantastic how I havent heard anyone suggest "warding" before and people trying to convince me its essential lmao. The first time I heard of warding was when jagex announced it at RF. Why was that the first time? Because its stupid and fabricated.
---
&gt; ​
---
Rune Armour makes sense. As the monsters killed some NOOBY knights and got their Armour(Which if you follow lore meant it was mined from rocks, and then smithed) Which means without monsters we can have rune Armor.
---
False. Armour just happens to be what u can make with bars. U can make dart tips with bars, too. And axes. And whatever. Its not limited to something. And same for crafting. Jewellery is a bigger category than armour alone.
---
&gt; Without monsters we can not have Mystic armor. So how did these specters create a random piece of mage armor? Exactly, it makes no damn sense
---
Without bandos we cant have bandos armour. So how did bandos create bandos armour? Exactly, it makes no damn sense.
---
&gt; It fits the lore.
---
It doesnt fit the lore at all.
---
triple jads aren't hard. its legit just one fight cave jad on 1.5 AS
---
Little bit of both ;)

Short version: 
---
A YouTuber. He started doing challenges for money to put in a drop party on the 25th of December.
---
Got 3.5 billion gp approximately. 
---
Then, during the stream, every world he'd hop to would damn nearly crash due to the influx of people
---
That's pretty cool they made land with a water texture in wonder if they can animate it aswell
---
How am I sure? because I'm co-owner you stupid fuck. I think I know where all the fucking money goes you dumbshit. We have a system for where the money goes and I can irre-fucking-futably say nobody in rot is being paid. Piss off idiot.
---
50% chance of succesfully smelting iron ores into iron bars.
---
Should we turn osrs into rs3? Currently it’s headed there
---
Should have seen them try to guess what the Graceful effect is on the QnA the other week.
---
ah well, regardless of how long it took, huge congrats. Sorry if I came off as a douche that post, had a rough night last night.
---
Feelsohwait... 
---
You could have QoL improvements that could use polling since not everyone agrees.
---
The rat pole thing you linked is something that doesnt need to be polled because its such a minor QoL thing. Magic autocast remembering (Q #11) is also a QoL improvement, however it is a bit more major and not everyone agrees to such major changes, especially since they can impact combat/skilling more than expected.
---
i have 8-9 pets 2 are skilling (82 hunter 88 WC) just got vorki at 183, zulrah at like 700, k'ril at 750 or so.... ect. hullpup at 500 smoke before 350 ect....
---
the funny thing is all my KC over 1,000 i dont have the pets for hahaa
---
1690 yeoooooooooo
---
GUYS ITS FUCKING +1 PRAYER IN EXCHANGE FOR TAKING AN EXTRA 250K+ RISK THOSE MEAN PURES TELLING YOU TO SIT AT GREEN DRAGS AREN'T EVEN GOING TO USE THEM OUTSIDE OF TRAINING.
---
Not the coif though fuck that noise who even lumped that in with the vambs lol.
---
No man wtf lol
---
Voting no. Let's get a bis str helm elsewhere. 
---
There's a difference between pking in the wilderness and player harassment. Stop trying to justify it.
---
It’s funny how the tables have turned, I quit rs in 2010 for wow and now I’ve quit wow for osrs. 
---
Ah yeah but my comb stats are only 60/40/50 and I hate the idea of getting PK'd. I'll just train magic I suppose 
---
How long does this take? I notice many people have different accounts for different skills, and multiple accounts have 99 in some skills. 
---
I’ve been playing Runescape since 2007, and I’ve never gotten anything level 99. I mean, I was younger then. But I’m close to getting my first 99, which is magic. 
---
How long does it take and how much grinding? Any tips?
---
Go on YouTube, look at any pk vid from 2018. Now look at their inventory, now go to another, then another, and another. What do they have in common? Granite maul in inventory. Regardless of whether it's a combo wep or not, it's almost required in the current meta of overeating and nhing. I've pked for 10 years, it's never been as common as it is now. It's also never been as cheap. 
---
Only bis if you have the elite diary done
---
Nice gp/h btw
---
Cringe edits
---
Scum
---
Why wait for a bone crusher? Shouldn't you wait with every task until you have that then? 
---
Love the sub and cc. Really cool, friendly community. 
---
They should just change that aussie pvp world into regular world 
---
how is this not a bug?
---
Fight player harassment with player harassment? nah we're getting him banned.
---
Not to mention after this buff I'm sure scale prices will go up even more. Venom pots are still cheaper than the head regardless.
---
You vote no because you dont agree with the change. Why should he skip the question if he doesnt agree with it?
---
I asked for #3. Would help a bit when doing Vorkath
---
I didn't crunch the numbers exactly, but I think I remember 5 tree x2, 5 fruit tree+calquat x1, 5herb+allotment+flower x3 makes it like 46 days or something (from a video I watched a couple montgs ago where the guy did crunch numbers)? Now we have one more tree, one more fruit tree, celastrus, redwood, herb/allotment/flower, there are cactus patches and mushroom patches and bush patches and hops patches. Not to mention the new snape grass and cactus seeds give ridiculous xp, and that you can do the herb/allotment/flower runs way more than 3x a day if you want to.
---
Anyways, you get the picture. It might not be less than a month but I'm pretty sure it's damn close.
---
We use the bank probably more than anything else. If ever there were a place to focus on QoL updates, this is it. 
---
It stacks
---
It was tolerated if you kept a 1:1 ratio of click to action.
---
It should be reversed, one woox is easily able to overpower all of those mobs
---
Why would it say "You feel something weird sneaking into your backpack"? Did you have something else following you at the time?
---
Well yeah, I meant to say a lot of dudes juicing are gonna look good but not unattainable natty. For some it's just an easy way to be cut
---
interested to know where 4 pieces of 3a would fit into this sequence
---
Yea it stacks. Bgs feels more accurate but if the dwh hits, cya bandos.
---
Can you link it? Or is it a sub reddit?
---
Yeah... when you're 16 tho you. can sleep with anybody
---
Seems like you either get it really early or after going like waaaay over dry
---
No ones gonna waste time swapping 3m rs3 to osrs. 
---
Imma stay incognito. But hi trictagon. i know ur reading this. also tell dragon i love him. Say fuck u to Toluca. And just in case. Hello my glorious bald leader. stay frosty. 
---
Makes me wish they'd realize that all of the times this game has died off (EOC being the biggest example) it was because they ruined pvp. It's a massive part of what keeps the game alive.
---
Sounded like he was bout to suffocate there for real
---
Fam, u got a missed call
---
Yes to both. Say the monster has level 100 defence. Hit a 25 with BGS and it will be 75. Hit another 25 and it will be 50. Hit anything but 0 with DWH and it will be 70. Hit with DWH again and it will be 49.
---
you stated that legality has nothing to do with morality, but you're calling 17 year olds children. on what basis? a legal basis? a physiological basis?
---
cause if you're calling 17 year olds children on a legal basis, then your argument is over because they're both adults of legal age. if you're calling her a child on a physiological basis, then drake was 23, which is an age that is not fully developed physiologically.
---
i think you're just making this way more dramatic than it actually is. the video was posted a month ago, everyone on the internet saw it, and the outrage has been barely any. and this is in an era where people online will go out of their way to tear celebrities down at any opportunity, and in an era where people are extra sensitive to this kind of shit because of people like r kelly. when you're calling drake a pedophile you're just making actual pedophilia seem like less of a big deal.

This was posted before today’s update and has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
It is in regards to the forum/news letter post where they proposed today’s updates, and also talked about how they wanted to get rid of scouting.
---
That’s what I was talking about.
---
Question #3, is clicking on the ground when you get frozen that hard?
---
So there's no way AHK is faster than shift click. Two clicks vs one click.
---
Yet neither of those two items are degradeable at a cost of 250k an hour to use. If the Serp Helm didn't cost scales to use, or didn't cost as many scales to use, then it'd certainly have an argument for more widespread viability. As it stands currently the cost simply outweighs the benefits in all but the most niche scenarios, such as poisoning the boss in ToB.
---
I know right. 
---
Zulrah is really easy to do on mobile with tbow
---
Maybe have an option for 24 hours to pass before being able to log in on a recovered account???
---
How the heck did you spawn 6 Jads is the real qurstion??
---
Yeah who cares about what words actually mean.
---
Most dudes who juice don't look like shredded animals because that takes both a ton of gear, time and a strict diet. Allot of gym dudes take only test and could easily pass as natty. 
---
It's stacks but with the d Warhammer it's reduces defence for 30% but if you do 2 in a row the first will do 30% the second will decrease 30% from the 70% of defence it has as the first hit, which will reduce it 21%. So 2 successful hits will reduce it to 49% of the starting defense. 
---
You can filter by category. If you add the "computers and videogames" filter you can be pretty certain that anyone searching "wow" is searching for the game. Look at my other posts in this thread, you guys are arguing over something which has a concrete answer
---
INB4 some guy joins, tells you to hop, and calls you a fag.....
---
But you'd need a certain magic level for necromancy right
---
Too bad he doesn't have a cam, that sounded like a quinn69 style popoff 
---
It is 50/50 i mean last year i had 2bill on rs3 i made 9bill for red phat in less then 48 hours which blew my mind But i ended up losing it all in less then a day from greed. Sure formulas can work to a certain degree but you need money to make money idk its weird. I havent staked since and its the best decision i made never to go back
---
I do, because I’m 10k dry of dwh and 1k dry of hilt lol. That being said I didn’t say I personally can’t solo Tekton. I can but will never chose to do so again until I get a dwh/bgs. Shit took forever. Just saw they updated him today though so might go see how long it takes now
---
Regardless of his flaws with the stream, no one should be able to recover an account if it's actively being played on by the orginial owner... Don't blame the victim when this could easily have been avoided if Jagex even put some what of an effort into the appeal..
---
Cold caller. Fuck em
---
&gt; since the world's a sphere :D
---
what did he mean by this
---
I think its because, instead of spawning the creature to then kill for xp, you just donate the heads, resulting in less xp... so, yes, higher xp is available, if you also have the magic lvl and runes to spawn it, instead of just donating it.. 500 seems a little steep, maybe 1k instead, but if you dont spawn the dragon, i agree with that you shouldnt get the same xp, as if you did.
---
google sharkbrew.  It's a forum. 
---
I do nigga. Leave it on cuz all I do is slayer and farming 
---
It is. Part two coming soon 
---
AND THEY'LL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY HATE SUCCESS
---
solo raids are harder but saying inferno isn't even that hard is literally retarded lmfao
---
even with best gear + tbow you still have to be very good at the game to complete it.
---
If he does it last he can do all of them.
---
What does this mean? Is it because he looks healthy/fit now?
---
Genuinely curious.
---
&gt;accounting for inflation in a video game
---
pack it up boys our virginity will never be taken
---
U need a main. Ur shooting yourself in the foot by not doing any content in which you will eventually die anyways.
---
2 Str... pleb. Try again 
---
All those bonds
---
Yes I also would love this. 
---
At least it wasn’t a jar 
---
Well yeah you can train every other skill continuously while farming pretty much is passive unless ur doing tithe which was the whole point of op's comment
---
You'd be surprised at how much faster it is to mash keys on a keyboard compared to using a mouse.
---
Economy of the game is tied to the economy of a whole country so no
---
You've obviously never played TF2 if you think Jagex just rolls their thumbs all day while pushing updates and new content.
---
Like I said below, you could just chin it
---
It is! [Full version here ](https://youtu.be/x5hpnl6Tj1I) part 2 in the works!
---
He went full ape-shit x)
---
What lvl to squeeze my hog without getting tired so quick
---
Because they get mad when they dedicate an overtly large amount of time to something and feel like it's a personal attack against them when a more efficient training method is released, or something undercuts their efforts. 
---
AKA, they have no semblance of what it's like to be told their achievements don't really mean a damn thing.
---
reeee pvp updates reeee vote no! reeeeee
---
(average pvmer)
---
So mash keys with mouse keys then, either way, fewer keys to mash.
---
That's RWT, you are buying (real jokes) with GP Kappa

Pretty sure Weinstein is being prosecuted. Also, see Spacey and Cosby. Things are changing, although it is long overdue.

Ice burst is the cheapest which is why most use it. Smoke burst can still work.
---
All are different :) 1-2 Months probably?
---
You forgot thieving room
---
people stake real recklessly and either end up getting cleaned or making big money.
---
you don't profit staking long term at all. especially now w/ the tax.
---
Really just gotta keep at it - every bit of experience helps
---
Congrats on 99 Magic :D and an impressive untrimmed cape!
---
If you say “17 is not a child” then you’re either a pedophile, and pedophile apologist, or (most likely) you’re 17 or younger and you don’t really understand the perspective that real adults have. I’m not robbing her of her agency as a human being when I say she’s a child; I’m just stating the  fact that you don’t have to be that old to see “17 years old” and think “Yeah that’s a child, and an adult 23 year old probably shouldn’t be acting sexually toward her at all”.
---
And just because I always saw people asking, his maxed UIM series music was Freeze Me by DFA 1979.

the process has to be delegated somehow in a more efficient manner yes. seeing as it is a game and not real life as youve pointed out, I would just say the people are picked in some logical and reasonable manner by Jagex. Its their game so they need to realize its in their and the games best interest and just do it

I got to well over 90 farming before I figured out you can pay to have the trees removed.  I am not very smart. 
---
Honestly expected the opposite reaction but I don't watch him that much to judge how he'd react lol because after 24k kc you'd think he'd be like "ok cool finally" lol
---
Right, I'm agreeing with part of what you said and disagreeing with the rest.

If you see this chick, and she's bangin. Like, shes got perfect tits in a tight shirt with booty shorts on and shes got this smile that makes you hard on command,  and she turns to you and says "I'm only 16." Does your dick shrivel after that or does it linger for a while and go "idk man this is risky is this the kind of guy we are I might head out."? Because if it hangs around for a bit, you might have a problem. But that's where we agree. Where we dont seem to agree Is that you got hard in the first place but shes only 16. Its in your nature. At least if you're attracted to women.

Just want to say that you're implying everyone stopped using AHK after the ban.
---
And if say most maybe get 4 drops in a tick.
---
Yes shift click is better, but let's slow down there
---
Here's to hoping they don't have to find out the hard way, I know I did :/
---
its like a ptr build it doesn't carry into the real game :/
---
I got you dog.

Rhetoric is like balsamic vinegar; I love that shit. If i find some I like, I'll boil it down to a sweet reduction.

That's just a flaw in democracy though.  In reality, voters are regularly faced with a choice between what's "right" vs. what's good for them.  The whole point is that polling the population at large should produce some idea of what it is that people would like to see happen, regardless of what their reasons might be.

I got laser eye surgery over a year ago and i still catch myself adjusting my glasses sometimes.
---
its just one of those things that jagex decided to spend time changing. it's only a real niche scenario where it would be useful to be able to do that.
---
don't share your acc. nub
---
RuneLite with the 2005 overlay.
---
Also, to tag someone use "/u/" before their name like /u/lilpump22.
---
Skips don't count as a no. Or a yes. It changes nothing.
---
That one is definitely QOL, that's why OP did not circle it.  I don't even see what the argument would be for that to not be a QOL change - what, because it makes Vorkath slightly easier?  There's no way that would result in any significant impact on the content.  I would be shocked if a SINGLE person in the game would go from not being able to farm Vorkath to being able to farm Vorkath based on that change alone.

Swapped out the Book of Darkness for a Mage's Book to make it a bit more fair, and the Swamp setup is better than Fire Surge until 105 mage, where DPS is equal until 101 where Fire Surge starts being better. So if you're keeping 100% uptime on the Imbued Heart, it's better even considering the stat drain after 7 minutes. [Here's a screenie of the chart if you wanna check it out](https://i.imgur.com/1AdRgfV.png) . Augury does actually make Fire Surge slightly better from 104, but the overall average is still better for Trident.

Staker on Monday: "I made 4b in 2 days lmao." Next Monday: "yeah, had a bad day. I just ended up buying back my tbow with bonds."
---
Please stop assuming other people are stupid. We all know it's not actually 50-50 in real life. However in this game it's 50-50.
---
You are a prime candidate for r/iamverysmart
---
I only included rooms where you fight monsters. Since there is nothing to fight in the thieving or resource rooms, I did not include them. Scavengers are in the image though!
---
no, no, yes, yes
---
1. Blessed coifs are +5 ranged and +def bonusses over regular coifs
---
3. Serp was nerfed to make place for future helm upgrades like the one from the new (ditched) fremennik quest.
---
&gt;i guess this means multi-step tasks you can't do another task in between it? intended
---
well thats the way it is, intended or not.
---
&gt;what about world hopping?
---
anything is fine except completing another diary task
---
Uhhh you sure seem to fantasizing about the “hot body” of a 16 year old girl a little bit too much, there. And don’t use biology as the justification, please. That’s horrifyingly ignorant, and abusive of science.
---
By the way I wouldn’t get a hard-on in the first place, because she’s 16 and it’s super duper easy to tell when you’re a full-fledged adult (and i don’t just get a binder every time i see an attractive adult anyway). You’ll understand when you’re older. I even see college aged Undergrad girls around University campus and I’m like “Holy shit these are some *children*!” I taught a class for undergrads for the past 2 years and every semester I would be baffled at how young they look. I certainly wouldn’t fuck around (or even think that way) with a girl around 18 even if she looked on the older side of that age range. 21 would be an absolute **minimum** for me if I wasn’t married, and I would still prefer 22-26 because that means at least she’s out of undergrad

That does not matter, just because something is or isnt does not make it 50%, it just makes it 2 outcomes. Its like saying you have a 50% chance of winning the powerball, because either you lose or you win. But thats not how probability work. 
---
Thanks for an actual answer even tho it’s not what I want to hear. 
---
With that said WHY can’t I put the items back in my bank? I have a full inventory of members items that I was gonna sell. This account is basically being held hostage unless I pay $11
