Zulrah with max gear (TBow not necessary) &gt; Vorkath with DHCB &gt; Zulrah with mid tier gear (Ahrims, Blessed Dhide, Zenytes, Rigour) &gt; Vorkath with BP

Okay that‚Äôs what I was wondering, I wasn‚Äôt sure if making a ton of lopsided trades would get me banned or something
---
It just changes the icons. May I post a screenshot of my screen. Maybe this was a misunderstanding.
---
I‚Äôm voiding with blowpipe vorkath currently
---
With the scale price as high as it it, they're probably dead even.
---
But if the scale price drops a lot then Vorkath is better.

What's going on here?

Oof, 100% not going to continue this as your not an OSRS player or more into RS3 (which is just bad). Literally here just to troll.

Too bad its passing

Loool oh ok. Yea me too sometimes, just have to kinda train your ear for it I guess. 
---
still made a donation
---
that sounds pretty similar to my experience, but i use void instead of dhide. since i mage everything except ahrim and tunnels, void is faster dps for both range and mage.  The extra mage bonus is definitely noticeable when you're maging karil for void vs dhide

Sorry I meant suicide a non-bronzeman main account to your bronze man account. It would count as a pk technically and you'd unlock whatever you want

The usd -&gt; gbp conversion is  also much more favorable to Jagex now than it was in 2008 as well.
---
Just do Zulrah then, you get similar kills/hr but zulrah is more gp/kill
---
I would love to buy the kalphite queen print!

Getting it to the front page of the sub is the only way to get attention from Jagex Customer Support these days

IMO dragon darts are one of those things you use if you're barely at requirements to do what you're trying to do. So if you just can't seem to out dps healers on jad or find you die every 3rd of 4th Vorkath, adding dragon darts makes those kills way more consistent. You also barely break them resulting in a stack of 200 dragon darts lasting over an hour in most scenarios when bossing.
---
So like if you're trying to learn Zulrah or Vorkie and have 79 range with 76 mage, it's probably pretty wise to try and use all the BiS gear you can afford to learn it. Now when you're 92 range and 92 mage with a anguish and Vorkie assembler, sure, use adamant darts.
---
But you can't say that his kills would be as consistent with addy darts without knowing what stats his account has or what other gear he is using. If he only is rocking a glory and void switch the darts might be what got him that 600 KC and he'd barely have 450 KC if he used not BiS gear.
---
Adding dragon darts doesn't make anything more profitable, it makes you doing it more consistent. With the way this subreddit rags on people you'd assume after Adamant Darts Jagex should just completely remove them so they don't waste GP. Like they are in the game for a reason and are meant to be used depending on your situation.

There's no ego, I don't know why you are just making that stuff up. I like unlocking content and gear without being able to skip stuff. It's a lot easier to do that with a game system than self-imposed. I have considered starting a Bronze man if Gudi puts out that Runelite plugin.
---
So your reasoning is, you picked a game mode that is flawed, it needs to stay flawed to punish you for picking it? You don't make much sense man. You sound like hate ironmen for some reason, and that you think we need to suffer for a choice of game mode and be stuck with whatever that entails.
---
The game can change, that's why we have polls. They even said they're considering Ironman only polls. That's the game we play so you're gonna have to live with it.
---
I know it takes longer but I feel blowpipe is easier for Vorkath during his special attacks than any crossbow. 
---
That's right! You're the first one to point that out!
---
What's your point? 
---
Could always add a coloured trim?
---
There were a few enjoyable things about this system. The statuettes that you got from drops could sometimes be worth 10 times your risk, so it was really all a roll of the RNG dice. The Edgeville hotspot was also a great source of entertainment, I met a few friends from people just talking and being bored. It would also be fun to see D claw rushers try to get some of the people in the hotspot. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt a good system at all, and I would never like to see it returned. However, it did have good moments, but those moments never outweighed the boring as fuck AFKing at Edgeville.

"Hey stop progressing and just stagnate!"

I find progressing quests fun. My god. Quests in rs3 require levels. I already only do reaper if its a fun boss, but the other two actually unlock quests faster shocking i know. How dare he want to enjoy the game.
---
Yeah I've used the dhcb. It really depends on ur specs from the bolts but I've gotten him down in 1:20 with 79 ranged using the dhcb. Tbp is definitely slower but I more commonly use it.

This is nice. Makes it easier to spot Ironman and who to crash when I can't find an empty world. Support!

Nothing sarcastic or inaccurate about it. This has been doable since actual 2007 and doesn't even require a custom client.
---
Some bosses have multiple forms. Meaning you have to kill all forms to get the points. 
---
I.e; boss has 3 forms, you must kill all 3 forms to get points. Can be annoying sometimes because you'll kill one form then the same boss will respawn so youll have 2 of the same boss but 1 will be his 2nd form technically. Usually not to big a deal just means you need to pay a little attention sometimes but usually it will even itself out and you'll kill them sooner or later if afking. I would look up which bosses have multiple forms, ICR off top my head which ones do. Naziroth or something I think (the ghost looking one?) Has multiple forms for example.

Spend it all on a buyable skill because you will be back at the duel arena eventually and lose everything including your house and family once the gambling addiction takes root in your real life.

I play iron because it's more satisfying, not necessarily more challenge. The doing stuff on your own aspect and items having more than just a GP value is why I like the mode.

Can't believe jagex added Tofu from RE2 without polling it.

Would she assign anything in the new slayer dungeon though? Because you need 44 slayer for the boots of stone right? 
---
This isnt  cool guys that guy really did go to lumby
---
But why do you need the game to prevent you from cheating? If you enjoy the game mode, you shouldn‚Äôt want to cheat, and if you don‚Äôt, then why not deiron and play like an Ironman but only buy shit you can‚Äôt be bothered to do (sand).
---
I don‚Äôt hate ironmen. But I do feel bad for the people who‚Äôve put thousands of hours into it just for updates to come and make it only a few hundred hours to get close to the same progress (don‚Äôt call me out for a hyperbole) and again, you‚Äôre not stuck with shit. You can literally deiron any time and there‚Äôs a week day as well as a small delay for customer service to initiate the process.
---
If they have Ironman only polls, will I be included as an ex-iron? Will they be able to vote in normie polls? And either way it‚Äôs dumb because half the ironmen ‚ÄúQOL‚Äù don‚Äôt just effect ironmemes. And if they bring Ironman only polls into the game, they should bring in skiller polls, PVP‚Äôer polls, and PVM‚Äôer polls as well. And when they do that our voting system will suck.

I'd rather if it didn't change the color. Make it have the stats, but remain the distinction between uim, reg iron and hcim.

It could even serve as an unlock (Adam gives the highest tier you've unlocked), though it is a bit of an uim buff.
---
What I do is, train slayer to afford skills. I can usually make 1-3m every few hours and just splurge that on skilling to save time. 77 slayer, if not possible, they do save time however it‚Äôll take you days-weeks longer. I got from 55 crafting-70 in 6 hours, cost me like 2m
---
upbooth
---
Is the dock planks bothering anyone else?
---
Most of my crafting was done from battlestaves which profited me enough gp to get 99 con with exclusively with mahogany. I did like 83-85 at charters cuz that was right before raids 1 came out and I really wanted to upgrade to a fury. Apart from that all my sand was from drops/bert. And a ton of my post 85 came from gems I got raiding. 
---
Maybe a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon for the sake of memes.
---
Watch the market.  When scales are expensive like right now Zulrah can be better money - but when scales are cheaper Vorkath is better.
---
How many times you gonna post this? Also mmc is unironically shit
---
99 craft and construction give good cape tps maybe best in the game 
---
The only tasks not requiring 44 slayer in there are Hellhounds, Greaters and Fire Giants, but Im sure that Jagex did not overlook that. I assume Konar cant assign them until youre 44 combat because usually, you wont get assigned tasks that you cannot directly do.

Congrats, that's still 12 hours to bank just the sand for 99, and assuming you are using the shitty small chunks of stone.
---
If you are going to tick manip, you're wasting time for fuckign 50k/hour when the SAME AREA has over double the exp via granite.
---
EHP for ironmen is still charters by about 12 hours even with your grossly overestimated rates.
---
How that? The average hard clue isn't like 350k?
---
No, you, don't, get, it.  No, one, cares, when, it's, just, reddit.
---
I have never gotten a barrows item drop I gave up at 60
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not 90k average. Its always packed, and even doing it without it being packed is like 80k iirc. And what‚Äôs meta isn‚Äôt necessarily EHP, I can do giant seaweed and sand buckets much longer than I can do charters which allows me to actually finish the grind. I‚Äôd know, I did 67-85 crafting at charters a long time ago and it was about 8 hour days. I burnt out of RS for 2 weeks because of charters.
---
Because they made the game mode, now they can tune that mode. I chose to play it when I saw that they made the mode and then they have decided to do updates similar to this one for sandstone to help even out the crappy gameplay experiences, I didn't pick it to be a static never changing game mode.
---
The sunk cost fallacy isn't helping your argument. Just because others did the bad grind doesn't mean it shouldn't change. This whole notion that it "devalues" ironmen that did it already is exactly the ego issue you were talking about earlier. There should be no ego or "value" in the time investment, it should be done because that's what they wanted to do.
---
And I'm not sure about the polling, I'm just relaying what they said on stream.
---
Because it's been a while and I'm not sure where I was when I left off.

Also I want to redo the quests

Did it bug anyone else that he was just barely off-center?

Even with full inv of brews and restores? I watched some people fight him and it seems like he rarely hits more than 15, unless of course you run into his instakills

---
devalues his $11 btw

Who cares about ehp, it's a game.  It's not a competition to see how much of your life you can waste, it's for having fun.

A lot of the people in BH are venezuelan, that 150k could help feed them.  That's part of why BH is full of pures - pures are the fastest acct to make, the cheapest to PK with and still profit in BH.  It's a win win for venezuelans who usually get banned frequently.

Not a question but an experience for me. I helped a guy find Ned‚Äôs house in draynor. He asked me where it was and we were near the jail. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so close!‚Äù I thought. I told him to follow me and led him there. In return, he gave me $50,000 coins. I was shocked.

I have had this idea for awhile now, shorter guides for experienced players who just wanna get straight to it.

no worries. Hope you have better luck in future

No one was bragging about how they play, thats just how you interpreted it. Then you proceeded to bash some dude for not enjoying the game the same way you do like an ignorant dickhead. Who are you to say something isn‚Äôt healthy or good when you have absolutely no idea who you‚Äôre talking to? Stop projecting. 
---
So should I zulrah until I can buy an ACB? Or what would you say I should get before I switch to vorkath 
---
This is great, thanks. Not seen it before!

Do it the other way around. You wanna camp range prayer because the animation is shorter, which means your prayer swaps are easier.

If you just put on slayermusiq and blast through the quest it isn‚Äôt enjoyable.

Most famliies!?!??! Everyone I knew in 06 had dial up including me
---
That's why I don't use guides
---
When your total range level is only 97 with range pot, no void and no rigour 3 max hit is actually significant. So if you are killing a thing that gives an average of 160k per kill, spending 40,000 GP per kill to guarantee it is consistent money. Versus spending 22,000 GP per kill but you fail it 1/3rd more frequently.
---
If everyone went off the advice that this subreddit gives we'd all be 2k total, all diaries completed, have Rigour/Augury, a Twisted bow, and Dragon Hunting gear to fight content in. 
---
Some people want to do the content but barely meet the requirements stat wise. So their combats are mid-level but they did say 99 mining and Runecrafting first because they personally enjoy it, well now to them 1k dragon darts is at least 200 KC on any boss and since they only have mid level stats that +3 max hit actually adds up. I'm also fairly sure there is some accuracy components to dragon darts, but tbh I'm going to be downvoted eitherway so I'll just leave it at this.
---
I don't go around advising people to use them, but I at least understand there place in the game. Not everyone is max combat with 300 million in gear.
---
Even if updates specifically for Pures don't pass, there are a lot of updates that affect Pures that they should be able to vote on just as much as other players. For example, stuff like the Abyssal Dagger or even the Rapier affect accounts like Pures.

I'm an ironman with 88 crafting and the seaweed for 99 already sitting in the bank and I still voted no. The idea itself isn't bad but the number of effective buckets of sand/hr are way too high and it honestly feels like Jagex picked it out of a hat without any real consideration.
---
Osrs and in particular ironman is meant to be a grind and high crafting is one of the most desirable endgame goals, I don't see why it should be made so much easier. Even more than it devalues the achievement for people who already got it, it cheapens it for people who get it via this method in the future. I was so happy when I got my first glory because of how much of a struggle it was to make. If it was a lot easier I honestly wouldn't have cared anywhere near as much.
---
Even though gathering sand isn't fun, it's not really much worse than any other afk activity like cooking fish or fletching bows. The only people who really hate it are those who seek the instant gratification in the form of exp drops or those who don't want to put in time to achieve their goals. Imo these people are playing the wrong game mode and changes shouldn't be made to ironman itself to cater to them.

so this game is fucking huuuuge and the simple truth is that the vast majority of people are doing the vast majority of things wrong virtually all the time. that's ok though, is the thing. abandon the idea that you're going to everything correctly and efficiently because it's just not gonna happen as a new player.

&gt;I also feel like I should just get the graceful set due to how often i'm just slowly trundling around the landscape, but it just takes so many hours. I have about 30 graceful marks and I have no urge to go back and do more of that!
---
this, however, is an issue and one that you will face absolutely everywhere. this game is a grind. tasks are measured in tens, hundreds, sometimes even thousands of hours. obviously some tasks are more or less fun than others so a lot of it doesn't *feel* like a grind, but the reality is that everything takes a long fucking time. if you can't get into that, this perhaps isn't the right game for you.
---
finally, to actually address your question: 
---
&gt;How can I get law runes cheaply?
---
you can't. 230 is what they cost lol. in the scheme of things they are very very inexpensive and as you advance in the game you'll notice that little stuff like teleport runes don't even constitute a drop in the bucket, they're straight up negligible.
---
efficient. Problem is if all irons train like that like it used to be you almost never got max xp because of stock problems so it was never sustainable.
---
It's basically accuracy vs amount drain
---
Bgs will hit more but drains based off the hit
---
Dwh is more inaccurate, but no matter what u hit it will drain the same amount.
---
Dharoks is only worth using with high enough str/hp, you'd be better off using obby sword/armour/b neck at your level
---
I don't know what's better, the comparison or the fact that you used the stream for a pic and used a busted phone to have the other picture and another phone to take the picture 
---
That‚Äôs not true. The answer was 7 until jagex moved the boat. Runelite is now incorrect because jagex changed the answer to 6. Get your facts right before you go shitting on people
---
No I get the joke mate lol
---
Nm, u?
---
Why not just use like a laptop or something?
---
Why's mobile required for this?
---
baskets of strawberries are a good option for fight caves because you can use safespots to buy yourself unlimited time to sit and eat. this doesn't apply to ds2 though cuz you don't get infinite time on vorkath or galvek to just sit and chomp through strawberries. in fights like ds2 brews really have no comparable alternative. everything else is much much worse.
---
Just like with charters stock can be a problem. I have gone to buy astrals and only found fully bought out shops. That is the problem with shops on iron they are good till everyone is doing it.
---
I actually never understood why it wasn't able to be put in POH Portal form in the first place. The Trollheim teleport is pretty much the same thing and that can be put in. Was there some specific reason?
---
They wrote per hour and nowhere does it say that only one is completed per hour. 
---
To be honest, Robert was the hardest fight in the quest for me, that asshole just never missed and hit 15+ Everytime. What's your melee stats?
---
Gslvek and vorkath are really very easy fights, I did it at 85 range. Though I did have the funds for a dhcb, so that probably sways it more positively for me.
---
He's owning the shit out of it good for him lmao
---
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt buy gold‚Äù &gt; has like 250m lul
---
No, no they didn‚Äôt. They wanted to shut down runelite because it had a deobfuscation tool that exposed Jagex‚Äôs source code to anyone, which is a security issue and makes botting infinitely easier
---
Please don‚Äôt spread misinformation
---
I highly doubt buckets of sand will be targeted as a money maker, they're already obtainable via nightmare zone, and that is far easier and more efficient to do than this.
---
Happy cake day!
---
For hunter are you talking about monkeys being afk?
---
Giant seaweed was plenty enough of a buff. Crafting is grindy but it‚Äôs absolutely doable in its current state. There‚Äôs 0 competition and it‚Äôs very rewarding, no need to change anything

I do that in other MMOs, but Runescape quests are just so unique for me. If it's my first time through a quest I don't skip the dialogue. 
---
Watched Scott‚Äôs tots for like the 892nd time today. Not disappointed still. 
---
I really like the idea, but 4 pts for Black Knight's Forteress is too much for what it's worth. I get the risk, the requirement and the importance of balancing all the F2P QP, but you just have to run north and figure out a bunch of puzzle that are already programmed in these bots or something. 
---
If the player had to defeat one lv33 knight, I would still not allocate that point. I would allocate 3 to Black Knight's and the balance to Ernest The Chicken, which sure isn't much harder but since this is all about worth, can you really compare it to Cook's assistant, Sheep Shearer, Romeo and Juliet or even Witch's potion? 
---
Not to mention that you would be giving 4 pts for just a little sabotage mission but you would give 5 for Dragon Slayer. The difference between the two is pretty steepe in terms of challenge, let's be honest, even if it requires some level of questing before even starting Black Knight's Forteress.
---
You might not want to balance that loose point on Ernest the Chicken, maybe you could balance it elsewhere.
---
Now, I know that this is just a suggestion that you are making and I'm just trying to suggest you a better version and please feel free to send me your feedbacks.

Question about rules.
---
If I set it up so all I have to do it push a single button to spam mouse click and just that. 
---
So if I press F1 it will spam mouse click, then I manually move the mouse myself, does that violate the rules? 
---
I've seen threads where it states if you set a single button to both click and move the mouse that it violates the rules, but haven't been able to find any threads about this specifically. 
---
First on my HC, it's just balls without brews

I‚Äôve never been able to do it by sound. Stompy legs range, dangly legs mage

Personally I'd say arcane, arma is +6 for top+bottom and a bit of defence I think.

Arcane is prayer, defence, and accuracy.

You are so morally superior, I am sure everyone you know is so proud of you and all the women shower you with pussy.

I kind of like that RS used to have a bunch of aggros monsters that literally dropped nothing, just to add some fear to people's accounts. I kind of miss that at higher lvls
---
Just to explain what others have said - the website makes sure that yes, no, and skip votes are counted towards the 100% total, so they will all add up to 100%. The in-game display does not count skips towards the total, so just the yes and no votes will add up to 100%. 
---
For example, a vote split of 1 yes, 1 no, and 1 skip:  
---
    On the website, it would say 33% to all 
---
    On the in-game poll, it would say 50% to yes and no.
---
i love the idea of sandstone being used in place of buckets of sand. i do not like how the new rates are way higher than the current rates of getting sand. 
---
they should have discussed this with the community in more detail before rushing into a poll, crafting for ironmen is a VERY delicate thing to play around with due to the great benefits of training it IMO
---
Bet $70 in then in a CSGO match, lost, and never felt the same since.

&gt; When people rave about how much money they make from slayer, what exactly are they doing?

bullshitting, mostly. profit slayer is not that good.
---
But.....
---
Hiding means you can't physically see what's in the lead, this can lead to fixed votes.
---
But also, hiding stops people knowing what's winning and making people jump on the same band wagon.
---
I'm sure in most situations, the public like to know what the outcome looks like, for example government officials being elected.
---
If this gets hidden I bet in 5 years people will be demanding they see the poll results again for clarity.
---
One thing I find with Jagex games, everyone wants it one way and because of how much people change their minds, its best to leave some things to the mods.
---
This isn't crippling the game is it? I would prefer this time spent be used to kill off the bots and gold farmers more.

How about you look at crafting. How is making jewelry related to making leather . It's not too far fetched to look into merging runecrafting with warding . They're both creating stuff for magic . Runes and gear ...

Hahaha

Geez, you mad at something, didnt realize I would have to read a fucking essay for that comment. I was just saying it like how it was, and btw I used dragon darts for like 800 hydra kills I know the effectiveness of them

The quest in general is a big "fuck you" to the player. It doesn't fit into the world of runescape at all.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be a ‚Äúroon pouch‚Äù then?

Did you do anything weird before going into the fight, like keep a quest/skill guide open for a few minutes?

I also don‚Äôt give a modicum of a shit whether or not I‚Äôm ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in anyone‚Äôs eyes for saying so. If I did, why the fuck would I go in on a squad of hive mind racist closet monkeys when I‚Äôm clearly outnumbered?

God people in this game LOVE to cry and complain, and especially about shit that makes little sense to actually cry and complain THAT much about.

Gold selling isn't worth it for the amount of time you have to spend to get anywhere with it. Unless you own a site that handles bills daily, you're gonna be profiting 2-3 cents/m at the most. Even 2-3 cents is generous with the amount of people doing it.
---
Say you sell a billion a day at 3 cents profit/m - that's 30 usd a day. To get that you'd have to constantly search for sellers and then buyers which is really time consuming.
---
I mean the top level/gold sites are lucrative, but if you ask me you're better off putting that time into a degree/skill where you can make tons more long term. 
---
Because I'm still willing to do it with the current methods but would definitely welcome the removal of things that are needlessly inconvenient? How is that so hard to understand? And what's with the constant need of bringing up that we need affirmation? Did one too many ironmen embarrass your account with their's?
---
You already get seaweed faster than you can use it if you‚Äôre doing consistent runs. If we make sandstorm we turn a skill that actually requires time investment of material gathering to a skill you can bank 99 with next to no actual investment. We aren‚Äôt pushing for a way to get herbs faster than we can mix the potions, why push for crafting?
---

So it is primarily used for wilderness PvP? Basically to give yourself the damage of a max level player while being like 40 levels below in order to fight people that are weaker but the same level because they have a more even stat distribution?
---
And if so, what makes that worth it? Wouldn't you be incredibly fragile by not only having a super low defense level but also being unable to equip any high level armor?

I'd sell the bcp and try for DHCB, rigour, and anguish. Pegasians are good too. Skip augury for now. Fighters torso is good enough for Slayer, even proselyte chest is good. Being able to kill brutal black dragons and vorkath as Slayer tasks will help to build your bank

Given how these map clues treat distant buildings, the dock probably wouldn't be shown either way.

How does the armour set limit for the Armour case work? Some of the "sets" are things like a void helm, does that count towards the limit of 2 or 4 sets or are the helms "free" when you store rest of your void?

Likewise, each piece of Penance gear is it's own "set" does that mean with an oak armour case you could only store two pieces of it?

A question for those of you who have multiple accounts. I have been working on grinding fishing for a while now and was wondering if it would be against the rules to use an alt account as a runner so my main can stay at the fishing spot and grind xp. I know there exists this rule: "multi-logged accounts must not interact with each other to exploit gameplay mechanics, such as attempting to rig the result of a minigame." I would guess that this does not count as an exploitative activity but wanted to check and see if anyone has experience with this. I'd rather learn before I try it in case it is bannable.
---
Does anyone know what the bare minimum stats needed for killing the Tanglefoot are? I'm trying to stay 1 Str, but I've got 12 farming, Strength ammy, and a Strength pot. My plan has been to recoil him down to 1 and then try to get the last hit with the secateurs, but the wiki mentions something about not being able to hit if the amount of damage you would do is too low.

why did they even get that expensive? weren't they like 210 forever?

Why tho 
---
its use is to be dropped by people mining
---
People who say this are almost always people with little experience in BRs. Yes, sometimes you get fucked by not getting the gun when dropping, but the fact is in the long run, skilled players can and will win more because of their skill and knowledge of the game, not RNG. If BRs are truly dominated by RNG top players wouldn't have significantly higher win rates than the average player. 
---
Initial reaction was negative, but I really was persuaded by your argument.  Would vote yes in poll for sure.
---
Swamp trident? That's honestly perfectly fine. You don't need amazing gear for raids to start with. If you have a torso I'd recommend switching to a better budget setup once you get a few kc. We do raids discord has different budget setups
---
Big mad boi. It was a joke. I clearly said that on the post. "I was poking fun at the guy."
---
i like this idea because i feel the IM armor is useless after you get your first armor upgrade. then it just stays your bank the whole game and collects dust, good suggestion 
---
Yeah... I learned the hard way by burning out and taking a ~month break to play Overwatch around Easter-time last year.
---
Clearly.
---
230 is super efficient even if it is saving 30 seconds of time running.  You should be able to make 100k/hr easy as a new player.  Go spend an hour purely to make money and buy all the law runes you will need for weeks.
---
Also jewelry teleports are generally cheaper than law runes.  Look into using those when possible.  Stuff like ardy cloak and ectophial give free unlimited teleports and are fairly early game content.
---
Also don't do low level slayer. Go kill sand crabs until you can use a decent slayer master.  Early slayer tasks aren't just bad xp and gp, they are obnoxious with weird mechanics and obscure locations.  Slayer isn't a useful skill until higher levels, put it off for now.

Just as an example, let's say you want to make a plugin that prints your HP out when you have 10 or less. Runelite can provide a `get_hp()` function that your plugin can call without having to see the game code.

You say that but the best method for smithing is buying gold ore from a shop and then using it at blast furnace

Couldn't he use ectofuntus?

If they didn't think it would be used in that way, they did not intend it. One can't come without the other.

Except hte moron tried to call me out for not knowing how magic defense works when i specifically stated facing people with 1 def AND 1 mage. Meaning their base magic defense is absolute shit.
---
What glitch was that?

a step in the right direction is better then nothing...
---
You'd have to make it yourself.

Make spade drops noted please
---
I would but i have no idea how to even begin writing a plugin :/
---
New slayer master, new slayer boss which is better money per hour than Vorkath, but task only. Not much besides that and the Draynor dock.
---
Vorkath is still a viable option, though I believe Zulrah is more profitable. Personal opinion.
---
I said this on another post and got downvoted to shit because people acted like 2007 was 1998 with CRT monitors and dial up. 
---
Also kid had a flat screen lol you mean to tell me you got a flat screen monitor but dial up? We got DSL internet in 2001 i believe (maybe 2000 even) and tbh it was same price if not cheaper than dial up at the time. 
---
People act like xbox 360/ps3 and the HD revolution wasnt a thing back in 06/07 lmao. Not sure if they were to young to know about the *actual* struggles from the 90s, like using floppy's to boot up your PC and entering in the old command prompt to play whatever game you got. Now THATS old-school. 2006+ is not "oldschool" by any means lol.

get the early kills legit because if you die and lose it it's not as much work to get it back. The later ones are more stressful because if you die you have to get 8 kills again instead of only 2-3
---
if you bring a standard inventory to rune dragons, which is like 10 manta rays, a super combat potion and 1-2 prayer potions, that's AT MOST 40k / trip, generally far less. an entire inventory of JUST rune bars and dragon bones is at the very MINIMUM 200,000k, which means supply costs are at most less than 1/5th of the 'gross profit', and that's completely ignoring every other item the rune dragons drop than bars and bones
---
why are you so fucking mad lol

there was a shrek 3?

*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** Deanjks! ^(hug)

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, you say you are splashing over and over on 1 mage just because of black dhide when really you are probably splashing because they have high mage level and black dhide 
---
People still vote in 2019?
---
Except they dont you dipshit. I check their stats. 1 def 1 mage 1 pray black dhide is very common to face and i splash on it all the fucking time. Im not a moron.

A lot of people buy gold, doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it right but a huge part of the player base has purchased gold at one point. 
---
You won‚Äôt get banned for buying but if you sell there‚Äôs a higher likelihood you‚Äôll be banned. 
---
If you want to have some quick fun and quit, buy all the gold you want. If you‚Äôre planning on playing the game long term and enjoying it, then buy some starter gold (50mish) and then earn the rest via PvMing. 
---
Hopefully he gets banned.

I have not done any of the ghosts ahoy quests!

Found a pretty solid random money maker, about 150 for 40 minutes of work.  Definitely enough to buy some law runes.

Auto hot key, basically lets you press one button and have it instantly click 8 places for you, in this case it switches gear and weapon, clicks the special attack button, etc.

Would have to be at least...106k just to be the same. But again, it's like the Calquat. It takes up a different slot, fulfills a different role, and is still really worth it.

It doesn't just have to be items. Herblore and construction for raids &amp; pvm. Other skills like smithing &amp; prayer for diaries/maxing.

This is must be where they dumped all the extra green pixels from construction.

Just got it and read the scroll. What else is there to buy?

Eh it was around but yeah if you lived in town you probably had DSL 
---
Can also put ornate kits on things, reversible but makes you think twice about selling it
---
the privacyless booth makes me very uncomfortable and i cant figure out why. it seems... threatening...
---
Oh okay I was going to suggest buying plant cures from NPCs as a money maker, which I just realised you can also do in Catherby instead of Morytania, but it's probably about the same as what you're making now.

For raids? Dragon crossbow is fine and acb is a marginal improvement in accuracy.  For vorkath any crossbow that isn't dhcb is shit and you're better of blowpiping. 
---
Sorry if this is too stupid, but wouldn't those softwares for colorblindness, the ones that change everything your screen displays based on your profile, solve your problem?
---
I thought some games had built-in colorblind modes because real-time color correction can be really taxing and make intensive games unplayable on low-end machines.

I think OPs point is that mage is not viable as a main combat style vs range or melee. Which is pretty true, its not other than maybe a low level fire surge SOTD pure hitting 45s and stacking venom, and even then though they're more likely to just tele when they use their spec/out of combo food so the only KO potential is when you got a full venom stack and thats if they dont bring antis. 
---
However OP..mage is not supposed to be used as a main combat style for pking, especially if youre only 82 mage. Using blitz is used to just freeze or stack someone. Also youre exaggerating quite a bit saying you splash on full rune..or even 1 mage/1 def pures using d hide chaps. Sounds like youre not using proper mage attack bonus gear yourself if thats the case. 
---
I would try switching up the wording in your post if your point is that for main combat mage under performs..because THAT is true. And its been brought up before for PvM too, because outside of bursting tasks mage isnt ever used as a main combat attack for bosses/etc. Pking is different though and there isnt really a way to buff mage to make it viable enough to use as your main style because it would become OP in hybrid situations..so the only method would be nerfing range and melee, and that wont happen. (Range could use a slight nerf though, that i agree). 
---
Also d hide has been brought up too and those stats may be changed sometime soon to give less mage defense. But seriously, you shouldnt be trying to pk with just ice blitz as your main attack anyways...it was never meant to be used that way. So I'm still sort of confused about your post OP. Because like i said youre certainly exaggerating about the splashing, OR you are using like +1 magic attack bonus worth of gear.

Sir Pookaguy, there might be something wrong with your PAQ formula. cause if you divide by attack speed, the higher the attack speed, the lower the PAQ, which doesnt make sense   
---
I love this series by the way, you keep doing you! goodluck!!
---
Yeah as an ironmeme I'm super excited for this update but I definitely don't agree with OP. There's plenty of tasks in the game that don't yield direct exp that irons do to bank exp that are totally fine. I spent a large chunk of my day today running back and forth from my house and Rimmington to turn 10k teaks into planks. Part of being an iron is understanding that you're going to have to do some crap work to be self-sufficient.

You mean Jebrim?
---
&gt; I don't see why any skill needs to be boosted above 70k per hour
---
Then we simply want to play vastly different games. Personally, I don't think any skill should be *below* 100k xp/hr as the maximum rate (whether that be achieved through being very expensive, tick manipulation, lots of effort, or whatever else you want to use).
---
Oh relax you sally. You have the most important item already so quit your complaining. I know people who have gone 3k+ dry of tanzanite fang 
---
Before they're fired. Some specific NPCs have it coded as just before impact but those are usually Raid bosses.
---
Vast majority of scenarios it's just before casting/shooting the arrow. Pretty sure there are some exceptions in raids 2 but anywhere else it's as the projectile is shot. 
---
Yikes Reddit English lessons. Did the older kids at your school give you a hard time??
---
please delet this comment from my reddit page RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!1

no the point is that why are they doing it like this where it seems like the poll isnt passing when youre looking the results trough website which most players would do who cant be asked to vote and for them this seems like no pass on fast glance because who is actually gonna calculate what the actual percentage is it should be displayed correctly on the website too
---
You could claim infinite free 5kg (IIRC) sandstone pieces in the temple right next to the camulet teleport. You were able to collect an inventory worth, bank it, and return in a matter of seconds.
---
U got a little kids computer 
---
K how bout no and they leave it alone
---
Just to clarify, whatever I'm flicking (overheads, rigor, whatever), I should always do just before the attack animation goes off? I guess that makes sense, but I would have figured that I should flick on my overhead right before a spell or projectile displays a hit marker. Just seems a little odd to flick it several seconds early.
---
Yes 
---
I found training on Hill Giants a really good early way of making money. Since you‚Äôre an Iron man you can‚Äôt really sell the drops but the variety of stuff you get would surely help you. 
---
They drop quite a few law runes to stock up on to start with as well as giant keys, ogre heads and decent herbs. Pretty short run to the bank as well with the brass key.

&gt;acutally this is against the rules, its boosting/Realworld trading I received a 14 day ban for it last month

Fair enough. You don't have to believe me and that's fair. Just like I don't have to believe that a majority of our playerbase is 20-30 year olds. 
---
At the end of the day age doesn't equal maturity. Being a certain age shouldn't give you the "right" to vote on OSRS. Having an account of a certain age, quest point, total level, boss kills.. something that actually matters in game, that should affect your "Right" to vote.

Yeah. No. They don't.

If you're learning, less switches so you can focus on zulrah's phases more. I would recommend using void range + mage, blowpipe + trident of seas/swamp, device + mage cape (3 way switch) with a ring of suff (i) (where ur 20m will go).

Consider this: a birdhouse run takes 2 minutes so that means the theoretical hourly rate is &lt;\~30 runs if you didn't have to wait. Wiki says the average is 8 nests per run for yew birdhouses. If each nest sells comfortably at 2.5k, your runs have a 20k average without any seeds, and that's 600k an hour. (relative to time invested) I don't know what % of nests have seeds in them but we have estimates of what type of seed you might get:
---
[https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird\_nest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Bird_nest)
---
In about 11% of cases you'd get a seed worth at least 50k. Let's say if 1/10 nests have a seed in them, that's still 2-3 good seeds every 30 runs, giving a hefty bump to your gp/hr. Not bad for a tier 60 activity I think.

Oh geez yeah I should probably do mage arena huh. I pretty much only have full god dhide, barrows, and a fury. Okay, I will take the advice and go grind out the mage cape, buy an occult, blowpipe, and trident, get a couple more mil and buy a ring of suff, and grind out a void set. Thanks!

minnows would likely be less bannable, I had one drop pattern hard coded which I assume is what got me banned, It would randomly pick a location on the fish to shift drop but other than that it was the same pattern every time. If i started working on it again My last idea to improve "antiban" was create a larger pool of dropping styles and weigh them.

Yes I've been on 153ms ping from NZ to Australian servers for the past few weeks. Usually I get 30ms when all is well but it is pretty hit or miss and can be poor for quite a few weeks at a time (as is now).

The Major Divisions of the Human Race
---
Most anthropologists recognize 3 or 4 basic races of man in existence today. These races can be further subdivided into as many as 30 subgroups.
---
Ethnographic division into races from Meyers Konversationslexikon of 1885-90 is listing:
---
Caucasian races (Aryans, Hamites, Semites)
---
Mongolian races (northern Mongolian, Chinese and Indo-Chinese, Japanese and Korean, Tibetan, Malayan, Polynesian, Maori, Micronesian, Eskimo, American Indian),
---
Negroid races (African, Hottentots, Melanesians/Papua, ‚ÄúNegrito‚Äù, Australian Aborigine, Dravidians, Sinhalese)
---
Dumbass.
---
Cool huh

Agree. It makes more sense. I‚Äôm 99 craft on iron and I don‚Äôt think people should have to go through 60h of sand collecting for 99.
---
On the other hand, it shouldn‚Äôt be a buff that is 6x the rate of current sand just because it‚Äôs ‚ÄúQOL month‚Äù. Something around 3-4K sand an hour sounds reasonable (~300-400k exp banked/h - napkin maths). 
---
If players are offered a huge buff to a tedious skilling method, it‚Äôs obviously going to pass. What we should be asking is - what is it going to be next? Maybe 99 craft is ‚Äòdevalued‚Äô, maybe rightly so, but is the game mode going to be constantly devalued over time because.. ‚ÄòQOL‚Äô?

Very few people were ever actually afraid of/against "ezscape".

You can do that without being ironman you absolute moron. Infact, you can choose to just buy sand because you hate that aspect of ironman mode that doesnt mean you should ruin the entire gamemode because youre lazy lmfao.
---
Shit I guess I'll actually have to do the research.  I hope you speak the truth Cowslayer877723!
---
My /r/2007scape locked ultimate iron meme
---
Shopman mode is garbage.
---
Yet blast furnace shop goes unchecked poll after poll.
---
Every ironman literally buys a full fucking skill to 99 from that shop (smithing).

My bwana my bwana (my bwo wannai bwana)

doesn‚Äôt it also make sense that a 1 def account can where blessed chaps? lol i dono shits wack

Can't imagine how Green Cape is going to revive the series but we gotta hope.

To be fair in context everyone was spamming the message. He ignored them all and finally gave in to read it so people would stop spamming it.

Does (ultra)compost increase the yield of limpwurt patches?
---
You sound like the male version of Alinity.
---
the "glitch spots" is just really like marking a square or having the memory of around which corners can be safespoted and from which direction. that's just how pathing and targeting work in osrs. however that autoclicking shit is not good for the integrity of osrs. I killed Zulrah thousnands of times, and it forced me to learn how to swap gear and prayer. but I think if this ahk bullshit is used there (which I doubt it isn't.) then it totally devalues the actually experience of learning to click and actually switch gear/prayer. also I don't see it in the video but I could imagine this could be used for Pneck-&gt;manta-&gt;brew-&gt;kawamabwam which is bullshit to be done in less then a blink of an eye.
---
Well that's the point.. it's a famously brief tragedy and I'm saying this guy had a similarly famous brief hypocrisy
---
Im 4/2100 with a 900 dry streak so yeah
---
The massacre guy
---
Yeah cause osrs is a static game with no updates. If you‚Äôre so much better, just apply to join the marketing team yourself. :)

Robin hood and 3a body in 33 clues?? Damn
---
Gz man
---
5th clue 3a, 6th clue robin -.-
---
Definitely would buy one without a Max lvl
---
All I see is QWOP
---
&gt; youre stopping them from playing the game they payed for.
---
No.. They do that themselves.. By breaking the rules they agreed to when making the account
---
It‚Äôs still 1:1 though which is legal. You can‚Äôt bind 2 or more actions to a single key but it is okay to bind the same single action to multiple keys.
---
What do you use to draw the chunk edges in to the world? Is it a Runelite plugin?
---
Was a pretty fun grind, and interesting results!
---
ok bwawner
---
I personally just house tele but i like this method better now thanks.
---
agreed
---
I'd consider it painfully annoying.
---
For me, mobile is a way to play casually when out of home, any "serious" gaming is done on pc.
---
Yes. 
---
Can confirm my 3 year old cousin spens around $1k on laptops all the time for Minecraft.

If you already have best gear

Hey guys I'm new at this game! I'm giving it a try and it's quite a blast! (Please guys don't lynch me but I just don't really have no clue about this game)
---
I was wondering whether it was possible and in which point/level I can become a knight.
---
I saw some players wearing a knight armor, I'm really looking forward it. I fell in love!
---
Not wanting to get carpal tunnel is EZSCAPE
---
You misunderstand my question. I didn't ask if it was legal, as im aware it "technically" fits the rules. I asked if people were ok with it.
---
Ask any Osu player in existence if KB/M is easier than Mouseonly at high level play and your answer would be "no duh". Ask any competitive gamer in existence if using a 3rd party app to double your inputs under a technicality is gaming the system and the answer would be "no shit". I'm not asking if its cheating, I'm aware its "legal". I'm asking if people think its fair.
---
nice witchhunt
---
no konar doesn't assign dks
---
Going to attempt fight caves for the first time when i manage to get a task - wondering if i should be using a cbow or blowpipe for my first try, as i have been reading alot of conflicting statements
---
It's a mechanic lol, jagex allow it to happen because of their shit decisions with code
---
We pay we say we need this merch
---
I really like the idea of taking your graceful into the wilderness to dye it black. Will hopefully make it an uncommon colour to see around if people have to risk the full set by taking it into the wildy.
---
Finally a birth control thats 100% 
---
Love it
---
Alot
---
Can I get out of the loop for swampletics? I keep seeing it everywhere 
---
As a pker I would prefer the devs add a slider for item drag sensitivity. But until then I'll continue to use my non-drag AHK script.
---
Is it worth getting a Fighters torso? I've got 67 def, 74 str and 70 att. I've also never done it before, how long does it take? Currently using Granite body. 
---
Report your bot, wait to see if if it's banned, change one little thing, report your bot again, wait to see if that bans it, change another thing, repeat. 
---
If you have runelite add a note to his name, he can changed 45 times and you'll still know it is him
---
Or British...
---
Yes, they degrade whenever you're in combat.
---
Was in rs3, they are cosmetic at best :(
---
Cammy or edge is closer to a bank 
---
It's possible to get 500 points without fletching, but if you're having issues hitting that 500 point mark then yes.
---
Scroll down , you'll see this post 45 times
---
What is ahk?
---
Oh damn my bad! 
---
Ive done it tons of times, for example hop a world into aggro monsters and you cant hope until out of combat.
---
You can also simply misclick when hopping or not see the person.
---
There's a guy ingame name 'big chunkus' who's doing the same as you.
---
No they don‚Äôt. That depends entirely on where you‚Äôre from. Exit polls by definition mean asking people what they voted.
---
Banning them from being published was only added later in certain countries.
---
cmonüÖ±Ô∏èruh, chu mean üÖ±Ô∏èwano

You really fucked this one up lad
---
Anywhere from like 1-2 hours to 5-10, it all depends on how fast you get a queen kill and how fast you get the points. If you can find semi-reliant people to play with it should go fairly fast. Also look up a guide on the basics, don't be *that* guy.
---
We pay we gay 
---
Pretty sure you can't get a Jad task until you've killed Jad once already, tho I may be wrong.
---
Definitely blowpipe. If you're worried about the healers then you can bring a crystal bow or something to tag them with (so you don't try to attack them with blowpipe and get pulled into Jad's melee range) but blowpipe is going to make the waves a lot faster, and make Jad faster (meaning less time to miss a prayer swap and die)
---
Well if every large (social) media outlet publishes them you can‚Äôt really get around them eh?
---
Blowpipe. Saves you food and prayer.
---
I used to use garry's hood for years and nothing ever happened.
---
every time people complain about "toxic pkers" I think of people like this
---
Why can't be hold a key and drag items? If it's because his script only sends a 1ms click for each key pressed, then that is no longer 1:1. He is automating the removal of his finger from each key, which is in itself an action. This is the reason you can bind 4 keys to clicking in a game like osu! Without incredible clicking precision (only seen one person every pull it off well). 
---
Minority. The fact it is the minority is pretty funny.
---
Do you get 50 fps easy ? With Runelite ?
---
You can remove the poison with a cleaning cloth to make them regular hasta's again. Atleast these sell on GE. (for a lot less money tho) I think +-150-200k each.  
---
Yesterday I bought 9Mil worth of hasta (p) and (p+) from a dude, he only sold it for 1Mil. Ofcourse they didn't sell, so I figured they might have a better chance of selling once the poison is removed. Which  they did. I made 1Mil profit out of it.  
---
These would be nicer without the symbols!
---
Yes ofcourse, the only game it cant run smoothly is apex legends at the moment because its heavily gpu ram based and needs optimisation
---
Wow youre so cool!
---
I don't see why it's a problem. This isn't osu where it makes a massive difference, and it takes ages to get this good with it anyway and everyone has the same tools available to them. It's not like private client mods. 
---
Treat the hinges of this laptop with care. I have the same one and I didn't realise how fragile they are. It's now basically a desktop. :(
---
I want my achievement diary hoodie :'(
---
Was more of a humor post, flaired it wrong
---
To my memory you wrote exploit and changed it after, however the word manipulate still pretty much defines exactly what you're saying it doesn't, but it doesn't matter because I was mostly just being pedantic for the sake of it 
---
how is "CSGOIsFknGay" offensive lmfao
---
Legends cape is awesome for doing PvM in the wilderness. You add 700gp to your risk, and get some solid defensive stats out of it. 
---
It shrinks so you can't wear it until you do the quest of course. 
---
What? It‚Äôs what the quest says this isn‚Äôt edited. 
---
It‚Äôs a muffled laugh btw. 
---
Please I need this 
---
I'll get researching BA then! Any tips off the bat? 
---
Personally, I'm not offended, but its using gay as an insult, if you dont think thats offensive to anyone you're probably retarded.
---
Crash him for his name 
---
Not fair to compare insane btws with pvmers
---
It's the only fair way
---
After a while you see through the cracks
---
Nice. What's the real value?
---
Slayer and QP are fire. AND RC too
---
Yellow cape will be the redemption arc
---
Osrs isnt racist, these particular people playing osrs are racist.
---
with the serpentine helmet getting the str bonus buff, would it be better now to use instead is neitiznot?
---
I'm excited to see how he gets Legends Cape without leaving morytania, but that's the arc I'm most excited for.
---
Well, I am not sure how realistic it is to turn Sandstone into glass-grade Sand. It isn't uncommon for things to share a word without being directly related, like Dragons, Dragon Equipment, and Dragonfruit all use "Dragon".
---
But even if it doesn't make real sense, it makes RuneScape sense. And it is always nice to see a skillless resource gained through a skill. Like how Snape Grass was just picked up off the floor and now it can also be gathered with Farming. It is also nice to see it provide more use to older content instead of just adding new content like a Spell to do it for you.
---
The woodcutting one is the one I like most. Suttle enough that you could just say you love camping/nature/the environment or whatever and the colours aren't too garish. 
---
I like how you guys dont see the connection between my reddit name and ingame name.
---
More people need to understand this
---
Hey guys im fairly new got a question about void set. What is it used for and is it worth grinding for? 
---
Interesting. I knew this post wouldn't be received well by some people.
---
shit man please dont hack me
---
Bad bot
---
I'm red/green colourblind. It's hard to explain which colours would be better for me though
---
Personally, I'm not offended, but its using retarded as an insult, if you dont think thats offensive to anyone you're probably gay.
---
Yea. Even if it wasn‚Äôt RuneScape related it‚Äôd still castrate everyone wearing it
---
Fletching is just making bows and ammo. Herblore is just mixing potions. Do they both need minigames too? I also play 1-3 hours a day MAYBE and have 2+k total and very much enjoy the game. I know this is gonna sound crazy but you can progress in the regular game on one to two hours a day if you don't just bankstand. It takes longer on an Ironman but they chose that play style so...
---
Hear hear. 
---
The only thing truly worthwhile in this game is the journey. The game doesn't get any better or more exciting because you have a 99, or because you can do Raids, or hell, even if you're maxed. Did the game change for you when you got a Fire Cape, or when you got Barrows Gloves? You have more money and you're stronger, but the gameplay loop never changes. Making things faster and more brainless and catering towards people who want to skip the journey will lead OSRS to a slow death. They don't understand that the delayed gratification after the long journey is the game. 
---
For something to be a worthwhile accomplishment, it needs to be long. It needs to be tough. If any super-normie playing here and there on their phone while they play other games can get it, what are those achievements worth anymore? There's a reason no one respects 99 Cooking, because you can get it in a week and while watching Netflix. It's not a satisfying thing to get because you didn't work for it, and it's not something you're going to be proud of. 
---
Catering towards casuals and trying to make the game accessible for the widest possible audience is bad for the game, because it makes everyones achievements worth less. To make the end-game more accessible, the journey has to be easier, more AFK, more brainless so that even the gamer dad with 1 hour a week to play and do Raids too.  Nobody wins in this scenario. Sure, you "catch up" in the short-term, but long-term you realise that the game isn't much different when you reach a milestone, and all you've helped facilitate is a game where achievements feel hollow, for everyone. 
---
What happens if I never take it off?
---
What is your go-to activity to afk? I started an HCIM and I'm currently at WT. I have a main, that I want to do some afking on, preferably with some profit, while playing on the HCIM. I was thinking of MLM, fly fishing or monkfish. What could also be a decent afk activity?
---
hmm this page went from number 3 at top of osrs hot topics to completely off of it instantly... seems like jagex wants to brush this under the rug. Sad times that we live in. 
---
Personally I think wintertodt is to strong, it went from the skill  being a buyable to profitable while maintaining very good xp rates and being some what afk. Firemaking was an easy grind before and to me was more interesting than afking at wintertodt. Not saying this to change anyones opinion but just to say some people don't say this sort of thing because you get down voted into oblivion. I also think zeah rc made the skill to easy personally, and I don't feel it needs any updates. 
---
Who are you responding to?
---
I‚Äôm sorry lmao but even just the thought of seeing someone wearing one of these made me cringe so hard my dick inverted. Pls don‚Äôt 
---
Birth Control Lv: 120 
---
Sounded more like  teef (teath) hurt to me lmao
---
you mean to tell me that the small village being the ONLY place that can transport you to a far away continent makes more sense than the largest port in runescape? That's the equivalent of building an international airport in the middle of the rural countryside 2 hours outside of a major city.
---
&gt; Of course 90% of people will hit YES on the "Should we make X easier" questions. 
---
But if they're ignorant, then how would they even know that makes it easier? I think bandwagoning is a bigger issue. Obviously some people who know what they're voting on might vote on something because it makes things easier, but...
---
&gt; they really have no idea what's best for the game 
---
... isn't this really a matter of opinion? That's why you're allowed to vote no. Your opinion is just a minority in this case, is all.
---
Lol, how is this racist?
---
Probably within their right and ability to claim an unlicensed use of copyrighted material on the old Wikia
---
Because it's a change that largely only effects ironmen and glass blowing wasn't designed around them. No main will spend any time picking up sand. If glassblowing was introduced today they wouldn't have the optimal method be world hopping at charter ships or filling buckets at a sand pit. 
---
You're expecting the Runescape community to actually understand changes before voting them in
---
Why don't people say Hunting or Slaying instead of Hunter or Slayer
---
&gt; doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is a pussy 
---
&gt; those pussys who actually want to get pussy
---
Topkek 
---
Whoa dude, this is /r/2007scape not /r/accountabilityscape 
---
You forgot to mention that 61 to 99 crafting while sitting at the giant seaweed island is the best way to get the farming pet. 
---
It's actually supposed to spell out "teef hurt"
---
Bro that first paragraph. 
---
Cunts literally stand in 1 spot and mine granite for 300 hours and it never depletes. Pointless. 
---
Being a pure/zerker really sucks in this case 
---
No free rc exp üòî
---
yesssssir
---
Yeah, it's so much more detailed than the cinematic feature
---
I autoclicked to 99 magic a month ago in 10 days orso. Left it on for over 10 hours a day for a couple of days
---
Galvek is easy af. You only need to move and reactivate prayers a few times
---
look on crystalmath labs for his username dumbass. not hard to check.
---
The chat sums up the dutch rs community l0l
---
If your talking about interrupting someone by giving them a big pp, then it would take some serious planning or luck, cause of username lengths. But if your asking if you can give yourself a big pp then I don‚Äôt see why not.
---
Quickly go do slayer before your super att and str pots wear off
---
* Will +2 Strength give you an extra max hit? If yes, wear it.
---
* Do you need anti-venom? If yes, wear it.
---
* Do you need extra Defence? If, yes wear it.
---
If no to all of the above, Helm of Neitiznot. The Helm of Neitiznot still has its uses for Prayer and non-degradable use.
---
My Bwana...
---
Like real time machine learning on 100,000 accounts at once? Seems computationally easy... Lol
---
Why should ironmen stick to stupid methods that add nothing to the game when they can recycle pretty much dead content and make it a viable method of earning resources. 
---
jad is so much easier lol
---
The new method will be 7-8k an hr my dude
---
I like the look of Legends cape and it has at least some prestige compared to the obby cape. I could afford an obby cape but I just like Legend's cape more so I'm happy to sacrifice max efficiencyscape for a bit of fashionscape.
---
Some even hook directly to the official client.
---
I wouldn't wear one outside but I might get a larger size and wear it at home.
---
Dude if you wanna waste time filling buckets KEEP DOING IT. THE REST OF US WILL USE SANDSTONE.  Fuck you
---
&gt;Low level noobs are calling for harmful updates that pander to them
---
Such as? If you're going to mention the update to how players collect sand, then I'm sure as hell not going to take you serious.
---
Yeah I took it as him exaggerating a point but he very well may be all for grindy for the sake of it
---
Snitch 
---
This change isn't being done to save time. It's being done because the experience is shit no matter how long you're doing it. Hopping worlds at merchants should not be part of this game. 
---
Not sure, but now that I think about it, why is Crafting called Crafting, but Runecraft isn't called Runecrafting.
---
&gt; later on in later chunks it may be just going from chUnk to chunk until something pops up.
---
I think this is what makes it so interesting. You'll never know how long he'll have to stay in a chunk. Maybe one time he'll be stuck having to grind for a chunk for days (or even weeks), while for another set of chunks he'll literally breeze through several in a row instantly. 
---
That poll got fucked because they added the coif into the mix. 
---
Yea they definitely don't ban with 100% certainty. My UIM got banned because my VPN disconnected and my IP changed. It was a major macro ban which got removed a day later when I talked to the cheating specialists 
---
That‚Äôs what my main has. Allows for better low level action in revs and allows you to use basically everything in the game. 
---
Ever since ez scape rs3 updates you can very easily get unlimited giant seaweed by afking on fossil island.
---
Super glass make is really quick, and while blowing the glass is the bulk of the grind its super afk so people don't mind crafting when getting to that point
---
More realistically its a 200% buff to ironman crafting exp rates.
---
When I did all the quests for the cape I was more focused on speed than reading the story. I hate questing haha. I just wanted it to be over.
---
Hire this man
---
What‚Äôs your medium clue count on this pic? I‚Äôm on the ranger boots hunt too, dreading wizzys or sandals 
---
I don't see this at all. I agree it is a bandaid fix, but a bandaid fix in the other direction than you are complaining about. It is less dps everywhere, and has no utility. It doesn't make an OSRS player happy that they have a combat style vaguely similar to what they like, it makes them sad that it is so underpowered everywhere compared to EoC. EoC has continued to progress since legacy has been released, with bosses like Telos, AoD, and Solak being very popular and well received.
---
I'd probably buy cooking just because I've gotten it 3 times now. 
---
1) QOL means quality of life. A significant buff to exp rates it not quality of life, it's a buff and power creep.
---
2) OSRS has historically been about more options and *not* faster options. These changes are the equivalent of players asking to share our toys - which we're happy to do - but you break the toy, change it into something we don't like and then tell us "if you don't like it stop playing with the toy". Your attitude is fucking pathetic and is exactly why RS3 became the way it is by wanting everything and wanting it now - perhaps you'd be better off there.
---
I'm actually on the east coast and get better ping from UK worlds than US worlds a lot of the time. So yes this exactly.
---
Well mapping down an existing farming patch should be a lot easier than any of the things mentioned since all them require rewriting or engine work. But I think Herb Patches should be in no rush to enter double digits...
---
&gt; just everyone to go through bad content because it's grindy and that's the only measure that matters to them. 
---
shit its like you described what runescape is all about 
---
That is absolutely not his point. People hate chaters on ironman (75-85k xp/h ish) farming and filling buckets is like 10k below that but is more interactive gameplay. I am going to finish my charters on that 85k since I prefer it more if you want to know my perspective. If crafting with farming with sandstone and seeds is 100k/h max id be down with it. But hearing rates makes it seem way higher and I think its just too much. Ironman mode is stupidly easy already imo
---
Yea I dunno how my delicate virgin frame would fare against fire and grenades, I'd rather the marine corps did it
---
i'm sure that they will care when pvp completely dies and they become irrelevant again. That will be the future if they don't address this issue, btw guy still isn't banned.
---
It's only 40 but I believe that that was my chance on the table for along time.
---
Because English the the Way of the people and grammictly no one likes to use hunting and slaying in that context. (No idea was just being a smart ass didn't expect a real reply.)
---
The most goodest boii
---
Yes so make farming and sand higher than the 80k of charters, make it 90k. Not 130k 
---
But that is just wrong, if you actually look up the new rates, charter is still faster. You are exaggerating this too much. Do you even play ironman?
---
Love how you twist him saying something small like collecting sand should be changed and him mocking those who don't into implying he is saying that achievements should be devalued or people should be given 200M when starting out the game as if they're the same.
---
No wonder why folks don't take you serious anymore.
---
Ah ok yeah I‚Äôm about 80 in nothing yet. Yes unfortunately that‚Äôs a pretty rare roll you got there but you never truly know :) best of luck
---
When legacy was introduced they sold it under the lie that it wouldn't affect EoC. It completely changed the system and hit chance calculators - turned EoC into splash scape and is why you need an aura for everything to play the game. Not to mention the horrible affect it had on the PvP meta.
---
It should be removed, completely out of place.
---
I'm pretty sure that the fastest FM Methods are still burning the logs in the old way and that Redwood logs are much, much faster than Wintertodt. Pretty sure WT level 90 is roughly 300k and Redwoods 500k xp/h. 
---
So WT is exactly want you described. Slower but more afk and profitable. I do think at release WT was op but since the nerfs it's a fun and rewarding alternative to the old FM, which was probably the worst skill in the game. It wasn't joked about as much as Agility/RC solely because of its speed.
---
Thank you for the "obnoxious" concept and the enjoyable content! I love the idea of this and how much thought is being put into it. I was already interested after the first episode, I found it enjoyable watching you figure out how to go about making the rules on the fly. 
---
Then after watching the intro to episode 2, I was hooked. Coming up with rules that are more concrete, the spreadsheet, the PAQ formula. It really shows that time and effort are being put into the series for the sake of having fun in a very unconventional, very obnoxious, and very interesting way.
---
I hope it is as enjoyable creating this content as it is to watch and continues to be a series all the way to the full exploration of Gielinor.
---
Fuck sandstorm. I want a rc update, not for crafting to be easier.
---
You aren‚Äôt the norm when it comes to the player base. That‚Äôs the problem. Your opinion is noted, but most people our age (like myself) have other shit going on. You don‚Äôt end up in the situation that you are in within osrs if that‚Äôs the case for you too. Sprinkle in the gym, cooking, friends, family a spouse, hobby, and even kids, you don‚Äôt get to where you are in the game currently. *That‚Äôs what the counter- argument is here*. 
---
You cater games to the player base and demographic. It‚Äôs no longer high school and college grinders. It‚Äôs not twenty-something‚Äôs that spend every second of their free time grinding either. Your anecdote doesn‚Äôt change that. 
---
Real
---
Imagine caring about a dock location.
---
bet that deer wished it has some knuckles to give that bird a fight
---
Wintertodt was a great great example?
---
That's how you know the reddit community fucking retarded. Wintertodt turned a high click intensity skill that only lost money into a afk skill that made money and still retained high exp rates of burning logs. All because jagex was too stupid and lazy to come up with an actual solution for the skill.
---
Go play rs3 with legacy because that's all you dipshits actually want.
---
I'm fine with it if it didnt increase exp/hr by 3x lmao
---
I‚Äôm always scrambling to make rc my lowest skill right before I do ToG!
---
A contraceptive to surpass carrying a Nintendo Switch around with me
---
How about adding a couple of "Filthy Casual" servers with 2x XP rates? (Would require separate accounts like DMM)
---
Busy ppl should be satisfied, neckbeards could just frown upon them for playing on ezscape worlds.
---
Who would lose?
---
How about we get actually hooded skillcapes in the game ? Eh?
---
That's fine with me, although I don't mind either way. 
---
That‚Äôs a bizarre attitude. Why do anything in life now, the future might have an easier way to do it?
---
Good shit. Mine was 96 minutes my first time, just did it on my ironman and took me 156 minutes lmao. Gz
---
are you high ? more effort should always result in better xp rates not vice versa 
---
As much as this would be good for many players, I don't want to imagine how much dev time this would take - i'm sure it would be difficult
---
Man it may be worth considering haveing a serious consultation with yourself.  I feel like a lot of people just say "eh it's just RuneScape" when they think about their staking addiction, or maybe they don't really even think about it at all. But the fact is, gambling is gambling. It's all the same.
---
Youve shown yourself there mind and body
---
Yeah haha I live here
---
I agree (apart from telling people who are unhappy with exp rates to "go play rs3"; it is actually a very different game so while you would progress faster you may not enjoy the rest of the content as much as on oldschool), there seems to be a certain subset of players who feel like they should be entitled to fast-tracking their way to a max cape because they've got more going on in their life. If the only justification for increasing exp rates is "it's going to take me too long" while thousands of other players are chugging along just fine, the problem isn't the exp rate, the problem is that you're playing a game that you're spending your limited free time doing things you don't enjoy.      
---
If you don't like working toward a long term goal, don't aim for a long term goal. Outside of a brief dopamine rush, you're not going to suddenly have more fun once you're there.

Because runecraft is a noun and runecrafting is a verb. You can reply easier to ppl asking wyd with it in verb form

Thank you for a natives perspective! I thought the issue was that polls did not influence the changes and that the votes were manipulated to give the illusion of choice. My mistake
---
Wouldn‚Äôt he just not get it then? Does he need it?
---
Surprised you went for these items lol.  I bought like 30 bulwarks because I thought jagex would give us the promised "tank mechanic" in ToB, which would make sense since justiciar was on the drop table.  Ended up losing a solid 300M
---
I just laugh and write look idiot I had a clue, a spade and a dragon dagger to spec out the clue guy.
---
They don't know how to fight monsters so they need some xp on clue hunters maybe
---
Legacy isn't good, but you can use revolution++ which automatically fires off all your abilities.
---
You can do most bosses with it, excluding maybe telos and raids, but even then you can just use normal revolution (doesn't fire off ultimate or threshold abilities) and still do those bosses.
---
The fact that this is 25% downvoted is very concerning.
---
The rates are nowhere near that high. 
---
&gt; If you want to progress slowly there is Runescape classic
---
Didn't that close like a year ago? Anyway, when it comes to increasing Exp Rates the important question is "why". If it is a higher req method that requires more effort, then a 5K exp increase isn't unreasonable. But if it is just raising the exp by 5K per hour for the sake of raising the exp, then that is more questionable.
---
I think a good example of increased Exp Rates is Agility. Rooftops may have done a bit more than needed in the upper level, but since then its been pretty well designed. Methods like Brimhaven, Mermaid, and Werewolf all pushed the exp rates but getting those high rates is a lot harder than doing Ardy. But if they were to offer something like Ardy but 10K more exp, that is the not as good kind of exp buffs.
---
Tbh PvM community is much more toxic.  Anyone reading this who thinks otherwise try and join a pk clan and then a high lvl pvm clan.
---
Shouldn't he have not been able to continue raking when he realized he shouldn't have unlocked that second chunk? I'm not upset because it's such a long boring grind but it feels weird since he stated that he ruined his account by going over there but then kept going over there.

I mentioned that, but thanks.

I'm not bragging about 1b. I'm just saying when you have that much a 20m drop doesn't mean as much as if you had only 10m total
---
Doctors hate him for this 1 simple trick

Can't wait to see you get downvoted as usual for speaking the truth.

I just use synapse to rebind F keys to QWER and use the macro key on the side of the keyboard to change synapse profile so I can switch to normal layout if I need to type. 
---
But yes, rebinding in original client would be very usefull in game
---
It wasn't funny 8 months ago, and it's still shit. 
---
I'm one of Konar's slaves, unfortunately.  Thanks for the input tho &lt;3
---
Yes i do. 
---
Well I thought about lowering xp, and increasing speed of cooking/fletching, which would cause resource sink while maintaining similar xp/h
---
The 3rd party website most definitely just presses the skill icons on. 
---
I can add them in for next month (or whoever does next months)
---
&gt; You do understand that "enjoying skilling", that is, "enjoying doing a repetitive action over and over over the course of months" is synonymous with mental disease?
---
No I didnt know that, thanks for telling me, perhaps you could direct me to some of the literature on the matter. I will happily read it.
---
&gt; Skilling was never the objective of runescape, it was a means to an end. 
---
What is the objective of Runescape? (I can already tell that youre not very familiar with the game)
---
&gt; I honestly hope every skilling achievement of yours gets devalued to the point that you realize how much of your life you've wasted.
---
I know you do. Youre a very destructive person which is a sign of mental illness, if you werent trolling on reddit youd probably be taking your illness out on someone irl.
---
&gt; Claiming you're good at the game because you have spent a long time skilling is the equivalent of saying you're a good philosopher because you read a lot of philosophy books.
---
Nope, thats fallacious. If youve read a lot of philosophy books you will be extremely well read on the subject of philosophy. If youve read a lot of Runescape lore you will be very well read on Runescape lore. If you play a lot of Runescape you will be better at Runescape (unless you just sit there and afk all day because you like having it easy then youre obviously going nowhere). If you play a lot of soccer you will be better at soccer.
---
I made a client that did this, alongside binding gear switches to keys too. Got banned for botting. 
---
I was thinking the same thing! Colorful shit is in right now. Look at champion or supreme 
---
Fucking normies, let's be real, you must be an absolute unit with chad level confidence to wear one.
---
You can get much higher casts/hour than 360. I've been averaging around 550 (without picking up of course) with some space for improvement, which would make this a crazy rate at ~570 kXP/h!
---
2 ultimates should dm at the end of their goals to finish the series

This video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw3jnPW2\_QY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw3jnPW2_QY) gives a pretty good explanation on what you are asking, but I will answer your specific question.  
---
AHK is auto hot key, which makes it so you can program keys on your keyboard to do other actions. So for instance I could program 2 on my numpad to move the mouse down a certain amount, or other things like that. AHK is not currently allowed by the runescape rules (as shown in that video) because you can also program it to do things like move the mouse, then click, then move it back, click, etc. all from one press on the keyboard which Jagex has deemed too close to botting or other unfair assistance.  
---
The allowed alternative to AHK is mouse keys which comes default with windows. It is like AHK but is much more limited. (Can only do one action per key press, etc.) It is useful for doing repetitive tasks like making darts once you can get the the rhythm of it. If you want to set up mouse keys then that video I linked shows how.

I dunno who this is but I like the idea of keeping RS Moments alive.
---
You can get 1m+ fletch an hour. Idk the cooking rates but it is fast. If they change al the xp gain all off a sudden ppl will get mad :p 
---
lmao yeah bro you sure are better wearing all dark and hiding in the shadows, thats the best way to get pussy

You‚Äôre an angry elf

---
Bro your account on a videogame is worth piss in any year.
---
I voted yes because even though I don't like skilling resources on drop tables meat wyverns aren't even worth killing for ironmemes and they frankly need any help they can get and it's at least more thematically cohesive than them dying and their bones suddenly being made of magic logs
---
*Played Since Classic*
---
You're adorable.
---
Yeah, history has a way of repeating itself. 
---
74rc and maybe some fishing on mobile
---
He night prefer that 500 xp/h instead
---
My point is that there shouldn't be that many dailies in the first place and jagex shouldn't be adding more. It makes the game feel forced. Even if you don't do them you're missing out on the XP and gp they give.
---
I think the problem with UIM is the looting bag and zulrah storage as being a bank. HCUIM would solve that and I would play it.
---
No interest in group Ironman, but streamers want it and streamer favoritism is real.
---
I think this discussion is always moot because most people who do play osrs in the way you're addressing do it for fun and don't want to spend a lot of time.
---
 Saying go play rs3 is contentious, untactful and unprogressive. Maybe there is some room for improvement? Maybe not. There probably is room, but who's to say?
---
Either there is or there isn't room to improve XP rates. As a perspective on how I see it, labeling something as a slippery slope in this context is a vote of no confidence for the developer and has little to do with the actual games potential for improvement.
---
Lol thats the most stupid shit ive ever heard. Might as well make a lvl 3 skiller.
---
*Notice you used a strawman fallacy*

Please OSRS Team make your own version of this quest please. You don't even have to put Korasi's sword, people would hate it anyways.

You can‚Äôt get more than 1 tome per trek.

This would be really nice, especially for those that play on a laptop and have to hold down a button to but their f keys

Can you make a prediction one next?
---
A suggestion 
---
March) Skills Specs banned for rwt 
---
April) Brexit crashes Jagex servers, offline for 3 days. Jagex apologies for this ‚Äòoopsie‚Äô but who knew Brexit was coming?
---
May) unpolled removal of Veos 
---
June) weak RS3 financials cause MTX rumours to build. Another mod leaves.
---
July) mtx for cosmetic items introduced to Osrs
---
August) gauntlet released. Players figure out how to get items out in first hour. Mod Ash institutes a one hour roll back. Boaty rants and looses shit on stream.
---
September) tithe farm Zammy wines fixed. Range pots fall 50% on first day. Jagex realises an ‚Äòoopsie‚Äô and nerfs wine collection rate back to the Stone Age
---
October) Halloween event causes seizures amongst player base 
---
November) death mechanics overhauled creating max cash stack drops whenever a player dies. Jagex apologies for this months ‚Äòoopsie‚Äô.
---
December) it‚Äôs here bois! Squeal afff fortune! 
---
Maybe. Depends on other content, influx of new players into the game, etc. Its simple supply and demand economics. The supply changes at a relatively consistent rate (based on cox drop rate) but the demand can be effected my a multitude of factors
---
No. If you want to play osrs you play osrs, if you want to progress quickly play something else but runescape. The game might be considered trash by osrs players but it still takes a lot of in game time to reach highest levels of gameplay, not as long as in osrs, but still considerable longer than in most other games
---
It isn't a fallacy. It's called precedent. They release something like this, they see everyone is generally okay with it so now they aren't afraid or cautious about introducing more stuff along the same line and then that sneaks in, now the boundary stretched farther and they introduce anther thing, and so on and so forth.
---
So the new method:
---
* Varrock Elite Diaries
---
* Hard Desert Diaries
---
* Enakhra's Lament + 1M gold for infinite Camulet
---
* Ring of Dueling or some other bank teleport
---
* Rune Pickaxe
---
Compared to buying from shops method:
---
* No requirements
---
How exactly are the requirements insubstantial? The time it would take to get those things is definitely worth factoring in.
---
Even if you buy buckets in packs and fill them manually, the requirements for doing that efficiently are far less substantial. 50 Construction for Yanille POH teleport and Ring of Dueling.
---
I changed everything, new email etc literally created an email just for my account, haven't used it for anything else. I have an authenticator bankpin etc. After I was hacked I did a clean install on my pc to make sure I had no malware My old information is compromised and is Aware of that, that's how they hacked it again I assume. I am faith wealthy on old school and I get targeted.
---
I guess it's just time to give up on my 10year+ old account.
---
It was mostly a pre-GE thing that gave decent xp. Now people run natures/zmi.
---
it's not too bad with the diary complete, although it's kind of annoying losing an inventory space to bring the boots with you
---
Yeah lol as a former addict, then casual, and right now somewhere in the middle, I've never been anywhere close to a 99 in anything and while it may be easier than other things I sure as hell am not close so I'm gonna judge
---
And so what if you can get it while watching Netflix. You can get the majority of this game while AFKing. 
---
Shut up obsidian cape.
---
Rude ass, I don‚Äôt vote for iron meme shit.  
---
You probably spent 2 hours on DS2 and likely thousands on your account. You can't take less than an hour out your time? Lol
---
Breaking sandstone to it's smallest size and then using a pestle and mortar should be the update. Would probably be only a little fast with mining XP, but would make more sense
---
Make the requirement to purchase be having the respective 99 in game.
---
270 upvotes for saying something that Autumn Elegy got Shredded for saying Lmao
---
Smfh why do marbles always gotta date asshole Chad's? Probably only likes it for its figure not its personality

Of course it affects everyone. 
---
"surely jagex wouldn't do exactly what they've already done", is this your argument? 
---
Yeah holy shit I remember when it was like 250k-300k.
---
I loved it back in day, even korasi i loved it so much but clearly was to strong for rushing reasons etc
---
Honestly that's the argument of 99% of RS. "I have more time than you, hahahaha u suck noob!" I can't stand that shit. This guy while doing slayer was shitting on me because my bank is only 52m and I'm 103 combat..I was like dude really? You're being a dick for no reason first off, secondly I feel that I've played pretty efficiently to get my stats where they are from my time played. I made the account like a year ago or something but I only did tutorial island lol, never played (I was doing a twitch prime thingy to get the "loot" but it  went to my old account that got switched to rs3) but he was acting like he had some huge achievement over me. I started playing in December a couple months ago man lol I mean..the fuck. 
---
Also I finished my b gloves first 2 weeks I played, got  fire cape with bare minimum stats (first firecape attempts too) and not to mention I could of flexed super hard from my accounts in 2002-2007.  Back when I was only PvP and staker, there were several times on the game I had welll over double digit billions and numerous p hat sets &amp; crackers from staking and high risk pking, and back then gold/items were valued MUCH more than they are today. 
---
Basically my point is that back then I had thousands of hours, now it's not even close lol. I also don't pk anymore or do pvp really - and I've never really done pvm..so I'm just learning the ropes, and not to mention SO much has changed hence the "efficiencyscape" meme. I feel like I've done decently so far taking into consideration I haven't whaled or bought my wealth at all, never used a bond for GP. Toxic elitists who get off by acting like they've achieved some sort of "accomplishment" by dissing you for being lower level or having more gold, it's pathetic and they're probably just basement virgins anyway. 
---
x-x-x-tent-ass-ee-own 
---
This is why I never understood the argument for removing tick manipulation with skilling. If you think 3t fishing is op you're completely free to go do it for 5 hours and see how you like it, if someones willing to put that much more effort then they should be allowed higher xp rates
---
I think you should definitely consider only selling them to people with the skillcape or 99 in that skill. I would never buy one because, jesus, it‚Äôs super loud runescape merch, but for some reason if I knew it was attached to my in-game achievement I‚Äôd be way more inclined. 
---
Good thing no one is forcing you to buy one 
---
He‚Äôs probably talking about introducing new methods that increase xp ph drastically. Not by a few k 
---
Green keyboard lights and green-ish shades with in the background? mhmm
---
Legends Cape is my fave cape!
---
smithing is a lovely skill that's very well designed, the problem with it is mining is an absolute disaster.
---
The thing with jad isn't so much they his mechanics are hard. I think it's more of a psychological thing. I've done every boss hundreds of times and even have 9 firecapes, 2 of which were done on 1def, but to this day I still get shaky hands on jad lol
---
I mean no, lavas are way worse, like WAY worse. I really think he means zmi with runners still I've seen complaining about that way more than I have about regular zmi, regular is fine but with runners its kinda yikes

Just a tip, if you do use serp helm with the ferocious gloves, youll have to remove the gloves before casting crumble undead, otherwise youll splash everytime. Those two combined put you past -65 mage bonus.
---
I appreciate your appreciation 
---
Lol yea you definitely sound like you get no pussy
---
I think it‚Äôs due to not being able to hop right back in. Due on Galvek? You can fight him again in 5 min. Die on Jad? He will see you in an hour.

Do agility pyramid. Ag 72 u dont fall anymore and u can make 200k/hr. While also training agility. But i would definetepy get graceful before hand at canifis.

I had luck with them too got tourmaline core at 4 kc

ah yes so lets just allow cheating instead of improving our own client

i thought this is supposed to be a joke ?

People will continue using them until they at least add the option to see your drops

Are you also gonna have void and elite void sweatshirts? I thought the concept for those looked very cool

Lol no lies here, 68 hunter but 79 RC lmao
---
Fun fact: by today's EHP rates, if you played for 41 minutes a day since release, you would be maxed. Factoring in rate changes, easier methods, doing quests/etc, and setting up easy alts for money, could still easily have been done with less than 2 hours a day.

Why would you ever create Australian worlds when they account for less than 10% of your playerbase?

This is amazing QoL
---
Will it actually be a 3-4x increase to sand gathering?
---
You still need to mine the sandstone, and crush it into buckets. You also need relatively high mining, pay the 1m fee to upgrade your camulet, and have desert hard diary done to teleport closer.
---
It is faster, but I don't think it's 3-4x faster, and it has way higher requirements than just 50 con to teleport to yanille.
---
nah mate he completed it irl.
---
Dont overthink it too much. Do whatever you enjoy. If a game gets a burdon or something you have to motivate yourself to do, just move on to another game

This Easter egg could be updated a bit. Perhaps have the green guy be asleep (same animation as those in east Varrock church), red guy doing an angry emote, add a window with a purple guy staring in, and a few more colorfully dressed people in the crowd as well. But this nice as it represents the old school gods.
---
Aye, very nice. Just started barrows on my iron meme and I pulled an Ahrims top, a Karils too, and a Torags helm within my first 12 chests lol.

Even with low stats you can easily make 500k/h. Should be plenty to get supplies and you can train stats in the process with most.
---
Maybe it helps
---
eh, just sick to the classic one that was posted on thursday
---
&gt;Its necessary if you want the rewards of doing the content for 60h.
---
A reward shouldn't be locked behing 60h of outdated unnecessary content(Ie. collecting buckets of sand) with no alternative method.
---
&gt;Do you understand what game youre playing?
---
Do you? Been updates to MTA where Jagex made MTA grind easier due to unnecessary factors, but Jagex making collecting sand easier is what you want to bitch about?
---
&gt;Im not a reddit baby or noob, thank god for that. Id be so embarassed of myself if I felt the same entitlement as a reddit baby like you.
---
LOL, yeah you think you're entitled to a never changing game where people have to go through unnecessary bullshit just because you did. Do the subreddit a favor and go back to sucking your dick in a corner, so we don't have to hear your elitist nonsense.
---
If you don't wanna fill buckets for your crafting xp don't do that method lol
---
My girlfriend's laptop hinge broke and made it practically unusable. She was going to toss it because it is old but I spent 5 minutes disassembling and realized all it needed was two new screws that held the case together, and case to the hinge.
---
I went to a computer repair shop with the screws from the opposite side and explained it, they helped me dig through a spare hardware bucket they have and I took ones that were similar.
---
When I put the new hardware in it worked perfectly.
---
So like... All that to say... Hey, maybe it is fixable. 
---
The original Champion's cape
---
Feelings mutual I suppose
---
Canifis is the fastest way to get marks of grace. It actually makes it that much faster to get it. But at 60 agility, you get -80% penalty of marks of grace for being 20 lvls above the agility lvl needed to do the course. This applies to every rooftop course, so if you are wanting marks of grace, be careful of your current agility lvl and the lvl of the rooftop.
---
Same argument as before, if someone is willing to pay runners 2.5-4m+ an hour for their time then why is it a problem 
---
"unpopular"
---
More new players from mobile who learn from ex-Jmods that begging works
---
a literal nobody.
---
So this is where the 10% of the community who voted **NO** comes to complain. Nice.
---
Get all the "free" unlockables. Torso from ba, void from pc, defender from cyclops, firecape/ardy cloak. Then ide recomend going for base 90 combat skills. Afk in nightmare zone for a hundred hours or so. Then ude be ready for close to all bosses. Then go find one you enjoy killing. Zulrah, vorkath, kbd, mole, wildy bosses, demonic gorillas, dks. Just stay there upgrading gear as you get drops &amp; ull be rolling in gp. 
---
The fun in the game is finding your motivation &amp; setting &amp; accomplishing goals. Hell if your goal is a useless 99 go for it, do wintertod &amp; hope for the pet.

I'm trying to figure out if it's a better idea to piety+pot+bandos over piety+pros in terms of a DPS to cost ratio.
---
I‚Äôm not going to sit here and say the update is perfect. Personally I‚Äôd have rather them added a sandstorm spell to fill buckets with sand. Regardless though, this doesn‚Äôt somehow make training an Ironman super easy. Using sandstone is locked behind 77 Magic and Lunar Diplomacy for superglass make, not like noob ironmen will be able to avoid the early grind. It makes it easier obviously, but that was the point. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúcompletely devaluing the game mode‚Äù though.
---
Pestilent bloat's sound is up there somewhere, trust me
---
Does it? 
---
The only way it would work is if it made more gp per hour than no requirement methods and it didn‚Äôt break the rules.
---
OSBUDDY AHAHAHAHA
---
what do you think this is 2013?
---
The normies took over long ago :(
---
In that case yes Sliske kills him
---
Will they ever improve their own client? Yea sure but it took them like 4 years to add a map....so yea id rather cheat. 
---
Is this a troll
---
I'm not saying the gamemode is ruined, please don't put words in my mouth.
---
Because ironmen can't trade or use the grand exchange, they have to collect buckets of sand (a pain in the ass that's very rewarding once finished, just like the rest of the game). Implementing a change like this that allows ironmen the ability to get *significantly* more buckets per sand per hour and is coming to the game *purely* to make ironman crafting easier.
---
It is my opinion that when Jagex is making updates it should be in the viewpoint of regular accounts, just like the rest of this game. The challenge of ironman mode is you're playing a game that was designed around accounts that can trade.
---
20% is still a massive buff, and certainly not QOL imo

You don‚Äôt say?

Ironmeme account should never have anything buffed

LMAO, dude have you ever heard of Google? The wiki literally lists easy ways to make money, one of my personal favs for when I was getting my account off the ground was blast furnace. Also for farming you should be planting ranaar seeds with ultra compost, like 100k profit per run
---
Wintertodt destroyed firemaking and made into a joke of a skill. Pretty sad tbh

Yeah it‚Äôs a papad, they‚Äôre also known as papadums

Hans: She is üà∂ no üò£ longer with us, Swampletics. And with her death üíÄüíÄüíÄ, I am finally free üÜì to say üó£üó£üó£ the b-word whenever I want üòã.
---
Thurgo: Not if I have üà∂üà∂ anything to say üó£üó£ about it, Hans, and I do. Prepare for my redberry ü•ßü•ß pie beam!
---
Thurgo uses his redberry ü•ßü•ß pie beam and Sea Shanty 2 üé§üé§ starts playing as Hans is üà∂ hit for 73 hp.

Hans: Swampletics, my son, you wouldn't let me die ‚ö∞‚ö∞, would you?
---
Swampletics: Shut up ‚òù‚òù‚òù, Serene.
---
Hans screaming and dissolving into dust

Swampletics: Hey üëã Sandwhich Lady, who üíÅ's that guy üë¶üë¶ in front of us rising out üèéüèç of the Draynor Village Dock üíßüíß?
---
King Narnode Shareen: It is üà∂ I, King Narnode Shareen.
---
Sandwhich Lady: King Narnode Shareen? What üòÖ are you doing here üëàüëà?
---
King Narnode Shareen: I have üà∂üà∂ come to exempt my revenge on üîõüîõ you humans for allowing my waifu to die ‚ö∞‚ö∞‚ö∞ at the hands ü§≤ü§≤ü§≤ of Hans.
---
Sandwhich Lady: But King Narnode Shareen, we did everything we could.
---
King Narnode Shareen: I've üôã already made up ‚òù‚òù my mind ü§Øü§Øü§Ø.
---
Swampletics: King Narnode Shareen, don't do it. This ‚¨Ü won't bring Nieve back ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è.

King Narnode Shareen: Bwana üôåüëãüèø.

Swampletics: Swampletics' log, Episode 35: King Narnode Shareen has struck us out üèéüèç of the water üöøüöø by saying the b-word.
---
Sandwhich Lady: It just doesn't make sense Swampletics, King Narnode Shareen would never ‚ùå say üó£üó£ the b-word.
---
Swampletics: I don't understand it either Sandwhich Lady, but some things you just gotta live with. Unless, Hans, I should've known it was you.
---
Hans inside of King Narnode Shareen: Swampletics, my son, I see üëÅüëÅ you've discovered my master üëë plan. Now that I have üà∂üà∂üà∂ taken over King Narnode Shareen's body, I have üà∂üà∂ free üÜìüÜì reign to say üó£üó£ the b-word whenever and however I please üôèüôèüôè.

Swampletics: So what üòÖ you're üëâ saying is üà∂ that you're üëâ inside of another man üë¶üë¶?
---
Hans inside of King Narnode Shareen: Why ü§î yes üëçüëçüëç, I suppose you could say üó£üó£üó£ that.
---
Swampletics: But Hans, wouldn't that make you an ironman üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà?
---
Hans inside of King Narnode Shareen: No üò£üò£üò£, this ‚¨Ü can't be!

Hans's screams of anguish becoming more ‚ûï‚ûï‚ûï and more ‚ûï distant
---
Swampletics: Well boys üë¶üë¶üë¶, we did it. Racism is üà∂ no üò£üò£ more ‚ûï.

King Narnode Shareen: Hello üëã Swampletics.
---
Swampletics: King Narnode Shareen, what üòÖ are you doing here üëàüëà?

King Narnode Shareen: I came to thank üôè you for your üëâ great üá¨üáßüá¨üáß service üõéüõéüõé to this ‚¨Ü world üóæüóæ.

Swampletics: No üò£üò£üò£ thanks üôè neccesary King Narnode Shareen.
---
King Narnode Shareen: As a token of my gratitude, I'd like üòÑüòÑ to give you the b-word pass üé´üé´.

Swampletics: King Narnode Shareen, it is üà∂ an honor to call you my bwana üôåüëãüèø.

King Narnode Shareen: And as to you, old üë¥üë¥ friend üê∂. 
---
Everyone seems to be getting mad zenyte drops today. 
---
If I'm going to play on an easy modo client without using anything why play on it? Just use it for the sake of using it? What a pointless thing to do.
---
It‚Äôs a solid method that‚Äôs not even difficult and grants really good xp. If it ain‚Äôt broke then don‚Äôt try to fix it aka make it even more easier.
---
The thieving one is the best imo
---
I have but the game is barely known
---
Watch the new episode lol
---
&gt; the rates are seriously unbalanced.
---
Ignore the previous rates for a moment. Ask yourself if collecting sand *should* be a necessary part of the game. If you think the gameplay experience is enriched by spending a large amount of time buying buckets of sand, then sure vote no to it. If you think that's not a worthwhile part of the game, vote yes to it.
---
I understand that it's a big change, but if the old way of doing things was shit content, be glad it's changing instead of complaining that it's OP.
---
It's a 20% increase in xp rates at best. The time is in blowing the glass.
---
If you didnt play until the cut scene then I'm sorry cause finding out on your own account is a different experience
---
Bwana.
---
Quality hoodies will cost about that. 
---
Think of how loud you'd have to be to yell something to someone underwater from miles away, it makes sense
---
I wouldn't consider any "buyable" skill hard to do, mainly just time consuming but if you have the money its super quick..
---
Ahh, elitism at it's finest. This one is going age perfectly. 
---
Why not just tell them you like Runescape?
---
Slayer using konar as master 
---
They'd be smart to release them around runefest. A month is very optimistic 
---
&gt;Each time it only lasted two weeks at most
---
dude what are you doing with your laptop? I've had a msi ge62 for over 4 years and regularly transport it with no issues
---
O
---
Eye on KC 26, Claw on KC 52, and Leather on KC 72. Still ~75 more in my task.
---
Honestly this is a retarded post, I couldnt care less about increasing xp rates, but way to be a pretentious cunt about it.
---
Some dude was crying about people not wanting to buff skill xp, runecrafting in particular. He had his rsn in his flair, looked him up and what do you know, he had fucking 50 rc. These are the kind of people we don‚Äôt need but this obsession with getting as many new players as possible is resulting in massive ezscape changes
---
I‚Äôd agree with this until 95 Mage, I was using wave/tome for a while then switched back to TOTS cuse it was about the same speed.  Surge/Tome WRECKS the brothers.  
---
yesterday i went by the ge doing a bank run and there was a guy hosting games of chances and while he was auto spamming his shit there was a player mod just sitting next to him chatting with other players.  Player mods dont give a shit anymore Jagex more than likely dont care either.  
---
Kacy on suicide watch.
---
Gz brother!
---
I did it with rcb at like 75 range with not too much trouble.
---
All those comments im only insulting to people because I have reason to, lol. They dictate how the interaction is going to go.
---
"Found the grognard" 
---
&gt; Are you 100% sure?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; Not being open to change is a part of being autistic, Lynx Titan is an example.
---
No. Thats conservatism, not autism. Look it up. Lynx titan loves doing things schematically. 
---
Ok
---
That'd be nice. Opened 99 firemaking worth of crates and got a D Axe but no Tome. Felt real bad.
---
you dickhead you didnt even give the right advice on how to find margins, let alone utilizing them hahaha. Take all the comments you've made to replies and apply it to yourself because youre really makin yourself look dumb as fuuuuck man
---
That weird dude? Post malone plays aswell btw
---
Yes, people should deiron and ruin the prestige of their accounts simply because of a outdated content that wasn't designed with IMs in mind! /s
---
Nice.
---
&gt;Surge/Tome WRECKS the brothers
---
Yes but staying at wt to get it nullifies the time saved on faster kills
---
People who dh bomb and dbow rush on tourney worlds are the ultimate in brainlets. Such a shame that clw has the countdown timer on those worlds.
---
They should add the supply boxes to the duel arena. 
---
Tooootally not setup
---
nice, and here i am over 1k kc and just 2 ring parts... rip my rng
---
What is it you need help with? 
---
What about the bots buying ore from blast furnace, how do we fix this?
---
Hell yeah! Just want to say, I can easily see these becoming top sellers in your store. These are genuinely so sick. 
---
I have never bought game merch or band merch before, but I would absolutely buy 1-2 of these. 
---
F to all the downvotes.
---
But it's not ~~white~~ right to discuss white knives.
---
Grug not trust wiki
---
Agreed, there are other methods besides sand. Should already be thankful that giant seaweed is a thing 
---
Did you just mix Halo 3 and Top Gun?
---
Are you stupid or something?
---
Yeah did it in one session 
---
Normal rc isn't even that bad tbh, nor is agility. Tbh I'd put rc, agility and slayer as my top 3 favourite skills. RC and agility are both semi afk methods (not talking about zeah) and give great rewards. and slayer is obviously slayer
---
Original client is very playable. That's what I've been using since I started playing in the summer and I've had no problems.
---
The bot is so annoying
---
Any update on this ?
---
everything im not good and i just wanna learn from the pros like smithing and stuff
---
he doesn't need anything, buddy, it was just a joke :)
---
Maybe your pc is uoptimized  trash lol my  hp pavallion can run rune lite
---
That‚Äôs interesting! The biggest issue with the sandstone method is super glass make then. Jagex is going to need to balance it carefully.
---
Alright, and there's a quest explaining that the sand is teleported in. I'm not sure why your explanation only applies to those things and not to this relatively small thing that has an actual explanation to it. The sandbox is refilled and we collect more.
---
You applied the same reasoning that can be applied to sand. This isn't an issue of realism, and if it is then we have a hell of a lot more to change in this game.
---
60 attack med level means you need to do the knights training which gives 20k attack and def xp so you need to do that from the start. 
---
How long did it take you to get to wave 56? I just did my first fire cape with 75 ranged and 70 defense with a blowpipe and it still took me around 75 minutes. 
---
Eh, less than 15m. Pretty pretty cheap for a 99 and super fast. 
---
This was already coldfixed before the poll went live. You're contributing to the problem by spreading fake news. I can't wait for this to pass and watch the butthurt
---
So? Everyone else manages to deal with it. You don‚Äôt even need very high levels or diaries for pvm. Why should you deserve something you haven‚Äôt worked for?
---
Blowpipe makes it 5x easier and faster man, I would say it's probably worth it to get level and go in with blowpipe.
---
Is he not?
---
Super bummer, thanks for doing the research though. I hadn't thought to test that way; that's super smart. 
---
I have 1 more idea that I want to try out, could you tell me how you set it so that you hadn't completed the quest yet? I went onto one of those unrestricted worlds, but the quest had already been completed so the Tanglefoot wasn't in the usual room.
---
Travesty wasn't the right word. A travesty is a mockery of something else, which didn't fit his sentence
---
It kills me personally that we have this huge expansive world and people only see like three or four different possible ways to play that have the acceptable amount of efficiency. I‚Äôm constantly switching back and forth to different things because prolonged grinding isn‚Äôt my thing. I‚Äôll work my way up to these big money makers, but I‚Äôm trying to make the most of the come up. 
---
In realitiy rc is one of the best skills to do, well if u are 77 or above 
---
Why prestige does the account have if everything becomes overtuned and easyscape for irons? They chose their limitations. 
---
My god it‚Äôs beautiful
---
No whips?
---
&gt;I dont see how even 1 person is voting yes, let alone 80%
---
Because people don't care about the integrity of the game and will happily vote for things that make the game easier. Come to think of it, has there ever been any point in time when the vast majority of players have been against something that makes the game unnecessarily easier? As best as I can remember, there's always a large number of people that defend such changes.
---
My pc works runelite fine... but I‚Äôve tried to download it on other computers and the thing would glitch out... 
---
Goodbye.
---
exactly, makes all of the pages useless. I'm in the exact same boat
---
No it devalues my 57 hours I play this game every single day. If you want ezscape play RS3.
---
Youll get more meaningfull dps upgrades by selling things to level your range/mage
---
My mahogany runs give me about 6 or 7 nest a run on average, runs like thisnarent the norm

I did the required and holy grail for the pray xp and a souls bane for varrock diary so you can get the g/e teleport. 
---
I read all the comments and tips about using a streamlined setup. I get around 1.50 average kill times (ahrims/void) what upgrades would i need to increase efficiency? Im grinding for tanz mutagen in between elite diary training. 
---
Casual OSRS player here. I‚Äôll drop an hour or so on mobile at work cause of the nostalgia and meeting some new people. What poll is this outrage about? I wanna make sure I vote the opposite if what you guys want so I can watch you lose your minds over a 15 year old game.
---
What the fuck?
---
Boo
---
Runecraft is my favorite, I find the skill very relaxing.
---
3 tomes but only 380 pages till 99 ü§™
---
print said picture and place it on a flat surface, pull down your pants (and underwear if you wear those), and place your buttocks onto the picture
---
You're missing out on so much. Original client is absolutely playable, but runelite has so much that is just qol changes and not the plugins that make everything super easy.
---
And for that reason you‚Äôre tonight‚Äôs biggest loser 
---
Howd you manage 8 kill trips? Whats your invy like and is anc/arma a big step up vs ahrims and elite void? 
---
This update would keep people from staying at wt past 99
---
&gt;All those comments im only insulting to people because I have reason to, lol.
---
LOL, what reason did you have? Them having a different opinion LOL.
---
&gt;They dictate how the interaction is going to go.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;"Found the grognard"
---
That insult was by someone else, not the person you initially called a "big reddit ironman baby" for no reason.
---
That's why I didn't include your "Lazy Loser" comment as an example since the person insulted you first.
---
&gt;Yes.
---
Go get re-checked, you're definitely on the spectrum.
---
&gt;Lynx titan loves doing things schematically.
---
Lynx Titan has a set routine for his life, which he doesn't derivative from because of his autism.

Why should PvMers get to vote on PvP Content? But even if they aren't the best suited to vote on a specific topic, they still should be able to vote in general. Also, part of the what we vote on isn't the Content but the use Dev Time.

Glough was a joke if you used the hit amd run method.
---
Galvek was fun being able to get 1 shot at anytime was stressful and intense.
---
Imo 10/10 bosses
---
Exactly, my friend is an iron as well and has 3 tomes at 85 firemaking.
---
this is the problem. 99 cooking is and NEVER has been respectable by the rs community. the community is slowly shifting over to opinions like this one. where people actually believe that 99 cooking/fletch/firemaking are groundbreaking achievements. be happy that you got it but don't vote yes to turning every fucking skill into one of them :)
---
when it dies it splits into 6 cerberus and your monitor turns off
---
I've got the same laptop :) 
---
So I did the exact same thing as you and have sustained my membership through bonds. Don't listen to people saying Blast Furnace, it's great once you have 60 smithing, coal bag and Ice gloves but they take a LONG time as a member. The absolute best money maker for you is making Teleport to home Tele tabs and smithing cannonballs. You make pretty decent gold, have the requirement already and don't need loads of starting cash at all. Supplement it with some Wintertodt, which is fun at early levels and makes good money, then do load of quests and just get the levels you enjoy up in the meantime. You'll get better money makers gradually but none have been as consistent or as afk as these. 
---
Agreed. I'd say it has to do more with the style of the skill. Like you wouldn't expect Mining to train like Woodcutting; the skills are related by category but they play a bit differently. So something like MLM while it is a bit of a departure from classic Mining can still feel like Mining whereas something as AFK as Redwood for Mining could end up feeling more like Woodcutting instead of Mining.
---
That said, with how much skills can overlap at times it is hard to give them new and unique training methods without it being comparable to other skills. But I'd say the goal should be for any new method to still feel like the skill rather than something repainted from a different skill. And if the skill is slower or not AFK or not profitable, those will likely still be true in new methods.
---
Well that‚Äôs about the dumbest comment I‚Äôve read on here üòÇ
---
The only problem I see is overly sensitive pussies. 
---
I seem to always have too much left over food on my trips so what I tend to do is just collect like 20 pairs of boots and drop them during the trip if I really need the inventory space
---
It's not a hard skill at all. Infact it's easy after 77. It's slow, but pretty AFK.
---
According to devs in a stream they attack a good chunk of the back log via QoL. 
---
Doubtful. The entire community absolutely *loves* anything that makes the game significantly easier, case in point any third party client plugin and advantage they can get to nearly play the game for them.
---
he was comparing to regular dragon bones
---
Like I said, they'd need to offer "enter to chat" which would likely be its own toggle. It might be harder than it seems to change the options of a menu based on a toggle like that, but I'd expect it is possible.
---
Nothing cringier than a white guy saying "nigga"
---
The influx of noobs probably made it skyrocket
---
Maybe try recovering it, that should let you reset the email and password
---
Y‚Äôall weak. I‚Äôd wear the shit outa them.

&gt;and it depends very much on the person as well and to what degree you have autism and what form of autism.

I don't need to do anything, its a Sunday evening, do you think i saved the url of that post? If you want to see it find it yo damn self
---
This worked up until a 2 days ago. Didn't stop many irons to bank a ton of them including rank 1 ironman dids who banked more than 200m crafting with it.
---
Ngl I used to think this shit was funny but like 70% of the people I interact with on this game do shit like this and it's so goddamn embarrassing now.
---
Damn, what an absolute UNIT.
---
Nope, 3 tasks and no whips feelsbad
---
Why the exaggerated fatalism man. We are incredibly far from rs3. Look, osrs has been around for 6 years, so basically we are in summer 2013 now if we start counting in 2007. We are far away from the horrible power creep that lead to eoc (eoc came at the end of 2012). We aren't even at 2009 rs2 levels of power creep. No chaotics, no ss, no summ, no nex armour, no korasi, no storm of armadyl or polypore (I agree that blowpipe and tbow are too much though. These are two individual nerfable items though, and not a whole combat system that went overkill). So that is the combat situation.
---
If we look at skilling, the difference to rs3 if even more huge. Runespan, living rock caverns, warbands? These were op. Not zmi or motherlode mine. We are at like 1/3 of 2013 xp rates. Just because we were at maybe 1/4 in actual 2007, we don't need to stay there. If you say it should stay like that, okay, why? Why not 2004 xp rates then? Or was 2001 best when you could only woodcut regular trees at 15k xp/h?
---
Stop with the eoc panic.
---
Yea was just surprised because I remember it being around 200-250k 
---
-
---
But I guess the fact it looks pretty nice too helps, on top of being bis for no stat reqs
---
Yeah, half the shit that gets polled is not half as impactful as this 
---
I can‚Äôt see anything wrong with this suggestion, and neither can the dude wearing the helm
---
r/IAmVeryBadAss 
---
Those bots are a lot more robust since they require membership. 
---
I don't know a lot about the blast furnace so im not sure if that vendor is locked behind any requirements but perhaps a solution could be to lock it behind 60 Smithing or the Freminik mediums?
---
You got it set to 'M' for Mini...
---
ahhhh thats hot
---
So even with ice gloves it should do this?
---
I think tick manipulation shouldn't be in the game as it's not intended. However, I'm very serious about currently keeping it as it is the only way for players who want do things more intensively to actually gain more as well. 
---
So basically I think it's currently good to have it but I wouldn't want to see it forever.
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not playable.  lol
---
Yea might as well make it easier on yourself and just get that 75 ranged.
---
Yeah, fuck people for enjoying anything. They should all be as miserable as me
---
Well idk what else he does in his spare time!
---
Yes. 0 reason not to wait 1 inven to pick up. 
---
Not hard to do but time consuming sums up every skill in RuneScape. Youre still right though most buyables are really fast.
---
Please please please please please!
---
So many players are going to buy these lol
---
ill 99 slay your ass if you pass by me with one of these and my 120 slayer cape on
---
Idgaf, I will vote yes on every single poll that makes some things in this game even a little more enjoyable. Not everyone plays 6 hours a day with maximum efficiency and demand new content all the time because they get bored. More stuff like zmi is really needed on this game

That's my exact look rn...
---
the meme calendar was ruined by this
---
I'd agree wholeheartedly, the benefit really was tasks that gave me good xp but generally have poor drops, so if I was in the mood to train efficiently I could without it making a dent in my bank.
---
A J Mod told you to. 
---
Congrats man, takes a lot of perseverance. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it be bronze plateskirt?
---
How tho?
---
&gt; Can‚Äôt have the macro do more inputs than you.
---
I'm clicking 4 keys so that's the same amount of inputs?
---
I wish they polled the idea and the balancing separately. I liked the idea, but agree with you that the amount of sand per stone is too high. But the poll was simply yes/no, and there's a good chance that if it didn't pass, they'd dismiss the entire idea. So I ended up voting yes despite not wanting the significant buff to crafting xp rates.
---
These look great, I hope a zipper option will be available aswell
---
I'd say worth the watch, game me a good chuckle
---
True, I wouldn't want to train herblore like I train fishing. Or train train strength by planting a seed and harvesting it the next day for 20k xp. 
---
pretending to be girl
---
How about we make every month "engine work" month until the devs stop using it as an excuse.
---
Filling buckets at the sandpit now is around 2k buckets of sand per hour. With sandstone working for super glass make you will be able to get 6-9k buckets of sand worth of sandstone per hour depending on your mining level and if you 3t mine or not.
---
Everyone uses runelite. It's just OSB with all the paid features for free. No reason to use osbuddy anymore.

I really want the herb hoodie to sit around, get stoned, and play scape in.

Ever played WoW? Not a diff client but modding is allowed and they help you tons (more than RL really). That's essentially what RL is to OSRS. 
---
What are you trying to accomplish here? You kinda painted a pretty dishonorable picture of yourself and what you were doing. While I have no authority over determining that what you did constitutes a mute, just remember that even though it‚Äôs not necessarily illegal or against any game rules to be an asshole, you gotta accept the consequences that come with it.

PSA: You can make a post without flexing your pure's stats

/r/haHAA/

Disagree, the sand collecting was part of what ironman mode is, aka grinding for goals. I'm fine with sandstone being an alternative but it should never be 3-4x times as fast as current methods. It needs to be balanced a lot better.
---
Precedence. Read a bit about it please. 
---
i will say this once again, that's not how a market works. hydras are substantially more popular than lava dragons, how exactly would it make sense that an item coming into the game at a much higher rate would cost more than some item from a monster not many are killing. im sure in time the prices will stabilize to be at least equal or greater to a lava drag bone, but as of now the prices make complete sense.

It may work for other games but runescape is probably the only game in which endgame is actually endgame and the enjoyment of playing comes from progressing toward it rather than just getting there to do endgame content. It's supposed to be a game with extensive progression diversity, there should be a fairly consistent distribution of total skill levels among the community, not just a bunch of maxed players. 
---
Lol imagine not knowing your log in info üòÇ
---
i posted this on like 10 different threads just to see how the karma would play out lol. overwhelmingly negative.
---
Much appreciated! 
---
&gt;Never change anything because everything is a slippery slope. This game was designed explicity for NEETs like me and normies have no place here!
---
A well-deserved mute. Be thankful you weren‚Äôt banned 
---
It looks like some kind of BDSM awareness campaign
---
I've tried that but can only ever access the account on tut island. My other e-mail (the one I definitely set up with the account I've been playing for the past 2 years) refuses to acknowledge that it's associated with an account. The only thing I can think of is I'm misremembering something and perhaps I made it with another e-mail address but as I said I'm 99.9% sure I didn't. The whole time I've been playing I had remember username/e-mail clicked on along with "hide" so every time I opened osrs my login name was just a bunch of stars lol. Now that I accidentally unclicked remember name it just disappeared and obviously what I had thought was the name for all these years probably isn't and I'm very confused.
---
A button to move your mouse to a specific spot and click would definitely be bannable. Gives you an unfair advantage especially because you could use the same thing for prayers and specs etc. 
---
Boaty also looks like Momo, the call of duty Esports castor. It‚Äôs uncanny to me

Omg that phone is disgusting

How much mining xp is it per hour? 95% of people would still just afk buckets rather than put in effort mining for the same amount per hour. Maybe 99%

They can, and will.  Impatient instant-gratification-obsessed consumer goes to cheap competitor for cheap knock-off.  Competitor continues to use stolen art to sell shitty products, which are poisoning the market.  
---
Yeah, man, no problem with how that pans out.
---
the wingspan on that thing holy FUCK
---
You say some weak stuff here. "Go play rs3 if you want quick progress" ridiculous. OSRS and RS3 are two entirely different games. Also "don't play if you can play only one hour a week". All this stuff makes me really think that casual, irl-lively people are not even accepted on this mental, grind-mindsetted community. The community which worships guys, who probs play 10+ hours a day (Woox, Swampletics, A Friend, Lynx Titan etc.) And then the average Joe who plays let's say 1.5 hours a day is much like a laughing stock if he says one word about the game being too much time-consuming.
---
TL;DR: This game has a fu*king unique/unbelievable community, I haven't anything like this when playing other games.
---
Bring em downvotes guys! 
---
So you were deceiving people?
---
Your account is booty hole mate 
---
"I was social engineering noobs"
---
Otherwise read as "I was subtly manipulating people", just like you're now shifting the blame onto the previous commenter for having an appropriate reaction to your manipulative tendencies. 
---
obviously 100% conclusive evidence
---
It‚Äôs just a classic case of ‚Äúasshole gets caught being an asshole and decides to play the victim‚Äù
---
I find the red clan chat text very hard to read on a clear text box!
---
I honestly can't tell if this thread is satire or if people legit only want the game to be catered to people who play 8hrs a day
---
Love the idea and seems to tie in very well! Probly will have to make the quest longer and add some stuff but great start 
---
are u fucking stupid nigga red symbol takes actual skill while uim is just a shitty restricted grind LOOOOL what a response u basically just proved to me ur not worth the time
---
Completely agree with everything you said. Only problem is these people are not going to listen. Their only choices are to either quit or continue to complain about how slow they‚Äôre progressing. Either Jagex needs to realize that the community is getting too large and they need to change their system for how updates are voted on and implemented, or the game is going to eventually suffer the same fate as rs3 (although it will probably be much slower this time).
---
Idk xp rates. Sorry I haven't tested banking
---
Imagine thinking base 80 combat stats is a big deal.
---
I'm just wondering what other people think about it. I really don't care what people think of me to be honest, if you think I'm dishonorable, that's perfectly fine with me. 
---
You may not have authority but that doesn't mean you can't have an option. 
---
Lastly, speaking generally, reasonable consequences to being an asshole shouldn't be a punishment for something that asshole did not commit. 
---
&gt;unironically talking to people in runescape
---
Engine work
---
Serp helm getting buffed, polling a random out of the blue change to dhide, changing vorkath mechanics, a notice board for pest control are by no means all things that were on the back log. And that‚Äôs just week 1. There‚Äôs stuff on skilling week (2) and undoubtably more on week 3 and 4 that is in fact not backlog haha
---
i want the slayer one
---
When a start to finish ironman meta started forming, the game mode died. It used to be all about figuring the things out on your own. But now you can literally follow an efficient lvl 3 to max guide.

Accounts spamming for donations should be perma muted and not informed about it so that they waste their time in the GE
---
Yes, definitely! Do you think this is a colourblind thing or is it hard to read for everyone?
---
ffff00
---
Did you read the 18M in under 2 hours part? Also I would not call it deceiving people. I clearly ask for donations. If you have a different perspective I would like to hear why.
---
B
---
Great argumentation. 
---
Why?
---
That‚Äôs offensive
---
Lmfao. You were scamming gold. You know you were. We know you were. You didn't find some secret loophole where you get to explain to us that you weren't technically scamming because "regret is subjective". 
---
Seriously, how old are you that you thought, "Oh it's not *technically* lying to people for money cause I told them they wouldn't regret giving it to me. If they end up regretting it they just don't understand karma man. Regret is subjective so I'm not responsible for this at all. I used the word "donate" so only dumbasses would give me gold thinking they'd get something in return."
---
You know what you were doing, jackass, and you don't even have the plausible deniability you're trying to stage. Consider yourself lucky you were only muted for a day.
---
Yea but I got it at 14kc
---
Here are some tissues for ur tears smh
---
Believe it or not, there's actually a large number of people who do hate these skills.
---
See why that argument doesn't work?
---
There are no rules against being manipulative. 
---
What level mage I need to make memes go front page?

I‚Äôm at work so commenting to watch later .

But is this better than dhcb? Especially with saving on supplies
---
But you‚Äôre choosing to limit yourself. I knew what I signed up for, but now every update is catered to me because I‚Äôm an ironman. There‚Äôs been years of these updates making ironman easier every time. Nothing in rs is hard apart from the inferno and progress is locked behind time spent playing, not skill level. 
---
I was not spamming.
---
They're not new content, just nobody ever gets tasks to do em

No one would be forcing you to use the new keybinds, or even the existing available keybinds in general

Imagine hunting red chins at 100+ combat instead of bossing or face-tanking pkers at black chins.

There are rules against manipulating people out of their gold by setting up false pretenses. AKA scamming. You told them they wouldn't regret it. You can't tell us that you didn't know that most of them would actually regret it.
---
!remindme 3 days
---
Wait... The crown already makes a W shape... So that means it is already set to Wumbo and turning it upside down would set it to M...TX! Turn it back!
---
Begging for donations is spam and annoying af
---
Yes! That's exactly what I was doing. Like I started my post, it may be immoral but it's technically not against the rules to ask for donations. You just call it scamming, which you admitted yourself, it's not. 
---
&gt; "Donate 1M and I promise you won't regret it." by which I mean they'll get good karma but it could imply something else if you're dumb and naive enough.  
---
  
---
Yeah, I read this part:  
---
"But it could imply something else if you're dumb and naive enough." I wonder what that could imply. Could you enlighten me?
---
devalues my colorblind ironman.

When Jagex announced they were raising the price to 11$, they encouraged people to subscribe right away, as you would keep paying the previous price until you stopped being a member.

herb runs aren't worth past mid game on a main account and birdruns absolutely never necessary, especially if you do black chins.
---
don't really see how you can consider them dailies. 
---
Annoying but not against the rules. I though you meant as in autotyping.
---
Smooch 
---
Adding it to the list regardless :)
---
Well I wore mine all the time before I got my fire cape and I still use it sometimes if I'm deep wildy PKing and I'm not using a stab weapon. Not saying it's great but it's a budget fire cape option.
---
Sure, I guess you‚Äôd just have to deal with it then 
---
My regret is not your regret. While I firmly believe donating will give you good karma, therefor you won't regret donating, I am not responsible for what other assumptions people make.
---
"It uses whatever attack style you have selected to calculate your accuracy, but looks at their slash defence."
---
So your stab accuracy still matters

What are you waiting for? Go collect so you can talk to girls!

---
Mucho jealous, gratz
---
I'm on like 300kc and haven't gotten any of the uniques
---
Thats the stupidest thing I've heard all month.  How lazy do you need to be in order to get upset over taking 5 extra seconds a task to get your loot because a inv space saver was implemented?
---
At quick glance I thought you were the infamous Ghjjf.
---
You deserved it
---
Found the tot member
---
Yeah, rune body/legs, helm of neitz, legends cape and white boots was the og setup
---
if you're still a member I'd suggest telegrabbing wines in the chaos temple that's near falador instead of the wilderness one. it's only crowded on f2p worlds because it's one of the best f2p money makers.  
---
members can have access to far better money methods which makes it less populated, add to that plenty of members worlds and it's not hard to find an empty world.  
---
also the temple near falador has 2 wine spawns, one upstairs which requires zamorak prayer robes (the red + white ones) or zamorak monk robes on top 500 total level.  
---
if you have a looting bag it's even better because it's close to the wilderness ditch so you just jump over to lv 1 wildy and you've got 28 extra loot slots before banking.  
---
a no requirement money maker that's not listed is buying supercompost and 2x volcanic ash and making ultracompost. check prices before you buy a bunch but super is around 600, volcanic ash around 350, so 1300 to make ultra, and it sells for 1400-1500.  
---
buy limit for supercompost is only 600 per 4 hours but even assuming low margins of 100gp per item it takes like 10 minutes to do this for 600 x 100 = 60k, which is 600k/hour in the long run.  
---
if you have money in your bank that's not doing anything, set up buy orders on the GE and make some quick flips. one thing I do is buy soul runes at 146 and sell for 149 every day. a buy limit of 10k every 4 hours, and 3 gp profit per rune means 30k profit every 4 hour buy limit, so 180k a day for setting up buy/sell orders on the GE which literally takes a minute.  
---
and it's completely safe because there's an NPC that buys soul runes for 150 gp no matter what, so even if I bought them at 146 and they drop below that, I can still sell 10k runes for 40k profit and it takes like 5 minutes (though it does need some quests to unlock the store).  
---
if you're f2p I would still suggest telegrabbing wines near falador, the changes to monks becoming aggressive when you telegrab the ground floor wine shuts out most low level bots that have less than 500 total (those that do can just go upstairs).  
---
I've not checked f2p worlds for a while but if it's still crowded there, try high alching items (typically rune gear, addy platebodies and green d'hide bodies) since it's reliable (nature runes are stable and high alch values are permanent), low effort, and just as good if not better than most f2p skilling methods on average, but also has the potential for higher profit margins if someone dumps alchables on the GE.
---
Yeah. But burst with slayer, at nechs and dust devils etc. No point going out of your way to burst monkeys
---
Wait till you hear about Nieve
---
This post made me so incredibly insecure.
---
Runelite has gpu rendering and animation smoothness options!
---
Teleport to Kourend takes your right to the statue. Think it's 67 magic and requires unlocking through Arceuus library (use the Runelite plugin and it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes). Xeric's Talisman also takes you there but needs 100% favour in every house.
---
Some random stranger on the internet. If someone spends 14 hours on a game, reads this, and realises that spending 14 hours on a game is clearly an unhealthy addiction, he'll probably make some adjustments, right? I truly believe every human has a moral obligation to look out for every other human being. 
---
I can sit here and tell you that a video game addiction is unhealthy but that's pretty much the extent of my ability. The rest comes down to the person, I can't unplug your internet or your computer.
---
not to mention it's close to a fairy ring, which makes travelling around as an ironman much easier
---
&gt;GE hasn't updated
---
He isn't going off of the listed ge price
---
Skillspecs should be olm
---
Is it not absolutely 100% factually correct that I was asking for donations? Just because I'm leaving the last part out doesn't make it any less true.
---
55
---
you shouldn't, personally id love it if they took out loads of resources from pvm and put them into new or existing skilling methods, like they are doing with this sandstone. high effort high reward skilling. The problem with that is a lot of the player base don't like skilling so would rather get it passively while training something they do like.
---
&gt;My regret is not your regret. While I firmly believe donating will give you good karma, therefor you won't regret donating, I am not responsible for what other assumptions people make.
---
You don't firmly believe anything. You change your beliefs to suit your argument. You've admitted that you knew most people would expect more than "karma" in return, so you admit you were deceiving people for gold. If you believed in karma you wouldn't be fucking your karma up by "socially engineering noobs" into giving you gold.
---
?
---
Rip man I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I‚Äôm only 10 hrs in, that‚Äôs painful to hear
---
Deception isn't mentioned once.
---
Oh man I feel bad, 9kc....
---
TIL thanks for the correction 
---
I don't disagree with you but pulling the "just play rs3" is such a dumb argument. If you can look at both games and legitimately think the only different between them is the xp rates then you're brain dead.
---
Youre right. People are voting in all these updates that lead to RS3. Sad to see the direction. Eventually when everyone are maxed (already at 6k) people are not gonna care. Generic game where everyone has completed it.
---
Smh
---
Yeah, but you don't really see pkers voting no to any pvm or Skilling content to spite the other community, do you?
---
Unless you are counting pking on wilderness as toxic.
---
If I‚Äôm assigned a Jad task will the slayer helm give bonus accuracy and damage to all monsters in the cave or only Jad?
---
Is it possible you made a mistake and had two premium memberships?

That's most likely your fault for being a dumbass rather than osbuddys.

&gt; People are spending thousands of hours obtaining max capes, it is not an easy thing to do. That's what you need to get through your thick skull.
---
So what lmfao. A few thousand hours isnt a lot. Most "gamers" have that lol.
---
&gt; Any goal in life that takes you thousands of hours to finish was a hard fucking thing to finish. These maxed players could've spent 1000, 2000 or 5000 hours getting maxed, they could've used the ezscape methods available today or they could've used the extremely tedious methods we had in 2013. Regardless of what methods they've used, they still have finished the hardest challenge in the game.
---
Much easier than in 2013, sadly!
---
&gt; Stop living in this bubble of runescape and its xp rates, it's cringey seeing you complain about shit that doesn't matter. The game isn't RS3, it isn't ezscape, it's just a bit easier and a LOT better than when it came out in 2013.
---
Its cringey seeing you being perfectly fine with these fucked up XP rates lol. And yes its easyscape. Everything is made easier and more convenient.
---
It‚Äôs no surprise. The majority of people on this sub are fucking horrible at the game.

I've previously bought bonds through my Google Play Credit from the Opinion Rewards scheme. This was in December. Not sure if anything has changed.

Players wearing the same team cape already appear as dark blue on the map but I get what you mean.

The game needs a colorblind mode or maybe some kind of filter for different types of colorblindness. I can imagine it'd be a pretty big project though

You just get more and more entertaining. I do particularly like how you completely backed away from the argument and started talking about your right to an opinion.

Since we¬¥re now on the subject, clearly 1,730 people have at least shown a degree of interest in the concept (not to say all will buy, obviously) while 3% of people downvoted the post.

current rate is ~2000-2300 an hour, sandstone will push it to 8000-11000 an hour depending on various factors

Would be cool as ornament kits to clue scrolls.
---

---
Iron to me isn't about the prestige, or achievement, or any other autistic things like that.
---
It's simply doing things on my own, without relying on others, that makes it fun for me.
---
Bots have warped the economy of real RS into a point of no return. Also people with high skill reqs doing high level PvE content just dumping all the mats to G.E. for easy access warps the game in a negative way alot.
---
Enter ironman. Ironman is literally perfect for anyone who wants to have a personal economy, irrespective of the other players.
---
What makes this mode fun is that you can't just buy X item from G.E., but certain things may require more roundabout methods and have other requirements before you are able to access them.
---
The problem with crafting is that it had no high effort alternative nor an afk-able alternative. But now it at least has a high-effort alternative.
---
To me crafting is just means to an end. Unlike most other skills, crafting produces an item that is actually useful, especially for my 1 defense ironman, Amulet of Fury. Actually, bracelet of regen is useful too, since I won't have access to all of the culinomancer's gloves, and the regen effect increases afk-ability also.
---
Anything that makes getting that level more easier so I can actually get to the fun stuff, like combat, is a win to me. But most people actually don't train to get 99 stats, they just want to get 90 crafting to get a fury or something else to unlock a diary reward.
---
Either way, caring about 3rd party things that are dependant on other players perspective about your account like "prestige" seems kind of silly, so that kind of argumentation always leaves me baffled, especially in a gamemode already as selfish as the ironman mode.
---
These would be great as a clue reward
---
Frick yeah... I want the smithing one. 
---
nice
---
I didn't make that assumption. I'm explaining to you why you received the mute. Frankly, I would've reported you for scamming if I saw you doing this, and the more you post, the more I think you were well on your way to getting one, anyway.
---
Saying "Gold plz" is different than "Give me gold. You won't regret it." If you don't understand that, then you really don't have any room to be calling someone a dumbass.
---
This is just dorky and nostalgic enough for me to be all over, I'd definitely get at least one. 
---
Its great if you find decent people. Ended up staying a while to go for the pet after lvl 5 all. Got it after about 20 gambles, and I still do some runs with friends.
---
How the hell do you afk alch/agility training
---
literally using the insult im using here but again, I didnt spell it out so I guess you didnt get it
---
21*
---
and the thing is, most people enjoy combat and slayer the most (hence we call it slayerscape), and those things became very easy over the years. Even casual players can get max combat within a few months. Att/Str is 120k+ xp/h with Dharok's and very afk, Mage is 250k+ xp/h bursting, Range is 800k+ xp/h chinning. Only slow xp skills are non-combat skills which are not even needed if you only like PvM/Slayer.

You can also change it from the OS keyboard settings in at least MacOS and maybe Windows.

Your loss then, I LOVE the long videos. Makes it easier to sort of pay attention to on the side while grinding.

RoT never used any 3rd party clients other than OSBuddy/RuneLite.
---
That‚Äôs terrible
---
Try the poh method the only supplies I use for that is 1 dose of Stam per kill 1 does of super combat every other kill and prayer and antidote++ as needed. It cuts down on supplies and makes it a bit more bareable. Either way sure is good money and doesn't need to be increased by speeding up kills. (as much as I would like to speed up kills, sire is balanced as is.)
---
It's not though.
---
EoC is not an improvement to Pre-EoC. It didn't actually *fix* combat, it just shifted combat's problems. Solved some, introduced a bunch more. Initially it introduced more problems than it solved. Now, it has about the same amount of issues as Pre-EoC. As such, all the dev work spent on EoC had a net neutral effect - but cost a massive amount of players and interest in the game.
---
Would you have it any other way?
---
No he didn't. 
---
Yeah, I also hate how efficiencyscape basically boils down to "do pvm" for half the skills because it's more efficient to just buy them than go train them properly.

you mean slayer?

Also if you buy all of them they you can buy a Max cape version

Someone posted a video of 12k/h equivalent buckets on ironscape earlier. So double your triple. 
---
Still reasonable rates and just ‚ÄòQOL‚Äô to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have 80/84/85/90/93/99 though. That‚Äôs fair enough.

Agree bulk of time is spent blowing though.

My friend has it pretty bad but it really depends on if they actually take their meds or not.

You mean sick nerd the pig? His whole shtick is around being disgusting and stupid, two facets he excels at displaying (one might be inclined to believe they are not just part of a character!).
---
Agreed. Rs3 isnt easy, the challenge is shifted to a different aspect of the game. Rs3 is still a massively grindy game compared to most mmos that you can rush to max level almost immediately. People who claim rs3 is easy are laughable. Sending people off to rs3 because 'less grind' are just gonna be miserable because it's still a grind in the end, just a different one.

No thanks. Theres nothing wrong with how it is right now.

Had me in the beginning, not gonna lie.

There are so many people like this. What are you talking about?
---
A few thousand hours is a hell of a lot of time. Do you seriously not realize that? It only takes a couple minutes of staring at a clock to realize that. Go get a fucking job, build up your career. Stop playing runescape like it's your life and find something real to complain about, because this is just pathetic.
---
Also how would you benefit from the game being made harder? If the xp rates become lower do you throw a celebration with your zero friends? And since you think the game is so insanely easier than it once was, you'd better atleast have the xp to make up for it, you fucking elitist.
---
How many maxed accounts do you have at this point? Like 4 or 5 atleast with how fucking easy the game is, am I right? No you're the top percent, you must have like 6 or 7 maxed accounts. Maybe some 200m skills here and there, you're rollin in xp right? 
---
Didn't the castle age came after the feudal age?
---
Tl;dr
---
This is a gross misrepresentation. Most "hardcore" players arent against content thats for mid lvls "just because" . It's more that it often trivializes previous content while also being counter-effective.
---
Let's say they introduced a med level boss that could be camped like for example Cerberus. How do you reckon the drops would be?. Utterly garbage or incredibly op as uniques would crash to irrelevancy, or drop a metric fuckton of slchables making it viable for med lvls, but op for high lvls
---
Not the best example but it does show how "low level" content can't be made in the same way as high level content
---
Also, no low level players shoudln't be catered to in the same way as high level ones. Why? Because you're only a low level for a small amount of youe total game time, assuming you actually play the game in a slighlty productive way. High levels on the other hand have plateau-ed, and cannot progress much further
---
Low level content is extremely hard to make viable in the way this sub wants, and pretending that it's "high lvls vs. Low lvls" does the entire conflict a grave injustice. 
---
I'm usually against low level content (totally depends on what type of content of course), but not because I want Jagex to spend time on me, but because I don't want a certain part of the player base to to make RuneScape so convenient that it makes the current low level vontent *completely* unviable
---
They don't currently have to fill their own vials of water though, they can just buy them or use humidify. Should we remove the humidify spell and filled vials of water from shops to somehow make ironman mode better? Well obviously not. Just cause something's becoming easier it's not necessarily bad.
---
I'm not saying vote yes to all easyscape, I'm saying vote based on the quality of the change, not how it does or does not devalue your time.

Been a while since I‚Äôve made an obnoxiously long post so figured I‚Äôd fix that.

It‚Äôs a lot to digest, and I think it‚Äôs mostly just me waffling, but would still be interested to see what people think of some of the discussion points (to those who manage to get through it all that is).

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thing about doing all these T-Shirts. Except for Runecrafting.‚Äù

Is there a way to transfer bonds to an iron man? I assumed it wouldn't work.

I see GentleTractor, I upvote
---
Now they are like 200 m8
---
Well if the bucket isn't useful for you, then don't use it. But that doesn't mean it isn't a useful item to other players. It seems you are assuming everyone else is in your situation, but while many might be I doubt everyone is. For example, "If players don't use lunars that means they're still using their poh for the catherby portal, at which point you might as well change your spellbook". A Catherby Portal requires 50 Construction while an Altar requires 80 or 90 Construction (depends if you build Lunar Altar at 80); that can be a pretty big difference.
---
Also, there is a convenience factor to the bucket you're kinda overlooking. The bucket stores at the Leprechaun with the other farming equipment. If you use Fertile Soil, you need to bring runes, which takes up more inventory space unless you are using a rune Pouch. But if you were using your Rune Pouch for other things, like Bursts or Alchs, you'd waste time swapping it around or just skip it and take up 1-2 more inventory spots. Then if you bring a staff for the Earth Runes, you'd have to swap between that and the Secateurs and if you don't bring a staff, add more cost from the Earth Runes. So for how trivial of a time differance it is (2 less buckets per minute or so), I'd still go with the bucket.
---
Nope, I tried. Took too long. 
---
If we agree this is the only update the game gets for a year, i'm in.
---
I did that some months ago. Elvdrag is much harder with Addy armor and a Rune Shortsword!
---
since my longest play session is before bed i find that when im not taking a break from osrs i sleep much better . At night when I lay down to sleep rs is on my mind and I think about what I want to get done the next day after work and what not instead of letting all the bullshit of real life keeping my mind racing all night and it really dose make falling asleep much easier for me.
---
Orange best colour
---
&gt;Runescape and grinding are synonymous.
---
Only autists think this.
---
No, rc is fine enough once you hit bloods/souls, including that you have lava runes and ZMI.
---
I'd still love for it to be a dust u get from sacrificing vorkath heads. Make it like 1/65 for vorkath, more common for kbd. That way it would be similar rate to serp mutagens and people who farmed it before it was implemented didn't waste any time.
---
You're acting like an item being colourable somehow makes things confusing, OSRS is probably one of the only few MMOs left that doesn't have that much customisation in terms of armour and weapon appearance, so I don't think it'll matter much to new players that won't even get a hold of these items for hundreds of hours.
---
Imagine getting this pissy over a 15 year old game lmao

Worth mentioning out that they recently did something similar to the skilling catalysts/Resource boosters on RS3 with the mining and smithing rework  (They are called stone spirits) and it's not working out very well, as most stone spirits don't even sell for 1gp because there's way more people doing PvM that people using them on mining so the difference between stone spirits entering the game and being consumed is huge
---
Your completely hung up on the donation but when that isn‚Äôt even the problem, it‚Äôs the fact you imply that they won‚Äôt regret it which implies they will get something back not just your shitty ‚Äúgood karma‚Äù they fact you honestly think this mate isn‚Äôt deserved speaks a lot for your character and I honestly wish that mod had completely banned you.
---
Do you reallize how toxic your own comment is? Dont be entitled, get back to the herd.
---
Calm down virgin
---
Shit is boring af. Downvote all ya want
---
Well PKers generally don't want to vote down PvM and skilling content for a few reasons. Most PKers also do other things besides PKing, while most PvM/skilers don't partake in PKing, so voting down PvM/skilling content is PKers shooting themselves in the foot to some extent, while PvMers/skillers can vote down PKing polls with no repercussions. Also PKers generally have little reason to hate PvMers while the reverse isn't true. PvMers just keep to themselves and try to avoid PKers while PKers actively seek out and try to disrupt PvMers. PKers need PvMers but PvMers don't need PKers.
---
GentleTractor is that Bwana
---
What is VB?
---
I loved the idea of Artisan. A slayer-esque addition but for skilling. It forces you to train in different methods and could lead to a wide range of skilling based items being introduced. 
---
Daym, wish we got our good rng elsewhere!
---
Better things to do like bitch on reddit! Nice one chief 
---
I genuilly think that is a good idea.
---
Why not? Anti pking is doing PvMing in the wild, acting like a noob, and then fighting back with gear. Limiting other people that enjoy it because you don‚Äôt is a shit way to go about things. 
---
Now here is how you find Quality of Life on your own terms. I too do this for the same reason 
---
Yeah well I mean, same difference.
---
Yeah it is an option but even with all the requirements now it's so heavily botted that prices are ridiculously low. Other methods I mentioned make way more money and are easier 
---
thanks i hate it

It is a 3x exp increase for mains (400k ish to 1.296m). Its hard to calculate the exp rate difference for irons but most seem to agree its about twice the exp rate now.

That isn‚Äôt being entitled. That‚Äôs voting for something that you want. Players are only entitled to play the game (or abstain from it) within the rules, and vote for what they want to be a part of the game. Being ‚Äúentitled‚Äù in the context of your argument would be demanding things be different because a vote didn‚Äôt go your way (see spell resizing vote #3). 
---
You make the argument for me really. You acknowledge that people want to spend less time on boring tasks. This poll is going to pass, lo the system works! If you have a complaint, you‚Äôre entitled to that opinion, but it doesn‚Äôt make other people entitled for having their own preference. 
---
A whip that hits 70s wouldn‚Äôt pass a poll, so your argument doesn‚Äôt hold water. You‚Äôre trying to make my argument seem ridiculous by turning it into a caricature of itself, which is what you‚Äôd call fallacious. 
---
You aren‚Äôt going to get what you want, and maybe if you were nicer, and expressed your opinion in a constructive way, people wouldn‚Äôt be so elated that you‚Äôre a loser this time. 
---
Borderline?

Nobody can afford that shit anyway

Keep me updated on this.

Exactly.  I have a high paying demanding job.  I may not be able to play enough to buy a Dragon Hunter, but I would blink just "buying" one.

I mean,  do I really give a fuck if a bunch of teenagers and basement dwellers think I'm an idiot? No, bonds are fast and easy cash which translates to efficient training.

Appealing to a minority is usually a bad business choice, so how is it irrelevant? 
---
new update makes sand drop in value -&gt; less reward if you sell
---
ironman? you need a certain amount of sand -&gt; less time saved. 
---
doesn't matter if its zero time sand, the sand you get is less valuable in terms of opportunity cost
---
I think there have definitely been small steps in the right direction in recent years. But there‚Äôs still massive room for improvement. 
---
As for Artisan as a skill. Well, that I‚Äôm a bit more conflicted on. I don‚Äôt feel like it addresses enough of the underlying issues, especially those that I‚Äôve listed here in this post. Instead, it just served to push that feeling of forcing players into certain areas &amp; paths of gameplay that probably just need improving in and of themselves. It would almost take away more player-freedom &amp; choice than I think you‚Äôd gain in forced variety &amp; content reinvigoration. 
---
Because it *is* dead content. You do "mid level content" for a pretty insignificant amount of time compared to the grind, as a whole. Getting an 80 in a skill is like 2m/13.1m needed (~15%). A level 80 skill is not "mid level" unless we're talking combat stats.
---
So why use dev time on content people will use for the first 15% of their grind, but not for the remaining 85%? 
---
&gt;Some random casual doesn‚Äôt sub to the Reddit
---
I agree with the logic, but this doesn't mean that Reddit is full of Hardcores. All hardcores browse the sub, this is true, but they are greatly outnumbered compared to regular players. So if 99% of hardcore players browsed and only 5% of casuals did, the hardcores would still likely be outnumbered.
---
Most of the elitist comments I see get downvoted pretty hard, affirming my opinion. So this would lead me to believe the Reddit is not comprised of mostly hardcore players, just of people who enjoy both Runescape *and* Reddit.
---
Also, there was a straw poll like three or four months ago asking what the average player's bank was worth; the majority was in the ~200m range, though, 1B+ was the third or fourth most selected option. I don't know of many hardcore players without at least 1B.
---
I do respect the Hardcores need casuals as much as the adverse, portion of your post. You are right. 
---
rigondeaux would be my favorite streamer if he didnt randomly flame people. its so cringy and hard to keep watching

Begging or scamming other people by pretending to be a noob for freebies is absolutely ludicrous money.

I always wanted this. I just can't get used to using F keys. First of all, they're way too small on my laptop. Secondly I shouldn't have to mess with my BIOS to actually configure them for usage on a laptop with a FN key. Thirdly, my left hand automatically gravitates towards the WASD keys. Because pretty much every game in existence uses WASD for movement &amp; whatnot and it's a habit I have from 2 decades of pc gaming.

I used to have a razer naga, but that mouse broke recently after 5 years of intensive use and I don't plan to immediately replace it as I've grown accustomed to using ctrl &amp; shift modifiers to access easily reachable 30+ keybinds.

Taverly tablet, skills necklace, brimhaven tablet. The teleport is 11k on a run that costs well over a mil in saplings so I don't see how that's not worth using. A mid level player could easily do this exact run.

Meh, if they are going to do pre-orders to determine supply needed not really. These would probably be pretty expensive to produce so might as well know the demand. Only people who have the 99 are probably going to want them anyway, if they send a code to their registered email allowing pre-order or purchase could work.

Sweatshirts/tshirts/sweatpants etc. are so cheap to make and yield such a high amount of return on investment that it's truly silly it is taking Jagex this long to come out with them... RS players will gladly pay like $60-$80 for a good quality hoody with their favorite skill on it, and it will probably cost them like $10-$15 at the very most to make it...
---
It shrinks? Or we grow?
---
You're right. So much good backlog stuff that needs polling. Still waiting on that peek-all worlds, myself.
---
I thought he had an addy scim not rune
---
I suppose so. Meeting the requirements for buying the Buckets is *true* zero time, though. It just depends when you plan to go for the 99 Crafting Grind.
---
You also have to consider it's not 3x Crafting XP/hr; it's 3x faster Buckets of Sand. Most of the experience per hour in Crafting is limited by how much glass you can blow per hour, not just by how long it takes to get the sand.
---
It will obviously make it less time overall, but definitely not 3x faster overall.
---
In any case, I'd rather vote yes to let Jagex know I want a new method, but give feedback saying it's too much and should be reduced slightly.
---
No the top controversy of the month makes it to the calender. Not the first controversy. 
---
1700 hours. Lol. 
---
Physically hurts man. That‚Äôs almost a year of 40/hr week work
---
Why would Jagex add a poll to add volcanic ash as a drop from PvM? Didn't they *just* nerf Konar's table because it was giving too many skilling drops? 
---
I think it's clear that that would be ridiculous, so hopefully they are smart about implementation.
---
That said... Prices of these two items would skyrocket if that was possible. I wonder what the cost would become if that theoretically happened. 
---
is this a rework of ur earlier idea with the tokens or whatever it was? I already rly liked that but it felt too private serverish, this is the perfect solution. Once again you've delivered an amazing idea.

Broad Bolts are equal to addy bolts in terms of strength, and amethyst bolts = rune bolts. Rune bolts have the ability to be turned into Diamond Bolts, which are better than Amethyst when enchanted due to their chance of ignoring defence. Amethyst bolts are definitely a good option for slayer

The Hunter and Thieving ones look completely fine.

People want rc to be low effort/attention 1-99, or else its "cancer" because it requires attention and slight effort. Having skills that require more attention/time than others helps filter out the lazy players from the good 99s that are somewhat decent as compared to something bad like cooking.

Because it does affect me when I play multiple accounts and some accounts get *actual* QoL updates voted down while Ironmen, who also limit themselves get massive xp/h buffs. 
---
Both accounts limit themselves, so it should be all or none for *both* limited accounts. Being unable to mount any of my boss heads because "i limit myself" is unfair when another marginalized account gets massive buffs when they also limit themselves.
---
I shouldn't have gone through your post when half-tired. If I had read it and your comments better I wouldn't have made that comment.
---
Thanks for clarifying, I agree with your suggestion, it sounds brilliant.
---
I guess you could sum it up like that. Raids do present a pretty good example of some of the most involved &amp; in-depth content/gameply designs in game. Applying some of that underlying design ethos to more areas of the game seems like a potentially good thing. 
---
Thanks man

Maybe a way to access the recolors for the dhcb would be to get a certain amount of kills with that weapon at the boss and each kill it would store a soul of said boss inside itself and then after a certain threshold it becomes filled with energy and you can change its appearance

also, nobody really cares about AHK. A lot of the high level skilling community still use AHK like they did pre-ban, they just don't talk about it openly so really, its not that big of a controversy.

Amazing thank you, man.

i mean hey when you use someones house in yanille and need to get back to your house in relleka ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è dont wanna waste xp

Man still rip that sucks!

Are you using runelite? If you are it might have taken a screenshot if you have it enabled.
---
Yeah i dont see why not, just wanted to mention that trying as is wont let you kill it, anything to reduce your negative mage bonus would work i suppose.
---
Excellent suggestions.
---
It is ironic that while skilling catalysts were suggested in OSRS's sub but RS3 devs implemented it as stone spirits in the mining and smithing rework. RS3 also has had various high intensity skilling methods like the M&amp;S rework, Cache, deep sea fishing, and safecracking. This just goes to show RS3 devs cares more about skilling than OSRS devs.

i wanna make one really bad too but i feel like i dont have enough time to actually get good.

I try to make shit myself on my main instead of buy at GE when I can though for that sense of accomplishment 
---
One thing you hit on at the start that is often overlooked is the feedback loop. This problem is embodied in a lot of different ways. For example, there are a lot of players that want skilling to be more profitable but others oppose that since they see skilling as easy. I think most would agree that chopping Magic Trees shouldn't be 1M per hour, but that doesn't mean Woodcutting shouldn't get a 1M per hour method; it just can be hard for some to envision that since we currently have nothing like that for Woodcutting. But if you mention a tougher boss with more profit, you'd have more to draw from that makes it easier to understand.
---
For the "3 Pillars", I'd say there is already a fourth. Resources were just lumped into one category, but Skilling Resources are different from PvM or General Resources. Items like Herbs, Seeds, Runes, and Hides may be obtainable from Skilling, but they PvM has always been a source of them; sometimes before they came from Skilling. We also can create new PvM Resources with Zulrah Scales being a good example, but you could also consider that a Unique.
---
Anyway, I like this draft of the Catalysts better. I still think the problem tends to be more with drop tables that overdo it than skilling resources in general, but I'd be all for replacing some of those resources, not all of them, with a 2x item. Though, I would prefer them to be a tad more unique or more generic. By that I mean it still feels a bit out of place to have multiple types of Hatchet Oil and I'd rather it be a more unique item for each tree than "same thing, dif box" or just a singular "Hatchet Oil" that worked on most trees; perhaps with the chance of bonus logs scaled per tree even. That would also open up the possibility of more creative bonuses than just 2x every time while still making them an increase to resources.
---
Trinkets are an interesting idea on how to improve the boosters. I kinda like the "storing the skilling outfit" part to allow for more outfits; if only the same could be done for Graceful... Though I feel like some of the functionality could be given to existing item or done without a new type of ore. For example, I'd love to see the return of Tackleboxes instead of a "Fishing Trinket"; it could do the same thing of storing the outfit and boosters, perhaps also bait, but it would be more fitting than a platinum pendant with a fish on it. If you went that route, each item could have its own quest or they could be added to existing content like Aerial Fishing or Trawler.
---
As for Variety and variation, that is certainly something skilling lacks. It does have some variety with training methods; if you're getting bored of one you can go do another that plays a bit differently. But most training methods still have that simplistic design without much excitement. One thing I've always wanted to see was more RNG Rewards when skilling. My go-to example would be stuff like the Pharaoh's Sceptre; it is rare enough to be sought but not so rare it seems unreasonable to get and it is a nice surprise when training at Plunder. Even if it isn't gameplay variety like the diversions you described with Trawler, rare rewards like those can go a long way. Like, imagine if there was a rare chance when mining to get a new unique gem instead of the normal gems. Or that a Bird's Nests from Woodcutting and only Woodcutting would have a unique ring inside. Even if these things are only 500-1000K, they would still be a nice surprise to help skilling feel more interesting. More varied gameplay would also be great to see, but I think that is better done with new methods than changing the existing ones. That said, I would be all for some diversions like that for Mermaid Agility.

Swampletics does Temple Trekking... blasphemy! You said nobody! üòÇ

What is the step?
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I think as you say, minigames, much like skills, have a lot of scope for improvement on both the reward &amp; gameplay fronts. Some of them already do some really neat little things that could just do with a further nudge in terms of reward or profitability, while others could do with a fair bit of TLC from a design level. 
---
Some of the points you make, especially about CW &amp; BA are very good. Encouraging &amp; incentivising a positive style of gameplay that plays towards the objective and rewards active participants is definitely a big thing that should be kept at the forefront.

This is the post we needed right now.
---
Folks, please read this and understand it. SlayerScape is more than a meme, SlayerScape represents the design path Jagex follows that eventually leads to what happened in RuneScape 3 - a path they went down before.
---
"What exactly happened in RuneScape 3"? Jagex sees Slayer is popular, that people want to train it, because it's rewarding, so they buff it so it remains fresh for people, making them want to train it, because now its even more rewarding, hey so many people are doing this specific piece of content, maybe we should buff it...
---
That leads to the issue where RuneScape 3 has literally hundreds of Slayer mobs with profits exceeding 1m+/hr, which isn't much right? Until you compare Slayer to other areas of the game, neglected areas of the game.
---
I mean shit, RuneScape 3 still has entire skills that are completely abandoned, outdated in design and barely touched since 2001. OSRS has a way more satisfying construction, agility and hunter skill. Entire parts of the game go ignored yet somehow in 2016-2017 they had new slayer monsters almost every other month. It was ridiculous, if not a new slayer mob a new boss. 
---
You can like Slayer, nobody says you can't. But if we allow Jagex to prioritize Slayer, keep dropping QoL items in the reward store and consistently making higher and stronger mobs with better loot, the chase is never going to stop. Eventually we will have 5m/hr slayer mobs while no other skill except Runecrafting can break 1m. Hell, or they'll just make a slayer mob that drops 100 noted nature runes every kill, and RCing will die alongside all the others.
---
Whoa there, that's too far.
---
Well, the other half is still unpopular though
---
Basically.

yeah, 'murica. my logic doesn't apply to all countries and education systems ofcourse. but western europe has very good schools so if you just pay attention in class, you never have to make any homework. (not that the teachers will agree, but that's a different matter)

Look how mad reddit is at you lmao

So if you use AHK to remap I to F5 so you can open your inventory, you should be banned. K. 
---
You don't need additional incentives to skill like "resource boosters", the resources themselves (ore, fish, logs, etc) should be the incentive. It really is as simple as removing the mass amounts of resources you get through bosses. This has the effect as resource boosters but doesn't introduce a lot more resources into the game.

To be fair, Catalysts basically got implemented in RS3 and they're working pretty well, so far.

Are they going to receive a cut of the profits from this? Because I designed the same concept years earlier (2015 to be exact) You can clearly see the date of the post and also you can find it through my archived history. [https://imgur.com/a/RbcPGOb](https://imgur.com/a/RbcPGOb)

The caption I wrote wasn't showing up on my blog for some reason, so I took a screenshot of the caption on another person's blog. You can use the url in the screenshot to find the actual post itself. I tried to directly link to the post but it kept getting removed.
---
Regardless I am very happy this design is being implemented but, I feel like I should at least receive partial credit for the design since I came up with the idea so many years earlier.

Though this is well thought out, I don‚Äôt think it would change the economy at all. Now if the catalysts offered something like resources to be noted, this would be very different, since it would also give an exp advantage to having catalysts. The thing that messed up the rs3 economy with a similar idea was only because they were tradeable. Adding them as drops could hurt ironmen though if they are trying to get something like sharks before having a high fishing lvl. Overall I don‚Äôt think there is a way to implement this and make everyone happy, but then being unreadable would probably be better and would encourage pvmers to do some skilling for more gp
---
So don‚Äôt go in the wildy then I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt get it, before jumping the wall, crater, hole whatever it is in whatever iteration of RuneScape you‚Äôre playing it gives you a warning saying you should expect to die. Just because you don‚Äôt have anything of worth doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get to have a free ride lol.

For a minute I thought this was the pker chunk doing an iron man series and I got hyped

The community loves to meme about how terribly dull certain pieces of content are (***RUNECRAFT BAD***), but very rarely do we get conversations about what we could actually do to make them fun without just making them easier or faster. 
---
I think a balance exists somewhere, so there are always options &amp; choices to make, without fundamentally eroding away at the core Old-School feel &amp; style of gameplay. 
---
The issue RS3 is having is that RS3 is very top heavy. Few new players arriving which means the demand for low tier ore is practically non-existent to anyone other than alchers. When 90% of players have 99 mining and smithing and can do PvM for triple the profits per hour, they don't give a shit about mithril ore and gold ore because its useless to anyone who passes 30 smithing. So their endgame bosses dropping mithril and addy stone spirits is ofc going to be totally worthless. If they started dropping the tier 80/90 stone spirits itd be a different story.
