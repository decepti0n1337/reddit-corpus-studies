Thanks for all of your comments and advice so far. I better take break from Jad for a while, it just haunts me. Maybe I try again someday with music and some booze to calm my mind.

Just remember zulrah always moves from left to right and then back right to left. Keep up with her and pray switch first then attack. You will get it. I struggled alot at first too. You dont have to memorize the rotations just remember it always moves.

Sometime during the train wreck that is RS3 they added 2 pitchforks. I think the regular one you could get for traveling to Botany Bay and the other was a golden pitchfork for participating in 10 or so Botany ban votings.
---
It's pretty good for us who enjoy training stats in a more afk way while doing other things, and don't want to be forced into doing tasks we don't enjoy (aka slayer)

The Excel spreadsheet is better because I can make a copy of it and modify it as I desire. A website is hard-coded and can only be changed by the developer (is that you)?
---
Why 45 def over 42? Just for the fremmy helms? I don't know if that's worth it. Mystics is likely better than void mage. You can check on a dps calculator if you really care.
---
I thought the same thing, if it does you could mess up a few times and keep going

It's sad, but seeing bots with 50m XP or more is no surprise at all anymore. Bot detection is truly a joke.

They stated that all Twisted League Rewards would be available from future leagues or other means if leagues ceased. They never specifically said if it applied to the Trophies or not, but like you said the Dev Blog never stated whether or not they would be unique and since introducing a new discontinued item is a big deal, that would have been specified if it were the case.
---
I do agree that the prestige factor works better if they are unique per league and I understand why you'd want them unique per league. The issue is that is not what is polled and it would be extremely problematic to change how they work post-league. Perhaps for future leagues, they could offer a unique trophy and clearly state such in the poll, but that is not what passed the poll for the Twisted League.
---
Those ppl had no effect on it lol... bh2 is hot trash and there‚Äôs no pj timers/immunity after getting a kill for how many years?

Good point on the divines. Always restarting the fight even without spec though? That‚Äôs the trickiest part to me because the efficiency trade off isn‚Äôt so straight forward.

You should use veng to speed up your kills
---
Sounds like the same reply I got on the app store. There's nothing useful on the website, this problem is clearly too specific
---
The developer is me, and this is stolen. However, your criticisms are valid and I'm going to be adding additional features with time, such as saving profiles and exporting data - things of that nature. The tool was only released within the last several days and promptly stolen - which is frustrating obviously.

I'm 3 weeks into a osrs binge after years of not playing. What is the reverted state and why is it better? All I do is Slayer all day everyday so I'm curious how this reversion may benefit me.
---
I'm working on getting my first post DS2 Vorkath kill and I'm managing with most of the special attacks. I keep getting destroyed by the range attack though and it's eating up my food really quick (I can get it to about half health). Should I be switching to pray range? I haven't been using the BGS method because switching always gets me out of the rhythm but I have 95 range.
---
I'm curious why you say RoT isn't as bad as people say it is. RoT is not just a clan that locks down revs and charges people to farm them and RWT the gold, they also commit real life crimes such as DDOSing servers and account stealing (see: mod jed, from ROT)
---
Dont have friends :P but I got an alt arround my lvl if it's possible with only one player
---
It‚Äôs not a matter of them being efficient is the thing - it‚Äôs the fact that they don‚Äôt have to sleep and they don‚Äôt care to do anything other than the task they‚Äôre programmed to do, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre pumping out 20 minute raids while they take an hour+ because they‚Äôre still going to outpace you in the long run.

I love the effects, especially Earth. Though it might need more than 60% if it is to surpass Fire spells on large creatures. That said, I'd rather them come from boss drops or such instead of being crafted. Especially since the pages are a good incentive to kill the boss and I wouldn't want to see new tomes without page charges.
---
This is exactly why I quit this game. PvP is a fking joke and Jagex has no fking clue what they are doing.
---
Got 99 str that task also and used a lamp to push over the 95 threshold. Got 4K points to cherry pick some hydra tasks from Konard.

 So here take this... :D

Well this is my third account. I have another 2 with 100/24m xp

People sell kills in BH. Not sure if there's a dedicated CC or anything. Just need a target kill + task + hotspot for instant runepouch. If not 1 kill with task and 1 without the task to get enough points for the pouch. Just be sure to bring an emblem. People around my level sell kills for around 50k non-hotspot 160k at hotspot which is a very cheap pouch.
---
deleted it for ya
---
Yeah this accs ready to be a 75 75. Even if you were already in 70s, at that high of a level fully questing doesn‚Äôt yield nearly enough to effect you. Enjoy! My favorite build to play on.

The biggest advice I could give to someone having a nerve problem like I did for my first cape is saying the attacks out loud as you switch it really helps focusing

wats ur xp to 61 att?
---
Whenever I get a 99 I do a bunch of drop parties in f2p worlds too, but I look for out of the way areas with quest or level requirements to access. My current favorite area to do drop parties is in the Dwarven Mines room with the Dragon Slayer map piece. All the beggars and scammers and other noobs that follow from the GE who were kissing up to you a second before suddenly throw tantrums and it's beautiful.
---
The snipping tool exists for a reason...
---
Yeah, the jmods don't give a fuck about PvP. They see numbers doing the content and that's all they give a shit about. They don't give a rat's ass if it's being abused.

---
99 farming was my second 99, I got it quite a long time ago and I've gotten many 99s since, but my farming cape is the only cape I have ever worn while while out and about (questing, skilling, bank standing) and I would love to be there when you get 99 farming. Just lmk when and where if you haven't gotten it already.

ok so u can remain 60 attack and still unlock piety if u wanted to 60 att 70 def 70 pray is 102 cmb maxing the str/range/mage adding 1 cmb lvl to be 74-77 pray

Osrs wiki is the best, and the parchment like background is the cherry on top.

im talking specifically about the viability of lower lvled accounts having access to post fremmy trials quests.  accounts with like 50 atk 70 str etc.
---
never said i didnt bot in the past lmao. just not for this account. i think im being punished for past offences which is bs. I'm not asking for old accounts back. Why would i bother keep making new accountd and not botting if im gonna get banned regardlesss anway. It;s level fucking 17 lmao.

If im gonna keep getting banned when I clearly stopped (that was a year ago check ur pics) why even bother

Getting loot. Been here playing on and off since 1999 and know almost every scam and still almost got screwed lol.. at least I took 6m from those scumbags. Its a shame because I can‚Äôt totally see younger kids getting tricked from these scams in hopes of coming up on some loot.
---
Apparently i was rehacked again. Re did changing all my passwords again and added an authenticator to my phone now as well
---
cheese cape too lmao
---
Lol I love seeing noobs ask dumb questions. It reminds me of my noobs days
---
people these days are actually this entitled that they don't even want to go through the *grueling effort* of making a new pure, which takes like a days worth of questing to start off and a few days of sand crabs. since then you can just build on top of what you have and progress through the builds, yet these people here make it seem like an impossible task, despite tens of guides on youtube lol.
---
and ye pvp is dead cuz there's no major incentives:
---
1) pvm is safe &amp; a guaranteed gp printer with close to no learning curve - all opposite of pvp. 
---
2) pvm &amp; ironmen get updates regularly, for over 6 years and what has pvp gotten? a couple minigames that are abandoned after a week &amp; left for dead. oh and some cosmetic rewards here and there. 
---
3) don't forget the maximum one content addition to pvp per year. 
---
4) and more pvm activities in wilderness don't count for people interested in actual pvp.
---
I mean you can calc that using a dps calc. If it is 75% accuracy without bgs spec and the avg bgs spec lowers def by 30 levels equating to 82% accuracy then the kill should be 9.3% faster. If he has 700hp and your dps is 7 then that's 100 seconds so divide by 1.093 and you save 9 seconds on average by spec'ing.  
---
  
---
That sort of calculation might help. My accuracy and dps numbers are just hypotheticals though.
---
You can do whatever you set your mind to
---
Doubt. 
---
You said yourself your top 2 skills are fishing and cooking, both highly botted on the same bot.
---
Which training spots? Ones with bots or are you looking for specific non-bot-infested locations?
---
I still need to exact same page aswell. Atleast its for the least used book.
---
Even on normal accounts if it isn't a skiller or I don't care about gaining strength xp I always barb fish to 60 agility and start at the seers course. But that is because low level agility courses really tilt me when I fail an obstacle cause I already only get like 12k xp per hour.
---
They come in as strikes but then they just get either Blocked or claimed. Haven‚Äôt received any actual strikes yet but the email is always heart dropping lol

One place I'll go is Barb village fishing spot, I'll drop a couple sets of rune God armour to get peoples attention then I start a drop train from there. I've done this for hours before with alot of the guys from the start staying for the whole thing. Throw in a few games, some roleplaying(I like to commit genocide on monsters), dick around and be silly.
---
at monks its like splashing- you wont actually get logged out. youll just stop attacking. i dont think its exactly 20 minutes but i could be wrong. think its 15~20

I have been wanting to get back into osrs, but the client doesn't work, it just wont launch, even runelite does the same thing, I tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling the clients and java, even different versions of java because I read somewhere that sometimes older ones will work, I tried all compatibility modes and so far nothing has helped. 
---
The only thing telling me what is wrong with the official client is this, 
---
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
---
#
---
#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x73c629c7, pid=7516, tid=2628

---
I might have been really lazy but googling it didn't help, I only really saw things like un/reinstall everything to repair jvm.dll which didn't help because I've already reinstalled everything.
---
And for runelite, it'll popup saying loading/verifying then close and that is it, tbh I'll see things online that say look at the logs and it'll tell you exactly what is wrong, but i don't even know where to find that so I can't even find what the cause of the issue haha. If anyone has a solution it would be greatly appreciated because I have put hours maybe even a few days worth of time trying anything I could find online to get this to work.
---
Im going to be on a flight, otherwise I'd be there!
---
Wow you got me
---
The only place untradeables break and become a gold sink is pvp, and pvp is the one place where the loot you get is directly tied to your risk, thus making it worse to pk somebody for untradeables. Their idea was that untradeables should be risky because they are very strong, instead they made it even worse to fight somebody with untradeables because you don't even receive all that they risk.
---
And most of the time they barely risk half a turd sandwich without their untradeables loot. If I pk a guy without a firecape I get a msb and 12 arrows, but with a firecape risk I get 37.5k and 12 arrows and a msb. But he risks about 35k in supplies, a msb 12 arrows and 50k.

Very high stats to enter pvp is the same argument for having very high stats to enter endgame content. You need to hit as hard as possible, as often as possible, and be able to withstand as much damage as possible. Of course the entry will be high stats
---
This is gold.
---
Ez support
---
I think you missed the "iron" part...
---
DUDE
---
Were you grinding trouble brewing recently?
---
Just did it with Rune/Ameythst bolts. MSB(I) is better.
---
It really opened my eyes. I just tested Blessed D'hide &amp; MSB(I) against maxed range armor + Armadyl crossbow with rune bolts. MSB(I) Still turned out better.
---
The reason people use welfare gear is because there is no mid tier gear. There is 300k risk and the next level up is 4m+ risk and the level after that is like 30m+ depending what specs/staff you bring, then 200m+ after that for max. Max gear used to be like a 30-50m set with ahrims and everybody not in ahrims was in mystics, but now since teams like to focus mystic kills everybody uses xericians.
---
Imagine if there was like a 1m magic set between mystic and ahrims that gave lower defence than ahrims but higher magic and defence than mystics (that wasn't 3rd age or infinity, or the more recent dagon'hai). Like a set that is farmable from a mid tier boss.
---
Dhide should still be nerfed though because it is basically the same as armadyl for accuracy bonus and defences but just way lower magic defence.
---
*nods and looks deep in your eyes*
---
Don't restart, i throughly regret doing so.
---
I went in for a bit! Not a soul to be seen, but we'll change that :)
---
Or if there was mid tier gear worth using. For range, mid tier is dhide which is already basically max range bonus, and for magic you gotta risk 4m if you want the upgrade from mystics to ahrims. There is no 1-2m risk mid tier setup. Just 40 def range gear and 20 def 40 magic req mystics.
---
Ahrims used to be max with 0% magic damage bonus on anything. Oh how the times have changed. Used to be a somewhat fair fight between highest and second highest mage gear (assuming we don't include infinity or 3rd age).
---
It varies so much depending on your skill, dedication, and gear.
---
What's the most efficient way to level melee stats up? I'm currently 77 att/def and 92 strength on my Ironman. Just got my whip, and now I'm wondering if I should stay on controlled until 99 strength, or switch to focusing on attack instead.
---
Luke 40mins of attempts and single kill trips then was easy mode tbh just focus instead of half assing it
---
the rune pouch should be made cheaper slayer point wise now that its simply 2 kills in pvp to get. 150-300 points would be very fair.
---
Why‚Äôs that?
---
you rude son of a bitch

limpwurt roots don't get increased yield from compost, only lower disease chance
---
if you want the xp from allotments, it's worth ultracomposting them since the yield is increased so you harvest a lot more of them. Avg about 60 snape grass per patch with secateurs, ultracompost and 99 farming, which is 5k xp a pop. There are 10 allotment patches (12 if you include prif)

Those other options still exist though
---
Yeah, it's not like slayer has a high APM.

This is a game full of AFK skills. Bossing and PVP can be intense but let's not pretend that half the time you're in combat with a monster you could have your eyes also glued to a TV.

There was drama in all of these months but nothing Reddit would pick up on

Why would you vote no to lootshare?

Imagine if you dced/left your poh just as the items were appearing lol

Thanks, I didn‚Äôt know that! I will probably start ultra composting my allotments then for the extra xp. Does yield increase with level or is it your cape that gives a bonus? Also, would it be worth it to compost limps? Thanks!

Thanks brother :)

New quest, calves killer

I would say it depends on their account. If they are lower levels/people without the biggest banks maybe some old school bonds would be cool. If they are high level I‚Äôd say some old school merch. Maybe like a t shirt or mouse pad.

Not bringing RoW to pick up coins? I've done that too.

Ayy sick, thank you!

---
yeah, but if you arent on that world when they are dropped you cant see them. easy way to check this is to log in to any popular spot for barraging slayer tasks, like nechs or dusts in the catacombs. you should see piles of loot that they didnt pick up, or darts used to tag everything, but because you were not on that world when the items were dropped youll never be able to see them
---
Definitely gonna go for an all-round main, as far as I can go with it at least. But I'll do some skilling or something for a while to maintain that 85cb status for a little longer 8)
---
That‚Äôs awesome man, congrats!

Hmm I dont think my friends would like os merch that much but yea they are pretty high level if that helps

No but you can make a bookshelf in your house and search to get collection log, then screenshot whichever parts you want before TL is over.
---
LMAO
---
Yes but if the guy I‚Äôm telling wasn‚Äôt actually a scammer in this situation. I tell him when to log in... he logs in and picks it up. That‚Äôs how I got the whip the first time. He said log in and the guy dropped it and it showed up instantly.. and I picked it up. I get what your saying but that doesn‚Äôt apply in pvp.
---

---
fuck you
---
Well since it sounds like you're going to need a bond again you will need to find a good early level money maker, which is hard with bots. One good way now is to do some agility, quests, and level up your prayer by guilded alter so you can collect mt myre fugi and make a mil an hour at a low level.. If you do this for 5-6 hours biweekly you can maintain a bond.

the ba world is fine, just dont team with low levels- high combat players only- unless theyre low levels decked out in ba gear.

Gotta love slayer
---
Based off the calculator provided, the difference between 60 and 75 attack is at most 1.5%, assuming no defense from the opponent. 93-94.5% hit chance off of dragon scimitar or longsword alone. 
---
My guess would be between 5-12.5% when factoring in varying armor.
---
That's not white trash at all

Living wage isn't minimum wage. Somebody working a petrol station is earning minimum wage which is ¬£8.31 for 25+.
---
(In case anyone bothers to argue, the gov a few years ago enforced a minimum "living wage" for 25+, but because its forced, its a minimum wage despite what claims otherwise. It is no different from the minimum wage for lower age brackets (16, 18, 21 for example). A real living wage is an unforced wage paid as incentive for good work or to ensure someone actually lives properly).

i dont know any mobile vpns but im sure there are apps on google store that do it.

But i cannot tell you for sure.

Nobody said that it was evidence of botting.

Ok thank you for your help I really appreciate it. How long do these ddos events go on for is it hours or days?

Your trips should be dependent on how much space you have in your inventory, you really can't really\* run out of supplies with the poh method.

sometimes my first 3 kills will be 4 super restores so I'm off to the bank other times it'll all be noted so I'm there for a while. \*Only time I run out of supplies is when my super combat and ranging pots are out
---
I've just hit 60 attack and am benching my granite hammer.. just wondering how much more slash defence than crush defence something would need to make it worth bringing? I assume my other gear's attack bonus comes into the equation here? 
---
If someone knows a calculation or equation that can help me out with determining what to use where here I'd really appreciate it. 
---
Thanks!
---
I'm not native speaker, but lets try if you want to go to assumptions: Distiction between "a" and "the".
---
&gt; Can only be claimed by players who attained the specific tier rank in **the** league 
---
In my opinion this means **the** twisted league. If it was worded "...specific tier rank in **a** league" I would take it as generalization meaning this or any league to come.
---
I did Underground Pass yesterday too, and it was the best experience I've had in the game. I feel like a large portion of the playerbase don't care about dialogue, and it's nice that there's quests anyway with that are pretty story focused.
---
How.... Why.... You.... I m so confused....
---
i'll give you a better take:"NMZ shouldn'tve existed at all"

I would take my bike to the Library, ask for a phone to call my mom. Dial membership number and rush back home to activate it.

Putting the title as decided to try this game out is very misleading as you have stated that you have played the game before as a kid and know the basics.

Yeah i would also like to see it

The problem is that the ‚Äúgold farmers‚Äù are people playing, until they do something actually wrong such as offload the gold they can‚Äôt ban them.

It's right there.
---
The attack type of the weapon (stab, slash, crush, ect) only really matters when comparing the same tier of weapon. At 60 attack the dscim is almost always best. At 65 the whip takes over but can be compared more to the abby dagger or bludgeon when looking for crush or stab weapons. 
---
This isnt always the case but it's a good general rule.

Sounds good bro. MTA was the worst thing I had to do in this game and if they ever plan to make the rewards relevant again like they tried with the book then they should really show it some love and make it more fun.

Honestly, I'm not sure. After a couple thousand kills you get a good feeling of tick rate and animations. It might also be the camera angle I use when fighting that makes it easier to notice. Pink is easy to see. Green, who cares. Blue is a possible 30 so I'll need to eat in about 1.5-2 seconds. White has a noticeable delay for the spawn but is tricky so you need to be fast (to be efficient: prayer off, use magic, prayer on). Acid phase is incredibly easy to see. The fire ball really isn't that big of a deal however with its slow animation. 
---
Something I find many people do is leave run on or run during certain phases. You can walk away from any of the attacks without worry of taking any hits. 
---
Gimme a few hours after I wake up (3rd shift, I'm tired) and I'll throw a bond on my account and record a video of me doing Vorkath while watching the latest One Piece released on Saturday. Or add me on Discord and I'll do it live on cam lmao Anomaly#0001

You might have pressed "continue with google" when you started. In which case I presume your account login would be:

All accounts have these sorts of credentials to them to be able to login to the account management webpage. If you don't remember them, try resetting your password and see which email account of yours the recovery email would get sent to.

That‚Äôs drama around the knights was deeper than that - it was a half baked quest that Wolf threw together quickly for release a week before he quit and Runefest, after saying for years the quest for a new BIS helm was in the works and merging the Serp repeatedly over that period all leading up to a shit 15 minute master quest with a sensesss reward and a shitty mechanic-laden slayer mob

What are the variables though? It's such a weird community thing where there's implied rules to fights, and the learning curve is really bad, with no real way of getting experience without going in and trying to win some fights.

There's also a big thing of the fact it's not really viable on most accounts to pk. You need to create an account specifically for it or convert an account to have recommended stats which is so annoying.

The PvM player base is very large compared to PvP player base I agree. I think that is partly Jagex's fault ignoring hundreds of PvP suggestions over the course of years to the point that when PvP suggestions do make it to the polls they never pass because all the PvPers that would vote have quit because Jagex ignores them. 
---
I think monsters are fine in the wilderness if they drop gear that ONLY pvpers would use. I have asked Mod Ashe if gear restrictions in the wilderness are even possible and he said no and would require a lot of engine work. I am confused how PvP at the current state is suppose to be competitive when the developers can't even make gear act differently between PvP areas and PvM areas. 
---
I think cherry picking people that don't PK is largely due to the fact that it is not profitable to kill someone equally skilled as you. Right now if two players risk 1m they only drop 600k on death...forcing players to have extremely unrealistic KDR ratios to break even/profit pk, which is why they resort to killing lesser skilled players.

For just xp you can focus on fruit, fossile island(teak and mahogany) and calquat trees, you can skip normal trees as they aren't much xp and they start costing a lot at mid lvl

Actually he even took his sweet time to comment on the other posts before posting this himself.

Nothing stopped him from posting this on his IG and then on reddit instead of didn't post it on reddit, he saw it was posted on reddit he noticed it got traction on reddit he commented on the post on reddit before reposting the same picture that sure he made but already was posted twice.

---
Great thanks!
---
Using max cape instead of assembler is pretty common now that divine potions are a thing. At vorkath for example, assembler doesn't give you a max hit so the only benefit it provides is 0.08 dps from its ranged accuracy. The prayer/defenses/extra inventory slot provided by the max cape outweighs that for a lot of people.
---
That is why it is working so inconsistent. I always use mobile data on my commute, any official statement from Jagex on this?
---
Thanks!:)
---
okay man, if you cannot see that you are the antagonist to this story, then I can't help you.  PvP is fun when both players have a goal and equal footing.  Have you ever played World of Warcraft?  This is like a max level character ganking someone who is still leveling on a pvp server.  When the guy leveling is complaining about getting ganked by someone he has no chance of even fighting, and the ganker is like "lul, should have played on a carebear server"  The leveler chose to play on a pvp world so that one day he can have the fun and chaos of the chance encounters in the game world outside of structured pvp content, he didn't want to increase his grind time because someone who cannot compete with players of his level got bored and decided he needed a win against someone who can't fight back.

4kc Arma helm, 19kc Kree pet then 2 days later I get 17kc arcane sigil from Corp. I posted on her the collection log but I get no likes. Hard to please everyone I guess. So I back this idea 100%
---
So dumb they just randomly added dagonhai robes to a chest without any quest or explanation or anything
---
Ok cool thanks, that's going to help my house out so much!
---
Alright thank you!
---
I think that would be the smart thing to do (it'd be an hour and a half and only 4m more) but I'm pretty burned out on making doors :)
---
Good advice though, next time I'm in the mood for a clicky grind I'll do it for sure.
---
It probably wouldn't be in as healthy of a place since PvM and Skilling also feed back into PvP. For example, the majority of Armor and Weapons come from PvM so with 95% less PvM updates, there would be a lot less new PvP gear too since the 95% more PvP updates wouldn't likely bring as much new gear as PvM.
---
And while the PvP community would be doing a lot better, overall the game would likely be less popular since PvP is more self-sustaining than PvM; skilling is somewhere in the middle. That is not to say that PvP needs no updates, but content competing against other players is more dynamic and involved than content against NPCs which can give it a more appealing repetition even without shakeups to the meta. If the only PvM Bosses were the launch bosses with say GWD and Corp (about 5%), that would not last PvMers nearly as long as BH and PvP Worlds can last PvPers.
---
Man in a room telling me I can't hide from his attack? Nomad memories instantly be like pillar time

Very nice! I'm guessing from the image and the profits you posted that it was 100% bloods?
---
Why you guys gotta do Purpp wrong like that.
---
Jagex has a customer Support? Where did i put that blasted Ring of Visibility
---
I don't see what the big deal about NMZ is. Yes, it gives imbues for best in slot gear but this is also a stupidly easy feat to achieve and only needs to be done once. 
---
Levelling slayer in NMZ is awfully inefficient and kinda dumb. I can't see anyone cancelling tasks to get a hellhound task just to go afk NMZ. Furthermore, if Slayer xp is the goal, doing your task in a place that has several other monsters isn't exactly ideal. 
---
Way I see it is, you want afk combat xp at the expense of slayer? Good, go to NMZ. You want to train slayer? Go do regular tasks. 
---
Slayer is a great skill to have and I don't see NMZ having an advantage over training combat through slayer. Sure, you'll level faster at NMZ but you get little to no loot and miss all the Slayer levels. Maxing combat first and then going to do slayer later, you'll basically lose any "advantage" you thought you had before.
---
I personally did some NMZ to get enough points for future imbues and get 85 combat in the process. After that I started slayer and never trained combat anywhere else. Currently at 115 combat and almost 99 slayer. I am sure that someone who went the NMZ route could have easily beat me to 126 combat but he would have spent a pretty penny getting 99 range and mage while I gotten 99 slayer and 400m bank. 
---
It's two completely different play styles for people with different tastes. One isn't superior than the other.
---
Will try this! Thank you!
---
Literally just shut up lol
---
I noticed in your comments you like quests OP, I really recommend going for a quest point cape. The wiki makes it easy so you can sort all quests by difficulty and slowly progress and learn the game
---
make magic training arena great again
---
This is the real answer. This monitor is set to 800x600 resolution. It's not bad to play this way unless you intend on multitasking effectively.

Cool, good thing you dont decide who stays and goes, huh?
---
Trumpets S E E T H I N G
---
Yup! I didn't want to switch to souls because even thought they are faster xp they were less afk and also way less profit in the end. I decided just to stick with bloods cause it was going to be slow af either way given how often/attentive I could play and I could use the money. 
---
I also did this without the koruend elite done unfortunately(cause I didn't want to get 90wc before starting), so if you have that completed you could expect about another 14m if you do bloods the whole way.
---
This is funny LOL
---
Yeah I have noticed that as well. It won‚Äôt save my last destination at all.

How dare you
---
Hello, about 2.3k sire kc here..
---
I started out using the POH method with minimal range switches and would only take stat boosting pots as well as 1 super restore(in-case I happen to need a sip). I also set up tile markers and used a method which allowed me to take less damage due to RNG poison spawn, which I can show you if you'd like. On average, I was getting about 16 kills per inv.

Got me there. All those scumbags training combat at nmz are surely using an auto clicker. They must be.

I think we already impeached Saradomin's teachings the moment we had a gay pride event in-game that went against the Holy Book if you know what I mean.

They will likely go down a bit on or a tad after Christmas due to people spending Christmas money on bonds.

I believe it was technically what was polled in one of the most recent ones.

Warding

Read the memo the white house released.
---
This is some real top level ignorance.
---
Just because some watery tart threw a sword at you doesn't make you the king!
---
Nah but the community does and I speak for the community
---
Probably because a lot of people fake being new for free bonds/gear. You see it all the time in those "cute noobs" posts
---
100% fake
---
Hard agree, it was cool at first but now I can't stand them
---
I agree, on the condition you give me permission to dual wield staffs too. 
---
If, with your consent I can, I don‚Äôt think this should even be polled
---
imagine being this silly
---
Your pro can be done with a Smoke Staff.
---
The good ol' sealion.
---
It should really just instantly teleport you to the next maze. And then you can just leave if you don't want to do it.
---
Nice! What level did you get pet?
---
Probably because he's promised to eat it üòÖ
---
You can turn that off.
---
&gt;Well I define it as such, she defines it as such
---
It's not, though.
---
Why can't we all get behind this? We train like bots in the dungeons like its 1997. Dungeoneering is lame as a skill but just adding dungeons to go through and earn little rewards would be nice. Slayer doesnt really make much till the higher levels, so itd be dope to get some cool stuff through completing a dungeon mini game similar to barrows or something in between. Barrows is a great starting point man
---
with 100x the price

Lol y‚Äôall are weak

i will consider it since you asked nicely

Hope you know that there are smoke staff

1. I didn‚Äôt realize everyone was raiding and solo‚Äôing bosses now. Oh wait... 
---
2. Yeah let‚Äôs just pretend DMM didn‚Äôt go on for years.. Years too long ‚Äî it should‚Äôve been canceled after the first season or two that were immediately fucked, yet JAGEX *insisted on supporting it for years, tournaments constantly setback and riddled with bugs and issues, questions of legitimacy in the tournament and the nature of grinding for days straight.. the whole experiment was straight up embarrassing. 
---
Yet Jagex supported it for years. 
---
3. That‚Äôs so far from the truth I‚Äôm not even going to bother lol
---
4. It actually means EVERYTHING to the pvp community. Your post demonstrates the popular opinion that pkers don‚Äôt want to fight other pkers. You just want easy prey to pick on and make money off of. Otherwise, you‚Äôd fight each other for your 30-60k risks, or until one player teleports away. It‚Äôs not our fault most pvpers won‚Äôt risk more than a g maul, black d hide and salad robes in the wilderness. 
---
Side note: it‚Äôs interesting to see the decline in the pvp community beginning the day of the g maul update. It truly shows how a spike in risk directly correlates with how many players choose to play the game. So many accounts considered worthless now by their owners.
---
just make sure if it does you stock up well before group iron comes out because that is going to make them skyrocket
---
What are you even trying to get at?
---
If you boof it it‚Äôs free.

I don't think people have a problem with PKing the gold farmers so much as they have a problem with specifically targeting a nationality of people to kill. Especially when we all know the environment that these people live in.

Jagex silly miss-interpretation of what we actually wanted. We asked for ability to quick travel to our last destination like with fairy rings and they gave us this abomination lol.

I believe you can right click the high alch spell, otherwise it's in the notification settings somewhere about drop / alch value.

Osrs I‚Äôm not sure, but I know in rs3 a lot of holiday items from rs2 are discontinued. Santa hats are worth like 875m in rs3.

You can boost for the altars, but you cannot use crystal saw boost for the Achievement Gallery (the room, which requires 80 Construction). So you need a minimum 75 Construction for the room

Pressing control and clicking when run is turned off makes you run.

Control and click to walk when run is turned on!

I‚Äôve been close to this a couple times but I‚Äôve always, somehow, remembered to check. My least favourite fuck up for me was when I was changing prayers on Jad and my alt account went afk giving me the runelite idle reminder in my bottom right corner so I couldn‚Äôt change prayers. Now I do Jad for slayer xp though it just takes 1-2 fire capes before it‚Äôs easy every time.

It's not worth the combat levels if your a PVP based. Rune Pures @ 42 Def are the meta right now.

I'm actually kind of ready for TL to end, the whole game mode has been disappointing to me, Zeah doesn't have that much content so it's kind of boring. I'm playing to maintain my rank at this point so I'm pretty ready to go back to my main.

What are you talking about with these free coins?

Ardy Easy (Cape+Teleport), Varrock Easy and then Medium (battlestaves), Lumby Medium (ring). From there, it sort of depends on what you like doing. I don't think there's anything else I'd consider "early game" but that should get you going!

Should I be using blowpipe or dhcb?

Big respect on the two week progress!!!!  Dm me your RSN if you ever want to play, I love hearing peoples experiences when they first see all the new stuff that's been added since the old days.
---
Yeah how tf the little guy gonna get out
---
You guys are trying to hard. Should just go with the original idea of none of these things being tradeable. People are less likely to take part in something that they can get via MTX (Sell Bonds). Why grind HOURS for a slayer helm recolor when I can just buy one. 
---
6000 points would probably take about 20 hours
---
Is that help gonna be worth 50m+? Cause I can do Zulrah and get 2.5m per hour.

GE works off a tier system so my sell offer was the closest to the person who bought my prized cabbage seed.

It's not really a solution to the DC problem though. It just gives an extra life. So if someone DCs twice, they're also done for, at no fault of their own.
---
Lool. I know what you meant guy, but the automatic elitist-chad response sure is a nice touch. Im not sure what post history has to do with tob/inferno btw lmao, most of mine is bitching about my current hydra rng. 
---
Are you so much of a snob you think someone doesnt understand accuracy? You clearly didn't understand the tone. Higher level bosses will come into the game regardless, we don't need that type of upgrade to current BiS jewelry for them to introduce new "higher level" pvm content. Thats why I thought this was funny. 
---
When you got people soloing ToB in rag gear/doing inferno on level 70 pures, please tell me how this single upgrade will be the deciding factor for jagex to implement new higher level content? 
---
Also, they should worry more about making content harder mechanically..not just another gear check like you suggest. Granted osrs can only do so much to make this happen due to how the games mechanics function, stuff like inferno are a good start. 
---
But please, tell me more.
---

you might as well play runescape

I have over 5 email addresses that I use on a regular basis for various reasons. The only 2 that have runescape accounts linked to them have been getting these emails for over a month. I don‚Äôt buy gold, I only play on mobile now with varied frequency.
---
If our information was compromised, Jagex needs to come out and say it and take responsibility. There is no way that this is ‚Äúrandom‚Äù. This is a targeted attack which the user clearly knows my email is linked to an account. The only way they‚Äôd know that? From Jagex themselves
---
Shhh just let it happen
---
Deaths are already penalty free basically throughout the whole game on non-hcim. This would only be useful for hcim, and it will never happen because thats a cheap cop out that is against the point of a HC character.

Yes

&gt;That is a founding principle of the US, "all men are created equal."
---
No it's not. The founding principle of the US was that all free white men are equal. Not a very good argument on your part.
---
Jagex, give this man permanent +2 slash attack for all this edge
---
Because, without inciting your anger again, you sound like 90% of the community that are basically bots and can't do much of the high level PvM by either being too under geared (like you not tbowing hydra), or too bad to not be able to push their limits on content; which those pures that do inferno and the people that do solo tob do. It might look easy, but it's not and requires a vast technical knowledge exceeding that for counting to 3 at hydra.
---
He botted before his wedding tho.
---
Yeah, I haven't done a random event in years since I see them as xp waste but fuck it. Others want it and it's 2019. Anyone who isn't accepting of others like my whore Indian mom who started threatening to disown my sister when she started dating someone with a 6 figure salary whose family was lower in the caste system back in India can fuck off and drop dead for all I care.

I think my opinion on wanting to reduce toxicity anywhere I go is influenced by my irl experiences, but that's another story. Besides, I only feel comfortable talking about all this since it's the Internet and we're all anonymous.

Or in terms you might better understand: l000000000l sit

It actually does. Doesn't matter at all how high the offer was for buy, only way this works is if literally nobody is selling a cabbage seed cheaper than 100k which I find completely improbable.

If you're a quest buff, you should try Rs3. I truly mean this, quests are honestly the best part of the game and this is coming from a guy who isn't a big questie.

True and rs3 has like 5 life saves or something like that. From my point of view, I'd prefer 1 life save that I save for the inevitable dc-death at the cost of making the mode harder for myself, with no safe deaths at all.
---
Imagine trying to be funny.
---
Judging from your post history, you don't seem to be the type that can do TOB or has an infernal cape. So to bring this update down to the nuts and bolts for someone that might not be too mechanically or statistically versed in pvm.
---
Every time you attack something, you have a hit chance that rolls of your total accuracy and that is determined by your attack stat and the accuracy bonuses from the gear you use, as well as the defence levels of enemies. The jewellery I'm proposing adds to your accuracy total, meaning that the devs can introduce harder bosses that require better accuracy gear (an area that currently doesn't matter that much), in order to hit.
---
waa 
---
nice stats.... (sarcasm) - https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d8w791/what_now/
---
It kinda looks like a deformed US
---
Champ shit only Snap-Jitsu
---
indeed, currently sits at 0.5$/M for anyone, possible to get better deals with certain quantities. 
---
that means people can purchase a bond for 6m or RWT for 14m if buying with USD making the price 7$.
---
Since most people have a VPN you can change location to mexico and pay 4$~ USD per bond.
---
... apparently buying bond with mexican pesos is 1.5M per Dollar, while any other payment option (beside brazilian) is more expensive. Also no point doing the brazilian way as they use a third party service to handle payments, and its a bitch to deal with.
---
Sounds like Skrillex.
---
ITT: "No, you're the angry one!!!"
---
So im thinking about reigniting my osrs addiction. Is runelite still allowed? Playing on the official client sad. Unless, did they fix it? Its been about 8 months
---
Why do none of you redditors actually read?
---
I bought one for 5.4m today. I think he overpayed a little tho yeah they are expensive...
---
Uhh..so we are counting having a tbow at hydra "skill?" Yeah, i lost 3.5b and have been farming hydra rebuilding for a while (which I'm far past rebuild at this point anyway) but its laughable that you think having a tbow has ANYTHING to do with skill level. 
---
Or because my post history is talking about hydra that means I'm a pleb who hasnt done any other content?
---
My God, you are the worst of the worst when it comes to elitist chads. Notice how you ignore 90% of my post also that explains the reason of my first sarcastic comment.

Great suggestions

okay but realtalk is there a more pointless diary than varrock? literally the only useful thing is the battlestaffs, nobody uses the jacket for anything except runite mining on the elite reward

Nope. I'm pretty sure I'd hit 11hp or 12hp if I tried. I've seen a few others with it and dark bow at 10hp. Others I've seen ended up with 13hp whilst getting it.

Can you make a video of the trade history? I honestly don't buy it my friend but I am willing to concede if I see video proof that you actually sold this for that much

He literally has been impeached. The senate determines removal
---
I would definitely argue that bonds used to be significantly underpriced (and arguably still are). 2.9m is like 200k a day. Aka like 30 minutes of rune crafting for a not at all decked out account.
---
6m is still totally negligible lol

That's not what the dev blog said. If you read the post, it specifically mentions that "some" rewards will be tradeable before following up with "We will not make discontinued rewards with leagues." They also stated they would make the trophies [available elsewhere](https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectTameElkWoofer) but in today's tweet said they would be unobtainable thereafter.
---
His presidency will just be a skid mark on the underwear of history, this impeachment just caps that off.
---
Gay people aren't political, the event itself was political, that's a big different IMO
---
You can run for me lad
---
My guess is that the longer the game is out, the higher level the average player is which means that they have better money makers available. Richer players means people are able to pay more for bonds
---
Who cares, its an untradeable item with no use but to show off an achievement that a player earned, not an item that should be carried around by everybody and end up boring dead trash like most other cosmetic stuff lol

Donald Trump Was Impeached
---
My man if you‚Äôre worried about $11 then you should probably not be focused on video games
---
Senate determines whether he goes to TRIAL. Do you realize how flawed the system would be if it was literally just "hes impeached now lol"?
---
Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate. Therefore, Democrats could impeach ANY president they fucking felt like. You're an idiot.
---
No he‚Äôs literally impeached. He hasn‚Äôt been removed from office but he‚Äôs impeached.
---
Maybe you should take your own advice and learn before spewing nonsense.
---
The signet saves a lot more money (~4x more) if you use it with the armor and bow/halberd/blade while in combat, however it's simply not worth it currently because berserker ring (i) and archer ring (i) are better alternatives. If the Blade of Saeldor were affected by it, and the shard saving effect doubled, then we get to ~100k/h saved territory, which makes it a lot more appealing.
---
Personally, I expected the Elven signet to be released with a 10%-25% shard saving effect, so I was quite disappointed when it was revealed to be 5%. I wouldn't mind if it was buffed to 15% or even 20%, but then I would've inevitably gotten accused of merching it.
---
I‚Äôve had an idea for a osrs meme for a while. Can you please make one that says ‚Äútelegrab her by the pussy!‚Äù
---
Do whatever you think would be funniest
---
Sent
---
Impeachment is strictly in the house you dingus. When the house votes on the articles of impeachment with a simple majority the impeachment is complete. Afterwards the house sends those articles to the senate for a TRIAL which is different from impeachment.
---
Dont tell people to take a civics class when you clearly are uninformed. Impeachment is complete. Plain and simple. Now we await the senate trial, if that even happens.
---
Lol
---
To some people, getting hard-to-obtain items count as "completing" the game. Trophies look cool and can be added to your PoH - they're desirable items that are unobtainable for some people. You don't get anything in-game for being world-first at something. If you did, people would also have a problem with that.
---
nice try OP you're not getting my gold coins!
---
all you get with ornate is wealth since you can mount glory elsewhere
---
It kills me how shit they are at the game in general. I just feel like it's a facade cause nobody can be that bad..
---
Lmao this comment. You‚Äôre the one who needs a Civics class. Trump HAS been impeached, the Senate decides on removal. This impeachment will forever stand as a presidential impeachment, the articles have passed. Whether he is forcibly removed from office or not is what the Senate decides...
---
Holy shit I love this community
---
Upgrade them into master clues
---
I'm not going to quantify opinions by tallying various social media posts - that's my point, this is what the poll booths are for.
---
I'm not saying the trophy system makes sense - I agree it would kind of suck to have repeated, non-unique trophies. But that's an issue with Jagex's communication. They stated several times no discontinued items would be added, then added them halfway through without a poll. That's the issue, trophies are just the specific.

Apparently the typical righty doesn‚Äôt understand that impeachment is the process he‚Äôs going through, removal would not be the actual ‚Äúimpeachment‚Äù itself. He has been impeached, he has not been removed from office.
---
only the top 1% can get dragon each league so not everyone will ever be able to get it

No but like seriously he has been impeached...
---
THIS IS GOOOOOOD
---
I hear you, thanks for checking. My point with the original post was where else have you used the _emails_?
---
If you think that Jagex has had a breach, isn't it equally as possible that another company that you signed up with this email oh so long ago had lax security and had their users leaked?
---
Ohoho Beautiful, simply Beautiful üëå
---
3m pure gp a trip
---
Duuuude nice
---
I would separate this question into two:
---
When to do boss slayer? Whenever you feel like doing a variant. Blue dragons task? Make bank at vork. Greater Demons? Zammy. Black demons? Demonic gorillas. You can do this whenever you feel up to the challenge. Like you mentioned, doing sire can be fun if you get the demons task and wanna do it.
---
When to unlock the "Like a boss" slayer perk? In my opinion, you should only unlock this when you're done "grinding" slayer xp. It's tedious when all you want is a burst/cannon task to keep having to kill 3 bosses to keep the point streak up or skip and waste points. They have a high weight. I would unlock it once you're at a slayer level where you don't care about grinding xp, typically this somewhere in the level 95-99 range.
---
The media is reporting the fact that he‚Äôs been impeached. The senate will determine whether or not to remove him, and they probably won‚Äôt, but regardless he‚Äôs been impeached. Please take a civics class.
---
Meh, at worst if people get annoyed it just becomes one of those posts that gets buried in new. You can only annoy people by making a proportionally much larger amount of people enjoy your content
---
4-5 hours if you do it in one sitting.
---
Its strange that they couldnt decided this themselves before the post that they needed to poll it. then its strange again that after they decide they cant decide themselves and they need to poll it to then not poll it XD
---
????
---
Sure it‚Äôs just a fancy indictment, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen?
---
As someone who specifically got 99 magic and has 99 crafting and almost 99 con banked specifically for this reason, I feel personally attacked.
---
It has a 50% chance to not use the bone. It‚Äôs the same xp per bone but you basically get 2x the amount of them.
---
I really doubt it's either. It's probably just shock humor.
---
I was thinking that too, probably too late to have a theme-coloured trophy each at this point cuz i feel like itd need to be changed to a white dragon. But it'd leave a lot of design space for future trophies. (Lava drag for wildy league, Metal dragon for karamja league etc)
---
Yet they didn‚Äôt impeach any president they felt like, they impeached Donald Trump
---
That exchange was delightful
---
Having the spade equipped should make any right click on the ground have a dig option
---

---
That‚Äôs incredibly stupid. If I have a maxed main and make a level 3 and bot on it to farm gold, my maxed main should only be banned if I:
---
1) Trade the gold from the level 3 bot onto my main
---
2) Sell the gold on my bot (rwt)

57 smithing and 61 mining, also nearly 50 slayer and 60 cb skills lool 2 weeks? Someone who knew what they were doing right from the getgo would struggle to get this progress from scratch in 2 weeks... I'm really skeptical bordering on straight up calling bs
---
Regardless let‚Äôs bump it up to 100k an hour, my point still remains
---
Can't believe people are actually upset over not being able to purchase a reward that distinguishes an achievement in something they either didn't partake in or bother to achieve themselves.
---
I'd day this is a pretty accurate summary. However, the Senate is often referred to as the upper chamber of Congress given its structure and powers.
---
I'm sure Jim loved it!
---
Impeached =/= Convicted. Hes been impeached already

GP being worth less is a product of inflation but all inflation is is an increase in the overall price level, which is driven by high demand or low supply. A bond being more expansive while having the same function and quality as before is essentially the definition of inflation.

Im not opposed to something on between but its really not necessary. Like someone said, fire cape was the end game hard as fuck challenge from 2005 and there was no in between. Inferno is just that for this era. The fire cape is easy af because we have 14 years of meta development and guides a long with more powerful shit. 14 years from inferno, inferno will be the same way.

So I'm the U.S. there's the idea of checks and balances, that the three main branches are co-equal and have different responsibilities. One of those is that the executive, of which Trump is the head, most enforce laws passed by Congress in a reasonable way. The law we're interested in is one sending money to Ukraine. Congress said, send this money to Ukraine at this time for this reason. The funding was not, however, sent at the expected time and it wasn't until a complaint was filed by an anonymous whistleblower that Trump was withholding the money to Ukraine in order to compel them to do something for Trump that the money got actually sent. Now that in of itself is a bit of a dark gray area, as how you enforce laws is something up to the executive. Once Congress got wind of this, it started investigating what exactly Trump wanted from Ukraine in order to give the money to Ukraine. From the evidence provided, Trump asked them to announce an investigation into Hunter Biden, who had done some work in Ukraine. Trump wanted the investigation announced, but it from eyewitness testimony Trump clarified that while he wanted the investigation announced, he didn't care of an actual investigation happened. Now, back to the impeachable offense. From this information, Congress declared that Trump leveraged his power in the executive for personal political benefit by withholding money to Ukraine until Ukraine helped him attack one of Trump's personal opponents. So not only did he not fulfill his job by enforcing laws passed by Congress, but the reason he didn't fulfill his duty was so that he could personally benefit.

Show us
---
&gt; The Senate is not an "upper house."
---
Don't take "upper house" to mean better, in other countries like me in the UK (honestly don't know how the US system works completely) what's called the "upper house" isn't called so because it's on a higher level or more powerful than the "lower house", what's called the "upper house" is generally called so just because it's smaller than the lower house, usually less partisan, has longer terms and in most places actually has less power. I think the US senate does fit the definition of an upper house, but like I said that doesn't imply its more powerful or higher.
---
From what I understand, the only times in the past that the house of representatives has voted to impeach, the senate has also done so (I could be wrong). Which I guess would leave US politics in uncharted territory when it does happen!
---
I agree, I just don‚Äôt use my emails for very much. The fact that they‚Äôre both going to 2 emails (one of which gets rarely used) is definitely suspicious.
---
I‚Äôm assuming that if there was a breach elsewhere, I‚Äôd be getting spam for a lot of other websites as well. My issue is that the only spam emails I get are specifically RuneScape related, which definitely suspicious.
---
But I also see where you‚Äôre coming from too, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Just that it‚Äôs too much of a coincidence for me to think it‚Äôs any other breach. I don‚Äôt use any RuneScape websites or fan websites with either email, so the only link that both of them have to the game is through Jagex. And the emails come in at the same time from the same address, so they are both coming from the same source.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd just like to get to the bottom of it. If there was a breach, I‚Äôd like to know about it.
---
Say what you will about Jagex regarding eoc, but prior to the year or so before eoc, Jagex had the best updates for culminating and retaining a strong community. Pengs, SC, clan system, clan cups, assist and effigys etc. made it so easy to make friends. Everything in OSRS does the opposite of that, there's no sense of community comparable to rallying up dozens of people for an SC event or chasing penguins. Everything has been optimized to have as little interaction or need for community as possible. Bloody shame

Bitcoin is a highly speculative currency with no backing of any currency exchange, like how the USD was previously exchangeable for a certain amount of gold. It's just not comparable. If you look at rs3s economy, a bond is something like 20m, I don't care to check but the point is inflation can just keep going for decades in this games economy.

its also linked to the black market gold price which has crashed lately so bond prices go up

This is what I was saying was going to happen back in 2016, these idiots have cried wolf too many times and wasted any opportunity they had. They went through with the vote knowing the Senate will shoot it down, all in a hope to remove him from a 2020 running. If he‚Äôs such a shitbag, why not just beat him at the polls? He‚Äôs soooo unlikeable, so why can‚Äôt he just... lose?

Guys this was a joke please stop
---
It‚Äôs significant because it isn‚Äôt baseless, it‚Äôs backed entirely by solid evidence that Trump was unwilling and unable to refute via testimony. It‚Äôs significant because the House of Representatives ‚Äî the branch of congress that more accurately reflects the will of the people ‚Äî has concluded that Trump committed crimes that breached his oath of office. If that isn‚Äôt significant to you, I‚Äôm confused by your priorities
---
Oh, then you‚Äôre right. Misunderstood what you were clarifying.
---
No witness disputed it because the Democrats quite literally were blocking witnesses from testifying.   
---
The 'witnesses' the democrats did bring forward ultimately gave just their personal opinion and hearsay. Neither of which is evidence. They also got torn to absolute shreads every time the Democrats failed to be able to completely stop Republicans from asking questions.
---
And, yes, it does fit the definition of hearsay; If I hear from someone else you did something, that is objectively hearsay.
---
It's not viable. Best way to train attack without gaining any other combat xp is cleaning finds at museum (~2k xp/hr iirc) and you wouldn't even be able to do that because of the quest requirements.
---
People want to be able to put in the effort when it is convenient for them. If someone creates a new account with the goal of getting every offhand I'll sincerely worry for the mental health of someone that cares that much about it.
---
Yes they will be unable to, that is why it is limited edition. It allows people to have special relics from when they could and would put in the proper effort. Limited edition items are extremely common especially in MMOs and the are only not well received by people who are entitled. I will literally never be able to get the realm first titles for Wotlk or the black qiraji mount, nor will I be able to get the egg ring and scythe on the main game, and I am FINE with that. I won't be receiving ANY of these trophies either.

The amount of money doesn't matter.  I wouldn't spend $11 a year for what's essentially an overcomplicated cookie-clicker mobile game.  I literally only play it to pass the time while I'm taking a shit or riding in the car.
---
I'm fully aware that it was effectively impossible, but it wasn't literally impossible. It's a distinction that can change the appeal of completionist goals for some people. It sounds especially frustrating when the reason you miss an item is because you couldn't/didn't play at a certain time.

Usually when people say "children's game" they don't mean a game mainly played by teenagers where the youngest people who play it are 13. I am perfectly aware that teenagers are minors.

People usually don't refer to Halo and CoD as "children's games." for example, even though they were mainly played by teens in 2007. Its usually stuff from nintendo that is called that.
---
"I don't care enough to donate to Venezuelans, but I at least have  enough sympathy about their situation not to report them" is a consistent view that is not self contradictory: It means I only care a moderate amount about them. 
---
The definition of hypocrite is probably a bit too complex for you to understand I guess :) its alright, many people have trouble with english, especially if its not their first language.

Ok the idea is tempting but, again, completely impractical. Would you burn a tbow to turn it into a consumable item for which you‚Äôre paying &gt;100,000 gp per shot? This has nothing to do with you wanting an item sink, it‚Äôs all about having more powerful items to make the game easier. It‚Äôs not that tough and if you‚Äôre having that hard a time, I‚Äôd recommend a new game or a private server.
---
Nah not really, I think that's a pretty common thing to do. You lose a small amount of nuggets I think like 20% of what you spent. If you just want the coal bag though, it doesn't matter.

No that's not what happened, Republicans got  to call witnesses, they had no real arguments against any of the witnesses that were called - just misunderstandings about process,  and the president has admitted to all of it so there is nothing in the impeachment based on hearsay or unconfirmed stories from others.
---
I miss people trying to have fun, &amp; minigames (they go together). Theres like no fun stuff to do with friends. Its just min max no xp waste. and Summoning was cool I loved having cool minions. Was op but for its time was really cool.

Alternate theory: they go when they need to and every NPC and player in runescape has poopoo-pants. It's the normalcy.

I mean runescape in the general sense has been around as long as wow. There was a weird little transition there from rs2 to rs3 and then osrs, but whatever. It's been almost 20 years.

---
What is this about entitlement?  If someone wasn't playing at the time of the release of said mount/achievement and they want to get it they can't.  There's no way for him to get it anymore because they've artificially put a limit on the item.  They could put in the same amount of work and not get the same item because they didn't play when it was relevant content.
---
With GDPR they can be forced to reveal certain things now. There was a guy who was banned for using a third party tool on WoW, he filed a request for all his data, it showed that he was detected using using a program called "" (an empty string), so it was just a bug in their system. Got himself unbanned with that info haha
---
Reading comprehension really isn't your strong suit huh.
---
\&gt;I think one side thinks that this game isn't ruined by RWT as gold is still very difficult to obtain, I haven't seen the economy crash since the Venuzuealans started being talked about on Reddit.  
---
\&gt;I think most players that are like the grey golem's face are of the opinion "see no harm, do no harm" I've never had an in game problem with them.
---
The problem is that's not a correct assumption.  The consequences of RWT are mostly invisible but they're there - botting and gold farming is the main reason that skilling/common pvm is almost completely worthless as a source of money, and even bosses have to be put behind arbitrary fences in order for them to sustain value.  As such, it's not really true that RWT is harmless - it's almost the primary reason the game's meta has evolved as it has, and is at least partially responsible for a lot of the reason moneyscape and boss-scape are synonyms.  I'd slate that whole dynamic down to one of the primary things people are frustrated about in osrs.
---
When confronted with this, people instantly jump onto the "of course starving children are more important than a 'stupid children's game's' balancing!" (I quote the stupid children's game part, the other absolute brick that walked in assumed I myself was calling osrs a stupid children's game).  Which is a fair point - but what people don't realize that is that excuse can go a long way.  
---
After all, when wouldn't starving children outweigh how fun or unfun a game is to play?  In that frame, the game could be completely unfun to play and that would still be justified because of fucking course starving children are more important.  
---
So if we're introducing this can of worms, then shouldn't helping starving children way outweigh your desire to play that game you (not you, transitive you) just called a stupid children's game?  If you introduce the "starving children" logic, you suddenly find that there really isn't much involving this game that isn't less important - even the ability to play it.  From that point, just not playing this game and using the time to help a charity is barely a step.
---
That's the thing - most people going around grandstanding about this issue are suburban white kids with an illusion of a conscience where they're willing to believe that "of course videogame concerns are outweighed by starving children" as long as they're not actively aware of the videogame concerns (back to your whole "people don't see what's wrong with RWT").  But if suddenly a videogame concern that directly and visibly affects them comes into play (like being able to play less osrs because they work for a charity) - suddenly the starving children don't outweigh anything anymore.
---
It's this skin-deep virtue signalling that's kind of disgusting to see.  Similar to how whenever a crisis like in Venuzuela or somewhere happens, people in 1st world nations are super on about "why isn't anyone helping these people?".  However, those same people often balk at the idea of having to themselves accept even a relatively small amount of refugees from said countries.  
---
If you're gonna wield starving children as a moral high ground, you better be willing to stay on that high ground when it affects you more directly, otherwise you're the worst kind of hypocrite.
---
I don't think I've reported many if any people in game, and as the title says, I don't intend to target pk Venu farmers in the wildy.  I'm just here to see how the people making a lot of noise about "nuuu dun report the Ven boi" would react to the logical continuation of their logic.  The answer, as you can see, is not well.
---
\&gt;I think sacrificing your free time to help a country you know nothing about is a little far as well.
---
I think it really is - when one would have spent that same free time to play that same videogame that matters 1000000% less than starving children, according to them.  Also, do you think those people would be willing to sacrifice that same time for a country they know about?  :thinking:

If it was about the rewards you buy with points, then why does it state " any tradeable or untradeable"? All those items are tradeable, so this clearly was a blanket statement referring to all the rewards, including the trophies.
---
It already exists.
---
&gt;How do you not realize shoving shit downs people throat will not make them sympathize with your cause and will only make extremists. 
---
As opposed to what? Never making a statement? Not demonstrating for your cause at all?

It's amazing that you think normal people would see a Pride Parade and come to the conclusion that they need to kill people.

That's why Pride Parades came into being, to protest and get heard, not to hide and pretend not to exist.

That is the point, they put in the effort during the time it was meant to be put in. Not to mention the natural progression of the game makes it impossible for someone to put in the same effort as those who obtained it originally. They don't need the item, they didn't earn it, there is nothing wrong with not having it. It encourages people to do the content when it was meant to be done.

Reality has a well-known liberal bias, so conservatives are forced to lie. Republicans would still suck Trump's dick after he fucked their own grandmothers in the ass, and we both know it, so what the Senate does won't change the fact that this is the most corrupt and second worst President in history.
---
*Worst will always be Andrew Jackson, who ignored a Supreme Court order so he could continue a genocide in violation of treaties the US Congress had ratified with sovereign nations.
---
Personally, I don't mind this from a completionist perspective; as soon as the trophies based I knew that would be another headache for true completion. My issue is they stated they would not add discontinued items they leagues and now they decided to do just that without polling it to the players. If players voted on making them discontinued at the start, that would have been fine, but it is extremely bad for them to make this sort of change midway in.
---
It‚Äôs more of an addication than loyalty. Jagex is like big tobacco and we all have cancer.
---
They said they would be untradeable. They did not say they would become discontinued items however. They actually said nothing would become a discontinued item.
---
But regardless of your opinion on trophies, the bigger issue is pushing through game changes based on social media feedback rather than polls. **That** is the true slippery slope here.

It is not a matter of "who to believe". Untradeable is not the same as discontinued. They said the rewards would be available from future leagues; they never said the trophies would be excluded so it applied to them as well.
---
Were u using runelite? Don't see how ur time could be that long if you weren't using the MTA plugin.

Well, I don't think anyone's going to give a fuck about the trophies personally.    I just remember when I started wow and saw the Zulian tiger and thought hey that's a pretty cool mount.  I looked it up and realized I'll never be able to have it. It was disappointing at the time but then you realize everyone just uses the strider anyways.

Banning the person playing hasn't worked out so well for Jagex in the past. They tried that with wildyowns1 and he managed to get other people banned by mirroring their streams and pretending to be playing

There's really no way to reliably do it without too many false positives

i thought they are already untradeable.

Looks like you deleted your own comment but I was giving insight. Not my job to offer solutions or fix the problem. No I‚Äôm not a throwaway mod account look at account history maybe?

Losing brain cells here reading your comments

why waste time googling something you already know for someone you don‚Äôt care about who won‚Äôt take the time to look it up themselves

In my opinion, it would be beneficial for you just to knock out getting graceful right now. It may take you a few days but once you get it that should take you to level 60 or so, which will be helpful with a lot of quests

If there was and it wasnt from your ip its generally considered your fault aswell as the creator is responsible for the activity.

Good luck on the appealing process.

I see god I up vote

For me, if PvP is enabled, anyone is a target. Don't care about any of that other crap, because it's just a game.

Don't care if it's a 6 year old burn patient with stage 4 Melanoma with a history of sexual abuse who's logged in for make a wish foundation to get his first and only kill in wildy before he dies. See you in lumby goblin boi.

I don't see why there'd be an increase in supply for consumables. So shouldn't all food, potions and runes be skyrocketing?
---
Or at least following bond's steady rise.
---
Some more popular consumables are skyrocketing (like sharks and brews), but that seems to be related to something that happened early October (BH rework?), which don't match the bond's increase. And other items like prayer pots, super combat potions, runes and anglerfish have been reasonably stable.

but sir, i have this legendary sword from an icyene

You are correct it was Andrew Johnson, and neither he nor Clinton were removed from office by the senate. They served the remainder of their terms and then did not seek reelection, though Clinton couldn't if he wanted to since it was second term.

The Zulian tiger is obtainable in the game it is sold through the black market auction house if you obtain 9.9 million gold you can wait for it to show up and buy it. It is also the perfect example of a mount that is impossible to put in the same amount of effort to obtain. Also striders are outdated now that you can water walk with all mounts.

tried thieving, but it was too click intensive
