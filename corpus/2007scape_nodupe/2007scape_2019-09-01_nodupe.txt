If you have cash spare sure but id get armor / prayers first

Expects randoms to pay him to steal lmao
---
Yeah man get a clan, try the forums or pm me for the clan I am in
---
Sure, but so is every other specific RDT drop for Sire. In fact, it's the most common RDT drop apart from 3k gp, so I wouldn't worry about it. It's around 1/46 to hit the RDT.
---
I want to say there's a clue that requires you to kill a Cyclops

---
lose the guardian boots

blessed d hide boots for range set up
---
firecape, zerker (i) and d boots for melee 
---
super combat pot and range pot
---
you dont need the brews
---
whats with the staff?
---
GOAT art style no cap
---
That's a pretty big assumption, if you buff 5 you'd have the chance of 5 big hits potentially being more dps, or if the hits are lower you'd take less damage total
---
This guy is a troll. Downvote and move on
---
Good on you, fam. Causing IRL pain isn't worth it for pixels tbh!
---
When you see someone cosplaying as a girl at the GE.
---
I do max coal and the rest on maples, the coal pretty much covers the daily 75k cost and the maple logs and birdnests are just bonus. I dunno how efficient it is but its self sustaining.
---
That's kinda what balancing is about..
---
You wouldn't happen to be going?
---
You need none of those pages
---
Wait you dont have to complete totem to get new one for ghe skotizo boss?? Nice torag body btw.
---
Bots didn‚Äôt ruin your spelling skills though...
---
Is this from farming a certain box that‚Äô drops the clue scrolls? If so which one? I am looking into doing this.
---
Nice loot btw
---
no but try a timer on your phone or use the runelite timer
---
clues
---
must have been a hell of an adventure
---
Doing 1 kill per trip without flinching (buy bludgeon if u can) is faster than trying to get multiple kills per trip when ure flinching.
---
Yeah basically.
---
Bruh you really had to do it to em
---
These look so good, almost like they are made by a professional.
---
I use it...
---
 get a torm bracelet and an ances hat. then get sang. 
---
get an imbued heart before like any of that though
---
You close your looting bag.
---
Yeah - eclectic impling jar for medium clues and gourmet impling jar for easy.
---
medium should be more profitable in the long run, but if you go dry for rangers, it require some starting cash

---
The better method is still the ape atoll method. I'm not home to make a comparison, but it's basically just arceuus spellbook with rune pouch and your cash and house tabs. You cut 25 teaks, house tab, butler make, then ape atoll teleport and run to the trees.
---
While I can't properly estimate it since... Well, I'm not home, running from ape atoll tele to trees is less than 20 seconds. I was getting around 700+ planks per hour, and that was when I wasn't paying attention.
---
Higher requirements for sure. But much better regardless.
---
And thats why people keep everything
---
I blurred because i saw everyone do it...
---
Thought is was due to security reasons...
---
You slash the web apart.
---
Explain how to get to captain Khaled.
---
That's been a mention for years. You could easily dump them to a main for bond money.
---
Only reason I ever go to grand exchange is to decant potions. Just go elsewhere and don‚Äôt get so fed up by one persons attempt to annoy you.  
---
If your trying to grind out some firemaking levels, Draynor would be an alright spot to do so. I‚Äôve also come across quiet a few irons cutting the oaks and willows near east Ardougne bank.
---
I must say that some rocks were loose and I almost fell on my face. Luckily my 99 agility instincts kicked in :D
---
Both look like sticks someone found in the woods, but different sticks.
---
 Could also be the opposite, that someone is overwhelmed with so many goals and they legitimately don't know what to tackle first.
---
You would like to. However if the Bot nuke is anything to go by, it's more like 60% of players are either botters/have botted.
---
mounted digsite pendant would free up 2 spaces :)
---
Player sells something for 100k and receives 90k and he wouldnt notice?
---
Taxing duel arena is great but a tax like this makes early progression for main accounts a lot longer in the long run. 
---
Unlike where the duel arena is a place where wealthy enter and poor leave due to their own greed the GE is a place where everyone comes to buy supplies, equipment and other things they require.
---
To add insult to injury the system of a 'max 10k' tax you propose will not hurt rich rs players but rather the poorer players.
---
All the negative comments aside, your bank is pretty insane. I wish mine was even a small fragment of it lol
---
It depends on what you care most about: Graceful tokens, money, experience, or AFK-ness.
---
Graceful tokens? Keep doing Seers until you hit 80 (at which your token amount will be reduced to 20%), then switch to Relleka until 90, then do Ardougne until 99.
---
Money? This one is extremely subject to change because it's based on new content with volatile pricing, but the Prifddinas course gives you the most money/hour if you have the herblore level to make divine potions (216k/hour with 74 herblore for ranging and 323k/hour with 97 for super combats). If you don't have the herblore, then it's the same as graceful token progression. Also should note that the Prif course at 74 herblore is the same gp/hour as the Ardougne course with the elite diary done.
---
Experience? Werewolf arena. I'm assuming you don't like that course for some reason since you haven't been using it, so #2 is the Brimhaven arena and #3 is Prifddinas, all the way to 99.
---
AFK-ness? I see a lot of people saying this one is less afk than the roof courses, but in my experience Prifddinas requires the least attention. Most of the obstacles are tightrope walks so pretty much every click is followed by 4-8 seconds of animations. You'll just need to glance around every time you finish an obstacle to see if a portal spawned. I personally found it much more palatable then the Seers course.
---
My personal preferred course is the new Prifddinas one. It gives more experience and money than any of the rooftop courses, and is much better suited to watching/reading something on the side than either of the agility arenas.
---
The extra pages sure, but all the trimmed and god sets you have to hold onto until you finish the set if you want to store them. The bottom 6 rows of his clue tab are all things you want to store in the house that can't be stored until you finish them.

not to appreciate it, no; but to critique it you need some level of understanding of ironmen

Good

Hopefully with more posts like this we can slowly move away from the suicide taunts. I know a lot of people consider it to be nothing but a throwaway insult but to some people it's a dark constant reality. Be nicer to your fellow scapers. You never know when someone is going to log off for the last time.

2 was much easier than 1 given it's incredibly linear, 3 I remember doing on release was fun to do but I think I got help by just being in a clan chat you had a lot

With your stats, no, it‚Äôs not better anywhere

Thank you :)

Damn I missed it by almost 8 months :/
---
Players sit at the guild and afk at work or while watching netflix
---
OS mobile and an auto clicker from the play store. 
---
U can set lots of different click spots on the screen and change the duration between each click. Perfect for alching.
---
Why do the multiplier scammers all wear that same outfit? They just sit around GE waving that fan...
---
Also, I got 27k from one of them. Their "deal" was "quitting rs trading 10% of what you show." I'm an osrs noob, but knew my way around scammers from playing back in '08.
---
So I put up 278k gold(everything I had) and they offered around 27k and accepted. I took my shit out and they didn't re-accept. Tried again a little later and this time they accepted after I removed my gold. So then I had like 300k. It feels good to scam a scammer, just be careful about it.

it's not like jagex would see a difference if you set up an autoclicker to click at random intervals or some kind of physical contraption to do the same thing
---
I imagine both are bannable but autoclickers seem to be detected less than other bots

Yes, you, too will have the ability to have the most basic and unimaginative aesthetics

Phone verification. A text message like what Google does.

Seed bank in farming guild and storing some sets in your PoH would free some space. Also why have all those pages when you can just get the book and alch/drop the pages to your main for all other duplicates?
---
That‚Äôs sick! I heard it‚Äôs around 1/2,000 drop rate for normal gauntlet and 1/1,000 for corrupt. You gonna keep or sell it?
---
It really is, we've had some good new mods join, but seeing the great veteran mods leave is a big loss for the game and community.
---
It saved a bank slot.
---
The book can be alright, but once you're out of the early game you already have a million teleports and it's just a waste.
---
One minute is not worth the bank slot lol.
---
Do you have other pvm wtuff like dwh, bandos, Kodai, rigour, prims/pegs ?
---
It was for the cake day
---
That‚Äôs what I wanted to know...
---
Riggity riggity rekt m80
---
If you have super combat potions, you don't need 1, 2 or 3 dose of attack, strength and defense. And keeping any stack of super combats when you got the prif version right below is another blatant waste of 3 slots. Can just keep 1 set of 4 dose super combats in that case for when he needs to make more. Same applies to the ranging potions.
---
Does the bank look pretty? Yes. Is it actually efficient? Nope.
---
I get goosebumps when I think of OSRS without Mod Ash.
---
Aw man. I hope it get it before :/
---
That's a hoarders excuse if I've ever seen one
---
You fucking mad man you got infinity boots twice
---
God pages 24 spaces alone, farming tools into leprechaun, seeds into vault and start farm run there, package barrows sets, etc. There's lots of space that could be saved, but people rather cry for more bank space lol
---
Would be cool, but will never happen.
---
That it's true, but I don't think that getting the membership this early is worth it, that's why im trying to get to 750 total, to get the membership.
---
woooosh

Finally?
---
I have a pretty late game ironman and the organization of this bank is at a level I could only dream of

She drained OP‚Äôs wood

The dude isn't his friend and was probs 100% serious..
---
Haha no worries!
---
C
---
I know I‚Äôm a bit late but here is what I gathered when I finally got in.
---
Wiki EVERYTHING. Seriously. Even if you think you know about something look anyway. There is always tidbits of info there.
---
Set some goals for yourself. I have a long term on and several shorter term ones. It helps keep you focused and not scattered all over the place doing a hundred thing super slowly.
---
Do lots of questing. A lot of them are good starters because of the xp they give in completion (waterfall quest and the likes).
---
Finally money making. I‚Äôm going to assume you are going to live bind to bond like me. I like to focus on money-making for a few days until I have the cash stack for a bond, then wait until I need to buy it. This lets me secure membership quickly while also giving me cash to work with if I need it. Extra wealth I use for gear upgrades.
---
Methods. It‚Äôs harder at lower levels but blast furnace is a good one. Get your smithing to steel bars and get ice gloves and you are set. Graceful is also helpful here. (Side note: graceful should be an early priority. You can usually have it by 50-60 agility if you really go for it). Barrows is another great one but requires some better stats/gear.
---
Finally, DO YOUR DAILIES/RUNS. This is things like Garrick battle staves, birdhouses and farm runs. Especially at lower levels these are a great boost to your cash stack.
---
Sorry if this was long but I tried to include a bit of everything. If you have more questions, PM me and I‚Äôll do my best to answer as soon as I can!
---
F in chat bois
---
Nah it‚Äôs not
---
This, I am in the process of learning solo raids atm, since I am permamuted and can't ask people lol. 
---
My RSN is: Roflmfao No
---
use graceful + best prayer gear + pray preserve. the pies will last 90 seconds instead of 60.
---
What?
---
Niggas running through the hood with jordans on can expect to lose 'em &lt;insert joy emoji&gt;
---
You‚Äôd still get banned for that. The system picks up the pattern. It‚Äôs gotta be random sporadic clicks to go unidentified. Neat idea though
---
I read that after I posted it. Can I get your discord? If you want, I have several videos of solos. I could also look at your vids and see what you're doing wrong if anything. I'd be glad to help.
---
Shh youre disrupting his unpopular opinion
---
God damn did you just type that all or did you have it prepared? Either way I‚Äôm glad you can still have fun with the game!
---
I personally don‚Äôt agree that being muted makes you a cunt, I was just clarifying what that other dude was going on about - I‚Äôve been chat banned for a collective 1000 games on League of Legends so far. I deserved them all :)
---
\&gt; Breaking down his sentences into simple one offs like a year 1 paralegal doesn‚Äôt make you seem smart if you‚Äôre not reading the whole scenario. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean, I think a 0th year paralegal or a 2nd year paralegal or any human being not trying to white knight for a wrong opinion on the internet will also tell you that the guy is a victim throughout the scenario.  Enjoy your unpopular opinion though.
---
\&gt; He seems generally malicious and shows no remorse for it. It sucks to get dddos, but to spread it in such a targeted area doesn‚Äôt make him the victim it makes him an accessory at the very least. 
---
If hed rather not be ddosed at all hes not the accessory, sorry.
---
Why are you being a cunt a simple I disagree would suffice you psycho
---
you're everything wrong with the game, fuck off nerd
---
the god pages are necessary and packaging barrows is inconvenient. Seed vault and tool leprechauns are the only thing I agree with. Also, no one would complain if there was more bankspace. You shouldn't have to drop valuable god pages just because the space is limited. It isn't something that makes the game easy scape it just actually makes for a much more fun playing experience.
---
Remindme! 1 week
---
Def 10 in herb.  I personally would do Teak or mahogany given your relatively low construction level compared to your stats.  Smithing, I personally bought from blast furnace, so ore wasn't that relevant.
---
I have a discord but I don't record. My pc has a hard time keeping discord open and the client alone. 
---
I am not actually "running" them atm.
---
Just trying out rooms, etc, trying to get an over-all feel for it. 
---
I have stopped all of that for the next day or 2 to try to get my granite body for kandarin hard, idk how to do barbarian assault n I just want to be an attacker #2 and have someone carry me rofl. 
---
Sucks being permamuted, can't do lots of social stuff.
---
That's the issue unfortunately. And then also, there are considerations with pvp and the wilderness. But it is nice in some situations.
---
Such a great cosplay! what did you use for the chainmail? looks so accurate!
---
We didn‚Äôt even loot it
---
Yeah I know. But dont ruin my fantasy üòÇ
---
IMO people who give generic answers like diaries, quests and slayer aren‚Äôt really being helpful at all, even if they don‚Äôt like the question. Best advice I ever got was to pick small goals and kind of fold them into a big one. RFD does that really well. You want better combat? Do some slayer and work towards combat skills at 60 and do Monkey Madness for a scimitar, and free the monkey for RFD along the way.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new, as in first time playing was the mobile release, but stuff like diaries beyond medium feel really far away when you look at the wiki and see a shit ton of skill and quest reqs. This game has a lot of content and it‚Äôs overwhelming if you don‚Äôt compartmentalize it somehow, and I think a lot of these posts stem from there being an overwhelming number of choices.
---
Lmao that's nothing special. I'm 3.5k dry, no pet, no visages, only 1 necklace and too many heads.
---
You deserve my upvote
---
Just playing devils advocate here, but I don‚Äôt see any proof that this belongs to an iron man nor any account for that matter. 
---
No history of osrs posts before, and just a bunch of bank pictures stitched together. Color me suspicious.
---
How exactly does he perform right click actions so quickly?
---
I never got muted on league of legends... I played it from s4-s7..
---
Black market brawlers was the best mini-game, check out the "flesh-ripper" I remember using it on tryndamere during that event and it was literally not fair.
---
If you're still looking for ideas go look up "smallexplamp" or "raikesy" on youtube, they both are currently doing series where they start from level 3 in f2p and earn gp to buy their own bonds and maintain membership the way you're doing it.
---
Both fun to watch and you might pick up a lot of good ideas :)!
---
Oh no not 3 hours of moneymaking, that is real pain
---
Thank you for your input.
---
so that would be situation A then? cool ty

Bots didn't ruin your ability to reply to the correct comment though.

At least someone‚Äôs proud of you

It‚Äôs not huge exp at all compared to chinning. You could get 86-95 in one session of chinning compared to weeks of vorkath

I think theyve done that already, and nobody played it. So they took it down
---
I think ogress shamans are free to play if you want to try killing them. Good way to train range or magic early on
---
Ignore that other dude, get your slayer up, once you hit 72 and 75 the money will come (wyverns/gargoyles)
---
I feel BASALTED of your use of RS3 on the OSRS subreddit.
---
You think the meta is for people to ask about their account in public on twitter accounts that normally give hijackers information on the accounts they're enquiring about. Ok.
---
Jagex pay your employees before your game turns to shit.
---
your username is the real tragedy here
---
Majority of people don't report :(
---
I wish Jagex let you know when a player you reported was dealt with.
---
I've reported so many people/bots and I'll keep tabs on them. Often no punishment seems to be dealt and it makes me wonder if there's any reason to even report
---
Yea this game is forever stone walled into the player base it has now. It'll never grow.

I spent 10 hours there trying lvl 5 on all including fighter torso with a group of 5 on discord.

Doing raids on mobile isn't a disadvantage, when you get used to the alternate control scheme you can maintain competitive DPS.

Saw this dude, absolutely amazing. Sadly didn't see any more RS cosplays
---
I remember never caring until i went to swan song and needing 4 iron bars, mined 9 iron ore and put all my ore excitely only to fail each time. Woe and behold, i had to run back 7 more times to pick up more iron ore since it kept failing. I eventually ended up using 4 trips of 9 iron from shit rng to make 4 bars, i know it was a bit of a outlier, but it did feel kinda dumb lol and on the last one the other 5 bars smithed. Fuck you game.
---
Block that virginity yo

Lmfao this deserves gold

The tears on social media, they make the rest of us PvMers look like pussies but it's funny to watch
---
I want some lol
---
Not really a question, but what are your favorite quests?
---
The vast majority of quests (especially the ones with low requirements) are a slog of back and forth paddling, so I wonder what is the consensus of the players. Not only experienced quests have a more thematic vibes overall, but they also have more stakes at risk (actual dangerous enemies and shit).
---
I just loved Underground Pass (which I beat with 2007 account). Just progressing in the cave alone, far away from everything, was so intense. I wonder if there is any other genuinely good quests.
---
might just fuck around and do it
---
I honestly wouldnt mind the rs3 update being ported over... maybe making 99 Smith t70 or t75 though instead of adding t80 and t90.
---
Is there a reason you need 2 brine sabres???
---
If you are a genuinely new player you really have no idea what to do because there's really a ton of shit just like back then; we mostly just fucked around all day being inefficient cuz we didn't have a proper plan
---
Of course we wouldn't know that now because we're literally playing it for the second time
---
Why fired?
---
I‚Äôve had some pretty bad dry streaks. Hang in there. My longest dry streak was 473 of getting an unsired lol
---
Exponential growth.
---
I'd guess it would have to do more with updates than just player count. The problem with HD is it wouldn't just be a large update to make, but it would continuously require more artists so they could keep the same pace of content with both graphics modes. So if we got a point where players didn't want more Devs and QA to produce more updates, even QoL kind of stuff, then it would make more sense to look into stuff like HD.
---
Put an authenticator on your account...
---
yeah i could never go above 800, i can barely play as is lol

Looks straight out of a 2008 RSMV

I wonder what Ash gets paid. I have no fucking clue what I'm talking about but I'd guess like $80k USD (¬£90k or something?).  He has to be a high demand person in the MMO Dev world but he stays.
---
Firemaking is quick levels, so yeah you might as well burn the logs unless you wanna save some for fletching when you get mems.
---
What were you trying to do? Maybe I can help?
---
pick his pocket

I wish. Your new task is to your selecting. I'll choose 1k abby demons to start.

I just started the barrows grind and it bothers me that He still hasn't gotten all barrows items but has all the rest, I hope I don't go super dry on items
---
OSRS without Mod Ash = Rs3
---
Why are you a guy using a female avatar and name? Feels super clickbaity
---
Honestly the best advice is to Google quest Cape requirements. Start knocking those off. Then complete all quest go from there.
---
The only disadvantage is the chat box making you misclick olm, other than that there's nothing that really affects your performance unless you include 3rd party plugins like dropped items and overload timers  
---
Fix the chat bar and raids would be as ez as pc
---
SotE and DS2 are fantastic
---
I wouldn't go with that scaling rate, but I'd be down for this. I recall RS2 did something similar, but I feel like it capped at 85% or something. TBH, I'd be down to just make it 1% per level past Iron or similar; perhaps 1% per level until 75%, then 1% per 2 levels? Then you'd hit 75% by 40 and 100% by 90. And let's be real, I'm probably the only player who smelted iron into the 80s and 90s... And even with this update, I'd still have used Rings of Forging so it would mainly be for those early levels.
---
Ouch why gamble that much? Aside from go big or go home.
---
He's a very senior member of Jagex having been there for so long so he likely makes a generous salary. Glad he has no plans to leave, he is an incredible dev and from what we have seen, a great person outside too. He works with some charities volunteering time and I believe financial assistance in an accounting sense for them, in a band and other things I probably missed. We are lucky to have someone who genuinely cares about the community, players and the game as well as interacts with players as much as he does.
---
Thirsty ass.
---
That's because iOS suspends apps in the background after a short period to try preserve battery life.
---
 You have a ton of useless cosmetic items or supplies you‚Äôll never need for anything
---
No. Only 4 dose potions are used. Anything else can go into a junk tab where they can be decanted once the player is done using those potions
---
Jagex should definitely cut off the polling system. It's going to be the death of the game.
---
Then take a full one next trip and decant whatever's leftover

I have 84 con and basically got maxed everything for the house. No menagerie cause I have like one pet, no lectern/study since I buy tablets off GE, and no obelisk since I dont pk so I rarely go into wildy.  
---
The best setup would probably be keep the 3 rooms you use most to the west, north and east of your entrance portal, for best efficiency. I spent a few million decorating and noticed the load time is like a second slower but its worth it to me. I like the aesthetic even though a empty house loads faster, its not worth saving 1.4 seconds or something to see a sad home.

In my opinion, it's only worth it if the current load time for your house bothers you. There's always a way to be more efficient in this game, but max efficiency usually comes at the cost of having less fun IMO.
---
Anyone got the template to this?
---
I am the shadow on the wall
---
ok
---
Who gives a flying fuck if there are millions of users on a platform when you are looking to get a problem resolved, you know where people that have a problem with the game might also have an account that they can use? Fucking runescape, let people use that effectivwlt inatead of ignoring them unless they make a twitter account. Blizzard has proven that a game company can infact have a working customer support system without using twitter or reddit so why is jagex so money hungry that it can't be fucked to sort out their shit in order to try and give the people responsible for their income a reason to stay.
---
Yeah going 10k dry on an ironman sounds way better üòÇ
---
H
---
None of the rewards passed the poll except the cape for winning games but they were all added to the game anyways. I really don't get it.
---
Unless you have bis it is not worth it
---
Wat ep is this meme from?
---
That chainmail is insane, good work
---
Fuck no
---
well arma has other benefits besides dps boost. arma has high magic defense and if you're doing something like vorkath without void you're going to take a lot less damage, since vorkath is primarily magic damage (unless you mess up a mechanic).
---
IT SEMLLS LIKE BROKE IN HERE
---
Addy darts at a minimum, ideally rune IMO. 500 darts is more than enough I think I usually use 300~.
---
Nah
---
99! Just go until you need em! The grind never stops!
---
It‚Äôs a hidden reward unlocked after completing goblin diplomacy quest
---
Did you take the fairy ring or teleport to barbarian Outpost?
---
F2P Range-2h Pking is very simple and fun!
---
Use the seed vault
---
Oh god lol...
---
"Dr." Phil is not a good person. he is technically a doctor of psychology, but he has no license to practice and spouts fraudulent opinions
---
Oops totally forgot to mention I'm a HCIM.
---
Alright, fair enough. No clue step is ever gonna use single god book pages though, and once you've built the STASH or completed the set and stored in house, you've freed up space. If you're worried about clue stuff taking up a lot of space you could always grind clues until you've got most stuff, at least the more common items, completed instead of just doing a clue every now and then.
---
Woops forgot to say I'm a HCIM...
---
Lol so you're proving my point. There is no better option that kharedts memoirs. The only other way is 3 teleports and a ton of running. Thank you.
---
I don't blame them for not spending money on customer support. Since they're spending it all on bot detection
---
&gt;one minute
---
And if you do almost any medium clues, saving a minute hundreds of times is pretty helpful.
---
Nice
---
You can buy them from Ali Morrisane after completing part of the Rogue Trader miniquest
---
Hello friend
---
Wow something else than IGHT IMMA HEAD OUT
---
Its very rare so its in between 1/1024 and 1/5000
---
His answer was
---
"Teleport to house, hit pool, spirit tree to Port sarim, run to veos, click to piscarillius, then run to captain Khaled". 
---
Like wtf
---
Not anymore, this was added a few months back. Can stack up those pieces like nobody's business now
---
Aren‚Äôt you looking back by being in this sub?
---
Thank you for your service.
---
and a girlfriend who looks like ROADKILL
---
Okay?
---
For the vast majority of ppl who do raids its not really a disadvantage esp if ur good at raids.
---
We live live in Germany, it‚Äôs a few hour drive!
---
it's clearly blue and black not white and gold.
---
Tonight buddy
---
?
---
I was just listing the uses, it's bis at all those places, so it's pretty versatile
---
Op are you having a stroke?
---
I fail to see your point. I‚Äôm not sure if you even see it
---
I like the memes, haven't played the game in over a year.
---
click on the lock icon before taking shit out of bank and no presets will be left
---
He is, the wiki says his title is video producer so it sounds like more behind the scenes stuff.
---
70k an hour after 75 RC and thats tick perfect, and there are so many different movements to lavas that tick perfect is really hard to sustain. Before 75 lavas are realistically 40k and a normal person even after 75 isnt going to sustain anything better than low 60s at best.
---
honestly don't know. that is still a link to the real runescape site. sorry I can't help.
---
the only thing that would maybe make sense as a phishing email, is that they somehow got that specific link from jagex that would reset your password and then sent it to your e-mail. which also doesn't seem possible
---
is the mrjones email your email? can you post or pm me a screenshot of the email?
---
Yeah I've seen people screwing around at WT and saying dumb things but never anything as toxic as telling someone to kill themself.
---
Im not saying make it easy or afk, and im not even saying give it good rates. Im iust saying acale up the rates so that you‚Äôre not getting the same exact xp rate for almost 12m xp.
---
Slayermusiq is great but I prefer SnuggleQuest videos, hopefully more come out
---
How long did it take you to get to 61 agility?
---
Maybe 10-12 hours? I didnt really track did most of it on mobile
---
&gt; should of visited Ardoyne
---
Grammar has logged out.
---
After I quit dailyscape all I do is just CoX and nothing else lmao. Cba even with tears of guthix. For some reason either all I do is dailies or I don't do any at all.
---
That's some juicy rng right there. Congrats!
---
Those are way too spooky 4 me
---
He literally paid $10k out of his own pocket to pay woox for being the last survivor in a DMMT
---
Ooo thanks! shaved off so much time.
---
Yeah it's annoying he used poor comparisons to push his narrative. He didn't really do anything evil, I'm just annoying he fucked the market up.
---
Got trash drops up until 192, pet and dchain just to get head at 194. Might continue to 256 for slayer helm recolor with the pet alongside
---
It won't really stop them at all, since it's f2p lol. 
---
My suggestion would just to make all f2p rewards untradable. Make them cosmetic only, then the f2p bots won't have a reason to go f2p lms lol.
---
&gt;not a grill
---
No 12k+ upvotes for you. &gt;!Really nice cosplay though mate, the items really look true to OSRS.!&lt;
---
Thank your for the feedback! Next time I'll try to either cut the video shorter or speak more in between. :)
---
1-77 is depression, 77-99 is a nice bank and a fat cock
---
do just bloods, souls isnt as afk and the xp rate is barely any more
---
Don't worry about it. You're playing the game like it's meant to be played. 
---
This efficient members questing start is for experienced players making second accounts. No reason to overwhelm yourself with membership right off the bat.
---
I never said I was a smart man.
---
You sound like my boomer dad at breakfast talking to the newspaper articles.
---
Your post makes no sense, just wait a minute and you can login
---
They have complete control over the company
---
OI OKUYASU, Za duel arena erased my cash
---
I enjoy all the roles that aren't defender.
---
Did the same shit with the ‚ÄúLet me in‚Äù meme. It‚Äôs all the same lazy DAE DOORS shit
---
It's worth doing agi a lot for an ironman in the beginning, as you need to go to more places on foot (for example, you just discovered the price of laws, also can't buy teletabs) and do more skilling requiring lots of running.
---
Oh whoops. I forgot to mention I haven't tried to login but once. It's been an hour, I feel like someone is trying to hijack my account.
---
The wife!!
---
Fishing, cooking, firemaking and woodcutting. Should all be pretty quick even in f2p. Can probably get 50 in all 4 without it taking too long, then maybe some range and combat to get to 500 total. 750 would take alot longer tho.
---
Yea I was gona rush agility and some thieving to get started and prob slay along the way.
---
So, while obviously a bot issue, I'm not sure the seller is being as aggressive as it appears.
---
There are common bots, especially on f2p, who will repeat whatever another player types into chat. My guess/hope is that they're just copying that.
---
25 buttholes did a great video a while back on it, and he also found out they can obey commands typed into chat and he attempted to take them PKing.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Just give it back
---
Pump up the jams
---
Goals af. Wish my bank looked like this on a main.
---
With the arclight in hand it's an easy fight. Without it you spend like 2/3 of your time killing eyes
---
Thanks! :) https://youtu.be/Oix3tgfr01A 
---
I made a video of it
---
no im in NMZ right now trying to imbue an archer ring lol. ill let you know how it goes after though cause zulrah is the next thing im doing once i get the points for the ring.
---
And then there is me with 400kc and no rares.
---
That‚Äôd be much easier and I agree. Plus native Anti Aliasing
---
Accurate. For the elite diary you really need to just find a group that is willing to hop on discord/teamspeak/whatever and just play the game for an hour or two.
---
The lengths theese entertainers go , oof. They deserve a raise. Give the troll an agility cape or something.
---
Botting seems to be taking control again which is a shame.
---
Is this course worth switching to after seers?
---
Thank you for your detailed help :), i will look up youtube videos just to make sure i am 100% prepared since as said by Pika\_DJ it is an instanced fight with no possiblity to reobtain my gear if i die.
---
So in your opinion i don't even have to have greater demons as task to use the slayer helmet bonus then?
---
Sarachnis and Barrows. Also if you get your mage up you could do Zulrah.
---
100k bots a week that already farmed gold for a day and dropped it off at their local mule :)
---
No u
---
Summer pie maybe?
---
What's your Agility level?
---
No you both
---
MM2, DS2, RFD, SoTE and Cold War.
---
Do you login with email or username?
---
Pretty sure you only need to kill him up to two times, since the only options are you get it or you don't.
---
Was a 4 Hour Trip at a whole.
---
BCP, Tassets, Boots, Godsword shard 1 in my friends name
---
I got the tassets and the other shard.
---
Overall around 150 bandos kc.
---
The path is different for everyone. You sure you're going the right way?
---
oof agreed, I'll blame it on my friend
---
Good man!
---
Yes. Can also boost with imbued heart, magic potions, etc
---
I just skipped the line and used a macro that targets a quest enemy. I then bound that macro to a hotkey and a loop macro to my mouse that clicks as fast as the game ticks allow. I can press my key and go afk while letting it run to tag it first. I play with friends so they kill the mob.
---
I'm not waiting for 2 hours to get my quest done.
---
Thank you! That's great news for me.
---
From medium clues
---
More like up to 4. 
---
Either you get the clue drop or you don't, and either you get the Boots drop or you don't.
---
Well I've seen ftp... They clearly aren't banning enough of those lol
---
I understand the sentiment though. Members bots are still members so they ignore them. Sadly that feels like it's true
---
Theres a Falo step for Masters that requires the Torso, it sucks big time
---
Bro if you're trying to strike at pkers as a joke because you feel bad about the fact that you can't get a girl for the life of you I'll get myself an Uber and come to your house and smack your face you are one of the least manly most cry babyish men I've ever met in my life hands down. If I ever see you talk one more thing about pve vs pking on reddit I'll personally pull out your tampon and run the menstruated blood on you prematurely occuring bald head. Do you copy? Non pking ass bitch.
---
Can confirm I created a Twitter account *just* for osrs customer support. I'm sure I'm not the only one either
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
when i wass new i did blast furnace. slayers pretty garbage at low levels
---
I'm entry level at 36k, it's gone up alot recently.
---
This is wrong. Need 75 rc, 67 magic, and lunar diplomacy. As well as pouches and eternal glory
---
You do realize that Jagex has had VC funds investing in them since 2005, right? Jagex hasn‚Äôt been making money for themselves for a long time, these past few years with China are nothing new.
---
Legit question regarding your last point: how? How does someone have their day ruined by a bot?
---
My bad gang I had f.lux on
---
This is great

you know samsung has multi app for a long ass time now right?

y his eyes shut lol

How is it that you manage always saying the most stupid shit possible? It's a legit talent.
---
ToB/BA leeches
---
Cut gems, alch dragon armour, clean herbs. Bam loads of bank space.
---
I started RS in 08 so osrs would have way more nostalgia for me if they did upgrade to HD graphics.
---
Nah, just in time.
---
Yeah. Its been common for agggeeesss now.. Twitch doesn't ban them fast enough and more pop up instantly. Not much can be done besides making sure people know about it and hopefully not too many people fall for it
---
I'm glad to hear. I've been hacked before and they bypassed my two step authenticator somehow.
---
Looking at all these comments and seeing how cut throat everyone is to anyone who even slightly deviates from their own world view. Can't imagine why Devs would want to leave this paradise of a community!
---
bonds op!

Even without it‚Äôs still 60k+

Best place

1 hour with them vs. like 6 to 8 rage inducing hours on my own

What in the world of runescape

This is very underrated, thanks for making me laugh
---
"bUt rUnE CrOsSbOw hItS WaY HiGhEr"

they could get some players mod the game for free instead

You're just merching us, Gherkins, SMH, this is a lie and has no meric!!!!!

IVP are American.
---
I don't, I just lost my ability to enjoy another games because of this one.
---
Stupid as fuck to block them they‚Äôre literally the fastest slayer xp ingame.
---
&gt; Kill chaos druids in low wild. Pick up valuable herb drops like ranarr
---
Aren't there also chaos druids in the taverly dungeon he could kill without having to go to wildy?
---
Didn't he go to wow classic?
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Close enough to 99 that I don‚Äôt particularly care. I‚Äôd rather do tasks I enjoy
---
Isn't collector even easier?
---
Yikes, this seems familiar, if rs goes under again I won‚Äôt be surprised.
---
It's almost like you fell into his trap
---
They are guardian boots you noob!
---
Runelite in GPU mode with skyboxes and smooth animations looks pretty good I think. Keeps the old feel but makes everything a bit more crisp and modern
---
Thats almost 10 years ago
---
I knew you were gonna come out with some smart arse answer but I thought I better learn anyway
---
Or just join a clan and watch some guides and do it in 2-3 fun hours with friends.
---
Use nothing but this for slayer, 70k xp an hour afking and you actually make profit on average
---
Because it's possible. Coming from a design standpoint, and a server space issue is the only issue facing this change. That and 40 hours of work for one person. They absolutely can increase the bank space, it is not a deep engine change, it is adjusting values across the board in code, it is not changing the basis of the code beyond adjusting numbers.
---
So even though range attack bonus and range strength is less than half on msbi the faster fire rate results in more dps?
---
Karils xbow would like a word
---
Using the same setups as above, around 110 Defence. But if you give the MSBi setup full Arma, BGloves, Pegs, and an Archer's Ring, that changes to about 308 Defence (with 0 Range Defence Bonus)
---
zz
---
Hey where you at bud
---
You jelly?
---
I wish that gear discord had stuff like this for bosses instead of just telling you to bring 1-3b worth of gear and an alt to every boss.
---
What‚Äôs going on there?
---
That too was not ideal
---
use lower temperature/power
---
I didn't get my first zenyte till 800 something kc, I got so many of the cheap unqiues though, which sucked.
---
If all you're looking to do is get a granite body, you can just straight bup buy one with gp if you've got your torso already

More like 3, only one of the possibilities enables the second half of that. So you either get it or you don‚Äôt and then if you do get it you either get it or you don‚Äôt
---
Maybe so. Maybe he likes keeping clue scroll items especially? I keep all mine. But, I am just now beginning to experience bank space shortages myself, so that may soon change.
---
BA was actually fun, pest control is a piece of shit mini game that gets old really quick. But takes hours just unlock 1-2 of the void knight pieces.
---
Cheers man. I'm not an iron but if I was I'd be loving life
---
regular abby spectres are still afk but faster
---
May I ask the total value of your bank, fellow btw?
---
Agility isnt click intensive lmao
---
Maybe not day ruining, but if you've ever tried to mine on a f2p world, there are stacks of bots on every decent mining spot. If you're low level you have no chance of beating them to mining the ore.
---
I thought your comment was funny
---
STASH units can be built to hold those items. They are located right next to the clue spot
---
They've been generally fairly trustworthy. There are some people that create accounts to mimic them so they can scame people but the bots usually keep going.
---
worth a shot, but the people who get my account always change the email. I assume by account appeal because they have my old password. So I've always assumed changing email wouldn't really work
---
I want to find the stats on my og runescape account, was called mohrs0 but I sold it and the guy changed the name. It was pretty close to maxed last time I checked
---
There's also the fact that there's ongoing discussion even as recently as the last Q&amp;A about how to give the pages further use. So hanging on to them at the moment may turn out to be worthwhile.
---
Turns out I don't love msb for no reason after all.
---
as /u/_crossroads_ mentioned, a Slayer task would boost your damage output, but isn't necessary. Skotizo is NOT as difficult as it looks. Emergency teleportation, a bit of focus and you're good to go.
---
One factor is to make sure you complete each hard clue before you kill Skotizo again, as he drops a hard clue 100% of the time. That is, of course, if you'd like to complete clue scrolls. If not, then you can ignore it.

nigga you ever try and go mining iron ore on a f2p world or get you some clay with your steel pick axe?
---
I didn't expect that amt of people to show up. Got a heavy ballista out of it, I'll take what I can.
---
*twitch*
---
This disregards how you have to pay a hell of a lot more for Rune arrows being lost more rapidly than Broad bolts, and you give up Prayer bonus at the same time
---
For high defense you need the extra ranged bonus from left setup. It's only in low defense areas that the MSB shines brighter. I use it in NMZ in lieu of TBP and can still get like 80k exp/hour.
---
I'd say upgrade to amethyst arrows since you'll primarily be using an ava's device with it so the cost of ammunition is not as significant.
---
I simultaneously HATE this person and AM this person
---
Yeah you use BP.
---
And I have used msi in fight caves
---
I'm just jealous of almost everyone in this sub.  Been playing since OSRS release and I only have a bank of 19m
---
Substantially
---
It would be much better for jagex pr if they paid woox directly instead of through ash
---
Thats not how that works but go on
---
Thanks for the support!
---
Nah, a portion of an ark map is modeled after these though
---
They‚Äôre fishing bots for karamja lobsters probably if they were using the deposit box.
---
Left handed Rune Scimmy confirmed
---
Guys got a ‚Äúhandful of quests‚Äù and your first thought is DS2? Huh.
---
With amethyst arrows but not tbp?
---
all the more reason for Democratic Socialism
---
Crystal bow
---
I didn‚Äôt quit I just buy bonds with Runescape
---
Money. I‚Äôm just not paying irl money to play the game. I‚Äôm not going to financially support them if they aren‚Äôt going to take care of other people. Thought others would join in but I guess you guys like not having customer service.
---
I don't actually think rcb with broad bolts is ever better than msb with rune arrows, given equivalent gear. Not sure if I did the calculations wrong or something, but every scenario I tested had the msb beating the rcb, even if extremely narrowly.
---
Mission failed, we'll get em next time
---
I always wondered what the female OSRS players looked like, now I know.
---
ironmen actually do kinda often
---
I'm currently going for the achievement cape, and I have got all the required noncombat levels. Now, I have to grind slayer from 71 to 93, getting 87 magic in the progress. This is what gear I own:
---
[Melee](https://i.imgur.com/fX4mTPl.png)
---
[Ranged &amp; Magic](https://i.imgur.com/9YFDco0.png)
---
I own a quest cape, a maxed house, elite void, slayer helmet (i), and a salve (ei). I'll own an assembler as soon as I grind the last 10 vorkath kills, and a fire cape as soon as I get the task. I *do not* own rigour or augury. I have about 100m in cash. Which gear upgrades are the most important for me?
---
It's not known, it's a lot of people anyways. Look already this comment has been downvoted, because people are too ignorant to actually realize the problem with the game, subsequently killing their own game.
---
Tbh I don't even know if that's part of the equation. How many players would they lose by investing time into an update that maybe a chunk of players don't want?
---
That said, I'm a person who's fine and loves the osrs graphic. But boy even if they just made this login screen it would satisfy HD wanters and people like myself.
---
Fan art for the login screen is nice and all. But this panning camera of the world is a real sell.
---
crossbows can use enchanted bolts, which is where the majority of your damage comes from
---
Ok you're just nitpicking now. Obviously we're talking about the situation as it is currently. Also the popular instanced bosses all have buy backs for stuff lost on death.
---
If you have an ava's device, always use amethyst arrows. The cost per shot if using amethyst is around 40 gp which I think is pretty cheap even for unprofitable tasks.
---
Is the healing from blood spells limited by my target's hp? For instance if I roll a 20 but the NPC only has 4hp left, do I heal 5 or 1?
---
A giant guinea pig you uncultured swine!
---
The next lesson is that you matter and it's going to be a great day!

It's good advice still
---
It‚Äôs not inconsistent if he consistently does it.
---
Could take a while until then, but will certainly update as I go!
---
You‚Äôd be interesting in building etc?
---
Yeah, I'm familiar with World Edit too.
---
V
---
I didn't know this. That is a really big hit.
---
Probably the best dog you'll ever learn to love. The name is capybara, and he gives far more than he takes.
---
Probably not. It's  a question of opportunity cost of darts/scales
---
Dude is asking for what he can do with range being his highest stat. Vorkath is the best thing to do for rangers. I get he has a handful of quests but he should definitely prioritize DS2.
---
A
---
should of made him derault avatar, that guy is epic
---
Does this mean msb(i) with rune arrows is better than rcb with diamond bolts (e) for zulrah?
---
I agree with the other guys that responded. Go for all F2P quests and their reqs and you‚Äôll be fully ready for members.
---
That‚Äôs what I did when OSRS released. Didn‚Äôt know if I was gonna get invested again so I kind of ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the F2P game and still wanted to play so got membership.
---
I don't get it. Like would fault anyone for taking better paying work? Fuck, I know of I was working a moderator job and someone offered me a similar or higher rate where I don't have to take constant community shit, I'd be taking it in a heart beat.
---
There is actually a place in Northern Ireland called Ardoyne, and is pronounced the same way as Ardougne
---
I decided to go ahead and share this with reddit since it only worked on this one guy. the rest of them started telling me to bank the implings. I assume they are all friends or the same guy or something like that.
---
Takes me back!
---
So what do you recommend for something like arma where Pretty much all guides say to use chins / acb ? 
---
Your recent posts have been blowing my mind since I never usually delve into stat comparisons !
---
You can't get aids from looking at tabs you might have had anal sex while you were distracted
---
Gonna binge watch them all again from the beginning wish me luck guys.
---
Yes, I don't believe anyone has gotten banned for it but when people tweeted Ash and JagexSupport about it, they said they're looking into atm and you use it at your own risk.
---
nice
---
Thx dude, will try
---
Is msbi with broad arrows &gt; rcb with broad bolts
---
i thought that was dovy
---
Patience.
---
greater than 75% of the playerbase: you think you miss this but you don't
---
Yes because everyone enjoys playing the game like you
---
Are those marks of grace he's feeding him?
---
Source?
---
Uhhhhh... Ok lol
---
Jagex is too cheap to fight bots, theyd rather use outdated software that barely catch auto clickers
---
Neg
---
Pobresito lol. Only to find out it was, in fact, he who was the pobresito. Dumbass
---
Yeah I've seen these scams a lot, they also usually refuse to fight people who bring fletching capes etc, person asking how is it a scam is probably the perfect target for this type of scam lol.
---
My bank looks like this and I just use the search feature with RuneLite tags. But tbh I wish I took some time to organize

Ahh alright thank you! Now I understand.

nah it doesnt work anymore only worked once. i knew if i brought supplies to make a bow that they would choose no weapon switch because i had tried it the other day, i brought supps for a bow and they declined me and re-dueled with no weapon switch on(this being active makes it so you cant disabled any combat styles). i banked and came back with runes and they told me to bank the pouch so i figured there wasnt anyway to trick them, i assumed any possible trick had already been used and known about. i dont even remember what made me think to bring implings and i rlly didnt think it would work, i was baffled when they accepted tho honestly i was laughing pretty hard.
---
I had to check if it was really fathers day...don't do that
---
no 6d chess bs m8 it isnt something ppl can replicate the scammers know about the implings now, it literally worked on that 1 guy in the video thats it
---
Don‚Äôt do that, don‚Äôt give me hope.
---
Bam! Lose 2 hitpoint. Try again
---
Read what I wrote properly. I wasn't questioning how this is a scam nor was I suggesting it wasn't a scam. I was merely mocking the person who asked how this is a scam. I know this is a scam because I've seen countless videos on this type of scam.
---
Do one for full obsidian vs max melee strength against low def monsters. It's crazy how OP it is
---
Can you read? Gp is worth 0 to me. It has no value. How is that related to my time? I play this game for pets, gp, and for fun lmao. Using your arguments, you would just buy gp until you're at the same point in the game as me because farming gp in game is "not valuing your own time".
---
Selling/buying outside east Varrock in OSRS was fun for the first month. After nostalgia wears off and multiple scam attempts it gets old.
---
Maybe there is hope

The same as it is now, just have to move the mouse cursor.

Damn this music instantly makes me think back to when I first played RS and was killing cows/goblins in Lumbridge with a Mith battleaxe for hours on end. Those were the days

Can someone contact Mod Ash I think this guy hacked me
---
I miss my rs friends

Executives and upper management and investors

Make daggers 2 tick weapons pls
---
You can try and validate all you want it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that gp = time so theres no way buying bonds doesn‚Äôt = time. Theres not argument lol
---
BigRedJapans at the end there.
---
The ACB is fine, it's just that the blowpipe needs a slight nerf.
---
From what I recall hearing, they outsourced it in addition to in house and it still took like a year. And while graphics can be a selling point, OSRS is marketed as a Retro MMO so Retro and more modern graphics won't always mix well. The players you are likely to attract with better graphics likely aren't the same who would be interested in a Retro MMO and it could lead to more requests to modernize other aspects of the game.
---
Also, an HD update would kinda change the models... The current graphics can't work if they add HD, so they'd have to redo everything like they did back in 08. They may not be able to add a toggle since current graphics use a completely different rendering method to HD. Also, Jagex was not smaller than the OSRS Team back in 08 and I think you are seriously underestimating the costs of HD. It isn't just changing a few graphics; it is a massive engine change, months of updating graphics, and then a serious burden on all future updates (e.g. updates like SotE would take current artists 2-3x as long).

Questing is the best way to progress your account and unlock lots of cool content imo. Quest until you just can't anymore.
---
There are lots of money making methods, but the quickest ones usually involve killing things. Chaos druids drop lots of valuable herbs for example.  
---
And as always, set goals. One of my goals personally is base 70 stats (lowest skill at 70)
---
Woodcut on mobile
---
scouting shouldn't be a thing in the first place. 3rd party clients shouldn't be able to do this. u are stupid to thing this should be a thing.
---
I guess it depends on their reasons for quitting, if they just completely stopped enjoying the game and were also going for irl gains then it's probably understandable. Perhaps they will be playing other games they enjoy whilst doing irl things?

I ain't worry bout nothin he RWT, I spend my bank on my lady

OP is talking about boosting for a torso vs just buying a bcp because a bcp is the same price. It's common for irons because they won't see a bcp for a while, my comment was in regard to mains.
---
Another scenario, if you're cannoning higher accuracy bonus will improve cannon shots. 
---
You can an extra +25-35 accuracy with RCB.

they've been doing this for the past 3 years. nothing new kid.

It's Super high level gear discord, it's not meant for cheap stuff.
---
If you're looking for cheaper setups, try:  
---
Mr Mammal PvM guides- good for beginners, the gear is a lot lower level.  
---
Zulu PvM guides: They were made when TBow didn't exist, so his setups are a bit more expensive but definitely don't crack 1b. I haven't looked to see if he's put out more guides recently though.  
---
Failing that, ask in the #gear discord for gear ideas.

If you actually read my posts you'd see none of them are troll posts. In fact, after reading some of your posts you're more of a troll than me. You literally argued for several minutes in multiple posts about how I'm wrong and the level 29 isn't a scammer, but then finally agreed that he was scamming. I didn't think I had to break down the video and the OPs posts to you for you to understand that, but judging from your other posts you definitely lack reading skills.
---
Where did I say the level 29 isn‚Äôt a scammer?
---
I'm not sure I understand what the post is saying. mostly naked set2 &gt; set1?

Couldn't you have fucked yourself if the imp loot/jars filled up your inv?

we had this for over a year in osrs, and for quite some time in dmm. the GE was polled for both game modes. the case is settled: this is not what the current playerbase wants.
---
i miss this time period (05-06) but i can't think of a reason to force myself to do this again. not even for efficiency's sake but for how difficult it could be to trade with players.
---
nice.
---
Yah

the animelord angst

Is blowpipe really better even when you consider ruby bolts? That's insane lol

Or if you want to be even remotely efficient you need a different slot for each dose. Otherwise you're wasting a ton of time.

Fuck sakes... not even selling for 3 mil above GE price now. Thanks lol

That's all that matters, you being happy about a game you play for fun.

The fact that you keep editing almost every single reply says it all, you fucking troll. I'm done with you, you pathetic excuse of a human.

My bad I should've made my post clearer, I'm wondering why the yellow from initiate is closer to the yellows of the devout boots and the cape. But why would I wear initiate when proselyte is higher level, you would think it would better match the other two yellows.
---
every fucking time
---
If jagex can't properly remove bots, how can I trust that their estimate is correct?
---
How? I have to remove the table to remake it. So constantly right clicking.
---
I will never play a fucking card game
---
I gave up my search, i seem to get around with fairy rings and teleport jewelry
---
Continuously arguing I'm wrong about him being a scammer then admitting he's a scammer literally confirms you're stupid. But your trolling is boring as fuck and I've clearly won this 'argument' after you admitted I was right all along, have a nice day in your basement kid. :)
---
Dungoneering was years after HD came out.
---
If you ever get potions or cabbage on a clue, means you hit the 3a table. But also FWIW imyouve probably hit the 3a table before but most likely hit the empty spots on it
---
Honestly, yeah
---
Where did I say he‚Äôs not a scammer?
---
What is the weapon upgrade path people generally take for melee/mage/range? 
---
Assume 75 all combat stats with d scim, rune cbow/magic short, mystic staff. 
---
Like I‚Äôve heard Arm cb is something to skip for range and just go blow pipe but not 100% sure. 
---
I just don‚Äôt want to be wasting money on some bigger upgrades if they are trash. 
---
Thank you.
---
Exactly, there's nothing there, so why doesn't the image stop?
---
I thought the exp drops were a really awesome touch too
---
That was my question exactly but too afraid to ask
---
Some dumb fuck is going to try to anti scam like this and fail guaranteed
---
Enjoy your new pet
---
Genuinely so excited for these vids. Love you.
---
They're very relaxed creatures.
---
Really good pets from what I've heard.
---
Oh yeah my bad, I always forget about them. I've never really used them though either, the only really shit task I find is Kalphites and they're super quick with a cannon on the low level guys.
---
 I wouldn‚Äôt do it
---
Or the right click option if I'm using a mouse on mobile

video game developers should unionize

I was there last month. Did you visit the distillary? Picked up a couple nice bottles from there myself, despite usually not being a huge fan of Irish Whiskey.
---
Crazy to think that the biggest Irish distillery is literallly only a 5 minutes away from such a wonder of nature.
---
The anti scam fails when they tell you to bank your implings lmao, there‚Äôs no counter to it. If you bring logs/knife/bow string then they choose no weapon switch, and then they can‚Äôt disable any specific combat style so if you can sneak in runes in any way shape or form along with the supplies to make a bow, then you‚Äôre going to anti them plain and simple. I have no alter motive here
---
Damn did you just time 50 minutes on your phone and do them 10x/day?
---
Why not have addy arrows equipped or have darts in inventory?
---
Melee:
---
Best Scimitar -&gt; Whip -&gt; Get Sara Sword/Abyssal Dagger/Bludgeon and full Obsidian + Berserker Necklace for Strength training (keep whip still) -&gt; Dharok's for Strength training after 90 HP (replaces obsidian set) -&gt; Ghrazi Rapier
---
Ranged:
---
Best shortbow you can use -&gt; Rune Knives for training or MSB (i) for Slayer/Barrows -&gt; Blowpipe -&gt; Dragon Crossbow for raids (Keep Blowpipe still)
---
Mage:
---
Best battlestaff -&gt; Iban's -&gt; Trident of Seas -&gt; Trident of Swamp -&gt; Kodai for Slayer (keep Trident still) -&gt; Sanguinesti (for bossing, replaces Swamp, can sell Kodai for this if you boss a lot)
---
Do people really still dedicate actual time to the ‚Äúrs3 bad‚Äù meme
---
Once you have to do the level 5 defender grind you‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs one of the best/easiest roles. Healer on the other hand...arthritis is guaranteed, especially when nobody role swaps to be a 2nd healer in the later rounds.
---
If Jagex removes bots completely, people would realise the games aren‚Äôt anywhere near as populated as they want them to think it is. 
---
I started in 2001, and the social aspect of RuneScape has just dropped. Most servers are ghost worlds, full primarily of bots. I rarely see people whatsoever outside of GE or popular afk training spots. 
---
No one wants to play a game that‚Äôs only being played by a couple of thousand people, so they have to leave in the thousands of bots to make it seem more popular
---
Boost 80-90something ranged in a few hours in the mm2 caves. 550k+ exp an hour, I went from 77-92 ranged in a day and my DG kills per trip doubled.

That is such a clever way to get to frem

This seems like a good plan until you have several thousand of every grimy herb

You can get a job, clock in for 10 minutes and then clock out and quit. They're still legally required to pay for every minute

But broad bolts are dirt cheap... quantity over quality

Combat doesn't matter. He can't use melee

I was just giving suggestions man

Those streams have been around for literal years

If I may ask do they do anything?
---
Howd you get 90?? Struggling at mushroom trees to get 90 :(
---
He has no stams on him .
---
is there other stuff you can do? fletch your own arrows/bow during the fight or something?
---
Lol where does everyone seem to find all these Runescape friends? Everyone I originally started playing stopped a few weeks in and the people you meet in game don't seem the most... Social
---
This is so cool, wish I could make stuff like this.
---
What‚Äôs your total level? Me and my buddies have a clan and we‚Äôre up to 15-20 people and do a lot of bossing. I think we‚Äôre 90+ combat level
---
So you get the bronze crossbow from the fletching cape. Idea is you bring in bronze bolts and search it. However, this has been patched, you can no longer search the cape when in a duel.
---
Im about to do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move:
---
*log out double √±ame change*
---
99 rc good....?
---
So I should wear no gear to complement my lack of pet?
---
? ‚ÄúThe tbow drop is in your name‚Äù is correct
---
Blowing glass, cooking, fletching are all semi afk
---
goml
---
Thieving lvl?
---
It is in the spirit of the meme

could be a clue, idk
---
that's fair
---
i wish jagex would recklessly give me ban powers on an account so i could use it to ban bots while i do boring shit on my main
---
I'll have to give it a try with my bluetooth mouse as my ps4 controller works just fine. USB worked great on my s8 but I upgraded and now I cant even play clone hero :(
---
That shield is way too small
---
Game broke come back later
---
Aaaah. Yeah the newer PS4 controllers just connect via Bluetooth, no cord needed.
---
I understand you.but sooner or later game will need a graphical improvement. Majority of osrs players use runelite and they use gpu modes antialzing and smoothing stuff and even a client makes a difference. It looks way better than vanilla client and a few developers could manage it just look at oshd and it also was really good looking apart from very bright lighting effects. What im saying is i love the design i love how items and world looks thats why i love 08 hd. 09 they started to change the items. It just needs some make up smoothing etc.
---
this is assuming everyone is 99 range and accuracy wont be a factor. can you do the math for the average 70 range player who is more likely going to be killing fire giants?
---
miscellanea quest
---
I know I just honestly have fully found a name I 100 like
---
Still the obby cape over atleast an Ardougne cape.
---
The new helm isn‚Äôt OP. It doesn‚Äôt give max hits with max gear, you sacrifice defense bonuses, prayer bonus is the same as existing Nezzy helm, and you lose venom protection and the ability to venom. 
---
Serp will still be BiS for CoX challenge mode raids, Vorkath, and ToB as well as a few super niche situations. 
---
Most popular bossing is done on task as is - Zammy, Arma, and Slayer bosses. Bandos is mainly off task but DPS wise blowpipe and hides &gt; max melee (excluding scythe) as the attacker and as the tank you‚Äôd want Justicar helm. Arma you‚Äôd be ranging. 
---
Tl;Dr - A lot of misinformation and Nezzy upgrade will obviously be better but it won‚Äôt change anything except for team CoX or solo pre scouts. Yes it‚Äôs better but Serp still is extremely useful where you use it.

Have you ever played osrs lmao

One of the mods said they ban tens of thousands a day.  60k the day he responded, either yesterday or the day before

I think we can make an exception! Add me in game. My name in game is: I SmokePubes.

I just went through this last night!!! Why would you leave on Wave 10 , would an extra 5 minutes really kill you?

Since release? Do you only log on, pickpocket a man, and log off
---
Blowpipe is 2 ticks faster because of the rapid attack style. 2 ticks per attack versus 4 ticks for most melee weapons. This means the blowpipe gets 2 attacks for every attack typical melee weapons get, but it does more than half the damage.
---
Can do!

Even Why I Ask people to grab me flax they are suspicious of me being a scammer and ask for gp up front.. Why is it like this ? Like Im merching flax or something ?
---
This is what everyone expects, but usually when everyone expects something they develop a lure within a lure (see grand seed pod lure, where you think you're getting grand seed pod lured but actually they just want you to drop your items and then they stall the gate and you can't pick them back up).
---
Why would you not use void at Vork though?
---
bro ty for making me 8mil xdd wont work anymore tho ezzzz antiscammed twice
---
I remember this and the days before, i think people think of it as nostalgic times of a simpler era but i think it was the school days flash browsers when runescape was at it's peak that we missed it. Before the GE and days people just basically pseudo iron manned everything, i think i only traded like 3x a year, once when i hit 50 and could finnally start grinding money to buy a dragon longsword and rune platebody back when it was the 2nd bis after the dchain, and then another time when i traded my adamant platelegs for 25k plus a plateskirt. Scamming was kinda rampant with buying and selling scams and basically you had to obtain 90% of items yourself for questing since no one sold single ropes or quest items for 100 gp unless you were willing to pay 25k for a rope, 10k for a black bead and 5k for a candle.
---
Remove non bis bankstanding
---
Speaking as a maxed rs3 player, the mtx is kind of a mixed bag. Treasure hunter can be a little annoying/in your face, but you can easily avoid using it if it feels too easy for you. Cosmetics are just cosmetics, if you like them, buy them, if you don't, don't. 
---
Other things like extra bank spaces, action bars, and bank presets that make the game significantly more convenient are needlessly locked behind pretty high pay walls, and definitely could benefit from a price decrease. That said, I maxed without spending more than my membership fees, and I never felt overly inconvenienced by having to shuffle around in menus when I was changing between different skilling activites.
---
If it bothers you that people can reach high level content faster and easier than you by paying real life money, then mtx is a problem, but I don't really understand that perspective.
---
If you want lms rewards but aren't a pvper, i suggest playing competitive on the f2p world. People are generally much worse there plus there's bots, so you gain points a lot faster than in members worlds
---
Melee with lance is essentially the same kills/hr and more GP/hr since you don‚Äôt have bolt/dart costs. (Assuming you‚Äôre max combat and using Bandos and such)
---
Yeah just like the rogues den minigame. Did they really update the traps ?
---
**High quality OC?!** Awesome.
---
How come no one talks about the dragon crossbow? Is it just completely not worth it or what?
---
And is msb(i) with amethyst better than a dragon crossbow with broad bolts if you aren't praying?
---
It's all just so classic noob. Bandos boots. Why? Because it's part of the bandos set bro! Perfectly balanced 76 melees? Very noob. Elder maul? Never heard of attack speeds. Fury instead of a torture. Full bandos before piety. What he got for gloves?
---
This one was first actually. The higher upvoted post is 1 hour younger.
---
Thank you for all the amazing videos man, currently my favourite series on youtube. Also, could you maybe tell what your first medium task is? ;)
---
Is it bad I thought about doing this like, in 2010? But I figured it was too dumb. Also thought about just uploading a video daily that is just an image of the number day it is. XD
---
Jesus fucking christ, what the hell am I watching? A casual trio taking nearly an hour? My 1+4's aren't even that long lol.
---
I 100% feel obligated to do my daily roulettes on my alt jobs because of the crazy XP reward. It beats FATE grinding though. Love that game, but OSRS will always be my #1.
---
The thing I imagine we were both wondering is what this post had to do with the 20 minute logout timer. It‚Äôs been present for quite some time, so why RIP 6 hour splashing?
---
Mith and Addy darts vary between 54-60k per hour. I like 'em.
---
Otherwise, cutting bows for fletch, cooking, woodcutting something like Yews at the guild, glassblowing for craft, herblore to an extent but the invents are done pretty fast, fishing (especially monkfish, harpooning or anglers) and lastly mining - top level requires of MLM inputs every 15-25 seconds.
---
Damn guys this post was a joke be gentle to him
---
then you hop worlds, get in the gate and hop back to reclaim your stuff
---
Join the CC ‚Äòsrittney‚Äô - growing community and full of really nice and helpful people. :)
---
Yea now they get rid of the second, so you can‚Äôt use bows, and if you noticed then they turn switching off and if you notice that they turn gun weapons on
---
Hmm that does sound too good. I have noticed though that initiate plume is red and proselyte is yellow where armour trims go yellow to orange respectively so idk if following the plumes at all is necessary.
---
Am I right in thinking this is some carry over from RuneScape Classic that just never got tweaked?
---
You see any high level wyverns while you were there?
---
Suggestion to make previous diary pieces available so we can fashionscape harder.

In my opinion, whatever game you can buy in-game progress with irl money is bad. Whatever game progress you have should be earned by the time and effort you put into it, not by how big your wallet is irl. For me, is a thing of equality for everyone in-game no matter whats your situation irl, whether its your sex, racial heritage, economic situation, status, age, in-game you and me are the same and have the same capabilities.

That's like saying you don't need avas for "savings".

Thanks for that!!

Both NMZ and bandits still have the 20 minute logout timer as well, so with Guthan‚Äôs set you will be auto-logged after 20 minutes of inactivity. I know in RS3 back in 2009 I got a one month ban for splashing because you could stay logged in until the servers went down for an update while you were in combat, but I‚Äôm not sure if that was possible in early OSRS.
---
Is takes 8:30 to get the points needed. It's alright if you got them passively and have extra but if you have to farm them it's about 9 mins for 150k or about 1m/h no not worth it if you can pvm.
---
Twisted bow sucks at wyverns too. Must be a useless weapon.
---
I can agree about it getting graphical improvements like some of the clients offer as part of the game. But I wouldn't say we need HD or such. When you aren't trying to be a modern cutting edge game, graphics aren't as big of a deal and for a retro game like OSRS, they should never be the focus or the main appeal. And no matter how you try to justify it, HD is a massive update that would take away from other updates.
---
moral of the story... public chat off. don't ever try to anti-lure or anti-scam
---
although.. 5m risk is rather minimal in the duel arena.. oh also never go to the duel arena.
---
to the top
---
You have impeccable reading comprehension
---
Not exactly. But it's close to that. A tab can't see other tabs or processes.

You are a legend , I lost 400m to a maple bower .

Jagex changes a chathead and people freak out, but I'm sure this will go smoothly

Basically yeah. If you're killing something that has low defence against ranged then msb will put dps a crossbow for the most part.
---
No. Buy an ancient staff.
---
No poorly executed whiteclaw shotgun 0/10

I truly believe how you do one thing is how you do everything:

If your RS bank looks like the left, best to look at your real life bruh

You can have max stats in mining using best gear ever, 5 bots mining same rock will outmine you.

There's another aspect as well. I've only used real money one time on my account for security purposes because I actually enjoy the process of earning gp more than earning cash. While it definitely wasn't efficient for me to do that, it's still something to consider as to whether buying bonds with gp is "worth it" to someone.
---
?? I was hoping you would open your eyes and see that purple skin doesn't match any of the yellow or white or red. and you want to nitpick on the yellows. Nice job making your own content. Personally, content like this is better left unpublished, because its the last thing osrs needs to fix atm. prossy initiate all prayer gear works perfectly fine lol
---
Lol I just changed it so that I could get all the text in
---
Yeah every single time you bank
---
&gt; fire max cape
---
That's the single cringiest item in the entire game. If you have max stats there is literally no excuse not to own an Infernal Max Cape.
---
shoulda high alched the cunt
---
Then the level 2 scam is if you have addy arrows he blocks shield so you can't equip a bow since its in the shield slot for being 2h - then unloads a blow pipe and darts you to death.
---
I'm probably the worst to try and answer this as I don't PK, but I think you have to be comfortable with your own gear switches first, after that you can kind of predict what attack style the other player might use based on whether you're frozen, what you're wearing, what you're praying and where you're standing in relation to them; if you are unfrozen they will likely try to freeze you because melee is a big threat, if you are in range gear while praying mage they will likely default to ranged and if you are wearing mage gear and they are unfrozen or next to you they will likely try to hit you with a special attack or default to ranged if you are praying melee.
---
Yup, I made the mistake of trying to anti scam one of these guys by bringing a blowpipe in so I could u load the darts, I read that method on here - I learned the hard way to not try and do the right thing in this game lmao, so private chat off; I lost 60m because of foolish certainty that I'd be able to stop the guy from doing it to someone else. Honestly hate people.
---
Play on words from A Tail of Two Cats nazi
---
scammer asks you to duel on their terms. their terms are you to use a maple shortbow and rune arrows, cant lose right? seems like a guaranteed win since OP was level 125 and the scammer is level 30 something.
---
but you cant use rune arrows with a maple shortbow, so you can't hit them. 
---
additionally, the scammer will not duel with you if you have anything to circumvent this, but this scammer did not see the significance of the imps.
---
Lololololol. Try it out and let us know.
---
Dumping mine october/november. Doubt they will go up anywhere near where they did last year though
---
If it climbs I‚Äôll be so glad I‚Äôve looted hundreds of em from pvp and bounty worlds
---
Cool, thank you
---
The final boss (the culinaromancer)
---
I think what I miss about this is the nostalgia and how tons of people would group up here and at Seer's village bank. Now the only meet up spot is the GE.
---
But the community in this game today is much different than it was back then and so is money value. Remember how 2 mill use to be a shit load of money?
---
So salty.
---
True that, true that, It was kinda fun for rare trading but osrs doesn't really have those and honestly it kinda makes sense a bit to avoid like the black market / hacking stuff, but i do miss having like long term investment items you could know would retain value against inflation like santas/phats
---
in challenge mode the venom effect is pretty powerful
---
Yes, I use runelite time to time. My work and school schedule mostly put me on mobile nowadays tho.
---
yeah but if they release fewer updates than people complain less about the updates duh idiot lmao
---
If you hop the items will NOT appear for you when you hop back.

You miss being a child.

---
RS2 had an unlockable scroll from the Dungeoneering shop that did this. Didn't make any sense really.
---
What's your prediction? 
---
- Blue peaked around 250k last year
---
- Cracker peaked around 330k last year
---
In 2017:
---
- Blue peaked 400-425k
---
- Cracker peaked around 500k
---
In 2016 
---
- Blue peaked 900k 
---
- Cracker peaked around 1m
---
So each year the peak is a little lower than the previous room but there's always a huge bounce from the yearly low to the yearly high. So the volatility is always there each year, just less profit.
---
maxed by the way, and agility was laid back as fuck.
---
Best I can think of is using the collection log in-game.

Stats reset when you leave or when you‚Äôve killed him. If you‚Äôre using the bgs/blowpipe setup you‚Äôll only consistently get a kill per trip maybe 2 so it‚Äôs better to restore and double spec each kill. Once you get the DHCB you can camp it but at that point you don‚Äôt even use a defense lowering weapon at all.
---
Would be nice but I would also like them do re-add land of goblins and path of glouphrie
---
Blue phat was in the tens of millions originally but since Jagex kept releasing more each year the price has steadily declined. 
---
The holiday items are still very good to merchant if you buy at the yearly low and sell at the yearly high.
---
I'm sure there's people with more.
---
imagine dying in a pvp enabled area
---
Mahogany tables
---
I've done bandos at these stats. You don't do a lot of dps but it's possible
---
Whoever owns that tab on the left, sort your fucking shit out
---
They were tens of millions in osrs? I remember them being very expensive in rs2. Didn't know they were ever over 100k on osrs.
---
I can understand that. Don't let that server's progress stop you from making your own builds, if you did just want to build. It's cool to see different styles of RS builds
---
Who gives a shit? I sold kiln capes before EoC, and if I was good enough to do inferno right now I'd be selling those too. It's a fucking video game you bird, the rules are a joke
---
Get membership
---
The CC that I've been in for almost 6 months has a bunch of really good people in it. It is really laid back. You can join "TheOSLounge" in game and someone there can hit you up with the Discord link.
---
Your right I was thinking of sumoning, stupid me, didn't feel like learning a new skill along with other prob more minor reasons that I can't remember
---
Low level says "hey, staking any level 100m" he tells you to empty inventory and gives you a maple bow and rune arrows (which the maple bow can't use). Someone PM's you saying "yo, that guy is scamming, rune arrows don't work with a maple bow, grab some Addy arrows and anti-scam him!!" So you go into the duel with Addy arrows. The scammer then sets the duel rules so you can't use armour or a shield, but disabling the shield also disables 2 handed weapons, like a maple bow. So you get to stand there like an idiot for 3 minutes while a lvl 12 kills you with black darts and you can't fight back. Looks like this guy didn't do the complicated version of the scam and just tried to give him arrows he can't use, but op brought in imp jars which gave him combat runes so he could fight back and kill the scammer. Can't really format since mobile so sorry for the wall of text, but if you learn anything from this, if someone tries to scam you and another person says "hey do this anti-scam" and sends you a video or explains some trick tell him to fuck off. They're both working together to trick you.
---
Oh no
---
That‚Äôs not how microwaves work... there‚Äôs areas of high and low amounts of heating in the microwave which you can imaging as a literal 3D wave in the microwave, low points will be heated slower, high points heated faster due to interference and superposition between electro magnetic waves (microwaves) generated in the microwave. This is why microwaves have a spinning plate, so the food cooks more evenly, so unless you move each half far appart it won‚Äôt really make much difference
---
For sure man! Thanks again.
---
Not all heros wear max capes

Wiki is a great source of general information but in regards to PvM setups they‚Äôre not exactly right.
---
Its been like this for a couple of days now. Im sitting on a dust devil task waiting to be patched. Really i feel like the mobile team does not care :( it cant be hard to patch this right? I mean it worked flawless before.
---
yeah that's even worse lol idc why anyone would buy bonds with cash for membership

Why is he not wearing the mime mask
---
yeah and super restores are almost 12k each its summer inflation

I have to get closer to kick your ass
---
chest count is 72, didn't get anything for about 15 goes and then the last 2 i got dharok helm, dharok axe and then the next one i got karils crossbow so not bad

Name 1 set of melee gear what looks good with the new helmet
---
I didn‚Äôt buy from ge I was trying to do a collection log of it but it‚Äôs not there :(
---
Can we make a petition and bring back RS like I remember it, but also add in the HDRS assets? We could call it Old School RuneScape Classic HD
---
Probably not, he probably just never played classic enough to know morttania isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôve played it a very small amount and didn‚Äôt know that, since the map feature is practically non existent and travel is incredibly slow
---
OS? Specs? Did you have an update with your PC?
---
No

wow this was an insanely helpful response. I'm gonna get the graceful considering that knowledge about how 40-60 is the fastest time to get marks. thanks bro, didn't know that

I'd say it's up to the player to decide if it is worth the effort to use amulet switches. Here are the calculations:

spend some irl money and experience everything your missing out on.  I played f2p the majority of my osrs career because I enjoyed the simplicity but that's when it was Rs2 nowadays in osrs its literally pointless to play f2p as  we are all adults and if you cant afford a bond or membership you probably shouldn't be wasting thousands of hours on a video game anyways... ( change my mind )

Cuz i wanted a cool screenshot lol

Blast furnace addy bars for xp and money for lumbridge elite diaries, 5 levels to go.

It's niche. it basically replaces the venom effect with a chance to heal, and 1 extra damage. great for things where endurance is key and npcs are immune to venom, like maybe gwd or raids. But not worth it anywhere else.

Guys, give Jagex a break, they've only so much money left over for devs when its $7 a pop for a bond

My biggest problem is that helmet with its limited visibility is +0 ranged and a berserker helmet with more visibility is -5 ranged.

Yeah but I‚Äôm the kind of player that can‚Äôt do things for more than a few minutes if it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt like so for me it‚Äôs slow and it sucks

omg is that the real kappadar

Irl friends or just in clan chats

The annoying thing about your first comment is that it doesn't seem genuine at all. Sure, people say it and get upvoted often on reddit but gold is only $2 so if your dubious claims of inability to give are true, maybe try to contribute in another way.
---
But yes, there are things that can unexpectedly get you karma crucified here compared to other subs.
---
I‚Äôve seen at least one on Reddit, I hope they eventually implement one
---
I guess I shoulda just used the voting system. Looks like I didn't learn my lesson though as I'm still commenting
---
Removing darts from BP is also patched before anyone tries that too. Best advice is ignore these obvious scams, and don't try to anti scam. OP got one on them but like he said they quickly caught on.
---
No they wont.
---
How are they doing any of these things?

I just figured this out a few weeks ago, super nice trick and used it in combo with anglers for my ironman doing SotE.
---
Nice congrats! Yea I forgot to post it under this thread but I also got it a couple days ago haha. I‚Äôve noticed that if you complain about it on Reddit you usually get it next try
---
I can see how some people enjoy the game for what it is, but at the moment it's set to be very unwelcoming to new players. There is no randomness, or teamwork. It's just straight to intense 1v1's with the exact same gear as everyone else. It's built so that the top pkers always come on top, and that's not a very rewarding feeling nor an incentive to get better. I see it drastically falling in popularity like the previous LMS, but even worse for the casual player. Beyond that, it will keep a player count high enough to think it's a successful minigame purely because the farms of f2p bots that will be filling the economy with this junk.

Cannoning them will always be the fastest slayer xp, but if you cant or dont want to cannon them, I would do what /u/Rubeola_lol suggested.

If so baldies would have an advantage for bulking up at the gym and there's nothing like that going on. It's not for having high test, in fact, current generations on their twenties have the test levels of +60 years olds, which have low test levels compared to their peak.
---
Here‚Äôs an alternative explanation if the other one doesn‚Äôt work for you: in expectation, you will lose one arrow every five shots, and thus, for every five shots, you will spend the full price of the arrow.

Yikes

B0aty used to sell fire capes right? Who cares

8.9 - 9.3 is significant same with 9.4 - 9.9. Demonics drop supplies there‚Äôs really no reason to not use Zenytes. Also you shouldn‚Äôt ever be using melee while wearing an Arma piece. You‚Äôd sub blessed dhide in and lose like 3 Range bonus and sacrifice zero melee stats.

The two most powerful weapons are slow (scythe and t bow). It's possible to make a slow and powerful weapon, the issue is the way jagex originally balanced low level weapons 10+ years ago.

Yes

Yeah definitely do oak larders until you can do oak dungeon doors for the lower xp and go, teak benches and mahogany tables are really expensive but faster. I typically do the more expensive methods for an hour or so at a time to stomach it.
---
Closer.  I made an account when it was first released,  played for a couple months,  and then quit until mobile was unofficially released a few years ago.  So kind of a half truth there.
---
Theres a lot of things that matter, like range level, combat level, bank worth, slayer level, if your goals are exp vs money, it's just not a good question imo üëç but agree, exp=cannon, if semi-afk kourend/slayer tower

I don't think that really counts as a scam.

Dude. I tried doing this last night with a maple bow scammer....I brought Addy Arrows p+++ because he gave me rune arrows. I thought I was so smart and going to scam the scammer, but he brought darts and fucked me up. I lost my cash stack of 10m and he was level 22....I'm 82. Fml

It was a one time deal cannot be replicated for the 10th time I‚Äôve said in this thread..... yeesh

They're directly correlating it to the assembler/accumilator by adding the ammo collecting feature so what's the point of even adding it when it's obvious that the better option is just using the assembler/accumilator instead of the cape.

Everyone who replied to you is a noob who speculates without knowing history. Just appreciate him. You don't know what kind of hell this place is without him.

Never in my post did I say make the cape have the same offensive stats as the assembler before you use Vorkath's head on the cape
---
don't stake idiot...of course you lost money

Lmao Klin Capes, even before EoC klin was almost as easy as fight caves cuz of those OP crystals

Whatever I guess the cape is fucking useless and I'll never use it

I don‚Äôt think it changes the math, but one was a double chest, the coif and one of the legs

i dont think someone is trying to hijack your account, i and others have been facing this issue for weeks now, but since its just a small minority of people its happening to, no light is being shed on the situation, i have been looking for a fix for a while and i cant find anything but other threads asking about this problem too to no avail.

Proud of u bb, but why the fUCK did it take me 106 kills to get a Bottomless Compost Bucket??

Until someone uses a standard android emulator with a mouse. It would be virtually impossible to stop that.

It isn‚Äôt useless though? At certain places it‚Äôs best in slot, hydra, dks many places you prefer the prayer bonus over the damage bonus.

I just tried using a VPN and it worked!
---
I think a good rough upgrade path is Bigger and Badder &gt; setting up your block list &gt; slayer rings &gt; extending tasks or something like that.
---
If you're an ironman, picking up broader fletching early is handy since it is a pretty big dps boost over the bone crossbow. If you're a regular account you can just buy the bolts from the ge without unlocking it. And a magic shortbow (i) with rune arrows is often better dps for non-irons anyway.

Is that it?

DO NOT TRY TO ANTI SCAM THESE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THE SAME METHOD YOU SEE IN THE VIDEO. I DID NOT POST THIS WITH THE INTENTION OF GETTING OTHER PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND TRY IT. I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE THAT
---
IT ONLY WORKED ONCE AND THEN ALL THE SCAMMERS KNEW ABOUT IT AND WOULD NO LONGER DUEL ME WITH IMPLINGS IN MY INVENTORY.  THERE ISNT ANY OTHER WAY TO OUTSMART THESE SCAMMERS THEY KNOW ALL OF THE TRICKS IN THE BOOK AND ARE ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD. 
---
NEVER TRUST ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU ABOUT ANTI SCAMMING. THEY ARE ALSO SCAMMERS. KEEP PRIVATE CHAT SET TO FRIENDS SO THEY CANT EVEN PM YOU. DONT PLAY WITH FIRE AND STAY SAFE pls.

Same dude! And at the same level :P

Needless to say i stood there like a fucking idiot over my loot wondering wth was happeneing and got tbed and smited by a clan
