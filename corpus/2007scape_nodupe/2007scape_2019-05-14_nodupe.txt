How would you feel about them extending the F2P area into Tarverly? Since you're suggesting letting F2P players accessing the Dark Wizard Tower?
---
He's talking about level brackets
---
The Imp Box really needs to be polled. It's pretty Bullshit that this was one of their intended purposes to call it an "integrity" change. The nods just know it won't pass a poll and are trying to weasel around it
---
Don‚Äôt worry guys. He picked a good day to ruin his pure, considering Jagex just officially announced that they don‚Äôt care about pkers at all anymore.
---
Isles is next on the quest list lol
---
fish originally came from sea

---
ended in lake 
---
yes im right
---
Yeah we wanted something we could all do together after getting destroyed at gwd. It‚Äôs more about having fun and playing together than efficiency for us
---
Currently I'm at +1300 medium clues. And I've gotten 2 rangers, 4 wizards, 4 sandals and single pair of gilded climbing boots.
---
I feel I've already covered these points, but to reiterate: 
---
1. Because that is not the reason players are dropping out. Players are dropping out because oldschool fits a niche group of people, and that does not represent the majority of gamers. 
---
2. Yes, there is. Look at MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. In vanilla WoW, they threw you into the world and it became a success. When did players drop off? Cataclysm. This was the period where they began streamlining the experience. Games like Battle for Azeroth and RS3 have turned what was once a sandbox into a themepark, and the problem with that is that you have to keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times. 
---
3. Going to ignore the last point, you're attacking a straw-man argument.
---
First thing that comes to mind is TB being botted for that mature ale thing
---
Yep, thats what it says

This is literally undeniable proof MTX is coming

2nd comment top comment: He's banned across all of his accounts. so ya wrong.
---
Give players an untradable bond as a reward for completing all f2p quests.
---
Eh I'll upvote for visibility. Either you're being honest and the mod gets booted, or we get a smackdown. Sounds like the first though and that's shitty bwana.
---
That's not true, they don't have to be realistic. Company goals aren't necessarily achievable. They exist to guide the team's effort, not to motivate.
---
My team's goal, for example, is to be the best login experience in the world. Now, do we, in a small 7 person team, have enough resources to beat titans like Google? Probably not. But I can stop at any point and think "huh, what I'm working on won't help us get closer to being the best login in the world" and just drop it on the backlog until our priorities are re-evaluated.
---
Edit: to add, your actual achievable "goals" are your backlog, the features you want or have to implement in order to further your company goal.
---
2 Things that should be integrity and non polled.
---
g maul spec change to 60% 
---
-&gt; the accessibility of a weapon that can instantly hit twice for the cost of 38k is a joke.
---
-&gt; adding a bh brought attachment that makes the maul worth money to pk while giving the 50/50 spec, maul destroyed on death leaving the attachment as a drop if not kept.
---
Removal of tb on tber death.
---
-makes a push to kill the tber to escape.
---
-you can log out to lose tb why not if tber dies.
---
-1min immunity to tb after.
---
2nd top comment by mod: he's banned across all accounts.
---
This should be higher up. In general leveling up should be more meaningful.
---
[removed]
---
For real! some of my best memories of runescape is killing goblins to pass the gate to al Kharid and then being murdered by the scorpions in the mine.
---
I assume you mean a player moderator and not a Jagex employee, the latter surely wouldn't have flamed you. False reports from power-trippin' p-mods should be considered ban-worthy.
---
Everything is based on bosses now, sorry I hate the rooftops aswell but making bosses the meta for everything sounds quite boring which osrs already is. An agility minigame sounds funny tho, osrs needs a cool minigame like fog.
---
B gloves next?
---
A super sharp/dense crystal shard on a chain makes total sense to me. In fact, it makes the most sense. And I really love this suggestion. It‚Äôs a niche item that would really fill in a gap.

---
 The client that im using is a strictly PvP client superior to all others, if you would like to purchase it for a one time payment of 175m PM me on discord Alakizam#2770
---
I used gray chins (about 300k exp an hour) until 85 ranged, and then switched to red chins until 99 (500k exp an hour, 600-650k with good rng and maximum attention). It really didnt cost me much, like for example I would buy them in 4-6k intervals for about 5m and get several ranged levels in one session, and then make it up with a couple hours of Vorkath using my new ranged levels.
---
It‚Äôs also the easiest to get killed with. I‚Äôm sure pures would rather use dds instead of getting consistently stacked out because when ur a noob ur not going to know when to spec as well as ur opponent does. At least with other specs that don‚Äôt stack 100 damage in 1-2 ticks u have a chance of surviving more.
---
My apologies, i should have been more clear on that. Ive just been super heated about this.
---
Hell yes kill the maul meta!
---
Make the dds great again!
---
i wish. They will be quite a ways down the road i think. I have only done one recipe subquest.
---
I've been playing for about a month and a half and I still don't know how the fuck to farm or construct.  At least with farming I got potatoes once.  Not sure if you're supposed to make the patch have puddles. No idea why I come back and the potatoes are dead, or why potato plants don't make potato seeds.  It was pretty much a frowntown experience.
---
Fucking stop
---
Changing Tutorial Island the first time didn't work then, and it won't work now. Its after Tutorial Island that there's problems! Specifically, that the option for help is there in the form of guides, but the problem is that they blend into the background with all the visual noise everywhere. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Is there a way such that when a player is sent to that spot in Lumbridge that, the camera is zoomed in harshly and focused specifically onto the Lumbridge Guide who is near the bridge near the Church? While he is literally what he is for, its kind of hard to notice him when there's Goblins literally everywhere distracting newbies. So make it hilariously obvious that that man is there for their assistance. Again, player retention problems happens AFTER Tutorial Island. Not during.
---
Please don't do that "Imma please everyone" BS that AAA companies attempts. Also doesn't work. Or at least, not for more than 1-3 months. Look at "WoW killers" for example. They try to please everyone including the WoW players and ultimately fail all of the above and are never remembered. Getting artsy fartsy with your already decent content just pisses everyone off.
---
Imo its just that initial point when we entered Lumbridge that there were problems. Specifically that the Guides don't stick out enough. If setting the camera such that it is clearly focused on the Guide isn't possible, then make the Guides stick out with a new color pallet. A giant glowing arrow isn't necessary less we want to repeat the disastrous tutorials that attempted to replace Tutorial Island in the past where they had giant arrows, giant doted paths, all of which made you feel like a dingus given that all of it took place in a literal straight path. These are players, not embryos.
---
Just give them a little nudge towards the Guides. Especially the two(?) ones in brown shirts and kaki pants. They're so bland looking that I doubt any new player would pay any attention to them with the clusterfuck of everything going on around them. Idk, maybe color the Guides in some obnoxious neon color(s) or something. You don't need a giant arrow for someone to see something that is neon and nothing else in it's proximity is.
---
Besides the Guides not sticking out enough, thats about it. I'm rather indifferent on everything else except the Tutorial Island, and the "I want to please everyone" BS. Not helping is how it is undemocratically decided. That's how Runescape 3 happened. It tried to be like every other MMO only to be meh at that in addition to vexing (most) of the veterans of the old combat system.
---
IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT! Except the Guides blending into the background. Fix that and the new player experience should be fine. Those Guides really do have some pretty damn useful information! Its just that players are probably too distracted by literally everything else. Like the literal hoard of Goblins running around. They ain't gonna notice some baby periwinkle headass in the midst of all that! Make the Guides look important. Take the security Vampire just right of the church. He sticks out super fucking hard. Do something like that. Or hell, even just resize/change the Guide models so that they're taller than everyone else. There's so many ways that isn't "here's a literal path towards the tutorial guide, here's a giant arrow in case the bread crump trail isn't enough you idiot".
---
Im in favor of just changing the Guide's colors so they stick out way more. I don't care if they look like unicorn vomit. Just make them noticeable without pointing them out like players are idiots. People can be dumb, but we could at least see when something looks interesting. A giant arrow doesn't make a NPC look interesting. It makes it so that the player feels like they're being herded like sheep. Kind of kills the whole gimmick of Old School Runescape being THE MMO that gives you a shit load of autonomy.
---
PS: Please put that shit to a pole. Not doing that just makes it look like that you want to force changes that YOU KNOW the community WOULDN'T want! Thats what dictators do. Defeats the point of the voting system if you just force it down everyone's throats regardless of their vote.
---
PSS: I have very little faith that any of this will end well. In before we reroll all are characters again because of "Old School Runescape Classic" since this one will become unrecognizable and become Runescape 2.5 and become hated among Runescape Old School players and RS3 players alike. Shame. The moment a company comes out and says in their actions, "you have no say in this, we're going through with very questionable decisions, so fuck off", that is a giant red slope of downward spirals right there!
---
PSSS: The reason Tutorial Island works so well is that the guides there, are very clearly represented as such. There's nobody else near them but themselves, so again, make the guides in Lumbridge more obvious like in Tutorial Island. Though considering the EOC fiasco, and the sloppily done tutorial remake that happened near that time, I have little hope that any of this will make it through. After all, Jagex ISN'T putting it to a vote because they know they would be assblasted by the community. Dictators can't have that now can they? Loot boxes not put to a poll incoming lads.

Oh god. You guys don't remember the last time you guys introduced a fundamental change to the game in the hopes of attracting a new audience?

wtf, I've been playing since 2006 and had no idea this existed...
---
Osrs will never become most popular mmrpg if theres no HD graphics. At least same as in 2007/8.. Kids nowdays wont play game with graphics from 2003
---
I dont think that the 60% gmaul would help... What about 50 attack pures? its unfair and would cost individual players a lot of money to use, whereas clans would easily be able to get it

Let‚Äôs replace that with the ‚Äò77 oscars in which Rocky won over Taxi Driver

I guess I should clarify and say that running to Varrock and Falador and Yanille are pretty terrible especially for early game players. I like unlocking teleports in books and seeing the teleport tabs are good gp.
---
smh that's practically cheating
---
There are plenty of different worlds for people to spread out but how is an active player base bad?
---
Full rune str pots and some food and go afk sand crawlers and zombies in the 2nd level of the stronghold.  You can afk there not get hit to hard and get those combat stats up to.
---
The mental image of a guy with a fire cape and bandos gear cowering behind a guide while the caravan passes by dark wizards is hilarious though

Yeah you just suicide irl

It's not bullshit, if you've ever done CoX, ToB or inferno you would know this. Accurate is super niche because you can almost always make full use of the attack speed of rapid.

The problem isnt what it is, its what it represents. They keep sneaking in unpolled content, and its getting more and more brazen. I mean think about it, just in the past month we got the new bis tick weapon, the bis pure boots, bis pure legs, zmi was nerfed, and now they are talking about making major pvp changes AND adding a new update to the ftp community AND the low level community, all unpolled. Even with the new elf dev blog, we are getting a crystal chest but we cant have any say on whats inside it, we are getting elf crystal shards but we cant even vote for them to be tradeable, nor the rates they are acquired, hell we don't even had solid numbers on most of the blog itself. Every update it seems the community opinion matter less and less, that is what people are getting upset about.
---
fair play. when people disappear from the scores after public attention, its usually the former tho
---
Sounds like it still needs to be nerfed jiggleflex

The pvp blog looked good though

You could kill ammonite crabs with a ring of wealth on. They aren't that great for profit but they are really good for training.

I hated loadstones. I‚Äôm fine with it a teleport beyond available to F2P cities though for a couple of hours if it has nothing visually added to the game.

The US Bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and there after westernization of Japan shaped modern day Japan. This therefore means that the United States indirectly created anime.

If you don't have a dragon defender yet the warrior's guild isn't a bad idea, otherwise if you're in need of money training slayer is generally the option. Also the cyclopes in the warrior's guild basement are pretty good cash.
---
Cave horrors aren't *that* consistent of cash since black masks are 1/512 drop rate. Something like dragons would be more money picking up the bones and hides but less exp since you have to bank a lot.
---
It isn‚Äôt the most ‚Äúefficient‚Äù but if you find it fun then go for it

Can we not dump this on every thread? It's completely fucking irrelevant.

easy but shit boss

only \~200m-400m( depending on if I feel like selling some of my maxing supplies ) away form getting it  with keeping a max rage set.
---
Nothing to do with being maxed or not.. this is a DUMB fuck change.. jagex are going to loose more players with this than they will retain in the long term.

You're missing the point. You left to bank. You gave up your spot.

Fuck outta here.

ill  get to checking it out. dont have to much time to hard grind raids on the daily sadly

You‚Äôre fine. Gear is not nearly as relevant is executing the proper strategy - it just makes the strategy easier.

I think it would be good to add a lite version of some member features, perhaps beginner achievement diaries like you did with clue scrolls. And perhaps new f2p quests that tie into member questlines.
---
Yep. I quit back in November and started up about a month ago. Been making a lot of progress since starting back up so I'm still pretty invigorated to grind stuff. Just gotta go with the motivation as it ebbs and flows.

Hope your still playing broodwar or you dont know what a real skill based game is haha

Drink like 4 beers. Just til ur a lil buzzed, but not stupid drunk. Thank me later

How about choke on a dick? This is nothing to do with being maxed or not.. jagex not polling this is the real issue.. bullshit they are dropping players due to dumb cunts getting 'lost' in the early game lmfao.

Ironic of you to accuse me of projecting after typing that first sentence. :)
---
No, don't make up weak strawman arguments. If you want to argue with yourself, please, do not include me.
---
Here are the facts:
---
* MMORPG means that this is a Roleplaying game. By definition, the genre exists for people to 'roleplay' as something they are not. 
---
* In this case, it means that you are pretending that your avatar in the game is *you*.
---
* Because the avatar in-game is not you, but you wear the accomplishments as if they were *your* accomplishments, you are roleplaying. Did *you* get 99 Firemaking, or did your *avatar* get 99 Firemaking under your control? Again, 99.99% of players will claim the accomplishment is their own, as if they were the ones that lit those fires, and gained those levels, when in fact, they are **roleplaying**. They are pretending that the avatar is them, and that they are gaining those levels, that those accomplishments somehow exist outside the game and apply to them.

I've had a similar issue. Within five minutes, the exact same thing would happen, even the sound loop and would even happen with rs3 and battlefield independently. It might be RAM bc I've alse blue screened with a memory management error message. then again, after I reboot, it usually says graphics driver setting were reverted to previous settings bc of some sort of error. I've tried updating and resetting my drivers and all, but never fixed it. I finally tried just closing chrome and spotify and only having osrs/rs3/bf1 and it usually works uninterrupted with the rare hiccup.

hard disagree. the reason bfa sucks is the gameplay.
---
&gt;Its been 3 years since i played vanilla and i can still tell you from memory what the good priest gear is and where you get it from. Gear was extremely iconic in early WoW. Now its just all the same shit with varying ilvl and randomized stats.
---
it sounds to me that we actually agree... gear mattered and was hard to get. now it doesn't.
---
The issue isn't just max mage though. Normal mystic, which cost a ton more than d'hide still splash a ton. And this is with realistic gear, like glory and barrows gloves, not absolute max. 14k armor shouldn't so heavily reduce your chance of hitting. Ways to solve it are either somehow increasing the price to around 100k for a set, or reducing the stats.
---
I got achievement diary cape and 2.1k total, quit, started ironman got my ironman to the same point realised end game iron sucks ass droppded my bank over and now I am having fun on my main pvm with friends and working on max. :P Lvling up ironman was 10/10 tho, journey not destination.
---
A pack of daily untradeable tele tabs (4) would help the new player experience and show them the value/potential of members
---
smith them. if you are at a point where you use diamonds/rubys you should have the level to do that, or buy gold ore and get the level to do that.
---
I don‚Äôt understand this comment, you talk about patience to grind, yet this suggestion has nothing to do with grind. This suggestion is to help give new players more direction in the super early game. Someone might just love grinding, but quit well before they find the charm of the game due to having no idea where to go or what to an hour in.
---
Lol, who said I was playing in a competitive nature? I play rs because I enjoy it not because I'm trying to be in an e-sports league. go click on the game you enjoy, shitter.
---
I think osrs is popular brcause it is indeed a simple game for the simple minded. Questing might be a challenge but thats more so to poor quest design. Also dont know why jagex doesnt tell you what items do though, never had to wiki so much shit for a game in my life.
---
I'mma just sit at wintertodt for like...3 months then.
---
teleblock should be f2p.. same with snare but we will see if they will do that
---
Karils already has a place in the game as some of the best mage defense in the game with no negatives to melee attack. It is already a best in slot piece of equipment. No need to buff.
---
You're the real mvp ;)
---
Get that addy gloves. Its already better than combat bracelet .
---
From addy and above, its worth to buy it honestly.

How deep wildy pking will be affected? Yeah, it will mean that black chin hunters can't instantly minimize risk every so often with 0 effort. Now they will have to bank or risk the full amount. This is an improvement to wildy pking.

Pretty much. On normal worlds people usually bring a very expensive +1 (i.e. dragon claws, elder maul, ags etc) that they can keep with the prayer when they die. On these worlds you can't do that so even just 1 kill can be great profit. Be aware though, the pkers who go to these worlds are generally significantly better than those who use regular worlds. There is a way to pk those +1s on non high risk worlds though, by using the smite prayer to drop their prayer to zero when they die, thus disabling their protect item prayer. However this can be pretty hard if they have a high-ish prayer level and it leaves you somewhat vulnerable as you can't use protection prayers, if it's the type of fight where protection prayers are acceptable.
---
Nice! Is it pretty easy to get to the addy quest requirements?

Castle wars is one of my fondest memories of Runescape back in the day. It'd be insane to see organized games going on. Castle wars needs a bit of rebalancing of course but I'd love to see an organized tournament of some sort and maybe a new map. It's sad to think that's it's become pretty much dead content over the years but to revive it would be really cool.
---
Except you have to click twice to log out
---
Wyverns are kinda high req but drop a decent amount
---
Would rather play a game of castle wars then sit in my shit 24/7 for 7 days straight
---
The guy is botting
---
It's definitely a mindset issue. I've been playing since 04, and after trying to get countless people into the game and helping each one of them out at early levels I've learned some major things.
---
1) Runescape, and OSRS especially, are not for everyone. The current style of games and the new generation have changed. They want different things from their MMO and that's ok. OSRS should not change for them. 
---
2) Giving new players shit like starting teletabs, good gear (like starting sets of rune, addy mith, etc), and telling them where to go doesn't make them play any longer; it robs them of their sense of accomplishment. If there isn't any discernible feeling of progression they get bored fast. After literally dozens of people I did this for, I've started letting them explore on their own, and earn their own shit. It's worked much better, especially if I reward them with bonds for key achievements like dragon slayer. 
---
a fun history of trying to streamline new players in RS and its many failed attempts to back up my point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
3) after 5k plus hours in the game, and over 2100 total level, I can confidently say that efficiency, streamlining activities, and a lack of exploration are what will kill this game. When we all started we started exactly the same way in lumby, but instead of saying "now what?" and logging due to a lack of direction, we just explored the world. Running around and learning what shit did made the world feel huge and unexplored. Its something a large amount of the community desperately wish they could recreate. 
---
&gt;right but how as a new player do you find those things? that's part of the problem. you (probably) grew up playing games where objectives were pretty unclear, games nowadays hand feed the players directions and objectives. Someone who only plays modern games who has never played osrs will be totally lost.
---
you've said it pretty well yourself down here, my suggestion is not to change the core of the game for a playerbase that isn't invested and wont stick around anyway.
---
Sounds about accurate for my shitty phone battery.  It'll go from 50% to dead in a matter of second sometimes
---
I got in trouble for saying I finished my homework but played RS instead. My parents found out and took my keyboard and mouse. Told them I needed it for homework and was playing again. Needless to say they found out in like 5 minutes. So they took my keyboard away. Little did they know about the on screen keyboard. Until they came back in 5 minutes later. And that's why I couldn't play rs on my computer for a week in middle school

Khazard Warlord, Tree spirit, The Kendal, Black Knight Titan, Count draynor, and king roald. But maybe I could do another run at a fixed location on a fixed monster for 3 hours each to give a more accurate number, but based off what I saw it looked like I compiled more damage. Could be wrong.
---
God bless the souls on that unfortunate day
---
I didn't even think of that. Could probably buy and attain max in 1 day.
---
That's why cwars has potential. It's more than hits and zeroes. More interactions than DMM imo
---
He switched the dds to defensive
---
I am following the optimal quest guide on the wikia and I am not at the quest Holy Grail and I am pretty worried about doing it with my current character, what gear/stats should i have before trying it? Most of the videos I find of people doing the quest already have Rune+ gear.
---
Only rng if you don't have the heart of the cards tbh.
---
&gt; I can only speak for myself, but I‚Äôve always believed the first few hours of a game like runescape are meant to be played confused and wandering around the map. 
---
This was the case for me over a decade ago, but I have to wonder if the same applies to younger people today? How do other popular games nowadays handle the new player experience?
---
If other games handle it one way, and those people come into OSRS expecting something similar but get the current experience, they may not enjoy it or stick around.
---
The only game I can think of for this situation that's still popular is Minecraft. I last played back on version 1.5 or something (with Java), and if I recall correctly, it just outright threw you into the world with no tutorial at all. But if I heard right, the main version nowadays (Windows 10/Xbox/Switch/Mobile/non-Java) has a general beginner tutorial.
---
Then you have games like Roblox, PUBG, and Fortnite (I think I typed all those right lol); I don't know what the beginner experience is on any of those games, but I imagine it's easy enough to get into quickly and understand how stuff works.
---
It varies. You only need to hit 1 for arclight to lower his def 10% which is 27. Where as bgs can lower in the 60s plus is more accurate.
---
Shit pc RS has voice chat?!?! Black ops 2 lobby here we go
---
Never seen a castle wars thread get so much hate. Maybe this thread got botted?
---
I‚Äôve been a fan of castle wars since i was a kid. I think most people would agree it was one of the most iconic minigames of our childhoods.
---
Over the past 10 yrs i‚Äôve dabbled in an out of competitive castle wars communities and done my own share of private world matches and learning how to compete with the best.
---
It‚Äôs honestly very interesting. I‚Äôd love to see Castle Wars be given a shot.
---
&gt; this to new Ironmen players but they never listen
---
I put down a hardcore at wildy prayer training altar and he was like GG with no armor nothing just 1k dragon bones lmfao
---
My toilet skill is very high
---
Regular gargoyles do give you more cash per hour, mainly due to the long transition times between phases where you can't deal any damage.
---
Grotesques are mainly just good for granite cannonball dust and pet hunting, but they might be better if the Gmaul attachment gets added there.  Kind of a shame since they're a fun boss with neat mechanics.
---
people have wanted it nerfed for years, and void was taken out of the wildy for years for good reasons.
---
Oh my God hahahah
---
Acc ruined
---
what are you even asking?
---
You should use sand snake in there. It's one of the best.
---
So true. Imp box is so nice for ecu key farming.
---
Oof what a lad
---
TRUE LULW

I‚Äôm from Boston run into the same prob

It‚Äôs the wild. A lawless land where anything goes.

Or they could make a brand new f2p quest to adopt the Varrock stray dog. Two birds with one stone!
---
I'll have to give it a try, I need that good good xp
---
Ah that's a big ole RIP. Ty for explaining
---
You aren't suppose to camp range when they are praying range. Get them to switch to praying magic by firing a few spells at them before ranging them. If you freezes do hit, get within melee range of them before they unfreeze so you don't have to rely only on range to deal good damage. 
---
In these situations, you are fighting someone who does not fight back. Why does this need to be made any easier with a black d hide nerf when this type of pvp has zero risk for pkers?
---
Love the maxxed cover
---
Literally the only achievement that matters to me
---
Sheer volume of content so you're going to add content on top of that?
---
I did not contradict myself.  I didn't say LFR directly produces high end raiders, I said it helps bridge the gap.
---
You're nitpicking points, and your whole argument boils down to fussing about how things used to be without any actual substance, just a vague hand waving to trust you that it used to be better.  And you bring it home by saying it's good that people need to waste their time trying to put together groups in chat.
---
Your argument smacks of "well I had to put up with it and so should everyone else".  You're living the past.  WoW is endgame focused now, and that's a good thing.  No one wants to try a new game with their friends and be told they can't participate in the stuff their friends are doing for literal months.  But go on living in the past
---
Who cares
---
Wintertodt. After 99 fm I had 1m cash and plenty of uncuts and other goodies
---
What did I miss today? Christ I stop playing for 2 days and I feel like I already missed so much. This community is so damn interesting!
---
Yea, but that's not the GE btw.  That's the equipment screen btw.
---
At higher levels, around the time you unlock Nechryaels, you can start breaking even/profiting even if you cannon and burst every task so the extra money from Konar tasks becomes irrelevant.
---
Even at lower levels the extra 100k/task isn't worth it unless you're super low combat level or kinda lazy too because you could just do Zulrah or whatever your best moneymaker is to fund your cannonball usage and that'd still be faster than doing Konar tasks.
---
I looked through the other cwars posts after I made this one and this thread got a lot of hate, mostly people unwilling to tell me why they think it's bad. Haven't seen a very good counterargument other than, "I don't enjoy watching it," which is fine but mostly trolls. I don't think some of these people realize that this can only help the game, and DMM seems so short-term. There's no real base to build upon considering the horrible track record with how the tournaments go. They might be fun to watch the last few hours, but there are plenty of people who are extremely good at the game that lose to ridiculous stuff all the time near the end. A consistent competitive game mode is essential, and it wouldn't force anybody to play who doesn't want to.
---

I‚Äôve died twice I think, but it‚Äôs suuuuper easy to avoid it. Be quick to log out upon burn ammy teleing and if you‚Äôre clear at that point, you should be fine. Go get that helm my dude

Wyverns drop them nicely

It‚Äôs crazy dude. I‚Äôve gotten some nuts drops too. Dragon spear, shield left half, b2b KBD heads...
---
Dks are fun bro! Once you get in the swing of it.
---
That emote is garbage lol
---
I liked jagex's idea with nerfing it to 60% per spec since that would make it less relevant in the pure bracket while also maintaining some use in veng pking toward max cb, either with dh or not. I think that if you nerf it so that it's 1 spec max per tick, then it gives an extra tick for people to eat out of it, which is okay. It sounds like it would make a big difference for high skilled pures while making only a little bit of a difference to the lower skilled pures, as well as making risk fights less dependent on pid. It's my understanding that gmaul has the biggest issues in the pure bracket since it stacks so nicely with msb/emaul. I can't immediately see any downsides to this idea, and it actually sounds pretty good.
---

---
What if I don't log in every day? Or week sometimes? Do I lose that tree and xp? I have no idea what farming is. Or construction. Or hunter TBH. I understand construction is probably the most beneficial, but also super expensive and I spent all my cash on doubling bots. There's plenty of other stuff to keep me occupied though
---
Just buy a bond lol. 
---
Also, you have access to Varrock teleport (close to ge), falador teleport (why do you need a canoe to falador??), Skull sceptre (teleport to barbarian village)...
---
There's also the problem that the target demographic is older then it once was and no longer has as much free time so having to walk for extended periods of time just isn't the same when we were ten years old.
---
not to mention those GE prices are irrelevant to ironmen....
---
How about you actually fix the entirety of clan wars and bring back the Clan Chat system as well as an ELO system that supports 1v1s, 2v2s, 5v5s, 10v10s, and full out opts. Rather than throwing in all these band-aid fixes. This game truly needs an ELO system to bring in new players to the pvp scene and Clan wars has so much un-tapped potential to make it happen.
---
Inhale the cigarette boys. Hold it in boys hold it in. Now sswwwwwaaaaalllowww it
---
yeah eels aren't great but they're giga afk i did those alot while raiding in wow.
---
Likely because Jagex relies so heavily on App Store rankings and listings to bring in new players. Waiting a month could mean dropping further down the list = less opportunity and visibility to bring in new players.
---
Not defending but just something to consider.
---
People wouldn't have to safe is gmaul didn't stack you out for 130+, making it so you are never actually safe.

---
Removing Clan wars unskulling is lame and pointless. People are just going to suicide to remove skulls. Makes it a hinderance for those doing clues or finishing their pk trip and whatnot.
---
you wanna go do the "theatre of blood" it gives the best weapons bro :)
---
Yeah compared to other proposed nerfs, I just thought this would straight up reduce it's power without making it useless or changing it's purpose. IMO it probably shouldn't exist though. Any weapon designed to stack with others will always be very op.
---
Wowwwww whattttt... thank you for this....
---
Try talking to the tutors outside for lumby castle
---
I don't think it's bad game design either. It was fun to explore and figure out your own way. Or even after a while trying to find it online. Most games give you a linear objective which can get dull.

jagex tried to attract the WoW crowd with RS3/EoC and now they're trying to attract the MOBA/Fortnite crowd and ruin the MMORPG spirit that OSRS is good at
---
&gt; the game will die 
---
the game will die because jagex won't stop the spammers and botters, not because some new MOBA player can't fit in to an MMORPG

You've obviously have never made it into the 300 to 400 levels

Community yet again coming in clutch with ideas for these braindead devs
---
Dude just because people arnt agreeing with you doesn't mean they're ignorant people who have no right to have an opinion.
---
I've been pking since 2006, I had every pure you could think of up to 2011 and was in a lot of pure clans. You're opinion doesn't just become better because you think your some god pker.
---
Where are these canoes? Is agility gonna be ftp? I need details
---
I literally played the best performing xpac since WOTLK, then watched the game empty in the next xpac when people got fed up.  I had irl friends quit, saw Discords go from busy to empty, talked to guildies about quitting and read through forums.  I know what the fuck I'm talking about.  It's not the accessibility.  Because no matter what minor accessibility changes they make, those changes haven't affected the end game.  In fact, the hardcore raiding community wants Blizzard to make pro accessibility changes with things like capping azerite and removing split runs.  
---
And you're coming in here saying "nuh huh" without anything to back it up.
---
I've never understood people's complaints about Black D'hide. Sure it provides great mage defence for the cost, but there are mage offensive items which are also cheap (xerician/mystics). In addition, many people seem to be over-exaggerating the benefit and donning the mantra 'Max mage splashes against it.' Others have calculated earlier in this thread, that against a target wearing black d'hide assume both parties have 99 combats, even in xerics/glory/godcape (rags) with augury you have a ~50% chance to hit with barrage. 
---
Now while that may seem low, it's in keeping with the accuracy another combat style such as melee. 
---
I decided to do a Bitterkoekje calc of my own. 
---
I set one character to have just about BiS for melee. BCP/Tassy/Neitz/Tent whip/Prim/Torture/berserker ring/Avernic/Infernal Cape/Ferocious gloves. Also using piety + super combat
---
The target had the slash defence corresponding to the following gear: Addy plate body, Addy plate legs, Neitz, Glory, Mythical cape, Barrows gloves, rune boots, dragon defender. I didn't use any potions or prayers for the target. 
---
The accuracy of the near max melee on a person wearing addy was 54.18% It's slightly higher than the mage using 25k risk xerician robes for sure, but also doesn't have the utility of a 20 second snare attached. I've often heard people complain about missing "X" amount of casts on people with black d'hide while also using "max mage", but even using xerician with a 50% chance to hit after 5 casts there's a ~97% chance that at least one would have hit. 
---
If Jagex wants to make Black D'hide less useful in PvP I could be okay with that, but not if I have to be goon squadded wearing Karils/God Hides by a group of 50k risk TB/Barrager's. If you do something to nerf Black D'hide please tackle the overly cheap mage offensive items too. 
---
I believe the 'integrity issue' that Black D'hide poses is overblown, but feel free to down-vote away should you disagree with me.
---
Again, the issue is more with magic armor than with ranged armor.
---
Make Magic armor ACTUALLY useful. As it is, it's not useful: it lacks the melee defense that it logically should have (being strong vs melee), and has no defensive capability itself vs either range (logical) and barely against magic (why?).
---
Melee armor is fine: it has strong defenses vs itself AND ranged, as intended. 
---
Maybe it's intended to have no defense capability: they can bind and freeze people, preventing them from fighting back, but... that just seems foolish to me.
---
So again: Magic gear is more the issue than Black dhide. It's overpriced and has no defensive capbilities.
---
Yeah dude it's fucked.
---
I agree. There's 2 things I'd really love to see in this game. 1 is a clan system similar to rs3 minus citadels. 2 is boss kc hiscores.
---
Damn, didn't know I'd start liking little girls after watching one punch man.
---
We can't see the image you're referring to.
---
I‚Äôd love to frame it and put it in my room
---
While I totally support your point, in this case I understand. I took a class in User Interface Design and there I learned about why the user doesn't always know what's best for the product.  However, I would actually support a loser approach to updating this game giving the developers more freedom.  I think the team has the right mindset and ability to learn from things rs3 did right and wrong. I don't really see the need to poll everything, I will say that some of the purposed Song of the Elves rewards have me second guessing that mentality.
---
But... glories aren't f2p either...
---
Most calculators are wrong. They don't take level and the actual yield of herbs/patch into account. Try this one that has ultracompost, disease-free and level accounted for: [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bodjsg/yet\_another\_herb\_run\_calculator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bodjsg/yet_another_herb_run_calculator/)
---
Which phone btw?
---
This just gave me an idea: I'm going to do some wildy altar with regular bones to try to bait people for fun lol
---
This is coming from an ex top 50 wow player (quit after BoD), and I wholeheartedly disagree that addons do nearly as much for WoW as runelite does for rs. 
---
Weakauras and a solid understanding of macros/cvars(both of these are default and free to customise without 3rd party installs) are the only things that high level players would consider mandatory for high level raiding. You could include bigwigs in that list but realistically you can recreate bigwigs within weakauras. 
---
Additionally, the dynamic between addon creators and blizzard is different, with blizzard making official posts about how they **actively design encounters with boss mods in mind**. Runelite serves a different purpose which is to **fix broken or ambiguous parts of osrs**.
---
While you can go very far with addons (rotation helpers), most players either don't know or don't care because the base game is easy enough to navigate without them. 
---
Runelite, on the other hand, includes features that a large number of players would **expect** the base game to have anyway (I didn't know prayer reordering wasn't default until I scrolled through the settings - there are more significant examples of this but I can't think of any right now).
---
no just no please it's going to be a few secs before the girl be like Tekton-chan please be careful owo
---
Let's not.
---
Well Seymour, you are an of fellow, but I must say you stream a good ham.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy.
---
A lot of people use fixed because it‚Äôs better for everything except like blast furnace and construction
---
This has also been a thing since f2p was released
---
Could be. Now that I think about it, they're probably just farming for marks.
---
Isnt he called donnie?
---
It only takes them streaming it to be banned right? So many scripters get through...
---
Classic middle school art class locked ultimate Ironman
---
Correct, a lot of OSRS PvP has luck elements, but the winner isn't JUST the one who is the "luckiest" it's the one who can maximize their potential given whatever luck they get, and reacting to whatever random situation they're given in every second.
---
That's part of the reason there's such a huge gap in skill between players.
---
No, only the target the team is pursing is in real danger. The team itself is in no danger unless it encounter another team by chance. Wildy should be dangerous to everyone. Clan pking breaks this principle as there is no reliable way for clans to track down each other over all hotspots and worlds so clans can pick on solo pkers or pvmers/skillers most of the time if they wanted to. Nerfs to pvp defence makes this problem far worse in multi pvp than in solo pvp.
---
isn't he using a client to get that 2006 overlay tho
---
For sale?
---
WoD was hated for awhile. Legion classes were way more fun than WoD was, and I'd much rather have played Panda or my old Lich classes than go back to anything during WoD. Idk where you're getting this when almost the general consensus is that WoD was fucking awful storytelling and gameplay. BFA is also bad.
---
Again, as a solo singles pker you don‚Äôt know what ur talking about. Their is also a risk for anyone in the wildy, and it is already near impossible to die, can‚Äôt remember the last time I was killed at 44s, even with max teams falled in on me, it‚Äôs a fucking joke. Please know what your talking about before you start talking. It‚Äôs very clear to have never pvped before
---
Redirection scrolls from NMZ are good for this too.
---
I would fucking love this
---
I mean it‚Äôs like 8% chance to get +5 with spice, not that terrible. Of course getting the levels are good anyways, just depends if you‚Äôre rushing for the diary or not
---
Ever played stealing creation?
---
Im only upvoting to spread awarness
---
Another thing, I got a few people into OSRS and a lot of them appreciate how vast the world is but they do get lost. Not lost in the sense they don't know how or where to go but more like they have no direction. 
---
They talk to NPCs and half give helpful generic tips (which are basically rehashing what tutors and guides would say) the other half is just immersive, albeit useless text. So I, as a slightly more experienced player has to tell them what to try and do first. 
---
The only NPCs that give direction are quest NPCs and NPCs relating to higher (non beginner) level content (like Slayer masters). These Gossiping gals are a great idea as they add an extra class of "direction giving NPCs" so players brand new to RuneScape can come to grips with how the game plays in a mobile friendly format.
---
poop
---
Nice
---
Not all PKing is the bounty hunter kind (personally the most boring form of PKing imo)
---
That didn‚Äôt go over well when they removed tutorial island from the main game.
---
&gt; immersive travel
---
that ruins the entire point of the MMORPG adventure/exploring experience
---
jagex is trying to attract the new MOBA player crowd by changing the RPG spirit of OSRS
---
they should be creating a separate MOBA game if they want those kinds of players (though we've seen that jagex's other ventures outside of RS have all gone down in flames)
---
ECU keys have cool down timer in between getting them so banking is better then standing there tbh
---
Gotta make a whole new one now man
---
that's a problem on it's own. i want items to be permanently usable and not easily lose-able.
---
Great job man enjoy hot
---
one can get those levels in the first hour by doing particular quests. . .
---
All this negatively towards efforts of player retention seem short sighted and conceited.
---
I have played this game since RS1 and never knew you could smash vials.  My mind is blown.
---
Medium rush, but I have 70 smithing from getting quest cape... won‚Äôt take long to get a few levels. Trying to get agility up faster from 70 to whatever I can before that next elf quest hits. I‚Äôm gonna noose myself if 70 is absolute bottom tier requirement and it really means you‚Äôll fail 95% of the time.
---
Just for what it's worth, I'm not a maxed main, I've never had a maxed main, I've only been playing OSRS for 7 months and my account is only ~1800 total level. I got my quest cape recently and loved the early to mid-game, especially as a btw. I'm having a blast and want to make sure that the next wave of new players gets the same sense of exploration, planning and discovery that got me hooked back in when mobile came out.
---
I think they‚Äôre seeing that mobile brought a ton of people into the game that quit soon after tutorial island. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing these players probably thought they were downloading a typical easy mobile game but then realized you have to invest hundreds of hours into it to get to the fun stuff. 
---
So now Jagex is trying to dumb down the lower level stuff to keep these people.
---
Think it's meant to be separate goals :)
---
I fully support adding new content to f2p, and I fully support them making small changes to nudge new players in the proper direction. I have a problem with them straight up changing nostalgic aspects to the game. 
---
In the blogpost they said that they want to make all these changes optional, that way veterans can still have a nostalgic early game on new accounts. So I have no problems with helping new players and giving some p2p content to f2p so long as that is the case.
---
I love this idea

"Skilling contracts please"
---
I‚Äôm sure it dropped some basic loot for me?
---
I'm not sure if this is just a meme, or people really are so efficiency focused, but to me there are two things people can play RS for. Farming gold for RWT or playing for fun.
---
&gt; What would your proposed solution be?
---
I don't see this as a problem in the first place. And I want to express that opinion in a poll as Jagex promised to us from the start of OSRS, that players make the content decisions, not Jagex. You may see it differently, but that's what voting is for, to reconcile conflicting opinions.
---
you can't decide to just throw out the entire polling system because you feel like your proposal won't pass
---
&gt; I think a poll is fundamentally flawed in this case
---
and that's what jagex is going to regurgitate on us when they start looking at other changes in the future (don't forget that the HP -&gt; constitution change was billed as a change to be friendlier to new players)
---
Even if there are people at Castle wars like you said it has a lot more potential for more people, especially when it comes to clan wars. I want both of these mini games to succeed
---
False, this is a rehashed Skilling contracts post.
---
Why post 99 herblore xp?
---
I think the camp of "adventurers" near Draynor Village that starts the Lost City quest would be the perfect opportunity for this. When I was a new player, I always thought they looked cool and would have interesting information. The "you must be on a member's world" message always disappointed me and ruined the moment. The entire group can cover a large amount of skills and as adventurers, they could point players to various locations.
---
No u

Such a great idea man. I hope it goes through and you earn the credits you deserve!

Yes, that has existed since 2014 with osb/konduit though

Runelite not opening? It opened like 10 min ago but my comp was lagging to shit. After restarting my comp it just won't open. Im trying to re download it but it hits tje end then just nothing happens.
---
Edit: got it reinstalled and its working. Anyone know what caused this issue?
---
Your not proposing a solution though, you're just saying they should be able to handle it. But what solves a bottomless pit of new accounts being made that will always crop back up the millisecond you stop surveying them, and are lead by people who spend all their efforts trying to subvert whatever counter measures are put in place? The answer is there is nothing you can do.
---
I agree there are too many bots, but honestly when you put it in simple terms its easy to realize that trying to stop bots is just as impossible as trying to stop cheaters in other games, or pirates in real life. Otherwise all of those companies would've put an end to those problems as well. Sometimes all you can do is lose.
---
Gotta love that runelite feature
---

---

---
Amuuritiger?
---
I want to buy one of those mugs
---
No, its a problem that exists when there is competition over resources, enemies and all that. 
---
GW2 for instance doesnt have that issue. All trees, ore nodes or plants can be harvested by any player. Enemies drop loot for everybody that helped killing it, not only for the one that did the most damage. It doesnt really matter if people come to you since they wont stop you from getting stuff. Sometimes its better to have a large group since enemies nearby become stronger, drop more loot and spawn faster.
---
Altough GW2 has the issue it doesnt really have single player challenges, as the most difficult stuff like Raids cant be soloed due to mechanics.
---
Sounds good to me for new players. I have one change: only let the jobs be completed once per NPC/town (or once in general). That will wean new players as they learn how to play the game. It feel more real ("You've done everything I can think of"/"I don't have anything else to give away right now, sorry"). 
---
It also won't mess with the economy too much if there's any tasks that have relatively cheap requirements for an item/items that are worth much more. The two you have there virtually break even or are at a loss, but if there are others there is a chance for abuse.
---
Con: having to do "one small favor" again
---
I jest, but making it a quest might annoy some veterans. It might be easier if it was polled as a miniquest
---
But you're breaking efficiency by explaining all that.
---
Its a joke but there is some truth behind it. Maybe being all efficient is fun for some people, but for me it gets annoying to be repeatedly told by other players that something I do is dumb because its waste of time and not efficient.
---
There's a lot of potential, and this could be improved beyond my basic idea depending on how far they are willing to go. They could have dozens of dynamic NPCs like these in each area you could ask about such things, and give a separate minimap color to them so you can tell they are "gossip-able".
---
Another idea is you could ask them about a specific skill you're interesting in, and the NPC would give a summary about the skill itself and point you to a more skill-specific NPC who can give specialized advice and information about the different ways to train it. Essentially it would be a more detailed, and less hamfisted version of [Tutors](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tutor).
---
++support
---
This is a lie.
---
You dont need to make an entirely new tutorial. Just rework ol tut isle. Add more information, explain quests better, explain the map and so on.
---
Why not make a F2P achievement diary?
---
The hero jagex needs but doesnt deserve
---
But 90% of the tasks are members activities?
---
This would drastically change the requirements and rewards for the diary
---
As for adding a ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù level diary, it would be like kill a rat, cook some bread, make a bronze dagger, fish and cook a shrimp.. wait I‚Äôm just listing tutorial island now..
---
LOOOL foreal him and oakdice need to find the nearest bridge and leap
---
Why did u choose to make this weapons stats equivalent to a d scim. Make it atleast as good at a whip, same strength but whips slash as crush bonus. This weapon is t70, requires a grand master quest, degrades, probably quite rare from the gauntlet and it takes hours to get crysral shards to recharge it.
---
That's very true. Having it as a miniquest is a good possibility to introduce F2P players to that concept and to not interfere with quest capes.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with controlled assuming you aren‚Äôt a sweaty neck beard
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Down side to this is your unleashing bots on the mainland straight away. 50% if not more of bots don‚Äôt make it past tutorial island.
---
nah lol. you also cant repeatedly kill it.
---
32k cooked karambwans, someone in my cc suggested catching 35k so I did.
---
The first sentence...
---
Is this seriously why it was changed?
---
Should we also rename strength to bodybuilding, attack to precision training and defense to spread your legs and let me kick your balls till you can't feel the pain anymore, to make it more accurate and player friendly?
---
canoes are already f2p, there are trees you can cut in lumbridge, champions guild, barb village and edgeville near ge shortcut. You can also go 1-way into the wildy near the moss giants/black chins
---
&gt; for money doubling when I first started playing
---
Haha, nice.
---
All lvl 30? Or anything deeper?
---
sit kid
---
I think allowing people to use looting bag everywhere in a pvp world except safe zones would be awesome. It gives skillers high risk high reward
---
I will happily take some of that burden off you
---
The first canoe location you'd prolly come across is east of the river in Lumbridge by where the Goblins are. Afaik depending on your Woodcutting level you can travel all the way up to (and maybe past) Edgeville
---
&gt;Jagex are trying to mass appeal their game when OSRS is niche and out of most people's tastes. 
---
To the mentally ill who have no clue what this guy is talking about:
---
Making 5 mins of early game easier won't make getting 99 agility any more enjoyable.
---
I know, it was a shitty thing to do. But i've changed completely.
---
This is much better than the "new player welfare" proposed by Jagex (IE "oh you hit 5 att, here's a free steel sword).
---
Theyve tried a new tutorial like 6x and they all were worse than at retaining players than tut island. Thats why tut island is back on rs3
---
This needs to be a thing.
---
If you don't enjoy grind, first 5 mins being easier than before won't make getting 99 mining more enjoyable.
---
I prefer double emerald can provide a proff of this stupid luck of my
---
There's already a log transportation system that is extremely useful but nobody uses it.
---
max hit of barrage will literally be 14 against mage pray. let that sink in
---
Just be 50 rc from tears of guthix thats basically it.
---
New players also won't stay in this game for long after they learn what it takes to get lv99 in any skill.
---
But obviously, this is the only argument you can make - the one that adds nothing to discussion and inflates your imploding ego, since you just had your "gotcha" moment, even though you're literally fucking retarded and can't argue with facts.
---
I dont think they forgot it they never started dragonslayer so they csnt equip it anymore they got jagexed
---
PSA: reddit has an edit option.
---
I would recommend using OnTopReplica instead, it let's you do the same thing but for any window/application. So if you have downloaded stuff you can use it for that, or just use it for you browser.
---
Or have more then one monitor
---
Actually made me laugh lol
---
Nice.
---
They did this with fossil island with the notice board why not this!
---
Wasted talent
---
Yeah but people did that way before gmaul was meta. And... you should never ever be safe. Thats whats boring.
---
Just like almost everything in this game. It's about luck
---
"more CW maps"
---
Whoa slow down there pal I can only get so erect.
---
Should have translated to portugese.
---
a reason to talk to npcs outside of quests or getting a slayer task? cool
---
The account ‚Äùmaxed main‚Äù might not be online, but the player is for sure. If you live osrs that much that you have taken your time to max an account I dont think most of the people quit, I think they create an HCIM or UIM
---
And then you stick it in your pocket
---
Emerald sink
---
 And are inherently gimped due to it competitively.
---
Like Dragon Slayer 2?
---
PeePeeJohn
---
There is a difference. I don't know about other games, but in runescape a splash doesn't even get a "0" hitsplat. I'm pretty sure it's just a small animation of the spell splashing.
---
Im surprised to see no-one mention we already have 1 great example in the game right now:

Nah dude, new players are the future, fuck everyone who paid hundreds of dollars for membership over the last 10+ years, what matters is people who will play for 35mins (instead of 30, after this QoL change for noobs), and won't pay JaGeX a single cent, because grind won't become any more enjoyable if you don't enjoy it already.
---
I am F2P only player, and I fucking know what it feels like to be a noob, I always "was" one, I'm playing only the "demo" afterall, and I can assure you that F2P as it is, even if it's supposed to be a demo, is on it's very own enjoyable game. To me at least. The only personal problem I have is bots. That's the main thing that would drive someone away from this game, if they otherwise enjoy it but don't care about buying membership or are thinking about buying it but won't because bots are annoying.
---
But of course, instead of working on bots, let's make first 30 mins more enjoyable, they can quit because of bots later, what matters is higher temporary ratings, afterall, 35 mins of average playtime is higher than 30!
---
I would buy this printed on a mouse pad, pm me if you end up making that a thing!
---
Can't tell if this comment is a joke or not, in case it is. Manked won 15 1v1s in a row in all stars, does that mean he won 15 coin flips in a row? damn, he must've gotten so lucky.

vine patch at zammy altar in lvl 38, yep id include a farm run in my lap given i can note my zammy grapes there too.

Drift net vs barb fishing?  What‚Äôs better fishing xp if not tick manipulating
---
Absolute chad.
---
I remember back then every time zezima was spotted he never wore any gear which was odd since all high levels played fashionscape. Crowds would form around him if he went to popular fishing spots, or to towns like varrock and falador. I remember the first time i couldnt see him in the crowd because i was looking for someone in decked out gear but he was just standing there looking like an npc.
---
Visually? Amazing, otherwise? Pretty bad.
---
Jagex is powerless against the dragon queen! ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Because, apparently, agility cape only helps with run energy, which is like, the most useless part of agility, since there's only few niche parts of the game where you care about running long distances, everything else is basically do quest to unlock teleport to X location then never give a fuck about walking to there on feet again.
---
People following around Duriel telling everyone to bank their items as he massacres Falador.
---
No no no, they're arranged like spider's eyes all over his ass cheeks.
---
Yeah, I'm now considering a lot of things to help boost the progress of the account.

It‚Äôs an rpg man. There‚Äôs no one path to take. You explore, expirement and learn. That‚Äôs the fun part.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Graceful_cape
---
He makes a very good case for socialising and Lumbridge's facility as a hub being a keystone of retention. But this still leaves Jagex without a clear path forward. Moving the G/E would never pass a poll and moving the Tut island spawn from Lumbridge is out of the question. That leaves giving F2Pers of every level a proper incentive to go through Lumbridge.
---
It's not about winning or losing the vote. It's about the vote not accurately polling the appropriate population to begin with. If we did somehow get this idealized "new player" polling population and they voted against it then so be it. But when the vast majority of players are voting from the perspective of "well as a new player 15 years ago" and the topic is "fresh new player experience in the first few hours" you have to admit the flaw there. It would be like environmental policies being voted on purely by economists or economy policy voted on purely by enironmentalists. You could get lucky with an idealized outcome out of either by sheer chance but any results are fairly meaningless because in both cases the voters are out of their field of experience. This isn't about my opinion vs your opinion, this is about both of our opinions as experienced players being virtually worthless compared to that of the newbs actually impacted by the change that will likely never be capable of being polled. When you have the problem identified of "we can't retain new players" you don't ask the decade old veterans how to fix it, you ask the players you are trying to retain "what things would encourage you to play longer and get into the actual meat of the game." If you think X is the better option and I think Y is the better option, but the fresh players think Z is the solution but never win as either you or I always have more votes, that's a fundamental failure of the voting process. The tyranny of the majority is a very real issue in the realm of democratic voting and has nothing to do with "trying to shut down a vote you know you'll lose."
---
People always forget that Clan Wars has different maps
---
RS3 is far more of an rpg than OSRS is adventure and questing wise. Maybe even gameplay wise. The early game especially does a wonderful job of explaining mechanics. 
---
MTX  ruined it, shiny things, power creep and the store ruined it, but at it's core it's a great game.
---
Ironman RS3 is a wonderful experience.
---
That said, OSRS is still equal if not better community and execution wise.
---
Locker room talk
---
I agree, game is so damn boring and monotonous that it‚Äôs only ever going to appeal to people who played it back in the day.
---
Not necessarily, people can simply like a style or colour a lot.
---
Anyone thats actually played f2p knows it's plagued with bots. You'd think the oldschool team had it's own botfarm with how much they're trying to help f2p out. I wouldn't even mind but theres like 5 real players walking round on f2p and the rest are just bots.
---
Jamflex just milking the cash cow til the teats fall off. If making the bitch bleed means more flow what do you think they'll choose? History will repeat itself.
---
Not in Java my dude
---
thats a shit mentality and explains why you never improved at pking. Progress will be slow not non existent. You will see how you swapped prayers faster or u managed to 1tick your spec wep. Progress is tangible but slow.
---
Lost a dragon hatchet head by afking magics and a spirit tree launched it. Whoever was wcing with me that day made an easy 5m.
---
A lot of the plugins are really sloppy. For example the timer for imbued heart, if u use it during a block or attack animation the lightning around u doesn't show, and the timer wont activitate. Im sure theres other ways to see if a player used the heart. So someone saying something along the lines of "what u mean u CANT do this, EVEN runelite is able to do so" isnt really appropriete in my opinion
---
Hope u enjoyed getting those viruses too
---
I actually really like this
---
How does one set goals when they don't know what goals there are to set?
---
In my opinion it would be great to have these gossiping NPCs, especially the ones that point you towards quests or skilling spots. They could be help new players understand what there actually is to do. This, in turn would further allow them to set goals based on the things they are able to do at that moment. Besides, whether they reach their set goals will completely depend on the players themselves.
---
I believe that working towards and reaching your set goals is what really tests your character, rather then just setting them.

Bank tag tabs are a game changer. You can set tags on items like ‚Äúcorp‚Äù to easily find you corp gear for example. Then you can also create a tag tab from those tagged items to easily access them without searching.
---
Found the brainlet
---
You can do NMZ and buy herb boxes with the points. Do hard rumble, look up a guide or video for the right bosses to pick. You'll need the points later on for imbuing your shit, it gives good exp rates, and you'll make some decent gp per day if you do herb runs + bird house runs between NMZ entrys
---
Alternatively, you could get smithing to 73 and use the guranteed +2 boost from the Dwarven Stout(m)

What are you doing with tank gear? Dinhs has very little use

---
1
---
2
---
So the side of the increment does matter
---
59 pray is baller though and you need 1 def for it not to effect your cb.
---
Utility ring would be nice
---
"Or" not "and". You could still fuck it up, but the margin is small. And if you're still waiting for your pin to turn active you could cancel it and set it again at lumby bank.
---
If you read my comment, you will see that i addressed that and the point is to how much times have changed. When Zezima did the grind there were no guides, it was him figuring it all out on his own and probably not always using the most efficient methods. Today we have so much resources that maxing in 8 months is possible, even with 3 additional skills added.
---
It by no means was meant to shit on him, but now i understand what he meant when he said he quit because the game was too easy. If i struggled for years to achieve something that people today do in 1/6 the time due to guides and new content, i would be a little upset.
---
Pot tricking imp boxes doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be impossible. Unless they found some way to give the imp box animation priority, but probably enjin.

Your second sentence is hilarious, so me saying that you need context to set goals means I haven't figured my life out? What sort of logic is that? Are you trying to justify not attempting to learn anything further because people who have figured life out don't need information to make informed decisions? That is a definite sign that you don't just not have life figured out, you are in fact clueless..
---
What does he do there, I feel like people only like him cause he was a content creator.
---
Takes a laxative and helicopters out into the skies

Played my main from 2015 to the start of 2018. In that time I got 4 vissies: KBD at 52 kc, Wyverns at 3333 kc, Mith dragons at 500ish kc, and another from KBD at 4200ish kc.
---
Mod confirmed there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúyour spot‚Äù.
---
So you‚Äôre breaking the rules, falsely reporting... and wasting more than your own time.
---
How am I stupid? You make no sense  boy.
---
The reason I dislike him is because he was a content creator, him and SpermBank Live are awful. But more to the point, he literally brings nothing to Jagex imo, just says cringy shit at DMM.
---
seers regens run if you tele (might also need graceful idk never tried without)

Happens, if you keep staking over the next 1000 stakes you will see your win loss ratio even out to roughly 50/50
---
Me and my friend started Ironmen 2 weeks ago lmao.
---
Wait are you implying that you are not a full blown furry after that comment??
---
He said walking back to the bank (for items) sucks, not the quests.
---
I disagree, but a clan system would be very useful
---
The only time I feel like he does anything for jagex is host dmm not that well.
---
I very recently saw a video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ , that mentions drop off rate of new players coming out of Tutorial Island and mentions the traffic in Lumbridge as a main point for continuing to play, which I thought was an interesting argument and would like to mention.
---
Lol mod ayiza on the same tier as mod Ed, mod Ed is 10x better than ayiza.

Dinny B is like 6m and this guy spouting the ‚Äòmom‚Äôs credit card‚Äô shit lmao
---
lmao there is literally noone in vrk f2p wilderness today thanks to this shit.
---
Mobile, then resizeable
---
Haha yes, no one ever gets hacked. Jagex really does have the best account security.
---
they should instead focus on creating very helpful videos for new players. instead of some half-assed shit they created in the past.
---
All d'hide bodies have the exact same defense requirements, I don't see why they should have differing defense bonuses. Black should be better than red but the way in which it should be better is offensive range bonus since it requires a higher ranged level to wear.
---
You would talk to a slayer master who would then give you a slayer task that essentially is kill however many of X where X is a slayer monster appropriate to your slayer level, the higher your slayer the better/harder monsters you can fight which in turn drop better gear/items. 
---
Dying is an important concept to grasp early, that rule only applies to trade-able items in the game. For example the sword silverlight shown in your picture is not trade-able so therefore it would never drop upon death but say adamant leg plates could, the game bases the 3 items on value if I recall. I‚Äôm foggy with it because I‚Äôve been playing on an UIM account. You can lose untrade-able items in the wilderness up to a certain level of wilderness, if you plan on going into the wilderness be sure to check the wiki how far you can go in to the wilderness with untradeables. For example the graceful set from agility will turn into gold upon death on anything past wilderness 20. 
---
You can drop but not lose untradeables in the wilderness if you are skulled and die there and nothing will drop for the other player and you can reclaim said item just as long as you don‚Äôt die again on the way there.  For example the graceful set can be dropped out of your inventory in wilderness 19 if you die skulled. 
---
The death timer is 1 hour on the same world. So you must make it back to your items within 1 hour to reclaim items or they will disappear.
---
What I understood is that you mainly liked the lore and sense of progressing deeper into Daemonheim. I think that could be done for Raids III. I'll also safely assume that you don't like being able to bring your BIS gear into every raid and enjoyed the teamwork aspect. Is that basically it?
---
And everything has a sense if efficiencyscape to it. As much as I love raids, I don't think everyone that does it does. Some probably just do it for the money.
---
nice
---
Stretched Fixed please
---
U cant even get the task without the quest, makes no sense u can access the monster in a diff way without
---
For a diary task? I just think PINs should be part of the stronghold of security, like add an extra 5th floor that maybe gives you a f2p bis for having a pin
---
HYAH HYAH HYAH HAHAHA WWWOOOOOOOOOWWWW
---
That's not my point about fresh/saltwater fish but I don't see why, with the right protective equipment (so not bare hands to be fair) you couldn't noodle tuna or smaller sharks.
---
no, this isn't babyscape
---
The minigame tab will offer some teleports, leveling up magic wil unlock teleports and alot of amulets will give you some. Most of these are quite expensive for a new player so you will be walking alot at first :)  try to buy some energy potions at the grand exchance tho...
---
I mean obby Cape sure but everything else is fine
---
Mod Gee should be higher just for her cute feets
---
lookup into herb farming. You'll need to complete a couple of quests to get items (magic secateurs, ectophial) and xp (you literally don't have to train it at all; quest xp rewards is enough). When I started, it gave me easy and consistent money flow
---
Can the coll log show as green when you complete a category?
---
Yeh, it's a plugin on runelite. Can't remember which one it is though.
---
Can you rething your strategy regarding the imp box changes mentioned in the State of PVP blog? The proposed changes would practically make imp boxes dead content. Simply applying the changes to PVP worlds and low level wilderness would be enough to combat their unintended use in risk fights.
---
Stand outside edgeville and wait a bit. Eventually you‚Äôll see a team or clan teleport out or regroup. More often than not, they‚Äôll be willing to let you into their fold with just a simple ask. Or better yet, just wait for a small team of 2-3 and ask to join. Make friends that way, too
---
UAV Dragons deployed
---
Have you considered competitive castle wars?
---
Thanks!
---
How does the content team compute the gp/hr of bosses?
---
Gp/hr is based on three inputs - quantity of drops, value of drops, and kills per hour.
---
Obviously jmods have access to the exact drop tables so you know the quantity of regular drops. The majority of hydra's drops are pretty stable, being coins, alchables, or herbs. However alchemical hydra currently has about half the gp per kill from uniques (~71k from claw, ~14k from leather, ~12k from ring). In order to properly balance its drop table, you would need to put a value on the unique. Roughly how do you guys estimate what the values on these uniques are?
---
Also - kills/hr. How do you estimate how many kills per hour players can realistically obtain?
---
I've been getting fucked so hard by Jad. Thought I finally was gonna be good last time and accidentally double clicked protect from magic smh.

some worry??? im already selling off my accounts lmao.
---
You will still get someone sitting in the corner with a riot shield (dihns bulwark)
---
You think their is no upper management at jagex that provides direction for both games. Your cute little osrs core team is only a group of content devs. They have literally no say in the actual business strategy. Obviously you forgot osrs is a business. And some group of executive headasses that are trying to drive more revenue thinks this will increase new players and memberships. RS3 became what it is because these same upper management people tried to monetize every aspect of the game to the point of mtx, and it completely sucked the health of the game. If you don‚Äôt see this as the first step towards that you are foolish.
---
Please, I need it D;
---
It‚Äôs annoying if you know, useful if you don‚Äôt
---
 Two questions:
---
1. A  couple months ago there was a short discussion on dividing up the   graceful bonus among the pieces so you don't require the whole set to   increase your run restoration rate. Is there any news on this possibly  getting  polled in the future? Something like this would be really  useful for  activities where we can't wear the full set. One example  that comes to  mind is Blast Furnace.
---
2. Could  we see the implementation of Agile Armor from original RS2 at some  point? There's a few situations where stronger weight reduction would be  better than just using graceful. It would also promote "diversity"  among gear usage ...  and it looks a whole lot better than Graceful,  IMO. =) Maybe it could be  in cooperated as a reward in future content  or just throw it in Grace's shop for marks.
---
Thanks for reading.
---
No way haha! Some random dude saw me training at goblins and showed me zombies in the sewers and I lost all my black (g) from dying there. Zombies straight up taking a lot of noobs lives
---
If all stats are leveled near perfectly evenly you can even be base 95 without being allowed into 2200 worlds
---
There there little one. Don't rush it like game of thrones season 8
---
Which app? ^^
---
Can you add great orb project and runecrafting guild.
---
Add %2.5 xp boost to runescrafting robes so there will be a reward to rcing skill similar to other skills which have their xp boosting gear. Also a diffirent way to gain xp in skill. Xps should be less rearding than intense method. Maybe some new rewards like making pouches nondegreable.
---
Ahh 2008-2010 my golden years :') loved the hd update prior to them changing the looks of everything! Was fantastic:D trade limit never bothered me and i stil think the old bounty hunter was the most fun way of pking!
---
If you went to help F2P PKing, would you implement a wilderness rejuvenation aimed at F2P servers?
---
Bring back these graphics
---
Shit graphics. The day they changed full helms was game over for me. Glad we got the old graphics.
---
Oh it‚Äôs runelite
---
For real, the Q&amp;A thread is full of the same three people spamming questions about it each week. I even had someone whisper me and tell me they "had some good ideas about bringing attention to it, if i wanted to help".

Wow mate its one little thing that a new player might do once an then never again. He's not suggesting they implement the artisan skill

Never said this image was sexualized the fuck out of, even if I personally think it's weird.

I've started bringing 6 nats and 30 lavas for these drops, no rune items I just toss them and grab extra hides.

hard to tell but i think it‚Äôs sara halo, void top(?? could be wrong here but those look like void gloves as well which made me think top as), anti santa pants, villager sandals, myth cape and a mist staff with the upgrade

Or just don't be trash, Good player but tries to look too good at everything by doing super fast clicks even if they're not accurate like his pking clicks.

have NH brid on a pure for over a year without hiding defense options and not got a single xp.
---
i hate the change itself, not the idea of the commenter, change the imp boxes in pvp worlds, i dont care but let me bank my chins, as i said i dont care about pvp at all, jagex forces pvmers and skillers to go to the wild so even the worst pks can get a kill, so this was a way for me to combat those pks getting loot, now i cant bank my chins so i wont be able to go there at all
---
&gt; Point is this change will bring balance to the game and make it that tiny bit better 
---
making imp boxes useless will make wildy chins useless for me, i would not say thats making the game better
---
 thanks for caring enough to follow up tho

What phone is that sir?

Can combo food outside of Brews be removed the wilderness?

Fun fact: wise old man can give you contracts to do

Got this as a clue....device says hot. When i go either north, east, west, or south, it gets colder. Gone on all the squares around and it's got nothing. Any ideas? Have had a look at the locations on the wiki and whatnot but none seem helpful.

I can already see it... Loot from 100 hours of random npc tasks
---
I'm not familiar, what features ate you talking about?
---
Same people messaged me, the OC of this image about those ¬´ideas¬ª. They‚Äôve aldo reposted my content atleast two times before that I‚Äôve noticed - this makes three 
---
:c

I would argue that for a new player you do get a lot of instant gratification. Level ups and gear upgrades are quick and inexpensive and ramps up over time. It's not much different than other popular mobile games on the market in that respect. By the time you're grinding for hours to level up or hit the next big thing you've likely been at it for long enough to be relatively hooked. That is not a weakness of OSRS even in the current mobile gaming landscape.
---
The strength is the community, or rather what the community could be. Games like Clash of Clans became as popular as they are as a large part due to the community aspect, something that OP is pushing for more of built naturally into the game without diluting veteran player experience, since regardless of your new player retention OSRS will almost definitely always be mostly veteran players. 
---
A big part of the gratification of hitting a milestone is being able to brag to your friends about it. A big drop, a new achievement, etc. If you are dedicated enough to, say, get a firecape at lv18 or max a UIM then all you'd need to do to share the achievement is walk around the ge, but for any average player getting a rare item, an inferno cape, 99 in a skill, even a max cape is pretty run of the mill. Being able to tell your friends/clan is half the excitement.
---
Pushing for a better community for new players could be a good idea. At the very least it is unlikely to cause problems for those of us who have been around for a while.
---
Galaxy s10+!
---
it's not 2007 anymore. The magic is not the same. I see absolutely no problem in giving a helping hand to those completely new to the game. God damn some of you need to take off the nostalgic googles for 10 minutes and think about the future of the game.
---
Can we get more MTX / P2W options? You guys can mark them as integrity changes, it will definitely help retain more new mobile players since they crave instant rewards
---
Rofl this made me laugh

Is there anywhere to PK at a low level?

I just started playing again and my character has a combat level of like 25. 
---
Is there somewhere or some world I can go to to find some low level fights?
---
I can see how starting in f2p would be a big turn off. It‚Äôs full of bots and spammers because there‚Äôs almost no barrier to entry. Tutorial island is botted and you don‚Äôt even need a verified email to play.
---
Does OSRS really even have a f2p community?
---
This is actually a RL gpu bug and I don't know why it does that.
---
Yep look on the right tab for screen markers, it should be over of the furthest down options
---
Wow I love this style of cartoon
---
What are your thoughts on introducing a Crystal Mace / Wand, and making crystal armour a higher tier hybrid armour like Void Knight? It would have higher defence / prayer, but degradable, and its effects limited to crystal items.

What is Jagex's stance on 3rd party clients and what steps do you plan to (or currently) take to prevent players from gaining unfair advantages by using them?
---
The primary way for people to become pkers is by pvming and learning to fight back, then anti pking the pvmer killers, then killing pvmers themselves, and then finally killing pkers. It is the most effective way by far due to it being much easier for newbies to kill pvmers and bots that don't usually know how to fight back effectively. Yes the people killing pvmers are bad at the game, killing pvmers is how they get better.
---
Many people started off by killing green dragons. Many rev teams started off by protecting each other while pvming. What you are saying is completely untrue. The most active times for the wildy have been when the best money makers were in the wildy and not outside of it, as they all are now.
---
I can't tell if you are new or not but if you are interested in pking, I encourage you to go and kill the bots at east green dragons. You don't even need ice barrage or a range switch, just ice burst or blitz them, they have no mage defense. You will make a bit of money and will stop panicking in fights (not insulting, almost everyone panics when they're new, my heart was beating fast as shit every time lol).
---
What are your plans to get a handle on the various species of SPAM bots at the g e?
---
Bot beggars, dice bots, scam bots are all running rampant at g e in most worlds and it really gives our community a bad image.
---
Can pie halves be combined into full pies somehow, either through the Bake Pie spell or maybe an NPC?
---
Yes, they get the pmod symbol instead of an ironman symbol.

Awwh shit I was wrong then looking at it again. It's definitely not sexualized, just weird imo.
---
Shhh, this is r/2007scape  we don't use logical arguments here.
---
Can something be done about house advertising on world 330? Currently, if you want to host, you have to run multiple accounts with auto-typers to be seen.
---
I would suggest something similar to the TOB board, and maybe it could show the hosts construction level, house layout, and maybe a very small message the host could write. Additionally, clicking on the host on the board would send you straight to the house.

Can we get the option to hide which world we are currently in. This would make us still able to write with our cc and friends with not having to turn off everything as this is the only reason we are able to hide the world we are in to others currently. This would be every beneficial for people streaming or people doing wilderness content.
---
Not going to watch the thing right now, but lots of bots get banned after tutorial island which might skew statistics.
---
I honestly dislike these graphics. It makes everything darker and more dull, and most of the textures don't do much more than add grainy noise.
---
If you overheal with brews and you‚Äôre a decent level he cant 1 hit you, but unless he spawns off screen and cheeses you, you shouldn‚Äôt be dying to him anyway.

They are the best way for Ironman to get basic talismans also.

Most RPG's follow some sort of concept like this to add to the immersion. There is just a tad bit of this around runescape, but not to the point where it can actually give you some sort of direction. Would love to see something like this in the game, this is how you hook new players.

This is RS. We all playing shirtless in between COD and Halo sessions while we drink Mountain Dew and eat Doritos.

No.

Jad was meant to be the hardest nvm challenge of its day. I'm okay with the fact that it took me 6 try's. Ya know why? The feeling of satisfaction, pride, and accomplishment outweigh the difficulties you had to push through to get there. You will get your fire Cape! I believe in you!

jad only maxes 97, just eat
---
You've been ftp for 10 years? What have you been doing?
---
First off it's ugly and most pk build accounts don't like any def that isn't quested. 
---
A lot of people get their stats to the max at that combat level before pking.  So if that def moves you up a combat level you could be 3-4 str/ranged levels behind your opponent at the same level.
---
ahhh I get it now

Sounds like your sick of looting spades

I use my slayer ring tele to niece's cave
---
osrs isnt for new players. have you seen the game we play? it looks and plays like absolute shit. regardless over 100,000 veterans love to play the game. games like wow are more popular, that doesn't mean we need to be more like wow. the community should have the say in the direction the game goes. this is 2012 all over again and those shitty weird dragon slaying tutorials of 2009.
---
Your username suits you well.
---
You see an altar.

Blaze it.

Think this may be the one to go for to start, as I can always take the stats up if I want but cant change it down with the other builds. just gotta finish the 77 slayer grind now .

When they despawn they jump back into the river

If you nerf black d'hide, would blessed dhide be nerfed too? I think blessed d'hide should maintain its current stats since it's a bit more pricy and not used as pvp nearly as often, and the main argument for nerfing black d'hide is the price value when blessed is more expensive by a good amount but a bit less than Karils I believe.
---
Or they are the newschool wanker and picked MWR :think:

I don't think this is weird. A lot of the dialogue is masterfully written and very enjoyable, especially through quest lines. I'm not one to just hold spacebar through it and never read, I think what the NPCs say is half the fun.

I recommend the game Undertale to you. It's absolutely full of lore from NPCs.

I would strongly recommend cash rewards for every player, maybe only 50-100k for the last place. 
---
This idea that pvp has to be a cash sink whereas pvm and Skilling can generate as much gp as they want is one of the reasons we're in the predicament that we're in. 
---
Fund it with a GE tax if you have to, lock it behind requirements to prevent a abuse if you have to, but let's not see lms become dead content again

How do I know you‚Äôre a lvl 100+ in an obby cape?

what a terrible image

Did it with a kitten last night, took around an hour. Died a little on the inside.

damnit now I can't unsee that

I never said it was, I always get them on my accounts, it's actually my next upgrade I'll be getting after black mask, either that or the archers ring :)

Osrs is one of the best games for this imo, so many unique and crazy dialogues

Don‚Äôt have to run them but I would love to.

High quality 2007 graphics my guy, get em while they're fresh

What exactly are you flexing, your acc is utter shit and nobody gaf you don't train hunter.
---
Then you don‚Äôt have to run them but I would like to see this update
---
Why flex with embarrassing stats
---
Snare isnt needed. In 1v1 you can walk from lvl 1 to 48 to 1 to 48 before you run out of food. Even if a 20s bind existed, you aint gunna kill someone in single who wants to escape. F2p is extremely imbalanced in single outside of no arms. It magically found some balance ib multi and snare isnt needed in multi either.
---
Holiday tradeable items (e.g. Partyhats, H'ween Masks, Easter Eggs, Santa Hats etc.) are often dropped by JMods during the appropriate season. They're intentionally kept at a low price so they don't inflate similar to the RS3 variants.
---
Regardless, they're fairly cheap if you want to buy them. For example, a Blue PHat is 20k.
---
This is is a bot guys just ignore him
---
Clan Wars, Duel Arena, Castle wars etc are fine, but in order for one to practice there they first must:  
---
1) Spend hundreds of hours in training, however that's fine
---
2) Spend even more time, grinding cash in order to purchase dclaws, ags etc  
---
2.1) Buy gold from gold selling websites, and save more time &amp; money  
---
A great solution to all of this would be dedicated Tournament worlds, where people set their stats, grab their gear and practice.
---
U can def beat zul with those stats u just need to learn the rotations better. Ahrims would help a lot tho. Zul is going to be a lot better gp than barrows once u learn it.
---
For the PvP changes: If you were teleblocked and killed the person who did it you'd be able to teleport. Can you also add so that if the person who teleblocks you either logs out or teleports away removes the teleblock on you.
---
F2p isn't "the early game".
---
Was it broccoli Rob?

I have 3500 logs in my bank from wood cutting so fire making should be easy

If this is out in the wilderness then you gotta invite the butthole goonsquad. They need to protect their wilderness from goblin boys

I forgot these were even in CW. Holy shit the nostalgia.
---
This would be like if the desert diary reward gave you a teleport straight into the KQ lair. Because the Karamja elite gives you a teleport to both the gem mine and Duradel. There is literally no reason to use the Karamja shortcut
---
But having a minigames teleport is fine, very nostalgic
---
And if the reposters spent more than 20 seconds making their subpar ThamSceptre shill posts I wouldn‚Äôt mind, but here we are

Yeah i see your dilemma. This is why I respect people like /u/25buttholes for his high quality goblin boy slapping original content

No one cares about miniquests, especially new players. You'd need a hell of an incentive to do it.

Laptop's will use an buildin gpu or something over your actual gpu so you have to tell your laptop to use your actual gpu for runelite. I found a guide how to do this on a runelite github. Just search on google and you will probably fins it

Your arguments make no sense.  Saying WoW being accessible is driving away new players make no sense.  An MMO is too easy so people would rather play battle royale?  
---
Blizzard is releasing Vanilla WoW for the same reason Jagex released old school 5 years ago: people will pay for nostalgia.
---
And again, you're not actually arguing any real point.  To repeat my last reply, you're just coming in here spouting nonsense about "accessibility killed WoW because I said so".  
---
But I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm a recent active player who friends in end game

Firefox dropped Java integration a few years ago aswell.

you can build a bank chest on the island if you dont want to use 2 teleports every run
---
You have my "YES" vote on a poll.
---
You telling me the Ivandis flail isn't the classiest weapon ever?
---
For real the reason the PvP community is dying is because they don‚Äôt pass any polls and get any updates and the reason they don‚Äôt pass any polls is because the community is getting smaller and dying.
---
Something needs to be changed in regards to polling PvP updates if Jagex actually cares about having a PvP community at all in the future. For example, I think polling BH updates to players only with a decent amount of BH kills would make sense as any effects BH updates will have on the rest of the community are *super negligible* whereas they are *huge* for pkers.
---
That's the conclusion I've come to. People are very mixed and most wouldn't appreciate the depth behind the plays
---
. . . Yes, so you walk there from canifis
---
If u do this then make the chaps/vambs 1 def as its just a nerf vs pures at that point otherwise.

Oh the nostalgia! I actually remember meeting Zezima here for the first time.

It would be cool to see some mock ups of a visually revamped version of OSRS. This exact look here isn't ideal, but I think at least opening our minds to something new isn't a bad thing

Bloods are like 500k gp/he for being pretty dsmn afk. 35k xp/hr ain't great but it's way better than afkng like fishing or something

One reason I grief/crash Ironman whenever possible is because of that helmet. If there was no easy way to distinguish who was an ironman and who isn't the number of irontards in the game would probably drop by half

Can the ladder in seers village bank be moved to the other side of the room? On mobile it‚Äôs quite hard to click the start of the rooftop agility course as it is and I misclick on the ladder a lot of the time

You guys really hate f2p players. We're already going to force them to do Agility, now One Small Favour? Let's really fuck with them and make Rat Catchers f2p while we're at it.

Lmao, so many tears of salt are dropped by commenting people

Supposing that they weren't at the level where it gives 20%, farming marks would be done at canafis because you receive them faster there

I usually go up and get 2-3 kills at grotesque farts just for fun and the chance of pet or unique drops everytime I get a Garg task. Why not. But I def wouldn‚Äôt camp there.  I usually only average like 30-50k per kill which isn‚Äôt much better than normal gargs, but that‚Äôs not counting supplies and time it takes for the kill.
---
I agree with this, back in the pre-GE days Lumbridge was popping with players of all levels so new players entering the world had veteran players as their bridge. Now most of the playerbase is just training remotely or are at the GE so freshly minted players don't have the same opportunity to see what the progression looks like the minute you enter the game.
---
A noob is supposed to see a guy in full rune and be like "Oi how you get that blue armor?" And then the guy in full rune is supposed to lure the noob to the Dark Wizards so when the noob dies, the guy in full rune goes "L0l finish Dragon Slayer noob." So then the new player now has a goal (and hence subgoals of smaller quests) of getting that rune platebody.
---
Instead that noob talks to the NPCs and learns jack shit, heads to Varrock to only get ignored by players who turned Public Off cause the RNG game bots keep spamming the shit out of GE.
---
Non original post but I like your outfit
---
Also none of those address things like d-spear + mace clans, how underpowered magic is (you cop out and say D hide is OP instead?), minimal reward at npcs like chaos elemental and lava dragons. Things that actually would increase the volume of people pking.
---
Good times
---
I‚Äôm not artist but why do you use a figurine? Do you use one of these for every drawing and just make it different props to hold etc? Do you use a 3D printer to print out your own figurines and props?
---
I‚Äôd agree but a team of 4 made a an hd client a few years ago and it was perfect. The old school team made them remove it because it could be seen as a bot program. So the team then gave the project over to osrs team and they have hade it ever since. I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôd like a breath of fresh air when it comes to the graphics(I don‚Äôt see how you could argue with me, considering you wouldn‚Äôt have to even run hd if you didn‚Äôt like it) yet I see so many people trying to control other peoples experience and they can only say that‚Äôs not osrs. Witch to me is a bit over the top since they wouldn‚Äôt have to run hd at all. It the same way as anytime an better way to train a skill comes about(that‚Äôs not how I got my 99) 
---
To sum it up I‚Äôd be fine with it taking time to make this update seeing as most updates fail anyways
---
I'm super sure that won't have any complications in clan pvp!
---
Ah, might get my rear kicked tbh. My stats are very spread out. I only have 37 magic 11 ranged. 27/28 atk def. 
---
I have some decent members items but people with more money would prolly be ahead so I guess it would be good to stick to f2p.
---
I don't really know anything about bounty hunter. That is after my time tbh. I "quit" around early 2007.
---
I guess I can look into it. 
---
Also, Obby Maulers? at 26 combat? I would get destroyed by that im pretty sure. thats 40 strength levels ahead of mine. Dunno what that hits. I hit 10s with my best spell.

Scrapyard? We all know rust was the true test!
---
Use the infinite token trick
---
Leave and come back after each kill right by the door and it'll never tick down. I can't remember the exact trick, but I think this is how it works. It's definitely real.
---
The problem is pvp itself, it has encouraged toxicity in the community throughout the years.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I get that attitude a lot on my low level hc, but only because other people are selfish assholes as well. 
---
The other day I was killing kalphites and this level 123 comes charging in stealing all my kills like he‚Äôs the important one... just because he‚Äôs got better skills/gear...

Ironman do have an unfair disadvantage from the other players because we‚Äôre forced to build everything from scratch and it takes a long time to get even mid level weapons. 
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean people have to be fucking rude...
---
I thought that was patched?
---
2 def doesnt really ruin an account. its still playabale dude
---
That‚Äôs some hyperbole. Konar is good for slayer points every 10th task.
---
Also pretty much saying ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt high level hyper efficiently do every task don‚Äôt do slayer‚Äù is some bs gate keeping.
---
I've talked to people like this, they just leech off their main during solo/duo runs, the acc doesn't do anything basically, probably doesn't even go in to the boss fight, so not as impressive as you think.
---
More dps means less time to run out of food. I've killed zulrah once and every time since then I've just been leaking food constantly and not dealing enough damage. Would definitely encourage the best gear he can afford.

haha never heard this one before (about 30 times)

They need an ingame ranking system for the must popular categories. People love a good cape, maybe members of the current #1 clan could get a cosmetic. Categories could be 1h cap pkri, 50 vs 50, 20 vs 20 (firing out ideas here no idea what is popular anymore). I would judge #1 as all out 1h cap in dangerous mode (note dangerous should be updated so that loot can be looted).
---
Housan???? No shit?? I knew him irl! Didn't know he was the first to max melee. My friend played on his account and trained his prayer back when he was still grinding 99 at ecto. This was in like 7th grade lol, that's wild.
---
What does soaR stand for? I'm having trouble finding an answer in Google.
---
The average yield at lvl 99 with farming cape and secateurs and hard kandarin/kourend diary (but no elite morytania) is 10.45 per patch. Potentially more with attas/iasor plant growing.

I'm 500kc dry without barrows gloves T_T
---
Same, i thought this was going to be an Excel joke
---
Poll a quest and its rewards? Sure. Poll BiS items? Definitely. Poll an item recolour or a small improvement for new players to improve retention? I don't see why it's necessary to poll this, to be quite honest.
---
If we had infinite time, sure, go ahead and poll every change no matter how minuscule. But since that's not the cases you have to draw the line somewhere. The development cycle of this game is already long enough, there are some things that don't benefit from polling at all and would only get stuck in the backlog if they were to be polled.
---
Polling is only part of what makes OSRS great: which is player-dev engagement imo. You didn't like the Draynor dock, and the devs heard. You wanted hidden poll results and you got that (mind you, hiding poll results was a poll question once and it too failed).
---
Making Teleblock F2P was a decision based on recent input from the PVP community a few weeks ago. Why should the general public vote on something that affects only a really small subset of people?
---
That being said, I'd rather them go about this like they did with the Treasure Trails expansion: ask for community suggestions and then go with what they think is the best option.
---
Defense is used by people who don't pk generally speaking such as bulwark. You're not angry that pking is harder, you're butthurt it's gonna be harder to pk people pvming/not actually fighting back lmao.
---
Yeah all of the accounts at that combat bracket are very strong due to how they've min/maxed their stats. I wouldn't recommend it, but you wouldn't be risking much so if you're feeling like getting you feet wet give it a try.
---
support = support + 1
---
As long as you keep absorb around 1000 it‚Äôs not a big deal if you‚Äôre a little late with the overload. Yea you‚Äôll waste some absorb but you‚Äôll get so many points a little wasted absorb won‚Äôt matter

This terrifies me on a whole other level... üò∂

This man sounds like he‚Äôs trying to kill some one training prayer in the wild altar üòÇ yikes y‚Äôall pker‚Äôs really be wanting just a bunch of free stuff. Nothing funny then a cute noob try and kill you in the wild while you train prayer.

The fact that it does not address your character by name is a dead giveaway that this is a fake email.

Can big bones become big peaches with bones to peaches? Even if they only heal +1 more than a normal peach, it just really breaks my immersion.

Awesome. Imagine almost no one had the combat level like Zezima in 2003.
---
Can smithable pickaxes be added into the game? Unlocked via Perils of Ice Mountain (Release date: 7 May 2008) or some other quest/miniquest?
---
How does that mean more to your point? It looks like your point was confirmation bias means you never hear about people who quit because they're not here - I was just saying that's not entirely true because some people quit but are still in the subreddit, so you will have heard of them.
---
I never really thought about it like that before. I guess you're right.
---

The game has more players than OSRS will ever have.

Theres a barb assault pet?

Yes you easily can, but the Verac plateskirt along with it‚Äôs high defence has +4 prayer. So you could take that into account when adjusting your gear
---
11/10 idea. Full support
---
Can you please stop with the "we gotta implement this unpolled stuff" before you even start, thanks!
---
Don‚Äôt fall for scams/tricks  such as doubling Gp in-game or outside of games like emails/links/browsers to doubling xp/free membership/hacked etc.
---
You must not nh where people camp pray melee 24/7
---
Rip most people had quit before 2009
---
if I went and challenged anyone to NH they're gonna be in BiS pk mage gear and barrage. The only people who fire surge are the off people tryna get a TB in because entangle is so trash compared to barrage and huge part of NHing is getting your opponent frozen.   
---
IDK why people on reddit like you think that your wrong opinions are worth listening to, but they aren't.
---
lol ok i would have assumed it was at least at the rate of an overhead. I've never bothered to use it and also didn't realize it was so cheap to buy.

---
So from what I could see of your stats I would get a membership and start slayer.
---
Don't get my wrong I'm not the type to dick ride slayer and say it's the best thing in the game but, with training slayer you get constant combat exp range/mage/melee, and at about level 70 you start making money from your tasks. If you've not done many quests I'd reccomend starting the quest/stat grind now so you can have the best free gear available whilst training. If you want to wait on slayer and combat stats I would reccomend something like WINTERTOTD due to its money/xp per hour, dont get me wrong it wont be much money but it's a quick 99 to get you into a better mood overall about the game and very simple also. You could work on your agility, agility gives some great boosts, once you have unlocked full graceful your run energy will last longer and recover faster even when you are not wearing the outfit your run energy will recover faster

My best before getting DHCB was 1:56 with eagle eye, no woox.

Scaling-wise, I can. Java itself has native UI scaling built-in for AWT, and it happens automatically on Windows, along with being able to be adjusted with a flag on other OSes.

---
Honestly, I like questing a lot and have been somewhat lost since I got qpc. But if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't prioritize doing multiple quests every day. Just knock out like 1 medium/long and maybe 1 short along with it and do some more of what you actually like doing in the game. That way quests don't seem as much of a hassle. Also if you can, try to do the quests in the order of their questline (maybe just me but it's more enjoyable to finish a story)

i do my birdhouse run/kingdom/battlestaves/farming together so i RoW to misc, rake weeds, fossil island tele to birdhouses, tele to zaffs, tele to ge to bank, then spirit tree to farm guild. but i'm inefficient and usually only do one birdhouse run a day so ignore me i guess.
---
You're missing the point that mage is supposed to be the most accurate combat style, as it is supposed to counter melee in the combat triangle, and it's only real counter to melee is keeping the melee at range, due to the incredibly low melee defense stats on mage armor. The issue here is that melee can wear black d'hide and further negate this weakness.
---
Also it isn't a fallacy at all. While it might not be the most common, there is literal video evidence of it happening and it shouldn't be able to happen at all.
---
Also in your calculation what is the person wearing the black d'hide also wearing? Are you giving them a glory, a mage arena 2 cape and potentially a black d'hide buckler or bulwark? Black d'hide is op in conjunction with all the other free mage defense you get on gear.
---
Bring back the decent special attack from release. Deets are fuzzy but I recall it had a really high chance of hitting your max. Look at old I mahatma I ok videos for an idea.
---
Yea to be fair my second time going through UP was a breeze, and then after that the quest is pretty easy
---
farming on a main? lmao
---
Mining is and has been my lowest for years haha, IMO it is the most aids skill by far. It's personal preference. If you train mining with motherlode it is the slowest skill.

Don‚Äôt let FaZe see this they will buy a team of trickshotters for pking

Doesn‚Äôt change the fact it‚Äôs a strawman argument no one will ever ask for a random bow you made from fletching to be buffed

It really does. There‚Äôs another top post about making cw the e-sport and he suggested new maps, which partially inspired this post.
---
Nice stats to start of again, do u have dragon defender, helm of neitiznot, fighter torso, avas accumulator, fire cape? That would be my goals. And of course the barrow gloves and train some slayer / doing clues in the mean time.
---
Haha I get it because pures are disabled

I feel like this is an absolute must for an RPG in general...

Spamming everything he says is the most desperate thing I‚Äôve seen for attention. He may be a cunt but you‚Äôre annoying which is worse.

True so it wasent like all the time 1.5min?

50/50 like all things
---
Hold up. How do you use runelite to block defensive styles? All I saw was if you‚Äôre on defensive style your combat option appears in red text.
---
since they will remove the only counterplay i have(im combat maxed so i guess i could fight, but i really dont want to) to those pks that are after skillers and pvmer i just wont go into the wild anymore, it just makes me sad that the best hunter method is locked behind stupid pvp bs, that makes no sense to me

i cant think of any other usefull reasons to use imp boxes besides the thing i wrote, so i guess they will be dead content after the change...

Just make it like ring of suffering, feed it rings of dueling

I think this would mostly benefit tribrid pking, especially pure tribrid pking.

I've come back to this game since playing in like pre 2005 I think. And I understand they are scared to make changes because of their terrible changes before (watched some history on youtube, funny stuff and no idea how someone could even think of those bad ideas). But the lack of QOL improvements this long since OSRS was released is pretty disappointing. And the mobile port has some blatant issues that you would think they would have fixed if they played it themselves (hold for right click but keep menu directly under where you are holding?).
---
Biggest change I would like made to the mobile version is make it so you can't click to move to the top and right of the map, I want to move to the edge but often actually click the ground behind the map. That and clearly the right click menu is terrible.
---
This humbling was brought to you by the even higher iq reddit community
---
Yes, if a person is arguing with you that an update shouldn't happen, they probably don't want it.
---
Your reading comprehension is pathetically bad lmfao.

The devs are too scared to have ideas.

I mean to say they definitely sell gold on the side to make sure they profit either way
---
1) From personal experience they weren't too hard to get started. I personally got a gist of it in a handful of games. Obviously nothing in depth and at a very low skill level, but the loop of kill stuff -&gt; get strong -&gt; take objectives is rather simple. Why I think rs is lacking here, in that it takes forever to get into spot to pk (especially from new player's perspective, who say saw a stream of someone pking and wants to get into it), both due to stats and starting wealth requirements -- compare this to moba where you click "find match" and you're already playing in a minute or two
---
2) these 3 points were just about games in general -- I agree rs has good skill ceiling
---
3) I was more so talking about spectating in esports sense, where I'm adequately presented with whole situation; kinda separate from watching someone's pov video. Like if you watch dota, you have someone overviewing the map nicely, and not the screen of some player panning and clicking all over the map, if you get what I mean. They tried this too at one dmmt that I watched, but to me the phase before singles was just looking at an anthill and very straining to try to grasp everyone's actions; and the singles phase felt kinda like watching rock-paper-scissors -- the skill difference or outplays just don't translate well onto the screen. Just to be clear I'm not saying it doesn't take skill to tribryd, but just that ruleset of 1v1 until death isn't fun to watch, and that such design kinda lacks more explicit objectives to be enjoyable.

If you plan on doing slow melee slayer, prims. If you want to train it quickly, sell tassets and torture and buy a kodai wand for burst tasks and just use prossy for cannon tasks.
---
Anyone remember the graphical update that made everyone look like Smurfs and had big heads
---
I wasn't sure how to handle that. I was going to let them drink it for like a 1 time damage bonus on a ranged attacks, or if they are patient and craft with it they can make a more potent ranged attack potion. Since you can't consume in Runescape I thought it would be fun to let them here and experience the addictive quality of it. Maybe if they come across it again they wouldn't be able to help themselves and trigger a trap.
---
Oh my bad I forgot the /s. People like you are the reason osrs gets suck a bad name and never moving forward I bet you probably voted yes for warding. You seem like that type of guy

Bruh, nothing even compared to that MP40 though. Know what I ran? Mp40, extended mag, double tap or juggernaught were my top 2 and sometimes stopping power. Literally, 3 shot headshot without stopping power with a 50ish round drum? Shit was stupid. Literally walk around every corner with the trigger pulled and noone could kill you.

you can use runelite agility plugin. it show where you have to jump with green overlay, if mark spawn the overlay will be red so it is hard to miss marks.

You need 260 marks of grace for the full set.

probably the same as the most efficient way to maxing considering how it's 77 more levels to max once you get to 2200

I mean I completely understand that and to an extent agree with you. My point to this whole discussion was to see why cosmetics are so loved but no one wants to use them. 
---
I was all about the fashionscape back in 07 and remember when the items were worth a lot because of the rarity of clues, clues were actually hard since there was no wiki, and so on. I know it will never be that way again, just feels like people want cosmetics because it gives them the nostalgia of 07, but anything to do with them is heresy

you could but imagine being able to just click the tab, refill and be on your way vs click the tab, hop worlds, wait on a load screen, find a host, wait another load screen, refill, tele to whatever youre doing and then probably have to hop(and another loadscreen) again bc all the good spots are already taken on w330
---
I completely agree with you, except on the point of popular MMO - you achieve popular MMO BY making it the best MMO :P.
---
This isn't about adding accessibility to everything, this is about making sure in the first few hours of playing, we equip you with the tools to ensure you're ready for that lack of accessibility. We know it's part of the game, that its a steep learning curve, that's never going to change. Right now, our tutorial, anything you do straight away in Lumbridge, etc does not prepare you for this, or explain why that's good.
---
This is OSRS, intentionally and unapologetically a tough steep learning curve MMO, otherwise it wouldn't be authentic to its time period - a new player doesn't necessarily know that, or expect it, and it's helping to them to get to grips with that.
---
What are the actual odds in getting that?

I personally hate degradeable equipment, I shouldnt have to pay to use gear ive already paid for
---
What was the kc?

Scam, i got the exact same email
---
I prefer diet
---
99 mining isn't everyone's goal so you are building a bit of a straw man. Making early game more enjoyable will help retention long enough to allow players to get into the game. I understand most people in osrs these days are less in it for the fun but hopefully the newer players care about fun.

The ironsights on it were nice too

lmfaooo who are u pm me ur rsn
---
Will 200M XP server messages ever be run again like in RS2? Feel like it would  be nostalgic at least and an incentive to start such a massive grind in the first place
---
This is true, but the pures risking Upgraded Gmaul would have the advantage. It would also require you to risk at least 10m when skulled to use Claws to Gmaul, which IMO is the strongest spec combo
---
also him showing there is a safe zone at barb assault, where there really is not any.
---
a fix for the Entrana lure would be to give a big warning screen that you are actually entering wilderness with that click.
---
Its a very good series

Something's phishy

How do they make the email exactly the same as jagex email? I changed my password after I got this just to be safe. And I checked the email I got from jagex and it‚Äôs the same address

17k KC in inventory and 20k KC in total.
---
Total worth?
---
Made a separate comment
---
Total worth and how many hours estimated if you have a idea
---
Probably 5k tockens to get a dragon defender.

easy fire cape at 75 range? damn, maybe i'll give it a go

Wilderness only rune pouch and pvp loot keys pls

Good idea.

Do people not talk anymore in lobbies on COD

haven‚Äôt got mic for xb1 yet so idk how things are
---
As someone who has been part of rs since the start, who spent over 10 years in the pvp clan scene i can say this, the pkers of today are way more toxic then anything the game has seen.  No such thing as honor, the fact that people will initiate a fight and then the moment they fail a spec or run out of food they tele throws everything out of the picture.  So going off of that, i would prefer this no honor pvp scene die then tarnish any memory i have of a honorable wild.  
---
On a final note, I will honestly say that i dont give 2 shits about pures, they can do their thing but do not ask for content to be catered to their limitations.
---
75 RC and 78 mining. Everything else is way above 80. I'm thinking about training RC when I get to that 77 point, and then let it surpass mining so that I don't have to train mining just to keep it ahead of RC.
---
77+ RC is just way more afk and more hands off than gem mining, and motherlode mine is kinda slow.
---
Perfect man, I‚Äôll check out birdhouse runs I been hearing all about them so I‚Äôll start that!
---
And I been wanting to do farming but I find it confusing tbh but I‚Äôll watch some more guides then!
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll try out those methods!
---
I feel that tweaking the way quests and achievement diaries interact with each other and the world of runescape would help new players tremendously. 
---
For instance, Jagex could guide new players with NPCs and possible flashing icons like tut island through the beginner lumbridge diaries/quests for at least a little bit of a  "story mode" feel of progression. That's something that I always felt lacked in the questing/diaries when I did them. All I did was look up the most efficient way to get the quest Cape and did the grind. Same for diaries. 
---
I love how open and free osrs is in terms of what you want/can do with your account, but the questing/diaries and overall "main story progression" need a guiding hand from Jagex to get people started. If I were to ask 100 new players what are the first 5 quests they should do I'm sure they'd have no idea(I want to point out that there are a multitude of quests you could do). I want to see Jagex try to create a cohesive obviously progressing storyline so that new players have a little bit of structure to guide them on what they should or could be doing in the game. Just my suggestion! Let me know what yall think.
---
I would love to get the fighter hat, add me too. RSN: Spate I‚Äôll flick my private üòâ
---
Funnily enough, neither of those are hard, you learn how to speak merely because people, for example, your family, talk around you.
---
But of course, brainlets like yourself couldn't figure out how to kill chickens by looking at other people killing chickens, they have to be told that it's possible.
---
Nah you wrong ty tho
---
Irrelevant in every way.
---
This is about adding more flavour to the conversations. Not to replace the wiki.
---
So if that is your only complain you have, i dont care.
---
In the recent Blog about "The state of PVP" there's some changes going to be made to the maul, so people are panic-buying them to flip/ keep in that event.
---
According to [OSBuddy exchange](https://rsbuddy.com/exchange?id=4153&amp;) you can see the spike and the result of this potential change.
---
360¬∞ blowpipe
---
Roflmfao this actually made me laugh what a little shit head
---
Yeah, there's no way to figure out whether runescape has a wiki or a guide of some sorts, imagine if we had some website that could help us find stuff online, how great the world would be...
---
Hit the nail right on the head

Fake and homosexual

Why is no one mentioning the PPSH-41? AKA the "Fish". That thing fired like a drumroll.
---
Shipment...
---
You're not serious right? This game was meant to run on a pentium 2 processor and dial up internet. The hardware difference isn't an issue, it feels like the rng is.
---
dont do bloods theyre for noobs
---
Yeah they never leave the game really... the game just needs to accept the gmaul. Its meta and anyone whos been using this way since early 2000s os big brained.
---
So you were fluent in English your first week here then? BTW my background is in neurolinguistics. I know how babies learn to talk.
---
It's a mace guys but this hype might make it a flail
---
Let's hear them.
---
I will give you a very simple reason why PvP is dying.
---
People get older, interests change, people who PK continually year end are far and few between.
---
Why new people are not getting into PvP can be discussed.
---
1. Brainlets have no place in this game.
---
2. All things end eventually, I don't see how is that a problem.
---
Thankyou! shall give those a try. Its a bit weird navigating the wesbite to see whats associated with RS3 and OSRS.
---
Imagine a world in which people want to play a game without using any guides?
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense at all
---
I actually really like this. I'd definitely buy a sticker of this.
---
If they aren't getting past Lumbridge, then they are more retarded than a common 9 year old, because I was in Varrock on day one, with me and my 9 year old friends.
---
Your retardation is not my issue.  
---
As for "anti bot measure"... How about they spend their time actually working on anti bot measures and not shitty "fixes" that just make botting even easier than before?
---
Agreed most of the account management services are located under the rs3 version of the website
---
I quite enjoy abyss crafting tbf, I'm just not sure if 1.5k per hour is the 'normal' amount to be obtaining.
---
They also make spam bots to like shit on other hosts 
---
I've seen stuff like " x host uses hosting bots, x host does this thing" it's just no fun to find a house anymore. 
---
I've seen bots spamming a name shitting on him but all I seen was the name so I tried to join and the dude they're sitting on wasn't even hosting at the time. It's just really bad all around now.

Any Devine Forces on here??

A few questions concerning the treasure chest in the POH:
---
* Is it possible to change treasure chest, so players can store separate parts of any sets, maybe with the design of the achievement log? Currently you are able to store separate parts of the trimmed monk's robe, the sandwich lady set, gold-trimmed leather and 3rd age Druidic (and 3rd age plateskirt?) but unable to store separate parts of other types of sets.
---
* In tune with above question: Can players have the opportunity to store both sets in the treasure chest? Currently you can only store either armour sets and elegant sets for one gender (with legs or skirt/with shirt or blouse).
---
* Can there be added some consistency about which combined items that can be added to the treasure chest? Currently you can store combined items such as Beret mask, Cavalier mask, Top hat &amp; monocle and Partyhat &amp; specs, but cannot store items such as Hat eyepatch, Pirate hat &amp; patch, Double eye patch (and any with ornament kits attached.)
---
* Can the following items be added to the treasure chest? Currently these are (AFAIK) the only rewards you cannot store in the treasure chest:
---
   * Team cape zero, -i and -x
---
You see it if you aren't blind
---
Also dead content and powercreep.
---
I will burn with you!
---
Plz tell me you can switch dolphin flip....
---
For most people it is, for the EHP meta it is not.
---
Will we ever see an expansion to CoX? At the moment the whole idea of randomised raids is great fun and it has its pros for sure but it would be awesome to see some sort of additional bosses added?
---
Maybe this would make the raid scouting a little too frustrating though due to so many rooms.
---
Also, tob challenge mode when? ü¶Ä
---
Can we get a wilderness only rune pouch? It would help bring normal spellbook down to a more reasonable level in terms of inventory space vs ancients and lunars
---
Also, repoll loot keys instead of pvp world lootingbags?
---
I'm honestly even sure if 1/m an hour is good in osrs? I've only recently started playing. Are there any mobs I could camp to make more than that? I'm only at 60 slayer atm.
---
Nice trace
---
The sheild of arrav cc is still the best place to find a partner
---
Yeah there's no way to figure out how to play this game, it's literally impossible to click random buttons on screen, for example, the minimap icon, to see the world map, or looking at skills, or talking to NPC's, yeah, it's all locked behind 500 page guide and unless you read all of it, your controls are disabled and you will be retarded and unhappy forever, brainlet.
---
Inventory management is a must
---
Black Ops 1 had a good Spas 12 and MW3's Striker was broken IIRC
---
I love the authenticity with the Xeric‚Äôs Aid on the ground in front of Olm signifying that your runner died.
---
They're kind of wanting to add more NPCs to click though? And this is now a problem for you?
---
Come up with more strawmans, alright?
---
Me and my 9 year old friends over a decade ago managed to learn how to play this game without any guides simply by exploring, but nowadays brainlets need to be told what to do.
---
Here's a brilliant idea, kill yourself, since you need to be told what to do with your miserable life and cannot possibly figure out what to do otherwise no matter how hard you try.
---
I think its because gmaulers allow an easy, low level, low risk intro to PKing. Its the only way I know of to get started without risking tons.
---
Why do you say it's dwindling?
---
My pure doesn't use g maul and neither do a lot of the pures in my clan. I use MSB into AGS spec or d scim into AGS or dark bow spec
---
I can tell you're a very happy individual.
---
Wait, the new smithing pet is just a guy in a runecrafting cape and a silly hat? ...Hm, not too thrilled about the quality there.

"content you will never play" still affects other parts of the game and the economy.
---
Given the new players boosts/stuff or faster moving around changes the dynamics of the game.
---
If they suddenly make something that instantly boosts a skill to lvl 30, then it affects everyone even the people above that lvl. It's a balancing issue
---
idkw but i can't get to connect to their website

didnt they put it there when you couldn't pvp in the wildy, then kinda just left it there when they brought pvp back
---
this guy knows his neuro
---
man, I wonder how many hours you would have shaved with good gear lol. That's brutal.
---
I literally started playing this game with a 3rd grade education and I did just fine.. If people are quitting because the game is too hard then they would be catering to knuckledragging mouth-breathers that I wouldn't want spamming up the g.e anyways.
---
Fletching and the ability to use yew long and shortbow. Rune arrows. Would be more useful than that of agility. It will be seen as RC is to F2P you would instead add energy potion to the varrock potion shop. Or even a place to rest. Agility is not fit for f2p. You also need lvl 50 mage for entangle and 85 teleblock to make f2p set.
---
Just get them all to level 99!
---
It's a joke mate, how would I know? I dont follow him around
---
Lmao could it be any worse. Key breaks. Find nothing. Story of my life bro
---
This is the new player experience we all need
---
I kind of agree, but setting penalties that actually match the content being done by the players (so like 500k-1m for Zulrah/Vorkath for example) would just punish noobs and lower level players disproportionately. Although it feels bad to get "punished" for using better gear, you are less likely to die both due to your gear and due to likely being more experienced in general.
---
you'll tank the healers no problem. I had the same issue and life got easier once i got 70 defence

I can't wait

considering he said he used d hide and a regular dragon cbow with broad bolts, the kills werent that fast lmao.
---
If you are afking lobsters, monkfish or sharks for fishing then it's completely your own fault that it is slow.
---
Still no real argument other than you're mentally ill and need to be told how to play the game where you literally can do whatever you want without being told what to do.
---
They've said multiple times in multiple QnAs that they are working on it

It's going to be a build-a-boss with different fossils causing different mechanics

It's just very visually and graphically demanding so it's taking awhile.

It's just banter dude, calm down.

Why would I do some research on a fucking quest? As a pure, I could not give a shit about quests. I've already done all that I'll ever need to, and let me tell you, i'm not breaking 70 quest points by choice. Pures dislike quests. Fucking period. I GUARANTEE you that pures were not bitching and whining about a fucking quest. Not like how your lot bitched and whined about updates to the standard spell-book a few months ago, something that was directed at pvpers.  I'm done talking to you lmao. Go do your shitty quests, kill your mindless npc's. I don't play for that garbage, I play for the competition and action of PVP, that's it. So you and yours, get off our johnsons, and let us play our fucking game without trying to ruin shit that doesn't even effect you.
---
Lol imagine being on normals to kill scorpia

---
OSRS player and 5E Dungeon Master here. 
---
I'd steer clear of any weapons/armor because the progression of assorted metals for armor in Runescape has no D&amp;D5 analogue. So mostly we're looking at magic items. Most I'd consider doing is using Adamantine armor/weapons which have a neat 5e effect... but Adamant is pretty trash in RS so it won't spark a strong feeling. 
---
I'd suggest maybe an Explorer's Ring that lets you Dash (run energy restore in RS) as a Bonus Action 3x per Long Rest. That's pretty strong in D&amp;D5 though, I'd use it as a Rare item or higher. 
---
Another item would be Ava's Attractor/Accumulator/Assembler. Have them meet a mad wizard name Ava who gives any arrow-users a magic quiver that refills itself with arrows. It's a pretty core piece of ranging equipment in RS, and might be useful in D&amp;D if you track ammo in your game. 
---
If you look at the OSRS quests "Lunar Diplomacy" and "Dream Mentor", you make a potion that teleports you into someone's dream, where you fight their mental 'monsters' to help them out. Could be a fun little D&amp;D sidequest.

I've got the gloves and no fire cape. Is it doable at 75 range 62 prayer 58 defence? Got a blowpipe already.
---
Add firestorm so we can just snipe from across the map
---
Or, and hear me out here, you can get your magic to level 65 which unlocks this handy little spell called 'Geomancy' which tells you the same things that RuneLite tells you.

Yes, I know how bad this sounds. Actually having to play the game instead of trawling the game client for data. I'm actually with you on this, i'd rather develop my own private game client instead of using the default game mechanics.

If you think that's milking views for money, you're out of your mind.

I don't think that'd be possible for him. Right now he's doing a hard Temple Trekking grind - endless laps as quickly as he can to get the Slayer levels he needs for a Whip. 
---
There's really no meaningful midpoint to that, and it's not AFK at all. Not like he could do something else on his main and let the Treks happen in the background, he's sort of locked into Trekking. 
---
What else could happen? "Hey guys here I am at 82/85 slayer... uh, carrying on? Peace!"

It‚Äôs definitely worth it. The offensive stats match bandos and it only takes about 3-4 hours to get

thanks for the detailed response! i definitely want to boss at some point but i'm happy right now taking things slowly. i'm mostly focused on farm runs and questing but magics are expensive and need something to make some money. i'll take your advice though and go do lunar isle so i can use zmi.

I‚Äôd love for OSRS to get something like runemetrics to make things like this possible.
---
It‚Äôd probably be possible to do a collab with runelite for something like that, but I could see the effort going to waste if we later get an OSRS runemetrics.
---
Though OSRS runemetrics seems to be a really unpopular idea because I posted that on the Q&amp;A thread and it‚Äôs one of the most downvoted suggestions.
---
sure, which I also would probably not do unless paid
---
np m8!
---
hah, thanks
---
Great idea. How about also an option to display the ping next to the worlds?
---
The polling system aptly symbolizes the phrase "forgiven, but not forgotten."
---
They ruined it all once, and if you only play OSRS then it is easy to forget that this game is run by the same company that keeps making RS3 worse and worse every year. There is a trail of corpses of other games that Jagex has ruined entirely by their own decisions as well, rest in peace Ace of Spades.
---
The polling system is, as far as I can tell, the only thing that has kept this one (1) game in Jagex's portfolio as the only one that isn't complete and utter dogshit.
---
All I can say is that, for the sake of the future of this community, it is a good thing that source code for RS clients and servers are easy to come by. If they fuck it up again, I can never trust Runescape in the hands of Jagex again.
---
What do you mean "for most people" lol. Do you think "most people" can't get more xp at lavas than they can at ardy? I'd assume those are the 2 methods that "most people" would compare.
---
I was exactly the same. I couldn't remember the name of Harvest Day but I'll never forget that map, it was so fun to play but it was also where I had one of my most disappointing gaming moments.
---
I got the greatest snipe of my life all the way across the first stage, a headshot on a sprinting enemy, unbelievably lucky long shot. Then the kill feed flashed up... One hit kill, -10 or whatever points for killing a teammate, he was so far away he didn't show up as friendly. I was mortified.

People always talk about how weird the current reality is, I think one of the weirdest parts is that that the runescape subreddit of all places is one of the least brainwashed, is that maybe because we all grew up addicted to the internet so we have more information than most so we believe brainwashing mainstream media less? are we more skeptical? Don‚Äôt believe things until we see numbers behind it?

Either way, I‚Äôm glad

---
Do you even know what I mean by accessibility? I'm not talking about QoL shit like the graveyard runs in vanilla. I'm literally talking about the concept of levelling up and exploring the open world instead of just camping in SW/Org all the time which is exactly one of the things that open letter was complaining about.
---
It takes less than 50 hours to get from level 1 - 120 and that's not even if you play efficiently. Not even RS3 is that fast. 50 hours isn't enough to explore every area of the world and progress through every dungeon and raid and feel like you're actually accomplishing something.
---
You can say that RNG and lootboxes also kill the game and make it inconvenient for you to get the best gear as fast as possible. But don't try to say that what I'm saying isn't a huge factor to why WoW is now a shit game.
---
yet the truth in it stands.
---
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if the player base in 10 was 30 percent less than 07 n 08
---
Listen, I'm going to get shit on for this and I'm okay with that. If this comment wasn't so far down a chain I'd get downvoted to oblivion. MW2 was the start of the decline for COD. The game itself, was great, but the killstreak changes in my opinion ruined the core of that game. Now everyone is just killstreak hungry and camping all over the place tryna get the good shit. Back in 4 and WaW, camping wasn't nearly as prevalent as MW2 and beyond. Before you only needed 7 kills for a kill streak, now I need 11 or more? Yeah I'mma get like 5 and camp so I can get an ac130 and then the entire team hides in buildings until it's gone. That shit isn't fun. I was cool with the Attack Helli. The dogs were shitty but at least if you were good you could kill em before they killed you. But a fucking ac130 or chopper gunner? Not fun for anyone other than the dude who has it.

I love it so much. It makes me feel like a kid again. I mainly play for nostalgia but just never really had the opportunity when I was younger to explore members worlds. I feel like it would take too long to learn now and that I'm too far behind to do members stuff.

There should be no argument, it's objectively better since you get the same str bonus but more attack bonuses.

Yeah that was my huge issue with it. Yeah you got that one dude, but not his buddy who just got around the corner while your in the middle of pulling a clip out.

funny thing is, we are already past powercreep.  People on here say they cant stand DG because it would offer chaotics, yet tbow and blow pipe are already stronger then what chaotics were.

I thought I was the only one who liked the ak74. That thing with a silencer on it looked like a fucking popcan just felt fun to kill people with it

I support this, but only if it's disabled in PvP worlds as it lowers the skill ceiling.
---
Also make sure to poll it 3 times.

How much easier is doing Jad with 45 defence compared to 1? I‚Äôve been practicing and I‚Äôm gonna make a serious attempt here soon on my 1 defence account and I‚Äôm curious if I should just get defence beforehand. I‚Äôve got 75 range and 45 prayer atm.
---
why would you have a hard leather body at your level, and do you not look at your character when equipping items?
---
More opportunity for content I guess. The streamers are gonna be invested because it's a way to make quick progress, stream, and make videos. And there's a lot of room for variables. As opposed to Castle Wars which has very little prep or lead up.
---
That being said, I'd love to see it in an eSports format. Even if it was just a bonus thing.
---
Places that don't restrict and threaten people that speak freely tend to have a pretty centered base. This is why places can only become, and stay, left wing by punishing dissent and censoring free discussion. The center and right are either present and silent, or speaking freely elsewhere.
---
It also helps to have a good sense of community humor. There's nothing more like an aintibiotic to the left than a tight community with a good sense of humor, since the core ideology of the modern left is based around hating real humor, and instead synthesize it by playing laugh tracks when their political ideology and rhetoric is yet again repeated.

I mean, the first time this was posted to reddit, by me, was 154 days ago as seen on my profile. People were then, and still are desperately trying to profit off of the sceptres, but I‚Äôm not one of them. When I first posted it, I think they were about 8-10m, so that means all the hoarders have lost(since then) at least 6m per sceptre.
---
I see why they‚Äôre shamelessly shilling it, butI‚Äôd like them to at least spend SOME time and effort of their own on their posts, instead for shamelessly stealing others‚Äô content.

Make it an NPC like Romeo who always starts the conversation with you when you are near them. Once you hit a certain total level the NPC would stop starting the conversation with you, similar to how Romeo stops auto starting conversations with you once you complete Romeo and Juliet.
---
all you would have to do to ignite interest in castle wars is add some gamble system like with BA and some noob alternative to BiS main gear like the torso since the only reason to play it now is for niche pure bis items

Haha I took a spiny helm to dusties instead of my slayer helm once. Figured that out pretty quick.

Actually theres still public talking lobbies, but you gotta play mercenary modes now to avoid party chatters. Lots of squeakers still play, but I mostly see adults now probably due to the franchise's age.

I saw this coming as many have in the past. Once you give Jagex an inch and allow changes to be made to the game without polling they will continue to do it. And people will feel polls don‚Äôt matter since Jagex will just do what they want. Back when they nerfed void and changed serp helm without polling it, I was dumbfounded how little resistance there was. Yes it may have been warranted, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can have their way whenever they feel like.

Hi is team my question is in regard to what you are doing about the incessant amount of Venezuela gold farmers iN activity's like impling looting black chin hunting green dragon or Venezuela ok teams and farms in the Rev caves and so forth. It is nearly impossible to catch a dragon impling now a days for the lovely Glory's or to kill green drags in the wildy. I understand there economy is in shambles but I don't see how osrs is allowing these accounts to fill the market with an extrodinary amount of gold per hour.
---
&gt;This is not the case at CoX because even if half the team don't know what they're doing that doesn't stop you from getting to olm and getting kills. 
---
Surely this is a good thing, why would we want the hardest PVM content in the game to be achievable with half the group afk
---
Have you finished all the FTP quests and maxed all the FTP skills?
---
- Yes  
---
- It's efficient to slay with melee (while using cannon of course) rather than ranged because training melee outside of slayer is much slower than training ranged outside of slayer so the melee xp is effectively more valuable timewise.  
---
- Also note you should be barraging past 94 magic and use defensive casting

It has nothing to do with consistancy; a good PKer in this day and age knows how to not put themselves in a position to poteintally die. Gmaul spec is the only thing that has the poteintal burst damage to stack people out, which is 99% of the time the only way mains die at the highest level of PvP.

Question about rewards from Wilderness pvp. I recently finished training to 60 agility in the Wilderness course, during which I was pk'd a few times during the process. I wasn't carrying anything of value, maybe a summer pie or 2 most of the time. Were these people just pking for the sake of it? Do you get something from killing a player regardless of what they were holding? I don't mind getting ganked, part of doing anything in Wildy, just wondering what they were expecting to get. It seems like a waste of time on their part.
---

Yes! I'd love the option to filter by region and then sort by population (to find quieter worlds but without shit ping)
---
Please let this meme die.

 I‚Äôll have 70 def in a few hours and then I‚Äôll go for ahrims too! Maybe even switch cuz my first kill was no switch lmao I need to get the damage up in blue phase u right , what darts do u guys use in blow pipe to make the best profit vs cost
---
I literally thought this was a screenshot and then he drew over olm at first
---
&gt; the number one reason
---
There's a whole bunch of reasons people don't bother pking, including but not limited to; it being expensive, you're not making your money back cause supplies cost more than the G maul you get as loot, can't be bothered making/ don't have to time to make a pvp focused account with restricted stats, pkers being toxic (mainly being called a safer and having people insult you when starting out), getting stomped the first 100 fights starting out cause everyone else got a 15 year head start, rushers, raggers, scammers, people hoping for a good rng spec then tabbing over and over again, feeling compelled to spend their time working on their main/ironman instead of non-progressing pvp on an alt.
---
G-maul change solves some problems and others not as much. Cheap people are just going to find the next best set up and use that while others are just going to risk more cause they don't want to give up the best combo weapon in the game. Imo it's a pretty positive change with no real drawbacks, unless you feel like there's too little ko potential in pvp, and I don't think there's a lot of those people around.
---
Maybe it's going to be a slight negative for people wanting to learn how to pvp cause the new budget meta is probably going to involve two spec weapons instead of just one, meaning that it's going to be harder to pull it off compared to just double tapping the spec bar.
---
Aww the nerd only has fun on the game if his agility level is 79 instead of 78. Poor boy. Better hate on everyone who made this happen to you.

You can use either chinchompas or a rune crossbow and you wont have to switch the bp to long range.  The chinchompas and rcb both can hit the healers and rapid range without making you walk under Jad.  Only a matter of time before u get it since you arent having trouble getting to the final wave

I was 11, about 15 years ago. Dumbest thing I did was ask my rs gf for full rune to go kill elvarg. Put on rune kite instead of anti-dragon shield and died. Couldn't get back in time to get the rune shit back. So I removed her from my friends list and deleted her off MSN messenger too. Still feel bad to this day, I'd give her a couple Mil if I saw her. Rynca, if you're out there, I'm sorry.

One question: Is it possible to provide bankers with a chat option that used to exist(And still does on RS3) with the text regarding how all banks across Runescape used to be called "Bank of Varrok"(a call back to Runescape Classic)? It was essentially the player asking the banker "Didn't this use to be called the bank of Varrock?" The banker would reply "Yes, but people kept saying our sign was wrong, so we changed it" This use to be a chat option, it still exists in RS3, but for some reason it doesn't exist in OSRS. It is a nice throwback, and I think it would be a lovely if it could be re-implemented. Thanks!

they need to add a bunch of things prior, mostly around clan vs friend chats, how pid works over login/logout, rework of other partner stuff like partner slayer.

personally there's not much an iron cannot do with friends. most of the good somewhat engaging group content (raids, revs, minigames) irons work just fine in. sure, you cant do team gwd but team gwd is a struggle to stay awake during in the first place.

Here's the thing...

If you can make it to P3, you're at least part of the problem as to why you're not getting KC. I don't say this in a mean way, but it's true. Especially as a learner, you should only be taking the bare essentials for swaps (2 way mage, 4 way range, dwh/bgs, chally OR claws, 2 SCP's, rune pouch). This leaves you 17 spaces for potions - That's 1 stamina, 5 restores, 11 brews. To put this into perspective, you should only really need 2-3 restores, 1 stamina, and 2-3 brews. The other 2-3 restores / 8-9 brews are all room for error.
---
Now, I know what you're going to say... "It's not just my error, it's the teams error too! They're killing me.". Most "mistake" damage can be avoided, regardless of what your teammates are doing. Getting hit with the blue ball P2? Watch it bounce around and move yourself accordingly so if you're the last person that would get hit it hits Verzik instead. Someone taking one of your e-turn spots? You can do the e-turn without going up and down, just vary yourself between 2 squares and 3 squares away from verzik instead of actually turning or learn how to step back on the correct tick rather than e-turn. People not freezing crabs? Learn how to pop them (get close then run away instantly). Noob tank letting melee's through on P3? Learn the tick to step back on so that even if Verzik does melee, it won't hit you (It's literally 1 tick, so you can still do this while maintaining most of your DPS). Doing these 4 things alone means you'll be taking minimal damage (&lt; 10 damage from Verzik's blue ball when she targets you with it or it bounces off you, some damage from auto-attacks P3, but really that's it) and you'll basically be able to solo P3 with your massive stockpile of supplies.
---
I don't say all of this to be mean btw. I thought the same thing at your KC. Was sure I had a decent handle on the fight and was good enough with the mechanics that if there were just 3 other people like me on the team we'd always be getting KC. Struggled my way through it (Learning how to avoid melee's helped a ton) and was the last one alive who carried through tornados more than once. Now I'm over 900 kc on my main. Recently made an alt to do ToB on while working on maxing my main... Did a few low KC ffa's to see if it was as bad as I remember, and it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, people were still really nooby and died early into P3 (even had one wipe at P2 where all 3 of my teammates died and I don't think there was anything I could have done without purple sweets), but if we got to P3 then we got the KC, even the time I had to solo from 40%.
---
So my advice to you is this: Rather than letting it "breed frustration and toxicity", take it for what it is... A learning experience. Teams won't always be perfect. Hell, even running high KC ffa's it's not super uncommon for someone to die at Verzik. Running with teams that make a lot of mistakes is an opportunity for you to learn how to compensate for those mistakes - either by helping the team and picking up slack (freezing more crabs, freeing people from webs, etc.) or just helping yourself and avoiding damage from your teammates mistakes and preserving supplies.

You make a good point about being AFK, so make the auto-accept timer be after the sign out timer. If you're still moving after that you shouldn't have to be worried about being sent back while away. On the point of missing all sorts of notifications while skilling, it'd be simple to add the message to a place every player looks. Like near the map.

If you don‚Äôt want to play on an Ironman for now just make a new account. You may want to try it again in the future and regret getting rid of it.

You should consider the idea that there might be other reasons why people might not want to date you, even if it seems like you already know the reasons and you think you've got a pretty good picture of the situation. There are plenty of racists out there (it hits hard to see it happen in the nerd community!), and plenty of people who can't see past weight - but it's not all of them. Either you haven't met those other people, or you have and they've been driven away by something different than your appearance.

You do get a lot less points and slightly less xp/hr but it's much more afk. You should gain more points than you spend on absorbs/overloads (atleast at higher levels you do).

Jagex has minigame world's just so that people can group with others doing a similar activity and have the feel of an mmo. Some require it, some don't. Most people would rather not be the only person doing a minigame. There are multiple world's so that everyone can have low ping and not deal with a full world.
---
You might like the idea of it, but it's boring as fuck. You'll probably spend 5 minutes, realize there's literally no reason to work the machine and then quit. It's not fun content. People would already go to the intended world and there would be nobody running the furnace. You would have to pay bots on a private world because everyone just wants to leech and not run it. That's the reality of it. They changed it because you're literally the only soul in existence that claims they WANT to run the blast furnace. People would literally sit at the ramp and complain for 30 sec+ while they wait for someone ELSE to fix it. Nobody wanted to do it.
