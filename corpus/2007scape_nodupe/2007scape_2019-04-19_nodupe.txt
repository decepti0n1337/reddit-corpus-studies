Warding is just trying *way* too hard to be a massively overhauling game changing skill. Things like hunter and farming that were added could almost be entirely grouped as a giant mini games with the level up unlocks being rewards.
---

---
I feel like just because Jagex thinks it’s time to add a new skill, said new skill needs to be the mother of all skills, overflowing with content. In my and a lot of others opinions, the “overflowing with content” route just opens up a ton of ways to throw off the balance/meta of things and completey ruin some things into dead content. Trying to make BIS magic armor/weapons through a craft-able like skill completely shits on end game content rewards like raids.
---
Let’s be honest if RuneScape was a cheese burger, combat (pvm/pvp/slayer) would be the patty, skilling would be the cheese, quests would be the lettuce and tomato, mini games the condiments etc... With combat being the most majorly widespread enjoyed activity the players take part in, the endgame gear is gonna come from the highest risk vs reward combat bosses. Just because it’s time for a new skill doesn’t mean it needs to completely revolutionize everything.

RS3 has incense burning but it no longer requires standing close to a fire source. Can RS3 get all the good OSRS ideas that that have been voted against?

I use RuneLite and somehow managed to remove the ability to see "wield" or "use" or "eat" whenever I hover over inventory items.

Does anyone know how to fix this?

Thanks! I looked at the wiki, idk how I missed that.

Beginner clue I think

Haven’t had those in years, but I distinctly remember having some “Twist and Shout” cookies before basketball practice as a kid and felt so nasty the entire practice haha
---
Isn't the Scythe of Vitur the same as the RS3 Noxious scythe and a legacy friendly version of the Cleave ability?
---
You aren't speaking rationally. Either rapier, avernic, AND bandos are game changing upgrades, or none are (avernic is better than full bandos alone). Scythe, bp, and tbow increased dps by LITERALLY over 20x what gwd did. You need to think less subjectively about what you're saying.

Dicing was the best part of of RuneScape imo. 12 year old me couldn’t commit to maxing account but would sit there and try to snipe dice.

~40,000-42,000 votes cast. That doesn't account for duplicates etc. but thats a sizeable population considering there used to only be ~100-200k uniques per week. The size of players has definitely increased greatly since mobile. There are countries with less turnout than that.

Yeah still gonna be a no. This just sounds like a very tedious boring expensive slow skill. I know there are already skills like this but we have to have them as they already exist ha. At least we can say no to this one

You add more they become less appealing

Oh boy, "How do we make the most useless skillcape *even more* useless?" Grapple stashes. Fletching Cape needs a rework. Grapple stashes are a great idea. Make this happen.

Does the Wilderness Bandit General Store decrease the price it buys things at like normal stores? I know it buys at high alch so even if it does it'd still be profitible to oversell but I'd like to know exactly what to expect before going into the Wilderness.

If players don't like it as its own skill, I expect this is what they will do. I don't think it is bad for them to offer it as a skill if players want it; doing it as its own skill does allow for it to be more involved than if it were part of existing skills. The example I often use is how Construction could have been an expansion to Crafting, Fletching, Smithing, and such but then it wouldn't be able to do as much as it could as its own skill (e.g. how would you unlock new rooms types, house sizes, servants, etc).
---
But either way, I expect that the post-Prif update slot will be a Magic update, whether it comes as Warding or smaller expansions to various skills. Or perhaps Warding fails and they offer something else entirely.
---
Everyones entitled to their opinions, I’ll just be voting no unless they remove the battle wards section.

Well I'm 24 and also enjoy Steven Universe!

I dont disagree with you, but from a company's standpoint it doesnt make sense to have so many devs working on something that will ultimately get thrown away, if that's what the community decides

Farming is already time consuming enough. I dont like the idea of making another skill dependent on it

Tick perfect being piss easy relative to most of the times you'd use the term "tick perfect"

Why is this such a big deal here? What's the problem with showing names? Just getting spammed?

Never said being tick perfect is hard lol

Yes. I played on members worlds using members items till around 650 total skill points before I went inactive. It was only for around 17 days I didn’t log in, I still have 20 some odd days from the first purchase of membership when I started the account.
---
Y tho?
---
I never realized that before

Thanks.  I did the same but never got an in game notice that I had unlocked it. After getting nuked by wyrms for 30 mins I realized I had already unlocked it lol

RuneScape is better once you let the addiction set in

---
I guess it’s just one of its preprogrammed routes then and you two had the same idea to post it, kinda weird if you think about it
---
This is how bots progress
---
Fair enough, I can tell with the way Jagex have been releasing new content/BIS gear that they deal with power-creep relatively well compared to some games out there, and really do care about balancing new content. 
---
A lot of the new(ish) strong offensive gear usually sacrifices defence/prayer bonuses, or has some sort of comprimise. Even the way they handled the dragon hunter Lance was good, having it's base stats slightly worse than a zammy hasta, keeping it relevant. 
---
Or even the ghrazi rapier, being the BIS melee, but also being hard to get and expensive, keeping whips relevant.
---
I'm sure most of us can see that they really don't want to screw things up in terms of balancing for new content, I trust them for the most part that even if things do seem unbalanced, they're more than willing to listen to the community's feedback on how to change things for the better. 
---
If most of the proposed additions/changes do go through, magic gear like ancestral will still be BIS for the most part since it is rare loot from end-game content, except in certain/niche situations, which I find cool, makes it less about choosing which gear for which situation.
---
I'm all for more magic gear and variety, since I barely use magic as an actual combat skill, mainly just go back and forth between range/melee, and choosing something other than Ahrims since I'm too poor for ancestral would be nice.
---
That being said there's more to warding than new gear, which is a different beast in of itself, I'm on the fence about the battlewards and how they'd be used or if it's just added tediousness *(although I suppose the game won't be any different as it is now if we don't use them, just adding a buff, like how we don't really need to use potions but we mostly do anyway)*.
---
the crafting aspect does seem a bit complicated as it is, but that's usually how it is with most new resources in any game really, it is an entirely new skill after all. I'm sure once people are used to it, it won't be overly complicated.
---
**TL;DL I think we can trust Jagex for the most part in adding something relevant, that won't put balancing/power-creep out of wack, and that we can trust them to listen to community feedback in fixing any issues. A brand new skill is a huge addition and a big deal for them, I know they'll want to get it right.**

*clears throat* ..Nice?
---
It does when it changes how a game is played. If i wanted to play a different type of game then i would. If i want a different combat system ill play something else. Having a new skill that you train up and make robes is fine. That exists in its own space. Making new battle wards that change how combat, slayer, pvm, and pvp is done is bad. Remember eoc?
---
I think they could even change the special ability as another fix. But the damage increase would make them usable for sure

It's the difference between 214 hours to 99 and 200 hours to 99.  That's not a big difference if that's the     absolute most it can be, considering no one in their right mind would do seers even close to that long.
---
Also, when the discussion is a qualitative "is skill slow/fast?" 4k is absolutely not relevant.

Except you just get the antipoison spawn until you can kill zulrah for anti++ since you really don't need anti for that much content and Aventoes are better spent on energy pots anyways.

EOC was an exciting risk, if you want to experience Jagex developer free innovation then just play RS3. At this point I do not trust they’ll do anything right to add to Andrew Gowers game.

I have proof it works and you have no proof that it doesn't. No need to downvote me, just admit you might have been imagining it and carry on with your day.

I mean you're entitled to your opinion but in the grand scheme of things it's very relevant. If you're 14 hours off for every skill that's 292 extra hours to max.

If u mean the program it's RuneLite, if u get it just make sure it's the correct website.

That’s actually a really cool idea!

No no, I just prefer my rsn not be shown on reddit

Alright Thanos, calm down

The rotations can be annoying as hell to learn, but its really not that bad. Everytime it starts with green into blue phase instantly log out and it'll put you back on the dock and gives you one less phase to learn. If it goes green-red itll always be blue next. Unless you need to stand in the corners for a red phase I always like to stand next to the pillars on each side, and learn at what point you need to run to the pillar on the other side depending on what phase in the kill youre at. If you're still struggling you can actually stand behind the pillars in certain spots on blue phase to effectively safespot it and skip that phase, however this will increase kill length and usually put you into a 2 rotation kill. Your focus when its changing phase should be prayer-eat-switch gear, you want to eat between phases in order to maximise DPS. And ultimately there is no real punishment for dying save a few supplies, gear is quick and easy to get back and can be trying another kill in minutes. Watch videos of people going for zulrah kills and watch the rotations and what comes after what, look for patterns in rotations which make it easier in your mind to memorize and you'll be there in no time

Trust me, I dont have the money or skill to get an infernal cape
---
No, it's actually better to collect after longer periods of time. It does max out though but every quarter or so is ideal. Make sure you keep refilling the coffers every week or month, and get favour to 100% every day (I do it like every couple days when I feel like it, it's not a big loss to have it &gt;95% instead of always 100)
---
That blue deformed guy was fucking scary.
---
Sure, but requirements to use a shortcut being 40ish agility or whatever and if you want it to actually save time 99 fletching (it's the fletching cape ability btw) and to make sure you have the right skill cape on. It's a pretty niche scenario.
---
Lol

Damn 4 hours.  That's so long to commit to a boss kill.

IQ of a baked risotto
---
I don’t get it. Am i disabled??
---
Eh. Honestly, I believe the reason Warding is so esoteric and convoluted is that the other, more interesting and unique skills proposed (Sailing and Artisan) didn't pass, so something like this has become an option when the idea is to create a new skill.
---
If they remove Battle Wards and Conjuring most of the naysayers might be satisfied, but if the others didn't pass, neither will this. They're kind of just wasting their time.
---
The main draw of Warding to me is the item sink, something that will only have a net benefit on the game and economy. Every major MMO has item sinks/salvaging of some kind to keep their economy healthy, it's a feature that works and that OSRS could use.

Makes more sense than the original blog post. However I'm still concerned on what it'll do to existing BIS mage armour. I assume the stats posted originally were just an idea of what it could be. 
---
Anyways I'll need to see some ingame footage of the skill before taking my opinion to the poll.
---
How long does 1k barrows take?
---
When you think you're saving the game by posting 20 page essays on your version of warding to Reddit.
---
Just use a blowpipe at money ghosts if you’re trying to make some money. Way more consistent than barrows
---
Yes.
---
The artisan skill was a really stupid idea. Just add contacts to all of the guilds for all of the skills and potentially add bonus xp for the contacts. No need for another skill
---
Mr no sleep did it and it took him 105 hours it’s gonna probs take me 120 because of the shit gear
---
RS3 is better in everything except pking
---
He gave an alternate account wealth to sit in the GE, with zero risk of dying, and flip items. I can't see how this wouldn't classify as muling.
---
It doesn't even start to count as 'dry' until you're at the rate. 
---
Can't just say hurr 10 dry for dwarhammer
---
Honestly I’d rather the grapple just stayed permanently after the first time you used it. Except in maybe a few key ones like the water obelisk.
---
False equivalence
---
It will never go away. Ever.
---
Imagine it didn't
---
Because we always thought it would be sailing.
---
But we already have enchanting. Also, RS has always stood out from other games of its type so I don't see why it would change its name to be more like other games... And seeing as the skill is based around drawing magical wards, Warding seems like a fine name for it.
---
But keyword, stash
---
Still p new and have been getting slayer up, is there a way to kill wyrms without spending a lot of money on prayer/super restores because that really hurts the net profit a lot Am I doing something wrong?
---
There's no reason to believe the skill will be aids. There's no evidence to support that it will kill the game.
---
Dude this is fucking amazing. Thank you for letting us know about this!
---
I have a 5.5” phone, an 8” tablet and a 10” tablet. 
---
5.5” easiest to play on if doing high interaction stuff like bossing/slayer/zulrah. Though it strains the eyes after a couple hours. 
---
8” easiest to do skilling stuff. Medium eye strain after 3 hours but too large to make thumb reach comfortable (I’ve got large hands). 
---
10” great for super afk stuff like mother load mine or fishing. But generally sucks for everything. Too big to comfortably reach without changing hand spots. 
---
Personally I use my phone the most and leave movies to the tablets. They just don’t make a great osrs experience for the things I do.
---
Isn't looting in wildy like 1m per hour? Lol
---
Spoken like someone that hasn't read the warding blog post.  They're bringing in group-based tile buffs+summoning packaged with a gathering/crafting skill
---
Sounds like it absolutely **SKULL FUCKS** the definition of **2007**scape to me.
---
He's making super combats, you usually profit from them.
---
Does it convert to 250gp lol?
---
You forgot homophobic and  misogynist. 
---
 
---
That being said warding is the best new skill they've offered so far
---
I could care less about what they add to the game so long as the graphic *style* stays the same, along with no hot keys or other key binding types of controls.
---
New skills are great, keeps the game fresh, adds a huge chunk of content and above all just gives you something else to do. No more money sinks though
---
Ironmen are a free world btw
---
It would also just be dumb cuz every account would train 99 defence before entering the wildy lol.
---
EOC was a bad update to RS2.
---
Yeah, but I'm also not gonna sit on my deathbed wishing I'd watched more movies and TV shows.
---
I was really really hoping for Shane McMahon
---
aint nobody gonna argue with that
---
Shit really? I gotta do that
---
Should be one option. Every other pair of tabs has zero overlap.
---
I don't understand why it has to be a new skill. Why not just make content based around the skills that already exist that increasingly becomes more efficient as you level up.
---
Summoning was great when it came out. EoC ruined everything about RS3 apparently, so now we won't even get Dungeoneering, we know every detail about quests before they come out, and we have to find niches in niches for items and content instead of going with a natural progression.
---
I'm confused, wouldn't it still shoot?
---
Yeah the issue is I have no bank to afford the teleports lol
---
I blew it all on Construction for an ornate pool as I got a 10m clue drop and wanted to invest it in long term benefits.

---
You do remember when in the original runescape you couldn't run or eat for 3 rounds? Then rs2 came out and you could now eat during fights. We all bitched about that, hell it was one of my reasons for not switching. This community complains about everything.
---
Bahaha and this is why we need closed polls.
---
warding bad trust me i am jagex
---
I took many breaks over the year so I honestly have no clue I would say probably around 40-50 attempts, and 9 zuk fights
---
The problem is that the high level players are a tiny minority.
---
If it goes to player QA and something they said was gonna be 50k xp/hr turns out can be manipulated to become 100k xp/hr it's highly likely that Jagex won't fix it.
---
Also I doubt every single update would be getting a play test. Also would the skill need to pass 75% after the play test or how would they measure what amount of positive feedback is good enough to add it to the live game
---
It's a South Park reference
---
Am I the only one who doesn't know what this is?, what is it actually?.
---
Wym everyone loves farming contracts
---
I opted for bandos instead of ancestral mainly for waves 50+ where there is a mage and range. It’s very tanky for when you can’t pray range, and yes it also beefs up the sgs specs.
---
Just do it

---
Ohhhh my bad. Woosh
---
fix neglected content that already exists within the game before adding shit like this
---
I think if they launched Rs3 as a separate game at the time it would have been fairly successful even with all the negative things people point out, it was the forced change that killed the player base.
---
You got this man, patience is key. Also don’t be selfish with the brews, if you need to eat to make it to the next wave do so. It will all come with time trust.
---
Rshd was amazing, also dungeoneering, although it could be a minigame ,was amazing aswell
---
I think slayer would pass if it were to be polled.
---
Yes and I always end up giving shit away so never again
---
Thanks man. How crucial do you think the ely was?
---
They just need to add a rune scimitar for the easy drop table for f2p ironman.
---
It's okay. It won't be the last time you're disappointed with superiors. @ 98 Slayer and still dry.

Get rid of Lumbridge and instead send players to the Black Hole when they die.

Ehh, the MTA minigame should just have some massive QoL improvements to make it more enjoyable rather than removing the main rewards.

---
Well actually a year ago I downvoted that post and sweat my balls hoping it wouldn't happen. Now it's warding I downvote and sweat my balls hoping it doesn't happen.
---
I honestly dont get people that dont want the game to update and evolve. The problem with RS3 wasnt because they updated the game, the problem was the updates were mostly bad. Updates and changing the game is good, especially when OSRS is a pretty niche game. I fully welcome a new skill to freshen up the game.
---
Imbued rings? Tbh i like the way they are. NMZ is objectively a popular activity whether people like it or not.
---
I don't think the imbues should be removed as that is it's main reward.
---
General Kenobi
---
what has been seen cannot be unseen
---
Actually they didn't release any new skills at all in 2007. Hunter was 2006, and Summoning was next in 2008.
---
I get the concept of item sink, however a skill that does that doesn't really hold itself. 
---
Instead it could be a minigame or some isolated content specifically designed for destroying items but not a skill.
---
That's part of the peanut butter dude, you gotta mix it back in
---
These streams have been up fir years with thousands of view bots bro
---
Yeah, just thought I should help you clarify that message.
---
I think it would be a cool feature for a cosmetic armor slot similar to terraria maybe with a toggle client side for something like pking but I dont feel like it's really necessary at the same time
---
You could also change the +10 to the +1 button and have a +25

Rofl, I came back to the game from 2005, when Slayer had just been added and my immediate thoughts after hearing about ironmen were how insane the grind must be for everyone to get their rune gear. I started with mining and smithing for this exact reason, but gave up at 48 lol

Ask people in the support channel in the discord for Runelite. They are usually very helpful
---
Wrong the calendar never forgets drama
---
&gt;And if Construction were offering today, you'd likely be arguing it should be in existing skills just as much as you are with Warding; or if not you, others certainly would. I mean shaping wood? Building sinks? Crafting chairs? Why would that need a new skill...
---
I disagree. I've always thought con fit its own niche.
---
Hmm i got all 5 pieces in 5 runs the other day... here, take some luck. You could use it.
---
Voting yes to warding will show the players want new skills, voting no does the opposite. Voting no because you want a different skill is not a good vote unless it was "no, but..." Unfortunately, the vote is just "no."
---
Artisan is the only skill pitched so far that I'd vote yes to if repolled, tbh.
---
I'd like to see an eternal ring of wealth and combat bracelet just because why not, just saying the reason they weren't added was probably because of their rare uses.
---
Only vanilla accounts? That's even more dumb and even more of a waste of dev time. You're decreasing the number of players who would play them even more by doing that. 
---
The whole point of the world would be that  would be that you're doing content that was released initially. Limiting it to "vanilla only accounts" makes it pointless. Because so few people would actually want to access those worlds as is.
---
Well... ahem... uh that’s totally what I meant dude, it’s so valuable it isn’t worth the runes! 
---
Phew... close one
---
Objectively good mean's good for everyone regardless of opinion. IE Vaccination's are objectively good. There is no negative attribute to them. Pretending to find negative attributes, or comparing them to something that did have a negative attribute like eoc, doesen't change its own objectively good nature.
---
I like it
---
Inc deleted post
---
I think it may actually value your account.
---
It isn’t all that perplexing, much the same reason I personally dislike Slayer. I’ll provide deeper rationale for you, if you’re open for humble debating.
---
  
---
&gt; That’s tantamount to saying “please don’t have another CPU manufacturer with this much ability to increase performance, the rest will be left in the dust by the CPUs these guys offer”. So I must ask. Why on Earth would rising the bar be bad. Why must we forcefully have another skill that is on par with something like Thieving?
---
Because the skills aren’t in direct competition with each other and never should be. They don’t all have to be equally engaging and complex, but should at the very least offer something that isn’t a complete timegate like what diaries were made to do. Having a skill like firemaking that exists to just be an utter nuisance to force players to sink logs from the game -should- do something at the later levels to justify all the time and money spent - something the devs themselves acknowledged thus Wintertodt and Making Friends with My Arm. 
---
&gt; Most puzzling is, the fact other skills can be revamped to begin with, and made better if need be
---
Absolutely not true. You know this community as well as I do. Even a modest proposal to make Smithing not suck and reduce the level req to smith rune and introduce a new metal at high levels is shot down every. Time. So now Smithing at level 99 creates tier 40 equipment, cost a fortune to reach it and doesn’t even offer a decent money making method, whereas 99 Warding creates tier 70+, ALSO has battle wards, ALSO has imbues just makes Smithing feel even more like an absolute joke that’s never going to be fixed. Let’s be real, OSRS has existed long enough that the devs aren’t blissfully ignorant to the fact Smithing is GARBAGE, but their hands are tied because the community shoots down anything that changes the meta. 
---
&gt; What exactly did you imagine when you realized Hunter basically exists so that rangers can essentially train Range at the speed of magic if need be. Not only that, Jagex created Black Chins that further demonstrates how this skill has zero relevance and interactivity with respect to use case anyone finds valuable outside of a Range training ammo gathering.
---
You’ve forgotten your history lad. Hunter existed as the gathering skill to summoning. It was the Woodcutting to Summoning’s Fletching. Much like how Divination launched years ahead of Invention. The reality is that the 2007scape cutoff happened when Hunter was already in the game and Summoning was less than a year from release. Hunters such an awkward skill because it’s intended production skill is never going to happen. Larupia hides, Graahk furs, polar Kebbit furs have zero use in 2007scape aside from cosmetics because their intended purposes as tertiary ingredients never came to pass.
---
All the sudden all at one time I got the password resets.. log on to no bank pin and Authenticator off?
---
Yeah I'm kinda in the same boat. Sort of on the fence about battlewards. Seems like a weird mechanic.
---
Could be just added tedium for buffs not worth it. 
---
I had a thought that it'd kind of just be like bringing potions but with added steps. 
---
For example we don't really need potions to do slayer, it's easy enough, but for a few inventory spaces we use them anyway for the added buffs.
---
you start the rebuild
---
Maybe for people with no life at all. Sounds depressing.
---
Because I play on mobile while I do work on my computer.
---
Oh no, time to quit!
---
With or without happy ending?
---
Will the fandom wiki ever die? Annoying when doing a quick google search

How is swearing related to ego? Swearing in game is not an offence anymore and hasn’t been for a very long time.
---
Downvoted but he's not wrong? Typical. If this guy has killed 300 rex yet he's broke, what give?
---
How did this get silver when it doesn't even make any sense, as pointed out by the other reply.

Using the word sheep unironically in 2019

Stop buying accounts and this will not happen to you

Relevant username
---
Had me at the star ngl.
---
It’s purely cosmetic lol. People may have never chose to combine them had they thought in the future they would have to reunlock it. Idk it just wouldn’t seem fair for that cape specifically because getting is more difficult than all or most tasks in the game.
---
Should just make them not even required or even just add an additional armor slot for meme shit like this.  I’m at 84 agility and I hate how I can never use half of the shortcuts because you need the grapple or achievements to even use them.
---
And it's still bad. Why can't they get it together
---
You mean warding good? That's the bad side
---
You can’t lock defense.
---
They just let it burn down unpolled, too.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at
---
Botting is the only reason I still play the game. Im just trying to do PvM i dont got time to waste hours of my life grinding
---
just barb fish to 99 thast wut i did and u get close to 80 from 60 agil
---
I intend to research for the team
---
I do a lot of cancerous shit in this game for fun including agility bit Rogues’ den is alch myself material
---
the damage
---
that's right guys vote yes to every skill without bias because if you vote no that means you never want a new skill
---
thank u
---
the only thing that could make this better is if he isn't 93 slayer
---
All I can say is thank you
---
But what about my +1 GE ultimate hardcore varrock only ironman ???
---
Not a good suggestion for ironmen, but fair point for normal accounts.
---
never felt such real frustration
---
I'm a newer player. Just exercising caution. Good to know though.
---
Now I'll be 1500 dry, thanks
---
You're welcome Chief
---
Lava isn't Dragonfire...
---
No worries. At least you knew that it was fake.
---
80 total (but since enchant is capped at 16000, claiming the remaining 6 master wands will require more time)
---
galaxy brain
---
lol tiny penis
---
You farm people farming rev caves...
---
You really don't understand this. Alright, so let's just take this one step at a time. I'm gonna assume salvaging something gives more value than alching. From your own comment:
---
&gt;3 runite bars = 3x 12484 = 37452. And their alch price is 3k, not that you were saying anything about that. Rune platelegs alch for 38400 and sell for 37933 on the GE
---
So if you want to get more out of salvaging rune platelegs, you need to give ingots worth more than ~38200 (alch minus nature rune cost). 
---
Right? So.. 3 rune bars cost 37452..and if you make those into legs and salvage them, you have &gt;38200. Then you use those ingots to make more rune legs, and you repeat. Every time you get a little more than you put in. Eventually, you have enough ingots left over to smith 2 rune platelegs. It's an exponential gain. 
---
Except you can't hard code the value of ingots. It's an economy. So eventually the market is going to be flooded with rune platelegs, and the value is going to drop back to the alch price. And now you have more platelegs in the market than you ever had before. And people are alching them, and more money is coming in.
---
It wouldn't take a Sherlock Holmes to track where the money is going with the tools they have and ban all their accounts with money
---
Plus minus button only ironman
---
Chinning in monkey madness caves
---
I also didn't like the aesthetic overrides.
---
Fucking shit post, there has always been people for and against the concept of warding. This doesn’t change anything at all
---
You should hide your total exp. Now everybody nows that your RSN is Dhanvantari.
---
Isn’t that only for mm2?
---
LSOG, literally just a super chill clan. We don't give a fuck what you guys do at all.
---
I think xp rates are slightly better in mm2 but not completely sure I just watch lots of fastest lvling guides
---
i would suggest buying a month of membership or that first bond and make money on members since u already have a decent total lvl.
---
Support only if runelite is allowed to add to plugin to swap it.
---
Damn it. And here I tried so hard to hide who I am.
---
/s
---
James and the Dragon Peach.
---
&gt; The main question, are these bots or alts though
---
Bots. Go up on the Slayer floor and drop a valuable item like a Rune warhammer. The instant it becomes visible, multiple bots will run straight for it
---
I mean how many years ago did gwd pass a poll? Honestly I think op might be on to something there
---
Idek what this meme is, but it's top tier.
---
So a 50% chance?
---
This particular skill is one that makes absolute sense.. I'm not for it coming with bis gear means smilling needs new tiers and all that and I don't see a need for the ability to Smith unique items.
---
I do think they should add the ability to buff magic gear, gives a benifit to having the skill, and smithing should have the same ability.
---
Perfection
---
That was the dream look back in the day. Except a whip and d sq
---
Who said memes had to make sense?
---
Lmao
---
Dope thanks man, I turned on DT and RFD and got a shit ton of points, about a mill in the hour I trained. Does it make a difference not having it completed at all, like on my pure who only has 7 quests capable of using with nmz and I only have 5 bosses enabled? I don’t have DT nor RFD completed.
---
It’s crazy, I haven’t NMZ since 170 qp, I remember it being such a pain to get shit imbued. I got my b-ring and salve ammy imbued again in an hour.
---
This is such a good idea
---
Please!
---
I started hoarding rune essence and plan to mine to 7 million then not sure the next step.
---
Cominity's. Fml I can spell i swear.
---
They're amazing. And birds nests are still somehow 3k each; it's free money.
---
Technically, but in hindsight, people probably think of eoc's release as RS3 and the actual release of RS3 as RS3.5.
---
no, suffering is bis at inferno
---
&gt; My favorite one in this post is "GWD wouldn't pass a poll", conveniently ignoring that it literally did pass a poll
---
I read it as OP talking about if gwd was new content. You're right it was polled and passed, but it was reintroduction of old content and people knew exactly what it's like and how it shapes the game
---
&gt; Gay pride is not political
---
Most people that attend to Gay Pride aren't doing it for political reasons, but it's been used as a political tool for the left
---
But I personally disagree with the notion that the pride event should've been polled and agreed with your point that it would ruin the purpose of the event itself
---
yikes
---
I always wanted to be a dice host but wasn't rich enough :C
---
for every 7-8 rc xp you get, you'll get 1 mining xp.  But you also want high mining cause it reduces the chance of the dense essence block from coming depleted.
---
If I had like 2.5B I’d probably be able to get an inferno cape too.
---
Gz though shits very hard
---
Your mum gives me her big peaches lmao
---
Yeah depending on your setting before a pin can get cancelled it takes 3-7 days. It can’t be removed immediately lol, so something is up with this story.
---
It’s possible they logged into your account disabled it 3-7 days ago and you just never noticed and then they planned to hijack the account after it was off.
---
But it can’t just magically disappear as far as I know, unless it’s another mod jed situation but it doesn’t seem likely given they took over an external back up email to your primary email
---
Big peaches give big bones
---
I’m 115 cmb and id go for it too LOL
---
You do realise we can work out the RC level based on summing all other skills and taking away from 1700
---
No thank you. I've spent hours learning exactly how many times and how quickly I can click the +1 button to add 5 to my quantity. This change would completely devalue the muscle memory and skill I've built to use the ge efficiently.
---
Yes, but you can’t kill anything with defence. Meant as ironman, not pk or sand casino acc
---
1 tick flicking helps a TON but it is possible to get with lazy flicking. The ability to 1 tick flick helps a lot with mob combos though, such as mage/blob, range/blob, or range/mage
---
Why not just use the collection log ??
---
r/deepfried2007scapememes
---
Thoughts are you got a nice mining level
---
I believe it checks every day at the time that Throne of Miscellania was completed. Or at least that is the day reset for collection
---
*pedanic reason why OP's pedanic logic is flawed*
---
When I was little I thought they were game boys.
---
Ok
---
Ironman time
---
Gotta 2nd suffering.
---
Yeah but we have raid gear in my mind that should be bis. All our actual end game gear should be from raids.
---
Mid tier skills n mobs high end bosses
---
Why 96 agility?
---
Osrs has best community
---
My suggestion is lower than chinning but more viable, cannon dags in the lighthouse while attacking them. You should get 120k+ exp/h.
---
Yeah it was a super disappointing QnA. There was no point in even having that weeks thread up. I don't think they took a single question from it. At least none prior to the warding blog anyway. It was all warding questions lol.
---
At 99
---
That's when energy regen maxes out
---
People like this ruin the game for me tbh. Voting was a mistake. Let the damn devs try ideas before getting pissy.
---
If the arceuss spellbook allowed for true necromancy, I'd be fully on board with battle wards being removed; but I've wanted that type of summoning forever, not as complicated as RS3 but still a basic warlock-esque set of spells.
---
Please be my gf
---
Lmao stop feeding the trolls. Gz my dude
---
Big if true..
---
My only advice is to not do your least liked skill last. It's truly painful.
---
Yes, if you could I would steal a lot of iron from bots
---
Hey dat me
---
I always use the big +1 :(
---
There are only about 500 old school pmods, and their mutes only last an hour. Effectively pointless...
---
No its random now and it'll randomly change every so often. 
---
You used to be able to give yourself better pid (and you'd keep it til you logged out) but you can't anymore.
---
40 range is needed for green d’hide vambs to reach -65 magic attack or you can still kill things
---
You would be able to buy 25 accurately instead
---
I have seen someone like that
---
Y don't u make sense?
---
Why?
---
All the time my dude
---
The player should get a giant alch over itself when equipping a ring of coins
---
Isn’t there a notice when you take off pin???? I never had one....
---
Lots of focus and very little mistakes.
---
In general learning the mechanics will get you the cape much faster than relying on RNG
---
I’d be worried that this would be DOA because of level gaps and with lower level things being completely useless or irrelevant (á la divination) and the wild card tunes devaluing runecrafting or being unbalanced in pvp.
---
Thanks
---
Ok.
---
In your opinion, I thought runescape was complete shit then
---
They just need something else to complain about now that poll results are hidden
---
He literally said niche skill, which magic is not. 
---
And again with the "always been that way" bullshit. That is not, and never will be, a good argument against changes. 
---
Talk about being obtuse though, why the fuck would I want something to do with EoC, regardless of the state of magic in combat?
---
yeah, there's an account recovery option where you can say "i dont have access to the email" and you fill out info like old passwords, payment details etc
---
5 speed is all it needs and/or change the effect from 20% energy drain to a 20% chance to win increase your crush accuracy roll by 25%.
---
Logic makes sense. I vote yes.
---
No i like easy gp beating up noobs
---
Hey if it shuts up fake pures with all combat skills maxed besides def. Im all for it.
---
All depends if your +1 away from another max hit cap lol...
---
ProZD is a treasure
---
I have a hard time buying that someone who grinded black dragons and then fletched full black d'hide would just drop it and leave it.
---
But whatever, apparently I'm a stupid asshole for trying to help. 
---
Fuck this sub, and fuck the OSRS community. This post basically just told me to turn off game chat and to never discuss Runescape because you are all fucking asshole losers.
---
Yeah, I never understood this either.
---
They're in a chest right next to the raids bank.
---
Nah youre not the stupid asshole for trying to help, youre the stupid asshole for insulting people who are right.
---
What? I never called you a stupid asshole, I’m just stating the fact that it’s impossible for it to be from a death, it’s great you wanted to be nice, but I’m genuinely letting you know that’s how the system in the game works, you only ever see other players death drops if it’s in a pvp world or wildy
---
The issue is that they don't want a new skill, they want XP for something that they're already doing. For example if you could skill and quantify merchanting, fashionscape, or player to player interaction it would work. Maybe give people XP for pvping, training in a group, or selling items to other players, holding house parties, or stuff like that. Like a Fame skill
---
A mod was standing right next to him yesterday... bot wasn’t banned... mod didn’t care...
---
Yeah, I dont want it to be killing lvl 3 skillers is all, but I hate bots enough to deal with that
---
What about hunter2 tho
---
Because they don't want it in the game. Simple as.
---
That's literally tournament worlds
---
No you dont and xp rates at NMZ are best in the game, and you pay attention less..you can overload every 5? Mins and you pot for higher than super combat allowing you to get higher xp rates than possible elsewhere in melee. And you get points to buy imbues.
---
Hi there.  
---
Are you logging into the correct version of the game?  
---
You can play both RS3 and OSRS with the same account, but they are separate game saves.  
---
What's the display name?
---
suck my dick you closeted homosexual
---
Still have to fill birdhouses with the seeds though!
---
Savage goon reporting in with the quickness
---
&gt; it just makes it a lot easier
---
yeah I think I could do it too if I had gear that made it a lot easier...
---
Congratz dude! Honestly amazing achievement!
---
Could you look at my set up in ny pist history? I started doing the inferno since monday, so far I've gotten to wave 54.
---
Maybe some tips or gear set up tips?
---
Thanks for the yellow boxes, wouldnt have seen without.
---
this is the gayest shit fuck me
---
The average age of the game is literally 22
---
Oh really? So if someone enter a BH world gets the runes for the BH tele, then teleport l. why should they get a warning when they are deliberately teleporting there?
---
Wait so you are angry that the teleport to bounty spell teleported you to your bounty? Are you rarted or something?
---
I like the feauture, because 1&gt;11 would actually infuriate me.
---
But I don't wanna do it
---
Ah my bad, didn’t realize you were serious. That’s not common sense at all, it’s counterintuitive to the rest of the warnings in the game as I clearly explained. If you don’t see this, I guess you’re just a little dense, sorry pal.
---
The joke...
---
...
---
Your head.
---
i just read the developer blog, i don't really play much osrs anymore although i do lurk on reddit
---
I love the idea of warding, mostly because it not only sounds awesome but also gives a breath of fresh air to the game.
---
We get a new skill that everyone can participate it, not just an update that is restricted to a certain players (slayer, pvm, pvp, etc) it's something that everyone will be new to and give it an awesome feel
---
I saw somebody at Wintertodt who had their name over their head in green text. Why is that?
---
Except that if you have RS3 membership you also have OSRS membership...
---
At 15 years old you had hundreds of accounts?
---
Did you see that photo of the Venezuelan grandma farming Zulrag? I wouldn't be surprised that some of them do Infernal Capes.
---
Actually no. This is just the post that has broken my back.
---
Worst fucking community I have ever had the misfortune of "joining". Smh.

---
Yes I did
---
What about this post broke your back? You literally self destructed randomly
---
Yeh. You could say this about anything. It’s basically a conspiracy theory.
---
I don't know, new skills back then **were** exciting, well, slayer, construction and hunter at least ^^^^and ^^^^even ^^^^summoning.  Farming is different and nice too. Warding just looks boring af tbh.
---
Is he on your friendslist?
---
"no limit" it clearly says 2.147 billion limit though
---
Hundreds. That is at least 200. Can you give a rough estimate of how those were distributed amongst the various websites you listed?
---
Nah. I often think of red = no and green = yes.
---
As a f2p with all quests completed and all stats 40+, this is really kind, I've been grinding on f2p for a bond and it's hell.
---
It’s so you know you don’t forget to put it in.... for example... you forget to put it in and are about to Tele but you see the colour hasn’t changed so you stay and put in the compost.
---
For the time being. I just haven't bought membership yet. It's a snowflak account , Karamja Only
---
No, but you are. I literally said the reason I’m annoyed is there isn’t a warning when you first get the spell, unlike any other pvp feature in this game. Go to wilderness, there is automatically a warning. Go to a pvp world, there is automatically a warning. Go to lava maze, there is automatically a warning. The warning has to be enabled with the bh teleport. It’s counterintuitive. I think it’s annoying that the default is no warning when I doubt the majority of players expect no warning when the use it the first time about whether they’re going to teleport to multi or not. I don’t get why people (like you) just immediately resort to being dicks about something that makes a pretty decent amount of sense.
---
Rs3 bad, osrs good
---
Upvotetes to the left plz
---
Little dense for common sense? IF YOU ENTER A BH WORLD AND GET THE RUNES AND THEN CLICK THE TELEPORT, Why would there be a warning? YOU'RE deliberately teleporting into the wildy to your target, you also have to log into the BH world. Okay the rest of the warnings make sense! For this one theres multiplayer steps to even use the spell, and then you gotta get the runes, youd have to be braindead to 'accidentally' use the spell..
---
Did u cook at the ge on a f2p alt inbetween ur breaks? I was chatting to a guy the other day who was taking a break there while trying to take inferno down, just wondering if if was u, maybe 10 days ago
---
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Pastebin
---
I mean, the bp and assembler are both blue, although personally I prefer the previous look as well.
---
It’s a warning for if you’re teleporting into multi or not. Have you even used it before? Really sounds like you haven’t.
---
why not construct a ladder?
---
I found the pastebin of all my old information, hence how I even knew I was keylogged
---
Most of the sales of tbow and scythe are resales rather than new ones entering the economy. The GE makes tradeable assets extremely liquid and allows you to buy and sell them on a whim to "borrow" items
---
Ohboy
---
No, I dont do BH. Okay? Your target could be anywhere you're the one getting ready to teleport, if he happens to be in multi so what you took that chance!!
---
Be careful lol. Sounds like the want you to enter you password of your pure... so they can have it... sounds phishy 😉
---
Maybe at the GE in virtually every world?
---
Because during Dev time, in between something being an idea and being finished, you realize a lot of your initial ideas were shit.
---
No I mean like how many Facebook accounts did you have? Myspace accounts? Yahoo accounts? Rsps accounts? Remember, you claim to have had at minimum 200 total accounts.
---
You’re not a little dense, I was wrong. You’re really dense. I also highly doubt you actually have ever used the spell. The warning tells you if you are going into multi or not, not if you are are you want to teleport to your target. This is important cause a ton of clans just sit in multi and wait for single players to teleport in. You obviously don’t pk if you don’t see the importance in knowing this and if you haven’t even used the spell I have no idea why you would try to argue this lmfao.
---
I dont think the combat system needs to be changed, that is literally when rs2 started going down hill.
---
r/braindead
---
You can read my other reply. You’re obviously not a person that understands pking at all.
---
you know with enough effort and people you could spear one allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll the way over there.
---
yeah im not sure how it works with accounts with few quests done honestly.
---
???? Battle wards isn’t that op or “wild”.
---
If we are talking about wild shit, T-bow &amp; blowpipe should be deleted from game.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Time for a new gf
---
But that was never valuable to begin with. 🤣
---
I believe the player base will drop by about 50% within six months of Warding being released. Should it happen. 
---
However I also believe that enough people have come to realise how poorly thought out the skill is after the most recent blogpost
---
This is cute af
---
change +1 to "1" and it sets it to a single item
---
thats nuts, hows it worth 27m
---
Hell yeah nekrogoblikon!
---
The first line of Runescape code is a code comment saying: "Whoever microwaved fish in the office last night. Fuck you."

Why would training to level 10 combat cost 20/30 million?

^^^^^^lol jk
---
...if people left rs3, why would they try to make osrs more like rs3?
---
Poison is indeed a f2p mechanic because of the moss giant boss.
---
It’s a new item in the game from the new treasure trail rewards. I’d assume over time it will go down just a high demand I guess https://www.ge-tracker.com/item/cape-of-skulls

Dragon bones give dragon fruit? 🧐
---
One person I know in real life has left RS3 because of all the micro transactions. He “can’t afford to keep up” with everyone else. 
---
MTX is something that can put people off RS3 while they still prefer the gameplay.
---
so the pointless skill is too useful to avoid? 🤔🤔🤔 
---
look at the big brains on this one
---
Didn't realize he was doubling until after he scammed you? 🤔
---
The Office. Michael says something like "thanks for the hard work everyone, I ordered Alfredo's as a thank you." And Kevin goes "this is important Michael: Alfredo's Pizza or Pizza by Alfredo?" And Michael answers wrong and everyone groans.
---
Yeah, i hate the constant brainless, jagex gonna kill game reee jagex 11$ jagex wont ban clans ect
---
What a bunch of brainlets, if you want change do it in way you would irl not in these childish ways.
---
I think a new skill would be fun, I just don't like watching. I don't think it adds anything good to the game.
---
Don't ask to report here
---
Wow 🤘🏼👏🏼
---
\&gt;Googles 'osrs mysterious box'  
---
\&gt;Sees that it has a chance to roll rare drop table
---
Yes
---
Why do we need to take more risks when 90% of content adding polls pass by flying colours?
---
Honestly just feels like people who want warding to pass suddenly want to lower the passing percentage so it's more likely
---
Ooo awesome muilt combat figger better then goblen

Your dog hates you reposter.

I still don't understand people who are against Warding

But it wasn't!

Miscellania isn't too relevant for normal accoubts tbf

^^^^ Summoning 2.0 can suck a fat one 👍🏼
---
Buying high and selling low on Binance.
---
Yeah I agree. I was like ok when is this "savage clan" going to kill this one person. Like it just got boring as shit.
---
😢 insanely unlucky and lucky at same time
---
I dont think you got the joke
---
get a blowpipe
---
What about we set the Tibesman's level to slightly higher than the player's automatically. To avoid people getting free XP, just make damage dealt give like 1/10th the XP. To deal with having lots of Tribesmen for every level hanging around, make them appear specifically for each player on a random basis.
---
Those days were fun because back then you didn't know anything about the skills. When you know everything about the upcoming skill and you don't like what you know then that's where the problem is.

What’s your rsn I’ll message you in game and show you the ropes.
---
Swap out Verac's helm for more mage accuracy. Keep on practising and you'll get the hang of it soon :P
---
nodding in and out of consciousness while high off heroin
---
You missed the part where they said they were an  ironman so they need to do zulrah to actually get the blowpipe
---
Yes, you are correct. This is my first time playing runescape and I’m trying out pure.
---
You absolute bastard. 
---
Nice
---
If I could upvote this post twice I would. 10/10 agree
---
Finally did it, 1st try I messed up with not having any run energy when I entered and got messed up. Second time went good and I managed to kill him.
---
get good
---
I am Phoenix,  are you still doing the quest?
---
Prof. Ash says this isn’t the place to use that
---
Taken down, wait for it to come up on YouTube.
---
I'm not really into that but I did mod skyrim to replace dragons with a dragon shaped macho man randy savage
---
&gt; And yes IP bans are much much more effective than account based
---
The early 2000s called. They want their IP bans back.
---
Something dumb that may help is make sure you're on a local world for you, I know it sounds dumb but I've got friends who try to boss on NA worlds (UK based) and complain about server lag.
---
I would suggest getting void gear and there's a website (I can't remember it sorry) where it shows you where to stand for what rotation and snake colour it is. 
---
Another thing I suggest is just try watching more YouTube videos on the fight it can help.
---
Some aspects are brilliant imo but most are just aids
---
Imbuing rings is aids imo but my main worry is battle wards and conjuring screams summoning which is not good seems like there trying to buff magic but with skill when they could just do it seems like just giving us a skill for the sake of giving us a skill
---
its shit
---
Zulrah is doable with very bad gear, but you need good rng and you should know all the rotations.
---
And since your gear is fine you just need more practice.
---
No worries wasn’t sure cheers bud wanna see the summoning v2 mess that is warding explained many thanks
---
He seems like a nice guy but fuck me does he have one cancerous cc

RNG unlucky that's all there is to it, keep doing your farm runs and you'll get it eventually

---
Looking at ge on osrs website its 96m up 4m in just 24 hours the price is rising after a low and previously was over 105m so id estimate current offers around 105m
---
why stay 80 hp when you plan on going deep wildy pking?
---
Why didnt you use justiciar? Isnt it cheaper than bandos?
---
Petition to have all the comments in the source code made public
---
False comparison lol.
---
Well actually it's not ridiculous. If they can link your reddit account to your RS account you may have, at some point, given out identifying information. The more information you can gather the easier it could be to recover your account. Often people dont even realise that given out slight information of who/where they are may lead back to other social media profiles
---
Welp, somebody should have told Blizzard this.
---
In summary; you sold a product and now you're trying to scam by forcefully taking it back. Got it.
---
I think what’s interesting is, we love the original skills,but at the same time, the times have moved on, we need MORE to be happy. 
---
Another skill like agility would just be shit! It’s fucking boring! 
---
I like the sound of warding, sounds fun with some interesting perks, doesn’t really effect endgame and has a lot of interesting features 
---
having 1 wont do shit, put 100 and it has some effect
---
14 plus 5 equals 21? 
---
Having membership still gives you an edge even if you are a complete noob. Nothing wrong with that
---
Bug is also a slang term for small invertebrates in general
---
&gt;Please do not bore me with "this guide is shit follow this one" 
---
this but unironically. oziris pastebin guide or no guide
---
That would work for a couple days until the bot makers figure out a way around it and then the filter would just serve to limit legitimate player speech
---
I used to think this, but when I got to that stage I realised it's pretty easy. Triple jads is actually ridiculously easy--it's the exact same as 1 jad, but you just have less time in between attacks. Same principle as regular jad, if you don't panic then you're golden. 
---
6 jads on the otherhand... Watching that shit made my head reel. It took me 430 attempts before I managed to clear it, and it was so many levels of difficulty above triples (and even Zuk imo). But it's the same deal: it *looks* impossible, but there are so many things you learn when you're actually doing it that bring it back down to reality.
---
OP just exposed himself rofl.
---
Also E isn't going to get banned or anything that dude bought a shitty custom tag in rs3 for 5k$ Also he is a pmod so the favouritism is there from Jagex even tho they are aware of what happend to your username.

Adding new content isn't going to ruin the sanctity of a browser game from 2007.

You can recover an account, not a name

The higher the better. More yield per patch means less time prepping

Odin watches over you
---
My brother is currently 13k+ Dry of pet. These are rookie numbers.
---
If you think warding is even close to summoning you don't deserve to vote
---
I really like your thought process throughout this, would be good to hear what relevant Jmods would have to say about your suggestions!
---
Conjuring not mini summoning then no? Give your head a wobble
---
Probably :) ,Some player get at 60 or 70lvl
---
I agree with everything you said, which is probably why slayer and farming are my favourite skills, everything else i just do cause I kind of have to for diaries ect
---
bUy A tAbLeT!!!1!!!!!!!!11!1!1!
---
Different guy talking about killing 300rex...
---
I need smithing to make arrows and crafting to make jewellery there's plenty of room for overlap, I'm on team "make runecrafting interesting" I'd rather have fewer interesting skills
---
LOL comparing zul to infernal. You've clearly never done either
---
I don't mind them, but I know if I post that I'll be immediately downvoted and my opinion will be drowned out by the Reddit machine. You people are brutal.
---
Gz I hate you 
---
1400kc no claw
---
There is an even lazier but safe way to do waves with flinching in and out of pillars and attacking relevant mobs, flicking prays and dragging back into the pillar, but obviously this will take a while to kill things.  Helpful if you are like me and worry you may screw up a 1t while in ko-able hp
---
Playing rs in luxury, that chair looks comfy af
---
Nah lets upvote posts of people who finally did jad in 10 years with 85 ranged and toxic blowpipe instead
---
Gimme dat Oldak coil boiii
---
Our devs have displayed immense incompetence over the past year (see drama calender), and warding will surely be met with disaster. Potentially even requiring rollbacks? (See farm guild tbow and max cash glitch).
---
I hate these over-the-top fake reactions you see on Twitch.
---
yes
---
Why not just insta-kill everyone below level 20 every 60 seconds. That'll teach them for skilling at low levels!
---
Shit country
---
Yeah, HC too. The advanced button is on RS3 I'm pretty sure.
---
I LOVE SELLING RANARR!
---
But I don’t understand it.
---
No, they use the 5 day free membership from creating the account on mobile
---
Your ability to read correctly is not my problem.
---
In all fairness, Dungeoneering had a very minigame feel to it. The rewards were good, but they were rewards rather than skill unlocks.
---
e.g. At 65 Fletching I can make a Yew Shortbow, I literally just need logs and a bowstring. At 21 Dungeoneering I can use a Bonecrusher, except I can't because it's a prize that needs to bought with tokens after completing x number of floors. There's a big difference IMO.
---
Is that a rune scimitar present box?
---
That's actually so beast
---
Why don’t we just throw graceful in the trash. Huh bud is that what you want? You wanna be lazy? Huh bud?

## Old School Content Poll #66: Hosidius Rework and QoL Changes (16-Mar-2019 12:15:40)
---
2nd question
---
I asked a simple question to re word it so it can make more sense. Why is that so hard?
---
It's blue... So is the blowpipe and the assembler...
---
It fits the set more than the Pink version which doesn't match with ANY other parts.
---
There's even adverts for people running rigged bots
---
You could try to add this player, if any get added to your list it will have been their previous name. If the previous name icon dissapears in your friendslist after a while it should mean it's up for grabs
---
Damn you..
---
there is no one correct way to play so its up to you, however quests give a really good base for pretty much all the skills so i would recommend doing them
---
not needed for duo, dwh is enough
---
Can we get this guy to follow Swampletics around, demanding he leave his swamp??

I like what your writeup, except the crystal halberd isn't very good. DDS &gt; CHally in every situation.

In this order.. Focus on...

Memorizing will come naturally.
---
I am a newer player all F2P and have collected 3.25 mil so soon i will get a bond but i have some questions What is this with warding (the new skill)  and why do people Hate it
---
It's better to just get a slayer helm and do slayer.
---
Fair enough never done duo only solo and team of 4+
---
Hmmm level 3 skillers in f2p would not rejoice this though...
---
Make it a level 7839 tribeman that one shots anyone below 99 fishing or level 12
---
How?
---
unless you are some form of restricted accout no
---
Ahh, OSRS. They just don't make games like they used to
---
H
---
I mean yeah I have too, but them coming from warding would be so much better IMO. I know that is an unpopular opinion but I'd rather it come from warding for sure.
---
Depends what you want to do. For Vork it's 100% worth it, and I can't speak for ToB because I haven't done it but from what I've seen it's BIS there too.
---
You pretty much just repeated the title
---
Haha I get it, RS3 bad! OSRS Good! 
---
Nice one OP!
---
I'd almost agree with this except that not all of them are likely to be bots. Some could, in fact, be legitimate players.
---
I think it recovers about 75% of all ranged ammo. There is a 20% chance the ammo will break and be unrecoverable and 5% chance it'll drop on the ground. I'm not too sure on these numbers but the percentages should be around those values.
---
It seems you've met an aussie pmod :p
---
Honestly shifting from what they have now sounds like a ton of work, just to have essentially the same thing we have now (as far as content).
---
What would be the main advantage of doing this? Because the current setup process to play Runescape is very minimal.
---
Switching programming languages is often a complete system rewrite and would be massive amounts of work for the size of RS, and for the most part, most users wouldn’t notice anything except for the bugs that would come along with rewriting a shit ton of code.
---
Were you phished or have you downloaded anything lately? 
---
If your password wasn't changed then it's likely one of the above. Do you watch twitch, any quitting or bonus exp streams? They often also ask for your authenticator code.
---
If they got past your bank pin, likely a RAT (unless a phishing site asked for that, which some do).
---
Idk, I use the boost pretty frequently. Anytime I redo my POH and most of the time when I'm training Con. Besides, I don't see why adding it would be a problem for those it isn't relevant to. The second and free argument could be said for most charged items, yet you probably don't want their displayed charges or check options removed.
---
Void is definitely worth it if you plan to range anything that's not a slayer task.
---
Exactly what we want....
---
The end perfectly describes half this sub every major update
---
Honestly all that gear but cba to get a neitz helm
---
Doesn't look interesting and I can't be arsed doing it for the achievement diaries and whatnot.
---
🦀🦀🦀Jagex is powerless to Chairs 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Yeah, but that relies on humans paying attention or wanting to interact with you.
---
how is this funny?
---
Brah there's even videos of basically automated pvp bots that react to everything. Maybe come back to -19 from -06 and do some research.
---
They literally were removed because bots were programmed to work around them. It aint hard to flag if attacked run away and picking up axe handles.
---
2007scape is fine with a bunch of half naked guys all over each other as long as it’s not gay
---
lol ok but if you do slayer you're also getting slayer exp and actually making your account better...
---
Haven't read much admittedly but I'm already a HARD disagree on going for graceful straight from 10 agility. You'll need high fishing, it's so much better to just afk/3 tick to around 83 fishing for the levels before you go for graceful. Makes the 15 hours of you getting graceful actually allow you to get decent xp rates and get to a decent level
---
nice and even on the hardcore
---
r/woooosh
---
Yes will answer soon more in depth
---
If you want long term investment in your account then start by doing quests. If you want to get strong immediately then afk train strength/range at an npc called Sand Crabs.
---
Basically just do what you want to do. If you like questing, then do as many quests as you can before you burn out. I didn't take that route. I just power trained my strength using the most efficient methods and then started doing slayer for money. Sitting at an 85M bank now so I enjoyed the decision I made.
---
They've said that they're likely not going to take any currently obtained imbues from anyone and that instead, if Warding + Imbues passes, that any future imbues would need to be obtained via Warding.
---
"It's not even remotely close to summoning, but includes summoning familiar that do damage or buff you during combat"
---
????????
---
its coming from both sides and if you actually pk deep wildy you would know everyone could be toxic just as much as pkers, and obviously theres more pkers in the wildy than pvmers thats why you would think its only coming from them and sometimes they risk much more than "just a spade", its just a stupid meme.
---
Well I bought things from stores and resold at GE for my first bond, but current rune prices really eat your margin now. I'd strongly recommend just putting the $11 in or whatever bonds cost.
---
Whoever is running these bots can literally make them faster than Jagex can ban them.  Especially when they can gain made accounts through phishing links.
---
+1 should be +4 since adding the 4 will give 5, doing a +5 would mean you’re buying 6 then.
---
So people shouldn't be excited for getting the best accomplishment in old school?
---
It’s a good clan innit

We’ll take the box

Did you even read what he said?

&gt;I would rather get woox to decide the future of the game than polls tbh

MSB (I) plus amethyst arrows is actually pretty good and worth using at lower levels.

It's a purely cosmetic item that makes a normal rune scimitar into a Rune Scimitar (Saradomin).

---
nah, those that were around for the introduction of hunter, slayer, rc, farming and constuction should have more weight in their opinion... They directly experienced the game before and after each update. People that played after 2007 simply haven't experienced what people with 15 year capes have. It's just facts.
---
ty
---
Ah yes, the forgotten option
---
Or just give the options for each of the buttons to be customizable..
---
Requires engine rework sorry
---
Obviously, but yeah better ways that dont or minimally effect legit players.
---
Lol, and here I am with an X wondering how anyone plays with smaller than the plus-sized phones.  Feels like I barely get by with the real estate *I* have.
---
Yeah water runes are so expensive...
---
You underestimate my power
---
No don't change it! If we change it then it won't be 2007scape anymore!
---
They're nothing similar. Like even remotely lol.
---
Ohh yeah if you're low level you should just be questing, didn't realise we were talking about early levels because obsidian was mentioned lol
---
This more than doubles the art teams workload. Oldschool graphics and OSHD are not just higher res/more polygons of each other, it's a stylistic change. You don't just make a high poly model and high res textures, then decimate the model and lower the texture to 16x16. OSHD and Oldschool would require 2 separate models and 2 separate textures for every single current piece of content and new piece of content, each of which needs to be playtested on to ensure that everything looks good and works appropriately on both vastly different graphics settings.
---
People who think OSHD is not a huge undertaking with a huge long-term commitment know nothing about making videogames.
---
You can't loot other players stuff anymore
---
L on your forehead uncle
---
Yes /sounds great. Get into a pvp battle with pirate player. He destroys your ship and plunders your chest which. It could be pvp2.0 on the open seas.
---
Use construction to build your ship. Other players to join your crew to raid islands or undersea dungeons. Raids 3.0.
---
You guys probably wouldn't want it either way if you tried it out on RS3. Invetion is pretty much the exact same thing and it doesn't bring and fun at all
---
You do realize that all of the other scrolls have the solution links directly on the page right? Oh wait, you didnt.
---
Thats why I said, they are there, but you have to dig for them. Unlike all the other clue scroll levels. 
---
Youd know that if you read the post, but you didnt.
---
Looting tbh.
---
That gave me a laugh thanks

Lol he skinny as hell

"OLY" = Olympus Clan (High Level Ironmen Clan)

I’m the guy in the picture, under “NPC Indicators” type in Venenatis so it tags the Boss and after a couple kills it will show the timer. This works for every monster as long as you’ve typed its name to start tagging it.

I just assume it would be totally unplayable in a sense where you would actually be fucking working in the game lmao. Could you imagine doing fletching? Having to do all those movements and shit. Only way a fletching cape would be impressive 😂

Honestly mate, the great thing about raids Is that even at your stats you can do some cheeky raids with your mates. Just note that stats do make a major difference if you want to jam raids seriously for the most points per hour.

Can’t let that agility xp go to waste

Ok, matlab.

Try for elite void. Off the top of my head all you need for the hard western diary is 70 thieving cos you can boost it to 75. Looks you have rest of skill requirements. May need a few quests too.
---
Tfw you have more claws than me 
---
And I’m at 4K kc
---
Or make it a +4 for buying 5 of something
---
Ye, I think your suggestion is overall better, however it seems pretty difficult to implement. I mean, the most common way to bypass it is logging into a pvp world, which I'm guessing requires you to key in your pin before logging in, which means the above suggestion would be much easier to implement.
---
*Nightwish Planet Hell Intensifies*

Banning them while they have 50M in their inventory certainly does something.

Slash is too high... should be around  +7/+8 to beat out fighter hat but not by much. Overall I don't see much wrong with it.
---
This one
---
I agree, I buy items in specific amounts and I’m used to the +1. I tried using the + and - buttons after seeing this post and they’re way too far away to be useful.
---
Why you bully me?
---
LMAO force people to prayer switch while fishing!
---
that MTX, you're thinking of Motocross.
---
Finally a genuine expression, not just mashing their fingers on their keyboard like some primal beast that forgot how to be human.
---
It probably is worth noting that Legendary is mainly a cosmetic upgrade to Ascended. But Ascended has a bit of a similar process with time-gated crafting and untradeable resources.
---
A more drawn out Crafting system could be neat, but I don't see it working in OSRS. The issue isn't so much the lack of content, but the requirements for BiS Gear. If endgame gear is untradeable, it is usually from PvM so if you did lock BiS gear behind say Level 95 Smithing with a bunch of PvM, PvP, Skilling, and Minigames to get the materials, it would be a pretty big change. That said, you could do that but also make the new item tradeable so it would be of high value.
---
Also, a bit off topic, but I think something like the RS3 Port's Armors would be good for Skilling. You'd have a tradeable degrade to dust set and then an untradeable version with the exact same stats that degrades like Barrows. Or you could make the tradeable degrade like Barrows and the untradeable not degrade. Then you don't lock the stats and effects of new gear behind Skilling, avoiding the Extreme Potion problem, while still providing a worthwhile benefit to training those skills and making your own armor.

DWH is BIS at CoX and Corp. In ToB, you'll want one BGS on your team and rest DWH. BGS is also convenient for a one-way switch. At Bandos, I'd recommend a BGS cuz the DWH can never hit for shit there. At Vorkath, BGS is undeniably BIS.

I’m pretty sure the offensive language ban is for people who try to circumnavigate the profanity filter.
---
Is this your room?
---
One of my suggestions was to change it so you just needed a Channeling Lamp with Vis and the Fabric. It would function about the same as using a needle and thread with the Lamp being the Needle and the Vis inside being a thread of sorts. But I do think it could be worthwhile to have the Vis as a material since there can be a variety in types of Vis and the Lamps would store all the types to avoid bank space issues.

You have to pay to do it with a fire cape and you burn a shit load of time. Considering a fire cape can take up to 1H45 + however long Infernal takes, a death is a lot of wasted time and supplies.

---
btw don't do this, it generates a ton of lag for me. now I gotta manually remove every single tile LOOOL
---
It only takes 1 fire cape for infinite attempts, also with a tbow, firecape should take &lt;30 minutes
---
The Mahjarrat Aura issue is grossly overstated because 5% dps doesn't compare at all to the berserker auras. I like the idea of auras, but they do have some shortcomings.
---
In cox you want both on the team
---
I still don’t know what waterskins are. Little bollocks of water you carry around in the desert?
---
I used to think this too then messed around with the dps calculator spreadsheet. 
---
A good example is a warrior ring instead of a b ring for your bgs at vork. With the warrior ring you have like 1% more chance of hitting (even at 99atk with piety and super attack). B ring adds to max hit and has overall higher dps and more than makes up for the 1% hit
---
Hes hanging with his bwananas
---
I think there should be a toggle of plus or minus  (plus default) that way you don't need to go to X when you accidentally overtap a +100.  This way I could do a +100 or a -100 all based on a toggle
---
Does dying in fight caves cost you hc status? Or does she have to tp out.
---
Now that you say it. When i was in 4th grade I would actually dream of them adding new skills. SAILING
---
Okay but there still would be zero difference between adding the herb to a fire from someone with1 fire making vs 99, so this did nothing to make fire making useful

The problem with Osrs is that, to have the most fun in this game (things like high-level PvM-ing) you need to get high skills. And you said you have little time to play, so it would be wise to do the best/most efficient methods to train your skills up. To be able to get to your desired goals earlier.
---
That's just the way I think about it and the way I like to play the game.
---
False.
---
no clue i also wondered that
---
bruh the seeds are just as expensive as ever while the herbs have dropped in price yeah if you are lucky and your herbs dont die than yeah lets calculate.  
---
Snapdragon seed=52k  
---
snapdragon herb 7.8k  
---
you need to get 7 herbs from patch to profit. I avarage about 8 and i can do all patches except for elite dairy reward. and if 1 or 2 patches dies which happens almoust always for me even tho i use ultra compost i am at a loss, my rng sucks.....
---
Well played.
---
I want to alch other people though
---
I'll take your word for it but i remember it very clearly and tracked it fine, using the usual bosses
---
The small amount of people who would be upset about it is dwarfed by the amount of people who would be upset about warding passing / would be happy about the change to Runecrafting. Also theres a ton of people who buy ess runners so really, what did you achieve with 99 RCing if you just paid some Venezuelans to bring you essence while you jerk off at the Nature altar
---
I love how in a game with fairly limited character customisation certain people are able to achieve an iconic look that everyone knows either by certain actions or just pure creativity
---
Complain about the complainers complaining about complainers complaining about complainers.
---
Don’t say that, I just started trying...
---
That is incorrect. The other lunar gear is impacted, as is the bonesack from my personal experience. There are others as well that I have not encountered. 
---
The wiki is not always correct. 
---
Try it with a bonesack in game and be amazed.

Lol it’s not that hard.

I believe you ask for the task, as he should be able to do anything you can (barring a few exclusions)
---
at that point you might as well get a chromebook for 100$ though
---
Probably fletching
---
Jes this is true
---
People don't want it to get faster because it would devalue their 100's of hours in RC. If you added a 100k exp/hr method that was cheap to do everyone would do RC, and the people with high RC now would throw a fit.
---
If only there was some sort of event that happened when you spent long times afking that spawned something dangerous to help prevent bots
---
While the game mostly is a grind gaining XP, there are other aspects of the game that can be fun for people. Questing, games like Castle Wars Pest Control and Barb Assault, Bossing, Clue Scrolls/treasure trails, flipping items and simply exploring the world.

Go to the mini game tab in game - then shield of arrav - then click join - it should take you to a clan chat of other people who are looking for quest partners in that quest
---
Your correct that he is using the best alternative, other then maybe the penance stuff from barbarian assault which one of those lowers weight too I believe.
---
Jagex did recently suggest making it so it doesn’t require the full set and each piece would have its own effect as well, but for the time being you are correct.
---
So the guy spent over 13 grand to max the account yet it has 0 value according to you? Excellent example.

Well yeah it takes 13m to get to 99...

no but i heard a few people had the same thing around the same day
---
not if you keep falling to go to the end lol
---
Authenticator isnt fool proof. Use an email that you dont use for anything else as theres a big chance that email will be in a database somewhere. I personally think bank pins need to be ingame passwords that you type in instead of 4 numbers. But probably "engine work"
---
It’s best use is continuing to train agility lol.
---
Holy fuck that sounds amazing.  Also, happy cake day!!
---
He broke the rules.  
---
Regarding the jmod approval:   
---
His wording implies that he asked a jmod to check a SPECIFIC alt in a prior season. This alt likely interacted with the game mode and took some risks. That specific alt would then be approved as it hadn't just stood in a safe zone at a bank. 
---
The alt that got banned apparently hadn't interacted with dangerous content enough to avoid automated mule detection.  
---
This is the difference between the banned alt and the one that a jmod approved. Unfortunately torvesta glossed over that aspect in his video and, due to his popularity, his many fans reacted only to his interpretation of events.
---

so that's why nobody likes me :(

jk fuck you all I'll keep my rng
---
fingers in foreground dont match fingers in background reeeeeeeeeee
---
Yeah ikr. We need people like you who enjoy minigames and bankstanding and shit. The ones who are in tears just because they can't do end-game content crying about how "they don't have Twisted Bows" can fuck off and quit acting like all of is top-tier PvMers started off with Twisted Bows and BIS gear. But at the same time, it's a game and not a life career. Tryharding feels great and all when you successfully land like 250 aviansies in one trip off one tick flicking the entire thing and prayer flicking the minions but damn gotta call it quits sometimes. Even Woox is a software engineer irl and doesn't use this game as his primary source of income.
---
Evil chicken was great
---
Concurrent player base of osrs is way higher then rs3
---
That's my point. What if it got into the game anyway? What if you became the minority? What would be your changes to the content if it was going to pass?
---
yeah you would man, you are valuable and have worth!
---
Make it a toggle IMO.
---
The game wasn't designed for mobile and the fact that it is as playable as it is today is impressive. That and they continue to change UI just to work with mobile more anyways.
---
That's how he was able to do it. No other rs character has hands and so wouldn't be able to get very far in their endeavours to massacre the good people of Falador, but Mr 321 had hands
---
Thanks i hate it
---
Is there any page where i can see the amount of players/active users in game?
---
I think what he means is "the king shouldve executed him himself" not the player but then again OP. This is a fantasy roleplaying game where you are the hero that everyone needs. A loudmouthed protector. The White Knight.
---
No, but that’s probably not an awful idea. Not sure if you’re doing PoH method. But I’d say 4/5 times I don’t get low enough to have to deal, so defender works fine for me. It’s got a pretty low defense and with arc light you tear through it, do whatever you prefer!
---
Where is that in OSRS?
---
🤣🤣😂😂😅😅🤔🤔😜😜
---
Oh wow I saw him doing that yesterday
---
Ohhhhhh I thought if you died you lost HC status. I was like is she teleporting out before she dies or something? I suppose that makes this a lot less impressive than I originally thought but I mean infernal cape will always be extremely impressive in general, let alone on an ironman.
---
I see. It's all good though, I'm just glad I'm done with it tbh.
---
On the different home pages. The osrs page will show at the top. Normally 80-100k at any given moment. Rs3 idk because they normally show the combined amount. So if it says 130k on rs3 page and 100k on osrs then that’s 30k on rs3.

There are services that outsource captchas to humans. Dont know the cost, but captcha is easy to get around if you are determined.
---
Well why not just bring nothing? It's a useless item that they presumably need to keep on buying every time someone kills them. Couldn't they just save the hassle by leaving it at home?
---
A lot of the player base seems to be around the same age bc a lot of us played back then :D
---
Bots can do all those. Why do you think they polled adding a Dismiss option in the first place? They also removed dangerous ones since it only annoyed legit players trying to cut a tree afk or whatever while bots dealt with them efficiently.
---
I wouldn't say something on this scale follows the same principle. Once those pass, they pass. What jagex is proposing is that everything after warding passes would need to be polled. 
---
Warding has already failed twice, showing that there is a clear gap between those who want it and those who don't. We see a lot of division between what aspects of warding are liked, and what aspects are disliked. So you take the people who vote yes with the thought of "oh I can vote on if I like that or not" and you have the people who voted no, and the people who only liked certain aspects of it voting no.
---
So if u forget tele u can tele out at 20 wild mate. The alternative is ring of wealth which is expensive.

That’s not true, the MoM Golden Grahams are leagues better than the name brand Golden Grahams, they aren’t similar at all

He wasn’t saying that it isn’t hard in general, just that it isn’t  “120m deep” hard.
---
Yeah it does for I’m guessing 2 minutes, and does minuscule damage. Just because it sounds like summoning because you conjure, doesn’t mean that it’s even closely related.
---
suggestion: go fuck urself
---
&gt; Either that, or they're phished accounts.
---
Bingo. If someone gets their account hijacked, and it's used like this, I wouldn't want Jagex to perma ban them for it. This is part of the reason why jagex doesn't just hand out perma bans willy nilly to "obvious" bots.

Man I wish I was like you, truly. Every time I watch a video or a stream of a particular game I like, I HAVE to play it afterward.

just because you find it "suffering" doesn't mean everyone else does. I got 99 and didn't complain or "suffer' and that doesn't justify adding easyscape methods.

---
You do realize that RS3 is this times 10, and yet RS3 mobile's interface is beautifully designed for mobile?
---
hmmmmmmmmm
---
it's almost like the osrs mobile devs only did the bare minimum to get the game running on mobile. They could do so much more to make the interface actually work.
---
Mikki has maxed several accounts  on rs3/osrs, has had plenty of alts and is generally really invested into the game. Her current (or prior, not sure) boyfriend is called CrystalFarm, he's got 200m all on rs3 and used to be rank 1 on a particular game mode on osrs (hc ironman iirc). 
---
So they're used to reaching noticeable milestones. Hence the lack of reactions.
---
&gt; Not a single actual human being says these phrases, while dressed in king outfit, while holding millions of GP traded to them by a stranger, while standing in the GE on a low level account.
---
Not all of them are low level, some are near maxed mains. 
---
What does that tell you?
---
He should be banned from the game for this level of fraud. He is as low as a common scammer.
---
So you can tele out of revs and then instantly tele to duel arena to heal and bank.  I really don't think that takes a lot of brainpower to figure out.
---
And you have to stand still for the effect
---
I didn't even suggest adding a way to make it AFK and fast. Just more engaging, the grind for higher RC is arguably the worst skill related grind in this game what's wrong with wanting it to be a little more engaging?
---
recoil is about million times better and costs nothing
---
She's got several maxed mains, so she's used to reaching massive milestones.
---
It's an option on the RuneLite client.
---
Trader Joe's Oreos are better than regular ones.  Honestly trader Joe's has the best generic products, but it's more than most generics because you're still at a trader joes.
---
if your goal is to fight back
---
It is.
---
Then do it with vials. Using tile markers is cheating.
---
But it literally is not :/  Let's not kid ourself
---
At any rate we can clearly see support isn't unanimous (or near it). For that reason alone I don't think warding should pass.
---
you have the most unorganized bank ive ever seen jesus christ
---
That will probably be enough since u don't need anymore buyables and most bosses nowadays have huge cash drops such as hydra, which will allow you to flat out buy blood runes should you ever run out.
---
Tbh my bank password is still the least secure password.
---
Mm1 is rough, IM life is always the way to go :D
---
Might be thinking different things, its possible that I am just missing it but notify, notifications, active, window all return nothing that would be close to what im looking for. If you happen to remember this when you get back from work and wanna check that'd be great. Just to clarify I do get the notifications for all the things I listed if I'm not active on the window its just that rl doesn't want to notify me when it's focused, which is what I'm trying to fix.
---
Colour it! I have light blue graceful and the trollweiss flowers and they match perfectly. Its simple but my fashionscape has never been better lmao
---
For me my favorite skills have a verity of training methods and locations. Namely I love fishing because it has a profitable AFK method(cage and spear fishing), a faster non-profitable AFK method (fly fishing), and a much faster non-profitable non-AFK method (3-tick fishing) and there are a lot of different locations to fish.

You also get proselyte armor for using protection prayers while meleeing, which is a common tactic for slayer
---
Yeah I tried some things from the list but I don't have a starting capital or the right levels for most things, thanks a lot for the help though!! Really appreciate it!
---
This is the only cosmetic thing I like in rs3 - being able to hide helmets.

Nobody wants hot keys.
---
youll never really bank a lifetime supply of bloods unless you bank like few hundred mil or more gp at revs.
---
Ye not a huge deal but still ridiculous that anything is BiS that could only be received from 4 years ago
---
it is consistency for the everyday user. if you want to sell/buy a round number or something it's far easier to do so in one click instead of two (+10 then remove 1). and i guarantee you most people would go with the first option. 
---
i played the original rs till eoc and it was infuriating having to keep setting the amount and having to buy/sell +1 amount of everything. the osrs g.e is much more intuitive and easier to use.
---
Good luck getting 75% ya nerds
---
THERE AGAIN. I did not once suggest something even remotely close to "easyscape" I said I wanted more variety because I found the grind on RCing to be abhorrent.

You do realize that it actually doesn't matter?
---
The strength of your password only protects you from bruteforcing. Jagex already limits the amount of login attempts one can do.
---
If anything having a complex passwords hurts you, because you'll likely forget it or write it down. If you forget it, then you might not be able to recover your account. If you write it down other people might read it.
---
The vast majority of hacks happen because people 'give' their password away in plaintext. Either because they share their account or because they fall for phishing links, keyloggers, re-using passwords everywhere etc...

Alright then i'll say this, the time spent grinding is meaningless if the grind is enjoyable.

There it is its labelled as "send notifications when focused" but since its technically not a plugin searching doesn't actually check what setting it has in that tab. Sounds like one of those bug/feature kind of things but upside is now I know where the hell that setting is.
---
Literally they should just insert warding methods with a shared magic and rc requirement. This is similar to Cerberus boots. It would make rc less like a mobile game with a crappy time gate and actually add variety to the skills. As a standalone skill - hell no.
---
If you want to know a b2b drop rarity, look up the initial chance to get a drop so for example Zenyte is 1/300 then just 300x300=90,000 so to get a b2b Zenyte drop is 1/90k

Im someone who has been F2P for most of his playtime for both versions of the game. Only getting members when I can, and when I actively keep playing RS or OSRS. From my experience OSRS is a bit of a waste of time in F2P, there is very little to do in F2P to keep myself entertained. Most of the skills you do get to use are still practically useless when you reach a certain level in F2P (like Magic and Ranged for example).

Not the only one- but definitely a minority.

I could handle it as a mini game like BA with some med lvl BiS rewards, like some legs with +1 strength and no negative range accuracy- styled to match the fighter torso. Would be great for zerk pking like the torso, and then people could swap fighter torso for black dhide body and maybe not swap the legs if they were happy to lose the acc a black dhide chaps offer. Even though rune legs look okay with fighter torso, a matching leg set would be nice, even if it’s only best in slot for people with less than 50/60 defence.
---
Seripusly. Bots like these used to have to jump through all sorts of text hoops(\/\/ for w and shit)  to not get auto muted. Now these bots straight up announce everything no fear, even run time lol.
---
I wouldn't mind something akin to seed contracts for the skill, if it would help other people motivate themselves to train it, but I don't think the skill is really in need of significant balance changes. 77 is about 1.4 million experience. That's really not terribly high.
---
There's also clear division on this. I love runecrafting personally, and I tend to feel the same way about agility and fishing that most people do about runecrafting--but I'm not clamoring for an agility or fishing rework. Content that isn't to your taste isn't necessarily broken content.

Well it's not an issue the OP focuses on. OP focuses on the owner of the account keeping money lent to him.
---
Jagex ability to detect and ban RWTers has always been hit or miss. If you have evidence of RWT, ofc report it via the tipoff email.

Great idea, though it might not "fit" in the rev caves haha
---
Is its 5 days old I'd make a new account and stop watching quitting streams
---
This was our 9/11
---
The account 'Alarms' that was in our clan, that we talked to on discord and played with prior to the incident, was our friend who we felt we knew enough that a message received from his account wouldn't cause concern under normal conditions.
---
The problem is this troll who has abused the system. He sold an account, will have received money for it and then has deceivingly gone against that sale to steal the account back.
---
Meanwhile I’m approaching 3600 with neither
---
Just add smiley faces and the stupid :p face to every single thing you say. Pretend to care and add exclamation points here and there too.

A noob is gonna trust a shit show of phrase dodging a lot less, let alone even understand what it is saying. I know i did back in the day

&gt;to an extent
---
You can literally only see the eyes
---
Maybe not yet but eventually I gotta get to it.
---
Tldr im bad
---
It was always a complete joke.
---
That's still not as big as a bug that let's you run around and kill other players outside of the wilderness, where they can't fight back and lose items.
---
Same man! The best of days hearing that ice barrage
---
You didn't even share with your narrator? Omg such a dick.
---
If you last played OSRS in 2013-2014, a fair bit has changed but it is still more or less the same. [This page](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/wiki/updates) does a good job of summarizing the major updates over the years and it links to the wiki's full list of updates by year.
---
I'd say the most notable change would probably be the new bosses and gear. We've seen a fair amount of endgame PvM with the addition of Zulrah and two Raids, which also brought a lot of new high-end gear. Not quite Chaotics and Nex Armors, but some items like the Toxic Blowpipe, Twisted Bow, and Scythe of Vitur provide a pretty huge DPS increase even if they do have limitations and drawbacks (e.g. Twisted Bow is really strong, but only if the target has a high Magic Level).
---
But despite that, stuff like Bandos, Whip, Fire Cape, and Barrows Gloves are still good. Bandos and Armadyl are still BiS armors while Whip, Fire Cape, and B Gloves have seen successors, but they aren't widespread due to cost or difficulty to obtain. Other updates of note would be the Grand Exchange for trading, Achievement Diaries for all regions of the world, Resizeable Mode, and some new areas like the continent of Zeah, Fossil Island, and expanded Morytania and Feldip Hills.
---
To address the title, overall I'd say the state of the game is pretty good. There have been some issues, especially in recent months, but most issues have been or are being addressed, even if not the quickest. Some find the rate of new content to be too much, but I'd say the updates have been at a reasonable pace with enough new things to help keep interest without too radical of changes happening. There are still some unresolved issues like Death Mechanics and some drop table balancing that are on the to-do list but not immediate priorities, but the game saw a big spike in players with the release of Mobile and it has been steadily growing for years.
---
Range your slayer tasks and don't forget to use ranging potion they're worth it
---
sad thing is this Pet skill is more genuine than warding and actually serve a unique function.
---
I think they use mutliple attack styles so it'd suck even if you tried
---
Oh forreal? I thought expected tips were like 1m+
---
I'll try next time, thanks!
---
ya man that's what it's about. ign?
---
I’ve never heard of anything. You can just choose to not trade with anyone or duo+ bosses.
---
I mean you can check my post history, I generally reply to all kinds of crap on this sub such as this.
---
They should just require two factor authentication w/ phone number for all players. When you get banned, any accounts using same phone number have to get assigned a new phone number.
---
My computer has a function that it will record if I press certain buttons. And I dont know what the buttons are. So I not have like 20-30 clips of me running around Runescape questing and being a noob. But I feel like he meant to post a gif of something he recorded.
---
It's not real time, it's bot time, the bot doesn't care and the human can just have the bot set up more bots
---
Wow, you're a real baby, arentcha
---
Ah, I didn't know, my mistake
---
Are you talking about pvp? I'm more referring to pvm
---
Would be hella strong but super awesome
---
I see you're lapping up the leftover karma from that other post and complaining that not every player is a fucking incel.
---
It makes it harder for me to collect serum 207 sorry Gunna be a no from me but it makes sense
---
Yes I’m referring to PVP
---
its a nice gesture, but you sound like you havent even really mastered the f2p aspects of the game and honestly you could stand to learn a lot and experiene and level a lot in f2p. there's still very good options and areas to explore in f2p
---
Just highlight bro
---
How are you playing in HD?
---
Boy, are you bout to get a lot of downvotes and negative comments for Rs3. But I feel you I think it would look dope in osrs format
---
I mean if nobody bought accs the people who sold them would be involved in other services that aren't as directly against the TOS (hiring people to train accs is a big one I think a youtuber made a big vid on recently, for example).
---
It's only a thing because of the demand. Even the biggest 3p site for black market gaming services/products etc constantly tells you buying accounts is an absolutely awful idea.
---
exactly, I only recently started my RC grind from like 62 or so and it took me a few days to get 77 and 2 days into bloods and I'm at 82 and it really is not that bad, way more enjoyable than fishing, mining and all bankstanding skills
---
I feel like the most common tip is probably 10-50k with the occasional big baller
---
I hope he sees stuff like this
---
Ah I see Robin is learning from those who haven't acquired full graceful.
---
I do wonder why you think this is a problem runelite should solve for you and not just something you should do yourself lol.
---
I'm shocked that has been implemented in RS3, but has someone been oversighted on OSRS. Especially when it even asks for a pin when you are at the Blast Furnace.
---
I really had a hard time coming up with a title, but a lot of this could have been solved with a faster response time by Jagex and a better customer service focus for such a large game.
---
You could use like crystal hally or something like that for damage but def lowering specs are by far better
---
ah yea stupid me
---
whats diff between this and duel arena other than it being a bot XD
---
If they all require a roll back aren't they all just as bad
---
Only if they’re from superior drops
---
/c
---
Dang I would have zero clue what he meant until you imparted  your wisdom upon him
---
Was thinking along the lines of bronzeman mode the one guy made but it’s not available apparently.
---

---
Chatosrs
---
You also have a similar structure to your sentences as all of the accounts and images we have provided. Suspicious.
---
Surprised its not Florida tbh
---
&gt;If Jagex had 1 guy go in hopping from world to world for an hour a day outside normal business hours, they'd stop. 
---
What has made you believe this?
---
Focus on having fun! If you're doing a particular piece of content or training a skill and you get bored, go do something else! That being said, RFD is a great goal because it requires a lot of different skills and quests, some of which you can probably start now. After that you can set your sights on the quest cape. When I was starting my goal was basically just do as many quests as I could, and once I hit a stat wall or got bored I would switch to something else like grinding out void armor or doing some diaries. Once you get your stats up you can also look into getting a fire cape, torso, and grinding slayer. You should also try to get the varrock diaries and throne of miscellania done for some passive money makers.
---
Damn, that's some really cute ass nerd shit
---
they were like 46m 4 months ago. RIP ECONOMY
---
Huge scandal at the time. Permanently scarred jagex's image. Now it's just part of the meme machine. Like mod Reach who tried to introduce gold producing bugs to fund his Audi.
---
They should give it to you after you complete all the f2p quest in my opinion.
---
it shouldnt be ingame feature as its only used by people who stake, advertisers and scammers and u cant differ them from bots
---
It is an intentional game mechanic. You can only log in a certain amount of times every 5 minutes, and hopping counts as logging out then logging in. There’s probably server load or game engine issue or DDoS potential if it wasn’t in place. Also it slows down bots who are world hopping buying out shops so it does serve some purpose.
---
Robin is just learning from those players who haven't acquired full graceful and try to hide it.
---
He's using the front facing camera but also looking in the mirror, took me a while too
---
Happy I could help!
---
Level 20 
---
Has completed DS2 😥
---
So a weaker super combat potion, and a weaker ranging potion. Do you know why they added the imbued heart in the first place
---
I can't seem to find the person who asked for your dumb, worthless opinion? Strange!
---
but wouldn't you know what you are treating it with?
---
Yea I know. And paying for training accounts is stupid too. But I find that less of an evil than scamming people. From videos I've seen about it they suggest you remove everything from your account you dont want the trainer to have access too and leave gp for training/payment.
---
Again I dont see the joy in doing something like that, but I dont see it as bad as selling accs and retrieving them. You are essentially just being robbed irl $ from the retrieve, the training you would at least "have something to show for it".
---
do people not understand that the devs aren't going to make a whole new skills before they know if the playerbase is going to approve it? oh hey i want you to build me a fucking house but idk if i really want it so how about you just build it for free and let me live in it for a month before I decide. and if i decide i dont want it then you cant sell it to anybody else and have to just burn it down and salt the earth it stands on.
---
:thinking:
---
Yeah, I noticed that when I was looking at their wiki.
---
Found this on the reddit popular feed lol.
---
I got muted for saying a womans chest region, I was talking about a anime when hosting a g altar.
---
Literally every restriction-you-can-imagine-man mode is already available by just deciding what you think would be fun and then doing it.
---
Yeah, that way you never have to leave any boss ever

Teleport crystal so he can Tele out if something goes not according to the plan
---
They're the same attack speed though
---
I don't see what experience has to do with run time, unless you're dying in fight caves. It's not like I brought stams or venged jad or anything
---
Makes a lot of money towards end game
---
Ok I’ll try that thank you
---
as long as you have plenty of cannonballs, you can still easily make it.
---
Should be as long as your slayer isn't lvl1
---
You'd have made front page if you followed the noob protocol:

---
\- Must be wearing verac helm + skirt + god dhide body
---
\- Must have BP
---
\- Must have 80+ range, 85+ hitpoints, and 70+ defense
---
\- Must be your 3rd+ attempt at Jad
---
\- Must explain how you achieved your childhood dream
---
Yeah but that ice troll king fight is HARD.
---
It's still possible, yes, there's just less room for a cushion. Bear in mind you can also use lamps from diaries and if you really need to Temple Trekking gives tomes of experience in a few different skills. Super slow earning exp from TT but doable
---
inb4 dies to dc

Is there a good barbarian assault CC?  I’m a little tiring having to explain the game to new players every round.
---
Do you remember what ice you got the Phoenix on?
---
Such a good idea with the right implentation
---
ur dumb
---
? 2 years after is a lot different from 6. I’m pretty sure there are also more people playing now than there were in 2005, the changes are more impactful. It’s literally been fine for 14-16 years with what we have. Why do we need anything else? What is there to gain that isn’t already here?
---
I also didn’t say that, but yeah, it was fine then. Idk why anyone wants new skills in OSRS. We have enough, it’s an amazing game as is.
---
Idk sounds like a way to have a fun skill to train.
---
Why would it be if they're the same attack speed? On paper I'm pretty sure the rune cbow has the same speed, higher accuracy and higher strength

I had one guy who finished off maxing in my house and he donated 2,277,000 to me, that was awesome.
---
Training hunter is pretty quick, and there’s one quest to lay box traps, but once you’re 63 I believe, you can catch red chins for a good profit, and once you unlock black chins the money is really good (if you’re carful). 
---
There’s a million different money makers out there though. Some will be max gp, but less xp. Others will be less gp but also get you xp as well.

He did get bullied a lot probably more than he should have, but tbf he also said some pretty dumb shit too.

I think people who don't generally listen to music turn on the generic trance playlist.  I, personally, don't really listen to music but if I was streaming, I know that it is necessary.  
---
I know cavemanonly had a problem focusing on Olm when playing music.  It was a funk music-themed stream but he kept fucking up Olm and getting tilted because he was listening to the music instead of counting ticks.  I, personally, am the same way.  Normal music just gets in the way.
---
This is fake. The picture of him on his phone does not show his hand like it does in the mirror.
---
The ingame auto chat does not work unless its on public - auto chat, so everyone is having to use 3rd partys in order to have competition but this is way to many advertisers, I am sitting with a guy in his house now and the poor dude has no one and hes never done anything to the community.
---
triggered. 
---
thought settled uploaded.
---
massively disappoint
---
Yeah a lot of streamers have that "ironic" 2000s alt rock vibe since it pretty much appeals to the whole point of "old school" runescape.  It's what their audience listened to in the angsty kid days when they first started OSRS.
---
Dex is only around 58m these days. Still a lot better than an Arcane anyhow!
---
Sure, it's an advantage. But unlike other "advantages" like botting or RWT, you're the only one keeping yourself from using it. The rules of the game dictate the way the game is "intended" to be played, and if RuneLite/OSBuddy/other clients were unfair, they would be not allowed.
---
Treating any and all advantages gained from a tool as unfair is inherently naive. Especially if everyone has access to the tool.
---
what????????
---
The [phat dupe](https://runescape.wiki/w/Duplication_glitch) had a massive effect on the games economy, but I think the Falador Massacre is still more memorable and iconic. (even though its true effect was minimal)
---
There's been at least 2 item dupes (the one you refer to and another before), 2 max cash bugs (duel arena / coin pouch), and most recently a t-bow (1b value item in osrs) randomly spawning below Fally.
---
Best clickbait + crossover of all time?
---
I'm 600 kills with only 2 springs on my iron :))
---
I want to cum on her
---
And they're can be a stealth part where you have to sneak into the pub past a bunch of guards. And every time you get caught you have to restart.
---
Sounds like cheap dragon bones and prayer levels.
---
Or just make the (1) and (2) doses a non-GE item so you can still share potions and things with friends.
---
Efficiency is overrated. I'd rather choose a fun way to train, even if it isn't the best exp/hr.
---
He does
---
3.3k kc and no claw is dry as a the fucking Sahara
---
No I don't want a reason to do barrows
---
Fine, thanks
---
How much is that cape now
---
To further the Bandos point, BGS is ~45% more accurate.
---
I’m dry for pet bby
---
They added raids already.
---
Did u get it?
---
That's the best pet
---
126-30=96, he's 83cb
---
They announce cleaning out the chat and it doesn't happen nearly as often unless it's high traffic time. You can easily leave the cc for 2 mins after they warn and join back and you'll be fine. Also people who are highly active in the chat usually don't get kicked.
---
Good choice in coming to the sub for advice. You should start questing more. I recommend aiming for unlocking barrows gloves. They are the best in the game and relatively easily attainable. You will unlock much and learn even more along the way. 
---
If you absolutely loath quests, at least unlock fairy rings, and complete the Ardougne Easy Diary. Then start slayer.
---
Chym i dont know what it is. But you have like changed in the past year. I remember I used to watch you to learn raids and sometimes I would be put off by your attitudes at times. Like you were a good coach and all but it wouldnt be that pleasant of an experience. But now I actually enjoy just watching it for fun even though I know what I am doing and I am still learning little intricacies every room. Anyhow, keep doing you, keep growing as a person and keep on helping the community the way you do. Well done sir.
---
Basically you can do whatever you want bro. Pick a skill and stick with it.
---
Only if it also drops fire cape.
---
i like rune med helm season
---
I’d suggest aiming for barrows gloves to at least give you a better sense of the game
---
There's not really much they can do, these bots are made faster than Jagex can ban people.
---
It also doesn't help that these bots' owners get accounts by phishing scams.
---
Hard to say honestly since  these kill have been done over a long period of time i never really kept track of all loots.
---
I did have decent luck with uniques, rarely went more then 100 dry for any. If i would go more then 100, then i'd get like serp vissy , tanz, magic fang, onyx in 100 kc or something lmao.
---
If everyone had that attitude we'd be at each others throats all the time and the community would be completely toxic. Don't be a dick and just find a world of your own is the gentleman's agreement.
---
God I hate these kinds of posts.
---
To be honest, the one who sounds mad is the guy who is throwing a fit on Reddit because get the tips he felt entitled to.
---
They do, but the problem is that there is a stock of 10,000 accounts ready to log in and start up again.

oh yeah because those capatchas were so hard to solve /s https://classic.runescape.wiki/images/9/99/RestScreen.png hahaha so hard to solve by almost any bot with brains. other word: https://classic.runescape.wiki/images/b/b0/Screenshot_from_2018-07-30_02.31.47.png they were not hard at all to make the ai to read those slightly tilted words with multiple styles.

Could level farming for red chins, barrows, get up slayer to 55 and unlock cave horrors for hard clues(might need some requirements to complete them) and black masks
---
i didn't really join a community. i mostly only talk to people i already know. i'm just saying you're projecting hard.
---
It's a new item and stakers use it. You can actually tick manipulate attack with it which never has been able before.
---
I mean, it's a start. Not like I'm saying it's the cure all. Is it that hard to admit your argument is stupid?
---
Absolutely not! I just tested and it cost me 129k to buy 250 of each from Baba’s store...so I won’t be buying the nats from him as it cost 101k for the lot. 
---
The Astrals avg. 104/per if buying 250 at once, which would cost me roughly 2.6mil for 26k of them.
---
As for the nats, I’ll probably do a combination of RC and camping Kurasks. 
---
I already had to gather 5k nats for my 85-87 crafting grind (spin flax), so I am prepared to nearly triple that grind as it didn’t take TOO long lol. It’s times like these I miss the G.E.
---
Abdul Hakeem ign
---
Sorry if you notice any broken english in there, its not my first language.
---
So you're part of the problem if you just wanna play the game instead of constantly having to respond to random people accusing you of cheating when you're not? That's a pretty dumb way to look at it.
---
You said that the community knows best.  But it failed a poll.  Now you're saying that it shouldn't have been polled.  ???
---
wait, wait, wait.... hold your horses... uhm... YOU'RE A GIRL GAMER?!!?! O_O Not to be a freak, but.. just when I thought you couldn't get more attractive.. you started playing video games. Nicely done, m'lady. You've just become every man's dream woman. If you had missed a couple before, now you can be sure you've got us ALL "drooling", lol.
---
A year ago they were 30
---
That sounds like a good idea, I will do that one for sure, thank you so much!
---
Start farming! Herb runs are an easy money maker and you unlock ranarr at around level 30 I think. Completing My Arm's Big Adventure unlocks a disease free herb patch in Troll Stronghold.
---
Make sure you don’t risk anything too valuable - when you enter the Abyss you skull up and lose all prayer, so you’d lose everything (except some untradeables, like graceful) on death.
---
Penance gloves or GTFO

&gt;think they are saving the game
---
Then realize
---
&gt;Are we the baddies
---
Honestly confused as to how you misunderstood that
---
The falador massacre was not rolled back. Items weren't recovered, you were just fucked. 
---
So yeah, I'd say that's a lot worse.
---
dude nice that's bank loot from only 200\~ clues
---
It could've been literally any other item, that's not a very big deal
---
You want more than 90 str and 90 hp for dharok. Obby b4 that
---
2007 easy.  Pretty much the peak of runescapes popularity and then the subsequent killing of the game at the end of the year.  RS would never be the same until they rebooted the game using again a 2007 server backup.  Any other answer doesn’t come close in impact
---
Okay but the max cash and t bow got rolled back so it literally had no effect on the economy. The purple party hat dupe has effects still today as there are significantly more purple party hats in the game than any other color
---
The whole scheme is just a way to rwt and get paid twice. The original Alarms broke the rules by selling the account to begin with, but understands the system and how to exploit it in a way to not only get paid for first breaking the rule, but then to go back on his sale and get more funds and the account back.
---
Support. ToB is fun and all, but it's gotten a bit old. When we getting Raids III?
---
A lot of those events were deliberately challenging so I doubt leveling would even make them viable. Iirc, all they did was run away from them, not beat them, and most had to do that manually. Plus, needing another bot would make them much easier to catch.
---
A desert themed raid to go along with Menaphos would be pretty sweet.
---
&gt;Now because everyone complains about everything... I cannot differentiate between the legitimate things to complain about to people just being fucking whingers.
---
Then use ur fucking brain lmao. You don't need to circle jerk the community on what's good and what's bad. Read the blogs and formulate your own thought for once.
---
Hello, yes hi, fuck you.
---
I dont understand, do you know how to read? I've said multiple times I dont condone cheating, and it sucks for Alarma. I'm trying to get Jagex to do something about their security.
---
I'm not saying alarms should get his account back or people who lost gp should. I'm saying jagex should step up their side to prevent this shit from spiraling out of control. Like using pin on trades. If they guy doesnt know pin then you dont trade them your valuables. It's a pretty small change. And like banks you'd only have to do it on login.
---
Also I said it seems, because I'm aware that it's also Alarms fault (have said this before) but that the scammer is at fault too. But you keep saying the scammer shouldn't be blamed. Like you are standing up for the scammer. Unless I'm super wrong here when I say "this person should also be blamed" and you respond with "no, not his fault only the other guy" it's like you are taking a stance for scammers, you can atleast see where I'm coming from here right?
---
Surprisingly, I did it in one sitting in an about two hours! People were friendly and no one left mid wave, I just made sure to get the points in my least favorite roll first and then do my favorite last.
---
I know it wouldn’t be a problem....I’m basically just have EoC ptsd.
---
Yes exactly and the account should be banned for rwt but to say your friend should be able to lock the account is stupid since he essentially hacked it. Imagine a system where hackers could lock accounts after the real account owner got them back
---
I forgot all about this too lol. It's been 8 years since I've checked. But on Rs3 :s
---
No it wouldn’t, because it’s not an issue on The WoW.  You just don’t know what you’re talking about
---
I don't think degrading jewelry should get eternal versions; instead, it should get something like the Suffering that condenses multiple into one.
---
On a related topic, one of my ideas for Warding as Compacted Jewelry where you take 10 Rings of Dueling and some Vis and use it to make an 80 charge Ring of Dueling; not quite the same as unlimited or Suffering style, but it would be an upgrade.
---
To claim that someone sold an account is now the hacker is your complete and inherent flaw. If you worked for an organization, sold your information to a third party for access, then went back on that sale claiming you were hacked, you would not only be liable but also at fault along with the individual buying the access.
---
Around the same time I was in someone’s house party also in arena and also got kicked out, and when I got kicked out the first option when right clicking everyone was ATTACK.  Unfortunately it just said I couldn’t do that there but I remember this was in the days after the massacre so I got super excited for a second.
---
Also pre eoc cash duplication glitch
---
Have you sailed to Kourend at least once?
---
Goblin deez nuts
---
But there is no transfer of ownership since there is no way to transfer ownership. I agree it is 100% a scam but your friend never had true ownership of the account which is why he is akin to a hacker in this situation since he was playing on an account he didn't own
---
Yep I figured that out quick last night
---
Oh nice I found it. That's convoluted af. Definitely not an option during setup iirc. Anyways. Thanks for this bit of information I will share with everyone I know
---
It's either laziness or efficiency, one of the two.

10gp this happened at wintertodt
---
Its true bro and its not a few its a lot.
---
lmao, I literally just did this, 10 seconds ago, just sampled one world, 1/4 the bots are over lvl 80, 1/4 are over 70 and the rest are 60+
---
There is way more spam in this world than free to play worlds bro.
---
I haven't seen someone use one in a while, surprised they are not gone
---
Support for sure
---
That’s awesome and impressive. but holy shit I didn’t realize how easyscape runelite or whatever she was using is. How do most of you not get bored playing like that?
---
No, I don't have a tbow, I don't care if it becomes dirt cheap, actually it would be really good for me to get the tbow for free, but I don't want to rebuild
---
Say the same to drew g.
---
If your dealer isn’t constantly busy with something unimportant is he really your dealer?
---
Everythings fking laging bro.
---
That's everyday for me, I play on multiple accounts and for whatever reason every one of them require the code again
---
Holy shit can we get to morytania already the crossover is going to be epic
---
I have indeed. When i open the quest up the "100 Kudos" part is not crossed through.
---
Buying gf 10gp
---
As I said I removed my tip jar one month straight, I would love to see drew do that.
---
The transfer of ownership isn't the issue, the whole system to support such a scheme is, which is what we are trying to show. This individual clearly has done it in the past, and will continue to do it until someone notices. Your stuck on a moot point.
---
Can we have the red part, be black as well. 
---
Triple Black graceful plz
---
Are you actually mentally handicapped?
---
Even better, quest requires bones to peaches
---
Lvl 93 warding and this bad boy will be yours!
---
Gratz, shame it didn’t come with a nature rune and a few fires.
---
Only if they were blue eyed blond hair tweens
---
Let’s not forget it happened on 6/6/06
---

---
Log in, open the character tab (face with a gear icon), "open store"
---
Unless you buy a redeemable card from a convenient store.
---
Bloodworm or crypt rat plz
---
Look, I totally agree with some of the points the OP makes, I'm also generally sympathetic towards people who get screwed over due to the failures of Jagex. That happens quite often. Also, often times it's the players fault due to them being lazy, negligent etc. And in those cases that sucks and I feel bad for people who lose items due to those reasons even if it's their mistakes.
---
However, this isn't what this thread is about.  The thread here focuses entirely on one annecdote where someone knowingly buys and account, knowingly uses that account as a ranked member of a popular CC, takes loans on it regularly enough to where members do not question him asking for loans.
---
 You want to make a thread about Jagex failures, don't bring in a story based on one dudes CLEAR choices and consequences of them. It hurts really any credibility you might have. A few points sure I'd agree with if you werent basing these off the events you describe. Bad choices have consequences, as does getting involved with sketchy af people. Which is what "time" chose to do. This thread is a really damn great example of why you should never buy accounts, it's a really bad example of how jagex support sucks.
---
Giveing 1gp for anyone who votes yes to warding!
---
Wait so have you completed the Digsite quest?
---
Wouldn't an eternal ring of recoil make fight caves doable for a level 3 with tick eating and recoils?
---
this is the quality shit that i want to see on this sub.
---
yeh suffering
---
There’s Casual BA, havent used it personally but could try it out
---
slayer rings are degradable lmfao
---
Bgs is the budget alternative
---
i mean we already have ZMI runner buying RC for 190k XP/H, nothing will ever beat that.
---
dry? wtf you have 5 claws stop fucking around
---
If you up for helping people do Jad I wouldn't mind help. I got wrecked by him twice now and kinda gave up lol. Pm me your disc name if you want.
---
barely dry stop crying
---
dude just get the drop
---
After 415 years of playing*
---
Funny how every easyscape suggestion is labelled quality of life
---
Can't get your point across? 3rd grade education? Just type Rs3!
---
Here she goes again
---
Does ur dad know about this
---
Yeah I tried that but im only getting subscriptions, no bonds
---
More player mods.
---
heck yea
---
Saw them for the last Warped Tour. Amazing performance!
---
Yes, and what I said can apply to them too. Though I did mean more of the gemstone degrading items and that was pretty obvious. If you add an Eternal version of the Emerald items, that would not be good for Emeralds. Same goes for any other gem that is currently being sunk with degrade to dust jewelry and even gold bars too.
---
Would highly recommend binging his old videos. Even though hes said he will never go back to his "according to j1mmy" series it's still one of my favourite runescape series of all time. Not enough people realise how talented this guy is
---
ScottsTot01#3707
---
Have jagex said any plans on raids 3? I know jagex is planning on making varlamore, a region south of kebos lowlands. I also recall them saying they will  make a hunting guild (similar to the farming guild). But idk about any future raids
---
I’d love the excitement of this, XP Rates/resources wouldn’t even have to be that much better for me to get enjoyment out of it. Full support.
---
J1m shows up at the Theate of Blood to duel Swampletics. He is the final boss.
---
Ffs she just got released.
---
Free my Bwana G-ma.
---
For every p hat I eat I donate a t bow to a youngster in need.
---
Conspiracy theory: jagex doesn't ban scammers because people who get scammed buy bonds to get their money back.
---
Yet I'm still getting down voted
---
A lot of those bots can Change the max rolls to be like 70 instead of 100 so your chances of losing are twice that of winning.
---
Let’s buff range more pls
---
What’s your gear/method? I’ve just been using blowpipe and my times are like 1:30 iirc. Maxed with rigour as well
---
Long term yes but with only 160m ish bank not worth it yet
---
How was OP supposed to know that? If it worked, this would be cool. It was a good idea. Don't be a dick.
---
Alch yourself
---
If you don't mind me asking, who was your friend that passed? Reason I'm asking is because this is the exact situation that just happened to a very close friend of mine, and I'm wondering if he was a mutual friend of ours. He wasn't the first of his friend group to pass due to an OD, either. He was also engaged. Either it's a crazy coincidence, or this world is smaller than I thought it was.
---
Either way, feel free to reach out to me either through here or Runescape. My RSN is Bad Dub.
---
That looks great though
---
Max melee. I tried range and it’s way worse
---
You fucking cunt, I knew when I posted mine someone was going to repost and get more upvotes
---
Not really, since you get to seers course by the time you have full graceful and then you dont even lose run energy there
---
Okay, what makes it not good?
---
🦀 🦀🦀🦀🦀$11🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Alt + f4 will fix your problem
---
Do you not have access to a computer? And if not how are you planning to do any of this? I am mainly confused how you can't open your email from a computer
---
Hmm, still think a quest would be better then having a conversation
---
Imagine making them instead of buying them.
---
Imagine being so poor that you'd save a few gp and go through your house instead of just clicking through your inventory.
---
The tbow doesnt even really affect time, bp is way more dps than tbow and tbow is only good for jad and mages and even in my experience ive done better dps with bp on the mages (tbow definitely best for jad though)
---
Second and third tiles in the first column are incorrect
---
Dude dont fuck with me I'm do high for that lol I almost did it until I remembered what it did haha
---
Do you even pk??????
---
They added Skilling catalysts to rs3 and it went over really badly from what Ive heard.
---
Probably wanna look for a jailbreaking subreddit not the osrs sub for this my dude.
---
Shit imma have to re do it all but thanks yo
---
Browny1990 is the real virgin, confirmed.
---
Underground pass along with legends quest cave feel very unchanged and still look very similar to the RSC equivalent area.
---
The max cash on every pvp kill would be absolutely the worst one had it not been rolled back. The economy for the entire game would be 100% fucked for everyone rather than just a few people dieing in Falador on one world.
---
Download runelite
---
Also got 2 solo olmlets every solo raid drop minus tbow, over 5k zulrah kc 
---
I'm flexing hard
---
Cant get it to download on linux
---
since being an ironman was my hobby before I did cosplay he's in favor because at least this one gets me out of the basement
---
just take full set for switch.
---
Why are you on Linux? Genuine question
---
What can I do to Ash with level 99 fapping?
---
It IS impressive
---
You'd actually cause some prices to tank briefly as you dump this haha
---
#Gz #On #1 #KC #Pet
---
Does anyone remember the YouTube video if the falador massacre recreated in Halo 3? It was just a dumb funny video but I've been trying to find it again for years and never have been able to, I assume it's been taken down but even in archives and stuff I can't find it anywhere :(
---
Hence the "if you dont have better gear" part. :)
---
Is a hasta better than a tent whip at bandos? Also when killing zammy, is it better to bgs spec or archlight spec?
---
Not knowing sarcastic response template in 2019 lol
---
I agree with this. Only had 100m when I bought for 70m bank is now over 200m. The gp will come back
---
Cons: Would make group point boosting wildly fast
---
 I met with the president of the Virgin Islands
---
oh true. But torso is free and obby/dragon legs are cheaper than guthans and will do better. my bad though, read your comment too quickly
---
Ur so adorable
---
Is it? I genuinely just gyazo’d this while at the g.e could you please show me the original post?
---
Chefs get money youtubers get peanuts
---
Damn dude change all your info and set up 2fa on email and osrs and start to rebuild. At least you'll get your stats up more. But that sucks
---
No worries man:p.
---
You missed a shot to get Kurt Angle in this post!
---
This is an awful idea. Takes next to no effort to either report/block them or just filter your game chat
---
If he's going in balls deep and putting in as much dps as he can that's even more hardcore than if a 126 were to do the same, although I suppose a lvl 87 account is a lower risk than a 126 account.
---
C
---
Omg I think I met him around those days at PC. Coppied that look for a while!
---
they mentioned this and said they don't like having many eternal stuff
---
Wish I could get access to a TBow :( would love to take a crack at the inferno
---
New cave system. The under-underground pass
---
I dont think they say this to flex, its more of a this took this long to do hence why this content took this long to come out and if this video is inflated with likes it may be worth investing more time into similar content.
---
Ugh there goes the ring of 3rd ages main purpose... (Not the glitch, just being able to hide in PVP like you can do with the Ring of Stone at Rune rocks).
---
The only message in chat is an advertisement for a gold selling site? Lol blatant advertisement on a reddit post.
---
Top tier meme, have my ash vote
---
is it more or less likely to be hacked if you use your username as login? and with a previous name change?
---
Yeah sorry that's what I meant, I was 73 agility at like 81 fishing as well and getting 99 fishing got me 45k from 80 agil
---
but they increased the magic defence stat to compensate.
---
Had it put on a computer just cuz even tho I dont use the computer but now that I'm playing rs again well the computer is there either the linux or my phone
---
