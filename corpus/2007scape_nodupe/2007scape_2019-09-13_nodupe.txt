Literally nothing? lmao

Lol. Every host claims, "I just do it for the fun! :-)" Yet when people start going to others' houses, they make less money and they whine. Cry me a river.
---
Good, because looking at the price difference between msb and the next best bow is ridiculous.

A few days ago after my main ran out of membership, while I was fishing by Barbarian Village (for food as I am afk combat training Stronghold of Security Giant Spiders), someone in full Dragon Armor (including Dragon full helm) stopped by in f2p for a few minutes before leaving.
---
What do you need done to unlock fossil crabs?
---
Ideal is skeleton, large spider, bloodworm but it's not worth the spider. Just do double skeleton bloodworm
---
Newly back to 07scape been playing for a few days now, looking for some friends and or some one to help teach me the ways and help me learn more and more about the game

Dont be silly , youre not talking to girls

I’ve never gotten so many comments on a post before lmfao
---
Nice
---
Relatable
---
You can cancel it by card number on runescape website I believe

Thanks, I guess I did not find that news post when I was trying to catch up on the subject.

I was designing my own replacement for the shop too. Nice to see that other people see the same issue as me. Nice.

&gt;  I hate when people on this subreddit insinuate 30 hours a week is an attainable amount of playtime for the average player.
---
Jagex showed playtime stats before, the average player is 30-35 hrs of playtime/week.
---
88 is max runes I think, try to get it but don't stress too much if you get sightly more than this
---
Affordability shouldn’t just throw out options, it’s not hard to make enough in a weeks time to afford any armor in the game. What you are willing to lose does not change the fact that other options exist.

Whatever history books you read are pretty flawed because Europe was at its height in the 19th and early 20th century, well into capitalism. The 16th century was a relatively weak time especially in the east. 
---
The problem is that capitalism isn't tempered by a strong Western culture, ever since ww1 we've been on a cultural decline.
---
this is pretty cool, did you make this?

Check out Teaks, 99 all 10hp and has a fire cape.

Good roast, but unfortunately I’m a chinook helicopter crew chief instead, it’s a lot of action and fast paced instances where you really have to think on the spot, that’s why I couldn’t stand a job like this.
---
There's one that lowers combat stats, which I guess wouldn't be an issue if you're using overloads. Personally I wouldn't enable them though
---
Probably yeah

avg 85 herbs and 30 limpwurts per run is 661k money, which is about 250k profit. Nice, never really checked tbh.

Is there any way to make it so I don’t have to hold in chat box to private message a friend? Very annoying on mobile and I’m blind and can’t find an option if it exists

Aside from the extra strength bonus given when using full Obsidian (w/ maul), seems very slow compared to a whip/abby dagger when in nmz. Thoughts? Going for xp and points

Or you can just fucking make it

Double imps will definitely be in

If you're not planning to afk then I think they're fine
---
Don't remember exactly how the fights went, maybe do a practice run for free with just those bosses first
---
Woah dude wtf
---
Yep

I mean. There is already an optimal quest guide on the wiki. It would probably just display those in game, there wouldn’t be an algorithm to make it more "efficient"
---
A
---
&gt;  or the UK Parliament's problem  
---
  
---
It's a question of regulation. Current laws don't consider this form of gambling to be gambling, i.e. it's outside the government's jurisdiction. It means things like casinos play by one set of rules while in-game gambling plays by no rules. Many governments are debating this as we speak, if this gambling should be within the scope of existing agencies to regulate and sanction as necessary.
---
People don't choose their prescription, they do choose the video games they play. Blame shitty medical practices instead of lumping all addiction together like it's the same.
---
It's a good bankstanding account but beyond that you can't do much but skill and cannon slayer.
---
You can ask questions on these threads, they are pretty active
---
If you want to find a cc, you can find them on the osrs forums or join a streamer/youtuber's cc.

Did you play osrs previously? How long ago and how far was/is your account?

Still not thousands, but the wealth for a maxed house does take hundreds of hours

Probably rune drags would be good, get lance and some barrows gear and you're ready
---
It literally took me about 5 minutes to make it, just did this quest the other day.
---
Good wdr discord (we do raids). They do learner raids regularly for this exact purpose.
---
Why should that mean every game has to cater to them? There are plenty of people who like gambling and know where to draw the line. Those people shouldn't have their experience taken away just because some other people have no self control.
---
2k total on one is impressive, yes. 
---
It's almost certainly not an iron, given the prayer virtual level. 
---
Defense is from cannoning organized crime on zeah. It's honestly not too bad of a rate.
---
Its honestly funny to me. Ive never donated to anyone hosting. They have 90+ construction and a huge house, they clearly have enough money as it is. 
---
My broke ass is just using you for faster exp, not gonna lie
---
I think many if not all bank chests can get randoms, I know the konar bank and giant seaweed island banks can at least.
---
It's not really a loop. Just think about what people could do with free memberships and what that might do to those items.
---
I always used his house as well when I need to change spell books. Never really cared to chat, just ran in and changed books and teled out.

5k gold ore was pretty obvious sarcasm buddy...

They are trying to phish active players, not bring in new players to the game.

Jesus I can't even tell what's a meme and what's actually in the game...
---
Eternal Slayer ring? What is that??
---
And why does it have to be eternal? When mounting you always get unlimited charges.. cuz lore?
---
This would cause so many problems.
---
People would have the opposite of canadian standoffs, where they stand there by the closed doors waiting for someone else to open them.
---
And there's a very possible side effect of people making bots to keep the doors open, so on another account they can maintain activity simply by closing the doors.
---

Or he thought he had prot melee on?
---
nice
---
I'm out of the loop here, can anyone explain?
---
No, it's weird for sure. As a casual player I get snapdragons and stuff all the time, yet I've only ever gotten one ranarr seed
---
It doesn't but maybe if it did people would close the god damn doors
---
With QPC and base 70 stats, what is my best money option? I sold my bank for sote reqs and now I'm flat broke. I started doing Zalcano but it's really hard to find an open world. Is there a cc or something?
---
There's been a lot of quests added since Slayer, I don't know how many of them involve Slayer xp.
---
You get Slayer xp for a lot of random shit that doesn't involve slaying, so it was just a question. I wasn't assuming he had all of it from quests only either, sorry to trigger you Sir King of RuneScape.

Not really

As a canadian I can confirm that Canadian stand offs take quite a bit of time to overcome

5k is nothing, dude. I make like 3 mil/hour at vork.
---
100 kudos? I'd rather train rc.
---
Should be 48 right now
---
How did you do slayer without getting combat xp?
---
Why. Its not ‘screwing them over for no reason’  the shop is over powered and is cheesy. Why is the best way to get gold buying it from an npc rather than gathering of receving it as a drop.  
---
In my book UIM’s signed up for a harder experiance so if they suddenly cant buy 99 smithing from an Npc i couldnt care less.
---
Why are you guys getting involved/concerned with a fucking streamers real life relationship lmao
---
Is that Velma?
---
I run chat on friends. Some dude followed me today while I was kinda afk on mobile...
---
I never care enough to actually see what the noobs want. I'm probably gonna get banned one of these days just cuz I don't reply.
---
Wait what? I said I lost my dds, not the scim. The runes were inside the rune pouch. All the other runes I lost (death runes were the bulk of the loss). The Torags probably dropped since I had few empty spaces. I also think I kept dhide top but I'd have to check. I have a bank tab with all my loot and there you'll find a Karil helm, Verac helm, and that's all. If I go find the collection log I'm 100% sure it will show the Torags. 
---
I really appreciate the tips (haven't fully read them yet, was already in bed), but I'm actually struggling with Barrows. Here are my main issues if you care:
---
* My runs take a minimum of 6 and a half minutes which I believe is a lot (includes going to Clan Wars and restocking)
---
* I prayer flick on all brothers and still have to prayer pot because I can never kill a brother before I get drained. (43 prayer) Each prayer pot is 2k down the drain. 
---
* I get hit with 10s consistently by Skeletons, which in turn make me eat (sharks are 700gp, although a really cool dude in this thread gave me some high healing potatoes which are like 360gp) or pray and pot
---
* I take too long underground (prayer goes to 0 way too fast...what do I do now? Repot only when the last brother spawns? That means I'll get smacked by skellys... Repot earlier? That means another 2k down the drain...
---
* I can't seem to kill Skeletons faster with melee (dscim and dds spec); MSB (i) seems faster? Everyone says take dscim and dds tho...
---
Just a few things off the top of my head. I really have no reason to lie and I'll probably try to recreate what happened tomorrow and get it on video. I swear to God I did nothing wrong. I died, went back in as fast as I could, and nothing. Never changed worlds. Didn't take more than 5 minutes. Idk man...
---
You can get an eternal gem (I think it's called) drop from superior slayer monsters (unlockable - big versions of existing monsters that have a chance of spawning on task) or buy on the g.e. which can then be used instead of a regular slayer gem to craft an eternal slayer ring, which is exactly the same except infinite teleports.

House host advertising drama is what I live for.

Wondering if they will crack down on people that still just setup auto-typers.

Where am I looking exactly?

Can you point to it?

shout out to u/Sir_Suh_Dude for making this on twitter
---
I've used your house before so thanks for tbat- but your comments here are pretty offputting
---
Nah jagex got a hold of a bunch of scripts. Gg botfarms.
---
I cant remember where I did but I know we got married at the Zamorsk church in southern Varrock. Lemon502s579, if you're out there, Ma Chao50 still remembers you &lt;3
---
Tbh jagex should be able to charge what it wants when it wants. The market will determine if the players want it. For example, they could charge $50/mo for members, but most people would quit and they'd lose revenue. Really this should not be blamed on Jagex. I agree MTX ruins games, but there should not be a law against it. This is on the individual and/or the parents.
---
Yes exactly!
---
Its not a bot
---
That’s just someone splashing...
---
Not sleepy anymore so I read your tips. The full rune is interesting. Is proselyte also viable in that case? My main issue now is managing prayer cause I can't kill them before getting prayer drained. 
---
As for this being my main money source, I'm torn. Not sure if I should keep at it or if I should go NMZ train until 70s... 
---
In between all this I'm almost done with RFD which is something I've wanted for more than a decade and never managed lol.
---
I guess, depends on your pure but you should have most quests done that give kudos.
---
It was ddp ddp+ and dds
---
P+ was weapon poison(+)
---
S was super weapon poison, which got changed to weapon poison (++), but it was in the game long enough that everyone still calls it a dds instead of a ddp++
---
Prayer is already broken??? What are you on about?
---
Lynx Titan’s chair before being packaged and shipped to the Varrock museum.
---
Upper can support like 8 people mining different sections without issues. If someone started a vein before you're giving up afk time, with a 50/50 chance they rob the last paydirt.
---
I guess Jagex can't afford the increased cost of adding more redundancy to their servers.
---
Then at least add some punishment; make it like Runescape 3 where you have to pay 15% of all the items you lost.
---
Guy in my cc wasnt able to buy one for 650 in the GE the other day. Unless it fell to just 300 overnight (highly doubt), u got screwed on a low sell
---
Not if you want your house optimal all round. Multiple portal rooms around your entrance portal limits other uses. Having every available portal at the closest spot to your entrance portal is optimal.
---
Is this seriously a screen shot of a text file?
---
Good thing BIS for all three combat styles will set you back maybe 150k total.

oh shit, forgot about prif. Its my respawn point, and the only reason I ever go there is when I die.

This must be a freak chance? No way they are that low.

I never heard of the staff before and I just finished like 10K alches!!! What’s the purpose of the tome of fire?

Actually

Mayne hit doesnt know theres a tip jar? Youre reading too far into this anyway

Reason #1 why you dont panic sell items at low prices
---
Disclaimer: This isn't me, friend posted on a TOB discord I'm in
---
Creating another incentive to buy the gem would add to the item sink.
---
Same stuff different video
---
Protest what though? A useful update for everyone except hosts wanting to monopolise tips?
---
Wait so you just tank the basement?? 
---
I take like three sips to a full pot on a bad run. 
---
A good run for me is like this: after Dharok I'm usually 33 prayer. Then at Guthans I'll leave with 20ish. After Kharil I'm at zero. One sip gets me through Torag and another through Verac (he hits hard). Then another sip for Ahrim basement, for instance (side note: does everyone else run around with 0 prayer in basement doing kill count, and just pot when the brothers spawn?).
---
PvP is dead anyways
---
This changes everything guys
---
Free fire runes
---
If we're talking efficiency gp is more or less considered 0 time because of altscape and merching.
---
Gilded Altar, nexus, occult altar, jewellery box, lectern is like... 20-30m total? You spend less than 150m all up for a host worthy house.
---
Ok brainlet
---
If they have to brew, yes. But there are many situations where you're attacking another pvper and especially pvmers where you don't need to brew right away.
---
“Have a good one bud” is a basically a fuck you man you’re not worth the time. Have fun at sub 1000 total and no skill. Have a good one. You’re the try hard
---
I don't understand that second part
---
I dont like botted stuff either but...fast smithing is fast smithing. Im not paying more for an essentially useless skill
---
There are many situations where you're attacking another pker and especially pvmers where you don't need to brew right away.
---
I’d recommend to set recipe for disaster quest as a mid-long term goal, since it will force you to get decent skills, plus one of the best gloves in the game
---
Yeah fk off with repost
---
Lol good let them protest I’ll sneak in there and host at my max house that never gains traction because they each have 5 bots spamming ads outside the portal. They can fuck off
---
It's still about flexing. They didn't grow out of it. As someone who plays mainly F2P, go check out the F2P trade world right now and count up to like 7 members going "F2P is the cancer of Runescape" because that seems to be going on every time I head to the GE.
---
good

I purchased one 10 minutes ago for 540m. They are not 700m+ anymore.

Who?

uhh no
---
I’m kind of out of the loop here. Can anyone fill me in on what’s going on?
---
He did it on purpose
---
I have. I just worked 2 jobs. Not sure why it getting butthurt about this. Its entitled to expect extra money for doing ur bare minimum job. The problem is with the company's/industry itself not with the costomer as they're are paying well enough to cover minimum wage for a server salary. Be butthurt all you want 🤷
---
And your right it's not entitled to want to live on ur wages but it is entitled to think someone is gana give u extra for a job that takes no skill.  Hence why I worked 2 jobs.
---
nah just donations most likely
---
A Friend pulling stupid shit for drama and publicity isn't anything new, dude. At this point it's to be expected.
---
Quest cape
---
Thanks for your really clear explanation. But why in hell would they raise the magic defence then? What is their idea behind it?
---
Nope
---
Tome only consumes for combat spells
---
So because it’s impossible to stop ddos attacks players should
---
Be punished?  You obviously were not playing when the servers were hit every minute, or when people would log around armadyl/bandos and hit the world so you would die and they could take your shit.
---
I'm not sure if I want this because it would drastically change the pking meta and would potentially limit diversity, but I think weapons like Ghrazi rapier and Blade of saeldor should have a spec as they're already very niche and this would help push them. Even if its just something like a whip spec/something terrible I think people undermine how important a spec bar can do for a weapon's usage for at least pking/pvp.
---
\&gt; While I've never been hacked and partly believe that most of the people hacked definitely contributed to their hacking, I do think Jagex security is way too fucking lax. 
---
Agreed.  I do believe most hackings are at least partially due to lack of diligence from the player, but there is evidence that 
---
a) there are exceptions
---
b) Jagex is below industry standards on this
---
How much is it now?
---
You cant hold a staff of fire if you are holding the nature rune staff
---
So then you hold the tome of fire in your offhand for infinite fire runes (you only need the tome and one burt page to to do infinite fire runes)
---
I kinda miss the worlds being more full and alive
---
Ive got a friend who has been hosting for awhile, and he tells me all the shady shit that goes on in w330.Was  constantly harassed by some dude named johno.
---
Am I against ads geared towards kids? No. Advertising has always, at least in my 25 years of life, been that way and I don't see a problem with it.
---
Am I against laws requiring casinos to promote resources for gambling addiction? That's an interesting one. Haven't really thought about that before. I guess I could call gambling a disease. Which means I would like to see casinos and other sources of gambling be required to put resources towards helping addicts, just like I'd like to see opioid manufacturers held responsible for an addiction they knew they were creating.
---
That being said, that's not what this post is about. It specifically address money used towards "in-game progression and wealth". Not loot boxes. I'm fine if a player is spending money on a specific item or progression, but if they are gambling money for the *chance* at an item I'd have to be against that.
---
Damn, I wish I knew about this. Shame it was a bit exploity with runelite features.
---
I’m indifferent but I’m assuming for the government it’s a them problem because if you have citizens gambling themselves into debt they probably aren’t paying taxes and/or are eating up social services.. I’d guess the government regulations on gambling is more to protect themselves than any individual person 🤔😅
---
You know how easy it is to steal out of a purse?  There are far more barriers to going to a physical location than stealing from your parents.
---
Ah we have another who remembers *exactly* what happened. It was sad, really, streamers and players lost hundreds of mills
---
Client that tells you what click to make next
---
wow and no tails which is its worst priced unique drop. good rng guy
---
Herbi is more of a skilling pet because to my knowledge there’s no way to get consistent xp from Herbi without getting kill count and you get the pet drop when you complete Herbi. Wintertodt you get the Phoenix when you open the crate which, potentially, could never happen because you can get 99 firemaking without opening a single crate.
---
:(
---
&gt; This is on the individual and/or the parents.
---
my comment was specifically responding to this
---
however 
---
&gt;going after Jagex should be at the bottom of your list of priorities
---
no one is specifically going after jagex, people are going after predatory MTX in general, of which jagex is a part of and would be subject to any regulation of them
---
Gl, I never got mine lol. Did get farming pet at 56 though, and kbd pet at 209kc
---
You'll either get the trophy or you won't
---
I believe he actually addressed it. It would go to the last person to hit him I believe.
---
yeah the 270 slayer exp was huge -.-
---
How about shut the fuck up and try pvp
---
Sounds nice, I’d vote yes anyway if irons wanted it but I’m just going to afk mother load anyway for whatever miming level I’m gunna get.
---
Its actually 3 tick on the rapid style.
---
Ultimately you're doing the same movement, just at a different distance, so there's no change in difficulty. Blowpipe is slightly better dps iirc
---
But they don't
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Kinda getting sick of the bonemeal machines. Great post though.
---
Get swamped with damage
---
Both are pretty simple but dhcb is less clicks because of the speed of the weapon.
---
For bp darts either Rune or addy depends How much gpyou want to spend.
---
I got a 1/250k Rocky from a MLM rock.
---
99 con
---
isnt that tax evasion
---
Plug your stats and both gear setups in a dps calc . It depends on your weapon and range level.
---
Yeah, the other guy who posted it
---
I’m one of those assholes that spam opens them on purpose to troll. 
---
Hehe xD
---
Yikes.
---
If I remember some kid posted a while ago about making upwards of 20k and asked for advice for taxes on a financial sub reddit and everyone told him to file it in his tax return.
---
Going pooping
---
Very nice! Congrats!
---
Isn’t the point of having an Ironman to go solo? Wouldn’t group Ironman completely defeat the purpose of what Ironman is supposed to be?
---
I'm still confused at why the uncharged version is so downplayed. 
---
It looks like it uncharged it has the highest DPS against low def monsters. 
---
Seems like a great slayer weapon.
---
Ok might as well nerf tbow then? You're argument makes no sense, they nerfed serp because neitz 2 helm is coming out, whereas BP has no replacement.
---
Me too
---
I feel like on those monsters you would use slayer helms? Also nezzy is getting an upgrade at the end of the month.
---
honestly i'm just impressed that bot exists
---
Only if it's a complete restart....  
---
Not just MTX, the game data has been destroyed with soooo many people buying xp, double xp weekends etc it's hard to play catchup at this point.
---
I cant help but to feel, no I cant help but feel an exchanging of blows. What a beautiful spinner! What a beautiful spinner said the dharoks to the zerker, but oh just what a shame, the whole lander filled with whores.
---
Have you ever written any kind of script? Writing a script that goes from level 3 to zulrah takes less than 2 weeks. That includes the time it takes to train the account while you write the script. Add on another 20 hours for bug fixes down the road and you’re far below even 200 hours. If you’re a proficient coder 100hs. 
---
Also it’s not the same script being passed around because the big gold farmers have their own clients. OSB/RSPeer/Dream/Runemate/Tribot are detected.
---
I like to walk around with an untrimmed farming cape.
---
Funniest part is most the time I get asked
---
“Wow what cape is that”
---
So... they just think it looks cool... and nothing to do with spending weeks getting an untrimmed skill they could be training...
---
You don't have to tip house hosts. It's a courtesy more than anything.
---
If you do not make an Im, transfer rates are really good atm, this can help you skip the early grind. Questing is very important.
---
Defaulting to the assumption that most people use alts is certainly not the proper metric either. When I say average, I mean 1 account trying to progress through the common goals of the game. Quests, diaries, 99s etc. I'd guess I've got at least a few hundred hours in the game. 1 99, quite a few in the 80s, almost a quest Cape, quite a few minigames I'll never have to touch again. I would say I'm a pretty average player and I've tried my hand at merching. I'm nowhere near that kind of a cash stack
---
This is all about adult gating games with mtx
---
It has nothing to do with getting rid of them
---
Wintertodt was dank until they did the rework. Now it's mid tops.
---
That is true. If training slayer, this might not be worth it. And nezzy's bonuses will be underwhelming IMO. +1 strength bonus doesn't do much in terms of DPS when considering how much strength you already have. I'll make another post on this later on.
---
What your versing does drastically matter, what are you on about?
---
1.2m while skilling? Zulrah and high level RC are probably the only skilling methods in that ballpark. I usually average around 1.5m at Zulrah (75 mining and d pick). Wrath Runes and Double Wraths/Nats are also in the 1.2m area.
---
Generally speaking, skilling is less gp/hr, because there is usually less risk associated. 1.2m/hr is REALLY good for skilling, and only high level bossing/raids tends to be better than that

OSRS *IS* old enough to drive, without a license. How? Slap a "farm use only" tag on the plate and call it a day. Pay less in taxes on it, too. (At least where I call home, anyways.)
---
And if you're going by the release date of RSC, it's 20 this year. If you aren't licensed by that point, what are you waiting on?
---
Berzeker neck also reduces the accuracy, not increasing.
---
Slayer helm is just really good
---
That's why a lot of ppl reccomend to train combat witb slayer. 15% damage means more xp too.
---
Yikes ma dude. It is about learning not about doing perfect because your client tells you to.
---
If more than 1 person mines a vein only the person who gets the last ore will immediately stop the mining animation. The others will continue the animation for quite some time while not actually mining because the vein is depleted. This is why I prefer to take my own veins.

I am not a fan of rs3, but rs3 has the superior death mechanic

You're right, i should've caught that. However the DPS still remains the same.

Yup, bodies. It doesn't take too long to alch them afterwards which is better profit then the GE. You could also sell them on W308 Anvil CC after you're done crafting if you just wanna dump them. They have a set selling price for 7.8k roughly?

lol. there was a mini quest I did recently that slayermusiq hasn't made a guide to yet, so I had to go looking for another guide. Three choices to choose from, one of them having a really weird accent. I went with the one with the weird accent because that's what I was used to.
---
“I want to restrict my stats so I can have a DPS advantage over mains who are in my combat bracket!!”
---
“I also want to be able to more easily fight those above my combat bracket who have maxed accounts because I put this restriction on myself!!”
---
Stop being a choosing beggar, holy shit.  Also, good luck having the OSRS player base receive suggestions for fundamental changes (nerfs) in the way the large majority of players play their accounts (mains who participate mainly in PvM content). Even if this is solely for the wilderness, this is an outrageous complaint/suggestion.
---
Its a good set to utilize, nothing wrong with that, before you can afford bandos chest plate torso is what everyone uses, its the same concept, almost everyone and their mothers has a torso, or you have your moms credit card and can skip the torso, its just how things are.

Oh yeh definitely. 99 con is much more expensive than what we are talking. You only really need 84 for a maxed house I believe. That gives altar, occult altar, lectern(s) (not sure on level for new combined one), nexus and jewellery box.

That's pretty much everything a hosted house needs. Anything past there is non useful stuff.

If you’re a pure and you sacrifice your defense for DPS you don’t get to bitch about not having the added benefits of defense. That’s what a glass cannon account in any RPG is. Get over yourself.

Because they don't change drop rates and things change in value

Oh man I remember those days lmao

Nope, not I

Not really true, we got bosses like Vorkath, Zulrah, Wildy bosses, raids etc
---
These are much harder than the standard bosses like kbd and mole that a lot of people did back in the day
---
It’s also a bit biased to take that from OG players since they’re going to be better at the game anyway and be more likely to find content easier than most people
---
There have been a lot of QoL updates that have made the game easier in certain aspects, and things like NMZ have made combat training insanely efficient and afk which maybe be what people refer to as making the game easyscape

200m to max, maybe you could look at certain skills to train and give money at the same time.
---
I.e. Instead of doing battlestaffs at 300kexpand costs 3mil/hr. You could do diamond bracelets. 
---
3hrs. Same exp. You make 300-400k profit, and saves 3mil. So that’s 3.5mil for an extra 2hrs which is 1.75mil/hr. 
---
That’s just a terrible example. Instead of doing tree runs for farming. Do snapegrass allotments. With a herb and limpwurt runs.
---
In no universe are gargoyles 1m an hour. Even the wiki has it at 340k an hour assuming you hit drop rates perfectly at 90 kills an hour. And 120% of that is about 400k.

Upon release, the Wintertodt's table was much more profitable and was changed several days after release. The Wintertodt's drop table was soon nerfed yet again due to player feedback on its still-generous reward table, primarily in seeds such as ranarr (the increased supply of which resulted in them crashing very fast). The new drops became based on the player's levels in the skills the items were related to... That's pulled from the Wikia

im pretty interested in the new group ironman mode series with evscape and skidler.

So you're saying one set of gear has ruined the freedom of expression MMOs offer, but then one of your point also states that armour is a real thing, assuming you're talking literal here, have you ever seen in real life armour? It's not rainbow coloured, it has no "freedom of expression", it's built around EFFICIENCY. Light but strong materials, to give as much protection as possible whilst not hindering the person wearing it. Putting that stupid argument aside though, you're going on as if graceful is the only instance of such thing
---
If you want strength armour you wear what?
---
If you want defensive armour you wear what?
---
If you want magic armour you wear what?
---
If you want range armour you wear what? 
---
If you want skilling armour you wear what?
---
There is no freedom of expression in any instance, you use the best thing available to you, with the money you have to afford them. You don't think "Oh I'm fed up of wearing bandos and having maxed strength bonus, how about I wear some rock-shell platelegs with a rune chainbody and a dragon med and a mithril kiteshield and some warrior boots and 420 team cape and a Fremennik blade" to give off your freedom of expression, do you?

Anyone who starts mining at MMM with their combat gear on. That right there’s a bot.

I mean viewing things in third person would probably be the least super-hero like thing in the game. How about the infinite lives?

Ok that is actually funny af. Everything in the Australian dollar stores cost like 5 dollars

No they don’t.. people willingly give it to them.

That's awesome, congratulations! That's a great introduction in to the pvm combat in this game. Wear it proud.

Actually Japan's minimum wage is less than American minimum wage. At least where I live. I was making 6.94 an hour. Or 750yen an hour. Funny how people one Reddit always think they know things. Lol. People would rather downvote ion Reddit nstead of work hard and get a 2nd job. 🤷. Can smell the entitlement. It's not required to tip in america some places even force u to tip and add it to the bill.

It is a real post my english is bad sorry.

@jagex_wolf

&gt; graceful falls into the skilling activity
---
No it falls into the non-combat MOVEMENT activity. Going from the Varrock teleport to the GE? Graceful would be the best choice. Rune crafting? Graceful. Questing? graceful.
---
I don't have a problem with it being the best set for those activities! I have a problem with it making players cosmetically homogeneous.
---
You don't need to wear very few items. But wearing graceful is almost always better outside of combat. Why would you NOT want more run?
---
Wow did not know that was possible. 1900 cox wasted...

i got my dpick at my first ever boss task at 7 kc yesterday
---
Join the civilized world and give the restaurant staff a livable wage.

I'm confused. The wiki implies that it is still a very good weapon uncharged. Does it not have 3 hitsplats while uncharged? Or is it not free while uncharged?
---
Ill give it a try, thank you :)
---
I still don't know how that's legal
---
Free membership from mobile also ended
---
^both answers wrong, 7 day mobile trial is gone, bot farms can no longer farm 7 days for free and throw an account away. Tons of farms buying bonds all at once = big hike in bond price
---
An items value can fluctuate in value too, if better items get introduced or if the supply increases. 
---
I made the mistake of keeping my dragon harpoon that I bought for 7 mil when I took a break. When I returned it’s value has dropped to 400k ish,

Nah man it was legit harder to make money back then, there are ironmen now who are richer than some of the richer players back in the day.
---
I know, it's just superstition lol. Like statistically if I threw d20 dice and managed to roll 4 back to back Nat 20's it would stand to reason that I wouldn't get anymore for a good while. It's kind of like the gamblers fallacy where you are at the drop rate of something and haven't gotten it, when no matter how much you have tried at something the odds of getting it are always the same
---
You'd be surprised how much money people donate to people hosting
---
another case of slipping personal responsability out
---
frickin lefties
---
I'm joking, but for real though, I do find those 2 mentioned to be some of the most entertaining, most OSRS videomakers are pretty much just boring progress or pvp videos with not a lot of personality. Link and Rargh's pvp challenge series is good though.
---
So I play multiple accs and mlm is one of my afk ones while I rc/agility or something more focus-intense on the others. 
---
When I get xp from mining dirt I notice via the xp drops, so everytime I check to see if that xp drop depleted the vein, if someone else depletes it I dont get xp, so I dont notice. that is my personal reason for being a cunt at mlm upper area
---
If/when you go to America, don’t go to any restaurants. Just stay at the fast food joints. If you don’t feel the need to tip your server at a restaurant while in America, then you shouldn’t go to one. You’re not making any point to management or the owners by not tipping. All you’re doing is losing the server money because at most serving jobs in the United States, the hourly wage is generally just enough to cover taxes. So without tipping, the server nets $0 for serving your table. You’re essentially making the server work for free which is especially irritating if you’re a high maintenance table. I’m not saying go out and leave a huge tip, but if they provide good service, tip them accordingly. Even if they provide average service, that’s not grounds for not leaving a tip, that just means you tip a little less. I personally never tip under 20% because I’ve been in their shoes.

Glory is universally useful compared to the slay ring which just brings you to slayer locations (most of which can easily be accessed via fairy rings+ trees) + tarns liar.
---
Couldn't figure out why there were so many people on those two worlds and not in the one in the middle.  They're all in the same data center from what I could tell
---
its not a whale tho, its a dude digging himself down on debts
---
Go back to rs3 buddy. You don't know what you're saying.
---
That's because the glory tele is often used for quick banking for various skilling, being faster than teleporting to your house and then using the mounted glory.
---
This isn't really the case for the slayer ring.
---
Yeah, only see removed. Would love to see the post.
---
Exactly. You don't appreciate the 50/50 comment because it's funny. You appreciate it because it is tradition. OP is projecting if you ask me.
---
low iq blaming low iq consequences on banks not surprising
---
lending to morons isn't evil, morons are just bad to themselves and bad to ayone around them
---
The bots can’t buy any of the items except cosmetics and the free trial mobile thing just ended so you’ll see them go.
---
Awful.
---
I would sell everything except for your best mage/melee/range gear. And remember to load up your miscellania coffer.
---
its hardto say if they are more stupid than irresponsible

Thats better, i can see your remorse over the situation

Imagine getting 18M prayer xp between 3 accounts and not knowing that the wilderness altar is twice as cheap.

For all we know bonds are part of the “traditional subscription model”. Jagex likes to bend and alter the truth whenever it is convenient for them.

Im all for it, however, i think the poh is already pretty OP... who doesnt have at least 82/83 con dont know what their missing out

Rune Crossbow allows him to use ruby bolts which with their 100 damage proc gives him a DPS boost that might make the ToB possible.

We couldn't create sea worthy ships without the massive development during the end of the middle ages through the highly specialized workers. ANd the specialism is helped by guilds who pay for their members even in times of low work (specialism has a tendency to go with ups and downs).

I'm reeeaaally tempted to play again. Mostly for nostalgia's sake.

I'm more about skilling and PvM, is it viable to play OSRS? Mind you I'm more of a casual player, never reached 90s.
---
Played RS3 a while back, started anew - it was okay but... I don't know it didn't click with me. 
---
I didn't mind the combat system, armour I feel scales better (f2p at least). Lots of stuff I had no idea about (sprites and whatnot).

So much customisabilty in the UI that the menus are a HUGE clutter gave me a headache. The design and graphics feels a bit too childish for my taste. Of course being bombarded the promotions constantly isnt fun.

It seems like we are discussing semantics. You seem to define a pet to a category for different reasons than I do. I just go by jagex classifications and you don't. Which is fine. I understand your arguments, I just don't agree.
---
By requiring ID for large sums (&gt;100 euro, or larger than what is average spending limit for the last few years). But most importantly: having a pin so that it can only happen once.
---
And 1handed so you can wear a tank shield
---
If you believe in tree jesus hard enough. Jad will die by your hand.
---
I also believe in you.
---
Yea because a firecape with overheads at 41 is flexing in 2019😂
---
not even gilded smh
---
Prices are always gonna go up and down, sometimes more sometimes less. Selling AFTER it has gone down is generally a mistake.
---
And that's fine. I'm aware of why it's defined a boss pet and not a skill pet. I just think that definition is arguably semantics. It's a skilling method. They just didnt want to make a FM pet because that's a truly buyable skill. Same issue they had with wanting to add farming pet. It's technically a buyable skill, but feels more gatherer than production.
---
I also strongly think chin pet is the worst designed skilling pet. And why I think it doesn't really belong in the category. Hunter should have a pet that isn't limited to one training method.
---
It would be like if heron pet would only come from fishing Minnows or something.
---

Here's a link to the drive document. You can try it out yourself by making a copy of it.

Give it a go! OSRS is pretty simple compared to RS3. Skilling and PvM is main part in game.

Oh baby don’t say that, I’m sure you can make more money to keep this relationship going
---
Lol nope. Where have you heard this?
---
broad arrows are a little worse than addy fwiw
---
I think I agree with everything you said here.
---
Brutal blacks are pretty afk and some if the better money in the game. Gargoyles would be more afk but like a quarter of the money.
---
I just don't have time to play.

I work at a factory 60+ hours a week, plus edit videos.

Add them to new content. Lms currently has a reasonable amount of rewards, it's a minigame with 0 risk and you get points just for participating.
---
gz!
---
They failed because it was a PvP poll. We have seen this happen for years now, i don't know why anyone expects things to change. Jagex needs to do something though.
---
cuz its drastically more efficient to just purchase pre prepped supplies from bots with money made via killing things/merching/whatever than to actually interact with the skill.
---
Far easier and far less money
---
Well if I'd known the cards were so stacked...
---
And yeah you got me, the accounts two weeks old and I can't be bothered to do combat rn lmao
---
Or maybe people just think a risk free no requirement mini game that gives points to everyone who plays shouldn't have tons of rewards.
---
Serphelm btw
---
high alchemy is the reason we will continue to have massive inflation
---
Talk to genie or report
---
What they're trying to tell you is that the problem isn't worth graceful itself, but rather all the people who think it's necessary literally everywhere that isn't in combat, which isn't true at all.
---
Since it only helps you run longer down down to 0 kg, and only regenerates energy when you're standing still, you can usually choose to wear other things that look better and achieve the same effect.  People just don't because they don't know any better.
---
It's good for runecrafting and questing, and that's... mostly it.  Rooftops restore your energy per obstacle, so it doesn't matter what you wear at all.  I unironically train agility in Bandos just to make people ask why, then I teach them how it actually works.
---
There's no reason people need to wear full graceful while training most skills or making a short run from a teleport spot.  If people actually knew that and chose to wear fashionscape instead, then there wouldn't be any issue with people looking the same.
---
Maybe jagex should make an NPC that literally trims armour and you get a nice choice to pick from, like colours when you're changing hairstyle. If they implemented this into as much armour as possible it'd be dope and make people unique.

---
*uplifts in 41*
---
Brutal blacks and rune dragons are easy to play and make way more gp than a truly “afk” alt like a woodcutter would make
---
Which is another lie, what do you base this on?  Inflation through alching isn't that noticeable. Plenty of gold and item sinks makes up for this. 
---
In-game activities which severely contributed to infliation were places such as the karamja store. This was luckily nerfed before it got out of hand.
---
It’s time to remove non bis teleports
---
Most places outside of America actually pay their workers a proper wage so there is no mandatory tipping.
---
I never accused op of buying it. But, assuming i did say op bought it, how do you know he did it himself? cause he said so and theres a picture? theres so much evidence stacked against him that he didnt do it.

The wilderness and pking is suffering from Jagex taking the quick and easy road when it comes to trying to reinvigorate activity there, by pumping it full of pvm and skilling stuff, and as a result non pkers have become full on stakeholders in the region.

Players have gotten used too, and begrudgingly accepted the risk and balance there is now and are reasonably pushing back against ideas which will make their time there harder, all while nothing at all is offered in terms of fair counterplay, or even made harder, such as in the case of something like the Bulwark being nerfed because of consistent complaints from pkers. We will see this played out in the BH poll in the coming weeks aswell.  
---
I think in the very particular case of LMS there is push back about a no requirement minigame having large amounts of strong rewards, with a twist of some things like the orbs being on the not very oldschool side of things.

Me too thanks

you can open a support ticket for payment issues?

Someone did comment that 5 hours earlier in a reply to the same person.

It's not even made of dragon lul

Inferno cape is a waste of time, unnecessary. The fire cape is superior in many regards.
---
Duel arena exists in rs3 too.
---
Ive taken the liberty to check if it is mobile, its not i can cook them normaly, so you probably didnt talk to all 3 guys after the quest
---
When I have stuff at Zulrah/Hespori I play as if I'm a HC. Yes theres intenional dieing, but its not like theyre polar opposites in game play
---
well sometimes you get put on shifts when no customers come in
---
I was under the presumption that usage of AHK would be automatically detected, but if that's not the case, guess I'm wrong.
---
I knew remapping was fine, I just thought the program itself could trigger a ban.
---
Cool info.
---
That was his point, hence the “watch out people!” At the end
---
yeah but if some dude let you party in his house you'd at least offer him a beer no?
---
Then practice. It's good money.
---
As someone who's never heard of c engineer, how has he never been killed?

hehe, I got one at 3kc
---
Ofc it did, an update for both ironmen and pking? Doomed from the start

Having public off boosts your exp
---
people will click the name at the top of the list when its sorted for what they want lol
---
that shit sucks though
---
r/2007scape is official osrs sub and home of all osrs memes. r/oldschoolrunescape is great sub for newbies to get their questions answered.

You're talking to the wrong npc then. talk to all 3 to be safe
---
They publicly announced on dev blog that they would not enforce this rule
---
honestly this isn't what the hosts are thinking, they just like being popular. the donations they make are super minimal, xgrace even hands out a shit ton of money on stream, his stream happens to be really obnoxious and that's the only way for him to get viewers though
---
Saw a guy with an elemental shield, thought it was the best shield I'd ever seen. I asked him how much he wanted for it, he said he'd sell for 1m... I was no where near 1m and was honestly heart breaking.
---
I just went back and talked to all three and now I can cook them, not gonna lie I'm pretty stupid haha
---
I would legit ditch all my OSRS accounts to play another version of runescape with zero house teles.
---
Jesus fucking christ- how many fucking free teleports do we need around the map. Like it's actually ridiculous now.
---
McDonald's isn't a serving job though. There's no consistent tips there.
---
Fighting back will never feel pointless again when you realize its way more effective to hit them back and make them eat when youre frozen than it is to stand still and do nothing. Run/die is the small brain reaction, fight AND flight is the real solution
---
I see those sky rocks same as middle phases where you have to dodge them. But during head phase you just have a few extra spices to it, and even then you have little disturbances - you can almost 100% focus on the rocks.
---
Of course if you have head turning duty during head phase, that IS hard! I've done it a few times, and that is very very hard. I mean, turning head during phases is easy, but turning the head AND dodging the rocks is hard.
---
Looks... pointless
---
If you fall for this, you deserve to lose your account.
---
Sure but he isn't even an ultimate ironman. He already maxed one. He is a morytania locked one with one goal. It would be terrible content to do nothing but spend a whole year hunting a rune cbow. He is trivializing nothing because there is no game mode like that.
---
Aful is still my favourite because of the name :D
---
I agree in our lifetimes at least, but the enlightenment took 200 years before real revolution followed its ground work. I think we may be laying the ground work now for something similar. Hopefully with the Information Age in full swing, revolution this time around won’t require the bloodshed needed last time around.
---
Yup!! I worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years (right out of high school). I was a trainer for every part of the store but resisted any attempts to push me into a management role. I would make more than the managers in 30 hours a week while going to classes than the managers would in 50. And they would be working HORRIBLE schedules.
---
LMS is popular now.
---
No worries man, if you need any help pm me!
---
You can buy around 7.5k gold per hour from bf tho..
---
Get into pking and actually start playing the game
---
Yes it is indeed a horrible change. They nerfed mage yet again and made brewing make you tankier instead of more susceptible to mage. Absolutely moronic from a pvp balance standpoint. Bolt raggers get stronger
---
I didn\`t even see this coming but when I did I shat
---
based
---
Sigh... The GE does not bring GP money into the game.  Do people really think that?
---
I haven't played osrs in a long time, what does this do and how much is it worth?
---
When you are making 2.50 an hour, it's pretty necessary. But all in all, the american resturaunt business is fucking trash.
---
Pay the servers 10-12 an hour instead. It cost us something like 75 bucks for a slab of meat that I would have to cut into roughly 10 steaks AND fillet mignon. The fillet itself went for 25 bucks a piece. You're telling me that you cant pay your employees? 
---
Eating out really fucks the person eating out. Because not only are prices sky high, but now you are "forced" into paying the server for his services as well.
---
Sure you dont HAVE to tip, but if you dont, you are deemed an asshole and you wont have good service next time lol...
---
I have done  Animal Magnetism and I got this funny 'backpack' :D 
---
What kind of range gear should I have for doing FireCape? 
---
I heard 70-75 ranged lvl ofc but what about the gear?
---
Can anyone explain why this person is some kind of meme? ELI5
---
Unsure if trolling or stupid
---
weenies
---
&gt; bring back 2013 osrs, remove slayer, no more quests
---
Your crazy opinions don't make me "special" mate
---
I really don't think he's trivialising the game mode lol man put 500 hours of temple trekking for a whip, what would you propose he do instead of getting help? Hunt the imps on his own and not make a video for a year?
---
Jagex stupid just like people on reddit
---
Don't worry, they'll integrity force it on us soon enough.
---
That's because you live in a backwards country.
---
Wow grats! One ox my favourite looking pets :) A bit jelly not gonna lie!
---
Mauler is incredible too, understands so many mechanics in the game. 
---
Love solo mission too
---
Well I can tell you I quit doing drugs... Lol
---
Psst.. its terrible content already. Hes paying people to hunt implings for him
---
I voted no to a lot of it because it didn’t fit thematically
---
I voted no for the taunt - feels like Fortnite. But I voted yes for probably like 60% of the other stuff, and mostly skip otherwise.
---
Yeah sure, at least then it would seem like an accomplishment and not something others did for him like this rcb will be
---
I like paying extra for someone to do a basic job with a half-assed effort
---
Gtfo with wings u birb
---
This is for real i am afraid, mister wants gear to maximise his run efficiency but doest like everyone to look the same, mister has to make a whole post just to make clear what could be said in one sentence: "I would like to see different items that work the same as gracefull, who is with me?"
---
&gt; why the tax would be different at all within the same country? What happened to cause city's and states to tax things differently?
---
State autonomy is a big part of the identity of the United States. It's a *large* geographic area, and not every state has the same needs. Programs that would benefit fishermen, for example, would make sense in coastal states like Maine, but make no sense in a landlocked state like Kentucky. Different state programs means different taxes, and this includes sales tax. Sales tax specifically can also vary from county to county, but it's usually all within a few percentage points. Because of this discrepancy, prices are just listed at MSRP because it's easier than trying to have everyone keep track of all the different sales taxes.
---
It doesn't matter what the server wants, how can you justify spending 20-30 dollars on a single plate that cost the business no more than 5 dollars in resources and time (for the cook to prep and cook) and THEN have to fork out at minimum 20 percent of that to the server that his boss refuses to pay?
---
Theres a reason why resturaunt chains are dying. You pay fucking diamonds for shit food and shit service more than half the time.
---
Pking isnt raiding tho
---
I just feel like with the delay of the shadow and the horrible servers im getting hit by half the rocks even if i move immediately
---
For real lmao
---
Which host said this?
---
I'm pretty sure the guy was trolling.
---
Also, how many trips are you able to manage to get with one inventory/ how many is best with having inventory space for gear?
---
Range and prayer are more important
---
for sure, midweek mid-day grocery shopping is tolerable, even going to costco is ok. somehow costco is still busier than i'd think, but at least it isn't a madhouse like proper weekends are.  just sucks being unable to go to parties and barbecues and stuff on weeknds without showing up late and all that, but eh, its alright.  more time for runescape, right? lol
---
you left out 2 of the 3 relevant skills
---
Ban all clue casket posts
---
Ban all pet drop posts
---
Ban all fire cape posts
---
Ban all "first 99 in 15 years" posts
---
Ban all quest completion posts
---
You don’t have to be so cynical man. The most logical reason for that particular poll failing is pretty obvious. Someone makes a HCIM, then “PK’s” their main for a bunch of loot that’s annoying to get on ironmen and you’re basically playing an unrestricted account with extra steps.
---
Probably to stop you topping yourself lol
---
you’re right, those “””new players””” who make up 80%+ of the voting playerbase
---
No you goober most players just don’t like PVP
---
You don't need 90 herb since some rooms give you enough Overload + for everyone.
---
78 Herb is pretty necessary though
---
Vocal minorities often think they’re more important than they actually are.
---
flowers as in mithril seeds? but wouldn't it take a lot of them to get to hobs? and if he did get pk'd wouldn't he lose those seeds, which are quite expensive?
---
Just under a year ago i think.
---
Is there any known way to get certain random event spawns?  I'd like to fill my Fancy Dress Box but I've been waiting for a camo hat for months.  Alternatively, is there a way to increase random event spawns in general?
---
RC bad am I rite?
---
In his Spartan Armour too
---
rip, I was looking forward the elder maul upgrade 😢
---
Reminder that all chaps are massless
---
Good. Almost everything that was polled there would be a better fit somewhere else.
---
Depends on what you want to do. I've spent the last month or so getting all my combat skills (except for prayer) to 99 so I can do bossing etc. It's pretty easy and having them opens up a lot of content. After that I'm going for construction.
---
Did winder why they were so damn expensive now.
---
You're misunderstanding what was polled. The poll was that if an ironman kills another player, that player's items are deleted from the game. As it is now, if an ironman kills a player, the player can just go back to get their loot since the ironman can't pick it up.
---
it can only be used when u have a step for that, and it also can kill u. it doesnt stop at 1hp. i also would suspect (but cant confirm atm) that its not useable inside nmz cus it doesnt work in a lot of instances. did you mean the locator orb from ds2? in either case, this is on an alt that doesnt have access to either.
---
If that is the case then overall it’s not helping the game. Pkers have to engage in pvm/skilling/quests to get advance their accounts. This mini game could allow pvmers to do the opposite, to engage in my pking to advance their accounts. And if they did it would reduce the difference between what is a pker and pvmer
---
Actually they’re crustaceans.
---
You can actually use one email over a dozen times depending on how long it is.
---
https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360001332737-Use-the-same-login-email-for-different-accounts

Cause they could spend it on better content?
---
STOP BEING LAZY!! There you go.
---
Are we not allowed to blame both the game that incentivizes this toxic behavior as well as the predatory credit institutions? Everyone is the asshole here, including the whales with no self-control.
---
Mate the suggestion was that the itrms disappear, not that ironmen can loot pked targets lmao
---
RIP The Liquor
---
&gt;not watching 25 buttholes
---
Light him up boys
---
Mod ash said lot of dev time went into lms to make it better. It was reworked 3 times. Not sure how t byu is was personal time
---
Always nice to see but isn’t this better placed on the runescape forums?
---
Because in real life Betas and Alphas and all this other shit dont exist.  Hes just a super low self esteem guy with very little common sense and no idea how relationships work. Throwing out word like beta is incredibly childish
---
Ok.
---
Nah most of us stopped cos it stopped being the runescape we knew. Take away the MTX and it’s still the same shit.
---
Dude literally reads off the wiki lmao
---
Learning to PK is hard, learning to PK with ::renderself is A LOT harder. 
---
There is no reason for Jagex to remove this, especially considering it was given the OK in PVP specific tournaments, such as DMM.
---
Kind of tired of POHscape tbh...
---
What? What bis armor do you get from castle wars? Lol
---
As a pvmer who missed this poll as I've barely been on I'm just sad to find out the elder maul buff failed
---
Tekton in chall mode solos is a bitch could've done with that 
---
Seemed like a pvm buff more so than pvp but I reckon that would have passed if not included in a pvp poll, which raises further investigations needing to be done imo
---
I did misunderstand. My b
---
I'd also love to read it :D
---
You knew what i meant though didn’t you. And yes they do exist. In the animal kingdom. We use alpha and beta in the context of animal hierarchy.
---
You caught me
---
How is this relevesnt then. As you stated you use the heart when attacking. If your tanking you brew so you lose the bonus.
---
Oof that one hit home too hard lol
---
And get skull tricked
---
If iron man was a evil villain that would be his face, it’s like a mix of tooth face and a depressed joker.
---
If your interested in wilderness hybrid/NH pking, then go for 85 ranged and strength, 45 prayer. For your attack and strength its up to you. Personally I’ve always went for 60 attack because I prefer having more than 1 KO opportunity in a fight, which is all you get with a gmaul unless you bring an obby maul too. 
---
So for example I have a baby pure for NHing, stats are:
---
60 Attack, 77 Strength, 88 Magic, 87 Ranged, 45 Prayer, 75 HP at 68 Combat.
---
Learn how to pk at these lower levels first is my advice. Don’t go 75 attack until you basically max out strength and hp on a 60 attack account. 75 attack will give you a few cb levels and unless your strength and hp are high, you’ll get KO’d quite easily from others in your CB range, and not have as high KO potential yourself.
---
thought the same thing lol
---
I didn't really quest til max melee/range.  DT was super e-z.  I wonder what it would be like at low levels.  However, the final quest I did for QP was mm2.  FUCK. THAT. QUEST!
---
Gz! This is literally the last Slayer pet I need and I'm dying killing this boss lol
---
yeah dude, we get it. you're fucking smart
---
hahahaha I didn’t think this was real
---
not much clans want 100 cmb usually 110+
---
0 farming exp? Not even herb runs?
---
Id love to see custom nipple ring cutouts for the shirt. Maybe add some chains that can connect the two or have multiple chains with your chosen osrs god symbol on the shirt with your nipple ring holes there
---
The time saved from Graceful is only applicable to activities like farm runs, otherwise it's literally less time-effective to even get it from the bank.
---
I think you're onto something though.  I still see people wear Graceful at, say, Monkfish where it's not very useful.  So in those areas, I agree that Graceful has become too ubiquitous, but moreso because either a) a lot of people think it looks cool, or b) a lot of people misunderstand how it works and think it's helping.
---
Many of these rewards have a good base idea but the execution is off. Maul upgrade should be just a buff and spec staff it's own item that is a pvm drop.
---
Just got all my reqs done, oh boy!
---
Imagine being perturbed at all by an obvious and notorious troll
---
Then he got shot for a thot. Smh
---
I strongly reccomend getting fire cape.  If you have somewhat decent range and pray, and BP you will be fine.  Fuck the other cape tho.
---
OwO
---
Try doing dt on a low lvl with no overheads.
---
This is still a 0.001% of accounts of low cb firecape
---
Doesn’t really do anything for 768p screens. Just makes it smaller on mine. OP, think you just gotta deal with it bud.
---
I feel like only pvm’ers are the ones shouting constantly as buthurt childs. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
---
There are other places to train prayer
---
Wings are always the start of a massive downhill change in cosmetics in games.
---
Defeat3d ;)
---
Yep did 200 kc on OG zulrah with similar gear. Was nothing strange about it lol.
---
Made more GPPH than the dudes in ancestral are pulling now so yeah we can talk about it for a second tho
---
I like to log out on the double KetZek wave before jad. That way you have plenty of time to know exactly where he will spawn.
---
And an ironman
---
They could add the Elder maul component to hard mode CoX or Theatre of Blood hard mode.. or even a new 90-99 slayer creature, it should never have been proposed to be added to that cancer minigame
---
I see your point but unlocking them costs a lot of time and money (assuming you don't use someone else's PoH)
---
Spend 10+ hours grinding in f2p to save $11
---
Smart man
---
“MOM! BAFFROOOOOM!”
---
Thank you that's a good start been having a look through, on to hats now.
---
I thought mm2 was pretty straight forward minus the raft part which had me infuriated for the best part of an hour lol
---
I asked aful how much he gets in tips and he got sooo pissed that I asked
---
Flowers as in the very cheap weapon with -100 combat bonuses so you don’t kill the goblin you’re boxing
---
Better bring your friends

In terms of skill and not highscore, Woox.
---
Some say that screen shots from his stream where he's not in the chair are actually just shots of him turning sideways.
---
super combats
---
Mom! Bucket!
---
Oh no
---
I read all the quest dialogue. In the end it saves you like 10 minutes to hold space bar so I just read it all and the writing is great. So much sarcasm and personality from the quests. Much better then classic mmo fetch quests.
---
I dont usualy vote on pvp updates because I dont know enough about pvp to make dicisions for pvpers. The only reason I voted on this poll is because I missclicked on the bank and thought, what the hell lets just vote.
---
I'm sad that the special attack magic weapon didnt pass. Would have been nice to get a KO magic specc. but a lot of the things in that poll was trash.
---
I\`m never getting the inferno
---
10 gp/hr. BANK
---
I think the point was that there is almost no reason to revert the defender ever, therefore it is a ineffective item sink and the option to revert it is pointless.
---
Unpopular opinion here: slayer worse than rc
---
Good maybe now they can understand that people don’t like the idea of their favorite cosmetic being locked behind a Minigame like LMS where all people do is ice barrage under you or behind a house.
---
No I'm shrimp
---
Look up u/Seren and you’ll see who this guy was
---
Fair enough, why would anyone buy it though? Just because they can I suppose
---
&gt; malnourished
---
When you live in murica everyone outside murica is malnourished and anorexic
---
Have you considered players bidding for the top spot on the board as a gp sink?
---
You can't boost, as you cannot start the quest without the required stats for grand master quests.  My advice is to watch some netflix while doing mlm.
---
Well i rather get a no pray overheads fire cape
---
I am underage and dont have a job so 11 $ is good for buying games lol
---
Woah that's almost 500k prayer exp from ensouled heads, plus 300k if using bonecrusher (150k without diary completion)
---
Hol up.... Sara gwd drops Arma crossbow? Has it always been this way? Played since original gwd release but never been good enough for actual drops
---
Because men are the only ones that need to take responsability over their actions I'm guessing
---
Dang! I swear we were just a 4. Nice!
---
Why is the LMS reward shop not at the minigame itself? I get they want more PvP but that's pretty unusual when you look at every other minigame, is it not?
---
You got it, my guy.
---
I had bought one myself when I got 99 slayer for the fashionscape. That's literally the only reason to get one.
---
200k is literally 1 vorky kill
---
Making a butthurt post calling other people butthurt, nice
---
Meta
---
I did. Heard nothing. There shouldn't be a "chance" of hearing back from customer support over a service that cost 11 dollars a month
---
Full rune looks better.
---
I agree. That's the reason I voted no
---
You aren't funny
---
Cool, not everyone does that believe it or not
---
Spite votes are the worst. Really need to gatekeep PvP pols behind a certain number of kills.
---
Fair play man. Congrats anyway mate
---
I hate killing this boss takes more clicking than zulrah
---
You do you, if you really have that much of an issue with it i suggest you tape a peice of paper over your screen with a hole in the center so that your character is the only person you see.
---
There. Problem solved, you're welcome.
---
I’ll read it if doesn’t feel like a huge dump of exposition and a walk of text.
---
Go mow some lawns dude.  Bond membership on low accounts is asurefire way to cut your account progress in half.
---
5 attack pures are the best
---
Pretty much the title. Money isn't a problem so the fastest training options are preferred. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of 50 attack 70 strength 80 or so range and 85 mage. I have no idea what the optimal hp level would be so I need some help on that one.
---
Poise and
---
Thanks =) wish I had someone to PM but I literally have no osrs friends anymore. They all quit and I'm a weirdo un-talkative introvert.
---
I got kicked out of xgrace's poh once when I mentioned his incomplete nexus XD
---
What time approx?!?!
---
It's not a very hard boss. If you're dying youre doing something wrong. I can offer pointers if you'd like. What is giving you trouble?
---
Bust out the crabs boys
---
No I mean, like I hate doing the boss, I haven't actually died hahaha
---
Depends on the definition of play tbh. It's easy to get 10+ hours a day in game if you do shit like NMZ or Redwoods at work on your phone. Obviously depends on the type of work you do though, for me it's no problem to zone while in the lab.
---
&gt;	. Locked behind aids quest (hard for some people to do)
---
MM2 was fun tho.
---
It's pretty embarrassing for Jagex to allow a 3rd party client to carry their game.
---
It's about as useful as the empty option on a potion
---
It's a shame these didnt pass since they all seem really interesting.  Magic having a KO spec would move it a little bit further away from mainly being a support skill, and the other rewards would definitely encourage people to play LMS.
---
I prefer playing this game , its fun
---
Its worth aprox 8m now. It used to be able 3m but with the demand going up because of the master clue step it shot up in price
---
Bruh less than 30k people voted... most players skip PvP polls and then there’s a decent amount of people who spite vote no on anything PVP related. PvP polls need to be hated behind actual PvP participation.
---
Thanks for the advice, I heard the RNG on decent drops from barrows was poor though or is that not the case?
---
200k is... 
---
15 min at gargs
---
1 zulrah kill 
---
1 herb run 
---
10 mins begging at ge 
---
10 min at demonics 
---
1 raid 
---
The list goes on... 
---
point is contacts are for Ironman not for 200k lol

God damn this community is so dog shit. It’s time to just start integrity changing things with anything related to pvp.
---
Pking is the highest skill activity in the game.

You’ll still be subsidising their wages if their wages go up - you think the prices will remain low and the quality high?

ree
---
Glad I'll never have to do that quest again
---
I’ve seen this kinda stuff before. Luring the little kids with candy into your dark twisted van, I love it bro
---
Why are you triggered over an opinion?
---
Just because content is for ironmen doesn’t mean regular players can’t do them. I do them: I don’t have to, but I do because I want to. You saying “don’t do that” isn’t going to change my mind. See how pointless it is to argue this? 😂
---
With 0 xp, yeah thats a safe bet.
---
Don't know how you can look at Nieve or the Sandwich Lady and still tell me that this is a kids game.
---
Rs3 these days reminds me of Asian mmo formulas and they've adapted too many bright flashy graphics everywhere like a set of jingly metal keys used to keep a toddler occupied. 
---
If I could get passed that, then I hit the issue of the combat system, which is just unappealing. I did try out eoc about a year after it came out and my rs3 buddy took me to godwars (once high end content) and I stuck around until he got the pet so did a few hundred kills to test it out
---
I hated everything about the pvm mechanics , they sucked the core mechanics out of what put runescape on the map as an mmo
---
Sorry I think if rs3 were to get me back, it will only ever be to bank stand for 15 mins looking at my old account then swiftly logging out again
---
Hyger will probably get it at some point.
---
This gave me cancer
---
thanks
---
This “everything should be untradable” sentiment is very clearly a result of the “ironman mentality”. RuneScape is an MMO. The biggest reason it died was because free trade and the wilderness was removed. Half of the people that comment on these threads (including yourself) seem to have a more 2008 onwards idea of RuneScape. Imo, untradables are a pretty unnatural part of osrs.
---
chaos druids = nature runes?

Unreal haul, gz lad.

69 only BTW

appriciated
---
I can’t tell if you’re trolling but 50/50 is literally a fraction, and the basis of the entire “joke.” 
---
50:50 as a ratio is saying there’s a 50% chance of either of the options happening. A 1/2 drop rate. This is just incorrect and doesnt make any sense. It’s not what it means.
---
These are my favorite scams to anti pk at lol
---
Wahhhhhhhh I have no self control and its jamflexs fault wahhhhhhhhhhh
---
ill check that thanks
---
I finished DT at 37 combat and Fire cape at 50 cb no overheads, both arent that bad.
---
Agreed on what you're saying, the items are certainly more bad on their own accord, rather than botting being the issue on this poll.
---
LMS has almost no requirements to do, and doesn't need a complicated bot to just participate over and over.  Zalcano is definitely bottable, but it's got higher requirements so devs get a little more leeway on giving it good drops.
---
And I dislike raw pvm/Slayer buffs as well.  Anything that can get exploited by bots should be balanced better.
---
And lastly, everything in RuneScape doesn't need to make money.  Every single update that has the intention of "farming for money" either dies after a month, or is close to a bis low effort moneymaker, which will definitely be nerfed because the requirements are non-existent.
---
Figure out what level u wanna be and use a combat calc to do calculate ur levels, if u don’t need more hp just do methods that don’t train it like cannon for range, arch and also the pulley thing for strength. And there’s always PC and quests
---
Then that fee is accepted when you choose to buy the food at the restaurant which is fine as it's included in the price... Like every other fucking place in the world does it.
---
Did you continue staking?
---
Late EST. Like 10-11PM ish
---
60 magic 40 everything else
---
    Wow!
---
That's entirely false though lol
---
There's a system that will still auto ban you for certain suicide bot things. Where it's 100% sure you did a botting. 
---
I mean. I'm not defending Jagex cuz there current state of bots is disgusting. But I'm saying you are terribly ignorant.
---
But... where would the meme content come from?
---
ur right
---
How many fortnite emotes play automatically? Its a non factor in that discussion.
---
Go Alch both of those d axes plz
---
Do you not have any reading comprehension skills? It's not my job to develop content for a multimillion usd company. There are better positioned players to suggest pvp updates than myself because I just pvp for fun. I didn't even vote no on everything but when it came down to it forcing rewards onto a minigame just to make it somewhat relevant isn't okay.
---
How is only playing on pvp worlds playing it safe.
---
&gt; What does “too much of a QoL update” mean?
---
I was wondering the same thing myself, is there really such a thing? I mean, OP plugins should be banned, I get that, but can you have "too much quality of life"? I don't usually go around blaming people they're all "back in my day it was hard so it should be the same for you ree" but complaining that the most(/only) used option is left click is starting to sound like it.
---
Wait... so you got cleaned in December. Worked for a year to make another 500m, then staked again for redemption and won this time?? Nice.
---
When I was noob I thought you could dye studded chaps with dyes
---
Get your construction up if you can afford it, the teleports and everything in a house are extremely helpful. You don't realize how much you would use it until you have it.
---
Nice. Now use that at  park and you’ll make millions very quickly.
---
First deal with emblem farmers then think about this... it would just boost them even more
---
It does give a warning, but many people ignore and click through it. It's a common scam for CoX gear.
---
How do I do that.
---
I like the spirit of the idea for sure.  It's a hell of a lot better than adding skilling activities just waiting to be interrupted.
---
Someone will always have their house open, tips or not. It's like bankstanding but more social
---
The thing that vexes me about those posts is that we have 400,000 users here. Even if only quarter of them are active, somebody here getting a 1/10,000 occurrence really isn't *that* unlikely. Sort of explains why we see those 'super rare' drops and &lt;5kc pets multiple times a day, with the sheer amount of users you'd almost expect to see a few things like that fairly regularly.
---
Why arent they topless
---
I quite like attack 2
---
Its the internet what did you expect
---
6 zalcano or vorkath should do the trick. Less than 30 minutes
---
That’s a strawman. I’m saying that those items were lost on death prior to 2016/2017 and that they weren’t as big of a part of the PvP meta. People didn’t even like using firecapes because you could get blocked from retrieving them. I’m not saying that those are better option but I am saying that the current state of untradables is not the same as how untradables were treated, historically, in RuneScape. If you prefer the new untradables, that’s fine. But it is definitely “unnatural” to osrs the same way the death mechanics are “unnatural”.
---
Lol you really gotta stop going to denny's
---
How did you get perma muted lmao
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Theatre_of_Blood
---
didn't know june of 2018 was over 2 years ago!
---
its the reward for paying tens of millions for the construction level
---
Location PKing will always be a thing. Why not make these locations provide boosts which will attract PKers instead of skillers, so the PKers can fight each other?
---
A fellow Weber. Nice
---
I remember seeing in dark mystic at Varrock sq when I was f2p. First time I saw it and I thought they were a vampire lol  
---
They traded me and showed like 100k, which was incredibly wealthy to me back in the day but they declined. Asked for like 10k and they just walked away
---
You can easily make 800k in 6 hours at bf.
---
I use empty for shitty pot drops at GG's. That way they are at the bottom of the pile as vials.
---
I think it would be exactly like when I log on to play my UIM alt. I'd get on for 20 minutes or so, think to myself "holy shit this is tedious" and then go back to my main and do whatever.
---
I hope people think the same about Dagon'hai from Larran's chest as well.
---
Logging out on them is my favorite escape. Idk why its just such a rush escaping with it. Teleing out doesn’t give me that same feeling for some reason. Its dumb but its fun
---
99 Rcing is so easy to get now.
---
Going back to staking isnt redemption though... you could have easily just got cleaned again. 
---
Redemption would be actually just sticking through with pvm.
---
People are gonna whine when their preferred content failed (For every lms fail you get warding failing) but the integrity of polling should be kept as strong as possible. It's a huge reason OSRS succeeded.
---
Jagex is already towing the line with these "integrity" changes, let's not give up more autonomy.
---
Only because jagex refuses to draw any sort of line in the sand.
---
If they do that we can go back to not having clients play the game for us. Sure there are some very important features I don't want to part with (gpu plugin, ui scaling, item names, item values, xp bubbles, etc.) But it would great if Jagex incorporated them into the vanilla client. As a person who uses runelite(not even one of the cheating clients) I already feel like i'm cheating, I can swap around my prayer icons(failed a poll) I can left click a bone to use it at an altar(as opposed to 2 clicks), etc.
---
Imbued heart is a solid next upgrade, then probably ancestral and then Arma.  But by then you should have enough for DHCB (and void+salve) to start doing vork.  It's fairly cheap tbh and you seem to be almost there
---
Iron bar is 250 ea right? And ore is 30 eA
---
You can make 7600 Iron bar per hour
---
900k easy
---
First time I went there, I assumed it worked like this. I was half afk and the brutal reds wrecked me so hard.
---
Why so salty? He’s just asking how he can improve. No need to be a twat.
---
Go play RS3
---
yikes you dont get jokes do you
---
That is basically what I just said.
---
Lol i almost hit the red button
---
If the rewards werent tradable I dont think a single person that didnt pk (99% of the community) would vote yes to literally anything.
---
i haven't got the combat levels or gear to do them
---
How much do you play OSRS mate?
---
You don't even need a BGS or DWH if you're using the DHCB.
---
Don’t need spec with dhcb
---
No I got hacked lol
---
You wouldn’t lower the defence of vork with a Dhcb there is no point
---
You don't need DWH or BGS with DHCB
---
#guide-to-wdr
---
Neck  beards who host houses in a game are not equal to servers in a restaurant
---
So you didn’t suggest any rewards, and admit that there are better positioned players to suggest updates. All of these rewards were complied by, arguably, the best pker in the game: Manked. Last I checked, he wasn’t employed by Jagex but still took the time to suggest a variety of LMS rewards. If you want to defer to more experienced pkers, that’s fine. Nobody is stopping you. But you’re contradicting yourself by saying that you defer to them but then say their suggestions are shitty attempted to make LMS relevant.
---
nice JPEG quality, where did you get it? JPEGGIFY. com?
---
I have tried this, but when I played the idle notifier didn't work like that and seemed to actually look at the animations. If it works better now then that's great and then there's no more reason to not share if ur using the idle notifier.
---
Go to school? You mean like the one that costs thousands of dollars and takes so much time you can’t work a full time job and go to day school concurrently?
---
You’re the entitled one bud
---
Yes it is 75% to pass a poll.
---
Eat shit boiz
---
Inb4 jagex hits us with ol' reliable integrity update
---
No it's not... the invention skill made the economy more stable than osrs. All clue items for example are worth money on rs3. All gear is holding value.
---
S
---
Oh yeah
---
Shagannoth
---
Totally forgot about imbued heart, I second doing that next.
---
What about company wifi? That’s my go to.
---
Are you an Ironman? If so then this explains everything
---
Well yeah, it doesn't work sometimes, but it's definitely better than nothing. Otherwise you can just turn on your sound and mute the music
---
I'd argue LMS is a special exception because bots have a direct impact on how the game is played. With an instanced boss, the bots don't influence your gameplay directly (only your profits), whereas in LMS, the bots *are* the gameplay. I typically don't like arguments against adding/changing content just because it'd be exploitable by bots, but it's too easy to rig and exploit PvP content at the moment.
---
This seems like pure benefit
---
Also thank you for not being like most of runescape’s population and only wanting things that have extra rewards attached
---
I'd instantly quit this game if I would be forced to use jagex's official client, and I have 405 days of gameplay on my main.
---
Oh wasn't sure, cheers for clearing it up lads
---
Yeah my plan is not to do Vork until I can afford a DHCB but if pet luck is good then I won’t complain. All the Vork gear is in 2 items from what I’ve seen (pegasians and DHCB) and the rest is untradables. Even if I’m not 90+ range is elite void worth it? I’ve seen mixed reviews on that.
---
Yeah this is why I quit. Let's take ring imbues as an example. Everyone says everything can be put "somewhere else" but no one has any clue where. Polls will kill this game and it's actually depressing to watch.
---
I don't think the level of variety is enough to cause a split in supply. If anything, all it does is invalidate previous items (basically onoly ironmen use barrows set nowadays, except for Dharrok's and Karil's top/skirt).
---
Gotcha. Just a heads up, not everything is a scam. It’s good to be weary don’t get me wrong but you don’t have to go jumping on everybody’s thread immediately saying it’s a scam when you don’t actually know.
---
So the good old days of Varrock low level multi pking are over?
---
Halos and cwars top are bis for pures
---
Thank you - will take a look. Gutted that the good old days of varrock multi pking seem to be over.
---
Had to google it and now I'm watching some guy singing ABBA in a river somewhere in Japan...
---
Nice!  This one brought me roughly from 50 to 60m bank, brought the current cash stack to 19m which feels good.  Deciding what to use it on, probably either torture or anguish depending on what next slayer task is.
---
You mean the tiny flaps on top of the boots? how does that even compare to having actual wings on your back
---
In Asia, tips are seen as an insult. It's like saying, "Fuck you, your services suck. Take this money and get some help."
---
Once you get you combat up a bit I would train on hill giants. Can bury the bones for prayer xp along the way. Also when I get home I will add you in game and you can ask me questions you have if im ever on. My friend recently got back into the game so what I did was offer him jobs that would help him improve his account while also make some money. Maybe I can do the same for you.
---
I don't understand how you can do less than 150-180, it's really not that difficult unless you're literally afking one spot
---
The real LPT is always in the comments
---
None of those are elite PvM content
---
If I ever get a T bow. I might attempt it.
---
Yeah I’ve seen a bit of that place - but I feel I’m way too low to go there now. I’ll just get attacked by level 80’s and above. 
---
Is there any other location that does multi pking where I’m not so ‘deep’ into the wildly?
---
I hear you
---
This all depends on your gear, or how much you have to spend on gear.
---
Cheers for your nmz guide. Used it the other day so simple !
---
That was me trying to boost to 88 Smithing for Elite Lumby, took me like 30 stews, had to get more spice twice, and I gained a smithing level in between the first and second attempts too.
---
cock
---
I dont think bot creators would have a difficult time making bots run towards the same point on the map, and try and fight eachother when they get there
---
I think you are correct about that not being too successful but we gotta think about what the botters can and cannot do, as to minimize the actual botting in-game 
---
I am all for your idea and i really do agree with you, but being one step ahead of bot scripters is better than to be one behind, which have been for a long time tbh
---
It literally wouldn't make them easier. They would require the same amount of time to get as any other content in the game, or likely less, and definitely less than the already-tradeable implings.
---
7 1/2 hours from now would be 8PM Eastern. That’s around the earliest we will be on
---
Honestly people are saying look up optimal quest guides and stuff online, but exploring the game without knowing what you’re doing for a week or so will probably make you enjoy it more at least in the beginning haha
---
Framed is worse than a friend
---
Maybe perhaps it's because LMS is just not a great minigame. Protection prayer and switching between 3 combat styles is not enjoyable for many people. If they want to make the minigame more popular/accessible they should add different loadouts/gamemodes such as veng zerker/pure pking without protection prayers. 
---
I'm still waiting for soul wars/stealing creation to be added (actually fun minigames).
---
&gt; I don’t understand why they wanted everything to be tradeable.
---
Because minigames are shit and the only way to get anyone to play them is if you can make money by playing them
---
Multi zone, dragons on both sides have enough range to hit you on the stepping stones. Brutal reds have a mage attack that noobier players don’t know about. 
---
So if they’re crossing the stepping stones without pray mage activated, they get merked and panic click to run but the stepping stones prevent that once you’re on them. 
---
Yea, you obviously could teleport. But usually said noobier player is too busy panic clicking each individual stone/panic eating.
---
I am literally doing this now. 10 stews down.
---
Bruh just dont die lmao /s
---
Garg drops are still ~4k because most of the gold comes from gold drops, alchables, and gold ore. I think Steel Bars and Chaos Runes going down dropped prices by a bit but not too much. The math on my previous comment outlines how it's still 1m+ gp/hr.
---
Not really tbh.  If you’re a pure you could look into joining a clan.  That’s probably the best way to get more action.
---
Peoples' hatred of PvP might undermine the poll system in the long term.
---
95% of updates for Pkers are going to get voted down because people don't like that they can actually get attacked in the wildy. Jagex is going to force "integrity changes" because there is no way these updates could actually pass.
---
I send you a Pm lemme know what you think.
---
can you add some flax in there ?
---
Could you imagine if they put an ounce of thought into the game's economy and instead of making resources for PvM item charges they instead considered the absolute raging river that is teleport charge throughput in the game's core loop
---
I feel like there are so many ways to dynamically make strong "in demand" resources for activities to put out into the game, but they unintentionally kill potential with "minor" things that totally change the convenience meta.
---
Like think of all the mining spots on the map **absolutely no one uses** since MLM exists, outside of runite. Same for yew trees and the existence of Woodcutting guild.
---
I don't think saying very few people actually participate in PKing is a hot take, it's the truth, pkers are a minority. The problem is that Jagex wants people to become more involved in that scene, hence PvM buffs to wilderness. PvMers, including myself, love the rewards Wilderness brings, but hate the downside of dying there. 
---
The issue stems from voting itself in my opinion. People will not vote against their interests and they will spite vote against the polls that concern the community they don't like. That's just human nature. Furthermore, i believe the 75% pass rate is too high for democracy It doesn't give power to the majority, it gives a fuckton of power to a small minority.
---
Lol wut? I play this game only for the PVP because it's fucking insane. NO other game gives you the joy to of looting the items of a plyer you just killed. Not a predefinied set of items, but w/e that dude had in his inventory.
---
Fuck BH, fuck PVP worlds, Deep wilderness is where the fun is at and nothig needs to be changed.
---
800k doing smithing or in general?
---
100%, these mobile game developers think that spamming everyone with their ads and paying every creator possible to do an ad, is going to make people want to play
---
Thanks!  I finished MM2 a couple weeks ago, and unblocked Black Demons for this reason and I'm on my first task now.  I've only done 2 trips so far because I mostly play on mobile, so I'm slowly chipping away at the task whenever I'm on RuneLite.  Right now I can only do like \~20 kc per trip cuz I suck lol but slowly learning.
---
People don’t do pest control for money, they do it to get void
---
Yeah I am building a pure. Could you possibly point me to a place where I could find such clans?
---
That’s not a salamander that a FUCKIN RAT
---
Chill out there autumn elegy
---
Oh that was my bad, it came out more recently than I thought but my point still stands. It's been over a year since we got new elite PvM content and we haven't even gotten an announcement for something new on the horizon yet, so here's hoping for Runefest.
---
Giant mole is surprisingly afk, just have protect melee and dharock him. Got over 1k kills in 4 days, while doing it lazily. around 600-700k/h.
---
~~only died twice~~
---
&gt;And lastly, everything in RuneScape doesn't need to make money.
---
And if it doesn't make any money it's guaranteed dead content within a month.
---
Meh, happened at like 800 skill total, almost hitting 1900 now, and I was able to learn barbarian assault while still being permamuted, most people want an extra attacker and I got damn lucky like 3 times, got my hard kandarin done but I'm fucking terrified for the elite.
---
But also, if people don't die and lose their items, no items are removed and inflation gets worse. Item sinks that rely on people dying would be ineffective and not fix the issue
---
My first pet was also a beaver,  cutting willows in draynor as well at 56 woodcutting.
---
Here on reddit is a good place to start.  There’s usually people on reddit that are ready to recruit for their clans.  You could also visit the bounty hunter worlds and see if someone’s advertising recruitment for their clan.
---
Fuck item names on the ground and fuck you. I don't want to see a god damn full length Harry Potter fanfiction on the floor every time I walk into the Grand Exchange.
---
It actually threw me off when I noticed the skill is called “Runecraft” and not “Runecrafting” just doesn’t sound right... 
---
Side note, idk how long it’s been that way but in RS3 it is actually called Runecrafting
---

"In light of recent discussion, we're postponing the Bounty Hunter rewards poll to take on more feedback and suggestions.   
---
Let us know your thoughts on the issues described in this announcement post"
---
U probly took the bait
---
i mean i guess i will show up. Free money is free money.
---
I can't imagine the shitfest we'll all witness once the BH poll goes down similarly in a couple of weeks. Jagex will assumably feel an urge to interfere at that point - the drama calendar will get plenty of content.
---
you can make way more than 200k a day! depending on what kind of contracts you get.
---
Should have it’s own checkbox at medical exams
---
I'd say just stick with whatever's closest to your level for a while.  Once you start fishing trout (and later salmon in the same spot), stick with that until around 60.
---
If you're a member, Catherby is the best spot for a while.  If not, west of Varrock near Barbarian fishing is the best place for Trout fishing.
---
I’ve been away from RS for quite some time, like 10/12 years. I’ve just returned and have seen things like Runelite mentioned - so is this okay to use now I presume?
---
Oh nice what's her name does she play osrs?
---
Hi, that's me.
---
PM me your pures stats, I’m apart of Onslaught which is at the moment the #1 Pure Clan in OSRS
---
Do you guys play on vanilla? Runelite tells you where to stand. Completed it in like 30 minutes.
---
Imagine gatekeeping clue scrolls
---
That's not quality of life. That is just straight up ezscape.
---
If you want QoL you ask the click boxes be made bigger. Adding green boxes to tell you "HEY CLICK HERE" is literal braindead gameplay.
---
I make 10 an hour right now and we’re always busy. A usual weekday is $120 a night for a 6 hour shift + base wage, and tuesdays (we do a trivia night) are fucking insane. If my job was only like $15 an hour, I’d quit the day I didn’t get tips, just not worth it.
---
But I gotta flex my rift guardian, lol. But I did stop skilling with my pet out for a while
---
Terrible profit and bad xp. But very afk
---
Good point, wasn't thinking in terms of having 2bil burnt shrimp being impressive compared to 2bil burnt sharks.
---
That's not accurate. That's clients open
---
I disagree, dropping the fish at barb is easy on mobile and doesnt take alot of effort
---
If you dont like it at work thats fair, doesnt change the fact that barb fishing is very good exp and easy to do
---
Yeah I tried to search for a clan reddit thread but didn’t seem to find one. I’ll take another look - thanks for all your help though!
---
I don’t know why I’m still keeping my account at 45 def
---
Exactly how I feel. People do not want to pvp for money. They would rather these rewards be on content that they would actually participate in. You can't blame them for that, but that's the way it is. 
---
It explains why the imbue scroll failed too, I think overall people want other ways to imbue rings than NMZ, but having to do pvp content to do that isn't interesting so they voted no.
---
Coolest helm I the game
---
The ideas were nice, badly implemented behind content no one cares about and also making them tradable is a big issue, whens the scroll that make me immune to idiots on the Wild so i can do my pvm activities without issue tho lol
---
Yea karambwans should be best bet rn I believe. Not sure if OP wants to train non-99 skills while afking tho
---
I mean I’m pretty new. Been playing for about 4 days again now. Total level of 600. Will DM you. Thanks.
---
My girls making $20-$22 at cracker barrel as a weitress. Oh and $3 an hour
---
can't live without animation smoothing. Will quit if I have to go back to the choppiness of the OG client.
---
I fucking love this suggestion. There are so many teleports in the game that I don't use because I can't be bothered having to get them and take up space in my bank. I love the chest idea where you keep all those random teleport things in one place.
---
You're just arguing semantics. The goal of Runescape is to progress, so by doing that you're essentially "winning." If you pay to progress in a game where progression is the gameplay loop, you're paying to win.
---
Are we even talking about the same thing?  You bring up switching plugins and boss mechanics and other shit, but that wasn't even in the OG comment?  What they were talking about were purely QoL things (timers, item names on ground, and menu switching).  I feel like you are complaining about other things that what the original commenter and I aren't even talking about?
---
I think that there are just some very common sense plugins that make the game largely more playable.  Without them, the game feels dated, and not in the nostalgic way that drives people to play it.  It feels dated in the way that menuing in a lot of older games feels awful, they didn't know any better.  You can want the feel of '07scape without wanting a 1-to-1 recreation with all the flaws of design that stemmed from not having 12 extra years of learning.  That's all the commenter and I are talking about.
---
Work on runecrafting for an east money maker that will never go away. Even at level 50 rc I was making like 250k gp an hour making nature runes
---
Blowpipe
---
Also very good against KQ if you do the walk under method. On task you hit pretty much every time.
---
If you can't teleport to it, does it really exist?
---
Just recently got 70 construction for song of the elves, what are the must haves for my POH now?
---
😭😭😭😭😭 no 89
---
The lore is the only thing i really miss from rs3, they have well developed storylines concerning dragonkins, gods and what else, although at least Guthix still live in OSRS lol.
---
And someone would take your place faster than you can walk out the door. You do a job that requires bare minimum skills, it's not like you arent replaceable.
---
Me circa noe
---
Is there a general minimum level to do zolcano? I've heard you should be like 85 mining but I don't want to grind that and I'd like to try out the new content.
---
That's still twice as fast as monkfish. If you're gonna afk, infernal eels are faster and more afk than monks.
---
I just disagree. PvP and PvM inherently don't mix. I'm not saying I want easier moneymaking outside the wilderness. If revs or other content were to be moved, nerf their drop table for all I care. 
---
The problem is that PvM content designed in the wildy is *nothing* but frustrating. There's no amount of money that makes me want to be a punching bag for other players. I did 80-95 hunter at black chins and 95-99 at reds. I ended up averaging higher xp and gp/h at red chins just because I wasn't forced to deal with pkers and  bank every 30 minutes and I was far less frustrated about people interrupting my progress. 
---
The problem is that it's just impossible to gear for wildy PvM while maintaining the ability to fight back. If I had a chance of living or fighting the pker attacking me, then sure. But until then, all wildy PvM content is just regular PvM content except you occasionally roll a dice to waste your time and see if all your progress is wasted. 
---
What feature of running for your life from PKers is fun?
---
I didn't say it was 100k afk. Silly silly man.
---
Start with a baby pure, and then as you want bigger and better things you can progress further
---
Oh man I know nothing about burnt stuff, makes sense though. Thanks for the info.
---
Inferno? Costs hundreds of mill (or bills if you need top gear like I would) of you die a lot which I do
---
Good! None of that should be gated behind LMS (or, as tradables, come exclusively from LMS). It's like they took all the stuff they haven't found a place for, and forced it into an unrelated minigame.
---
Back in the early days of RuneScape you couldn't just look up a monster and find the exact drop rate of every item on its drop table. There were commonly discussions on the official forums about what the drop rates were for some of the more rare items. It turns out a lot of people didn't understand the basics concepts of how probability works, and so there was this common misconception that went around that since you either got the drop or you didn't that there was a 50/50 chance of getting the drop. Other people were under the impression that a 1/100 drop rate, for example, meant that you would get said drop every 100 kills and would argue that there were no drop rates and that all the drops were "just random".
---
It was an infuriating time.
---
Rune drags are way more than 1.2m
---
Saying a server is bare minimum isn’t really correct. We get no breaks, work hard as fuck for 8 houra, need good people skills, a good memory really helps, it’s not that easy lol
---
Feel like I know you. We're you in the CC "Runenation" by any chance?
---
I'm glad they're taking feedback for this poll.  Several blogs in the past have been posted and polled without addressing feedback, causing pretty ok content to get voted no because of minor issues (or even voted yes).
---
You literally edited out the shittier examples of your post because you realized what a piece of shit it was, downvoted me, and even edited the response. I mean what's the point dude, go waste some other adult's time.
---
Totally agree here. Quests are a must.
---
Crazy right? Almost like the game is designed to click on hitboxes.
---
Can you explain why tradable imbues make no sense? It wouldn't be any different than the already long list of items you can upgrade by buying them off of the G.E. It's just a change, and imo it would have been a change in the right direction. NMZ is horrible content.
---
Actually tradable imbues is mostly a pvper update than anything. PVM players would only have to buy one to imbue their ring. If you pvp with an imbued item and die you have to go back to slave nmz for an hour to get another one. I'd rather anything else to give imbues than NMZ.
---
I agree with elder maul, and clue scrolls they don't really need to come from LMS. 
---
Complexity isn't a reason enough to vote no on something for me. Though I guess inadvertently buffing revs isn't something people would want. It would be nice to reduce the large disparity between pvm and pvp gear so that it's easier to make money in the wilderness and fight back at the same time, imo.
---
You can get Jad. Died 3 times on Jad and 20 on Galvek, he's easier than Galvek 1000%
---
I would not be against a direct buff either my dude
---
Fuck wish i knew about that would have trained agility past 70
---
&gt; but others may enjoy it
---
Name one minigame thats actually active without having to bribe players into playing it with musthave rewards that isnt called castle wars (and even here a good number of players afk for tickets).
---
Before you say Barrows,BH or any of the minigames that are just a skilling method, those are clearly are not real minigames and counting them as minigames is disingenuous because by that logic both raids, fight caves and inferno would also count as minigames.
---
Blowpipe every time bud it’s op
---
Ban them all after updating the official client is, IMO, the only sensible solution. 
---
Leaves no room for interpretation on what is/isn't allowed. Shame that Jagex are too tight &amp; lazy to put in the work that this would require. 
---
If eventually they DO sort this out, I expect that it would more or less be a one and done thing - no new features added (or very rarely)
---
That's been the case since the game's inception. But, we have to ask why the wild is so incredibly dead compared to the 2007 era. What exactly is the difference? Has everyone just decided that multi pking in varrock east on low level accounts isn't fun anymore? Is it the lack of viable account builds in edge? Do people just know too much about the game now (through streams and wiki) and it's therefore less fun? Has powercreep without more diversity adversely affected PvP (Simply going up in stats continuously instead of adding new powerful low level weapons, i.e. corrupt PvP items)?
---
It's been a question I've had since I started playing osrs 4 years ago. Clearly, the players are older, but is that the main reason we've stepped away from the social aspects of the game? Do we just not like interacting with others at all anymore?
---
It's really weird to me.
---
Where we're you yesterday! haha damn that's crazy
---
This one is a good troll. Cheers man
---
That helmet is awesome!  I didnt even notice it
---
It's your fault. You probably look like a terrorist.
---
wagie wagie back in your cagie
---
I think a lot of us have had that exact same feeling when we first started.
---
Finally buying that peice of bronze armor from the lummy general store after killing goblins for literal hours to save up 900gp. Such a hard to describe feeling when you actually put it on.
---
Yah... Personally, I am a fan of damage caps like the Dark Bow. I am not sure if the Dark Bow works this way, but in theory, they don't make higher strength useless. Like if the cap of a weapon, normal or spec, was 60, if you could only hit a max of 60 pre-cap you'd roll 0-60 if you landed a hit. But if you could hit 65 pre-cap, then you'd roll 0-65 and anything above 60 is reduced to 60, giving a higher chance to land your max hit.
---
I think it would have been nice to set caps on all weapons, at least specs, by default, even if it is above our current max hits for those weapons. Then we wouldn't have to worry about future buffs raising the hits to problematic levels.
---
NMZ is the definition of mediocre
---
LMS rewards were extremely poor, while the BH rewards look significantly better.  Just because it's a "PvP" updates doesn't mean people should blindly vote Yes or No.
---
Yes they do
---
I'm not a huge fan of Thieving either. I did a mixture of master farmers, and sorceress' garden to 71, then mostly Pyramid Plunder. once i hit 80 i got rogues then mousekeyed 99 at ardy knights but that was before the money pouch update. Personally i'd still put lamps into RC. Agility and thieving become pretty relaxed around level 60 or so, but RC sucks until 77
---
Low alch yourself

This is an epic idea on paper
---
You’re trash

If they open their house, I ain't tipping. Literally an invitation to go to their house and they make 2m+ an hour
---
Trouvers already fucked deep wildly. Why yes I'd love to fight someone with a water stick AND A FUCKING INFERNAL SWITCH?????
---
I wouldn't advise it... You can easily get 800k/hr on hard melee bosses, nearly afk and using barely any resources if you bring the ancient mace and some prayer gear, as opposed to the huge cost per shot of a BP.
---
Anyone telling you to do nmz with a BP should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
I work for A famous mouse in Florida. I work 60 hours in those 5 days but damn do I enjoy my days off playing rs lol
---
They are excessively expensive, when i do vorkath i usually only bring dhcb, but if i had to bring blowpipe id use addy darts because less expensive.
---
But it's still more OP than a lot of the poster child OP plug ins. Left click blackjacking? Does not increase xp/hr at all. Menu entry swapper? Drastically increases prayer xp/hr.

Jad is much easier than Galvek imo.

Shiet, here I was thinking all that slayer and Barrows he was doing was in a pvp zone
---
They don't.
---
You’re benefitting from the services that somebody is being employed to do, by an employer that you are paying for said services.
---
Lavas aren't even that intensive. And if that's too high effort, you can do ZMI. Both of those are pretty quick ways to get to 77 imo.

Yea I really wish we had more lore. I mean the grandmaster quests have lore as it is now but it feels kind of isolated. I feel like grandmaster quests had more of an effect on the world lore-wise in rs3.
---
This is such a wicked pet to have as your first. Big congrats
---
KiLl tHE SpInNeRs
---
It doesn't really matter what other sources there are, because if just one source can prove that a certain rate is achievable then every other source before it becomes invalidated.
---
Which is fine. I think everyone can accept that it is a logical consequence to dislike things against your interests.
---
Also logical that pvp community is way smaller than the rest of the community, so their interests aren’t going to reflected in poll results if that in any way favours them over the rest of the game.
---
How do you solve that? I don’t think it can be unless polling is changed or the wildy design or interaction is changed.
---
My problem with most of these polls wasnt the things being added, but it being added to LMS. Lms was meant to be a gold sink, with atleast 1m being removed entirely. And now were just going to add a ton of meta high value gear back into the game through that same exact system. Even if lms wasnt a money sink, nothing meta should really be coming out of that shop, it should be elsewhere. If you like lms, you're going to do lms, if you dont do lms, youre not. Adding high value items isnt going to make non-pkers learn to pk, it's just going to make the small minority that are already profiting big time profit even more. 
---
I do wish the taunt passed though, I thought it would have been hilarious.
---
I thought the official lore was just that Armadyl felt bad that everyone ignored Zily, so he gave it to her as a birthday present
---
Then you don't value the game enough. The original client isn't as bad as some casuals say.
---
Aw, come on. You're gonna make Swampy Bogbeard cry.
---
They made it dead content on purpose because of bots, the same thing happened to Flax fields.
---
I've gotten 6.  
---
I screenshotted 5 of them:  
---
First one at lvl 92  
---
Second at 16.2m xp  
---
Third at 20.2m xp  
---
Fourth at 24.6m xp  
---
Fifth at 61m xp  
---
I'm guessing the other one was around 30m xp but I'm not sure
---
So you would never vote for content that you personally don't enjoy? You have to acknowledge that no update is going to be universally enjoyed, and you should vote for updates that are good for the game's long term health and not just for updates that you think would benefit you personally.
---
Barrows with guaranteed box and slayer with p much guaranteed box? Ok cowboy tell me why he hasn't been killed yet
---
I like your stats

How do you set up extended render distance?

Exaggerated. You'd get used to it and realize that the OS client isn't that bad. If not, you probably shouldn't be playing the game because rs was never dependent on 3rd party training wheels, initially.

And you could say the same thing about any retail job that gets paid much less. Or the kitchen at the place you served at. I promise you, people do just as/more shitty work for less. I've been there and done that.
---
Also, unless we're talking about a 5 star restaurant where you're basically expected to be a sommelier, it is a no skill job.
---
The tank should have a bgs, so they can hit first and lower the defense so the DPS with DWH's have a higher chance of hitting spec.

&gt;still watching ads

Anything else you can think to do with them? Have nearly 100k shards saved up, dunno what to do with them all. At 78 herblore so I could make divine ranging pots, but I wont be hitting 97 herblore for divine super combats any time soon.
---
Dunno, maybe he's just been in deadman allstars.
---
 
---
Funny you say that about boxes too, considering in the most recent episode he only barely got a pj from his task (unintentionally, at that) when the guy that was after him messed up a switch.
---
You "like" the ads? Sound like what a paid marketing team would say.

And that's illegal and the restaurant would get sued so fast that your head would spin if you actually reported it.

REEEEE

Honestly I am not sure, I thought I remembered reading that in a reddit comment once and some other people agreed. But, you know what they say about reading things on the internet.
---
I mean our cooks get a base wage of $20 an hour starting, and the one who’s been here a decade gets like $35, so they have no reason to complain tbh.  I don’t work at a 5-star, but we’re decently high end. Like we have to wear dress pants and shirt, and our managers make it seem like this is the best place ever.
---
Did anyone else just get an email to do a survey regarding player support, with a link to a survey? I'm assuming it's a phishing attack, but on the off chance it's real, I'd take it.

It was never used by players only bots lmao

that shit was devalued beyond usability on purpose

Iv seen men beat them unconscious and harvest their horns for hours on end. IV SEEN'T IT.... It takes awhile but they regrow their horns and start to roam free only for it to happen again.

Oh; yeah that definitely changed my mind; I'll be sure to go download RL right now; thanks! Lmao
---
If you wanna still be able to do zulrah in between learning to raid, then keep the ring. Its a big qol upgrade at zulrah than just using standard rings of recoil. If you wanna just drive straight into raiding, then sell it when you can make solid upgrade like dragon hunter lance or rigour.
---
I made this a few months ago but never posted it cuz I figured it get downvoted lol

When you circumvent the laws because you're one of  the most experiences magicians in existence*
---
Eldermaul buff would have passed if it was just a buff, because its trash rn.
---
Gating the buff of an item as rare as the twisted bow behind a minigame is weird though.
---
PVP WEAPONS:
---
How about a "binding" feature, where the weapons do not degrade but are untradable? If you kill someone for their weapon, it becomes "bound" to you instead. 
---
This would allow pkers to start weapon collections for the clout. They could also allow others to kill them for a weapon in exchange for payment, much like the old emblem sellers. 
---
This way, those in possession of the weapons control the prices, instead of being at the mercy of the GE. Also helps keep the economy from flooding with them since they are not bought and sold so easily.
---
May be they really meant to say close and not closed?
---
Try falling asleep every other second doing quests.
---
That's so sad, Alexa, play Despacito

Big no to damage boost for Dagon'Hai. Devalues Elite Void IMO. Should be worse than Mystics but have good prayer bonus. Possibly similar to Proselyte bonus but idk.

Have they blamed non-polled pvp implements on integrity issues before?

Next question
---
Thinking about starting OSRS after being away from RuneScape for a very long time. Only thing really worrying me about playing again is the bots in OSRS. How is it nowadays?
---
Ive fought about 400 people in lms and come across 1 bot. The other problem with this arguement is you dont get alot of points for just playing, not to mention most times your bot would go down between 24-20 players and not even get a point. Itd be 5x more profitable to run bowstrings on a bot even if the rewards passed so i dont see why people think its bot infested.
---
Question should be: how many of you guys don't read quests?
---
The questing experience in this game is best in class homie. None of that go here kill this many bs.
---
asking for you to act in regards to common sense is too much but at least google how to use semicolons
---
Make RuneScape great again!
---
&gt; it would be easy to normalize distribution while 
---
this is already non-trivial in runescript lol
---
&gt;Slightly decreasing the default chance of success
---
Slightly increasing the chance of success with each consecutive failure
---
Resetting to the default rate after a success roll
---
Even if they could easily normalize the random number distribution, this doing all this just so you can reduce the chance of sometimes getting an unlucky streak is incredibly dumb. not to mention how much work it would take to convert all sorts of things in game to be the same long term, and not to mention the needless complexity that this adds that could be exploited like getting your account stuck in a high success chance state and exploiting that for better rates.
---
this is one of the worst suggestions ive seen on here in a while and thats saying something
---
Drop parties were so much superior and worth it before the bankers started announcing that a drop party was about to start all over rs. That's still in place  in 07 rs afaik.
---
It’s always true?
---
Summoning?
---
When do you guys think we'll be getting zalcano drop rates? It's been a while since it was released. I would like to know if getting a tool seed is a realistic grind or not.
---
&gt; How do you solve that? I don’t think it can be unless polling is changed or the wildy design or interaction is changed.
---
I feel the same way. Its what I was trying to get at with my initial comment. The current polling system and PvP updates seem pretty incompatible.
---
Quality content!

You literally cannot get up the wolf portion of the ice path without a friend tanking or overheads. Trust me I did all of dt without overheads besides that.

In some places there isn't a booth, Shilo village comes to mind. Although, when I do, it's never intentional and almost always on mobile.
---
If the Official client added GPU support with extended render distance and animation smoothing, I wouldn't mind it at all if third-party clients were banned
---
Runescape is one of the "shit" games because of their stance on addons and 3rd party programs.
---
I like the idea but does it really have to be a fucking birdhouse?
---
im not leveling rc again :)
---
Because it’s not a fucking mystery that the default client isn’t maintained. Instead of dragging everyone else **down** why don’t you insist that you be brought up?
---
Sorry but as I'm under no legal obligation I'll not be doing that.

I was watching a Toyota Camry review video and they referred to the 360 camera as RuneScape graphics 😂

hes said multiple times he thinks 3rd party clients have gone way to far
---
What? The edit was to fix the formatting lol
---
You could make casting it cost a new unstackable (maybe even untradeable?) item that you can get from brimstone chests. Maybe make every cast make the spell more expensive to cast until you recharge prayer at an altar so it really clogs your inventory and limits how many casts you can bring.
---
Or you know...just pay them a decent wage and don’t put the burden of paying your employees solely on the customers
---
Eldermaul would be better if it had relevant content. It's only use outside pvp was tekton and they reduced his def. Bludgeon is just a better 2h crush weapon in most cases
---
Yes, the email went to the email that is registered for my regular account. I've logged into the website (went there manually, not through the email) and the official client. The old name is still there.
---
Was really looking forward to the dragon staff. Sick of polls.
---
Not nearly as accurately though.  Korasi was more accurate and could never hit 0.
---
Banning third party clients is pretty impossible now... They would have to ban probably 80% of their players because nobody would stop using them.
---
&gt;because you seem to not understand this part of runelite's tweet
---
because the tweet says nothing about them communicating?
---
&gt;"And the type of people that develop OP clients would not respect any sort of soft ban."
---
the current state of the matter is that jagex does take action against updates they feel break against the ToS/is picked up by their detection softwares, just like the ones you pointed out. shady third party devs wont respect the ban just like botters dont respect the rules, so what? jagex banning all clients is obviously out of the question until they can provide a better one themselves. everyone knows this wont happen in the near future, so this whole point is utterly meaningless. in that case, a continued partnership between runelite and jagex is all i said i wanted, which the screenshot sure as hell doesnt show. you did show me that with the other screenshots though.
---
tldr it doesnt matter whether or not they respect the ban as there are no other solutions than to disincentivize the use of such behavior with a bans and warnings.
---
Because 100% venom chance

Agility is literal braindead gameplay. It's just "HEY CLICK HERE, AND THEN CLICK HERE AND HERE AND THEN DO IT AGAIN" ad infinitum.
---
For that matter, most skilling is braindead.
---
If RL's green boxes didn't exist you'd learn the clickboxes eventually just from repetition.
---
Got one too, followed the link and it seems a genuine Jagex survey. You should also have a message in your jagex mail centre if it's this
---
I did finally get those at like 103 cmb lmao
---
3rd party clients are ezscape and cheatscape.
---
The only benefit I care about is GPU rendering/view distance/skybox improvements.
---
Some one made a post on adding one of the rewards to raids lmaooo, votes no to rewards on lms but wants it in raids this community is a joke
---
Sounds like you lost your sense of humor. Grow up.
---
So are all items actually. When you get one from 1 boss, you get all from all bosses
---
Something tells me you are yet to start one small favour.
---
RIP EU cant stay 3 days in a row until 5 am awake
---
I've said it before: Jagex should fork Runelite, then ban all other clients. It's the only way to get rid of cheat clients while maintaining the features people want.
---
No doubt gotta stay woke out there
---
People spite vote IRL for presidents. Can’t be avoided in game.

However I believe pvp polls should be restricted to people with BH scores.

should we add an ability to purchase a taunt animation

It will haunt you the rest of your life

How efficient you can make money with pvp depends on how good you are and what you're willing to risk. Over the years I steadily make 5-10m an hour doing rune w dboots, dharok or high risk and doing this is the only way I make money besides dailies and flipping. Why is there such a line between pvm and pvp on osrs and 99% of the community starts slayer/pvm and continues doing the same for years, while having the opinion that pking is bad and not an option to get money/xp/fun. Pre eoc most players did both pking and pvming. Now 99% doesn't experience the fun and excitement of pk situations like taking your armour off, veng and get hit high, equip your dh and stacking your opponent out for a 5m+ drop in a couple game ticks. This requires skills that you need to learn over periods of time while pking with low risk like rune, scim and ags. With d boots risk you can also make the same if not more profit than pvm. It's not all about rng as non-pkers say. If you're decent at click speed/accuracy, know when to use the right heal combo's and are fast with f-keys, you'll easily make mills per hr while having fun
---
Do you think soloing sara is even remotely viable at 85 defence/99 range/rigour? I assume youre using ultra max gear with twisted bow and all upsurd bullshit. What about us normal players?
---
Whats to understand?
---
Wise old man needed the money.
---
Only about 2 or 3 TOG runs honestly. I don't run over there right away and play casually. The post was more directed at the fact that 20k xp in Runecraft provided a higher rank boost than 500k slayer xp.
---
the avernic hilt
---
Aren't they tics?
---
95 slayer isnt elite?
---
Being called a tool is pretty tame for this community at least
---
personally, I voted no to every tradable reward. LMS already has an issue with bot farms abusing it to make money, why increase their profits even more?
---
solve the bot problem and sure, ill vote for tradable rewards.
---
because the majority of plugins in runelite not to mention the extreme cheat clients drag the integrity of the game down
---
If you thought this was annoying wait till you do mournings end part 2
---
Yup, like many suggestions. it sounds like a good idea on paper
---
Man gray shirt just left hanging there.
---
At least they arent elderscrolls online. The game completely depends on user made addons. The default game does not even have, I shit you not, a minimap.
---
I honestly don't understand why PKers complain.
---
There are plenty of ways to kills your opponents, anchor/gmaul/dds/ags/balista/throwing axe/dh axe/veng/claws/elder maul/dhally/mace/warhammer/ss/obby. You also have worlds dedicated to fight (BH/PVP worlds) where you can find easy targets. 
---
What exactly do they want out of pking?
---
Kreeara had a crush on Zilyana so he gave her his cbow but then she friend zoned him and got with Chad instead
---
I agree with every single comment in this thread.
---
Why are we suddenly using NMZ as model content?
---
I'm not saying imbues should come from LMS but would argue that saying "because imbues don't match LMS thematically" is a silly thing to say when they come from NMZ
---
because if you were supposed to be able to see the whole course at once the course would have been designed like that. its just 1 more interaction the client removes you from having to do
---
How? Avernic was never able to be disassembled back after being used on ddef
---
But that's green tears, you're losing potential xp.
---
&gt;Even something as beneficial as d912pxy for GW2 didn't get immediate trusting response from the community.
---
except in this case we are addressing an open source software that have been acknowledged by the official game devs and used by several high end accounts and streamers. yes, i wouldnt say the risk is literally non-existent, but theres a difference between being critical and being narrow minded.
---
I laughed so hard, my drink came out of my nose
---
'efficiencyscape nerds' are largely against the 3rd party clients because they ruin game integrity. 
---
the people you see in this thread saying they will quit are not the high level community
---
The issue is that its not a meme, its a catch-all response you can use to any update you dont like. Its not even criticism, its just like saying "lmao k" after someone PKs you.
---
Dude they did a great frigging job on LMS, it doesnt get better than this for a pvp minigame. Can we please add some useful rewards keep the players up?
---
Not really, autumn elegy just wants what's best for his pride and accomplishment

Bonds are a consumable item. If less people buy bonds for whatever reason the stock in game falls and therefore price shoots up. When the market get flooded with bonds they drop.

Tbf he is almost maxed. But there will always be stuff to do in OSRS.

How do you feel about screen markers that you can put to show where to put your mouse before to finish the obstacle you’re on?

How many kills per trip is optimal?

How do the pvp updates solve those problems lol

mhmm
---
Does it really take you a minute though?
---
First people were saying pay for convenience, now pay to progress? If spendong money besides the sub fee gives you any sort of edge over someone who doesn't spend money its p2w.
---
Oh I know, usually what I do, but it was in between kills and I was taking a drink of water with one hand and right click dropping with the other cause I wasn’t pressed for time and just miss clicked lol

My first award ever is a osrs weed joke lmao love it

ZMI is nowhere even remotely close to doing 77 agility.  At 60 agility you can go to werewolf and easily get 60-65k/hr not even being tick perfect on the obstacles....60-69 rc at ZMI is only 32k/hr
---
Runic orbs looked great, taunt emote was cool. I dont think tsotd or revs needed a buff so we agree there but idk man. Looks like spite voting to me, was the same shit when they were going to give 1def the ability to wear god dhide chaps and it didnt pass, like what reason is there not to, its colored pants ffs lol.

Yea its pretty rough to play on the normal one on 1440p imagine if people play on a 4k monitor lol

I would just get a full inventory of accumulators and go back whenever i ran out. I still have like 17 of them in my bank lol.

Obvious upgrades are trident of the swamp/seas, blowpipe (or at least rune arrows), occult, book of darkness/unholy book. Instead of mystics use DH body and veracs skirt and bring the dhide. Whip and defender for kill count.

Jagex needs to ban it or support it, just stop sitting on the fence with this "use at your own risk" shit.

Time to finally get a fire cape and a lance!

Where do these mfs take this money from, they might as well buy you tube

Without click boxes nobody in their right mind would do the agility course in that desert town. Almost nobody does anyway, but those like me who do couldn't do it without click boxes because it'd be slower than courses 20 levels lower. It's badly designed. There are specific spots on other courses that have issues for me and aren't where I think they should be logically. But that damn desert course is cancer all over.

Completely forgot that you used to not even get the items that the people you pked dropped...
---
Imagine how I felt when I was watching videos on a different game entirely and the youtuber came out with this bs (destiny 2)
---
The account was banned for selling their bank 
---
Later, they get an email asking for feedback...
---
'hey, how'd you like being banned?'
---
For sure!
---
Whatevs, just thought you were solely blaming parents when you used nah blame yourselves line.
---
I got phoenix on 4 kc, was very tempted to never do it again for the bragging rights. It's too good exp though
---
Just got scammed out of my bank cause im retarded. It was only 100 mill. I have base 90 combat and bout lvl in most skills pr higher. I have full void, all rings imbued still. What can i do to start rebuilding. Im on mobile too.
---
I always appreciate when they put them at the end or the video instead ofbthe start that way I can just x out
---
Runecrafting is perfectly fine. The XP rates are perfectly fine. Put on Netflix and enjoy the chill ride like the rest of us. I like logging in and doing some Runecrafting. It's a simple activity to just relax with.
---
Because it’s more fitting as a reward from raids. Makes sense.
---
Why?
---
Does it, though? It gets rid of one extra click, and I guess if you add them up over time it gets rid of a lot of clicks, yeah.
---
But it's still a lot of clicks (two instead of three) and a lot of mouse movement and it still requires attention.
---
An inventory is 28 bones; for people who AFK, it'd be two clicks instead of three. For people that click manually, it'd be 56 instead of 84.
---
56 is still a big number. Yeah, it's 28 less than 84, but it's still big.
---
You said earlier that results are what matters; I'd wager that most people like me will see 56 clicks and continue AFKing in peace and the people that already did 84 clicks will do 56. So the results would still be the same.
---
Hard is only 1 tele to Nardah daily I think, elite you have unlimited tele to kalphite cave or nardah. So it's probably faster to glory&gt;shortcut&gt;carpet to bandit camp/pollinveach compared to the 1 nardah tele. Would only really be used for the hard+ clues in that area though I think.
---
Oh then 100% a meme that Jagex did because it was quick and got popular on reddit then.
---
When is the dp?
---
Same here, didnt hear anything about drew
---
Right?! Gotta get pked every other trip for it to not be worth it. Protip: Use a PvP world, 1 invent of bones at a time, once used bones suicide and respawn next to the bank. I was getting 400k+ xp/hr doing wildy alter and saved way over half the cash.
---
too mutch information gl account see ya bud while rebuilding
---
Very fair point. I agree with how out of place nmz and its rewards are.
---
Meanwhile I got my fire cape at 81 and now I’m doing vorkath at 97 with no money what so ever. The other day I saw a 105 saying I gave him confidence to do vorkath and fire cape. It made me cry a lil bit because I don’t think I’m top tier good whatsoever. There will always be someone worse than you. So don’t be ashamed of completing something at whatever level you are at. Take your time and enjoy the game ;)
---
&gt; Your suggestion is much more natural, and you could think of this in a realistic way: it’s going to take more than one battered and broken sword to make a new one the exact same as before. So its much more logical to require two broken swords to make a new one.
---
Thanks, that makes for a good explanation in-game should they ever pass. It makes sense that weapons from the 3rd age like these are fragile, albeit very powerful when used.
---
I'm so triggered that it doesn't reach all the way to the GE shortcut
---
What’s your argument against how the Staff of Light or Blessed Sara Sword are made?
---
Thats my way of grinding 😖
---
clue good, do yer clue, get good, profit.
---
I actually opened my POH and hosted for the first time in a long time last night.
---
New POH advertising board is amazing. I had a house full of people the entire time I was there and I didn't have to configure any bots to advertise for me in order to achieve that.
---
This update is a very welcome one. The only people I can see actually being mad at its existence are those who used to extort and harass others for their traffic. So I guess the drama makes sense.
---
But this update will surely work itself around. I can't see those hosting problems being problems anymore. If these big names stop hosting, there are plenty of us willing to take their spot and open our POH to the public.
---
Pretty sure this is just from the recent bout of phishing emails
---
Why is it more fitting ?
---
If it was real expensive and the animation lasted several seconds it'd be balanced and offer a legit way to tank at some bosses
---
&gt;PvP implies that 2 players are fighting.
---
No it doesn't.
---
&gt;Wilderness is mostly a guy fighting someone running away.
---
Source?
---
&gt;And I’d argue, based on every single torvesta video ever, that the only high risk in wilderness is by PvMers who forget to turn off withdraw all at the bank.
---
So your evidence of the only people high risking in the wilderness being PvMers are videos of a guy searching the wilderness looking for high risk pvmers. Interesting.
---
You're asking me to help support a broken system.
---
I refuse on principle.
---
Perfect. Just start it up to the point where you get to the 2nd island. I’ll link you to the guide/vid in a bit.
---
Yes and no, they said they could probably make it work but only on monsters that aggro you anyway
---
By the way, who do I gotta cannon to get med clues? Some type of guard? Where?
---
Runelite is only saying this because they want osrs to buy them out. It would be a huge payout for them plus they get a job
---
I died only once to Galvek and like 8 times to jad. I think it all depends on when you’re doing it on your rs playthrough
---
Falador is usually where people do that
---
Never understood these games. If I was gonna be a whale on something it would be an actual P2W MMO so I could be a god in an actual game.
---
Gracias, mi amigo.
---
hell just being able to click the  bankers and it opens the bank. or the grand exchange guy.    seeing my pot boost before drinking them.    right click to lookup players,   grand exchange live price updates.  all that shit and much more i take for granted.   but the biggest for me is the default click changes. so "Talk" isnt the first option on everything
---
I think you missed the point.
---
You can just as easily lose all your shit PvM'ing when the server gets DDoS'd - for example you die to a demonic gorilla because the server doesn't register your prayer changes and you can't log back in after you die to get your shit.
---
I love the accomplishment progression in this game. Now, you're celebrating your conquest of the Fight Caves. Give it another year and you just may be accepting Jad tasks with glee, happy to get another easy 30k chunk of Slayer experience. 
---
Grats on the cheese! :D
---
Correct, but there is trouver parchment now which causes items to break above 20 instead of loss, but it is fairly expensive, and it's an LMS reward, which I think is good but probably needs to be balanced a little better.
---
Dwh lowers def by %. Bgs by hard number. So effectively DWH should be used first as it lowers def by % and if someone already lowered the defence it's not going to be as much.
---
What level do most people get firecape at?            
---
I got it at 93 iirc, but I only went for it because I saw a level 86 with it on and felt embarrassed by his glorious presence in my proximity.
---
They use temporary emails. like 10 min emails.
---
You know what? 
---
You’re right. I’m angry at people that treat others so horribly. Do you understand how awful that comment you left was? That this happens to people all the time across the world? Sex trafficking is a thing. 
---
What if it was your mother, or sister, or SO, or friend? Your daughter? What if someone hurt them and you could do nothing at all?
---
Dear god. Why? Why are you and so many others like this? Is it a crime to show others decency? Why does being a sadistic, terrible, cruel person who takes advantage of others, hurts them, and gains pleasure from doing so someone you aspire to be? 
---
I made a mistake to come here. People across reddit usually don’t have a healthy view of women anyway.
---
I hope you all change with time.
---
Bye.
---
no they aren't lol, tribot has a zulrah script with a huge goldfarming userbase. Theres one guy at the top who has made over 1T gp from his farm logged.
---
I just started a F2P UIM too, I’m in college as well, add me : UIM Milkmaid
---
There's other games that let you get items from other players you pk, but they are all older games like osrs.
---
Revs doesn't really hold a candle to vorkath and Zulrah
---
This comment chain got less and less funny each comment
---
Not every reward failed the poll. Most of the rewards from the original LMS rewards poll passed. 
---
People are clearly fine with LMS rewards that are relevant to LMS. How is an elder maul clamp or clue scroll relevant to LMS?
---
You get deleted.
---
Nice, I'm glad they've done this. I didn't like the the way the items were balanced
---
AFK Arena is dethroning them, and it's hella f2p friendly. Thought maybe RAID was the same, gave it a try, boy. No thanks guys I'm not rich enough.
---
Well? Did you answer it or what?
---
I live down the street from a weed shop. Half the employees there play this game.
---
It sucked ass so much
---
&gt;Really only an issue if you arent paying attention to who has attacked you.
---
Please tell me how paying attention is going to fix people logging in on top of each other and/or having indistinguishably similar names. Handwaving away a very real and serious concern is not how you get people to come to a compromise.
---
4k+ duels, now that’s addiction
---
This is PVEScape, gl with that wishful thinking. If you want better PVP weapons vote for better PVE content.

Its not just 84 to 56 clicks, without menu entry swapper, even if you use ahk, its not easy to perfectly 1 tick the bones. Its right click, move to option, click, move to altar, click, move to next bone

Click, move to altar, click, move to next bone. Its much easier and more consistent

The biggest problem is its TOO EASY to camp. Think about it.. Revenants do ZERO damage, its all multi combat for teams.. people who are protects are only protected in the cave because the players can literally TP out with no worries.

I play Epic Seven, they're also pretty f2p friendly, would recommend
---
In all the instances that do give any advantage over another player, sure pull em. Let Jagex grab their nutsack for once and make a stance and say those things aren't allowed. But for something like agility which is what the comment thread I'm replying to is talking about I'm in the who gives a shit boat. Sure it's easyscape but them having and easier time in things that don't effect me or my account at all absolutely doesn't bother me. The only reason to get upset over it is if you somehow care about your 29,627 rank position on the agility high score table. Which come on bro, we gonna let that kinda dork change policy for everyone? Cause I sure hope not.

Thank fuck we had the polling system.
---
Weh Weh.. Cry me a river
---
Dwh misses way too much to be effective. I've tanked using dwh with almost maxed stats and gear and my dps were complaining about how I was barely hitting graardor. I swapped to bgs the following trip and I was hitting graardor much more consistently and as a result we were getting way more kills per trip and killing him way faster. The problem with your argument is you're overlooking the weapon's consistency, which at bandos it has none.
---
A really good way to check would be to use an osrs combat level calculator online. That’s what I’ve used when I’m trying to boost my combat level. I believe it’s the lower combat stats that raise it up more, so if you have high melee stats but a low ranged stat, if you get the ranged stat up, your combat level will increase by a lot more
---
And more commonly those people are wrong 100% of the time regardless of context.  Lol.  I used a percentage btw, but I think most people understand those anyways
---
It’s a formula based upon all your different combat styles.
---
For instance if you only train strength, eventually you’ll have to gain quite a few strength levels to level up. Yet if you train attack, strength, and defense your combat level will raise higher.
---
Post us a picture of your stats and maybe we can help by suggesting some quests to boost your combat level!
---
According to JagexSearcher it is in fact legitimate. I contacted them via twitter if you trust them as legitimate source. I can edit in a link later if anyone wants it. They said they would look into what happened to the names shown in the e-mail when they get in on Monday. As for the inbox in game it is supposedly slow and will roll out over time.

Ok mr. critical thinking why are pvp polls failing when pvp players want to see updates to the game? Be concise, a wall of text doesn't equate to a well thought out response.
---
shitpost
---
tell that to the birds
---
is there any truth to the idea that using names like xgrace or drewg are more likely to make your house become popular cause the letters are all located close together on a keyboard and therefore easier to type in quickly?
---
a large number of people only looked at one factor: does it benefit pvpers in any way? if the answer was yes then they voted no, that's why even things like the taunt failed
---
Can we stop taking clandestine photos of people without their knowledge?

That's your GUID name. AKA your character's true name, AKA what your name reverts to when your name has been stripped for inactivity. Your "Bon3rpill69" username or whatever is pretty much a cosmetic moniker, your Global User I.D. is what the server uses to communicate thats you, it's what it even uses to parse what your cosmetic name is.

---
Not OP, but the TL;DR seems to be something like :
---
Hosting was good money and increased the status of the hosters in osrs to physcopath levels where they were (and expected to be) treated like kings. There were whole strategies and nasty stuff developed to bring in the most people, as more people = more donations.
---
For me - I don't recall what year I started playing but it was long before 2011, I think 2005? Lots changed during that time (including me personally), eventually pushing me to quit. Random list of things that come to mind when I try to figure out why exactly I stopped playing:
---
* many of my friends no longer played
---
* I didn't enjoy the pk scene near the end of my time
---
* didn't love summoning (was already max combat when it came out, which made the charm grind miserable)
---
* removal of free trade was the worst
---
* BH crater was terrible
---
* never got into dungeoneering
---
The weird thing was that I never decided 'yep, I'm going to quit'. I just kind of stopped logging on (I assume as I wasn't having fun anymore), and next thing you know it had been 5+ years.
---
smh isnt even running riced i3 gaps on arch linux smh my head not a true gamer

Is this the dude who hit 40s in the cutscene for a quest? I don't remember anything else other than that part
---
There's two different types of "aggro" though. There's your character aggro, that causes monsters to target your character when you are nearby them. 
---
The second type of aggro is *who* a monster targets when there's multiple people nearby. 
---
Character aggro is refreshed when you enter a new chunk of the map. (Or "refreshed" when you leave an area and come back). This is *probably* relatively easy to reset with some spell or effect, but who knows. 
---
Monster aggro is very likely coded in some silly ways that do not lend well to being able to switch it on the fly. 
---
But in short, they are not the same and a single spell that tries to effect both of them will probably not work well.
---
Oh fuck i got one of those as well D:&gt;
---
I hereby grant you the role of Authority on Issues Like This. It's a joke.
---
I'd like to think that this could be beaten(by somebody else) but it's crazy how much time he's putting into this that surely this is unbeatable. I can imagine getting a 40cb fcape alongside ancients amongst other things isn't something anybody would wanna do before even attempting the challenge.
---
Fucking ridiculous. Now we need CM inferno to give these legends an actual challenge.

idk why they never did they showed it running on the pc build almost a year before mobile released

The orbs make it easier to solo pk, they wouldn't impact anyone who pks with a team. The mage cape switches would mainly be used in bh and pvp worlds.

I can't speak for the whole pvp community but if lms had good rewards and was active I wouldn't be pking in the wilderness.

---
**Summary:**    
---
- No host wants you to know how much money hosting really makes. Because it's really good money. They make between 2-7m/hour AFK with a rare drop-rate of a big donation. 
---
Guests are tricked into giving more money with loads of various psychological tricks which can be easily spotted if you know what they are and how they work. Most hosts don't really like chatting with you. They just want your money. The second they realize you're not going to donate, they lose interest and shift it towards someone wielding a twisted bow.   
---
New hosts are are turned away from hosting by being tricked into thinking it doesn't make that much money. They're immediately punished with bots that spam fake rumors and/or tricked into not hosting with an entourage of toxic behavior such as spamming their house with bots or telling them fake information about how hard hosting is and how little money it makes. Because if new hosts knew how easy and profitable it was. They wouldn't host.  
---
Experienced hosts are threats that need to be eliminated. They are spied on with alts, caught in really terrible false rumors, spammed, DDoSed when their house is full, hacked, tricked into false friendships with alt accounts owned by other hosts, etc. 
---
When a bot spams a house, it cannot be kicked because it stands under all the people on the altar where the host cannot get to it.  
---
Older hosts buy corrupt player mods to mute the advertising bots of their competition and use bots and large clans to mass-report and disable competitors advertising bots. If they cannot ban these bots, they put up 2, 3, or 4, bots instead of just one to bury their ad messages.
---
I think from Jagex's point of view, more accounts are more accounts. Also, this allows you to have multiple accounts that are well protected, as opposed to using temp email or other email hosts for your alts. So fewer hacked accounts = less headache for Jagex.
---
if clients get banned, I dont look forward to continuing playing honestly.
---
Using this shortcut was annoying as hell. i had to turn off my auto retaliate to get to the steel dragons.

---
My best semester is the one where I afk’d the most in class tbh. Something about playing rs kept my brain from being annoyed at the fact that I was in a business law class. I was less irritable and focused way better
---
Those tortoises are so cool. They look so good, well designed. And if you kill em, the gnomes hop off and attack you! Very cool mechanic that should be implemented more. Wish you could be assigned these tortoises somewhere
---
I voted yes on the lms poll to it, it is the most useful of the mega rares for pvp so there is some justification for it to be a pvp reward. Unfortunately it failed and so I proffered an alternative
---
The real loot is the friends you made along the way

Why am I not surprised that the person who frequents r/The_Donald is constantly shitting on Old School Runescape shitposts all day long on reddit
---
Why don't they just make something like Runelite the official client? I really don't get it.
---
I'm not an adult what do I do
---
Depends on what you mean. If we lived in a perfect world where this wouldn't kill the game, the best way to do it would be to nuke the wildy and make all PvP dual arena/LMS esque. The wildy is just terrible design all around. It's not fun for PvMers in there because they just want to do PvM shit. It's not fun for PvPers because they're constantly facing people who aren't PvP ready and don't put up a fight because of it. It's really only good for grievers in its current state.
---
More realistically, Jagex needs to just ignore the wildy aspect of PvP. It's not the core of the game, and the wildy is inherently flawed and unfixable because of that. Trying to make the wildy work just makes the rest of the game worse.

I'm sorry guys but the biggest problem in the game has always been bots.  It would be so enjoyable being able to make money doing the little things.  Instead, probably 90 percent of certain items are botted in.  I wouldn't care if jamflex added zero updates for 2 years if it meant they actually took care of bots.

The idea is to spread out the tasks, but I don't agree that this is a good thing since all it'll end up being is funneling resources for hard skills (herblore, smithing) into one person that makes stuff for everyone else, and some people refusing to do the more annoying tasks, and so on.
---
Might be worth making a new email and changing over to that one at this point. I get near daily emails about my account etc and its hard to spot the difference.
---
Many of these jokes are true at their core but just over done. Like the see you next week jokes whenever someone quits.
---
This is how we unlock the new Swimming skill.
---
That's nice. Have fun being a piece of shit.

I was hoping to see the stam pot bridge

How is pking good?
---
I say this as someone who spent the majority of my rs2 career pking across multiple pure accounts. I quit when drops were originally removed from the wild. My fondest memories of rs2 are definitely pking. 
---
That said, it's just terribly balanced in nearly all respects. It's already hard to balance a game which, at it's core, is an rng simulator, but RuneScape has just then any attempt at balance out the window while emphasizing the rng simulator aspect of it. 
---
99% of fights are decided by who rolls higher with a melee spec or who catches the more timely ice barrage freezes.
---
I don't think anyone was blown here.
---
I was at least hoping the taunt would pass lol
---
Just started playing RS a few days ago and fell for this just now. Decided to go on twitch to look at some streams, now I lost 10mil and disheartened to even play this game anymore.
---
LOL

I'm a competitive person who loves PvP.  That being said, the wilderness is hot garbage in terms of PvP.  I have zero desire to properly learn it because of how wildly imbalanced it is.  And it's got nothing to do with how I'll be getting my ass kicked for a long time, I've done that so many times already with so many games.  I'm within the top 1-2% in the vast majority of shooters that I play, I'm around top 5% in MOBAs, and then there's the pile of strategy games I'm semi-active in and play at a decent skill level.  But the games I enjoy the most all have one main concept at heart.
---
The PvP scene is at least somewhat balanced.
---
I can go into Destiny PvP with a brand new account and trashy weapons and my sniper headshot will still kill a max gear player in one single shot.  When they shoot me in the body with their sniper rifle, I do not die because their sniper rifle isn't more powerful than mine, theirs just gets some kind of additional perk such as a faster zooming scope.  That can be extremely useful and be the difference between winning and losing at similar skill levels, but that doesn't mean that they just walk all over me with significantly less skill all the time.  Skill is what typically decides matches more than anything else.
---
I can go into Starcraft PvP and it is legitimately even, the match starts out with a mostly mirrored map and equal numbers of worker units on each side.  The races are different, but mostly balanced against each other despite those differences.  Skill is what typically decides matches more than anything else.
---
And yet to be highly competitive in the wilderness in RS, you need to create a special account and train it perfectly leveled and then send it gear from your main account.  That alone gives you a massive advantage over people who go into the wilderness on their mains.  Next, you don't even fight most people, you just kill players who are there.  It's like PKers just want their own version of the Fally massacre without the risk of getting banned.  Lots of people aren't there to fight, but the "PvP" includes killing them anyways.  What the fuck kind of PvP is that?  Why do I want to participate in this from either side?
---
At least BH is a more realistic PvP environment, but it still doesn't help that you need that time investment to make a BH character instead of running it on your main due to the advantages of having a properly leveled PvP character.  You can hit like a max level player without even being relatively close to that level.
---
If Jagex wants to bring competitive PvP focused players to RS, lots of things need to change.  Their entire PvP philosophy needs to change.  They're getting closer with LMS and BH, but it's still just not there.  If they don't make necessary changes because it's no longer what makes Runescape, Runescape... Then I guess they just have to accept that PvP will *never* be revived.  Tons of games do PvP better now.  The reason that it was big in the past might not be because it was good PvP, but because other games were shit and the gaming industry was still figuring out how to make a quality PvP experience in MMO style games.  Gaming is different now, we've broken past that barrier, and now RS needs to change or accept that it just doesn't have a quality PvP experience.
---
Are you for sale? I'm curious what if feel like when someone can use both hands properly.
---
No but it’s worth more. So you sell it then buy d pick with some mills to spare. Then sold the pick back for the same price and had to buy Abby dagger back for 200gp more.
---
bring monopoly to rs!!
---
I disagree. There's a lot of pvpers themselves who vote no to certain things being nerfed or changed because then it will devalue your 5k-risk lvl 60 pure. Back in the day all the way from 02-07 I was PvP only basically. Never enjoyed or cared for pvm other than stat training. However this means I used PvP for loot also, and its how i made my money. I do NOT see whats fun about fighting the exact same fucking builds/sets every single day, all day, for 5k loot. Its insanely boring, and the only thing that requires any sort of "skill" now is tribridding and that usually gets ruined by clanmanmode. Since its a "remake" of a previous released game basically, most who came back and are pking are already experienced players. This makes PvP for example hard to get into for new players, because everyone is out there doing the same shit; 1 tick AGS/claw and (formerly) gmaul prods etc. Being able to combo eat to 120+hp, and 1 tick spec a full health bar, normal pking is reliant on a lucky rng prod spec. 
---
Everyone's doing the same thing, there isnt much variety at all. Everyone has the same maxed stats for their builds etc. Gone are the days where you could pk with 60 att/72 str/60 def and get kills. 
---
With all that said, its not just salty pvmers who are not voting yes. A lot of them are pvpers who are afraid of change and diversity.
---
I thought the red and blue Castle Ward armor was dragon for an embarrassing long time.
---
Super sick ideas
---
Thanks :D
---
Imagine failing this shortcut when your almost there, being forced to swim all the way back, and start again
---
That's the one lmfao
---
I mean I kind of like people that host houses, it’s free altar and teleports for me. I don’t tip or talk to any of them so it doesn’t matter.
---
Imagine not having it locked behind $11 a month or bonds... the inflation would be rediculous
---
“Don’t give yourself an unfair advantage over other players if you don’t want to. It’s totally ok to do it though lol.”
---
Hmm hmm
---
Eh I never really took it as a joke
---
&gt;From a current hcim
---
Yeah right miss pker
---

---
Barraging nechs in the catacombs to rush mage levels got me so many totem pieces.
---
it must be xgrace trying to make aful look bad
---
I mean, I'm usually compassionate and against rampant pk'ing, but come on. Half the wilderness is abandoned.  The guy was either cocky or dumb, the only thing in there that you NEED is the mage cape and thats pushing it. Accept your down vote with grace
---
Hopefully an elder maul buff.
---
Get better at the game
---
Because it breaks other parts.
---
You can't just throw up "integrity" every time a poll that you want fails.
---
Integrity is generally used for things that ARE OP already but players are too greedy and stupid to vote for the good of the game and the change has zero negative effect when made.
---
AKA integrity is generally a nerf, rarely a buff.
---
PvP isn't toxic but all Pking is. Wilderness Pking is all about messing with other people, it's fundamentally toxic. If you want fun fighting other players in a non toxic enviroment, go and do LMS, Clan Wars, BH, PvP Worlds, DMM, Cwars, Duel Arena and any other actualy good PvP content they add in the future.
---
If he was gonna use them anyways, he saved like $144 total. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
And lets not forget that there are probably people playing this game and doing rl plugins that make double the money of most jagex staff. And now jagex sees that it is just better to allow 3pcs and get client work done in a way where the coders pay for jagex than the another way round.
---
What a flex!
---
It’s not, I had a passport when osrs mobile came out and I couldn’t get it on amazon or blackberry world
---
I expect nothing less.
---
Found the salty host
---
Verac is pretty thicc
---
No matter how good you think you are. There is an Asian kid who does it better.
---
just live in germany 100 Ping Us 10-30 EU Wide 200+ SA / 250 ish texas idk why // 200+ china // Thai servers unplayable😂
---
10m 'downloads', except downloads in this sense just refers to the 2 second 'download' that puts the app on your phone, before you tap it to play it and find out that you have to now sit there and download the rest of the game over the next half hour.
---
Time to play WoW classic.
---
I’m not sure you know what literally means. Lol literally didn’t say that
---
Is that one of those gameboy looking things with like 50 buttons?
---
Right?
---
&gt; You can't be real...
---
Well, good thing he isn't.
---
Well, the way you solve it as a game company is that sometimes you have to take the reins and over steer whatever the community votes for the better of the game.
---
This is a good suggestion! It’s a step in a good direction. If the clues are from killing other players, I’m afraid they would be farmed or paid for kills etc etc. otherwise I see no issue!
---
God's work. 🙏
---
I disagree, but I think that's a completely reasonable position to take
---
Do fake emails spoof the from bluehornet? If I see that im its jagex
---
If you dont want to risk getting PKd, don't go into the wild. Its *that* simple
---
I'm happy there a tldr
---
Gonna be 10-11ish EST guys. Eating dinner now and then got about a 1.5 hour drive home
---
Was it the twitch stream? I just got fucked too.
---
It doesn’t feel much different using one or the other. I don’t ever use them both at the same time either smh
---
I mean, bro, we've had since 2013 for updates to osrs. It's hardly like osrs is a new game: it's already 6 years old. 
---
Besides, not many people talk about Obor and Bryophyta, but they are the only f2p bosses, so if you were a f2p I guarantee you'd know about them.
---
Why doesn't he use his main to bodyguard is HCIM all the time?
---
This is your fault, I wouldve logged out too lol.why didnt you just sell it and rebuy
---
d
---
That's unfortunate. I was hoping to try it out once I get my desktop fixed. 
---
In the last BH poll blog, they mentioned they had ideas for a lot of recolors, but decided not to poll them as BH additions. Maybe they could add them as tradable LMS rewards, like the abyssal whip recolors.
---
the guy pretending to be aful was almost definitely a troll
---
This is probably one of the best features about Gmail. Plus, it makes logging in so easy, especially if you want to make multiple accounts. You just go something like OSRS+Zerker@gmail.com for your Zerker account, OSRS+Main@gmail.com for a main, and so on.
---
GIVE ME POINTS!
---
Crazy how prayer flicking changed the game tbh
---
Very well written and insightful.  Always nice when someone who REALLY knows a lot about something like this makes a quality post.  Especially appreciate how you gave your opinion on a lot of things but didn't let that affect the objectivity of the facts. 
---
Glad the cat's out of the bag.  Do you think jagex made the new changes partially to combat this toxic community?
---
Someone get this tattoo’d. I’ll pay for it
---
I've seen some pretty crafty phish emails tbh. The thing that I usually look for is the greeting with my in-game name so thats what I look for before I open the email details.
---
I'm so confused. You're talking about how toxic hosting/hosts are. The notice board only removes the auto-typer bots element. People will still host like they did before, no? I was reading all at the start, then just skimmed because man, it's just SO long.
---
Wouldn't it be a Strength Skillcape emote accident?
---
Jokes on them I never tip my hosts anyway
---
It stops everything behind it from getting to the mage.
