Hate to break it to you but they aren't brigading anything, people on this sub just are like that

Pride festivals are pretty gay

Exchange my move to the grand kitchen.
---
I'm definitely a 2007scape purist but I still believe that some items should be buffed or given an alternate use like karambwan poisoned spears and Splitbark armor. They're cool but don't really fulfill any purpose now
---
Shit man, i totally thought i responded to a comment about the dragon left half. I didnt know about the spears

Step 1. Give account to friend

---
Step 2. Have friend bot the account to max combat
---
Step 3. Get banned and then recover the account because "I didn't cheat"

Step 4. Jagex: B

We got him boys.

lol, SkillersL is Lynx Titan's RC alt. How did you determine whether these accounts were botting?

He has no way of getting a gold leaf to build the stash unit, however I still agree

Can i use slayer helm instead of bandana?
---
Oh obviously its still creepy as fuck. I never said it wasn't creepy. I was just adding information i found interesting.
---
Nah, you missed the point actually. They're saying that the combat level system is flawed from the pov of someone who wouldn't focus on maintaining low overall level for pvp, either because they aren't aware or don't care to. Logically, higher combat level should = stronger in combat
---
How does this work?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs very very true lmaooo. Maybe just go cut some yew trees, might be more his speed

Damn nice! MLm or just regular mining?

I recently tried said world and can confirm, it is exactly like this.  It is so small, it almost feels like everybody knows each other...

Anyone else annoyed by mosquitos?

DAE hate when people act toxic in game?

Am I the only one who thinks Jagex support is bad?   
---
Unpopular opinion: runecrafting sucks
---
obviously you wouldn‚Äôt be able to gamble money with it, just like any other game in the games room
---
Absolutely true. Glad you got the point of my argument. Another thing these days is people just assume and put words into other people's mouths lol

Can you provide context on the visafe meme?

We are on two different pages, and this isn't going anywhere. Have a good night.

ah, my favourite world. always a low player count
---
Why not do it with a dspear? Because there‚Äôs a significant range difference. And you don‚Äôt have to commit to firing off earth spells, you can fire surge all you want and then just use an earth surge until you get the desired effect before KO‚Äôing.
---
I know you disagree with me, but you made the suggestion. I‚Äôm just offering an opinion that I‚Äôm sure other players will share. As it is, unless these items were EXTREMELY hard to get or absurdly expensive, I don‚Äôt see them having a place in the game. That said, if they were that hard to get or were that expensive, it‚Äôs unlikely anyone would use them in favor of cheaper/more accessible methods.
---
Jagex already did it once to us what makes you think it wont happen again lol
---
The company that censored PUBG and replaced it with a Chinese propoganda game? That Reddit age of yours looks suspiciously young

Yah, he corrected it. Sorry, not sure if I should delete my comment or what... :P

What?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The others are a pattern, and i'm extremely good at finding them.
---
Are you one of those people that asks "are you a bot" and definitively assumes they're a bot if they don't reply? Lmao.
---
It's pretty well known a lot of those are just gold farming Venezuelans. They could be doing 4-5 accounts or more at once.
---
Unless they get caught RWTing, which I'm sure they know how to avoid by now, there's nothing jagex will do.
---
Lmao would upvote this twice if I could
---
Yea bit of a mistake but it‚Äôs in there lool cuz I had it open and panic clicked it

I mean.. he‚Äôs gotten like 3 VLS drops and a max set, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs not doing anything except relying on a clan lol. He almost got killed by a clan at one point. 
---
Although I do agree that Clan Man Mode is ridiculous. 
---
Can‚Äôt exactly blame him for playing the game and killing off competition for all that money. You would too.
---
Interns who clicks yes or no on appeals isn't 11$ customer support.
---
Alot of botters are abusing this to get unbanned, it does more harm than good.
---
You still pigeonholed yourself here. Launching Fire Surge means you also need a Tome of Fire. You are just adding extra commitment to your playstyle by doing so. Not only that, but you do know that the attack speed of a spell is 3.0s, right? Or didn't you? You can't stun and then rush into a D Claws--you could do a G Maul, but that could be done literally anytime and speaks only of the overpowered G Maul and not of the Tome of Earth.
---
I think your opinion is overinflated. It's strong, but in practice it is not as strong as you are making it out to be.
---
Only 23m? Ripeepee
---
Instead of Conky, I think it'd be interesting to make puppets of the jmods
---
Tridents also are not reduced in damage by corp, but they are also significantly worse dps.
---
Which raises the question, _who the hell is giving them money!?!_
---
So I should just abandon it ?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotten accounts back I didn‚Äôt deserve
---
Thanks for being part of the problem buddy
---
Because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice for weeks‚Äù sounds like OP actually does know what they did but won‚Äôt take responsibility. Plus zero screenshots have been posted to confirm what the appeals ‚Äúevidence.‚Äù

Just think before you speak please.

Just being honest. I was stupid and part of the problem you‚Äôre 100% right.
---
I think you‚Äôre a little defensive. I don‚Äôt hate the idea, but you completely ignored the whole second point about how they don‚Äôt have a place in the economy/PvP. It‚Äôs ok man, I appreciate people who make suggestions and I love where your head is, I just don‚Äôt think they could be introduced to the game like this.

I've seen 8 quashes on 1 account before, so you are wrong.

wtf is runescript

thats so stupid. If it was a ban for botting/macroing that would make sense.
---
But a mute?

Requires you typing something seriously against the TOS

All my past mutes (from my RS1&gt;2&gt;3 acc) show what I said and why I was muted.
---
Because he‚Äôs advertising personalized merchandise? You‚Äôre an idiot.

You'd think that by now, they would just outright restrict the name at this point - Granted it wouldn't be a permanent fix, it'd be a start to *some* degree
---
This method is no better than any other methods unless you have infinite funds to begin with. It's actually more risky than normal betting because you are guaranteed to get cleaned eventually if you stick to it, but your average return is the same as any other method.
---
Damn bro. I hope this gets chosen.

Idk you tell me since you know exactly how many somehow.

No way bro they use their panties a lot more often than i use this laptop

Please Please Please Please

What time

Move the grand exchange to the burthorpe games room
---
A lot of the hosts I‚Äôve run into are pretty active when it comes to talking to people in there. My assumption has always just been that they‚Äôre afk and playing on another account and occasionally hop back for conversation.

I know this is meant to be a troll but I genuinely like this idea

Just got my first one the other night. Never had Jad wave anxiety my first four runs until the fifth where I tried and choked
---
tbh I felt like a bot before 77RC.  Constantly going through the abyss to craft death runes was mind numbing.  Eventually I turned off my public chat any time I went to the abyss because of some odd experiences with ragging PKers, and would just watch YouTube or Netflix.   Remember, RuneScape is a game about grinds, just because someone is doing a lot in a skill and/or not talking does not mean they are a bot.  If we called people bots for having high stats in just one skill then Mr. 99oneatatime is a bot.
---
I don't mean to make fun of your reasoning too much, but more evidence is needed to determine if someone is a bot in this case and should be left to Jamflex.
---
If he plays fuckscape3 he sure does
---
o7 we have nothing to lose but our chains

Okay then why don't they just spawn resources. Your comment is dumb as fuck.

Thanks! The cashstack was really hurting.

That nothing matters til the actual poll. Reddit and Twitter are 100% completely irrelevant.

Bottom line is either put something there, or take it off the map. A blurred out, inaccessible area is more annoying to me than a black box on the map. Even if it was an abandoned wasteland it would be better than it is now.

Yea there probably isn‚Äôt even more than 15 and that‚Äôs being generous. TOB is dangerous and the hardest pvm besides inferno, so death means the status is lost. Not that many are running it I can guarantee that
---
bro burthorpe is already as dead as it gets. i dont get why people are saying moving the room will make it less dead?
---
I'm still on the discord server since last time (and from the one even before that) you set the server up. I was looking forwards to another remake of RS on Minecraft by Behr. Though that project was abandoned and some ScapeCraft could scratch that itch.
---
It‚Äôs not rocket science. 
---
No player has ever been given an emote clue step. Don‚Äôt think it makes sense to give it to anyone, and definitely not swampletics. 
---
Not everyone has to agree with you.
---
We get it bro, u have a nice life. Smh
---
The problem is we don‚Äôt trust In jagex...
---
Fighter torso is basically bandos chest plate without the def. Also get obby legs for str boost instead of dragon legs like the other guy suggested
---
he has and uses a house
---
Mhmm tell me more about how you're the god of runescape
---
????? Ok you‚Äôre trolling
---
Might as well
---
The point that has been made to you time and time again is that it is literally just a regular emote clue. Nobody but the people who watch swampletics would even realize it‚Äôs a tribute. It is there for people that DO watch him and would understand the reference. Therefore it‚Äôs subtle enough to where it doesn‚Äôt impact the game at all in an intrusive way, and yet relatable enough to where swampletics can be linked to it. If nobody suggested the idea and jagex just put the clue in the game, you wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. So why are you so opposed to it?
---
You mean grill?
---
Eh, hard nope. I easily have that.

He bought one before he got into morytania, it was one of the few things he did outside of the region. because you can't even train construction without having first bought a house

My opinion is that the temple treking NPC makes more sense and is more in line with tradition

Btw 8% in 10 minutes is also terrible, that‚Äôs 2 hours of active battery life.

If you want all your stuff from back in the day your only choice is the "most-recent" version, often called rs3.

If you want to play old-school then you have to start a new character, osrs gets frequent updates and tries to keep an old-school feel.

yeah the specs of that laptop should be more then fine for osrs, and it's too new for the hardware to malfunction. I'm not really familiar with mac products but I did read that apparently a lot of people have similar issues with all macbooks although for them it seems to be an issue with microsoft word so I'm not sure if that helps.
---

My MacBook Pro runs it smoothly but IMac did not. I am actually quite lucky that it happened right then because I sold it for extra cash

Your stats and gold are on what we call runescape 3. The only legacy version Jagex is currently supporting is oldschool runescape (OSRS) for which this subreddit is dedicated to. OSRS is based off new servers so you‚Äôd have to start from scratch most likely if you‚Äôd want to play the legacy version. There‚Äôs no official way to transfer your items but you can go through 3rd party gold swapping clans but I have no experience with them nor do I recommend using one.
---
For some reason i get a Bone comic vibe lol
---
Wait what, it's not blue?
---
I got this aswell when one of my accounts was hacked. Was nice to get it back. Basically if you want support to help you don‚Äôt bullshit and tell the truth.
---
Is that a mithril cane?
---
Crashing because of laziness to find a new world or sadism to make someone else do it = bad
---
But when the resources are limited, RuneScape is a competitive game. If someone's getting all your resources, get gud so you can get more than them and make them hop

In fairness to Jagex, this is why they hate engine work. It must be an absolute nightmare to try to code anything under 15 years of garbage code.

That's exactly the situation I addressed in my comment, minus settled. No one's arguing about whether settled wants it added or not. I'm just saying, like the example I gave, none of that should be considered.

Man it‚Äôs dust

Same! I can't even contact any support about it as they just auto reply

Sure, and you're getting dogshit exp/hr for far more effort than it takes to do NMZ, whereas NMZ is respectable melee exp/hr for literally 0 effort other than clicking once per 20 minutes. But by all means, tell me how I can max my woodcutting with my phone in my pocket for a week on fossil island while also profiting.
---
The pickup ability isn't insanely useful, it finds the wrong stuff a lot and there's a few seconds cooldown. They also can't use ability scrolls like normal summons, so you probably wouldn't want to take one out slaying anyways.
---
You can get one included with the premier membership discount, or PC Gamer did a promo where you spend $5 once for a unique one. I think the PC gamer one came with some membership time anyways. Legendary pet is a bit of a noob trap if you don't get it included with something.

Can you ELI5 what this means? I've never used or even heard of a hasta in my 15 years of player lol.

Yeah just gotta remember to immediately go back to prayers after switching to long range. Def fucked that up before lol tried to switch long range then eat
---
Must have taken over a year if you're not even 99 mage
---
What didn‚Äôt you like in the new blog
---
If you can, I think you should just buy membership for a few months. It takes the pressure off using your money on bonds and means you can invest that cash in progressing your account. 
---
Anyway: there is a lot of questing can get you a bunch of levels to avoid early level grinds. For example, the Waterfall Quest gets your Strength and Attack to 30 if you do it at 3 combat. The wiki provides good guides on this.
---
For real, when MethodJosh was streaming OSRS it was such a pleasant surprise to hear him gush *constantly* about how much better this old game is compared to current WoW.

Why is it garbage

50k a year where I live would get me a 3 bed/2 bath house with a nice yard in a good neighborhood and a new car. Most people here have to survive on ~$1200 a month.

Notice how he shifts away the blame from him self and puts his room mate under the bus, who for all we know never heard of RuneScape. 
---
Also he has poor eyesite and has to resort to using cheaters to see, imagine what he'd do in a recreational video game.
---
Tldr: the man obviously did it. Unban his account so we can ban him again and recieve a jmod smack down directly from the Twitter tribunal
---
ok

Oof just did this like 2 days ago hunting spices for Diary, cat died, got a new kitten ran away like 3 min before becoming a cat and then another 3-4h of just killing rats for Yellow Spice after I got a new kitten.
---
Thanks for the info. I have barrows in 80 melee and ranged 75 ranged. Looking into higher end gear and what to get etc.. have my fire cape also

wait no

I have 81 slayer so that would work great but how long am I going to have to invest in this god forsaken quest

I hope they also add an Asian themed land. Asians need representation too.

Ah yes, it is so obvious that is how an appeal process works. It's in the name you spanner. Appeal, to appeal something means to give it a second look, so they look back at all the evidence, the data, the time it happened and they make a judgement.

Who cares if I‚Äôm giving it free advertisement? Your gonna see it anyways since you too, are also on Reddit.
---
Also I just thought it was cool that companies are using osrs to connect with people... it‚Äôs pretty harmless
---
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling it?
---
Building your house, even if it's a large mansion with many rooms, won't get you much exp. Most people level up their construction by just building one thing over and over again. I just did the 1-84 grind by building a mahogany table in the dining room, deleting it, and then building again (a few thousand times). If you already have a house that you like, you can easily do this without messing with any other part of your house. 
---
In terms of efficiency, do you mean efficient leveling or an efficient house setup? The wiki has a leveling guide, and you can find efficient house setup guides on youtube, but IMO as long as your achievement gallery/portal rooms/superior garden/chapel (if needed) is near the entrance, that's about as efficient as you need to be.
---
Ok, first I have to ask cause I know ppl who did the reverse... jad shows up, ya killing it and doing the whole prayer switch like a boss (no pun intended, ok maybe a little)... as you switch between prayers, after each switch you aren‚Äôt clicking on jad cause you think the attack is stopped? Also you are basing it off his legs not sounds right? Now for the stupid question, when healers show up, do you first switch to right prayer then attack one healer or hit one healer then worry about switching? Also till you have all the healers on you, you do stop attacking jad right, just worry about prayer switch and healers aggro on you?
---
Try onyx bolts e for jad. I used them to get my fire cape. When the healers come out, just aggro them and go back to jad. The effect of the bolts will heal you so you can just tank their attacks while focusing on jad.
---
You only gain 1 hp a minute, not 2. And I did the afk for 15-20 minute AFK strat and the nmz points come in just fine as long as you‚Äôre defense isn‚Äôt like level 3 lmao.
---
Oh gotcha. In that case, /u/VivaaLaRevo‚Äôs answer is really good one!
---
Yea, I'm not arguing that. I'm saying that there are literally at least one post of their advertisement for free everyday and the other person was saying so what if I give them free advertising.
---
I just got my first fire cape today. 13 yearold me would be so proud. Took me 5 attempts.
---
That‚Äôs a good one
---
HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA OH GEEZE PLEASE STOP! XD
---
no really. Stop.
---
That wouldn't help him for master or elite clues. What are the odds that he gets that many morytania clue steps? Having one more step really won't make a difference
---
I took it real slow. Like one action per jad attack.
---
I used Bootcamp to put windows on mine for when I want to play. Works perfectly fine now.

ah sorry when people say PvM i think of slayer first because i‚Äôve never done bossing
---
It's above my cash stack as well
---
Let me preface my answer with I‚Äôm about to go to sleep so feel free to respond but I probably won‚Äôt till the morning. 
---
1.) switching prayers does not stop your bp‚Äôing jad. So thats one less thing you need to worry about. Up until jad I actually keep auto on but that‚Äôs more for when you have experience and are trying for new personal best time. 
---
2.) you are right and it‚Äôs the range attack. So after you kill the orange mager and waiting for jad turn on pray range.
---
3A.) do you have rigour or eagle eye, regardless I hope when you are facing the 2 magers that you leave orange for last so 1 you know where jad will show up but you turn off auto before attacking orange and then do the service on your acct. switch darts if you want, brew up beyond your max hp, drink some sips of super restore to fill up prayer and drink range pot. Back to rigour and eagle, if you have rigour I recommend having it on all times with jad and if it‚Äôs eagle screw it and keep it off so you don‚Äôt have to worry about prayer level. I get rigour uses up prayer quicker but the huge increase in dps I think is worth it for trying to get cape for the first time.
---
3B.) aggro the healers... because you just want cape you can do the easier but longer jad kill option. Instead of trying to aggro each healer as it shows up which you will do once you have like 5-7 kills under your belt, you can let them all go to jad let them heal him a little bit then try to get them aggro on you(I do bp on rapid but you should for now have it on defense so you can be further away from jad. It sucks that jad will get to heal but having a solid ability to switch prayers is more important and also allows you time to sip some super restore( I bring holy wrench which is why I do super restores). 
---
3C.) to get you relaxed stop doing 2 actions between prayer switch. Don‚Äôt attack and drink pot together. Remember you can switch prayer and not have to click on jad to attack cause prayer switch doesn‚Äôt disrupt it, only actions like clicking floor or inventory does. Switch prayer - drink - switch prayer - click on jad - switch prayer - still attacking so no need to click on jad - switch prayer...  now for when healers come, option 2 letting them go to jad and having bp set to defense so you don‚Äôt get too close to jad as you try to pull them off him... 1healer comes - prayer switch - 2nd healer - prayer switch -3 healer comes and maybe drink super restore - prayer switch - 4th healer - prayer switch - attack one healer - prayer switch -attack 2nd healer - prayer switch - click on floor to navigate around jad to get to healers on other side of jad -prayer switch -attack 3rd healer -prayer switch - attack 4th healer- prayer switch - drink pot- prayer switch - attack jad - the rest is prayer switch.. one thing I don‚Äôt remember if there are 4 or 5 healers.
---
I love when people log in under you and try to bullshit you by saying they were resetting to get you to leave.
---
Just attack one, wait for jad to attack, switch prayer appropriately, attack a different one.
---
If you feel they are doing too much damage to you, call a few.

Just one action pray switch another action switch

I did with 79 range and 76 defende but I had bad gear from the start, so I spent all my money in a D crossbow, Karil Top, Dfs, and resources. The funny part is that I lagged when Galvek ( the final boss) had 150 hp left. He send me to 3 hp and made me use all my remaining food, luckily I killed him with 35 remaining Hp and no food left.

Can you post a short screenrecording or some images how you tried it? I recently crafted some potions with unicorn horns on my btw and that worked totally fine.

Tip for beginners: when you get to Jad don't attack him, just stand there and practice your prayer switches. When you are confident in you switches then attack.

Some of them are a little dodgy, and can sometimes get mistaken for not programs with the plugins that they have.

---
I've been playing Oldschool for a few years now on and off, but this past year I buckled down to get a QP cape after many years. It was fun playing through a lot of the old quests I remembered, and just as exhausting to complete certain offenders as it was the first time (looking at you, One Small Favor and ME2). 
---
However, as I started to get to the new quests in Zeah and elsewhere, I started to worry. I played quite a bit of RS3, and some of those quests just didn't feel like Runescape, especially the silliness with the gods coming back and the the PC becoming the "chosen one." I was worried the same thing would happen in MM2 and DS2 with over blown plots and OP characters. 
---
Far from it! Both quests felt super great and really "Old School." MM2 had some off parts but was overall pretty great. DSII though was fantastic. Seeing all these old characters come together to face a threat, the callbacks to all the things I'd done throughout my journey (the bit with Bob being relevant again was my favorite). 
---
Now I'm really looking forward to Song of the Elves! I was disappointed with the RS3 resolution to the elf line, but I have high hopes for this version now. I might only get to wear my cape for a few weeks, but I'm looking forward to re-earning it after a bit of grinding.
---
What world is that (not by computer)
---
To be fair it would help if it gave some useful information. Suicide hotlines, especially those in the US, are widely known for making things worse for suicidal people (mainly by calling the cops on them and putting them in debt with hospital bills)
---
Use the Runelite "NPC agro" plugin. You usually have to run 10 squares at most to reset agro.
---
Wolf Boots?
---
I think just putting a banker in the games room would be good enough. It's such a nice place that you could alch and play a minigame when you want variety.
---
So true... that‚Äòs why I dumped my rs3 acc and started at lvl 3 on osrs. F*** that hipsters.
---
It wouldn't make sense with a cbow...

People at ammonites still crash my alt sometimes but just flat out ignoring them does the job

Well then isnt the toilet ur seat now cus u were sitting there last
---
Oof

Yay welcome!
---
A lot of stuff doesn't make sense in the game. It is just an item for ranged in general. Does it make sense that you can wear a bandos chestplate with a skillcape while it goes straight through the shoulder part? No, but it's still in the game.
---
Less sense than a dead chicken in your backpack, holding a magnet fused with a dragons head?

But the magic magnet backpack does?

---
What's inside it?
---
Back in the day there was a flash game that helped you practice the jad fight. Had the prayer screen and a jad puppet that cycled through attacks and that helped tons just getting a feel for it.
---
It's also super satisfying when you only have to walk one square to reset agro
---
Or you're really just reaching. You sound like all these other NPCs that love to hate the game. Screen me any instance of people roll playing on RS3.
---
 
---
You won't because everywhere is empty but Skilling nodes, boss locations and the G.E.
---
You're assuming people who play RS3 are there for some immersive lore that drags them in and makes them feel like they're actually there.... While they fucking click to move from tile to tile.
---
The community is mostly focused on PvM. Afk Skilling is also pretty big much like osrs. With that said, if anyone wanted a good RP experience there's way better ways to get your fix. Like literally playing anything other than rs3/osrs for example.

Arguably so many places were hotspots, but since so many skills are processing, and you can buy/ sell supplies on the GE as they fluctuate, bankstanding at the GE is what ~30-50% of the players on every single world do.
---
Seemingly not related but fundamentally is, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ&amp;list=WL) touches on this topic of where players are and how they interact a lot. **Lumbridge** being such a big hub made the game feel way more alive for impressionable new players, and since the introduction of GE everyone mostly hangs out there instead. If you want that feeling of "tons of players", you have to trek to the GE. How are new players supposed to know about where to find people, let alone such a core component of the game?

Just make sure you only ever do one action between prayer flicks, eg flick, brew, flick, brew, flick, restore. Dont try to do loads in between flicks or you'll panic. Also I found it miles easier to use the visuals of his attacks to flick, I always panicked when I had game sounds on!

I had removed the name from the list at first as I was skeptical also, but later added it again because of the pattern, though I was still suspicious about the 170m cooking xp but I forgot about it as I continued, my bad, I shall remove the name.
---
Lynx Titan's alt being included was merely a coincidence, but it does shed some light how he played the game: as a bot, that's why he was on the list.
---
I just hope the man's alright and found a replacement for constant distraction, as he said himself in his second latest video.
---
It really isnt actually explained though. In a game where magic exists, anything can be simply explained away with magic. The "lore" basically just boils down to "lol the chikin is magic, that's how he can hold the magnet with his foot" If that's an acceptable explanation, then why cant the quiver just be magic too? If you're going to nitpick something, why not the fact that crossbows in runescape make absolutely no sense to begin with. They load themselves and you can somehow fire them like a semi-automatic pistol.
---
Lower cost to use
---
Hmm, that's a little sad. It's also probably because new players these days don't want to stand around talking like we used to. I know people in real life who have came back to rs after not playing since like 04 or completely new to the game and they all got sucked into the grinds pretty quick and haven't been wanting to stand around since the odd times they're free to play they want to make progress on their accounts.

Probably because this Pok√©mon fusion generator has become more popular recently. After the announcement that Generation 8 will be missing a large number of Pok√©mon, and after the (still ongoing) "Galar Border Patrol" meme started making rounds, I started seeing this fusion generator more and more. This is probably due to people using it for inspiration for funny "disguised" Pok√©mon, i.e. "Don't mind me officer, just headed into Galar with my perfectly normal Charizard," in reference to an orange Sceptile with fake wings and its tail on fire.

OP probably stumbled upon this name combination after learning about this fusion generator.

Rex can be easily killed solo by pretty much anyone, which means more berserker rings enter the game than archer rings. I'd say the berserker ring is statistically much better than archers, but there are so many more of them that it tends to go for a lower price.
---
Seers is kinda useless especially now that the brimstone ring exists. Magic is usually extremely accurate on the things it's used on, so the seers ring isn't as useful as a suffering (at zulrah, for example) or brimstone (in raids, for example).
---
The main reason would have to be the void ranged set. With void you don't have many options to increase your ranged attack bonuses, so the +8 in the ring slot is very welcome. Considering Vorkath with void+salve is one the most popular moneymakers in the game, it's no surprise that the best ring for fighting vorkath would be very valuable.

Your commitment to Slayer at the expense of disregarding all of your skills is impressive.

Sliske was a regular Mahjarrat (although very powerful and very cunning, even by their standards), but after he slew Guthix with the Staff of Armadyl it was unclear whether he had absorbed Guthix's powers to ascend to godhood or not. For context, Zamorak ascended to godhood when he defeated Zaros using the Staff of Armadyl, which led to the assumption that Sliske could have done the same after killing Guthix. As it turned out, Sliske had not ascended to godhood but had been vague on purpose to draw the attention of all the gods to himself, so that Zaros could return from the Shadow Realm.   
---
As for Zaros' armies, the Mahjarrat are now very small in number and are generally divided into two groups of Zamorakians and Zarosians, depending on their loyalties. There is one notable exception being Kharshai, who refuses to pick sides, and to a lesser extent, Sliske, who was originally a Zamorakian but turned to Zaros, though generally serves his own purposes regardless of who he follows.

Lynx Titan is easily mistaken for a bot, and rightfully so. He played for 17-18 hours a day like a bot, Hey Jase called him a machine, which he was. Unfortunately his mental state required him to, and I truly hope the mans alright now.

People who know what to do will throw themselves at the grinds, but Jagex has a problem of *new* player retention.

The game's point doesn't make itself very obvious, and crowded areas with players around to talk to facilitated learning all about what activities are worth doing, letting you set your own goals.

We know that training strength first is a good idea, fishing lobsters is decent low effort money, big bones and limpwurt roots sell for a lot and can be obtained from hill giants. But new players will be put into an empty world, see no one around to &gt;right click &gt;follow and observe

Essentially you plant seeds (or for trees, saplings) use compost on it, maybe water it, then for more expensive things pay the nearby farmer to watch over the crop (you pay with crops instead of gp) and boom move onto the next patch. Then everything takes irl time (hours for the good stuff) before you can harvest it for that sweet xp. 
---
You need to rake patches before you can first use then. 
---
Most people just do trees, fruit trees, and herbs. 
---
You can look on the wiki for the patch locations, and then just do the highest tier trees and fruit trees you can do. Herbs for money, so you might want to stop at ranarrs until snapdragons.

just got mine after maybe 4 tries with jad. made it to healers on my second to last attempt, died, and then got it on the next one without getting hit once by jad.
---
unsolicited advice but this is what worked for me: the entire fight hinges on doing literally one thing, which is switching to protect from range whenever you see him stomp his feet, and then back to mage afterwards. i found that when i primarily focused on not taking damage from jad, the other mechanics of the fight become much easier when you're not constantly panic switching. from there you're just hitting each healer one time to aggro them, and then alternating between praying and clicking jad to attack. switching from rune to dragon darts when you're killing the last 360 on the previous wave also helps to make the jad fight way shorter.
---
just a note: i have 79 defense, 93 hp, and was able to tank the healers for the duration of the fight and left the caves with 70hp without healing once. 
---
you got this!
---
Same here. I needed like 2-1-2-2 in spices and did it all with a kitten.
---
I feel bad for whoever gets a 3-3-3-3 if that's even possible.
---
I‚ÄôM ON TOP! I‚ÄôM ON TOP!
---
I think it would have to look more powerful. It kinda looks a bit dinky with bis range gear.
---
I am in support of cosmetic augmentations to hear from castlewars as long as it is done subtlety and tastefully. Changing the hue of the assembler to red or blue (somehow) for Sara or Zammy would be interesting, and it could possibly serve as a god item for gwd, but that's more iffy, I guess.
---
Just raise the points per task then or something, cannons were a mistake
---
I'm telling you what Socialism is. It's the workers owning the means of production. 
---
You do understand in a Socialist society, not all the deaths are because of Socialism, right? Just like all the deaths under Capitalism, aren't the fault of the Capitalist system. 
---
The only difference is, there are structural reasons that lead to suffering under Capitalism, whereas there is no such problem with socialism.
---
It's funny though, cos if we talk about ANY of the structural problems of Capitalism, the only excuse we ever see is 'it's not real capitalism, it's corrupt capitalism, or crony capitalism, etc, seemingly not understanding these are the exact critiques that Marx pointed out 150 years ago.
---
If sailing got 68% then warding will pass.
---
so glad i'm not the only one lol. started saying "stomp" out loud whenever his feet hit the ground before switching to range which really helped me stop panic switching
---
No, it‚Äôs mostly just for pking
---
You clearly have no idea how a free for all game works. Whether you're in a clan or not, people will take from any person they can, when they can, and any person who assumes they won't is an idiot.
---
Even large clans have been taken out by one or two single individuals because they trust the wrong person. The fact that you think two people is any different from hundreds if laughable.
---
Figure it out moron.
---
To be honest, I'd be surprised if this wasn't already intended to be done. Hopefully I'm not wrong.
---
Elves and stags just seem to naturally go together.
---
Are you running it in the browser? Can you still do that?
---
We do raids occasionally does TOB aswell
---
What? I don't understand at all.. can you re write your idea?
---
Not a fan of cosmetic scape.
---
Lol neither of those things are true.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really mask them though. I still know they‚Äôre there and I‚Äôm thinking about it pensively while I‚Äôm playing.
---
Im laughing bro
---
B0aty said that jokingly, he still took his alt out of the safezone.
---
I don't use a runelite account and I almost never have this issue

Lol clue shouldn‚Äôt be rng bases

When you want to maz but you're account sharing with an australian

Makes perfect sense! Thanks bud.
---
&gt;the reason why it's dead is because nobody wants to go down those steps since they moved the teleport up to the surface
---
Theres also literally no reason to go be there anyway, no collectibles, no unlockables, unprofitable, no exp gains, closest bank is rogues den or the warriors guild.
---
She can't give it to you o my the mysterious box can...
---
LOL no. Blizzard went to shit as soon as they merged with Activision.
---
Agree. Hate the cosmetic scape suggestions. I like how OSRS has clearly distinguishable items.
---
Not many at all man. TOB isn‚Äôt a safe death iirc. And it‚Äôs pretttty easy to die in there lol
---
I'm 5 in 80.

Have you at least seen white lily? Didn't get my first till after 60 T_T

Yeah I thought they patched the book stalls but there seems to always be a way.

Multi-pking is part of Runescape and people enjoy it. It shouldn't be removed, however, it shouldn't be a means for locking down content/valuable PVM monsters. The rev slayer cave is a good example of where multi-pking is fine.
---
I got the elly on 41 kc. I peaked too early.
---
For credit. Many meme pages repost without giving credit to the creator. For example, Facebook RuneScape Memes shared two of my popular posts with 0 credit. The watermark ensures that I get some sort of credit if it gets reposted. Claiming OC in a sense.
---
Such wow never seen a low kill count drop before
---
I know its a dumb question, but ive heard of people getting banned for stupid things.... i was curious if u can get banned for using the dice bot where if u roll over 49 (or something like that) ur money gets doubled. i put alot of time into the game so would kinda suck to just get banned for having used it, was just curious thanks
---
&gt;OSRS is just not your kind of game
---
I don't get this line of thought at all. OSRS can be a fun game and there are activities that somewhat achieve what i want. Blast Mining is a good example of *"easy to learn, difficult to master"*.
---
It's like players choose to have a boring game you constantly need a distraction from.
---
Is there a way to see if my childhood account was bannes or not
---
maybe download client instead of trying to use outdated browser? fuking mong
---
Do Kronos seeds even exist? Haven't seen one yet
---

---
So all capitalist?
---
Multi PKing shouldn't be allowed in a tournament tho. I think the tournament should be for the best single person, not for the clans. Or make two separate tournaments, clans and singles.
---
This sounds more like LMS but with a skilling component. Part of what makes DMM so special is that it is a season. The seasonal is super popular but they just need to make it more solo friendly.
---
Ditter Bitter ftw.
---
So age only matters to you as far as it is legally defined ? That is an extremely slippery slope...

OP, Idk why u are getting so much hate for this idea. I think its interesting and fairly well thought out.

If you have a source perhaps we can have a factual discussion.
---
Might just be normal Ana shot, noone else was purple
---
I botted 99 wc thieve magic fm and cook on rs3. Got caught once and got a 2 week ban. Kept all stats too
---
&gt; What sucks are the cosmetics that make the game look like a cheap Chinese mobile game.
---
&gt; 
---
this and the wannabe modern graphics is what made me quit RS3. The combat system is actually cool for PvM, not so much for pvp though.

Fwiw its multiple times a week sort of post

Haha dead HC. Insults in advance :)

I see it now... goddammit :P

Hmm I guess I should consider logging out of it... I wonder if that's the problem!

Sort of funny because I'm sure 90% of all ironmen suffer from a mental illness

I read this somewhere before, but people prefer higher aggressive stats than defensive. This is one reason why justicar isnt that popular except for niche uses.
---
it's a fucking tree who cares lol, definitely not the tree
---
I respect your opinion, although I disagree. Ava‚Äôs is an iconic part of OSRS and perfectly captures that kind of goofy wtf fantasy that RS embodied back in the day. 
---
Also I think it looks cool af.
---
Lmaoo they're all the Auto Moderator messages, I just never open them
---
What do you mean a source? About what? My point wasn't that it was Churchill's fault, but that it was under Capitalism. I'm happy to concede your analysis, but from what I can tell, it doesn't take anything anyway from my point that millions have died under Capitalist rule due to capitalist mechanisms?

It‚Äôs not that worth it. There‚Äôs really not much point in going past 80 or so
---
Fire is always better
---
How? Are you trading agility very inefficiency or are you getting carried in raids because that sounds pretty hard
---
Best comment here
---
Exp-wise will always be the higher tier spell. Money-wise is easy to calculate. Just add the costs of the runes you use and see which costs more. You'll cast them at the same rate, so the cost alone will show you which is better in that sense.
---
So improve yourself and don't work minimum wage jobs forever.  I get it can be hard for a lot of people but you can definitely climb.
---
Do you have any actual suggestions and not just mindless bitching? Asking for a friend.
---
Heck yeah, i would be so down to (assuming it's optional for everyone) replace my assembler with a quiver.
---
I don't know if this would change much but it's a joke how OP med levels are, rigour voiders are aids, I know I'll get downvoted a lot but I feel rigour deserves a nerf range is too OP in both PVM &amp; Pk
---
No he wasn't, the 1939 defence of India act which prevented of limited interprovincial trade thus having a potentially negative impact on a specific famine in order to prevent a widespread famine as was feared for example in Peshwar was introduce prior to Winston Churchill obtaining power.
---
So now Churchill is a timelord?
---
Oh wait I suspect you didn't know about the 1939 defence of India act limiting or prevent inter provincial trade. 
---
I'll discuss it with someone who doesn't claim that Churchill is the empire of japan and timelord.
---
Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be you.
---
Might as well generalize this to the entire game
---
To be fair status online/in-game can be seen as the same as real life status, just depends on your perspective and what you want.  Personally I could give 2 shits about being famous irl for the sake of being famous, the benefits that come with that (such as monetary gains) is what makes it most appealing I'd imagine.  Status on its own is useless, I can't imagine why people care what strangers think about them
---
Though, as I am clearly extremely uneducated in this area, please can you explain to me how adding Japan into the scenario makes it any less to do with the capitalist system?
---
Only the top damage guy gets the drop tho right? So ur friends end up getting nothing? Idk how Corp mechanics work but that would be a slight annoyance to me
---
not op but have a little over 1k kills in the past couple months
---
its so much easier. tbh its not even that hard during peak hours but if you play late at night or in the morning its empty.
---
Yes, it would be optional of course. It will be an ornament.
---
This is exactly why I don't skill, it's not fun at all. You do literally the exact same thing over, and over, and over again. I can understand fishing or some shit while watching TV or doing something else, but people getting 99 agility literally blows my mind. I'd actually rather take a right hook from Mike Tyson than train agility to 80.
---
E
---
No more farming. Otherwise good idea.
---
Bust a nut inbetween rounds. Helps get the nerves out. Literally helped me my first time lol
---
Edit: I mean between the last few rounds. You can do in-between all rounds if you want, but you might be too sore to do bad after that...
---
Like everyone said 60atk 74 pray 70 def 94 magic is the way to go they're the kings anywhere they go
---
The fact that i'm pointing out that they should stop creating content that is consistent with my bitching is a suggestion.
---
I'm asking for the developers to stop creating content that is just mindless cookie-clicker clones.
---
Yessir
---
75atk zerks have a rough time dealing with the piety/rigour boys but they're not outdated
---
Bro you are the mf MVP if you stream I‚Äôll watch that‚Äôs the risk HC need to take bro good stuff
---
I disagree, FF14s MTX is much more egregious than WoWs as a lot more is added, it's added more frequently and all the non-mounts are character specific and not acc bound! 
---
What FF14 does is add cosmetics they know players want (things like Carbuncle and Fat Cat mounts, with important-NPC attire too) which is absolutely devious. At least WoW creates new, creative stuff that needs to want people to purchase on its own merits. What FF14 does is equivalent to Blizzard selling things like Sylvanas' outfit, the Wrynn's Shalamayne or Gorehowl. Oh, FF also sells MTX only character customisations too.

I hear ditter in my sleep saying catch a freeze
---
Not worrying about some random thing killing me and ruining my life in OSRS that's for sure, wby?
---
not even close? I'd say that was very close
---
nice touch, grats :D
---
1. Because you ignore the blight of millions and refuse to do even the most basic research in order to make some political point that is factually incorrect. Stop using the death of others without research.
---
2. People die under anything, everything, your logic is false people die under capitalism, people die under socialism, people die, doesn't mean it's to blame. If you came with evidence that supported the notion that people died as a result of capitalism you'd have a stronger argument than 'Churchill was the empire of Japan and timelord'
---
3. Japan at the time was an Island, does Islands cause death? BAN ISLANDS! No the premise you present is false you need causation and you lack it. Your best evidence is 'Well people died and this thing is true therefore capitalism is to blame' which show that your limitations aren't restricted to history but also science.
---
4. It wasn't my point, I am simply addressing that you're belief that Churchill is a time lord and the empire of Japan isn't terrible if you have a genuine interest in this discussion the least you could do is the most basic of research for both the pros and cons of various systems which have been in place for 1,000's of years and that ascribing any one problem to them specifically is foolish and false and that's without addressing the problem of the need to ascribe the success of each system.

What the fuck?
---
Dude....... wtf... that was stressful
---
Thst's completely random lmao. You're so mad you're just making shit up. Chill out.
---
No on option 1. This is not ezscape. That just makes pray flicking easy for mobile players and changes a mechanic that alot of content has been built around. Option 2 wouldn't be so mad. The mobile UI for things like that is generally bad
---
Calling this oc is a bit of a stretch
---
My nigga burnt out.... Don't give up 99 mining bro, you doing the right thing clicking those ore veins every 30 seconds
---
Yeah you can, I just mean forgetting a patch all together. Or you get to the end of your run and realize that there's a bucket left in your inventory and panic sets in as you try to remember which patch you missed
---
Idk how you afk agility, just getting enough for Regicide was physically painful.

what do you mean not even close lol

you should have died like 4 times :P

Skinny people cna have heart issues aswell plus women these days despise that biotype

please take just a small moment to examine my account status, I would appreciate it so much.

I was always good at fighting games. Like really good, naturally. But with that, I've been ass at most other games without putting a ton of effort in. Most of my time on RS as a kid was spent walking around and talking to NPCs.
---
I spent a good *six months* in Draynor bc someone told me the goblins over there were amazing xp. I had no idea I had been had! Lol
---
But yeah, I really do love this game and appreciate the positive comment :)
---
Right. This coming from a pvper. Spread more hate man.
---
Spot in the op's clip is better imo. No need for a splasher and less people screwing up.
---
its just banter you insecure wiener

Dw he‚Äôs AFK‚Äôing NMZ.
---
Jagex support is awful. facts
---
"gf" stands for good fight. Its not a fight if the other person runs away from it
---
Ever done CoX or ToB?
---
It looks like only the lvl80 hunt is locked behind the master quest, so you can try the lvl60 hunt from the get go (as long as you've done Tai Bwo Wannai Trio)
---
Wack
---
MM2 isn't too hard if you have 70 agility, and a long range bow (crystal bow, dark bow, magic comp bow).  It just takes a hot minute to complete :P
---
All it does is make it where every ten minutes you don‚Äôt have to run away for a few seconds
---
It's meaning has evolved over time. I get in a fight where I get Gmaul rushed before the fight even begins and I die, I wasn't even fighting yet but I still respect the pvper enuf to say gf. If you prefer to say ur trash that ur choice.
---
Jagex ~~support~~ is awful. Facts
---
All people want to see is their stale little meta, they're afraid of other options being even remotely as viable.
---
There's nothing wrong, centralizing, or overpowered about these ideas. They each require a Tome which takes up a shield slot, to effectively use any special effect means having to use the appropriate Tome AND cast the correct spell. I think people are forgetting the level of commitment it requires
---
Kinda happy ownership is coming back to US or UK. but not sure if that really means anything, considering the company which began all the MTX in RS2 was from US.
---
Don't water ever. It doesn't do anything on the first growth tick /can't get disease) so watering after planting is useless. You can camp the patch and water every growth tick but that's kind of a waste of time. If you're doing that, might as well plant cure
---
&gt;Further we are always skulled on you, allowing you to protect at least three maybe 4 of your best items. We have expensives to pk. Supplies cost loads, while u very little.
---
Maybe a weird idea but if you tend to kill people with little to no loot, stop killing people who have obviously little to no loot. 
---
&gt;hurr durr he might have bank on him
---
Sure but that is a risk you take, just like people risking their stuff when they enter the wilderness.
---
Thanks for actually getting it
---
You should look up Bananasaurus Rex's eggplant run on Spelunky. You can feel the tension towards the end.
---
Yes, OP confirmed
---
Haha. Thats actually hilarious. Reminds me when i was 7 i think? Or whenever Pokemon red and blue came out. We would link up our gameboys with the "trade link" plug thing and do the little trick to get all 3 starter Pokemon etc. 
---
Anywho we're playing the shit out of it and he told me s "secret" way to obtain mew. It was literally ridiculous like "walk here, spin around, cough out loud" pace back and forth 7 squares etc etc" lmao and me being the gullible kid i was, believed him and tried it lmao. 
---
I miss growing up man. Playing MTG (magic) with my brother and his friends, D&amp;D, beating out some gauntlet legends or something..games were just so good back then. (Though nostalgia definitely reigns supreme for some games that were actually terrible lmao).
---
Shout out to the homies who came in and attacked those PKers who were on you. They're the real MVPs
---
Takes longer though.
---
Especially annoying if on mobile.
---
I started playing in 06 or 07 me and my brother and another friend would go to the library, they had computers set up and would make you get off after a certain amount of time but most of the time they would be cool about it and let you play for hours. It was like a meet up because there was 8 other kids playing runescape too.
---
Im still new to OSRS, why are there only three sigils and not four?
---
Doesn't runelite have a jad add-on?
---
Super helped me with my fire cape it basically does exactly what you described.
---
Excellent tanking! The smite was very challenging but you did awesome.
---
Oh right because gp and skills are so useful to your daily life
---
I just killed a naked guy running to lever he had 500k of rune ore. You kill everyone because u never know what they have. It is the policy and all PvPers know it.
---
I don't think he really has a choice when he's at 10hp.
---
well now I know it's a reference from back in 2011, thanks
---
What is that art at the start? it looks like some kind of final fantasy advance/tactics ogre game!
---
I mean if you're solo pking you rarely get good kills so I understand why they pk in groups. They also want protection from other groups or they lose a lot of shit
---
Maxed pure is 75 att 88 cb and can have 4 def or 59 prayer without leveling cb 89
---
I think the White Olm would have a particularly unique niche as a weapon which can be used for all combat styles, yet is better than the Black Salamander. I considered adding a Special Attack to the White Olm, which would consume, say, \~10 Ranarr Tar to launch a Dragonfire-like attack. What do you think would make the White Olm more useful? Bear in mind, that I am not trying to make it too relevant. It is just a new weapon with niche uses.
---
Why do people hide their prayer levels?  
---
Name i understand but Prayer??? You afraid people will find your acc and hack you based on your exact prayer xp, calculated from what you had 24h ago, if no xp gained means the list of possible accs can be slimmed down to like 5-10 and be scammed.

Love it but I would make the hunter lvl requirement higher
---
Well your entitled to that oppinion. But I promise you, that's not 85% of pkers intention when we kill u doing pvm. We do it for pleasure. Not for malice. We don't set out to make ur life miserable, it's a sport to us. A chase. A reward. I understand it's annoying for you. But there are only a select amount of areas we can enjoy this activity, take that into consideration.
---
Does anyone know why birdnesta is not streaming?
---
Hmm I don't use two clients but I do use two monitors... Might be the issue? Thanks!

I kiester my mozzarella sticks too. It's not that unheard of
---
I use chainmace on tasks at calisto and vetion on high risk world. Rarely see anyone and if I do, they usually don't have good weapons
---
That's very insightful.
---
Thank you. Why would you want the Hunter Level requirement to be higher?
---
My thoughts were, that it would be great if players at Level 40 had access to Hunter Contracts so that the Hunter Skill could have some variety, use, and progress instead of feeling like a grind.
---
I‚Äôd say the first time might take you a while because you have to keep looking up at what you need to do next but if you know what you‚Äôre doing, 1-2 hours. First time, probably 3-4. What will take you the longest is probably the airship platform, just try corner dodging the monkeys and you‚Äôll fly through it
---
the fuck
---
I wasn‚Äôt trolling I was serious lol. I dont hate pkers though. I agree that its a vital component to the game and definitely a skill. Not any more or less than top pvm content but I will agree there is more risk than reward compared. The problem with pkers is not that they pk. But its because they are typically ruthless and act like scum. 
---
What bothers me is having 3 pkers in max gear, gun down a guy doing a clue. Because at that point no its not GF. You achieve nothing but make the clue hunters life a pain in the ass. As for killing bone runners, and resource gatherers - same thing. If I was killed by a mid level player in ok gear, I would be happy to get pk‚Äôd. But when you come at a bone burrier in full ancestral and then say SIT like you actually did something impressive, thats where you pkers give yourself a bad wrap. You wanna pk in max gear, go kill another pker. Thats fun. 2 gears players battling it out. But thats not 99% of pking. The 99% is trickery and preying on the innocents. Which yes there needs to be innocent players getting killed to make the wildly dangerous, but the attitude makes it a toxic experience. 
---
Also, now a days are not like they were in 2005-6. There is so much power creep now that there is no chance the players getting preyed can have a chance for escape. Before you might have a guy in full rune and a d scim chase you down and you could run. Now, you can be 99hp and get frozen and 1 hit by the majority of pkers. 
---
There is just too much of a gap between attacker and victim and I think thats what makes it so frustrating and splitting the community.
---
Is that Chymistry?
---
He had blowpipe, so if he was doing Zulrah on a HCIM he was risking 93 Slayer (unboostable) most likely :O
---
I don't think he streams, I may be wrong.. If he does it will probably start around the last 1-2 hours
---
I dont recall him ever streaming other times for the final
---
Rc bad. Slayer good.
---
But didnt the final hour start 15 minutes ago? I am watching the 07scape stream but nothing happens.
---
No divine sigil in osrs
---
Why do you play this game if you don't want to grind? It's literally all the game is.
---
Thanks for giving me anxiety
---
As someone who already has 99 40 just seems a little too easy but it might just be that I got 99. Either way it's still good. I've been wanting more hunter updates.
---
It's a form of creative content like any other, like using artists songs etc. Even hypercam has its little tag up top if you use the free version.
---
In this case we're talking about simple memes so I can understand why you find it unnecessary. On the other hand, if a meme I thought of and created brings a lot of traffic to your page selling RuneScape t-shirts, you're making money off creative work you didn't do. The least you could do is give the original creator some credit and share that traffic he's generating you.
---
Yall need to calm down. Hes just clowning on Japanese people. Dont be so offended.

that just seems wrong

My asshole went rly rly tight when ur really low dangerous low hp n out prayer n I was come on man stay alive!

Contracts would be great, having a task system is a great way to take focus off xp. I haven't any ideas for hunter, iv done so little of it I wouldn't know what to do with it. Your ideas would give an incentive for me and I may start enjoying it as apposed to seeing just another xp grind.
---
You're bad but yea
---
Flowers have a negative attack bonus so they are great for boxing
---
ely barely even passed
---
Volcanic mine is not as simple as you make it out to be lmao, it's probably equal to a slayer boss such as alchemical hydra. It's how skilling stuff should look like, not wintertodt.
---
we're about 2-3.5 hours away from the finish... Even in the Final Hour, it isn't the final hour....
---
That could be the reason :D
---
Hunter contracts wouldn't necessarily be easy. You might be asked to do some boring Deadfall Trapping, and bring back items which would require banking or noting. In many cases, I would expect that a contract would take a decent amount of time. Imagine being asked to hunt 60 Feldip Weasels... it would be much slower than just pumping out Salamanders for best xp/hour.
---
oh lol thanks I will tune in later then.
---
Hes there 4 pet
---
oh for sure. If I see a white dot then that dot will see my white dot go *poof* before they have a chance to click me. Trust no one in the wild lands!
---
I recently started trying this on my Ironman. Wasted about 500k dying. Killed him once in 10 or so attempts. 
---
I need more damage my rcb isn‚Äôt cutting it. Most attempts I just run out of supplies.
---
Very true
---
False meme.
---
Mobile now exists.
---
Yo shout out to the midnight!  Such a good band
---
Why are you clasping your hands together?
---
Sweet! Thanks for the reply. Its looks very cool.
---
Yeah xgrace is actually talkative and has had an alt bring my runes for contact spell a few times that I had forgot.
---
What does any of that have to do with the requirement though? I think 55 is reasonable.
---
Fantastic Sam!
---
In rs before eoc to obtain a god bird it was 70 prayer requirement. So a prayer requirement as well on top of the 40 hunter wouldnt be out of the question. Maybe not  70 but maybe 60 prayer plus 40 hunter.
---
Ham fuckin. Big if true.
---
Wow, what an anxiety attack that was! Glad you made it!
---
Ayy I agree with you 100%, MM2 rewards are great but the quest was really dumb. I absolutely Loved DS2, such an epic feel. Brought me back to how I felt doing DS1 as a child lol
---
Think I've seen a total of 3 lily drops.
---
If you have other BIS gear for melee then its better (prims, bandos tassets, bandos chest). It would also be better to use the defender, and pray mage and tank ranged. Then save up and sell the dhl for a dhcb as thats the best due to the ability to have ruby bolt specs
---
Hit 9 and i bout fainted
---
Eggplant runs in Spelunky are near impossible feats to accomplish, since everything needs to be perfectly executed.  Finding the eggplant in a run is completely random, and the goal is to carry it all the way to the final boss, except if you drop it or get hurt at all, the eggplant gets destroyed.  If you manage to get the eggplant to the final boss, it makes him turn into an eggplant and die in one hit.
---
Rewards need tweaking, especially the aggro pots. Other than that I'm totally on board with the content itself. Nice idea dude.
---
They'll never know true oppression like us
---
Lmao your fault
---
This was in breaking bad
---
true
---
Sexy
---
For real? Both are topnotch anyway.
---
Castle wars and clan wars are practically non existent. I've never done korend before so I'm not sure about it. Yes there are a lot of bots and afkers, but you'll come across people who will talk. As for foreign language community's, there might be but I'm not sure.
---
I would definitely recommend you try a one month before fully committing to it but I'm sure you'll have a good time. The game has changed and I used to play from 2006 to 2011 and came back because of old school and it's been great
---
Because it's a perk of the job, it's like getting those regular drops when ur killing monsters. Hey it's not a hilt drop or a tbow, but it's your rune kite shield, your dragon long, 100 yew logs, and such. You never know what they have, and what ever they have you can have as long as they are in the wilderness you can kill them. It's not one or the other, it's both.
---
Sadly, yes
---
You must understand the huge difference between hypercam literally developing free recording software vs you dropping some text on a meme template.
---
Gz! Same happened to me. No food left and 11 up left. Thank Saradomin.
---
Where‚Äôs the 89
---
Your*
---
Back before people made money on memes
---
What's the point of using a dragon crossbow if you're not using dragon bolts?
---
Damn man kudos, Ive been in situations like that running out of scorpia, and with two people on me I rarely make it past multi, and thats with only like 2-3 freezes, each time they got you I was like jeez no way he makes it now, but you did. Great work
---
So what skills is gonna be your first 99?
---
Yea this is where Walter killed him
---
That means that, up until 55-65, people are just grinding away. Giving them a task system accessible at Level 40 on does not speed up Hunter Levels--it just makes the skill more fun to train. It provides incentive, as many people on this thread have already expressed. Everyone would still be better off training at Salamanders instead of taking Hunter Contracts, but now players can work towards the Stalker's Outfit or build up Hunter Points for use later on down the road.  This was my thought process, and I'm just sharing it with you--not disproving anything you said.
---
So I do want to know your opinion, because I'll be revising this. Why would 55 Hunter (or a higher Level, in general) be a better requirement for entry?
---
Spoileralert?
---
Whether he was knowingly referencing this or not, there is literally what popularized the saying "not even close" in video games where you're in a situation of almost shitting yourself and somehow manage to escape.
---
I got 3 RC pets now.
---
Shows literally 11 years old lol
---
Watching for poison spit animation is sufficient to move out in time
---
Easiest spot to walk out is by standing 3rd line from exit while attacking, and then going to first line from exit when poison phase starts. I think random poison (ie not the one that spawns underneath you) never lands on a tile near exit
---
Imagine trying this hard to hate on Jagex
---
My last quest was Clock Tower, because the quest gives you basically nothing so I just never did it! And then it became a joke with me and my friends that it would be my capstone quest. Got my QPC last week!
---
You're just trying to create drama for no reason. People like you suck dick
---
There are plenty eleven year olds. And this show is an absolute cultural classic. Lots are still watching. Trust me
---
Ardy cloak 4
---
if he didn't get melee on those claws he would be been in lumby
---
But the real question here... what‚Äôs it worth?
---
What slayer monster drops the Christmas event items?
---
that blue haired hero getting barely any support
---
Expected
---
Ended up being WAY closer than I thought it would be given how shaky B0aty was. Classic case of choking under pressure, even though he started to get himself back together at the end he was behind by enough that he ended up getting beat
---
WINGS OF GLORY
---
Ah, what side of ardougne yo grandma stay at B???
---
Jagex can see it and did ban everyone doing it in the rerun tournament. They also investigate the price winners before paying anything out
---
Looks like your watching some rare shit
---
says not even close but the entire tank u were basically red barred lmao you kept switching prayers horribly and didnt restore until you were actually smited lol.
---
Dammit and an onyx
---
Fuck no
---
yep :P and rigour n agury n max house! talk about i dont know what im doing!
---
Dumbledore dies
---
they check for macros you mongs
---
just replace with kodak black track list
---
I have 275 raids with 3 drops in my name- 2 DeX and an arcane 
---
This triggers me lmao
---
LOL you guys crave dmm drama so much that in the face of a smooth tourney you just start shouting random outrages in to the sky.
---
Engine work and client sided development are two very different things.  
---
Engine work for OSRS will always be an issue because they have a 15 year old engine that no developer will benefit from working on along with jagex being shit pay and being expensive to live near.
---
OH MY GOSH
---
Yeah, about that. What else?
---
This is nightmare fuel
---
Dobby died too
---
Really couldn't see a random unrelated meme of the guy without weighing in, huh?
---
Ancient chaps and armadyl body. A fellow man of culture.
---
These are the same people that accidentally placed a twisted bow spawn in the world
---
no =(
---
You‚Äôre correct. If my comment bothers you, imagine if the post featured a republican.
---
Last one thank god
---
I got my bucket on 1kc lmao. Feels bad brother!
---
Thankfully dmm is done
---
Lots of low quality Facebook memes coming from this 99memescape fella
---
I hit 76 agility on mobile and I can confirm this. Just watch TV and tap.
---
People don't like PvPers because PvPers are assholes.
---
The commenter is inarticulate but also, it's a meme post on a  forum for submitting items and eliciting reactions. Da fuq u expect?
---
lots of people apparently didn‚Äôt like yours, though.
---
i like the music
---
I agree with you that there is a weird emphasis on Butterflies. What would you suggest to change?
---
Hunter Points are not self-serving. Kollus Bolts, when used with the Hunters' and Stalker's Crossbows, actually have a niche that can outclass the Magic Shortbow in PvP. The Hunters' Crossbow has a really niche use in PvP, you are correct. You did raise a concern I had--that there is not enough stuff to do with Hunter Points. What do you suggest I add to the Hunter Reward Shop? I definitely think it needs more rewards.
---
I am also trying to think of additional drops from the Ur-Kollus. What kinds of things do you think it should drop? I will keep brainstorming, but I would love more feedback from you.
---
Be part of the team
---
look mom i posted it again
---
Big mad for no reason.
---
Pride-orial boots.
---
Holy shit man, lmao
---
Hey, thanks for giving me your update! I'm glad my advice helped! 
---
The best part about giving those tips is just people like you being thankful. :)
---
Feel free to ask any questions in these threads. Lots of people give good advice. You can PM me too if you happen to not get a reply from someone.
---
Best of luck lad!
---
except for cabbage port (No clue if its actually a cabbage in Oldschool. It used to be a cabbage), what other rewards are worth getting for farming
---
‚ÄúMulti billion‚Äù not even close but is it really out of touch to think a ‚Äúmulti billion‚Äù dollar corporation sells controls of subreddits? The reason reddit has been sold so many times lies in the fact that it struggles to generate revenue. Theres plenty of leaked admin chats you can google. It‚Äôs a very open secret.
---
Nah he's still a joke
---
I never needed to blood barrage at sire. I'd just make sure I was full before phase 3 started and 19/20 times I could kill without having to teleport and run back to finish the kill. Its pretty obnoxious to blood barrage the scions.
---
We have different definitions of fast
---
"Literally every pvp game" lol. Ever heard of fighting games or counter strike?
---
Do you need someone to teach you how to understand them?
---
Took me 45 tries as a lvl 97 iron to do this damn quest.
---
I've had this happen to me as well. Do you happen to have your PC set up to allow remote desktop connections? That's what allowed someone to break into my PC in my case.
---
congratz
---
Thanks! Haha it sounds like if I get membership I‚Äôll lose a few bots too
---
Thanks for actually providing an answer, instead of being a dickwad like the OP. The context is absolutely not clear from a google.
---
It is an undeniable fact that reddit is controlled by left-leaning developers and that /r/politics is run by DNC operatives.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll look into the trial
---
Yes, you‚Äôd have to be an idiot to think that memes featuring political subjects aren‚Äôt intended to influence you.
---
Ahhhh I LOVE Castle Wars :(
---
Welcome, I did it at 900 and I'm very happy I didn't have to do any more. lol
---
Sailing is 2 times better than warding
---
Honestly usually pkers that roam areas like scorpia are just really bad, that's half the reason. If you need a team just to kill a player that can't fight back in deep wildy... 
---
Even the pkers are pretty bad, not to diminish how insane this guy is, but not 5 seconds into getting attacked one pker tries to run up like 6 tiles and dclaw when OP had protect melee on literally the entire time lmao.
---
These guys aren't bringing the best of the best, that's for sure.
---
no its me. i help him over week
---
Volume mixer my dude.
---
well done mate, btw what's the song name Lol
---
Cool story buddy. If you spend all day on Reddit trying to troll, then good for you!
---
Lol... thanks for the sad news :(
---
Thanks! And yeah I agree. Aside from the sword I was just throwing out weird ideas, but I feel the quest could have one other significant reward. I'd personally be hesitant to open the door to barrows upgrades but maybe he could sell another weapon that uses boltracks? Appreciate the input.
---
hmm, mind me askin your range and how many brews your brought? Def level? You‚Äôll get it for sure man. It‚Äôs frustrating as hell but you‚Äôll get it down
---
Minecraft Hunger games wtf you mean.
---
Called my bank and they said they aren't blocking anything /u/Threepark. Quite odd.
---
I agree, not sure why the fact I pointed out is getting downvoted so hard
---
They should reword the question "Do you want us to scrap this change"
---
Most allotments don't need to be watered with the proper flower patch grown. Example: having nasturtiums in your flower patch protects watermelons from disease.

---
But my autism, if they're not all on 100 I just don't feel right.
---
it means I die to pkers a lot less than people who don't understand basic game mechanics
---
It's more than likely any of the suggestions you've gotten and you've already used the trial on your device. There's a way to bypass it but revealing it would help bots.
---
Bernie DDOS'd my Nan for max.
---
No 2FA?
---
&gt; For balancing purposes, I would have to space the attacks 1 tick apart and probably reduce the damage to 75% per hit.
---
Exactly my initial thought, support! 
---
&gt; Another idea you just gave me, is that the Game Reserve would house Salamanders of all types, but with a very rare chance of spawning a White Olm among them.
---
I think there are some decitions we have to make when adding another salamander. By adding it normally like in your post, I'm sure we expect it to be even better xp rates than black sallys in wildy. There nothing wrong with that, but maybe they should have some additional reqs (for instance locked behind a high-level quest) to hunt and not just a Hunter lvl? Or we could do as you propose now by only having it as a rare spawn and not as a new training method. The advantage with this is there will be no dirt cheap improvement over the black sally in PvP (which could encourage ragging), as you probably would have to pay a decent amount for the olm itself. It would also make the Game Reserve slightly profitable.
---
Doable, but 75 magic for toxic trident will really speed up kills, same with 75 range for a blowpipe. Also if you plan on camping barrows for a significant amount of time, grind out the Morytania hard diaries, you‚Äôll get 50% extra runes from the chest.
---
Honestly, relative to its growth, not a whole lot.
---
If you just range with dhcb it's much easier. I've been using this method only and I'm now over 900 kills, it's mindless, no need to woox walk or bother with specs. Just dhcb, void, salve, preferably dragonfire ward, you're set. Up to 6 kills and I'm a terrible pvmer who just learned to Bandos last month lol.
---
Grind for those 21 upvotes
---
Reddit is dominated by young, educated adults which is a group that leans heavily left. Maybe it's just demographics and not a shadow conspiracy lol
---
1 Guy got off him for a whole barrage while he was still in multi. Wow.
---
The music is absolute üî•
---
This is incredible dude, I especially liked trying to make the less common methods like butterflies and birds, relevant for anything other than low levels. The boss idea and prayer XP modifier with the  birds is awesome (maybe overpowered idk tho) and match really well with the farming guild so would likely make it into the game. The crossbows and olm seem like they might need balancing but idk. This could maybe fit in lower Zeah that hasn‚Äôt been revealed yet.

Yeah fr they left the asterisk by their name uncovered, no point to hide prayer if we can see that, free acc lol

Who the fuck cares. Manked gets lucky/gets the game rigged in his favor damn near every dmm

He's just a useless fat ass

Use MSBI for Ahrims. Better than RCB
---
Red d‚Äôhide is better than blue
---
Use iban blast
---
Use d scim for melee
---
None of that should be hard to get.

Yup very, just get ibans blast and go ham.

Nothing wrong with being bad, tbf. If you don't try at all u wont get better. Not saying this guy made too many mistakes, but a lot of ppl in this reddit get really triggered if u give them any advice lmao.
---
So when are you gonna start posting deep wildy clips on your late game hcim?
---
Definitely not the first but okay
---
H
---
I've never gotten void before so no, I'm not fully aware of the effects.
---
That's what I was thinking lmao
---
There are clans that have their own calenders with events and social events to join. Definitely look up some clans and join their discord and start getting involved in their community. Keep looking around until you find one you can enjoy because it'll make a huge difference when playing the game!
---
I stand in a corner and semi-afk and switch corners every now and then. Could you show me where you're standing?
---
nah, you‚Äôre the pathetic loser who‚Äôs deflecting his insecurities on the internet.

I‚Äôm only 22 and I make $24 an hour, nice try bum.

meanwhile, you‚Äôre a sad fuck who probably lives on government paychecks, faking a disability. if we‚Äôre not considering severe autism a disability, that is.

Lol ok. Thanks, Jinxa!
---
I‚Äôve been trying but i can‚Äôt find a link to the actual API webpage. As it is right now, i have absolutely no idea where to get the API data.
---
Some fire spits, good shit
---
My wife always makes dolphins on her take-home boxes, so I had her draw a crab on mine :)
---
I will have everything there except rigour.
---
If only Runelite would ever release any API data
---
I disagree. There's no need to panic if there's minimal risk to die. Also, cause we're exaggerating anyway: someone like a firefighter literally risks his life as a job and he's expected not to panic. If you put it into perspective like that staying alive on what looks like a mid level hcim doesn't seem that difficult. Of course I personally don't play a hcim so I can't speak for OP but I think anyone with tanking experience who's fully focussed would be very nervous, but not panicking.
---
Sorry for the fucking paragraph, I should probably go to bed but I hope it made sense lol
---
Crab =/= runescape
---
How is that any more real than gambling on table top games like the ones in actual casinos? You read the stuff you write online before pressing send lol?
---
What did it originally say?
---
literally unplayable
---
That's crap.
---
Yes, but when you don't skip the fire phase then you have plenty of down time to eat. Its not even that common to skip the fire phase unless you have a Tbow.
---
Yeah. And then you open a door and have to click through it without clicking on the door spot to walk through. 
---
It‚Äôs so fun closing the door in your own face. Or slamming the camera into the building to temporarily make the roof go away.
---
You all are right. I was just being a whiny biznitch cause I didn't want my first 99 to be Firemaking. Just have to weight the importance of tome of fire vs another 99.
---
you lose pets even if it's a safe death?
---
The actual interesting part about the tournament is seeing clan vs clan fights during the week. 
---
But unless you see some 30sec twitter video on a random 20 follower account you probably wont ever see any of that action
---
I have extracted all character bigrams and trigrams from the GE items, bigrams are every two subsequent characters in a string and trigrams three (e.g bucket: bu uc ck ke et, buc uck cke ket) and do the same for the search query. Then just count the number of bigrams/trigrams that occur in both the query and in the item and sort all GE items based on this count. This is of course a very simple model and could be extended to be much more complicated, but this already gives quite good results. Sorting on total count it has a bias towards long item names, which can be taken into account. Complete word matches can be taken into account. Items that do not match to a certain degree can be left out (instead of giving all items in a sorted list), etc.
---
Granted, but it exists solely in my fantasy
---
This is like when you pay the hooker to do some freaky stuff.
---
 Never give up, never surrender!
---
Not gonna lie, that was pretty close
---
Pretty well done
---
Check out Inferno rs :)
---
Lmao you got smited so many times and they caught every freeze because your Mage level was so low.
---
I made 7 accounts just to downvote you take that L
---
D
---
I would suck dick for this
---
I suppose that may be true. I've only done t bow hydra so even when you don't skip you can keep dpsing it
---
Sad tbh
---
I heard Bernie is letting off all staking debts
---
Its a feature in runelite, called inventory tags
---
Step Sister*
---
Would love to see them usable in an ELO pvp arena that mimics the DMM 1v1s
---
No I mean this guy kept closing doors so no one could even get out and attack. Probably hoping people would get kicked for "lack of zeal"
---
Imagine being this paranoid over a /r/2007scape meme.
---
Holy shit did he really play? I didnt know he was a pro pker, im voting for him now

If you are on a budget, I wouldn't even bother with hotels.  Just look at airbnb

Shilo mission video is probably one of the best osrs videos ever

They're fun in a goofy way sure but they don't grab your emotions in the same way mocap animation can

and click "no" for both questions. Then the "maybe we can help".
---
Ahahahahahahah holy fuck
---
They are going to be changing the way it works, so this is the last DMM with these rules.
---
Just sayin, you wouldn't be eating on the fire phase if you skipped it
---
Lol, that‚Äôs not a Runescape meme. Politics don‚Äôt belong in the sub regardless.
---
Also one of the pkers runs off when he's still in multi.
---
If the meme featured Trump I'd still think it was funny. Not everyone comes to reddit to argue about politics my dude
---
alright thanks
---
Very clever catch, seems like a slight oversight on OSRS team when coding the UIM QoL update. This is also further indication as well that WT loot is rolled at the time of opening and NOT at the time of earning the crate which is something people still seem to argue from time to time. Hopefully the fix for this is a ‚Äúfixed‚Äù roll the first attempt at opening the crate and not a blanket fix of giving all crates from WT fixed loot upon completion of the boss, saving those crates can have pretty decent early btw benefits.
---
