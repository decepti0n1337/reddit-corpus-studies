Sounds like you need a new bank it your calls go overseas

Must just be because I'm a 1 def meme but those scions fuck me up lol.

Pretty sure it has to with rs not runelite. Check your settings in game. Pretty sure theres something there that is causing it. Cant recall exactly what though. Its been awhile
---
Holy. Crap. Epic dude.

I often see you in this sub, and every time I see your name I say the French expression 'Sacré bleu' to myself. Just thought I'd share.

90 prayer on f2p is insane, judging by his obor and Bryophyta KC he must have killed some 3-400k giants for it

Thanks for the advice. Are rannars the best seeds to do?

Nice.
---
Hard agree.
---
Just chiming in to say that the workaround that was mentioned for mobile also worked for me in getting the desktop client to load, if that helps any.
---
Would the team be open to any sort of compensation for the playerbase? This has been a fairly persistent issue, and the blog post doesn't seem to have any end in sight. Perhaps 3 days membership applied to all currently subscribed accounts?

Thank you appreciate it. On the OSRS wiki it mentions to kill them in Kourend which can be difficult to get to. Is the Varrock dungeon fine?

Ngl, that’s scary af
---
I don't know if RL respects or overrides the OS scaling level.
---
OSRS as-is (on the vanilla client) scales with the OS scaling level. At 100%, everything will be crisp, but this ranges from uncomfortably tiny to virtually unplayable due to being too tiny depending on your screen size and resolutions past 1440p, and even 1080p.
---
If the OS scaling level is beyond 100%, OSRS scales the UI with it, but also loses texture quality while doing so. Anyone playing on mobile should notice this (especially on tablets) since the same thing happens there; edges on characters, NPCs, and buildings are visibly jagged. It gets worse the higher the scaling level.
---
I'm unsure how UI scaling through RL works with this, but I believe you can play around with the stretched mode settings and GPU plugin settings to get it crisp and scaled.
---
While not direct law, it is admissable in court. Its the same reason while they're able to ban you, even if your account has a year of membership on it. In this case, Jagex seems to be making a good faith attempt to restore connection as quickly as they can, but it seems like a complicated issue given it isn't fixed yet. So legal action would ultimate be moot, and just cause friction between the playerbase and Jagex
---
I don’t condone RWT, also not familiar with the market of burnt food. But I believe that’s a steal of a deal lmao

You have to go to the mobile website, it will launch the app differently and should work then

From what i'm seeing it, it seems like it's related to which server you connect to and what country you are in probably

From my experience, it wont work on mobile data, but it will work from wifi. Samsung s7 btw

Of course but barrows is a bad comparison as Barrows is still heavily used in PVP.

If you need very high stab attack bonus.  Normally you want high crush.  That being said, you can refund the imbues for a good portion of points, and you really end up with MILLIONS of points later from AFKing.  I have like 9M points on my pure from AFKing range and mage to 99.

Mobile only here. Would be a fantastic addition to the game, especially for those with motor disabilities. I read that back in the day when mobile first got released there was an app called Octopus or something like that that made it so mouses could be used. Hopefully thats a step in the right direction for you, if you figure out how to get it going please send me a pm

They can't talk about it at the moment because it's not resolved. This isn't something they need to keep from us once it's resolved, at the moment they probably have an idea as to what's causing the issue but can't say because if they are wrong that's giving out misinformation.

Hey, I recently talked to Mod Gambit on the subject. Here's a slightly edited version.
---
"Hey Korobenicky. Sorry you’re not able to do this yet, truth be told there are just way higher priorities for the already stretched engine team. That doesn’t mean the whole idea is veto’d. I reckon we’ll have it eventually.
---
It’s not that we’re against it, I’m actually in favour of this since there’s no reason not to be."

This really has made my day, saved so i can smile anytime i need it. Blessed mate.

Neither do i but i do like to see stuff like this and wonder who would actually buy that stuff lmao
---
Bro u think p mods gunna run around hopping muting bots all day ?
---
wow thanks for this. maybe i should try it out and see if it works. sounds like a loophole to me. it definitely SHOULD be bug abuse, i cant see why that would not be considered a bug. it makes it so saradomin players can run to their own flag, switch teams, and capture it. quite fishy and lazy for that to be not considered a bug. i expect nothing from jagex anyways, they rarely fix problems like this.
---
With sufficient reporting and Community backlash it would be considered a bug. If nobody considers it an issue including the player base, then jagex will never do anything about it. And that's exactly the way it will look to them if nobody reports it.
---
Cause homophobes dont like being reminded people are happy

Yeah bro, that's super shitty. That happened to me on a Final Fantasy XI account I had. I was hacked, and I got it back after a couple hours. Non-transferable items that I had spent YEARS on were gone. All they said was "secure your account better next time.". I was REAL beat up.

---
Anyone have a good way to spice the game up? Or know of anything that will help combat that "low" feeling you get from grinding the game so much?
---
I'm currently grinding out Agility and Quest to get enough QP for Barrows Gloves along with some other skills to help me start prepping for the late game grind where I can PVM through slayer and make good money from it. I'm not at the point where I can PVM except for Barrows brothers but I wanna try something different. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated even if I can do soemething on a new account that requires low levels. I have started a HCI but I'm grinding out 99 FM at Wintertodt on that so that itself is a grind for me (I know I don't have to but I want to get that first before I start anything else on the account.)
---
Except they literally do get replaced nearly instantly. We already know it, and have known it since the release of OSRS. Automated systems ban 100k bots per week and it's trivial for serious botters to get their farms up and running again the same day. The main problem with botwatch is it doesn't ban bots the moment they are flagged as bots so as not to tip them off to what got them banned. Weath and the rest of the team have verified this multiple times. That's why the automated systems seem less effective than they really are right now. Could it be improved? Definitely, but manual effort is not a solution, not even a good one to tackle a problem like this.
---
Chat spam bots are pretty niche and clustered together, so that *might* be managed (but not solved) through manual effort, but good luck with that. It would be a full time job in and of itself, and there aren't many people autistic enough to hope worlds muting bots at the GE 18+ hours a day for no pay.
---

Thanks!!
---
Maybe he did that, but I know the XP/rates on that are horrible. I feel like this guy should be a streamer or something cause he's doing some crazy stuff!
---
have you tried appealing through the support system? If so, how long ago?
---
If not, do it. Jagex seems to usually unban accounts if it was really obvious you were hacked. I've had a friend get his alt unbanned twice after it's been hacked and used to bot fishing (yeah, I know he's an idiot) and you see it happen on reddit.
---
Shoot them an appeal, give it a few days, your friend should be fine
---
Absolutely no way. This will ruin my charter only uim
---
Isn’t he also the #1 hcim...?
---
But MTA is absolute cancer. I can't make it past 30 minutes without dozing off

More like this whole game. Ive had disconnects that were 30 seconds apart on random worlds.

I don't think so

Even d pick speccing sucks, i did it that way. failed alot on the mining portion
---
Nice. I could’ve sworn you were IM with that jank ass gear though lol

Unless they have a good streaming personality, watching someone streaming glassblowing for months on months wpuld get crazy boring
---
Lynx titan beat everyone to 200m all and he isn't a streamer or a youtuber. What's your point?

It’s officially crashing now. Looks like it peaked at 19m. Down to 18.3m as we speak. Friend was able to insta buy at 17.2m
---
Let me tell you about the time I got baguettes in the face

I hated doing it on my main but for some reason actaully enjoyed it on an ironman. I guess it felt more useful and the mage xp was nice.

RS3 has very few content creators compared to old school, and Will Miss It was definitely one of the top ones. It’s def a huge blow to RS3 for him to transition to OSRS content, but I know he’ll be successful at it.

Dragon darts hella expensive :( I still need to beat fight caves and I’m at 95 combat
---
What does it mean when a monster has a pre-roll drop? I tried searching the OSRS wiki but came up empty handed.
---
For example, the Wyrm has a pre-roll drop of Dragon Sword, Dragon Harpoon, Dragon Knife, and Dragon Thrownaxe. Does this mean that whether or not the Wyrm will drop one of those items is determined when the Wyrm spawns?
---
This is a sick idea I love doing peelers. Never thought to do RS stuff.
---
So true lol there would have to be a lot of giveaways to get people to watch that
---
Think of the worst possible way to train anything, and you're starting to understand what Swampletics is all about.
---
He got 85 slayer by temple trekking
---
Its not only the max hit, you also gain more melee attack accuracy and defence with the bandos upgrades. A +5 increase in accuracy can mean saving a couple seconds every mob or boss you kill. Also makes your spec attacks hit more often, which can save you a lot of time and resources in places like corp/sire/gwd/vork/cerb etc. Minor point, but the cannon also hits more often with higher attack.
---
&gt; ~12.6 hours
---
I guess it's just because I've been grinding for so long now, but to me that's a ton of time to get the reward ONLY at the end of the grind. I don't care if it gives me 3m/hr, Mage Training Arena is boring as hell.
---
Then again, I distinctly remember grinding MTA when I got into OSRS the first year, got enough points for a Teacher's Wand, then sold it for like 1.4M or however much it was worth back then. And I had to do that over again and MORE for the Bones to Peaches spell.
---
Good times.
---
Yes, it is that necessary, it drastically increases your rates if you're good. If you're not alt shooting, blacks will often be worse than just doing reds since you'll be getting attacked. It's hard in any combat in which pures can attack you because your defense is low and pures will always attack you no matter what. If you're maxed combat decked out in max tank, a lot of solo max mains will leave you alone since they know they can't kill you.

I doubt it, his main was pretty maxed out all around, he was splashing on his 1def pure as he was doing agility on his main account.

I’m pretty excited about the return honestly.
---
they probably just wait until they have enough gold to retire irl before they sell it and maybe sell gold on other accounts to get by until then so the boss kc accounts cant get banned
---
..and then you'd log in and realize the dance emote is just flailing your arms and kicking.
---
Sorry for late reply. Wolves are probably the most annoying, since you gotta go to stronghold and hop after 5 kills or whatever. But I recommend using expeditious bracelets to speed it up. Oh and if you’re gonna grind hydra you want to definitely block wyrms and drakes since they have the highest weight along with hydra. Abby demons and black demons are good to block also.
---
Wow I never noticed it. Thanks for posting the link lol!!!
---
Assuming you're talking about scimitar, then individually.
---
The name of the attack option doesn't really matter and most people don't remember these. The important thing is what attack style it is (slash/stab/crush), and the skills it trains (accurate -&gt; attack, aggressive -&gt; strength, controlled -&gt; all 3, defensive -&gt; runecraft)
---
If you check your weapon stats in the equipment tab, you will see that the slash attack bonus for scimitars is much higher than their stab bonus. Therefore if you use lunge (stab attack style) your attacks will be less accurate than the other 3 options which have a slash attack style.
---
😂

at lower farming levels, do toadflax then avantoe (possibly also moving onto cadantine and/or lantadyme depending on prices)

i see what you did there

Yea I need as many zulrah scales and dragon darts ad you can carry please, Not a skilled Pker....... Yet.

This defines a whole era tbh

1 spot open

so when you fish it will catch one fish, drop the other 2 on the ground and use a roe

if the staves pass, they can autocast normal spells, tome increases fire spell damage so it would combo VERY well with the 1 tick faster attacks staff

I was on f2p and had the trade restriction on a new account. Asking people to buy my runes off me and people legit were assholes. One guy came up and bought them, generally chill. Started talking to him- he had never played members bc broke and though he played a lot never had the 3m at the time to pay for it and felt like f2p was fine. Hopped on my main and got him a bond bc he was a bro and I was pissed that there were so many toxic people. He keeps in touch with me to this day, and has far passed most of my levels. He still thanks me every time we're on for getting him out of f2p and his cash stack I'm sure dwarfs mine now lol.

you actually can buy RC xp by paying people to run you essence, rates get pretty wild but the cost is prohibitively expensive - like, multiple rune dragon alts needed to afford it expensive

The problem is you have to be a member to get the days of AFKing RNG with ava’s every time you died. An iron full helm gives nearly identical stats to a steel med so technically no. You would have to be a member permanently if you wanted to do this and it would be 100% pointless. Still funny af though.
---
I had to do a clue step right outside the alter and it took so many tries because of all the pkers, and this is just one step
---
It died. Real players stopped coming for many various reasons. Some include: rampant bots, casuals getting rekt, pros getting bored, stagnant unchanged since release, trash rewards, bugs and glitches...

Why?

The 6th fruit tree patch. I'm guessing you're missing the Lletya one? You only have to complete Regicide and start MEP2. Also, add the redwood tree in the farming guild, 30k seed for 22k exp every 4 days.

Changing the graphics to that extent would basically require them to remake the game from the ground up. They'd need a new engine most likely. Unless you're talking like...rs3 type graphics, which would be doable but as has been discussed many times on this sub, it's not a worthwhile investment of their time.
---
It's not plausible or even worth considering from a business perspective.
---
Lol yeah you are, read your posts again lol.  I'm not insulting you, you wrote something utterly illegible and you're misdirected angry is a laugh.  Anyways, as I edited, somebody reached out via pm and fulfilled, so jokes on you.  Keeping reporting me for bReAkInG tHe rUlEs

breaking bad is one of the slowest paced boringest tv expereinces ive had, i really cant stand the show and it constantly manages to piss me off. maybe i could tollerate it more if i was watching it at 2x the speed i dunno
---
This guy is a cheapo and cant just buy a bond. Only has 550k but a ton of valuable items even though he ran into this same problem before. This dude is a definite scammer or total cheapo/NEET at best lmao.
---
I would only be interested in the OSRS experience which is the game mechanics. Most people at the time would've been happy for better graphics, people were only mad devs were changing game mechanics. Makes no sense to have shitty same old graphics in todays age of development. But yeah I see where it stands, on the verge of death which is why 1 million gp is only worth like 30 cents now. This game will be dead when it drops to 10 cents. Bots are the only thing that keeps the game alive and I know that because I have a lot of experience from the botting communities in my past. I just had a lot of hope for this game.
---
Check quizlet
---
Are you saying he should bring melee spec with dhcb? That's only necessary if you're using BP
---
Maybe learn your lesson from last time and keep some GP if you're so "rich". Scammer.
---
Check nmz lol
---
Haven't played in like 8 months or so, I just stopped logging in one day.  Somebody reached out over PM and fulfilled so jokes on you! 
---
I love when somebody with like a 1350 total level and probably 1.7m bank calls me a cheapo and scammer and shit hahahaha, take a walk buddy.
---
Nice get the difficult ones out the way first
---
LMAO this deserves way more up votes
---
You're just saying this to try and keep face. Have a good life cheapo :)
---
I respect that decision and can decide the games not for me. I just wonder, do devs think that it's not worth it because it wouldn't actually make the game grow in popularity? In other words, it wouldn't really bring them more money in the long term? I feel like it would but I am just a random person.
---
I checked NMZ I checked kingdom I checked my servants thing I checked my tip jar
---
Ahhh makes sense, just did some research on it and seen that. Hopefully it doesn’t drop more or hopefully it goes back up. If only I waited a little longer before buying haha
---
So if you're uninterested in riskless deiveries for 10x the price I guess you're secretly a pk clan lmfao gg sit kid

This is my favorite behavior, the "I'm wrong so I'm just gonna talk shit until my fingers fall off" strategy.  Cheers for the attention on the post so I got someone to help, the comments helped :)
---
Thanks bro I’ll try it and update
---
I think it would be a good idea in certain context. Stemming the flow of items into the game is a good thing. Maybe if it increased drop rates of pets/d pick. Or larrans keys, which while bringing more items into the game, would at least make wilderness slayer better and more worth doing.
---
I think there are other ways to improve the wilderness than enticing PvMers out. Maybe a system that takes risk+skull+wildy depth+xp/hr+etc, and gives an x% chance of rewarding the pker an item of some rarity, value, maybe consumable or such.
---
That system would need to be heavily weighted toward risk and depth. But maybe a viable option, and makes the wilderness more fun, active and profitable.
---
how long does this game have until its dead?

Lemme just lug my fuckin desktop with me while I'm going shopping...
---
Actually no, that sounds shitty, I'll just play on my phone.  Full PC functionality, no full sized ATX case with tempered glass on my back while I'm out.
---
I mean it would've set a precedent for bringing IRL politics into the game.. I'm not surprised people were against that, since you can't really escape politics anywhere these days.
---
None of us really cared. At least most of us. But the riots and shit that ensued was fucking hilarious and why i love this subreddit and game. Sjit i may have kissed a guy or two in my time but evenni went to fally to riot just for the memes.
---
Just buy a bond and make sure to have enough in gp/f2p items for a bond
---
Sorry tinky winky, I gotta pay a visit to sir tiffy. You know how it is
---
worth mentioning: within leagues only
---
im not sure i like it though. Right now any pet you saw on TL was a pet that was acquired within the timespan that TL had been running. Next leagues, you'll see a bunch of olm pets and you won't know if they got it that league or previous one 
---
on top of that, people are gonna start dragging their pets around showing them off and pretending they got it in the current league just to make people think theyre luckier/better than them
---
Teletubby was an actual insult around 06-07 when pkers tele’d to safety.
---
Downvoted
---
I watched a few and it’s pretty sad. The guy I was mentioning in my post was just sitting in his chair looking at the camera with a “need staking money please donate” with how much debt he was in staking. It’s stupid as hell.
---
Yes, just checked it and apparently its working just fine. Mobile data is running well on osrs, however, when trying from a Internet provider network that I'm using, it is not.
---
I think tzlzgrabbing wines is the best moneymaker for f2p, or just pay a few bucks
---
Your login email can be anything. Just make sure you register your actual email to it.

Nice he deserves the money! Awesome editing skills

It just turned into  a meme. Give us a reason to put on our Ali Akbar robes, get out our cannons and spam chat and we fucking will. Shit is hilarious. Wolf was one of the most liked mods here too so idrt it had much to do with that it was just fucking hilarious
---
I know but the fact that I don't have a steady income makes me really not want to spend money on it. I understand that it's a small amount, but I still feel that I would need that money.
---
yes, hence the edgelords aside.
---
they werent really pushing it as politics more as just acceptance.
---
I dont think there was much geniune outrage at all.
---
Sexuality shouldn’t define anyone. If something you do for 30 minutes twice a week defines who you are as a person then you loss

I read it as naughty burguers and that was ok with me.

Easy now There Soldier
---
Absolutely not. I was in the same boat as you. I had very little experience regarding content from post 2005. Hell, I'd never trained hunter/farming/construction before. But it was very easy for me to get on top of everything over time. The new content and meta ways to train things only really effect you 50+ in most skills, and by then you'll probably catch wind of what they are.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And on top of that, ironman mode is the best way to get those nostalgic "back in the day" vibes from OSRS. I'd highly recommend giving it a go.

You go into Twisted Leagues knowing it's a completely different account, completely different game mode, and completely different experience. It's fun, but the draw-back is your main will stagnate a bit. It'd be like asking for XP lamps for your main while training a pure or something.

I hear what you're saying, but Jagex can't tailor the game for people who don't have a few hours to kill each week. You're playing OSRS after all, it's a grind fest, you need to be mindful it will take you ages to make gains on limited play time.

I made it. It was close. But I made it
---
I play this game to escape real life politics... I do not want this agenda forced in my face again. Jagex have done the right thing not doing a subsequent Pride Event, and the JMod who spearheaded it the first time has left so things are looking good.
---
Good old times. Back when pvp in rs was about your guts and honor, instead of being able to switch 30 items in 5 secs and spec someone to 0 hp. The old school DMs at chaos altar were actually some of my favorite pvp content in the game
---
That argument doesn’t work because there’s nothing wrong with being gay but there’s everything wrong with EOC.
---
Select a UK world on oldschool.runescape.com in your mobile browser, it will open up the osrs app and actually load the world
---
There were text guides though, which pretty much do the exact same thing as the video guides.
---
Woah I forgot all about stealing creation until now! That was a fun Minigame, maybe if they altered the rewards (no more double xp tools) they could bring it back?

Nice, set yourself up for a quest cape, you’ll have decent skills after it

Go to the old school website and select a world beneath the play buttons select a world and it should launch the app if not press back on the page and either select another world.

Works fine for me let me know if you can't get around it
---
They should update the castle wars rewards and polish it a bit. Would love to come back to it
---
I think you misunderstood what he said completely.
---
The only reason you should feel sorry for them is because they are vilified by others for their sexual preference. Which is why this event happened in the first place.
---
thank god they are tradable, now i can finally train fishing on my main road to max while playing league on my alt
---
I think they redunded days in the past iirc, so you most likely will be compensated if it isnt fixed soon.
---
Says a lot about how this community has been invaded by the trend chasing out group (which is now trying to rewrite history). It was not just "some edgy minority" that criticized this event, the vast majority was against updates of such nature.
---
I want to link my email to my account so I can use cross platform but the "link email" button isn't there on account management, can anyone help with this?
---
You mean to say you made a new post on reddit without looking at the r/2007scape front page to see if maybe you weren't the only one with this issue?
---
Well you're just ruining your own experience, not others :)
---
In an ideal world yes they would spend your money on good servers. I bet complaining like a little bitch helps the situation right?
---
to be fair corp is also botted if you are proposing arcane should be used instead.
---
I wish they just dropped the item without any attachment bs
---
No, but I don't think they should have an event for every single thing that's a thing in real life.  Should we have an event for memorial day or veterans day?  "If you don't want the event you hate veterans"
---
With bazookas, cannons on auto turrets, and penguins who can use computers. Unless you're usually spending your time advocating taking EVERYTHING that isn't medieval fantasy out of the game, then I suspect it isn't the lack accuracy to medieval lore that bothers you about that event.
---
Lol. If you get flagged for macroing you are perm banned with no appeal. UNLESS U ARE A STREAMER THEN U GET UNBANNED WITHIN MINUTES

Was kinda disappointing to see.

I get that it was unpolled, but it wasnt a huge bit of content. Ita not like there's mass riots over Christmas or Easter events either, both which I love.

Identical copy, but shittier
---
Your games are always a reflection of the real world. Politics will always be intertwined.
---
I guess I'm not part of that "we."
---
And Christmas events in a game with Saradomin, Zamorak and guthix as gods doesn't take away from immersion?
---
A trans woman has always been a woman but she may not have been aware of it herself or open about it. So a trans lesbian that has not come out as trans and has not started transitioning would appear to be a straight man.
---
Yeah just shittier

Maby try to tap on upgrade or somerhing else which brings you to the desktop site while already being logged in and then add an email and password.
---
That's your opinion, there's plenty of people playing EOC. Are you saying they're worse?

This screams routing issue to me, and it is entirely possible that it is Jagex's provider rather than their network team.
---
I wouldn't give a shit if they did.

o im big dum

Started in 06 mainly used to pk but I wanted to make an acc that I could try different things with, the grind was really fun. My first inferno attempts were on my zerk before I created this acc but I gave up because fuck that. I decided to go for diary cape after I busted a disc in my spine and was out for 4 months after spine surgery
---
Don't worry, your rs3 account Is going nowhere, and Oldschool gives you the opportunity to redo all the quests you did years ago on your main. You don't have to choose one or the other, just play what takes your fancy
---
Where was the halloween poll? Or the poll for Christmas thats literally coming next week?

It's not him this shits been a nightmare all week

~~Ok gay.~~
---
Things get better every day. The uk is already a much safer place for homosexuals. I used to really dislike the association between "gay" and insulting, but everyone under 25 is so depressed now it's the tamest insult a homophobe could ever unironically sling at us hahaha
---
I'll hold onto your gp to keep it safe while you're in rehab for staking ;)
---
Based on following them around for a while it seems like they are all doing ernest the chicken
---
True but with new game modes on the horizon(group iron sometime in the next decade) it would be great if they could sort things out before they get into the main game.
---
Also point boosting for irons should be a deironable offense idk why they constantly let that shit slide
---
That just sounds like homophobia with extra steps.
---
Came here to check this, you are not alone
---
are you in the usa? How much did spinal surgery cost? UK asking...
---
And you are extremely naive if you think the LGBTQ movement isn't political. Sorry for the trigger.
---
Y es, i have at same problem
---
I agree. I have an ornate pool, ability to make stamina pots, and full graceful. Just feels odd energy restoration is locked behind herblore 100%. Agility should get some more love for training it. Maybe saves a couple thousand gp a day by keeping you running without having to sip that stamina.
---
&gt;What we found was a lot of the "protesters" in game and on Reddit were not OSRS players  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\&gt;in game

&gt;\&gt;were not OSRS players
---
So are you saying just have a torture on instead of fury with no switch to an anguish? I can afford the anguish and torture if I sell my tassets. Do you recommend that?
---
Not saying this wasn't fake but you definitely can open bank from pin straight to a tag and I just did it to my rune dragon tag.
---
No, they inherently get less rights than other people because of shit like this.
---
In good cases, they're tolerated, but can't do stuff like get married.
---
In the worst, they're killed for it.

Tell me how that's something normal people would get.

Go onto osrs website and under the 3 boxes at the top to log in there's a 'manually select world' option in yellow click on that and u should connect fine.

Hahah jealous. It seems I will be getting the guaranteed drop at 250 kc or whatever it is. It’s so frustrating because I grind vork all the time and can get like 600k trips; meanwhile kq I get like one kill trips for 20k lmao.
---
You are officially a Bronzeman

Yep, this worked for me
---
OSRS is legit one of the best mobile games I've played. There are a few issues (I wish we could change the sensitivity of long-pressing, wintertodt interface getting in the way of private chat, etc), but the core premise of the game as a point-and-click medieval adventure fantasy game makes the game feel like it was designed for phones.
---
Compared to RS3 mobile it's like night and day. MTX aside, RS3 isn't a bad game at its core, but you can tell that the game was meant to be a desktop game first and the mobile app is just a port.
---
I don’t think the word logic means what you think it means.
---
Jagex has a statement on the main page regarding crashes and a work around you can use.
---
?
---
ironman mode cant stake?
---
Is this a joke I’m to Iron to understand ?
---
Print screen request does qonders.
---
Well said! I feel the SAME way, but thet 🏳️‍🌈 people don’t care -_- and want everyone to know. Yet normal people don’t care if someone is gay straight or whatever. At this point it’s just trying to please homophobes which will never happen but they are so caught up in themselves they can’t realize that. Sorry it’s the truth.
---
That didn't help :/ still says fails to connect to server.
---
I saw your origional post and was hoping youd follow up after.   Very glad to see this shit.  Hoping for a quick recovery.

No they just shut up because everyone in the clan seemed to be a fan of bashing gays till one walked in.

Ruby E deals percent current health on the special effect.  Bosses or monsters with high health take a lot of damage from the special effect of Ruby E.  You switch to Diamond E later on because the special effect of Ruby isnt useful when the monsters reach low HP.
---
I suggest in the future that you simply look up what each special effect does instead of making a whole thread.  You could have figured it out yourself in 45 seconds
---
You should use diamond Ruby (e),the special of them will deal 100 damage to galvek basically until the last phase it is 20% of its current health iirc
---
Basically when you don’t capitalise on a good flipping opportunity eg. Mage book is 4m then a announcement that it’s going to be used for a new BiS item and it skyrockets

Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia. The law in Barbados is not enforced. Jamaica and North Africa is true enough, though, and I think that was exactly the point the person you were responding to was making lmao
---
Hmm did u close your osrs app before trying?
---
An overlooked detail on my part. My apologies.
---
See? This just became political in 10 seconds flat. 
---
Not saying a word and going about our days in game would be non-political. 
---
Creating an event around something irl that is talked about heavily in politics is political. It’s used as a platform for many parties.
---
Yeah :(
---
The POINT of the game is that you can do anything you want inside the game. If I wanna spend $10 a month chopping wood into tiny pieces I believe I will good sir. Thank you :)
---
He could've also collected 1 gp from spawns.
---
What I'm saying is that he's using a method that isn't intended for Ironmen to use in the sense of generating millions quickly (boosting). The entire purpose of Ironman is to grind and progressively gain wealth in items &amp; gp through activities that the game provide. Not Bounty Hunter boosting.
---
But as I said in my first post, he's welcome to do it, he's just ruining it for himself, not others.
---
Dam works for most people I know maybe resetting ur phone possibly? Clutching a straws here lol
---
Because of the Ruby bolts (e) have a chance of activating “blood forfeit” where it damages the target by 20% of their health for the cost of 10% of your current health. In Galvek’s case it would cap at 100 damage. Ruby bolts (e) are very useful for the beginning of the fight when the target has a lot of health left but definitely switch to diamond (e) just after half way through the fight.

Had one day left and didn't get to sell junk for gp. 1m short for a bond. Feels bad.

Oof. I like how your whole argument is just based on dishonest and misguided assumptions. It sure is convenient, when you can just slap a label on a group of people and then automatically dismiss their views.

Just play free for alls if you think like that

Otherwise you'll take all the splits until you get a drop, then you dip with the splits and the drop lol

What are you basing such accusation on?

During ICU, I had a few days of extreme fear. After being told about barely surviving, that wasn't the end. I've lost my left eye and come close to losing my right 3 times since. All times I had that I'd had either apheresis or venesections - mass dehydrating events. And I actually was blinded at the time. I had been through an episode where fluid had pooled outside my usual circulation and into my heart cavity essentially which had nearly killed me. 
---
At that time my brother read me the joke about the imbued heart and all the memes. The fact that 3njoy lumby had commented on this. A friend did. Random people's supportive comments. Like it ended up being okay. But I've got one eye left. The doctors couldn't say what was happening. What you guys had said meant the world... I really don't know how to explain that more.

A few days later when reading the posts, I came across the ones emphasising the importance of rehab. I was getting told that but when a random person corroborates that from outside too, it sticks more. That's why I did rehab as hard as I could. I mentioned that in the video I'm pretty sure. 
---
Like you guys had done so much. And I also just said I have an opportunity to get this shared to UNILAD and 25 million people on Facebook (they have a specific gaming channel) and thought I'd get your insights into what makes scape awesome too to add to that. 
---
Like it didn't comprise a huge part of the video. But the thanks are so sincere..  I wanted to let you know that. 
---
Sorry if it seems spammy. No more health updates because hopefully there aren't ones to add. But yeah. That's why it was up. Sorry if it wasted your time. But I hope it helps you understand.
---
he doesn’t mean anything he’s just a shitty troll
---
Iron men are already not allowed to buy herb boxes etc from the nmz shop, why not do the same to alchables in the bh shop?
---
Already addressed this in another comment.... if people can get 1/4000 pets in 1kc then people can go 100 dry at barrows. Sorry youre so negative
---
Also what's "my community"? I'm straight dude I'm just not a cunt
---
You say that but you say “no, because gays are worth the oxygen they breathe” implying that straight people aren’t
---
theyre trying to fix the bug where players would attempt to intentionally crash the server/force roll back on server to attempt to duplicate items.
---
No
---
We were talking about homophobes tho
---
Wow
---
Oh shit you right
---
I absolutely would if I could access the game (mobile only). Add me and we'll meet up when the servers are fixed.
---
Luv it
---
Buy them from the G.E.
---
Just did a trip with torture and anguish - 20 kill trip! Didn’t pray piety or eagle eye at all though just focused on counting attacks. Thanks for the advice!
---
I'll find you next time ;)
---
Acceptable
---
This makes me uncomfortable.
---
550
---
Yes you can with Runelite tag tabs feature. I do it every day.
---
I wouldn't play dress up to riot over any event either.
---
I'm against real world issues being brought into the game.  I'm not homophobic, I am all for gay rights, I'm not even fully against a pride event.  I wish they made their own event and moved away from the label of pride.  It could even have the exact same ideology behind it, being prideful of who you are and accepting everyone.  That's the message that I interpret from pride events.  If you want to say "be accepting of everyone and be proud of who you are" in game that's completely different than saying HEY WE'RE DOING A PRIDE EVENT GO GET YOUR RAINBOW COLORED SCARF.
---
Found the saddest man on reddit. I dont even think this kid plays video games, just finds things about them to bitch about all day :)
---
go to the 2nd to lowest level of the stronghold of security located in the barbarian village. youll earn 10k gold pieces which is enough to get you two sets from the corresponding vendors ;)
---
They were going for over 20m
---
Ill work it out for you when you work out how to take a screenshot.
---
I read Hot Pants and thought what has Jojo got to do with this.
---
You don’t get your money back. Recover your account if it’s yours
---
Your comment has no upvotes, but I wanna let you know I understood your comment.
---
I got barrows gloves at 7 Slayer lol
---
I remember and I would shit my pants again.
---
I did it too a little bit ago. Currently trying to do it again. It took around 4-5 months the first time with both Miscellania and Etceteria.  Maybe double the time if you only have Miscellania? This time I am actually tracking the time so I don't have to estimate.
---
This even is for the ones defined by it lol
---
I never really get why people think castle wars is dead or ruined in osrs. If you go on the main themed world there's always games running with lots of people and even though it's a lot of maxed mains there's still lots of noobs or people just running around slapping each other with rubber chickens
---
I like the idea but I can't help but think stuff like this is going to get someone a false macroing ban eventually.
---
Oooh sass, I like it
---
Doesn't Rune pick cost 32k?
---
Still fucking down?!
---
Dude what are YOU trying to say, irons can do all those mini games and most of them do do PC and BA.
---
How do you even get 9b without staking?
---
Literally standing I front if shortcut with spikes. I was waiting for you to jump over.
---
You’ll get your straight pride after you get your history of prejudice and exclusion by society.
---
Y'all are a fucking embarrassment, three days to comment on your inability to do your jobs? Y'all understand you're not actually a small indie game company? 
---
Let me guess, this is only coming out because it's going to be down all weekend.
---
Nope. I went in. Lost 80m, decided it's not worth it and kept playing with 300m left in my bank. Haven't gone back since. People who stake their whole bank are just a bit dumb.
---
I did finally jump over lol
---
All this for a cop out. All this to defend nazis dressing up as the KKK. Runescape is not one of those "purely entertaining" games to play.
---
So why the fuck are you dictating what goes in the game then?
---
Yea no, Christmas is not the norm throughout the world. It is literally summer in Australia, and most of the world probably don't celebrate Christmas.
---
Othello 8x8 while having bots that could destroy you isn't quite solved. RuneSquares is actually slightly different from normal dots and lines, and takes a creative leap from existing solutions to solve. IE it's basically solved but uncoded anywhere for a botter to just adopt trivially.
---
Thank you. Tried it a couple times with no success but I really appreciate a helpful comment. That’s a very rare thing on game posts. I hope you have a fantastic day and amazing rng.
---
Think fairy ring is faster than ectophial, and if you get a PoH pool you won't need graceful and staminas
---
Saw that too, figured it was a scam
---
Congratulations professor chode!!!!
---
if yoinking a tbow wasn't meant to be part of the game jagex wouldn't have made it so easy and profitable
---
Shoulda done range cape emote also

Yes, clearly these are all "terrorist countries"
---
I dont really see this as drama, these things happen and they’re making it a priority to fix so not like its being brushed aside
---
So a level 80 in rune would be better than say a level 40 in torags?
---
Ignoring the level requirements
---
Man I was one of the best to. Miss the old way it was played this new way of pking is cool to I still rip people apart but it doesn’t have the same feeling as ice barrage Whip DD spec. And the good ole times getting party hats and Santa hats by the tree in edgy man we musta gotten over 12bill with that trick. The good times.
---
there just isnt a vocal number of people who want it, and those that tend to have the time to play two accounts lose nothing spending bonds on membership, i have never paid for membership in osrs and ive had probably 3 accounts w/ members active for most of the time ive played.
---
Clever
---
funny enough they were polled but didnt meet the threshold and only made it that far.
---
Minigame teleports haven't always existed.
---
Back in 07 I miss the house parties, people didn’t care as much about efficiency and xp so the dungeons were completely filled with people killing each other for fun
---
They’re shortcuts to turn around and go back if and when you need to.
---
I called 3rd age from a hard casket on discord once and got 3a range legs. Nobody believed me at first lol
---
I think the op was using politics to describe ideas the immunity may disagree over. Which as we've seen, they did in this case
---
Ur a DAWG brother. Best of luck to you in your recovery and I hope you keep your head and spirits up. If you need it, I'll train runecrafting on your acc while you're rehabbing.
---
they can do whatever the fuck they want, this just makes their achievements way less impressive, when you can simply buy your way using money/main gp to boost your ironman that's when the gamemode loses it's integrity, sure you an pay for BA boosts but that's far from being as impactful as pretty much 100m's of wealth
---
to feel superior btw
---
DAE helmet man bad
---
I love this
---
You don’t think having an event specifically for a certain group qualifies?
---
bruh he isn't just "doing BH". He's spending money on his main to game the minigame so he can get GP on his iron.
---
No one would give a fuck if he got those points actually playing the minigame. He didn't.
---
servers were so bad last night that instead of going on our pk trip my team played lms for 2 hours. not worth risking max when ticks are massively delayed
---
I loved games room, at one point I grew bored of most content and just hung out there. It had an OK community while still being practically dead in 2010/2011. I definitely had some of the highest ranks with 3K+ everything and 4K+runelink. Thing is that you pretty quickly only start winning one rank a game due to point differences unless there's a huge player pool. 
---
People always wanted to know what games were ready for the 'extra rooms' and some believe some games designed for them ended up on runeorb. The problem with most games room games is that if they had any rewards or anything the games are all solved so bots/programs on the side could easily play a perfect game and destroy you. Even in our small community it was pretty well known that whoever went first in RuneLink played close to perfectly and would almost always win.
---
Soul wars but without the op exp rewards
---
It is quite the stinker
---
Its not like he's actually playing bh. If you could get 100m cash from boosting castlewars then people would have a problem with that too.
---
Fair enough
---
Oof we found one of them
---
This is a weird argument - if someone doesn't enjoy something they wouldn't play it anymore even if they already have and have a right to criticize it.   As the game has changed and Castle Wars has gotten more "serious" it would naturally drive mid and even high level players away since they feel like they can't contribute/it isn't fun.
---
Oh god oh fuck - no, but just generally skilling anywhere except the most efficient areas.
---
The results... won't suprise you
---
Haha, yeah, we'll pretend I was making that! 😅😅
---
Go somewhere else to mine that doesn't have tons of bots.
---
Why do you think he gives a fuck what you think of his achievements? You think people should dictate their gameplay around what YOU think is fair, and should build their account to impress YOU? Lmfao
---
That's smart. I'm in a discord where people literally sell everything from their bank and alch their defenders and shit to go staking.
---
Why do you think he gives a fuck what you think in the first place lol
---
Pack it up boys it's over, this dudes got upvotes lmao
---
It's those sugar-y sprinkles you put on cookies, i just did a really, really bad job wrangling them into a recognizable shape.
---
Yep. Seems the same on IOS and Android.
---
Same I’m not gay or anything but after that event I literally gave up making new friends in game.
---
I don’t want to get attached to someone and then find out they are an edgy alt-right weirdo who hates “politics” like so many people in our community.
---
I selected twisted league  and then went to a normal world. Worked great for me
---
See ya next week! :)
---
That's some luck
---
You're a walking caricature of the elitist OSRS player. No one is interested in what you have to say because you behave like a rude cunt. 
---
I hope you don't talk to people like this IRL or else I imagine you'd be completely friendless. No one would respect or even listen to someone that acts like that offline.
---
It's supposed to be a crude rendition of the Fletching skill icon, but I'm not good at cake decoration.
---
This is a fancy new way to justify your homophobia
---
I really hope you’re trolling to tell another person otherwise because if you think a steel med is an advantage I think you bumped your head
---
ive tryed 5 times i made it to healers once i end up being so nervous that i cant even focus on what prayer to flick
---
I would 100% prefer this
---
Go to the link in there Twitter about it there is a loop hole using the website to force open the app it worked for me had to close the app and try a few different worlds read there thread.
---
I would but im not there to drop mine. im collecting iron to get my smithing up high enough for mith
---
I'm glad you marked it NSFW man it was a close one.
---
Lol the nerves get me too. Then I’m iced in a few seconds and am weary of doing all the waves all over again to get spanked by papa jad.
---
I feel like this is just what minigame people want. There's plenty of other dead content like the goblin city and the desert too
---
It’s not as easy as people pretend. Most people with fire capes are players with years of experience and multiple accounts. People just like to make it sound easier than it is to pat themselves on the back lol.
---
fuck yeah.
---
bakes beans.
---
fuck yeah...
---
lol@salty downvoters with no pet/prims @1k+ kc
---
I'm not saying that this is equal to those, just that Ironman had already lost its so-called integrity long ago. Of course being able to "transfer" millions of gold like this is a problem.
---
Why would it be a must have? 73 hunter is not a very high req. Over 200,000 accounts have 73 hunter. Also if they are basically negligible marks like you say, it wouldnt be a huge loss to people between 63 and 73 hunter if they didnt have a net anyways. 
---
This update is bad and not needed
---
Inferno rs we do raids bossing and weekly smiling contests as well as pet hunts all for prizes!
---
maybe we should get wasted before we try
---
how long does it take you inbetween attempts? the first day i did 2 attempts now i can barely be assed to do one and i dont want to do anything else before getting this cape
---
What I found I had to do was force close the app each time to try a different world I got it to work on my 3rd attempt havnt had a issue now in 24hrs
---
He must’ve posted the wrong clip
---
fr. boutta quit on mine after seeing this shit. what's the point now?
---
as a trans woman that was a super scary week to be a part of this community. turned me off of becoming more active because of the backlash to it. i wish we could have something like it again though, the only way to fix it is to make it clear that we're not going away
---
That’s the problem. On the themed worlds it’s competitive people playing, so if you’re not on that level then you’re not exactly very useful to your team. Many people have their best memories of castle wars when it was just a mass of noobs running into the battlefield fighting other noobs.
---
Right now games are comprised of maxed mains in BiS gear and know the mechanics of the game inside out. What ends up happening is that people will give castle wars a shot to relive their nostalgia and quickly realize they’re not very useful unless they are using ancients and that the games aren’t as heavily populated as they were back in the day.
---
I have a clan u can join, they are very welcoming but im not that active lol
---
Jagex should use this for an Ad on social media. PAY LILSMOKEY
---
Wow mate, this is just a suggestion, not an update, your downvote is enough.
---
I wish I could have as much fun as him spending days boosting kills in pvp.
---
If you position yourself correctly you will be in a safe spot before Jad spawns so he can't attack you until you exit the safe spot. As for the healers, just tank them. You should have plenty of supplies by the time you get to Jad. Just do one action bewteen pray swaps max.  
---
Jad attack &gt; Pray swap &gt; Attack a healer  
---
Jad attack &gt; Pray swap &gt; Attack a healer
---
Honestly its not even just mobile anymore. Most worlds I've tried feels like you're playing in still frames. The server side stutters and lags has got me playing other games atm.
---
Ya I’ve had some hard lags as well but nothing egregious. There defiantly having server issues in general
---
Side note. Is anyone else having pretty bad lag? The 5 worlds i usually use have all been having absurdly bad server lag for the past couple days in a row.
---
Im a chiseled fire cape veteran alright lemme smack u with some mad tips - bring blood spells, never use food again! Next bring blowpipe gg insane dps your welcome for ur fire cape
---
Are there any stable servers at the moment? Just tried to do a raid and the lag was so bad RuneLite's overload timer was literally a full minute off
---
This is him asking it tho and not confirming. But hes talking about solo, mine were in team raids so I dont know now
---
I’ve tried this numerous times on both of my phones and restarted them and still not working.
---
Yes everyone, thanks Rendi.
---
rapist dolphins too and by scarce data available homo animals get kicked out of their circles... how tf is that possible.
---
lol guaranteed that this cc will be full of enablers
---
Can you believe I got her for free because she was a "problem cat" for the previous owner? Apparently we just vibe, because the day I brought her home we were best buds and she didnt do any of the things I was warned about lmao. All she does is follow me around and want scritches.
---
I’d say it equivalent to riding a bike
---
Jagex pls.
---
Yeah, servers are pretty trash right now. Just did a raid and the lag was so bad that RuneLite's overload timer was a full minute off
---
Lmao that thought crossed my mind xD. I honestly haven’t retried in maybe two months. Ik mostly addicted to slayer but maybe it’s time I got back in that cave and figured it out. I can get to jad no problem it’s just a bummer dying in a few seconds xD. Maybe this is our weekend to get that sexy cape!
---
supplies or getting to jad isnt a problem for me
---
Says it has worked for some :/ I’m not guaranteeing anything it’s just a lot of people keep posting asking if anyone else is having the issue just trying to spread what jagex has put out. All I can say is maybe try another world 492 is what got me in
---
Time for a touchscreen cat only locked ironman?
---
Literally why I made an ironman. Haven't staked since.
---
They hold group meetings at the altar in Duel Arena, foaming from their mouths as they see people advertise their bets.
---
Stupid question- 
---
Just got back into the game. 40 strength, 40 attack, 30 def. I’ve been working them in that order. 
---
My question is- I see a lot of people talking/making memes about keeping defense low and only training the others. Why? Wouldn’t you want to increase your defense so you could wear better armor? What is “pure”? I saw someone say that the other day
---
Hitpoints will be your issue, the calculator thought it would be around 94, so you’ll need to make sure you’re doing everything you can to deal damage without getting hp xp. Cannon, poison, ring of recoil etc. 
---
Remember there are level 3 skillers who have 99 slayer so it’s still absolutely possible for you
---
https://twitter.com/jagexroq/status/997403417864744960
---
This. "Politics" for some people is more than just what they have to see in media.
---
I too have been having some tremendous lag. So far I've only noticed no lag on low player count worlds (like 392[pvp])
---
Fishing is a pretty tough one. I could never do it.
---
Yeah try going onto this sub's in-game clan chat... it's a hate filled biggoted cancer chat.
---
No, that’s incorrect. I did this just the other day through the app.
---
"What are you doing with mommies beads?!"
---
Someone should do the math and figure out how long it would take to get a single level 999
---
Its effectively 500 points per hour. Every 30 minutes you come back to the BH world see if you can get your alt as a target, if not you leave and try again later. Depending on the activity you're doing its little more than a minor inconvenience.
---
In what world does it take hundreds of hours to make 300k an hour? Get to mlm afk 2 hours a day while playing an iron and your bonds are paid for. You can do this nearly anywhere. If you want to talk profit bosses 1 hour a week is enough on average.
---
And here was me worried that mine was gonna be too full. I haven't check it since TL started
---
If they have a keylogger on your machine you're already fucked to be honest.
---
69
---
Scythe and sang staff cost nearly 1k per hit late game, you need to buy a lot of blood runes, bursting runes for slayer, broad bolts for fletching, gold ore for smithing, herblore costs 200gp per pot, just small things add up quick.
---
PTSD is real man. I purposely quested to get my low character into the champions just so I could kill the chickens who were pretending to be good.
---
Definitely not even close to what it was back then, but  I still love playing. Every game has at least 20 people on a team
---
It’s a lot more enjoyable when you’re maxed or have good gear though
---
We have lost 2 days of membership on multiple accounts but as long as your in suchhh a hurry to fix it we good
---
I've been doing 1+1 raids a bit too but the only room that scares me is vanguards I've only ever done like 5 vang raids in my life.
---
Also massive gz you lucky bastard
---
On multiple accounts btw
---
Thank you :D
---
unless you have a bank pin
---
It’s more of a problem that results from the mode being so old. Once the playerbase stared dwindling there were fewer and fewer worlds where you could get large CW games going. Then Ancients became the busted strategy that it is and hindered the game mode further.
---
Nowadays it’s just like any other old online game. You try to go back but the only people playing are the tryhards so it’s no fun. Then since the exclusivity of the game being dominated by tryhards pushes more casual players away it can never return to what it once was because any semi-casual player is immediately turned off of it.
---
The mode has lost so much as it turned into a den for efficiency obsessed tryhards, and it is no longer fun for the large majority of players because of it. So I’d say yes, screw them in favor of the people who want to actually enjoy the mode for what it is and has to offer rather than 95% of the players equipped in the best gear in the game only doing what is the most efficient method of winning or spamming ancients at people all game. I’d prefer that the mode was for everyone rather than just the top 1 or 2 percent of players.
---
Thanks!
---
Absolutely no proof of this btw.
---
A game you "pay so handsomely" but you also dont pay real money for?
---
Relax man, the game is up and running 99.99% of the time.
---
Camel mask
---
You're slandering peoples opinions exactly how you're describing what other people do though. There are literal laws in place across the globe that dictate what you are and aren't allowed to do with regards to sexuality which means that it is political by nature. Yes, labeling LGBT topics as a whole as "Politics" is not accurate but to dismiss every opinion that doesn't agree with specific employees pushing their own beliefs into a video game (Notice how RS3 had no Pride event while OSRS did?) that people play specifically to avoid having to see controversial topics that are constantly being shown on media outlets, as being bigoted or hateful speech is just as inaccurate. 
---
Frankly, I don't even think it's entirely wrong to assume a precedent would be set. If we're fine celebrating Pride, should we have an event celebrating African American History? There are a multitude of just as equally important topics that people can say should be celebrated much the same.
---
I don't care if you're going to label me a bigot, hateful or whatever other buzzword you want. I have an openly trans relative that I have nothing but encouragement towards so make whatever assumptions you want about me.
---
Just another reason that red helms are the only prestigious helm now.
---
Why is it exclusively the 40 and 50 year olds that are obese?
---
Tokkul, lava scale shards, and onyx bolt tips
---
Tzhaar fight pit!
---
:o
---
I was pretty confident I’ve seen it posted on here previously, happy to retract if incorrect. But the point about being able to get millions of slayer xp without getting cb xp if you are determined enough still stands
---
Holy moly I saw him in another thread and thought he was a twat but now I realize he needs help
---
If he goes back hel get unwanted xp
---
Eh, maybe one of those fancy mountain bikes with all the gears and shit yeah.
---
my first thought
---
I distinctly  remember pure did not mean that in RS2. I played around 2009-2011 and "pure X" (X being a combat skill) meant you only trained that combat skill. 
---
One guy actually told me "no one likes a defence pure" because he couldn't hit through my rune armour.
---
No?
---
Obby is best.  Dh will edge out xp/h after you get past 90 hp but remember you will have to repair your dharoks after 3ish nmz sessions. That's a lot of wasted gp for shaving off maybe 2-3 hours of training.  
---
While 99 att, 99 str, 96 hp I was training def to max.  I averaged 82k xp/hr with obby, comb bracelet, no fc.  With dharok I was around 90k xp/hr.  (Just def xp).  If shaving 2-3 hours off getting max def is worth 2m gp and wasted time running to repair your sets then go right ahead.  I'm training an alt atm in nmz and he's getting 74k xp/hr with obsidian at 70 att and 60 def.  I use 60 dose absorp, a rock cake, and the rest overloads
---
You're missing the ultra rare ~~loot box~~ treasure chest demon wings, dude!
---
Took me a minute to realize 1:18 wasn't a ratio
---
The last few days have been annoying but I've never had this much of an issue logging in in the 19 years I've played. Calm down Mr entitled.
---
I do have a clip for my controller that I can mount my phone in, that helps a lot.  I just really prefer Runelite, I was wondering if and when they would have a mobile version out.  I found nothing about it so I took matters into my own hands.
---
The UI scaling option is fantastic for this btw.  I was having issues with the UI being too small until I found that plugin.
---
The official mobile client is a significant improvement over the vanilla desktop client, I'll say that much.  But it's just hard not to want the helpful plugins of Runelite when they're gone.  Draw distance of 80, ground item text, run energy in seconds, player stat lookup, skill calculators, exp trackers, loot trackers, clue helpers, etc.  Having Runelite is absolutely better than not having it.
---
Straight pride is like celebrating that you eat bread. Like yeah okay fine, but... why? Good for you, but it's the norm and nobody really cares.
---
No clue.
---
&gt;down for a week
---
HURR DURR THE GAME NEVER WORKS. 
---
fuck off to another game then
---
I mainly played on pc
---
There is a pinned post on the front page
---
Anyone here experiencing fps stuttering? Doing an agility course that requires 1ticks and its been quite frustrating.
---
VS playing on a 3pc you mean? Yeah, it's the collection log, you can pick one up from building a bookshelf in your house and interacting with it.
---
Thank you for your feedback honestly! I used to pay, won't going forward. And that's my point! When it is down that tiny percentage of the time there are no options to those casual mobile players that don't understand all the intricacies to actually receiving help!
---
I really just want accessible help for this game!
---
Mobile AR anyone?
---
Hell yeah dude I feel that. This is the worst it's been in awhile and I don't see a fix coming down the pipeline anytime soon.
---
Thank you sir.
---
Tyty. This was my first ever tbow in my name, and 2nd ever mega rare in my name. Vangs in CM raids is easy imo, you can safe spot the melee vang, and the other 2 go down easy. Synq has a challenege mode guide where he does a live playthrough of a CM raid, he shows you the safespot areas.
---
I get maxed mains are really intimidating in current osrs CW, but honestly the secret for medium levels is to use a ZGS for freeze spec and wear the highest lvl dragon hides they can if defending - it's what I did around 90-100cb and it worked well for me. Getting good at barricading is also super useful and can be done well at any combat level which is a very meaningful contribution.
---
I think the issue for most is that castle wars is all about strategy and the old spank and tank ways of og 2007 don't work anymore. You pretty much have to hybrid/tribrid and make strategic decisions and I think a lot of newer players don't know CW strategy and find the learning curve intimidating.
---
The servers are up, I have been able to play, but there is plenty of lag.
---
If it's on your computer with the intention of stealing your RuneScape account there's no difference. Whatever happens, at the end of the day you have to send your input to the server and the key logger can just intercept it before it's sent. Alternatively, they can just screenshot every mouse click (they can see which numbers you haven't clicked to deduce which one you did click from screenshots).
---
When you've played this game for 3 months yes a week feels like a long time.

He isn't hopping worlds - He is changing teams in the middle of a game without even logging out. Read it again.

Whaaaat you can't use it on your cat? 😂 That sucks. And I didn't make it a hell cat either. Luckily the cat grows passively so I didn't really lose anything :) just back to cooking is all! :) That's again for the tips!
---
...literally the first kill after.
---
Do you force close the app before going to the website and picking a world?
---
People's sexuality shouldn't be political to begin with...
---
Lol 300 tokens dry on iron and complaining..no your rng isnt bad. This is quite normal..
---
On the double mage wave before jad just stand up while fighting them and shake out your arms/legs and rotate your neck both ways a few times. Helped me a ton with the nerves. Also kill red mage first then orange. Orange mager is where kad will spawn. Right as the orange mager dies put on prot ranged and hard focus on where jad will spawn. While flicking I always just hover over the prayer im not currently on so its easy to make the switch. Ive heard chins help with tagging healers all at once. After healers are tagged its just staying alive and getting the flicks down. Gl my dude you got this.
---
Edit: I also shit talked jad on the last few waves leading up to him. For some reason this was helping with the nerves also lol.
---
Depends really on how much do you like doing clues. For points, treasure seeker is better. If you only want to do clues for the gear upgrades then you don't need treasure seeker.
---
you got shit in your hopper i think?
---
dump a bunch of coal, clear out the hopper etc.
---
[Me right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVF9TwdeB4) I'm glad I'm at least discovering this at 62 RC so I wasn't too deep into the pool. Gonna have that skillcape trim in no time, aw yiss!
---
And this was a holiday event
---
Did you leave the room and show the defender to the person and go back in?
---
It’s okay :)
---
Look, I agree with you, but the comparison to movies hasnt been valid for like 20 years. We all know movies are shit value, and always have been.
---
How much did you average a day? Play time I mean
---
The Uk servers work. It also works for everyone - youre probably doing something wrong.
---
I think CW is F2p also now, just play on a F2P world and go with a full rune set or somethin
---
this is it?  i got a 1.3bill loot tab atm from playing legit and killing ppl with ags  on a almost maxed iron
---
I agree though, they need to nerf newb irons loots, you guys prob just afk buy kills. I think the crates need to stay for max players though. You aren't going to get 500 points/h against this community at lvl 115+. You will get bodied so much unless you are top tier
---
If I wasnt personally so good at comboing ppl out with veng/ags on my iron it would be garbage gp/h.  But sinc eim a god, yeah im sitting on 8k+ range pot, 500m in alchs and 600m in super combats/anglers/brews ect
---
Placing a tacticle dot because I want to know aswell.
---
I feel like the monitor would have gone flying off the back of the desk on punch 1.  o.0
---
Wish people felt like this for all the reposted shitty memes that go around. Literally exact same mole and title spammed every 2 mins. 
---
But seriously, the mobile issue has been posted so many damn times. It would kill people to open their eyes
---
What handicap is he bypassing? He isn’t trading lol
---
Don't judge me but I have 85 farming and have no idea how a contract works, have never done one
---
I think you meant to say "stable internet helm" because let's be real, unless u have a major fuck up at a boss unprepaird the only way to lose ur hc status is from a DC or lag at just the wrong time
---
Let me get this straight... people can make over a 100m in 12 hours by bounty hunting their alternate accounts? That sounds like cheating.
---
Thanks - This worked.
---
Just get another 15. Sucks tho
---
That's a shame, I wish you guys would do it again.
---
&gt;I'm not sure why you think new people are shunned or competition can't be fun. Your view is simply not reality.
---
I used to play CW years ago. I haven't gotten around to playing it yet in old school. But I can still make observations, and that is that there are comparatively many less players playing CW, and that many people on this sub recognize the problem being that it got too serious and that there are too many 'efficiency scape' tryhards making up a large portion of who *does* play.
---
I never said people are shunned or that competition can't be fun. So that's a strawman. I am saying that compared to those old days if the mode is dominated by tryhards then it will push away new players, casual players, players who just aren't tryhards, etc..
---
Imagine trying to jump back into Halo 3 on Xbox live (or whatever their new service is called). You'll find a bunch of games where the only people you play against will be tryhards who know the weapon spawn locations on every map, have played for years, mastered the physics and strategies, are all hyper coordinated in voice chat, etc.. But you seem to imply that that *wouldn't* be a scenario that would push away new players, casual players, players who are returning after years, etc.? 
---
If CW is truly dominated by efficiency scape tryhards like many people in this thread seem to be saying, then that would produce a very similar situation. This has absolutely nothing to do with people making private worlds or how the number of *serious* competitive players has been growing, apart from the fact that both of those things would likely *increase* the number of tryhards playing on the theme worlds.
---
It's very clearly not *just like in 2007*. That is the view that is simply not reality.
---
269IQ logic. Wouldn't expect a bondie to get it though.
---
Unfortunately theres nothing you can do mate. OR fully commit to the rainbow graceful outfit which I'd respect
---
yeah i’ve been world hopping with the RL metronome on and pretty much every world that supposedly has low ping for me is stuttering every few ticks. it’s driving me crazy. guess i’ll do something like reorganizing my bank today
---
Leave goldsmith gauntlets on till the exp drops.
---
Doing gold bars at blast furnace gives 1 exp drop per inv, if youre getting 2 youre doing something wrong. 
---
After exp drop, switch to ice gloves, then empty.
---
I did this to 80 smithing.
---
Yeah that’s what I did, worked about 25 mins ago
---
Clan Wars and... The dark wizard tower. I'd love for it to be significant in some way.
---
Do u guys do tob?
---
I couldn't get my wife to play rs longer than a day. Good job mate.
---
I was noice’in your noice!
---
Yes, force close the app. Then open when prompted on the site
---
and now we all know his bank pin
---
He'd be rather prideful.
---
Effectively 12 hours. Meaning they spent 12 hours actually boosting, but in reality it took probably a month or so. Its similar to how tears of Guthix is effectively 1m xp/hr or w/e, but you can only do it once a week.

Get good

I wasn't replying to the OP, I was replying to the other guy who said Iban's is better than trident until 80 mage.
---
Really doesn't matter.
---
Honestly if someone is lagging hard and thinks "I feel like doing some Zulrah" then they're making a daft decision. Sure, Jagex should have better servers but you also need to apply some common sense.
---
If you added muggers and wizards to the spot they'll either find the next best spot or they'll spend 5 minutes leveling the bot to a high enough combat before mining. It's not a real solution.
---
Dude I was just thinking the same thing. My membership runs out tomorrow and I havent been able to get on mobile for the last 3 days of my membership
---
i mean u can just buy prepaid membership cards if ur going that route lmao
---
Works fine for me tried all Uk world’s
---
Magic in general is more accessible with abyss runecrafting. Back in the day it was so much more expensive to level magic.
---
I think when things like this happens we should be given some token apology, Jagex never does though.
---
Maybe it's just different games we play then because I've got a handful of games where if they need to do a server update or whatever they will compensate players for the downtime with in game currency, items, etc... Not saying they need to do it but it's super nice and shows that they care about their customers. But hey, at the end of the day it's whatever
---
The post isn’t about me complaining about losing bank it about the 17kc scorpia pet that was unexpected
---
People take this subreddit too seriously and become keyboard warriors,, very toxic.
---
Yes there are my low level ways to make money but I don’t want to have to waste my time making money on my main just to afford a ironman account. Why should I have to grind for a new members account. All I want is to have the option to play as an ironman and have my main on the same account for $11. In today’s mmo market that does not seem like a crazy request.
---
Plus I really wanna play and will be soon. Manman man5. Add me :)
---
Yeah, paying for membership. Jagex is the one fucking up, not us.
---
it was great because the game wasnt expscape. delete skill capes and the high scores completely and maybe we can have the play for fun era back
---
He had surgery and was out for months chill
---
You know slayer helmet acts as a slayer gem too?
---
Mage was actually my highest stat back in the day and I wore it as a badge of pride due to how hard it was to get supplies. It actually drove me to get as high as 60 rc to get all those law runes in entrana.
---
You actually have to PK now (or boost) to buy shit. Crazy, I know
---
das a lotta watermelons
---
dont forget to use the ash on the bin, not buckets. Also I'm sure you have a bottomless compost bucket, but please get one if you dont. It doubles your UC and is extremely helpful.
---
Was able to play a bit before the update yesterday but still down here.
---
This worked for me last night but no longer works.
---
No... They're offering a service for payment. We're paying and we're not getting that service. That's literally all there's to it. "It's your risk" is just bullshit.
---
Setting up for that weekend shift
---
Took me a second
---
It's not even really skill, these days it's more about 'wealth'. If you want to PK the most efficiently you need a 300m setup. We're not all Sparc Mac.
---
I’m using your stats as a guide for the boosts on the AD cape. I’m base 80s with only wc, fish, thieve, rc, craft, herb left. Any tips for the boosts on the elites?
---
I just got back into osrs to be honest, but it’s hard to keep interest if I can never connect on mobile.

New runelite feature request.  Override users name in chat

Soul wars was horrible, 95% bots lol

Yes. I work construction all week and when I get off the servers are down. I'm off today and the servers are down. I'm pissed because I bought membership again just for league. COMPENSATE MEMBERSHIP
---
Hes not lying or wrong in his first comment.  There weren't level restrictions to rune upon release until the December 8th update.
---
Hey dude, thats really cool. Happy you didnt lose your eyes or life, that all sounds fucking terrifying :S
---
Good luck with your recovery and much love dude. Don't worry about spamming, I think everyone wants to see how you recover :)

tbf 99% of people probably held space bar through that quest

I don't go to those sites.

I've been having bad lag for the past 2 days and lagging for the past 2 weeks...

You should be fine for desert treasure, just read/watch a guide before you do it so you know what you'll be up for.

Fire cape is still a bit away, but keep up the grind and you'll get it in no time champ!

Because people are cheating, so it's not very fun. When someone can exploit world hopping or whatever, and get a capture in the first 60 seconds of the game, it becomes dead content since fewer people play. CW used to be my absolute favorite thing, now it just isn't worth it

Also my main world and also terrible lag doing construction yesterday. Had to stop.

100h of vorkath should make 300m, that's like 1,6 hours a day for two months every year. Not most casual player assuming that you play also with those other accounts but no anywhere near 8 hours a day
---
I mean I get the disconnect aspect. If you ever went to YouTube on a incognito tab would see the huge difference in what YouTube thinks is important, and the real content that the heavy consumers watch. 
---
Hell you can't even search for good documentaries or conspiracy theories without getting fucking ancient aliens or some dying mainstream news outlet these days
---
It's all just like the Facebook or Twitter feed now days. At one point in time you where able to actually search for content, and have it appear to you. Now you have to sift through the garbage of a dying I dustry trying to push their way into the platform, and they get #1 slot priority Everytime.

But how much are they REALLY losing by comping existing members another 1-3 days? Come on

&gt; everybody is human we make mistakes or sometimes we can’t problem solve immediately.

That's why humans created backups and redundancy. If something breaks, there will be others in place to keep things working. If something breaks really bad, just use the backup.
---
&gt;I appreciate Jagex with good and bad. Let’s keep this game alive by positive vibes and sharing good quality posts instead of hate posting please! :D
---
Positive vibes don't solve server issues...
---
&gt; having your gameplay mostly revolve around doing chores.

...youre describing runescape

Oh wow I didn't realise the nexus portal was that specific. I'm a long way being able to use it but that sounds pretty cool. As for res crops, I only do ranarrs so, having just looked it up, definitely seems worth it.

I dont have a computer. I play exclusively mobile and so do many of the members in our clan. Its pretty disheartening.

I just found out about them at 70 farming. They’re nice for filling the seed vault with trash contract seeds I never have in the bank, and I’ve already gotten 3 spirit seeds and a couple snapdragon seeds from the seed packs.

You conclude that im delusional because you cant understand that I made my own comments.

I just did it a couple weeks ago at very similar stats and gear. You'll do fine but absolutely get the super restores for kamil, well worth it

On iPhone, go to the Old School website and click “Select a world.” I had the most luck with Australian servers until today, when I had to pick the Nightmare of Ashihama tourney world before hopping to a standard world. I have heard that this works on Android if you select, “Member? Play Now!” Either way, toying with it by either picking worlds until it loads up or - perhaps - selecting the Play Now button will almost certainly work EVENTUALLY. Just keep at it for the xp. I like Jagex and there’s only so much they can do, but to those who are suggesting extended membership or extended leagues or something, let’s be realistic here. :/ happy scaping and let me know if it works! Found this two days ago and posted a thread but apparently not many people found it. Good luck!

If it's possible, you'll need to do pretty much the rest of your slayer by cannon without attacking for hp xp. You can put your stats into my untrimmed slayer calculator to see if you can still make it, but based on your hitpoints, I'm guessing it can't be done.

---
If you're ashamed of boosting, why even do this in the first place? Get out of this thread already, retard
---
You just answered your own question dude what are you on
---
Maybe they forgot to pay the bill for the mobile server.
---
Just keep at it bro. Idk if you’re using F keys or not but that’s one thing that helps with any pvm requiring gear/prayer switching. Try to upgrade to barrows gloves, or ideally tormented bracelet for mage at least but I know that’s expensive. Consider using rune darts instead until you can get consistent kills then switch back to addy darts once you’re comfortable. Biggest thing is to be confident man don’t stress yourself over it, added pressure is never good
---
Edit: also forgot to include how I learned. I’m a pretty experienced pvmer but I don’t mean to brag at all, I start getting consistent kills after about 10-15 attempts. The biggest things that helped me were using f keys to switch between tabs(inventory, prayer page, combat page etc) and practicing one phase at a time. I started with range phase, so every time I’d start zulrah and figure out what phase it is, I’d log out if it wasn’t range phase. You’ll learn that phase very fast and it’ll help overall establish confidence
---
please note the world you're on right now. This will be the server that works for you connection/device :)
---
How would the community feel using the rs3 engine, but with OSRS content carbon copied over it? I don't have much experience with rs3 but having played it for like 10 minutes its buttery smooth on my computer unlike OSRS.  And I don't know if the current lag is affecting their servers currently.
---
Idk, it just seems like OSRS is built on this super flimsy outdated foundation
---
S9+ here, launching a non US server via website was the only fix for me. Haven't had an issue since.
---
Imagine having a fucking life and not playing RS like it's a full time job.

Yes, but they weigh more than the crabs.

Tbh this is gona get nerfed, maybe week or in a year or in 3, so just take advatage of it imo

I'm really enjoying rargh and linksocarina right now. Love framed as well and mudkip videos are great, he uploads consistently. J1mmy is great too his songs are fire.

I wonder how much they make per video
---
Some of my stats are higher than you need, I think herblore you’re good at 85, wc and crafting 85, fletching 91, mining is possible at 80 but I recommend getting 82, smithing 86, cooking 90 hunter 70 slayer 93. Good luck!
---
They’re discount tanzoo/virtoso

Upkeep costs, I guess.

Is anyone having trouble connecting to the servers on mobile or just me?
---
I would very much like my 1.54 back please Jagex spy ;). Thank you for asking! :D
---
96-99 was 30m for me and I did it at nmz in a weekend with prayer pots and overloads using addy darts (I actually used rune darts 98-99 but I’m not including that cost)  I was in max range gear with archer ring I and prayed eagle eye the entire time.  Xp was like 135kxp/hr
---
Nmz is better xp than crabs with overloads and you can theoretically buy herb packs over time to mitigate cost 
---
Nmz is a very different kind of afk.  You do one click every minute or so but you never need to reset which I feel is very distracting.  If you don’t have money I’d say msb with rune arrows at nmz with prayer pots. If you’re really broke I recommend doing overloads and absorbs.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bz6w43/need_jmod_cant_unlock_acc/

By your logic here, then you shouldn't whine when your account gets locked and you can't unlock it. Obviously, you did a poor job with maintaining your account and it's entirely your fault.
---

&gt; Probably a bash script

The word you’re looking for is ‘batch’ script. (This is what a .bat file is)

A bash script wouldn’t run on Windows, on account of bash being the default UNIX shell

Y’all are too funny
---
OP is suggesting, in jest, that the pure equipping the steel med was what caused mobile to break.
---
Pures can’t go back to mm caves.  You need to talk to Dario and he gives def xp with either training option.  If pures could, they would be able to use addy gloves instead of mith.
---
Sorry it isn't working for you :/
---
I got two on my most recent task as well, about 5 kills apart. Certainly uncommon but not unheard of
---
thought it was my internet connection but yeah it's awful

Can confirm, when I wrote this I was raiding. Made 1.5m in about 3 hours. Sad days

Lol. Everyone. There’s a work around. Go to the website and manually select a world.
---
Yeah i was having issues with the authenicator after switching to a new phone. Idk what that has to do with whining about a refund?

Edit: if your argument is that my membership was ticking down youre a sperg. I didnt want to wait a week or two if i could get a jmods attention asap. Literally completely different than u broke people whining for a refund of a couple dollars lol
---
I tried to join a few clans but all I got was a bunch of elitist that jerk themselves off to their ranks.
---
Like I just wanna be in a social setting with the same group of buddies and maybe find some ppl to boss with. Osrs clans arnt that serious. Why do clans have to be so serious and elitist?
---
Oh man youve never done mta then. Getting bones to peaches alone takes more than 3 hours and the mages book costs more than double the spell unlock. 
---
Its literally impossible to get one in 3 hours
---
Make sure to report that stuff
---
I’ve tried that too but it hasn’t been working. Tried with UK, German, and Aus worlds
---
Range bonus is negligible just use ahrims hood and don’t use a switch for head slot
---
Exactly. I'm mobile only. I'm at work 16 hours a day and when I'm not I have to take care of my child. So yeah. That 1.54 can buy her an extra Gerber food. 😁
---
You think he lost 4 levels from a rollback?
---
facts
---
It's pretty simple, you have purchased a service and you can't use it so you should be compensated for it. There isn't really much to talk about here, nobody has to explain anything but I doubt jagex will do care enough about it.
---
Just be friendly, I didnt ask for 5M or anything. I just started a casual conversation with him
---
Lol buy a maxed account

You're allowed to play the game however you want, I don't think anyone would be mad about you just doing pvp, God knows pvp needs the players since it's on its deathbed. But when you want rewards that someone who does pvm gets or from quests and you're only argument is that you don't find it fun so you'll never get  those, then I mean I guess that sucks for you. Game shouldn't be changed to cater to someone who doesn't want to actually play the full thing. You can have pvp related rewards relevant to only pvp that wouldn't be bad.
---
Because it is.
---
Pvp worlds are just walmart on black friday.
---
I'm playingmon a Google pixel and the workaround worked fine for me
---
I have a touch screen laptop can I get banned for using it? Like shift dumping my inventory while fishing or mining for example.
---
Im OOTL, what was the update?
---
Bro if you can dedicate atleast 12 hours a day 8 days a week to runescape why even play. Go play candy crush
---
I also wanna do dragon slayer II and MM2 can I do that on a piety build?
---
Worked for me also. They must be having issues for server selection on mobile.
---
Try a bunch of UK world's. Some work and some don't. I'm playing on a Google pixel and after 10 or so world's I find one that loads
---
Possibly maybe
---
Sounds like you work too much
---
Can never go wrong with 75 atk and def, pretty much sets you up for all pvm content with good gear and you’re the lowest possible level in pvp while still being “maxed”. Deep wildy these accounts absolutely shred anyone lower level like pures and zerks
---
You need 95 slayer to kill hydra.
---
The workaround barely works sadly.
---
trying to load the app fails to contact server and load on repeat 5 second loop.
---
one day I'll be allowed to load.
---
Sweet so 75 def instead of 70? And also can I do dragon slayer 2 and MM2 on a piety account?
---
I don’t use my BP for slayer for that exact reason. I was able to buy it for the fight caves but the scales cost so much when you use it consistently that I’m gonna wait til I can kill zulrah consistently
---
Not really, unless someone is abusing it like emblem farmers. If ironmen use their resources and actually kill someone, I think a reward is necessary. If we die, we lose all that stuff and have to get it again in some way, we can’t just buy it. Obviously farming points isn’t okay. But I like the idea of including ironmen in the pk scene, adds a little flex to the game and allows me to not play LMS all the time.
---
Download Runelite instead, it's better
---
sorry, your total level suggests that youre not that newish. i can give you a goal. do cabin fever quest. unlock cave creatures, slay them, get black masks, profit.
---
5star
---
You can't use the teleport in someone's house? Or anything like that?
---
Yes but make sure to do them before 75 atk and def. if you wanna mainly pk I would suggest 60/99/70 but if you want to actually help out and be decent at pvm get 75 attack. 70 def isn’t a bad place to start and you can always go up. Can’t go down. I recommend starting as 60/99/70 and going up when you get bored
---
I agree. Not sure why this is a hard thing for players to agree on.
---
DVS J1MMY SETTLED DOVY TEDIOUS LOWSOULGAMERS
---
I'm almost positive you can do them both
---
How do you not have enough space in your inventory if you buried the bone lmfao
---
You gotta go thru and pick diff worlds
---
You gotta do them on members, they drop herbs like crazy.
---
Definitely not promoting bug abuse. As a programmer it just occured to me that that bug probably isn't just there. Lol
---
The nature of OSRS attracts mouthbreathers who play video games 10+ hours a day and never go outside. Say what you will about RS3 but the community is a lot more chill
---
With your stats, you could go to Barrows to make enough money to get a bond. Pretty easy early game PvM that is decent money. Getting the Morytania hard diaries done will increas profit because 50% more runes from barrows. Gl and have fun
---
So one more question thanks for all the help by the way is there a guide out there for building a piety account in a document written out so I can read up on it and keep track of what’s done and what’s not
---
Never understood the constant switching. I’ve had the same username for almost 15 years
---
I wanna agree with you but the fact it’s only mobile which hasn’t been working makes me disagree 
---
I understand there are some mobile only players but that’s a side option to play the game. The main game is still working I think 
---
I’m fine either way tho I get the sentiment of getting some money back
---
Unlock new content and  weapons by quests and start grinding by doing slayer ,You will make easy money and if you want to know about fun part start pvm with friends also take a look at pk videos.
---
Just upvoteffs...
---
Yeah I would say 23-30 is probably the best represented age group
---
No? Depending on what you're buying you realistically should look at the amount of time or how long it can last you. There's a lot of other things you can compare, but for the sake of not making a list I will keep it as simple as that.
---
For example, if I myself want to buy a game and I'm seeing gameplay/reviews of said game I'm unsure of how much I actually WANT to pay for that and how much time I'm actually going to invest into that game.
---
Say I want to play the new CoD game, I know for sure I'm not going to put enough time into that game(for me to make it worth it) because I tend to stick to a few games. Not only that but especially as volatile as a game like CoD is there's little chance I will be able to go back to it within a few years because of perhaps a new release or something similar being better released. MAYBE if it was perhaps 10-20$ cheaper then yea maybe I would get my value out of it, but even then it will be a stretch(I mean currently it is 40$ because of it being on sale, but even then Halo came out so I'd rather play that then CoD).
---
It's the same thing with food or anything. You can spend 20$ on a burger that you know will be pretty good, but you can guarantee getting a 10$ burger you know will be filling and maybe not just as good but near the quality as that 20$ burger so why waste that extra 10$?
---
Love you macH

But you can also check (if not Iroman) the many hosts in world 330. Their houses are focused in hosting instead of efficiency though. Still nice to get some designs
---
I mean wow doesn’t credit people when there’s down time. No one does that. That doesn’t make them cheap.
---
Yeah I know that but there are hundreds of people who don't use this subreddit and just downloaded the game from Play Store. They have now idea how to fix this since Jagex support doesn't exist.
---
once you join runescape, you never really leave
---
Trend chasing out group?
---
I've always wanted to do barrows. I think before I stopped playing I was trying to make enough money to buy stuff go to do them. I'll look into it now!
---
you would do ping \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ -t
---
the -t makes it ping infinitely every second until stopped.
---
I had forgot about bonds. 
---
It shouldn’t be this difficult to reach out to Jagex. 
---
Look at all the successful gaming companies. 
---
They have an email you can just contact them. 
---
Not some shitty as click bait links that make you fill out a form that sometimes can be hard to find. 
---
For example ea, epic games and many more have a customer support email that you can easily contact. 
---
Shoot even some have phone support or online chats 
---
I’m pretty sure back in the folded days of Runescape you could actually call them as well. 
---
The only other way to really contact Jagex is on a really Twitter. We you can’t even direct message them unless they follow you.. 
---
who wants to put personal info out there about there account names on twitter?
---
They really need to do something an step it up. 
---
This game was one of best games. It still could be 
---
But sadly right now it’s the MySpace of Video games.
---
I’m just waiting on the day Jagex sell their company. 
---
An a new owner messes up even more then sells it again an again an again. 
---
That’s sadly what it’ll boil down too. 
---
An I think they know it.
---
When I played wow I was credited multiple times when they had server maintenance.
---
Not homophobia? The white robes and nazis and cannons isn't homophobic?
---
Guys, we shouldn't be so hard on this tiny indie game developer. They're new to this whole running a game thing. You shouldn't expect them to operate like an actual experienced company.
---
75 defense isn’t going to be a noticeable difference in pvm, mostly you’ll be praying to negate the main damage also range would be your primary damaging attribute when it comes to pvm due to most bosses high defense level but then again my
---
man, it’s your account make it like you want!
---
Does the website world select method not work for you? I get the error from the app but if have been connecting just fine through world select page. I do have to try a couple different worlds but once I'm in it works just fine
---
The pve part in the wildy would be easy to balance if you made those changes, so i wouldnt worry about that.
---
I am glad for the success of surgery. But can you please just stop?                                                                We support you coz we are having a same community and hoping everyone here is happy. But really sick of promoting and tf no risk staking.                                                 Do you even understand what you are talking about?                                                           If you found any bug.tell jmod and report but not trying to make it as a content OK?
---
Apart from dragon/rune/etc cups
---
They’ve been like this since last night for me
---
The people who have dumped over 2k hours into the game for an equivalent cash stack? The ones that are now realizing they could have just waited to create the acc until now to get that cash in a month in bh?
---
Pay extra for account slots, 1 account still costs 11$
---
You don't understand that a lot of people keep their subs renewing? i am baffled how you can read what i said and come to this conclusion.
---
Someone is subbed during the time that the servers crash or the game is hard to play due to instability.
---
Days equaling downtime is tacked onto the end of existing subs.
---
If someone isn't subbed when these days are gifted, mark these accounts and email them with a way to activate their account for membership for however long was gifted.
---
This doesn't apply to accounts that don't have memberships at the time... and most of these people who would then be affected are probably going to have been repeat subscribers.
---
1-3 days does not equal a lost month. The lowest amount of days able to be purchased is 14 days through bonds.
---
Opportunity cost does not factor here. How is this a debate? The cost is covered by all the money they're leeching from the community like this, and you know what? I'll bite. They lose when it comes to opportunity cost by choosing to ignore the community with support like this, they lose subs. Talk about opportunity cost all you want, i don't think you guys grasp what it means though.
---
Takes a few minutes.
---
Get a lance or dhcb
---
Thanks, Hero
---
Hope you get your 35 cents back for your troubles.
---
Last year it was during the Winter event. It was part of the reward IIRC. I didn’t do it then because I didn’t have a btw. They did the same for Halloween this year though, where you could get all the previous years items like pumpkins, and Halloween masks.
---
Not storage in the house so still not that great for UIM but hey, we choose to limit ourselves.
---
Man castle wars was the shit! I remember doing it as a kid, and I also fondly remember chopping the vines outside of castle wars with my dragon hatchet, I also remember my dad complaining about that because I was sat in the one spot all day not doing anything.
---
Eh idk. I'm 87 slayer 80 cons and like a 2m cash stack at all times.
---
I'm sure if you play efficiently you'll have a lot of gp but I just mess around a lot.
---
*the real Quest Cape. Sorry Galvek was exhausting af.
---
It's been a long journey, i started my goal at the beginning of this year and I play somewhat casually. Iv made many friends along the way and  sadly lost a few through my journey.
---
I dont know what I should do next, perhaps get it trimmed? But then I will have to exceed combat 85. I only play on 1 account and dont want to invest in another account.
---
Massive thankyou to everyone who helped me. And a massive thanks to Galvek for rinsing my bank from 2m down to 50k.
---
Are my eyes dreaming or is that not a bgs in his inventory? Engage brain before make comment.
---
This is something that does nothing for Jagex except lose them money 
---
The only way I ever see this being a thing is by increasing your membership charge anyway.
---
Sorry for the delayed answer, ive been working cleaning my house because we had some problems :P. Im near to secure my bond just tanning dragonhides, then imma start working on other skills :P. Do you have another recomendation besides Slayer? :D
---
Revenants yes but I've never seen how frequently pkers come to it. I always see clips of people dying to huge teams as if it happens every 10 minutes but it can't happen that much can it?
---
I know, your the literal meaning of one.
---
Massive grats bro! I just got the Olmlet pet recently so I need to start grinding out some CMs too! 
---
Would you say purple sweets is worth investing into for solo CM?
---
Who gets the reimbursed membership?
---
i had about 5k adamant bolts just disappear from my inventory in what seemed to be a glitch.. they werent on the ground, nor were they in my bank / ge. am i shit outta luck or are these one of the things jagex will fix
---
ty
---
Uhm well, yeah, we vote for them? What exactly is your argument?
---
Oh, can you give me more details? I would love to have an afk method to lvl up and make money while i study or do homework :P
---
I mainly play on mobile, you can still get online via mobile. Open your browser on your phone, go to the osrs website, login, select a world and it'll open your mobile client for that world. Yesterday I picked an Australian world to get it work, today are UK world's.
---
I agree that this shouldn't have to be the work around, but it's what works for me at the moment.
---
Nope. Only a bit of lag here and there.
---
Thanks for being so quick, didn’t know the woodcutting was also the same way
---
my RC pure would like a few words.
---
The sandwich lady...
---
Yea 100%, great for tick eating and for keeping your run up the entire raid. Kinds pricey, but the increased points(and drop rste for items) will help pay for it
---
I disagree. The game is down for mobile users, but not for desktop users.
---
If anything, they should only comp players who subscribed through Google Play, _and_ who have the majority of their playtime on mobile.
---
How does selecting a world on google chrome supposed to open up my osrs app?
---
What are those boots?
---
It's not even CLOSE to 500 an hour and I have no idea where you pulled that number from. You can complete 3 tasks an hour if you complete your task the exact second it's given to you. Which is 30 points. Then it's 3 points per kill. Let's say you're on streak so 5 points instead. This doesn't count into the fact that you get griefed by other players, use up all your skips, and you need to get your other account as a target which takes time. If you use hotspot you need to run there and you die alot etc. 500 is a joke of an estimate. It's more like 50-100.
---
For reference 500 points is 12.5m. nobody is getting 12.5m per hour by boosting with one or a couple accounts.
---
Soul wars would be mine
---
Clyde frog?!?
---
Being the fact this is a runescape page... I downvoted. So you no longer have the 123 karma.
---
*not a care was given that day that lost redditor posted unrelated things on 2007scape reddit page*
---
I've had the same issue. Sometimes it works when I use a VPN and change the location to another country. Don't know if it actually helps or if it's random.
---
I just noticed last night impossible to connect to servers
---
In the case of bonds, for example, they're pushing out the timeline that a person would need to renew with a new bond, moving that dollar amount collected by 1-3 days. That's profit they don't receive.
---
If we were to take the extreme---Jagex giving out 90 days membership or something like that, they'd lose money of course. The same thing applies on a small scale. The opportunity cost is the money they should have received for the 1-3 days we're discussing. If that makes any sense over text.
---
Setting quest goals (legends, hero’s, dragon slayer 2, etc.) can be rewarding. Makes you train skills and explore new areas/monsters
---
For the amount of actual measurable hours spent every month?  And compared to other methods of entertainment per hour?  Well well WELL worth $15!
---
I don't think you can even flex with 100 karma
---
They don't compensate  we've had way worst down times b4
---
It sucks but it is what it is
---
Base price, plus $2 per extra slot?

Back in 2007 Runescape (Jagex) had contrilling shares bought by the same company that bought Nexon. They then sold all shares in 2016 to some Chinese investors.
---
Yeah exactly, it’s pretty obvious that Jagex staff has a ton on their plates to deal with in this game.  There’s only so much they can get done and they have to focus on development to keep people interested.  There’s a reason Zulrah bots are getting 100k kills without bans.  They just don’t have the resources.
---
So yeah it’s money and time.
