I don't PK (although I would like to in the future maybe), but this does seem incredibly broken. Support changing this
---
---
---
You do realize OSRS wasn't released in 2004 right?  If he doesn't play way too much this is very reasonable to just now be getting his first 99s. 
---
It's a costume room. It stores a bunch of armor and shit
---
Ign does not check out
---
I would LOOOOOOVE this.
---
The other tasks consist of completing a single wave of BA and buying a granite plate which I think requires a queen kill. 
---

---
Idk who'd wanna pay 6mil for something so easy. Also the start of this comment chain even mentioned getting level 5 in all roles. 
---
I don't like this.  Regular bone whip is better.
---
Think the most you’d pay is 18m with shit stats. Doubt it’s that high though.
---
Fuck yo couch nigga, buy another one you rich mothafucka. 
---
Chain mace is always bis in Wildy I thought 
---

---
5 rooms loads as fast as 9 rooms. 1 is the quickest, followed by 4, followed by 9, followed by 16. you could have 3 more rooms
---
Lava/frost whips sure.
---
Kracken thing, I'm not so sure. Keeping the price of whips up was a major point of adding the tent whip, and that's largely accomplished through PvP. The fact that the tentacle is *soo* much cheaper really sucks though. I've heard it suggested that they make it a 50/50 of either getting the whip or the tentacle back so that both could be worth something. It might be kind of annoying for Ironmen, and it also might not work super well (I don't know the the rates for how many whips vs tents enter the game), but I'd say it's worth considering.
---
You don't have to agree with everything someone does, but trying to do them harm because you don't agree with them is a scumbag thing to do.
---
Getting triggered doesn't entitle you to anything.
---
how often does the lava/frost whip thing occur
---
What a champion 
---
ah gudlife lol thanks for the reminder. i miss BA always had some interesting characters 
---
We disagree on the term 'hate.' Telling a girl who's using suicide as a sort of-threat (maybe I'm wrong, let's pretend I'm not for now) to just end it or don't is not hate in my opinion. I think, to her, it's basically saying "your charade is up, time to get back to reality and deal with things"  
---
I get what you're saying too. But you can basically apply your comment to people calling me an "edgelord" saying I just want attention. What if I'm "mentally ill" and just want attention? Is it right to downvote and call me a POS? You know? 
---
My parents are great people that I respect and hope to be like. :D
---
Imagine you're so fucking elitist you berate people for not prayer flicking at a slayer boss. Get a new hobby. 
---
Ok let me clarifiy since it appears you got your panties in a bunch, it's a versatile weapon that happens to be best at stab, for balancing reasons I assume.  Either its "primarily" or not a stab weapon is irrelevant since what matter is the stats it's got to offer for the task required. So tell me if you aren't going to make it purely better (which is the vibe I was getting from the suggestions, and jagex talking about adding a T72 weapon) how are you going to release this new weapon without devaluing the others?
---
I’m sure you think so 
---
Yeah I was thinking both tbh, I figured once I can be able to afford a dragon pickaxe i will then be Able to more focus  on exp. Does the motherlode mine work best for exp? 
---
Damn almost 30k people don't know about runelite.
---
Honestly makes the caption more accurate. 
---
He should basically end his own life right?
---
Y i K e S
---
If this guy gets 1000 upvotes I'll get all my fake friends to buy 10k maces each
---
He bought them 5k above alch value lmao, he loses less than a mil no matter what
---
Um, yes it does
---
Why is this a joke? I'm new to the game and my account was just hacked last night. I figured the first thing I should do is change my PW and enable the authenticator
---
Bloodveld really are not a bursting task. If you mean for slayer(dust devils and nechryael), normally I just use monk robes or proselyte. Master wand is generally pretty useless, the slayer monster have no accuracy. This is also why it is best to go for max prayer bonus(holy sandals, monk robes/proselyte) instead of mage gear.
---
For maging the upgrade path generally is Occult &gt; torment &gt; Ancestral hat &gt; kodai wand. But apart from occult those only really are worth it, if you are actually going for 90+ mages at monkeys.
---
Realistically though they’d only be begging cus they’re below the breadline, the fact is you can stab a dragon with a magic shield and get enough money to buy mythical powerful equipment and ramsay approved food in a matter of 3 trips (free magic shield by the way, duke of lumbridge) so there’s no need. Unless they’re doing rping which is sad 
---
So post it in the RS3 sub, this isn't oldschool related and doesn't belong here. 
---
How does anyone learn to play the game if they don't play the game and just beg?
---
You have to learn to play the game, if you're given generous gifts, you get spoiled and then won't actually play the game and get bored then quit. When people beg, they're making their problem everyone else's problem. That's not ok. 
---
Helping is one thing, telling someone what to do for money is nice.  Straight up giving them money does not help them in the long run. 
---
"Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."

Used to be 25m. Unstable. 
---
He was streaming himself doing a clue in the wildy, great way to get attention for the rebuild series and definitely a well-deserved death
---
Ah, thanks for the info!
---
I think it would be fucking awesome. Everyone is so goddamn stubborn about the HD graphics thing. 
---
Do you respect your parents? 
---
That would be mind 20’s then, o may be wrong though. 
---
Whats rs3? i heard some chad talking about it but i never could get back into my ruined pures.
---
yes this is what we need. Thank you for a visual for it so it gains more traction. No to whip, yes to flail. 
---
Hahahahahahaa fucking little bitch coward baby pussy boy. Don't fuck with the big boys in future!!!! ahahaahahaah
---
Calling all salad robe nibbas in to ice blitz the water. 
---
Im curious legit what is better about osbuddy? 
---
are you actually processing your own thoughts right now? apply this to the lass in the chat, maybe you did think she was faking it, but telling her to kill herself and trying to do her harm, when she could potentially be suicidal is a scumbag thing to do. From a person who genuinly suffers with mental illness, theres nothing i hate more than people 100% faking suicidal thoughts for attention, its totally wrong to use something thats plagued me and many others for years because you're lonely or whatever, but (1) she may genuinly be suicidal and crying out for help, and can you actually imagine that happening to you if you truly needed someone, and (2) if shes faking it for attention, theres very clearly something wrong with her mentally anyway. if you think the way he responded is anything other than fucking awful, then you're as bad as him
---
Hopefully my mom doesn’t evict me from her basement in the mean time. Not sure where all the girls are supposed to go if she does 
---
They have already stated in a dev blog that the alch value is being nerfed regardless of any poll result. If nothing changes and the alch change goes through he could lose over 100m
---
Im just wondering, cuz this item is so unique to every other Items price fluctuation. Idk why people have to be rude on here lol. I appreciate the nice comments tho
---
I've used both, and tbh while runelite is better and free, osbuddy pro was legit as well 
---
He can just alch them you fucking melt
---
I’m a beggar because I’m telling him about a function ingame? Strange logic but ok. 
---
Grossssssssss, I am mid twenties, don't drink, strenght level 99 like true chad, only curls in the squat rack and pking panties like it's world 18. I am slaying pussy til I get 200m xp now. Watch me.
---
This resonates with me so hard it hurts 
---
Well when someone actually does kill themselves after he told them to do it, at least he can feel good in the fact that he wasn't fooled all those other times.
---
It obviously won't be *purely* better becuase it shouldn't even have a stab option. Every new weapon we get is either completely dead content or it, at least slightly, devalues other weapons. There is nothing wrong with power creep. Its the only way new items get released. However powercreep should be limited. Making a weapon better than the lesser attack style of the hasta isn't completely devaluing it. Im pretty sure it would only be useful at wyverns and currently a hasta is worse than a whip. 
---
ba services
---
People have lost their HC status and have had similar reaction. I gave a personal analogy to provide further "evidence."
---
Maybe something is fishy, but to base it off just the reaction, is no the way to go.
---
Holy shit When you go the the theatres do you watch the movie from outside the door slot? Can’t even see the damage dealt / received properly. 
---
How much for level 5 all roles? That's what I'm interested in 
---
*SURRENDER AND DIE*  
---
&gt;Don’t you mean surrender *OR* die?
---
Well then consider how they planned to introduce pvp armors leaving no hsit on death.
---
They literally proposed a desgin in which super op gear didnt gave any  proper loot on death. Like what the fuck.
---
They want the sinks? Then force people to load 3M cash into the item to bring it into pvp/wildy, so if they want the sink to happen, at least the whole price remains as loot.
---
PD: no way you can drop coloured whips and run back to grab them, really?
---
Glad to have helped! Haha
---
I still respect fire cape
---
This should be a game security feature. Support or ill tell saint nick to bring you tons of unnoted coal and drop it all over your fireplace.
---
Rip Jim Lahey 
---
Check OSbuddy Exchange, those prices are usually pretty accurate 
---
So in a post about custom clients you think your comment is smart? Like having a software do different things isn’t a good point of discussion but fake noob warrior posts are 
---
I said that to him ironically. See how he will feel about it.
---
It isn't  game for stupid people. You're probably better off somewhere else.
---
lol no bro it doesn't take 15 years to do 50 hours of work
---
Yes, engaging in PvP with somebody who willingly entered the one PvP area in the entire fucking game makes OP a douchebag. 
---
*Nikolaj*
---
Commenting to check tomorrow
---
I want to marry who did that.
---
The actual skill of obtaining it bravo, the music and things edited in made me cringe massively but that’s just my opinion. 
---
I have to agree with the above. Back in rs3 this sort of stuff killed any desire to pvp for me. 
---
Wow this is accurate .
---
RL is OSB Pro for free, except even better than pro, so it really makes no logical sense to use OSB though. Ex-OSB user btw.
---
meh, one is free and one is a rare drop.
---
That's about the kc i got mine bro
---
Didn’t like? Saying kill yourself to someone who has mental illness is disgusting. Things like this should not be tolerated on Runescape nor somewhere else. Btw u just owned me le epic libtard style 😎
---
Wouldnt really recommend the dwh as a spec, since hydra only has 100 def, even the bgs is borderline if its worth the defence reduction.
---
Friendly reminder of the asshat that this man is
---
fuck me daddy
---
If he lured the hydra every step he'd miss a lot of attacks. With ranged you can lure at the same as you attack, but with melee you're basically forced to wait.
---
is there a clip of you dying
---
Also why can't genies enter banks? One just died on me because I was 3 steps away from the bank...
---
Of all the things crashed and at alch value it's the abyssal whip needing a sink? 
---
Thanks bro you seem to know a lot! Yeah I have full proselyte and hoping to unlock mm2 soon for the monkeys, what weapon would you suggest besides the kodai wand? And what armour would you suggest for monkeys?
---
but then everyone is going to suicide to an alt when they're tent whip is low on charges ...
---
Sunday is peak day, so still rip for RS3
---
Oh ok then.  Kill yourself unironically.  
---
Commenting to remind myself to do this tomorrow
---
I admit that ignoring it is not the best solution. However, I will argue that it is better than telling someone to commit suicide.
---
Even if you wanted to "call someone out", there are better ways of doing it. You can talk about why using suicide to fish for attention is despicable and harmful.
---
You don't tell them to off themselves. I still don't see what it accomplishes.
---
"Slayer needed Konar's drop table"
---
I don’t think this is worth its own thread, but what does everyone think of A Friend’s recent content? Is he finally trending upwards or will he not commit to some of his series ideas? I desperately want to believe the old A Friend is back but I dunno. Would be keen to hear people’s thoughts. 
---
You're..... Praising him?  Hm.
---
OSRS &amp; RS3 are owned by the same company. And there are tons of posts about RS3 here (mosty memes about how bad it is) so suddenly when we got a toxic player and a representative of  our community it is now allowed? Ok
---
This makes a lot of sense.
---
It should be less powerful than the bludgeon is for sure (since Bludgeon is much harder to get). But for players who are still waiting to get the bludgeon, this is a good intermediate step.
---
In terms of dropping items to prevent losing em, OSRS has come a long way. People used to drop everything near lever and come back and loot it. 
---
The whips are an oversight by jagex and would be fix if this comes to their attention.
---
Welcome to SlayerScape my man. 
---
hm for torso? 80-99-70 acc and prepared to actually play. 
---
It's also good because you're right there while your farming contract grows so you can keep doing them very easily. 
---
&gt;Got lure, got scam and hack on the same week 
---
lmfao gf ur life
---
Source for blank meme template?? 
---
Why would I think it's the same roll if I had noticed it dropped on top of other shit? 
---
Rule 1 when reporting a post is "body of post is not OSRS related"
---
Just because everyone jumps off a bridge doesn't mean you have to. 
---
Lmao so I used to play wow and I actually have multi boxed with 5 characters to instance by myself. But in wow since it was entirely keyboard based you could just use a program to send the same key strokes across clients.
---
Since runescape is mouse based and BA is Dynamic enough to make using AHK undesirable how TF does this guy do it man ?
---
For me it depends. If your bc level is around 70 or below with Fire cape (and not a pure) it’s impressive. Outside of that, I expect high levels to have one.
---
**Bold** 
---
The only thing that would happen is the prices would change, and after a couple months you would be in the exact same position lol.
---
"ah ****!"
---
*gasp
---
"I'm telling Mr. JMod"
---
Why bully someone who is potentially mentally ill? 
---
Fuck I’m 22 now and terrified to age 
---
yeye
---
Lol you’re so naive if you think that’s how people get hacked. 
---
I mean without uniques  its about 2m/hr. its already not 5.5m/hr. It was 5.5m/hr when the claw was 80-90m and the leather was 15m+ those are already significantly cheaper and will continue to get cheaper.
---
Slowly yes, getting 82 construction first than 75 thieving than after that I’ll start runecrafting 
---
You too, bro! 
---
I can't even imagine being this autistic, how do you even function lmao
---
We can have one of each Clue Scroll tier at the same time now right? I got a Master clue from my very first Hard clue and I highly doubt I can complete it
---
It takes 50 hours to get a 99 from the start of an account?  Some people don't play this game for 99s, I've had several friends who have played consistently and have not gotten 99s.
---
Give me 100m first so I have a reason to do it
---
Just remember theres rhat guy Archie talked about on the livestream awhile back that has 100k dragon maces in his bank lol
---
Yeah we should follow rules no matter if something is immensely unethical or immoral. 
---
I will read the ToS and this subreddit’s rules before making a post from now on. 
---
i love Runelite but why do they make it? Ive only seen their patreon which has a small amount of money per month, is that all they get or is there something im missing?
---
Slayer is the most efficient combat training actually. Artisan would've been cool if it came out when the game was newer, but so many people have 99s already that I dont think it sounds appealing to go chop 150 yews trees post 99 wc for an artisan task
---
Then it won’t be dead content if bludgeon is dead content. 2h already almost always suck in comparison to 1h with the exception of scythe and that is limited by vials of blood. 
---
Yes you can. Just like any other untradeables like torso, imbued rings, firecapes, defenders, etc.
---
Lmao it’s like when you see a homeless guy and you offer him food and he’s like “get that shit out of my face” cause he’s just after drug money
---
He's just an asshole in general, when I was getting Lvl 5 All he was there saying some dumb shit and joking around.
---
Sounds like ur sitting at a 2 crab spawn. Try to get in 3,4+ spot for better xp
---
I PRAISE THE LORD, THEN BREAK THE LAW
---
I mean you have bad gear, what do you expect? Try getting a archer rings I. Also do you have avas?
---
Get an archers helm first off. And are you using rapid? Also I would just use mith darts they are way cheaper.
---
Dude, its the internet everyone exaggerates nobody cares, ge shouldn't be saying that and it's kinda sad that he's a streamer. 
---
Also witchhunting is against the rules 
---
We say Alch yourself on this sub frequently 
---
they play rs3
---
**Still unironically ignoring the argument**
---
No, it would be lower than 33%
---
Fletching is pretty much just like cooking when it comes to go made and xp/hr.
---
The most helpful skill is probably runecrafting, xp rates are real slow though.
---
Lets talk about the real problem. Gmauls oper than your sisters tits.
---
I'd go strength. Itll make the others faster and the grind to 99 is tough enough, doing it at one-third efficiency would be brutal.
---
I'm sure this isn't the best thing to say in this sub, but you're probably much better off for not playing that much. It can be an addictive time sink and many people, including myself in the past, can have trouble only playing an appropriate amount of play time.
---
wonderful advice friend. 
---
I would like to play iron, but redoing all the quests is such a pain. I can hardly motivate myself past 250 qp
---
Yeah you can literally just hop on rs3, skip the tutorial and trade the bonds on there in about 5 minutes
---
Not my point, both are unacceptable.
---
Do you have authenticator on your RS account? Email?
---
To be fair it makes no sense for rada's blessing to be better than other blessings to begin with. Literally none of the other diary items are useful other than their utility. That's how it should be.
---
How long have you been gridding zulrah?
---
When there's level 55s walking around with a Fire Cape you know it's no longer impressive to have one.
---
Aesthetic.
---
Got mine today aswell. But it was on the 28th clue.
---
Whenever his head bobs down 
---
Pretty ez fix tbh. Make an instance costing 100k and items unretrievable upon death
---
No
---
then your just introducing new cash into the game
---
bh
---
test this and let ya know
---

The good wiki too → https://osrs.wiki
---
I’m at 180 kc same boat as you well i have 3 piece of shit Bruma torches
---
Yep. I was dumb and half asleep. Thought I was logging into the forums and didnt check the address.
---
Probably kills runners first since they can run passed and cost pts, then kills the fighters/rangers  and healers at the same time or one then the other, prob keeps his other acts on the cannon while they’re not in use in later rounds. It’s probably slower but I bet once you get used to it it’s probably not so bad considering how frustrating it is to play with new ppl when you want to do fast rounds to gamble and someone is slow or losing you lots of pts each round. He’s probably got a pretty good system down. 
---
Check out 12 rules for life, the start is a little slow but helped me a lot with some of the same problems.
---
That or give the ammo-slot Bonecrusher +1 Prayer like a blessing. You could even give it +2 to make it tied BiS; the diary one would still be free and has other perks. But losing 2 prayer for 1 inventory space wasn't worth it; losing 0-1 would be better...
---
Very true.
---
i mean the entire push for the osrs servers was run by pvpers...
---
what weapon would you suggest from 93 to 99 strength? i train specifically through slayer.
---
I just want people to actually lose their shit when they die even below 20 wilderness. 
---
Thats why you insure.
---
Honestly, there is one thing that RS3 did that i really wish osrs had. When they upped the HP and damage amounts, so things are easier to balance
---
no way to skip tutorial, I think this is a membership feature. I don't really want to do this on rs3, let alone three times. I didn't pay to do that lol.
---
Being able to turn items into new GP based on their GE value is what ruined the RS3 economy. Absolutely not. 
---
If they actually prosecuted everyone that told someone to kill themselves, 4chan could crash the judiciary system singlehandedly. 
---
It SHOULD be a crime to threaten suicide for attention.
---
And respect to you for voicing your opinion, add me ingame my username is ‘S3n’, I’d like more friends like you 😁
---
Oof. This does not give me hope. I’m 2k kc and have gotten two JoS and one mutagen but no pet. It took me 2k just to get the tanzanite fang. I’m not very lucky on just the regular rare drops even. Gratz though man! Wish me better luck :p
---
2440+
---
Don’t take it too harshly, you’re not dumb! This has happened to many, many people, otherwise people wouldn’t still do it. The bright side is, rebuilding can be fun!
---
Yeah, I just feel the study is an underappreciated room
---
An aqua dragon is just a fat wyrm
---
Yes wilderness only ironmen are a thing 
---
There should definitely be a way to skip. Should give you the option.
---
Would you alch the same stuff or a variety? I have a hard time getting a good amount of things to alch
---
better yet, instead of trying to fill a gap between hasta and the bludgeon and potentially devaluing a boss that already isn't heavily farmed(sire). Make the tail an upgrade to the bludgeon. give it a few extra crush bonus and a few strength bonus. This wouldnt devalue anything, it would only rival the elder maul but that is easily balanced to ensure the maul keeps its niche uses.
---
maybe make it require 80 strength to attach/remove or something.
---
It could also work similar to the tent whip and be degradable though I feel the majority would like that. If it was the case, I think it would make more sense for the hydra tail to shatter upon depletion rather than losing the bludgeon.
---
&gt; You’re not special or edgy for being this way /u/inhatwetrust, you’re just an inconsiderate asshole.
---
I'm sure that guy you tagged doesn't appreciate you calling him an asshole for no reason.
---
Congrats! you definitely used all your rng for the next few years on that task
---
Chefs assemble
---
that can be said about a lot of stuff, but it really adds up. monthly subscriptions are getting kinda ridiculous now
---
Yes all ui: inventory, chatbox, map
---
Amen
---
I used abyssal dagger. It's my favorite weapon so far.
---
Yikes.
---
Good thing is that I have decent level slayer and can hopefully just grind it out. Bad thing is all my armor is gone. :/
---
And then people only PK with a low hit tent.
---
Oh it doesn't. I'm sure if he found out a family member killed themselves for cuz someone told them to, he'd be totally okay with it cuz it's not "morally wrong" to him. 
---
No, devalues my untrimmed fletch cape
---
Wow, you even censored the chickens username. You’re really thorough!
---
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I got into OSRS about 4 months ago now, got addicted to it quick, but had a fun time with it. I recently just got my second 99 and was playing like 12 hours a day, fucking hated it but couldn't stop. Im trying to stop playing so much video games overall right now. 
---
Unfortunately smiting a tent whip can’t really be made any better. Tent was created to take whips out of the game. If you make tent pks drop a whip then people would just die with their tent when it’s low on charges to get their whip back. It just dropping the tenticle is the best way to keep the whip economy right 
---
Maybe you should go take a break if you can't disagree with someone without getting so angry. 
---
I'll have to check that out, thanks man 
---
As a mid twenties alcoholic with zero life goals and a dark sense of humor, that plays runescape, i can tell you - this doesn't happen :(
---
Pog poor guy
---
Jagex banned runelite like what 6-8 months ago -&gt; big shitstorm, jagex now wont be taking action against third party clients as a general thing
---
To give a different perspective, I enjoy RS streams but I don't have time to watch 5 different streams for 5 hours a day.
---
These vids are cool to stay semi up to date and to know what's happening. 
---
The vids would take ages to curate all the streams, and they would then take ages to put them together in a meaningful order in a way that's entertaining.
---
Most of the people who stream get the majority of their money from streaming and make negligible money from YouTube. And most also have their own YouTube channels where they get either similar, or more, views than rsmoments. So it's not like they are stealing all the views.
---
If you're going to be as insensitive as you are on a topic like suicide just don't talk.  I would have given anything for a friend that passed away to have said anything to anybody about what he was going through, and I was fortunate enough to be there for another friend who really thought he was going to take his own life.
---
You're right that you have no obligation to be concerned for anyone, but don't fucking call suicidal calls for help "fake".
---
Gyarados fits better for zulrah imo
---
Don't you have phones?
---
Should i dump my sceptres that i paid 7.5m for?
---
Getting too tired to hold onto them especially after losing half of my money in the last 3 months
---
Nah do quests. Slayer isn't worth it till base 80 melee as it will just be extremely slow
---
That’s not even something to feel bad about 
---
Just finished mm2, didn't know about it and didn't expect it, and that shit caught me off guard. 
---
Yeah it's pretty crazy just how Meta strength is. I mainly just see it used by pures training that can't use a defender, but yeah Abby dagger is a cheaper choice for STR training if you can use a drag defender. 
---
That being said, I even use that dagger/defender combo just to train strength while slaying, I have a whip, which is 82slash/82str compared to the daggers 75stab/75str, noticeably weaker, but unless I'm training attack or defence the dagger is the way to go, at around 3-4 times the cost of the whip while having noticeably worse stats.
---
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. First half was some of Bernstein’s work and 2nd was Shostakovich’s 7th, Leningrad. Was awesome! 
---
Agreed - put a blank drop instead of the tail.
---
I’m using max gear (except for bp with addy darts) and my pb is 1:54 after nearly 500 kills
---
Imagine thinking that game that takes runescape is not grindy enough so you play a grindier version
---
Haha I haven't even touched that quest but memes
---
That damn beaver is the only reason I’m going for 99 wcing though! Still have a ways to go maybe it’ll happen.
---
Because it would be a pointless buff. They shouldn't be noted
---
Y I K E SSSSSS
---
I did believe that Kieran said it would be rarer to land on the table after the update, so it's probably not a surprise that it's harder to land on it.
---
As soon as I turn on overheads and use all 3 styles, people just tab lol. That being said, I am ok with the current pj timer, just gotta be smart about baits and not risking max, knowing time zones of the singles clans 
---
Slippery slope and all that. If you allow one untradeable to drop for it's equivalent GE value, what's to stop more items dropping. 
---
Fucking lol
---
His girl is apparently pregnant too. Can't imagine that isn't slightly stressful for him. 
---
You should receive just as many purple chests that contain items that are currently on the drop table. 
---
Seriously people should check out this clan, I learned about it on reddit and it's been a blast. Because of these guys I've learned how to do GWD and wildy bosses, and there's always people online who are down to talk or do something.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion but I feel range is the last thing that needs more attention/dev time right now 
---
It's a good idea but the problem (i'm dealing with) is, having a level 95 slayer boss dropping an item that is worse than a level 85 Slayer boss (Sire) with bludgeon. It's kinda backwards, bosses are supposed to give you upgrades, not downgrades.
---
You can swap to the next prayer literally as soon as you see zulrah start to move for it's attaxk. The damage is calculated before the projectile even appears.
---
Even on a level 3 account you can make more money in the same amount of time just scavenging the bounty hunter world above edgeville than begging
---
Since it's so easy to make money, anyone begging might as well be saying "I'm extremely lazy and don't want to make money, I just want to HAVE money. *Your* money". Especially if they have any kind of stats every time they ask they're basically saying they value their own time but not your time. Why should I give anything to anyone implying that?
---
Active place in game? Active place on forums? Active what?
---
most are though.
---
I'm sorry for your friend that died, but many people do in fact use suicide as a way to get attention.
---
Just think of it in Runescape terms. Instead of 99 str, it's hitting the 1000 lb club in the gym. Instead of 99 cooking, it's meal prepping every Sunday. Instead of 99 fishing... it's just fishing. 
---
I'm sure you have some sort of goal in runescape, it's the same irl. 
---
BH deep wild is saturdated with maxed mains and in edge you can just port out of fights.  There's no reason for a teams to have absolute power in both multi and singles.  If you're  in a competent team in deep wild singles the ONLY way you will EVER die is through a melee spec KO, or if you fight another team.
---
I'm not saying that you should have a guaranteed 1v1 in deep wild, I just don't think that teams should be able to tag someone off over and over again with no repurcussions.  It's extremely discouraging to solo pkers.
---
Umm, I did my first 9 slayer assignments with Chaeldar/Vannaka, then went to Konar for my 10th.  
---
And I can see the points add up.
---
So now I go back to Chaeldar for what I thought was my 11th assignment, except Runelite is telling me my streak is back to 0. Did I cancel / reset it somehow ?  
---
Can someone please explain how this works? and is it possible to find out ur streak through in game as in not through a plugin ?
---
wow lol... F
---
Fair enough.  I mean I'm currently grinding zulrah to get those things haha.  Just got myself a suffering and tormented
---
I'm so glad you are enjoying it and learning new content! We are happy to have you! 
---
sick bait 
---
Authenticator on email address? 
---
Nice. If you don't have an imbued heart, you should sell your tormented, buy a heart and use elite void as that set up us more dps. Only switch to ahrims after heart and tormented. 
---
I really enjoy the PVP but HCIM series. Very intense lol
---
What does NH stand for?
---
I'm sorry for the very noob question.
---
BH deep wild is full of maxed mains.  BH edge isn't the kind of PKing that I do.  Teams shouldn't be invincible in singles, there's a reason singles isn't multi.  The only way people in teams die in singles is to other teams or a melee spec KO.
---
We're in agreement it's the one on the left? Because there are two types of girls who respond to that.
---
Lots of bright and friendly folk. I've played with the clan on and off since late last summer, and I've had some of my favorite times in-game with this crew.
---
How's that an exaggeration? The original youtubers who started the push for oldschool were all pvpers and the majority of the people who got it traction with the public were all pkers?
---

---
Technically hes not getting gear from the GE like you said
---
If you're going to insult me, at least [spell "Fuck" right](https://i.imgur.com/fzpUT9e.png).
---
!remind me 357 days
---
This is only an issue when pking at cmb 90+.. and who is quick enough to drop their whip b4 dying? Maybe in deep wild pking.
---
Holy fuck, how the fuck do you get your frame rate so high?????
---
Honest question since I haven't used OSB since I cancelled my subscription a year ago. What does OSB have that RL doesn't have now a days?
---
That’s not true at all, I’m 68 slayer with 75 strength 72 attack and 70 def and I can handle most tasks pretty quickly with just as much XP per hour as any other method.
---
I'm on one right now in GE seeing people have conversations so.... whatever i guess lmao.
---
ive made goals out of spite
---
That's what bh is for, you get a single target and you two get to fight. Monsters act the same way in single combat areas as teams do in the wildy, if you haven't been hit another monster will pj you, even if you're attacking something else.
---
2440+!!!!!!!!
---
There’s a reddit CC?
---
There’s always ways to make it engaging, do what’s fun, play the game for it being a game. You don’t have to make it efficiencyscape
---
Their status
---
idk why yall want osb to die. competition is part of what gets us great plugins. just use runelite if u want free stuff
---
I see your points, but there are already methods of training range for much cheaper than a blowpipe that are MUCH faster xp rates than melee. To give an example of one; cannoning ice trolls is very cheap, even profitable sometimes and nets 100k+ range xp/hr using a rune cbow and broad bolts. Even using darts/knives on 0 def monsters such as crabs/yaks whatever yeild much faster xp/hr than melee at \~70ish for quite cheap. You also have to factor that there are methods to train range that offer INSANE xp rates for the cost of gp (chinning) that melee doesn't have. The same arguments you make for range can also be made for mage. However at the end of the day, range and mage are buyable skills. you either choose to go slower and cheaper or ALOT faster and more expensive. 
---
This is the only correct layout. Where else do pets go?
---
Nah but I’m not sure jagex likes adding instances to every boss, makes the game seem a little more artificial
---
There shouldn't be one, and as said when creating ironman mode, Jagex shouldn't cater the came towards them.
---
100k and items are lost 
---
Thanks!
---
What's a good cc or discord to join for raids learning? Tried to do wedoraids with Chymistry but they kicked me despite being signed up and whatnot
---
I legit died the same way on my first HC was afking and doing something on main, completely forgot the trees attack you 
---
lol same bro 1 def pure.. with no pray.. its so annoying. i am training range with the canon already so i got spare keys. i died both times, but each fight was so close. do you have any tips when you beat him? I literally took like manta rays
---
This is my first post to OSRS (hey everyone, how you doin'?), but I got banned from RS3' reddit for sharing this.
---
They mad.
---
The thing about abyssal whips is it can't drop the whip ever. I feel an alternative would be having a currency that has to be put into items to increase their value.
---
Similar to ether but expand it to more untradeable items. 
---
Start NMZ at 70/70/70 ideally.
---
Nobody wants your help
---
4.6b+ 
---
I just absolutely hate dragon knives. Rune knives were strong enough and now they're even stronger but with a spec bar. At least there's no more rune ranged equipment left to upgrade. 
---
I'm not sure what you're doing wrong (unless you don't have rigour), but that's really surprising given that this is objectively less dps than bp and addy darts
---
The wiki is honestly a huge part of osrs, thanks for existing, I wish the old Wikia would not be google top result an so many categories tho
---
theres no "official" minimum requirements, but i would say 43+ prayer and your other combat stats level 50 or above. The trips might be a little lengthy, but its doable.
---
Use this https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4kqyft/interactive_zulrah_learning_tool/#ampf=undefined
---
Makes zulrah really easy and should work on a laptop just fine
---
Yah, that is a big issue this idea runs into. It is only going for like 3M at the moment, so it would likely be cheaper than Bludgeon unless something else added a lot of the cost. But the other options are to make it worse to the Bludgeon is still the go-to option.
---
yep, how they handled that situation really put a bad taste in my mouth for osbuddy. even if they removed runelite i refuse to go back and support them
---
That still wouldn't change that it would be weaker than the Bludgeon...
---
Yup same thing happened to me, I tried to log back in but saw that they put their authenticator back on it. I’ve sent through another recovery request as my original one was denied.
---
If they can’t get passed my bank pin then I only lose max melee and infernal cape which I can always do again, but fuck this shit makes me worried. I don’t know if the account is locked or not.
---
I would love this!
---
Nice arguement
---
"ich weiß nichts" is a common phrase to trigger Germans as it was what was said after WWII in response to the death camps in their country. Everyone claimed they did not know anything, so people that want to piss off germans like to say it. Look it up. It is a meme.
---
Think i might go share it too in that case lmao  
---
for real tho what a complete piece of shit this guy is
---
I don't think that is what happened. I think its old Lair was just mapped in the Ikov dungeon but it was always accessed through the Lava Maze. They just made a new lair since the old one had a safespot.
---
2 monkey tails and 5 springs in one task for me :/ 
---
/r/wholesome
---
Same boat, 1 pray 1 def. I thankfully have 76 str and 40 att since I was making a f2p pure cause im cheap lol but if you have decent range like at least 50, try to get 50 mage for snare and range his ass combo should work well for you.
---
It was a joke. 
---
Nice autism
---
&gt;Fucking asshole even took like 200 raw salmon I had lol. 
---
RIP
---
Literally just happened to me at cerb, took ~35 minutes to find which world I died on and like 100 hops.
---
Money sinks should not be extreme enough to make players quit the game. Anyone who doesn't end up quitting simply wont bring their gear anywhere. 
---
And someone else's items should never be available for other players to loot. 
---
??? I'm familiar enough to talk about it lol. It's not hard to imagine not being able to trade or use the GE. It's just a limited version of the game I already play, not a completely different game.
---
Fourm or something of the nature
---
TzTokSad 
---
Requires to much engine work.
---
Just very unlucky I guess. Wiki said drop rate is 1/480 but I was dry I thought I might as well ask to make sure I wasn't missing something. Thanks !
---
Like the other guy said, it makes playing more convenient, along with it being much more fun and interactive in my opinion. You can set timers for herb runs, xp trackers that tell you how long you have till you level up in terms of minutes and hours, and many many other things that help you out in game. 
---
All of this is on Runelite by the way, I used to use OSBuddy but then heard about RL, tried it out and have never looked back. 
---
That means cheaper range xp 
---
its worse. use a dps calc.
---
tbow actually isnt a great deal more dps than blowpipe.
---
200k, that way you'll probably break even less the cost of supplies, so it ends up costing something actually
---
You’ve just gotta know. 
---
I'd be happy with this, would spice up end game weapon pool for casual use.
---
If people aren't happy with devaluing the whip then this is a good alternative
---
That wasn't your original point, you said no worlds have been added. This is a lie. I pointed it out, you changed your argument, revealing the previous lie, and that was my only goal. Furthermore, with your admitting to lying, I no longer need to continue this conversation as you will lie to make a point. 
---
Not even sure what your argument is at this point man, I was just trolling tho. Good luck. 
---
This can't be for real.
---
Install a brain
---
I just found the OSRS wiki covering this. I didn't realize there were two wiki's now. Turns out it is 17.8% more rare to recieve a CoX rare.
---
So my 1000 tails become worthless? No ty
---
Where have i heard this before
---
RL prices are the same as OSbuddy's and they are shown in examine texts...?
---
It sounds like you suck my fren
---
Your friend isn’t responding stop messaging them 
---
I am trying for a D defender now. Haven't even gotten a rune one yet. XD
---
Lucky bastard 
---
lol the original mechanics were one of the things that made rs, rs. the threat of death was everywhere, which made the game more thrilling. sadly rs is a lot more safer now, especially with the change made to the value of items kept on death. but i feel the current mechanic have been in place for too long that there's no point changing it
---
PKers are cancer so these are both good featyres
---
Downvote
---
If you KNOW somebody in the Wilderness is a HCIM, and you STILL try and kill them, you should be absolutely disgusted with yourself. First of all, you're ruining their account for absolutely no reason. Hundreds of hours down the toilet so you can have a cheap, immature laugh with all your loser friends on discord. Secondly, ironmen can't defend themselves as well. Unlike you, they have to grind for every single supply and piece of gear they have, they fucking value their items - it's not a fair fight when they can't chug through hundreds of Brews like dudebropker420 on his welfare benefits.
---
If you think killing ironmen in the Wilderness is "fun" or "fair" have a fucking look in the mirror. Pick on someone your own size, and DON'T attack HCIM.
---
Alch urself
---
Wheres the clip? Tried searching but cant find it?
---
2046 total still using rcb btw
---
world count has actually gone up a bunch lol.  
---
All you gotta do is find someone soloing and wait for them to leave, they only stay like 3 or 4 kills max.
---
Go for barrows gloves and a fire cape man! Long grind but worth it
---
Why is Every Word In Your Comment Capitalized? Are You Writing The Title To A Book?

But I can't flip on the GE from there.

inb4 a butterfly flies under the bankstand pile and fucks up everyone

lol gf ur account

get 50 con for mounted glory when u have the money apart from that work towards rfd for barrows gloves.
---
I am hungover and I am sick so I am not at 100%. Just trying to chill and play runescape. Guess im a retard hmm
---
Throw a 200m xp party for her. Get the community together for it massive achievement 
---
They have  lots of overlay features that should be in the actual game, and make it less tedious to play the game, and also provides information that you would look up on google in front of you for example like ge price of an item on examination of the item, i would recommend downloading one of them at least it definitely is worth it considering its just a download and you dont have to install  anything else 
---
the price of rings hasnt ever been higher afaik
---
Hey fuck this guy. Was just pking and secured a kill bitch killed me as I went to share
---
GE-Tracker is pretty accurate
---
Only level 300, so its not too bad.
---
why its an easy skill that gives decent starter cash. between it and hunter you shouldn't be strapping for cash early game.
---
Yeah, they did. I just did a couple weeks ago and Runelite didn’t say shit about which prayer to switch to.
---
This would be fairly easy to do as a Runelite plugin if you felt like taking the time to write it, or get someone you know to write it.
---
You could easily have a 100 character limit password and it wouldn't take much more space lol. The fact sites put like 8-16 limits is baffling retarded. 
---

"Game population has gone up a lot, world count hasnt [gone up a lot]", idk how you cant understand thats what was meant by what i said. Didnt realize i had to be so explicit
---
Ajajajajajaa 
---
Works fine during offpeak hours / weekdays sure
---
All you have to know is that it’s always too good to be true. Especially in the GE. 
---
Then it doesn't solve the problem for PKers, a Tent Whip with full charges has equal strength to a Tent Whip with 1 Charge so if you PK someone with a low charge Tent Whip, you get lower reward than a regular Whip still (because otherwise people would just suicide low charge whips). Jagex really pigeonholed themselves with Tent Whip in particular because the consumable (Abby Whip) is more expensive than the permanent item (Kraken Tentacle).
---
Or or or, we can stop showing range so much love and turn these into new better staffs? 
---
Just download Runelite. 
---
Platinumtokens.com is my goto. I look at the most recent graphs for a trend. Sometimes the GE price is off by like 4K. 
---
Those drawings look sick man! keep it up

Try using chins to aggro healers, made yad a cake walk.

Goes to talk about being in the wildy????
---
Jokes on you. In marriage you never get laid. Now if she divorces you then you'll finally get fucked.
---
Yea it's pretty unrealistic to consider that an actual money making method. I doubt you're even making 3.5m/hr at revs on a normal world if you're not doing it at 3am on a weekday in the long run. Even then the amount of effort/attention required makes it significantly less viable than vorkath or zulrah. 
---
I just subbed to him without watching anything. It better be good. 
---
Neat.
---
The backstory to this is, The girl on the phone was someone the streamer had matched with on Tinder, he had been on a date with her and must have noticed she was a little attached quickly, he told her he loved her but then found out she was underage, she then confided in him saying she was suicidal and that's what led to this clip. After this people were memeing in his chat about it and he would reply with laughing emojis, even his mod were making jokes about suicide. After it blew up and he started getting hate, he put out a message saying that "his phone was on mute" when he said it. But people have pointed out that he's a dumbass who was like on Twitch at the time and the girl could have easily found out.. 
---
Yep. Welcome to open-source software.
---
Got a loot list?
---
Killing PvMers in wild for... GP. Killing PVMers is far less risky than risk fighting, and is a much more consistent money maker than fighting on PvP worlds. Is this a satirical comment? I feel like I'm being baited

---
Coming to ya from 26 😎
---
Way less demand since less people are going for 95 slay
---
Just unlocked them today so yup, that's where I'm going.
---
You just type H i think
---
So, because jagex added 2 ranged items that should be labeled tier 90, means we cant have lower level content? Some of you are seriously braindead
---
If you've never done it before do the proper thing and overlevel/overgear it. You saw my costs 2.5-3.5m. Now let's assume you have 5m total cash stack but REALLY REALLY want the fire cape. Your 81 combat and only 72 ranged.
---
You are not only likely to run out of supplies if you aren't good at minimizing damage prior to Jad, but like I said you're spending over 90 minutes just to get to Jad. So your nerves are completely shot because its like 80 minutes later and you've had 30 minutes now from wave 49 to really think about how you're going to fuck this up again. Of course you die because you only have 76 hp and healers got you to 72 when you missed your first prayer switch. So now you're out like 600-750k in supplies. 
---
Next try, this time you beast through and get to Jad at your personal best of 76 minutes. Nerves are still shot but you really want this, you again mess up and are now up to close to 1.7m in supplies. It's also 4 hours later and you're tired, disappointed, and angry.
---
You try two more times that night, once you die to a unlucky double combo from melee/ranger wave later on and then you die to Jad on the fourth attempt after aggroing all the healers because you ran out of prayer points and couldn't DPS him fast enough.
---
* Total time spent 8-10 hours
---
* Frustration Level maximum
---
* Day Wasted
---
* You lost 4 million gp in gear out of 5 million gp
---
* You now get to look forward to spending all day Sunday rebuilding your cash stack
---
That's how it's going to go down a lot of the time for people who are under level or at level, and in the end you burn yourself out quicker. Plus it sucks to waste all that time only to feel like a loser AND be broke. Your like "why tf can I not even play a medieval click simulator", when in actuality you can you just need to know what you're doing to pull it off with modest gear.
---
I dont think so, I'd say it's similar gp/hr, but xp rates are much lower 
---
I’m so down I want a short bow that can fire dragon arrows so fucking badly.

Is this copypasta?
---
Oooops. You got me there. I posted a thread awhile back asking if clue box works on caskets and they all told me no. Upon further research they actually do. 
---
99 strength is technically optimal it would give you a dps boost for training the other skills.  Honestly though at this stage of the game your not going see any insane changes in xp rates so if you feel like training something else it's not really going to be that much slower.
---
Nope
---
Finally did lumbridge medium this morning on my main which involved getting a task from chelder, got a mask in like 80 kills lol
---
Yeah man, I just sat there for like 45 minutes reloading it every like 30 seconds to see how rapidly things were added and quantity ranges getting updated.  It was like watching a century long aerial timelapse of a city's start to finish.
---
I don't pk at all but I support this 100%. The pking community is thriving and these changes would benefit it greatly and help with longevity.

Yes, you'll get a chatbox message saying that its defense is restored

It's pretty funny calling a closed source project more trustworthy than an open source project.  In RL you can audit the code yourself to make sure it's "trustworthy" and frankly I have no clue why he thinks is "Runelite" hacking people when the plugins are made by the community and *also* checked to make sure does nothing malicious before it's added to the client officially.
---
For the everyday user, the biggest difference is, indeed, that RL is free and OSB Pro is not.
---
A
---
shoulda kept it to yourself tbh 
---
First episode he already cheats by accident by skipping the agility grind and silver bar thing.
---
One of my favourite things about settled is he tries so hard to keep his Ironman “pure”. Way too many single location ironmen add bullshit rules to cheat their account and it totally kills my interest in their series. 
---
I understand this is wrong, but it's still the wrong place to put it, pm one of the jmods about it if you feel there was something wrong that needs their attention. We don't need the leddit special forces harassing anybody though.
---
Thanks ya'll! I really appreciate the good vibes :) (ping /u/ThePaleLion)

It's like being dry on the dragon defender, down to your last 20 tokens knowing you will be teleported out soon. When in comes the noob, gets it on like 4kc. Turns out said noob doesn't have 60 def to wear it and leaves.

Hey dude, if your looking for a clan me and a few friends are just now starting our own clan. Its a mostly social based clan but we are also invested in pvm as well, including raid training. If you're interested feel free to message me.
---
What exactly is the point of them wanting to remove the "Fun Weapon" feature away from the Golden Tench? 
---
absolute chungus
---
Tribrid is actually skill based and it's the type of PK you don't like? It's the least random and takes the best clicks to beat the other person. It's tedious because the skill cap is high and the only way to increase cap in Runescape is to have you juggling more clicks and making split second decisions on what to pray.
---
How is other PKing more fun than that? It's just RNG fests and people complaining about safeing.
---
What? Context please
---
I’m glad the cosplayer is on reddit. Try to ignore all the bad vibes my dude, because seeing RS at PAX made my night.

I follow the everyone at the GE is a scammer besides the bank teller and exchange person.

Tired of this discussion, if it comes to a vote my vote is no

im not mocking anyone. i literally cant be happy because i cant remember and it really sucks.

For training strength yes it’s good. Otherwise use whip and d def until you can afford a bludgeon.

Lol wtf. If you go into the wilderness you are risking getting pkd. If you don't Wana die then don't go in. I don't feel sorry for any hcim that dies in wildy. That's your own fault
---
Honestly, having something like this happen is the most demotivating thing ever. I had a few buddies just start and may just give them the remaining GP I have. Took me so long to build up to the T Bow, and took 5 seconds to lose it. Oh well, such is life I guess. 
---
It's really easy to learn in full tank gear and just camp mage pray, flick on melee pray when bandos is about to hit you, swap back. I took guthans helm and top + vskirt and crystal shield starting out. I would recommend that or whatever better you can afford.

That's not how it works.

Lol mad shill :) 😂😂

Both communities have cancerous players. There is just less rs3 players.

you didn’t take into account the rollback that happened :(

Very agreed!

Stop spamming this on the sub every 5 minutes. I've seen at least 4 of these same posts today on the sub.

That's fair, in all honesty I missed your point about souls and was thinking bloods only. So you're probably right

For the most part a lot of Ironman accounts follow a "meta" path or guide path if you will however you want to put it.  
---
However some people changes things up by creating area only Ironman accounts, so they intentionally limit the content they can do by locking themselves to a specific area of the map.
---
They're not? That was the point, surely.
---
I post once a day, but cool.
---
That’s just a testament to how stupid broken the Bp is. 6m item that outranks every other item in the game except a 1b item, but competes with it and is better than it in 80% of situations.
---
yeah hitting higher = more dps
---
I am one of the 26 people who still use it

What do you think?

Yeah but who gathers those resources? Bots keep the economy flowing.

Me and 25 others

Good job! I just watched a guy get 99 down there earlier today

Do you know where they are?

Blessed sarasword is t75 and will be far inferior to a whip with a str option

So if you’re not subscribed, and it’s completely optional, why complain?

It's got a relatively decent special attack while abyssal whip does not.
---
Also i think BSS needs a buff too.
---
Nice try hackerman
---
I'm pretty sure that's not true. Due to the amount of experience you need to get as the level gets higher, it's more efficient to train attack up aswell, to some degree - granted, I don't know how much. Accuracy is important too.
---
That being said, I think a lot of us (myself included) are obsessed with getting 99 strength, and tunneling it hard.
---
They hack the richest players on a small scale to not attract unwanted attention

No one forced you to pick the Hardcore mode.

and hear me say "noob" as I walk by you, not so bad right?

Maybe if they end up not doing a bone whip but a stand alone weapon like a flail or bone mace.

If it did I'd quit same day

Wat? All they said was that the price of subscribing to anything (specifically OSbuddy) adds up to a significant amount of money with time and also pointed out that subscription services are "getting ridiculous" where they were presumably referring to the fact that more and more of these subscription services for everything are popping up and that it isn't economically viable to just subscribe to everything.
---
Either way I dunno why you're expressing disbelief at people making opinionated statements on an internet forum. Are you new to Reddit or something?
---
103549 runelite users you mean?
---
The paths you can take differ substantially even if the end goal (maxing/all pvm stuff/all completionist stuff) is the same
---
Idk what you consider skillful but efficient ironman bossing is way harder, you cant just park your justicar alt at zammy or bandos, afk team raids etc. solo raids/gwd is way harder than meta main methods not considering you also end up doing content with far under max gear
---
Idk about your examples. When you choose to do things matters. I wanted to rush raids so i got my occult, dwh, pipe and hasta in a power amulet and skipped most skilling grinds for example. Im now at the same spot as any late game iron but how i manage getting there was relatively unique

yes it's true

Make Gmaul 55% spec, make a 5m+ attachment revert it to 50%. Add korasi with decent requirements (wild hard dairy or elite) fix color whip, add corrupt pvp armors with degrade, remove world hop lock/increase a lot. Make poll system require 10 player kills to vote on a pvp poll, fix spec tab/revisit a fix for spec tabbing (only first 10 secs of cb) fix pvp spec transfer abuse bug. If none of those add soaking and call It a day. 
---
Could be, also could be some guy wasting time doing something stupid, seen it before :p
---
Welcome back to reddit
---
You're making the assumption that his audience has the same expectations as yourself. Based on the response he got from his buddies, I think it's safe to assume they're among the people that don't expect the internet of all places to be one massive safe space. He laughed, his buddies laughed, I laughed, lots of people laughed. If you don't find it funny that's totally fine bust just because you don't like it doesn't mean no one else is allowed to like it.

Nice sentence structure and spelling, seems like your parents have much to be ashamed about too

Technology doesn't exist.

Nice man

Thank you for your confirmation

i like saying ar da goon.

Pegasian Crystal is like 100k and is a unique from the 3rd strongest slayer boss, why do all the uniques from Hydra need to be worth millions? 
---
&gt;that justifies the suicide comment?
---
yes. my ex always threatened to kill herself after we'd break up and eventually I got tired of it and told her to fucking do it and just leave me alone. It wasn't my problem, and it's not this guys problem either. Is it tasteless? Sure. Is it the abhorrent act that this army of white knights is making it out to be? No.
---
Not to mention your choices can ruin or end someone else's life.

but is the bird okay?

Up to 30 tp

So uh

About that girl you told to kill herself
---
Yeah
---
Get the fucking hell out of the internet
---
Buying untradeables for gp was never polled. You are thinking of tradeable "rares" ie partyhats.
---
I'm surprised you even have to ask
---
Worst part this has happened like 4x in the last month

Almost 20 feeling old af
---
runed your day

There can even be legal action with this.
---
What really? It’s not the classic 2min to get your stuff? 
---
its so fucking stupid how this community cant present their points without saying shit like "this is what ruined rs3".
---
Tents as is are better for the game then seeing one on the ground after killing someone 
---
Has anyone got an update on the girl? I'd like to know shes okay and didn't hurt herself.
---
My dad who works with Jagex also said no.
---
What makes you think that? Genuinely curious.
---
RS3 players haHAA
---
That's perfect! Were ready when you are :)
---
Would put some use to logs other than just firemaking and increase their value but at the same time, would make it tedious since higher level logs have a longer burn time and collecting them.
---
Interesting though!
---
Ty pic, apprciate man 
---
He's risking absolute bank!
---
Multiple kills on release day?  
---
It takes 32 hours to grow.  
---
I've gotten 2 from farming contracts mid tier, and 3 more from tree/herb/fruit runs.   
---
The chance of finding a seed possibly does scale with what level farming item you're growing, other than that its all RNG based. Sometimes you get unlucky.  
---
Just keep growing the highest level tree's herbs bushes fruit trees calquats (Dirt cheap 12k xp every day and you can boost farming levels) You'll get seeds eventually don't sweat it.
---
Didn’t they change the m chances so 2nd death deletes items? 
---
Or at least if you get killer by another player you will lose all items no matter what. 
---
I also saw speculation that he eithe didn’t bring a lvl 30 tele or didn’t realize he wasnt tb’d at 30 but he could’ve been much more prepared nonetheless. 
---
If I tell you, I won't make any money.
---
Make Tentacle whips have the same mechanic as ring of recoil. The amount of charges it has is tied to the player, not the item. Make Tentacle whip tradable since the abyssal whip and kraken tentacle are both tradable anyway. Now when you kill someone and they drop their tentacle whip, you can pick the entire item up. Problem solved.
---
ags is better
---
so is dclaws
---
found the guy who couldn't get a torso without leeching
---
No, you wouldn't lose anything. Items stay on the ground for one hour after suiciding; and you can die multiple times over, they'll still be there to grab as long as you get back within 1 hour.
---
The only thing you'd risk are untradeables, which won't drop on death... But again many can be stored in a POH.
---
It's already poasible to solo all current  osrs bosses, why make it easier? If you change the range meta that's going on right not, and then buff armor, might be a better idea.  
---
Exactly, is nothing you joke let alone start laughing over, especially after suicidal thoughts / tendencies.
---
Where is your blessing
---
For sure! I suppose once ashes have a use then there could be good reason! Maby you could load up your POH fireplaces with a huge stack of logs and then collect all the ashes at once or something :o
---
Always triggered me
---
No it's perfect.
---
He also took zero precautions typical for UIMs doing wild clues.
---
You can just suicide to nettles in edgeville to protect your tradeable items for 1 hour. This is what I do for deep wild clues.
---
This is it Chef

Osrs loser spotted

Don't download a keylogger onto your computer

RuneLite has a dope GPU mode that makes it run better and extends render distance. Really the only thing I use on it. Also skybox is amazing.
---
Im all for some dark dank memes, but damn somet about this doesn't sit right with me... Hope this kid gets fucked up by karma...
---
just crunched some hard numbers. If I'm right, the xp per hour is about
---
3.7k cooking xp/h
---
57.3k hunter xp/h
---
43.6k fishing xp/h
---
thank me later
---
Keep at 1 or 13
---
Here's my theory on alching 
---
The amount of time your going to spend researching items, clicking in the same place over and over again, getting small amounts of xp and gold, doesn't work out to be an efficient way of reaching high levels of magic.
---
I may be bias because I had access to the kodai wand, tormented bracelet, and eternal boots, however I feel like I could easily make back my money from doing high level slayer/pvm. 
---
I could spend 40 hours bursting mm2 caves for 99 magic and spend roughly 40m
---
Or I could spend 100 hours alching and spend 100+ hours making 250k an hour
---
I can go to rune dragons and consistently make 2m an hour, so for 100 hours, I could get 99 magic and then  still have time to go pvm to cover the cost and make money. I ALSO hitpoints experience while doing this, and it's semi-afkable.
---
Choice seems clear to me. Unless your an iron man that is
---
It wasn't a tasteless joke, it was potentially dangerous. I think we can all laugh at something we know is actually dark or offensive, but to laugh at a genuine suicide victim being dismissed with "kill yourself" is taking the definition of "joke" very far. That people were laughing at it doesn't change this fact. Some people will laugh at a beheading. 
---
If there is a vulnerable individual at the butt of the joke, and said joke can do actual physical harm to that person, then it's not a joke, and you shouldn't use the word as a shield to protect your "sense of humour". 
---
I can almost picture a future where noobs follow people training firemaking, picking up all the ash to make money :P
---
Just leave it alone and don’t post it all over the internet? Kthx 
---
\&gt;Swamp-only character

---
Unjustifiable.
---
I played with him, he was nice.
---
Was hard on Queen since she can max 13.
---
I would get 75 def, 75 pray and 99 range
---
If you do that, you can theoretically get 146 combined str and atk levels before it makes you level up. That being said, don’t bother making a pk acc if you don’t have a main acc.
---
I would cap your attack at 50 for gmaul allowing you to have 90+ str
---
&gt;If you don't like cutting trees or think clicking rocks or fishing spots for an hour is literal torture, you don't have to! That's why you should stick to PvM, get that gold then use it at the GE to buy logs, ore and fish.
---
This is caused by diaries and the max cape.
---
|**Diary**|PvM Perk|Skilling Requirement|

|Fremennik|Noted DK Bones|82 Runecrafting, 80 Agility|
---
PvMers and Slayerscapers feel like they need to complete elite diaries to make their PvM more efficient, which happen to have steep skill requirements. The max cape is worse. So the majority of people training skills aren't skillers who enjoy skilling, it's PvMers who really just want it over and done with. So skilling updates tend to be focused on alternative AFK methods, or ways to boost the XP rate altogether. These aren't skilling updates, they're QoL buffs to PvMers. 
---
Between every skilling moneymaker being inevitably tanked by PvM/Slayer updates and constant whining to """"fix""""" 1-77 RC and Agility it doesn't always inspire a lot of hope that skilling will be ever anything more than an arbitrary barrier to PvM buffs and max cape. 
---
Yikes so they would have got Tbow + another 500m or so in gear if they dc'd you one second earlier :O
---
if your g mauler 13 prayer, if youre 60 attack 16

That's not what context means.
---
"Thousands of other players" Empty G.E
---
No. Iron man has no friends.
---
Atleast the people he’s streaming with has a sense of humor and got a kick out of it.
---
YEAH LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Pretty sure you can request Jagex to delete certain data they hold about your accounts, meaning it can't (assumably) be used in recovery requests. 
---
Or that
---
No xp waste lads!
---
semi related, really wish there wasnt the barbarian fishing requirement
---
id love it get a hasta on my defense pure but you need 15 str for the training
---
reeeeeeeeeee
---
Addy plates, rune 2h/legs/skirt, dragon baxes, dd, dlong. 
---
Literally just look up the high alch price, subtract cost of nats, if it’s higher than the purchase price then bang. Nice and easy. 
---
I put bulk orders of things like DBaxes and rune legs over time. Then alch all at once whilst doing agility. Was getting around 150-200gp per alch. Nothing crazy good but it’s free money. 
---
another two snapdragon seeds boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys thats what im talkkking abouuut.
---
Not everything needs to look slightly above average. This is a direct move towards squeak and NXT
---
I kinda wanted to see the top comment be Serene ripping this guy apart in his own trademark way, like even he isn't this low
---
Tfw when u see the clip and see he cheated most of it at start 
---
So it sounds like it having you account hooked up to an email is a good way to go? 
---
This is why 2FA on email is so important, I advise anyone else reading this to make sure your email is protected. 
---
Maybe reread what I said. Don’t be dumb now.
---
In other words "I thought him telling a suicidal person to kill themselves was funny. Now stop having empathy for somebody who needs help, you're making me look bad". 
---
My hunt for an actually entertaining OSRS streamer that doesn't seem like a conceded twatbag goes on. 
---
You can find me in those perfect &lt;10 viewer streams where we can actually talk instead of just look at a scrolling wall of spammed emojis.  
---
or how about the "I CALLED IT" after calling the same drop you are hunting for every kill. "I JUST KNEW THIS TRIP WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE"
---
I disagree, I only found him with his new series and am loving it but I went back to watch some of his old content and do not really enjoy it. I would expect he's picked up plenty of new viewers with the series because it feels so unique.
---
Pointless saying it’s a “ general location “ Iron when it’s not
---
Only because of blowpipe; doing it with RCB abusing the safe spots and trying to be safe as much as possible without wasting supplies is still one of the biggest trials of attrition in the game (barring stuff like Inferno.) If you rush to 75 range and blowpipe half of it, it's kind of a joke. 
---
Maybe it could have a special attack that has a chance of damaging the user as well as the target (flails are pretty dangerous to wield).
---
haha, the joke was "kill yourself". Clearly one of the top minds among comedians. 
---
If you get killed in pvp with a tent whip, that's exactly what happens, it becomes fully broken and therefore tradeable.
---
Unfortunately the broken state of a tent whip is less representative of the value of the actual item than the broken state of a barrows item.
---
I always say the same thing, rs3 is incredibly toxic, some of the worst people I’ve ever met are on rs3.
---
One time, a guy I had known for a few days told me he was going to kill himself but he didn’t because of me, and then after he used that to emotionally blackmail me, if I didn’t reply fast enough he was going to kill himself, if I gave anyone more attention than him he was going to kill himself, even if I said something he didn’t like he was going to kill himself. I did what he wanted for a couple weeks because I was so scared that he actually meant it, until I just decided to stand up for myself and tell him he can’t use that to control me anymore and then I blocked him. He never did it!
---
Also, one particular piece of shit got mad at me and said he was glad my cat died. My cat was my everything and he knew how much my cat meant to me, which makes it even worse.
---
So yeah, when I started playing old school I completely cleaned out my friends list, I’ll have nothing to do with that toxic community ever again.
---
a prodigy
---
Superior osrs
---
I agree with you I’ve done all sorts of revs, peak hour, non peak hour, skulled and unskilled, craws bow, chain mace or blowpipe....revs are indeed superior GP/hr with agility shortcut and with a good 6th sense. It’s brain dead, simple (just rigour/piety + keeping pray up), Super afk! Also you have a greater chance of hitting a valuable unique than at Vork for example, where the only unique that’ll boost your GP/hr are the visages. 
---
Even if DC I’m alive 95% of the time at revs vs vork where I’d be 100% dead. When I get Pked I risk the bare minimum and it’s so easy to re-gear..,,
---
100% I am so lucky that it happened when it did, any other point throughout the raid except for Ice Demon chopping kindling and they would have got everything, although it becomes pointless if I don’t get the account back and they get the pin deleted.
---
Haha fair
---
Not as far as I know -- I'll test it with a useless item next time I need to clear my looting bag.
---
Polled the UIM CC and they confirmed my statement. 60 minutes on the ground no matter what (minus a server reset).
---
who hurt you pal?
---
The avernic defended is +28 crush attack and +8 strength. The dragon defender is +23 attack and +6 strength.
---
There is no "only make it better than bludgeon with avernic" because that difference is fucking miniscule. Why would anyone touch the bludgeon when its 30mil and gives you like +5 crush attack over the other alternative?
---
Hah. Got nothing better to say? At least i don't play that ezscape
---
Exactly!
---
Whos that chick that streams and always blows my ear drums with the ol...hey lets g0o0o0o
---
i'd actually had a heart attack if this happened, that'd be too much excitement for me
---
Player 2 will still get drop. Player 1 will have to wait a min before they can pick it up
---
You afk everything you just sit in the corner and they do 14min games
---
Actually it's 1 in 2 (50/50)
---
6 I think

Snap grass
---
Snapdragon

Poison ivy
---
Potato Cacti
---
Watermelon
---

Then got another herb contract which I didn't think was worth skipping since they grow so fast.
---
Anime seeds work just fine for me
---
She's getting a lecture from JBP and she's playing fucking OSRS. 
---
Still works perfectly fine. I did it starting from 75 on my alt, but I have plenty of friends who did it from the low 60s to rush RFD requirement.
---
You're the one making life so much better for every low viewer-count streamer. As a streamer with 0-16 viewers, seeing people in the chat is the best feeling
---
I have almost 7 capes but cooking Cape is still one of favorites.  It brings me back to 2008 when I stayed up all night over at my grandmother's and at around 2am (now my birthday) I got 99 cooking.  Had several others stay up with me to celebrate.  I didn't have many irl friends so even now, over 10 years later the cape is a bit of happiness and a memory.

Wear what you wanna wear, wear something for a memory.  :)

Just started playing on my iPhone, my question is, how long can I play before I run out of things to do as a non-premium player?

implement bonfires. everyone tosses longs into the big ass fire and gets ashes out of it.
---
You don’t lose an addy dart every time you fire? You haven’t done animal magnistism yet?
---
Hard to judge how many people use it because the runelite and osbuddy player counts are not based on currently online users.
---
At times the playerbase of runelite+osbuddy has been higher than the total logged on users on the main site
---
LOOK at that 
---
What is the context?...
---
I haven't used a Mac, but in Runelite are you using the option named "Stretched Mode"? In "Stretched Mode" there's a check box to keep the aspect ratio of the default game interface.  
---
Another thing to try is to click on the in-game options (wrench by the log out door button), display, and choose the button on the right. This will fill the whole client screen, but will only show the important (interact able) parts of the interface, however. 
---
That´s not entirely true. Most of it is from old breaches, but there´s also around 140m new email adresesses and 20m new passwords.
---
Also collection #1 is only part of the entire collection. #1 is about 90GB, the entire data is supposedly about 500GB.

You've been living under a rock ;D

Req to equip dragon axe = 60 ATK
---
Req to use dragon axe for woodcutting = 61 woodcutting 
---
Hence why you are still using a rune axe.
---
Bank your rune axe and it'll say you don't have an axe that you can use. 
---
What took me to the next level was slayer and bossing. Being high level and having quest cape pretty much gives u access to some of the best money makers out there.
---
Also farm runs. They are super quick and you are always making money. Also things like buying daily battlestaves from varrock diary rewards.
---
The key is to unlock end game content and to always be making daily cash (farm runs/dailys). Rather than just find 1 really boring way to make ue 200-300k and be bored. 
---
What are your current stats? That would also help us, guide u better.
---
Before or after you fight it? Lol

There goes your 2019 rng

Last time they implemented lootshare it caused massive inflation. Granted, OSRS can learn from those mistakes, but last time didn't work out all too well.

Has he even logged in since maxing? I’d love it if he made some sort of an update video or maybe even a bank video on his channel.

i mean jagex did add lootshare in its recent team content, look at raids1/2.
---
coinshare/shardshare failed polls like legit 2 or 3 times, dunno.

I’m hoping that they aren’t botting on my account but I think they wouldn’t because there is about 2b on the bank that is worth more to them

I finished a trip at hydra (got the leather drop) and went to ge to sell. decided to go to the gym so just logged out with my max range gear still on.

Got to gym and panicked because I hadn’t banked everything, thank god for mobile, just got on and deposited it away and logged.

You can ornament so much stuff for fairly cheap these days that I literally lose nothing when I die at Bandos other than the occasional blessing depending on if I’m tanking or DPS.
---
not the specs
---
Virus scan your pc. Change pass and pin. The mods will not revert 
---
Not really sure what could have happened, however dming them on Twitter is actually sadly the best way to have even a slim chance of receiving some sort of assistance, or at least that is what this subreddit would lead one to believe.

Letting his kid play on his account maybe?

i like the barebones aspect of not having lootshare. feels more natural and drives more community interaction.

---
First of all, you could have used your original account for osrs aswell with the same login etc. Didnt have to create a new one. (If you still have complete access and so on)
---
Second. You can ask for a login log or something I guess. But idk where. 
---
And last, setup more security. Bank pin. Authenticator for RS aswell as for your Email. (Wasnt mentioned above)
---
Not really no
---
This also applies to Orn kits people do this with their defenders which is kinda rag imo. they do this with whips aswell, the most obvious fix would be to remove the drop option so you could only revert it. this would be a fix for orn kit dropping too
---
You clicked their link and submitted all your recovery info for them to see, this is called being phished.
---
It's even worse in games like League. I swear 99% of streamers can be replaced by another streamer with the same accent. Everyone just says the same shit over and over again, it's awful

I finally got my first Zenyte at around 1100 KC.

Yeah that’s the biggest reason I don’t PK is because I don’t wanna lose that much money when I know I’m gonna die half the time. - I don’t agree that the equipment should break on death but it makes sense because untradable items (even slightly damaged barrows equipment) can’t be traded. 
---
actually... it’s a little more complicated than that. 
---
because we’re dealing with vorkath drops, which are from a blue dragon, there’s a 1.7x rarity bonus added to the draconian visage. plus you’ve got to factor in seasonality. skeletal visage drops by a 3.2x chance in NH winter SH summer but he’s a big lad so that’s a 0.02x modifier. as he has 112 bolts left he has a 1.12 chance at hitting the rare drop table which has a 1/1000 chance of slapping you in the face which if it leaves the marks of 4 fingers gives you a flat 1/15 chance of hitting the super rare drop table of shrimp, manta rays, cactus spines and, you guessed it, skeletal visages. so roughly it’s more like a 1/25,000,098 chance 
---
that's what you get
---
How do you get the rs2 hud?

God damn NH Winter's.

Man that is just sexy to see tbh

did you have 2fa for emails? just curious. you mentioned you have it on your account, but what about email? if not set it up in settings. i feel sorry for u man. hope jagex can see this. 
---
Yep! You can either use your authenticator app or get a text message to your phone. I prefer using an authenticator app.
---
Both Gmail and Outlook support authenticator apps. For Yahoo, you can only use text messages.
---
I'm assuming you use Gmail.
---
Log in to your Gmail. Click on your picture icon (top-right circle). Click "Google Account."
---
Click "Security" in the left column.
---
Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification. Select "authenticator app."
---
The process should be the same as if you were putting it on your RS account.
---
No I didn't. I went through no link; I went directly to Jagex's website. If you read the post again you'll understand what happened.
---
people can do what they want honestly they probably just dont wana be a target. i dont bother personally because i got 2step on my email i know its impossible to get into my account email/Osrs without my phone which is right in front of me. this is my reasoning behind not bothering with editting too much

You will acquire more days of membership but still acquire another 30 days with monthly membership fees

Because it does not have an active traded value.

I mean you deserve some kind of compensation for using free OSBuddy in 2019
---
Maybe abyssal whips should have some lore attached to them which means they can’t be used in pvp?  I understand that they were introduced originally to take some whips out of the game but OP’s grievances are valid.  And you’re right too, if whips/gp is dropped then that kind of defeats the point of what the mods were trying to achieve originally.
---
idk it seems alright, I've been farming it for hydra and you can skip 2/5 tasks with elite diary, and there are a lot of 2 minute tasks (3 addy drags, 7 wyverns, whatever) so I haven't been using many points and still generally averaging ~30k/hr

It would actually be nice to see Serene his pretentious, thesaurus talk to scold this streamer but he saves his thesaurus for us when we tell him to shut up.
---
This made the game fun for me, progressing was no longer money making but rather playing the game. Not hardcore or UIM I think both are overkill, just regular iron

This a joke right

I hope PVP dies along with you. Go play CoD

Why not just give bank pin before you can move or do enything with character, just slap a black screen and back pin after logging in

Everyone's experience is different. Generally speaking, RS3 people are more toxic. OSRS we can be even worse depending on where you go (world 2 GE, wilderness) but as I write this, I'm chilling at woodcutting guild and we're talking about childhood snacks right now.

&gt; Jagex won't even remove the world hop limit which would be so fucking nice since there's like 300 worlds now and hopping between them trying to find someone in the wilderness is almost impossible.
---
World hopping onto someone is a dumb mechanic and it'd worsen the state of PvP if they increased it's frequency. They need to completely remove instant logouts and world hops from Wildy to actually make it decent. 
---
It feels great when it works, but often times it's just a repeat of the patch you just claimed and you gotta wait :(

It works fine it can get a little laggy at times but there is also a 160$ one that has a better processer. But ive been playing on the cheap rca one for like a month with no problems, and im using runelite.

ur calling him autistic and *he's* the piece of shit? 🤔🤔

That’s amazing!

I don't PK at all but can understand how shit this is. You have my upvote

Very nice :)

It makes me hopeful to see so many people getting it early, I would love to get this item on my ironman, 4 kc so far, hopefully I can get lucky as well
---
Damn all those activists... dude what u gonna do over 90% people here using RuneLite or RSBuddy. This is also 3rd party for me but im not complaining while i still use original client. World isn't fair place get used pls.

Women aren't video games?

I mean... You're not wrong...

it's too late for that, he's in a multi combat zone, he is already hacked

Fair point.
---
why?
---
I've played since 2002, I had a similar issue, I lost my main in 2009 and was unable to recover it ever since. 
---
I've played other accounts, started again when OSRS came out and enjoyed the game once again, but I got bored of being a main.
---
An ironman made me enjoy the game much more and really I think it was because the sense of progression is much more noticeable.
---
Upgraded to a full set of rune armour? It feels good! Opened that medium clue scroll and have some dragonhide armour? Amazing! 
---
Small goals that were easily looked over on a main due to trading and buying doesn't happen as an ironman.
---
My suggestion would be to make one and see where you go with it.
---
Goodluck!

On that note... "not another weapon re-skin"; isn't it is just a Bone Verac's Flail instead of a Bone Whip?

I expect nothing. Its kind of like warning to ppl doing corp solo that this guy aint just there to hop, hes literally waiting to steal kills. And he is hopping around worlds doing so.

Nah get 15 for the Ava's. No reason to stay 13 prayer  to save 0.2 combat levels lol
---
It's 1/5000 for you to get the second one assuming you already got the first one. But that's not what we're interested in here since even getting the first one is a big deal. So 1/5000 to get the first one, and getting the second one on the same kill is 5000 times rarer. So (1/5000)^2 = 1/25m

Chumming is faster so it isn't 'pointless'.

Replace the Abyssal Dagger and Blessed Sara Sword, hurt the Bludgeon, and even hurt the Abyssal Tentacle since the Aggressive Item puts it closer... Probably not a wise idea unless you cut some of the stats.

Never understood why people stand there shutting the door on all the flax spinners. Anyone?

You do realize the problem with tent whips dropping a whip on death, right? There would be absolutely no reason to use a regular whip ever if u could just suicide to your alt to gain the whip back when it’s almost out of charges.

Mod Ash and Mod West referenced boosting in last weeks Q&amp;A about the door and the changes they made to them, it's expected behavior and no mention of reverting it.
---
Honestly they add great content to the game. Lots of them keep their private chat on so you can follow them around pking them all the time and force a famine in their village. It's fucking epic. Nothing beats DDS specing the food off some peasants table.

Still more woke than people tryna tell me blowpipe is better tbh

We had pures here last night. You are more than welcome as long as you have decent gear. 
---
What a load of bollocks 
---
Do you not think there's a reason a very small percentage of the community uses the vanilla client on pc? It's objectively worse. Now, I'm not saying the game needs all the features the 3rd party clients have. Things like clue scroll hints wouldn't be appropriate for vanilla. But other aspects like being able to highlight tiles, show ground items, and seeing a compacted list of items rather than hundreds of leaping salmon and sturgeons when you right click is almost necessary (i.e. salmon x 30, rather than listing salmon 30 times so the right click menu goes off the screen and you can't pick up the clue scroll you dropped on the pile of fish because it gets put at the bottom of the menu for some reason). The vanilla client is extremely inconvenient and can fuck you over in a lot of ways. It absolutely needs to list the ground items, that is the number one reason everybody uses 3rd parties. 
---
Thanks dude :) 
---
It currently has exactly 250 contributors on the the github page, which is amazing.
---
What if the boosts are tradeble? Or maybe loose a few charges when trading, as an incentive to do it yourself?
---
Tbh, I feel that dropping more and more resources is a worse option and even more rs3ish (as you call it :D)
---
[hmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4cs20f/two_3rd_age_longswords_in_the_same_clue/?st=JR68Z0BY&amp;sh=2963a888)

I’m most worried about the fire phase unless you could bring in claws or something to skip the fire phase.

So use the gold you get from PvM to buy logs from the GE.

---
And if you're an ironman complaining about having to chop trees you can change your account to a normal one at any time. 
---
Right but you forgot to apply the .000004 discount factor to shift the mass of distribution of server delays which actually effect the outcome of the drop making it a perfect 1/25 million....
---
god damn i never seen that shit in years god im old lol
---
Why the hate? 
---
Just change drops from gathering skills like herbs to things you use for buyable skills like mahog planks and things like that.
---
I go my friend into oars and we played together until he got invested. 
---
We would do the same things together whether it be Skilling or pvm.

For afk tasks we would press play on a movie at the same time and watch it with each other on discord

---
What's peoples opinion on the repetitiveness of many sayings within streamers/YouTubers? I personally find it repetitive when watching YouTubers especially talking almost the same way when they react to a certain thing that happens within the game.
---
True yeah. But top tier pvmers vs top tier pkers the pkers will always make more. 
---
Yeah. This is the only reason I didnt use my OG account from 2006/07. I made a fresh email only used it for RSS. It's one of the few ways to be 100% secure
---
You would be right, but that's not how I understand unique drops working. Vorkath drops bones+hide 100%, then gets 2 rolls on his drop table. The visages/other uniques are independent of his drop table. As you can see, he got 2 diamond rolls from the drop table. It's likely that after each kill, each unique is rolled independently at its drop rate. That would make it 1 in 25 million. I'm a noob though so could be wrong, but that's how I understood it.
---
Rare find my man, congratulations
---
Lol pretty comparable to osrs, rs3 player ratio 
---
Are you really almost maxed? Wow, man, that's amazing. How is it like in real life? Huge fan.

Lmfao I hope he’s upvoted, this kind of thinking is wild

Eh seems too common they need to nerf the drop rate XD.

Lets be real for a minute. You're a retard. Blowpipe/tbow should undoubtedly be labeled as tier 90, and was only justified into the game because of its lowered combat stats.

I miss Korasi simply because it looked badass, the spec as well.

Definitely start fruit trees since they're extremely cheap early on. Always use ultra for herbs that cost more than the price of an ultra since it guarantees 1 additional herb. Calcusource is a website that gives profit per seed which might help you decide on what to plant.
---
I have considered this but losing my account is something I’m hoping won’t happen. I have thousands of hours on it over several years, it’s really hard to think that I have to let it go. I can’t think of another game where one breach on your account means indefinite vulnerabilities.

If you're 75 cb id recommend konar Slayer. Maybe even wilderness. Up to you really. Once you get higher range and 75 mage for trident can also do barrows. 
---
I think you're wrong here. The visages are independent drops so they roll 1/5000 each. Order has nothing to do with it because they each have their own 1/5000 chance for every kill. You can't roll for the draconic and get a skeletal..
---
People watch other people play runescape 3? Wow
---
I can’t tell what it before it gone?
---
Konar/nieve/duradel?
---
There are dozens of you!
---
Instances
---
No i mean what monsters should i use it on
---
And the only thing that you are is wrong. Draconic visage is *always* rolled before skeletal so you can't get skeletal and then draconic.

Only requirement for konar tasks is 75 combat level, she's in the new kebos lowlands area on mount karuulm near the farming guild. She gives the most slayer points per task of any slayer master as well as having a special drop table when killing things on task for her that could get you up to a couple hundred k extra in a task. Only difference is she assigns a specific area you have to slay in instead of being able to do it anywhere
---
Barrows is definitely doable at your stats if you bring a couple prayer potions. Just bring iban's staff to kill the 4 melee brothers and a rune crossbow for the other 2 and you should be fine
---
someone dis it brooo😍 u/ru642
---
Meh I hate entering my pin so much just hack me instead
---
Is it definitely a standard air staff? Not battlestaff or some other variant?
---
I did rock crabs for a bit. 
---
If you can afford prayer pots I think I got around 120kxp/he at dagganoths under the lighthouse
---
We need to make this a think, like “nice” after someone tells you their levels, if you see someone begging you have to say “shame”
---
300k or a space is worth losing an extremely rare item?
---
ooo so edgy, I bet you get bullied at school for being this fucking cool too
---
Dude change your tone man. Why you being so snarky to everyone here? Nobody’s done fuck all to you.
---
Yes, that was my point, are u a mouth breather?
---
Not WoW, RS3.
---
Or Jagex could just drop this hamfisted concept, the bone whip looks awful (as does the dragon hunter lance, but that's another story) and it's just unneeded powercreep for an already very good gp/hr boss.

dont unlock any tasks like mith/red drags/aviansies/bosses
---
cannon every task

burst dust devils and extend them

use bracelet of slaughter on kalphites/suqahs/dust devils/dagonnaths
---
If you don't want the pet or capes just block the task.
---
If someone saying "let's go boys" puts someone off a video game then they probably shouldn't play the video game. Not a whole lot of females genuinely care, and the ones who do blow it out if proportion because they NEED people to know they're a girl.
---
So you condem him without knowing anything about the situation.
---
The girl is his close friend

He told her to kill herself when he was muted. She dosent use the internet so she wont see the twitch clip

Its joke

Move around or try hop world's

Also is the clue in your inventory
---
That was it, I actually had a player wander past in game and tell me exactly the same.
---
Thank you heaps! I had no idea there were even different qualities of air staff, turned out I had an air battlestaff.
---
Listen mr
---
Stfu or ill make u
---
Why you using augury with bp?
---
if that cunt is Australian he is the epitome of a disgrace. Fucking burns me up that people like him put Aus in their screen-names and act like fuckwits online.

Make it like 100k firelighters so they would actually be worth something

God thanks for Runelite

Duradel is best. But you're contradicting yourself. You want to powerlevel but also make profit? So are you willing to cannon and barrage/burst or not?

He’s an ultimate iron, the only use for the heart really is zulrah and it’s honestly not that big of a difference maker in my opinion
---
Hey everyone - so I just went members a few days ago and am loving the new feel for the game, but I also feel so lost... just a couple questions:
---
- Armor: I have full rune right now and am 60ish base meelee stats. How do I even go about figuring out what armor I should be wearing next?
---
- Magic: I'm about 65 magic and will be grinding some slayer tasks with magic; what are my next best magic clothing options? Right now I'm just wearing my standard f2p robes/hat so I'm curious what I should upgrade to.
---
Don't even have to go that far, MAC spoofers exist
---
Sounds like something a scammer would say 
---
Shoulda just won tbh
---
I'm sorry pal, gotta downvote you for asking an honest question.
---
You've got a 15mbkank. Go back and try your luck
---
That's not possible. They need physical access to your phone unless your phone somehow got infected
---
I’m not sure you understand power creep. It doesn’t pertain to only end-game content. 
---
This is what frustrates me the most with runescape. Hacked? Ur fucked bro just start over. Like what the hell man people spent THOUSAND AND THOUSANDS of hours on their accounts, starting over is going to take years to get back where u were. If that would happen to me i'd quit...
---
The bone whip shouldn't be a thing in the first place
---
100% worth. In the real game 1 cmb makes no difference
---
Got it at 67 but now at 75 people don't respect it as much anymore :(
---
That's the life of playing a main I guess..
---
Change it for time working a job at a high ass hourly pay, then get to play 07scape forever without worrying about income.
---
200 IQ
---
It should.
---
It rains, it pours
---
Are you by some chance using an address ending in ru? I heard somewhere that Jagex intentionally blocks that email domain.
---
How do you have 3 drops and no blue dragonhide?

Don't know why everyone complains about RC. It's like 300k xp/h here.

Would you light your bedroom on fire just because there's a fire in your kitchen? That's how you sound right now.

And 1b isnt even that much gold in the grand scheme of things.
---
It's 2019 and I still don't understand how people can watch streams
---
When was the last time they polled it?
---
Not gonna lie, this has tricked me aswell lmao
---
Yeah, it had been done, just that 2 accounts got the membership and the 3rd did not, somehow got used on the main account when I withdrew bonds in rs3.
---
Really wouldn't have happened if transaction was what I thought it would be, really silly that it changes like that, without refreshing browser or making significant changes (literally just bought one bond, completed transaction then made another straight after on the same page).
---
I'm going to go as far as to say this is the case with any game.
---
You can reshoot a video. You can tweak the script. You can make sure it's entertaining every time. And it's condensed to 10 minutes at a time. 
---
You simply can't do thAt for a stream. Either you get it right the first time, or you don't get it right at all. You're also streaming for hours at a time. 
---
Don’t feel like playing don’t play? Take a break like everyone else dose 
---
I did 50 bronze dragons in brimhaven then 140 warms and got nothing. People are exaggerating 
---
I had the same experience with addy/rune darts and then tried dragon since it has 2 more max hits. Was insanely fast but cut a stupid amount off the profits. Max melee is somewhere inbetween rune and dragon darts in terms of kill speed from what I can tell having used it as well as bp with all of the different tiers of darts. Supply cost is reduced by a tonne with melee because of darts and scales ofc though
---
And if you ever want to go back to your previous account, you have to pay for membership twice. 
---
Holy smokes, straw man!
---
I read that as they banned a suicidal player and was like "oh yeah that'll stop them from doing it". Reread it and now this makes way more sense
---
Listen pecker smoker, I give 0 fucks what you “doubt” I’ve been banned from the sub for over a year for sharing an rsc related YouTube video. Blow me. 
---
if mod ghost animated this itd prolly do a 720 spin while jerking off making a circular jizz stream on the ground
---
Farming guild contracts and birdhouse runs are my guesses.
---
I'm anarchocapitalist, I am all for private enorced rules. But ya know, rules and punishments have to be designed before hand, well defined, otherwise it's arbitrary and reactive, which is unbounded by any method/reasons/slow judgements, and thats scary as fuck.
---
How do I know? Cuz I know myself when I get mad or annoyed. So I would rather not indulge myself to make choices on reactions.
---
Do you have the pet?
---
By the looks of the thumb, it seems like the baby is the one holding the phone \*thinking emoji\*
---
It doesn't...
---
Meanwhile I’m sitting on 15k hill giants without a champ scroll. 
---
Eh I would disagree. Most pkers are not like that. And if you think so, it's because you don't actually PK and don't know what you're talking about.
---
"Instead of doing my own route I'll do what every other person does; read a guide and follow it religiously. Thanks for not watching."
---
Lol I do have a strange thumb. IIRC think they call it hammer thumb... 
---
yes
---
Shout out, I joined last week. I don't talk much because I have problems with new people, but they don't really make you feel out of place. Have only done a few raids, but they made me realize I don't know nearly enough about olm, mainly running the head, but not by belittling me, just by being great at it lol.
---
These guys and gals know what's up, and you're not required to do or have anything crazy. 
---
&gt; And 1b isnt even that much gold in the grand scheme of things.
---
Yeah, that is a problem. 2006/2007 30mil was where the highest level items were.
---
And yes if my house was a shithole I would light my bedroom on fire to hurry things along to getting insurance money and fixing it up.
---
I'd love to watch zeah only UIM
---
🤣🤣

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BRINGING RELIGION INTO THISSSS:((((((((((((((((((
---
How much exp do you get for fucking an Asian girl?
---
No its a faked screenshot he's pretending is his wifes phone 
---
&gt;don't feel like rushing back for your gear that's ON THE FLOOR because it's *inconvenient*
---
Please, Jagex, raise the membership price another dollar and buy proper fucking DDoS protection. These death mechanics are not OSRS.
---
Did your HCIM get pk'd by any chance? 
---
Lmao.
---
to be fair. it is better, as in it makes me feel better that she didnt hear it at that moment. it should mean nothing when it comes to disciplinary action
---
Thanks! I’ve got that!
---
that is not "his" account. He is just borrowing it from jagex to play runescape. They could not like his hair cut and ban him if they wanted too. 
---
no because nobody was willing to risk a korasi and everyone was praying mage regardless.
---
Is dark humor a nerd stereotype? Someone enlighten me, I'm out of the loop here
---
Do contracts really give out that many pineapple seeds? If you look at the chart, the nosedive is really rather crazy
---
As far as im aware there is a chance when you cut any tree, including those on fossil island
---
No, because you don't get two rolls at each visage per kill.
---
Hides + bones is guaranteed
---
2 rolls on the regular drop table
---
1 roll on the draconic visage table
---
1 roll on the skeletal visage table
---
That's how I understand it.
---
Do hydra
---
Youre 10/10 correct, i lurked misc alot in 2013-2014
---
If this happened, Lynx Titan would have got 200m all in 3 weeks, never mind 3 years.
---
&gt; trashtalking
---
Saying that he was just "trashtalking" just shows how little you know about how such a person may feel when someone tells you "I think you should just kill yourself" and laughing with your friends about it. This is in no way acceptable and I'm happy Jagex made the decision to not have this person, or behaviour, associated with their game. 
---
Maybe for you it's "Lol its just online just ignore, don't take it that seriously" but for other people it's a whole different story. Maybe try to understand that.
---
Oooookay duuuude
---
"Just need 2 mil for fury pls help"
---
Thanks for the comments, I thought I seen that runelite were ordered to shut down a small while ago or was that another client? 
---
But what of Mod Rot?????
---
This is why Rot hasnt been banned yet people oretend a problen doesbt exist or are extrenely goldfish-like
---
I can’t even figure out how to use any plugins after downloading it last week, something about writing them in yourself I remember people saying
---
When I get real bored I'll equip brawl gloves and punch beggars. It's surprisingly effective, they shut up for a while
---
That’s not really true pretty exaggerated, it does happen a good bit though. To say that is the majority is extremely misleading
---
well done, when can we expect the infernal cape???
---
I get ya. Only reason I did forsure jump zulrah first is because I've already gotten the pet. I guess I could hunt serp colors. 
---
I tried demonic however I've killed 600 and yet to get 1 shard, getting annoyed.
---
When companies do with their clients what they want, they may step into violating contracts themselves signed with their clients.
---
Rights emanate from private voluntarly valid contracts for an ancap.
---
So yea, them breaking them or either them operating on super silly contracts with vague points annoy me. I guess this is an iq thing
---
as someone who isn’t massively in the know when it comes to software an IP ban sounds exactly like that. I wasn’t aware it’s bypass able.
---
Wow, those are the only ways? Thanks for your time man! I wish I took a peek to see how I did!
---
Yeah but trevenant could be used for woodcutting....
---
Don't believe this guy if he doesn't have any evidence
---
Hydra is on task only, and I'm 93 slayer. Close to 94 but still.
---
Yeah it is super soft!
---
Thank you!!
---
As a more casual gamer, I don’t think so, but maybe a couple years down the road! I’m gonna say no for now but you never know!
---
Then leave. No one wants people that only reason as if everything feels the same for everyone, and if isn't a lot to you then it isn't a lot to anyone. Your comment just shows that you have absolutely no clue what the impact of his actions were. I would ask to consider how she felt, but I doubt you can.
---
I could hear it before I even opened it
---
Why are you bitching so much?
---
I felt dead inside after getting 99 thieving in less than a week before ardy knights nerf
---
Can confirm, dls are da shit
---
There are still servers but not that many people play. A lot of people play ignite and insanity flyff.
---
Anyone else notice that the two sandwiches look different? Look at the green piece in the right corner of both sandwiches for example
---
As long as it still works you can plant a spirit tree and use that to get in afterwards without boosting lmao
---
Jf youre unsure id reccomend ti longrange with blowpipe so you dknt accidentially run into jad and he smack you a 91
---
This is the one 
---
Unique to OSRS is Rooftop Agility courses. While running them Marks of Grace will randomly spawn for you to pick up. They themselves are untradeable, but they can be exchanged to an NPC named Grace down in the Rogue's Den beneath Burthorpe. I STRONGLY recommend you use them to get the full Graceful set first, but otherwise you can exchange them for Amylase Packs - which contain the secondary ingredient for Stamina potions and are consistently in demand due to how useful Stam pots are.
---
Not worth at any level. Not by a long shot.
---
Lol the comments defending him and how she didn't hear it and it was a joke...telling people to kill themselves is never funny as is not taking people seriously who have mental health problems.  Glad he's gone hopefully twitch takes action as well because let's be honest twitch and runescape are filled with people suffering from poor mental health and don't need to hear people joke about suicide. 
---
We literally have an outrage calendar.
---
Am I toxic for pointing out how pathetic they are to be begging in a video game? How useless can you be?
---
You sir are a prick 
---
It's random. That's when you get to veng him. Sometimes he can range you a few times in a row and if the snakelings happen to hit you at the same time it's easy to get dropped.
---
You can eat right away when you see the range attack, though. His max hit is 41 so it's advisable to be at least like 60 hp on the mage phases. It can be frustrating even if you're doing everything right (unless you're playing it super safe and bank unless you have a ton of food.)
---
"Edit item for sale". Oh, so a knock-off team of weekend warriors can implement that feature, but the actual multi-million dollar game studio bills it as more difficult than putting a man on the moon.
---
If u get fucked u can often hide behind the pillars and eat up
---
Outrage culture wins again, he probably gets pizzas and swatted daily 
---
who?
---
do you always switch back to range after an attack? i heard mage hits later
---
Around 90 based on a video I saw (been a while, sorry, can’t link it, but you can find one talking about it)
---
I absolutely have only heard of him through other streamers and Reddit comments.
---
Swampletics is just such a well put together series so far that it everyone's been talking about it. Word of mouth is fucking powerful.
---
RUNECRAFTING BAD!!!
---
If tent has more than 8/9k charges on death, drop whip. If under, drop tent. Keeps people from abusing mechanics and most tent whips in pvp are likely semi-newish.
---
Crystal halberd is worse dps than lance auto attacks
---
I thought the general consensus was that the M+S rework went pretty well, especially given the scope.
---
It's his birthday today, everyone on this sub likes to wish him Happy Birthday.

Easiest way is just switch your auto cast to blood barrage until it’s dead. Costs a bit of extra gp, but it’s super easy.
---
that’s how every hacker ever hacks somebody you miserable dingus. If he protects his account and changes his IP then they A won’t be able to disconnect him, and B won’t have a reason to as they won’t have or be able to have access to the account. 
---
Rofl ya I will admit much as we all make fun of btw’s. It does give the game a new flair for old players. My hcim was most fun I had in long time. 
---
Full void w/blowpipe.

You can log off at end of a round to save progress

Interesting! At least i can get back some of the losses. Ill be sure to keep that in mind

Thanks :)

How do you expect to get any feedback without twitter or reddit? The offical forums are hardly used (although if they were update that might be okay) 
---
Also how can you call Twitter dumb while using this sub? This sub is 100x worse that twitter

big wall of text to say "i didn't have 2 factor on my email and fell for a phishing email because i'm an inbred"

I’ve put off doing this for a month because I need to train hunter, con and herblore because I’m so close to slayer cape. I refuse to get any xp other than rc from this absolute beauty of a minigame.

woooosh or not, this guy helped me secure my account

I realized that as people were getting other bizarre unnoted drops wtf

This is true af. Makes me feel better I can afk RS and do other things though.

Thank you so much!

boss and quest exceptions ofcourse.
---
Ah, you're right. Difficult to see on mobile. My bad.
---
Good. I don't care how hard you think you are. Shouldn't say shit like that. Especially to someone who is suffering. Good job Jagex on banning that idiot. 
---
damn, i don't have a lumbridge swamp uim, hardcore uim doesn't even exist. i just thought it was some sort of inside joke
---
Just BoX yourself with a second account. So keep kicking eachother and walking a few tiles then reattack each other.
---
No one will PK you in the arena, its between Mage Bank and The Arena thats the issue. if you BoX there's no way you die
---
How many did you get lmao
---
Green dhide Ava's attractor amulet of accuracy and tbow
---
That concept sounds amazing
---
Maybe in runescape it’s like we live in Cuba or North Korea where its still like 1955 hah 
---
Agreed. Iirc a jmod mentioned somewhere that 30% of the playerbase are ironmen, who will want things made easier for them. The integrity of the game will soon shift to what's integral to ironmen, not the diminishing percentage of normal main account players. Runecraft has already been beheaded, now it's just bleeding out
---
بيت أنت فينك من زمان؟
---
same
---
Not the point. The point is if you know they’re  a HCIM i would be like “alright homie don’t be a fucktard again.”
---
Looks like he needed the scythe. 
---
What's your ign? If you've got any questions I can help ya out - add Ferriday
---
128. Its In the title
---
Can I get some list of the people doing loc locked IM or UIM, I am really enjoying Verf and Settled videos so far, would be cool to know any more interesting series to hook into.
---
Except pvm is already the best money in the game. 
---
oeeh, i'll try that, thanks!
---
:-)
---
No my question was how many you actually got out of the 128
---
Lmao 😂 
---
I don’t know what that means. Do you have a degree? Does that job pay well enough that you’ll be set for life?
---
Theoriginaljim on twitch is pvp world only ironman. He’s currently working on fire cape prep
---
Lots of people forget that nobody owns their account and Jagex is free to do what they want. And like you said if they don't want somebody playing their game they can just remove him and problem solved. 
---
YES PLEASE
---
I was lucky to get the pet at 76kc but my chaos ely kc is way over 300 rip and 0 d pic and only 1 d2h
---
Exactly same here tho i had a DFS so those rangers never hit anything.
---
Lmao sorry but that’s hilarious 
---
Why would you pay this much money for a torso when you can buy a BCP for 20m? 
---
Or you can spend like 2.5 hrs and do it yourself
---
&gt;Making money
---
&gt;Skilling
---
Pick one. 
---
Make sure to imbue it and use amethyst arrows. Better DPS than rcb/dcb at certain tasks
---
Good question.
---
OSRS
---
Or even better: the crier bell
---
OSB mousekeys are 100% bannable 
---
Wow bro you hit a 1/3096 drop and it was worth some gp. Crazy
---
ya i know :D fuck me.
---
THIS WAS FUNNY AS FUCK GOOD JOB lmaaaaooooooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
It is going to go the way of the Dragon Axe.
---
Hell yeah. Good luck man
---
Mentioning ironman at all in any comment gives you like a 40% chance of being downvoted immediately. It's the rs equivalent of saying the word vegan.

Its literally just an itemsink for a pvp death which means pkers will never be able to pk the hilt, so the only one who benefits from that is a pvmer who farms raids2.
---
I just dont get how they know the drop rates beforehand and know that its a BIS upgrade so obviously it will have a very high pricetag and still decide to only reward pkers with 1m for killing someone who loses a 100m item.

Dragon pick is 5.5m. If i 3 tick iron im literally losing like 20 mill on the way to 99 mining.. It makes the free skills not free.

Twitter as a whole, is used by people to spew their stupid opinions and attempt to talk to celebrities. I really don’t have a care in the world for it. Reddit May have bad subs, but twitter as a whole needs to be shut down. 
---
And because there is a ridiculous amount of sheep mentality on reddit. Everyone is more concerned with getting high karma than posting genuine discussions. If you’ve noticed all the stupid memes/ look at this unit/ I got my first blah blah blah. Posts like this (while the first ... I honestly don’t mind congrats on whatever accomplishment you’ve gotten) are upvoted not for creativity, rather it’s just how it goes. (Not me) i see a post with 3k upvotes I upvote, I see a post with 3k downvotes I downvote. I didn’t bother to read the post I just go with the group because I’m afraid of being an individual. 
---
Reddit should not be able to influence a poll so greatly that it is removed without even getting a chance to exist. If Reddit makes up let’s say 20% of the playerbase and 80% of Reddit didn’t want the whip. That’s like 15% of the playerbase removing a poll without the other 85% of people even getting a chance to voice their opinion. 
---
The both of us have prettt much just stuck to our guns here, you think it’s a good idea it was removed and delayed so that potentially something better could come from it. I actually Agree and yeah maybe something better will happen because of this, but at the same time for me Reddit shouldn’t have enough power to have a poll removed. If the bone whip would have passed the poll all it does is devalue a regular whip. They could have put that in, and in 3 months or whatever poll whatever this new idea is and hey maybe we get a bone flail as well from some other monster. New content isn’t a bad thing.

Item lvl requirements really don't mean much in terms of how much power items have in OSRS, so that's a weird argument to make. 
---
OPs post is speaking in terms of actual tangible power, not level requirements since those don't mean anything. Dclaw spec is better than an AGS spec for example, yet dclaws only require 60 att.

Msb is your best bet for almost every slayer monster

This is amazing!

How do you play in a small window on resizable? Doesn’t it bother yo that your character stands in the corner of the screen? 
---
Best method for getting mediums is Falador guards with Falador shield.
---
Best method for getting hard^^^^^s is Hellhounds by Mage Bank with Ring of Wealth (i)

you see if you could afford a dhcb the range attacks would of not been a problem fam ;o

Step 1: get 300m

Step 2: buy expensive item and set placeholder    
---
Step 3: sell and buy expensive item and set placeholder

pretty easy spot to get back to if you have a slayer ring
---
imagine being to poor to afford a dhcb in 2019 its only 134m atm smh
---
Aside from anglerfish (which can heal above max hp), most other standard food has just a healing effect with different values healed. It's mostly about what you can afford, how dangerous the content is, deciding how long you want the trip to be, and (for lower levels) your actual HP level.  
---
(Just in case you don't know what the healing values are for individual food, https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Food seems like a good outline of what each type heals for)
---
For most standard purposes, Monkfish is probably gonna be fine, and beyond a certain point the costs of food starts eating in to your potential earnings for the trip.
---
Trying to find a balance so you aren't ending trips too early, aren't wasting food, and aren't spending too much on supplies is the goal, and it's something you'll get a feel for as time goes on.
---
For one-time quest bosses/dangerous instances, I usually opt for a more expensive option that I'm still comfortable spending on, since the cost per trip is irrelevant and it doesn't matter so much if you come over-prepared a little.
---
i tried alot of revs but i am not even able to ejter without getting pked 
---
Poll blog shows the new one.
---
Monks and Karambwans are great for long trips against easy(ish) monsters. The higher end foods are when you're going to need that healing in bigger bursts. Fire Giants aren't going to hit you for back to back 35's, so you don't need the big heals. Bosses hit harder and more often, so you want more healing every time you stop attacking to eat. 
---
Karambwans are also good for combo eating meaning that you can eat them at the same time as other food. I've seen streamers take a inventory of sharks and a few karambwans to hard bosses like cerb for when they need an extra big heal.
---
I take Monks for easy slayer tasks, Karambwans for harder tasks, and Sharks for everything I'm scared of. For the finals bosses of MM2 and DS2 I needed sara brews. All it really boils down to is figuring out how long you're going to be away from a bank and how big you need the burst healing to be. If you're banking after every Barrows chest then you're probably fine with Karambwans.
---
you can't see lot if you weren't already in the world when it was dropped, get owned noob!

I have another of question, in regards to skills.
---
Why do your skills have two numbers? Like Wood Cutting 15/15? It doesn't seem like it ever goes down to like 10/15. Or maybe I haven't seen it yet? Or are there skills where the numbers might differ?
---
Thanks!

Heheh fuck it dood

this over really needs a screen for some pk lasagna

People use them but the only time they’re dropped is when a team is on them, typically no one would ever drop it for any other reason, in 1v1s they’ll rarely die to being outlasted, if it isn’t a spec ko people leave with some supplies before they die
---
A rs3 streamer told a suicidal person to kill themselves, obviously people called him a piece of shit for it and he apparently got perm banned on his maxed main and maxed ironman as well as twitch
---
Deserved tbh
---
Fact tho - they did update it back in the day. There were 2 unique "Newspapers" available in the GE in 2008-ish.
---
Unpopular opinion: People shouldn't be banned from a game even if what they said was wrong and horrible, the game is unrelated

For reference on this thread. [http://services.runescape.com/m=news/mouse-keys---changes--clarification?oldschool=1](http://services.runescape.com/m=news/mouse-keys---changes--clarification?oldschool=1)
---
That series is my favorite on YouTube. 
---
ah fuck 
---
So thye finally did the un-noted brew drop suggestion nice
---
I think I saw this comment on another subreddit, but someone said something like “saying Kill yourself as banter? Sure. Saying ‘Shoot me.’? Sure. But calling someone up who you know is struggling and telling them to kill themselves is too far” which I definitely agree with.
---
The only thing that doesn’t sit right with me is that his Runescape account got banned for something he did outside of Runescape and had no real relation to it. That’s a trend I don’t really know if I’m comfortable with tbh. Guy is definitely a scumbag nonetheless.
---
Hahaha thanks. 
---
Damn...
---
Is there something I am missing with bows/arrows vs bolts/cross bows?
---
As far as I can tell bows and arrows are completely obsolete.
---
Crossbows are way cheaper, faster attack speed, more damage per hit (bone bolts are equivalent to rune arrows WTF?), and are 1 handed to boot. Outside of T-Bow, is there ANY reason to use a bow? It seems like you should just use bone bolts until rune crossbow and then eventually DHCB or TBOW and maybe some niche shit here and there.
---
Magic Short bow? Worthless, complete. Crafting arrows? Why?
---
Thank you!
---
if you can afford a dhcb doing vork with those stats is manageable. Idk if I personally would want to try and farm it without one with those stats though, but idk for sure. Your best bet is to just give them a shot. Zulrah has alot more of a learning curve than vork does though.
---
This is part of what made me quit RS ~10 years ago. 
---
At one point everyone was pking with only untradeable items.. Neitz helm, fighter torso, rune defender, 99 cape, barrows gloves and protect whip.
---
You PK someone and literally all you would get were rune legs and a glory amulet. 
---
The best PKing times were when the obsidian content came out... everyone pking in berserker helms, full rune, whip, obsidian shield/cape. Didn’t matter if you didn’t get that “barrows” kill, at least you knew you’d be getting something for your effort on any average PK. 
---
No one really ever does it which makes that point useless, people only drop them before dying to a team
---
They don't plan to add new uniques to the table I think its down for interpristion I guess. The Osrs Wiki Says:  
---
21 January 2019: ([update](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Revised_Post_Kebos_Poll_Blog)) **HOTFIX** Konar's drop table was re-tweaked, removing adamant and runite bolts and reintroducing dragon dart tips and magic logs.   
---
Doesn't State anything about Mystic/Hasta Removal 
---
Only 30? That's nothing. I'd take 30 any day of the week.
---
Galvek was much easier for me because you could actually practice. 
---
With Jad you know if you die it’s gonna be an hour before you get to try again and a bunch of wasted supplies, so the additional pressure leads to more screw ups. 
---
half of the world is using dynamic ips so you only have to restart your router to get a new ip.
---
afaik its actually cheaper for the isp to hand out ips dynamically because they needs less ips than customers, so static ips just exist because its would be expensive to change already existing networks.
---
Runelite is the superior siege engine
---
They were but they refused and jagex backed down
---
I didn't say hey boys..
---
 I said "let's go boys" has become the same as "what are you **guys** doing" or in your example "hey **guys**" in a sense that they're both a gender neutral phrase that has a gendered word in it.
---
You think people would just go on the internet...and lie?
---
quests is certainly what you should do  
---
set recipe for disaster as an ultimate goal for barrows gloves

Osb free actually added a bunch of features recently, I'm assuming to compete with the wave of popularity runelite got with their GPU rendering 
---
Wait is the buff live already or what 
---
Idk guys, banning players for something beyond the game seems a bit much, regardless of how shitty it was. This worked out in this instance, but it could potentially set a shitty precedent for people speaking out against jagex. I feel like people would have just stopped watching this streamer
---
Wait so has the new drop table been implemented?
---
Yes because he has autism 
---
Metal dragons are pretty enjoyable with lance.

why the fook are there 20k users on OSB?

If you boost or your stats get drained they get temporarily adjusted

Oh look, it’s me, the melee noob duoing the mole! The piece was a gift for a buddy of mine, I wanted something that called back to our childhood of goofing around (hence the ridiculous boss choice) while also looking intense enough to not be completely ridiculous.

I always think its funny when people in game forums say "This would be quick and easy to implement". Based on what exactly? Do you know how things interact in their codebase? Do you know the edge cases that this might break? Like you might be right but saying it as a definitive statement is so weird to me when you dont know anything about how the software is actually organized.

---
i'm not? sad to see that no one cares, but when the "iconic" whip was being replaced by bone whip ppl were crying 
---
No one would pk with it if it dropped 100m when you died. What's the point? Repairing it is a huge gp sink already, and most people dont use it already because 1m/death is pretty significant when it's a single offhand item dropping it. 
---
Oh, shit, that's true some items are crazy expensive - I guess I'm not used to raids because personally I haven't ever done that content. Good point. Sorry this happened to you.
---
Hey if you need a few friends you're welcome to join my clan, we're a social and pvm based clan and are currently looking to recruit new members. Our clan is called theoslounge, hope to see you

By the way, go to Ground Items, last check box is collapse drops :)
---
Even if you do get the account back it will be an rs3 account not osrs. Osrs is a recreation of the game so accounts started fresh.
---
double woosh it's a meme reaction to the ironman devalue meme god it hurts to explain it lol
---
Good guy Jagex removing pricks like that from the game. Big respect to you guys.
---
Imbued rings are also commonly dropped and picked up again in deep wild.
---
Maybe with tent whips you could check the charges left when the player dies, if it's more than 500 (or w/e number seems balanced) then drop a used tentacle which is exactly the same as a tentacle whip but only has 500 charges. 
---
Get your slayer levels up. You'll be gaining profit left and right. Unfinished potions are also pretty decent for profit, as well as fletching. (Not fletching darts). You could also buy sapphire rings and enchant them with level 7 enchant to make Rings of Recoil. Should net about 150-200K an hour. Not the greatest, but still profit.

3rd age never has and never will be a best in slot item and the only reason people buy it is fashionscape or to try and brag they have money (which is now pointless with items worth several times the amount of 3a) so its bound to drop. If you bought it, thats your own fault lol
---
It looks great.
---
You should look at clans mate, many will teach raids there are plenty of split or ffa to meet your needs too.
---
Every time I smoke before I play RuneScape I always get so high sometimes I forget an item in the bank. I’ll go bank 5 times get 5 different items

There's a hilarious video of people NH tribridding in max gear on a PvP world in these at Port Phasmantys. It hides switches and makes for some funny clips.

I'm glad to see so many people here are taking this seriously as it should be and treating this as a serious matter.
---
I've done that! lmao
---
Bring back stealing creation!
---
shes even looking down
---
Your argument is that a consistent source of magic logs from a farmable boss is less impactful to the game than a non-guaranteed drop, after rolling a rare drop table loot, while doing slayer with a slayer master who offers lower rates than other slayer masters is not only laughable it's just straight up idiotic.
---
Like, I don't know. If you cant recognise the difference in that it's gonna take more than just me to explain it to you.  
---
But hey I guess the new cool thing is hating on Jagex so let's just mindlessly agree and instead, populate the Konar drop table with... what? Might I ask?
---
Oh crap I completely forgot. It's his birthday today isn't it?
---
Zulrah is better pre dhcb pretty much always
---
Normally I'd agree but this guy is not a decent human being so I don't agree. There's always going to be biases in enforcing rules but I think 99 out of 100 people regardless of who you are would agree Jagex did the right thing.
---
Saying no it doesn't doesn't make it true.  It drops from fossil island monsters, off the top of my head ammonites and ancient zygomites
---
That and fist of Guthix were my favorite

That’s understandable. There’s actually a really great efficient Ironman guide that helped get me started, and doing quests is also a good way to get going. Something else you can do is watch the first couple episodes of Ironman series on YouTube and see what they did to start out. Also, there’s an Ironman clan chat, “Ironman CC” that’s full of knowledgeable players happy to help newbies.

People tell others to kill themselves so often on this game I don't understand why this guy is being singled out.  Don't care much since I don't know him but its kind of weird considering what he said wasn't even said on runescape.
---
BH is by *far* my least favorite/least common form of pking. i am certainly not planning on maxing shit, i'm staying a pure forever. 
---
But unless Jagex is paying him, he’s not a representative of Jagex. He’s simply a consumer of their product, who happens to be streaming it and making money through streaming their game. I don’t like it because there’s nothing to my knowledge mentioning behavior that applies to outside of Runescape itself and therefor Jagex can freely apply or not apply this same precedent however they please. Granted they can do that with already listed rules, but at least if they’re listed somewhere there’s a clear guideline of what gets you banned and what doesn’t. Sure, this specific situation was definitely a good case of Jagex taking initiative and banning someone who probably did deserve it, but I’m concerned about the other possibilities this opens up and what this means for other people since it wasn’t really clear if how you act on stream influences bans or not. Plus I’m fairly sure that Jagex could have done it under the table if they wanted to simply cut ties with that person, but instead they chose to make a statement with him and I’m concerned with how this will be applied in the future with other potential streamers since this seems to be a first-time thing.

Shortbows are faster than crossbows.

Honestly I'd just make a new account for OSRS. If you use your old account you still start from scratch.

White graceful top &amp; legs. Dragon boots. Santa hat. Ava's device. Mud battlestaff.

Do you know what clout means?
---
Potions can end in 30 second intervals.
---
When you kill vorkath, it takes a few seconds for the death animation to happen before you get your loot drop, but it stoped he kill timer as soon as you kill them because it’s unfair to add 4 seconds from a death animation to a kill timer
---
Jagex increased the taxes for us to keep up the RS3 servers. 
---
"rum"
---
Dragon only requires 60 attack
---
I suggest making a main so you can do all the pvm for money without worrying about levels.
---
As for making a pk acc, it’s pretty fast if you have some money to work with
---
Just do vamp slay, waterfall and dwarf cannon on a new acc.
---
Then cannon to get like 65 range, and get 62 str and 40 attack.
---
Don’t get any prayer levels yet.
---
Then you can practice poking in f2p where you risk chump change.
---
Once you are good at that, you can get 50 attack and become a gmaul pure which are super op.
---
Go to the mini game tab, select blast furnace and you will be able to teleport to Keldagrim
---
To be fair, pictures was probably taken on the programmers “test” version that is different from the main game.
---
Jesus what a username 
---
Abuse regen?
---
So how does that work? Since you can only click ‘take’, remove from most top stack. Wouldn’t that affect global looting mechanics?? As in player 1 click first, all other clicks from player Xs will be ignored. Hence, with perfect clicking, player 1 always get the loot?
---
Huh... It's almost like the GE incentivizes 1:1 efficiency because converting items into gold is instant and care free. Hmmm. Hhhhhmmmmmm
---
HHHHMMMMMMMM
---
(Just here to shit on the GE and get down-voted)
---
This is such a small issue in the grand scheme of things that are wrong with pvp, how this got gold is beyond me.
---
Piety is a huge power spike. Get 70 prayer and do the quest (King's Ransom?)
---
How could they not know the code is that easy!  You must be a genius, man
---
How do you guys not catch this in QA...jesus christ
---
Not pointless. You could see how much time there is in between events.
---
For example Vorkath mentions time per trip. But a min:sec timestamp would make it easy to include banking and such.
---
Why is graphist not banned then? Is it because he did what he did off stream?
---
r/ironscape is a good resource.
---
Sell to those who buy 
---
I have to imagine that the odds of that are pretty f'in low. I got a fair few log drops from 50-75.
---
It was just added recently
---
You're not playing devil's advocate because everyone including OP knows he handed them information.  The problem is how utterly defenseless you are when that information is lost.  
---
What's this shit

Meal of the champions, am I right?

But i see two panties on the floor. 2/2

I hated summoning on release, but grew to love it over the years.
---
AAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH
---
Skilling used to be the entirety of the game with a PK sideshow way back when. Depends on how you see useless too, i just like the farming, playing games to a meta outside of pvp is not fun for me, i just want shit to do during times i cant really do much more than click around. I dont care its not the most efficient way to make gold so long as i can find ways to my gold go up and i dont care whats most efficient xp i just like finding the ways that are convenient for me. Probably just a filthy casual perspective but its those simple things that have kept me coming back since the game was only a 2d webpage client. 
---
You can either build one in your house (Gives you fastest times to kill for bosses,  kill count item drops etc) as well as I believe you can talk to a guy in Varrock museum and he will give you a adventure log (book in your inv) and you can see all the same stuff there
---
Go to Best buy and look at the current state of fridges they all have tablets built in to them now it's only a matter of months before this will become a very true possibility

it'll be long and difficult, but you can boost using stews to slowly obtain 2 runite ores and then boost again to make the rune scimitar. the task will not reset stages as long as you do not complete another task after you start

Awesome. Thanks for the update man! Have an amazing day!

You do realize that the point of poll blogs is to gather feedback before polling stuff? If they didn't want feedback and a chance to change stuff they would poll it right away.

That's how I get my starter gear on new accounts.

Is that the only use?

I know others obviously don't share the same opinion, but I honestly don't like skilling.  I only skill for diary and quest requirements and nothing else, so I'm ok with it.
---
Bots make natural resources cheap so it works out for how I play the game.
---
Hey, I'm going to risk my worthless fake internet points going against the grind here and say;
---
I'm a relatively new player who started recently. 
---
I've tried so many of the recommended gold making methods, and asked people for more. 
---
I've tried:
---
    Tanning green dragon hides (Lacked the initial capital for large runs, small return per hour and without weight reducing gear or stamina potions, the latter would decrease capital even further) , grinding goat horns (Powder selling for barely any more than the horns, and selling slowly), collecting poison challices (Very low demand), Chaos Monks (Constantly PK'd, have to make a trip back every few minutes to avoid losing too much, even after switching realms), Revenant caves (Even worse than chaos monks), Motherlode Mine (Very low gold per hour, even if exp was decent), Blast Furnace (Cost of materials plus operations without weight reducing gear and 60 smithing decreased profits, but not terrible), Spinning flax (I'm convinced this is a joke. Chickens are better gold per hour and less effort), Enchanting games necklaces/necklaces of passage (Low gold per hour, but decent exp), Slayer farming (So poorly explained on the wiki, still don't really understand how the system works. Got assigned to kill like 30 monsters that were nearly double my combat level so moved on until I was stronger).
---
So many options I tried just didn't really earn much gold at all, especially not for the hours required. I just wanted to play the game, but playing the game feels like such a waste; It's more efficient to do something boring, make gold with it, use the gold to buy materials and then use the materials to level a skill than it is to just level that skill yourself, it's just gruelling and awful.
---
And then for all forms of PvP or even a lot of PvM content:
---
I made the (Apparently horrendous) mistake of spending my time levelling melee stats relatively evenly, instead of being a pure or focusing on magic. So now I'm a walking target in the wilderness, can't safespot most enemies and get told I should farm up 60 magic for most worthwhile enemies anyway.
---
In contrast to all of this; I've been lucky at drop parties a couple of times, was given a rune armour set for free before I became a member and even got a dragon scimitar from the fallador party room.
---
To many of you, that's pocket change, but to me that's been the fastest gold making I've experienced since I've started.
---
The point I'm making isn't to complain, but to explain:
---
For a player who's low level, or inexperienced, making 500,000 gold an hour is almost impossible to fathom, while for veterans with banks worth more than one hundred million gold, 500k is a drop in the ocean. It's nothing.
---
Beggers usually see this huge gulf between where they are and where the rich players are and think about how easy it would be to donate 0.1% of your wealth to double another player's total wealth.
---
I'm not defending the practice, but there are worse things in the world than people looking for handouts and help.
---
It'd be too OP in pvp, enemies might freeze in fear!
---
It doesn't care me though, I hope they have fun with d scimmy torso rune armour and bit of cash

Sounds fishy. You can definitely afk crabs and if you don’t wanna bother picking up herb drops crabs are the way to go imo. 
---
Ahhh fair enough. Completely forgot about the boost. Thanks!
---
Rofl, zillions of people have been AFKing crabs since forever without getting banned. You must have done *something* wrong ;)

I respect coordination and skill when it comes to pvp, but if they can use this to gain an advantage in single combats, then it's a bug, not a feature. Hopefully it get's patched.

Yes. I miss 2012-2010 RS more than 2007.

The 13 trout thing is funny as content but pathetic to actually do.  You're misleading people trying to be helpful to a noob into giving you money.  It's an alternative form of scamming in my mind, and anyone that does it for anything more than a practical joke is as bad as a low life scammer.
---
so we're bidding. 20k.
---
By your argument, you should let someone drive drunk, because the only way they'll learn to not do it is to get in an accident, kill someone, hurt themselves, etc? Your logic is highly flawed. And it may be chump change to you, but it's not for some. 
---
Even if that player WAS going to give him an extra 100k, playing mind games with someone is a dick move. What he was asking is the equivalent of, "Dance, monkey, and I'll toss you a quarter." 
---
Also, how is warning someone of a way people can, and do, scam in the game, "hurting their growth," exactly? 
---
Call him out.

---
While they might not have a specific ruling on outside behavior the catch all lines companies provide on their terms and conditions usually covers this. 
---
I looked up the Terms and Conditions [here](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/terms)
---
&gt; NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP, TITLE OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN ANY JAGEX PRODUCT OR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO AN ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF JAGEX.
---
The company owns your account thus by extension you are utilizing their property. 
---
&gt; Jagex reserves the right to stop offering a Jagex Product or a particular part of a Jagex Product at any time either permanently or temporarily, at which point any license granted to you to use the Jagex Product or a part thereof will be automatically terminated or suspended. In such event, Jagex shall not be required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with such discontinued elements of the Jagex Product unless required by law.
---
This reaffirms the above statement. With your account being their property they can at anytime revoke the license. If this line of reasoning doesn't sit well with you I then would point to this last part of the Terms and Conditions.
---
&gt; 12) JAGEX STOPPING YOUR ACCOUNT
---
&gt;If, acting reasonably, we consider that:
---
&gt; 1. our terms and conditions or any Jagex Product rules - have or may have been breached;
---
2. there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity;
---
3. or
---
it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public
---
&gt;
---
We may at any time: (i) Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts for Jagex Products; (ii) restrict access to any content-uploading or other feature of our service; and/or (iii) restrict access to or delete virtual currency or anything acquired by means of virtual currency. These actions may result in loss of real money paid in prohibited transactions, such as account trading. If we take any of the above action, you may have a right of appeal.
---
&gt;WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ONGOING SUPPLY OF ANY JAGEX PRODUCT. UPON REASONABLE NOTICE TO YOU, JAGEX MAY DEACTIVATE ANY ACCOUNT AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY REFUND FOR ANY AMOUNTS PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCOUNT.
---
Under reason 3 it states "prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, to any Jagex Product, to other players OR THE GENERAL PUBLIC". I think we could reasonably assume the girl who he told to inflict self harm to would be considered a member of the general public and thus Jagex could reasonably say he broke the terms and conditions. 
---
Further, I don't find any issue with Jagex's actions here as I believe any customer of any product acts as a representative of that brand and company. Their level of representation is not at the level of an actual employee or hired brand agent, but they still represent at some level the image of the brand.

My old account got perm banned for appealing a mute for asking someone if they played on a private server. Apparently I was "website advertising" and it was before we used voice chat, so Runescape was the only way to talk to my friends.
---
I appealed and got perma banned with no explanation, I tried to contact them and so did my mum, and all they said was "just create a new account". Even still, my old account has been perm banned now for probably 6 years and they still haven't released the name, even after I contacted them on Twitter and they won't release it or just unban the account.
---
Made me have literally zero trust in any sort of Jagex moderating. I mean, even after all this time you'd think they would maybe make it so that, in order to trade/drop items you would have to enter the bank pin because what fucking point is a bank pin if your bank is on your character in gear.
---
whoever gave you the platinum had like 3 dollars in their bank account

Wish they removed items from bosses and mobs that you get from skilling. Not fair until I can get armadyl crossbow from fishing

You can eat rock cake while under absorbs btw (I *think* you couldn't before, but then they changed it). Personally I used to afk ~3min at a time, and then plunge hp back to 1 with a rock cake. Obv. absorbs last slightly shorter, but I found it more bearable to play this way, while *still* raking plenty of points

It's 95 Slayer, and requires you to be on task to even attempt to kill it. I think it's okay to earn a few astral runes for my efforts of wasting hundreds of slayer points and around 75-100 hours of my life to get a Hydra task.

Don’t close the tab and it will be highlighted in red or watch for the the blue tab. I don’t see the issue?

Try Amulet of Fury, Berserker Ring, Zulrah scales. you can flip these with good margins in like half an hour. Check margins via OSbuddy exchange, but be cautious because they can be outdated, even a few minutes can mess you up. In general, items that are traded a lot is the safest I think. Also be careful with flipping before/after bigger updates.
---
Mutated bloodvelds are currently the best melee exp for a slayer task, always good to get if you're not max combat. It's also one of the most afk task as well, find a free world, tag 4-5, put on prot melee and you're good for 1-2 mins. You also make a decent profit, something like 600k~ an hour (depending on stats).
---
I currently get 135k/hr from them while using proselyte. I believe 150k/hr is possible with max str bonux/99 str.
---
They have been playing the bots card for a long fucking time now. Bots or no bots back in 2005 maybe 2006 and earlier skilling was a comparable money maker to combat. They wrecked skilling for no good reason.
---
Soaking was absolutely terrible, there wasn't a single good thing about it pvp wise
---
You can soooometimes. I haven't been able to, apparently it's hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get like, "No matter how hard you try you can't bite the cake" or something. But only while overcharged. Once the overcharge wears off, you can take the bites needed.
---
But yeah, if you're willing to put in the NMZ Point capital initially, you can get more aborbs and AFK it for 3-ish minutes without having to flick.

Don’t worry, you’ll get slam jammed by the mage attack too.

Unquested defense and 90str already without ever bothering to get venge before tells me that your heart was never really in the "zerk" from a pvp standpoint, honestly just go main to have more fun and make money faster, once you have good income from pvm you can make a proper zerk with money to fund it correctly/quickly

I do, but it just doesn't work for me most of the time. I've only had it work like, twice. Because I'll get an HP level up and then it'll be at 2, but no guzzle working while I'm overcharged. :(

They're public leaks, haveibeenpwned basically has access to them and either decrypts or just reads through the plaintext information stored there.

They provide download links to the archives on their site for a lot of the leaks so that you can go and find your own data, because they don't allow you to get your password directly from the site.
---
Wow not a waste of time look at that
---
right, that was more a "make sure you aren't comparing to people w/ dhcb" sorta deal.

with pipe you might get 2 or 3 kills per inventory depending on if you poh between kills or not and or how hard your bgs hits. with dhcb you always get 6-7.

The video doesn't show that his mic was muted. I still believe he should get banned for what he actually did, but it's not cool that jagex isn't doing literally 100 seconds of research before banning someone and bragging about it.

How is your time limited? If you’re talking about your membership, fishing isn’t the worst but isn’t the best money maker. If grinding out 99 fishing is fun for you then continue on doing it. Maybe try fishing karambwans for less exp per your but a lot more cash since people use karambwans for pking they’re always in demand

This is just straight revisionist history. Dueling was a major party of classic — you could literally fight anywhere back when I first started. You also NEVER saw people safing this hard because 1. The overhealing meta was not very big back in actual OSRS and neither was combo eating. 2. Nobody was 1ticking msb/bolt-ags-gmaul. While the combo eating and the 1ticking were technically always in game they weren’t used nearly as much as they are now so not very many people felt it necessary to stay such high hp. You’d literally be called a safer for sitting anything about 65 in 2007-2009.

Its not that you can't like OSbuddy, its just that there really isn't any argument you can muster up that's valid, as Runelite simply has everything OSB has, plus more, for no money. 
---
Forget about the features and all that, If you want a good stance on why you use OSB over RL, personal preference, that's it. I was the same way with Konduit, but the moment I tried RL I hopped on board.

As an example, Cannonball slaves are popular due to cannonballs being popular for slayer and Lizardman Shamans. Dwarf Cannon is a very easy quest that doesn't have any requirements and doesn't take time at all and as a reward allows you to smith Cannonballs. Simply having your new cannonball slave making some on the side while you play your main can be really good money. Plus they're fairly AFKable as they take a bit to make.

well at least its in the works. I would definitely ask them to maybe put the bonds back into tradable forms? I would message the same exact thing you told me, and I wouldn't be all that surprised if they x-fered the memberships to the right accounts. I have definitely heard of them doing this before, 100% so worth a shot. 
---
This was discussed on stream, and the short answer was no. The long answer was God Ash explaining how every interaction in Port Phasymatys is made specially to handle the bedsheet interactions correctly due to some underlying issue, but if you were allowed to take it out it would have to either have every single interaction in the game fixed, or disabled individually with a bedsheet equipped with every interaction audited manually. So it would be an obscene amount of time for a cosmetic change, or a complete overhaul of the interaction system.
---
That's cool. Not everyone is you.
---
what’s ur bank at homie?
---
The point is the drop table and many other pieces of content have been adjusted and re-balanced to not detract too much from skilling, yet it completely contradicts itself.
---
I never said it was broken, I never said anything of the sort. It just is completely contradictory to act like you give a shit about skilling integrity and then add things like 150 magic logs to a slayer drop.

Triple your money and don't sell? That's a sure way to lose opportunity cost and probably even money at the same time... I bought 300 of them and sold all over 2.7M each over the past weekend. If you were smart you would've sold those for triple gains and bought hydra bones or something else that actually has potential value from an update besides a shitty reskin that we would never need.
---
So what happens when someone’s afar? They can’t move right? Unless your saying the single ‘take’ will always result Player moving to that location regardless the top item has been removed?
---
*i haven’t tested the feature yet, so idk. I’m just brainstorming.
---
Honestly I think you guys should move towards Badass' table a bit more. I feel like the one that we got still feels pretty weak compared to where it started. Feels alot less like the middle and still more like a hard nerf.

Was there a specific event/person/... that made you decide to better your life?
---
It was put into game without notice or poll, and the initial announcement made it seem like it was going to be super over the top when the actual gameplay just said to be proud of who you are. 
---
Once people saw the thing, a lot of the pushback died down, but the method of announcement was ripe for misjudging.
---
It's not a scam in any way, shape, or form, it's just a money making method that relies on people that are kind enough to try to help a newbie out.  It's literal proflit off of deceiving generous, helpful players.  It's disgusting.

stop witch hunting my comments you freaks

Anytime my man!

Confirmed op uses mom cc to buy bonds.

Did she click the link? Looks like it

If I see any: “nOw Do A NfsW OnE LmAO!” Comment I’ll lose my mind

This is fucking great art work bro, respect!

Then don't say stupid shit and not have a legit source

It turned the frogs gay

Go to bandits in the desert.

Or go to NMZ.

It's not even abuse, it's a fundamental game mechanic and is 100% intended lol.

Or you could make it the higher tier herb the brighter the colour?

You’re lucky Slab City
---
BWAHHHNA! God dangit Bobby!
---
Yes! Lol
---
But you do get TWO death runes per essence. Two! That's twice as many as you used to get at level 65, twelve-point-five million XP ago. 
---
Pray mage, don't stand in melee range (so walk back 1 step after attacking), this way you minimize the RNG of being hit by the style you're not praying. If you want to completely get rid of the odds of being hit, you could use a 6-tick weapon like a Dragon Battleaxe to flinch it.
---
If you're a Zerker, I'm guessing you have 99 Range (or don't mind getting Range XP) so you could Tbow it.
---
Seers
---
100XP is a lot per bone but I mean they require 95 slayer to kill so I guess it makes sense
---
I don't PK at all: 
---
For clues, I'd just suggest 3 items so you don't have any risk. I try to die after my clue to get teleported out faster. 
---
Wild slayer, there is a premium reward for doing it. So you would just need to balance if the money / points are worth the risk of being killed and hassle of finishing tasks. Isn't the counter different from non wild tasks? I'd just take a break and do regular Slayer and return to wild slayer when there's less people active. 
---
Some people just like to kill people for fun, or to irritate people. That's part of the enjoyment for them. Others think you will have loads of cash on you, so they'll try to take advantage of that. 
---
Other than that, I'm not sure what to tell you. 
---
They were limited to Slayer tower. 
---
I think what was bad was the effect it had, it would never hit below 27. Without that effect there would be a place for a relevant magic based special weapon. But definitely no guarantee hit. 
---
 First off, I'm talking about the spec itself, not the weapon's spec potential. No shit that d claws, dds, etc are better in a legitimate fight. Gmaul spec isn't for legit fights. It's to 1tick people, which is why most people tele after using the spec. You can hit 3 times instantaneously. There is no spec better than this. Imagine getting hit by 3 dragon 2h's at the exact same second. Unlike with the gmaul, you can easily combo eat between dds specs or d claw specs. Why do you think most people in pvp have a gmaul on them?
---
I love when people say "I bet you're one of the people.." without any logic or reasoning behind the assumption. No I haven't been brainwashed; I happen to recognize imbalance when I see it instead of accepting everything that doesn't affect me. Your logic about good damage potential but being inconsistent is so stupid. It's like if obby maul was op and could 1 hit you, would you say it's fine because it's inconsistent?

Literally just read the constitution dude. First amendment:
---
&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
---
Congress- the federal government- cannot infringe upon your free speech. It doesn't say anything about any private entities whatsoever.

I read that in Sick Nerd's voice.

Those are some ridiculous stats
---
I just got con from 1-50 today cost about 1m just do anything until you unlock oak stuff then only do oak until 26 then just do the oak table until 31 then do the curved oak table. 
---
Then do the oak lorder at 37 until 50 took about two hours 
---
They said maybe this year at best but don't hold your breath, so far they intend to make you start over.
---
Strength bonus is more important than defense because the extra damage will help a lot more than defense in almost all situations, especially for training your skills faster because you do more damage. A fighter torso and neit helm is much better than dragon.
---
I read that in Sick Nerd's voice

Those requires multiple skills to be 99, dozens of hours of quests, and hundreds of mil worth of gear.
---
All the skilling methods require *one* skill, less than 1m gp, and perhaps a quest. You have to be ignorant to compare them.
---
The "we pay no gay riot" was an absolute gem
---
I believe with duo verac 2 hits to god sword smack is the meta and for trio just burn her down with blow pipes 
---
Usually its courtesy to teleport when you run out of food. This prolongs the fight and makes it more tactical when to use the spec during the fight instead of just using every spec available at once during the beginning and teleporting away to do it again. It’s the same reason people don’t safe to full during fights because it makes it gives both pkers a better chance of getting a kill. If I fought someone who ate to full hp every time I hit them, it would be a huge waste of my time and supplies because I’d almost never get a kill.
---
And teleblock doesn’t really work when people are close to safe zones because it goes away when they step in it and can just teleport to get their spec back.
---
no. this armor was ridiculous. 
---
Best fan art ive seen, looks amazing.
---
hashahahahaharhaha get it because runecrafting is slower than average hahahahahauururk0000l0l000l
---
thumbs down every time I get a dragon's eye step
---
Do you remember how much it cost including the upgrades? 
---
Imo it was stupid to hit magic based damage but so that your strenght bonus would affect the hit.
---
Unless you're doing high level bossing where you'll want Barrows anyway., you're usually training on lower level monsters where the defence bonus doesnt matter as much and you'll get kills quicker with higher str bonus and quicker exp that way.
---
Look into defenders if you haven't heard of them before.
---
Your the same guy who made the login screen! Legendary work.
---
This also happened in the first days of raids 1 when people would drop an insane load of supplies at olm. 
---
but wouldnt monsters, such as hell hounds, rip through me?
---
Just do rooftops, Canifis was the best spot, but your level is too high to be effective. Just do whatever you can at your level. 
---
Haven't killed them in a while(like half a year) but I remember them dropping Blood Runes very frequently as well as plenty of alchables.
---
agree
---
Man this is really good art but I'm sorry I just gotta say that I would let her defile me 24/7
---
My reason was 1. I dont want the game to get political. 2. Mod Wolf handled the criticism really bad (iirc there’s tweets still up) 3. I hate when we get updates shoved down our throats. 
---
This issue was the entire basis of the creation of the Granite Clamp. Jagex polled something like 5 different changes and every single one of them failed, so now it's a cosmetic-only item and gmaul changes have been shelved for a while due to the community's resounding "no" votes to any form of change to it. I believe that changes were also tossed about during the creation of Guardians since gmaul price problems fit into that discussion, but I don't believe those ever made it past stream strawpolls.
---
Wow doesn't require multiple accounts, it requires multiple characters. And multiple characters don't cost multiple subs.

Like there is very few "account" lock out content. Lock outs are generally character specific.

They aren't being polled yet. They are simply getting feedback on the suggested polls before actually polling them.

no way am i gonna 3 tick or spam drop items. if im training a gathering skill i actually want something to show for it

I've checked there but it says that the last poll polled was poll #62.5, the spell book filter again
---
Just because he said the freaking N word??? As a gamer, I will be the first one to tell you how oppressed we are. We’ve been bullied by the jocks for years, our parents think we’re dissapiontments. Most of us have never even had sex before. But, I can look past all of that, all the bigotry and racism towards gamers I can deal with. But these SJW gaming companies trying to take away my ability to say the N word... No... Just.. No. Gamers NEED to be able to say the N word. How do you think we are able to stand all of this oppression and relentless attacks from the mainstream media? Gamers must exert their gaming stress through using the N word. If we can’t use the N word our gamer stress builds up. And you DONT want to know what happens when I max out on gamer stress. So heads up to gaming companies, let us say the N word, and keep minorities out of video games. This is all I ask of you. Rant over

Can I ask how people are getting under 2 minute kills on Hydra. I've only done around 100 or so. I can pray switch all that stuff fine. But my best time is only 2:22. Any tips on speeding up time? (I got max gear outside of twisted bow)
---
Hey some of us still enjoy and do drive manual. And some still can but just don't. But majority of us have no clue! 
---
Personally I will make my daughters learn to drive in a manual before I let them drive an automatic. I believe having the ability to drive (which is just a lot of multitasking really) a manual first helps in the overall ability learning to do all of the things you need to do while driving. Then if they want to drive an automatic once they have their own cars that's fine, and having a few less things to think about should just make driving that much easier. 
---
It’s trash 
---
Konduit stopped updating once Runelite released as Runeltie is superior in every way. There's been a lot of scam sites for runelite download so make sure to download from runelite.net
---
you didn't read the post lol
---
I actually recommend you guys watch this because this may actually be one of the worst YouTube videos I've ever seen.  It's honestly fascinating that someone could create this bad of a video. 
---
ah, fair enough. Thanks
---
It’s fun
---
Then that means its not being polled yet. Check again when it is.
---

Has Konduit ever been the go to lol?
---
It was always OSB then RL for me.

Lova?

Nobody gets 77 Rc.
---
Anglerfish are alright.
---
DWH is OP but seemed like an afterthought. "Shayzien need to have SOMETHING. I know! Killer spec weapon with a terrible drop rate!
---
At least it's useful.
---
It's what the community wanted
---
Just bring a few p pots tbh and pray flick. I know most people are gonna say "mehh that requires paying attention and clicking" which I understand if you want to afk it, but I flick almost every task and I do it mainly so I can have the bonus strength and attacks. I'll flick the protection prayer if needed, but typically I wont need to do it to negate damage on an inventory of monkfish or karambwon (sp?) and it just makes it so much faster using piety for each hit lol. 
---
But yeah, str is always more important than defense. You can find some scenarios where you'll want tank gear over strength but for training and slaying/doing pretty much anything you're gonna want str bonus over defense. 
---
Only 250 hours remaining

Weird, looks like hunter to me.

oh, alright, thanks! i just thought that since they were changing it so much i was worried about missing it

How long did it take to complete the quest? I’m 10 quest points and like 1 mining away from starting it. Very excited

so sorry to have bothered your karma farm, goodlucj with that nice payoff of 41 updoots.

I wish runescape music videos would make a comeback.

I'd let her hit through my prayer

It probably overall took about 5 hours. Worked on it in bit and pieces because of work and sleep.
---
So other people have already said this and gotten their downvotes and a bunch of *stupid* comments saying "Jagex has the right to ban anyone for any reason!"
---
Sure they do. Its their game. But dont you guys think this is similar to school giving detentions for out of school behavior? Yeah, they can do it, but is it any of their business? Is it actually right just because they can do it and have every right to do it?
---
Cant we just accept what the streamer did was bad, but not go into this huge overreach? Ban his Twitch account. Thats what makes sense. This is a huge overreach. Jagex shouldnt start banning people for out of game behavior, unless it is directly related to the game, which I would argue this isnt. 
---
Wheres the line? The guy told someone to kill themselves while they had runescape on in the background. Will I also get suspended if I stream myself robbing a liquir store while playing mobile? What if I smoke some weed in a place it isnt legal? 
---
I think its totally acceptable for people to acknowledge this was bad, while also disagreeing with what Jagex did here. Its in their rights but I dont think its any of their business and I dont think its an acceptable thing to do.
---
Phising links, malware/keyloggers, data breaches of other websites where you used same info as rs and lastly jagex broken recovery system. Those are pretty much all the possibilities.
---
&gt; (skilling for gp is op)
---
Oh you sweet summer child lol
---
I mean, that's your interpretation of it, I see a rope for a quest. You can't hang yourself if the chair wont stand up... Your comment is also cringeworthingly over dramatic in the way you talk and the things you say, like you were either baked out of your mind or trying way too hard to get upvotes
---
Will jagex use this event as a precedent for all future twitch streamer behavior?
---
This has to be the thousandth time this has happened considering the unrestricted and often vulgar nature of osrs chat.
---
Can jagex release a statement saying whether they will ban anybody with video evidence of acting in bad taste like this, or is it strictly a twitch platform issue and more of a problem with the online advertisement of the game?
---
I’ve always wanted to stream or make videos but with the several instances of jagex banning content creators because they acted inappropriately in a video containing osrs content, I wonder what will be the next rude twitch video that gets someone instantly and permanently banned from a game they enjoy
---
It's not the same when you know you can use it though. Like imagine playing minecraft on creative mode (infinite resources), but playing like you were on survival mode. It wouldn't be as fun as playing on survival mode.
---
Treasure hunter was the rune 2h
---
The upper limit is 20 characters. Even with 10 alphanumeric characters your password is borderline uncrackable with today's technology unless it is password12. Most accounts get hacked due to breaches or social engineering as it is. You claiming it is near impossible to make a strong password with 20 characters is fucking laughable. 
---
Again, its the difference between cracking a password in 1 trillion years or 100 trillion years. It doesn't matter that is objectively makes that number bigger when the number is too big to begin with. What the industry standard is means fuck all. Case sensitivity on passwords is just a smokescreen so that dumb fucks like you that have no idea what they are talking about can feel better about having a shitty password.

Yeah no thanks.

Thank you. You saved me some frustration. I feel like if i waited a little longer then i could have figured it out myself.

Jagex has always been trolling. The entirety of runescape is a joke.

Man zuhaar really is a scuffed artist my comparison

Think of the fire as the mtx. It shall do it

Probably should melee assuming your stats r higher.  That's going to take forever with 53 range, especially cause you would want to minimize risk also.

I'm at 96 agility right now. I've made the process easier by splitting my computer screen four ways: top left has netflix, top right has my woodcutting account, bottom left is my fishing account, and bottom right is my main leveling agility. I can't think of any other way to kill the tedium.
---
Yeah, me too, only seed that i whould get right whould be toadflax
---
It is obviously a player using the set.

IIRC after rs3 mobile full release there will be engine dev time available to investigate if it's feasible.
---
Just wish there was a non profit alternative way
---
Did the ferryman come? 
---
For clues, that's already what I'm doing. Still annoying you have to waste another 10 minutes just because some guy doesn't like killing people that actually put up a fight. And I normally don't even do wildy slayer, I just didn't want to risk losing my streak because I just got 2 God Wars tasks in a row, which is something I REALLY CANNOT do, and I ran out of slayer points to cancel, so I figured the safest thing to do was get above 30 points with a wildy slayer task.
---
Things are getting heated in here.
---
At least it's uniques

Hmm true I didn't think about that, idk, if the groups were 2-4 players max, and u couldn't leave or switch groups, i dont think itd be terrible to let established iron man form groups tho idk.. I just think itd be fun to play with my brother as ironman, so we can trade drops with each other only.. thanks for the info tho!

it works xD around 800k an hour for making adam bars or super glass make and its chill

Sacred clay body lmao

where do i buy this game???
---
Tbh even though it’s true, they are literally gaining nothing but an extra kill to there KD. But as a Pvmer I love the risk of going to the wildy expecting to die. It’s what it was meant for. You can drop your clue if it’s in the wild, but ima still go regardless. It’s not that hard to get another hard clue. We’re literally feeding they’re egos by making posts like this they want us to rage.

Had a master clue that had back, to back, to back, three piece clues all had me go to this god foresaken text box hell hill.

I was downvoted to absolute oblivion for expressing similar views. Good on you for surviving the death squads. Generally speaking expressing any disapproval with anything associated with Democratic processes is seen the same way in modern society that questioning the Pope was seen in 10th Century Rome.

Yes, I meant rune haha, autocorrect. With no void, I would recommend just blessed dhide or the best dhide you can currently wear. Just go for more range attack bonus, and range strength bonus if you can 
---
I’m not sure how it will go at your level now that I think about it. From what I know, msb should still best rcb since the next bosses have pretty low defense. Good luck!

Tanzoo and virtoso man. They make quality content
---
That actually makes life seem like such a worthless thing in the grand scheme of things. No, it's just brainless kids who think penis and poop jokes are funny, at an evolved rate.
---
Is that due to the runecrafting bags no longer being necessary due to Zeah?
---
I’ve just realised this, those pouches have stopped me runecrafting for years, which is a shame because it seems a skill id like. Now trying to figure out how to get 77 with the minimum possible effort haha

i though when you dont make that ring and keep all 3 items in bank you cant get duplicate.. can you?

Prayer and runecrafting, my god.

This is so sick. I love it.

Wheres the soul?

Its still getting to an alter, i mean rather then a warding skill just put it into rc
---
Damn dude you’ve got skill! Please do more!
---
i sold them before you told me to now i have more then ever =D
---
Because noobs keep posting pictures of their account without hiding their run energy and prayer points. The hacker can then smite the owner for their account once they have that information
---
Maybe try not being color blind?
---
RIP cannonballs
---
Wow really? Who's selling them though!? I can't remember the last time I ever decided to sell my 10k water runes on the GE for that glorious 40k....!
---
I loved Ganodermic and I still really enjoy the fungal theme but if there’s a degradable armor repaired/recharged with a pvm drop, it would still need to be weaker for OSRS.
---
There’s definitely design space for something similar though.

You can only marry the prince if your character is female and vice versa, that's what I mean. I'm not dumb, I know the difference between gender and sexuality  lol

How’s the fish XP on those bad boys? 
---
That's more like a coin drop.
---
That's fucking awful wtf 
---
It's nice for consistency more than anything but I'd be kidding myself if I though that would help me see if it's torstol or ranarr, without reading.
---
Ahhhhh, gotcha 
---
Just get the pathing down, stand where you need to be when it's changing form etc. My PB is with addy darts, could easily cut another 20s off if I used dragon darts, even more if I have tbow
---
I need me some sloths facts
---
I see you dont use the collapsible menu
---
some are still hard to tell apart but it would be a good addition
---
I had the first gen iPhone and managed to download a Java browser after jailbreaking it. Got like 2 fps but I was able to play RS. Win!!
---
you’re weird 
---
&gt;1: "Yo '*my name*' we are on your account right now... we need some information... pick up our calls or your account is gone... forever."  
---
2: "'*my name*' we are suicide botting your account right now so it'll get perma banned. Pick up the phone."  
---
3: "*long silence..........* You better pick up the fucking phone." \[This was a different person than the first two\]
---
Almost immediately after, I received a DM on twitter from an account with the name "RSOraclex". I did not open the DM, but the DM preview showed me two messages. The first just said, "Yo are you there?" And the second was a link to what I believe was a screenshot of them on my account. I don't actually know, because I didn't even open the DM, I just deleted the entire conversation immediately.
---
At this point I had been up for about 24 hours straight as I got the phishing email about 1 minute before I fell asleep. The above experience lasted for the course of maybe 6 - 8 hours and included me frantically tweeting and DMing every Mod and content creator I could find to see if there was any way to just talk to someone from Jagex, explain my situation, and have my account locked before they were able to remove my authenticator. This, as you can imagine, was a fruitless endeavor. Before I went to sleep, I first changed all of my passwords everywhere. Then I attempted unsuccessfully to recover my account twice. My account was created over a decade ago so recalling the initial information about it is near impossible. At this point I was sick physically, mentally, and certainly emotionally so I sent in one last attempt at recovery and managed to fall asleep.
---
After waking up I saw that my recovery request was accepted. I changed my password and attempted to login as I normally do with my authenticator. Unfortunately, my authenticator was removed and replaced with the authenticator of the hijackers. I disabled their authenticator, added my own back, and logged in to find my account standing at the GE with everything I had equipped gone. When I checked my bank and entered my PIN, I saw a message telling me that the removal of my bank PIN was cancelled. Fortunately for me, my PIN saved me from losing everything.
---
TLDR: I was hacked
---
**Protect Your Account -----**
---
After this experience I was incredibly angry with myself, angry with Jagex, and furious with the disgusting, pathetic, and sociopathic people that do this type of stuff. A couple days have gone by and as I start to think clearly again I figure that the best way to stop these hijackers is to try to help the community by sharing my experience and sharing what I believe would have prevented the hijack of my account and hopefully yours as well.
---
**Here's a checklist of what you should do:**
---
**1.** Make sure your passwords are **strong**. I'm talking randomly generated numbers and symbols (if symbols are allowed) of at least 16 digits. This one is pretty obvious.
---
**2.** Make sure that every password for every account you have is completely different. You should not recycle passwords, no matter how tempting it is for convenience sake.
---
**3.** Create a new email that is **ONLY** used as the contact email for your Runescape account. Do not link it with anything else, do not connect it with social media etc. This new email should also have an incredibly strong password.
---
**4.** Enable 2 factor authentication as well as SMS verification codes for every account you have that allows it. You can download an authenticator app on your smart phone from the App Store or Google Play Store.
---
**5.** If you haven't already, setup a bank PIN by talking to a banker in game. Select the option that requires a **7-day waiting period** for your PIN to be removed should someone request it. Your PIN should also be strong, meaning not your birth year and not a repetition of 4 of the same digits. **NEVER** enter your PIN anywhere other than in-game on Runescape. There is no other place that it will be requested and if it is, the people requesting it are attempting to hijack your account. And to be extra safe, make your PIN random and memorize it - don't write it down anywhere because this is your last line of defense.
---
**6. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS bank all of your items every single time you logout**. If a hijacker gets on your account, there is no way they can steal your items unless they know your bank PIN. This is probably something you do occasionally, but not all the time. MAKE IT A PRIORITY.
---
I failed to follow steps 3 and 6 which I believe is what lead to my account being compromised.
---
A couple bonus tips:
---
* NEVER click any link in any email that asks to you login to Runescape. If you need to login, go directly to the Runescape website in your browser. There are legitimate occasions where Runescape may email, but if you aren't being vigilant you may not notice that it's a fake until it's too late.
---
* NEVER go to any twitch stream that says "Quitting - giving away xbillions" etc. These are phishing streams that are being view-botted to look legitimate. They will request that you login via their phishing link and enter your credentials. When you do this, they immediately receive your IP address. They will then DDoS your internet to log you out of the game and keep you out while they steal everything on your account. Remember your PIN will NEVER be required anywhere but inside the actual game.
---
* Setup a password management program like Dashlane, LastPass, or 1Password. These will keep track of complex passwords and will allow you to change them whenever you want.
---
**How Jagex Should be Protecting Your Account -----**
---
Now, if Mod's still take the time to read the concerns of their community (not just content creators) here's what **JAGEX**must do to help secure the accounts of their community and DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of hijacking and real world trading.
---
**1.** **IMPLEMENT AN AUTHENTICATOR REMOVAL DELAY**. Why we are still asking for this after years of being ignored is beyond me. You'll notice I don't have an authenticator step on the list above this, that's because there is literally no reason to have one. If someone gains access to your account, the easiest step is clicking "remove authenticator" and having it instantly disappear. It provides absolutely no additional security whatsoever. It won't hurt to have one, but it certainly won't help.
---
**2. Allow players the option to require a PIN to enter the game**. Entering your PIN after logging in would unlock the bank and GE clerks, and would prevent hijackers from stealing everything that you currently have out of the bank.
---
**3. Give us some form of support in these situations**. The most discouraging thing about having your account compromised is that there is literally nothing you can do and no one you can get help from. If the best option for account support is to frantically tweet at your employees hoping someone will tell someone who will help you, then you are doing something horribly wrong and irresponsible as a company. It's beyond frustrating knowing that your account is in jeopardy but there is no one that you can reliably ask for help.
---
This post took about an hour longer than I wanted it to and is probably 10x longer than it was supposed to be, but I suppose I have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I hope that you find this helpful and if your account isn't as secure as it could be, please take the appropriate steps to lock it down. The best revenge on these basement-dwelling sociopathic hijackers is to stop their income stream by securing your accounts. God bless.
---
Lol XD
---
How would them being paid more help?
---
You have penis in your Reddit username. You think you’re funny or something?
---
Hands down the ugliest piece of equipment in the game.
---
Accurate af damn
---
i spelled "respective" wrong FeelsBadMan
---
haha
---
Doesnt look good
---
That is not how picking up items work, when you pick up item it will just send x/y and item id to the server, so it doesnt matter what item in menu you click at all.
---
Honestly don't care about changing your mind but most of your points are shit.   
---
Camping clue scroll locations is a myth, nobody does it.  Its literally a massive waste of time and the fact people assume this is a thing is hilarious.    There are no quest spots in the wilderness and wilderness slayer was intended to be the way it is right now so if you choose not to do BH for emblems theres still the pk aspect around earning them.
---
I understand that and I sort of understand clue scroll camping because you might get something, but most of the time you wont. I really don't understand the people who camp places like earth warriors and kill people just trying to do their slayer task. If I'm doing earth warriors, the most they're going to get is an enchanted gem and maybe some lobsters. Why world hop it and kill anyone there? Another example I don't understand is people world hoping lava eels. They're not getting anything from it since all I have is an oily rod and bait. They're wasting money on runes to kill people for zero gain.
---
Says he pleb that’s been on here long time with 0 original posts in any way. Lmao 
---
I like how this "bug" is just one of the devs inputting the item code rather than the noted item code for the table haha. 
---
Nothing says there's still here tho, we can assume they are still obtainable but this is jamflex so yeah who knows until someone says hes got a piece after today
---
Lul
---
Looks great and is silly but the post doesn’t make any sense to me.. What’s the relation between all of these things? I understand the autism and skills but what?
---
How do I reset the combat stat penalties of consumables like wizard mind bomb? I use a ton trying to farm wines of zamarok and my melee stats get set to such a low value and take forever to get back to  normal. (I am f2p trying to get bond)
---
"what are you doing, bwana?!?"
---
I always end my fruit tree runs there since it's so close to the bank
---
355 was yesterday, we’re on 356 today. Get with the program kid. 
---
I knew sock boots were a thing, I did not know sock shoes were.
---
What is the GP Price tag on this?
---
im playing oldschool runescape not a private server/rs3
---
It's a toss up.
---
Tome i think costs more to cast than flames, but both are good options.
---
You could always just say fuck it and splash to fire surge.
---
73
---
The shields are on a separate drop table chance from the other drops as well as themselves. Also,  got the dragon hide and bones, but my client hides them. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Alora RoldSchoolPuneScape?
---
😂😂😂
---
Just an expression. I did not purchase a ticket.
---
Think about it this way:
---
making hundreds of posts saying "wow I like this game, good job Jagex" isn't particularly constructive or helpful. We already tell Jagex we like the game with our 11+ dollars per month.
---
On the other hand, making a post about what needs to be fixed or adjusted *is* constructive. The Old School team is *very* small for a game this popular, so having the community be so involved is actually helpful. Jmods have said so countless times.
---
We're passionate about this game and we want it to be the best it can be for years and years to come.
---
Brilliant. Now do one of sandwich lady.
---
Bro beans
---
It would take away the classic feel of the game and also make it very difficult for anyone to figure out what kind of gear the opponent would be using in pvp. That is why I am against it
---
The shields drop separately to the other drops.
---
So get 75 attack? Do I quest it or actually train it? What strength? I don’t want any strength levels correct? 
---
Why is it nsfw lol
---
r/tipofmypenis
---
First off thank you for pointing out that you can retrieve an extra anti-dragon shield I forgot about that and hence the reason for this post, which was to learn more. I will say though that saying I can 100% avoid the wildy is false. There are slayer tasks that require you to go there and if you're low enough level or have few enough points you can't avoid these.
---
I'm not an overly generous player but I do help people out if I happen to be good on gp or if I feel like they'll use it better. If they're at the GE on a populated world they're soft begging 90% of the time, not directly asking but making it known they want free stuff.
---
Odds are though anything he says would be wasted on her to begin with
---
This a joke?
---
Dyes are the thing that would break the classic feel not everything since 2013
---
As I am killing Vorkath currently these numbers are not consistent. (Try it yourself on OSbuddy if you like). Not sure why the numbers aren't streamline. 
---
Rune bolts (unf) tanked after Konar drop table release, could be a factor
---
Just get a job and get membership
---
The thing is, I’m trying to see this from Jagex’s perspective. Is an “alive and healthy” game one that preserves the same level of challenge, or one that has more players? Because the way I see it, the older players are leaving one by one. As a company, they can’t sustain themselves off of one customer base that isn’t growing. If you really love this game and want to continue enjoying it, wouldn’t you want to support changes that keep new players coming in? If they run out of money, we have no game. 
---
No new players = no servers. 
---
Chocolate???!! CHOCOLATTTTEEEEE!!!!!!!
---
This is unacceptable, someone help this man out.
---
This devalues my colorblind ironman D:
---
Whats his crafting lvl?
---
Improved Account security would be the first thing on my list.
---
Any advice on killing Killerwatts? I feel like fighting one is hard enough and I don't wanna skip the task or make a million trips.
---
&gt; It is also an objective fact that some users would be able to make their relatively weak passwords significantly stronger if they were allowed to use special characters and case sensitive characters
---
Then your password is currently shitty. As I said, a smokescreen for dumb fucks. Continue to live in your ignorance. 
---
Hey man, Lova gave us the amazing elite clue step to hand in a box of armor
---
Good bot
---
You know that doing a regular task doesn’t remove your wilderness slayer task streak right? They are completely separate lol
---
But mining and runecrafting are fun 🤔
---
I hope you step on a Lego.
---
tldr its a pretty typical "pretend to recruit someone to anti lure/lure with me"
---
Lova = Lovakengj
---
Lol. Pkers are toxic for pking in the wilderness? Out of all the things in the game you chose to complain about this?
---
For Section 12, does it only apply to actions that occur in Jagex's games, or does it also apply to actions outside of their games, like if a player stole something or got a speeding ticket?
---
Do other games have legal conditions like this?
---
Yes, any slayer master won't assign something you can't reasonably do.
---
And that’s perfectly okay. You can continue to use the weaker and less fun client and I haven’t a care in the world. 
---
Good luck my friendk!
---
“Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?”
---
“So I can lower it.”

damn
---
Prepping? Abusing an outdated mechanic..
---
Corp should reset 100% when no-one is in there.
---
:D
---
Was that not the case?
---
No but i appriciate the effect 
---
Idk how long you’ve played for but a lot of people are overly passionate about updates in particular because we watched our favorite game get beaten into the ground by Jagex 10 years ago and haven’t forgotten about it. I would be really upset if that happened again.
---
It’s cool, twisted bow is SO oldschool.
---
?
---
Stick to a mix of defense and str gear. Torso + barrows legs for instance is good. Don't waste pray pots when you can eat cheap fish.
---
Was a different era back then. Would be fine now with the quality of skill now a days. 
---
Run into dusk and dawn, die, tele with slayer ring, pick up logs, tele to bank and repeat 
---
Where do I see this blog post?
---
Let me introduce you to the world of videos of top 100 ehp players rambling for 20 odd minutes in a monotone voice about what skills they'll do next and why the updates to the game sucks.
---
No /s btw, b0aty formula progress videos are so bad that this is actually more enjoyable.
---
EET FUK
---
Barrows tabs are nice.
---
Ensouled heads are a waste of time IMO as long as the wildy altar stays OP.
---
I just starting doing kourend favour and I have zero desire to get them all to 100%.  Rather just get shazyien for lizardmen tasks (I wouldn't if I was a main) arceus for barrows tabs (again I wouldn't if I was a main) and hosidious for all the OPness.
---
I completely agree with you. What I’m trying to get at, however, is that I see backlash to every change/update on this subreddit that is homogeneously negative. I don’t see this as constructive. I see it as general distaste towards any sort of change, yet the poll system is still bringing these updates into the game. 75% of the players enjoying new content, but I don’t see them here. 
---
Read the description. I didn't say all were, only the types I listed. The point of this post is a discussion to see if there is something about those groups that I am missing/not understanding. 
---
Yes you get duplicates
---
tried but u can’t alch trash :’C
---
Well you see the difficulty with postmodern account values is that it doesn't function on a basis of reality, they only see the social context of your total level and cash stack.  And to have a civilized society we can't treat people as a number; it's absolutely abzurd
---
I don’t either. And I hate to be this cynical but this has got me thinking, does Jagex or some Jagex employees get kickbacks from certain hijackers? Think about it, if they implement an authenticator delay, that would have a huge impact on the amount of RWT in the game. When a person hijacks an account, they immediately sell off all the gold to gold selling sites who in turn sell it back to players. 
---
Given the track record of Jagex in the recent past, I wouldn’t be very surprised if some segment or individual of the team is preventing an authenticator delay from being implemented because if that happens, they’d no longer get a percentage of what is stolen and sold to gold websites.
---
I hope to God that this isn’t the case and I have no evidence to support it other than: why in the ever loving hell haven’t you done more to help secure accounts for your player base.
---
The reversion was provided in good faith by one of our administrators citing that the information came from an RS3 exclusive event. In the future, add an imgur link to the edit description to an edit you're unsure of. In the mean time I've reverted it back.
---
Defence bonus is important but there’s a balance. I recommend using a max hit calculator and finding out at what strength bonus you’ll get a max hit. The increased max hits work out to you getting hit less. A fighter torso or bandos chest plate and a berserker helmet for give almost as much strength bonus as a fury for example.
---
Haha thanks bro. I was being cheeky. Lova doesnt exist. It's dead content.
---
Gz on 57 farming. Gz on insane rng that is making a lot of people very upset.
---
While I admit that getting new players is a good thing, I don't care about net growth (and actually see it as generally a bad thing). If the game has to become worse in my eyes to get popular, then it's slowly dying anyway, and in a way that I can't combat by throwing more money at it. 
---
terrible. like 5k an hour
---
Dang you're right! Crap. Best content
---
Idk ask Google they don't have one 
---
I’m listening...
---
Keep that dumb shit in RS3.
---
Petrol enema, friendly guys Donnie in most times of the day cause we have people from Australia Canada USA and europe
---
Theres a bunch of ways to make 60k super quick like picking white berries, gathering mort Myers fungi.  Get a d scim with that money and some monkfish and camp gargoyles for an hour.  Now you will have about 500k and can probably get gear for raids (use void) you could do zulrah, I'm sure you could still get like 1m/hr at vorkath with 500k of gear
---
Only 50m that's garbage. You can make like 50m a day begging if you know how to do it right
---
The vast majority don’t pray flick or even care enough to consider it. Bandos is priced due to being BIS, not because it’s worth the price for the average player. 
---
For 600k you can buy Torags plate/legs (for 20k prosylyte) 
---
Do the sums.
---
Nobody liked that.
---
Imagine having to pray mage lmao
---
Yee haw 
---
My bad! :D
---
Yee haw
