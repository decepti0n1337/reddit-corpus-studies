4:20 downtime and very good rng on olm

As you can see he has 1.7m total xp so probably nothing crazy high yet.
---
Could you not pre-link accounts as an effort to stop a black market from forming? Say "Iron Blorb" wants the rewards on their main "Blorb", so before the League starts they go through a linking system (requiring entering both logins, maybe?) so points are sent to Blorb instead of Iron Blorb?
---
Well 2 lucky people 6.5m, thanks for the turnout
---
Yeah bro I can barely ever complete a while master clue üòÇ

maybe it is guaranteed at 200m xp?

I won't call a boss rush mode anything but boss rush
---
Boss rush mode with no rewards seems cool (with rewards makes it mandatory)

---
I will say though any content thats in multicombat is group content
---
Just because SOME OF yall some bitches playing EFFICIENCYSCAPE and not RUNESCAPE doesn't mean the content isn't there.
---
Get in line luv

Depends on the girth

Just FYI videos and photos are evidence of anything in the eyes of Jagex due to how easily they can be faked. That being said contact your ISP and tell them what‚Äôs going on and they‚Äôll come and change your IP address or help you do it. But if you‚Äôre legitimately hoping that your discord screenshots carry weight and that Jagex will/should take action based on that evidence you‚Äôre going to be disappointed.
---
Not being rude, just curious, why the big appeal for twisted league? I haven't really read the blog or anything but I hear the mode will disappear in January? Why go the lengths to do all of the things people are doing? Are there rewards for main account? Again, just curious. Thanks.

That's what it takes!

Ranger boots clue 1980.. u know runelite takes screen shots right lol

well the net isn't the problem (you can catch imps with butterfly nets) the problem is you don't have the jars to put them in so that's why you can only barehand them.

Just a few more boots then maybe

Omg those earrings are awesome

How is F2P so dead? Did they actually get rid of the bots?

They gave you a good example of public interest not aligning with worker‚Äôs to disprove your statement that public interest always aligns with worker‚Äôs interest.

All the extra run time you have though is outweighed by having to collect 10 times the ammo though. Unless you're doing solo CoX endurance is useless.

replace 2 or 3 of your food with sara brews, use them to heal in between kills , resore and pot up, it allows me to get 5-6 kills every trip with melee. i dont woox walk, but only heal on the acid pool phase or if i absolutley have to ie less than 32 hp...
---
i know this is really weird but are you by any chance, jake hill?
---
....so that‚Äôs a thing huh
---
So basically you could beat pures who are lvl 1 def and dont want to longshot/far cast right? Or can spells reach the same range without being defensive?
---
Being an avid stalker myself I always recomend spend it while you got it. Spend the 125m before you get bored and start chucking Bill's at the casino. Always better to have used it then loose it
---
Sorry I misread the purpose of your post. I thought you wanted help setting some longer term goals not just for the month of membership. Unfortunately I‚Äôm no help because I‚Äôve been a member for so long and don‚Äôt really know what would be good to get done.

Maybe pay better attention? I don't see how looting something you left behind makes a player "scummy".

Reminds me of the time I was at fire giant task in kourend and kept telegrabbing the alchables from a guy afk abbies
---
This was happening to me and an other guy last night at trolls. He just stood far away with a magic bow tagging everything we fought. We eventually hopped cuz it got really annoying. He didn't say anything though.
---
Such a trippy looking vehicle
---
&gt;doesn't really have any disadvantages
---
You hwhat?  What if I have 1 exp left in a combat skill before getting level 99.
---
In OSRS, I would get that 99 during that kill, while in RS3 I have to wait for the enemy to die.
---
I could've been on my way to another skill in OSRS by the time I was done in RS3.  Absolutely inefficient, and a waste of time on RS3's end.
---
Where is this

I did 65 to 83 construction and it cost me like 32m doing mahogany tables. Was expensive but 83 con is definitely worth it
---
Just got to 74, still going strong. Might even go for 150 or 200...I started konar at 95 slayer and I'm 400k to 97. Maybe a 95-97 slayer brimstone key count could be interesting.
---
Also been keeping my hard clues from the same amount of time. I'm lazy and forgetful about clues so that's only 16.
---
Getting hacked is 100% the fault of the person getting hacked.

Powermining iron is 60k + exp per hour without buying tons of emeralds, crafting binding and duel rings, and honestly not bad imo. Id much rather do f2p powermining.

Has anyone else ever loaded up RuneScape in the background while watching a video or something and forget. And then you here a sound and are like...yo...what the fuck is that....and start looking around your room. And then you finally remember. Idk maybe something is wrong with me. This or when there is a like a knocking on the door sound in a song, always scared the shit outta me

The gnome area is like the last place in the game that hasn‚Äôt received a proper graphical update in RS3, and it‚Äôs been stuck that way for a few years. The Grand Tree looks like a stump, and all the gnomes are just tiny little humans basically. If you look at what RS3 did with the dwarves, people expected a similar graphics overhaul, but with the absolute state of RS3 development rn, it‚Äôs probably not gonna happen.

Hey there OP!
---
I have a suggestion for how you can actually use the copyrighted images in your app without any problems. Just pull them dynamically from the Official Old School RuneScape Grand Exchange API. The Jagex Developers made the API and the data returned from iit available to the public. If they still have an issue with that then Jagex is in the wrong and need to make their GE  API private. If they decided to make that API public to developers, then they've lost the right to complain about a developer using that API in their own product. HOWEVER..... the issue is that you did make your app a pay to unlock pro version app, which does violate the copyright licence terms. If you contact Jagex and agree to distribute your app FOR FREE not for profit, then they probably would be fine with it. I was actually going to contact them myself since I'm in the process of making an app that uses that GE Search API but for a different use than your app. My app is actually more similar to GE Tracker but not shady like that website..... I'd be glad to put in a request as well to have your app reinstated in the  Google Play Store if you think you can live with the non profit type of situation. What do you say, OP? Send me a reply, OP, and let me know if you want my help as a fellow programmer in getting your app reinstated in the Google Play Store.

No major update in months, only 3 new quests over the last year, a huge amount of jmods leaving literally every week, and a doubling down on MTX even in the face of community uproar.
---
Last week it was discovered that the Nex gear that was sold a la Treasure Hunter keys was actually the graphical rework for Nex gear. To reiterate: not only was some of the best gear in the game available for purchase, but the dev time that *should* have gone into an in-game rework/remaster became another microtransaction. Pretty much sums up the game right now.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
It's possible under some circummstances.
---
Competition is fine and all, but its a 2 month mode where you get a marginal reward for being within percentiles. That appeals to very few people, it does not appeal to me. So should i call your idea of why to play it a bad decision?

I'm not sure if that's true? I've been in there for hours at a time and never once have to click mobs, they all aggro and auto retaliate stays on forever. I've had it running in the background of my movies all day just only rapid heal to keep myself at 1hp.
---
I did however figure out my problem, it was a mob with multiple lives, you stop generating xp on it after its first drop to 0, the more you know...
---
Do you usually keep a membership year round then? Or only up it when you're reminded the game exists?
---
Lmao ye this, i always end ou with no skip. I just wish slayer cape perk allow you a few skip daily rather than 10% of rerolling task
---
Its not worth unless u got rigour and 92+ ranged

I was anti pking, I had d scim, dds and a dragon cross bow. With bandos boots, Karils skirt, black dhide body ,range cape and crystal shield.

---
They were swapping out so as soon as the sped trade timer was over so even when I auto retaliated they were never going to get close to dying.

I love this idea for a quest. I speaks to my imagination and has all the setup of a great thing to do. I don't really agree with the rewards, there are simply too many of them, new spells, bis prayer gear, new prayers etc. While I dont mind all these things coming from a continuation of the temple series, I wouldn't put them in a single quest, regardless off the difficulty.

The game doesn't keep track of your mouse movements, which is something they've said before. The only thing that it keeps track of is when you click on the screen.
---
Ive found the randomized mouse clicking with no movement the best. The one with random location within a zone teleports your mouse so thats more detectable imo, unless you used it on an emulator and did it thru mobile

Yes but it doesn‚Äôt work for recolor. 256 for dairy.
---
yes out of the 70k accounts created for twisted league. and 4k active subreddit members. bizarre bubble you live in redditor

Here's your answer.
---
Google the following: "OSRS NMZ most points". This takes you to a wiki page that answers your common question.
---
You're welcome, no need to respond with "thank you kind stranger &lt;3".
---
Nah, you 3 and anyone else who just says ‚Äòit‚Äôs dumb‚Äô is the real dummy. We all know Zulrah bots are a big problem and none of you absolute dummies add anything constructive to finding a solution by just shooting down others ideas without contributing anything yourself. If you think my idea is dumb, either challenge it or add an alternative idea. Pathetic.
---
I have been known to be a bit of a rune goblin. Those things add up.
---
Found some new copypasta lovely thank u
---
what do you mean rip rng? you have a visage now
---
Lol that's too much risk for me. I was thinking more of the osrs flipping meta. Log in once a day, have steady stock items worth like ‚Ç¨5 ea. Buy for ‚Ç¨4,9 and sell for ‚Ç¨5,1. Or wouldn't this work irl and thus be more like merching meta on osrs instead of flipping?
---
Idk about that I have 3 pets in league that I have yet to get in regular scape even though each skill I have above 50m exp. also have had 2 3rd age clues in vambraces and plateskirt.

So sad but so true

yes sorry, you can only give watson one of each tier at a time untill you have given him all tiers up to elite - then he gives you a master and you can repeat the process.
---
To do 4 to 1 you gotta understand the attack cycles. The easiest thing for me is to attack on thumb and wait for crystals or lighting, then take 2 more attacks from olm. Then run to the head safespot to turn it which skips a basic attack, then run to the pinky which skips the next special. Then olm will hit you with a basic attack and an empty event, giving you time for the 4th hit. Then run back and repeat the whole process

The reason we don't have a defense prayer is bc piety is the defense prayer... They combined str def and att prayers for piety.

---
Your experts don't mean anything honestly. Just look at the kids of today. They are addicted to their screens from the day they were born. They are and will suffer the consequences of shitty parenting
---
This was so cute :3
---
I almost died to a sardomin wizard in that same spot once and luckily opened the bank and quickly got a few sharks to finish the fight. I was so happy with my pro-gamer move
---
I think you mean asceticism, in regards to religious ideas. Druidism is more founded in the principles of "being one with nature", or acting harmoniously with nature etc.
---
For example you could wear quite ornate and decorative Druidic costuming so long as the material is sourced naturally without "harming" nature. Whereas a religious person living minimally, is more closer to asceticism/minimalism.
---
Modern minimalism is a shit show of idiotology/faux principles.
---
Man i pray all is well ‚ù§ best of luck
---
I've never laughed so much at a thread. Brilliant
---
Hahaha touche mate. Thats an odd pet peeve to have
---
OF SHITTY PARENTING. That has nothing to do with screens. I'm literally telling you that over and over again. Also, I'm not responding again because you think experts who study something for their entire life, know less than some fuck knuckle (you) commenting on reddit. Maybe get an education and do something worthwhile with your life.
---
Comparatively yes.
---
Honestly i miss this. We have gotten so obsessed with the efficiency mentality that we treat it like a solo player game. Just go play Skyrim or something if that's what you want. When i was a kid we all used to troll eachother and it was great. Or competing to get the drop and getting it multiple times from the dude that called your mom a bad word. Good times.   
---
So yeah tl;dr this isn't a single player game. People aren't nice in real life either, so bad behaviour is like a core mechanic and challenge in all multiplayer games, be it Runescape or real life.
---
Adorable
---
Good bot
---
What? Lol
---
Depends on how quickly you could kill them
---
Reminds me of dominion tower endurance mode
---
Plugins make hard bosses or mobs accessible to worse players. Which means more people killing them, faster kills, and more of the item coming into the economy. The demonic gorilla one still does that, even if its by making the fight less tedious, its still going to cause more players to do it.
---
As for the bots at GE, what do you want them to do? Pay someone 50k a year to sit and ban dice bots? You ban one, another will show up within a minute, with absolutely zero human input required. 
---
These bots make enough money to fund themselves. Making accounts and emails can be automated. Its not a fight worth attempting.
---
&gt;If they hired a dedicated team that didn't focus on "content creation" 
---
they did, they're called i think 'head of influencer' and 'head of esports'
---
It was already polled and failed, however it was going to be limited to only 5 at once iirc
---
I've done 2k+ of them. :)
---
I'm right there with you man. My wife literally left me 2 weeks ago. I hope it gets better for you bro.
---
I just thought about it and Torvesta uses about 10 accounts each video so I'm 99.9% sure its okay.
---
71? Hahah 72 here dweeboid
---
My point was that it is like a minigame, and outside of pest control and barbarian assault, minigames don't give BiS gear and aren't played as much because of it. My second point is that dung is a minigame and we don't want more power creep - especially from a minigame. And thus it would fail as a minigame.
---
I'm sure you remember people paying groups to let them leach through and get the exp and rewards - just like barbarian assault. A skill should not be trained by paying somebody else to do the work for you (though you could argue runecraft essence runners or bone runners for prayer). And if they put in activity bars to fight leaching then it would be EVEN MORE of a minigame rather than a skill.

I hope you keep your red helmet! Best of luck bro
---
Nah, I just don't have time to sit on Reddit all day. You haven't put forth a single coherent thought up to this point. What is there for me to say? You want to complain about some formless system without clearly (or even accurately) identifying the problems and offering no solutions.
---
Salve and slayer helm dont stack.
---
Do they sell bills daily? No? That's what I thought.
---
If they sell it overtime, nothing much will happen. It's only when you do it rapidly, they take action. Their system gives a lot of leniency towards rwt.
---
Lol love the pokemon one

You did a beginner clue with 1 step. What did you  except? A twisted bow?

Good luck!

What's the point of plating runescape at all?
---
Well... I mean that's the point. It's a seasonal league. 
---
If you *dont* want to lose progress, just play the regular one, you know?
---
Maybe you should focus on the first thing I said. 
---
The key feature of this game mode is that you have to decide your playstyle. Relics will affect your playstyle both positively and negatively depending on what you want to do. Do we really want to take away the one thing that makes this game mode unique?
---
Pointless comment tbh
---
If you know you know
---
You should make a post about your reward loot
---
Well I aint playing it I'm just asking for others opinions on it and why they want to play it? No need for the 'dont like it don't play it comment is there? Another pointless comment
---
Fuck yo dead loved ones
---
Glad to hear the game helped you in time of need it helps a lot of people get through daily struggles. Wishing you a speedy recovery fellow scaper.
---
Goodluck mate! You still have some maxing to do.
---
I feel sorry for you. I would love to get shit for 5k kills without any drop.. rip.../s
---
1650 kc, a jar on 1446, no other uniques.. this bothers me
---
&gt; I‚Äôm sick of internet apologetics for the corrupt bourgeois class
---
This isn't apologia, this is explaining how things work and pointing out that the world isn't black and white as you would like to believe.
---
&gt;but overly complex and specific defenses that utilize one single example of worker interests running counter to the public interest does not justify the capitalist system
---
This is actually extremely straightforward, and there are many, *many* other examples to give. The teachers union protecting teachers from being fired for poor performance is rent-seeking behavior at its finest, for example. Is the teachers union a good thing for the public? Yes, absolutely. Does that mean everything it does is in the public good? Absolutely not.
---
The fun is the new experience and doing stuff differently I guess I was skeptical about it at the start but tbh it‚Äôs one of the most fun things I‚Äôve done on rs In Awhile Tbh
---
You win 2b and then lose it all. Makes everything else in game seem invalid
---
its only worth its weight in scales
---
It counts as a skilling pet for the task, so id assume they have changed it
---
The thing is that the inputs part is factually wrong, the rest of the strategy and whatever is a fine point but that is absolutely not what I'm talking about.
---
Reliably being able to do a 4-7 way switch into a barrage on the same tick is harder to do mechanically than anything in WoW PvP.  And even doing that isn't even close to being 'perfect' in RS pvp.
---
 WoW PvP was NEVER in ANY way about being able to click anything fast or accurately, it is about thought/strategy and there's nothing wrong with that but it's an entirely different type of skill.
---
Yes. 
---
There are multiple scammers, some 24/7. 
---
Its gambling. And there are thousands of players who are addicted to it. 
---
Some people will buy 20-30 mil in OSRS GP, then head straight to the duel arena and lose it all within minutes. 
---
Some (and many) people do not know when to quit and lose their will to play the game once they've lost everything. 
---
There is one player who is currently 50b-100b in debt... I didn't watch his last stream, so maybe it changed
---
Good luck man, hoping for a speedy recovery
---
Hmm what's different from just grabbing a regular ironman and doing that? I'm just tryna get to grips why it's so popular for a temporary game mode. What's so special on it I'm just confused on it all.

Check it out killer, osrs gp has real world value. People buy and sell in game currency. The duel arena allows you to bet at basically 50/50 odds to double the money you bet. Nearly no gambling in the world offers those odds. The duel arena is basically an unregulated online casino, sucking people with gambling addictions down a deep hole of debt.
---
The place is full of scammers as well, looking to get any edge they can in the fight.
---
People have lost tens of thousands in real world currency.

Those people are retards

---
Already said it ages ago. They don't care though and it's still not patched fully. This isn't even the only active exploit pumping in 10s of bills weekly.
---
I'm not saying that its impossible, you just have to hit your switches on time be fast and precise, having a mouse would give you an advantage in that. 
---
Its runescape, a computer game that has an app for mobile, not the other way around. Bossing and doing anything high risk on mobile is hard unless you're a god on mobile, goodluck lol.
---
You're just waiting too long. When he rears up, the bottom of his right-front foot (viewed from the front) is visible in a frame or two. You should already be hovering over the other prayer before he rears up, so the second you see which one it is you can click or not.
---
Nice!
---
Cheapest is loak larders.. Probably cost you like 15M and 15+hrs straight.
---
Can also do mahogany tables too which will cost you upwards of 35M but take 4ish hours instead.
---
Can just look at grand exchange prices and do the math.
---
Not to mention NPC Agro is absolutely annoying for anyone trying to solo pk
---
No "Grim Tales" requirement? I think the *only* quest in the game that makes you visit a cloud kingdom (if you can call it that) should be a predecessor! What do you think?
---
The highest debt he had was 117b, hes currently at 62b. But yes i'm pretty sure this will be out right banned hopefully soon just like commission staking.
---
That barely does anything. It‚Äôs still like 5 barrages 2 claws every freeze and you can‚Äôt do any counter attacks because by the time you find who is attacking you on a 20 man fall in your already getting dclawed by the next guy
---
Lol this is like something I would of made when I was 10.
---
Love the effort but so unrealistic.
---
a lot of high end pvm clans wont even consider pures but yea im sure you can find people
---
The way I see it is if you decided to quit tomorrow or the servers decided to shut down you could look at the time you spent as pointless or look back and enjoy the fun you had at the time, but on a smaller scale
---
This has been happening to me yesterday and today. Usually in the morning around 9am ET. Problem usually goes away after waiting about an hour though
---

Yea a pvp league would be cool and I'd probably play if it looked fun, but I was thinking like a pvm/skiller league with trading but no GE. I think ironman should be an option if it was pvm/skiller league and just have it give u bonus league points since it's more grindy. Then you could have league firsts for ironman and regular and it would be interesting to see the effects trading have on progression. I'm sure streamers would opt for the ironman in that case.
---
You got this üí™üí™ The whole community is behind you, go and win this fight üíôüíô
---
so if you dont mind investing some time, and you also want some magic and woodcutting XP, my personal favorite method is to sit at zeah mahogany trees and cut mahogany. you take some cash in your inventory and a rune pouch with plank make in it.
---
make mahogany planks to construct tables.
---
this saves you 50% cost assuming you also are a runecrafter while also netting a lot of useful xp
---
60-85 with this method assuming you craft your own runes only costs 21m
---
Wishing you all the best, king.
---
lmao well I suppose there's only so much you can learn from academic studies, you also gotta learn by doing
---
As a Mobile player only, I was forced to take the Mahogany Table route as any other method was completely unbearable. 
---
If I were you, just spend the 35mil'ish and you wont regret it for the simply QOL the pool, nexus and jewellery box offer.

What ever you decide to do. Good luck, the Construction grind can be mind numbingly intense.

I like the idea of prayer gear that‚Äôs similar to rune with defense and maybe +1 over proselyte but even that might be too much as the point of proselyte is it‚Äôs weaker than rune but good pray bonus.  Another bis prayer armor would make rune obsolete.

No...?

Have you added any items to the exceptions of shift click drops? From example some players that 3 tick barb fishing add their herb to exceptions so they can lock shift but not dropping the herb.
---
I want him soo bad! Nice job man!!!
---
I'm just saying you might feel motivated but when you arent a lucky little shit it makes people like me who had been slaving away for literally months trying to get drops and nothing comes of it feel the opposite of motivated. Made me realize I fundamentally disagree with how this game rewards its player base. This is why i quit the game.
---
Good luck bro

Why can't you play?
---
Good luck bro!

Exactly what i did and do not regret it. The worst part of that process was the minning sulpher part...

No offence but you‚Äôre coming across a tad salty. It might do yourself some good to unsubscribe from the OSRS sub so you don‚Äôt see the ‚Äòlucky shits‚Äô that get great loot. If you can‚Äôt bring yourself to be at least neutral about other people‚Äôs gaming experience you‚Äôre probably in the wrong game scene. 
---
Unless someone is cheating or actively removing chances away from other players unfairly they don‚Äôt really deserve the title of ‚Äòlucky shits‚Äô.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve quit the game over this but I‚Äôm glad you took action when you saw you weren‚Äôt having fun. I hope you find a game which has rewards which suit your expectations more than OSRS‚Äôs did :)

I don't disagree. I really would not mind a full map mode that is more orientated to filthy casuals and players with not as much play time available that isn't full on RS3. You know a sense of pride and accomplishment that isn't 8 hours a day for 6 months to a year to max.
---
I heard they got new flavors
---
Although personally I have been playing TL alot I think that would be massively unfair for people that missed or didn't like a type of league for the continuing leagues.
---
How did this go? any drops?

So, would I be able to contribute with farm and herblore
---
Amazing!

Right click and use your druid pouch on the ghast to make him visible, they then should agro you

The technique is the same for getting to 83 or 99 - mahogany tables for fastest, most expensive xp, oak larders/dungeon doors for middle of the road, and mythic cape mount for slower, cheaper xp. Run the numbers and ask yourself "would I spend X gold to save Y hours?"

You can tell who has been playing the game for years and who has just picked it up probably when mobile came out.

Seemed pretty obvious from the get go to me that Endless Endurance was a no brainer. ESPECIALLY in a game mode with no staminas. Also people haven't even broken it with regen bracelet yet. Regen bracelet + rapid heal + endless endurance, can no food basically any task.
---
There are some extremely horrible suggestions each day, but gladly very few of those are as bad as this one.
---
OK Trump.
---
Seriously, herblore is hard to get to 99, but it's not that hard to get staminas. Herblore was my 5th 80, and my btw has PLENTY of staminas.
---
That is sweet! Do you happen to have the STL file?
---
There was a fun video recently on "scamming scammers" that went into this. There are a lot of human blind spots and assumptions you can take advantage of. A careful and informed person can spot it... But humans don't live that way all the time

Getting 5x less xp than normal is extremely painful.
---
Cause you Brits are on another level. Guys celebrate with a gram of Molly on a weekend
---
It really seems like they boosted drop rates and didn‚Äôt tell anyone for TL.
---
They have a net profit margin of 50% tbf. Theres no doubt they‚Äôre underpaying their staff because they love the game. Not necessarily a bad thing.
---
You'll be in my thoughts. Good luck, friend!
---
It's even bald
---
Good luck bro, you got this
---
Is the drop rate of all rare items increased for TL? I see 10+ posts a day of people getting rangers or 3rd age in TL.
---
No, I think they mean unlock for that particular league.
---
Remember that if you feel pain then just eat and entire shark
---
Goodshit
---
Ohhhh my bad yeah I'm all for that then
---
I chose pray relic and here is why.
---
1) I don't plan on doing raids so the infinite running was not worth it compared to the other two. One of the first things I got was over 200 strange fruits to get 75 thieving and 50 energy pots to get 40 herb while losing no efficiency. I still have half of those supplies left and never gonna miss out on running.
---
 2) the auto bury has got me almost 75 prayer without lifting a finger and wasting time on actions. I will get 99 before TL ends which gives me almost another free 500 points.
---
3) I can afk while doing slayer without having to flick prayer constantly.
---
can get 200 stams/h killing bloat/maiden and cashing points out  so yeah, we stacked on stams lmao
---
you guys ever heard the [orchestral version?](https://youtu.be/PfvLF0S_nHw) sometimes i'll throw this one while playing rs lol
---
also sometimes when i'm not playing rs
---
I regret it atm, tbh.  It's not an unplayable level, it just feels like you've been scammed by going to a 2x xp stream or some shit when you pick prayer.  It's a little exacerbated by no prayer bonuses early game, but the part that's hurt the most is the questing/favour grinds.  Tithe farm is completely ass when walking, questing is bullocks without(although getting better with more teles), but the worst has to be walking back to slayer tasks atm.  
---
I feel that it's a tad obvious, but there could be some disclaimer about some being locked.
---
wait what? I feel as if im being trolled. could ya DM me some info here??
---
edit: not asking for HOW to do anything, just WHAT is happening haha
---
I mean, kinda ruins the region locked iron man thing that they're doing at least with this one
---
Yeah especially given that nobody even kills turoths minus maybe Ironmen who still need the sword. Should make it a more iconic monster, like an Abby demon. Make the emote your character ripping it's spine out for the whip lmao.
---
Should honestly be at least half stamina drain on agility cape.

He replies to pretty much anything if you ask him directly, I've asked him something like three times and got a response every time
---
Aerial fishing doesn't mesh great with courier either
---
You planted the seed a year ago though
---
Remember, no footlongs.
---
Super interesting - never gonna do it
---
Well, it's a lot of hard work
---
Yep, blowpipe and mith darts it is. I cba leveling smithing atm
---
Gratz man, that‚Äôs a brutal grind.
---
Once you get the t5 relic, the motivation to pick up all the random "easy" point tasks decreases by a lot, so it makes sense that it will plateau
---
I play the game atm for pvm and i cba smithing since its not pvm
---
Lol that was me with the 3 daxes. Without context I'm not sure this post will go anywhere.
---
Thank you dude. I did not understand truly until you mentioned the scaling.
---
This is a runelite feature, runelite was given the OK as being safe to use. It doesn‚Äôt highlight enemy clan members, it just highlights every single player.
---
Theres metal dragons in catacombs derp
---
Best of luck brother
---
Just afk NMZ to max melee and PvM to your heart's content. Game is tons of fun if make it fun.
---
I couldnt imagine doing Hydra without Kourend Elite diaries
---
If there were a lot of random I'd highly doubt they'd  finish with &gt;8k points

My comment history has a couple of recent posts that were removed/hidden that go into a little more detail.

Of course! Someone has to buy all that gp!

Good luck OP!

Back to rs3 with ya
---
The blue decreases, his hunger decreasing
---
Yeah that was normal for back in the day, was a big tag description to copy and paste off a forum or other vids, as RuneScape was in top 5 most searched back then
---
Just an older gen iPad, perfect for grinding
---
Also the barrages do decent damage if you‚Äôre on brews, you‚Äôll be chugging brews because the claws hit hard, then 3 barrages all hit high numbers, or a couple ballista hits can still easily do 30+ damage.
---
But also it is singles, you should be on a somewhat even playing field. If I can only use 100% of my spec bar, why should 6 players be able to use 100% spec on me??
---
Yeah he was there for a solid 2 hours at least, not moving at all, just fixing the wheel like a true hero
---
Surely!
---
No way
---
Dope now make a life size version for my yard
---
Ah shit, I thought there was no way to pay to get them cut lol, never thought to try talking to the squirrel

Just do normal tasks until you get it. It's not that rare

Shout out to all the sara guthix and bandos pages that get left on the ground every day
---
well sure but consider where he's at- hes doing lance grind. which means he very likely isnt doing bandos, corp, vorkath yet- zalcano is pretty much entirely dead content given it's hard outclassed by just buying gold ores- and mlm in general is super awful across the board as a training and resource method.
---
 so yeah, he'd just be sustaining his addy ore on random addy drops while slaying and stuff like eclectics- things that dont drop a sustainable amount of addy ore. thats my point.
---
He has a woodcutting bot that does it for him.
---
Dorics quest would be cool, or if you want a challenge; the knights swords!
---
Its comparable to infinity in osrs
---
Still pretty up there
---
shoutout tuscaloosa
---
Bwana means boss in Swahili y'all are just being racist.
---
Saves more than 3 months wasted getting it? I really doubt it
---
At first It felt bad losing progress on main game. But I had so much fun figuring things out that I don't even care now. I won't even care when this league is over and the next one starts and I start over again. It's just so refreshing to play because it's like being reintroduced to RuneScape for the first time again
---
Bizarre comparison redditor.
---
I'd get your range up as much as possible, really at least 80-85, to be able to do more dps. You can duo/trio bandos no problem if you've got a buddy to tank. I had similar stats but higher range when I started vorkath too which is decent money and an easy boss
---
A rollback can and has in the past created items which is a point I don't think you're grasping
---
Wow Only 4 years for an appeal what a good company
---
Didn't skychi die?
---
So stats, diaries, and maxing is a waste? Pvm is the only good thing? Some things will speed up your pvm experiences and make them easier, you just have to do the work beforehand. It would be more pointless to get the diary done after you completed hydra than if you did it before hydra
---
Because chances are the person taking the food knows the person is trying to juggle it and does not intend to let it despawn - but takes it anyway.
---
You know only konar can assign hydra right..?
---
Idk how into a PvP league I'd be tbh. WOD just kinda feel like dmm to me. They'd have to make it really unique
---
Was talking to Ash at RF with some other people and he made a joke about Harry Potter and the girl goes "Oh you like Harry Potter? I can be your Ginny if you want" and winked at him and without missing a beat Ash goes "oh sorry, I'm flattered but I'm working" 
---
Absolute chad
---
No wonder his wife left him
---
I'm just glad to have my account back honestly, it has a lot of sentimental value! I don't remember being so broke on RS3 though :')
---
isnt he being poisoned tho? so the green is the poison increasing
---
A Friend is born muhhHhH
---
Some people play the game for own reasons. I'd rather jump off a roof than do skilling right now so can i just enjoy my hydra? Thanks.
---
Fuck max efficiency
---
Bout 2/5-3 months now lol
---
Cheers!
---
Never said you couldnt use mithril darts, I said you could if you had to, but as an ironman most people are just willing to grind stats when it will better them in the long run. Have fun at hydra, and good luck
---
1500+ no visage
---
Idk why jagex doesn't make the account creation process more intensive or slightly change it every so often. Would absurdly break certain bot farms for a while
---
There‚Äôs absolutely zero way a mini server rollback happens spontaneously when servers DC or else this sub would be flooded with rollback posts during SDMM and other times of the year. Sure people would benefit and not post what happened but there‚Äôd also people who would be negatively affected and they would post and there‚Äôd be A LOT. Yet, here we are.
---
He gets his magnum dong hard and then whacks it against the tree with great force, it's painful but does the job quick.

Stealing artifacts requires it. And it's insane theiving xp. At 5x you can get around a mil per hour if you sweat.
---
Auto click while in surgery
---
Let's just slap a few bosses absolutely unconnected by lore together and call it content. Great idea.
---
/s
---
simple.
---
I used to bring an alt to mlm to fix the wheel when I was really grinding.
---
Where is it exactly/how do you get there?
---
Aye right there with ya
---
I had pretty good experiences in my encounters. Usually everyone sticks to one gangster.
---
Many activites in twisted league are overcrowded. Naturally with 600-1000 players on a smaller part of the map.
---
With the success of twisted league they should increase the amount of servers of this or next league.
---
Amazing keep it up
---
What will your HP lvl be when you‚Äôre done?

I'm a QA tester, so I'd probably be banished from Gielenor

Thank you :)

Bulwark helps if u wanna swap anguish out. Linked an optimal set up. I recommend 300 cballs per task, and 300 charges for craws bow. Reset after every task.

Boss drops allways intelligence and you can hop worlds check the board when each instance starts and then hop worlds when instances start. I got sometimes only 1-2 other guys fighting and even empty worlds
---
neither of them need to dress extravagantly in  order to convey their wealth. Everybody already knows theyre both rich as fuck
---
also suits are uncomfy, i dont get why someone would wear one outside of a formal setting anyway
---
Good luck tomorrow man! Speedy recovery, don‚Äôt waste the xp.
---
Did you check for namechanges in friends list?
---
Thank you :D
---
I got online on my phone, and while still online, i opened osrs on pc and it loaded :o solved my issue
---
Bahaha my kids could definitely be gp alts to fund me gear and stuff :P
---
That's true, but DHL is better than DHCB for raids in general, so if you need to choose between the two, I'd imagine DHL is better to take over DHCB.
---
Iban blast

Someone posted on reddit after launching a seed pod and getting tangleroot from it. They probably have you beat

Im relatively trim, 6‚Äô2‚Äù and the large is a slim fit. Good but definitely not loose.
---
URF on League of Legends is "popular", but Riot found that it actually caused players to not play the regular game. It's entirely possible we see a similar effect here.
---
I would say understanding the boss and having the proper equipment is most vital. Higher stats will definitely help, but the biggest thing for me was a trident such that I could use lunar spells for 'cure me' and veng. My first kill was around your stats, if just a bit higher, but with ibans and broads.
---
Why would you even tell someone that?
---
To gain points with Skilling methods, it's generally catch bats, cooking them, rock caking yourself, then eating the bats. You can get decent amount of points doing this.
---
Because honesty even when it hurts is better than a lie.
---
I hate you
---
This man been in the wildy for years and still got his hardcore status
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm in the Winchester having a nice cold pint and waiting for all this to blow over
---
Understanding bro, your stats are good enough for multi kill trips it comes down to RNG and practice with the boss so you take the least dog possible. You can 100% do it just get out there and try :)
---
If you want come into L0st Dynasty Cc I‚Äôm one of the leaders with almost 4300kc zulrah :)

No? Why do you say that

Hoping to have my urinary cathether fitted before christmas haha

he has 200m wc xp from tick manipulating teaks all day

5.5k 1 skelly, 2 jars, 1 necklace. My rng luck sucks.
---
I kind of agree with you, but I personally like grinding the clues out for those sweet sweet uniques. 
---
It takes up to 10 minutes to get hard clues done though, and waiting for the Sara spawn in the Lizardman Canyon is absolute aids because a lot of people don‚Äôt know what to do, and when you try to tell them they just say ‚Äúlol idc‚Äù and show up 5 minutes later to do the same damn clue.
---
you are feminine and delicate

Yeah I had a similar experience, it's nice because it relieves all anxiety and makes you not really care about the operation, then you just wake up

A server crash is different from a server DC. Server DC's do not cause rollbacks, but server crashes cause the server to lose its current state, which very obviously is not always going to be in sync with global state.
---
Server crashes do cause mini rollbacks
---
Just turn off ironman then lmao.
---
They only enabled it this time so there's no clanmanmode again.
---
A league where you're randomly placed into a team for the wilderness would be cool, but people could just make alts to join their friend's teams.
---
Thing is that this suggestion doesn't take out the part of getting the Sceptre Pieces, the idea is to simply allow for more teleports to be stored within the Sceptre by using the pieces you collect(ed).
---
So nothing about the current system changes, just the amount of Sceptre Pieces you can add to it (essentially just saving you some bank space).
---
So yeah, I don't see how this would be "massive boost".
---
I ordered a poster like 9 months ago and it never came
---
Exactly how it went. I remember getting carted to the room, moving gurneys, putting on the mask and boom I'm awake.

[Yup, came back October 14th according to GE graph](http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/Ranarr+seed/viewitem?obj=5295)

Nah lol. He's in the end-game though, so progress is slow. Afaik he's not a full-time content creator either,

Got 5 in the last 3% of the round, no one else representing NW gang. Felt really good.

Devalues my level 26 agility.

Jagex: oh shiet the bots have returned and evolved

I lost brain cells reading this post.

Con cape bruh

pvm

3163, 3478 position given away
---
Bahahah- REPORTED
---
Not the case on the main game.
---
Exactly my point, meta changed &amp; max mage was like 8m or whatever, now its 300m. And the problem is a dying pvp scene, not a dying wilderness... pvp was THRIVING in 2008-2011 there were so many teams even after removal of free trade (mid &amp; high craters were full of teams) and no1 cried about the teams. Its only a problem now because nobody pvps anymore, people just play ironman and camp vorkath/zulrah for money, the game doesnt have any decent updates for pvp, rs‚Äô best pkers even made ironmen and nolifed the shit out of it cus pvp is dead, its jagex‚Äô fault for sure, not the pkers. Maybe the wildy is hopeless, they should really come with something else, maybe seperate worlds where you can only use basic 07 gear, so u dont have op gears... idk but bitching about pkers isnt gonna make any changes to the retarded wilderness state
---
Blue bar goes from right to left so blue is decreasing as hp would
---
barrage them lmao

Its a f2p world I would tho lol

Soul m8s. Tell them ygw sent you.

Not sure where they went. They aren't there though.
---
Definitely can do it :) tons of pure clans do raids together all the time. I have 230 kc on my 13 def pure. Pure crew even has a member with dust and olm pet
---
You don‚Äôt deserve these downvotes, it‚Äôs actually a good idea. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt think Jagex shouldn‚Äôt do something just because ‚Äúit devalues my stam pots‚Äù.

Isnt there a youtuber that handcrafts and sells things like this?

You can squeeze a dragon thrown axe spec in between without extending the overall time.

Why not pay the 11 for a month then get bonds while  you are a member for the month

Doesn‚Äôt even make sense do you have to like the owner of something because you use it ?
---
Really? That‚Äôs confusing as fuck I feel like I see it so often I thought it was like a legit thing. I remember reading people saying something like ‚Äúreposted this time without my stats showing‚Äù lmao that‚Äôs some commitment to the meme

Get pked?

Death Note/Ryuk, lets get it

Eh I'd never waste my time with herb runs on a main account but to each his own.

Thinking your life means anything when you think having an ironman makes you a better person.

Oh, you're... sooooooooooooo cool /s
---
Thinking of you.
---
Hey join our cc, "flux cc" or "fluxcc" (at work, cant remember which one off the top of my head).  We have lots of members, active discord server, and we do all different kinds of content.
---
Inferno when
---
"w420 cc"  fairly chill, bit heavy on the bants at times but we're mostly good people :) 
---
Don't tell them the rcer sent you
---
I have a second monitor but I find it easier to watch videos and play in the same screen. I like to have all my focus  in a single spot
---
Agreed. The worst part for me is that even within Twisted League, I don't want to do any processing skills until I get the 2x exp relic at the end. Having them locked to a time period would be horrid
---
I usually avoid this situation by bringing the bootleg saradomin brews (wine+attack potions if meleeing, just wine if range/mage and taking damage). The "food" is so worthless I don't even care, but it heals pretty nice for generic slayer tasks and such. Most don't even want to touch it.
---
Thatd just be wilderness locked dmm wouldnt it?
---
Ah, the good old screenshot
---
Not even HC or IM? Weak bro.
---
It's because it'd be really sketchy if runelite did something like that. It never actively interacts with the game, it only reads and displays on the client side.
---
Making the game think your bank is full when it isn't would be closer to hacking
---
Equal to as much free time as I have that day.
---
Tells pkers that someone forgot a spade inside a tree
---
The exact same thing is happening with me, i can't enter anything runescape related, can't access osrs website or rs3 as well the same with the clients, this has been going on since friday after the last update and its still the same with me i tried several methods to fix it, but to no resolve yet.   
---
Most people tell me its from the ISP blocking the port and im going to go and talk to my provider tomorrow and see if that the case, but i doubt it is, because some of my friends that are on different ISP's have the problem and others don't.   
---
So if any one has a solution please let me know.
---
Thanks for the insight, this is great!
---
Isn't that the ginger kid in the rugrats?
---
Holy fuck you look like a massive loser in this thread lol
---
Thank you so much for the suggestion and kind words! Will do!
---
I think I know exactly who you‚Äôre thinking of. Didn‚Äôt he do rage videos when he died like destroying a computer? If so, then you‚Äôre thinking of NightmareRH.
---
Edit: he has a bunch of channels but before he quit YouTube he turned all of his channels into his main one.
---
soft pillow
---
Not bad but no amaylse crystals on top
---
When you think about it NightmareRH in his peak would have been a top streamer
---
I'm not raiding, only picked it for free points and the casual gear upgrade. It's been great.
---
LowTierGod
---
Graphics look the same
---
25m mining no pet bless ur soul
---
I've done it for a few level ups, and it was around 35k/hour at ~60 Smithing which is.. not great.
---
ZMI is still probably the best, other than combination runes. Rates will really start to rise in the 60s and 70s. You can also supplement with Diary lamps and Tears of Guthix
---
Well, quite plausible actually! He nibbles a ring around the outside of the tree, and since that is the part of the tree which carries nutrients to the upper level, the tree dies and falls down! (Eventually)
---
Wishing you the best, hoping for a speedy recovery then you can get back to cutting willows and catching lobs w the boys
---
This would be a good platform to add that debuff system from Dominion Tower, when you'd progress further and further it would disable worn inventory slots, buff monsters, trigger poison on your character(s) and etc.
---
Why people willingly drop items still is beyond me. 
---
Gg mate live and learn
---
Slow stomp magic, fast stomp range ezpz
---
I did a single easy clue and got a fuckin ham joint drop. Like okay, solid fashionscape, but at least on my regular Ironman I could have drop-traded to my main for the gp
---
This entire fucking game is a gigantic grind fuck off it doesn't make a difference if you're killing 10k dragons or cutting 10k logs it's about the same level of interacting.
---
why did you have to drop stuff and why would you drop your entire bank instead of, like, anything else?
---
This makes no sense.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize that you needed a house to get the exp for construction and nearly made it to 99 on T.L with no construction exp üôÉ
---
I think people have tweeted her about it in the past
---
50/50, they either like it or they don't
---
The hell are relics?
---
Yea man it literally ONLY happens on twisted worlds. and it's constant, I dc within 5 minutes usually. Not much I can do it seems
---
Wow! It is almost like you didn't read my comment where I said i came back after two years to fuck around. I know it must be hard though, that's a lot of words for you. Good job you're doing great!
---
While that's true, most overworld bosses are super campy, lacks intuitive mechanics or otherwise feel archaic, are all subject to outside griefers, and lack a group rewards system. Raids and the like manage to avoid all of these issues.
---
Runelite is also having issues, but they modified the client to bypass it temporarily.
---
it's like if every impling was a lucky and everyone was swampletics
---
surprised they let you use a phone in your cage.
---
If the guy had dinhs relic then he got three dragon axes. No need to keep three
---
me watching yet another streamer start another hcim
---
Hopefully they drop dt2 with a desert expansion then do leagues there
---
Ok calm down there prayer gang Peter.
---
Endurance gang
---
That plugin is not allowed by jagex so runelite removed it a long time ago.
---
He casts tele other
---
Why 80?
---
Thats part of the lure, you drop your expensive items in return for like, a lot more. I thought the lure was purely the teleport, so I tried to take the money, not use the teleport, and pick back up my items.  What happened instead was..well it didnt turn out well lol.
---
I believe he was not as popular as the rest
---
Good luck my man!
---
Jesus that's a lot.
---
Did you run full justicar as well?
---
Are there plans already for dt2?
---
NMZ dream state what ever bullshit lore explaination works really well.
---
They will be, otherwise it‚Äôs clan man mode.
---
They said its going to come eventually
---
Phenomenal job. But is she crying or addicted to meth?
---
Duels end in a draw after a few minutes

Right? No where near as bad as people make it out to be
