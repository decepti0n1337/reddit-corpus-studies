Is there a single skill that isn't boring to train? Inherently the meta of training is doing the most efficient thing until you either get the level you want or manage to get access to a more efficient method. Considering the time investment of skills, it's probably impossible to make a skill that isn't boring to train.

Quick vote yes sailing

Enjoying your time spent at your job.
---
Anyone have the og Gta one? one of my all time favs
---
It's fucking laughable that Jagex are talking about nerfs to the Bulwark and black d'hide in the name of bringing back the "good old days" of wilderness PvP, when shit like this exists.

You're completely disconnected from reality. No one is able to get 1k totals in 7 hours game time. Get a brain.

where is mod ash in this picture?

And you really ARE a tard.

votin no on this comment mfer

GP/H scape is exactly why I started an ironman.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the White Knights, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Kharid, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in monkey madness warfare and I'm the top skulltricker in the entire World 2 pvp community. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Glenior, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the wilderness and your run energy is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bronze knife (p+++). Not only am I extensively trained in knife combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Penguin Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit unstrung willow longbows all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo

All runelite+ does is make free a feature clans were getting for a fee.

You really don't know business... Businesses *always* need to aim to grow.  When a business stagnates, consumers and investors lose confidence in the business.  Then the business slowly dies over time.  Stagnation is *not* surviving, it is simply the time before dying.  That's the simplest way to explain it.
---
It really is sad that this is the top comment on the post.  Someone who has never known a thing about business in their entire life with a comment that looks good to a bunch of other people who don't know anything about business either.
---
Real glad you're having fun dude. Good luck out there in the members world!
---
Regardless, you don't have a BIS glove slot that's worth 130k.
---
Maybe, but he still can't log into either one.
---
Yum!
---
mobile games even have customer support.
---
Ya he was saying that he's had 100s of people try and no one succeed before... Haha
---
Yeah when I restarted it they tried to have me go to rs3, but the nostalgia of osrs got me lol
---
Combats, slayer, mining (vmine), wildy prayer (with friends), black chins (can be with a friend). I enjoy skilling when I can do it in a meaningful way with friends.

during monkey madness two i had to reject nieve

warding is... intricate..?

lol go away brainlet.

Breathtaking this is true art

Smooth brain post
---
yea slayer staff and rcb w broad bolts for skeletons and ahrim

The proof is in the pudding. I love that you can be open now fully Mat, cheers for the years of great leadership too!

BEST KOREA
---
Well seeing as they havent done it yet or even ever mentioned it the devs seem to think its a waste of time up to this point.
---
Did you care to finish reading my comment?
---
you're right, let's remove raids 1 and 2, kebos lowlands, and literally every update they've added thus far. that'll really spike those numbers up to get a victory Royale
---
Reminds me of a Hella long time ago some people made a server that was a first person shooter runescape server. It was crazy because you could see bugged out ceilings
---
I know but it was originally not going to be
---
Edit. The whole server was essentially only edgeville and the nearby wilderness area because of the modifications it took

Sweet samurai top homieeewe

---
lol my accounts almost at 15 year cape so i know alll about it.
---
Wow, I guess people really got to you today if you're posting this
---
Exactly. That's the most sensible and obvious view to take. Hence my jokey "hot take". Of *course* this game needs content to thrive and bring new players and keep existing. That's the same thing literally every game company knows, especially a subscription based MMO.
---
It's not hard to see that, all I was joking was that MatK wasn't sitting there saying "as an ex employee I have the scoop that if warding fails player numbers will plummet and the business side of Jagex will feel obligated to do MTX in some way shape or form to increase / maintain profits.
---
That's not how it works lol... website doesn't ask for auth, game does.
---
byw slayer staff auto casts crumble undead... kinda nice

I renamed my character to, "WARDING GOOD"

---
Insert I'm doing my part meme
---
Awesome response, thanks for taking your time to type all this up!
---
if people were leaving rs3 to play osrs, dont you think they'd want to avoid features similar to rs3?
---
Doesn’t change that it’s an unnecessary buff. Do you want to force more people out of the dead wilderness?  Because that is what will happen with this even more.
---
Buy limit at the grand exchange... Feathers, for example, are 13k.
---
I just got my 13k.
---
Am I unable to get any more from the GE until I don't have 13k on my person / bank or can I get 13k more in some number of hours?
---
Tbh I agree, the Wilderness outlived it's usefulness and doesn't really have a purpose in the game anymore. It's full of cheaters and people doing shady shit now that didn't exist in this capacity back in actual 2007scape.
---
... you mean the thing that's getting an entire overhaul based on player feedback that is being tested and received well by the community and has been the focus of the last 2 updates?
---
How am I proving your point by clearly showing PvP content being actively worked on literally right now????
---
Miss you Dad
---
i bet warding will allow you to do so
---
Welcome back young blood

Thanks bb:*

This is the first pole I've voted on, since voting for osrs.
---
Pedo
---
Chucked my bank today and lost. Before I did though, I voted no :P
---
Its once every 4 hours iirc. Might be 6
---
Just doing my best
---
The limit is buying X number every 4 hours.  So 4 hours from when you buy, you can get more, regardless of how many you have
---
I also voted no :P
---
Deal
---
It's a set amount of time, although I'm not 100% sure how much time that is. I want to say it resets once a day, but I could be wrong on that.
---
If you ever get burned out set yourself a long term goal. A specific one (Finishing Recipe for Disaster is a great one because it unlocks one of the best pieces of gear in the game for you). And if you get burned out dont be afraid to switch it up and try something youve never done. For example I just tried the minigame tithe farm on zeah and I actually rather enjoy it.
---
I do
---
Thanks.

RuneScape 4: VR
---
So go do CoX or ToB. There are already plenty of options for group endgame content. I for one am glad that we’re finally getting something like this to solo.
---
Likely some confirmation bias there as I haven't had to look far to see people saying both of these things. And it's by no means "many" people, it's often repeat offenders with very downvoted comments for the no-side and it's literally hit front page and rising multiple times for the yes side with posts along the lines of "if this poll fails we are unlikely to see a new skill ever again" or "guys Jagex is going to run betas to improve the skill so vote yes if you want changes to it not no or they'll never repoll it!" And within those posts are yes voters arguing that without warding now, we won't see a new skill which will result in drastic decline in players and a dead game.
---
I even saw some yes voter so boldly reply to me (and be upvoted for it) saying the game will be dead in 2 years if no new skill comes. And despite me showing him that player numbers have done nothing but gradually climb, with the only falloffs being after large spikes from big content updates and mobile, he still claimed I'm the idiot 
---
So idiots live on both sides and are just as idiotic as each other.
---
There is nothing the community has mutual feelings on
---
It would be best to start using unique passwords going forward, its just another layer of security and possibly would've prevented this. Gl on the rebuild.
---
Yeah. Youll have to wait till yr 99 str/mage if u dont start over. U dont need to be 99 everything but youll need 94 magic to use the strongest spells (ice barrage or veng) and 99 str to hit as high as possible. Otherwise youll be 40 str and theyll be 55 str so they can hit harder than you.
---
If you are paying at all you haven't got very far in game. I'm only a few months back and I'm able to make a bond a day without too much effort.
---
Believe it or not, the only skill I have actually ever enjoyed doing for long amounts of time was DG. My first ever 200m exp skill. The fact that the exp rates were high in both solo and team and was something you could play with others were amazing. Sadly everyone wants to play the game solo these days, we will never see DG in osrs.
---
how many gargoyles can I kill an hour on a slayer task with proselyte and bludgeon ? and how profitable is it right now ? should i bother with it or block/skip

To a conservatively minded player, Zeah is an opportunity to expand the game without affecting the "purity" of our original, 2007-scape continent.

Yes I think it had a 70 percent no vote

“Slightly chubbier” Americans are crazy, in Thailand that’s obese
---
what is the oversmite rule?
---
is it just the whole if your pray points go to 0 bc of the KO then your item stays?
---
I kinda feel the opposite way tbh. I don't like the aesthetic of most of the new areas, it feels out of place. The Forthos dungeon is one of the few updates that I think fits into the game aesthetically. Too many of the new areas have this neon blue vibe.
---
Your stats are fine for farming Vork with a blowpipe.
---
Furthermore:
---
!cmb shows your combat level and skills
---
!gc shows your barbarian assault high level gamble count (for pet)
---
!duels shows your win/loss/streak for duel arena
---
&gt;So idiots live on both sides and are just as idiotic as each other.
---
Agreed, lets just hope Warding comes out and it turns out to be great, or Warding fails and something else turn out to be great.
---
Can jagex state what options they gave him?
---
Stating the options wouldn't violate privacy concerns.
---
Delet this.
---
Spend 300m to not spend 30gp to get to karamaja
---
Criticism is allowed and is the only way a product will ever improve. If you essentially tell Jagex you're happy with the state of affairs, why would they try to fix it?
---
&gt;123
---
You got shit on lmao
---
Why you posting self portraits of yourself?
---
Wow
---
Whilst I agree that Jagex need better customer support do you not see how you are comparing apples to oranges in this situation? Jagex customers reach the millions and they need a lot more infrastructure and time to process a request. The only thing a bogla gold live chat operator does is post the same shit over and over again, they don't do investigations into accounts which are quite detailed. I hope this info would stop you from saying something so idiotic in the future.

"Humor"

MARSHALL MAE

I have no clue what his justifications are. I'm just confused as to why he felt the need to reply to me specifically to defend his no vote in a very bizarre manner.

Oh... but not a skill, and only for low levels... but yea - I guess that skill was poled before I came back

no just personal satisfaction / lore

Please do not ever let this man anywhere near root access to an enterprise database system.  Let's just say that any hypothetical company that allows anything resembling this has bigger problems than a client with issues logging in.

I was going to say something about these are the people that decide our future, without much prior knowledge. But then I remembered that 18 year olds can vote in real government elections, so I will refrain from being toxic.
---
2k and 2.2k is RoT, and you're pretty safe there. 1500 and 1750 is moi world. They're alright, but you still get attacked once in a while
---
Probably just learned that word and now overuse it on posts. Only someone who is less intelligent than the average human being would call someone on the internet that they do not know anything about a brainlet. What a child.
---
It serves as an item sink, a positive benefit to every player in game.

Ah yes, the classic a skill cannot be trained by doing anything fun arguement. Shame no other skills are primarily trained through minigames /s.
---
Wow you gave me the only reason I would ever vote for sailing that’s a genius idea
---
They are good for cash, not so great for exp (can't cannon or barrage them). I think most people will say they're worth doing
---
lmao, on my phone.
---
Yikes
---
I mean we are arguing about a proposed content change for a java-based fantasy mmorpg on an internet forum. I’d say we’re all a bit nerdy lol

Mod Ash already said it will be repolled at some point (but that voting no to Warding wouldn't make it sooner as there isn't anything designed for it yet).

"If the games stops growing you will start seeing a smaller dev team"

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't RD3's dev team larger than osrs?
---
How many points do you get on average?

You can buy a mith from Bob iirc? So maybe if it was rune it'd be a better solution.
---
Demonic gorillas. Otherwise Sara w/ verac method or Zammy with friends.

If you have the patience to do Vorkath with a low range level and subpar gear then go for it.

Well I’ve used an AHK script that repacked my left click to the mouse wheel and I can spin lock my mouse wheel..nothing but like 67m thieving do done with it..have never been banned. So I honestly don’t know why these people seem to think that a mouse would be consider “3rd party software” that’s just silly to me.
---
What in the actual fuck.
---
I wasn’t making an argument that it was positive or negative for the game. I was simply refuting the notion that if you “just don’t train it” it won’t affect you. 
---
I agree with you though, I think it would serve as a very valuable item sink!
---
i did some research and this thing is way bigger than jagex. u dont think rl+ thought of that alrady? comeon. . . . these guys seem like professionals at this. they obviously thoughtof that ahead of time. im sure the entire jagex office is completely infested with their codes and deobfuscators virus
---
Nice, it’s the only one I’m missing...

Found the guy that voted yes smh

Oh no, I have to get 60-70 in a buyable that will be 20-40h to 99...

I'll definitely try em out, wyrms and drakes are really really unenjoyable. kraken i'm also not huge fan of

Why did you do this

Averaging 18k to 22k points

Hopefully this isn't people just voting with their alts.

Yeah it's pretty obvious he has never tried to put on gloves after having damp hands

They stick to your hands so hard when they're only a little wet.

I like to just wet my hands down and the gloves slide on easily, but then the gloves feel weird.

If I try to put the xl gloves on with damp hands(as in I washed them then dried them off) I always end up ripping them

Ayy, just got skotzio pet on 1 KC.

Because 50% of people that play this game buy gold why do you think there’s so many bots

The main thing making wow a better deal is that for 15 bucks you get like 20 characters or something. Hell, God damn toontown let you have six characters for $15. In osrs you get one.
---
&gt;&gt; We probably will never get a new skill tbh. For the 10% of people or whatever it is that don’t want one anyways it’s great news I guess, but for the other 90% it’s pretty unfortunate.
---
You do realize that if 90% of people want something and only 10% don’t, it passes and gets put into the game, right?
---
Do a foot paddle and keep a steady pace

Its funny because I will never be able to afford/ earn any of those items anyways.

Lawl

So your vote has nothing to do with the warding skill itself?
---
Am I? He's barely done anything on RS in the last 3+ years since hitting 5.4 on RS3 and now he doesn't even care enough to gain access to his account.
---
Not exactly the actions of a man with a burning passion for playing the game.
---
Nice, now post the video of your celebratory shotgun
---
Not sure. But most people are right handed. So if they use a shield it will be on their left side meaning they would be better equipped to block a right handed flail user. So left handed flail is smarter if you aren't using a shield.

[They had a poll in February that were all repoll questions ](https://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results.ws?id=1552)
---
It's not clear how the sink will operate, but it will be some sort of a sink. 
---
Obviously it's an "item" sink but if those items are things that would normally be alched, then it's more of a gold sink than it is an item sink. If this is the case a gold sink is good because it keeps inflation at a better pace. It's good to add gp to the game, but the devs have been going wild with it recently so anything to slow down inflation I'm in favor of
---
If it's a real item sink where items that are not traditionally alched like Trident of the Sea then it helps to raise the value of the Trident of the Sea. This is "good" because items raise in value. It's really up to you whether or not you think that's a good thing.
---
It impacts everybody in the market, or in other words all non-irons.
---
Why would you use a text/string type as the primary key? It's better and more common to use an integer as the primary key.
---
New r/copypasta ?
---
Yes
---
Of it not passing.
---
It's kind of a bad idea to spend a lot of time and resources on something prior to it passing a poll
---
All good, hopefully it goes the way you want.
---
you're gonna say that to me and not the guy who says they keep user data in a txt file?
---
Nice
---
Is this some sort of puzzle or a test? I’m not qualified for something like this. I have a lot of questions. Why are random numbers blocked? Why the boots? Are we gonna get mounts?
---
Containment has been proven to not work time and time again.
---
It looked a bit awkward otherwise.
---
Dharok gives a strength boost proportional to the flat number of hp missing. If you were somehow a 10 hp account and used dharoks at 1/10 hp, you'd get a 9% boost. If you're max hp using it at 1/99, you get a 98% boost. Obsidian is just a straight up multiplier regardless of any other stats.

So just fuck the people that died as long as your anime is safe?

Could you explain alittle more? If possible im not seeing where your coming from that its broken?
---
Defeats the point of polling to begin with then huh?
---
You could consider making a Dharok PK account, personally it's  my favorite build to play , they are a ton of fun but it's also not a quick account to make.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 I suggest getting a minimum of 70 attack, 80 strength, 70 defense, and  70 prayer before you start DH pking. Of course, higher melee stats and  vengeance would be better, but that's the bare minimum if you want a  chance at getting any PKs.

The economic model can work better or worse in different contexts, you're insinuating hypocrisy where there is none because people are talking about different things.

Warding can be fitted into magic, crafting and/or runecrafting.                                                                                                                                            
---
Warding is just a disguise to get an item sink into the game.

Osrs already has 23 skills and tons of content.

Boss profit is not that great tbh, and i usually get a occult per task or every 2 task off the small ones. I use ice burst so barrage will be alot faster. 
---
Avg task is 20-30 min on small ones
---
As a casual player who pays for membership with bonds and doesnt have a high enough slayer level to earn those types of items anyways... i definitely don't benefit from those item prices increasing. It makes this game a lot harder and less fun when every good item is way to expensive. Don't mistake what is good for you as being good for everyone.
---
No!
---
Ew 60ish prayer
---
You can’t whip that Vork
---
It's good because it helps to make activities worthwhile. Why would anyone bother killing Abyssal Demons or Kraken if the drops aren't worth anything? Eventually you get to a point where there are very, very few things worth doing.
---
Additionally, money management is a big part of the game. My first bond the only thing I did was Motherload Mine in order to make enough money for another bond, plus half a mil. You require 75 Magic to use the Trident of the Seas. It costs 51k right now, and if it's used in Warding then let's say the price goes up to 250k. If you aren't able to afford 250k for T75 weapon then you need to be better with your money management. The beginning of the game isn't supposed to be easy. It's not particularly hard, but if they wanted you to be able to afford full rune right away they would lower the alch price so that it's driven down that way.
---
Also an Adament Set costs 19k right now and it's been there forever because Addy has never been worth anything. If you couldn't afford 19k it was kind of your fault.
---
The comment you decided to hit reply on in the first place literally said "Explain how you thinks it benefits everybody, please".
---
Seems pretty /r/gatekeeping to stupid people
---
The offer of doubling is bannable... they did the community a service overall.
---
Shit like this makes me so sad… my childhood sucked.
---
Yeah, you're right. You can buy a lot of the items I listed. That's irrelevant though because those skills aren't intended to be item sinks.
---
If you must train the skill to unlock the rewards (being that you can't trade them or otherwise), then you're incentivized to train the skill. It's not a large negative for the skills I listed - the average non-ironmen player wouldn't imagine creating every single potion or dueling ring they'd use, even if they had the skill level. It is a large negative if the skill is supposed to be an item sink. 
---
To have a proper item sink, you must have a proper incentive. Building an item-sink around a skill focused on mid-tier content and side-grade items is not the proper way to introduce an item sink.
---
Every P-mod mute is reviewed by Jagex, they can't just hit you with one because they feel like it.
---
You'll probably average 2 kills per trip so you'll be definitely be below 1.5-2m/hr. You can keep working your up in gear killing Vork to where you get 4-5 kills per trip and then when you're proficient you can get 6-8 per trip.
---
Aren't you fucking special
---
Yeah well almost every streamer out there has leaked their login email at least once, if someone could manage to give the same treatment to every streamer/youtuber that zezima is getting you would have 100’s of people permanently locked out of their accounts until jagex fixes this “issue”
---
This isnt griefers griefing, this is someone being able to target your account and lock you out of using it indefinitely and jagex doesnt have a solution for it.
---
Yay aquanites
---
I had some ground markers at Tithe farm from before the Hosidius graphical update. It looks like they left one Bologano plant where the farm used to be.
---
A skill is the number one way to sink massive amounts of money and items and still know it'll work because losers like me need dem gainz.
---
Literally a "money" skill where you just spend 2bil gp to get 99 and I'd still train it lol. Dissolving was my favourite part of warding and should have been more central imo.
---
Even had the balls to show his run energy..this guys living dangerously
---
Grinding fletching is always profitable, as is runecrafting once you get to nature runes.
---
Your in the wrong here dude. 
---
Nice attempt at a flex as well with the 200m worth of gear.
---
Probably absolute purists, it was truly 07scape back then and I bet there was a larger portion of the community then that wanted absolutely nothing to change.
---
How would you see it
---
How's that related?
---
I don't think I've ever voted yes to a poll question before.
---
Must fill a role in the broad terms of Combat, Gathering, Production, or Support
---
That's it. The support category, however, is a *very* broad term that is easily stretched. For example, Dungeoneering as a support skill was a big stretch. In it's base form, it was just an in-depth activity with amazing rewards, not a skill.
---
The community obviously doesn't want another combat skill, and I don't see room for another gathering skill. That leaves production (Warding) and support (Artisan, Sailing) as possible new skill categories
---
What slayer monster is even in the wilderness?
---
It was legit just a joke boss. Sorry that this offended you. Happy birthday btw. Hope it was a good one. Cheers.
---
99 is not even drop rate....
---
How long after a poll launches that the results are shown?
---
Looks like you were on your pc 🤦‍♂️
---
fuck yeah i'd love to get some action with him too
---
The image all iron men fear
---
Yeh if barbarian assault has one so should BH
---
How exactly do you justify punishing someone for a rule they never broke? Would you like to be muted or banned simply off perception? Probably not and it would prob piss you off like it is with me. Then facing a bunch of redditors who think they know me lol
---
I literally have the same exact stats as you and feel your struggle so much. It's such a weird awkward level where you feel you have good combat skills but its not high enough to boss and bring in the dough
---
Ali the Above
---
Not sure what this means but I haven't played since 2015/2016
---
So 15k people voted, on a game with over 100k players and that’s your assumption?
---
Most people don’t use reddit or twitter, so it’s a pretty bad assumption to have.
---
How do you get the gold? 
---
All else the same it should drive prices of uniques up but theoretically it should get your  gp/hr up because those uniques went up in value.
---
Like even dragon plate legs/skirts could go up.
---
Lol this sub never fails to bring the tin foil hard
---
From what I've read, all of it.
---
It's anatomically correct because frogs have 3 sets of eyelids. One transparent and two opaque, we can see the outermost one surrounding his eyes and the middle one covering them.
---
Dps claws if you have them, if not then gmaul or dds.
---
For free prayer restores ancient mace or sgs
---
Sorry you didn't like it, I gave it a go
---
I did that but I never got my membership. Pretty sure my dad just mailed some cash to Jagex and nothing else lol
---
Yeah, the NO RS3 REEEEEEEEEE neckbeards need to fuck off.
---
When you're teleblocked but slip away
---
No, runecrafting is infusing runic/rune altar magic into objects.
---
In Dream Mentor, you upgrade a dramen staff into a lunar staff by visiting the 4 elemental altars.
---
In What lies below, you bring an [ordinary metal wand](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Wand_(What_Lies_Below)) to the chaos altar to create an [infused wand](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Infused_wand).
---
And in the standard RC skills tabs, you can infuse tiaras with the talisman's energy at a rune altar, as well as the cerberus' crystals into your various boots.
---
link? i aint never seen that.
---
Haha you're to kind, thanks though :P
---
if you're terrible at making money then i wouldn't suggest levelling combat at nmz at all, at most you're spending time on something that could otherwise be used to make money lol
---
but whatever it doesn't really matter, you do you
---
do normal customizable rumbles for xp, hard customizable rumbles for points
---
melee gear is basically the best strength gear you can afford, defence or pray bonus doesn't matter because you're going to be using absorbs anyways. cheap-ish setup:
---
* fighter torso
---
* obsidian legs
---
* dragon boots
---
* ddef
---
* whip or d scim
---
* fury
---
* nezzy
---
don't suggest training ranged at nmz in general unless you want to afk, rates are awful and you're better off cannoning dags or tasks when you can, at least you'll be making profit. ideal setup:
---
* void (elite preferred)
---
* avas (vork version preferred)
---
* snakeskin boots (obv upgrade being rangers or pegs)
---
* fury (obv upgrade being anguish)
---
* msb (i) with rune or amythst arrows -- i think the xp/h difference between the two arrows is minimal so you probably want to go with rune
---
runecraft bad amirite
---
I felt like that for the first 2 months on my ironman and then the grinds started to get alot longer, quests were becoming way more and more of a chore, and overall things were getting extremely tedious.
---
That being said its alot of fun if you have the time to play that way but I really started to hit a wall where I felt like I just didn't have enough free time to accomplish anything which made it difficult for me to stay motivated.
---
Only errors I can find anywhere in relation to what you've said is people who used to play on the browser. Not really any reports of the client causing it but I'll have a bit more of a dig.
---
I'd suggest runelite from the .net site to see if that will load correctly, if it doesn't as well than it's definitely a bigger problem in regards to your computer rejecting a java connection, possibly due to a network error (I'm assuming you do a network connection) or maybe a firewall / antivirus.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
i just pkd 8 mill in f2p from a woodcutter in pvp world. Took me a whopping 10 minutes. Go to my profile post for proof. Pking is one of the best moneymakers in game.
---
Who
---
Just a guess but it could be something like an IP lock so he can only log in from a certain IP adress.
---
Would probably break mobile for him &amp; he'd be fucked if his IP changed.
---
Not a clue.
---
Handling. Taming and training wild animals to have at your house and ride if they are big enough.
---
True
---
You're giving money away in one of the only ways that will make those noobs trust the shadiest people on runescape. They'll lose their entire bank+ what you gave them trusting someone else in the future.
---
You're pretty stupid if you really can't think beyond 'hurrdurr I gib dem money's"
---
Rigour
---
It's a big fuckin' deal
---
my first introduction to pking was going into lms, getting stomped by some guy in rot in my first game and being told to sit
---
The issue is the introduction of a skill regardless of the content.
---
I know it does, I'm at 72 slayer with 75 for Atk, str and defend 93 combat. wo I'm looking for a "now" list
---
Good work buddy! You'll do great
---
he's still work shopping it, but he talks about it all the time on stream. Just kinda makes sense though, and feels like it'd really fit old school.
---
Somehow i don't think this is why he quit. But maybe it is idk.
---
Elena 100%
---
Solid mage/melee/range setups to do slayer/some bossing with
---
Trident of swamp/whip/blowpipe, a fury, and some standard armor for each type and supplies
---
This community pisses me the fuck off. Warding could be a legitimate benefit to the game but instead we got a bunch of autistic kids making the same meme, reworded or slightly altered. This game will never get new skills unless Jagex throws it in without a poll, in which case everyone on here would cry and somehow tie it into MTX.
---
How long is a piece of string
---
Going to assume 4-4.30 kill counts
---
so somewhere around 200k every ten minutes with banking and 1.2mil per hour
---
Now it can probably vary to be lower if extremely unlucky but i would guess close to 1.8 to 2 mil per hour
---
You did nothing wrong. The pmod is probably racist. Just report him.
---
Happens even at green dragons for some reason, not as often though
---
Lmao it’s already dead from pkers? I saw a man splashing on himself with his alt to keep pkers off on the release day. pretty smart I must say.
---
Thanks, yes enjoyed drawing that tbh, sure I'd love to redraw it some day
---
I have shiny's this one was just lucky with perfect stats
---
really? you'd say no to any skill? (not judging just curious)
---
I usually play later at night once I get to work.
---
Perfect.
---
Very low chance it's going to pass so just don't get your hopes up if you were looking forward to it. 
---
The community is pretty spilt down the middle on this one and 75% is required to pass. So just by using common sense it's safe to assume that isn't going to happen.
---
Yes? Go on twitch almost anytime and one of those will be the top stream. They bot view counts. Been going on for years
---
Try some of these fixes:
---
* Right click and go to properties and run the launcher in Compatibility mode.
---
* Go to System Control &gt; Region &gt; first tab (Format) and change the first option to English(UK). Launch the game and then can change settings back.
---
* The same above fix but to "Control Panel &gt; Clock and Region" If you can't find above
---
* Try moving the installer to a different drive if you have more than just C:/ on your PC and install from there.
---
That’s a fake channel.
---
The entire thing is a phish.
---
If items are BIS/efficient then they will not be cheap. For melee it's obby with the berserker necklace.
---
For ranged it's void with msb(i) and rune arrows. Although I wouldn't recommend ranging nmz until very high defense. Even at 90 def my sessions could only last a couple hours.
---
Also why NMZ specifically? I would personally say afk crabs till base 70's.
---
I definitely have been neutral about it the whole time, just curious
---
If I use a bond to change my name, does it reset the timer for my free name change?
---
I've pasted the invite link in this thread.
---
What happens if you have max cash in your inventory and try to withdraw more gp from your bank?
---
Yes, but better.
---
Happened to me today, guess who is back doing late night slayer
---
Hey its me poke
---
smart man!
---
This has no bearing on the analysis of the data whatsoever. A 20k+ sample size is beyond ideal for data analysis.
---
Even if it did, nobody can test that hypothesis. (What is a medium-level account? How does that influence whether they are pro- or anti-warding? Is there a statistical relationship between account level and social media usage? Engagement? Poll engagement?)
---
Nice try, though.
---
&gt; giving people the idea that someone saying they are doubling actually will, because you did. So then they will be scammed later. 
---
I'm not responsible for other peoples actions, nor should I be punished for them. 
---
Why would I not defend myself knowing I did nothing wrong? Should every level 3 skiller be banned because they MIGHT be bot? Pre-wildy ditch, should people doing drop parties be banned because they MIGHT lure them to the wild? No... your logic is retarded and is completely speculative with no proof at all.
---
Why is your only consideration that it "could be a benefit to the game" when it could also be a detriment to the game
---
Why not?
---
I've had this problem since last year. AFAIK, the issue is due to running Mesa which was compiled with LLVM 8. For me, this means Mesa 19 and up.
---
The only thing that has fixed it for me is running an older version of Mesa. I have a new Mesa release running on my system, but I also keep the old Mesa libraries around just for running runelite. It works okay this way, and I have a set of libraries and a short script to launch runelite. I've tried to help a few others with the same issue though, and they weren't able to get things working.
---
It really sucks when a regression hits and just never gets fixed, but sometimes you just have to work around it.
---
It doesn’t matter. It’s not gonna pass polls anyways.
---
Yup. They get shut down pretty quick, but always pop back up. Just be aware they exist
---
There’s a big hole on the wall to the right
---
;(
---
*bass boosted USSR anthem plays in background*
---
Same, i feel for you
---
Send $7.95, but don’t send coins....hmmm...
---
Yes pls
---
In real life when you close your eyes it’s as if your eyes are colored in eyelid color so I mean...
---
I want to finish the Kourend diary, I have a few things left but the main is complete one raid, I dont really have the best gear etc is there a clan/disc that FFAs the raid that I can just join?
---
Lance is significantly cheaper than DHCB
---
How does an item sink control inflation?
---
Many people are into that
---
50/50
---
reee I'm gonna lose my leaderboard position
---
It still is.  Costs 5m gp per month of membership during either of the two specials they do.
---
That's the best introduction you could hope for.
---
or they just don't find the skill interesting and would prefer to have the development time allocated somewhere else?
---
No disrespect but I don't know why everyone keeps jumping straight the crazy arguements made by the small retarded vocal minority and are applying them to everyone who voted no.
---
Clearly hasn't forgotten how to fashionscape, the absolute stud 😍😍😍
---
Out of curiosity, if you voted no for all those items, and they made it in anyway; how has this changed your opinion/enjoyment of the game?
---
Ehhhh I killed Vorkath with a Dragon Crossbow for a couple weeks until I could afford the DHCB. It's still crazy money but DHCB is another level of awesome when you finally get that.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
I don't think so at least not according to the internet.
---
Counterpoint: black demons are literally the worst task until demonic gorillas and should be #1 block.
---
The tasks are massive. They have considerable defence for a lower level. Tons of hp. Best drops are clues and maybe a few rune chains per task.
---
DC2 ELECTRICBOOGALOO
---
Reeee
---
Was mid whip-risk. GAGEX WTF
---
The poll closes on Thursday so we'll find out then
---
&gt;I was really looking forward to spending mils on bankstanding to make armours I'll never use.
---
Something makes me doubt that thought.
---
10 minutes later and it's down again, RIP hardcores
---
runescape just die for anyone?  im wasting agility exp here guys!
---
Why didn’t you join r/ironscape and it’s discord and cc?
---
yup, same here
---
r.i.p hardcores that were bossing, lol.
---
I mean, technically even someone a day younger than me can be considered a youngin?
---
Just an update the no is -7 and the two yes are -9 and -15.... so?
---
2 minutes yeah, wasted several with raid now gone. They can piss off
---
Logged for night for that reason lol
---
Join the We Do Raids discord
---
Whats your strategy? Avoiding pkers, gear, inventory etc
---
I'm completely for this idea. 
---
We already have sand casino so gambling already exists might as well do something cool with it that would actually bring the community together. This would blow up.
---
Let’s be real, this is the only reason they hid poll results.
---
i’d like to start up a smaller community, ironscape is massive &amp; it doesn’t allow clan promotion on the reddit.
---
Agreed. Applies 99% of the time.
---
Fury is also the best for tanking situations
---
Vork gp/h with bp &gt; zulrah gp/h with bp
---
The first part I do know. It's why bonds on rs3 are 20m compared to 4m on osrs. They have more gp in the economy so the gp is worth less. Things settled down a little bit with invention.
---
Barrows is for sure something I'm going to be trying soon, as well as Zulrah once I'm a bit stronger.
---
Any suggestions on what direction to take an alt monkey making account? I'm currently just leveling up WC
---
Ah I don't speak pker.
---
Yeah I think so, I also could have sworn it was more !
---
Your friend next week: "Wtf I got hacked, and my password is super secure"
---
A little social engineering and that order number could be enough to completely take ownership of that account
---
[the warding debate](https://youtu.be/aJX4ytfqw6k)
---
But battling wards were removed! /s
---
I think you might be in for a surprise, while the vocal are saying no, many do actually want a new skill. 
---
Reddit doesn’t control the voting.
---
But what if I’m maxed and I’ve got me a quest cape alongside all the pets but still just want to kill cows and collect flax? Is my knowledge good enough then?
---
People complain that the sub is too many RNG drops and stuff in the past. I actually like that content; it makes me want to play the game more and hope for some crazy shit like that to happen to me.
---
to actually answer your questions:
---
yes, you can use earth blast, you will just pay for it by using extra prayer potions
---
rune crossbow isn't bad, but you can only use it on Ahrim (the magic user)
---
for every other brother you should be using magic
---
melee should only be used in the tunnels to get your kill count up
---
p.s. kill all 6 brothers for the highest chance at getting an item, and you want your kill count to be at least 88% before searching the chest
---
Could someone help me with fight pit diary? Can’t get anyone in the cc :(
---
In other words, take them because they will have a shit score which gives you a higher chance to get mvp and get an item?
---
Oof. yeah, I just read your responses.
---
Clearly you haven't fucking learned, so you're probably not just stupid. You're an actual full blown retard. Never go full retard.
---
Enjoy your mute.
---
true, I forgot about the fury's defensive stats., I'll definitely keep the fury
---
What kind of effect do you think the warding skill cape would have? Like how the fm cape is a light source and the ranged cape is an Ava’s device etc
---
Tentacle bow
---
I don't know why I've just heard of it happening. Windows mouse keys is officially approved by jagex so there aren't any issues there. Any other third party program can be completely hit or miss for how it shows up to their bot detection.
---
:) more wholesome than pking my teammates :)
---
Yeah I don't disagree, I guess my point was more along the lines of this is literally the only game I play 90% of the time. It would be AWFUL if they raised it that much, but my dumb, addicted ass would still pay it.
---
Marshall :D
---
Why do they constantly add solo shit lol, it's a god damn mmorpg yet almost everything is solo or instanced, or both. This could've been perfect for group content
---
&gt; Maybe I am being too pedantic
---
You happen to be wrong, pedantic or not. They will be drawing Guthan's (set), not Guthan himself.
---
What are f keys
---
sorry dont have an alt still working on my main :)
---
ibanz blast is soo good for beginning barrows
---
same with ancient spell book
---
Yeah running no overheads got a very wide variety of reactions to say the least. Some were impressed, some annoyed, some told me to fuck off.
---
Its definitely an rng aspect, i even edited the cha ching noise to when i got the zuriel staff. T thrn get satius warhammer? It was over. I even got shaky at that point in my clicks because i knew that that was the run to win.
---
My thinking for this challenge was if i always hit them with whatever their overhead isint, and im always in tank for recieving hits, rng should be in my favor.
---
Actually, to my surprise, didint eat too many big dds specs, i always tried to throw tank on, freeze  back off. Or just eat and hope.
---
Man, if you think this way, stop playing rs lol
---
Let me do the same ______ x many times so i can finally unlocked the next thing to do ______ x many times
---
Thought the printer icon was a fucking crab. This sub has ruined me.
---
Does the voting of osrs count?
---
I'm with you just so people can band up together. It's nuts that some guy who does 20% of the damage can beat out 5 people working together that each did 16%. No coinshare, no lsp, just give it to whoever did the most in the group or to someone at random in the group.
---
Binomial probability calculations would put that at 1 in 403000 chance for 4 pets in that kc. 
---
Jeese
---
Yeah I already unlocked all that with the RFD pre-quests.
---
Haven't gotten a chance to use it. I'm currently too broke to upgrade my Iban staff lol
---
Which is mainly why i want to make an alt for some extra gold.
---
Why do you want to be able to note them?
---
Nice, except when it took me 4k kills :\\
---
But why? If your needing that many your just bad at pking.
---
luckily they earn money in exchange for their services
---
Just earned my yes vote ngl
---
I just feel like thematically Warding doesn't separate itself from Magic far enough.
---
Imagine fragmenting Magic into these different ideas: Enchanting, Alchemy, Teleportation, Necromancy, Elemental Affinity. They each, individually, come across more obvious and distinct than Warding does.
---
No you cannont
---
That sounds like a lot of big achievements that not even 1% of the player base has even gotten close to achieving, that takes THOUSANDS of hours to complete. That's a pretty obvious yes.
---
The fact that they're bots should tell you everything you need to know.
---
Considering all servers went down, I would say it’s more a telco issue than the company..
---
&gt; and looking him in-game
---
You should be careful with your own grammar if you want to criticize others.
---
i remember some dude finding some boats by clipping into the walls and a lot of people thought it confirmed sailing.
---
&gt;theres no indication of being able to dissolve any higher end gear, in all their examples its all "steel platebodies and robetopes"
---
Guess you didn't read the [poll blog](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/a/ab/Warding_Blog_%285%29.png)
---
God pages, elegant clothing, boss drops, hats &amp; masks, trimmed leather, trimmer armor, amulets, and so on.
---
Good luck because that account hasn’t existed for quite some time haha.
---
As for splashing yes its a game mechanic many people use/abuse and they figured atleast this way people can still splash it just wont be in major city areas for when new players are walking around the game etc... They were going to be out of the way locations to keep splashers out of sight
---
All clients should be banned and jagex should just implement runelites non cheating features
---
Yeah u definitely cant say the community made it heard
---
Problem is some people are using multiple accounts to influence votes. Not saying it never happened in the past polls, but people are definitely passionate about a new skill. 
---
On the brightside, Jagex raked in a ton of cash from bonds solely going into voting.
---
I mean the word is proven..
---
HeyJase is against it
---
Rather they make a good concept and it fails than they make shitty concepts.
---
Im not too peeved about dev-time, we aren't really lacking content imo.
---
Just alch yourself
---
You aren't exactly wrong but there has been no shortage of new content. That isn't a good reason to throw in every idea that pops in their heads. RS died off because it changed so much. Sometimes it seems like the same thing is happening here. I think we'd all be surprised how long people would still play this without any new skills or other large changes.
---
Why are godbooks popular with pkers? Dont you have to refill it on death? With new pages. I figure thats kinda expensive
---
You do realize that there are shops in the game, right? And NPCs who sell items? And armor to be repaired with GP? Part of the challenge of IM is earning that gold yourself on that account.
---
A fucking what
---
I loved the idea of it but not being able to advance far because I had sweaty safe spot pkers just put me off it
---
If 75% of the players want it rest would just be vocal minority of Reddit
---
A guide wouldnt hurt, so that you could know how you want to go abouts your training there. There are ways to get really decent combat xp there but i think it may reduce how many points you get and vice versa. Theres 2 main ways i usually go in and thats with prayer armour and a bunch of prayer pots and just pick only melee attacking bosses and have protect from melee on the whole time. The other method is wear some heavy hitting shit, (a lot of people like dharok because the full set bonus allows you to hit harder with lower hp) then drink a sip of an overload potion you can get from the minigame, this will boost your combat stats but take away 50hp until the potion wears off 5 minutes later. Once at 50 hp eat or guzzle your dwarven rock cake obtained at some point during rfd to bring your hp to 1. Then drink a bunch of absorption potions(also obtained from nmz aswell) and sit back and enjoy. Absorption pots give you a sort of shield kinda. They give a 50 hp shield per dose that the bosses will bring down to 0 first before touching your actual health. The trick behind this whole situation is since you brought your own health down to 1, the game registers you having 1 hp, even though you may have 1000shield from absorptions. Since your hp is only 1 the bosses can only technically hit you for 1 damage, which means they only hit the absorption potion for 1 damage out of the 50 per dose. If you didnt do the over load method they would be hitting hard and your absorb would run out quickly but its sort of a broken mechanic that people love to abuse. If you didnt already put 2 and 2 together, the dharok works great because of the earlier mentioned bonus given, that allows you to hit like a monster truck since you technically have low hp.

My bad for the long post, im laying in bed trying to sleep but tomorrows my first day at a new job and im kind of nervous!
---
There aren't enough players to warrant it, for 1v1's sure, but 24 is too many.
---
Voting no in a game you don't play anymore isn't "doing your part", bit of a dick move tbh
---
People voting yes - voting out of spite of neckbeards / will vote yes for any new content
---
People voting no - just dont want a new skill.
---
Damn since when lol, I did mine yesterday ago free
---
Fletch your wrists

I gotta wonder, why rune skimmy and no d long? D-long is a big upgrade on rune skim and it was released already.

😣👌💦💦
---
Any half decent PvMers could adapt to PKing somewhat quickly, most of these people haven't done anything harder than trio bandos, calling them PvMers is a bit of a stretch.
---
29rc as f2p? Ruff
---
Don't cross the road today
---
I think the percentage should have changed when Blind Polls were added. 
---
Too many people rely on bandwagoning to make decisions. 
---
Sorta like Brexit where people don't understand what voting Yes or No really means but does it anyway because everyone else did.
---
So there will be many more uninformed individuals just voting for sake of voting.  Thus making the Majority of votes much more difficult to get I believe.

Ahhh that shit show lmao. Well thats not really much of a need to imagine it, i see a decent shit show about it just scrolling through new haha. So many of the posts just seem to end in arguments or stating the exact same facts and opinions as the one before, I just sort of misunderstood what op was going for! I do kinda hope it passes since they said they would let us beta test it somehow first! I fee like this is more than reasonable as long as if we truly dont like it, jag understands and removes it as opposed to trying to implement it awkwardly some other way
---
Rc bad.
---
I appreciate the long post! How much does Dharoks cost roughly? That actually sounds like a decent amount of fun. 
---
Good luck at your new job man! Mind if I ask about it? Sometimes helps me get to sleep once I talk about what’s on my mind.

Someone feel free to correct me but pretty sure braver drop rate is 20-30m xp.
---
OP if you stand in the GE and say:
---
"ROLLSCAPE 100K min || 10 mill MAX WIN"
---
People will give you free money.
---
Here's a thought.
---
There are hardcore players who have cash stacks lying around of 500m+. With bonds, that's easily 100 accounts which isnt a lot of players. But if 1 person does it, it could mean the difference between a pass or a fail.
---
Out of 100,000 players, it would only require 10 people doing this to sway a 1% vote.
---
We don't have much to go on to make that call, what kind of mmo are you looking for? All I can really say is make an account and play through tutorial island on each, then decide.

Wyrms have been good to me. I usually get 800k-1.2m+ per task. Maybe that’s not a lot to some people. As far as Kraken goes, in 1500 KC I’ve gotten over 15 tridents/tentacles and a jar. One of my favorite demi-bosses
---
In f2p you'll get beginner clue scrolls sometimes, most likely from killing things, rarely from mining/fishing/woodcutting. If you complete them sometimes the loot will be rubbish but sometimes it will be cool stuff worth a decent amount, like gold-trimmed monk robes
---
not not every skill their is a list which skills and bosses and monsters (chopmy and stuff) drop a pet. (cleu scroll got also 1 pet. )
---
And then someone tells you that they enjoy Runescape 3 because it is the superior Runescape and we're all afraid of change.

Sometimes some people enjoy things but those people are wrong. /s

It's ok it has three items. It can't hurt you.

In the same amount of chests I have gotten zero uniques. You have good luck.

Just bought back a fury today. It’s definitely useful and worth to keep around. If you can make enough money for torture + anguish I don’t think the 2.7M for a fury with hurt at all.

I’d rather wait for 15 mins for a game with people of a similar skill than have an instant game filled with seasoned pkers. But you are right there aren’t enough players to warrant it

What are your thoughts on the possibility that the majority of these votes are actually players with alt accounts? Would you be willing to release any information on the influx of membership subscriptions/bond purchases during the time period of this poll?

Gotta say I'm hella impressed with the hand motions actually matching the tunes.
---
I agree, I don't see when you would choose for RS3. Not hating because I play OSRS, but honestly, if you find RS3 appealing, there's probably a lot more better offerings out there. If you want to old-school (ha ha), grindy, MUD-type MMO, OSRS is here for you.
---
Mate, thank you for putting that so eloquently. I've tried to make the point several times that these kind of memes do eventually stoke legitimate hatred for PKers. It can be so easily seen in the more popular posts about PKing.
---
It reminds me so much of the shift on 4chan from ironic edgy racism to actual racist thinking they've found their home and completely changing the tone and intention.
---
Some, if not a lot of people don't realize these are meant to be jokes ans honestly believe they're justified in their hatred for people playing an intentionally designed part of the game.
---
i see. i feel like once i get mory hard diary done, i’ll have good enough stats. i think the 70 prayer will be huge. it’ll make me never/ barely ever use prayer pots during my runs.

To be honest and i don't want to provoce anyone here but is there really any reason not to be a member?, unless you can't afford the bonds or pay for membership that is which is fine and understandable.

---
There is, it’s not particularly helpful in my honest opinion, there’s nothing that tells you exactly what to pray, only what monsters are in the wave and which ticks and order they will attack. You’d still have to learn the core mechanics if you want to successfully do it

Get a torture you’d still have coin for a Barrows gloves to ferocious upgrade.

Well, you learn how to cook TWO DIFFERENT things. That's one whole thing more that they know how to do.

---
yupp

Yea a bit more I think
---
This has been the case for years.
---
Is that fucking Roshi?
---
Yes i agree to some level. It's easy to point out what is the problem but comming up with a solution is the hard part.
---
Well in order to skull as a player it's something you deliberately opt into. You are the person that clicks attack on the other player. If you click to attack another player and skull there is nothing Jagex can do to help you. It's that simple honestly. They've even added a 
---
hide attack option to deter getting skull tricked. 
---
Luring/scamming is also something you opt into but it's not the same. If someone says doubling gp and you give them gp then you've been scammed and that's your fault. There's many lures that exist so I can't break them all down for you but they usually rely on using spells like vengeance to stall your animation in a pvp world. The lurer casts vengeance in safe area then clicks into a non safe area then trades another player. Since there is a stall on the vengeance animation the other player clicks trade and get moved in to an unsafe area and gets attacked for their items. Jagex has removed the stall on the vengeance animation so this should no longer be happening. 
---
There is a clear difference between skull tricking and scamming/luring. If you can't see the difference idk what else to tell you. I do have some bias in this because I pk daily and have skull tricked millions myself but like I've said it's easily avoidable. It only requires basic game knowledge.
---
Used to be able to smite overkill damage, now you can only be annoyed for a percentage of your hp when you were attacked
---
yup full obby 1hp absorb and supercombat or overload (afk hard or medium) with a gmaul and rock cake or locator orb (if done ds2) there are about 10 monsters that are good for it for example; the kendall count draynor king roald skeleton hellhound moss giant
---
at about 93hp u can switch to dharok
---
Ayo
---
Dude that's brutal. Not everyone has the time to almost max every skill.
---
I saw him login yesterday for about 2 minutes.
---
Usually when you click, you think it is the person who skulled on you, or are otherwise misinformed, if there was something that warned you that you would skull on click, that would be different.
---
Again, hiding the attack option makes fighting back nigh impossible.
---
All you did was explain a stall...how does that prove anything? The point is the fraud. Someone thinks they are doing one thing, when they are doing another.
---
Like hell, look at that torvesta video, he lets someone kill him, then logs in on the loot pile, thats fucking stupid. 
---
"Millions" I kinda doubt that, but no matter how many you have done, it is a complete dick move and you know it.
---
" It only requires basic game knowledge."
---
Ah yes, basic knowledge like 
---
"Right click every npc you fight, have all your attack options off and have autoretaliate off"
---
or   
---
"Don't click on a loot pile" /s
---
I can't be against Warding if all my votes were "Yes".
---
THIS
---
yes it does
---
@op, turn off low detail mode for the roofs to be visible
---
yea its real nice 50% extra runes means that u domt rely on item drops as much and normal chests get u good cash
---
I agree, back in the day it was a race to get your items back when you died.
---
I remember in 2009 I spent months botting red chins and accumulated 100m (not advocating botting btw)  and 28m hunter exp. When one day I was sick and didnt go to school so I thought 'you know what' im gonna spend this money and buy red chins and the gear I'll need and try max my pure. 
---
So the first place I went was to ape atoll to buy my dragon scim from the shop (yes I could've bought it from the ge but.. I didnt) and stupidly equipped it which in turn switched my monkey comrades into hell fire arrow shooting bastards.
---
I had the 100m on me and couldn't get back in time to get ANY of my stuff. 
---
This old mechanic should make a return
---
I think it's sell 50 for a reason, maybe to slow bots down or something, or maybe it's just outdated lmao
---
Valid points. Do you have any solutions or ideas? I'm not much of pker but I watch the big ones on YouTube
---
have there ever been a higher voting count =o?
---
I mean they did only bring in hiding results when MTX came so they only started now because they are polling shitty things
---
Reasons I've seen others mention:
---
* "keep old school old school"
---
* Boring money sink
---
* Content can be added to other existing skills
---
Personally, I don't care where the content is added, but there needs to be more viability when it comes to getting magic gear. You either buy gear from the GE, be forced to go to Zeah for level 20 mage gear (Xerics), or do nothing until you get *lucky* enough to get some magic gear past level 1 wizard robes.

where do you people get the idea that most people didn't read the blog?

It's really infuriating and feels like there is a lot less usable space on an already small screen, even though I have a OnePlus 5t with a 6" screen
---
Because then it never would have a chance of passinv the poll.
---
Almost upvote but the irl ruined it.
---
Here's some advice. Go down to the local hardware depo and see if they have any stepladders. Go home and set it up. Then get over yourself.
---
Are you doing it properly?
---
With that I mean having the one-button mouse thingy enabled and position the items at the bottom. Then you can just spam click the same location.
---
When done right you should be done in a few seconds/minutes.
---
Same on Mate 20 Pro
---
Oh, I hope they could bring it back. Right now I would maybe even prefer if the edges were blacked out, so you would know where not to click
---
COX in myass isnt even a good username. Why did you even post this? No one cares lol
---
Not OP, but for me it was because of the powercreep, not because of keeping the game "oldschool". New content needs to be made to keep the game relevant, but the powercreep is a problem too.
---
Started an ironman as well, fixed my problems with powercreep, at least most of it.
---
I won't. But you can quit now. Bye.
---
They talked about this a long time ago but their views may have changed by now as the game has changed alot at this point. 
---
Their stance was that they didn't want to 
---
1. fuck up the economy 
---
2. make old armor the new meta when their is already higher level gear and challenges
---
They essentially said they just felt more comfortable making new gear all together.
---
It's actually just running down the entire length of his leg

The good old days, if only it was that easy my man last month I decided to purge my friends list from 2004-present because it was full and always dead :(

---
Can confirm, already do this on stock Android
---
Pretty sure it was mentioned in a Q&amp;A that this was done due to some phones having a notch

Requires engine work fix etc..

Voted no on my 250+ account farm hopefully makes a small dent
---
Yo I get it he said warding bad ironically to say that warding good! Wheres my pat on the back I'm proud to be a part of the reddit circlejerk
---
Hey buddy you can just get another Spade on the GE it's ok.
---
That's true, I see primarily low level pures in BH worlds.. I guess PVP it is for anyone over lv 75.
---
Ever since they removed the chance of killing your target for an emblem without firstly having an emblem was when it started getting shitty IMO.
---
Like 150m for 2 weeks iirc
---
Whe I can back when osrs lauched someone had hacked my account and been bottling  onnt since 2007 when I quit, I had to get it unbanned when the servers lauched but logged into rs3 first and they also cleared out my friends list so I can’t find anyone at all :(
---
New skill is most requested update
---
No shit but as a community driven game shouldn’t we decide what consumes developer time and what doesn’t? Absolutely no one suggested Warding except Jagex and now look how close it is to being in the game. I trust the real scapers to vote no. Idc about downvotes at this point, been in this sub longer than 99% of you.
---
There was someone who posted about being hacked after using it. There's a reason why no one with a brain is using RL+. The creators are straight up baiting players with OP plugins to use it, just so they can get hacked. Don't use RL+.
---
Don’t even have it on my phone and I checked, are we smoth brans?
---
But that already exists on most keyboards lol.
---
Google keyboard does it and I'm pretty sure the default iPhone one has the option too unless it's disabled by the game itself.
---
I think he has a different idea of growing thinking that growth is purely profit driven, when in reality revenue is more important and not understanding the difference.

Only alive bracket is 50-60 probably. And that’s the pure rng pk bracket haha. Can be fun but it’s just based on rng most of the time

You’re not wrong, but definitely don’t go too heavy on the deadlift. In high school I weighed 125 pounds. On max day I set a new pb for deadlift at 355 pounds and let me tell you, my back has never forgiven me.
---
You think it's the gpu plugin? Have you tried disabling it?
---
New gear is great, but old gear is iconic. And there is nothing as particularly iconic as Barrows if we are thinking "OldSchool."
---
I'm not opposed to any new gears, but it does frustrate me to see them be knowledgeably useless and for the developers to admit that they regret making them that way at launch, and then for the developers to do no work to try and remedy the issue. They've spoken about it, but it seems to have never left a Q&amp;A.
---
I'm not interested in making old armor the new meta--in fact, the meta now is so brazenly powerful there there isn't much I can do past Twisted Bow, Toxic Blowpipe, Rapier, Dragon Claws, etc, to make any of these sets more favorable than what already exists. I just want them to actually be useful--not necessarily meta.
---
Konar or wilderness slayer, probs better doing wilderness seen as it’s completely fucking dead
---
Awesome! Never would have thought of this. Hopefully I dont need to be on task.
---
Is slayer an efficient way to train magic when the right task comes up? I'm not looking to do magic for a week straight but slowly getting some exp through slayer seems saweeeet. Thanks mate!
---
100 % this. Only thing what you aim for at high lvl is the 99
---
It turns out if you dip out on OSRS for Shadowbringers, you can watch the drama unfold at a distance.
---
I just got my first zenyte on my ironman at 90kc!!
---
Honestly, the Invention item sink in RS3 had a very good impact on the market.
---
Shit items actually started having value again.
---
Wasn't it a mage atk after the 1 hit anyways &gt;.&gt;
---
Hatred for pkers was legitimate long before these memes.
---
Until you realize that if noobs are incapable of figuring out that they should probably just go ahead and kill shit for stuff and xp, they won't figure out how to talk to an npc and do a job to go ahead and do shit for stuff and xp.
---
Was it not multi combat on release?
---
 90%? I think you forgot just how small f2p is
---
All it means is people will go back to 3 iteming.
---
It wouldn't really improve anything, it would just be tedious. People seem to think that people would go with the gear they do now, but it's just not the case. Having things be lost on death won't sink items out of the economy, because people just won't bring them in the first place.
---
Plus, unless untradables were still kept, it would kill all of them dead. People wouldn't use any high time sink untradable or high skill untradable for risk of loss. 
---
If you were to keep untradables as you do now, you would just end up with people stacking untradables and 3 items.
---
A situation where players are actively not using their items is, by nature, bad design.
---
The only legitimate alternative would be people keeping everything on a death, but having a gold penalty to reclaim. Similar to how boss reclaimers work now, though make it scale based on high alch value of items and don't have it be lost on a second death.
---
I don't mind AFK things like woodcutting as it doesn't require much attention, but RC as a whole requires attention AND is slow at the same time, so it's bit... demotivating.  
---
I've not made fires in a line for a long time, Wintertodt is great.  
---
Agility... Yeah, is annoying, but fast xp since I have high enough agility + hard diary for teleport, so an hour a day or so isn't too much and good xp.
---
It's not +93 ranged defence, it's +62 because chaps still give 31. 
---
It's not +28 mage defence, it's +32 because tassets give -4.
---
It's not +17 ranged attack, it's +24 because tassets give -7.
---
I have tried both for roughly 1k kills and my strategy after a melee phase is to pray range and flick augury for the first hit. It may or may not be better theoretically (I wouldn't know how to do the maths), but it has definitely yielded more kills p/h over roughly 1k kills for me. 
---
Range/mage/defence levels also matters here. With a lower range or defence level the accuracy boost and range pray will be more helpful. But with a lower mage level it may be better to pray range and then tassets could become better.
---
&gt;	Do you not understand my post or something
---
No you don’t understand mine. Spite voting and making skills complete with each other is what got us here. So your post is only continuing to propagate that. If they polled six skills in a single polls none would get 75%. If you polled “adding a skill regardless of %, highest wins” that poll would always fail.
---
&gt;	No skill will ever pass ever under the current system
---
Probably but you can’t say that with absolute certainty. Hell for all we know warding is passing atm.
---
base 70s and hard diarys
---
&gt; but RC as a whole requires attention AND is slow at the same time
---
changes as you reach lv 77, it becomes almost as afk as WC
---
This made me lol out loud. Smh my head.
---

---
Doesnt mean anything can be done though.. Mind iff the have to change your name again because its offensive they could change it themselves and lock it for a year as ponyloveruwu for example. I've had some friends that had this happen to them.
---
Quest cape and diaries is where you can never go wrong
---
Arclight for demonics/sire/Zammy
---
&gt; "only allow one account to vote from an IP"
---
But then it would've passed with even more than 75%
---
Can nothing but agree on what you said, Tit EA Surfer.
---
When do you need to type on runescape?
---
They're borderline junk.  Do whatever you want.

I have no idea what those requirements are, where can I check?

i recently did 60 to 77 in under a week doing astrals, i don't like lavas or zmi and astrals is really chill once you get it down, with netflix on the side it was easy

uTorrent

especially as ironman, I'd rather get 60 woodcutting with mithril axe and buy rune axe than fucking mine tin and copper
---
I voted no on 27 alts

You cannot have them noted.

No you have to build the first one and then the second one. You'll have to make 2 trips to fit all that

Thank you for this, this new chair height just feels so good.

You'd have been kicked from "Ironman Cc" because a ranked member would have joined. There's also their other chat "ironmancc" (no space like the first one)

Probably because it’s a repost

Is it viable to use only melee and ranged? Would be more simple.
---
What frustrates me is there is 200+ member worlds and can only hop 15 in five minutes, spend more time hopping than fighting while deep, and I avoid pvp worlds ect due to how much I hate dragon knives, msb was a way more fun meta
---
What's a matter kid? Never been in the zone before? Never zoned so hard you can feel the mechanical switch slide down and actuate as you left and right click in long 1-2 minute intervals repeating the same task over and over? Never zoned so fucking hard you can hear your blood pumping in your ears, taste the air, feel the slightest movement of a fly buzz past your face as you unblinkingly perform a rhythmic dance between man, machine and rune. Have you never zoned so absolutely fucking hard time feels like it has stopped, every pore on your body seemingly under your control, every molecule of your existence in perfect harmony with the singular goal of running tick perfect laps for 16 hours straight where at the end you truly know what it's like to transcend the human form into the next plain of being.

Yeah kid RuneCrafting is not for you, go back to Wintertodt while you watch The Office for the 17th time. Your entire existence is a mere blink to me.
---
That’s a child!
---
Pking is fun waste of time, not a money making method, but ok.

What if it's the normal runelite client not premium?

“Most people wanted a new skill”. Source?

if you hear about the other fcs by seeing them spamming in lumby/ge/in game at all. they're scamming.
---
Honestly might be bannable. I'd try a small amount and see.
---
They're overpowered only against noobs and mid level mains.

I'm really curious to check out that private server. Do you mind private messaging name?

I doubt they gave a mute for it.

This is way beyond "loving the grind". Also, going to a Festival does not mean these people have a good life Balance. They are all addicted and will regret it one day.
---
3 days??? Bet...

That was my goal and it progresses account so much
---
so... another fight caves like deal?
---
we’re the first couple hundred kills before the log was created?
---
it'll be 1gp, its zenyte
---
Yeah, and that's great. But as my original post, I have 68, and 0 motivation to do it. I need about 900k - 1m xp to reach 77 I think.

Efficient hours played, close though! Assumes the exp you have gained was achieved using the most efficient methods and calculates the time it would have taken to achieve it. Most people play much more than an hour to achieve 1 ehp.
---
That doesn’t sound too bad at all. I appreciate your time and thank you for the link!
---
Says the RS3 guy.
---
Yes because doing something else that you (a randomer on reddit) approve of is less of a waste of time than doing something they actually enjoy. Dense. At the end of the day everyone dies, so why would he conform and do something he doesn't enjoy so judgmental fuckers like you would pat him on the back?
---
Didn't the majority just pass a brand new dungeon the other week? And a brand new master quest a few weeks before that? And the kebos lowlands a few months before that?
---
The vast majority of proposed content passes the polls. The 2007-purists are not nearly as numerous as this sub likes to make out.
---
Thanks for the reply and the info! The more you know. :)
---
Check my post history if you want, I hardly post karma worthy material ever.
---
Reposti
---
Of course man, do ask questions if you need to
---
Speak for yourself, I would take all my best gear still. If you won't accept the risk then you will get less reward, that's the idea. It's annoying for people who aren't willing to risk their items, but hard cores manage everything without dying just fine.
---
I bet his chair is it's own microbiome with a whole ecosystem of swamp-ass bacteria.

O shit I still have to vote
---
Later,  virgins
---
What..? If you see someone wearing nothing, be a good person and ignore them. You're going out of your way to be an asshole and expecting a juicy reward for killing someone who's unarmed. Kind of insane.
---
yup. it's really simple. after a few attempts you'll have it all memorized.
---
OH LAWD HE MAXIN
---
Damn. All these insecure people projecting their own issues onto someone else. Big ooof
---
(lol)
---
Efficient hours played - meaning hours played while reaching max XP rates possible
---
... if my front door has 1000 people putting different keys into it every second then yes, I would gladly walk in through a side door or the window. This analogy is fucking awful, go have a wank to quell that rage boner. 
---
Honestly zez probably decided he was bored of this game and is trying something new until the griefers give up.
---
Now you're onto something, clues shouldn't be in the wildy to begin with
---
I wasn't comparing the stat increase over each other item, I was talking about the raw stats that you're walking into the gorilla cave with. The d'hide body + d'hide chaps + pray range setup yields less mage defence (**+78 total**) than tassets + pray mage does in ranged defence (**+ 148 total**). The latter lets you take less damage (it isn't even close) and without compromising DPS. It is for this reason that tassets is on the wiki strategy guide, every gorilla tutorial video and on 90% of players you see in the dungeon. You haven't invented some secret tech strategy that everyone's glossing over. If you want to run a less efficient setup, that's entirely your business and I won't bash anyone for their playstyle. But if we're going to deal with facts, I've provided them. 
---
Your strategy of praying range and flicking augury may have some merit depending on your levels, although I presume most players including myself don't want to expend the extra effort though. I also assume max stats when I'm discussing which setup is better in any scenario.
---
Which is nice because only a beast would have the patience to grind for that long
---
if you die is it hard to get body back?
---
I just want to say you deserved better than that and it's his loss. I've been ghosted before, so I can understand how you're feeling. Keep your head up!
---
Haha! Don't worry, I plugged it in soon after.
---
nope, just keep some barrows teleports in the bank and teleport back
---
I think what you're forgetting, and this is important, is that Swordchicks drop noted herblore mats.
---
Go to the gym and strengthen up.
---
You should not be hurting from literally sitting still.
---
It's okay. I'm so sorry about what happened to you! That sounds a bit like me and him. I played new games with him, he even taught me stuff on RS I didn't know how to before. I also stopped playing RS for a bit to spend more time with him and didn't regret it one bit. I'm sorry you lost everything on the account, but remember it's possible to rebuild! It's good you put time an effort into the relationship, at least you know you can walk away knowing you tried your best! Do not blame yourself. I blame myself, but I only feel worse in the end.
---
The thing I learnt is it takes two people to make a relationship work. You can't do that by yourself.
---
She should have been there for you whilst you were going through that, not pulling away. You don't just stop loving someone imo. Either you never did or you've been pretending for months. I am so sorry, but you're strong and you will recover! I feel like it'll take me months to get over this, but all I can do is try. 
---
We deserve better. Someone who loves us the way we love them. Love shouldn't be one sided.
---
It helps in a way to post it out there, gets it off my chest. I'm here if you want to talk :) everyone copes in different ways. It just means you cared a lot! Thanks a lot, I really appreciate that!
---
Effecient Hours Played. The most possible xp/h you can possibly get.
---
People hate pkers way before people made memes about them LOL and These arent stereotypes, its the pkers montra "kill everyone because you never know they could have 10m on them"
---
Amazing idea*
---
REEEEEPOST
---
what do i need prayer pots and food? should i pack my inventory? can i use food like tuna or do i need more expensive tuna?
---
Not gonna lie. They dont have to tell us shit, not are we entitled to it. 
---
The community wanted hidden polls and now that we have them people don’t want them hidden anymore. 
---
So what if people are voting on alts.
---
Someone said he voted yes on 220 different account. I don't believe this in slighest but it makes one think about this exact thing you're posting about. I wonder how many alts voted on this poll compared to any other randomly picked vote the past years?
---
Do jagex intend for alts to have voting rights or are they gonna count several voted from the same ip as one? If one were to use a vpn it would be basically impossible to track.
---
I thought I was lucky for both vissys under 400kc
---
is also has hella negative melee stats so it still isnt viable to use.
---
I think people wanted hidden polls until they voted on that poll, and they would become unbidden after one finished the poll.
---
That’s usually how online polls work. 
---
But yeah, I agree with what you’re saying.
---
Did you instantly learn how to write at 6 years old because you've had 6 years to learn it?
---
"I like pie!"
---
Nice strawmen. I want magic gear but not in the form of a skill where you stand in front of a bank and click on your inventory. Also being an ironman is hard. That's how mafia works.
---
Good god... I understand the reasoning behind this but when you have members quest that literally drop 25-40k exp in skills in some of these with little to no effort it just makes me feel bad that people think you have to be a certain level before going members.
---
The game is meant to be members from the start, F2P is only locking content at all levels from yourself. If you enjoy the game enough to torture yourself with 789 levels of F2P you really should have just went members from the get go.
---
Just a tip to anyone else starting out or doing this same method.
---
Not sure why we can't just congratulate people for accomplishing an extraordinary goal without making judgments about how they spend their time. I imagine if we added up all the time you "waste" watching Netflix, browsing the web, social media, other games, etc. over a period of 5-6 years I'm not sure you'd like the figure that comes up. Some people are totally content focusing on a singular hobby.
---
locater orb is where its at
---
its 100% not banable. you're trading runescape gold for runescape gold.
---
theres also a lot of people who vote yes on literally everything, newer players who never experienced EOC are probably more likely to vote yes to any change, good or bad
---
He can almost finally play the game
---
Wait you're telling me spending 15+ hours everyday clicking on triangles isn't a good way to spend your life?
---
If an IP limit was implemented though, it would slow a small to medium percentage of people down from voting multiple times.
---
There is a flaw in your logic with bonds. If the price is going down that means more people are selling them than people buying. If there was an influx of people buying bonds on the GE the price would go up because demand would become greater than supply. 
---
I agree that it sucks that people are using multiple accounts but it would be impossible to enforce any other way.
---
casuals just reply with omegalul when ppl mention mental endurance cus they dont know its a thing
---
Also slap f5 equipment on there. Then use runelite to remap 1-5
---
I agree! He never once told me he'd lost feelings or that he was unhappy. I know we had our arguments, but he never even tried to sort them or talk to me about it, he'd just pull away.. I guess it's pretty obvious why now. 
---
Thank you so much! Me too. 
---
It makes me angry and upset because it made me feel like I never meant anything to him. I'm sorry it's happened to you too, no one deserve that.
---
Because a new skill is the only new content we can get. Get a fucking grip of yourself.
---
Definitely no more cows. You’re gonna burn yourself out if you train with them and probably cause a cow genocide. :)
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide
---
Follow this guide and it’ll help speed up your training by a lot (assuming you’re P2P).
---
You vote for your government, you don’t instantly know what the results are.
---
That’s the point of voting. 
---
If you have voted any you see the results it voids the point of hiding the results. 
---
As for bonds, it’s summer. There is always an influx of bonds being bought and sold, the polls have nothing to do with that.
---
Maybe just a random new player opinion but despite being a big pvp fan and having played in very high mmrs in other games I can't seem to grasp the pvp here. 
---
I have a friend that tells me some stuff to do in runelite and such but it's like everything is so cryptic that it feels like every player has a "technical advantage" in regards to plugins or addons. A few examples could be the prayer thing that tells you the weapon the enemy has or binding prayer to hotkeys.
---
Also the fact that I'm from South America and playing with 170ms is no fun.
---
bring 6 prayer pots your first time, then bring less next time depending on how many you use.  then fill the rest of your inventory with food/runes/armor.
---
tuna could work but you want the strongest food you can find of course.
---
yes but most people dont think this quickly in high stress situations. particularly not people who are falling for this scam id imagine
---
Still 400m is nothing. 3rd age pick is also cosmetic only and is 1.2b
---
I'm not a fanboy, neither am I triggered. You just talk about this topic without any knowledge and then get angry when you get called out. I just corrected your statement, that is all. Your numbers were way off and I just wanted to say that you shouldn't talk when you don't have a clue. No harm intended.
---
Personally, I think if you're interested in the lore, looking on the RS3 Wiki would help a lot as well, even if a lot of it from the mid Fifth age to Sixth age isn't canon in OSRS currently. Specifically, their [history](https://rs.wiki/History) page is very fleshed out.
---
Waiting for the mod smackdown on this one, OP was probably botting, smh my head
---
I used to comment like you, but then realized it's not worth your time. It's a never ending battle. Its easier to just ignore the post or give the answer
---
Harder hits = less casts/shots taken
---
Well, I suppose you could use some programm that remaps keys to the F keys. That should be allowed as far as I know
---
Thank you for understanding! Glad your friend was able to get you back into the game :) I'm sorry you had a similar issue, it's not good &gt;.&lt; I hope it will too, I just feel like it'll take a few months because he still means a hell of a lot to me. Yeah I'm guilty of remembering the good, but it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I'll have to give that a try! He's hurt me more than anyone ever has :/ doesn't matter how long you've been with someone, you still loved and cared for that person so it's still going to hurt regardless, but I understand :c 
---
It's always harder when they break up with you in such a heartless way. It is to me anyway. 
---
I'll keep that in mind! Damn right you don't!
---
It's a shame he can't see that :/
---
Or you know, dont drop your valuable fucking items? 
---
It takes multiple conscious actions do to it. If you got a brain you know its too good to be true.
---
Runelite can make it so you can use the number keys. You can also use AHK to remap your F keys to other keys. You can also use a programmable keyboard.
---
Thats not true whatsoever. They're both exactly the same ticks. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
what the fuck
---
They create twitter and reddit threads 2 days before usually, you just reply to those. If your question addresses an actual problem dont expect to see it on stream
---
You are allowed too as long as it’s 1:1 I use binds for my mouse and have 0 problems
---
OP is the ice block
---
Have you seen how split the community is on this? There is 0% chance this passes
---
For anyone who was wondering I sunk all the gp into bonds and items for f2p players as a final send off for osrs thanks for the memories people.
---
I, giorno Giovanna, have dreams of that face
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll definitely keep an eye out for that thread.
---
I don't think there's such thing as an unbiased opinion
---
Use f keys to change between prayer and inv
---
Lol
---
No there really isn't, worst part is the the people who did it don't realise how much their hurting the other person mentally. That's exactly right, overthinking tends to only make it worse.
---
None of us are perfect, but at least you can say that you tried to make it work when things got rough. All he did was run away and hide. 
---
100%. Lack of communication is the biggest problem in relationships as more arguments/issues can be solved if we actually voice our grievences, but unfortunately not everyone thinks like that.
---
It really isn't fair. The one's in the wrong can just move on and keep enjoying carefree while the people left behind have to deal with the heartbreak and it just shouldn't work like that.
---
You just need to keep reminding yourself that you deserve better than that and try to do things that help you forget. You're doing well by talking about the pain to move through it, as bottling up inside is never healthy.
---
You're an amazing human, never forget that! &lt;3
---
Not sure what Cx being in my name ha to do with being delusional about anything.
---
I’m still not sure why you’re assuming I think he doesn’t function. I’ve not said that, all I’ve said is is he has an unhealthy addiction to something. 
---
As for being jealous, I’m not sure what I’d be jealous of. I’m not ‘going’ for him at all, I don’t have anything against him. All I’ve said is it’s not healthy to play the amount he does, and having friends and going to festivals doesn’t suddenly make it healthy. You’ve just got it in your head that I have some vendetta for him.
---
In case you didn't know, we will be getting a massive update with loads of content in just 3 days. Jmods have even said that it might be the biggest update OSRS has seen so far. And the quest that is also coming with the update had like over 90% yes votes.
---
But i guess we are getting no new content right?

You should stop taking your Adderall recreationally, you come off as a meth head.

You claimed the stereotypes are correct. The most repeated stereotype recently is the salad robe brainlet. Your randomly capitalized verbal diarrhea is already hard to interpret as is, you can't expect me to read your mind as well.
---
I'd say it's the opposite hence why they do it in the first place
---
I think this just shows how much we as a community want a new skill, whether it be warding or something else
---
Probably because spending everyday of your life sat behind a screen all day clicking a rock isn’t good 😂
---
If you really watch a lot of twitch then you would have seen his streams. I barely watch twitch and even I have seen him live multiple times. Never tuned in tho

Its not, dumbass. All they have to do is put disclaimers on the packs lmfao. Get a brain.

So that it's not as easy to level as Runescape 3.

Greetings comrade

I think it was polled but didnt pass. Someone else confirm if this is true?
---
Higher than you think. Random events are on intervals where they only spawn within certain timeframes after logging in. If you watched or participated in the start of a Deadman season/tournament, you'd know after about 5 minutes of the server being active, a huge flood of random events appear.
---
I know it's a bit controversial, but I really wish they had put a GE in prif.
---
I'm going to make a point of going to prif instead of the GE whenever I can, but the GE is just way too efficient a base.
---
I want to flip with the tall bois :(
---
You’re wrong, BH can be dead at some points but I have a 86 combat 75 attack account and I’ve made 700M and gotten 600-700 BH kills in a month of PKing.
---
Personally don't mind it, got attack styles/special on F1, inv F2, pray F3, mage F4. That's all I really need, so F1-4 is perfect, considering in osrs I don't need to really use any other functions via my keyboard. would be different if i also had 10 OTHER functions on letter keys.
---
Isn’t 3rd age pick equal to a dragon pick and BIS for raids 1 guardians? More useful than 3rd age sword
---
Because it messes up the economy big time and makes the game easyscape
---
high level noob
---
xD
---
Can't imagine what it's like to think everyone who disagrees with your narrow and ignorant opinions is "uneducated".  Last I checked I was in my 3rd year studying cs on a full ride eSports scholarship.  Twitch pays for all my living expenses and I've been spending most of my time playing games for the last 7 years now.    
---
But if you think you know more about it than me then go ahead and keep commenting, it's been real entertaining watching you get triggered over everyone calling you out on your bs.
---
I'd like to see that idea explored again if I'm honest. There are limitless things that could be done with it
---
Misogyny
---
If it wasn't enough to live off of then Jase would have a job smh
---
OSRS came out 2,341 days ago. That's 6.8 hours of max efficiency per day for 6.5 years.
---
Probably because its so prestigious because of the slow rates, also its ok money so maybe that too
---
Had that happen on a huge project for Haworth once. I was sad at first because we were going to install it in California but then remembered all the overtime I got compensated for and got over it real quickly. It’s a job, these things happen, I understand that those working on OSRS are a bit more passionate than most but at the end of the day they are getting paid
---
Read on another thread pretty all streamers were saying to vote no
---
??? 
---
It's currently passing
---
I don't get this. Poll results should have been hidden prior to voting then after you vote you can see the results. That way you get transparency but still prevent badwagoning.
---
Close OSRS in the app switcher, then change your phone's screen resolution under Settings&gt;Display, then relaunch OSRS and log in. Repeat for each resolution available. Tell me what happens.
---
Here's to hoping Warding will pass.
---
Find something you can listen to like a podcast or sit in a voice chat with friends
---
I know this might sound a bit harsh but I'm glad that this happened at the 5 year mark instead of 10 years or after marriage and kids. Sometimes people just blindside you like that. Hopefully it'll be a bit easier to recover knowing that the dude is a douchebag.
---
i can't see the bazoongas goddamnit
---
No, it shows that this a really important question to the community. We don't know the results yet, so you can't really say that it shows how much the community wants a new skill.
---
Reason why most polls don't get this many votes is because they aren't as exciting or significant to the game.
---
Uhhhhhh, the only spec weapon people use in high risk worlds is the gmaul
---
Uhh.....Moms spaghetti?
---
Am I doing this right?
---
I dont like it because it make training expensive skills only viable on these bonus xp events. I would vote no if there would be vote.

Always cracks me up when people say farming is tedious.

Plant 6 fruit trees, a calquat, hespori, and mahagony trees every 3 days and it averaged to 100k a day.

Toss in a redwood and celestrus tree and you are at something like 125k a day.

Can we go back to this format of poll questions please.

&gt;Poll Question 1  
---
&gt;Warding   
---
&gt;Yes  
---
&gt;No
---
Lmfao
---
&gt;Especially when you have no idea how they spend the rest of their time.
---
as someone who is neet and plays 17 hours a day there is no such thing as "rest of their time" you literally play and sleep over and over again
---
With that logic any waking moment you aren’t spending self improvement or making money your whasting
---
RS playing time also doesnt necessarily have to subtract from the available amount of hours in a week.
---
I had 12 hours playing time per day for like 5 months when I started playing, but I had a regular sleeping schedule, work 40 hours, go to the gym 5 times a week and have a normal social life (or well, I consider it normal, I have no reason to believe it isnt). How? Most of my hours were on my phone at work or in the gym, 1 click per 3-10minutes.
---
yeah you dont read the newspaper, but that was never actually part of the scam. instead they just open and shut the door until it goes on a timer and stays shut, then you cant get back to your stuff before it spawns and you lose it all.
---
I accept that fact that teams PK for fun and not for loot, and i hope this is just a meme and you understand this too. 
---
The problem with teams are that they're killing the wilderness imo.
---
Welcome to MMOs
---
&gt; The point of hiding the results is to prevent the results from swaying your opinion, once your vote has been placed it can't be changed, so what would it matter if you instantly saw the results
---
It could certainly sway people with alts to keep voting or not bother though.
---
Nsfw
---
whasting?

Multi tiered. top tier with 99/99 HP logo

Middle tier with the RS logo

Bottom tier with different skill icons

Hey OP, I've had my fair share of online dating experiences. Whilst never as long as 5 years, in fact none of my intimate relationships have been quite that long (I wonder what that says about me hah!).
---
I have definitely had some very long running friends on Runescape. Back pre-eoc I had a few friends I would play with daily, whether PKING, skilling, chatting, miniganes or later in the future of RS grinding out huge dungeons in dungoneering. Since then I have grown as a person quite a bit in the years since Pre-eoc, because of that I'm okay with the fact that some things are in the past and really all that i can do is move forward.
---
Sure having friends and being in love is a very different thing, however my point is your next step will always be to move forward no matter what. The individual in your post is imo immature and is definitely not worth your pain mate.

Except this is a private video game and not a constitutionally vested right to vote, and the standard set by the creators of the video game is "1 membership = 1 vote." At no point whatsoever were votes supposed to be tied to specific players, otherwise why shouldn't all F2P players and inactive former P2P players get votes in every poll as well?
---
2005 era was tough. Us 10 year olds never had credit cards or PayPal. If your parents wouldn’t let you be a member you had to be crafty.
---
You're looking for r/runescape
---
r/2007scape is for old school runescape
---
Why would that be a problem? One vote per person is fair. People voting on alts just skews the vote one way or another..

The fact you missed Ali Morrisane is unacceptable tbh, the feud has a great storyline

I thought this was an ad for a second for FFXIV
---
You guys have the quote wrong. It's 10k hours to become the top level. And that's not the average person, that's roughly how many hours of quality practice on average it took for people who are now top level to have hit the top level point. It's refering to top level of fields like olympic athletes, classical musicians, grandmaster chess, etc. That's very different from taking a sample of all people who put 10k hours into something and seeing if they are top level.
---
Regardless, it was just an estimate at some point, and meant to say that most top level people devoted the same amount of effort regardless of the field.
---
I understand PK'ing is fun and a large part of the game, but I don't see the appeal in killing unarmed opponents who clearly aren't risking anything? Surely if you want to PK the fun is in actual PVP not PV'freekill'?

Are you really comparing working an office job to playing runescape all day?

One ensures you have a financially stable future and helps develop skills to better yourself and move up in the world and the other gives you pixel gold coins and virtual levels. Can you really not see the difference?

honestly think they could balance BP, if the scales went in a scale pouch in the neck slot and the darts went into the ammo slot.

the weapon itself is so strong it's wild, taking out your blessing and your neck slot might bring it in line, or maybe that's waaay too much of a nerf, but holy shit that weapon is strong.

Is there a chrome plugin or something that highlights people that post on the donald?

The correlation still doesn’t fit with 1 person = 1 vote. You don’t get twice the say, you shouldn’t be able to brigade polls because you have more expendable money for multiple memberships. If you are one of the people who has multiple accounts, and you used that, good for you. But it isn’t honest.
---
Just checked it now and it broke 102K. It is officially the most voted poll in the history of the game, surpassing the first-ever poll's 101K votes. That said the Partnership Poll probably would have seen similar turnout if it ran the full duration instead of 2 days, but it is still amazing to see the community beat its previous peak for polls.
---
It's about the faster time for each single chest. If you only think about what you're spending and not what your getting you would never really have a reason to use the blowpipe since it's decently expensive to use
---
There's loads of other bugs like this, where the rendering order is screwed up. It's not a bug specific to these two item combinations, it's more of a general game bug.
---
Jealousy doesn’t look good on you 💅🏾
---
As far as I'm aware it's basically his job. How is it any different to sitting in an office all day doing menial shit besides the fact he gets to interact with people on stream?
---
From what I've heard, donations are more money than subs on avarge(depends on personality, more if you're an entertainer than if you're just good at the game). It might be inconsistent on a day to day basis, but it avarges out over a month.
---
That is what the great gods of RuneScape determined the set up to be therefore it's the best
---
Perhaps
---
I thought wow was like 40-50 gb?
---
U/shrewynd why don’t you ever come bot or at least place vision. Bro you haven’t been to my lane once meanwhile too Lane has been fucking serenaded all game. This is bs ff at 15
---
IMO it's more worth playing then os :)
---
Uh more votes on this than any poll ever is a good indicator. You also have tons of people saying they're using alts to vote if you look. I'm sure there are a lot of people using alts to vote yes, but I've more often seen people saying they're using alts to vote no, hence why I said they're more often being used as such.
---
No problem, ya stodgy doughnut
---
I wish it would pass, the game needs new skills, that's what makes it fun. I remember when dungeoneering (say what you want about the skill, I enjoyed it) came out I was super excited. The game needs new skills
---
Would also make barrows a little aids to do tbh
---
No problem :D
---
You made the wrong choice friend
---
With 75% I don't think a skill will ever pass its too high for something that divides a lot of the community
---
either you are real jimmmshady,if so, cool. If not, your nickname is pretty sad
---
Is this how tinder works for attractive people?
---
bought my first membership ever (been playing on and off for well over a decade and a half, and mom’s credit card doesn’t count) to vote on this specific poll
---
OP mid level shat
---
unlogical isnt a word. but people who fall for scams generally get blinded by the idea of making a quick buck, so logic kind of goes out the window. buddy of mine fell for an "antiscam" scam even though i literally told him "be careful man you are probably being scammed by the antiscammer" lmao
---
?????
---
This scam is really basic it kinda pisses me off how people fall for this like this is legit on every don’t get scammed YouTube videos
---
Because the EHP mining method is horrible.
---
Yerp. Other people can hear it
---
Drop it to the main lolol
---
They still have the right to not want it in the game for their reasons, else there shouldn’t be a poll
---
And about “optional”, sooner or later there are going to be activities that depend on your Warding level. Therefore locking content from those who dislike Warding should they choose not to train it as “optional”
---
i.e. I doubt you like all skills in the game lol, yet you had to train some that you disliked for a useful quest
---
There’s also more into play than just enjoying to buy materials and wasting them in the bank for xp. I’m sure there are people who vote Yes see stuff that people who vote No doesn’t, and vice versa
---
Assuming people are -w/e- for not agreeing with an opinion is extremely disrespecful and it’s happening on both sides by now
---
It still is “I like Warding” having a “Lmao stfu Warding sucks” response or a “I don’t like Warding” having a “Fuck off I like it mr sweaty nerd”
---
I gotta admit though the memes are 100 lol I’m a “skip vote” guy idc about the outcome
---
Woox traded his social skills for intelligence and maxed it out. Iirc he's in a high position in glorious gaming, which due to their very successful launch of their model O(soon o-) , is probably making hella dough.

With the single screenshot feature mentioned; yeah I do one step extra compared to having it automated.
---
I think pressing two keys isn’t beyond the ability for most people... or at least I’d hope so :p
---
Brexit bad XD🤪🤪
---
Half the skills in the game involve clicking at a bank, what makes warding different?
---
The point is that you THINK you can pick it up. So you believe they give you 100m then you retrieve your items.
---
The scam is that while they are 'trading you' 100m, someone gets the door stuck. Then they decline the trade and take your items, presumably with an account logged on the other side of the door.
---
idk why but I find Minecraft graphics to be a million times better than osrs graphics or even rs3 graphics tbh
---
&gt; I've almost spent 7k hours playing CS:GO, and I am in no way addicted to the game itself.
---
I’ve spent almost 6 years smoking crack, and I am in no way addicted to the drug itself.
---
See how stupid that sounds? 
---
If you honesty don’t believe he’s not addicted to game you’re extremely ignorant. I think most of this sub can relate to have being somewhat addicted to this game at one point in time or another, myself included. 
---
Stop playing it down so much and trying to justify everything, it’s literally what someone with an unhealthy addiction would do :^)
---
Righto my man, seems to me you’re the 2nd guy in the vid defending your opinion :) hf
---
I actually really like it. It would absolutely not work in osrs, but I still like it in the context of rs3.
---
“Only” 20m rc xp to go!
---
that torag suggestion is way too overpowered. you'd essentially have two rolls of a 25% chance to stun as you'd get two hits in between every single stun.
---
Thank you :)
---
Doing my last task for Kandarin Hard Diary. Can I boost from 65 fishing to catch a Leaping Sturgeon at Barb fishing?
---
Yep, I brought my new herb sack on a farm run yesterday and totally forgot it only held 30 of each type lol.
---
It might be alright for that if each herb patch was a different type if herb.....
---
it's sarcasm pretty sure
---
Keep doubling up with the 5m and you'll make over max cash stack with 11 wins!
---
At least 77 prayer for rigour and argury, both are great upgrades so be sure to get those as well. Finish DS2 and you can get a DHL or a DHCB if you want to make mad money.
---
Cool, your stats are closest to mine of the responses and sounds like I'm doing fine given the lack of sgs.
---
How long would you say this took you?
---
Nit a bad shout. Gimme a couple months and I'll let you know if you were right or not ha
---
Oh I didn’t know this
---
Nothing happened. Im assuming OP is using android, I have the same thing on my s9
---
What’s the price of Bitcoin?
---
Thanks, I think it makes sense for both PVP and PVE, and gives a way to tell new players that combo eating even exists. Plus the higher healing beverages could have harsher debuffs.
---
But this goes back to why I am so Jaded against the PVP community. One suggestion like this and your flamed by 400 tryhards angry that you don't like octopus lol.
---
Yeah jagex moved to hide poll results like a month ago i think?
---
You do realize you play runescape on a COMPUTER, right?
---
If you had the brains for it, you could set it up to play with a controller.
---
Just note herbs on the leprechaun. Doesnt make sense to use the herb sack for herb runs
---
Dw Noexi mate i don't take it personally, the same exact things would be said about any high ranked player regardless of who they are, what they're like or what they do. All good (its actually quite funny to read through)
---
Looks like he’s just trippin’ ballz
---
you're objectively a bad person.
---
Why?
---
You can note herbs by using them on the leprechaun. You don’t need to take an herb sack
---
Sorry, I should have said "unhappy with a change".
---
that's how eyes work lol an eyelid is just a cover for your eyes that's the same color as your skin
---
ok gj
---
BINGO
---
Yeah but like general shop price is like 2gp
---
Ohhhh gotcha. Thank you.
---
And you're entitled to that opinion, but it doesn't make you any less wrong. If you genuinely can't see the difference between someone being unable to handle critique of a thing they enjoy, and someone *literally* stopping someone else from being able to enjoy something then I don't really know what else to say.
---
what plugin is the item highlight?
---
Never said it did. People dont riskfight on pures with gmauls, theres usually elder, zgs, ags. Or if youre a fucking brainlet sure go use a gmaul. youre not gonna find fights or ur gonna have rng fights. Risk fighting is meant to be about skill
---
I had so many flax slaves. They would sell me like 5k each per day at around 85gp, insta sell in bulk for 100gp each. 
---
Felt like such a baller, even though it didn't really make that much money, it was steady and easy.
---
Ranging wyverns is awful, lots of bots and crashers there.
---
Ladies and gentleman, we got him
---
hope your first day on osrs was good
---
stop trolling please.
---
I thought of that too, but i guess its hard to think calmly when you get caught in a situation like that. Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
---
I know that players use Karil/DH to pk, I do it myself sometimes. And I do agree with you that it's okay now; the existing set effect is still trash, though.
---
Ahrim's, my thought was getting people to actually use the Ahrim's set FULLY and not just pieces of it. Pkers never use the full set. You're talking about how Ahrim's would be buffed--not really at all. Those little Ahrim's pieces people are carrying around will stay the same as people used them before, and wouldn't affect they way people currently utilize Ahrim's. It would take a player to commit to using the full set, sacrificing Ranged Defence Bonuses and pigeonholing their attack style to Magic for them to see this added effect. So it increases commitment and risk. Hardly a buff to the whole set, and not a buff whatsoever to any individual pieces that players already use.
---
I think Torags is the main concern, which is why I put him in the middle. I'll do a more thorough analysis the second time, and offer up different options that people might like including faster Attack Speed, etc. Stay tuned.
---
guarantee you haven't even read the dev blog. stop trolling and go away
---
thats what i actually have used for the 5.7:1
---
You can use ahk as long as it's 1:1
---
100% the very first thing I did after logging in with members
---
I don't know, he's not fat though if that's what you're asking.
---
That 71% from the strawpoll was between Yes, No, and Skipped. In-game the Skipped numbers would have been omitted from % calc. So if % on that was calculated as it is in-game, it would instead be something like 76%
---
I’m done with you dude, dont waste your time
---
I found some people doing it eventually, thank you for the offer though, i appreciate it!
---
thats what ill be doing from now on, have fun on osrs and grind spooder on rs3 for cash when i run dry
---
Someone give me 2.5m (I have 1.5m) so I can go vote!
---
who TF doesn't use f keys lmao you were failed from the get
---
Just get protect from missiles for the damage mitigation?
---
That means that each party can just shut the fuck up and move on after the results are final.
---
thats how i found the one i saw, thanks
---
What actually is the voting req right now?
---
Just give us that safe zone configuration that I had to set up for call of duty MW2 to line up the Heads Up Display.
---
put on your mith caps boyz jamflex is out to git your mother
---
Should probably blame Samsung for shitty configurations and not Jagex tbh
---
I'd like to know what percentage of the votes are from ALTs.
---
Greed, dude. Greed.
---
Same here, I’ve played it for so long yet don’t really give a damn about the lore. I wonder why that is honestly. I know some things but don’t really care to learn more. Something tells me adding more and more gods after the original 3 kinda made it annoying to me
---
Indeed. Sometimes I think some of these new monsters are a nerf to slayer, if even just a nerf to my points if I don't have the patience for it that day.
---
got it from fanatic on 4 kc as well lol
---
PasséBook
---
Dz?
---
nope, only giving away ferarris
---
I too enjoy having a full bandos Chad coming to my world and telling me to hop
---
Good work keeping print media alive!
---
Im in the same boat fam, its rough
---
99% of the time these fake ads are linked to bots for cleaning accounts. The bot goes through their bank and sells it all/mules automatically. I wonder if some of the bot scripts are made to destroy untradeables too
---
&gt;1 vote per ip adress
---
Hope the person I go to college with votes the right way!!
---
You can buy them at garden shops or the dude on Karamja. Otherwise they’re free at the estate guy in Falador.
---
A short time is all I need
---
Im speaking more on singles pking. IMO multi is fine the way it is  If a team teleblocks you, they log in with however many people 3-10ish people usually, and they will all pj you so theres no chance of killing any of them. You get pker 1 down to 20 HP and his buddy bolts you off so you can no longer attack him, repeat. Making it basically impossible to kill them without a huge spec.
---
Quest items and untradeables, then items that give the next best bonuses. 
---
Usually just get what you can afford. Sometimes two cheaper pieces combined is better than one expensive item alone. Just try to figure out how things work together. 
---
But there is no “wrong” way to play the game. Just ways to make things more efficient. 
---
And best gear is hard to answer but just try to get tier 70 items first as a goal. In range, magic, and melee.
---
Dibbah for my nibbah
---
I agree with 750, but the folks saying 1250 just sound elitist
---
GF
---
That is against the rules, it's much more fun to build an account from scratch
---
What a loser
---
Honestly amazing effort from scammer. "Whatever you are, be a good one"
---
I remember the grind at the beginning lol, I don't know if I could catch my sons attention, especially in the higher paced games of today.
---
He has such a way with words
---
I'm the same way. I just hate going back to quests if I left off in the middle somewhere so I usually do them in one shot if I can. Granted a lot of quests take like 20-40 minutes, Desert Treasure and Underground Pass was ass
---
No it doesnt. Stabbing weapons and bolts do. Unless youre talkng about the metal dragons.
---
That's not even close to being specific jesus christ dude
---
If you dont have could, get it.
---
I don’t know if you know this but I actually tried to vote on an HC I made and played for like 10 hours, it said that I needed X amount of quest points of 20-25 hours of game time.
---
Makes sense that they’re not manned, hence why they’re so quick to get into your account. 
---
But why program the bot to get rid of untradeables? Seems unnecessary...
---
Gonna compare this to kourend tele after I get outta work
---
I was just commenting on potential repolling and how useless it seems to be because of what you said.
---
Im not flaming you for how you voted lol
---
max melee will get around 30k/hr. Not really worth it...if you want slayer xp it's better to do barrage/cannon tasks, and if you want afk money it's better to do rune dragons (or invest in improving your account until you can do rune dragons).
---
These posts are lame.
---
One vote per person, boss, not per household/ device. I do see why they did that, but their reluctancy to invest in better security and monitoring is on them
---
Spending time on the subreddit? Sounds like xp waste to me
---
I'd still want my original account.
---
People were a lot more careful voting for things back then because they remembered Jagex ruining the original version not too long ago.
---
if you can grind that much RC the hell you're escaping must be awfule and unending. I'd argue, anyways.
---
*mole pup
---
Aw you're right. Never knew until now, but the splash animations are diff range vs mage when the atk hits you
---
Yes because a stream is a clear indication of mental health and well being.
---
I can definitely see how that could ruin it for you. I didn't get on the dark souls train until playing 1 in 2015 and went into 2 without seeing any footage and got the SOTFS on sale so my experience was vastly different. Going into the "finished" version that was pretty great then seeing all the hate for it kinda radicalized my opinion lol. I see where you're coming from though.
---
You can if they are an NPC 😧

finishing up a black demon task at demonics. no zenyte yet. Reddit plz bestow upon me the luck of 2147m ironmen.
---
At first I was thinking oh God what an asshole, but he has a max cape now which means hes no longer allowed to talk to females. It's nothing you did wrong, hes just evolving into a max Cape virgin boy. Sorry for your loss.
---
Good
---
Hey it's me, your old friend. gratz
---
Because alot of people don't find it very interesting at all and don't really want another bankstanding skill. Alot of dev time would go this so it is a big choice to make not just a "why not".
---
Im not sure OP was entirely serious...
---
I do have one account for both! Is there any way to transfer materials from 2007 to 2019 or anything like that?
---
That’s just an Easter egg. Did you notice the 1hp? Haha. I fooled you!
---
disassembling will be great for the RS economy as a whole, not just iron men. There's currently too much deflation with most items sitting at alch value. It will greatly increase the value of drop tables from monsters which primarily drop alchables and the value of clue scrolls, which are currently near worthless outside the mega-rare table.
---
Wow, for someone advocating to get out and get some sun, your post history shows you’re still quite toxic!
---
Neither I nor jase play 14 hours a day. Do you feel better now after knocking that strawman over?
---
That's the most stupid thing i've heard yet. Runescape is about the progression and leveling up. Why don't you just play another game if you don't wanna play this one?
---
Pures die faster than any other acc
---
&gt; Tbf blowpipe and Rigour definitely served only to powercreep and I'd vote yes on a soft nerf for the two.
---
Yeah and I completely agree. This is also falls a lot of Jagex's head since they released items that were clearly more powerful than intended but chose to do nothing for years.
---
Zulrah drop table nerf is a perfect example. They waited essentially a year to nerf it, if something is a problem why wait that long? At least poll it or get a discussion going.
---
That assumes the votes are equal, but in reality it’s a 75/25 split needed not a 50/50 split.
---
Reached 99 and didnt film a shotgun video..
---
Op I think you mean 220m to go. 
---
P.s. Warding please pass so my comment doesn't look the fool
---
Good touch providing a meme for both armies to upvote
---
Oh right my bad. For DS2 it was definitely royal rat authority. No boss made me ragequit, but that rat boss got me good.
---
Maybe they dont wany you to be able to fly though every single world till you find a clue hunter/pvmer
---
Found a group of noob miners in Lumbridge selling iron ore to the general store, ended up hiring over 10 noobs to mine iron ore for me for half value
---
Man the economy was so dynamic before the item value update.
---
Herb boxes my dude
---
The best skill in the game tho
---
Anyone know the very recent scam that littered all worlds with add this guy to ignore list bots? And how are 10+ bots even worth their bonds?
---
If you're that intent on not training it, you can still just drop the clue. You're not locked out.
---
Ok, so you need to get a Salve (EI), regular void is better than blessed d’hide. Don’t eat until you get to about 32 hp so the range attack can’t 1 hit you. Also BGS spec him before each kill. Use your acid phase to eat a few pieces of food if need be. You can also squeeze in a piece of food as he throws the freeze attack if need be.
---
Oh brother, this guy STINKS!
---
I agree he took the easy way out. He obviously didn't want to have to face me and he'd knew I'd be upset so he didn't want to deal with my emotions. No one takes being broken up with well unless it was a mutual decision, but even then it can still be painful. It's okay, and I'm sorry you're ex did something similar, it's very cowardly and disrespectful if you ask me &gt;.&lt; 
---
That is very true. As others have said at least we wasn't married with kids. Just such a shame it had to end this way.
---
Great, that chest is a gift straight from Saradomin for Ironmen :D
---
Ngl im silly, i never thought of dropping
---
How much? ;) haha
---
Nah the rewards are overpowered as fuck for mage pvm. If it passes im done with this game

Theyve transcended to a new plane if kharma whoring

What! I've had QPC for months and didn't know this. Now I'm gonna lose it
---
Ironman btw
---
He pays he should be able to vote. People willing to spend more money directly or not on a game they are passoniate about to vote on a topic for the future of the game. If you really feel positive towards warding make an alt or buy a bond for one.
---
Nope I’m a level 3 with 81 slayer going for 99. Thanks for your input though
---
Glad to be of help. No judgement, but I'm curious, is there any particular reason you're avoiding ranged or are you just not a fan of it?
---
Ghosting someone is horrible. I'm sorry this happened to you OP. Focus on yourself, move on and don't give him a second chance. If you ever want to vent or chat, feel free to PM. Try and have a good day / night regardless!
---
I am
---
No he was gonna take 100m and keep his gear because he’s too smart to be scammed! Then he got scammed
---
Das alotta alts
---
You don’t think you can sustain her boxes with an actual good xp setup?
---
Numbers are inflated with alts along with my 50 alts that I voted no with.
---
I hate this talk. Everyone begged for hiding polls being hidden forever and we finally get it, but now its seen as a bad thing??
---
Also remember when people with a bunch of 99's were inconceivable losers and the thought of getting one was unbelievable?
---
Now everyone and their brother is max combat and 2k total lol
---
Psst. For reasons amounting to 'i don't plan on doing this for a while ' try burning amulets out. The cut red topaz is the most expensive part, but it's worth the investment. Just suuuuuuper time consuming
---
This &gt;!Zammy Wine!&lt;
---
Obviously I'm biased, being a massive 07 player but I would certainly say this version is worth more of your time, the grinds feel more rewarding and the pvm, while simple in essence, is challenging and very well balanced.
---
Obvs, or is the osrs sub reddit 😂
---
I would gladly bet that my yearly income &gt; his.   
---
But that's not the point, because I don't care that he's working. I don't care that streamers make income playing the game, because 16-hour shifts aren't how the human race is supposed to function, either.   
---
I hope you get whatever you want out of defending him, really I do.
---
300k exp for lvl 60+ is a lot different to 200m lol
---
Get 99 FM at Wintertodt - pretty easy and you make some money out of it
---
Side effect is that you lose 75% of your IQ but just change chat to Game and you’re good.
---
Don’t dharok unless u have 90 stats
---
GrEAt JoB wE rEaLLy ShoWeD hIM! 🤓

you have to create it from scratch.
---
Not as click intensive but waaaaaaay less xp
---
I have void ranged... is it worth getting the other void helms? Where would I use void melee and mage? Thanks!
---
Well it's true for League. Go to League's subreddit and ask if it's possible.
---
&gt;I doubt having only 1 champ isn't a disadvatage considering counterpicks and bans in ranked modes.
---
1 champion is a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. 2-3 champions is really all you need.
---
I want so bad for it to pass with 75.1% just to see what happens here.
---
Cool! Thanks :)
---
Yup
---
Sure if you use nmz a lot. But if you hardly go, throwing an hour in there and making a mill in points every now and again is much better.
---
And if they're worse they're a noob
---
You create it yourself and hand it in to the armor collector in that section of zeah.
---
What happens to mounted quest capes?
---
Will mine just not work in my POH?
---
i got 50 runecraft on a f2p account AMA
---
Varrock Herald FTW
---
Not a skiller but I imagine they'll like the runecrafting pouch changes. No lunars = shitty zmi so typically lavas/steams are the way but even then, can't repair pouches without running to the edgelord in edgeville (no NPC contact).
---
Nice hyperbole
---
I support removing all those things
---
That's not an argument.  You're using time at the CURRENT setting and trying to justify it for future content.  It doesn't work that way.  Ideally, everyone participates as intended, therefore it is intended for everyone.
---
if it drops end game best in slot gear and needs end game stats to kill then i would say its end game content
---
Beasts are all sort of sick in the head
---
Tried to play rs3 mobile, super necessary.
---
It's okay, it sure is! I just couldn't believe it's been 6 years. I agree! I'll admit at first I didn't take it well, but how else was I supposed to take it? I just had to know if he felt anything for me or if we could work something out, but he said he's done trying.
---
It will definitely take some time to get over I know that much. I've never felt this way about anyone. Thank you so much! It's just nice to get it all out in the open because at the beginning I was embarrassed. 
---
I think he'll always have a place in my heart and I'll never forget the memories we shared, they'll always mean a lot to me. Oh I'm feeling all three of those at once! Even now I'm still slightly confused, but I've realised asking questions usually leaves you with even more questions.
---
This is one of my ways of coping :) some people might not agree and that's okay! Thank you for your kind words &lt;3 my future doesn't feel very bright right now as he'd promised me a lot of things, but at least this way I'll find someone who loves me as much as I love them. I'm just going to take it day by day. 
---
Thank you, I appreciate that.
---
dinhs and the blowpipe are in no way lategame, but are both meta definingly good
---
The trick truly is to get into the "rhythm" of it all. The first few hours are a real pain, but as the activity locks into your muscle memory it's smooth sailing until 77

Just get void melee, it will help you when you unlock vorkath. Void mage sucks. You can also get elite void, it gives more damage.

The title might seem derogatory, but I know a lot of people who get scammed cause they think they can anti-lure, this is just one of the ways to outsmart a scammer, simply show them a large amount, trade them one item that is cheap, get them to pay overprice, make sure on 2nd trade that you're making money and accept, it's super easy and pretty straight forward, good luck anti-scamming.
---
Hmmm, I forgot to add that I have an Anguish for ranged training, but I don’t think I’m going to keep it. I always just loved the look of the Torture ammy, and wanted it, but I figured it doesn’t give too crazy of bonuses over a fury for melee. Melee is my preferred combat style, would it be worthing buying the tort?
---
Thanks :D

This isn't r/unexpectedOSRS

Think about rune knives. They were used by almost every void build there is. They were strong, but not overpowered. Just balanced, vs pures and vs builds with defence. Now with the ability to hit double 20+ with only 25% spec bar used is busted. The rune knives were fine as they were. No need was there to make knives even more powerful. 1 defence takes more damage, sure. But it was balanced because the pure had a chance to stack the voider out with msb ags or something. Nowadays you have to pray for 1 lucky arrow. The rest of the fight is just triple eating. And the worst is when you manage to outeat the combo, lots of the times they just tab out saying ‘safer’. Fuck
---
I wonder how many alts were alts. Damn bond votes. A lot of that’s to bought.
---
I have a friend who knew someone who got permamuted and the reason was because he said the n word in game 173 times in 10 days.
---
&gt;more bots will be created
---
A new skill isn't going to suddenly incite more bot creation. People who bot already bot as much as they can, and people who don't bot, don't. Bots will just do different tasks (whichever makes them more money). Same thing for buying gold. 
---
This skill is literally an item sink *meant* to cause inflation because the economy is currently hurting from most items being worthless.

I don't know her age, but is word count a correlation to severity? As someone who was cheated on, I shared a bunch. Maybe you can count how many words I used and tell me if I have a problem? Not sure if I passed the thesis territory threshold yet.  Some move on faster than others.  
---
That being said, OP this isn't the place to be sharing this. There are plenty of subreddits specifically tailored for these sorts of situations. If you are doing this for exposure to get his attention, you are doing it wrong and not helping yourself to move on. There is plenty of advise on reddit, some good and a bunch bad, but most of the time nobody really follows it, just feels nice to read.   
---
On the off chance you're obsessed and just can get him out of your head. Perhaps talk with a professional. Good luck.

Why do we need a crafting 2.0 then, when we could very well judt add the warding features to crafting/rc
---
I have zero sympathy for these people, how much of a brainlet do you have to be to not think some random person PMing you is in on the scam.
---
I believe drongos are rather self sufficient and don't need to be resupplied by us.
---
It works similar on rs3 to right click lookup someone on runelite
---
Great idea, that sound like something I could really benefit from trying!

Rookie

Someone was training slayer in catacombs earlier, and despite all attempts to communicate they stayed silent. This was especially interesting since they were there before me, so even if they had public off I expected a comment of some kind, or a "hop retard."
---
Yerp. Noobs panic though. People really just need to know not to drop their fucking items though. Anything on the ground is no long yours.
---
yeah not my best moment. the ghosting thing was a mistake.
---
we can't help who we love and unfortunately it goes both ways, i don't believe you would be happy if he stayed with you despite not loving you anymore.
---
&gt;It's hard not to blame myself in some ways
---
its very easy to get into a bad headspace and play scenarios over and over again thinking about what if's. this is always a dangerous game and will cause more pain than it heals, but its something everyone does. perceived incompatibility does not make a person flawed.

They’re just upset their account isn’t as juicy as Jase’s

A bit harsh but well put. I also have been through a recent divorce and have written a few posts about it here on Reddit. I’m a “grown man” 21 yrs old, but I’m lonely and have few friends and found great solace in pasting my feelings to the void and having others comfort or encourage me. It helped me a lot. Now 12,000 words I don’t know about that, but 5 years is a long time man and a person can sure mean a lot to somebody. Being abandoned like that can cause some serious trust issues, I know from experience. I think it’s best to show this poor woman kindness, but I agree that she should probably drop it at this point. The man wants nothing to do with her, and the bit about “idk if you’re reading this but if you are you know” shows she’s still trying to contact him and talk him into getting back with her, despite him saying he’d prefer never to speak (which is what I like to do after a break up as well - speaking just makes it worse).
---
Oh ok sorry to bother
---
Yeah... And that usually means the course is compacted into a few short weeks of its over summer. Best of luck! When it comes to thermodynamics, just hit yourself with your book because I don't have a better solution for thermodynamics

Lol that is the biggest kick in the dick of all. I’ve never played rs3 in my life but the one time I do... I learned why you don’t.

Forcing his logins to only work from one ip address or internet "location" won't work and doesn't resolve the problem. This quite simply isn't a problem one can "just fix it duh". 
---
If you have a proposal for how you stop people from spam logging into one account feel free to voice it, but I wouldn't waste the brain power because you can't. You sound like some jackass manager who just refuses to acknowledge the concept of your demand being impossible.
---
Where did I seem "hell bent" on doing that? Where do I seem so fucking offended? Where are you getting all of this from?
---
But thanks for the strawman - you literally addressed none of my points and instead shifted the topic to me being this crazed lunatic that's advocating for people being coddled by Jagex as if they're parents trying to not have their kids be responsible for anything. 
---
Also: 200m isn't arbitrary. Yes they rounded it and yes you're right that they probably didn't expect people to achieve it - all the more reason that a 30m cap could be reasonable.
---
I think when I did the math it came out to 79%, and it would be a big enough sample size to be significant.
---
The only issue is that reddit tends towards "yes" on just about everything.  There are a ton of conservative players who either don't post here at all, or use the official forums, and they'll all be voting no.
---
I always want to do this, but I never have much food during Slayer. Sometimes I'll just grab my bulwark.
---
Not so much 1/4th of the population controlling updates, more like 1/4th. Because all we need are 1/4th of the population voting against it to not get an update.
---
Duradaddy and then do some profit snake
---
most of the people going for 200m all dont really hope theres a new method, because they enjoy the game how it is. but understand that it is most likely to have a new method because of how lots of casual players feel about the skill.
---
not everyone is like that though, a good number of top players do mining just because they enjoy it and want to though
---
Maybe it's worth a try opening the store via mobile and trying to subscribe to a monthly recurring membership. Iirc the trial is through Google play, giving you a week and then billing on the recurring option.
---
It's possible that you'll be signed up for the free week if you choose that. It should pop up before you confirm the subscription, so there should be no harm in trying
---
Anything with Ranged DEF or damage reduction, so stuff like DFS, Elysian, Dinh's, Suffering. And ofc using stuff like HP Cape/Rapid Restore + Regen Bracelet and Redemption if necessary to heal up the damage.
---

---
This is probably the only argument I don't get, you're gonna need to train a bunch of other undesirable skills for diaries and quests anyways, it's just another one on the pile. What sets it apart from other skills?
---
Or is it just a case of "I don't want to grind another skill I envision to be undesirable based on description"? Don't get me wrong -- I'm cool with all the other reasons and respect people that choose to vote no, I'm just playing devil's advocate for this specific argument.
---
If you have raw numbers available as they come in, it limits the kind of vote manipulation that could take place. You can't delete votes, as that will be readily apparent if the totals move backwards. Similarly, you can't just add votes for your favored result, as a sudden jump that doesn't correspond with normal player activity will be apparent. That leaves you with flipping votes as they are submitted, or ignoring/double counting votes for a specific result. You have to be careful with ignoring or double counting, as it could screw with vote totals. Players could still catch them in the act, especially if a small group of players coordinated their poll submission at a time when not many people are voting. 
---
This subreddit was obsessed that badwagoning was a thing, despite any concrete statistics backing it. Even if you are concerned with 3rd parties publishing results  and influencing weak-willed voters, you have to admit that they could just as easily be influenced by the consensus on communities like this sub.
---
Well I gotta say you sound really strong! I'm actually jealous on your way of handling things. I know that what I read here isn't everything that you feel and such and it's probably harder for you than it might look. But you seem to know just how to handle it right.
---
You'll definitely find someone who loves you as much as you love them. Someone who enjoys OSRS and is down-to-earth with full of love? Who doesn't want that? Haha! Good luck on your journey!

some concerns........

1.) what are these thing considered?

a.) Furries?
---
b.) Goth-furries?
---
c.) pretty sure I see a big titty goth girlfriend in there...
---
2.) Why are they acting like trolls under a bridge?
---
3.) The guy with the red forearms?
---
a.) Did he murder someone?
---
b.) Did he slit his own wrists?
---
c.) Did he participate in a sacrifice?
---
4.) The girl in the green tutu...
---
a.) She has a nice body.
---
b.) I bet she would look good in normal clothes.
---
5.) WTF

Theres alot of things going on in this post
---
You think those would be better than the sgs? Fury works pretty well I’m not too concerned with a 10% damage boost or whatever
---
That would be awesome! I forgot about the ages tbh. 
---
I think doing that would cause people to investigate the lore behind runescape more. I mean yes we have quests but they’re like necessary evils that we just click through and don’t read the dialogue. 
---
(I’m sure some people do pay attention to the lore, but the game is heavily based around gaining Xp for levels to do different things or to fight bosses, which takes away from the meaning of quests and learning lore)
---
To me it’s no different than standing under someone when they’re frozen, and I don’t have a problem with either. I think it’s easier to get a freeze on someone tree hugging than someone standing under you
---
I accidentally forgot to bank my cash stack doing a clue the other day. Level 50 wildly with 50m cash in my invent is pretty scary shit.
---
It would have devalued my click-to-log-in only ironman!
---
More like sorry Hey Jase, that's too much time.
---
I see thanks
---
Flexibility is an advantage. You can not argue against that without an argument that doesn't hold up whatsoever

---
zenytes are a good investment, could also do bgs if you want to grind vorkath with blow pipe and still have a lot left over, then you can start working your way to dhcb and/or rigour. im sure it has its uses but tbh you should just sell the regen bracelet as soon as you get barrows gloves if not before.
---
He got the better one tho, draconic doesnt cost shit
---
Yes, but the toxicity gets much worse when a major poll is happening, which is why I said that's the worst time to visit this sub
---
Just got a master clue with the step of doing a jig at the barrows chest in a full set of barrows. Do I also need barrows gloves for this step?
---
Vanilla client, f2p, regicide, and Windows 7 to top it ofd

You know, if you played with your screen less than 60 inches across its faster to click food/pots and back on target.

Took me 1.9k to get my black defender on a maxed pure using rapier.
---
Stupid weird rng sometimes
---
Also a more indirect way to prevent damage, but use the ground markers plugin on Runelite to mark where you have to chop/rake the roots that are in the way, so it's faster to navigate from one tree to the next.
---
The Runescape Forums were a shithole anyway
---
Fuck Tuffty
---

---
This is a really retarded idea once you realize that it's also balanced around the fact that there's gp/xp, xp/hr, buy limits, and a limited supply of the item. 
---
If you balance around gp/xp and buy limits, you end up with shit like Zamorak pages dissolving for like 100k xp in a tick, if you balance for xp/hr then the xp you get for dissolving each page would too insignificant to be worth it.
---
Killing pvmers in the wilderness is no different to grinding random pvm bosses. Except it's much more dynamic and less of a grind and an actual risk
---
You tricked him...
---
It was intended to help Jase recall who I am but I see now it was a message best sent in private obscure from judgement.
---
Which is especially silly because RuneScape is inherently embedded into nostalgic internet culture. It seems like itd be kind of expected that this game would get memed a lot on this site.
---
I still haven't done x marks the spot
---
That's a funny way to spell "east".
---
I mean it would help if you give us your stats haha
---
Probably! The defensive bonuses are basically the same, and the str/prayer bonuses of the neitz helm are quite useful!
---
Dynamic. Our scouting bot hops world to world until it registers certain colors and player levels. Me and the boys then pop in and kill a single person at rev caves with balistas. (while this is hyperbolic a majority of the time it's not a fair fight. And it should not be. )
---
True PVP is entirely at the whim of pvm. A fact that can be highlighted by content that has been driven in a direction that forces PVMers to always risk. PVMers don't have fun when content is old, PVPers don't have fun when their is no one to fight. So best thing to do is put new content in very dangerous areas.
---
Everyone without a poh
---
That goddamned runecrafting
---
Went 23k dry at Earth Warriors. That stuff hurts man
---
Theyve said before they tested bank limits and for a single bank this is about the max without making the game unstable
---
same..and i literally got it last week
---
Wack! We'll likely see a decrease in market prices for standard rings then. Imbued rings may be hot ticket items upon release tho.
---
delet this
---
Bury?
---
This kills the snail
---
People don't know if it's passing/failing, so they'll vote how they feel if they care.
---
Previously if everything was at 90+% or &lt;10% a lot of people wouldn't even bother voting how they feel.
---
It also impacts the people using bonds to alt-vote. Now that the results are hidden, people will still alt-vote, no matter the vote%. If something was at 90% yes, with the results shown, nobody would bond up an alt to vote Yes. (And swapped for no-voters as well.) With the results hidden, the alt-voters will feel pressured to vote, no matter what the % is at, since they can't see what it is.

Damn u made a meme before reading the blog 😂

I don't think you're membership card will work for OSRS, but that's more of a guess than based on anything.
---
I know the feeling. 5 years is tough but believe me one day you'll realise "hey I didn't think of him today" then suddenly you'll feel a weight off your chest and shoulders. I know the lack of closure is annoying. Usually in a break up its on some grounds where you can hate or at least accept what went wrong. In your case that isn't as easy but don't beat yourself up for it. I'm sure you're an awesome person!

lol wtf
---
The skill sound interesting and I really wish I was around when they polled it so I could learn more info about it. All I’ve heard about it is how people would rather that instead of warding but im just curious what they had planned for this skill? Were they thinking of adding any sort of pvp like pillaging other people or clans boats or was it strictly getting point a to point b. I like the idea of it, but i feel like with access to teleports and charter ships already it could be a little redundant if theres no action! Then again i wasnt around when it was originally polled and dont have the time at the moment to dig deeper into the ideas of it which is why im on reddit lol
---
Most of them were against it to from what I seen, esp on the qna
---
Thale vibe I got was that the higher ups were pushing it
---
I would get to questing right away. The wiki has the optimal quest guide if you're really shooting for efficiency, but just doing the ones that sound interesting is also a fine way to go about it. Do herb/birdhouse runs on the side for some easy cash. Easy diaries are also a good initial goal which can orient you and show you some of the stuff you may not touch for a while
---
Ur free to offend again
---
You don't, you just gotta wait for him to respawn
---
I always sent coins and had no issues with it
---
Damn, you got super lucky
---
Do herb and birdhouse runs, toadflax is plenty profitable at 38 farming
---
You cut off "extreme". Mild flexibility is an advantage. You're doing everything in your power to misrepresent my arguments while giving no counter-arguments of your own.
---
If it's wrong and there is an advantage to owning the entire roster, let me hear it.
---
I always imagined this is what Second Life players looked like
---
Hey man, I know that feel. Recently out of pure boredom (my job has me work really hard half of the year then the other half is pretty chill) I decided to download Steam and TF 2 like 11 years later. Everyone (of course) moved on and all the old forums I used to visit were dead. It was like looking at a graveyard.
---
Add me: "ThisMuchDad"
---
I would also say you could look to join some clan chats of pvm clans
---
Normies reeeeeeeeeeee
---
I actually have that option from Thessailia. Since the Void Elite top has "sleeves", they overwrite the Arms option (unlike sleeveless tops like Dhide bodies)
---
Oh yeah, true. Also probably can't do ZMI because the mobs hit too hard. RC to 77 sounds really shitty on a skiller now that I think about it.
---
Do a daily farm run/birdhouse run and you'll get them leveled up in no time
---
Ackshually, the closest fairy ring is the one in your POH, but yeah, this one is "free."
---
Nobody said anything was more profitable,  just that the exchange rate was fair because of how easy it is to obtain money on rs3, even more so with a maxed account .
---
Probably had it set as 0000

Appreciate the reply. I’m assuming this won’t be a fix or code that jagex can implement then to increase QoL for mobile users then.
---
&gt;That was six years ago
---
The decline of rs2 in to rs3 happened over multiple years through many changes.
---
A bad one
---
Yeah because you totally get no other rewards from completing every quest in the game
---
I've been trying to explain this to someone on Tumblr who is convinced their vote is devalued if other people are voting on alts. It's a drop in the lake. Even if it could sway the poll, I'm sure jagex would step in and realize the poll system is broken if it could. But it can't. Maybe a handful of people are using more than 1-3 alt accounts for extra votes, and that's fair. They're buying bonds/membership with their own money. If jagex really cared about alts they would have changed how voting works entirely.
---
I read the blog. Apparently not thoroughly enough though.
---
I don't trust these numbers honestly.
---
Came here for this.
---
I actually remember watching a video abhor this. There's a certain time of day when bot farms do dumps and if you catch it at the right time you can get a lot of resources for cheap.
---
it stays mounted but you can't use the teleport, I believe. Mine's just been sitting there for over a year
---
Nope looked it up online and everything just to make sure
---
It’s not your range or gear, you just need to learn vorkath. I just did ds2 on my ironman and did 10 vorkath kills with rcb, dhide, and no salve, and I didn’t run out of food in any of those, even though kills were super long.
---
Just use google, I think it takes like 50 seconds to do a lap, if so it would take 12.75 days of play time assuming he is right with 22k laps.
---
No, BGS is better than DWH there
---
Laps are 45 seconds, or 38 seconds if at the end of the lap you teleport to Seers bank instead of running. Obviously you’d progress through the courses tho and not stay there the whole time. Summer pie from 85 agility to do Ardougne course (90 req)

So thats multi...

you are not.

dont do it

Thank you for explaining but just so you know the /s is supposed to mean humor aka i tried to make a bad joke.
---
I usually just trap flambeed behind a melee boss and blowpipe him.
---
so you're a bitch or ?
---
I think it's irrelevant if they're noobs or not, if they've met the prerequisite of minimum level ( however low it is) and have paid for/ earned membership they should have a say. What is relevent is one person getting 5-10 votes because his main is maxed and has the cash to throw at multiple atls to see the result they want.
---
Might aswell just bring back EOC aswell then
---
I imagine they might nerf blowpipe for some jmod's shitty quest
---
Bwananas
---
It's impossible to even feel remotely bad for someone who does this. Dude has like 10x my bank and 1/10th of my game sense somehow

I feel like there would be less opposition to the content Warding would bring than the skill itself. Most players don't mind most of the content being offered; it is where it is coming from that is the issue. If Warding passes, I think most will accept that and realize that it doesn't benefit the game to vote against additional content for it (unless the content is harmful to the game of course). Though some will likely spite vote anything releated to Warding.
---
Mixup your grinding, don’t focus solely on one thing.  That’s a quick way to burn out.

I like to suck dick

What country are you from where you get punished and *then* have to prove your innocence lol. It doesn’t work like that in the real world. I’m not sure what you claiming to be the POTUS has to do with anything.

I see you like the runescape rape pvp videos too
---
actually it is well made

Training some Slayer with the shiny new fire cape I got last night :) getting closer to looking like a true Slayer Chad!

Like warding :D

OSRS on one screen then PH on the other. Or side by side on the same screen

I believe the first time I did this I actually mailed it without a stamp (because I didn't know what it was and slapped a return address label on it thinking that was the stamp) but still got the membership. I tried it again but nothing happened (not even returned for no postage) RIP the 60 dollars I mailed. I think the third time I did it I got the return for no postage and finally learned about stamps.
---
Filling the collection log for clues would only take a few hundred thousand hard clues, another few hundred thousand elite clues, and then all of the master clues you got from those hards and elites, and then you would have to go and do probably another few hundred thousands master clues as well.
---
Doing all of the Mimics would help speed up the process, but I'm not sure how much.
---
Yeah I got Dragon Axe at Wintertodt 38 kc. My luck is insane in this account. My main never had luck like this in 10 years of me playing Runescape.
---
I mean i like multi pk but in this post im talking bout single pkers lmfao
---
No regardless the cape is lost on death in wild even if ur naked and unskulled. Say you have a zammy imbued cape and you die with it. You just have to kill the zammy boss again not all 3.
---
I thought I quit like really quit when osrs first released... got my nostalgia and all but then my computer broke and I was on a potato comp but what game still works? Yeah it's impossible to quit now I have almost 100M xp
---
Did they poll whether or not we even wanted a skill?
---
So im guessing no one ever has been sent to jail even though being innocent? Grow a brain
---
Leprechauns do note grimy herbs.
---
Yeah, go single bro its easy to find singles and roast them. If you can't handle that stick to pvp worlds
---
Yeah Smithing is basically forever screwed.
---
Have fun my friend. Don't forget to quest!
---
ok, side thought, what about Zamorak halo, or decorative top? in lets say lvl 45 wild skulled.  
---
Can u get with coins again, or u need to get entire CW tickets?
---
I'd say you are going too far.
---
I do think there are more no voters without a valid reason to vote no than there are yes voters that don't have a valid reason to vote yes, but "summing up" one of the sides like that just help the circlejerk to continue.
---
Has 10M cash stack at level 22 combat from spending 5 days at wintertotd
---
I feel this is a pretty common sentiment for most new content. Kourend is a good example; at the time it wasn't a Kingdom, but just a City (a really oversized city). Lot of players were saying it didn't have enough content, and while a lot of that was likely due to the size issue, it still offered a ton more than most other cities in the game. Even if you just compared each house to other cities, they still offered a fair amount of unique content. So there is somewhat of an expectation that new content will be oversaturated without realizing that is how it would compare to other content.
---
It genuinely is. There are so many little things with classic like fucked parts of the UI. The fact there were just many bugs in the final patch they are basing it off of got pushed back to 2.0 for the first expansion launch. Hundreds of little things that have absolutely 0 effect on gameplay or anything.
---
Yet none of that will be changed or fixed because the community threw and absolute shitstorm at the sign of ANY even slight change. If it isn't exactly how they left it then it's not right.
---
If I'm doing something grindy I put up netflix or youtube on my side monitor.

It's only an unpopular opinion in this echo chamber, people who played pre eoc generally enjoyed dungeoneering and summoning it they tried it. Too many people on this sub either quit during that time frame or never leveled enough to see the value/couldnt afford it. Summ and dungeoneering are grouped in with eoc when you post here
---
I am not, but regardless the account i use the most is affected by it.
---
Not sure on that one. I’m assuming they’re like the other untradables and break below 20 but don’t quote me
---
Oof that’s a dirty one but his fault!
---
No no, they're gunna "fuck kill" a person named "self"

Hahaha ty
---
Did you sync your last mini-song up to the head bob of the dead guy?
---
Here's to hoping Warding will fail.
---
How’d you think people wouldn’t notice?
---
Idk how aside from cannoning which isnt marginal enough to get 99 slayer before level 4 combat
---
 How many brothers fell victim to the streets?  
---
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death

Mate don't you know you can't post a good brainlet meme right now if it's not circlejerking Warding?

Jokes aside this is great.

Poor self!

Firemaking is a mini game

so because mining is empty we should have another skill that is empty?  Sorry i didnt have the option to vote no to mining....

Average of 7 hours a day spread over a bunch of years, it's his income as well. He enjoys it, makes money doing it, has a healthy social life. Do you feel sorry for everyone with a full-time job?
---
You’re delusional
---
Hope they decide to revamp/expand this whole Sailing idea and poll it again after  Warding grows up a little in-game.
---
are you comparing small gp drops under 1k to statues that bring in 1m+?
---
Dueling rings
---
I’m comparing the absurd amount of alchables that slayer brings in to the statues

Couldn’t you just hop, move to that tile and hop back to said world?

---
Just camp zammy boss one for like an hour, I did and got about 7-8 capes
---
It was hard for me to realize but the time i'm not looking at the screen is just too much and if a game requires me to have something on the side because it is too boring otherwise then i shouldn't play it.
---
OSRS is, sadly, a very long grind and a very easy one at that, what you do at the start doesn't really change from what you are doing at the end and the grind is probably what you'll be doing 90% of the time.
---
Make sure you arent picking items up that will protect over defender
---
It's more of an argument that so many things already use it. Not that it looks bad and isn't likable.
---
Which one has to know before they get a fire cape! But I was only referring to what the video was showing
---
Youee super fricken lucky
---
Total kc for me (had 2weeks between school and work) :
---
 - 1200 goblins
---
 - 600 lessar demons
---
 - 900 earth warriors
---
 - 1100 jogre
---
 - 14500 ghouls (lucky streak ran out)
---
 - 3500 giants
---
 - 3500 hobgoblins
---
 - 7000 zombies
---
 - 1000 skeletons 
---
(Work started) 
---
 - 9000 imps (took 2 weeks so i kept track by number of potions looted, 1/128 drop)
---
If i had to guess id say 105k cannonballs and 150 hours. About 1.4m total damage done. Went from 37-82 ranged and 67-79 mage. Started at 59 cb am now 71. Got pked 1 time at earth warriors as a level 63 on a 1250 world where i used a cannon in trips of 500 cballs but melee instead of mage. Mage costed i think an extra several mil in chaos runes. Didnt take too many breaks over the month it took. pretty much straight through. cause i dont have a 99 and wanted a cape before i did anything else.
---
Thanks for nothing
---
Smart artists save their templates for future suggestions.
---
Right click follow and walk here is extremely specific to Runescape. 
---
Runescape is one of the few mmos that uses click to walk and the follow/ walk here options are as far as I know only found on Runescape and maybe guild wars?? Not too sure about GW I forgot if it uses WASD or click to walk
---
Keys? Thanks!
---
There was no Zulrah helper controversy. Jagex asked Adam to remove the plugin and he did.
---
The shutdown controversy happened 4 months later, they were completely unrelated.
---
Shit, at that point I'd just get confused and walk off to go click rocks for seven hours.
---
Is that hosidius favour or...?
---
im one of those people that dont want a skill to come into the game that is only beneficial to those who have 40 magic.  A new skill effects me, if i am going to be forced to train it i want to have some use out of it, even more so if i am going to have to drop 40 hours and almost 600m into it to hit 99.
---
What if I get burned out by level 71? 85?
---
Something that is still in the game, but I would unfortunately consider dead content is Sorceress’s Garden. Its a pretty simple way to train thieving and a little farming in the desert before going south of the shantay pass. I honestly prefer it so some of the afk methods like ardy knights. I couldnt stand just sitting there spam clicking those dudes. Especially once you get to the final garden, i believe 50 something thieving required, you can get the guards lined up properly to 1 click through the whole garden without being caught by them making it still seemingly afk
---
Every minute spent on warding is too much effort.. having templates doesn't matter.
---
The guy on bottom write has the handwriting of an 11 year old. How embarrassing ..
---
Yeah everyone knows that
---
70 is less than 10% of 99
---
I moments like that. Most of mine were wildy lucky/unlucky. Peep my kcs on his first post.
---
it literally has zero content for me on release...
---
they're discussing how if you log onto a world, you wont see previous drops. But you DO see your own previous drops.
---
I dont disagree. But jagex never showed what that minigame would even look like. Somehow people still voted yes to sailing which is just astounding.
---
&gt;I like your ign, I think it's creative
---
thanks.
---
Siknesz is available, too. That was one I used for a diff game
---
Best reference ever
---
I've read what you replied to someone else and you explained it a lot better there. You're actually right but the way you explained it in this comment was pretty bad haha
---
You're probably correct. I'll see if I can find it again and verify one way or the other
---
Correct! Regular void with the salve EI is better. The accuracy buffs alone will make a huge difference. As long as you are walking during acid phase you will not be hit. What I do is find an area about 8-10 tiles clear and click the other end of it and eat while I walk, then go back.
---
I can second this, it’s a game changer.
---
Underrated comment right here
---
Did benji change to benjo or is this a FAKE
---
I agree. I mean we all did it with our combat stats at castle wars. what's the problem.
---
You don't work 7 hours a day at your job?
---
When are they going to fix the damn chat bar. If you want to type, I think you should have to tap your name instead of that long ass bar I always misclick. I know I can hide the chat box but then I cant see drops
---
Actually crazy, if nothing else you got very lucky on Lessers and EWs while the others more easy to cannon took a bit longer. Good on you for sticking it out through the Ghouls and Imp dry spells, fellow Champion 👍
---
Actually I wouldn’t really say anything, cause it’s not my business or my life. 🤷‍♂️ just accept the fact that you don’t know what’s best for everyone. And if people don’t ask, they don’t care to hear you preach.
---
Halfway to maxing
---
Nobody should be voting on any polls to "please the devs", that completely defeats the purpose of polling content in the first place.
---
UIM is a perfectly fine way to play, that requires a serious time-commitment (and a lot of patience). 
---
To Viperec's point, it is sometimes hard to imagine anybody wanting to grind hours of undesirable content when there are (to some) more enjoyable ways to spend one's available gaming time.   
---
From an economy of time standpoint, UIM has to either make you real money (ala  swampletics/settled) or produce real gaming joy and entertainment for you, because otherwise it can be a real downer and rough ride, and therefor wasted time.   
---
I would suggest anybody interested in an level of ironman mode play normally first.
---
Or just use runescape and max your efficiency.
---
I don’t need to decided since it clear as day 😂
---
Hitting a monster the tick it spawns doesn’t give xp due to a mechanic that prevents monster “tick-eating”
---
(Horse neigh) i learned that today!
---
Really? this same format has been on the front page for like a year now
---
You mean you disagree with the figures?
---
I’m actually wondering why Fletching isn’t closer to 0 EHP.
---
Hehe Psych “ward”. I see what you did there!
---
Except that's not true at all read the blog kid
---
there is way more to warding than just "bankstanding"
---
Go for different elite diary skill reqs(obviously the lower tier requirements first). I’m keeping the grinding from getting boring by changing it up a lot. For example recently I’ve been switching between RC, thieving, fishing, then I’ll do some bossing for fun and repeat
---
A hypocrite has to actually do what goes against their beliefs
---
There is a difference between "I would do it if I were you" and "I do it too, but I also complain when it happens to me"
---
You can follow people in WoW too
---
Dear lord how much profit from this many ?
---
nah super defense or bastion pot dont help much, just use ranging pot + eagle eye and u should be good, especially since dhcb with ruby and diamond bolts shit on vork
---
are u using an extended super anti-fire? all u should be taking damage from are the mage attacks. 
---
another small tip is if u cant really click the spawn very well with ur crumble undead, just bring a slayer staff and set it to autocast crumble undead. just switch to ur slayer staff and click until u manage to click the spawn. not really needed but it helps if u lag or are on mobile.
---
Congrats innit
---
They were both pretty bad kid. Glad they aren't in my game anymore
---
Implying the 76 RC isn't the big showstopper.
---
That would be insane if he hasn't
---
That's the vibe the entire community got. 
---
The company "Platinum Fortune" purchased Jagex from the Chinese. With just a bit of research, platinum fortune are a very aggressive sale tactic company who focus on short to medium term equity investments within businesses regardless of the long term effects.
---
Basically, they want to rush mtx or other profitable methods into the game to later sell the company once its value has increased enough.
---
We're basically being marched on the ge.
---
Interesting
---
i was told the master book is VERY rare in medium clues :)
---
I’ve always wondered what the loot was from 104 of them, but never 106.
---
I guess technically but you don’t right click the player you click on the player and right click the icon. The walk here/ follow option is really what I’m focusing on. I don’t know another game that has those on the right click of a player.
---
emulate android?
---
LOL!
---
Lmao, when the xp efficiency starts going down, we all know what needs to be done to bring it back up!
---
Omg how dumb can you get. 35 skill level is NOT 1/3rd of the way lmaoooooo. Who is this kid where did we find him??
---
Also being a millionaire is basically nothing, LOADS of people on this game have green cash stacks (10m+) and I mean LOADS
---
Nice try, but no cigar. Your battery state left you vulnerable to being triangulated once you plug it in to charge. GG
---
İts average 150k per kill so that should be around 4B
---
:(
---
That’s not always the case. You got lucky.
---
I'd like to have a ward with you about your choice
---
If you checked it over its goo for everyone who has 70 magic as one of the armors offered is better than ahrims
---
Gratz man !
---
Giant Vole
---
It also takes way longer to get 1-92 than 92-99
---
Just remember! For every one crazy rng post on here, theres thousands of people just like you and me wondering when we’ll get to be the one to post our crazy rng for something. Our time will come my friend I promise! Congratz OP by the way!
---
It does though, i got perma banned back in 2010 for botting after two offenses. That account is unbanned now.
---
No you protect from range with dhcb. With dhcb you have all Dragonfire protection covered so you pray range to stop those attacks and only tank mage.
---
I think you misunderstood what I said. Warding isn't out of place. The legitimate uses of it for non ironmen feel like they are. Rune pouch and essence pouch upgrades, and dissolving, which really is only going to be used while training the skill.
---
But really what does EOC stand for
---
Didnt even realize that doing legends quest for that was a thing...
---
That is true
---
This is what I was looking for. Thanks mate
---
why do npcs have a small brain? kind of redundant
---
Ohhh that makes sense! I cant afford the dhcb so i just used the tbp. Im guessing thats why its switched up a bit! Thank you for the clarification!
---
They polled it though, and it didn't pass, so it didn't get added to the game. That's the key difference, they didn't poll EoC, they didn't poll the MTX in RS3... With OSRS they do... Everyone makes mistakes, I never said Jagex doesn't or won't ever make mistakes, I said they have learned from their previous enormous mistake that was RS3, and wont fuck up OSRS. Why is this so difficult for you to understand lol.
---
Ugly
---
Sailing minigame you mean
---
Yeah, i don’t know if the wiki is just incorrect or what. I’ve never got the shield left half or anything else specified as having started legends quest as a requirement though.
---
I voted yes on my main and alt, I think this game needs more interesting content. People who want the game to be the exact same it was in 2007 and never ever ever change should just go play on a private server.
---
Use dhide, much easier to replace if something happens.
---
Not like woodcutting is that much more involved
---
I don't really get why you would pick a color based on which color isn't in the game yet, when there already are multiple skillcapes in the game that have a very similar color. Also, your colorwheel gives magenta as an option, but after adding saturation you have come to the conclusion that it's too close to the purple thieving skillcape. Therefore I personally think your method/system is flawed.
---
Your theory really didn't need the extremely long aesthetically pleasing explanation that you posted either, but hey, at least it gets some easy upvotes!
---
Sorry for the salty opinion.
---
it literally does something though
---
botting is a special case cuz you can get permed for a first offense, but back in the day when you got muted every 2 weeks the length of the mute would reduce when older ones expired
---
i just wanted to make a joke  and now i got fucked for it,  my uncle was right man. he told me  "your going to get fucked one way or another,  wouldnt you rather have me do it? being we are family rather than some stranger on reddit"?     i'm giving my uncle a call   you guys are mean    i know who my true friend is now
---
Selling tinfoil hats 10m
---
That was a good choice. SGS is nice but I don't think it's worth it. My bank is 4b and I don't own one.
---
Champion cape grind was practically the first thing I did after 3 ticking red chins in the diary hideout for 2 weeks straight from 80 to 12M XP and it was a detour grind from where I otherwise would have done Tithe Farm
---
Lol, I like that everyone commenting is assuming I voted for the opposite of the side they support.
---
(Horse neigh)
---
Are you kidding me with this bullshit? Warding as a concept was announced at runefest in 2018. The purchase by platinum fortune just happened June 2019. To say they have a hand in pushing warding is fucking asinine. Take your bullshit propaganda elsewhere.
---
It’s never the same spot, but don’t be afraid to walk through a pool to get to a safe spot. That like 5-10 damage is a lot better than one of his fire balls.
---
Depends on how expensive the materials to make the armors will be. The components to make the gear might end up being just as expensive,  or more, as ahrims
---
Magic is done through slayer and it all assumes you have alts to pay for runners etc.
---
55% btw
---
&gt; and you already craft ranged leather armour through Crafting so putting robes into it disrespects the game's skill design.
---
You know crafting already has robes right?
---
I'm assuming money isn't an issue tho
---
In the words of Darth Vader. “Noooooo!!!!”
---
Have you read the updated blog? It’s mainly made by players’ suggestions, it ain’t half bad
---
One of the earlier renditions of warding stated that the imbued rings would become tradable, i believe that was changed and it would now be an additional method to NMZ for imbues
---
Evolution of combat, the update that marked the change from rs2 to rs3.
---
Not sure if /s
---
Sara brews are so useful because it heals alot per invo slot combined with a super restore.
---
"Hush you fucking vennie" lul
---
Experience tranquility

Cowards afraid of downboats and r slash woosh. Can't hurt the internet points
---
so downvote it and move on :shrug:
---
Evolution of combat
---
That’s not the question.
---
Well buyable skills are all artisan skills and without artisan skills youre not gonna have a point to gatherer skills (like how hunter is useless), so at that point you dont have many more options for skills you can put into the game. Plus were not adding it just to add it, we have a good place to put it this one in mage gear and as a complement to hunter.
---
If I dont save the wee Crabs who will?
---
“Bored of having new skills to train” which new skills though? There haven’t been any skills added to osrs yet.
---
&lt;3
---
Lol so did you not read "near max"? Please consult me about being lazy after you've put thousands of hours into this game through high school and college. I'll finally max and can walk away from this game come graduation but surprise I've got more to do now. Not everybody has time to sit on their ass all day long and play this game anymore. I've got other shit I have to do now (like work full time and graduate college) so no, I don't want to get 99 in another skill. How about you stop pretending like you know anything about anybody online and keep your ignorant bullshit to yourself.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Dark souls 2 has great PvP compared to the other two imo (until you get to higher level pvp where people abuse certain mechanics). Singleplayer wise I thought it was fine, but it is the worst in the series in terms of immersion and design.
---
Best way to kill Jad for a beginner
---
give me a hug friend
---
Okay then no one uses it for high level bossing because you need to stay at a high hp to maintain high DPS and sammy lowers both hp and def therefore you would need to constantly eat.
---
There's no doubt about it, this is definitely karma whoring
---
The person in the back with the green dreads. Realizing how ridiculous this all was.
---
this is justiciar material
---
Yeah we get it, you want to get the karma so you posted this before it even happened? GG
---
Ball out!
---
Looking at the minimap, i think the mining pet belongs to the person south of you, and the reason it is next to you was that it got stuck while trying to path to its owner.
---
They're not talking aboth warding there guy. Take a moment and breath.
---
If it makes you feel better I spent all of 30 seconds looking for separate line and fill colors on the text tool before realizing high quality images are xp waste
---
Reeeeeeee
---
I've seen it used it tob very rarely, so there's at least one use.
---
I believe he is talking about the partnership poll
---
You don't need the mini quests for the cape
---
Well dayum not number 1 in anything 
---
Feelsbad
---
Jesus Christ.
---
And you can't have cosmetics that hide your gear right?
---
I just enabled stretched mode on runelite and now my icons that are able to be dragged around by pressing alt are huge, such as the total xp counter and the minigame teleport timer. How do i resize them?
---
When you log out do items that are only visible to you stay on their timer instead of just showing up?
---
CK2 went through a phase where this happened a lot.
---
Because buying a company is like going to your local gas station and picking up a candy bar. Acquisitions take a ton of fucking time. It's possible that a buying company can have influence before the contracts are signed.
---
The only thing worse then someone spreading propaganda is someone spreading uninformed bullshit.
---
I added that right after I posted comment, meaning you must've pretty much instantly started a reply and it took you 12 mins to put it together lmao. The only person who has deleted their comment is you. You don't even know the difference between editing and deleting?
---
Yes because you are a hypocrite. You choosing to pick a certain definition on the internet that sort of fits your narrative of what a hypocrite is laughable kid.
---
If an action is not 1:1 it is bannable. Basicly if you click your mouse once and it sends 10 clicks that is bannable but you can remap keys so say instead of hiting right click you hit your right trigger on the remote as long as clicking the right trigger on clicks 1 time
---
Gl, you're going to be eaten alive.
---
You will be fine. People use foot pedals. Don't see how this is any different.
---
Yeah you wont get banned most likely but its player run so its a small risk you get scammed if you dont do ur hw. Most have a legit business doing swaps and wouldnt tarnish theyre reputation on smaller (casual players) banks when they deal with much larger amounts of gp
---
Not a skill. You can add sailing as a content update though, it would work better that way anyway. Tie it in with other existing skills, like construction and smithing.
---
So 71?
---
*please say yes*
---
Hello, I am burned out on training my RC. I've been consistently training for a few hours per day for around 4 months now. Can you give me any tips? 
---
In the next few days I should hit level 2.
---
You should do 10 herb 5 maple, herbs are always difficult to come by on an iron. Always max herbs 
---
You can change maple to teaks later on for construction. Or coal if you need to do smithing.
---
Sum ting wong
---
It's actually more involved probably
---
Yeah, I could've kept magenta in the running. The skillcape color wheel showed that there were way too many capes the hovered around the "brown-orange-yellow" hemisphere. So I chose something that was completely different. 
---
When posting your opinion online, I've seen it's better to over explain than under. It gives people less of a chance to easily dismiss your points.
---
Do people not know about Arc Library? It was nerfed but it's still pretty damn good for casual RC xp...
---
How so?
---
That's how it wouldn't pass. Too much division regarding a new skill already these days/this year due to Warding itself.
---
A better moment would be somewhere next year.
---
Back when the game was actually old school, jagex added skills like hunter and construction and I can guarantee you that almost all players back then were not maxed out.
---
Eh. When it's blatant and in your face it kinda spoils whatever activity I'm doing. And it's not like it doesn't impact the community too when it's happening en mass. I want to feel like I'm working with or against other players engaging in the same activity. I don't want to feel like my "peers" when I'm catching chins are lines of code.
---
Yeah, Galvek is a safe death. That said, d’hide might still be better dps depending on your ranged level.
---
Not really, DPS is almost always preferred (kill the monster faster and you take less damage in the end).
---
Woah, I didn’t even reply to you. You’re an extra nerd.
---
she also gave the cat vodka
---
The world is one big mini game
---
Takes more than 4 days
---
Lmao yikes
---
I've seen none of these arguments except it's just another buyable, which it entirely is.  People aren't so against a new skill, but if it's just another boring bankstanding skill what do you expect lol
---
Cool analysis man.
---
Those colors are ugly as shit.
---
They will just keep repolling until it passes.

It's not a meme it's a genuine suggestion
---
Yes, attas plants will increase the yield of any farming patch that does not have a fixed yield (fruit tree patches always yield exactly 6 fruit regardless of any bonuses, for example)

I don’t see how the best tv method is unlocked so early with lavas, it’s ridiculous

Lol boat meets

Good work on the post as everyone else said, but I agree that your cape and icon color you chose is ugly. Sorry.    
---
I think the purple or magenta looks better in every way.
---
I have seen many of such bots, but still don't k ow how this scam works.
---
What are you planning for longterm? You'll burn out sooner or later from pvm considering the huge shift it is from mostly/purely skilling, in mindset as well as in grind.
---
that's more than one thing

holding down to keep clicking repeatedly is a macro, dont use it.

---
Fletching, Cooking, Firemaking, and Farming all have profitable options that are nearly equal or equal in speed to the costly methods. Chins and bursting can pay for themselves. In my opinion, the only true buyables are Prayer, Construction, Herblore, and Crafting. Prayer and Construction have invaluable perks. That leaves us with Herblore and Crafting, and honestly, does anybody enjoy those skills?
---
The wiki is wrong for sure.
---
lol, was checking to see if he'd edited his last comment, since he claimed that's why I didn't see a part of the last one
---
Oof, sounds like you failed poetry
---
Or they're fucking around
---
No rune pouch either.. more bothered by all the above than the whip luck
---
Not sure i'd refer to the blowpipe as non-intrusive lol.
---
Exactly. Purple represents magic/royalty. Just because there are other purple things doesn't mean Warding can't be purple as well.
---
Hey, man you don’t gotta explain to me.
---
I thought it was just ths shield that required Legends.  Other possibilites: Maybe it's not your drop. Maybe they failed to code some new NPCs properly.
---
Was definitely my drop, not only was no one else around, it shows up in my collection log. But the first or third point of yours is what I was thinking as well.
---
pretty sure the amount of runes you would need is a full inv so that means you'd have to drop carry the soups and runes to have enough to make the water runes.
---
Mod Ash?...I don't feel so good.
---
Sad.

Is lms still in beta? Might give it a try if it is

Isn't RC buyables as well with runners?

My Android can play OSRS for at least 24 hours

yeah Im just bored af

lmao if u do all ur work under a vpn and a virtual machine you wont get caught
---
When facing any undead with melee you should go with nezzy + salve (unless you need nosepeg/ear muffs/slayer helm).
---
However, I do recommend getting void (elite if you can) and imbuing your salve eventually.  They are all very useful.  For example, the best setup for vorkath involves elite void range and salve (ei).
---
Anyway, anything that isn't undead just stick to good ol' slayer helm and fury.  Have fun slaying!
---
Fury + Warrior = +10 Stab/Crush/Range/Mage, +14(+18) Slash, +8 Str Bonus, +5 Prayer Bonus, +15 defensives (+19/+23 Slash Defense)
---
Glory + Zerker = +10 Stab/Slash/Crush/Range/Mage, +10(+14) Strength Bonus, +3 Prayer Bonus, +3 Defensives. 
---
I'd go Glory + Zerker if Accuracy and defense doesn't matter for what you do. Otherwise, the former
---
Prior to getting 99 hunter I had barely touched it and only leveled it briefly for requirements. It was basically a new skill to me when I got it to 99.
---
I do:   
---
- Kingdom Management  
---
- NMZ herb boxes  
---
- Battlestaffs  
---
- Ogre Arrows  
---
- Bowstring  
---
- Dynamite  
---
- Sand (auto-deposit to bank)  
---
So... pretty much everything except for lame stuff like the free essence and runes. I’m a slave to my dailies &amp; herb/birdhouse runs!
---
I'm pretty sure you can quest to 60 attack. Either way, if your end goal is a maxed account get 99 fish first then you'll have like 77 str

---
This is solid advice. I agree
---
I'm talking about the Partnership Poll my man.
---
But now I'm imagining some crazed osrs player who owns Platinum Fortune buying out the entire company just to add Warding haha.
---
Sure, especially Hunter. Which was implemented in 2008, after the 2007 backup that made OSRS - but it was then included into OSRS too.
---
I think the majority would be for Warding: there are now lots of people who play not out of nostalgy, but just because OSRS is really a good game. For itself, in other words.
---
But on the other hand, even if the majority is for Warding, it probably won't pass. Because it doesnt need to me a majority (which would be 51% or more), it needs 75% and no less. And this is probably too much...
---
Sailing failed at 68% which also was a majority. But still a fail.
---
?
---
I fucking hate these posts
---
mother of pearl
---
You don't even go here
---
You’re apparently killing vorkath with your life
---
If sailing was a skill, I'd think smth like similar to the uncharted isles would be nice.
---
Umm, the current trend right now is deflation because of the lack of item sinks. So inflation is good for OSRS right now.
---
Mole skins stop at 250 so heads are probably the same
---
Pretty sure it's how long the punishment will be, Once all offences are expired it's like your first offence again.
---
These are examples but say active offences:
---
* 1 offence = 48 hours
---
* 2 offences = 72 hours
---
* 3 offences = 1 week
---
* 4 offences = 2 weeks
---
etc.
---
Warding could potentially work a few others, perhaps less than a quarter of my examples. However, when you're pushing for a new skill, it makes no sense to insert one that overlaps in various established places, threatens to takes content from existing skills and slaps a new level lock on them, and denies the opportunity to flesh out those already existing skills.
---
Is there any more videos out there of these.. things?
---
I've gotten good at keeping the rhythm of ticks while wacking it to really keep efficient.
---
Legend has it he finally escaped the dreamworld he walks among the few that found a way out of the simulation, his name is NEO !
---
To personify the comparison, one one side there’s Alkan and the other side Suomi.
---
No crumble undead?
---
Probably not since you sell the equipment back afterwards, but having more money definitely helps with those skills for what thats worth (ik its not much)
---
No, you've already done the emote in the dudes house
---
runescape is a rhythm game
---
And also about the icon design, it **must** be changed. 
---
**Examples:**

I honestly don't know how anyone would think the current color scheme is better than the cape in this post. The stupid ass purple looks like something a 12 year old would put in their private server.
---
Just got it last night
---
If I don't get 6 hour logged I'll be disappointed.
---
I would get 90 in both and maybe go for elite void.
---
Half the people on here claim to have botted 99 mage I swear
---
I thought it was funny until I noticed the fish face.. then it got really funny.
---
&gt;not wanting a new skill that doesn't even sound fun to train
---
Runecrafting..
---
&gt;includes items that could easily be added to existing skills
---
Lets just use the entire concept of making and imbuing magic armor, and PUSH it to crafting.
---
Ring of suffering would help you save food too
---
And most people don't care about your opinion.
---
Have fun being 1 of 100000 voices just like everyone else, lmao.

Dam OP had a family man
---
Here, have my uvote for your honesty. No idea why people downvote you. It's not like you are avoiding responsibility or complaining.
---
no one asked normie
---
gz you overthank it and maid it uglier
---
Is this is last update in the game I would be happy
---
I play wow often, and from Blizzard’s perspective, perm bans make people just create a new account to do the same offense, whereas a temp ban gives the person enough incentive to wait it out, thus decreasing the amount of botters at any given time.  Im sure this applies to osrs as well to some extent.
---
That's hot
---
Or if you’ve a gaming mouse, also map to buttons on the mouse.
---
Shoulda used dhides cause this skill is pretty much crafting 2.0
---
What's the value on that KC?
---
Thanks to this post I now know why Warding seems so off to me... It's the freaking skill icon! The icon doesn't even feel Old School.
---
With other skill icons, they either give a decent idea of what the skill is about (e.g.  Ranged, Magic, Construction, Slayer, Firemaking etc) or they look pretty jank but you *could barely* guess what the skill is about (e.g. Runecrafting, Fletching, Strength). 
---
The Warding icon doesn't fit in with the rest of the skill icons. If I show the icon to my non-existent gf and ask "What do you think this skill is called?" I would probably get a reply of "?????". 
---
I honestly think the icon should be reworked and probably play off the channelling lamps within the skill. I honestly the wards themselves are a too abstract of a concept to use as the icon for the skill. My reasoning is that Smithing has the anvil, Crafting has the chisel and hammer and thus Warding should incorporate the channelling lamp (and possibly vis).
---
Super helpful as with all these comments, i definitely feel a little better now and am going to be trying again very soon.
---
The 1:1 reasoning does make sense, good points but I’ll probably still to f1-f4 for now
---
He lives in NY what do you expect. 😭
---
I’ve just always wanted for years more heraldric stuff like other people have posted maybe if this gets a mod reply and upvotes it would gain some dev attention, not a hard addition either or game breaking
---
Id go back to void setup and snag an occult and necklace swap huge dps increase since most of ur damage comes from mage
---
Meant 8 percent, fixed.
---
At any point it could be consider automated, irl or in game, you’re probably going to get a macro ban.
---
I look at the Runecraft icon, I see a plate of bacon. And in RS3, summoning is a wolf. I think it's fine the more esoteric and less real-world skills have stranger looking icons. What could you put? A lantern maybe? But that still wouldn't necessarily communicate "creates magical armors."
---
Overrated comment right here
---
Do pouches not have a drop option?
---
Yeah but what's his acct name?
---
Isn’t that basically what the tea is? Lol

One of my favorite series! Keep it up

---
Logic and facts. Thank you.
---
I like the cyan cape you suggested better than the purple cape! Although I would still prefer that the warding cape be pink or rainbow, as there are other capes that have shades of blue and green in the game already.
---
can't you get a friend to carry 28 essence and just bring the stew yourself? Then drop the bowl and spice and get the 28 essence from your friend
---
idk if +5 magic accuracy is worth the defense you lose from ahrims, it will replace the rags xerican robes in the wild at least i guess since the new shit will prob sit around 40k.
---
Nice!! There's so much you can do! Slayer, barrows, bossing, more questing of course! ;)
---
None because it’s not going to pass :-)
---
Wow player here this man speaks the truth the membership fee tho keeps minor pests/trolls away but serious abusers have multiple accounts sometimes even multiscreen.
---
Agreed even though I just got mine a week ago.  I still blazed through every quest with the wiki, so I'm interested in actually just trying to do a new one all on my own.   But honestly I'll probably get a third of the way through the light puzzle before I say fuck this and just wait for a guide lol.
---
I believe he means the margin specifically between pass/fail, i.e. 75% +/- X% with X% being decently large.
---
Not mine, a buddy sent it to me
---
Would you need to drop the imp boxes on the grind before showing them your items originally?
---
Dogs
---
I think dark blue with pink would be cool

Lol I like how you think you know my opinion from my comment.
