I think youve never played any real poker. An AI "solving" heads up poker is nowhere near winning on a 6 or even 9 man table. Oh and I was diamond in sc2. I would call sc2 complex indeed, and I would say poker is just as complex if not more

I'd recommend checking out [Bitter's DPS Calc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UwFte7z1sAkHepP9BLfRw4bz_IgCjwtpi9FU3eGDhAU/edit#gid=158500257). If you're unsure what weapon is better just plug it into there and you'll get numbers to compare.
---
Runelite is super helpful.
---
Not if warding comes out, especially if you need levels to deconstruct rune equipment and need to work up.  This collection could probably single handedly level a significant portion of the games warding levels.

I agree,but then every monster has the chance to one shot you for balance.

I still dont see it bro, my green lantern ring gives me dueling teles thoooo

well its accuracy so its more important against higher def monsters.

So do u alch one? serious question on what you should actually do

just use blowpipe, the time saved will pay for the scales so easily.

There‚Äôs a couple people that do stuff like this. They‚Äôre probably training all 10 accounts at once just because thats what they wanna do.

If you're choosing the right bosses, then you could probably just use melee gear for high def and still have high accuracy. Use a smoke staff if you have it, otherwise fire is fine probably.

Yea man for sure. But this is just for one item. Include scythes, and all the other BiS items, id say 1 trillion is immensely conservative

Some traits of the autism spectrum disorder include lack of interest/experience in social interest, intense passion for obscure and/or repetitive activities. For example, I went to school with someone with Asperger's (a specific type of ASD) who was obsessed with buses, and he would spend hours and hours each day watching different types of buses each day and taking videos of them as they passed by.
---
The anti-social and repetitive nature of  people on the spectrum remind people of steretypes of OSRS players, although it is possible that if you have antisocial and/or obsessive tendencies but no history of ASD diagnosis, you might just be on the spectrum but on the very high functioning end.

You lose everything except untradeables and your 3 most valuable items. You'll have an hour to go back and get it though, unless it's an instanced fight like some quest bosses.
---
That's not your 3 most valuable stacks of items. Just single items.

If you have 100k gp on you I think you'll just keep 3gp.

You keep your 3 most valuable items, as well as certain items.

It's also useful for fire capes on low level accs.

For it to be useful at all there needs to be a way to quickly swap ammo mid fight. Switch from those ruby bolts to diamond bolts at half health

You can hide items beneath a certain value threshold, like hide all items beneath 2k worth of gold for example, makes things alot easier

Ok I'll start it now then. I was just nervous about getting back into everything again and deciding what to work on first. I'll try to unlock some transportation methods soon. I'll probably do some agility and thief for a bit (I miss my rouge outfit lol) and work on slayer aswell before I mess with the other skills.

Rune halberd was god tier

Meaning: "small axe with a short handle," designed to be used by one hand, from Old French hachete "small combat-axe, hatchet,"

https://www.etymonline.com/word/hatchet

I guess everyone but you googled it
---
Lmfao just find an air rune and immediately straight shit yourself

I'm curious but how is it possible to make 11m/h? Do you only need to solo the whole thing?

How are you being upvotes for wrong information? They were called axe in RSC.

https://runescapeclassic.fandom.com/wiki/Rune_Axe

Literally nothing in RSC has the word hatchet.
---
This is awesome, good job :D
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPY2vZ5I7FI
---
Also any god armour like zammy or sara was so cool. Kinda expensive then. Also dragon legs were god tier
---
Thanks everyone for the answers except for that one guy that tried to shame me for using a guide lol. I guess I didn't think of Vorkath because I was figuring it was one of the guides that assumes I already have a big enough bank to fund 99 slayer sparing no expense, but instead it seems like it considers Vorkath on task as efficient because of the zero-time slayer xp while doing one of the best money-makers in game. Makes sense
---
Isn't that amulet of torture though
---
You play with a clan called BA Services. 4 people boost one person to get them a torso, role level ups or whatever they want. 
---
A torso for example will cost 32m, or 44m if you want to go to the front of the line. It takes roughly an hour and is split between the 4 boosters. 
---
The cost seems excessive, but there are way more people who want the service than there are people who boost. 
---
Ironmen, pkers, diaries and master clues all give people reasons to want barbarian assault rewards. And many people don't like to actually play.
---
Please DM me your address so I can personally come and shake your hand for that comment
---
are you typing the correct email on the site? you could recover your account that would fix it
---
Fletching can be over a million xp an hour while playing semi casually  You're clearly a fucking noob lol. Nice try though hehehehehe
---
I'll pay 2m for it.

I'm from the Cape, you're not missing much m8
---
RS3 has ironman mode.
---
one too many Sara brews
---
You can use iron at the same level and steel is only lv5.
---
Could just add a team boss with a lot of mechanics (Mechanic's wise being close to Olm/Verzik) but without any bosses beforehand, just throwing you straight into a difficult team encounter with whatever you have in your inventory.   
---
Lootwise could just use a raids 1/raids 2 system for loot as well.
---
Wakka wakka
---
But you can get banned for it before the addition of bonds. With bonds you can't as Jagex profits from the RWT.
---
My guess would be they rise in price in anticipation for the yearly Christmas event.

Yikes. Not even efficient for fletching.

What was the mace update?

Outside of certain promos, you get far more DXP from stars than you get direct xp from lamps from Treasure Hunter, so you still need to do some training in RS3 to make use of MTX.

yes.

I'm thinking about getting a Bludgeon, but would have to sell my Zammy Hasta to be able to afford it.

Is there a list for what slayer tasks each weapon is bis?

Wait. That's illegal.

Max cape and full elite diary damn homie
---
not that i know of but maybe, idk, but you could just have your games room level or total level show up as your right click everywhere
---
are you a female character? pretty sure females have this issue on nearly every weapon?
---
Despite not being as extreme as in RS3, OS bonds are still technically P2W MTX as you can legally RWT a lot of gp and buy the best combat gear or the most expensive skilling supplies to powertrain your skills.

Could be ai learning of sorts, that or just fun for somebody

I was the same way up until a couple months ago.

The friend group I had when Rs was in its early stages focused a lot of mining for some reason. I think it was this whole ‚Äònon trading‚Äô thing. When GE didn‚Äôt exist. So we‚Äôd spend a lot of time in the falador dwarven mines and mine rocks, and I remember how jealous I was when my friend showed up one day with a rune pickaxe, and could both use and hold it.

Besides majority of players have played Runescape long before in the past.

Bro I zoned out at barrows the other day and I thought I was getting gmaul specced
---
Wow, I never actually thought of that, but there would probably be soo much programming involved, making sure pets store in pet houses with items, lose all items if you lose them, even if insured, etc.
---
Party hats would go up in price because consumption of the item, people testing different ones, changing out every once in a while, etc, will deplete the massive reserve of them.

You're literally quoting a page from 2010+ when runescape classic existed from 2001 to 2004. Obviously a page from 2010 would only have info from the very latest update version of rsc, and it's possible that it was different in earlier years.

Constitution made sense in the way that your level was not your hitpoints anymore, because your hitpoints were actually 10x your level, so it didn't make sense to say "this is my hp" when you actually had 10x more than that amount. But before that update, your hp level directly *was* your hitpoints, so it made sense for it to be called that.

On OnePlus 6 (6t too atleast) you can split your screen to use multiple apps simultaneously, but I haven't had any luck using this feature with full screen apps.

The value it says there is just price times item. It doesn‚Äôt at all account for what that collection is worth. Which is a lot more than 600m

Maybe put more into dicing because realistically when you chase your losses they cannot run forever

Efficient players already get the best exp rates and they don't need to buy gp. Buying gp in os as far as competitive skilling is at best making some of the grind less annoying but just as long.

All of what I said is exactly accurate, and even stated that ALL of the current AI's that exist for poker that are under public knowledge have ONLY beat professional players in heads-up play. Meaning 1 versus 1, which only happens at the VERY END of a tournament. You have 40,000 people playing, with thousands of 8 person tables, the AI simply doesn't have the ability to play in this format yet, and it won't for decades, unless some genius figures something out about AI that would be so significant the last application considered would be to put it to work on playing Texas Hold'em.
---
You must remember very poorly. You should also read what I said in detail next time. I happily posted that there are some AI's out there that play well in heads up, but that erratic betting patterns tend to mess them up. All of the pro's from what I have seen also agreed to play as if they are playing a real player, and not an AI, so they agreed to play a specific way, with specific betting patterns, which doesn't make any sense to do. You play the player, not the game. When you take that aspect away from a player, the results are meaningless.

Well, you could always fact check me if you'd like. There is more than enough information there, and I am not afraid to post things I am well informed about. How upset by knowledge do you have to be that you get your torch and pitchfork out every time someone posts something that they are obviously excited about and clearly enjoy.

I can't tell if you're a child, or just easily offended by people knowing more than you. Could be both, who knows!

Shit back in 02 (maybe 03?) I saw my cousin playing runescape classic and I asked him about it and he told me it was called runescape. At the time this was when you could sign up for rs2 as it just came out so I did that not knowing the difference and got super into it. I played up until 09 when it turned to shit and recently returned last year to osrs.

Sorry my bwana, won't stop using that word

One day I dream of crafting bloods, it'll be so good on mobile, plus making the final elites even closer and what do we say to the god of rc? Not today.
---
Argument: handcannon would give a reason for people to get 99 firemaking outside of maxing (because higher firemaking level makes it less likely to boom)
---
Use a scythe for single tile tasks
---
This is actually designed this way. If you cant put the key on the keyring it means its useless and you can drop it
---
Yeah, train another skill.
---
Yes, you can keep an untrimmed version of it by dropping it before getting another 99.
---
Yes
---
Indeed, there is no need to spend less points on skipping tasks. 
---
Currently if you would use konar slayer master you can get 8.4 skips per 10 tasks done. 
---
In addition there is a 10% chance of you receiving b2b tasks if you are 99 slayer.
---
It would actually be "hard to say". But, I don't expect a trumplet to understand the english language.
---
Nope. The skill is useless.
---
Your argument is literally dumb, ‚Äòpkers are toxic so Pvmers are toxic back‚Äô genuinely go watch any video where they‚Äôre hunting in then wildly, all the Pvmers shit talk them and funnily enough for the past few days I‚Äôve tried a bit of pking and at vennanatis a good majority of people shit talked me for trying to kill them without me saying a word so i have first hand experience that says it happens the other way too. Also people running around with nothing on can just log out instantly when seeing people, no delay, nothing and you don‚Äôt think this is op, don‚Äôt think d hide is incredibly strong for 15k that you can splash on it multiple times with teleblock or that you can get a seedpod that‚Äôs one click tp at 30 wildly.
---
As for you saying certain item are overpowered, also absolutely stupid. People literally have this gentleman‚Äôs agreement in pvp to not eat when you‚Äôre at a certain number of hitpoints because it‚Äôs so hard to kill people. You want to kill pvp because you don‚Äôt like it and don‚Äôt like the fact you can be killed that‚Äôs it, you complain about all this damage that items shouldn‚Äôt be able to do, well let‚Äôs rebalance the game just for you and make it so ags can‚Äôt hit over and 50 and whip can‚Äôt hit over a 25, how would your precious slayerscape fair then? As I‚Äôve said before it you don‚Äôt like the fact you can be killed in the wildy then don‚Äôt go in it or just 3 item, don‚Äôt complain about wanting the whole game changed because you don‚Äôt like it.
---
"let's make a pk video of no skill pking, using a pussy tactic that's ruined the wildy and hope for some Internet points."

I used to think people were insane for paying 32 mill for the \~2 hours it takes to get the torso. Two days I finally understood why.

No.

Not to mention half the map is filled with immersion-destroying neon-colored buildings pushing microtransactions and completely breaking the composition and aesthetic of the world. I think we take for granted how much the empty space in OSRS improves the game and how it looks.

Please, make the case for RS3 that the lack of free space isn't completely distracting and downright ugly.

Adding your inability to count to your inability to hold a conversation, things aren't looking good. But that's okay. I and many others are willing to help you improve yourself. I can give you some suicide hotline numbers too. There's no shame in it. Don't give up.

I like the idea of a hot pking spot in F2P. Not the altar one though sorry.

I had a mate back In the day that had a few accounts with different variety of skills with 99 slayer. One was untrimmed. One was 99 slayer 10hp. Another he got 99atk,sre,def, slayer same day.

Fuck i thought he was cool. He had way too much time on his hands obviously

---
I still don't see your point. Why do useless items NEED to have value? What harm is an unused item causing the game by staying at low value?
---
This is why you get a twisted bow from raids before finishing demonics. It's an advanced ironman strat
---
Whenever I see an imp, I just have to kill it. Bonus points if it teleports and my character runs in some random direction.
---
I had to scroll too far to finally see this
---
Thats my theorie too . It would be relatively easy to detect a lot of these material gatering bots. Since a lot of prices stay relativly stable i would guess that Jagex "tollerates" bots untill they impact the economy too much and simply banns them then.
---
i could even give cash as soon as i have membership again ( take like 5 mins of alching ) but no i don't know anyone in game.
---
Y‚Äôall it‚Äôs BREATHE
---
I'd just burst my mage a bit through slayer first it's super fast and very worth it
---
To just buy membership? I guess i could but i made it this far without spending anything.
---
Lots of people on this game don't understand opportunity cost. The amount of people I've seen saying "I alch yew bows for profit cause I make them myself" is insane
---
Just get a t bow before learning zulrah and never learn rotations. Big brain strategy
---
He has a fire cape, so i'm sure he has at least 70.
---
I never even started the last skill
---
I mean it's probably still quicker to bank at Castle Wars but I did have the impression that Wrath runes are pretty damn chill and way better than Deaths.
---
With bow you literally don't need to know the rotations at all
---
Frogeel... Raw cave eel and Giant frog legs to get more Raw cave eel... Well, I suppose it is a use, but still pretty useless.
---
Imagine he makes a runescape video and suddenly every f2p world is full of "brofist me bro." "pewds bro."

---
Gaining xp isn't hard. However in rs3 experience rates are insane compared to os and in oldschool people actually are equal when it comes to training. In rs3 rich kid can just buy his way to max while others playing the game properly can't keep up. Not sure if it's more afk either since rs3 has afk ways for every skill. You can afk train slayer and combat with soulsplit and other skills are also easily afkable.
---
I would wait until 65 slayer when you can kill dust devils before worrying about training magic with combat.
---
You can use ice burst on dust devils in catacombs of kourend and get very fast xp and at least break even on your rune cost
---
They can't even make their own actual client playable. Over the past 2 weeks my co-workers have picked up OSRS. It's incredible how much they love Runelite. Their question "why isn't this drop overlay in the actual game?" "Why do I need some third party software from a website to have tabs in my bank"
---
I wouldn't play this game if Runelite or clients of the sort didn't exist.
---
So does Selana Gomez' and I've never been irritated by them
---
If you don't have anything to spend your gold on then saving up is always a good idea. I just ground out 99 thieving to get 15m on my ironman so I could afford herblore. It's either making 18k unfinished potions that yield no xp, or paying an NPC a few mill to do it for you. 
---
As for early game.... I spent quite a lot of gold on law runes for teleports, nature runes for alching and I spent like 150k (can't remember proper price) for full mystic at the magic guild.
---
I'm sure it also cost me a good few mill to buy runes for mystic boots, bones to peaches, master wand and mages book from magic training arena. 
---
There are a lot, maybe too many scenarios to remember where gold is needed. 
---
you'll most likely spend most of your gold at kingdom of misc. This is from a quest, if you also do royal trouble it makes it more worth the gold used. It's a management feature where If you keep your kingdom happy at 100%, and fill the coffers with gold, you will yield the most resources. You can choose which resource you want, although most ironmen agree that you should always have resources on herbs. But there's guides online for that :)
---
Good luck!
---
You buy ores at blast furnace, you can buy huge amounts of ores in very little time since there is a shop that stocks them really fast.
---
Nearly no ironman mines all the ore they need for smithing.
---
Broads are broad bolts, yes. The only really viable way to train fletching on an ironman. (You can make bows but in reality you are just wasting time if you do)
---
Kingdom means kingdom of miscelania, its a "minigame" where you give one guy money, keep the workers happy(5min every 3 days or so) and you get recources  (herbs seeds logs).
---
On an ironman you never have too much gp, you need a lot of it, shops are overpowered.

You would need to make another area for bursting dust devils/nechs to avoid things getting clogged up.

Do your woodcutting at the WC guild, it gives you invisible +8 boost which means you cut the logs more often.

That was with all levels starting at 3 and before the new update of portable vic. I guarantee it's so much cheaper now.

I hadn't done zulrah in ages so I forgot all rotations. Got a bow and killed zulrah consistently just by running around the island praying against whatever colour it turned into

I mean they're still a big deal to me lol

I think you need to deal at least one damage. I vaguely remember B0aty doing this on his One Man Army series, trying to recoil down a dust devil without the slayer level. It didn't work

Isn't the rule of internet first watch the episode then go online?

The real problem is too many worlds. I honestly wouldn't mind if 75% of the worlds were removed and we have to fight like hell for resource/boss.

Maybe you should brake that habit with something else like going for a run. Easier said that done but it'll make it easier to stop insintecly playing rs instead of something productive

Quicker still to bank with Crafting cape I think. Not sure if the extra inventory slot would offset rates by enough for it to matter though.

If it‚Äôs just applied to gear fine. But it shouldn‚Äôt be able to be applied to skills items such as herbs, vials, rune essence, etc. also shouldn‚Äôt be able to be used in TOB or raids

yeh its plank running butler will bank the planks after u give him logs if u leave house b4 he gets back

It just seemed strange cause i never saw them do anything other than stand there and shift back and forth. I expected it to be a drop off point but never saw another bot come in. Is there a place i can report this stuff to on the RS forums or a mod i can contact that will do something?
---
Well, I made blood until 90, which is about 30 mil. Then I made souls and sold most to Ali's rune shop, which made me about 30 mil as well. So just under 60 mil I think. Which is only an average of a mil per day. (And then we ignore the bonds I've had to buy for both my main and my HCIM).
---
a lot of bots dont just bot non-stop, the average bot is very different than most people think back on. There's almost no botters that let their bot run 24/7 anymore. Bots keep OSRS economy as stable as it is.

The problem with the giant mole is that after it is below 50% hp, it has a chance to dig and move locations after each attack you do to it (even if you miss).  People use Dharok's because that significantly increased max hit will give you a chance to take it down in less attacks meaning you aren't chasing it around the mole hole as much (and burning stamina pots as you do).  I would say it probably increases efficiency by 25% if I were to guess (I just finished my grind for the mole pet a few weeks ago and tried both methods).  I would highly suggest using the Dharok's if you plan to grind it out for an extended period of time, and its a pretty good money maker for mid range accounts.

My guess is you collected at the Varrock sewers? That was a popular place to do it and you did make some good money. Just took alot of trips

All the pvp gear I can buy is pretty damn expensive. I can't afford to lose them. What do I do? I wanna learn how to PK
---
the bots are quite fun to play with so heres a list of their commands for anyone wanting
---
kill or attack,
---
swarm or disperse,
---
randomon and randomoff (toggles random colors of text),
---
circle,
---
vertical,
---
follow or square,
---
dd or death or death dot,
---
infinity,
---
flower (shit),
---
horizontal (they make rows based on number),
---
home teleport,
---
run and walk,
---
reich or swastika,
---
stay
---
Except this change wouldn't improve anything
---
Thanks for the free water runes
---
Runecrafting bad!
---
Running essence is something that's been in the game for a long time. Law and nature running used to be a thing, so how is ZMI running any different from that and why is it only a big problem now?
---
*laughs in Ironman*
---
Required for a master clue
---
I kinda like runecraft.
---
That‚Äôs a interesting skullfuck to think about üßê
---
I don't really see the problem with trading to increase rc rates. Isn't essence running supposed to be part of the skill?
---
Use torags hammers as dclaws
---
Made some fat money with this, but it was inevitable I guess
---
Same thing happened to me. Felt like a brainlet.
---
Good change, cheers
---
You can't let people tick eat melee hits without PID unless you remove PID from pvp altogether (engine work)
---
Bassically yeah. Just someone who has only played a few minutes got irritated and quit lol. It's like two building outside the GE. And I don't understand the in your face thing. I see it when I log in if I pay attention even then I don't notice the MTX much.
---
&gt; superior combat system
---
That's incredibly subjective. RS3s combat system is much more generic than OSRS'.
---
The damage has been done and records are ruined ect but I'm happy that they decided to grow a pair
---
You‚Äôre using regular void, not elite void? If that‚Äôs the case I think blessed dhide would be better dps. Since you‚Äôre using bp, you‚Äôre probably only getting 1 kill per trip so I‚Äôd switch to blessed boots over the dragon boots for slightly faster kills. Save up for a bgs if you don‚Äôt have one yet.
---
Saw it yesterday. I‚Äôm starting to believe I‚Äôm the only one that thinks the movie was absolutely shit.
---
The zmi rate for normal players isn‚Äôt changing. Only for the people boosting to 150k/hr, which I‚Äôd imagine isn‚Äôt you. 
---
And if you‚Äôre still trading to get to the altar in 2k19 you must be a osbuddy player.
---
You mean fuck activision. Blizzard is fine
---
normal*
---
He can make steel bars at blast furnace for like 400k gp/hr if he puts in some effort to get ice gloves and a coal bag
---
i would say Nail beasts is worse
---
also makes about 5k gp/hr
---
That woulda been 200 mage logs back in the day. Glad i got pet and muta before it was nerfed, all about hydra GANG these days.
---
already posted 2x
---
I hate the superhero genre as well. That‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm in love with The Dark Knight trilogy. Based on a superhero but absolutely realistic. No superpower alienist galactic powerfest bullshit.
---
void good
---
Of course they're inaccurate - the bowstring has been cut!
---
to be honest that part is easily the most difficult part but if you're doing that on your third attempt that's a good sign. what helped me was spotting where exactly i needed to click to aggro a healer then do it as soon as i do a prayer switch. you lose so much time if you try to hunt the healer in between a switch. also, runelite has an npc indicator feature that puts a massive bubble around whatever you add to it, find the name of the healers from the wiki and put them into the list. once you have them on you just remember to not panic and instead of aggro healers you should be trying to run to a new spot in between switches to get the healers queued up and have only one hitting you
---
Sorry for not checking /new for every post I make bud
---
Since when has this been overpowered?
---
Running nature runes has been going for years are they going to nerf that?
---
Same haha I remade a main since legit forgot my account from 2000 and they refused my recov attempt  ü§®  As a kid it felt like SO MUCH TIME NEEDED.. Now an adult.. it‚Äôs just whatevs crack on.. be over 100 combat in no time ü§™
---
J1mmy, that you?
---
Rip zmi runners.
---
87
---
Running natures isn't anywhere near the 170k xp/hr zmi gives you
---
Yah fuck this suggestion lol. The ability to tick eat is absolutely retarded in pvp. 
---
Unkillable in most situations if done right. Over killing and no tick eating should stay
---
I believe heart is a lot better, I'm thinking bracelet is like  .5 dps more than barrows gloves, could be mistaken though.
---
About time.
---
Good good....
---
You can still do it at other altars. Its only disabled at ourania because the xp/ess at that specific location was overpowered.
---
Pretending to be a ZMI runner on a PvP world (LITTLE DID THEY KNOW I HAVE DRAGON CLAWS)
---
You can tell the post is fake cause the only gfs anyone has in osrs already play and cost at least 100k a month and are secretly dudes
---
They don't have to be stored in plaintext because of that. It's likely that they just lowercase the incoming password and then do the salting and hashing.
---
Hmmm sure, lol. I mainly do world building for a novel and custom games I play with friends, which why I know this. But sure.
---
How crushed where you when you found out you needed a quest for the dbaxe after all those yews you cut?
---
literally what he said. aswell I don't need defense bonus as im 1 defense. also it makes my heart skip a beat when i look at my stats and see "6 defense" :p
---
Well.. when some fail in some areas of a social life they excel when you can only judge them for the platform you met them on ü§® A mask gives you confidence x
---
and I guess based on what armour I'm currently wearing, that might help reduce the damage.
---
Because it's easily 100k+ exp an hour.
---
Make sure you insure the pet. That way if you get clapped you can keep the pet.
---
Idk but you can strive to be the first if there isn't any yet!
---
I wonder which altar people will run again then
---
Masturbating.. Now girls do it for me üòÖ
---
MEMES, JACK
---
I appreciate the feedback man, I really want to get access to fairy rings as well.. so those 3 are definitely top priority
---
Yes just regular void. After all this time gridding requirements for DS2, I really don‚Äôt feel like getting requirements for Elite Void as well. But yes, I‚Äôm only getting 1 kill per trip. Are you recommending blessed boots, or full Blessed D‚Äôhide instead?
---
Yea it's more for awareness of how autism is a spectrum. Most people know of autism and just assume that it makes you like some dumb kid who has to rely on your parents but that's not really it at all.
---
Devious - Ultimate Ironman (insane progress, very high ranked player) 
---
FatNooblet - great first episode to start his Ironman series
---
UIM Verf - karamja uim
---
Boatys current series is great, he is playing osrs the way it was in 2007 so no orbs to show prayer or health and to run you gotta click the button in your options
---
KempQ - not consistent with one series but posts some good videos every so often
---
Solo Mission - good when deadman seasonals is out because he does very well and updates daily
---
Statistically Challenged - has a wilderness Ironman as well as posts silly 1 hour challenges to see how much money he makes and then gives it all away to f2p players at the end
---
Higher xp/ess at ourania altar than any other altar by a pretty significant amount. It was only an issue recently because people didn't abuse it with runners until recently and they were deciding whether or not to nerf it for a while.
---
That's Arma.
---
Thanks, my record trip is like 16kc. I've got a black demon task that I want to do exclusively at gorillas, with the exception of last night where I killed Skotizo 14 times.
---
Absolutely crushed. I think it took me like three days to get everything ready(speculating could have been longer, was over 12 years ago)
---
Where's your defender, neitznot and torso
---
All ess runnnign will stil be possible, however ZMI rates were just over the top. It was 190k rc xp/h with 4 runners, that's completely ridiculous
---
You don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù an ely or 99 prayer for anything in RS
---
I certainly think so. I miss my golden chef hat tbh
---
It's the new world hop meta. Was at Kraken today and someone said to me "Hop or I'll spoil endgame for u" lulll
---
Thank fuck, fucking finally. 150k exp in a skill supposed to be the last true prestigious 99. Glad it got nerfed
---
What‚Äôs my next best shield option then?
---
He most definitely has enough cover every tile ingame. I dont know the number but it can't be that high.
---
Someone hated jagex allot the morning they read that after making billions from it üòÜüôè
---
&gt; just because few people cant afford runners
---
just a few? Percentually wise, how many players can afford 18m/h for runners lmfao.
---
Hahah exactly, scary time
---
My setup was always karils top, helmet of neitznot, bandos tasset, primordial, and avas accumulator, barrows gloves
---
And my switches were archlight, zerker ring, torture, defender
---
 and blowpipe, anguish, archers ring
---
lol the dude really put in a swastika command classic osrs
---
i like it tbh, it's really easy to see everything since the screen is much smaller

This is literally a spoiler dude. That blur clearly isn‚Äôt four letter ‚ÄúThor‚Äù

Everything you said is shit, just so you know
---
You still haven't listed any reason why lol
---
&gt; going beyond 99rc is also more prestigious than going beyond 99 agility
---
I don't give a fuck about that rofl
---
Seeing some of your skill xp totals makes me relieved that I haven't gotten one yet since I'm maybe halfway there on *some* of the skills. Damn dude, respect the grind
---
Well it looks like you just found a new goal! 75 range and some money for some gear :) if not then I would just start attempting it so you can get the hang of it
---
100m lavas is is 1.05b xp so even if had 200m rc it wouldn't even be 1/5th of them
---
Nah the nerds will abuse anything as long as normies don‚Äôt have access to it.
---
Look at how they feel about AHK, they abused the shit out of it and then cried when it got banned. Only because it was something that wasn‚Äôt readily and easily available for the whole community. If AHK was an OSB feature they woulda bitched from the start. Also look at how many high levels skillers got temp bans from the ardy knights bug. 
---
They truly don‚Äôt give a shit about game integrity. It‚Äôs all about gatekeeping and feeling better than someone because IRL their lives are so pitiful
---
At least 10 from what I can see
---
Atleast they weren't as slow as with zulrah droptable
---
Wow, I never thought of that. You are right. Maybe I should use a slayer master or something to do that, or would that make it too simple?
---
If a black square at the edge of the map in the outskirts of a desert annoy you, maybe you should play something else
---
Lol anyone defending DC only ever references The Dark Knight. How sad is it when your last good trilogy ended 7 years ago?
---
&gt;50+ hours been cancerous
---
hue hue, just you wait till you get to a real grind
---
Want one so bad ü§£
---
Back when I was in middle school I would legit spend hours standing in the Falador garden trying to sell rune scimitars for like 500gp profit each.
---
Then I would bank stand for hours and not do shit. No wonder I only reached 1100 total after like 5 years. I recently got back in to the game and decided to play efficiently and I mamaged to crank out 1200 total within a month.
---
This is true... I went the slayer route and made 100s of mils whilst getting several 99s. Was fun af and now I have a decent bank :)
---
I found that i was liking the game, but the more quests i did the more i was loving it, I opened up waaay more activities and map spaces.
---
games been out over 2 decades bud.
---
50/50 staking is as bad as bots with 70/30 odds?
---
 Ok my friend now I'm super lost, what are you even trying to say, you don't want any PVM team based content because it makes you money? Or you don't want them to ever add more PVM team based content that's over a mil an hour? Or you are happy with the current amount of non raids bosses?
---
I‚Äôm going to continue trying to kill zulrah on my ironman with ibans, karils cbow, and as many pineapple pizzas as I can fit in my purple face. 51 KC with nothing nice to show so far other than 1m in battlestaves!
---
Then you'd lose on the rc cape perk and have to fix pouches with lunars, I'd rather run with a xeric ammy or dueling rings over crafting cape
---
Sparc Mac with over 100B bank

Except for normal people who don't want RC to be AIDS, a.k.a 90% of the player base.
---
Can I do barrows and have it be worthwhile without good melee stats? I have 71 range and 68 mage and can use msb(i) and Iban blast but my melee stats are kinda mediocre. 50 attack and 62 strength with 1 defence. I have 45 prayer so I‚Äôll have overheads but I‚Äôm not sure how verac is gonna go or Karil since my melee is so bad.
---
I mean, I suppose that would work as a perk, but I think the current perk is fine. If you're slaying past 99, you're likely doing it for certain tasks so a chance for a back to back is helpful.
---
The only other perk that I could see working is instead of a back to back, it could offer to extend a task. But reducing points per skips seems a bit more situational and it could speed up the skill post-99 more than is desired.
---
That's My Boy Geronimo0224. Hes an absolute unit. He single handedly killed 10 rot members with his gilded 2h sword in one fell swoop.
---
I'll pull out my bandos cocksword, and challenge him to a pvp battle and win obviously.
---
Is it though? I mean its 3 clicks, as opposed to 6+ taps (roughly) that it takes from unlocking your phone, opening camera app, clicking photo, opening reddit, opening sub, click new post, upload photo.
---
or print screen, save, open reddit sub, click new post, upload.
---
\---
---
Better yet, if you have an android your pictures automatically sync with your google account so you don't even need to plug your phone in anymore or if you have iCloud setup it does the same thing, kind of marries the two wonderfully.
---
fuck em lol
---
He is indeed a shoulder parrot, but not a very good one. He tries to bite my ears if i don't give him enough pats so I have to wear earmuffs while he's on my shoulder.
---
Different monsters drop different tier clue scrolls
---
Beginners are the only ones available in f2p
---
delete the game. start it over
---
Hope this becomes the meta just so pkers can kill the sweaty nerds and we can watch them cry all over Reddit posts
---
And yet still over 100 bank spaces open.
---
I did a cw game a couple days ago... All 70 stats and I was hitting constant 0s pretty much rofl
---
u can only get beginner clues in f2p.
---
beginner is the difficulty of the clue, u can be a lvl 3 and get an elite, you don't move up tiers after completing a set number
---
you just have to be doing the right content to get a different difficulty of clue
---
Yeah, neither do I @12.7m xp. I use all of my points on skipping boring/useless tasks rather than spending them on cosmetic helm changes. I figure by the time I get abby head (8500 kc, no dice), I'll have some spare points for it. But 5000 points on helms before 99 slay? That's crazy to me.
---
I'm an Ironman lmao. I've done far worse grinds. Spent 100+ hours combined going dry for a black mask and sceptre. Haven't gotten to Zulrah yet but I'll probably go dry there too.
---
I personally think 50 hours for 77 RC is not a big deal. But I was voicing what seems to be a common opinion on this subreddit.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense since ultra has increased yield and limps make pretty good cash. On a farm run I make 45K profit on average from limps to offset snape seeds and potential torstol losses
---
excuse me, what did you fucking say?
---
Since you're doing it for gp the cost of 1 dueling ring for 8 runs is 836 coins, cost of a wrath rune is 435 coins. So you end up missing out on quite a bit of gp, I'd rather take a dueling ring or xeric ammy if lazy and don't want to constantly grab a new ring
---
Only if we HAVE to collect the slime ourselves.
---
You‚Äôre on the wrong sub then.
---
I've thought about this, but not really. I'm not trying to mimic how the game was back in 2001, more just use it as a means of restricting my account in order to try out different grinds and dead content
---
Grinding sweaty repetitive actions for hours on end üòÇüòÇüòÇ Prestigious üòÇüòÇüòÇ

poor people got angry lol, everything has to be on their level

People complain that RC has disproportionally slow xp rates, but when people find a way to make it consistent with other skills it somehow becomes an integrity crisis.  The RC skill is borked.  The ZMI alter was originally intended to fix its xp rates.
---
Yes because in real life the word prestigious isn‚Äôt synonymous with the word pathetic
---
I have read multiple time people swear by chins. Because they will aoe and get all of them at once. But my chins never hit to get them off. So then I went into panic mode switching back to rune cbow. I have also read Karils is good for the long range and you won‚Äôt get pulled into jad trying to get a healer. Just haven‚Äôt tried it yet. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I start questioning if it‚Äôs worth it at all.
---
are you ok bud? Have you tried getting some fresh air, perhaps.
---
That's why I said good amount not all
---
I don‚Äôt believe jagex should be limiting player interaction because of high exp rates for certain skills.
---
Play the game that you want to play. If you want something super-interactive all the time, then OSRS is a bit of a struggle once you're done questing and don't have access to higher level PVM. There is tons of AFK stuff and it's hard to get around some of it. 
---
For me, I love OSRS precisely because of the afk stuff. I get to watch streams, read reddit, shitpost, pet my cat, and do all of that stuff that I was going to be doing anyways while making progress in the game. While that works for me as a video game, it might not be what you want. My buddy recently quit because it just didn't hold his attention well enough and the mid game grinds weren't worth it. 
---
At this point I've figured out which skills and activities are active and which are passive, and have a good list of what I can do when I'm feeling like different activity levels. If I want to pay full attention to the game for a few hours then I can work on some quests or bossing, or more active skills like Hunter. If I don't want to pay attention at all then I can do some crafting or an easy slayer task. I have multiple goals that I'm working towards at a time and can choose one that fits my mood. 
---
For anyone to enjoy OSRS, I really recommend learning to embrace the AFK in some way. A second monitor is almost mandatory to be able to do something else on another screen to hold your attention while your character slaps monsters in NMZ.
---
I'm saying I think your post is dumb and there are plenty of bosses out there that you and your friends can happily do and make money. We have plenty of new recent content and if they make more profitable group pvm in the future then so be it but at this point your post comes off as ignorant and ungrateful for the group content that exists. I'm also saying that not every pvm needs to shit out multimill loot especially if the accounts are med level. Fuck the open chest to share with iron men. They stand alone.
---
How do normies not have access to ahk? Anyone can download it, its not even gaming specific tons of people use ahk for all kinds of tasks both gaming and work related.
---
I'm not sure which 'ardy knight bug' you're talking about, do you mean on diary release the bug with an abnormally high success rate pickpocketing heroes? Everyone knew that would get nerfed, no one thought it was a bug though, just an oversight. Not sure what you mean by 'look how many' though, it was only a handful of people, only 2 of which were prominent in the HLC (aubury/autumn elegy and trance music) neither of them even play anymore, aubury in large part because of lack of game integrity.
---
Almost no one in the hlc gatekeeps efficient playing, theres a discord run by a prominent omnia member (Dan S) with over 12,000 members, dedicated to teaching people skilling methods, both the most efficient ones and more reclined ones.
---
What are blood (soul?) runes xp/hr?
---
What the fuck type of thing is this to say, what is wrong with you? I have quit playing osrs for a long time now but I do understand why SOME PEOPLE would like it if the developers put some time into polishing the graphics/layout of the map in some places. 
---
No it doesn't annoy me at all, but I would appreciate it if Jagex put some attention to the graphical fidelity of their game. It just looks wonky and out of place right now. 
---
You say it 'doesn't improve anything' but it does for sure. Maybe gameplay-wise it doesn't change anything, but luckily graphics and immersion are a part of games too. Maybe you should start playing text based games if you give zero fucks about the way the game looks.

The fire wall always has an opening on the wall, you just have to click that open space and you will be fine. The mechanic of just clicking outside of the square is ridiculously easy so if you have to sometimes be more precise I think it‚Äôs fair.
---
You can continue to interact with others at all other Altars available in game.
---
The great thing about the plugin is that it highlights where exactly that drop is, if im doing some afk slayer I'm not tracking where my character is at all the time due to auto retaliate, and having to search for a specific drop on mobile is somewhat hard, especially if you slaying monsters that drop loads of items
---
They should be.

Shitty attempt at being shitty, mate.

Is everyone happy that we bitched about the guy using alts to train melee now? Cool.

Can say the last good one was dk.. but in general the whole concept of Gotham and metropolis is just darker in comics and films than Marvel, the killing joke was pretty sick for an animation..

Hello darkness my old friend....

Also interested in knowing this

seeing as I'm talking about the game this game is a clone of survey says..........na.

Between when OSRS was just RS2, and private servers since then, this game has been live and playable for 2 decades.
---
Yeah. And when you recolour it you are literally stretching the head of your defeated foe over your helmet. :D

I tweeted this to JagexAllstar (Web developer at jagex) nearly two years ago and he had quite a bit to say about it. https://twitter.com/FremmyRS/status/895986112342216704
---
I feel like it is a good change. But I was wondering about using the "trade" option at ZMI to follow people (so your character auto paths around rock formations instead of getting stuck, which happens when following normally). Will that be affected by this update too?

There goes my main money maker rip.

no he doesnt- only major content (e.g. hes allowed the lummy bank etc)

It doesn't matter what your opinion is because the method was objectively overpowered compared to other methods when you do the math.

Back in 07 I was 12 I had grinded so long for d long and 60 attack and lost city quest. I finally grinded all 3 I was so proud of my achievement then me and my irl friend went pking I joking around attacked him and then he started killing me he said his mouse died but I don‚Äôt believe him. I tanked abit teled to Varrock with 4hp and poisoned I died didn‚Äôt have protect item on lost my d long and cried for like an hour then one of my friends gave me a new one!

Get barrows gloves, get your farm up to 55 sooner rather than later, do desert treasure, aim for all stats at 50?
---
Farm for herb runs, farming guild contracts, fruit tree runs, potato cactus runs, and also 55 is what you'll need one day if you ever raid.
---
Get those bgloves then go slay bro I believe in you

I usually get to zuk only using 5 to 6 sanfew sips and one or two brew sips, so I've always got a full invent of supplies.

I always keep my run on when killing healers, should I switch that up a bit and use Ctrl to turn it on and off and walk parts.

I've got no idea I'm desperate.

I've probably gotten to healers 10 times (with a few stupid deaths in the waves) in a row now and I just plank and died

No, do I need too and where would I find him ?

&gt; existing untrimmed capes

Which only exist became of an unintentional game bug. It would piss off all the people with 99s that didn't use the bug to save their cape.
---
They should just make all trimmed options toggleable, like it is with the music cape.
---
S

LOL
---
What a useless nerf. Skills are either profitable or wasting money for a 99.
---
Who cares if all those people waste money for 99 rc? They max it and will never touch the skill again anyway.

That's like nerfing prayer so people can't use gilded altars from other people. What's the point?

You need to double name change to free up a name so no, you can not do it just via the website.
---
Put that zerker necklace on and pray to God Ash.
---
Atleast the xp you buy doesn't come in lamps ;)
---
Also..no one does law or nature rune running anymore. So this doesn't hurt anyone.
---
Sounds fine to me
---
what about getting ready for bossing like zulrah or such. Is it just about grinding out the xp or is there more prep than that?
---
It's just a luck thing, youll hit the jackpot on it sooner or later man

Casual amount of XP u/tbow_is_op

Iron is expensive my dude, that‚Äôs at least a 300gp commitment

For the shield at healers, keep more in front of it.

How many sets are you doing for the minions &amp; what're your supplies at the start of Zuk?

"These skills"

"But wuuuut about them"

This is the part where you open your browser and read a skill training guide
---
I mean... that's pretty irrelevant since people will just switch to lavas doing the same thing. It's just a mild xp nerf.
---
Is inferno even that hard lol, looks like it just takes time.to complete

I mean some people would if they were being compensated for it haha

Chocolate cake already heals 5 so these wouldn't be worthwhile at 5 hp. Considering the cost and/or tediousness of making these (only 7 per inventory) I thought 8 would be ideal. Just barely more than current BiS one bite foods but still long way from brews.
---
What is the objective once I have good starting gear? Grinding gp or questing? And when should I move to p2p in the future?

But people do ZMI with runners for 120k+ exp per hour, not gonna happen

I made a 60 str obby mauler and i made around 26m on the first day. There were at least 4-6 obby maulers online at bounty hunter worlds who were 1 pray and risking zerker necklace.

what exp/lvl did u get ur rc pet at?

All the circlejerks trying to gatekeep this lame ass skill is annoying. I‚Äôm not even sure why they are.
---
You're right nothing in this game is noteworthy anyone can click LMB over and over yep yep good observation
---
That is getting nerfed this week. My suggestion is a fix for all future boosting.
---
Xp waste
---
Yeah i didnt touch PC til i hit 100 and I joined up and was baffled when we finished the game almost instantly. It was nothing like what i remembered playing back in rs2
---
It's their game
---
It‚Äôs the same thing but it‚Äôs not
---
Some of us have bad rng, id consider myself more than just a casual with 600 tob, 700+ Cox, 200+ cm Cox (mostly solos for all those cox), and still never seen a scythe or tbow split, and overall been dry at various bosses throughout the years, and I'm still missing ely. Never staked or pk, just pvm and Skilling.
---
I would invite you to join my RS3 clan but it sounds like you play OSRS only ?
---
Missed opportunity to call it /r/collectionscape
---
If anyone wants to make a shit ton of gp, right now is the time to go run ess. Bet the prices are ridiculously high
---
Yes, my very first OSRS death was to a tribesman's crazy 11 hit poison at like level 5 lol
---
In general that's how it functions, however there's a base amount added to attack rolls as well I believe
---
whats the fish of the day?
---
It's one of the only skills that discourages people from getting max cape. If it keeps the cape more legendary, i say keep it as annoying as possible.
---
Maybelline
---
Best that I know of is humidify on magic tree plant pots. Takes a large initial investment, but the difference in price between the seeds and the saplings is significant enough to get 4mil+/hr.
---
Well wildy bosses are easy, especially if you duo. KBD would be easy with your stats and 1 or 2 friends. 
---
For Zulrah you'll need tons of supplies while you learn the rotations, as well as 70 prayer, 75 range and mage, BP, Toxic Trident, Occult, God Cape 2 and some gear st the minimum. I spent about 1.1m learning the first rotation, with all BIS gear besides Ancestral and that 120m staff I don't know the name of.
---
You'll die more but you gotta play offense, you'll never hit the max combat tanks that are grabbing the flag. Go bully the pures lol
---
If u change ur name to niggahater73, jagex doesnt change ur name back, they change it to #4828283 and that my friend is two name changes.
---
The point i'm trying to make is that every skill has an overpowered method that costs a ton of money for faster xp than the conventional methods. Why nerf only RC?
---
Do you have your childhood hero Weird Al playing accordion for you?
---
Good, good.
---
But that's how I made money :(
---
This method was expensive, required concentration, and didn't generate items into the game at an insane rate. Hydra brings in more runes than ZMI. Why are we nerfing something that takes wealth from the richer players and gives it to players that only need 75 RC.
---
In all fairness to RS3 (I've played RS3 up to March of this year, with some months / years breaks in between, been playing OSRS since).
---
RS3's issue with Microtransaction is a huge problem, imo, because you can buy keys. However, keys in very small doses like Dailies, quest rewards and given through random skilling... it isn't so bad.
---
Getting 10-15k bonus exp in Crafting or Strength as a random bonus quest reward isn't that gamebreaking. I'd actually even argue that neither is an exp lamp of 10k Agility and a piece of random cosmetic outfit upon logging in daily.
---
It's nice in very small doses. Especially for Bonus exp, since it forces you to train a skill you probably wouldn't otherwise, because there's an incentive to burn through the bonus exp.
---
As a disclaimer : I hate double exp week-ends. I am also against the fact that we can buy keys. I also despise the money-gate in front of additionnal action bars, wealth calculator, more bank spaces and additionnal bank presets.
---
Also, I would vote no in a heartbeat for anything going close to that ever touching OSRS.
---
I was pretty stoked when I tried on my first dragon hide armor lol

Weird... I didn't realise so many people were against runners at zmi. Seems off considering the cost was fucking insane. Whatever though, not like I can afford it
---
No one who has 1.3bil TO SPEND could be considered a casual player.
---
Favorite: dragon slayer 2. Even though it was super long it never got boring or tedious and the final fight was challenging and the buildup was epic. Good storyline too
---
Least favorite: monkey madness 2. I loved the rewards I got from it but that's the only thing I liked about this quest. Story was ok I guess... but the final boss fight was boring to me and the airship platform is single handedly the worst experience I've had on this game
---
that makes a bit of sense, but surely it's still up there or it wouldn't be the second rarest cape
---
no idea why people here on reddit are mad about it, only a handful of people here actually do essence running for the HLC at ZMI. Not like it will affect anyone here, trading essence still works at the nature altar, law altar and any other altar. Stop crying ffs.
---
I think someone else told me the same thing lol. Good to know people have thought and done the same thing
---
If someone steals the password hashes from the server and runs the password checks against the hashes using their own cpu resources, that's called an offline attack. Jagex's servers wouldn't be processing any requests and wouldn't be able to rate limit.
---
You probably couldn't do this before ZMI was added to OSRS in 2016
---
Achievement diary armour, the hard versions.
---
because tick manipulation isn't a bug or a glitch.
---
I only do when I haven't taken allergy meds. Just my 2 cents. Otherwise I breath through my nose.

What is their workaround? I haven‚Äôt seen anything and it‚Äôs not in the blog
---
This is bullshit tbh
---
It's because he actually has no idea what he is talking about and wants to join the angry masses of reddit.
---
&gt; It wasn't ever a core mechanic of ZMI though
---
We can have an entirely separate conversation around whether or not ZMI belongs in OSRS.  I probably would argue that it could, with some significant re-balancing of rates, but again, that's not really relevant to what I was saying.
---
My point was that every training method in OSRS has to balance 3 key things: xp rate (or speed), cost, and difficulty.  Faster training methods usually either cost more or require more attention, cheaper ones usually take longer or require more attention, and easier ones usually take longer or are more expensive.
---
That's the core of runescape, and saying that one particular training method shouldn't be able to be made faster for more money doesn't really align with that, making this a poorly thought through solution.
---
As you point out, the root of the issue is probably that ZMI was designed poorly to begin with, with inflated xp rates to encourage it's use, but my only point was that the proposed solution is really counter to some core game philosophies.  Which it sounds like you don't disagree with.
---
How long did bones to peaches take you?
---
Still don't understand why decisions like this happen now, as opposed to a few weeks after the practice starts...
---
SO bad. Don't personally care since I don't have the money to do something like this, but why wait this long to "fix" something?
---
Saw a 10m exp guy show off with his dragon full helm and bandos chestplate. Truly a god.

Ah well can't say I know much about that.

The loot tracker looks so nice. I constantly have to restart my client otherwise it freezes like crazy. Every time I restart my loot tracker loses some of the data :/
---
Yeah just in the fact of how much cheaper to use the twisted bow is. Not to mention increase in kills.
---
if youre gonna post your old shit atleast start making these again, 100X better than your "lol random xd" pk trips
---
Same I legit have no clue unless it's a tablet.
---
If one person has perceivably "better" gear, the other player will often stake more so that the risk is "balanced".
---
At least that's how I've seen it go down.
---

agreed. Three whole less than one sentence comment, one being 4 words. 
---
just shy of a dissertation.
---
Exactly, Im seeing a lot more people with it, just the other day I saw a level 47 with it, so clearly people are looking at it as a rare possession that is impressive. Even in my clan, 4 people have gotten it just this year whereas only 1 person had it before that since release. Even Im considering going for it, and as you said, a lot of players maxing, when its seen as less impressive people will look to the next achievement orstart doing completionist and I would say champions cape and like the elite clue casket are two of the best completionist items right now
---
down
---
??? Pest control XP storage already destroys the entire XP-gain-record system lol.  Ourania had nothing to do with RC XP records
---
Or just git gud
---
I reckon while maybe not a lot of people essence run or have people run essence for them, they believe that they could use it in the future. Because it is far more practically abusable than micromanaging 12 alts to gain 1m strength xp an hour.

They should just poll this... I don't think it would pass a poll.
---
For zmi only? I suppose.
---
You don't have to take my word, the blog post is still up. I think they said it'd be something like 40-ish k exp/h at 99.
---
Yes you should. RuneLite offers the OSBuddy Pro features as plugins for their client which are free. It's so much better.
---
Skillers with dedicated twitter runescape accounts crying to j mods.
---
?
---
Yep, the community will definitely vote to nerf the most universally hated skill in the game...
---
They would be kinda OP for any place where you want food to sustain, rather than to heal up quickly (anything thats not bossing / pvp), and it would be sub-1k for food that heals more per inventory slot than manta rays / dark crabs / anglers

About to start a MAJOR quest grind. I‚Äôm not into questing as much as other stuff but I need a lot of stuff to help out my account ie. fairy rings and barrows gloves.

Nobody has noticed the xp :/
---
I mean I just think the movies are kind of predictable, and not funny enough to be a comedy but not serious enough to be a drama kind of thing.
---
We should exterminate them
---
As someone who enjoys PvM but not Skilling, I also wanted it nerfed, I was opposed to the idea because it literally circumnavigates 99% of the skill by having another player do it for you. That's not what RuneScape is about at it's core (*cries in Partner Slayer*). Rune crafting is, for better or worse, carring rune was to a altar for 97% of the time, with two ticks of banking and one tick of using the essence on the altar. ZMI running cut everything but clicking the altar out.
---
Third age is still about 10x rarer than gilded though.
---
Im an ironman so i buy soda ash and sand buckets and craft my own orbs, then charge the orbs.  You might make less profit if you buy the unpowered orbs.  Not sure how much they cost.
---
Why is everything funnier when its said by a random person in runescape?
---
I disagree entirely
---
Skills are a chore to train already, so unless they make them fun or at least skill based then i don't see why we should remove things like tick-manipulation. At least someone who is doing it is paying attetion to the game rather than someone who is half-assing it.

I have always just killed all the brothers and have always had bad luck when it comes to barrows. i dont mind it I just got the collection log for the first time today and took a look at it and found it quite funny how that was the only item in there.  As for the barrows KC. i had maybe 60ish kc before the collection log. and dont remember ever getting any items lol.
---
For real?

Haha we'll be right back after a word from our sponsor. Have you ever felt tired of waiting? Do you wish it would just come now? New sweet release formula activates within minutes. Not good enough?

---
So come on down and order today folks! Or call, fuck me!
---
Whoa okay sorry folks that wasn't supposed to happen. And we're back! Conkerts, what did you think when you discovered the truth about the iron man and the item man?
---
Not really true. You can still make around 10M training your stats from low to mid levels if you are always on the lookout for lucrative skill training. The osrs wiki has profit tables for tons of skills that update automatically with GE prices. Don‚Äôt just grind the xp mindlessly. 
---
10M is not a lot but it can buy you almost everything you need once you have decent combat stats.
---
Yeah that's him. He did a face reveal on Twitter recently
---
I don't have to ;)
---
In all honesty. How did you make 10m in f2p?
---
:thinking: im pretty sure thats my picture you yoinked there but ok
---
It wasn't until 2018 that I actually knew a lot of the osrs town names. Mostly just skipped/rearranged letters like tavelry, canfis, argdoune. never even bothered reading the whole word for prifddinas i mean what the actual fuck i can barely get past the r.

idk man I just posted this bc I thought my luck was pretty terrible at barrows. I did kill all the brothers and not only karil but idk how to prove that to ya homie so believe what ya wanna right

---
You won‚Äôt do bloods if you‚Äôre spending like 1.5B for 99rc. You would do lavas with runners or just alone, blood is for people who want afk at the expense of xp/hr.

Could buy some baseline gear for slayer. After you do quests like: waterfall, quests up to and including monkey madness, lost city, fairy tale p1+2, heroes quest, and RFD as some quests with good unlocks behind them. Then slayer grind for the big genlinor paceos.
---
MEP2 is honestly super easy I literally did the quest yesterday. Just make sure you fully read/understand whatever guide you're using and it's a piece of cake!
---
And you make 2 mistakes in the math.
---
exactly. it's not that there are no money makers, they just aren't what people expect out of a "good" money maker.
---
Still gotta get my mining up before I can do that. I like Monkey Madness I and I'm hoping II is also fun, but that's the only quest I've enjoyed.

Tan leather (using blue, red or black dragonhide, whichever is currently best) - 130k magic per hour, 450-550k profit
---
Plank make (mahogany only) - 165k xp/hr
---
100k profit
---
Like the other guy said, humidify has the highest potential with saplings, but xp and gp rates vary wildly depending on whether you are factoring in planting time and the type of seeds used

Aww how cute you made a nickname for people who support the president. How... BRAINWASHED of you.

But I don't expect a libtard to have the brain power or will power to be a free thinker and make their own opinions about things, they just spew what their controllers... I mean media overlords tell them.
---
I'd love to see the evidence you're using to make that claim.  I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm saying I doubt you have anything to prove it.
---
Because I can use the same logic to argue against it, there's also relatively high requirements to kill monsters that drop a useful amount of blood runes.  
---
1 person consistently crafting blood runes will probably produce more blood runes than what, something like 10 people doing slayer consistently?
---
There's a whoooole lot of math you're glossing over in that assumption.

It wasn‚Äôt polled, max xp/hr rates were way lower in the polls. Even if not many ppl complained it was still an unpolled change.

Drops from Wyrms, or his bolts. I'm not too sure, only noticed him when he ran over to me.

76 runecrafting though
---
The problem is that eventually they'll have to depreciate the old (case insensitive) system, so everyone that hasn't changed their password during the change period will be forced to do so then. This could cause a lot of confusion and would probably strain the support team for a while with unnecessary account recovery requests.

---
Haven't touched, haven't planned on touching it. There's no ongoing scam, unless it's being mega botted I see no reason to stamp out a player run activity that boosts one person that's willing to shell out bank to train a skill.
---
Exactly
---
Literally nobody is going to want your account
---
You can't use copyrighted files without permission even if you're not making any money from them. But I don't think Jagex would sue RuneLite anyway, there's no reason for them to do it.
---
The bigger problem is that adding HD graphics would require a lot of work but wouldn't really make the game any better. I think the RuneLite developers would rather focus on UI updates and other things that improve the user experience.
---
Cool accomplishment, but jesus christ that post title man.

It's the reddit skill and this is reddit. It may seem that way, but not everyone that plays the game posts their opinion here.

Same, i wish a perk of Elite would be that you can change the appearance in to the earlier ones!

if you do zmi with 4 runners you'd hit xp rates 180k+ if you were trading quickly, way above the 'polled rates'
---
wanted to get my point across :o?
---
This is like the DEA busting pot smokers. Meanwhile, emblem farmers get to run amok and actually affect the in-game economy with virtually no repercussions.

Let's just give everyone the option to be maxed right off tutorial island. A rate of nearly 369 million xp/h.
---
Of course it's optional and people shoukdnt be worrying about others xp/h.
---
While we're at it let's give everyone 10k KC of every boss automatically on their counter. Optional of course. Because fuck those who compete and value achievements in game. AmIRight?

The downfall of user-based editing, there is not a cohesive guideline for writing guides like this, so the standard at which they write it for is based on the authors perspective rather than a wiki-wide standard.

Also, a lot of people would consider Zulrah mid tier, 75s in range and mage are really the only stat reqs (and Regicide, but)

Yes. Kinda sucks when someone you follow turns out to be ugly. My opinion immediately changes. Haters are gonna hate in this comment, but it is a well studied fact that attractiveness changes positively your perception of someone, as well as the opposite. People just don't want to admit it.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying, though. The recovery system shouldn't just be generic data like transaction id's, my internet provider and the sort. It should have a token that Jagex generated for me and that I can safely store in paper in my home, or wherever else I feel safe. Or maybe if they wanna spend some extra resources, validating government ids and associating them with accounts is another great way of making sure you're the owner of the account.
---
If you just add a delay, the original problem persists. People can social engineer, check leaked sources and dig information on you. If you add better recovery methods, it should stop that problem at the source, instead of keeping the same flawed core with a wait period at the end that might or might not stop the hacker this one time.

In your opinion, which quest was the absolute worst?
---
Dragon boots with trim is easy one
---
&gt;irrelevant garbage that affects .1% of the community
---
Literally what ToB is
---
Looks like you also just beat him in rock, paper, scissors too!
---
is that gp or xp?
---
more people do tob than use zmi for rc
---
Fucking gold
---
hjahjahjahjahjahjaHAHA 
---
&gt; WOW
---
Yes and im saying that as they polled it the rates are correct. And it is still correct today. But for some reason they see fit to stamp out a player run method that boosts one person and the expense of their bank? Really? The fact that u/jagexwolf even tries to say that it's because trade wasn't a thing during the original update when it was is kinda slimey or just shows the company itself doesn't know it's own history??? This method was also available on the release of the og zmi altar but suddenly it's an integrity fix by implementing 2008 style fixes. Yikes.
---
found the guy who was ruthlessly bullied in highschool and projects his frustrations and insecurities onto strangers on the internet to make himself feel better about his sad life 
---
it gets better friend, it gets better.
---
Ornament kit is like 190k
---
expected. it'll be more expensive tho since running lavas is kinda aids.
---
This
---
Just because youre poor doesn't mean game integrity should be ruined
---
How much xp per hour are wrath runes? Should I switch to them over double astrals when I get the level?
---
Slayer becomes significantly easier once you have a max house though! Construction is tough on the hands but worth it
---
I'd assume you also think the Earth is flat, huh!?
---
This is exactly what I'm looking for, though I took a look through the settings and couldn't find it.
---
Nope this is just genuinely stupid.
---
If the drop is 1/5000, then every 5000 people that kills them gets it on the very first drop, on average.
---
Maths.
---
remember: "game integrity" = "we'll do what we want"
---
you can also take supplies with you and do 20 kill trips
---
This is gold
---
This is nullified by the existence of emblem farming bots.
---
They only add GP to the game, no resources whatsoever but are still there because Jagex isnt good at fighting bots.
---
Shame because if bots didn‚Äôt exist this could be a decent money maker for people that just GP for a bond or something.
---
I spent about 2 hours just finding teams and I only have enough points in Attacker, have 330 for healer. I seriously can‚Äôt stand it, pest control was less annoying for me.
---
I didn't know killing demons requires a spade.
---
Also needs more red arrows, can't quite see monsters well cuz I'm old
---
Agility is fun to train...
---
Please report back in a week. Or even a couple of days...!
---
But welcome to the club!
---
That's it, you stupid fucking bitch!
---
But lava altar isn‚Äôt double the experience per essence.. won‚Äôt come close to 200k an hour
---
If you really want to up the ante, reduce your magic accuracy to below -50, then every time the spell splashed, wait 20 seconds before attacking again, to mimic how magic worked in 2001. 
---
It was so bad, you could even fail to high alch, and have to wait 20 seconds.
---
It‚Äôs been a few days. It‚Äôs not that great but it‚Äôs really required to play the game üòÇ. Oh well. Still having fun
---
yes
---
PSA: it's faster to hop to a PVP world and use the bank chest, than to run to either the upper bank or RFD chest.
---
I was expecting crabs...
---
/u/spitsoutcereal

just use an obby plate then.
---
I‚Äôll be waiting
---
Just die so it resets
---
Nice catch-all reply. Never heard of it before. Such original thoughts are conducive of a Nobel prize. I'd go for it if I were you.
---
I figured, you're welcome :)
---
Currently doing dungeon doors. I havent heard if the 0 movement method. Ill def do some research. Thanks
---
Why is this specific case of using alts undesirable? To me it seems like it would be better as an all or nothing debate. 
---
People save thousands of hours with alts in other ways, be it from making gold or boosting their main in some form in an activity. Why savings thousands of hours at zmi any different?
---
Imagine getting a 2m clue scroll and bitching about it.
---
That's pretty bad. My worst was 2 items in 180.
---
The people who are currently doing ZMI with runners won't be doing blood runes, so there really won't be a difference in their price. 
---
The far majority of people using runners are either skillers going for 200m or wealthy people going for 99. They'll both move on to either solo lavas or lavas with runners after the change.
---
Like unnoticeable so, not many people will be paying for zmi runners in the grand scheme of things
---
more supply
---
I mean they‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs not working as intended.
---
That seems questionable. Lava Runes are only 10.5 exp while ZMI is 2x exp, which is 10 exp Air Runes to 20 exp Death Runes. The speed you craft should roughly be the same for both altars since it is based on trade speed, but Lavas also have extra steps of needing a Talisman/Imbue. Though it would probably speed up a tad since Lavas are closer to a bank so Runners could more easily do 27 Ess per trade instead of 25, but that could be avoided in ZMI too.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it at Seers but Canafis can honestly suck my nuts. So slow.
---
If it's going to be like that why not just make the whole area instanced? That way the long path vs short path thing also actually matters instead of just assuming the NPCs will be hitting someone else.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Stealing cakes as the new EHP thieving meta due to becoming 3m gp/hr :D
---
But as someone who lives in an area with not so great internet, my captchas fail to be verified most times. If they fail, I don't want to be labelled as a bot. Ergo, it's a no for me, chief.
---
You pay that much for runners? Do you know the xp rates?
---
lmfao ok but what is that video
---
How is this something that's not being polled? It costs well over 9m per hour to get these 200k experience rates everyone is talking about. If you got hundreds if not thousands of mills to throw at a skill then what's wrong with getting a high experience rate? An experience rate that still isn't on par with other buyable skills mind you.
---
&gt;That's not even relevant to this where Settled isn't even obese so he can't even help the reason you find him ugly so I don't get what your point is apart form being a prick
---
It's an analogy, dumbass
---
&gt;Where did I ever say gay sex is bad lol?
---
It's implied, your preconception of me and my intentions. You're speaking as if implicitly wanting to have sex with a guy is a bad thing.
---
&gt;Yeah of course you should treat them with the same respect is this a joke? Maybe don't take their advice or hold them to high regard on fitness but they're still an innocent human.
---
I'm not going to hold someone's opinion with respect if they don't have any respect of my visual space.
---
Kachow
---
I‚Äôve tried 4 times and have been one hit every time for messing up one prayer flick. Unlucky af.
---
chompys are really fast once you learn the fast method. You have to droptrick and get like a full inventory of bellows. then make your ammo (i think broadtip bolts better than mithril. Whatever the ones that use nails and arrowshafts) then you just keep inflating frogs and set them right where you're standing. Do this till all bellows are empty and repeat.
---
I hit 300 in a couple hours.
---
‚ÄúSomewhat decent xp‚Äù &gt;3x faster than the second best method
---
Wow!
---
12-15m per hour per runner? If so I‚Äôm gonna get in on that shit
---
I don't use runners because I'm too poor, but I always liked having the option. I do not like this update.
---
i can 100% vouch that you're not mijuzo
---
Feel you hoss. But shit man when you only get like an hour a day to play agility is the way to go for me
---
it's nice because I don't have to worry about being spoiled or staying off the internet or turning off public chat in OSRS, that's all I meant. I'm not saying that my disinterest in the MCU is a replacement for a personality
---
mind you I'm not saying my actual personality is all that interesting either
---
If you're using mouse keys to teleport the mouse you're breaking the rules and will probably get banned though.
---
Tik-tok punch challenge
---
0 movement mahogany table method too
---
I mean, I do, you're missing out really üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So the game should be changed because you couldn't spend more than 2 minutes thinking and decide to waste your vote? K
---
It costs a disgusting amount of GP to  achieve anything close to 200k exp per hour though. Is it really that big of a deal?
---
I know right, yikes
---
DPS is almost always better than defense
---
Makes sense. Need quite a bit to protect Mahog trees.
---
Biggest non-issue in the entire game.
---
tinfoil.exe
---
Its because of the agility checks you have to constantly succeed, including the 3 or 4 in a row that you have to pass and if you fail you have to redo them all. 
---
Its really only an issue if youre close to min agility required.
---
You can still do a lot of stuff with just the bgs though
---
Pretty much this. Game is great but the community has been around for so long the best are probably not social gatherers
---
Are yours? cause if so that‚Äôs dumb.
---
i would be ok with a return to the rules against alts like it used to be.
---
the main argument i have is that it doesn't just ruin rc as a skill, it ruins other skills because its significantly more efficient to do the afk methods for other skills to make more money, if you need to, to pay for runners than to do both the high effort standard methods for both skills.
---
also the fact that its paying for other people instead of just your alts is off putting to me, in a way that is hard to quantify. for example lavas + 1 alt, as shown in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URU671Zeqqc i think is a fine method, youre still basically doing traditional rc, but adding an alt for increased effort -&gt; increased xp. but in the case of zmi, people use 2 of their accounts + 2 paid runners, and their main just stands still at the altar, its fundamentally different to traditional rc and feels more like youre cheesing it.
---
Most of it is new, some of it is based on previous stuff. You can probably find a full list of updates on the wiki. osrs.wiki
---
That's so weird since it's so expensive basically nobody does it.
---
I'm only level 69 right now.
---
I always hated quests but doing them on an ironman felt like so much for fun. Every reward seemed worthwhile and actually gathering the supplies rather than just running though everything was more enjoyable
---
Do you have the discord server name? I am trying to get in on this.
---
Even funnier because in this case X is less rare than Y
---
In my opinion 1m xp per hour shouldn't be possible in any skill, I'm glad they're difficult to perform, but i'd prefer it were closer to 500-700k. The prayer and construction methods are hideously expensive, which is a point in favour of them being better, maybe 700-800k.
---
I think my psychological expectations for these methods are being set by standard training methods, usually not exceeding 100k, and you can see there's a drastic difference between 100k and 1m, even if a high degree of skill is required.
---
If karambwans became 2-tick that would make it 500k per hour and make them half as difficult. of course half as difficult isn't something everyone would appreciate, but I'd be happier with the 500k xp per hour method existing, and I'm sure some players would appreciate the more approachable difficulty.
---
But then I afked 99 cooking with sharks, so my opinion shouldn't be driving this.
---
I‚Äôm talking having high level players pay you a couple mil an hour to ruin essence
---
pipe is slightly better dps, bow costs less to use. increased speed from blowpipe barely affects profit/hr if you bring magic as well
---
Mines 0123 what's yours

BGS is also a really annoying grind and it‚Äôs a lot worse without a DWH

70s in every skill ! Posted a screeny yesterday aswell :))

---
It looks even better when it‚Äôs out in the water on the mini map.  Just got done with my 7 hour sentence from there due to a master clue.  Best of luck if your are diving into that ocean dick.
---
They likely already planned to restrict free trade when zmi came out, however, so it was a planned nerf
---
Pretty good clue tho.
---
Thank you, 25_buttholes
---
Was 4-4.5 yday. Is currently 9m/h. Could be more when more people get home
---
I was getting like 400k xp / hr with it. I did 700k xp in one sitting.
---
Jad spawns where the orange lvl 360 Mage spawns on wave 62, so you have to make sure you're in the center of the map at wave 62, so you can see the spawn point before he moves. If he spawns off screen, it's bc you left his spawn area, probably by going back to little Italy, where you cannot see them all. If you sign out during a wave, you repeat that wave. There's technically enough time to prayer switch if you relog in wave 63, but it would have to be quick!
---
Stfu league players nobody asked
---
You can't access them on them worlds. So if he was lucky to tank hits to bank, he would have lived.
---
4 deaths to the 59-63 waves...feels like I'm just hoping for lucky spawns where all 3 of the damaging dealing monsters are on me.
---
A profit.
---
100k xp/h is low, it's very easily 160k xp/h at 90+ rc
---
There are venezuelans playing this game you know?
---
You're all nerds.
---
yeah he worked for that, he got it at 1 kc lmfao
---
pets are worthless
---
if could only get pets after 10k kc or something, that would be cool
---
Not when every other kill drops brews/mushroom taters lmao
---
Or Twitter unless they need to dish out some customer support
---
there wasnt an actual raid scouted that world.
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood. I imagine it would be difficult without money for staminas or a high agil level though.
---
Good idea. That or the elder maul.
---
3210 how odd
---
"That guy failed his captcha!" "Ban him!"
---
No wait guys, misunderstanding, my internet service provider just really, really sucks!
---
Perfect way to put it
---
Enchanted robes! Remember how cool that shit looked?
---
Only if the rewards scale to relevant clue tier, so you can't get a Mimic that gives a 3A ring from an easy or med.
---
Omfg!
---
Ah fixing the real problems! Not the scammers, dice bots, or emblem mega farms. This is truly what needed to be done.
---
I wish jagex would let devs use their assests. Would take off a huge work load, people that want hd get hd. People that don't want it don't have to toggle it. Runelite gets more traffic.
---
It's a win win for everyone the way I see it. Maybe legal team would have a hissy fit. But fuck legal team
---
Relax, seems unnatural to me, but I am going to tell you the three OTHER situations that may have occurred here (Impossible to really tell what happened man, you could have just had 95m beforehand and are trying to get a laugh, who knows, right?)
---
1: Someone drop traded, and their second character was NOT where they thought it was, or it was hacked/gone and they were more concerned with something happening in real life/whatever to get to the 95m, whatever may have occurred, 95m pixel money may have not been important. 
---
2: Forgot the world, lol. Possible they closed the client, it may have switched what world they were on and they lost the gold, this is actually the most likely in my opinion, especially the lack of people around. 
---
3: Mobile misclick. Mobile has a setting where you can "click/press to drop", very possible this happened, happened to quite a few people actually when mobile was released, its their own fault for forgetting they have the setting on.
---
TBH, it sounds like number 2, because if they were using 2 clients, its possible they didn't check what world the first client was actually on, got all excited for the 95m, dropped n closed the client, and realized right afterward. 
---
Telling you from experience though, finding 95m is NOT natural, lol. 
---
EDIT: Your reply has told me something specific:
---
Please post your reply about the 2 guys to this, but basically, when RWT's scam (I know this because I have seen it like fucking 8 years ago? lol, never RWT'd), they usually buy gp from dumb people, they will tell them to "drop it" instead of trade it, and they will bring a third account into the mix to snag the "sale", the true buyer doesn't say he knows the third, just says, k, wheres the gp? Other guy responds someone took it, buyer says HE didn't take it, no sale, etc etc. 
---
This actually seems like someone who just got RWT scammed, and in my opinion, the scammer/buyer was afk likely getting his second account over to steal the money you found. 
---
I am like, 90% betting on this happening, they are likely on discord or some random chat somewhere snapping on each other, wonderful.
---
If you're gonna jeep doing vork for money, dhcb is way better than rigour. If you would like to also do zulrah/demonics then get rigour. If you would like to do raids, dhcb is solid there too (but not as good as lance)
---
Yea
---
Well if you knew who that dog was
---
You woulda clicked more carefully
---
It all started back in nam 
---
Dog was fresh out of college
---
Saved up his whole life to go at the soda pop stand
---
Sec
---
His buddy jerry
---
Not so lucky was drafted
---
It was graduation day
---
And he got the call
---
Ol jerry bit the bullet
---
He was mia
---
Never returned the body
---
He couldnt let his best friend in the worlds body be left there
---
So he enlisted
---
Few months later hes in the shit
---
Bullets flying
---
Hes shootin back wild he cant even tell where they are coming from
---
Hes just lookin high and low for jerry
---
Countless bodies some old some new
---
Suddenly the forces surrounded him
---
But his mission wasnt over
---
With a wild gust he goes rambo on their bitch asses
---
Blasting anything with eyes
---
He collected some bullets but  he didnt go down till every last one was dead
---
He falls to his knees
---
And knocks out from loss of blood
---
He wakes up 3 days later in the medical tent
---
Cute nurse cleaning his wounds
---
He tries to jump up" i have to find jerry!" he yells
---
She says oh no you dont
---
You are in no condition
---
Ive gotta find my friend he yells and too weak he goes back to sleep
---
He wakes up again
---
Old black guy named steve at the bed side next to him
---
He said did you say jerry?
---
He said yea he was my friend
---
I knew jerry helluva guy
---
We got caught together we took em out but there were alot of casualties
---
He carried 15men back
---
Myself included
---
He went back for the last man but never returned
---
Dog in a fit of rage where was it ?
---
Oh 17 odd clicks due east
---
Dog without a moment wasted rushes towards his rifle and heads out
---
He finds a base on the other side of the hill
---
Where pow were known to be held captive
---
Charlie was everywhere
---
It was a suicide mission and he knew it but if there was a chance 
---
He had to take it
---
He waits till the dead of night
---
Sneaks around rigging all the housing and cars with c4
---
Blows em all to rubble
---
Rushes to the cells where he found jerry
---
Lifeless
---
He was so tortured and beaten
---
He drops to his knees and yells noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
He heads back to camp
---
He finishes the tour they were taken out
---
He was heading back home but this time with jerry
---
But you dont unsee what that dog saw
---
Quickly hit the drugs hard
---
He didnt care anymore
---
He just wanted to die
---
Stumbles out of a bar and falls in the gutter slowly starts fading out when
---
He sees a familiar face
---
He wakes up in a lacey bed
---
Quickly leans over and throws up notices a bucket right under him and
---
A hand rubbing his back
---
Its sarah
---
That night they talked
---
He never told anyone the story
---
But that night he just let it all out
---
Thats the night sarah and dog fell in love
---
5 years later dogs got a nice job they have a house and a little one on the way
---
Sarahs 8 months pregnant
---
He still remembers old jerry and goes to his grave
---
When he gets a call
---
Theres blood 
---
Complications
---
Sarah is in the hospital
---
He rushes into the emergency room
---
The doctors say you cant be in here
---
Thats my wife!
---
Thats my child!
---
Hours rolled by from the waiting room
---
Doctor comes out .... Im sorry
---
Ever since then 
---
The dog wanders
---
Just wanting to feel a gentle touch again
---
Hoping that someday ... He will feel
---
**And u fkn just shoo-awayed it**
---
Not bad, I'm 20+ attempts in and never even got to the 60s lmfao.
---
Took nearly 800 KC before I got my heads, but I got 2 claws sub 1000 KC, so I'm not going to complain.
---
1 chest opening = 1 kc

you are neither of the people in this picture, would appreciate if you removed the post :)
---
Berserk/archer rings and work on anguish and torture neck slots. As far as DPS the fighter top will be the BIS until you get a bandos plate, which should be one of the final pieces of melee equipment you upgrade.
---
its just snake oil, replace the marines with sjws
---
Paying for a service does not entitle anyone to abuse the service provider. Just a life tip, waiters, mechanics, whatever it is, they are still a human being, and deserve to be treated as such. If I ever decided to run esscence, I expect to be treated with the respect a human being deserves. Whether you already paid me or not,  sorry bro, I'll take my services to someone else. IRL of someone abused me or an employee of mine after purchasing a service, I would refund and refuse service. 
---
TLDR: It's not hard to not be a dick
---
Mists were cheaper when I bought 100k of each ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Bullshit.
---
Honestly I just forget my account details and create another when I feel like giving my 2cents.
---
Thanks for the input u/Unexie, and you're half right. Not a large portion of the player-base will benefit directly from xp removal, though u/Person_of_Earth is correct, as it would create another way for gold to leave the game. For those that are directly impacted, they would be incredibly grateful to have a way to revive old accounts, which may consequently cause them to resub, which would be a win for Jagex.
---
Yeah...ive never been consistent with farming so I'll have to try my hardest to keep up with it lmao
---

---
It‚Äôs pretty weird that you‚Äôd judge anyone who plays a specific game because there‚Äôs others who play it that you don‚Äôt like. Thats like if I said I won‚Äôt play basketball because I don‚Äôt like Russell Westbrook.

Ty for the advice...im fucking gutted rn
---
500k per hour with addy darts at hydra
---
maybe im stupid but i cant remember teak trees, granite and barb fishing being polled
---
I always thought paying runners for essence was kind of self balancing, you exchange great profits for faster xp rates but I guess they see it as otherwise.
---
Wasnt this a inspirational quite from Owen Wilson?
---
Even if you have a scouted raid, you still can't enter. Tried it myself
---
Is try rev caves with blowpipe and your range level. Just make sure you have attack players option off.
---
Implying runescape mods wouldn't also be interested in price manipulation for their own gains. At some point you gotta take the tinfoil hat off buddy.
---

Did you by chance buy an RS3 bond on accident
---
Jad recently hit me for 76/78 hp after a misflick, and good god was I lucky that he didn't switch styles because I only realized I was alive after his second hit came barreling down.
---
I guess we should remove RC all together because you can run at every other altar
---
So... its always been a buyable skill. People will just go back to doing nature or law running and exp rates will still be decent. Not insanely good as ZMI but still insanely better than any other method out there because they have money to buy it.
---
I can 3x/4x my rates in ranging currently with chins if I want to buy that skill, same with ancients and magic, same goes for crafting, same with wines in cooking, or blast furnace is very buyable since it takes money to do as opposed to just smithing traditionally. Tons of skills are buyable, almost everyone but the gathering skills are currently buyable.   
---
At least ZMI was creating a unique P2P market interaction like older times before the GE came along, when you would go to forums and put in work orders for people to mine iron for you, or cut logs for you, etc, or nature running for both RCer and Runner profits.
---
Yet mining, hunting, etc all have tick manipulation methods that you can use to exploit the games sync and are going beyond polling rates in those and they haven't been tackled yet either. Will be interesting to see if they get looking into next.
---
I bring my explores ring 4 just so I can alch all of the rune items and carry more loot before banking
---
I was rewarded with a pair of wizzys on my 1st medium , here i am 140 mediums later with 4 pair of wizzys lol :(
---
&gt; Dude you risk your entire bank on accident like he did and see if your mind is clear to think
---
My first thought would be immediately put on prayer mage n put on my 20%'s especially since I've already tanked the 2 claw specs and run to the bank. He had a lot of time to put on range gear.
---
I have no idea why you‚Äôve been downvoted so much for such a solid comment. 
---
Too many PKers on this sub I guess.
---
Let's just hope Brad won't filter us out
---
will be same xp/hour
---
ZMI is already balanced.
---
You get great xp rates at the cost of having to pay 4 other players to run you essence and it's still pretty intensive for the crafter.
---
It's no different from players being able to buy and fletch dragon darts. Absolutely fucking nuts xp rates but it requires and equally nuts investment.
---
Not for the same xp as zmi.
---
When you're inside a building you don't see roofs by default, when outside, roofs hide buildings content.
---
When it's activated, you never see roofs. So you can actually know what's in the houses / castles / whatever.
---
It'd be better to just hide anyone from the list who has 0/0 K/D than to try and mess with lines.
---
Thanks for the advice everyone gave I feel more confident now because at first it seemed pretty intimidating. Hopefully I‚Äôll be joining the Quest cape crowd soon! Happy scaping all.

Receive an extra 25% damage?

2.3m off a hard clue is good profit for minimal effort; stop being a crybaby
---
What's the go with Emblem Farmers?  
---
Someone said that one person can set up a farm of bots which can rake in 500m/day just from Emblems.
---
Is this a concern for anyone?
---
r/whoooosh
---
I clicked to withdraw my coal bag from my bank instead of the looting bag, hence, brain fart.
---
It was polled to be a certain xp rate and it was over 4x higher I believe. The fact that it was higher than the polled rate is the only reason it was nerfed, can‚Äôt imagine it would have passed it the poll said it would be 160k+ per hour.
---
Volcanic mine was also way over the polled rate due to tick manipulation being possible and that was also nerfed a while back.
---
Yo that's not you that's fucking mijuzo
---
You realise the people who can afford it are the people who have been saying it should be nerfed for fucking ages? The only people defending ZMI running are the brainlets on reddit who have never had enough money to pay for an hour of ZMI runners.
---
I would doubt it. ZMI runners turned a low xp, high reward skill into a high xp, high reward skill. 3t Barb fishing is still fishing, gargoyle alts are still slayer, and 2t granite is still mining but ZMI runners just aren't runecrafting
---
and so is mining and other 3 tick manipulation methods. yet they haven't addressed them yet. will be interesting to see.
---
Love your series

This is years of grind gone to waste .... i loat anguish/god boots/slayer helm doing blck dragon and i still hate myself for it lol... can't imagine a couple years going yo waste like this
---
I‚Äôd probably have to do 99/99 agility shirt though since I‚Äôm kind of skinny haha. Probably a smaller chance of someone noticing what it‚Äôs from though :P
---
HE HATH SPOKEN
---
You can't telegrab them, I tried. It says "that item cannot be telegrabbed" and when you pick the dropped ones up normally they transform into the one you just achieved.
---
That's a perk I'd shell out some coins for
---
I have the tanz mutagen  but I don't remember if it's an additional drop or if it's included in the 2 standard drops you get from zulrah, which would essentially make it twice as common.
---
Hahahaha
---
wtf is talking in american?
---
Back in the day, sure. Air-running on W16 was definitely a thing, I remember doing it all the time.
---
But the key here is that ZMI (i.e. Ourania Altar) wasn't in OSRS upon release. Since the actual ZMI was released in RS2 very close to August 2007, most of the code was already done near the time the OSRS backup was from and thus they were able to finish it off for OSRS as well. When they polled adding ZMI to OSRS, they thus advertised XP rates which clearly essence-running beats. XP-running only slightly increases XP/hr at other altars -- the Abyss is way more overpowered for nearly everywhere except ZMI (this is because ZMI is way more XP/essence due to how it works intrinisically).
---
As a consequence this is actually a bug in OSRS because it doesn't meet the expectation of how it was polled, whereas it could have been considered a feature in RS2/RS3.
---
staged for rwt? I'd like to give his IQ the benefit of the doubt.
---
whoosh
---
Take the money being spent on dice bots and find a money doubler to double it, then use that doubled money on dice bots, double the chance, its a no brainer
---
That would be really lame if I'm honest. I can't even do most of the advanced tick methods; they don't get you LUDICROUSLY more experience. The amount of concentration for things like 1.5 ticking teaks is insane. I feel like that type of shit is what got me into the game, because otherwise getting better at this game is *purely* again how much time you sink into the game, and not mastery of its different mechanics.
---
Ourania Altar trading I felt was fine too. It's ludicrously expensive, requires coordination of 3 well timed and well versed players organized for the 1 guy paying them.
---
It's not possible on an ironman, and as far as I'm aware ironman is more the "true" experience.
---
for the low low cost of 12 fucking mill an hour. If someone is willing to piss away that much money I say lettum
---
oh really? the one time i didn't my mahog died. thats 3 days wasted so..
---
Don't think so. Only water spells and humidify do afaik.
---
He mosy likely got lured my a "friend" im pretty surr the dude runing nackes is the lurer
---
BaCk To FaLaDoR BoIs
---
greetings my savage goons
---
Didn't know you could make Dr Disrespect on osrs
---
Tanked a jad melee hit too
---
The lack of enforcement for macro rules is trash
---
It seems like a pretty fair tradeoff
---
welcome to RS
---
Keep at it! I'm almost to 1k and I got screwed from 2 Dragonbone necklaces
---
What were you hoping for? Yew logs?
---
It's more likely that the person just wasn't aware that the rules on dropped items had changed, and that the items would not show up on their other account if their other account wasn't already logged in at the time of the items being dropped.
---
And of course, if you're able to have both of your accounts logged in at once, you should just trade directly. There is no reason to drop-trade ever anymore.
---
It is a standard drop. You only roll for mutagens when you roll a flax drop, so it replaces the flax if you get it
---
its not a LACK of enforcement. its more ilke a 1/1,000 ratio of jmods and bots.
---
It is a concern yes, but a largely hidden one because these farms kinda sequester themselves off in weird corners of the wildy with dozen of low level accounts. 
---
Every few months a video will pop up demonstrating that they're still fucking busted, but ultimately nobody has a real solution to the problem yet.
---
Prayer flicking exist because of how the engine works, i don't see it can be changed unless with drastic measures like the 10x update in Rs2.
---
Efficacy
---
I got through ~200 kills before I learned there was a quickstart option.
---
Dang couldve pulled my imaginary gf
---
I recommend getting an ogre comp bow and buying rune brutal arrows, then use max range gear. It's the max dps.
---
Nope
---
Try [this](https://pastebin.com/m0uhKMUd) script I wrote, just replace *'&lt;&lt;&lt;REDACTED&gt;&gt;&gt;'* with the form's url. It will post *niters* (default 10) random email/password combinations for each proxy, of which there are generally ~200.
---
It randomly chooses between an old-style username, and a gmail address. It uses an english dictionary to produce usernames/emails/passwords, and generates passwords with random lengths.
---
Should be pretty difficult for them to filter because the requests won't match any easily-determinable pattern, and with the proxies they can't just filter out all requests coming from your IP.
---
I've run this on a few different phishing links just for fun. No way to know if it's doing much on their end but one can hope.
---
Most underrated osrs content creator out there. Love this guy
---
I thought they learned to care about game integrity, how naive of me!
---
The colors made you stick out so much. In a good way
---
I did it, took me like 20 minutes
---
&gt;Is this actually a viable method of making money and what stats/gear/other stuff would one need?
---
I mean it is right now, but won't be Thursday lol. 75 rcing required for giant pouch. Also bear in mind that with a mere 3 days left, probably everyone and their brother is scamming right now cuz they know for sure they won't need to do it anymore.
---
When I ask, ‚ÄúWhy did mom go to the store?‚Äù i expect, ‚Äúto buy milk‚Äù and not your bullshit opinion on the philosophy behind why she went to the fucking store. A guy asked why they did it, the guy told him what Jagex said, how is that concept difficult for you to understand? Instead you went on a meaningless and douchey rampage towards the guy who answered the damn questions. The original dude didn‚Äôt ask, ‚Äúwhat are your opinions on what Jagex did‚Äù you god damn fucking idiot. You‚Äôre literally delusional, holy shit. Try reading and thinking before you speak for once and chill the fuck out
---
Dee, you dumb bitch!
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
I'm surprised ZMI is nerfed.
---
If the problem are ALT accounts then why not just make it so you can only log in one account at a time?
---
Who am i kidding we are living in the end times no bad events are a suprise.
---
Sure, and most end-game content can definitely be completed with just tanking + overheads, BiS gear, and lots of potions and food. Raids 1 and Raids 2 are both definitely doable using standard techniques if you know how they work.
---
It's just the Inferno that's the exception TBH. I'm wondering if they will start to balance more content around this (mostly guesswork given how that poll blog seemed to present The Gauntlet as a very tough challenge, but they said the same thing about The Inferno before it was released).
---
birdhouses?
---
Yeah 28 us marines
---
Sara sword is better.
---
Maybe. I mean I still remember weeks ago I saw 8 uncut rubys for 100gp.
---
I just checked a few things in bitterkoekje's calculator, and it seems like ferocious gloves just barely make bandos etc the better option.
---
Testing against general graardor's stats with ghrazi rapier, avernic defender, amulet of torture, infernal cape, primordial boots, and imbued berserker ring:
---
- Serp helm+bcp+tassets+ferocious gloves came to 4.644 dps. Using barrows gloves instead came to 4.474 dps.
---
- Elite void came to 4.557 dps, making it better than if using barrows gloves, but worse than if using ferocious gloves.
---
It could be that there is something wrong with the calculator or with my parameters, but it seems like void is not as bad as I thought it would be. Even against ammonite crabs it's only about 4% worse than max melee.
---
&gt;Near perfect tick efficiency
---
&gt;Trade, click altar, wait 30 sec, repeat.
---
Please pick one.
---
God wars bush? Are there bushes in God wars?
---
It is pretty bad on the hands though, I wish it wasn't so intensive
---
Like I stated in the 2nd part, you can "fire" someone a bit more gracefully, but Im sure you would be salty if you pay for someones services and then they don't deliver whats promised.
---
dtEqAD8 is the invite code.
---
You need 75 rc, incase you didn't know.
---
How do I upvote twice
---
Then who am I gonna call a noob?
---
You're getting the fastest XP for a skill that's otherwise annoying to train. That's reward. 20m/hr for ZMI xp rates is a really ideal trade for players who hate Runecrafting
---
Dragon dildos my friend.. req lvl 60 riding to equip one though.
---
Very pointy
---
tons of people do it, some just run themselves on alts
---
I don‚Äôt like your YouTube stuff but this is awesome!
---
Shoulda bought a shitload of monkey nuts instead ya goof
---
Indeed he, pretty sure rs3 still has the running nature runes and running law runes worlds
---
I would regularly use it when I grinded easy clue cause it‚Äôs shorter to the Duke than the south ladder.
---
Flicking is infinitely more effort. You have to be cycle-perfect with your attacks and the NPC's attacks. One miss on, say, the 360s in the Fight Caves, and you're dead or quite nearly dead. Compare that to wearing prayer gear, turning on overheads, and clicking once and watching until the mob dies.
---
I think that if someone wants to put in ridiculous amounts of effort, that should be rewarded just as wearing prayer gear should be rewarded over taking non-prayer gear.
---
I agree with the other commenter -- what's wrong with having both? It's not like flicking is popular or all that commonplace. Certainly prayer gear isn't being devalued by prayer flickers.
---
How do u check that?
---
PVPing is what got him into the problem in the first place ;)
---
I WAS FUCKING THER3!!! HE TANKED FOR AN 8
---
Way to nitpick one thing, to discredit all the other problems. Also just because bots weren't there today, could also mean that the owner just moved them to a new location. After being "exposed" 2 videos in a row, it would only make sense.
---
I realise... that's what an ironman account is for. If the player is worried about doing it the "right" way than they have an option for that. This was a legitimate money making method that very few people in the game could even afford.
---
O dam I assumed people would run for another altar.
---
"This track unlocks in the dragon area of Brimhaven Dungeon."
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Karamja_Jam
---
It's a 1/40 or 1/44 (don't remember) drop from a Mimic kill. So it's actually pretty common if you get the chance to kill him. 
---
The chance of getting to fight him is 1/35 for elite caskets and 1/15 for master caskets
---
Well shit
---
Couldnt he have used radas blessing tp to escape?
---
My hard clues seldom ever break 100k in value, so it's kind of hard to have sympathy.
---
Same people who think any, and all drops with a drop chance of 1/128(or 1/X) are on the same table.
---
Looking at you ironmen who bitch about rings of life.
---
Hes nearly 52 rc now lol!! (Rc slow btw)
---
Wait so void is better then?
---
I‚Äôm 99-99 and have augury
---
talk to the collector in the varrock museum :) he will give ya the collection log
---
Did u buy on the wrong account or something
---
Looks like we both had the same idea, at the same time. School interfered, now I have all day to finish them up but I'm so lazy and don't want to do anything.
---
Fuck you
---
/s
---
Gz you lucky fuck, I'm 90 agi no squirrel
---
lmao "dickhead"
---
I did my fletching all with touch screen, but as far as I can tell touch screen would be faster. To make one set of darts on touch screen, you just tap twice. To do it with mousekeys, you press 5,2,5, which is 3 inputs.
---
Try checking the the upper level at the nrth of the dungeon, and the task-only metal dragon cave at the south of the dungeon. I know I have that track unlocked, and those 2 places are the only parts of brimhaven dungeon I can remember going to.
---
Why the fuck did you take 10m questing
---
Ohhhh I thought it waa the other way around. Well thank you!
---
 But having runners was the OG way to train runecrafting with laws
---
The problem presented is everyone's standard for running is technically different yeah? Anything that is not tick perfect is less than what is expected from the ZMI abuser, and the runner can be anything from a professional to a noob trying to make some cash. And if was just "firing" it might make sense, but this man (in my anecdote) literally just trash talked his runners, and they just took it passively, sometimes apologized. Good for them for stomaching that, but IRL or over a game I feel no need to indulge in that kind of self-flagelation at the whim of a bully for monetary gain. 
---
If I go to the mechanic, and he tells me they don't have the part, it'll be a week before it gets there, I'm not gonna insult him, his intelligence, oe his person. I just can't see the need to.
---
Because lava runes are cheaper than both fire and earth runes so there is never a reason not to use them in place of the basic elemental runes
---
Got one on my first medium clue as well :) Sold it for 36 m too
---
What are those bots for? I just realized I see them a bunch too, always 40 att, high str, 70 range and 1 in everything else
---
Tbh the answer should always be doing easy/med/hard clues for whoever asks. They are decent money and have a jackpot item
---
Or 1t karambwans and 1.5t teaks.  Both give stupid exp in exchange for attention.  At its core, this game is about these trade offs.
---
standards for runners are somewhat high. if you're apart of the "runemake slow" movement you probably won't be able to make much money at all.
---
Nope. I've never done it, and even if I could afford it I never would due to the absurd price. But it shouldn't be nerfed.
---
also no it actually isn't, Konar also says Freminnik Slayer Dungeon. sooo
---
I mean I'd go for stats that are gonna be helpful or are fun to do. For example, 99 hunter means you can barehand lucky imps, 99 (or 96 boosting) allows to you to plant as many spirit trees as you want. If you're interested in pets that could also be a good way to grind - I find Herbiboar pretty fun to do skillingwise.
---
Yeah, I know about the "Mega Rare" table on the Hard/Elite/Master Clue reward pools. But it's simply people keep thinking the 3rd age table pieces are merged with the "Mega Rare" table (aka gilded/potions table), which is not the case. As you correctly noted in your comment, it's simply the access to the "3rd Age" table and it occupies only 1 slot on the (now) fairly large(?) "Mega Rare" table.
---
Rolling 1/351 AND THEN rolling 1/1x for 3rd age table access (was originally 1/10, but we have more gilded now) is not exactly easy and people need to stop throwing a hissy fit when they see potions or gilded pieces.
---
Go charge ur phone
---
It was the only skill you could pay someone else to do everything but the exp drop for. Whether Runecrafting needs a rework is a different conversation, but IMO that was the big problem in my eyes.
---
That's semantics. Judging from the comment you replied to, it's obvious that he meant PvP-enabled = wilderness.
---
You act like that's how they get those 130k+ exp rates an hour at zmi.  Those dudes are spending mills, and trading literally every second they're not crafting runes.  They hire more than one person to run ess.  There's 0 waiting.
---
the joke is that if he did more pvp he wouldn‚Äôt be having sex in the first place 
---
high brow joke i know
---
Jagex only listen to the people with 99rc about it not being shit, while they know it is the least trained skill and refuse to make it more tolerable
---
Yep, agreed! I'm so tired of seeing those kind of complaints, omg lol.
---
Yeah that's true.
---
I think it was Mod Wolf, or he's discussed adding this on stream. I've nearly had a heart attacka few times from this
---
What do trade restrictions have to do with anything?
---
Like a savage, correct. I do use small windows if I'm watching shit though
---
Nibba you still gotta use magic to get the final product, correct me if I'm wrong but I still think that means getting magic XP alongside multiple other skills while still making 80gp every bow. From the way I look at it, it seems to be an ok method for training 
---
Lel
---
Drop your clue before they kill you, it'll be waiting for you when you crawl back to your corpse
---
Spin flax spell
---
Spitballing ideas here, what if the bounty store sold identical items that were made to have no alch value?
---
Bless your heart. This is as pretty as you are.
---
I was doing about 1,000 kills a week up until about a month ago. Lately I have been doing less, but still a consistent ~100 per day when I can. I get about 28 kills/hour when focused, so you could call that 430 hours
---
4 runners but you can alt 1-2, which is considered the efficient way to do it.
---
Iirc i got alot of them from farming contracts
---
This wins.
---
That's all.
---
It‚Äôs literal bug abuse too lmao
---
So you have no problem with other methods using runners?  Im curious what the xp rate is for lavas or other combo runes are normally and then with runners.  I imagine there will be away to get similar xp/hr and with how much it cost at ZMI, I'm sure the price cant go too much higher.
---
Afaik the nail beasts sound effect is bugged and plays 3x louder than anything else in the game on top of already being a horrible sound.
---
Hey a real answer lmao Ty
---
Sorry was wearing my slayer helm
---
Nah man, the LBS is almost as good!
---
I've never once used it, and I disagree. If people wanna spend ridiculous amounts of gp for good xp/h so be it. Speak for yourself on this one chief I wanna be rich in the game one day and enjoy the fruits of my labor.
---
Sounds like you should start grinding for pets, slayer helm recolors, etc.
---
yeah worth it, 10k is a lot of hits don't stress
---
I also 1-tick flick Slayer, and yes it's pretty forgiving. I'm pretty lenient with the 0.6s window and almost never miss.
---
But it's actually still above the skill level of a lot of people. It took me a few weeks to learn and it obviously requires focus to maintain it. The only reason I do it is because I can't buy more supplies, so I try to be extremely frugal with my limited amount.
---
I'm biased but I don't think flicking is hard -- it just requires practice. But a lot of people don't want to do it because it makes things not AFK. That's still not a good reason to remove it. It's not like Slayer is _supposed_ to be AFK. If you want to PVM "actively", then it's nice for there to be a method for it (i.e. Protect from Melee + Piety or whatever other combos you can think of depending on what you're killing and what you're using).
---
when the ghost moves instantly switch to next prayer
---
Mmm, your example would be closer to having a merch clan of 20+ people buy out every single daxe or something to drive the price up, which is also heavily frowned upon/discouraged by jagex afaik
---
Real Bwana shit
---
Yeah, fuck Runecrafting. I'm not selling my soul to the god of repetition just to make some chump change. There's a reason most people have RC as their lowest skill. Fuck. That. Shit. .
---
BRO NO WAY
---
I will not be stopping until I get my first one. =] Then a long break before I go for the other one. Thanks!
---
Also paying a clan an exorbitant amount of money to let you leech a fighter torso in a few hours
---
I f Jagex is going to remove this running, why stop there?
---
Also they are referencing that gay marine song
---
My UIM is an efficiency sin. I mostly outfit hunt. Current going for all mystic robes then infinity with dark ornamental kit
---
you cant click the spec orb in pvp you dingus
---
this is a joke thread but they really should add a 1-click teleport to duel arena and reduce the rate of pouch degradation
---
How are you suppose to have time for your newborn and 99 slayer? Do you not work? Do you bot? Do you afk while she's awake and grind as she sleeps? I'd like to know!
---
Regex &gt; Jagex confirmed
---
Perhaps the halo would work
---
well when you literally do the math incorrectly...
---
im going base it off 75+ so you have the good pouches. pre 75 is not relevant. 
---
75k an hour vs 180k an hour. 11.8m xp needed. 4 runners at 4m an hour takes 66 hours. solo lavas is 157 hours. 90 hours saved 1056m spent. 12m an hour. thats very reasonable, without alts. if you play alts it makes even more sense to buy runners.
---
people who are paying zmi runners aren't using an alt to run lavas for themselves, thats just you trying to be as dishonest as fucking possible with the numbers to make it look not so bad.
---
zmi is was very overpowered.
---
You can just call it that marine song, same meaning.
---
How else to play RuneScape other than numbing my mind to do RC :)
---
Ahh, classic Jagex. 
---
Patching something years after people have taken advantage of it. 
---
If you really thought this was a problem, why wasn't it done earlier? Makes no god damn sense like 80% of their decisions.
---
Wrong thread
---
You only need to kill one for it to count btw. Its happened to me a couple times. Because of this, you can also always force spawn them somewhere else if you don't like where they spawned the first time.
---
No, it's not. Your sample size is definitely a lot smaller than most peoples who are making 6m+/hr at ToB. Look at his sample size, 700, compared to your 150. Almost 5x your sample. If you're running ToB with less than 1m/hr then you're doing something VERY wrong. Probably dying 20 times/raid and getting cabbages nonstop?
---
Very cool thanks
---
Not to mention a 2 character name which are highly targettable.
---
He has said similar things for a very long time but  he clearly enjoys 2 tick pure ess mining more than pking
---
Trust Jagex to nerf it almost 3 years after release. What's the point lol? I've never seen anyone complaining about it.
---
