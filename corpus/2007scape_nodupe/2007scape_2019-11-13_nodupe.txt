You just put the guthans on when you need to heal, so not much dps sacrifice.

Holy shit you’re dense af
---
I’m making a guess here, but I think it’s because other dragonstone jewellery can be recharged outside of the wilderness. ROW can be recharged exclusively at the fountain of rune; the scroll probably doesn’t work on them to try and keep a reason for people to have to go there other than extra teleport charges.
---
Actually?
---
83 construction is worth it no matter what method you use, the ornate jewelry box and best rejuvenation pool are so nice to have
---
None of them are unique anymore.
---
Just bank them and cook on a range, less burn rate. Especially at hosiduis range
---
Can people stop fucking asking how rare their drop is jesus christ
---
That’s an oof if I’ve ever seen one.  
---

---
If it makes you feel any better I got my squirrel back from insurance not 20 seconds before seeing this post.
---
It is. In fact the only time I'd say guthans is good is off task, without slay rings and unable to take the chains up. Otherwise using a good dps weapon, whip or better would be best always.
---
No
---
first one should just say "rs" tbh
---
Why’s he talkin like a road man

There's a general belief among players that introducing more money sinks is always a good thing however lately some have been arguing that the supply of GP is stable as it is and what we really need are *resource* sinks. From the perspective of your developers are either of these ideas true? How do you guage the need for money/resource sinks?

What style of hair does your character have?
---
Thank you. :)
---
I dunno man I asked you a simple question and you didn't answer it, maybe you're the dense one
---
That hurts even more now. Im getting stacked out for 10hp constantly trying to get my cash back from the top of the pyramid. Heres my 4th trying to finish a lap. Fk me for doing this at 52
---
Because it takes forever to find people if you are a pker to the point that all there is are scout bots and baits for 20man ancestral teams to abuse the NO PJ SYSTEM and slap you. Not to mention this would make items go UP in price because there would be more demand and DANGEROUS to go for the items in the wilderness. Remember, the WILDERNESS is the only dangerous place left in RUNESCAPE. Pvm has no risk for dying with BiS gear.
---
Damn, TIL. It's like 800-1000 gp \*per rune 2h\*
---
My laptop decided to die so I'm not even sure if I will give it a shot...
---
Right? I totally agree, I mean even if I really enjoyed it or whatever, wouldn't you be embarrassed? Just look at the comments on the 1atatime post legitimately saying stuff like "this is sad" and "get help"
---
I mean shit I'd be self conscious wearing a max cape lol
---
Yeet
---
Shhhhh they'll fix it.
---
Anger
---
Crtl+w while at the duel area will grant you luck
---
They don't really exist with a 45-second pj timer. I could actually fight back then. They basically are overpowered because a solo pker has no retaliation. By the time I get 2 hits on them from auto-retaliate on a 20man fall in I get pjed by the next guy. PvP is dead because of them and the fact players can't fight back.
---
how about the first few people to lend him 100m, 200m, 500m? people who have supported him for years and donated tons etc? seen him pay back before now second time they get scam. why we victim blaming and not seeing how scumbag this is? u his sub? his mod?
---
Only 1k upvotes til op get unbanned
---
I'll admit I'm wrong this helped a lot, thanks for the info!
---
Upvote. I'm doing MY part!
---
You know you can just ignore content if you don’t want to risk anything, right?  Not that it matters anyway because this impling will never get made.
---
Customization would be cool, but doing what you suggested would make the left side UI utterly useless for nearly everything in game
---
Can you elaborate on what you’re trying to say, I’m confused over the context you’ve put your statement. 
---
What are you trying to say here? I can’t tell whether you’re agreeing or disagreeing with OP.
---
That's like saying all mains are crashers because op is a main.
---
Lol for me a max cape at least is a goal though that has reasoning behind it. 200m exp in a skill holds no value. There are so many games out there worth playing, it just seems like a shame almost to waste all that time on a pointless thing in osrs when you could spend it doing something worth while. I get it if someone loves a game and wants to max out in it, or accomplish 100% or all achievements etc. But there is usually a reason behind that. 200m exp though like i said just has no actual value.
---
Well I didn't sell my dhcb nor my lance so I'm okay lol. I never have luck in these kind of situations so I didn't even try
---
I tried Kraken outside of an instance just once, after 20 kills some guy in maxed gear just strolls in and takes it over out damaging me (and clearly would every time if I stayed) so fuck that. Instance every time.
---
My only point is there's other issues that affect prices too, BH didn't ruin everything over a weekend. Also he was being a dick ig was my side point so
---
Lms is my favorite thing in osrs, the bots suck :(
---
Oh ok that would make sense if the wilderness was un accessable on every other world if thats what youre saying then id agree. However if they are saying that only 20 worlds have pvp and the rest are for pvm's to kill bosses without the risk of dying then id say that is a dumb idea
---
I bet you're not even region locked you casual scum. Ironman updates always ruin my even more hardcore experience
---
I was like you and just kept grinding Slayer.  Once I got high enough to do gargoyles and wyverns money was never a problem again.

The most impressive stat is runecrafting because he hasn't committed not living yet.

If the Venezuelans gold farmers don't get banned despite people mistakenly reporting them as bots constantly then there doesn't seem to be too much to worry about.
---
It is definitely an issue but this subreddit can make things seem worse than they are sometimes.
---
Good point, it's just so immensely pointless, I mean some skills you've actually got to spend millions of GP to gain XP just for a leaderboard, it's insane
---
Too fat to type back. Lmfaooo

Didn't you scam a tbow?

why'd you capitalize "RUNESCAPE"? I probably would have went with "Remember, the WILDERNESS is the only DANGEROUS place left in Runescape."

One of the funniest videos to ever exist
---
Gz mitch
---
Some JMods have actively admitted that they hate PvP on stream, I don't think it's much of a conspiracy. Not to mention, Jagex tends to go with whatever Reddit says, and about 101% of Redditors hate PvP (not just in this sub, but every sub for every MMO game that isn't exclusively PvP; ie: CS:GO). With a 1% margin of error, of course.
---
Ah yes, the legendary Hydra Mole.
---
Just happened to me too...literally just a dds and a burning ammy. My sympathy for pvp content died with my clue scroll.
---
Lmao
---
I'm so sick of this... Went to play for the first time in months and boom perma banned and can't repeal it so much time and money wasted agai..
---
100m RC tho, uh

Was it gilded?

Suggestion: Make gilded spade actually usable to dig with so I can grab one and clue hunt with it.

Yes I have the spirit tree workin on lummy elite so I don’t need the seamen staff anymore

maxed 75 att pure. whatsup buddy
---
How to take a proper screenshot
---
By 4x drop rate for kbd you have a 98% chance of having at least one pet drop. 
---
Increasing the drop rate after this for the 2% of people who haven’t got one after 4x drop rate would be so insignificant it’s not even relevant. 
---
I don’t think they should do this, Only because it’s a waste of time to code it in. It would not affect the game at all. I would say the amount of people with 4x drop rate on a boss with no pet for that boss is single digits.
---
Ah yeah let’s keep pushing the anti PvP agenda bullshit. Nobody cares that you died for your spade.
---
I volunteer to run their entire support division.
---
Regular School RS, or RSRS
---
I’m keeping the typo
---
I have mine highlighted
---
I would play again if they had a Vanilla server with GWD. Or something around then (it doesn't really matter).  
---
Or if they removed mobile and had a robust bot detection system servers where players could verify that they're a person somehow. 
---
Either one of those and I'd come back.
---
I know it isn't popular anymore but I preferred the game after GWD and before the G\\E. I felt like that was the most fun, because I liked gathering extra quest items to give to my clanmates when they asked 'does anyone have an X?' I felt like that made for a good environment, now you either play completely by yourself or go to the G\\E.  
---
I felt like I had to do PvM at a certain point, but not even PvM that I wanted. There was no good reason to not camp Zulrah or Vorkath.
---
Old content being completely trivialized by the T-Bow, Stamina potions and BP is kind of lame, imo. 
---
Doing GWD with Guthans and Rune C'bow is a world of difference compared to today, lol.
---
I also feel like there is way too much damage in PvP.
---
They got the satisfaction of killing you.
---
If you want to single pk go pvp worlds. If you go deep wilderness in singles looking for fights you’re just wasting your time anyway or you’re hunting PvMers.
---
No lol
---
How? I could fight back and kill them ez if I could't be PJd and can actually give them a nice focus.
---
They tried a wildy imp before I believe and it failed a poll.
---
My thoughts exactly

Is that an arclight?

ranarrs are the best profit

Sounds like you woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Maybe take a chill pill?
---
Skillers still get to vote even if bots automated our function away.
---
But really it's a good question I might answer it later. I'll note that we haven't seen job loss to automation so far as new jobs at simple created, I would expect this to always be the case as long as the consumers are human.
---
Who is crying? You?
---
Careful you get randomly banned for liking the game too much.
---
He obviously just stole it, or rwted it.
---
Perhaps. I see this more as a direction then a change. The LMS Rework not being polled was largely overlooked, but now that the BH Rework was also unpolled and has had some more serious consequences, it does raise some questions on where they want to go with polling. Of the options I posed, while the former is more of what most would expect, I don't think either option is a bad approach as long as it resolves any issues with community feedback not having the impact it should.
---
LOOOOL this is my favorite video ever
---
am i the one posting one of the daily 500 posts "hurr i got killed for spade durrrr" shut up already. Dont want the possibility of dying in the wild? dont go in. simple. We will always attack anyone we see.

Trix R4 Kidz and whorblore my and my brothers accounts, false banned for major macro neither of us have ever been banned before. Now we can’t even appeal for something we never did. Hours and 12$ a month poured into a game to just be taken away for no reason. Jagex must look into this!
---
and wasted like 50k in pots/runes/arrows/food on me. Its not a big deal, I just thought it was pointless

Both banned at the same time while we were training together

It's got the hallmarks of being a phish or RAT.
---
Has he downloaded any 3rd party clients recently? Did he try to log into any of those quitting streams or forums? Maybe ask him to check his history around the time. 
---
The phishing ones are so quick and they DDOS you to kick you off as soon as you've input login/pin/auth (so they can use that auth in the same minute that it's active). 
---
The RATs would use his computer which may have the option selected to remember this login in which case they wouldn't need authenticator.

Did and they denied me again, one on the dates was like 6 years ago.

GWD has instances?

Valid points. I didn't know it already sold the potions

i quite enjoyed the quests, and the entire beginning of my account was centered around getting the quest cape. they also serve a very important purpose of making high payout content less prone to bots. no, it isnt perfect, but theres a reason you seen 1000x as many bots at places with little to no quest requirements than say, zalcano or vorkath.  
---
in addition, if everything just cost gp, you have 2 issues. first, quest rewards can feel very rewarding to a lot of players. getting my barrows gloves was way more satisfying than buying my bcp for example. quest rewards also allow lower level players a path to upgrades before they can make money. look at the neitznot vs serp helm/faceguard, imagine if the next step after rune full helm cost multiple millions, that would be a miserable experience for lower levels with no path of progression

Claws of guthix with void knight maces is pretty good and better dps than ibans
---
I'm inclined to disagree with your overall point. I dislike quests that are just run simulators (i.e. One Small Favor), but I personally enjoy a lot of the quests that have combat and story lines. Dragon Slayer II in particular was some of the most fun I've had and it felt very rewarding to complete. Plus I enjoy learning some of the lore behind the "shitty dialogue".
---
My counter argument is that efficiency-scape is killing questing because everyone only wants to play if it's maximum efficiency and questing doesn't fall in line with that.
---
What happened to people just enjoying the game because it's fun? Obviously I fall victim to the max eff, too, but man. It makes me miss being a child playing this game.
---
Yep, you see it all the time here. One of the defining features of autism is the inability to understand sarcasm.

Spare God pages and Blessings.

I'm an ironman thats to stingy to throw away duplicate blessings/god pages. however they take a lot of bank space.

Could you please consider some type of binder available by Jossik in the lighthouse which can store spare blessings and god pages?
---
In terms of slaying with chaeldar, my advice is to not slay with chaeldar. Go to nieve asap. Too many "bad" tasks on the fairy's list. 
---
Only super slow one from nieve would be black demons, (or metal drags if they aren't blocked already) As well as being way more accessible, nieve is where you start making real money from tasks. Im assuming you wouldn't want nieve to assign tasks that are too difficult for you, but I would really highly recommend going nieve asap
---
yes, opinions are lile assholes, every one has one and sometimes they're shitty

I
---
By valuable loot do you mean in the 10k go range or more? If it's the lower amounts, it's probably richer accounts cleaning their bank.

Either way, yeah, pick it up if you want to.

will smith on?

HAHAhaha Wow!

I have 99 crafting on my hc and normal IM

Both took less than a month to 99.
---
It is spanish, he is talking about one time he worked at a restaurant.
---
save for big ticket items like dhcb, lance, sang staff(for solo raids)., this sorta deal.
---
the armors are not a high priority, you get them all last- bandos then ances then arma is typically a good order.
---
Yep
---
nieve/dura tend to assign easier tasks overall...
---
I remember getting hit vividly often so that's all I can say :p
---
Honestly this is great content, you only need to sacrifice 1 item slot and doesn't introduce a PvE BiS. This would make fights much more fair.
---
I'm not super wealthy. Prob 2 mil in cash and 6 mil worth of stuff. I have like 300ish points right now but I figured I should save them and not use any on skipping?  Since if a task really is impossible I can try to safespot.
---
Damn, this series is so entertaining, keep it up.
---
I don't really watch streamers, I just know view botting is common and struggle to think that that many people actually want to watch that garbage. Still, is the internet I suppose.
---
What are you gonna do now?
---
You seem salty about losing ur status but i wanna let you know even the best players eventually die. I would continue playing as a regular IM but looks like U're willing to restart.
---
It would be used in clan warfare for sure.
---
Yeah me either. Just like any other untradeable that's kept on death. But its too late to revert because of the countless of lost pets.
---
Lol all the people that mobile brought in are leaving because this game is dumb.
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
The only ones I've found worth making were super combat at 97 herb? But tbh I like playing the lottery with the Elven Crystal Chest haha
---
I saw a similar idea on Reddit earlier this year that I liked. A bit different since it wasn't wearable, but maybe have a sink you can build in your kitchen called a "gold sink" that costs some ridiculous amount of cash. And a visitor to your house can examine the sink and it says how much money you've flushed down it
---
super secret tip for a a few episodes in the future if you want.
---
You can tick eat gnomeish food like a karambwan, super obscure but it works on all gnomish food I believe, including the premade ones.
---
guys an asshole. so are you for crashing (even though crashing isn't against the rules it still makes you an asshole)
---
Haha...what part 4
---
Yes.
---
just way too rng based especially in corrupted mode. too much bad luck and your run is pretty much unsalvageable.
---
only 100m to go - at least you wont be alone now :D
---
tldr: Have two accounts, one of which I don't remember even having and it gets banned. Give them all the info for acct 1 and acct 2 gets unbanned.
---
The exact opposite happened to me when I was getting back into it and playing oldschool. I have a super oldschool account from the RS2 days and at some point must have made a newer one with the same old email. I don't remember if got an email and that started this or went to log in using my email instead of old username, but I realized I'm banned. So I freak out and start sending in a ticket. I fill out whatever info I remember (remember I only know I have the ancient account) from years back. I tell them hey I just got X skillcape yesterday, last login was about X hours ago from this IP, about this much cashstack. They reply back that I'm unbanned later on. I go to log in and all of a sudden I'm on some account I never remember making that almost 0% of the info I gave them would have matched at all. Looking at the skills I'm almost sure it was hijacked being woodcutting botted.
---
One torstol run is around 1.5 magic trees worth of xp, so you save 220k+ and profit around another 200k from the herbs so if it takes you 10 minutes at 400k net gp earned you'd have to make 2.4m an hour to make it worth it. Not difficult to make that kind of money by any means but it does make it worth my time in my opinion.
---
Onyx bolts (e) are almost always good to alch (Can buy off GE faster than you can alch + they profit)
---
I didn't realize this until 96 Farming as well, also 91 Farming on my alt. Felt mentally challenged for days after that.
---
Sweaty hours played. If a skill has a 400k/hr tick perfect method and you do 200k in 5 hours then you gained 0.5ehp.
---
Crystal chest is fun if you'll never have the herblore for super combat.  None of the others are worth anything really.
---
Nah i was on the way to greatness, whip fury full barrows berserker 219 qp  fire cape etcetcetc, I'm not salty, surprisingly numb, I think I'd have an absolute stake through my heart normally.
---
I'm already gyming again, my life is literally this. Started my hcim in March, averaged about 8 hours a day I think. With this I'm just done :p 60 days played to die to a fire giant made me laugh.

I've missed too many days of sunshine to play regular ironman haha
---
Ds2, Mm2, And the new freemy quest left. Can’t get past galvek.
---
It depends on your playstyle, goals, and what you already have.
---
You have a few options:
---
Put into buyable skills
---
Buy pvm gear/supplies to train/boss with
---
buy 70 prayer (suggested if pvming)
---
[Gp fasionscape sink](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crystal_crown)
---
It's too difficult to give general advice like this. All I can say is, pick a mid-long term goal, and fund your path to it.
---
Yeah, now I dont have a family OR a wife!
---
Is crashing a reportable offence?
---
no?
---
Primarily either charging the Crystal items (armor, tools, blade) as well as divine potions, but can also do the crystal chest (gives some profit with chance for dragonstone armor which is worth a decent bit, + gives 100 crafting and smithing xp per shard you use
---
You're really gonna do a ~100 hr grind to make a ~20 hr grind easier?

I'm aware that people have different tastes. I still struggle to think and understand what makes people like what I view as complete garbage, but nevertheless understand that there's a taste for everything, no matter what it is. It is just one of those things that seems weird to me.

Konar gives so many slayer points compared to Nieve that you can skip a task for every two you complete and come out the same. I don't know about you, but I wasn't needing to cancel tasks anywhere near that often at Konar before I switched to Duradel. 
---
Agree with OP, Konar is underrated and the "task in a bad location" thing is blown way out of proportion. I used cannon/ice burst all the time while using Konar
---
You really shouldn't post pictures of your keys. You just published the coding of your key to everyone on the internet. That makes it trivial to produce a copy and steal whatever it is locking.

Basically you just posted the password to your car.

Exactly this right here, if your chaps in the UK don't want to slave away for minimum wage 8 hours a day then outsource a team to a country that would kill for those wages. (then slice the pay in half)

You can drop the trail and immediately be eligible for a new one. I would suggest using clue scrolls as a goal of sorts. Setting yourself up for 40 range to complete a clue gives motivation to advance your account. Could be ranger boots, good luck.

Op is just as square as the other guy

I'd do notherlode mine if youy still having hard times getting money. That's still a bit of early game stuff. At a certian point you are going to notice that money is worthless, and you have a hard time throwing it away once you finish construction.

You can use your login to play both rs3 and osrs. Memberships also work for both games. If you have your original account, you can play osrs on it but all accounts start from lvl 3.

I play rs 'cause it's fun, and it distracts me from the fact that I'm 27 and don't have a job, never been on a date with a girl, and that my life so far has been a total waste as is likely my future.
---
More heads!!

How?
---
TeaShirt has a vid on barrows lore. In it he mentions sliske brings it from another realm i believe. Give it a watch

Don't... Don't you have a red hat on?

You know just for that. I hope you end up getting banned for doing nothing. Sorry not sorry

he was trying to say take him out to a nice dinner maybe drinks. wtf you doing?

You are incorrect. You can even see how much “charge” is left on each stage. Repair cost is based on charges used divided by total charges (fully repaired) multiplied by the max repair cost

I was one of the lucky few that did get paid back, I was lead to believe by a couple of people in the chat that private messaged me that I would get double the money if Hyphonix wins and lose it all if he loses, basically staking vicariously. I was also lead the believe this because he was asking for a loan, which according to any man with ordinary prudence means money lent with expectations of interest. 
---
He went on a 2-win streak when people in regular chat informed me that I won't receive any gains on my 1 Billion GP, once I realised that I started spam trading him and kept asking him to give me my money back, even though he realised I was doing this since my trades came up right next to the Challenges of the duelers, he went on for another stake where he lost 3B, once he came back out I continued spamming trade/in-game chat/in-game private message/Twitch chat, he ignored it for probably a couple of minutes until the Twitch chat started spamming MoneyBack or Smorc. He's a Grade A scum bag and I think a few people in his chat mislead people into believing they'll profit.
---
@op make sure to pick up rune and dragon items too!
---
Assuming it's normal update time, so 10:30 utc
---
If you don't want to get crashed at kraken buy an instance.
---
I just find it so humorous that this is in the Achievement category.
---
"I've played long enough to feel more entitled to free things and should be put above other players for doing so"
---
Single or small packet losses might cause it to jitter or pause while the connection is not stable. If there's larger regions of packets lost (4+) it might pop up the message that the connection to the server is lost as the connection threshold has been reached.
---
I used to have bad packet loss with a older router where I would get disconnection messages from League of Legends all the time, and it was because of sequences of lost packets.
---
I mean, good on you. But what’s next, posting pics of hitting level 2 cooking on turtorial island?
---
word, thanks, i really wanna hop in when it starts :D, my fishing alt will be a good acc to finally actually bond up
---
If ur crashing anyone, ironman or not at anything but like bandos, you're an absolute cunt. Just sayin
---
What cape?  And if 600k is nothing then why doesnt he buy his own?
---
Was unaware of this ^ but even still, I believe the scenario I presented (or similar) to be the case.
---
Hell yeah bro keep grinding
---
batches of 14?
---
It’s still encrypted in the program. That’s how it submits those passwords to the site your viewing. That’s literally how forms work mate.
---
Bowstring bots likely. Bowstrings have raised in price recently. I have seen tons at the Lumbridge castle second floor spinning wheel. My guess is that they spin a specific amount of flax into strings, then run to the G.E. to sell them and trade off the money as fast as they can so they aren't banned.
---
Cause its a fucking banger of a tune, do you not have ears?
---
I saw 2.5m logs in a store a couple weeks ago thought it was nuts but maybe there was something I was unaware of.
---
correct... but most runescapers cant go 25 mins away from playing. probably dont like it very much if you only play 12 1/2 mins a month. first time i played i killed cows for 2 days straight no sleep only reason i stoped was the school called my mom told her i hadn't showed up.
---
you have 85 mage you looze
---
seriously? I was always facing the dilemma of prioritizing drops
---
Imagine using OSBuddy in 2019 lmao
---
Lmao with those details your account is mine now see ya chump
---
the only thing that's calculated relative to other players is your placement which does nothing but let you access exclusive worlds for the next league

how many points you get has absolutely nothing to do with any other player (well, except doing raids i guess)

I am a proud level 11 cook

F2P and I am enjoying the game very much thank you for asking
---
Some people who bring a lot of "risk" to kraken don't use the instance because in situations where they aren't watching and die, that way they don't lose valuable items that aren't kept on death. Now I'm not saying that's justification for crashing someone, but it's the reason people do it. As an ironman myself I just use the instance and don't bring anything I don't want to lose because I know I'll eventually die there lol.
---
without paying your wilderness tax
---
I mean yeah that's what I did since it was on mobile
---
Mexicans ? 😂
---
I was more joking about the back to back drops
---
Grats! Keep up the gains!
---
He deleted the post... I wonder if he was rwt. It seems like he was. “Merching is so ez”
---
Well yeah, I guess it's more accurate to say the animation was "assigned" to the Barbtail Harpoon and they didn't bother changing it because who is going to actually use a harpoon to attack?
---
Oh I already watch them alongside settled. I’m really excited for turtletale since he’s so close to starting Song of the Elves.
---
Lol ok
---
Yeah and then do Nightmares of Ashihama whenever that releases
---
#23 was a month ago because he spent a month grinding hunter and lucky imp scouting.

wouldn’t really call that “balls” so much as “bad decision making skills”

Ohhhhh ... Yea you're right, I always just thought that was a typo. I've never seen someone use the word "provably" so it just didn't look right. They should've just said "verifiably fair" or phrased it differently lol
---
Repair costs are intimidating to start working with.
---
why as an ironman?

You think swampytoad would say something as asinine as “just upload faster”? He knows these episode are packed with hundreds of hours of content. No need to be the white knight here when we all patiently wait the each next episode.

And then Jagex learns the wrong lesson and releases deliberately terrible content so they can swoop in the the ez "fix".

I didn't touch that part. All I said was some of the employees get payed badly, and I think that some of them it's because they are payed to play the game. It doesn't speak for the dev team, or most of jagex.

Then your answer is obvious.

Also been playing around the same amount of time, was banned once, ban was quashed after lots of @ing jmods on twitter
---
Oh yeah, because Jagex has never ever screwed up anything and their detection system is 100% completely flawless! We even have proof from Jagex themselves! We’re not allowed to see it, but we 100% trust them, and if we don’t we’re drama queens.

Good luck mate! I submitted a recovery for hijacked accounts and got denied despite giving them exact transaction ID last for membership, dates, past emails etc. I had to give up because every appeal was denied and jagex has no human contact to further appeal to which sucks. I basically feel cheated out of my time and money spent (membership).

Hey bro L0st Dynasty cc I’m one of the owners! Medium sized clan all high leveled at the moment but we are looking for everyone who wants to just be part of a fun group who wants to make each other better so one day we can have a stronger clan. We do everything content wise you can think of and there’s always people to hang out with even if it’s just shooting shit in the cc. We have a structured ranking system and discord, but we also under stand irl stuff happens, so we aren’t strict like many clans are, we are looking to build a family like environment because we all like the game together more than anything. Hope this answers questions you have. Lmk bro!

You're either lying or doing the wrong bosses lol
---
I can’t imagine this is all we can do? There has to be something. I’ve dedicated a good portion of my life to this game. I grew up on it. Honestly I came back to it when OSRS was released I take breaks but somehow I always come back but the time put into the accounts is insane. I’m sorry about yours also I really hope someone fixes this I’m scared my main will be affected to since I was trading back and fourth I’m hoping to fix it before it gets to that point.
---
Runescape is 13+
---
I'm so surprised by that.
---
Especially when one of the most significant aspects of his grind is getting combats up which is relatively AFK.
---
Zeah to me is like any other part of area not connected to the main land (lost city, entrana, fossil island etc)  
---
I don't label it omgwtfbbq this is not part of the main area in runescape. You are thinking too much.
---
D
---
Ive literally tried everything, researched every way to contact them i feel so desperate lol :'(

The only interesting part is that the gold has irl value.

Lmao, it's like a doppelgänger or some shit

Just play HCIM, if you die you die... And you're a regular ironman :)

But you can't loot it.
---
Mates at bottom walking together not holding hands though bc no homo

Should put that in the main post. I think this could be the fact that separates you from everyone else with staking alts that dont get banned
---
fuck off why should we believe you heres a downvote
---
Didn't have max melee, made most of my money pre-nerf Zulrah and day of release content.
---
It was Hyphonix in my case.
---
It's an escape from reality, it lets me relax after work while still earning that achievement feeling when you get something in the game. You meet many  people that can become your friends aswell.  (Even tho many of the ones I made dont play anymore.) Another main thing is games these days are just stupid, you're paying 60 bucks for a game that maybe has like 50-100 hours worth of content to enjoy and then you're done with it. I have played both pre-eoc and osrs for thousands of hours imagine having to pay that to these new games.. Occasionally I'll buy one but I'd rather not when I can have the same fun for a longer time in a cheaper game.

@ShapecutterNey you have more math to do.

Farming is very simple once you understand it, basically you just teleport to the farm patches and plant stuff then once it's all grown you teleport back and replant. So all you need to learn really is where the patches are and the best ways to get to them quickly. You'll be farming a lot of herbs on ironman  for potions and you can also plant any tree seeds you get for good xp. Herbs take 80mins to grow.
---
its big brain time
---
Sorry guys but its my turn next.
---
Pleasr lord Jagex 0lease
---
wow thats crazy, how long did 2k+ clues take?
---
Longer than that... your assessment so far in the post and the comments is excellent, except one key detail... you are talking about *smelting* mith... After it is smelted (or bought, if you want to do that math), then Will Smith will smith mith.
---
They never provide proof of anything unless the proof revolves specifically around chat (language or scamming etc).  They don't want rulebreakers who are breaking the rules for profit (bugs, rwt, botting) to learn what gets them caught.
---
Does teleother work on ironmen?
---
Will Smith is currently hoarding all the mith.
---
Or someone donated me intentionally throwing a fight, even if they didnt RWT the gold it might appear to be a RWT.  Something like ddsing someone with only tent who gives you a hit too.
---
Commission Staking has been against the rules for some time. If you’re just handing someone (even a streamer) a billion gp with little knowledge of how the duel arena works, you should be happy you got paid back right away.

so that the main world wouldnt be a UK ping world, like how they rotate BH worlds. only issue is nobody knew it was coming and nobody knew which world to go to lol

If I use Gmail primarily, and have used it for over 10 years without an issue... why would I all of a sudden be scared for my account when some random person claims (without any verifiable proof) they've been banned from the platform?

What makes you think he didn't? He had it untill his phone broke and he had to transfer it to another phone. The moment he did that they got him.

Inb4 "those are my alts, no need to report them"

For the time invested are they really worth it though?

The same applies to any osrs stream except pvp...osrs is boring content besides chuking huge amount of golds or pking.
---
Already exists. High alchemy.
---
-&gt;play the minigame
---
I'm sure if all the people who require multiple rune pouches (i.e. anyone that brids) started ragging you at edge for points you'd have a different opinion
---
Yes
---
Ancestral comes first since it has a magic strength bonus that no other mage armor has. Depending on your str level, bandos should be last, since it usually does not add a max hit over torso+obby legs. Arma and Bandos are pretty much cosmetic upgrades and come far later than Ancestral.
---
Gf
---
Lol I thought the exact same. 10b DAILY...sounds pretty fishy.
---
Zeah was an amazing update and I hope there will be more similar updates to come.
---
Use stretched mode in runelite to increase UI size (as well as the chest, hitpoint bar, hit splats and menus)
---
Cml works great. Just take the time to figure it all out. It’s kinda complicated at first but pretty simple at its core.
---
If you're a staker you might aswell not play the game. Scum
---
It is possible
---

Id rather spend a few minutes looking for a normal room and use my BIS, than paying and risking stuff.
---
Sorry, doing cox has taught me to ignore pink text
---
Ive been trying but its not always 1.2.3 and get the drop. Besides, i risk more than just boots with my BIS
---
You think crashing someone and encouraging someone to commit suicide is on the same level of bad? Also the funny part is that the ironman is being a massive hypocrite, pretending he cares about the rules in the same breath as he wishes death on another player.
---
Lul
---
Upvoted, hope to see a smackdown soon!
---
Good. I mean you got a draconic visage.
---
Good job. I wouldn’t want to smell your chair I’ll tell you that much.
---
Over 3k without the Jar, I'd be pissed too. Best of luck there!
---
(This)[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dvdfbb/the_jagex_customer_support_experience/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link] is relevant.
---
But why is crashing bad if the option to not be crashed has been ignored by the person who would be impacted by it?  And why would the crasher buy an instance?  Sounds like the ironmeme in this situation is helping him kill kraken, giving him more gp and xp/hour so the more efficient option?
---
Pvp cant be fun by nature until they bring in an elo system
---
There’s the profanity filter than can block/show most everything but there are still some situations where the chat will still censor it but I don’t know what causes it, perhaps sites and such, but using bad language in general is fine, such as saying something is ass but using bad language at another player is possible to get you a ban/suspension
---
*That* guy. You know that guy?
---
You're being that guy.
---
F
---
Okay
---
I would recommend doing vampire Slayer, it's a pretty fun quest and helps level you up a good bit. Just Google the walkthrough if you get stuck
---
Yeah my main priority is to get P2P because it is so much easier to level and make money.
---
Customisable in what way?
---
Your lack of combo runes disgust me
---
If you're afking you're wasting even more time because of overhealing. But you do what you want, just don't claim it's better than banking.
---
I will! :)
---
The crasher would likely not want to be crashed himself (never met anyone who likes being crashed) so he shouldn't do that to other people. Seeing an Ironman and thinking "free world" is just a dick move.
---
i was meant to link an image but uhh didn't happen
---
FeelsGoodMan
---
For example if i want to focus on learning vasa, i can enter a raid and vasa is the only room in that raid until i leave. And you can do this with any boss, including olm.
---
The community has come full circle in that they support the posts initially but usually only because they want to see the jmod smackdown and complain about lack of customer support.
---
"zalcanohost" cc - It's taken me at most 3 mins of waiting to find a world.
---
I usually pay an hour a day and only play every few days. I have other things to do.
---
Doctor. Fireman. Astronaut. 200m smithing.
---
One of these things is not like the others
---
Apart from vorkath (and kraken), where can dragonfire ward be used?
---
I only need to reach 40 range with cannon. I can then use range guild for free xp
---
That's cool but don't get pissed if someone enters a multicombat room and attacks the monster (assuming your an ironmeme)
---
If you want to start pking, make a brand new account and make a pure.
---
Pking at lvl 120 is different
---
Haven't tried.
---
I've heard good things about oak dice. Never used personally
---
Probably more than me 😂
---
Username checks out
---
Ideal hp lvl to start Dhing is 92. But you may begin at 91 because of the large xp gap needed (600kish so roughly 1.8m cmb xp just for 91-92 hp). Imo, you don't lose potential especially if gmauling Power surges. Other than that, use full obby woth obby sword and berserk neck and you're set on great xp for minimum effort!
---
What Anowdd said. I will ultimately pk bots in different spots in the wilderness and I do not want to gain combat levels while doing so.
---
stringing magic long is pretty profitable iirc
---
Hellpuppy?
---
😂😭😭😭😭 i miss my squirrel!
---
Hard to say man, I don't want to taint the new player experience with efficiency minded playing, and there are so many fun quests out there.  I'd say just find some quests that sound like fun.  Maybe look at doing things like priest in peril so you have access to morytania, or fishing contest to open up a shortcut to Catherby/Camelot area.  You could do digsite and the related quests to get to fossil island, I'd say focus on some of the above quests since they have lower requirements but will open the world up for exploration and then you can see from there what kind of things you want to do.
---
... what? No. According to your logic everyone not using an instance wants to be crashed... Nearly every world is taken at kraken usually, that would mean all those people want to be crashed. I don't use an instance either, that way if I afk too much/internet connection fucks me, I can just pickup my stuff.
---
Cause this dude RWTs
---
You will get more gameplay time and more efficient XP gathering irl with this QoL update, it removes some distractions.
---
Now ive had fun in many mmos in my life but nothing compares to the fun and the memories ive made from runescape pvp.
---
If you ever mouse over people in the southwest corner of the ge in any high population world they’re almost all auto alching, and who wouldn’t lol not like jagex is gonna do anything
---
(X) Doubt
---
Some very helpful quests that gives combat rewards are:
---
Waterfall quest, Tree Gnome Village, The Fight Arena and The Grand Tree.
---
The game has kept me in its world for 16 years now and for me it's the sheer variety and diversity the game has always offered. The scenarios always being different. The chance of some stupidly absurd rare mega loots that make bank but never get.
---
Also, I met a friend back in 06, he lives on the other side of the world. We still talk and chat shit most days all these years later.
---
I will still be stuck in the game, but am just sad to see effeciency scape has taken over, the countless hours of fun content in this game is unreal but never used.
---
I used a D mace on slayer just for fun, special attack max hitting and the sheer ear bashing you get just for trying to have fun.
---
Nah the scam is that they only trade you 2m worth of plat tokens. Making you think they are trading 2m plat tokens
---
Okay. Thank you so much for helping me out. I will do these quests and more after I get the membership.
---
Me too if you get it.
---
Well yeah, a lot of high end stacking on streams is just fighting alts or friends for the content. The tax in the end isn’t much for the amount of views and real money they make from the stream.
---
I asked some guy in full bandos at PC (total level 830ish) why he didnt have a fire cape yet and he went off on a tirade about how he's an investment banker in real life and knows how to work the GE and I was just jealous of his immense riches
---
like yeah maybe dude, but you're level 86 with max main gear SGS smacking portals and still rocking a fury and dragon boots
---
Nice collection my dude, hellpuppy next!
---
how is that OP? bosses like hydra, zulrah and vorkath are always instanced and free + you can collect ur shit for 100k. that sounds more balanced than losing all ur stuff and paying 25k for a room.
---
again, i rather take my BIS gear and look for a world than use welfare gear for an instance. im not the one complaining though? im glad we can all choose which we prefer
---
If you dont see it happen doesnt mean it doesnt happen though.
---
If it’s possible, maybe some sort of white sparkles within the gold? Or a gold that “pops” a bit more visually.
---
hell yeah fuck ironmen
---
I love killing kraken from the back of the cave so dumb helmies won't see my dot on the minimap and come in thinking it's a free world
---
you are really bad at goal setting lol
---
But why not just treat your iron like a main and pk on a pk account?
---
Making and maintaining a pk account that is not iron would be easier and there would be less chance of your loot being swiped from under your feet.
---
Not sure how calling out the obvious is being a bootlicker. Might wanna check up on the meaning there boss.
---
The green Dot on the construction icon was designed around your brain size.
---
damn, thats sick. gz! that spared u alotttt of pray pots hehe
---
im at 486 atm so cant rly complain yet. just happy i got prims and pegs. those are the most important to me.
---
Nice
---
I haven't even played in about 6 months now and just lurk the subreddit but this exact thing happened to me once while I was doing a random slayer task. He asked me and the guy next to me to trade the most valuable item we were wearing claiming it was worthless to him and for an amazing reward if we do. When we said no he made it out like we were missing an amazing opportunity. I thought it was a one off I hope there's not a bunch of people doing this as some idiot will trade them eventually and encourage other scammers.
---
Just his (irl) bank.
---
i mean, [it still is](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/8/85/Rune_2h_sword_equipped.png/100px-Rune_2h_sword_equipped.png)
---
my brother used to pk with a track pad... a little bit of practice and you can almost do it the same as normal
---
I had lent a small 50m and was gone for a few days. I got on and saw he was paying people back. I requested my money but go figure he said he already paid me and ignored. However some rich buddy of his paid me off because I started making some noise in cc and twitch chat. Really enjoyed him until that happened. Couldn’t imagine the 1b lend though.
---
And then gathering loot with other acc?
---
One of the better bosses for 1 def since you can just pray melee.  Not nearly as shitty as gg’s or gwd for example
---
Does anyone know how to get a bond?
---
if you are making truly massive bets 100B swings are nothing
---
There's downvoted retards like you on every single one of these posts and it's been like that for the better part of a decade. Except for the first several years they were upvoted and the people saying the ban system was dogshit were downvoted
---
Again, its very vague in memory, and I cant find a link. All I remember is a guy posted about his false ban and got Jmod Smackdowned, and naturally everyone believed the Jmod, then a few months later a different post came up proving the guy's innocents and naturally people start saying "we believed you this whole time". If anyone can corroborate this or tell me this was all in a dream, that'd be appreciated.
---
Seers village for all the time I spent fletching there
---
I, too, eagerly await the smack down
---
Right but the more sinks you add the more it'll eventually affect and about ''item/resource sinks rather than simple gold sinks'' it's pretty much the same most drops are at alch value already. Another way to fix this is by stopping drop tables like vorkath, zulrah &amp; revs and adding more bosses like GWD.
---
"Desperately self important" lmfao! That is so accurate.
---
I had my rs3 account wrongfully banned, and I got it back 2 years later. What I eventually did was go to mod ghost/weath's (don't remember which) twitter, and used a link on their page to appeal the account. Few days later, account was unbanned. 
---
Sorry I can't be of more help, but maybe try giving that a go if it's still a thing.
---
L2Click
---
You're not sure how defending this dogshit ban system in 2019 makes you a bootlicker? You have worms in your brain
---
inb4 the 10b PER DAY is getting sold from his "main"
---
Bastards
---
To make the drops interesting and to reduce the need to add more uniques
---
I don't get how this idiot gets so many views. His set-up is trash, his content is trash, he obviously has a mental disorder. This GP is getting rwtd. He's just paying the people back with irl cash he makes from stream. Ridiculous
---
Slaughter bracelets for slayer
---
Afking it’s not crazy to get rng’d out. Even if it’s like .01% chance of happening per kill, not worth the risk.
---
The main game is just a daily grind though. I only like the minigames and distractions&amp;diversions. And there is too much mtx...
---
Solve or Smackdown.
---
Betting on Smackdown since its Staking related and a RWT ban.

Let me guess, loan stake streamer?

Would it be possible to program Barbarian Assault so, that its possible to beat minigame with just 4 players and keep having 5 player requirement as player personal preference?
---
This would prevent solve the problem of players ditching mid-runs, kinda-sorta.
---
It works for him considering it's the only way to get anyone to fight him.
---
Old school bosses are already cake runs
---
Back then there were Chaotic weapons, Divine, Ancient prayer, Overloads and Summoning
---
Now imagine Nex will none of these! :D
---
By the end of the day I'll be over 250 if I play my cards right.
---
Ok
---
I feel like Jagex needs a swift kick in the ass for any real change to happen.  Like a class action lawsuit to reimburse the entire amount spent on membership for those who were wrongly banned.  Lack of customer support for such an expensive game is unbelievable.
---
Amenity tweeted out saying it looked like he was cheating, Weath confirmed that from their end it did look like he was cheating since it is apparently a bug he was using to spec.  
---
They don't just ban anyone that streamers ask them to.
---
I miss the days when I would kill cows and tan the hides. Glad to see you having a good time!
---

---
I'd be having more fun with it if I could spend my BH points on loot crates, that was really the only thing I was looking forward to. I understand why they're disabled thought, which leads to a bigger issue that's been overly discussed on reddit. 
---
My personal opinion, and from what I've seen so far through 4 days of new BH, is that hotspots are absolutely dead content other than for people emblem boosting/farming. I've fought over 100 targets and not once has a fight been in the hotspot. Maybe that's just my personal experience, but I feel like others have the same thought. 
---
I was really hoping for the PvP armor and weapons to be brought into the game as I thought it would have attracted a larger player base to PvP and would have brought a new element into the game, but that didn't hit the 75% mark... Same story, different day lol. Just my opinions though, thoughts?
---
Yep. It's great to not only level attack but also turn some profit.
---
Stop sipping dum dum juice
---
Ah so it's still soloable? I was just wondering if they made any changes to ice phase to prevent people from soloing since then. Guess not.
---
LMAO 10b a day. Inb4 smackdown.
---
Oh ye I literally forgot the hardest room lol, blame my 3 am brain

If you know anything about oda you’d know it’s actually possibly for him to pay this off risk fighting, however if he decides to do this it’s gonna take half a year

Just FYI people are not likely to tell you their flipping items as that's competition.

Not sure of what you mean, if you see the smackdowns around here, it's always the support responsible. Don't remember his/her name, but it ain't acorn or Gambit. I think it's weath but I'm not sure
---
I want bags and pouches to be tradeable because you shouldnt have to partake in bh yo purchase either of them imo.
---
Yeh cows are great xp and money when you start out.
---
I got the beaver after about 500 willow logs after pets were first released. I've had a "You would have" message from teaks since then too. Honestly feel bad for you, because imo it's the worst looking pet in game.

Sucks man, but you probably aren't going to get this addressed. My main has been perm muted without evidence and ability to appeal for almost 4 years. Hope you get some help but it's unlikely.

Thank you!!
---
Welcome to OSRS
---
Yea that’s why I was super happy...I have a decent stack of prayer pots now since I’ve been saving for that grind. I still need to do the ranger boots and dwh grind though. I just know I’m gonna go dry on those.

Good luck on the eternals!

Jagex seems to have stopped replying (publicly) to these types of posts. I’ve seen support posts getting 3k+ upvotes with no reply but as soon as a content creator posts something you have a  “J-Mod Reply” in the comments.
---
I remember doing this way back in the day. Younger me thought it was a good idea lol. How it actually is today I have no idea. Give it a shot and let us know :)
---
That's no good friend.
---
xp lock in pvp just like ironmen have, so people can stay low level while they pk
---
This vid was a lilsmokey
---
I don't believe bounty hunter was meant to fix the wilderness. The rework was meant to fix the mini game.
---
I figured its worth a shot
---
Yeah honestly it's a shame the game developers were bought out. The game really took a different direction after that, I feel like it's focuses more on grinding to get us buying that MTX instead of giving an enjoyable gameplay experience.
---
I do agree with you regarding servers. The less restricted servers really aren't worth it. Luckily more servers have been getting somewhat fixed over the years.
---
Not yet
---
Wow TIL thank you this is quite helpful
---
I was killing some of them earlier today on the iron and in an attempt to save on antifire pots I went with just a shield and just prayed mage. Their fire can still hurt you, I was mostly taking 1s and 2s but got hit for a few 5s. If you do decide to fight brutal dragons without an antifire potion it'd be a good idea to bring some food. 1 or 2 cheese potatoes per dragon seemed about right, the optimal amount of food probably depends on your stats/gear/kill speed.
---
This was a temporary solution until bhv2 came out.
---
Making them tradeable failed and now you can only get pouches with slayer points or by pking in bh and buying them with those points.
---
The real mvp.
---
Any word on a new account name purge?
---
What?

Way to rub it our faces man
---
False, /u/JagexAcorn responded to another person about a false mute already. They can't handle it, but they at least pointed them in the right direction.
---
Neitiznot and Jatizso aren't a hidden pun, they're named that because it's what each side yelled at the other for ages.
---
Stop spacebarring quests smdh...
---
Bones to Bolivars
---
Either I guess.
---
Trying to get pmod? They don't review bans, they just let the algorithm decide. &amp; the algorithm team is pushed to get higher numbers of banned rule breakers so if there's overrage they just deny its overrage and pat themselves on the back for increasing their numbers.
---
There is no customer support. Do not play RuneScape if you aren't OK with losing an account you put hundreds or thousands of hours into b/c of the ego of Jagex's anti-cheat team, and the greed of Jagex's management refusing to hire a support staff.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Ah, I don't use sounds so I will definitely try that. I think that's my missing link. Thank you!
---
Nah i wont be able to, Ill be stuck in this secure area for 4 more hours probably. Thanks though!
---
haven't heard anything about group Ironman in a while, is it happening?
---
Pops getting smacked down. It’s almost like you just assumed that.
---
To be honest, I’d kill Nex even if it only had a shared drop table of all the GWD generals (maybe add cosmetic orn kits/functional kits to *slightly* upgrade current gwd gear similar to the blood drain on torture in a previous poll). 
---
The fight was insanely fun to do with a group of friends.
---
yeah I know, not looking for specific items just a concept of something that works for long periods afk. Like for instance fire runes is not useful if you are looking for big margins.
---
It’s at 5.5k 
---
They still ain’t here. 
---
$11 btw
---
especially for maples because the logs are like 4gp
---
That's runescape 3.
---
91 slayer
---
&lt;40 every non-combat
---
97 quest points
---
There's niche cases where it can add a max (eg. Overloaded max str with avernic/faceguard/infernal) and it can prevent the loss of a max hit on tickdowns. . . But overall tassies are a poorly spent 30 mil and a BCP=Fighter Torso so yeah, bandos is hugely overrated.
---
Congrats, I'm on the grind as well! Will try to find you now.
---
Speaking from personal experience, grind more shards and make yourself the crystal armor set. It's hard to achieve and looks amazing. Not many people stick it out to get the set and it's max fashionscape. A pretty impressive flex, too.
---
I really enjoy a good fashionscape. The crystal set is the only one in 14 years of playing that I haven't got tired of.
---
in pvp ranged is used to stack hits and typically you fight other very defense-neglected accounts. youll see full melee gear + msb as a meta for 40 defense builds- the loss in accuracy on the msb is pretty minimal.
---
for pvm typically you see a tank shield and tank helmet because the places you pvm (kreearra, saradomin for example) you value defense a bit- brew less -&gt; do more dmg. helmets like veracs/justicar, shields like dragonfire ward/ely provide really giganitic defense bonuses.
---
Gotta be one of the worst grinds for Ironmen. Gl dude
---
we hit 5k give us some customer support https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dvnydh/any_jmod_able_to_help/f7e05n1
---
Dragon would be cool too, but maybe that's just the fashionscape slut in me talking.
---
Kril is up there with Kree.
---
The GWD bosses are pretty well balanced, only thing I'd be in favour of changing is making those 2 bosses slightly easier with some stat nerfs, because they have worse rewards than Zil and Gra while being harder to get into.
---
Nothing you said here is true, jagex could terminate his account for any reason

Brooo the same dude was doing that to me in the warriors guild with my Fury, Saying its trust game and put on a whole show with his buddy pretending to trade him goods so i get lured in. I laughed so hard, i felt touched that they out the effort in for my fury, but honestly how stupid do they believe the general Runescape community is

JAGEX THIS IS A PROBLEM WHAT THE FUCK DO SOMETHING

OSRS taught me basic ECON theories before actually studying it in university. Look up a flipping guide on youtube, maybe you'll get into it

It feels as if Joker should have it's own questline
---
Can you still continue pking them with 19hp?
---
Doesnt this already exist? Or is it just a feature in runelite!? It is available in runelite in any case!
---
If it's already easy then we should definitely not make it easier.
---
fuckin epic haha, is there a way to download it or just a gyazzo/imgur link for is pls???
---
&gt; They don't review bans, they just let the algorithm decide. &amp; the algorithm team is pushed to get higher numbers of banned rule breakers so if there's overrage they just deny its overrage and pat themselves on the back for increasing their numbers.
---
They reply to ban appeals, I've had my ban appeals looked at by humans. When i didn't like the answer I didn't go whinge on reddit about it. You have any proof its all handled by an algorithm and that overrages are involved?
---
&gt; There is no customer support. Do not play RuneScape if you aren't OK with losing an account you put hundreds or thousands of hours into b/c of the ego of Jagex's anti-cheat team, and the greed of Jagex's management refusing to hire a support staff. 
---
I mean i'd say 90% of these "jagex help please" threads are smack downs where OP either cheated, or he bought the account. The other 1% are legitimate complaints that get resolved.
---
Also, I like talking shit too much to ever be a Pmod.
---
At least now we have way more skills we can train. Remember before the revolution of industry when there was pretty much just farming, hunting and fishing? The invention skill was a huge update and I plan to max it because it's really good gp/h and some training activities are fun. It's not very afk though.

better the dude buys the gold from jagex than gold sellers.

An MMORPG without updates for new content dies.

New content dies if it doesn't have worthwhile rewards.

Everyone and their mothers in Bandos and Arma is boring.

Their needs to be more options.

It doesn't need to be power creep either, just new shit that's worth a damn.
---
T75 Melee and Range gear, with the same strength/range bonus along with some extra defence (or something along those lines) would not ruin the game in anyway.
---
You think it's funny, killing those clue hunters?

I was getting about 185k xp &amp; 300-350k gp per hour.

Offering free staking services to boost rep on a known gold selling forum. I wonder what could possibly go wrong when you stake gold for people on a forum that lets gold sellers blatantly advertise. OP only ever traded his main btw, totally not any proof in that thread of him taking money from people, staking it and turning it into bils which they then RWTed.
---
Ah so you're part of the circle jerk I was banned unfairly group got it
---
I thought I remembered hearing that they weren’t going to be redeemable on Ironman accounts but I couldn’t remember if that was right so I figured Reddit might know
---
I love how only a few of them were baller enough to afford an amulet.
---
Did u give him 50k?
---
Basically what S7efen said and the simpler reason that it gives you a huge defence bonus and only a small accuracy loss
---
Most people (even when maxed) don't crash others, even if those other people are in shit gear... You know why? Its called manners. If you crash people for whatever reason you're just a shithead. There are plenty of things irl that are considered rude/disrespectful/being a dick but aren't disallowed by law, but that doesn't make it right to do.

Yuuuup that was it. The whole Jed fiasco basically showed reddit that Jmod Smackdowns meant jack shit and were just Jagex covering their own asses if anything.
---
i think they should just comment "i've gotten in touch with you via email" if anything at all. it's between the mod team and the customer after all, hungering for "mod smackdowns" is something we should leave behind.
---
Thats not a fucking fix to anything you clown.
---
You wanna fix death mechanics get some decent fucking server protection and revert the death mechanic to what it used to be thats how you fix it.
---
I can’t imagine that being the case.

gz
---
Ah yes, because a clip pulled directly from MMK’s stream is tarnished since it’s used in an Oakdic video. 10/10 logic.
---
Venezuelans, crash them mercilessly.
---
Chinese customers? What?
---
Someone needs to dig up the dirt on his methods.
---
Spirit tree if you have the farming level for it. Mounted digsite pendant and xerics talisman are also good.
---
There's no contract mate, they own all properties of the game including your account.
---
Would it not appear after a minute? Since the Ironman will get the drop but he can’t pick it up
---
A clip taken out of context* because you're watching a shit source where is the part of MMK saying that was a meme minutes after what he initialy said?
---
Oh wait oakdice didn't put that in the video did he?
---
Keep being a retard buddy.
---
don't forget the obby cape
---
at least these people give jagex enough money to keep this game ongoing
---
99% sure smack down incoming. Who needs to trade billions daily to a staker? Someone who stakes until they lose to the person they’re RWT with
---
I never believe false bans. I hope you got a new car from all your rwt. Time to make a new account or you know get a job? Lol
---
I guess jmod smackdown is pay per-view now
---
Forgive the copy paste of an answer I gave someone else, heading to work soon so I don't have tons of time.
---
 Keeping  the first part of the story short since it's not relevant to how I lost  it, but I got to a 2.7b bank from 300m through a few weeks of lucky  staking. At 2.7b I decided I'd just stop and not stake anymore. Went  pking for fun, got skull tricked for claws with the classic. Guy asked  me to fight him, and he looked pretty bad (and so am I) so I said sure.  He chose the high risk PvP world to fight, and I thought nothing of it  since I could just not skull. Of course it was the oldest trick in the  book, where the team logged underneath me while I was looting, and got  me to skull up. I had no chance of tanking from level 4 wildy to the  bank, and lost my claws. (To Frontline I think.)
---
I  decided I'd sell my tbow to go stake the claws back, what could go  wrong right? Sold tbow for 984m at the time, teled to duel arena. Got  tbed because I forgot I was still on a PvP world, immediately tried to  hop. At the time (for OSBuddy atleast - and no I don't use it anymore)  trying to hop using the client in combat would x log you instead. When I  logged back in, I was in edgy with my tent whip and 2gp, without even  knowing who killed me - just that he'd been wearing salad robes and a  fire staff. I proceeded to rage stake the remainder of my bank, and get  cleaned - went ironman after that and never looked back.
---
As  a bonus, I happened to actually meet the guy who killed me earlier this  year (around two years after it all happened). We were chatting and he  mentioned killing a guy for 984m in the duel arena, and I couldn't  believe it. As it turns out, because I had mentioned going to stake the  claws back edgy bank after I'd died, the guy had been waiting for me at  the arena hoping I'd show up.
---
no theyre not you can get an instance lool, if someone doesnt have one, just get one yourself, dont be a prick... 
---
i would seriously hop until i find an empty world, or a world where i wont ruin someone elses fun for "good experience rates" (lol) or any other reason
---
It's based on context if something is worth using or not. It does not mean that it would be meta, that's very different. You don't need the meta setup for everything to be worth it, especially if the meta is out of reach in an individual's context.
---
hi, me
---
Yes but we pay our own money for a service. Therefore, even if there is no contract, consumer rights laws surely apply?
---
I mean Odablock stakes bills on the daily and doesn't RWT, it's not that uncommon for rich folks.
---
It's about getting into a routine, and everyone's runs are different based on what they're growing. For example, I'm at a level where I can pretty much hit every major patch in the overworld, so I traced a path to get all around the world using whatever free teleports I have (fairy rings, gnome gliders, etc) and hit each patch with stops at banks to load up on seeds &amp; payment for the next leg of the trip.
---
If you stock up on seeds ahead of time, you can just make it part of your daily routine. I hit all my patches in around 40-45 minutes and then go back to doing whatever else I'm into that day.
---
Agreed 100%
---
Ok, but that's never going to happen so there's no point in even thinking about it. The amount of scamming that would create eliminates it as a possibility.

"Your brain dead" please read this again

I tweeted mod husky about this, if you want the cosmetics on an iron man you have to play in twisted league on your ironman account
---
Nexon did this before with old Maplestory.  When they first added Bigfoot they screwed it up and people were abusing an insta kill glitch.  Anyone who touched Bigfoot during that time and were attempting to kill the boss legit were also perma banned

Q Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
You can buy max bank for around 4b. That means you have 6b (+-3b) of staking money. Having that amount of money long term is unsustainable with the duel arena and like you said you have been staking heavily. The fact that you choose to trade over the entirety of the 10b (+-3b) daily between accounts seems unlikely, even dumb people would realise that would get your account flagged.
---
More than likely you use your alt for RWT, being able to keep your cash stack seemingly constant means you stake RWT, you "sell" gp by "losing" a stake and "buy" gp by "winning" a stake. Trading the wealth between accounts daily was probably you hoping to muddy the trail with a large amount of trades in your trade history. Eventually jagex gets you and you are hoping to temp unbanned to panic sell all your gp before they ban you again.
---
Decent plan, I'll keep an eye out for the smackdown.

It does have to do with Twitch prime. They are on LMS competitive world which is members and you need members to claim the rewards. 50 points will gain you 700-900k from 1 Trouver Parchment. All they do is suicide and gain 1-3 points per game. So do the math, the bot owner is making soo much money from this.
---
Jagex customer support is advancing to the next tier: They don't even respond to customer support threads, they crowdsource the customer support
---
It's very likely the "&amp;" symbol wasn't escaped in the message, causing it to be cut off.
---
Most players don't actually die with their pets, so it doesn't work as a gold sink unless there's an upfront fee.

reddit customer support has been activated

Hell yeah bruther!

Lmao. Dudes name of reddit is the same as the one on the forums. GG.

There's an achievement in the easy Ardougne diary to talk to the NPC to check what pets you have insured.

Even better plan, go to Diango in Draynor village and buy an Event RPG from him. It's the best weapon until the adamant scimitar at 30 attack. You won't hit as hard but you'll hit faster and the speed makes up the difference

He's just sufficiently leveraged for his Personal Risk Tolerance.

Afk some fishing or woodcutting or mining, and sell everything you get and you should be able to buy some more armor, black isn’t all that expensive I believe.

I forgot to mention he passed away in January of last year, and I was banned shortly thereafter.

Just take it and quit, the support on this game is bull shit.
---
Use your new gained free time and start a hobby.
---
Imagine pretending to be innocent, getting the community to help you get Jagex's attention while also being part of a gold selling website/forum.
---
I hope your account remains locked, OP.
---
I know cook’s assistant is tough buddy, I’ll show you where the mill is
---
Hell im lvl 89 on my first account since I quit as a teenager. Still rocking my obby cape and rune plate. Just can’t force myself to do the quests..
---
One thing I've noticed while playing the new bounty hunter mini game is kids will go to their bank to pull out a tier 5 emblem to skip me when i have a t4 emblem in my inventory. Can there possibly be a minimum amout of time a player has to have an emblem in their inventory for their skip to be penalty free (longer than 2 minutes at least)? Right now people are avoiding losing their kill streak by taking out higher tier emblems from the bank to skip targets they don't want to fight.  
---
Also I've been pking for the last 3 days for at least a few hours a day after work each day and i've yet to get a target that has a t4 emblem risk.. I really think the way tiers get upgrades needs to be looked at. my account is a lvl 70 combat pure. 
---
Also these same kids that i got as targets initally weren't even risking tier 1s.. So i think If crates come back they shouldnt have t5s on the roll table. People are just using them for free skips at this point. It's really frustrating.
---
at 00:45 when i blew the cade and skutt dropped the flag for me to take, the saradomin guy seem'd to teleport forwards which was weird and i only noticed when re-watching the clip

don't I then need another PC online to remote to?

It's funny. They add an ingame message encouraging people to take breaks from excessive play time then implement a gamemode that encourages unhealthy gameplay time tasks. I get that everything is not suppose to be achievable but c'mon.
---
not bad at all bud 😊
---
He's you but better.
---
Gl, King
---
Sorry I don't understand that. Basically what I think is that if a big amount of players did the same thing and staked small amounts many times (lets say 1000 players start at 1m and do 1000 stakes of 1m, they are allowed to get into negative values), then there are lucky and unlucky players. Ending up with 1m is average. People that end up with an amount &gt; 1m can be considered lucky, people with an amount &lt; 1m can be considered unlucky. Someone who ends up with -9999m would be considered the most unlucky case.
---
Take my upvote, dammit.
---
I used to love pking so much back then. Pure set, 2 pray pots, a dds and the rest were sharks. No combo food, no ridiculous switches, just a good old fight.
---
Twisted leagues are like Deadman. They're an isolated progression where everyone starts on an even playing field and it's down to the individual player's knowledge to progress.
---
Yooooooooooo
---
Lol
---
Ok I'm dead
---
This is why I am totally against PvP minigames or systems that GENERATE wealth from nothing.
---
When you have both sides being players instead of one being an NPC there are always going to be people exploiting it.
---
The problem Jagex should be solving is, how to get PVP'ers (not PvM'ers) to take more than 20k risk into a fight.
---
Artificially adding shit like emblems/crates in BH is just asking for trouble.
---
Fuuuuck that’s some juicy dark humor
---
I know this may sound dumb but did you find the amulet and talk to the archeologist person? If you did, they take it away and teach you how to enchant a ruby amulet (or necklace cant remember which) to make the dig site pendant.
---
lol
---
Sounds like you're just having a bad time with it to be honest, you're definitely not doing anything wrong, seems like the museum is just bumming you :/
---
Lose my foot up yo ass if you dont gtfoh
---
Twitch prime requires an amazon account with prime (which has it's own pretty strict restrictions regarding free trial) and it actually has to be LINKED to a single account so you can't just nab codes from someone else. 
---
So I really don't think this twitch prime being OP for bots narrative holds much weight.
---
100 Mimic kills? Yeah let me casually acquire 1500 Master clues
---
It’s almost like they had similar issues in 2009 and had to increase risk to qualify for loot and have it scale with combat too.
---
The pre eoc version was not perfect by any means, but man it’s a baseline that was good and with a few tweaks could really be good.
---
And yet people believe every single sob story because they want it to be true.
---
Do you people have no limits?
---
I read they're trade-able and Twisted League will occur more than once, so no.
---
You buy a bond with irl money then you drop the gp on the ground thats the cost of the bond if you think its cheating or a big deal or whatever.
---
8 spears lol. Imagine this kick back in the day, you would have been the king
---
Have you spoken to Oziach?
---
No Jagex response yet, but there is a community smackdown near the top. Someone found his RWTing forum account. Brainlet used the same username, lmao. Let's get his main banned now.
---
Make Infernal cape as good as hosidius kitchen
---
98% chance the OP doesn't respond to you.
---
Same thing should apply for the crasher then, doesn't it?
---
I'm so glad I revisited this sub. You're a legend.
---
You'll be able to buy them with points from subsequent leagues
---
What is twisted league
---
You gotta slap ass
---
And look 7300 upvotes of retards instantly believing someone.
---
There has been maybe 2 or 3 actual innocent people in all history of /r/2007scape 
---
Yet every thread people pretend like there have only ever been 2 or 3 legitimate bans.
---
People just fall for every OP's bullshit story that always leaves something out because they want it to be true, not because it actually is.
---
Wtf
---
False, one food is regularly the difference between stretching for one extra Vorkath kill or not. If I have 3 or 4 mantas, I'll go for another kill, but not with 2 food. Every single inventory space matters.
---
To an extent, yes. You should be able to try. There should be an escape, so it is balanced. It should not be free safety.
---
Unless you got killed by a player you can just go back and pick the items up
---
Garbage.
---
I don’t know what botmakers are doing, but there’s an awful lot of correlation between the time free trial is out and lms is infested with bots.
---
How is "looks like your eating booty" a con?
---
False, if you are good at vorkath you do not need to worry about that.
---
Those are pros, you are confused.
---
Tried, it is all gone
---
You're going to take inevitable damage from Vorkath regardless of your method or gear. I can get lucky and not need to eat for a whole kill, or I could get spammed with magic attacks and need 3-4 eats.
---
How long ago did you die
---
I agree that the Pre-eoc version was far from perfect, but it had some right ideas. I'm hoping for BH to be an active minigame which players want to partake in, without bots ruining it for everyone.
---
Unfortunately gold trading is inevitable in any game with trading. Bonds at least give some stability and combat 3rd party sales which are the real problem with botting.
---
Nah man this is really sad :(
---
Support only if I can toggle my own cape into an apron and cook on myself
---
As a mid lvl btw that did 1k kills I think the time is ok, just enough to re-pot, eat and pick up loot. Imo high lvl players should just hop, like in many other bosses.
---
when jagex move to pms it's likley jagex made a boo boo
---
I’m sorry yalls gotta waste your time with this but thank you for issuing a good ol smackdown.
---
I tried straight after I died
---
Short selling is an investment or trading strategy that speculates on the decline in a stock or other securities price.
---
Hope he doesn’t, proof of real world trading has been found on RWT forum to stake for other people.
---
He’s sad he lost his account but didn’t think of the consequences for participating in bannable actions.
---
my guy you slipped up in your lie. it's all over lmao.
---
Who hurt you?

this is what the normie virgins of this game look like. take almost 10 years to get a 99 and still have no clue how to play the game

You can get bone drops from dragon implings, hydras, alchemical hydra.
---
Presumably the relic works like bonecrusher and won't grind secondary bone drops, so taking it means putting temple key completion off for later
---

---
Hydra can drop noted bones.
---
you can do that??
---
Just spitballing. Thanks for the feedback :)
---
Got em
---
It's a 1-in-8 chance of getting a piece per game, and games take a little over ten minutes. Just assuming that you need 4\*8 games played at ten minutes each that's 320 minutes, or roughly five and a half hours. That would *probably* get you all four pieces. 
---
OP managed to get it in less than an hour, but it'd be possible to go really dry on pieces. 
---
I don't like the minigame but I've been gritting my teeth and doing it occasionally, just in preparation for that piece of shit Sherlock telling me to show up with a full set.
---
i went there but thought it wouldnt work
---
Would buying them there work?
---
Thanks for the quick and clear responses to all of the questions in this thread!
---
Stop wasting our and jmods time you shitbag.
---
u/Mrjmfs please my dude
---
this is an ironman league, no GE
---
Yes, I'm familiar with this line of thinking, I'm just saying that I think there's something unexplainable that makes it wrong.
---
i wish ironmen could crash the same was as mains. mains lose half their slayer xp from kill no matter what and they get no drops on the floor just like the ironman. thats what these cringy ass 300lb mains dont understand about chadman mode. 300lb virgins need mommies credit card to buy more bonds so he can afford to pay for arrows for his tbow since he cant make money at all besides mommies credit card
---
Theoretically, sure. But there’s no iron-clad way to guarantee payout if it Plummer’s.
---
if his ban appeal got instantly denied because his account got flagged for blatantly obvious rwt, then their customer support worked just fine and there was no customer service lottery to begin with.
---
But it's also possible that the reason it was denied is because Jagex support sucks and because fuck you. So, you know, it could really go either way on this one
---
H
---
Hold my cashstack, I'm going in
---
The lurers have evolved, now using Ironman accounts wow. These are sad people, it's a shame we can't get them punished for it from Jagex.
---
Show your RC xp and the lack of pet in your collection log at the same time please
---
What do they show at 33 seconds then?

I am responding to this guy who thinks you would have a case when you never would. It doesn't matter what you spent on your account.

Hard clues for dhide / msb. Steel dragons drop rune limbs, so you can craft an rcb. Then you can buy unf broad bolts / broad arrows at konar, or you can craft your own ruby / diamond bolts.

For the low ranged lvls you'll just have to train with whatever you can find quickly.

That’s what I’m wanting to know lol
---
Avg people on lms world has gone up +700 since twitch prime came up. Assuming only 500 of these are bots making 700k per hour each is 350,000,000 gp per hr. One six hour run with 500 bots would be 2,100,000,000 gp gained in 6 hours so every six hours at .55c usd per 1m gp that's $1,155 u.s. dollars per six hours, or $4620 every 24hrs. If run efficiently for the 14 days of free membership in 14 days with 500 lms bots running 24/7 you could make in theory $64,680 in 14 days. In one year you of 500 bots running 24 hrs efficiency that's $1,681,680 USD per year for just running a LMS bot farm and selling at .55c USD per 1m OSRS GP.
---
Tbh
---
Did NOT see that coming lmfao
---
my rsn is  "thc nature". also join in my clan chat "lietuviai" and ask in here
---
Yeah it works!
---
Sure thing!
---
Honestly, likely unlimited run, the rune saver seems powerful but I value the convenience of being able to run all the time, especaially for CoX
---
Have the point milestones to unlock new relics been announced?
---
This escalated
---
Classic wow is pretty community driven, but it's also really sweaty. I've barely seen my friend these last months. He has played 1000 hours soon. It's just crazy. Leveling up is a fun process, but 40 man raids is just dumb imo. The raids are so fucking easy, the only hard part is managing 40 socially awkward people and getting them to do their honestly simple job. Pvp is laughably unbalanced due to class design and engineering, so once again not my cup of tea.
---
Community and leveling 10/10, raiding 4/10, pvp 2/10!
---
Lots of fletching
---
Interesting that base 90s gives 250 pts but base 80s will give (100 \* 23) + 250 = 2550 pts. That feels a little unbalanced to me, makes me not want to go further than base 80s because of the drop off in points.
---
Bullshitt, someone posted this like 3 hours ago. Nice try tho
---
Kindly tell them to stop saving the bots
---
Go fuck yourself, king  
---
Some negativity, balanced as all things should be.
---
I think they just want to make sure than anything anyone could possibly do has a reward, not matter how unlikely they are to actually do it.
---
It's fucking assholes like this guy that make Jmods reluctant to even reply to all the "Hurr Durr falsely banned dindu nuffin" threads on here. Because for every 1 person that is actually unfairly banned, there's hundred of these cunts that *know* they broke the rules, but think they can hide the truth from Jagex. I mean seriously...how fucking smooth brain do you have to be to put a giant reddit spotlight on yourself, lie through your teeth, then play a victim when you already know you're full of shit and Jagex can easily tell with a few mouse clicks?
---
&gt;when your best gear is a whip(no defender), no -def weapon, an RCB/msb for range, and wave spells. 
---
You can get dwh for -def and at least dragon Hunter lance is available.  But still I agree
---
Yeah but like I don't get much for runes either so idk what I'm doing wrong, I kill them all, all the mobs for the rest of the bonus and I get 30k if I'm lucky and that barely profits after cost of tele tabs and ammo charges
---
I know this I was just making a joke homie haha
---
It doesn't matter if they're caught. This is a short term thing written by an amateur to take advantage of the Twitch Prime thing. If the accounts get banned a new one will be made and will replace it in minutes. They can try to IP ban them, but if they're running this many accounts, they're on a virtual machine. There's nothing they can do about this right now.
---
Jesus Christ, Marie
---
Nope, you can log in with the same credentials on both platforms.
---
You shouldn't have to. Unless you have an authenticator, then that's all you'll need to log into the game on desktop.
---
lmap, get wrecked
---
Nah till January
---
I really dont understand the backlash. A balloon in the house would not be that bad at the right price. I'd say make it like 1-2m and in a superior garden.

I believe it’s Oziris who has an Ironman guide, I’d give that a look over. There’s also an optimal quest list on the wiki. That should be able to help get you started and moving in the right direction. Good luck! Welcome back :)
---
If you're a member waterfall quest will give you a ton of attack and strength xp, enough to get lvl 30 in each from lvl 1
---
Hes got a well polished prefrontal cortex thats for sure, dude literally left his forum account up after making this thread thinking nothing would come of it. 
---
And yeah, thats why I hate the jagex support is trash circle jerk, like 9 in 10 of these threads is OP was a RWTer, Purchased the account or no reply. I think i've seen 1 thread in the past year where jagex actually apologized / was proven wrong.
---
Hmmmmmm I haven’t tried that

I will still take the remainder of your bank, if you don't mind. So very nice of you to offer me the rest of your bank! I'll meet you asap to take your bank, you're too kind!
---
Tysm for the task list and guide so far!
---
I'm actually having a lot of fun planning out what tasks I'm going to aim for since I am a casual player, I wouldn't be able to do many of the tasks. Hopefully doing most of the Easy and Med tier of tasks would net me enough pts for the cosmetics I wanted.
---
Fire making, I'm at level 87 now. Working towards my Phoenix
---
well i think if we keep at it we will get all the coats. this guy is taking all the ranger boots so thats good. who would want those peter pan looking shits
---
the later relics must be really strong to warrant such fast cox times. 
---
current wr solo cox is 15:24, and the highest tier task requires a sub 12 using *only zeah gear*, meaning that without tob items/etc. we have to beat current wr by 3.5 mins
---
similar with solo cm times
---
Posts like this make me want to fukin kills omeone
---
From the video that showed names and pictures for the relics it would seem so.
---
How bad were you shaking?

Are you implying there is a point to do it to irons?

Just use Iasor or Attis when you are focusing on herb run and limps. I only use Kronos when I need to camp hespori or I camping farming contracts.

Please don't. He's the only one left who speaks like a normal human being.
---
Have you ever had a bad experience with customer support? Doubt it
---
Well it's not unlimited
---
just wait until the league has been over for a month and it will stabilize
---
I like the Memes watermark the most.
---
It's an 80% chance to save, not unlimited
---
Because the vast majority of the community hates the idea of discontinued items. It's not ridiculous at all to listen to the players.
---
Sure you can afk for some points, but we have no idea how much points the highest tier rewards are going to require. I highly doubt even if you just afk wc,fish,?idk what else even will you have enough points to even make farming it worthwhile. You'd likely be better off making alts and just actually farming something in the game, not in the league.
---
They've stated if you're a casual player and arent able to unlock all the rewards you will be able to participate in upcoming leagues and purchase rewards from this league, that makes me believe that unlocking ALL the rewards will require a fair bit of work, other than just afking 2 skills for 2 months to make 10m for a cosmetic. If it's even worth that much.
---
Thats suoer cool dude great job!

Oooh, I noticed I didn't exactly phrase my question right. I don't care if the email address gets notified, since it's unused for as far as I know. My issue is that I need some way to be notified that my appeal was succesful, so I can set a new email.
---
Fixing account security,
---
Allocating resources to actually fixing the PvP scene.
---
Finishing quest series.
---
Updating polling systems specifically related to pvp.
---
Fixing drop tables.
---
Incentivizing people to actually skill again (this is intertwined with fixing drop tables)
---
Dedicate more time to getting rid of bots especially bot farms at places like zulrah and vorkath
---
Significantly updating their own vanilla client and banning 3pc this would significantly help with bot detection 
---
Fixing LMS and the massive bot farms there.
---
Overall caring about the game instead of bandaid fixing everything.
---
You unlock relics at certain score, but you don't "spend" the score on them.

glad to help, /u/FartOnMyCunt :)

No response, but [OP replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dvnydh/any_jmod_able_to_help/f7f0suk/). Apparently he's in talks with JMODs but the proof against him seems very undisputable.
---
I DONT SEE YOU WHERE ARE YOU
---
I don't know what to expect. I still don't understand why I would quit my main for 2 months to level another account which resets every season for cosmetics. Like it's basically grinding out a nicer looking graceful set, nicer slayer helm, for 2 months. Maybe I have the wrong idea.
---
W0w
---
Oofff
---
It would also be nice with a new actual mini game to OSRS too, not just the weird game modes
---
Dont play ironman lol
---
Are there actually any places where that would be worthwhile over void? I can't think of anywhere that you need to brid where inventory space is also at a high premium AND you need good defense.
---
Cant ask jagex to fix your friends lack of knowledge. its a high risk world which means if he is not there to pk then he shouldnt be there. everyone knows that you dont take anything to the wild that you are not willing to loose. On mistake or not.

Jagex will send you an email if it was successful or not. It can take seconds or days. Don't forget to check your junk folder.

Oh lol I don't do much diary's

Minimum 5k up votes for ban appeals
---
You probably know exactly what you said. They tend to be lenient on main accounts and will warn you before you get perm muted. Unless you do something so outrageous that deserves an instant perm mute
---
Not really necessary for the super serious players because they'll just 1t everything. 
---
It's the most casual seeming option because technically it's pretty useless past 43. But it all depends on what the higher tier of each relic gives.
---
Yes please.
---
Give me a spin off of fist of guthix, soul wars. Or something
---
If even love the old rc minigame if it gave some experience and the robes
---
Well keep in mind it's 5x multiplier (+2.5% farm outfit multiplier). So every normal 1 xp is actually 5.125 xp, meaning that 200m xp is actually about 39m "real" xp. Since tithe farm exists, yes, it's definitely possible because if you *really* wanted you could just spam tithe farm all day for xp. As for trying to get it "naturally" just growing stuff and not spamming tithe farm, that I'm less sure of.
---
As someone that has used it multiple times, those high ratings are based on issues that actually make it there. You only get the opportunity to rate the help you got once the ticket is resolved. The problem comes with bans that you can't appeal, because they insist they have an infallable system that can do no wrong. When you try to get in contact with customer support through normal means to try and discuss the ban, you will get shot down immediately under this pretense. Hence why you get posts like this on Twitter and Reddit, because people are being denied the ability to talk to an actual human being through official means.
---
We've seen many examples of their "perfect" system failing to be perfect. Just off the top of my head, there's the incident where a guy got caught up in an RWT ban because his dick head friend was doing RWT without anyone in the friend group knowing, resulting in Jagex blunderbuss banning the majority of people that traded the guy. This one got overturned after a post on Reddit. There's been cases of people playing efficient enough that they've flagged the anti-bot, and those ended up quashed, again, after directly contacting a Jmod on social media. Another recent example is that streamer that got falsely banned on stream, with the ban being lifted mere moments later.
---
Do you see the trend here? Jagex has their head up their ass on how many false-positives their systems generate, and refuse to look into them because "the system is perfect." Customer support will refuse to help you with these issues because "all bans are final." You don't even get a ticket opened to rate them.
---
Plus, even if these issues made it there and resulted in bad reviews of the system, why would Jagex show a potential consumer bad data? Of course they'll show it as a high rating. A company will tell you their product is fucking lit, not "Yea our product will give you HIV lmao."
---
Make a baby pure using mint mad cow or purpps guides on YouTube and practice brid pking in last man standing :D 
---
I too was a “bot” killer until I realised a fair few of them seem to be gold farmers with Spanish names and I think killing them is kind of a shitty thing to do
---
Yeah, that’s what I will do. I’m surprised the market has held its self this evening, considering.
---
I don't believe you can use the same payment info for 2 accounts.
---
Sorry I already gave everything out

Incase you're not very trusting of links as I am, you can manually navigate to where you need to be by visiting the RuneScape website, clicking on Support, then clicking Payment And Membership, clicking on Cancel Subscription, and on that page you should find a section there that says 'If you don't have access to your account' which has some instructions for Credit/Debit Card users and it links you to the correct place to cancel your subscription at, or if you've used PayPal to pay for your subscription they tell you to cancel directly through PayPal.

99 range last summer. Never got any back in front OG days
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
If memory serves me right, it was at the release of Godswords.... Will I research it to back up my claim? Hell no.
---
Whoooosh
---
Infernal max vape is not a realistic long term goal. That should be his end goal. And he should have long terms that will lead up to his end goal.
---
Would recommend?
---
Thank you for not being toxic. I'm almost to 250.
---
But the thing is that I don't have access to the account's email. That's my entire problem. I'm appealing about my inaccessible email, and they send the result of said appeal to the email address I don't have access to.
---
For cosmetics and for fun. It's a fresh take every 2 months with new relics, new tasks, new restrictions (this one is zeah-only, who knows what the next will be), etc. Personally, it's a lot more interesting to me than just playing my main.
---
Oh. Doesn't feel like it. Maybe best to reduce the time LOL
---
No you don’t hide your trauma using Netflix
---
I convinced my friend to "gamble" away 13m because he won several 100-500k rolls and a 2m roll.  I still laugh at him.
---
so hard
---
I like watching the number go up.
---
Fucking legend gypped his way a $50k personal loan with only $2k collateral.
---
 
---
Long live GUH
---
Dungeoneering, loved that shit.
---
I'm 114 with 1600 total and addy gloves.
---
And risk ban? Pass
---
Can you link me that? That sounds very interesting
---
What a dumb cunt. Delete every account he owns just for his stupidity.
---
i remember when that was 5m lol
---
4 favorites and boaty
---
no one likes the ginger cunt
---
Damn I’ll have to do this when I get gaming 99. Love the idea of people having to find you instead of just a drop party! Gratz dude what’s next for you skill wise?
---
This response actually made me laugh out loud.
---
r/AlKharidBets
---
I'd crap if I got a 5m drop lol
---
First back in rs2 was cooking, then on my first OSRS main I got fletching. When that account was (rightfully) banned I started up again all legit and it's looking like my first 99 will be farming! Which I'll immediately trim with FM just to trim it haha
---
You're a legit dumb cunt, glad your account was banned
---
Good enough stats to melee him.
---
Spectral would double your number of kills per trip but you can still try the boss and finish the remaining kills left on task at hellhounds.
---
1 def &amp; 1 prayer. 85 magic - 85 range - 50 attack - 75 str.
---
Get no hp levels through range or mage at all. ( cannon ) 
---
Attack and str through quests. 
---
You’ll be sick ;)
---
I'll see how fast streamers can progress, because i want to do some of the semi endgame stuff. But i cant play a lot so if ot takes them a long time then mo way i'm even starting it.
---
would range be easier? I'm 91 range
---
Know how you camp bosses for really rare drops?
---
Imagine dying to kraken being a really rare drop for him. It ain't gonna happen the vast vast majority of the time but it still can, every time.
---
Only in low detail mode.
---
Still possible with 3rd party clients
---
sick nerd is mod ash
---
Well I think it's going to be a very small % that will actually go for rank, considering thous who play a lot will be miles ahead of majority of the people. Most people will play for tradable rewards including myself. Either way I get what you mean, guess will see what happens tomorrow.
---
Also it would be nice if you could put something that uses multiple combat styles in the regular rooms.
---
How is doing Barrrows on mobile? After using a mouse for years I cant seem to get into a flow using my phone.
---
Would there be a way of coding it so that being attacked by this particular NPC has an extended world hop timer? I'm not very well-up on coding, so I have no idea whether that'd be easy to implement or not
---
This is good for Bitcoin.
---
Haha I did it on my laptop, just took this screenshot later from mobile
---
I'm well on my way to 99 ranged and 99 farming. I play pretty casually so I'm not sure which one I'm going to hit first.
---
Why the oof?
---
I think that's the point though, the leagues seems like a true challenge mode for Runescape itself, in this case only around zeah, where the meta will most likely change daily. I think this actually gives people a reason to try out new ways to do things without feeling like they are wasting time not playing the meta.
---
Either way, it's easy to do all your switches before going into a tomb, can't be too hard on mobile, imagine doing zulrah on mobile now that's a challenge
---
The update no one will come across:
---
Earlier I did a new run, and gave up about an hour in when I noticed my "brews" were strength pots.
---
Not too worried though. Already have a run around wave 50, which I had to logout of for now. With all the practice I got and even getting a ranged level from last attempt, I'm just gonna go grab the free cape as soon as I sober up a bit.
---
My very first account back in the day was 99 Woodcut. On my current main, my first and only 99 so far is Str.
---

---
remake into hardcore iron man. normie FE2+ man is dead content tbh, nuke the acc. Hardcore iron man btw
---
I like when you all interact with the community but then you're instantly bombarded by toxicity. I would just ignore the neckbeard trolls, and that goes for the whole team. This whole pokemon situation made me even more grateful for the OSRS team.
---
I don't think you realize you just made a logical conundrum. Let me spell it out for you. Put 1 real player per game of lms and 23 npc "bots" but they are jagex made nhing bots. Now you are fighting npcs, generating wealth from nothing. Or if you rather, take a goblin and a level 3 player or bot - the 3 gp they drop is generating wealth no matter how you look at it. People bot Zulrah just as much as lms and the Zulrah bots are worse for the game as it brings actual useful items into the game. Lms just brings 1 tele tab or a trouver parchment - which in order to use actually costs 500k cash.
---
As far as the PvP no risk fights.. well it's an impossible task to ask Jagex to fix that. Unless they make it so you always drop every item and protect item doesn't work - there will always be msb agsers that risk 20k. And even after they make it so you can't protect item then people will just risk an msb and a dds bringing the risk to 50k. Pkers will always risk the lowest amount they can for the highest KO potential - there's no reason to bring cash risk or fancy gilded chaps.
---
should've been a ironman you'd have the pet by now.
---
Kinda Machinima esque kinda just for fun, tell me if you hate it or liked it if you want.
---
r/the_magic_city/
---
DM me and I will add you...depending on what path you chose you will need a partner for legends quest. Im sitting at combat 90 and would be more than happy to play with you!
---
Nobody
---
Me: 200 death runes
---
and boaty
---
Maybe I'll do that then. What does that offer?
---
Herb runs are still good ? What herb should I start with? 
---
And do you know any swapping fcs I have about 70m on rs3 I think haha
---
U can do “forgot username” somewhere I’m pretty sure.
---
COMMUNITY SMACKDOWN
---
Ah well atleast you got a lot of comments now! You must be excited
---
What in the fuck....
---
Well how else would a sword breathe
---
This guy gets it!
---
Close enough
---
Dude what the fuckk..
---
That said its fun getting all the good gear so easily so you aren't fighting real people with shit gear
---
I think it's mostly fine. You have the option of not choosing a relic and waiting for other people to reveal those synergies to you, or you can pick one first thing and gain day 1 benefits.
---
Pretty sure that’s a Youngllef
---
Thats fucking creepy dude
---
🦀🦀 ORNATE HANDLES ARE TANKING 🦀🦀
---
Looks like toadflax is currently best: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs
---
What’s a swapping fcs, sorry?
---
Just use a poopsock lol
---
I was under the impression that max DPS is more important, at least in TOB
---
Not sure if I should upvote or downvote; this is properly messed up, even for us.
---
Thank you
---
Well hate reign of terror more specifically
---
CC:snail swaps
---
Make sure your talking with a rank and they will swap it for you no problems
---
There's only one spot for chins with like 8 or 9 chins in the area, and they are starting with 10 worlds so it may not be the best to go for chins anyway.
---
Thanks yeah it was a great feeling expecting like 40k and seeing 600k for like 10 min of work lol idk what that other guys problem is with his self ego boosting off my post lol
---
Ty
---
Imagine being part of a group that says shit like this over a 12 year old fantasy game
---
Yeh I'm more or less in the same boat, I'm 3 skills left to max cape but getting tired wanted a brake. I hope im just overthinking things and it will be just fun chill game mode.
---
You seem to have a lot of personal hatred for him, meanwhile he does his own thing and you don’t have to be involved in it
---
“Shit at this game” I’d like to see you riskfight him next stream :) any style
---
&gt; If you needed more reasons to hate the PvP community, here's a picture of Reign of Terror
---
Could've stopped there
---
I’ll probably got for attack or range next, but HP might get there first lol
---
Yes, I did. I don't know what you think he is trying to say.
---
Yeah yeah don’t rub it in lol
---
Hardcore Harvester: possibly bonus loot from farming?
---
Konar's Blessing: boosted drop rates/more loot from brimstone keys?
---
Eye of the Artisan: something that buffs Artisan skills, maybe increased xp rates or a chance to save resources? (Con/Cook/Craft/FM/Fletch/Herb/RC/Smithing)
---
Gift of the Gatherer: same as above except for gathering skills
---
Spirit of Dinh: gives you the defence skillcape perk
---
The S E X number :o
---
Isn't that a little cheap for a rune pouch?
---
To be fair, he did die at tough content, especially compared to Roidie.
---
Haha 100% support this, booty eating and all.
---
[deleted]
---
workshop with an armour stand for repairing barrows, if you still use that
---
costume room to save some bank space
---
maybe a dungeon if you don't care about load times, for unskulling
---
rs3 sometimes gives out portable deposit boxes that last for 60m once placed, could work very similar to that?
---
as long as its limited to use by the person who placed it ofc.
---
No but I will. Shut the fuck up.
---
If the accumulator worked on chins it would be a lot better, since each chin would be good for 4(?) throws
---
But I guess there aren't many good spots to use them anyway
---
I mean you could always make the barbarian potions useable by f2p, leave the creation members only, but it would give people a reason to use the potions again.
---
Perfect, sounds great.
---
Druidic ritual doesn’t count
---
Why the hell is the eating booty part in CONS??
---
Hey we dont do that! RoT is definitely an outlier in the pvp community! Even 25 buttholes public cc isnt that toxic!
---
Is RoT still a thing? I feel like I haven't heard about them at all in the last year or so.
---
Then again I don't really follow PvP at all any more.
---
Perhaps a 5-10m limit.. still decently high for a drop party but inconvenient to rwt large amounts
---
While nothing has been confirmed yet, there were talks of scaling the difficulty down for the twisted leagues. Not to mention the other higher tier relics will have some choices for helping you reach those lofty goals. I'd wait until tomorrow to see the full reveal of everything before jumping to any major conclusions.
---
better be
---
Definitely sounds like an oversight. Make sure to report it in game as well.
---
Got barrows gloves for the first time on my ironman at 86 cb a couple of weeks ago, is this normal or low level?
---
Thanks.
---
Gl,KING
---
Imagine going on the internet and asking wht's wrong with your math, getting legit answers and assuming everyone else is wrong lol
---
youll never be a real disney princess lmao
---
You also have services in the US like 'Privacy' where you can create multiple CC's on a whim.
---
Theres an 'optimal quest order' page on the official wiki that lists them in an order that reduces the amount of training you need to do to get requirements for the next quest. That's a great place to start an iron man because you unlock areas and items as you go and gives you a good goal. Once you've finished a lot of the quests you'll have nice stats and can chase gear upgrades and start killing bosses
---
Dragon sword, dragon hasta, dragon warhammer, and sarachnis cudgel are available between rune scim and whip.
---
Didn’t it use to say “leave it alone” or something like that? Why did they change it?
---
Thanks for the clarification. I forgot they would be adding the rewards from each league to the new leagues shop.
---
There's also dragon sword from wyrms and sarachnis cudgel (though you prolly don't want to grind that many sarachnis with a rune scimmy). But yeah, other than those you'd be using a rune scimmy until you can get a whip.
---
Total level "Yes" 
---
laughed to hard.
---
If you have a fucking job 100m in bonds is chump change.  Sometimes... it's about loving grind though.
---
Rip, gloves are the hardest to get..
---
Depends on how much they've had to invest into creating a league system and designing future leagues. If they're not in deep, they're just going to cancel over poor turnout.
---
Nah that’s only 65 RC.
---
I spent too much time making this
---
Why would you trade 90 mill for 90 mill anyways?
---
Hes unlucky but he made a lot of really bad decisions to end up that deep in debt. As you said he would statistically break even with no tax

---
Tbh this isn't even surprising.  I don't deal with account stuff often at all but from what I can tell, at least some of the shit that flies around is just a total meme.  When I returned to the game a couple years ago my old "real main" was perm banned for macroing like 5 years prior, right in the middle of the decade I didn't play the game, and I didn't really care so I just used my other account and that's my OSRS main now.  But recently after all the discussion about how awful Jagex is with bans, I tossed in an appeal for it on the website just to see what happens.  About 3 or 4 days later I got this exact same response about how they saw there was unusual activity on the account at that time and unbanned me.  For an offense from like 2012.
---
&gt;more loans
---
This is basically a ponzi scheme without the paying back extra.
---
consider buying one from the grand exchange at this point friend
---
Tf you laughing? go and get them!
---
skiller 1998 total kid with no Bh kills and no LMS score telling it how it really is in the PK scene and why we should vote no. 
---
In all seriousness, it’s definitely great that people like this will soon be unable to vote on PVP polls. If you don’t even participate in PVP in any way and the only thing you know about PVP clans or pking in general is memes on reddit how could you possibly form an intelligent unbiased opinion on the matter?
---
Fucking rowdy

God forbid illegal immigrants are sent back to the country they came from.

Forgot or didn’t care?
---
I too watched the WoW Shadowlands reveal and/or played the FF endless dungeon
---
makes sense. Revs is still a huge source of gp I suppose.
---
I wouldn’t even go for base 50’s I would just say start questing.
---
Alright man I’m gonna have to look into a guide!
---
Not really Jagex problem worse that can happen is they get some bad press if someone is dumb enough to die nolifing (has happen in the past with other games). Runescape has always been about addiction since more time playing = more xp/gp and higher ranks. Only a very small amount of people would take it to the extreme and it is on the individual overall, so yeah I agree nothing Jagex really can do about it unless they literally sat hard limits to how many hours you could log onto your account per day which would irate people even if the threshold was like 14 hours a day lol
---
