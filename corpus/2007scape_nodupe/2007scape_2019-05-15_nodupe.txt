You should consider the idea that there might be other reasons why people might not want to date you, even if it seems like you already know the reasons and you think you've got a pretty good picture of the situation. There are plenty of racists out there (it hits hard to see it happen in the nerd community!), and plenty of people who can't see past weight - but it's not all of them. Either you haven't met those other people, or you have and they've been driven away by something different than your appearance.
---
I'm only saying this because the tell-tale sign of a "Nice Guy" is complaining about how women complain about their boyfriends and won't date a "perfectly good guy" like yourself.
---
Here's a question: do you think you're *an interesting person*?

Yes to GE. some new scenery would be lovely. IDC if people think it will cause the old GE to be empty... It won't it'll just be a little less crowded. It gets old teleporting to the same grey building all day everyday.

You do get a lot less points and slightly less xp/hr but it's much more afk. You should gain more points than you spend on absorbs/overloads (atleast at higher levels you do).
---
If you're afking a lot e.g. frequently 15-20mins at a time not touching it at all then easy mode is better than hard imo.
---
For easy rumble the best bosses to use by my calculations are tree spirit, khazard warlord, kendal, sand snake, king roald.

Jagex has minigame world's just so that people can group with others doing a similar activity and have the feel of an mmo. Some require it, some don't. Most people would rather not be the only person doing a minigame. There are multiple world's so that everyone can have low ping and not deal with a full world.

---
You might like the idea of it, but it's boring as fuck. You'll probably spend 5 minutes, realize there's literally no reason to work the machine and then quit. It's not fun content. People would already go to the intended world and there would be nobody running the furnace. You would have to pay bots on a private world because everyone just wants to leech and not run it. That's the reality of it. They changed it because you're literally the only soul in existence that claims they WANT to run the blast furnace. People would literally sit at the ramp and complain for 30 sec+ while they wait for someone ELSE to fix it. Nobody wanted to do it.

If you have 50 ranged, you're good to go.
---
Nice! Inferno when? :)
---
so then its not nearly as overpowered because players will be trying to dscim or msb&gt; gmaul which is now smiteable for 10m. Instead of Ags&gt;gmaul or Claws&gt;gmaul with 30k risk.  Gmaul will no longer be viable for players not risking alot of money, and lower brackets that used msb or rcb&gt;gmaul will be super easy to smite.
---
Did you just uno reverse card me
---
I’m fairly certain my hair has gone white from the fire cape alone. Maybe I’ll hold off on infernal...

yeah it could work like the keys where the higher the wildy diary the more you can obtain

No colored Slayer helm
---
Pleb.
---
Now that you mention it I’m annoying as fuck
---
Each weapon type has their own options for training. If you equip a gmaul. Select defence, switch to a sword and select str, then switch back to the gmaul it will still be on def. Also if you haven't equipped a weapon since the update I think it selects defence.
---
wyverns drop some items noted
---
DDS? Dmace? Dark bow?  You'll still be able to gmaul, but you'll just have to protect Item which alot of pures already do. Difference is you can smite said pures for a 10m drop instead of a 30k drop.
---
Low level is negligible.  High level is what it impacts which is good because the meta is stupid stale. its Ags&gt;gmaul  Claws&gt;gmaul  Eldermaul &gt;gmaul.   a t50 weapon costing 30k should not be the end all be all to every bracket, at every level..
---
No crab is delicious my sir.

The fail rate is so low that I don't think this is worth worrying about.
---
It might not be AS reliable, but it still happens super consistantly. Plus you have way better gear. B gloves, D boots, fighter torso, Nezzy helm, Piety, etc..
---
like the guy said. a 30k t50 weapon should not be the end all be all for literally every bracket, at every level, for every build.
---
yes, but they could do it on their own accounts for similar amounts of gp/cash, making it a question of the value of doing it and obtaining a cape. which is the same answer. 
---
if anything, it would be worth a little less as there's less hassle.
---
People watching Torvesta PK videos where it's probably like 10 hours of pk footage condensed into a 10min video where it only has the best specs and that's what they base their opinions on. Probably never pked in their life.

Yes but the quality of your teams will directly correlate with your combat level unless you're an established BA player

Sgs &amp; bonecrusher op.
---
Why are you being so aggressive about this?! What jumped up your craw? 
---
Going to just reply paragraph by paragraph here. 
---
1. You are exagerating by saying that LITERALLY nobody else wanted to do it. There are tens of thousands of players, do you honestly think that I am the SINGLE person who would be interested in it? Like honestly, think about that.
---
2. Displace hundreds of people??? What did I say that suggested that? My suggestion was actually the complete opposite. Add more of the Bot worlds by adding them to every world and then just add 1 or 2 wolds to cater to the handful of us who would rather do it otherwise. 
---
&gt;You'll be alone no matter what
---
Again, you're exaggerating here about the amount of people who would rather do this. Literally all of my friends would prefer to have access to play it as a group so, go ahead and toss that idea out now.
---
3. Another illogical paragraph, ignoring.
---
4. Wow, seriously calling me retarded? What the hell is wrong with you? I don't understand how this is going over your head? It sounds fun to me, I don't know what you want me to say. Like I said, I do a LOT of stuff that other players would question because it's just how I play RS. I play for role-playing. I don't mind the grind. It's very odd that I need to convince you that I would enjoy something?
---
5. You keep saying "You and only you". Come on, you can't seriously think out of the tens of thousands of people I am LITERALLY the single only person lol. That's just such a ridiculous point of your argument, it's completely baseless. I know I'm in the minority here but let's be real.
---
And also you are right, it does basically change nothing, so what is the harm? 
---
6. Again with the "You and you alone" thing haha. Such a crazy thing to actually believe. And also you realize my entire point is that I DONT want to do it alone, right? That's like, the whole idea here bud.
---
7. Boy howdy, what a way to end a tangent. I guess I found your hot button, didn't I?
---
Except it’s viable for everyone. Baby pures can 1 spec you and take your 50k loot but ags/gmaul is still popular even for maxes pures or specking people out in revs while only risking 30k.
---

No, you didnt. First part isnt blacked out.

He's using a slayer helm anyways so there is no set effect
---
Yeah I totally believe that's why they're doing it, but mobile has been out for months now, why is it suddenly so urgent?
---
I remember when lava dragons was the hottest spot in the wild to make money and pk before rev caves were introduced. Lava dragons should be dropping dragon platelegs and skirt at the very least to increase it's gp/hr so more people would opt to kill these.

100% boils down to what you enjoy most. If you like the way RS does it's story telling then some of the quests can be fun, but still confusing. Tons of external resources through wiki, reddit or SlayerMusiq1 and you'll get some good leads.

Counts as having been hit by someone else unfortunately, and likely why hes asking. Bosses like kq, kbd, and corp will regen their health because they are not instanced fights and thus when people leave the fights because they die or w.e else and dont return, they will regen to full and look like they are a fresh kill. Ironmeme kills it for no loot and gets sad.

Ever since one update  world order has been alphabetical instead of by number, how to fix??

I just think there's a better option than simply letting the bots roam free.
---
but the OP picture is about pures. pures already just use gmaul. they lose it because firecape protects over it. yeah there are some pures that use ags/claws-&gt;gmaul, but at like 80+ cmb. the big majority that uses that combo are not pures.

If you're feeling some skilling, Wintertodt is a pretty good place to get some beginner supplies (fish, logs, seeds, herbs).
---
I know it isn't much, but do the dwarf cannon quest to get the ammo mould, then buy steel bars to make cannonballs. It's a slow, repetitive process, but it'll give you decent starter money and xp to get the ball rolling!
---
why aren't you polling content changes?
---
No. When you get to it, you can kill it without taking any damage. Look up slayermusiq1 quest guide on YouTube. He is the go to for all questing guides.
---
Well if ur smithing bronze bars for cash before you should try blast furnace. Making steel bars will easily get you another bond. Aside from that u should keep quest to get barrows gloves and start working on slayer. Make small goals and achieve them like firecape, slayer gear, skilling goals etc... and if you dont want to do any of that you can just have a consistant money maker that will get you bonds and do whatever the hell you like.
---
"Good, very good!" Lol
---
Well you gotta keep in mind, +10 ranged accuracy isn't much sure. But when you're doing the 20k kills it took for him to get the visage, I'd imagine it's a pretty nice chunk of time saved. Even if it was like, half a kill more per hour, that's an extra 250 kills throughout the grind. I'd also imagine it's more then half a kill per hour to get that +10 accuracy.
---
Yes but if you wanted to sort by population and activity youd have f2p worlds mixed in with your results. Hiding the things youll more than likely never use and sorting a cleaner list is just better
---
god damn you're stupid if you think that's a fair equivalent

why is jagex so scared of polls? is it because they still have ptsd from sailing?

Probably talked to and/or received experienced players, or dicked around for weeks until you figured out what to do because you were 9 and undoubtedly had the time. Something like this wonderful suggestion would alleviate both of those issues. Your argument is essentially boiling down to a pot of bullshit.
---
Classic Jed
---
&gt; you’re gonna need to kill like 20k zulrah anyway
---
You're talking like this is something people actually do. Here's a hint: they don't. Only a very select few people ever came close to 20k kills, and most of those aren't ironmen.
---
You can get kill count normally, nothings stopping you.

They have time to react if you're NH bridding. 
---
NTM, most of the time Maul checks for 0.
---
Honestly though, nerfing the G-maul would be bad because then you're promoting D-throwing Axe/Knives for stacks. 
---
This would just increase the skill ceiling for tribridding because you'd need to prayer switch when going for the stack, which I'm fine with.
---
What I'm not fine with is giving more reasons for people to complain about Ranged.
---
Combo eating in the game means you need to be able to stack in Edgeville style pking though or the opponent teleports.

Random questions about GE Offers.
---
As far as I know if you're completely inactive (not logged in at all) for 7 days your ge offers go inactive. 
---
1. Does simply logging in again "reactive" these offers or would you have to cancel the offer and redo it? 
---
2. Similarly - if you go f2p, with a members item offer in (but still actively play, basically forgot to bond up in time and your membs drops but you reactive mems right away) does it cancel the offer and even going back to members require you to cancel offer and put it in again, or would acquiring membership be all thats needed to activate the offer once more? 
---
3. Assuming you don't need to cancel offer and redo them in the above examples, how does the offer "reactivating" effect its offer/que priority? Would it try to put its place in line where it was prior to temporarily being inactive, or would you put it in the very back of the line, as if it was a brand new offer?
---
Pls remove wildy trench Jayflex it hurts my gains
---
Did i hear 50/50?
---
Do you even understand what you are arguing.  How is a TIER 50, 30k weapon being used at every bracket, by every level, from lvl 50's to lvl 126's a healthy state of pvp.  Its a broken weapon. Its made the meta super stale, and forced players to sit at higher and higher hp's and they can STILL be stacked out at any seccond by gmaul at 120hp.
---
Also, I'm not sure what you classify as 'active PKing' but pretty much the entire community disagrees with you and pursues PvP updates because the community has died off so much, and is getting progressivly worse and worse over time due to the exact lack of updates you are pushing for.
---
It's not that popular on Rigour Tanks, as they usually opt for 60 attack for claws and 88 str 
---
or 75 Atk for SoL/pvm stuff.
---
You are so dim-witted... a single restaurant by itself will try to position itself directly in the center of their consumer base. Competitors will naturally be drawn to that location in order to compete for that restaurant's customers. Seeking out customers is literally seeking out competitors due to spatial competition.. unless you are the first business of that kind in that particular area. Use your brain, little one.

Guess so. I think the official drop rate is 1/8000ish

Jagex deserves to implement changes to the game without polling them.

I dunno about you but I generally feel like quitting PKing when I have the third person in a row run after AGS gmauling me on the first unfreeze, or the 3rd death in a row be due to a 90+ AGS gmaul stack from a random person PJing my fight.

If you where to click on a random square, it would be 10^(4), but if you choose the first square, it's 10^(3)

Because

1. Sometimes you screw up and accidentally click the defensive style and gain unwanted-irreversible defence xp.  
---
2. It acts as "insurance" for future quests that give mandatory def xp

3. 45 looks better than 47

what better way to kill a game then force updates. fucking spot on donnie.

&gt;1. You are exagerating by saying that LITERALLY nobody else wanted to do it. There are tens of thousands of players, do you honestly think that I am the SINGLE person who would be interested in it? Like honestly, think about that.
---
Yes. Literally. It was already a thing. Nobody did it before. You will be the only person. Nobody will use your world, and you won't get anyone to help you. You WILL be the only person.
---
2. Displace hundreds of people??? What did I say that suggested that?
---
You literally want the blast furnace worlds to have no bots so that you can run the blast furnace poorly by yourself for nobody. What the fuck is the logic of that? The blast furnace world's should be designed around what 99.99% of people using the blast furnace are doing. Not what you want. That's retarded. You keep thinking that's how it should be, so you're probably retarded.
---
&gt;3. Another illogical paragraph, ignoring
---
Youve ignored everything else ive said considering you're still repeating your original argument.

That's ironic coming from the retard that can't get it through his head that the change that would change literally nothing about how blast furnace used to work would change the number of people who operated blast furnace. It was already 0. It will stay 0. You are the only person.
---
&gt;And also you realize my entire point is that I DONT want to do it alone, right
---
Here you go again being retarded. EVERYONE. yes, EVERYONE, will use the bot world's. You will be alone. Your change will do nothing to get people on your botless world. You will ALWAYS be alone. What the fuck don't you understand about the fact that it was ALREADY a thing and that NOBODY did it.
---
&gt;Here's a fun thought experiment: If "literally" every single individual player on Runescape hates it, then why have ANY worlds without the bots?? Why even bother? Why not just have bots on every world and be done with it?
---
Thought experiment lmao? Bro, if you want to at least argue about how the blast furnace and it's worlds should be designed, at least fucking know a thing or two about it. People use the botless world's for hpless strength training for pures. Those people are ONLY doing that, and don't give a shit to help you run your furnace. You will still be the only one.
---
And yes, I can say you will be literally the only one, because it has happened before you stupid fuck. Nobody did it before. Why the fuck do you think they'll do it for no reason when there are bots now?
---
You should really stop offering game suggestions or talking about game design when you're literally braindead.
---
Yeah it must be a bad path after my house finally got wifi restored from comcast. I dont know how to check the router settings though. Its strange because it's happening to me on the official oldschool client aswell. Not just runelite
---
Well, yeah. 3 screens. NMZ, Pornhub, and Rune Dragon alt.
---
Have you ever gone deep wildy tribridding?  Half the people will AGS gmaul you on the first unfreeze even if you're 100 HP because there's still a chance that they can kill you.  After that they run to lever.  It's utterly ridiculous.
---
Really? Before I deironed I had about 1k kc, and maybe my account just had shit rng but I did the math and I figured I’d need to kill another 5k kills minimum.
---
funny that she called it, "herblaw," considering that's what it was called in classic.
---
How OP would NPC contact to Phials be?
---
Thanks! I honestly was 100% expecting to hit 99 RC without ever seeing this thing :D
---
lol, ok
---
I suggest you buy an obby shield and cape + the  solomon store retro d chain armour and wear it for a week,  i will join you too haha
---
Fell for this scam just the other day. Not the full "anti-lure" part, but the animation delay bug abuse part. Reported, but as of now, the guy is still apparently unbanned. From what people have told me, jagex doesn't give 2 shits about people abusing this specific bug.
---
Embarrassingly, after losing the majority of my bank, I thought back to a yt video I watched only a week or so before, showing the bug and how it was abused
---
And all cos I wanted to put a cocky lv 120-something in his place for thinking 15m was a lot of money... Still kicking myself for falling for such a stupidly transparent scam. I knew it was dodgy that he wanted me to show items in a trade, but I didn't think that was the actual scam itself.
---
Oh well... Slowly getting back the money I lost. At least this has motivated me to get better at efficient gold-farming and merching. I suspect I'll be back to where I was in a week or so at my current rate. So not entirely a loss for me!
---
Every now and then I'll lose interest in something I try to keep as a hobby whether its OSRS, RS3, WoW or what have you, losing interest and wanting to call it quits on something you had fun with isnt the end of the world. Just keep your account and items in case you get the itch to play again is the best two cents I can offer
---
If you think it needs a nerf in this way and that this is the solution, you clearly dont pk. You must only bh and pvp world fight.
---
If you have a main, stick to 70 because the extra stuff you get from 75 are so expensive for the bonuses that they give that you won't be using them when pking anyway.
---
If you don't have a main, 75 def gives you more options when PvMing.
---
My med is a 75 atk, 99 str, 70 def, 77 prayer, 99 range, 99 mage, 99 hp, 108 combat.
---
But why 45 def?
---
This sounds perfect, I don't have a main but I'm still leaning towards 70 def
---
Are there any solutions being thought up to deal with the Scouting bots that are being used by clans? The bots are very obvious, and cause a lot of issues.
---
How many charges did you use on your bone crusher?
---
Around 10 tries i think. Probably because I didn't know about the recoils until the last couple of tries..
---
you get 220 scales/kill average from just scale drops (normal 100% drops and the 500 scale drop) and another 117 per kill from chiseling uniques, so 4k kills on average gets you about 1.3m scales, theres a somewhat significant variance though on the scales from the uniques
---
Hahahhaha i love how they wanted to bring more playet into pvp but all the changes ive seen proposed will turn most people away. Gf jagex we jad a good 6 years without you fucking over pvp. Guess we'll have to wait for old oldschool servers again. Fuck why not jist an ability bar while ur at it...
---
for some reason my 2nd picture never got copied and pasted. it's because it had protect range prayer on (40% reduction)
---
looks sick, support!
---
How much exp did you gain and what lvl did you start?
---
7,200 tokens used in the dungeon to get my dragon defender. That’s 12 hours
---
I'm not really sure someone who says meds and mains shouldn't think about Gmaul should be criticizing how others think, especially since it appears you didnt even read my comment.  
---
And to answer your question that no one asked, making the Gmaul be a +1 would make it so solo PKers who risk about 500k-1m never bring it in favor of AGS or claws, but people high risking with teams would probably still bring it.
---
Thanks for your reply. Yea of course. I quit for a while and came back because I had some medical issues. I’m sure I’ll play again but this is honestly the first time where I want to close that chapter on rs in my life. It’s a weird feeling lol.
---
Nope
---
Sounds like you need fix somethings and not play rs my friend. Best of luck.
---
I love how the houses look in OSRS compared to RS3, would be really great to see a texture pack / upgrade to bring the RS3 houses up to speed
---
Same here! Hilarious because I’ve taken clueless kids out to the wildy and killed them
---
My financial situation is kinda screwed right now. I wish that were the case....
---
I'll trim your armor.

Yeah, I'll bir the bullet and just wait it out. I doubt anyone will loan it to me. As you said it's a common scam. Thanks for the info tho

---
You're not tricking anyone, move on
---
Yeah I understand and I agree that a path would still be a good addition. But, you can't dent that runescape is an extremely hard game to learn (in terms of all the content that's added). My girlfriend was f2p her whole life and when we started dating, I got her membership. It was like a completely new game to her and she had to do so much research. She agreed to do it because she played for years and wanted to play with me. I guarantee if a random new player joins rs and doesn't understand how much you have to grind, that 5 minute walk to Varrock/Falador could potentially put them off the game. But yeah idk - they said the teleport system would show the path to these places so I don't think it's that bad
---
I currently have a mid level account (around 1800 total) and Im considering making an ironman but as much as some points look great, certain skills seem like they would be absolute ass to grind if you got to collect all that yourself (Smithing comes to mind) :Should I just ignore those skills and get supplies later on through pvm? 
---
i never watched/read much on the ironman playstyle but it seems very overwhelming to go from a regular main back to square one, hopefuly reddit can help me a bit :)
---
stats are definitely enough. i did it with 66 range. i was much wealthier but didnt have the levels to buy much of the expensive gear anyway. the only gear suggestion i have is try devout boots. disable your prayer during the special attacks. those two may enable you to bring 1 less prayer pot or something. use range potion and pray range. also look at using super antifires  + mage pray so that you can use an offensive offhand (not sure about this one but it's an idea)
---
oh and diamond and ruby bolts like everybody else is saying. in fact, get a dragon crossbow so that you can use diamond dragon and ruby dragon bolts.  dwh would be nice but expensive and with your stats youre likely to not hit anyway. gl
---
Save for bond
---
I'm not trying to trick anyone? I just asked if you could sell members items as a non member. I havent asked for anything....
---
Was considering it but the levels just don’t do anything for me anymore. And I never really cared about my total and it’s over 1970. Was considering getting 2k but then what lol. Not like I can kill revs. 
---
I mean I can grind out the t now and all but achieving these goals just don’t do anything for me any more. I can’t really explain it.
---
Is kraken not good money anymore?

That makes sense, something to make recovery time go by faster I feel. While closing chapters of your life can be a bit outlandish, I'm sure you'll find something very rewarding in replacement. Best of luck to you!

If you're stupid enough to carry large amounts of wealth around anywhere near an open PvP zone you probably deserve to get scammed.

&gt; same thing over and over again.
---
Welcome to runescape.
---
His last couple videos definitely were different and not as great imo, compared to the beginning. And I didn't think they were "worth the wait" but he has a few HUGE grinds that he has to do now, so its going to be in a little lull before it gets super hype again (when he does ToB). The earlier episodes were packed full of a lot of progress (skills, questing), getting around the accounts restrictions, etc. "A snails camping the bridge, so im going to hop" etc.
---
 He has to do these huge grinds atm. Which is literally the same thing over and over again. 
---
Although, with his skills he may be able to make the episodes great/interesting/entertaining (at least more than what the content he has for them will). 
---
I'm picturing this next ep a lot better than the last 1-2 at least. And it'll probably improve once he has the whip.
---
Wiki says they both weapons have a 2.4 second interval though?

If you know which book/item they use to make the delay, submit a bug report ingame. Jmods have said that they will fix these delays/glitches.

Awesome idea.

Oh cool! Good to know. Thank you. :) I picked up a quest to make a cake for a chef so I'll start with that haha!

As a PvPer I appreciate your effort in trying to improve the PvP scene. However most of our voices are still unheard. Surely there’s a better way to voice our opinions? Some changes are catered to a single niche of PvP only.
---
no

No, it isnt, otherlike yours.

There is a push for such changes, meanwhile your opinion is completely ignorable.

Dont be mad just cause youre wrong mate.

Thats not how probability works my friend. Theres 10 digits eh? 1/10 chances for the first key to be at the right place and the same for the 3 others. You then do 1/10x1/10×1/10×1/10= the correct probability of the it happening.

If you teleport in? then there is no reason to use it because people would just camp out to kill you as soon as you go through. Might as well use a burning amulet.

If you only do magics/dragonfruits the drop rate for farming pet is like 130m+ exp lol you're not even close to dry yet
---
True, but then if I were in a DM and the choice was gmaul or AGS I would choose AGS for consistency and still having a chance to KO after the spec - gmaul only gets one or two chances per fight and noodles a lot.
---
If theoretically they made an even stronger spec weapon than anything that exists, as long it didn't require over 50% (or 60% with a timer) you could still stack it with gmaul. For almost no extra risk!
---
You absolute legend, mate

Glad you agree :)
---
I took a massive break from tree and birdhouse runs. I couldn’t be bothered anymore to be honest. I don’t really give a shit, all I do atm is farm Mahogany and Magic tree’s every 3 days after stopping for a few months. It’s obviously a lot slower but still something and takes less than 5 minutes every 3 days or so for decent exp. I don’t even do bird house runs anymore. Just either get back into it slowly or whenever you feel like it. Don’t do content you dread. I used to love tree and birdhouse runs, not for another long while.

Why do players like polls so much? is it because they still have ptsd from eoc?

tbh I know how it'll affect pvp and I'm happy about it lmfao

It needs to be nerfed whether people like it or not tbh, dds-gmaul-dds is crazy powerful anyway, bh is plagued with people who dump gmaul specs then tele when they can and its infuriating
---
Nah, he said he joined the purple portal, there were 2 options in the purple portal, the safe one where you wouldn't lose stuff and the dangerous one ( like the red portal) where you would lose all your stuff. There were a lot of clan wars back then and most of them were sorted in purple portal with all stuff lost on death.

Mining is definitely it but also the slowest!

I think it’s fine if people wanna 1 tick spec/ dump spec with gmaul. I’m just glad they are making it to where if you kill someone like this you have a chance of smiting/getting more than fucking 30k lmao.

---
i recommend anyone who hasn’t, to watch the video where they use the right amount of ‘greats’ it would take to get to the year 3000
---
1. It's kinda just a consequence of your combat stats being fairly low right now. Do you have a gear swap for when you switch to ranged? Rune armor has negative ranged attack bonuses, and simply switching to green d'hide and a coif/archer's helm will improve your accuracy against Ahrim.
---
2. Not really, if anything you'd want to TP to Clan Wars to restore health as well, but like you've been told it's usually worth it to spend a little extra money to get faster kills.
---
3. You tried tanking Dharok, who does more damage the less health he has. He's one of the most important brothers to pray against. You want to do Dharok first (axe guy, top left), then Ahrim (the mage guy, center), then Karil (ranged guy, bottom center) because they do a ton of damage even at mid-70s combat stats. People generally tank the other 3 brothers (Torag, Verac, Guthan) but at your defense you might have a slightly harder time.
---
4. I kinda disagree with the other user that Barrows isn't good money, I think it's a super solid option for mid-level accounts that aren't strong enough to do Zulrah/Vorkath yet and either aren't able or don't want to do skilling moneymakers. That being said, your combat stats are on the low side, so your kills are going to be very pretty slow and you'll spend more on food and prayer pots as a result. You shouldn't need a crazy amount of money at your level, and you might want to consider focusing on questing + skilling in the meanwhile to shoot for goals like barrows gloves, dragon defender, torso, etc.
---
5. You want just below 88%. 3 skeletons is very convenient, especially if you bring a salve amulet for the damage boost, but it puts you just over 88 which gives you a small chance at getting bolt racks. If you want to be optimal, you kill all 6 brothers and then try to get just under 88 - the easiest ways are 2 skeletons + 1 worm, or 4 worms. There are other ways on the wiki, but these are simplest.
---
Barrows is a very respectable way to get cash around mid-70s melees/ranged/mage when you have no other really good PvM moneymaker, but it sounds like kills are too slow right now to be really worth your time. I also would recommend aiming for Morytania hard as a long-term goal - it was for me, and it helped me achieve a ton of skilling goals that I wouldn't have otherwise.
---
Dust devils!
---
I use dragon chain legs boots and a farseer helm and mage hits just fine against karil

Is it worth more money to sell plain Pizza than Anchovy?
---
I've done some raw calculations. With buying pizza base, cheese &amp; tomato, I will have 150gp profit.
---
If I will buy Ancohvy, which is currently about 100gp each. I will increase my cost, but I will have 185gp profit.   
---
However, with Plain Pizza I have to prep 2 times total. Thus, the time prepping will be 75gp.   
---
With Anchovy Pizza I have to prep 3 times. 185 / 3 = 61.6gp
---
Wouldn't Plain Pizza's be more value in the time spent?
---
I've never been to oovoo javer.

It really do be like that

Can actually confirm, both times i started a new account i got lots of money from a stranger when killing goblins lol, first time it was 1mil and second time 100k.

Would you be interested in purchasing a rare black lobster?

I had the same issue, started to feel like buying membership became a waste if I don't play it every minute, so I just stopped playing. Hope you have better luck! xD

That was my goal from RS 2 days too. Never quite made it then, but couple years ago managed to get it in OSRS. Feels good to walk around in that cape. Was default cape until got first 99 this year.
---
Can you please re-poll the defence requirement on blessed d'hide chaps and vambraces?
---
Torture (or) is being treated as a tradeable item on death (same as if it didn't have an ornament kit attached). In PVM all tradeable items have their values, yes, BUT UNtradeable items are always SAFE. It even says it in on the wiki: "allowing the player to always keep it on death against NPCs". Rune platebody + platelegs + full helm + dragon boots (or). You keep all 4 (even though the tradeable items are lower in value).
---
Nah, she’s sucking on this swamp meat while I make my new HCIM and ain’t stopping till I get back to that boss lair

As soon as I realized that level of potential for the bonecrusher ss well as best xp/hr for cheap ranged &amp; mage 99s (+ decent prayer xp alongside it) it just immediately became my next goal. Shit is crazy nice for slayer :)
---
Will never pass a poll. Only way to nerf maul is to do it without polling as a game integrity update.

Elite void isn't bad, it's right behind ktop, kbot, barrows gloves and slay helm without task. Seems to very consistently 0.2 dps behind standard range gear. With void you do lose out on +50 range defense, +30 mage and +30 stab defense, not that big of a deal but something to keep in mind if doing multi kill trips. Though starting out if you don't have tormented bracelet it's better to use elite void mage, and at that point might as well just bring the ranged helmet for minimal swaps.
---
Prims add more dps even if you use barrows legs for more defence it comes out ahead for dps over tassets. So yes prims are better

Think about it this way, for every attempt you make, what you want to happen will either happen, or it won't. So if you were to attempt something 100 times, then, on average, it will either happen or it won't 100 times. 100 divided by 2 (happens, doesn't happen) is 50. Therefore the chance is 50/50.

Damn I wonder how that feels *looks at my placeholder for twisted bow I no longer have* *cries*

The difference is that new players didn't crawl out from the womb in past 3 years.

You can be offended all you want, it doesn't affect me nor does it somehow ruin my point.

What some people have been doing, and I have been myself (brag) is to post a video under the same keywords the scammer is using. Like this one https://youtu.be/aUMonffgXTc
---
I've seen different people use different videos. I think it's great and it's helping for sure. I've seen very convincing scammers at ge and can understand that some people fall for it.

How about this, use your brain and don't get scammed.

????? I never said you were?

Either way, that's a good thing.

We need more Darwinism nowadays and guys like him are the only reason brainlets are kept in check.

Lumbridge guide walks up to new player, hands them a list of gossips to visit and complete one task each. Once done they can return for a prize(xp lamp or cosmetic or black plate idk)
---
Tasks can be simple quests or killing a monster or give them 10 tin ores with advice on how to complete them at each step from the gossips - should all be within their existing skill level so they don't need to train for it

To me Yews come most often (You can chalk that up to RNG). This is exclusively for hard tasks and from my own observation from having done an ungodly amount of contracts. 
---
If we were to assume either yew or maple came up more often (for hard contracts), we'd need a large sample size to prove this. 
---
"Yews are certainly not worth: they cost more than seed pack rewards," or more than an easy pack, and equal to medium pack but, and according to you "85k for hard contracts (based on gut feelings)," so definitely not over hard contracts. 
---
Even if you were dismiss a hard contract and land a maple medium, it would still be better to dismiss and go down to whatever you get on easy contracts because of the long tree growth time. 
---
Again, this is just on RNG. If we could get a sample size, that would be lovely.

people have known how to 1 tick for a long time even back in 2007. Just wasn't as common. However, I dont see the 1 tick gmaul spec even being the problem. But the price it costs for how good of a spec wep. it is is way too low.

Can Verzik P3 be re-looked at in regards to when somebodies dies. It still goes crazy and off its original target when somebody dies causing people to either get hit by the meele attack because its totally unpredictable or having to stand away and lose dps. This was supposed to be fixed a few weeks ago and we were told to give feedback if not.
---
It doesn't have a minor prayer bonus.

Can I post this next month?

I know your pain I lost 50m to this scam about a month ago.  Once I learned how it worked I spent a few hours following them and preventing it from happening to some players.

---
Wow you are truly clueless on a completely different level than anybody else ive seen on this god awful sub, and that really says something LOL.
---
Like wow, im not sure if youre just trolling or are actually this retarded because these are things that a majority of pkers universally agree upon. How on earth youre going to blame parts of the game that are dead or broken and people ragging/scripting as "excuses and tied to fragile egos" is some truly next level ignorance and idiocy.
---
GL in life, gonna be tough when youre this stupid, dont forget to breathe.
---
Yeah it seems pretty fake. Not that the situation is impossible, more than the writing on the post looks like an obvious troll.
---
Reddit is literally customer support
---
Did you luckily get their cash stack too?
---
We really gonna call this *elaborate*?
---
I could swear I remember seeing the score of some stickied comments ages ago.
---
Have a seat....

A full 10m out of the 60m bank I had. 4m which went to recovering my name. I'm so fortunate.

This was a good watch, thanks for sharing. Would be a shame to repeat past mistakes
---

---
Thanks for the reminder brah, I often hold my breath too long. People don't call majority of Pkers brainlets for no reason, it's a meme but it's gotta start somewhere. Majority of pkers are retarded so I don't have any doubt they feel the same way you do.
---
Only because they posted to a different sub
---
wow who would have guessed a community with over 350k members would show up in other places!! thats so cool and original
---
&gt;you have a very very generous amount of time to make switches after submersion.
---
No you don't. Not when you're trying to figure out exactly where to move, what's next on the rotation picture, and doing your switches.

PLEASE!!! OMFG
---
 im sick of pvp worlds in the mix, people have lost bils from just automatically clicking yes, on autopilot.

IMO logging into a pvp world should tele you to the closest safe zone or some shit

How are you using fire wave with trident? Do you cast it manually?

Ungrateful as hell

Would’ve been a good post without the “humor”. Is legit love to see useless items have a use.

yeah i think so, personally never done it though

Yeah man they made it even easier for green dragon bots/gold farmers and made the wilderness safer for absolutely no reason.

10/10 good idea bud.

^Why I vote no on every pvp content update

I once lost 18 duels in a row which is 1/262k

How long did it take
---
Easier to safespot once you lose agro
---
piss off. use the topic title properly next time.
---
What should be the priority in terms of melee gear for PvM? I just unlocked Wyverns so I'm able to make cash faster now.
---
Although bottling and using scripts in low and high level accounts are considered to be extremely bannable. Is there a certain level account to where botters using software that so advanced it’s not detected are just ignored. Meaning are the priorities for voting spread across the whole game or is it just targeted at newer accounts?
---
Also if a magic solution where all botters were banned, what are your thoughts on how the in game economy would fair from this?
---
weird flex but okay
---
I’m sorry that you’re so hateful. Go away.
---
Remove the spec completely.
---
Add a drop to Guardians that changes the alch price, and puts the spec back on.
---
Terraria sucks me in to the point where I have to beat the game all the way through... and my characters never seem to be there when I come back.

No but they are exploring a new world with new rules. If helping them gets them to stay longer, why are so against it?

This is one of the first wilderness bosses so the examine text dates from that period.

Excuse me sir what the fuck

I do know that AHK is bannable, though.
---
I tried wow and the tutorial was ass
---
Is it reasonable to say that this is the actual problem that should be solved?
---
I'd be up for all osrs. Farming update, well if your farming is 1, you might not know enough about farming to make a good decision.
---
This could also work as an Arceuus thing, what with their crop revival spell.
---
Only getting fat girl pussy for rest of ur days
---
At 15k-25k points you chance for a twisted bow is between 0.06% and 0.1% for a twisted bow.
---
That's a 1/1667 and a 1/1000 chance. The chance of a unique drop scales linearly between 15k and 25k points.
---
I don't plant normal trees because they make the run significantly longer and I hate doing dailys, I don't have enough money to spend 3m-4m on farming every week but I don't want to bother spending time just for 1300 xp per tree from  willows
---
I’m not too privy on him besides the whole drop party thing
---
At the time it was implemented I don’t know if there were any others.
---
Either way the negative karma gain in that post is real.
---
There are unofficial cwa's.
---
And lots of similar things on sharkbrew but majority of mods won't even know it exists, be great if at least 1 jmod actually pked.
---
Not for things like reporting people lol it actually breaks the rules here

Ok thanks so much I should get one by 2k kc then I hope gl

UIM can store the graceful outfit in their player owned house, so that would be a very dumb UIM.

Can’t answer the second question I’m afraid - no idea! But I was using a smoke staff (is that the 10% damage one? That one!), occult neck, mystic robes, infinity boots, chaos gloves, Farseer helm, and that pointy shield with the magic bonuses. Nothing too weird or pricey :)

For jad phase you just gotta alternate attack styles every time she attacks, so at least you don't have to read anything.
---
At 20k points a raid it will take you on average 43 raids per item. .9% chance of getting a tbow every 43 raids.
---
pussy eyes (not hate btw)
---
At least 20 before my first kill.
---
There is support for this, like the multiple HD clients we've seen come and go. I personally want HD, but I think the community is almost 50/50 or 70/30 in favor of the older graphics, and either way, jagex said it would not only take forever to create the update, but to make it toggleable they would have to create and HD and old-school version of every texture when new updates come out, so it'll forever make content take longer to make.
---
Personally I want HD, but I don't really want curses, dung, summoning, constitution, pretty much everything that came after 08.
---
I know it's heresy on this sub, but that stuff is actually in RS3. Despite the MTX bull (that part is actually terrible, I have no defense for that), if you can get past EOC (which only took me a few days), that game still has all of that stuff in it, and the experience for those things you listed is almost completely untouched. There's a lot of talk about how bad it is, but I don't think many people that enjoyed the pre-eoc era has given it a fair chance.
---
You're a complete meme
---
Oh then we're in total agreement tbh. Either everyone gets to vote on everything, or we start putting in restrictions on voting. I'm fine either way just so long as it's all even stevens.
---
Lol. Straight up adorable.

You guys better watch it, this lad's in CCs!

Meh I can totally see your point and 99 herb in on my list of goals anyway but I cba getting 99 herb on my pure too just to keep up with other pkers in my bracket that will get 99 herb and for that reason I'd vote no if it was polled
---
Yea I think restrictions would definitely help make sure good updates actually pass. Otherwise you have players who don't know anything about a skill voting on updates for that skill. And I know the idea of a player not knowing a skill seems a bit off, but it's actually very common with new members, which we've had a lot of lately.
---
That wasn't his statement though. And with some diaries done in kandarin, I've had much better luck with marks of Grace than I ever did in Canifis (unfortunately)

If you had a popular website or game you’d have ads don’t kid yourself.
---
My questions are towards the new quest:
---
1. It doesn't need a diary if something the diary cape needs a buff.
---
2 . The  "Blade of Saeldor" will make the  Ghrazi rapier useless, don't do it.
---
3.Prifddinas  Agility Course: I love this idea but I would like something like the  gnome restaurant minigame which would be a bit different from the normal  running of agility in laps. Plus giving stuff to people will give a  reason on why you are running.
---
4.  Divine Potions: I'm kinda biased with this. I don't like new potions  coming in. I wish there was a slight mix between barbarian mixes and  divine potions to be honest. This might require lower/same herblore  requirements as specified but have only 2 doses.
---
5.  The armor: In one stream you say black d'hide is overpowered and in  another one you would like to introduce something much more tanky. The  crystal seeds will be worthless compared to the final set. I would like  this to be reworked a bit to be a tribrid armor with a staff as well. It  ~~can~~ **should** have inferior stats to mystics + black d'hide + rune platelegs/torags legs.
---
6.  I would like a pvp kind of battle to happen as well (like the last man  standing) where you can fight for the amusement of the elves to get some  shards. This can have a few level requirements like bounty hunter but  with respect to how skilled a player is. This might be a nice way to get  players into pvp without them in wildy. The shards should have another  use as well like trading into something you can sell in ge like the  grape seeds from tithe farm
---
Trading someone who is in a safe zone, while you are in a safe zone, doesn't make you stupid. Many people in the community make it out to be that way, but you had a very realistic expectation to not die in that situation. Unfortunately these tactics have been around a long time and who knows if or when they will ever be fully fixed. It's another reason pk'ing is near death and i can't even be mad about it.
---
Okay awesome, thank you both for the gear tips!

On your ironman it's decent, on your main don't do it for money
---
Vorok
---
Haha, grats!
---
Genuine question, why did you go for a Fury before an imbued bring or a whip?
---
I see a lot of people do this, and I genuinely don't understand why. A fury is only +2str on a glory, whereas a whip is +16str and +15atk, and a bring is +4, or +8 imbued.
---
As it should be. People can rebuild the way they deserve once they get cleaned.
---
Do the quest "Tears of Guthix" to unlock. Once a week, if you have gained 1QP or 100,000 total exp then you can revisit and gain xp. The amount of time you are allowed to spend in the room is based on total quest points.
---
Just remember, it's only a game and you don't need to be as efficient as possible.  
---
I personally got over your mentality after unlocking vorkath.  I should technically camp vork for 5 hours a day for easy money, then throw money at all of my skills.  You should technically do your herb and birdhouse runs then throw money at other skills (or those skills).  
---
There is a lot to do in the game, and honestly you're not in any rush.  If something gives less gp/xp per hr, but you enjoy the change of pace, that's time not wasted.
---
You can block yourself, it's called self-control.
---
I mean just quest to 42 def and don’t go higher
---
Why? They literally take 5 minutes at most and usually make at least 50k.
---
Grats dude
---
?.......  You realize you have to switch to robes to freeze and doing a 4 way switch into 1 tick barrage into another 4 way switch is beyond most people's capabilities?

I'm not doing that much melee atm, I will be getting a b ring eventually though its my next upgrade after slayer helm, I don't have a shit ton of disposable cash atm cuz this is my acc I do my series on, link there if u fancy having a look - https://youtu.be/_w2_MOp0134

Good. Cya. The majority of us in the pure/pvp community have been saying the g maul is way too broken, and overpowered. I was actually about to quit because of how fucking stupid the g maul is, and i have a lvl 85 ags pure. Get your g maul spec tabbing ass out of here.
---
On the base client heres my reccomendation.
---
1. Print screen
---
2. Open paint.
---
3. Ctrl + v
---
if you use Runelite there’s a feature for manual screenshots, and by default it automatically takes them when you level up, get good loot, so cool things
---
It’s a 50% drop. You either get it or you don’t.
---
Lucky cutlass has one gold gauntlet btw, but on the wrong hand
---
If you aren't, then surely the fury doesn't matter?
---
Occult would be better for magic, and a glory is just as good for ranged. Salve ei would be better than either for certain situations.
---
If you're short on cash, it seems a bit silly to me to tie 3m up in a fury.
---
I'll check out the video when I get a chance, good luck with the series!
---
I don't do slayer as often as a I would like to. So is it long for people who do a lot of slayer or is it actually long in general?
---

Did something happen to the hard clue scroll drop on the blue dragon table, i have killed about 900 without getting a hard clue.
---
If you don't have crafting cape and you don't have Fremmy elite done, you can do the following:
---
House tele -&gt; restore stats
---
Lunar Isle tele or house portal -&gt; Bank at far right banker (you can talk to him without seal of passage following Dream Mentor quest)
---
Talk to any other NPC on Lunar Isle to be teleported back to Rellekka 
---
You need a pool in your house and Lunar Isle portal to make this work, but it works very well until you do Fremmy Elite. Once you've got elites done you don't need Seal of Passage to talk to NPCs there, so this method stops working. But at that point you've got Fremmy boots 4 so you have free teles to Rellekka anyways.
---
Flicking mage on them is easy. I can usually do a whole task with just a sip or two from a prayer pot, if even.
---
I dont know why but when I use runelite my game become super laggy
---
I made an alt to skill for me on f2p. I couldn't even mine an iron ore anywhere I went. Maybe this is jagex's plan
---
Have a play with all the settings and try minimise the amount of stuff happening on the screen, if you stick with the vanilla client, ctrl+print screen will be your go to i think
---
thanks man
---
I'm great at being a loser, mom and dad say so all the time

how much gp does 99 get you
---
Welp this post is ruined
---
He sure is in great need of braces.
---
Can Thermy be given a Jar of Smoke drop? He is the only slayer boss in game to not have a jar drop.
---
That happened to me last week. Spent a couple hours at ardy knights so my tears wouldn't go to thieving, go do tears (thinking it's going to be rc xp), get mining instead...
---
So basically everyone? The reason why OSRS exist in the first place is because people wanted 2011 scape but Jagex "didn't" have the files saved so they polled OSRS instead, which passed. #KnowYourHistoryKiddo
---
Yes
---
Yeah it was bad but it had potential, so the rework will hopefully change that
---
How many gold pieces did you make?
---
I agree. Everything from 2008 up to 2011 was amazing
---
Thanks! I guess my perceptions about finding decent a group for ba would be a nightmare, was over exaggerated. I’ve been postponing doing kandarin elite diaries cause of it! Thanks for the insight
---
Yay smack downs! It’s so EPIC 😎 when the Jmods publicly shame their customers and encourage bullying on this subreddit. It’s also cool cool how they don’t have a proper outlet for customer support like every decent company in the world. The most awesome awesome how some smackdowns are incorrect and redacted but only after the player has been sufficiently harassed by twitter and Reddit neckbeards. Keep writing us funny poems Jagex!!!! 😂😂😂

What a dumb idea, doesn't even use Seerculls or Kraken Tentacles.

Looks really cool, what program do you use to make the map?
---
Spade 150gp      
---
Clue - 0gp     
---
Clue box - 0gp because destroyed    
---
Burning amulet (4) - 4k but can't sell on ge         
---
A couple sharks - 1600gp, optional       
---
Seed pod - 0gp      
---
3-4 home tele tabs - 1500-2kgp     
---
That's a 2150gp drop with amulet, 2 sharks, and the clue protected. 
---
Maybe 100k is the average loot of pk YouTubers that only post the good kills. With a clue box you cause the clue hunter to lose 100k but you don't gain anything from it. 
---
And of course people in mage arena that actually have runes and gear will have more worthwhile drops.
---
It's a flying spaghetti monster!

I've recently started doing barrows runs because i actually seem to enjoy it.  my account isn't the greatest but i can tank all of the brothers except dharok.  i have 60hp and just my luck every time i get him down he hits me for 60 and i'm fucked.  even with pray.  is there any way around him hitting that high, or is he just unbeatable for me until i get higher hp?  Should pray be reducing that or does he hit that through pray?  I can consistently get 5/6 brothers, so it's not the worst thing, but i wanna get em all.  I know my barrows runs aren't the most cost efficient at this point for my account, but it's fun so whatevs.
---
I think the original was an old myth that you had to talk to Oziach or you could never get a draconic visage drop. Especially as it used to be one of the most expensive drops in the game
---
Send me a DM with your username, and I’ll do some BA rounds with you sometime. I often help my friends and people from the ironman ccs get their torsos, so I’d be happy to help and show you the ropes.

obviously some of us know what he means because weve been there, but people who havent done agillity much or looked into marks of grace will assume that after 60 you get less marks in general, badly worded/false information should be corrected so newer players can actually learn

It doesn't though it uses the same mechanics that pvp does and no one pvps so why would you expect people to play lms all the sudden.

I only bring a spade, dds and clue anyway, getting PK'd on the way back is a free tele out of wilderness. Wilderness is a PVP zone, if you enter it, expect to get pk'd regardless of what you are carrying, as that is the whole point of the area. If you don't want to get pk'd, drop wilderness clues and stop crying.

&gt;Historically, the rank above a King was an "Emperor."
---
Except in the case of the British empire where the British monarch remained as King/Queen, but as ruler of India they were named Emperor/Empress, so in official documents, statues etc., they listed King/Queen before Emperor/Empress because being King/Queen of the United Kingdom was greater than being Emperor/Empress of India. (At least that's my simple understanding of it from what I remember)
---
Or maybe you can automate the whole process of making a bot, using it, and pump out an infinite number of them so Jagex can't keep up with it.
---
Would you be able to help me Stevew I’ve tried multiple appeals I’ve reached out on twitter and on reddit and I can’t even talk directly to someone from Jagex about how my account was banned for “botting” when I was training 5 different skills in one day to get ready for legends quest, I’ve also got 99 attack and strength on that account so you know I’ve put real time and effort into it. Please help me I’ve never bottled on that account and I can swear on my life that I haven’t I just need to be able to speak to someone to tell my side of the story since Jagex got rid of the ability to even appeal or write a statement which I think is totally unfair especially for people like me who didn’t do anything wrong and got their account they’ve had for years banned for no reason at all.

It has 50% more upvotes than the parent comment.... seems appropriately rated.

Yeah,  which is a huge difference.

Can't 1 hour mute someone for botting

Got bad news for you bud, you're not breaking 100k/hour in f2p. Can try smithing gold jewelry or fight the bots to telegrab wines of zammy. There are no good f2p money makers, full stop.
---
What are those legs?
---
This wouldn't stop the book lure because they're usually still inside the safe zone, theyre actually under you when they do the stall so trading them moves you 1 square west.
---
Hey did you ever find a cc? I am looking for something similar
---
&gt;its ***GRIEFING*** to attack someone in the wilderness?
---
&gt;...what part of making a super quick, free and 0 risk 200k-1m+...
---
Assuming the player isn't dumb, all you're doing is wasting a clue box and 5mins of time, to receive enough gp to maybe pay for the supercombat dose you sipped.
---
Why not hunt mage arena or boss pvmers or black chins that have guaranteed loot and are in the wilderness for long periods of time? Rather than someone that more likely than not has 0 risk? 
---
&gt;How did you get such a warped and inaccurate view of the wilderness and PvP?
---
Yes the wilderness is there for players to attack players. But it doesn't make it any less irritating when you have no risk and are only there for maybe 2 mins max and in that time some kid freezes you and starts running back and forth switching and speccing like he thinks he's Manked.
---
Why would possibly an optional pop-up message which you can turn off if you want hurt to implement? It's like people complaining about the 2-factor authenticator having a delay to turn it off being an option you can check if you like. Both are there to protect your account.  
---
I suggested this mainly to combat the stall bug. Since Jagex still haven't fixed some of the items used for stalling which I reported last year and there're definitely going to be more items coming to the game which are going to used for the stall bug again even if they fixed all the items lurers are using right now.  
---
On top of that:  
---
&gt; Like how do people think its a good idea or somehow not sketchy for some guy you have only known for a very short time ask you to come to a PvP world  
---
There're lurers and scammers who keeps this going on for weeks and makes you trust them through raiding and bossing with them and "anti-scamming" items like a zgs or something. Not just simply "Hey random dude I just met 2 minutes ago want to lure this guy I know for his arcane spirit shield?"
---
cuz clue hunters and wildy pvmers are the real brainlets
---
They realistically take 2 minutes for maybe 30k profit and some hunter xp. They might not end up being amazing gp/hr but for almost 0 effort your average player gets easy money over time and a bunch of hunter xp.they *are* good even if they're not efficient.
---
No, I have multiple accounts (like 6) and it's very easy to remember the e-mails. How many e-mail addresses do you have that you can't just try all of them with your password?

And why wouldn't you ask if you weren't sure? Asking on Reddit is easy.

Then your cock must look pretty sick!

I’m sure I could do that but it would probably be a lot easier if there was another way around going through EVERY SINGLE email

Also applies to f2p afking the greaters at the demonic ruins.

Congratulations! I always dreamed of completing Legends Quest when I was a child, too. Last month, I not only finished this quest, but also completed all other quests and obtained my quest cape. It was such an amazing and nostalgic feeling.

Good luck with the rest of the quest grind!

How have you read a ton of guides but don't even know what to pray?
---
Filthy, filthy ironmen. Those subhuman trash shouldn't be playing Old School.

Can people please stop using the "it has been in the game for years" argument, just because afking guthan was in for a long time doesn't mean they should not remove it.
---
not in raid 2
---
I wonder how much pvmers would cry about the old items kept on death rules having to actually risk something for pve now and how is would warp the economy and pve in general. More people would safe, less kill trips, maybe that would increase dropped item value, but maybe it would decrease the price of some things if people thought it wasn't worth the increased risk to bring them.
---
Hail satin
---
Not better than lavas at any point, but close at 99.
---
You need to swap to karil/black d hide top and tank legs instead of tank chest and karil legs.
---
Edit: Nvm i misread guthix as guthans
---
Smh the later waves it didn’t specify, I just needed clarification
---
yeah iv gotten to 94 just doing the highest herb runs, palm trees, calquat, mahogany, redwood and celeasta trees. and make quite a bit of money
---
Magic Wardrobe BTW
---
You can still use it to train, it's still pretty effective with runelite, you just can't bank them
---
Very good point
---
Oh yeah, I've come across some awesome people on this game still to this day. It's definitely not running rampant, but every now and then I see someone who goes out of their way to be a douchebag and it just makes me go "Why? Who hurt you?".
---
Why the fuck did you use your phone???
---
Yeah I was botting on w301 and it's crowded enough so hopefully none of the GP went to waste!  I like to think a new player picked it up and bought their first bond with it
---
yeah i got 40 farming in a couple days of doing trees and fruit trees
---
Your flair... "Voting no to all ezscape"
---
How cancerous lol. Forget logic or if it improves the game. You made up your mind no matter what it is. 
---
You the type of guy who would complain to the teacher if someone was still writing after time on the exam expired.  I guess I am making an assumption, and being an ass.
---
Either way what a shirt sighted perspective.
---
I hate when I forget to switch the vacuum off
---
I 2008 the d mace was Soo cool even the dds which is easier to get is better, I'ma range tank in pvp but I wouldn't mind the d mace getting a buff
---
I've been playing off and on since 05 and I had a max cape on rs3 when I switched over. I started osrs a few years late so there was a lot of new content I didn't know about and plenty of original methods I forgot about.
---
Kinda? You only reach 3t4g rates on smoke devils. Dusties and nechryals are still significantly slower, and all those are great tasks
---
idk why, but the 0-1 dds spec kills me
---
&gt; Assuming the player isn't dumb, all you're doing is wasting a clue box and 5mins of time, to receive enough gp to maybe pay for the supercombat dose you sipped.
---
The cost is irrelevant and incredibly minor, its not hard to kill someone in nothing and use less than 5k in supplies but thats not the point. When youre doing Bandos, you arent gaining money on every single kill you get because uniques are what make up all the profit...right? Its the same exact concept killing someone whose naked in the wilderness, except its much easier, takes less time and even less supplies are used. There is a chance youll get some good loot, and theres absolutely zero reason NOT to take that "chance".
---
Pkers arent out there sitting around calculating the cost of every single action they do.
---
&gt; Why not hunt mage arena or boss pvmers or black chins that have guaranteed loot and are in the wilderness for long periods of time? Rather than someone that more likely than not has 0 risk?
---
You seem to have this massive misconception that pkers are out SPECIFICALLY looking for random clue hunters...and im not sure why youd think people legitimately look for them. *The reality is*, you just run into them randomly when youre doing exactly what youre describing...looking for PvMers and traveling from spot to spot or looking for other PKers to fight. 
---
&gt; Yes the wilderness is there for players to attack players. But it doesn't make it any less irritating when you have no risk and are only there for maybe 2 mins max and in that time some kid freezes you and starts running back and forth switching and speccing like he thinks he's Manked.
---
So what exactly are you complaining about then? And how is it "griefing"? You have 2 options essentially: If you think its so irritating (even though its incredibly rare to even be killed doing a clue...ive legit never been killed in 200+ clues) and think its so unfair then simply dont do clues in the wilderness OR 2. Actually learn somewhat how to PvP and come prepared to do your clue with rag bolt gear/bulwark and brews so that you can most likely easily tank someone if they attack you. Or simply log out before they get in your range.
---
Getting so salty and complaining about something so insignificant and completely avoidable if you would just stop complaining is just super silly.
---
Addy is the best gp/dps wise. You can use rune, its quite a bit more expensive but since the caves don't last that long you should be fine. You'll end up spending maybe 500k-750k more. Don't expect massive dps increase though.
---
Worth it off task?
---
ironmen rise up, truly the most oppressed gamers
---
as opposed to who's words?
---
I can't reveal the method details I'm afraid, or it might get nerfed.  It's difficult to find highly profitable things to do in f2p with zero requirment accounts (ie 250k+/hr) so I don't want to ruin the one I have.  Correct assumption about lvl 3s
---
But wouldn't using magic whilst wearing melee armour be a bad idea?
---
yeah I've clocked myself and the fastest runs I could get including banking beforehand took me like 1 minute 10 seconds
---
Prayer mage and focus down rangers, unless you are able to safespot either of them. If you can get a ranger/mager stuck where it can't hit you, pray vs the one you can and kill it before moving on to the other.
---
You don't even need to go that far; just fucking deposit your bank after you're doing at GE. It doesn't change the fact people are still gonna lapse and forget.
---
The way to deal with it is to prosecute farms and bot creators
---
yeah but it comes with hunter exp
---
Free one from CtC1 looks so much better
---
Addy for everything except jad, swap to dragon darts while killing the orange lvl 360 (auto retal off, pray mage, buff up after)
---
Ah, ok. You called yourself a noob and I took that too literally I guess.
---
Lmao tattoos are personal, he got what he wants, I highly doubt anyone gives a shit about what you think about his style
---
yeah edge pking is cancer imo i never had any fun with it. But i did make an obby mauler and went out to mess around and got a tier7 and i am by no means a good pker.
---
Isn't mage in a bad spot dps wise right now? That it's better to pray range even if they mage while tribridding?
---
fucking DISGUSTING im pissed off about how this player has chosen to enjoy the game this guy has the literal SHITLORD stat trifecta what a fucking retard found on reddit he made a whole thread just for this dumb bullshit that doesnt mean anything psa obtaining the 99 shitlord trifecta IS NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY SORT IF U GOT 99 COOKING FLETCHING FIREMAKING DONT TELL MY ASS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I. DO. NOT. GIVE. A. SINGLE. FUCK. fuck
---
No problem! I still do it sometimes because I find it fun and exciting, not because it’s the best money per hour or anything.
---
Very true.  It's easier to stomach losing botted money than money I actually grinded for.
---
510 dry here.
---
But the fact that yourself or myself are "smart" enough to not miss the green cash stack in our inventory doesn't mean that the PKers shouldn't assume the lowest common denominator in all cases.
---
What are they gonna do, sit and think, "Mm.. Nah that guy probably didn't just happen to forget his cash stack. Maybe the next one?" You take the chance every time. I do 0 PVP, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles. And person could have forgotten their cash stack.
---
So then why are you so mad and salty(judging off your post and language used in it) over something so incredibly insignificant and rare? Youre in a PvP area, and you know it, thats the risk that the wilderness is associated with and its a core concept with Risk vs Reward. Youre essentially complaining that you should be entitled to be completely safe in the wilderness because you arent specifically there to PK, which is just dumb.
---
If it bothers you so much then simply dont do them, or come prepared to fight/tank should you get attacked...pretty simple. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with Jagex putting content in the wilderness to balance Risk vs Reward, nor is there with getting attacked in the wilderness.
---
Looks sick the neckbeards saying it looks shit haven't seen their toes in years
---
Just junk *sheds single tear*
---
&gt; why no DWH from the lizardmen shamans in raids
---
Because it's not on the drop table.
---
&gt; But you can get an onyx from Tekton
---
Because it's on his drop table.
---
Looking at his post history, this account is very clearly a troll account
---
Post mentioned that her bf left the account logged in, and OSRS is just basic point and click if you try to intentionally die. She could've also picked up small bits and pieces from watching him play for 3 years.
---
Could still very well be fake though
---
Yeah, fletching is 265k gp an hour for magic longbows. Don't hate on it.
---
Dude it's like literally thousands of bot makers vs the hand full of people that work at jagex
---
It's an insane arms race that is very hard for jagex to win. You have a bunch of basement dwellers and 3rd world countries making new scripts 24/7 where an account is free to make.
---
Believe it or not they ban a shit ton of bots, they just immediately make a new account for right back to it.
---
If you have a solution I'd love to hear it, but the bit situation is 10x better than it was in 2011
---
To annoy people like you :), ty
---
Community seems fine to me, albeit a bit whiny.
---
&gt; Can any of us say what is definitively common? Like it or not it's what I see more often here in Seattle, where many people are tattooed, so you won't be able to convince me otherwise without statistics.
---
Obviously..yeah? Whether something is common or not isnt subjective, its an objective thing by definition. There is going to be a larger amount of people doing one thing over another, one thing is always going to be more "rare". Its like saying the amount of people who drive a car vs drive a motorcycle ISNT objective, places with better weather and shit may have more people who do have motorcycles but the bottom line is objectively its far more common for people to drive a car.
---
I live very close to NYC and hve my entire life...I can no doubt say that FAR more people have cohesive sleeves and not just random tattoos scattered across their arm, I mean its not even close. And there are obviously tons of people with tattoos here, tons of great tattoo artists and a wide assortment of different types of people.
---
&gt; Why did you put so much effort into refuting an attempt to make someone else feel accepted?
---
Lmao what? Because I make a well articulated post that actually isnt some trolling autistic crap talking shit about a tattoo many people will probably think looks bad, and point out the flaws in your logic and points im "putting in so much effort"? It doesnt take much effort at all my guy lmao. Not trying to make someone feel less "accepted"...just pointing shit out.
---
Thank you!
---
1. You don't play this game anymore, how would you know how long it takes to get banned? Especially when you don't work for JaGeX (the only entity that knows the averages of how long it takes to identify and ban a bot) nor run a bot farm yourself.
---
2. Explain to me how my suicidal powerminer has been running since last week and is still not banned then?
---
3. Might want to quit RS then, because you can get muted and tempbanned for just closing the doors to annoy other players.
---
I still need to do the quests! Sounds like it’s worth it! Thanks for the motivation!!
---
The best f2p alt is one with 99 smithing to make rune items. That's my goal right now and bots will never affect this method since it is not a resource-gathering skill. If you're interested in having a serious f2p alt, you could definitely check that out.
---
Never seen that...
---
nice fucking meme
---
This is not for the people.who just get trashed in the wild. It's for pkers... Who pk other pkers... Who always risk anyway because the boosts.. It forces them to risk more to be a little.more safe.
---
Wait fr?

I'm 92.75 and I'm sitting here with 236qp, firecape, ds2, mm2 and rfd done (going for questpoint cape) and I swear to jesus as soon as I get 100 combat and western provinces hard done I'm immediately doing 99 cooking, fm, fletch and hunter. Cba to do another vorkath/barrows kc underneath 99 combat stats and none-welfare gear
---
Thank you very much, will do!

Back in the day I would just sit there and make profit off of low level characters dying from them.
---
If 100k new bots appear every week and even if they catch 99.9%, the amount of unbanned bots increase by 100 every week.  
---
It's probably impossible to achieve 100% detection rate when they can't just ban players unless they are absolutely sure they are botting...
---
That's exactly why I got one lol
---
This applies to most of the banks they use. Lumby, wintertodt, zeah, yanille, etc. They'd have to do multiple checks for that to work instead of just checking if the person you're trading is in a dangerous area, and it would likely be disruptive for people that are intentionally trading in dangerous areas. Plus yeah, engine work most likely. I don't think it'll happen.
---
Lol as if mod words arnt enough
---
You realize they're the ones banning people and running the game right?
---
Just recently started after hitting max melees, using 400m gear. Teams are a lot more forgiving of how bad I am due to my stats and gear.
---
For ironman, yes
---
I saw a video of a dude get lured for a scythe plus some items. This guy might be him?
---
179,000 bots were banned last week. These numbers are only slightly above average. And you think someone could manually ban them at the rates the automatic systems do?
---
I've been using void gear since combat 75.  Welfare as fuck
---
t. People insecure about their ugly tattoos
---
Seems scripted. The username checks out on the actual post.
---
Like I said, animation glitches of that magnitude should be fixed. But the idea that you put yourself in that situation where youre one step away from a dangerous area on a pvp world with your bank is separate from that, with any common sense you wouldnt be in any position for that animation glitch to be used in the first place.
---
To understand, you only have to compare it to PvM.  How many monsters did you slay for virtually worthless drops, just waiting for the one with the valuable drop?  So it is with Pkers.
---
They are worthwhile if you use money making methods to train.
---
Some people bring some gear in their inventory to switch and kill the aviansie/bandos agent thing, and a lot of them bring far more than what you listed. Go try killing clue hunters for a day and report back.
---
Youre doing so much amazing progress really quickly! Gratz!

It's stupidly easy to change ip

Lol like it's against the law or something. They're breaking a games rules now the law. Jagex cant do shit

Legends cape is much cheaper though, you would be insane to shell out 800k for +2 in defense stats
---
Sounds australian to me
---
FOUR steel dragons? That must've taken hours. Mad respect
---
Oh you mean the literally only one with group size designed like that? If you're sick of that street one piece of content like that, then there's an issue.
---
Regardless of the quality here or there (The feet are too small is my main issue), have you actually looked at RS3 recently?
---
I can understand criticism, but good lord this looks nothing like RS3.
---
O man this is awful
---
I think you can’t fail at most early courses so weight doesn’t matter
---
It's not a crazy thing to think, just no one cares why you think that.
---
Fury looks cooler and those miniscule +2 str type stats don’t change your dps by much at all. Keep the fury and get the bring next.
---
Plus you're doing God's work by mass producing the high alch item. By all means! Please keep making my nearly net neutral alchs!
---
its more logical for them to nerf the chaps/vambs than the body since they dont have a def req
---
Yup don’t don’t have to have your axe or pick axe equipped to use it to gather :)
---
Why do people buy bonds when gold sites are like 30% cheaper
---
Yeah man adding TB to f2P will totally ruin the game. Its not like it wont make a huge POSITIVE impact on F2P pking or anything, when its deader than dead at the moment. 
---
Its ironic because the same people who spite voted it from passing multiple times are the ones crying about it, even though it wouldnt even affect a vast majority of those people because virtually no one F2P pk's anyway that even do PvP let alone PvMers who hate PvP to begin with and dont do it. Basically, they did it to themselves by making virtually no PVP updates get passed for years and forcing Jagex's hand.

Okay, and what happens when you get tagged again and permed? Going to quietly sit there and say "whelp, it's for the good of the game." And restart that main you've worked on for hundreds of hours?

Yes, Zeah is very old school actually unlike HD. HD would make it new school. Zeah looks like it could've fit into the game back in the golden ages.
---
Just a sweep through on the f2p worlds that takes an hour and band a couple thousand bits would be worth it.
---
A long time ago, you could completely 100% afk guthan in nmz for 6 hours.
---
So the meta was that you just put yourself in NMZ when you went to bed for 6 hours of training every day.
---
Scroll books don't drop the scrolls when pked
---
The scrolls are shared across books so if you lose it you just buy another and it still has ur scrolls
---
So either your full of shit or someone had a bunch of scrolls on them for no reason.
---
Because handholding and babysitting is stupid as fuck, and these are legitimate tactics that keep the wilderness and pvp areas dangerous, and ensure you use your fucking brain before doing something.
---
It's one of those things that you recognize would be so damn convenient, but then once you actually have it, you **really** realize how absolutely convenient it is. Literally all I have built in mine is pool, ornate jewelry box, and Kourend/Lunar portals, and it has more than paid itself off in convenience and comfort. It's god damn awesome. I love it.

Glory is a nice purple, fury looks sorta nooby tho

finally decided to finish up the 99, have about 20ish hours left to do

50k per hour
---
If your def is only like 60 or 70 you get hit quite a bit with the torso/obby leg combo. It has like no defs
---
This is how I feel about fighter torso. Obby chest is one less strength bonus for like 1mil and you don’t have to do a shitty mini game grind.
---
Stop playing video games all day and go work! Even if it’s a minimum wage job, get your life in order before enjoying useless things. Not trying to be rude, but get off your ass and grind irl.
---
yes it's worth it. once you get the minigame down it doesn't take that long. you can grind it out in like an hour give or take based on rng. definitely helps to mark the tiles you need to run to in runelite.
---
&gt;Just because someone has a lot of cash doesn't mean they're gonna be nice.
---
yup I was just trying to help between this task I was doing for slayer. Completely unaware of the bullshit coming my way. Just thought being nice would make someones day. Guess not.
---
Except SD doesnt look like current RS3 at all? If you look up Runescape 2 HD vs SD on youtube you can clearly see SD is identical to current in game graphics. Yes some animations for SD are terrible but overall it's the same as current osrs graphics.
---
I also dont understand this whole "if you want better graphics play RS3" arguement. Like you said, these aren't the same games anymore so why would I play RS3 when I'm trying to play OSRS? The only thing people are suggesting is the added option for higher texture detail/shading. 
---
If your arguement was that you dont want Jagex wasting resources on improving graphical fidelity when there are other areas needing attention then I understand. But this mentality of "but muh nostalgia factor, keep shitty RS3 children out of muh OSRS gaem inb4 they ruin it with all their MTX" is moronic. You know how you keep MTX transactions out of OSRS? Increasing player base and people who play as members. Otherwise no corporate entity is going to be a dumbass and waste money keeping a game alive that doesnt generate new interest/revenue.
---
100%. I actually got my girlfriend to play, but she quit after quite a while in F2P, because she had to mine and it was impossible bc of bots. She tried for several days and finally gave up.

Idk. But so, would u say it's safe to assume the people commenting on the original post are essentially expecting the OP to do PvM looting for his 600k in 30mins?

I've tried this and would log out. Every now and then you will kill everything too fast and then auto-log if other monsters can't reach you in time.
---
it is actually him off his face big night deryck whibley
---
&gt; the problem can be solved by just using your brain 
---
That would be one way to put it, yes. 
---
The main issue is that they're luring players from a safe area into a dangerous PvP area. When you accept the trade from the chat, you don't know where the scammer is. If they run to a PvP area, which they always do, nothing stops you from running there. By the time you notice it you're being frozen and killed. 
---
There are also methods where they can push you into a PvP area, when they remain in the safe zone. All they need to do is stand at the edge and  move under you, if you accept you'll be pushed to the west into the PvP area. In this case OP's warning doesn't help, as they aren't in a PvP area.
---
&gt; why would you bother to do it in pvp world anyway?
---
You'll see people selling expensive items worth 15m for a cheap price like 6m. You're in a safe zone, so no risk, right? Your greed takes over and so you'll take your cash and trade them. Before you know it you moved into a PvP area 'by accident' and killed by a 'random PKer'.
---
There's almost always someone luring their victim into Lumbridge Castle in a PvP world and other areas. Just check it out some time.
---
They absolutely do drop, or at least did a few months ago and jiggleplex hotfixed it without saying anything
---
Are you joking?  You are such a fucking idiot.

I've learned a whole library of useful knowledge and fun trivia from video games than I ever learned from school, and I was a straight A's and B's student.

95% of grade school is next to worthless.

Most? I don't know about that. If most people were spade hunters there would be more PvP updates not a million PvE updates.

It's one the most useful skill in the game, it's well worth the investment

Thanks for the catch, edited the post.

facts, funny thing is I didn't want jack shit, just wanted to help. It's sad because I rarely do it anyways, thought it'd be nice to help someone for a change after others have helped me so much.

I usually have public off but the few times I don't the people I kill get mad and try to cuss me out or type racist things. I usually then report them as they head back to lumby.

The sequel we all secretly wanted. No more being called a noob, my man
---
You might need to be told the rules and how to play the game in order to have fun with it. You keep conflating someone who already understands how it works but doesn't know what to do vs someone who doesn't. It's like throwing a person who's never played a game of chess into a game of chess. Then when they don't like it you're like "too bad you didn't figure it out on your own!".
---
I can get through like 80k-90k xp worth per hour, not enough hours to use them. :(
---
Right. Wasn't designed for that either. The whole argument made on behalf of 3rd party clients that "it could be done before it was just more annoying, so the 3rd party client should be able to add it" doesn't hold water imo.
---
Yeah I thought the intent was to only let you get like 154 or whatever the max is for chiseling them and then go craft bloods.
---
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA RIP
---
I wouldn’t call it «amazing», but yeah the slight attention to detail is appreciatable
---
There’s a reason you see more bots killing cows than killing zulrah. Some bots get through detection, and I’m guessing that Jagex prioritizes newer accounts over older ones in bot detection (it’s less likely a 4 year old acc is botting than a 4 hour old one, statistically).
---
MFW purple is my favorite color
---
Pretty sure you can filter spells you don’t have the runes on you for which enlarges the other spells? Not 100% sure
---
LMAO
---
Because you can bank multiple copies, and then just turn in a load of books at once. It saves running around the place trying to find the one you need, when you can have many in your invent. It sped the exp/hr up by like 400%
---
You've been playing strictly F2P all this time? On mobile?
---
Filter your spells. Makes it bigger.
---
I can’t really tell what you’re saying? Are you saying JMods are lying about how many bots they ban?
---
I mean it's like 550 for this ep
---

Just unlock fossil island or do swamp crabs.  Better exp too
---
Well deserved, that's what you get for abusing an existing game mechanic that you know is questionable.
---
Especially with mobile now.

Self control mode
---
In the description for the section  **Prifddinas Agility Course** , it's mentioned at level 90 agility you can expect 56k per hour exp rates. In the poll question, it says 62k per hour at 90 agility. Which is it?

I tried blowpipe once and my damage felt horrible compared to standard melee whip/dds.

---
Crashing is not a bannable offense  
---
&gt; Is there any way to avoid this nonsense besides just giving up on one of the fastest grind spots in the game?  
---
Crabs is not even near the fastest grind spot in the game, its only afk
---
Unless you are very confident with tick praying just keep mage on. Mages can hit for 50+. Rangers only hit for up to 13.
---
Stacking enemies by sitting and waiting in the corners next to the safe rocks is the best way to go. You can deal with them one at a time and take minimal damage.
---
spoiler alert (forgot to put into title sorry)
---
Scout bots be watching you
---
the fuck
---
Half the reason to buy members is so you can bang out the limited-resource skills without insane competition. I tried to train WC on F2P and any willows spot I went to the bots would chop the tree down in mere seconds. I don't even want to think about how shitty mining is
---
It was the most frustrating thing in my life man. Died once because on of the mages spawned right on top of me and Hit me for high 40’s, died because my mouse dc’d somehow. Never again.
---
For me it was upgrading to Mage Arena 2 cape and Trident of the Swamp that really put me over the edge. I have a blowpipe and use god dhide, but I find that I do most of my damage with mage, so that's where I focused my upgrades. Now that I've got a torm bracelet I'm probably going to get an Anguish next.
---
Hookers and blow, got my gfs to spin my flax
---
You’re right it is. However, we basically are playing a 2007 version with a shit ton of reskinned items from 2008-2012 so the idea of adding an item that basically does the same thing as the old explorer rings from  2008-2012 is not that far fetched, no?
---
My point while being ineloquent was to say that with all of this talk about f2p I see no harm personally in adding a teleport that was from 2008 era to f2p, shit maybe even lock it behind some sort of beginner diary’s so f2p people better understand diaries when they get to members.
---
This suggestion falls in the category of reskinning. Items from the future into the past to pass a poll. I would have voted no to this years ago but the game is wayyyyy beyond the point of keeping any resemblance of 2007. So, why not it barely devalues anything worth while in members and adds a nice perk to f2p plus it was already in the game at one point.
---
That is not true. RS peaked with 250k+ players online in 2010.
---
If you don't need the 3 crab spawn, then find one of the dozens of 2 crab spawns?  3 and 4 crab spawns are more sought after, so if you can't kill a crab before another spawns, then you probably can't stop crashers.
---
There’s nothing questionable about it, it was made to give runecrafting xp, the real problem here is the runelite plugin throwing about 95% of the activity out the window
---
I guess it's just personal preference at that point :D
---
Personally like the torag's body more

Buy a cannon and be the bigger asshole. That's what I did when I was doing rock crabs. If someone came and crashed all mine or setup a cannon when there were people already there I just setup my cannon and waited for them to leave.

&gt; 9k value to a seed nest.
---
Only? 9k value a seed nest is 20-30k more gp per run. 2min run means it's 400-600k more gp an hour just from that.
---
&gt; "It will feature shortcuts that bypass small sections. However, the available shortcut will move each lap and will be different for every player. These shortcuts increase the maximum potential xp/hr at level 90 to 62k."
---
56k an hour using the default path. 62k an hour using the temporary shortcuts.
---
There are two main CCs theiving hosts and splashingworlds
---
seriously, a Google ReCaptcha would decrease automated account creations by a lot. that shit is pretty good against bots
---
No, earlier what people would do is just bank all of the books in advance (since the locations are fixed for a period of time and you can just world-hop to get multiple) and then turn them in later on in bulk. Since you don't have to keep looking for each new one, you could have saved a lot of time with the old method.
---
So this is definitely a nerf.
---
That is Deryck Whibley after a number of years of drug and alcohol abuse back in 2014ish. He is doing better now
---
Two hours for a torso or 15 minutes of saying “mom pleeeeease” before she hands over her credit card.
---
It took you 300 hours to collect all of these and it's only 80-90k/hr turning them in? That's roughly 28k/hr, are you a masochist?
---
Bondscaped 11m worth of grapes to get 99 cooking, my first 99, you cannot hurt me. I'm just happy to have one.

God damn why does jagex nerf shit like this when there are so many better ways they could spend their time
---
If i bringing 500m do I get a higher chance of a good drop?
---
I did wyrm task and farmrun. Also got crafting lvl for blue vambs for hard clue and completed that.
---
hekkin woosh
---
Because most courses don’t have that much running
---
Would it be worth it do them off slayer task?
---
Slayer and combat will make you money and most people generally enjoy them. I enjoy agility and farming, but I’m a masochist.
---
*I said yep, what a concept*
---
Yes but when are you fighting something so difficult that it requires the absolute max boost without using brews?  Because if you brew once in that 5 minutes you have to repot anyway and if u have to repot within the 5 minutes then a regular potion is the same and would be shareable via pot share.
---
Or the UK
---
I was scared of getting the torso too but you really just have to git gud. It literally will take at most 2 hours and the minigame is honestly really fun and easy lol. Plus the torso is pretty much BIS if you don't have 14 mil to throw away. Don't be afraid, it's not bad at all.
---
Well I also tried it at the gnome agility course and I lost energy.
---
Until halsey logs in your world with his crew.
---
You're on a subreddit where people complain about the placement of trees and bushes because it makes their walking paths un-optimal.
---
Thanks insured that bad boyy
---
&gt; No way an actual player is doing that shit and if so the rate is very very low.
---
Probably some noob ironmen. But if it's actually the case that no players at all do it, the solution is to remove that option in pvp worlds, not throw money at wages for people to manually do it.
---
People usually just shit on fire max cause it’s ugly
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide
---
What did you cook?
---
How much do you make getting to 99?
---
Lmao yes because it’s a thing means people don’t get banned. Must be why botting is a thing too they never ban those bots!
---
Man it's not that easy
---
Lol cloud never got a rare drop, it's just another false memory
---
Alch on agility and farming runs my dude
---
tbh it sounds like something I (and probably quite a lot of people) would say as a joke. I doubt any action can be made against this.
---
Where can you AFK on fossil island?
---
Yup. Everything you can think of my dude.
---
I dont think its gonna effect the ge price of the explorers ring by much
---
Yeah im not gunna sit and argue with someone over the game, but I always like to let people know if there's a better way to do something.
---
They can keep doing what they're doing, I don't mind, as long as theyre doing it out of choice and not ignorance.
---
Training slayer will be the best investment for your account. You'll make a lot of gp in the long run and it trains your combat stats so you can take on stronger bosses later to make even more gp.
---
No I'm quitting man. But thanks for the words :)
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
Hyahyahyahyahya wow!
---
Yep I hear ya.  You can try also doing fossil island for ammonite crabs.  There are like 3 or 4 3 crab spawns (100hp ea) so nobody cares for the 2 crab spawns.  Definitely recommend if you don't want to worry about crashers
---
79 agility here and still dont have full graceful. I did to like 75 before rooftops were a thing. I dont even want to go for it at this point.
---
Yup. Fuck ba.
---
Yeah I was joking and if jagex looks into my ACC over it they'll see I never even used ahk let alone botted on it so I'll be fine :p
---
slay good
---
Depends. If you wanna put the time in to cutting all those logs vs making darts in like a faction of the time and make money doing something else like vork where you make 10x amount but i do a lot of things in game just because its afk so its just preference.
---
On average bots are banned within 24 hours
---
It's almost like those items don't impact them at all
---
All the big f2p worlds always have a bunch of retards at the GE wearing fucking bcp, tassets, prims with a combat bracelet and an obby cape and a garbage total level.  Its like they’re tired of getting made fun of on members worlds and wanna flex on some people wearing green d hide and rune.
---
god id fuck him
---
It depends. If it's something meaningful such as a no pillar Inferno or a world record ToB speed run, then yeah I upvote it. If it's a worthless "achievement" such as a first time fire cape, they can fuck off lol. That shit deserves to be downvoted.
---
About 15mil.
---
Yeah that wouldve killed the playerbase 10 years ago, there's not many kids playing anymore.
---
january 2018 actually
---
Slayer is a good call, train the rest of your combat stats up so you can make real money later as well as making a bit on the journey. Plenty of variety and options too, so you can do whatever you feel like in the later levels (Just wanna AFK? There's a way to do that for most tasks. Wanna do some bossing? Lots of tasks have boss variants (Greater demons  --&gt; Zammy GWD, Dagannoths --&gt; DK's, Kalaphites --&gt; KQ, etc.). Wanna be super efficient in slayer XP? Most tasks have a way for you to do that, etc)
---
Hunter is another good call, doing 73-99 at black chinchompas is the best xp/h you can get in hunter and will make you a nice 100m+ profit... Can't see it being boring either since you'd constantly have to watch out for PKers.
---
For something more chill, hunter + farming are a good combo. Herb + birdhouse runs will make you more than enough profit in the low/mid levels to afford all the necessities (Whip, blowpipe, some pocket money to train skills, etc.) and are very low effort (&lt; 10 minutes every hour or two). Birdhouses in particular are also really good hunter XP for the time you actually spend doing the run (not counting the time waiting) so there's that as well.
---
Trash idea
---
Runecrafting. So much fun.
---
No, you can bank as many as you want, can just only have 1 of each in your inventory when attempting to take more from the bookshelves.
---
People use Imp boxes to bank the books as they get them though, letting you bank around 50 per trip without a lot of running, instead of 15 with a lot of running.
---
I've had the level for the altar for _months_ but haven't been able to get my hands on that stupid sceptre (btw).  So many hours at PP so far.
---
Train slayer.
---
Can we get an update post showing how many you end up getting to use?
---
M E T A  
---
E  
---
T  
---
A
---
But why no d scimmy
---
I think the reward for the highest tier could even be a free 7 day bond or something.
---
turning them in is like 240k xp/h but still yeah no where near enough time
---
They’re alright with DHCB but wouldn’t recommend elsewise
---
He forgot to get 43 prayer before going to school.
---
Yeah ignore them, I never runecrafted one rune and I got 60 on my ironman lol. Just do what you want. My first big goal was morytania hard so I can do barrows asap and barrow gloves
---
I'm not actually an Ironman either, just enjoy the method, lol.
---
crabs
---
Yeah I don't get the all the hate for hunter. It's one of my highest skills
---
The correct term you’re looking for is police dispatch
---
No, not like that. Every account that was made 10 minutes ago with a randomly generated name that got jugs traded to it and automatically started to fill them is 99.9999% a bot. The 1/1M that isn’t and gets banned is healthier for the game than letting 999,999 bots farm gold for longer.
---
Super late on this but **why not just add Artisan?** Artisan sounds like the perfect way to introduce skills and areas on the map to a new player in the form of a skill. Getting tasks from NPCs are already popular (see Slayer and Farming Contracts) and I've seen a bit of talk of revisiting Artisan as a new skill anyway. Maybe in the next week I'll write a bigger separate post on why it would be a solution increasing retention rate on players but I have exams soon
---
Ok set up key bindings for each of those spots also? Then just run to the start of the course yourself to restart? I haven't tried it but most courses are short enough you should be able to hot key all the obstacles I think
---
Bush is a true American hero, how disrespectful can you be?

Stun alched 76-91 on mobile. Got to a point where muscle memory took over and I just watched tv. Left thumb right thumb repeat.
---
Yeah, someone mentioned that below.  I am glad it will help somewhere.  Makes me feel better about it.
---
tipoff@jagex.com  I think helps
---
send the info to that email hopefully they can forward what ever info they can to the local police
---
Cool story bro, completely random, uncalled for, and off topic but glad you got to type out your feelings for a minute
---
when you're at jad I don't think it matters about safespotting anymore apart from at the beginning if you wanna brew up/restore etc, I just stood in the middle blowpiping him, you definitely want the venom killing him too
---
Guess I missed that one lol
---
It's waluigi's nose and moustache
---
It's not worth it to take 100 bronze knives from a bank? It takes 2 seconds to do that
---
I appreciate that. I don’t have anything online set up to sell prints yet but I do send prints on request when people are interested. If you have a printer at home, feel free
---
An offhand is still an offhand regardless what its for. Its a bis item for sure but the limited pvm use def effects the price and how often its used.
---
I don't even blame people falling for this. The ad and the landing page look so legit. The URL, the logos, all straight copy pasted from jagex so it looks so official and trustworthy.
---
Real talk. Dark bow with dragon arrows. EZPZ.
---
They won't rise even if he does have a collection, markets too saturated, I got 100s from slayer I just haven't sold yet
---
First time I cried playing this game was when I was killing dust devils and my dad told me he was leaving.
---
I’ve tried getting him on Italy rock so the healers spawn behind him and get stuck behind him so I don’t have to tank them.
---
I don't see what part of that benefits from manual banning
---
Big fucking rip. This is what I was going to get started on this weekend....
---
I'm not sure if the KotS winner (who was originally banned then had his win reinstated, if anyone missed that saga) came up with the method that involves hunter xp and imp boxes. AFAIK he just figured out the algorithm for the book spawns. Woox optimized it (again, AFAIK).
---
This nerf probably took like 5 minutes to implement. Not arguing one way or the other if it's the right choice, but this doesn't seem like a proper use of the "waste of time" argument
---
Straight us assholes IRL
---
Can you not use them?
---
What a bullshit update. Sorry for your loss, they keep pushing "fixes" like this. They could at least give 3 weeks notice so you can use up any banked books.
---
Collecting books from a library is not interesting game design
---
I don't see the big deal with the seeds
---
It's one tree that takes awhile to grow. It's very very similar to calquat. You can only plant 1 which makes up for the fact that it's so cheap
---
It's basically just more boring PVM. You're just killing monsters for the slightest chance at bank, with the only difference being that Clue Hunters will never be able to fight back and won't even try.
---
Grindr...
---
What about ranging potions?
---
You identified the true struggle, no yellow beads.
---
Literally everyone.
---
I’ve been there myself, no idea how I forgot that detail
---
Mage is weak.....so instead of buffing it we nerf ONE set of ranged armor? So we dont nerf ranged over all just a set of armour. Nerf. Not buff. :thinking:
---
&gt; I’ll still do the skills as a form of appreciating the nature of it
---
Slayer and to a degree Farming are the only ones with dynamic "nature" to it that can be explored
---
For the most part skilling is either about getting the achievement, getting unlocks, or getting materials. Runescape is hardly enjoyable for the most part. Very boring. It's not so much a theme park of activities, and more like series of interesting goals with various ways to do things "efficiently". The goals themselves and what order you do them in CAN be interesting though... Combat on ironman for instance is very very dynamic that brings you to all corners of the map and delving into a lot of skills for unlocks.
---
I'm about a week away from my Max Fire Cape and I honestly just want it for the banter. I find it funny. I'll start working on Inferno after max but until I beat it I'll enjoy the insults.
---
Maybe if crystal bow was equal to blowpipe or armadyl crossbow
---
But it's more akin to a tent whip that uses shards to charge instead of a whip
---
The size of the spell isn’t the issue. 
---
The spell-book is on the left side of your screen whereas the inventory where you’re trying to alch on the right side. 
---
This is what makes it annoying. It doesn’t bother me, but then again, I have yet to try alching on mobile.
---
This is what happens when someones name has been removed (due to it being judged offensive or against the rules etc).
---
That's not how profit and loss work. Obviously you get to play as you want, but by getting 99 wc you've banked X gp worth of logs. Then if you decide to fletch X gp worth of logs it doesnt matter how you got the gp (as a non-iron, obviously), you just happened to acquire the capital required by cutting logs. Same works with alchs
---
Hands hurting? It's less intense than playing most other video games casually.
---
You can't really do much on the side while doing "agility, clues, quests, and farm runs" anyway, unless you have a secondary account. So why not? It's well worth it for the profits alone. I still do it at almost 30m xp.
---
Took 4 attempts on ds2 so yeah probably
---
Honestly forgot about that haha, prob would have been better
---
Right? Why so disporportional?
---
is this real? if it is, i wouldn't even be mad. just call customer support and keep chatting with that bot
---
Wait 20 seconds it’ll let you again
---
This is nothing new. This was used frequently with korasi to double spec.
---
Nice one!
---
It was good for ironmen pre 77 I think because they didnt have to do zulrah / slayer / TT for essence. What I'm saying though is that it doesn't matter if its good. It provided variety in one of the most blandly designed skills in the game, and instead of just nerfing the xp rates, they nerfed a big reason why this method felt so mechanically different from other rc methods.
---
It seems to me that there is an effort to get rid of more unusual training methods in favor of streamlining the levelling process, when, imo, the messiness of osrs, and the varied methods to get to the same end goal are exactly what makes it fun.
---
This post alone isnt what worries me, its things like this combined with the "new player experience" (a phrase which has nearly always meant pandering to the lowest common denominator), and talk surrounding a priffindas diary where low tier steps either don't matter, or have higher reqs than their counterparts makes me think that jagex' focus may be on "streamlining" the journey to "endgame" when the biggest reason to play osrs over any other mmorpg is **because** the journey to endgame is so fun.
---
You have two thumbs, that's why they did that. Easier than hitting spell book/inventory tab constantly. It's really not hard
---
Yes and that's what made it questionable, it wasn't designed as a legitimate training method
---
I understood that reference!
---
I’m sure it’s not the best method, but I’ve been making Falador Tabs and been getting 55k xp/hour. Not sure the profit since I’m using a demon butler, but I don’t really care. I just like that it’s afk, and I am a pure so avoiding HP is kinda nice.
---
False and also moving the goal post, terrible argument
---
Check Guildmaster Jane's page. Each contract gives a different Tier seed pack. Essentially, the longer and harder contracts give a higher Tier.
---
Honestly, the bots make the game feel less lonely In f2p :/
---
I thought it prevented you from logging in until you changed it. It happened to me when I was digging up old accounts to use as alts that didn’t have email logins.
---
I've decided to max with cooking just for the irony. Are you doing the same with firemaking?
---
whats crazy is that the other shit would kill you before the chaos ele does. don't you have to go past the demi-bosses to get to 50+ anyway? (assuming ur a noob and not using teles)
---
Must've been some hella good substances if you thought this would be a good post
---
This OSRS user uses one weird trick involving comic sans and a reddit suggestion to make millions... GE Merchers hate him!
---
Or just remember what world you're on when you do dangerous stuff. Many of us learn the hard way however
---
Thanks for the heads up. I will be sure to double check.
---
Pk bad
---
Yeah you just use the item on them instead of trading it.
---
I’m also curious, why do you feel that way?
---
And at 99 rcing and hunter, it doesn't even beat lavas and it takes 10x as many brain cells.
---
&gt; 20k exp is 10 minutes at black salamanders, what the actual fuck are you talking about?
---
When did I say otherwise? ...
---
&gt;Besides...
---
okay, thats fine? i literally said you do you. I'm just helping other people that read by showing them the alternative, chill out auty
---
"I can't beat this boss so the game is terrible"
---
Remember what I use to pm you all the time? :)
---
Shitty member Ironman here: still rocking green dhide and rune thank you very much
---
I remember when gmauls were in the 1.2m range whips 8-10m. Shit was the wild wild west.
---
Falador. I just hit 61, but I need 70. I haven't touched agility in 3 weeks though.
---
assuming lvl 1 slayer and no ranging, just toss on a whip and an anti dragon fire shield and go kill some blue drags in taverly dungeon.
---
Nice, you smoke weed nice
---
This pet is so ugly tbh
---
Trying to hit gc in rocket league while I afk nmz or slayer
---
Tag your spoilers ass hole
---
L
---
Ah I must have missed it somewhere
---
hey look, another integrity update made after a youtube idiot gives his opinion.  Might as well remove polls and just ask youtube what updates should be brought into the game, they know best.
---
Or kill chaos druids
---
It was slightly more xp than lava runes)(73k/hr), but cost almost nothing and you get 30k hunter xp/hr on top of it (according to the video Woox made on it)
---
What? Do you think having the highest slash defense makes it best in slot for anything?
---
SMOrc. Olm is a cutie.
---
If you look at the poll that happened after results were hidden you'd know that it did not affect it. There weren't more votes cast than normal. It's very clear that people who voted, voted regardless and people who don't vote didn't bother just because of the poll. 
---
Biases are inherent. You think jagex doesn't have biases themselves? The problem is that this game has always been updated based on polls, and jagex has increasingly been putting out updates they deem to be "integrity", completely bypassing the polls.
---
Eh why? Lmao Jagex are quick at fixing shit that doesn't need fixing, but shit that need's fixing takes 18 months.
---
(Konar is female)
---
Yea. Even if you don't have one with charges at the moment it's totally worth it to blow points on it. Part of the hard Mort diary too iirc.
---
Nice hooters
---
This is spot on, especially the point about researching before you do it and to look for players in void + magic shortbow or penance.
---
Of course. Do my clues or... well, bad things will happen.
---
You have a brown stain on your nose
---
No worries. I think it’s pretty clear that this method was too good for ironmen and it’s sad to see that people seem to think Jagex taking time to deal with it is a waste of time
---
Yikes dude
---
its slower then lava runes, how exactly is is broken?
---
20k hunter exp once every run every 45 minutes caps out- you can get like 80k hunter exp at black salamanders in that meantime.
---
Maybe if you stack the hunter exp and get back with burning amulet it's easy, but idk.
---
It makes it best in slot for the highest slash defense, among other things, yes.   
---
To remind you
---
\&gt;It’s not bis if it doesn’t give the best possible stats. That’s what bis means 
---
Slash defense is a stat.
---
What are you even doing man quit embarassing yourself youve already shown that youre arguing about a fine point even you dont agree with subconsciously
---
He's right you know
---
Absolutely stunned that they're still pushing this sword. They fixed absolutely nothing about it, stab is useless, no one gives a fuck if it can't stab because people would just use Lance anyway. I guess they really do hate the rapier. I'll be voting no to it. Maybe if it was a none degrading addon to the rapier to make it a slash weapon I would agree, as that would actually help the rapier have some uses (although this is just a round about way of nerfing ToB boss stab defence).
---
Legit feel like they didn't take on any of the feedback from the last thread, what was the point asking if you won't acknowledge any of the balancing issues? No crystal armour fix, no blade fix, still pushing to increase farm run length, making us kill elves for teleports crystals, etc etc.
---
Okay, just seen you're on like 24k clues now, fuck no I'm not overtaking you lmao
---
Satchel part isn't a boss so not sure why you're quoting me. I don't mind difficult bosses. DS2 is an example of a well designed quest and bosses.
---
MM2 is an example of a quest that is intentionally designed to be obnoxious.
---
Ahh yes I believe you are correct
---
About highest stats = BIS?
---
Yep.  Lets see how long it takes him to catch up to his subconscious though.
---
They're not overloads they're a QOL potion at best. Combat QOL upgrades are the only kind of things that skilling should gate. This wouldn't even come close to the perks of say construction.
---
Inb4 Increases Gmaul spec to 65%
---
a mage should never beat a ranger, so it seems balanced to me.
---
Barraging is the most "efficient" way to train magic, as well as imbuing
---
formuLa you say? let me see that!
---
fixed it
---
Because black d'hide is beyond OP.... Go look at the stats and compare it with t70 karils. It's literally better in terms of defense barring magic defense. 
---
Even then, It's mage def bonus is far too high, it definitely needs a nerf.
---
Blessed dhide for pures didn't do too well in polls so if assume the same would happen
---
Didn't help how badly jiggleflex worded the last poll question to give the chaps a +1 prayer bonus;/
---
Thanks for giving credit!
---
Interesting. I always thought it was most efficient to do strength first once you’ve hit 70s. Then switch to attack, then defense. I don’t really care too much about playing EfficiencyScape but I’d avoided the whip because using shared didn’t make sense. I guess the increased str bonus makes for more efficient slayer xp though. 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; dumb and dumber
---
for a sec there thought u were referencing game of thrones writers lol
---
they wont risk more, there is a reason why they use welfare robes now instead of ahrims and ancestral.
---
Well then no one would wear full helms
---
They fix shit like this because it hurts the ironman meta..
---
But leave the fucking blast furnace shop untouched completely.
---
One is a niche method of training a skill, the other IS THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE TRAIN THE SKILL
---
but this isnt just one, they did trading at zmi after a few comments and they did brimestone key nerf after a comment by a youtuber.  At what point do you stop making changes off of opinions of just a few vocal minority players of the game?
---
&gt;Either fix it immediately when it's discovered or don't fix it at all
---
I disagree, your suggesting positive changes shouldn't be made because it's unfair to those who previously participated / or were unable too.
---
Really banking on some focus on PvP atm. It needs it so bad.
---
I'm a 1240 total RN.  Is it worth using those worlds?
---
No links, but what kind of words get it removed?
---
get fuckin baited b
---
I'd say the old rates seem more disproportionate. 10K/60K/85K isn't as smooth of a progression as 10K/37K/84K. But it is a pretty steep drop for Meds.
---
I have to stand in lines to pay for food...
---
trying to click the rooftop hitboxes on mobile is a huge pain compared to how afk it is on runelite.
---
You aren’t getting seeds in your nests? Nests alone are worth 3k each
---
No...
---
I find that 1 portal frame room and 1 portal nexus is more than enough.
---
Portal frames for troll stronghold, catherby and grand exchange teleports, portal nexus with 8 teleports I'm actually going to use seeing as kourend and fishing guild are worthless.
---
No real point going for full portal nexus unless you really have money burning a hole in your pocket imo
---
if you cant finish a task in 1 trip with sang i dont know what to say.

Jumped to f2p ge with infernal on. Got asked a million times what cape I had on lol
---
Between this and the proposed integrity change to prevent imp boxes from working in the wilderness, Jagex really wants to kneecap that item.
---
Accurate representation of this sub
---
Oh lol that sucks, could you switch the words around so I can find it
---
r/woooosh
---
You’re already playing like herblore and RC don’t exist.
---
I do like Discord, however its just not the same as forums/reddit.
---
What the fuck is this
---
In my opinion, yes. You largely avoid RWT website spam at the GE, bots, and begging. You can of course still find all of these things on this world on occasion but dramatically less so. They're also somewhat less crowded in general.
---
My tears always go into agility
---
Drink anti-poison before you start, use mele, pray mage, kill the blossom things when they open, when you get snared, spam click the square next to you. Rest is just DPSing down the main tree. Not much else to it.
---
I said in the post that im comfortable with 8 way switch lol
---
Or complete zeah diary yo to hard for an unreadable one
---
Hmm, might be due to my hunter level. I have gotten maybe 2 nests in 20 runs so I haven't done too much either.
---

thanks!
---
Can't argue with that logic.
---
Got my torso yesterday and enjoyed it so much maybe I'll go for the pet
---
Or just burst slayer tasks. You make money on nechs and dust devils.
---
U prolly got a fire cape and dont know what its like
---
I agree with you btw, I was being sarcastic.
---
Almost all EHP methods fall into the category of being the meta but being cancer to do.
---
Edit: for those who haven’t noticed I posted this because of my slayer and farming ranks
---
Why does he look like a jojo character?
---
Me and swamp boy are really good friends, we help each other with certain aspects of production whenever we can, and he suggested the entire By Release concept. He’s played a huge role in the series and he’s revolutionized content across the community.
---
I’ll stand by Swamp kid here.
---
Implying Soup's quest guides can be considered "accurate"
---
If you click the skill icons for your combat stats you can see what gear unlocks at what level :) good luck!
---
I'm not even an Ironman, just enjoyed this as it was a bit different. :(
---
Yikes dude I feel so bad for you lol
---
So you admit it's bis somewhere.
---
Jk I know dfs is pretty much useless nowadays
---
Still no major changes to crystal armor and it's just as strong as black d'hide while it degrades and you can't buy it. Definitely voting no to that. Why even release it lol.
---
Good to know. I'm on 81 Range right now but I'm in an endless cycle of procrastination. 
---
* "The demonic gorillas will be easier if I can get a black demon task!" 
---
* "Oh, a Kalphite task. Well, that's good slayer XP, I'll just do it." 
---
* "Hmm, I'm close to another Ranged level. One more task."
---
* "Sweet, another Ranged level. Oh wow, that next Hitpoint isn't far away."
---
* "This task should make a few bucks, I'll take care of it too."
---
* "The demonic gorillas will be easier if I can get that black demon task!"  
---
And so on. 
---
That video clears things up nicely though. I'd seen some crazy numbers about how that magic "pull you in" attack can hit 66 and he can smack another hit through prayer after that, but it doesn't look that bad in the video. 
---
I'll bring my broke-ass ranged gear and see how I do. With higher-than-average defense and magic he probably (?) won't immediately wipe the floor with me, and I'm not too proud to whittle him down like that from a distance if that's what it takes.
---
rotating the camera while trying to click is significantly more tedious on a phone than on a pc &amp; runelite is really helpful to agility from what I've heard and phones don't have access to that
---
I'm not sure what exactly, possibly keywords that indicate your post might be against the subreddit rules among other things.
---
Maybe tell me in pm what your post is about so I can tell you what it might be
---
Little update, went with the recommendations of selling my tassets and getting primordials along with obsidian platelegs. Got the blessing too, ofcourse.
---
 Ill still have to figure out how to effectively do nmz to get the points to imbue the helmet and ring though im sure ill figure it out.
---
Some people recommended me to do other things like barrages etc but Im trying to play more casual as usually when I do slayer I multilog to do skilling on my ironman aswell.
---
Thank you guys a lot for the good advice!
---
J mod slap-up?
---
Fuck that, guthan method almost ruined the game, just because new players cant get free 99s in combat stats doesn't mean i rather have the game be broken forever.
---
You gotta drop it before you die.
---
I did it with (if I recall correctly):
---
Splitbark helm, Mystic top, Mystic bottom, Ancient staff, Zaros Book complete, Infinity Boots, Mage Arena cape, Fury
---
So you’re saying I should whore my pixelated self out 🤔 hmm
---
*spell filters want to know your location*
---
well, congrats on that and goodluck on your future endeavors
---
Thank God for my luck.
---
Bronze to dragon in under 1500 tokens.

Just wait until the seventy-level Hunter grind begins with only swamp lizards to catch. I don't think he has a way to boost Hunter and needs to 99 it before he can even *attempt* to catch Lucky Implings, those one-in-a-hundred spawns who have some ridiculously tiny chance to give him the crossbow he needs. 
---
Jagex will probably add Crossbow strings to a drop table or a spinning wheel to Morytania before he manages to catch that damn crossbow barehand.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Armour/Magic_armour
---
Just do PvM no need to skill anymore.
---
Then you would agree that it doesn't really matter if Jagex patches it out, yes?
---
If you dced....
---
Black d'hide is the main culprit for why magic is weak for at least mages. I do agree that the root cause should be addressed (i.e. tweaking the way magic splashes). It is far too inaccurate.
---
I PK with 100+ magic bonus (literally max bonus possible with mystics I even wear ahrim hood), and the amount of splashes I get against random rag D hides is absurd. D hide is t40 btw, not t70. It's t70 in terms of offence.
---
No other armour that is t40 is this powerful. Mage armour has 0 defences, rune armour has melee and range defences, at the cost of having negative magic bonus and negative range and magic offence bonus.
---
Black d'hide is the perfect hybrid armour, providing no negative defence bonuses (with absurdly high magic bonus for it's cost) and only has negative magic in terms of offence.
---
It's absurdly broken.
---
no one gives a shit about fucking untrimmed capes
---
Why does it look like an angry dog
---
100%. You could make bank.
---
Those are pretty reasonable rates for the average person doing those methods. If anything I think the lava rate is a bit high. Most people are not tick-perfect.
---
So you just need a plus 2 or 3 construction boost and a super restore (in case stew tanks your farming) and a garden pie to do this
---
check out @Poke_Scape on twitter. it's coming.
---
So why can I not login into my account? I've tried runelite, the official client, and mobile. I can login to the site with my email and password. But as soon as I try in the client I put in the authenticator number and then it says invalid credentials. I saw on the osrs website that they were having google login issues but that was 20 days ago or so. So I figured I would disable authenticator and try that. Well there's one problem, I don't get emails from jagex. I have tried multiple times throughout the last couple weeks and I never receive emails from them. And yes I have checked my spam. Any help would be appreciated considering I have no way of contacting jagex through email.
---
DANDIE
---
Not really relevant to the discussion but I really appreciate how communicative they’ve been with the community in hearing our concerns and being open to suggestions
---
Kind of like the Canoe? Sure, why not.
---
The difference beint those are npc and not actual people behind computers.
---
Also you have reliable respawns and a decent reward. That one player with 2m on them is LTERALLY one in a million, so odds are you wasted 30 hours and multiple deaths of your own just for the chance at someones 600 house tabs
---
I recommend using dwh or bgs at the beginning of a kill if possible.
---
world 330 and 331 or the other house party worlds are objectively the best to play the game for most players who don't have construction at a decent level btw.
---
Ironman btw
---
At that point, I stop feeling bad for people who get scammed.
---
Why didn't he just put on protect from melee lmao noob
---
Will no one think of the fullhelms??
---
Post 3 months after this gets implemented: "petition to add def bonus to fullhelm so they're actually useful"
---
The Congo dandies
---
Haha I realized that too while I was making this didn't know if it was just me or if other people saw it too
---
What is the est. 2002 on the sweatshirt alluding to then?
---
rest in rip in peace
---
Why do you guys keep insisting on making the Blade of Saeldor's whip speed instead of buffing its stats and making it a tick slower. It would be much more interesting as a weapon and would have a different use from all the other high tier melee weapons of similar speed (rapier, reg whip, tent whip, bludgeon, z hasta, Sotd, abby dagger).
---
i mean you live on reddit, how many posts did you see on here about it before woox gave his opinion... I can tell you it wasnt brought up on twitter... So to say the community wants it to change, can you show any physical proof that that is true?  Or are you just assuming?
---
Then it's 1/1
---
It happens AND it doesn't.
---
i think you pissed jagex off and they saw you had the books
---
You can use the bank to un-note for free though
---
No. They are making a balance change for ironmen. They did not intend this method to be so much better than the previous ironman rc meta. Normally people would want new meta skilling methods to be polled and this wasnt.
---
Everyone has a bias. What do you think an opinion is?
---
whys it gotta be black people?
---
Looks hawt though
---
Yes.
---
1. 3 buttons at top right

2. settings

Could be. Obby armor and weapons are good, it’s only the cape that’s nooby lol
---
It's the year that the logo was born relative to the time period I was in during the series, but I might change the design to "2001" as that was technically the birth year of the questing timeline in By Release.
---
Because we totally dont have enough 2.4 second high tier melee weapons (rapier, reg whip, tent whip, bludgeon, z hasta, Sotd, abby dagger, blessed ss and regular ss) already!
---
I would rather have a powerful longsword for bossing tbh.
---
Edit: Forgto about the sara sword and its blessed version.
---
You did your best, but I may have easily stumbled across him and offered some advice
---
Yeah, it seems to. At least for skilling pets.
---
How can one man roast with such professionalism?
---
&gt; doesn't feel tedious.
---
Idk man, swapping out gear/ clearing inventory and doing it at intervals annoys the shit out of me more than a 6 hour grind doing something repetitive.
---
Not warding in particular no
---
Just use Tears of Guthix on them because they are waaaaaay faster than birdhouses 4Head
---
Aka I cannot take a joke, due to my parents raising a snowflake.
---
use chins!
---
Took me 70 agil to get full graceful through rooftops...
---
No. Aka there are plenty of people trying to sell accounts and scam others in OSRS.
---
Also: You clearly don’t know my parents.
---
Ironmen complaining that they have it harder than the average player even when they elect to make it harder on purpose for themselves and REEEing to get their way and nerf a thing they barely did? I am totally amazingly astoundingly shocked.
---
Nice name, awesome band. Got to seem em live on Drones tour
---
Time is money
---
Imbued heart -&gt; full arma -&gt; sang/ancestral (pretty sure full ancest and sang both give 1 max hit, sang is more expensive but the heal is really nice)
---
This is worse than game of thrones spoilers
---
Would give that amulet from shades a use
---
yesterday i started playing osrs lol after i maxed my rs3 account
---
99 agil should never fail 30 agil req shortcut too
---
No problem, I skipped the earlier levels of armor but that’s fairly obvious what’s good there. You should try to get a fighter torso ASAP from the Barbarian Assault minigame, it can be tedious but it’ll be the bis melee chest (when not tanking) until you can afford bandos
---
Sword will probably pass regardless because everyone votes mainly yes nowadays, although I wish it wouldn’t.
---
It would need to be at least 1000pts
---
So many things would begin to be too fast.
---
Ex. Gargoyls
---
want a cookie?
---
It's just in there to devalue tent, nothing more.
---
Are you copy and pasting this to every negative comment?
---
No, you clearly do not know me. Me and your mother are very fond of one another.
---
Aka she sucks my cock.
---
Just because you dont feel empathy doesn't mean others don't. Upvotes and Downvotes mean nothing to me. Other people mean something to me, regardless of knowing them personally.
---
Blessed d hide is better then void  at zulrah. Always wear ancestral hat, then wear ahrims occult and tormented. And swap to fury blessed d hide anguish b gloves and accu for range
---
How dare he tag ash in that

&gt; this is the rapier of slash, but degradable.
---
that already exists.
---
Kbd is for pet
---
Not everything on the internet is always true, also most people who actually commit suicide or seriously plan to tend not to tell anyone. Hence why you always hear or read stories about loved ones shocked someone they knew committed suicide. 
---
The ones that actual do tend to not to say so. But that's just my opinion and what I've read or seen.
---
Rs3 kiln much? Don’t think people will approve

Looks cool

They are in full nerf mode right now.
