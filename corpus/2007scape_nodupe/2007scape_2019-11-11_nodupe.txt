We already deal with enough politicians not keeping their promises and just using campaign rhetoric that'll get them elected, then doing something completely different in the real world.

No but there's a bank right there so it's only a problem of ur an ultimate

I would support the idea of degradable everything so long as Jagex gave the players the option to repair the item at a fraction of the supply cost used to construct it with the appropriate skill (smithing, crafting, etc.) If items were to break permanently, that would be bad for player moral.
---
Ayy I had a King Edwards Imperial cigar box that I kept random shit in too
---
Well said, especially the part regarding pkers bringing back osrs. Because its true, we did. Every pker moved on to private servers whilst the PvMers were adapting to eoc. Then 2006scape got 600k sign-ups, advertised solely by pkers until it snowballed into that registration number. Then it was shut down prematurely and Jagex polled OSRS, which once again was advertised the most by pkers. Funny enough you can go backwards in the rs3 subreddit and find pvmers shit talking the idea of OSRS, pvmers which now cry on the internet because a pker ruined their wildy boss slayer assignment and made them actually lose something for once, because god forbid these PvMing babies lose their items!
---
Yeah, well there's probably a reason why you're not in charge.
---
And if you don't think that's crossed their mind, or is what they're already doing to analyze the behaviour patterns of the bots, then I don't think you're anything but proof of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Weekend warriors buy gold because they don't have time to farm it normally and they make up a pretty large portion of the player base. Its part of the game tbh

Any confirmed bans from people using third party clients yet?

Not really sure what your argument is here you pretty much proved my point. 4.8m/hr solo 1 acc at zulrah challenges - but is not equal to - raids 1 solo not to mention you dont even need a maxed acc for zulrah to be that profitable but you need way more reqs for raids. And you simply proved my point about GWD - it is possible to solo and people do it (ironmen mostly), the meta for arma is to chin and you don't even need 2 accs for that. Also if you include in alt in any of this that alt could be doing something better than helping a main do something. Why make 6.5m-9m/hr at raids 1 with an alt when you can put both accs at zulrah for 5m/hr? Lower effort same reword. Also you only used bandos for your GWD point because it is the only one that really needs more than 1 acc to be efficient, sara is 100% solo unless you are using an alt to tank, zammy is solo unless you want a tank, and arma is solo chin.
---
haha thanks :D
---
Duo Sara is so easy. Bring blow pipe for minions. You shouldn’t need stamina pots in a duo, maybe 1 for emergency if you are new. Have one person get agro and run around and have the other person attack it. There is a ping pong method where you don’t attack Sara when she is chasing you, when she turns to your partner then you start attacking and ur partner runs. Switch every 3 hits and she walks back and forth between you both (go on the corners diagonal from each other). Just try a trip and you’ll get the hang of it, pray mage.
---
I don't really believe their post, based on their past history. =/
---
The person who did that isn’t even close to upper mgmt
---
I'm a big sdmm player and miss it sorely. Not disagreeing with you, but could you elaborate more on what you think about its ingame economy with some examples? I'm interested to hear what other players think because the fresh economy in sdmm was something I really liked about the game mode.
---
I have a max main elite void / dhcb / anguish and zammy boots. A tent whip. Can i do cox?

My granddad thought the preinstalled Solitaire game gave his computer a virus.

Implying that piece of shit 'Ace of Spades' Jagex pushed was actually AoS.

Too bad OpenSpades and BuildandShoot are dead, guess AoS is officially gone.

I'm pretty sure google search results are tailored based on your individual search history.
---
Even then, vork and zulrah are both slightly better gp per hour than cerb. I don't think there's a single slayer task that is better money per hour than vork or zulrah
---
&gt; out if every 2 one is doubled.
---
And out of every 2 doubled, 1 is doubled again, and so on.
---
Really, no bone is "doubled", they're just *not consumed* 50% of the time, which over a large enough sample is equivalent to doubling each bone.
---
What's a comp cape?
---
I think your not understanding what causes people to both pvp and not pvp.
---
People pvp because of the risk and reward of the fight, removing smite removes both. 
---
People don’t pvp because it requires a specialised account to not get destroyed. 
---
If people wanted a risk free but still having the “fun of pvp content “!clan wars would be busy, but it isn’t.
---
Yes I know I did the quest but on osrs it’s eyes of glouphrie where you discover they’re evil creatures. I understand the joke.
---
There isn't necessarily one singular reason why 'all' PvM gear is shifting in price, there can be one reason the Lance/dhcb are fluctuating, and a separate reason why Ancestral is rising.
---
Would just lower the price
---
&gt;Yeah, I think most people on this sub are even younger than millenials 
---
A lot of millennials are in their 30's now.

I love these posts - they're so nostalgic.

Ok, so if you know so much what are the challenges?  What are the relics?  What skills should i rush first to complete the challenges?
---
Oh, right, we dont have thst info.
---
Use that extra cash you earn to level your screenshot skill.
---
Not really, your account is more likely to be taken over because of password reuse than brute-force guessing.
---
Pvp worlds and Bh is pkers vs pkers, no pvmers involved 
---
You can get 100m loots in PvP, I’ve got many of them before. In the last 2 days I’ve smited 2 ags and 1 d claws on top of all the other stuff
---
Learning the mechanics can be fun, it’s like learning zulrah or demonics, feels good once you master it - it’s just way less repetitive and more dynamic 
---
People are toxic not pkers - when pvmers crash my iron man it’s toxic, you gotta recognise it’s the individual that’s an ass hole not the whole community
---
Broken link
---
I'd guess most of viewers are PvMers and a lot of us have been quitting the game because of a lack of new content.
---
A long password is more secure than a complex one I believe.
---
Vote only if 65atk and not 75
---
I agree, It has a lot of benefits but I don’t want this game to die out again. We need new players and if we went back to the old death mechanics older players would bully newer ones even more than they do now. 
---
Taking this persons gear after tricking them to kill themselves is just adding insult to injury.
---
THATS THE POINT like Jesus what about that don’t you get?
---
It’s MEANT to be a challenge. 
---
It’s MEANT to be a surprise. 
---
We don’t NEED to have anything and we aren’t owed anything either. 
---
Get off your high horse and just wait like the rest of us, who gives a shit about planning, just enjoy the game for once.
---
What if Jagex holds a sting operation and sells gold to the websites, take the gold buying/selling websites money, then immediately bans the account they sold too. Jagex takes their money and bans gold buyers/sellers. It's a win win
---
Just tried and confirmed this.  Didn’t have any gold on me and still let me in the portal a third time.  Now I can be a Corp Hunter too!
---
It's actually against the rules to do this btw since it's considered rigging minigames. Not sure if they're gonna ban people for it though.
---
Sit on them for a while. Don't ever sell them for less than 8.1k.
---
yeah if i saw someone else wearing it i thought it would be cool to recognize that they also played the game mode but anyone can just buy it
---
You can do it relatively low risk and you can get significantly higher points/hr than other slayer masters because you can do the tasks relatively quickly as well. It even replaced turael points boosting as the meta for gaining maximum slayer points
---
&gt;If it was meant to be done without info why tell us anything at all?
---
you gotta give a little info to build hype that's classic marketing
---
Its a limited 2 month league, time is money.  How about you look at any other game that has temp leagues and ask yourself why the devs announce these things before launch?  Instead of coming here and acting like an ass.
---
[deleted]
---
Poe gets plenty of hype and they tell you day 1 everything you need to know, because people spend the next month planning and discussing it
---
I haven’t played in about 4 months, what have a missed?
---
NP, once you master that it should reduce the damage you take by a good chunk. The only case you have to guess then is if they're already on melee, but still that's in theory 2/3rds less damage :D
---
While this may be the case for you, PvP simply has no appeal for me and many people like me. My only annoyance for PvP is this direction Jagex continue to push to encourage PKers to target non-PKers, it's idiotic. I personally would be far more supportive of updates that focus on PvP and PvP issues if they were complete for PKing each other.
---
I won't ever PK, it doesn't interest me, I wish Jagex didn't shoehorn any content which made me forced into content that gave PKers a moment of joy before going back to 30minutes of boredom waiting for the next person.
---
Keeping it to particular worlds is indeed a great move, the creates, as we can see so far, have been a failure to the point you can no longer open them. I wish more rewards were added, not just a create which gave you supplies which devalued them in the long term, unique items are always the best rewards.
---
Sadly just my opinion but that's how I view it as a non-PKer.
---
I stopped playing around 4-5 months ago for this reason. Sometimes I randomly start wanting to play this game again. Then I check the osrs subreddit and realize that I'd better not.
---
Two reasons, one this game was at is peak when the core demographic of players where about your age. So a lot of us are early-mid twenties because we where playing this when we where like 16 in real 07. 
---
Two most younger people don't enjoy it because the whole gameplay is based of delayed satisfaction. Kind of arcade like mechanics that carries over to many other games after the 80's kind of to make the games more challenging to keep people putting more quarters in. Games like Morrowind had no fast travel, and quest markers, and the walking pace was slow when you first started. Things where generally more slow, and punishing. If you look at games like Skyrim which represents a bit more of what the current generation imagines when they think of the franchise you see a lot of short cuts to stream line the process and provide you with more imediate enjoyment and convience where the point you have your whole dopamine rush formulated in a scripted level.
---
Even more now days games are become smaller experiences where you play it in 15 minute bursts and they throw every feel good noise and loot boxes at you to give you a rush that would take you like a month to feel on a RuneScape grind.
---
People have just adjusted to a more casual 15-45 minute couple time a day play style overall and don't prefer much of the same quirks. That's not to say it doesn't exist, it's just in the wide market of games from the triple A industry, mobile industry, and Chinese/Asian markets show that is true.
---
It's so weird to me that Americans wear shoes inside.
---
Sounds like jagex just shouldn’t give free prime membership because this happens literally every time they do it. The crates give average 50k (not including emblems) who gives a shit? You make way more money doing slayer than you ever will opening crates people are just freaking out like they do every big update.
---
It's just like those "hurrdurr, vote with your wallets!" posts which you see around microtransaction topics. While it may work in theory it's nearly impossible to execute in practice. 
---
It's practically impossible to rally an entire group of people to change their views and go against something they quite simply don't care about. Whales will keep whaling and people will keep buying gold as long as such option exists.
---
They don’t announce anything until the day of..
---
Look at POE, you find out the full aspects of the new league and the new patch update the day of.
---
You get a sneak peak of what it looks like, but nothing mechanic based at all.. nothing about any new items or anything. 
---
Until the day of..
---
Omfg that’s aids lol. Well deserved
---
Lol all yalls that don't want to believe this is possible
---
Just LOL
---
5600kc without any vissy here, that’s a big one bro!
---
This should be reportable...?
---
whenever i see these throwback pictures i look for login details written on the desk like i used to do lol
---
Whoever stole my RuneScape account, your moms a hoe !
---
You can make up to 650k per hour at Blast Furnace with only 30 smithing. Just get a coal bag and ice gloves (or water buckets).
---
I'm making about 800k/h at 77 smithing.
---
Green dragons can make you about 400k/hr depending on how often you get pk'ed with minimal range levels.
---
But yes, the money/hour in skilling generally sucks and I consider that a problem.
---
I specifically did it there because of that post. I wanted to continue what I thought was a funny meme. A very large portion of reddit is just reposts or a continuation of various ideas
---
Literally one of the only pictures I have of myself as a kid was from me playing Runescape in 2006 when I was 12
---
Luckily Jagex released people like you are out there, I don’t think you’re gonna get a say on pvp polls for long :( 
---
Spiteful little person who can’t see past their own immediate self interest
---
My initial thought lol
---
lol bp spec
---
You ever play Ace of Spades before Jagex got their hands on it? It was brilliant. Huge potential all wasted by Jagex.
---
Buy the dip.
---
Remember when yew logs were 400-500ea during the first year OSRS was out
---
Lol you’re so mad that it’s affecting how stupid your arguments are...
---
If there is one person farming Zulrah there aren’t 100 bots lol you’re a fucking moron that lacks critical thinking ability
---
Enjoy being mad kid. You must be so mad that you can’t kill your alt or run your bot farm
---
Thats literally me. If I don't personally know you ingame. I probably won't speak to you.
---
I mean just a few days ago some noob or so I thought he was a noob was asking how to get to edgeville from the ge. So I asked him to follow me, we went through the shortcut and as soon we get to the ditch he just goes and stands there. Next thing I know a bunch of rune scimmys and 100k cash stacks start appearing in the wildy. Since I had just banked all my stuff i figured why not grab some. I hopped over the ditch and next thing u know a main with full ahrims and a toxic staff comes out tryna freeze me. He was so bad i was able to loot 200k and 3 rune scimmys and get out of the wildy before he could even attack me. But thats when i realized i got lured by helping someone who i thought was a noob
---
blizzard does it fine, jagex'fs spaghetti code us likley the only issue
---
Lol I'm already kinda tired of zulrah at 1.2k kc and am dreading going as long as you
---
Ben dover
---
Heya! Im 16 too!
---
I think they did a update to bot watch a week or so ago, and it back fired.
---
Players where trading to their own accounts and getting banned.
---
I think they need to target accounts that trade over large sums of cash, then look at the accounts that have traded it manually.
---
Then ban those accounts
---
There's still a small number of players on BnS, isn't there?
---
Rip UIM.
---
Although, killing monsters is now like a 50/50 chance at a bag.
---
So SAO but osrs? Sounds fun
---
Takes practice yo.
---
OP’s clicks were sloppy AF, I’d say it’s safe to assume he’s not a mobile main. 
---
I farm bosses on mobile just as well as I can on pc. Only thing I struggle with is boss fights that require gear and prayer switches within a short duration. 
---
The ultimate mobile enemy by far though is Demonic Gorilla’s. Fuck those demonic bastards with a burning passion. 
---
Pray flicking, precise clicks, Woox walking, etc. all pretty easy on mobile after awhile. I also don’t use both thumbs. I use index finger on my right, thumb on my left.
---
i don't remember this stand.
---
Yea I love just going through all the random resources I have in my inventory... its really satisfying to pull multiple 100k stacks from the ge
---
When I was little, I thought those boxes looked legit. I put my army men in them lol.
---
Ha what they sure do ban buyers, but so many do it and don't get caught
---
Most pkers don't want to go into the wild and search for a looting bag after every death
---
Dude I remember those fighting robots.
---
Ancient artifacts from the EP system caused tons of inflation.
---
Then maybe i dont have the coin for theatre while im recovering. But i was considering looking at some of the other bosses
---
Sick idea tbh. OR just play twisted leagues. Only like 12 people are gonna play so it would be pretty easy to just talk to each other and keep your stats/points even so everybody wins. I legit asked so many people if they were playing and only 1 or 2 said yes, at wintertodt, my cc, all over the place.
---
Or it could just be bullshit.
---
I see a lot of comments questioning why pvp needs extra incentive to make money outside of what people are already risking. The reason is because so much money is lost when learning to play experiencing death after death after death. Jagex implemented this system so that you can learn and still profit. It’s obviously flawed and any time additional gp is used as an incentive it will be abused. 
---
What I don’t understand is why Jagex doesn’t solve this problem by implementing an ELO system, with maybe a very small additional gp incentive if they feel the need to do so. The solution seems so obvious, yet they haven’t even commented on such a system that I’m aware of. If I knew that I would be matched with people similar in skill to me I would pk a lot. I think it’s a lot of fun and unlike any other experience in RS. But I don’t want to get slapped around 9/10 times while I learn nor do I want to lose tens of millions learning.
---
Bh crates are worth 180k each? Damn I'm unlucky I've averaged 44k a crate lol
---
I used to sell blow. Most of my clients were business men and women.
---
The only reason I've mentioned this is because I was raided and I served my time.
---
iPhone X is the perfect mobile size for me. I’m so fucked when they stop making iPhone X sized phones.
---
One day Jagex is gonna have a db leak and people are gonna have a field day because of this.
---
Far more important and bigger companies have had leaks before and Jagex isn’t immune. Reducing password complexity like this makes the impact of this (if it were to happen) much worse.
---
I found them online just now, they are rumble robots
---
How do u line them up
---
possibly but its probably true
---
That's Fally park
---
Message me privately, I think I can help you
---
A guy who bankstands on 40 accounts because he likes it when you make Reddit posts about him
---
b o t s ?
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
It seems like indirectly participating is more accurate.
---
It's been said a thousand times, but to do efficient slayer, you have to gear as a slayer. The scales are tipped in great favor of the person who has geared specifically to kill you.
---
You're paying so much more per heal.
---
Hmmm, that’s pretty convincing, but can you back up your claim?
---
I think it depends on the part of the country honestly. I'm an American and it's pretty weird to wear shoes inside around here (Ohio).
---
anyone who doesnt play is a turbo virgin.
---
I’m working on the lunar quests now so that I can use those spells to help fund bonds. Just realized one of the requirements to dream mentor requires 85 combat to get the major profitable lunar spells (humidify, plank make). Any easy way for 50-60 combats to get to 85 combat to accomplish the pre-Req’s for unlocking these spells? Is crabs the best option or is there something better
---
Yeah i might look at camping gorillas. Thanks for the advice
---
Could you explain why? It seems pretty easy to digest to me
---
Imagine walking to the grocery store about to spend your botting money on some dinner and a sweaty runescape mod appears and irl teleblocks you while another mod dds specs you out from behind
---
Yesssss!!!!!! I do
---
I bet you made this name way before you took this photo... You seem to have upgraded to a \~67 fl oz. bottle :)
---
How about trying to give constructive criticism?
---
The arbitrary hard limits on tiers seems odd.  You end up with things like thieving in A tier when it is clearly closer to everything in B tier.
---
Without reading the comments, which you should not have to do with graphs, the chart makes no sence. Plus you have to of had to seen a youtube video a few months back explaining how this chart works. Lastly, at first glance this chart looks like OP is ranking skills based on prefrence, which is generally how this style of chart is used.
---
A bar graph showing the difference in skillcapes or a pie chart is a much better representation of the data.
---
I think the one or two least expensive things being worn should be lost, so either wear all best in slot and risk a couple mil, or sacrifice two of them for budget.
---
yeah i think you're right lol
---
IDK, there are probably a decent amount of goldbuyers (and sellers) that browse the subreddit. I've seen a decent amount of posts trying to sell accounts and even some asking where to buy gold as well as some spam accounts trying to promote that sort of stuff. And those are just the ones that get past Automod...
---
Still, it is probably a fairly small percentage, at least that are posting about it. And you are right that a post saying "stop it" is probably not going to lead to a sudden change of heart.
---
Yeah he has max combat and some pretty high stats all around I believe
---
I set it up with my keyboard for when I have to chisel dark essence cuz giving myself arthritis
---
You are most correct Lord, we must view these achievements individually as commendable but also globally as a step in the direction of a greater goal, and a continuous progress towards an greater self than the one that lies behind us!
---
Yeah I just made it in paint. I'm not an artist idk what the ring would look like. If you zoom in it says not final art lol.
---
Old enough!
---
this is the type of person that falls for this \^
---
The only thing that kind of applies to is ‘shift drop’ but thats holding the shift button down and clicking. Not just holding the shift button down alone.
---
Cool idea! What do you think the negative effects would be to make an eternal suffering which has same stats as ring of suffering, only never needed recoil rings to recharge? I dont think price of recoils would suffer tbh becuase there are very few eternal gems entering the game. Make the eternal suffering have one higher prayer bonus or something too?
---
link?
---
I was thinking it might be useful in revs to escape a clan or something. If you're risking a lot 2m to tele out wouldn't be that bad.
---
It's a long shot I agree,  worth a shot tho 😜
---
Ahhh the fabled amulet of power! The mark of a true adventurer, well done sir.
---
Delete BH and work on where 80% of pvp takes place (the wilderness on normal worlds)
---
"so pkers could kill them" should be "so some action can happen". Anti-pking is a thing for a reason, if you're not willing to pay attention then why not do regular afk slayer?
---
Where's the loot?
---
Both don’t need to exist because only 1 will get played. Do you know how much dev time and work it would take to implement this? They don’t just have a dial on a pc they can crank back to august 2007 and press start. It would make no sense to pursue this already knowing there won’t be enough people for it to be worthwhile.
---
ELI5 Why is the DHL spiking and DHCB crashing?
---
I’m not sure what your work is, but I like to afk my combats at ammonite crabs at work. If I disconnect, have to lock my phone, or look away for too long it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to pay to set it up like NMZ and you can’t die. It’s comparable xp, 100% free, and 100% afk for 10 minutes and then a few taps to ready Aggro. I definitely recommend giving it a try!
---
Yeah nah man sorry. I know heaps of people who buy gold. No risk of bans at all. Not it any online game either really. WoW is the same. You can buy gold there with no risk of bans. Selling is another thing though
---
Honestly the part that kills me is just 12 steel arrows,
---
lol people still train here ? just afk nmz with prayer on
---
I got a shiny tucking Zubat.  Absolute terrible luck
---
What are those creatures? Are you at a Slayer concert?
---
I think it’s because mysterious emblems don’t drop from wildly slayer anymore, so less profit
---
My iron kc of 1003 begs to differ
---
Seems about right
---
I think you haven't heard of the LMS update. You get points now, and there's no wager option (comp is free).
---
Pairs nicely with the addy pick.
---
Tbp? The blow pipe? Lol yes it's way better.
---
Honestly shit like this kind of makes the game great. RuneScape is like a human nature experiment.
---
Dead meme
---
r/thanksimcured
---
Very well.
---
Zxxzddedddddd?!!!!!!!!!
---
We need a bot that detects when people take pictures of their screens and automatically links them to a Gyazo download
---
4 is the optimal number of people to do the boss with as you still consistently kill it in the minimum 3 phases and everyone gets more loot (things can get iffy with 3 players). Any more people and it means that each player does less individual damage and therefore get worse drops without actually improving kill times. It's not going to destroy your profit to have an extra person but it's noticeable.
---
Just a link to a video of how to screenshot instead.
---
People that dislike PvP/BH and don’t want to see it succeed, are going to throw anything in the hopes that it sticks. Such as throwing figures around like 1B/hr, Twitch prime BH bots (confirmed not true by Mod Weath), level 3 BH bots (can’t even access BH as a level 3...), PvP/BH shouldn’t be profitable, as you said - BH “interferes” with wildy slayer, etc etc.
---
Which was already confirmed allowed.
---
Why should pvm have better graphics than PvP? The diff in graphics supports my main thesis (see title) that pvm updates get more attention than pvp updates. 
---
All those items are useful in pure pvp, but what about main pk? AGS is meta there and if you disagree you're sorely wrong. Majority of pvm updates impact mains (hydra raids zulrah cerb). The main pker meta has been AGS. A  TON of pvm only mains complain you need a pure to pk effectively.
---
Ultimately it seems you've come here for the sole purpose of disagreeing with a pker
---
Edit;
---
V Uniques  got polled so you're wrong there too.
---
I don’t mind it. Krakie.
---
That's a neat way to look at it lol
---
Someone should put together a collage of all these photos.
---
lol true
---
Which coincidently is a gold sink..
---
This is a good one. It's not too difficult to get to 35 farming or whatever level is required to farm them. Iirc, you should have access to 4 patches? You could get that to 5 patches with the fifth being disease free. 
---
Tips on that: Try to get Fairy Tale part 1 finished, it'll give you magical secateurs which increase crop yield by 5% I believe? This will help in the end. Additionally, use ultra compost. You're guaranteed to get at least 6 herbs per patch, don't be surprised to get 10.
---
I don’t think I get this, but I love it.
---
You are so virtuous sire, most peasents would view this small achievement and call the King who made this post a slang word; but you are different, you and your friend on top see that progress is made with small step. I applaud you and our fellow gamer that got his first 99 in the medieval themed massively multiplayer online game knows as Old School RuneScape!
---
Yo what the fuck, who “installed” those network cables like that?
---
Fuckin what
---
Why not just drop the table?
---
Because Jagex makes $$$. Welcome to the world of Micro Transactions lol
---
You should stop buying gold and projecting it onto us.
---
Does he explain why he thinks "the way they're doing it shows how little of an understanding they actually have of the game"?
---
It's meant to be a competitive gamemode right? I'm not sure how the mode would translate over to an e-sport scene but it'll be plenty competitive within the community; players love being the first to do something and leagues is perfect for that.
---
democracy is ultimately flawed. the only true way to govern ourselves is to develop a general artificial intelligence and implant every human with a chip that controls them.

i for one welcome our new robot overlords.

LMAO dog, toxic blow pipe
---
A strong password is a long one, not case sensative.
---
Nope
---
500 gp is nothing to sneeze at
---
Fair, bots would exist even if there was zero RWT. They would drop, but they wouldn't be gone. As a whole though, it would be healthier for the game if people stopped supporting botting, phishing and hacking by buying from the sites that get their gold from them. It is not a one-step plan to save the game, but it would be beneficial
---
See if Gons dads at the top.
---
The other guy is right. Most people use a client called "runelite" that adds a lot of convenient features. Only download it from runelite.net though. There are a lot of ads and stuff for fake clients
---
Can't in an update query in MariaDB + PHP because batched queries aren't allowed, this was the next best thing.
---
If you think part of regearing in pvp should be to go out and farm npcs, idk what to tell you. Typical narrow minded reddit at it again.
---
Someone thinks they are going to die, they pull the cable from there router? Would be hard to implement imo.
---
What's the first?
---
I’d change all info, if possible.
---
Nobody had to ask me, it’s reddit, a place where people have discussions. I contributed to the discussion and then laid out some facts to support the point I was making. No need to be so emotional or rude.
---
It's honestly insane how a dude would risk his full time job for a clan...
---
Forfty percent of all people know that
---
im still making mad money selling gp. step up your game man

So you had access to a large amount of account names and passwords and didn't clean them out? That's some good restraint right there
---
You can make it out just fine fuckface.
---
I have the first time it happened, and then it happened the next day. Im confused man, like they didnt take anything. Why always at duel areana, i feel like its a bug.
---
Hence the "little incentive". Sure a few will still hack for their own gain but it's a pretty small percentage of total hacks. I'm not claiming to know the numbers but I don't doubt for a second that if rwt suddenly wasn't a thing, the amount of hackings would plummet faster than dhcb's price right now.
---
ikr it's like these people that are always replying "barrows endgame lmao" don't even understand that the beauty of Runescape was always in its open-endedness and letting the player set their own goals. maybe your endgoals are to smith rune equipment, maybe its craft double nature runes, or maybe its to complete your poh. all of those were valid endgoals in 2007 - and so many others as well. a lot of people in the osrs community nowadays bring that horribly toxic themepark-mmo "gotta rush endgame" mentality and honestly I can't stand it.

Jajajajajajajajajajaja

Not really sure what build would be a "real build" but I'm sure open to suggestions. If you call a main a build then the only answer I have for you is laughter. Zerk bracket is just as dead as pure bracket so you must mean mains. What a silly flamer. Imagine afking in nmz for 300 hours and calling that a build.
---
So technically you could combine any pizza half with the other
---
why is it crashing? new update?
---
Here's the thing though, he could have totally kept the job and stayed in the clan without compromising his integrity.

Oh cool, so i don't have to buy that 20M imbued heart anymore?  
---
Do u have an OCD problem?
---
These are always Bittersweet to see

Yeah in BH
---
They could afford it because of the loads of money saved by buying laundry detergent in bulk.
---
Eh. Maybe. I was feeling lucky after a bandos trip and thought I was gonna get a skotizo pet. I just felt it. Ended up getting it.

Wish Charlie would play osrs some more

It happened with twisted bows once. It was all over reddit, people got them from prices ranging from 1k-100k.
---
Let me just fail to steal from a silk stall while rushing Wintertodt
---
Wouldn’t having a password with the maximum allowable characters + some upper and lower case letters more secure than just the maximum allowable characters, period? Don’t most websites have case sensitive passwords anyways
---
You continue to prove my point.
---
No they didn't, pking was a negative sum game since the average k:d ratio is 1:1, and the sunk cost of supplies used for pking.
---
Maybe the top 25 percent of pkers made money, but all of that came from the bottom 75 percent who lost money and who quickly quit as a result.
---
I think everyone would love this.
---
Your dream won't come true unless u keep killing corp.
---
If they did release every little bit of info, there could be a real "meta," at least for early game progression. 
---
Let's say they released info that showed 85 mining would be a huge bonus - you'd see people power mining the few iron spots as soon as feasible, for hours/days straight. Every good mining spot would be packed for the better part of the league, just because people were informed training it would be really worthwhile. 
---
The secrecy aspect of TL keeps things "fair." Everyone can come to roughly the same conclusions about what could/should be a good way to start your account, but also gives a huge amount of freedom in going out and exploring the perks, and in general just trying new things.
---
How is theiving that high? It’s a money-making skill and extremely mindless on a splash world even with pouches now
---
Someone got it.
---
I found this wiki page recently, probably one of the best sources for TL info we have at the moment (:

south Louisiana?
---
Such a good year. Great memories
---
Thanks :)
---
Yea its an amazing area, definitely one of the most solid national parks I have ever worked at! You have to come back at some point to take pictures!!! They are just so flipping cool. To so many who haven't experienced them in their full form don't fully realize how huge they can get.
---
Ok but no other part of the game is net negative. PvP is the only net gold sink. 
---
100k vork death isnt a sink when people go 100 kills without dying and vork drops 120k alchables/ kill.
---
People wonder why PvP is dead when the current setup makes participation unfun. The lack of incentive combined with high barrier to entry gives us a situation where only the best PK, preventing new players from engaging. 
---
Meanwhile PvM is AAA money shower with complex mechanics and loot, even for mid level players and weekly updates...
---
...and just where is the gp from those you defeat supposed to come from?
---
Resources need to enter the food chain from somewhere, and you in the same post expressed your dissatisfaction that those resources should come from killing PvMers participating in wilderness content, so where should these resources come from?
---
is there any evidence or validity to those claims
---
Specifically, their max hit is doubled, you can't hit them, and the first hit you take drops your Attack, Strength, Ranged, and Magic to **0** and halves your Prayer and Defence, even if you're praying Protect From Melee.

Sounds  like a fun private server item
---
What??
---
A side note to this guide, it's a WIP obviously. We're currently overhauling parts of the website to better congregate things that we have researched for Kourend and Kebos to be a part of the Twisted League, aside from Twisted League specific changes that aren't already known.
---
Learning this sort of thing is part of the fun
---
Yeah that’s understandable but what has bh done for the community in a whole? Create more problems or less than when it was not there?
---
I accidentally stuck mine in for 95gp couple days ago, thank fuck it sold for 95m...
---
I can’t do anything but fish and bank monkfish on mobile. It’s just ridiculous tedious. Bank standing is annoying even and you have people doing goddam farmer Runs and bosses
---
That’s all I wanted, enjoy the pet and get it insured
---
Yo what the fuck is your rng?
---
A guy wearing full arma, slayer helm and tbow just staring into a banker is less appealing to talk to for a regular player than someone just hanging out I gues? 
---
I only go to G.E for supplies or selling items to afford other items thats better for current tasks, so its not exacly a guy who looks approachable.
---
I havent had much happend since I turned my private to friends only yesterday tho.
---
You got your wish. They added this in the last update.
---
Unlucky, has pet....
---
Yeah it was a “hit” but it has bots ruining the eco and legit people who pk? Why were the crates removed and  once again we have pugger uploading farmer who is making 25m+ a hour with no skill required. Yeah pking legit is fun but they have flaws with this shit. Until they fix those flaws their is going to be updates like removing the crates and soon to be emblems.
---
What Fraternity are you in?
---
Base 70s bro! You're looking good!
---
this is gold rofl
---
I’m a noob so what is free trade? What was removed exactly and why?
---
How do you make cannonballs?
---
Yeah jagex definitely needs to come up with something. It's not just the loot crates that are the problem. I wish jagex would take more time testing these updates so the PvM and PvP could get along for once.
---
There’s already a 65 crush weapon.
---
Meta change for vork and everyone overreacting about it. Get your dhcb while it’s cheap
---
Please tell me you are a UIM
---
You asked what BH has done for the community. I answered.
---
Anyone know anything about Ben Aksoy? I've found very little and this makes me wonder what happened to him. 
---
"Aksoy was reported to have agreed to the deal due to his critical financial state at the time, though was subsequently offered a position in Jagex's Cambridge headquarters. He continued working on the game from Jagex' offices until late 2012, when his laptop was physically damaged by one of the company's system administrators."
---
Sort of weird to leave just because someone accidentally broke your laptop unless it was on purpose lol. He certainly had money issues dunno if it was drug related. He never seemed to be social with his community even before jagex and he has deleted all of his tweets.
---
His game had a fairly large community until jagex got involved which is kinda sad but what do i know all I did was google AoS and his name for 15 mins
---
Yeah try it on incognito; it'll still work
---
Context?
---
Thanks my friend!
---
Whoa.. Get that checked out if that's the shape..
---
Just let it sit and rot incase you want to come back and play some time or just give it to me since I will never hit 1819 total level or even 100 mil banked.
---
Drop party or give it to me.
---
Oh my god. My brother and I had those 2 exact robots on that shelf. How wholesome
---
Reminds me of myself. I swear we all were young playing runescape.i started in 2004 at the age of 5 and still play now
---
Why not?
---
So glad to see there was a good resolution :)
---
Probably lol honestly never thought I'd need it or that I would post on reddit I was just in shock
---
Wtf, don't make me worried
---
Wasn't it because they have to claim that rsgp is just virtual and has no real life worth? If gp was an actual real life currency, they would get fucked by gambling laws.
---
That's not what removing free trade was - you could still trade directly with other players and give them low-value items or small amounts of gold, but giving away expensive items/lots of gold or 'selling' expensive items cheaply was not allowed. Drop trading expensive items/lots of gold no longer worked, and if you pk'ed someone then you wouldn't get most of their loot.
---
The locking of zulrah behind site would be because it's too low requirements, but because it's a piece of content that is easy to create bots for, and the community has asked for it.
---
Lvl 56 of the fight caves on mobile right now. Got it paused smokin a cig almost got jad first try last night but I missclicked and fuckin got smacked to 1hp. Drank a brew, focused on jad and the healers smacked me to death.
---
Get it to follow you the the varrock mines and wait by the mugger or rat respectively.
---
*doesn't matter if you die, if you're already dead inside*
---
But that won't drop the items for me right? I already got dark wizards to kill it once.
---
If i kill player a and player a kills me, we lost 100k in supplies each and we lost like 60k on repairing our gear. Thats why.
---
The hover text even mentions mixed case.
---
Low detail skeleton gang
---
Your password isn't getting bruteforced.
---
The safety is the exact same.
---
How did it follow you lol
---
Also, did they really not press charges?
---
Miss the non wilderness ditch days
---
It happened to a handful of people. Hell it happened to lynx titan.
---
spoiler: &gt;!it's 2007!&lt;
---
Yeah but then those subquests have their own subquests and so on like a fractal
---
What are u talking about, you're almost maxed.
---
How do you even check which ip last logged on?
---
Hmmm if It died at dark wizards it dropped all it loot there then. I was pretty sure u could wait till it spawned and pick it up. 
---
You could try the wilderness under edge. But I think the gate has a warning. Kinda tough because everything that'll allow you to kill it requires the bot to accept something. 
---
See what happens if u try to tele it to the wild maybe? Bot could possibly accept that.
---
Congratulations! You just got some rc xp
---
A very small subset of the playerbase causes demand for a problem, that doesn't mean Jagex shouldn't be doing more to help the situation
---
Read further into my post. Free trade removal originally started as absolutely no trading. Restricted trading was patched in very shortly after the update went live, due to massive backlash to the update. 
---
Very similar to how when the grand exchanged launched, it started with no 4 hour buy limits. They very quickly patched buy limits in, and not a lot of players know about that.
---
Try it out and if you die. Dont fret. I tried my first time more than 10 years ago and died.
---
My only helpful tips to make the fight significantly easier is
---
1 - 43 prayer for protect from melee so you dont receive melee damage.
---
2 - 25 magic for varrock teleport if things are going south mid battle
---
3 - DO NOT FORGET YOURE ANTI DRAGONFIRE SHIELD. ITS A ONE HIT KO.
---
Nope, 1 hour for the bot to reclaim it.  If it doesn't it's lost.
---
Kind of already lost with the dark wizard kill.
---
Hey wanna be friends?
---
Buy it on GE m8
---
Should mention that it takes fucking forever so the gp/hr is low.
---
If they cheated for it yes
---
Many of the people on this sub don’t understand pvp.
---
They don’t understand the point of the different builds/killing styles
---
Just the other day we had “I laugh at 1 def accounts. What is the point”
---
It’s a different isolated part of the game but very rewarding
---
I have never found runescape fun outside of pking 
---
Some people make millions PVMing, others clue hunting, I prefer banging out HP
---
Me on a good Saturday night: Use Spade full of coke
---
Sanfews are absolutely fundamental to raids... but yeah, basically this.
---
Sorry I wasn't aware of this I only use it to get rid of skull after going in the abyss.
---
How often do you die if this is a problem
---
Don’t know why you think I don’t understand all that... This game isn’t designed to be played like that. It’s all interlinked and you must do certain things to unlock things you really want to do/methods you prefer. It’s pointless if you just start the game maxed and stand in a bank.
---
Then again, I’m not helpless and I like to earn what I get, and I don’t choose to play a game with an arbitrary set of rules just to break those rules and still pretend like I’m playing the game.
---
There is zero way to stop bots, without restricting legitimate players. 
---
These suggestions will merely delay suicide bots, not get rid of them. Delaying them sounds like a victory, but it really isn’t. All it does is double down the effort bot makers put in, which also increases their reward. The less botters there are, the more valuable their gp is on the market. 
---
Only thing that can stop bots is RS3’s bot watch, which is not fully implemented into OSRS for unknown reasons. 
---
Throughout Runescapes long history, both Jagex and the community have thrown countless clever ideas at stopping bots. Only two were ever successful. 
---
1.) The removal of free trade and wilderness. This almost killed the game, but accomplished it’s mission of temporarily stopping bots. 
---
2.) Bot watch - A script, capable of classifying and identifying every single player, or bot in the game, based on their play style. It’s strong enough in RS3 that bot watch can recognize a player, playing on different accounts, across different IP’s. Odds are that the script is too advanced to fully implement into OSRS’s game engine, and will require massive engine upgrades to handle it. So we’ll probably never see it on OSRS.
---
Yeah home teleport was added in 2006.
---
Still had to pay until you had a certain level
---
Even when I’m watching something. It’s just eh.
---
Just 720 more zalcano kills and i can afford it
---
Thats even worse then.... less people = less skips = easier to farm, ppl who know what rheir doing with several accs at once are making well in excess of 10m an hour, its braindead OP and should/likely will be nerfed soon as to seeing crates didnt effect it that much.
---
and when rs3 did their bounty hunter update
---
I'm pretty sure it's because the exchange rate for real world $ to GP is much better when you get it from RWT sites. If you buy a bond for gold you're getting a lot less for your money.
---
yerrrrrr banned
---
Same. group hug
---
Yooo I’m from covington lmao
---
Love it
---
the kourend ones are in multi and if chinning its like 7 min task
---
Got nothing to do with a tall horse m8 enjoy your downvotes.
---
Good on you....  
---
No, i mean it seriously. Now you can finally play the game.  
---
I have a similar HCIM.... 730ish total, 63cb.....   
---
And i haven't even done dragon slayer yet out of fear.  
---
I also have a main where i do most end game bossing which i always felt that my HCIM will never do (therefore will never have the best gears).... Now that you are free, you can do all these without that anxiety. I envy you in a way because i know my time will come.
---
F
---
Why didn't you have at least 43 prayer?  
---
That was one of the first few things i got.
---
Runescape is not a game for smart people.
---
I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. Bit of a large chunk of text, so please bear with me.
---
Basically the gist of it is, I had a friend who played this game religiously, but is no longer with us and I'd like to see the magic he saw in this game.
---
I'm using RuneLite (the official download on the website just won't work for me, dunno why) and my skills are at 50 overall. I have no problem with MMO's, I just can't really figure out what to *do.* Do I just finish the adventure paths as quick as possible? Do I just spend my time levelling my skills? I've been levelling my Attack the most, though I'm pretty sure the campfire/woodcutting skills are a lot more important.
---
I've just never played an MMO like RS before, so it's a bit overwhelming. I'm determined to push on though! I'm using the New Player's Guide on the RS Wiki and doing some of the adventure path's quests. I'm really sorry if this is a regurgitated question (because I definitely know it is,) and the mods can remove it that's the case.
---
Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dul8nh/skillcape_tierlist_10_november_2019_info_in/). I used the same data collection method by referencing LARGE UNIT's skill ranking to determine how many players in each skill have achieved 99. I wanted to see the data by exact quantity and in descending order, rather than skewed tiers (not bashing, just find this provides more accuracy for somewhat different purposes).
---
Yeah in about 8 hours
---
Which means that over half of people who have 99 rc also have a max cape, which is pretty crazy
---
You're fine with it because you're not impacted by it, I am, if I am impacted by it, I want to vote.
---
In many cases it's not just about opinions, even though you wanna make it out to be, since it suits your argument.
---
And fucking duh, thanks for stating the obvious.
---
Even if you were in charge, you wouldn't get it past the board to hire the ones you want, so your solution isn't as simple you're making it out to be.
---
Unless your solution is to buy a 300 million dollar company, which it should be rather safe to assume you can't, otherwise you'd probably have done it already, with the parent company wanting to sell for some time now.
---
 thank god we still have summits great RP
---
You’re aware it’s harder to pk with a lotting bag because you lose 1 item slot, and it’s not like the looting bag is game changing it prob adds and extra 100-150k to kills in supplies that usually just disappear, just because you’re a salty pvmer doesn’t mean that you have to be an arse about it (coming from someone who hasn’t PKed in like 6 years) grow up and learn the game isn’t all about you lmfao
---
rockmake bad
---
just spawn max sets so every1s happy 4head
---
BTW
---
I did that too. Except with Blizzard and not nados. It was never hard to locate people especially if the game I joined was a Baal run. You would be amazed at the amount of people that would not leave whether they felt safe or that they could kill me. A lot of people also think well he won't find me and then I did and they couldn't leave as fast as they wished.
---
If there’s inflation, that means the value of a single coin of in game currency is going down. The more money the playerbase has, the less each individual coin is worth because there’s more in circulation. If the economy is inflated, that means money lost value. So yeah maybe the item will have a higher value but the inflation makes it so that all the money you gather is worth less. But I’m no economist so might be wrong
---
I see.... I am proud of you :)
---
Which you could do by pulling your router. Unfortunately there's just nothing to be done about it. When it's Jagex servers fucking up, I might be inclined to agree - but like it or not, DCs is just a thing that happen that you gotta live with.
---
No - it happened well before the tbow spawn did.
---
What was your username(s), HC D2 is a pretty small community
---
I didn't think Blizzard worked like that. I once killed a 95+ Hammerdin attempting to Nightmare rush my 42 druid with stackked gear and skill gc's, he didn't party me first, went to Andy WP and I fucking slammed him
---
I’m only subbed here for this stuff, make more.
---
At least resource gathering ones. Herb, wcing, fishing, mining and such. Fuck it throw in runecrafting just to piss them off otherwise you only get air runes
---
Y’all are so nice, for you I’ll do it
---
He lured them to dark wizards. I think he wants the loot, since pvm or deaths not in wildy don't drop your stuff for others to see.
---
What's RES?
---
Fun fact: soa is dutch for STD so every time it comes up its really weird for a sec.
---
You might be looking at the old wiki. The fandom one hasn't been regularly updated in over a year.
---
gz!
---
Nice. I used to also have a level 9 Assassin, 12 charger, and 18 Zealer that I would trick people into fighting me. Steam rolling level 40-50s with my Zealer was a blast. My username on D2? I don't remember.. Some of my more memorable PK'er names were Zest (hdin), Pilot (light sorc), and Nados (wind druid). Can't remember anything else. My JSP is JVMorrow
---
Try edge lever? I think it has a dialogue but not too sure about that. If that doesn't work, try PvP worlds, maybe looter bots have some mules there.
---
The hours upon hours of constant metronomic clicking on the ardy knight is as enjoyable as Chinese water torture
---
The update brought me back because there are more pkers and less looters/bots
---
I’m not seeing this at all. You guys act like pkers don’t hunt bots
---
If you’re willing to go all the way to 99 runecrafting, you’re definitely a skiller that’s trying to max
---
A discussion, no. You're turning potential allies against you by accusing them of shit they didn't do. If you walk down the street saying you hate women or people of color, you can expect a fucking reaction as well. "But I said it to raise awareness!" yeah, awareness that you need your ass kicked.
---
I'm the opposite, people will insist to me to keep them on but I just find it so rude that I take themoff anyway
---
It was originally like that, there used to be clans that organised blast furnace events. Then Jagex updated it so dwarves can do the work. BF used to be one of the best money makers, because it wasn't exactly on demand
---
Endless run vs 85% ammo saver.  What are most people looking at going for and why?
---
Because they’re all making bank, the system is very exploitable atm
---
Woah, I haven't seen one of these in a while.
---
I'm quite annoyed tbh. I only started playing osrs properly a few weeks ago.
---
I got 99 agility legit before the advanced courses were introduced in RS3/OSRS.  I've only managed to stomach getting to 70 agi as my first real task in osrs.
---
Starting osrs from scratch with no agility and no shortcuts unlocked is torture.
---
Also daily reminder locking shortcuts behind achievement diaries is literally stupid
---
You remember the BH2 update they did at the start of November 2019? Hahaha good times!
---
That indicates OP has a friend. Not sure about that.
---
I feel that the only way it would work is for volume trades, therefore not punishing legitimate players but acting as a gold sink for merchers and farmers (like a transaction fee).
---
Snipping tool youd just select what you want screenshotted and then literally copy and paste that snipping tool selection into reddit. You don't need to save the file or anything. And if you wanted your full monitor you could just print screen -&gt; open reddit -&gt; hit paste
---
thanks for commenting on a joke name. would u like a cookie mr reddit
---
Super defence is white berries and cadantine whilst a regular defence potion is ranarr and white berries.
---
My herblore level is still 3 so honestly it seems like a mistake I’d make
---
how? whats the risk?
---
walk me thru that 1 dipshit
---
Don’t You All Have PCs?LoL
---
I'm not gonna pull fake stats but its pretty high up there. There's very few things in this game that require multiple people. If I'm doing something that doesn't require multiple people, I don't have an obligation to talk to them. And the times I do, they are being fuck wits and purposely crashing my spot just to get a response or some shit.
---
Can you run a Twitch stream or YouTube video on one half of the screen, and OSRS on the other half?
---
That's why I go with a second set of bandos
---
You probably aren't a wealthy high level player lmao.
---
Get sent to Jagex for lethal injection.
---
If it makes you feel any better, you look like a cross between Thurgo and Brad Pitt
---
Honestly brother be happy of the progress you’ve made and name your Ironman something cool like died once and move on.  You can always make another one and use these mistakes to guide you.  Maybe next time get 43 prayer or afk fishing/cooking a bit longer so you don’t have to worry about it, either way good job with your progress.
---
Thank you for the info. 
---
I was thinking that because you are in combat you'll stay logged in, but you're saying you get forced logged out?
---
Convinced to play runescape? No, convinced to max runecrafting
---
yes
---
Oh so it’s kill based more than it is win based. Interesting.. thanks so much!
---
That's not his dad's degree. That is OP's degree.
---
Is this some normie problem that im too btw to understand?
---
what is game room
---
im sure the gold farmers love it
---
They probably changed the email associated with your account. You need to do a recovery request, which if accepted will disable authenticator and allow you to change your email.

Twisted league question: Will u reveal relics and how to achieve them before the the release on Thursday?

Damn, u must really like fire making.

Im not sure about the timing either. I use 330 as my default world so I dont have to hop often. If you are willing to use jewelery, you can use the slayer ring to the relekka slayer cave, or necklace of passing to wizard tower. Otherwise, GE to edgeville is probably the best
---
yeh its 50 minimum large coz u can get the plants/bones to mess it up
---
Can we combine the small medium and large rune pouches for runecraft? It's a bit of a hassle to open and close the bank interface for a small quantity compared to the large pouch
---
Yeah that would've been cool to have those rs memories in picture form
---
I mean u can just kill like 10 rats that insta respawn.
---
Oof this got alot of downvotes, its just how i play though xD

420/69 best white text I’ve ever read. You’re a real poet buckaroo 😎

**Twisted League predictions from the Sofa**
---
Twisted league will have come out 24 hours before the Q&amp;A. As such:
---
- what are you guys most excited for in the twisted lesgue?
---
- which path are you each intending to take?
---
- first 'master' achievement to be completed? And in how many days?
---
Etc, I'm sure you guys can come up with more interesting questions as a reply to this one.
---
Personally I would love to see tax on GE.
---
I know a lot people would hate it, but it would act as gold sink, and for those that dont want to pay tax, can do manual trading. This would also bring back oldschool trading areas, but for those who dont care about standing and selling items for hours, just pay tax and get it done.
---
because instant gratification
---
yeh instances take it out of bank alot of people dont know this at kraken so just crash
---
yes, it glitched into the black demon area, it happens sometimes, things spawn where they aren't meant to/ walk too far
---
I've heard the money's good, yeah, even if you're only half-decent at pvp and/or using a low-level build. And even if the value of BH points was to bottom out (unlikely, with maul handles and alchables in the shop), mysterious emblems can be exchanged for raw cash, keeping the value very stable.
---
Can something be done about the ease of stat restoration?  
---
Currently its way too easy to get back to full health and prayer without either a high Construction level or the Desert Elite dairy completed.
---
I would also like to see the POH pool nerfed, and then letting us "imbue" it with the Desert Amulet 4 to have it back as it is now, this would reward players who play the game.
---
The trading post before GE was even worse. Bot and alt and troll filled list of names u had to manually pm to arrange a meeting. 
---
I did love vanilla trading where u actually had to find the buyer.
---
It's not new, I agree, but monster drops have never been this bad.
---
This.
---
Back in the day death was real itemsink. Now nothing is leaving game for any reason. Which sucks and needs to be fixed.
---
While doing wintertodt on my UIM I was selling the cut gems to general store. Was a nice little cash boost
---
How easy is it to add instancing to boss areas from development perspective? Could perhaps Zalcano get clan chat instancing option like corp?
---
Yeah, I'm not gonna respond to you anymore. Have fun in your angry little world where everyone is a problem except for yourself.
---
Why are there still non PVP activities in the Wilderness?  
---
This is the sole reason that PVP polls fail.
---
Removing non PVP stuff from the area would allow for straight up PVP vs PVP fights, which is what everyone wants.
---
Why should I as a normal player doing clues vote for something that just makes it even easier for a clan to kill me?
---
Obviously some things like Mage Arena 2 bosses and Black Chins would have to be re balanced, while things like Revs and the Wilderness Altar should stay in the Wilderness.
---
i don't buy gold. i'd wager that barely anyone on this sub buys gold. people who buy gold don't give a fuck about the integrity of the game. people that sell gold don't give a fuck about the integrity of the game. this post is useful to exactly zero people. 
---
there isn't a whole lot jagex can do about it either without the legit players suffering for it. anyone who thinks jagex could just "make a better bot detection system" has no idea wtf they're talking about.
---
OK? doesn't change that fact that it's one of the easiest 99s
---
That's just Venezuela
---
How is being shit and progressing slow fun? Never understood that meme.
---
I’m over 2200 and I wouldn’t consider mine “very good” either.
---
Statistical impossibility means nothing to Runescape players.
---
Can we add the collection log to the hi-score page? We have all the skills and number of clues completed. I think it would be a nice thing to add

I know it’s not the rarest pet but it’s only my second pet ever so when I saw it drop I was pumped
---
Okay agreed but I think that desert elite is asking a bit much. What about a rework of the rewards for the desert diary in general, moving the nardah tele to the hard rewards and adding something cool (improvement to ancients? ) to the elite diary?
---
You can remove it by dying in the white portal. World 2 usually has plenty of people messing around in there. Attack someone, die and you'll lose your skull.
---
it doesnt matter tho, its not like someone just guess ur password and get through ur 2fa and shit??
---
Facts
---
The hero we needed
---
Not lying. He asked about menu entry swapper multiple times. No amount of stating ‘if it’s in runelite, it’s compliant’ was getting to stop repeating the same question and asking admins directly when the support team also answered it.
---
It's a gold sink to the economy, because of the 'tax' on winnings the arena takes
---
Yeah I had this badass one and my neighbor had one and youd swipe cards through them for special abilities and make them fight. 
---
Don’t know if these are those but they remind me of it lol
---
The poll said in both questions they would access the same inventory. Those people didn't read past the first sentence.
---
Obviously make the requirement for money snake 70 mining so people will bot mining for money snake? Big brain hours.
---
There's a difference between being bad and playing inefficiently. Like sure I could have made my account and gone to wintertodt and blasted put 99 FM because thats the efficient thing to do but it's also super boring and unenjoyable. People who get 99 FM while they have low hp aren't 'better' players they just play efficiently. You have a really bad mindset. I can't imagine shitting on someone because they play differently to me (if it has no impact on my gameplay)
---
Rs and other games were my english teachers too. I learned english basics from school, rest i learned from games and friends.
---
All of them.
---
Should I make a cannonball alt? If not, what then?
---
Yeah its about time
---
Lol and I died with a bp. I need to go reevaluate myself
---
The idea behind the Desert Elite diary is the easy teleport to Nardah to pray at the Elidinis Statuette.
---
Triantos is a pretty laid back time. We all love bandos too!
---
I remember back in the days when quick chat was used to make jokes alot people would meme with this
---
Bro I had a dream I got a craws bow drop at revs. Was so mad when I woke up
---
Would never happen. Period.
---
No. Not really. But thanks for asking :)
---
Never gonna lose my untrimmed agi cape.
---
Have hope my brother... have hope...
---
No, because there is a 20 minute logout timer, put in place to stop people setting up splashing for 6 hours while they go out.
---
On android at least, you can go off the app and leave it in the background and stay logged in, but the OS may also kill the background process to save battery/memory, in which case you'll get logged out.
---
yes but back in rs2 they were worth about 800mil which is why many of your characters interactions with him was you asking for his hat
---
This is awkward, just looked it up and I am 10 minutes from one.
---
What a qt3.14
---
No it doesnt.
---
Turning on single mouse button and using two fingers for the menu options has gotten me better XP rates than with a mouse and keyboard. I just feel like I can do everything more quickly and with less errors, like pickpocketing the bandit immediately after a failed blackjack so he doesn't initiate combat.
---
Security question:
---
  
---
can Hans give the player a warning before showing the time play on the account to explain that sharing the details of how old your account is can lead to hijacking through recovery questions? It is one of the steps required to recover an account.
---
I see it all too often that people innocently share a screenshot of how long they've played on their account and in the same screenshot, there will be their creation date. I don't think people are aware.
---
I think it would make people mad who’ve completed a lot of items and bosses before the log came out so it doesn’t register.
---
Do you not look at your stats ever..?
---
The green name over their head really ruins the mood.
---
I think he means to bring up it's "farmer" and not "farming."
---
I didn't know zammy colors were blue
---
Very epic
---
Google flinch elvarg
---
being banned, the reason it was changed like that is because people would deliberately grief others mostly streamers, People would sit outside the room for 15+ minutes, wait till corp was almost dead then quickly run in and dark bow spec it for the guaranteed damage so the iron didn't get the loot.People still got banned for this but people doing care about throwing the time investment away on a low risk ban where you pretty much had to target a popular streamer for it to happen
---
Targetted harassment being bannable is why other irons don't do it to each other,if you do it once you'll be fine but if they just keep doing it to the same person following them around you'll get banned. People don't do it iron's cause most people who have invested enough time into a iron to be able to grief at corp aren't stupid to risk a ban
---
Yeah but that's basically the entire game anyway.
---
Implement as QOL
---
If you think the sentence is wrong, it's correct. If you read over it quicky you prolly thought that it had to be farming, but then the sentence would be you must be level 13 farming to plant those.
---
He’s just so magical✨
---
Yeah I didn’t mean what I said. I meant to convey that it would take a long time to experience all the content of the game, and that lends itself to making the game harder on beginners. There’s go so much stuff locked behind so many requirements in this game that it can be really difficult to figure out how to do things in the first place if you haven’t (a) done it before, or (b) have someone experienced walk you through it the first time. I couldn’t imagine starting my first RS account and trying to do endgame content within a month of experience lol, especially with minimum requirements.
---
Moar.
---
Touche on them taking out free trade and the wildy. Wasnt exactly a good way to end bots and rwt... 
---
Also I solo PK without issues. Occasionally run into teams...but most are just 2-3 people. Still fun and I still profit a bit.
---
*Can we get warning/confirmation message when trying to start tracking new Herbiboar while already tracked Herbiboar is still laying on ground unharvested?*
---
It's very furstrating when you missclick inspect on object next to Herbiboar that you are trying to harvest. (Herbiboar vanishes when new tracking is started)
---
Is there any other instances of this? Referring it to Farmer
---
Looting bag, not rune pouch
---
But actually though. Like it is literally the culture of osrs. Better complain about bots and gold traders than a dead game.
---
I think this could work
---
I only kept track of the amount of scales I used because I took them from the loot stack. About 22k scales. died approximately 82 times, mainly because I streamed it and would get distracted sometimes :( Vork is more consistent loot imo.
---
honestly, I've never once lost connection to this game worse case is where the game lags for about 1-second and comes back
---
Take the upvote. First RS meme to make me laugh lmfao
---
Hey guys what happens if I press the screenshot button on runelite on my ancient MacBook pro?
---
HandsUp
---
Just let it happen - Durial
---
Can Ardougne Diaries allow for more money bags while looting in Ardougne? Maybe allowing up to 56 per inventory for players who have completed the Ardy hard or elite diaries.
---
It's official, we've hit rock bottom.
---
i feel like that's more about the store needs to get a cut of the profit
---
we need the pvp world style pj timer in the wilderness to make these clans less powerful
---
Your ass hole
---
OSRS has a gigantic unmentioned problem with high leveled scammers. Not everyone might know about them since they target people with really valuable items like tbows, but whenever you enter the G.E. with a tbow equipped people will come at you and try to become your friend through all means possible; including pms, saying they'll teach you end-game pvm, discord voice chat, or faking friendships with jmods to seem important. I've heard of many people losing banks to these lurers/scammers, these are people that have been playing for a while and quit forever because they lose something they worked on for a long time in the blink of an eye. 
---
I ran into one myself who tried to lure me which i wrote this post about:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dcuagd/dear\_mod\_roq\_you\_are\_being\_used/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/dcuagd/dear_mod_roq_you_are_being_used/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
This scammer is still doing his thing and I couldn't report him for whatever he had done since he had not spoken in game recently. Players like these are most likely real world traders and a cancer to this game.
---
My question then is: Can we have some attention to the long living sickness this game has that are scammers/lurers? The reporting system does simply not work well enough and a lot of these scams have evolved into a psychological manipulation of your playerbase.
---
GP sure, but the GP is also lost due to emblems sometimes being lost. You could also say that GP flooded in from previous BH as well due to being able to obtain alchables via the shop. Duel arena also takes out more gp than what is being brought in via BH...despite the current boosting.
---
Items, they are all consumables and are actively used by the pkers that get the crates. Which, the items are the supplies that have sky rocketed. Only item that hasn't is ornate maul, which it's intended price point was around 400k-500k...and not the 1.4m that it was at.
---
Not really dead content. You were barely able to get into games anyway. 
---
Now, people get into games almost always. The price w ill go back up eventually.
---
Probably on woodcutting tbh, farming even longer i guess
---
The same thing happens with me at Kraken, always end up wanking myself into a coma
---
Serp-zot Slayer guard
---
nono, there isn't but I made that mistake the first time too when I read it quickly, I was like lol 13 farmer, but I read over 'a' and then suddenly it made sense, it's kinda weird because these level requirements are normally described in their skilling name instead of the profession of the skill
---
Well since you’re leveling up the Farming skill technically speaking you are a ‘Farmer’. So the sentence isn’t wrong my guy. You’re just thinking way to hard about it so you can do a “unplayable” meme that’s getting old and over used.
---
Kappa
---
Except it’s only massive bot farms that reach the numbers you posted in title? I know you’re upset but gathering random numbers that were tossed around and making a post claiming it’s reality is just hilarious
---
Like actually listen to yourself, you’re comparing basic pvm to bot farms. Do you have anything to say about zulrah bots? Item spawn gathering bots? Literally every other bot in game exploiting anything they can(which is literally everything) for gp?
---
Redditors man...redditors
---
Can we put our Mutagens on it?
---
The nature talisman was my favorite!
---
OP isn't saying the game is dead, they're just saying they want to revive dead content. Some good examples of dead content that's in the collection log: the Rum Deal minigames purchaseables, the crabs from Pirate Pete's recipe for disaster subquest drop uniques, stuff like that. There's no reason you'd do them right now, except to see the completion tick up. If there was competition between players it would also give sit a more enjoyable feeling.
---
It wouldn't be good for Jagex to kill their owns employee(s)
---
Wow, you looked so young and full of hope back then. It's a shame that it all went downhill from there.
---
Go Cats! (This season has been tough to watch D: )
---
Take the content out of the wilderness I believe was the message, so your free for all is against people who want to participate in it.
---
What am i looking for?
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
Thought the same thing.
---
gottem
---
What existing skilling content and what existing PvM content are you content devs most pleased or proud of?
---
This is the best looking piece of joke gear I've seen posted on here.
---
You know u Can interact with friends 10 seconds before or after that shortcut?
---
slayer helm of voiditeznot
---
It was tough but easily the most fun quest I’ve done in game
---
I’ll be voting no on all pvp updates.
---
Yeah those were the ones you swiped cards for power ups
---
No. I asked this question and it made it onto a qa probably 2-2.5 years ago now
---
Unreadable
---
I put on Chernobyl and Barry and alched from like 70 to 80 Magic in a day. I just set up a huge stack, taped over the mouse laser, and alternated clicking with either hand and either foot. With a pedal or other device it's even easier but I didn't have one handy
---
i got mine at 3 kc as well :)
---
Offers will time out after about a week. This will never complete unless you make a new offer every so often
---
Soon™
---
Found the BH farmer
---
Player vs. player vs. player vs. player (PvP vs. PvP) as you put it is not what everyone wants. A lot of PKers enjoy killing PvMers in the wilderness. In my opinion, that also makes for the most entertaining PvP YouTube videos.
---
I never participate in PvP myself, but I like the inherent risk in venturing into the wilderness. Deciding on new gear setups, balancing risk and DPS, the way my heart starts pounding when I see white dots on the minimap. It's all part of the game that I love, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
I could obviously do without getting killed when I do a wilderness clue step. I carry no risk, so there's no incentive for me to flee, and the PKer gets nothing out of it either. But I don't want wilderness bosses or wilderness slayer moved to safe locations.
---
you just achieved comedy!
---
Can also take the bars and smith dart tips for additional profit. gives you something afk to do after too
---
Would it be technically possible to have a "no skulling" option in the player attack options? It should, in some way, interrupt you when performing an action that would have skulled you.
---
Personally I tried lance at vorkath and found it too tedious. Getting meleed + range you take a lot more damage than just getting maged. I don't woox walk anyway because my shitty internet almost inevitably gets me hit.
---
That's true. But hey hard diaries are a good goal to have. Try to get them all done.
---
Who are you to say who’s addicted and who’s not. Encourage people who are addicted to get help, don’t fight new content because some people have a problem.
---
realism doesn't matter, since you can eat entire shark in 1 bite
---
Early this week I read on reddit that you shut down 2 goldselling websites. Is that true?
---
You're playing it wrong.

Yes, but that's possible xp waste, my friend. These specific ten seconds are wasted either way. Just let me talk to my totally real, Canadian girlfriend during that time.
---
Why would game change and waste previous dev tome just for one person needs?
---
you sound like a fun mmo player as well
---
You'll get a feel for how the game controls and the tick system as you play. Tick manipulation is advanced skilling (2 tick teaks, 1t karambwans, 3 tick mining) and prayer flicking is also good to know. I'm sure you can find some YouTube guides if you want to learn them
---
Just be aware that at least for skilling, it's a lot more effort than regular skilling, so it might not be worth it if you just want to chill
---
some black  shape
---
the rock is shaped like a penis

FYI: the helmet is a mash of slayer helm, void melee helm, serp helm , justiciar helm and neitznot faceguard

I have been working on those recently.  I had to grind out full prospector for Fally hard so I took a break after that.  I've got a good bit of the hards done.
---
Yessir. It’s also why I’ve kept the Dramen staff, easiest way to travel to off island tasks

It has 4 bits of entropy. That's pathetic.

Slaytiznot

People are mining iron instead of wanking so it's too crowded?
---
But you would also need to do lunar diplomacy...that’s quite a lot of exceptions for a zeah only
---
Lms would be botted without twitch prime. The minigame is not member exclusive... However, something needs to be done to prevent all these bots. Bots that to me should be easily dectectable, as most of them act in a similar way. If these bots could be detected within an hour of playing the minigame, I think most of these farms would stop. Some of the bots just seems so basic that I feel like this should be possible...
---
RWT is RWT regardless of how you do it.
---
I find this to be incredibly stupid
---
Obviously I’m estimating here, I’m clearly not trying to make it seem like I have some secret statistical analysis I’m quoting.

I’m including dice bots, money doublers, and beggers in my estimation.

---
Unless that’s what you mean by “zeah based”
---
Iirc MMK said so many people buy gold that banning them would remove a significant portion of the playerbase. Especially since most people buy in relatively small quantities that don't justify banning thousands upon thousands of accounts
---
The Brimhaven Agility Arena used to be active before more efficient or more rewarding agility content were released. Do you want to boost the Agility Arena?
---
This is beyond top tier lmfao
---
yes but its many times faster
---
If you can wait for 75 range + blowpipe jad will be significantly easier. The more prayer you can get the better as well since it increases the prayer points recovered from prayer pots and super recover potions.
---
Guidesforusall would be number 1 for sure lol

It’s a ballsack
---
Can we make f2p slayer with vanakka and the wildy slayer girl?
---
Mother of god you've fallen so deep into the runescape hole that you don't even separate it from real life anymore
---
It’s the “Player Indicator” plug-in on the RuneLite client. A green name displaying over a players head is the default setting for someone who is on your friends list.
---
This is the real gold sink content we need
---
KBD used to drop BiS gear. Nobody has ever forced PVMers into the wilderness to make it active.  The wilderness is low requirement content for high reward.  Why is it low requirement? Because PKers are what make obtaining high GP/h rates difficult.  Unlike boss mechanics you have to be truely good at the game to get away. SO LONG AS THE CONTENT IS DEVELOPED PROPERLY.  If jagex develops piss poor content such as the one released.  Then obviously its going to look bad.  I could make all sorts of poorly implemented PvM updates, but there are so goddamn many its easy to negate the poorly implemented ones. The wilderness recieves next to no updates and the ones that do get handicapped by vote issues.
---
Back in 2007 PvM death meant you lose all your items except for 3 if unskulled.  This meant PvP and PvM death were treated the same.  Since PvM death is no longer dangerous and you keep all your items guaranteed.   Wilderness death becomes alot harsher and the rewards less appealing.  
---
If anything, we need to address the current "temporary" unpolled death mechanics that in my opinion are pitting the community against itself.
---
There's a few ammonite crabs on the northern part of fossil island that make interacting with the boat really annoying, especially on mobile. Can something be done about that?
---
Could we get a unique teleport animation for the Quest Cape? I've really enjoyed the tp animations for the diary items and I think it would be a nice addition to the game.
---
&gt;Pvp is a critical aspect of osrs
---
*doubt*
---
Hi mom
---
Hahahahahahaha.
---
No, they're not, you don't have to go for comp cape lmao. It can function like a max cape.
---
Lol

So don't add a neat hiscore because it could never be done 100%?

nice
---
I mean doing lavas can get you up to 70k an hour and really isn’t that bad, especially compared to abyss.
---
Nope, you have no kill power
---
Bet you only need a simple requirement of void to kill it. I really hope they start making tier 80-85 stuff soon.
---
Explain how a cape working like the Max cape would be a mistake. Probably because you couldn't get it and don't want others to have it either.
---
I'm surprised theres no Inferno spectate mode tbh
---
Sounds like you already know the answer. The amount of players that want to see this game stagnate outweighed the amount of players that would like new content. They may repoll it down the line as they have with other content, but it could be a few years.
---
This but unironically. RS was not designed for PvP, and it never will be good.
---
You never loose money if you don’t sell the gear.
---
Do wildmudkip and every devious video ever lol
---
Ah OK. Well if its an engine spaghetti code thing we are probably out of luck. When the spaghettis cooked the spaghettis cooked.
---
Unfortunately not. For updates like a new skill I think Jagex should just add it without Polling. We're missing out on a lot of great updates
---
It's a vicious cycle:
---
\&gt; pkers want wildy targets 
---
\&gt; pvm content added to wildy 
---
\&gt; pvmers try out wildy pvm 
---
\&gt; pkers 1way pk pvmers 
---
\&gt; pvmers lose interest in wildy pvm and potentially spite vote 
---
\&gt; wildy dead 
---
\&gt; pkers want wildy targets

IMO the meta in PvPvE has shifted over the years in games in general, but I think it's even worse in a game like OSRS due to how there's a disparity in investment depending on one's incentive. As a pvmer, I dont wan't to bring only 3-4 decent items and the rest be ones I'm willing to lose by chance just to get my kills. As a pker, I don't want to invest time and resources into a higher chance of net loss than pvm content. 
---
They're a different target audience at this point, and should have separate incentives based off that. The wilderness should provide some of the best PVP related content and rewards, not pvm. And vice versa. Having said all that, I know it's not easy task to find a happy medium where pvmers and pvpers can all agree while maintaining balance and preventing exploits.
---
Rather not. Farm runs .
---
If toxic trident is too expensive I would just use the regular trident it is much cheaper than the toxic to use, but is still pretty good.
---
Forgot Fighter hat
---
Wow this sucks. Never really thought about that, hopefully the devs put some thought into this. I dont think the plugin was really unfair anyway as the colors of the ghosts already tell u what to pray anyway lol, it really was just QOL
---
Imbued msb with rune arrows for range on typical low Def bosses is what I did for a little bit too afk range.
---
Bruh this is giving me the same vibe as the RS3 invention concept images lmao   
---
(referring to this [concept art](https://runescape.wiki/images/a/a8/Lvl_90_weapons_2_hand.png?2abb1). None of them were brought into the game tho.)
---
I personally didn't enjoy the concept because I didn't want to deal with another buyable; with that being said it was a well though out, interesting, concept. I don't believe we'll see a new skill in any foreseeable future.
---
I've backed myself into a slayer corner as I don't have enough points to skip.  Spiritual Creatures at lvl 70 slayer so no mages.  I've never been to GWD, recommendations?    
---
I'm 100 combat, 79 mage &amp; 83 range.  Was thinking about safespotting Zammy warriors with a blowpipe.
---
I mean, you got snow in some places, but I think that's the extent of it?
---
Could you look into permanently opening tournament worlds?  They allow people to gain the skills needed for Pking and PvMing, enable all sorts of community events, and are a fun break from the grind of the main game.
---
If you want to prevent people from spending all their time in these worlds, you could simply have a moderate fee to use them (eg 200k/hr which drains whenever you are logged into the world like blast furnace).
---
Psst thats cause they give 14 days not 30 psst.
---
I think Chaps Fanatic pet rate is like 1/1000. It's one of the pet sources that are more likely to drop. 
---
Still, this is pretty good stuff. Congrats! I'm hoping to find a way to snag the chaos ele pet also.
---
What constitutes completion? If that ever comes out people are just going to complain about the requirements like rs3 players.
---
Can we please look at dead content? Hydra Tail is an example of brand new dead content. T Hammers is a big one though, there are plenty of others. Would be awesome to do a few weeks of looking at dead content at some point.
---
Regular trident, it'll pay for itself. Anything lower wouldn't be worth it at your combat.
---
it's like when people post a reaction as something.jpg, they don't have computers so no jpg, so they use papyrus or paper.
---
If it's for a clan event and you want any chance of being competitive just use the trident
---
I feel like the general consensus is that a new skill is welcome. Warring just wasn’t it for a lot of people.
---
Yeah I noticed. This last week has been the first time in just about forever and I was shocking to not see any new skills.
---
Oh yeah definitely one of the easiest pet to get, just thought it was amusingly low kcs in both cases
---
Its the same thing that makes you not use a period on this comment. Yes you know how, but no its not worth the effort to you OR you like the way the comment looks without a period. Either way, who gives a fuck? get over yourself
---
Probably because I don’t keep my wealth in GP, I’ll sell something if I need to by something that’s more than a few mill
---
Finna rake it up and harvest that gp
---
Yikes. You’ve got a lot of mental fantasies that just aren’t true.
---
Here are the facts - The PVP area of the game has the express ability to economically affect the whole of the community in game. It therefore follows that everyone should have a say in what happens.
---
It isn’t a matter of people forcing Jagex to come up with rewards if none get passed. It’s a matter of no one wanting there to be rewards in the first place. Jagex consistently attempts to create PVM involved Wildy content despite a lack of support from much of the community. This is imperative in understanding the perspective of people who use their vote in order to vote against content they dislike.
---
As much as the PVP community may desire restricted voting, it is not an ethical fashioned idea. The premise of voting is that everyone gets to vote and I would not feel comfortable having a completely separate segment of the game which could be abused to effect the rest of the game, be controlled by a segment of players. I prefer that everyone has a voice.
---
I love the idea of making completionist stuff like this visible on highscores and ranked.
---
Pls elaborate
---
Lmfao my desk is almost like that now
---
You can use bones at the same speed with the default client. Just requires more needless clicking.
---
Fossil island only ultimate ironman when?
---
I would recommend point boosting until you can build a nice block list and have some points to start skipping. Get yourself sorted with a slayer planner spread sheet once you get a decent amount of points.

---
Oh no you cant kill a dude for free? Stop being a playground bully and pick on someone your own size eg other people there for pvp
---
Well that's kind of what I mean. Getting these capes changes the way you see and play the game. Of course maxed players don't want new skills, they don't want the thing they worked so hard on to obtain to be taken away from them. That's just human behaviour. I don't blame them from spite voting because this kind of content where requirements can change in the future only promotes this kind of behaviour. It's just going to be 100x worse with a comp cape.

The official forums are the best place to find clans. There should be a looking for clan thread you can post your account details to, people will contact you if they want to recruit you
---
99 Fletch was my first 99 in 2008 so I was determined to grab that juicy cape again, plus I enjoy RS for the afk Skilling factor over combat
---
Back then, they went hand and hand. 
---
Botters were purchasing credit card information off of the dark web, and using those credit card numbers to fraudulently create members accounts. They were creating several memberships under each card, so it was a major red flag for the actual owner of the card. These people would dispute the charges, Jagex lost that revenue due to forced refunds, and then Jagex was hit with fees on top of that. 
---
Then when bots sold off their gold to RWT websites, players would purchase this gold, and were at risk of having their credit card number stolen as well. Some RWT companies back then would double dip, and capitalize on every bit of info they could get their hands on. 
---
RWT companies don’t steal credit info anymore, as the laws have gotten significantly stricter, and more enforced. Fraud isn’t much of an issue anymore, since they can bond bots for membership now.
---
What's the issue with lootshare? Short of trusting people I don't see any other option. It's nice to have as an option.
---
Sure for a main it's not. But when you just want to make money afk on your main and have a LMS "alt" that you are practicing your tribrid switches on, 100-200 hours is a lot of time to train an account that you're just going to send to lms
---
Boss high scores would be awesome as well but oldschool very rarely gets web team time.
---
He has plenty. Ends the stream with nothing left in bank plus billions in debt, starts the stream with like 500m-1b and stakes with that. What more do you need?
---
When we can equip goblin mail
---
Hit 3700kc yesterday hunting the mutagen. I’ve gotten the pet 3 times. I. JUST. WANT. MY. MUTAGEN. Gz tho.
---
My main got hacked for a little while when I stopped playing, recovered my account and had 99 str and was a green dragon bot.
---
I still don’t know how I feel about that 99 I didn’t get but have.
---
Ah OK. Different. I still feel the same way in general though.
---
Black salamander plus void.
---
Me too, my iron is 65 combat right now but about to have 3 skilling 99s
---
Man I can't not see a giant mustache on the front. And that's ok.
---
Lol buying gold and buying bonds with that gold is way cheaper than buying membership. Your post reeks of entitlement nobody’s going to spoonfeed you
---
Yeah I am disgusted with how much I don't hate this.
---
You never started discussing. You were a dick from the start. 
---
You ended your first comment with "bro" like you knew better than everyone else, then told me the whales at Jagex are pleased with me lining their pockets. And then you keep on actively taunting.
---
And if you think I'm triggered, you have no idea what triggered means. That's just you trying to convince yourself you've accomplised your goal of being annoying and gotten a rouse out of someone.
---
The fact is that you're only an idiot stating some obvious shit that's not as easy as they sound, while being a condecending prick, thinking you're taking the high road.
---
And if you don't even understand, you've been instulting since your first comment. But you might be both too toxic and stupid to realise.
---
Is colourblind Ness the reason why  melee nylos are white and not red?
---
I voted against it because overall I did not think it was a good skill. I liked the new mage robes and am glad some (dagonhai) have entered the game. I like the idea of making magic robes too, but honestly that sounds like a combination of crafting and runecrafting (imbuing). I wouldn't make that into a skill. 
---
For me personally I'd want a new skill that actually feels like something new. I heard Sailing was polled and failed a while ago, but I think that is something I would have voted yes to.
---
How do you know he was angry and not just letting you take his spot cos he’s nice?
---
Definitely not triggered at all
---
When you say teleblock you mean someone runs up to you with a baton and breaks your knees.
---
You spelled salmone wrong
---
Will any action be taken against people abusing BH with alts considering it's against the rules to rig minigames with alts?
---
That’s only like 20m tho
---
Yeah ok, like PVP loot is consistent and everyone who PK's is operating on a loss. That's not true at all. You want it to be easy money.  That only comes from killing people with risk.
---
That is The Bloat from the second raid, Theater of Blood (one of the bosses you fight in it).
---
The game is not dead but is certainly losing players at the moment, possibly due to the lack of good content and extremely slow development of gameplay updates.
---
That makes sense I guess, didnt think about bridding there on an alt. Good idea!
---
Not much tbh, if this is your first day back then, you probably missed bounty hunter but im not gonna go into details cause you probably know whats happening.
---
That's true, I'd say it's near impossible to appeal to everyone's interests.
---
From the picture, I don’t see anything suggesting this person being aggressive? Seems like you overreacted
---
Can you change hill moss and fire giant slayer tasks to simply "giant" task
---
Easy solution: grace periods. Next.
---
&gt;some bosses being dumbed down
---
Laughs in Solak
---
&gt;It ruined minigames by having compers just sitting there afk. 
---
People do that anyways in CW in OSRS, and it's not like it can't be removed. You can't AFK the others unless you pay to leech.
---
Once again, people will bitch, complain and argue about anything regardless if Comp exists or not, this is NOT a good excuse as much as you want it to be. 
---
This whole game promotes unhealthy habits if you want to keep bringing that up considering it's the most grindiest game out there, so no, a comp cape would hardly make it worse considering how few people would go for it.
---
Their support is actually very helpful for billing. You lost access to your account. Now you have to go through the proper channels.
---
If you want to make that assumption, go for it. Didn’t know there was a wiki though so I’ll start there, thanks!
---
I can agree with that. I haven't bothered with wildy since like 2011 when strong metas were established. Gear setups became efficient. Risk became minimal. Fights became methodical. 
---
Despite adding 20 different methods of spawning GP in wildy it's still not rejuvenated by Jagex's standards of the community. By my own standards it's as rejuvenated as it will ever be. It's not an easy task admittedly. Looking at you BH bot farms!
---
In my opinion, the wilderness doesn't need rejuvenated, runescape PvP as a whole needs rejuvenated. I've actually thought that scrapping the wilderness entirely and starting from scratch would've been a better route than these band aids on a severed arm.
---

---
Sure why not.
---
Most of that is pretty easy actually. Just dont do drugs and dont buy gold, its not that hard not to intentionally fuck your life
---
Yeah, the dude wasn't aggressive at all.
---
Ohh shiiit i definitely did lmfaoo, im coming off an overnight shift havent slept all night. I feel dumb now
---
Ask the Japanese, they always have good ideas for tentacled sea life.
---
Yeah I really haven't put a lot of thought into it but I'd just love to see a system where we could see completion type stuff. It doesn't really matter to me if its the cape or the collection log hiscores
---
This post right here officer
---
bro, watch your language, only farming 99 homies have the Dibba card
---
Turn on longrange when u get to the healers to hit from farther away. This will help u avoid jads melee distance. Hit them once, line them up so only one healer is hittinf you and go bCk to killing jad
---
Just because that's how it was in 2007 doesn't mean that's how it should be. No one wants to lose hours and hours of progress because of a lag spike.
---
I think Paul No Life did something similar after getting all 99s. He just does 1 skill over and over until 200M from the 13M that is 99
---
Think they hit like 14 or 16 every time without protection. So with several on him he would have died instantly.
---
No
---
Does nobody even read the comment chain they're replying to? For the third time, I support adding this to the high scores. I'm just correcting him saying someone would complete it.
---
I think what you're saying is really interesting - it's not the wilderness that pits people against each other, it's the different death mechanics. That being said, I don't see a drastic change to the death mechanics like you're suggesting coming ever. DCscape is too prevalent.
---
Tagging all the healers and trying to kill them all can get messy and take awhile. After you have them aggroed, run a bit so they form a straight line. Will leave one attacking you but all 4 off Jad. MUCH easier to deal with and even 1 def pures can survive this way.
---
Here’s what I did when I was lower level.
---
1.	Get to Jad
---
2.	when healers come out, Aggro all of them to stop them for healing jad.
---
3.	find a spot and run through jad. To do this correctly, wait for jad to attack and then run through him to the other side. You’ll have 7-8 game ticks (0.6 seconds=1 tick) til his next attack.
---
finally i can represent nzoth in runescape.
---
quality content
---
I’ve been there brother just hit 91 the other day. Set a goal for a slayer lvl like 91 for cerb. Or dark beast but there pretty much useless at this point in the game unless your an Ironman. Maybe try and do some Wildy slayer or Konar to stock pile some point so you don’t have to do the shitty tasks.
---
Then only bring 3-4 items if you arent confident in your abilities to survive
---
i legit want to make an IRL-RS cookbook now...
---
No, they dont.
---
Face in the pillow

I'm not colorblind but I have a hard time seeing the difference between the blue and green ghosts, especially while focused on cerbs other attacks
---
I only remember it was before 2017 because I quit around 2017 and around they changed Corp or zulrah drops and I was watching mmorpg
---
I can't tell what's dirtier, the way you're sitting, or that keyboard and mousepad.
---
I kind of assumed the BH update was Jagex trying to slowly move PvP to designated worlds, that way they can start restricting PvP polls, as they won't have any effect on players outside of those worlds.
---
I will check it out! Thank you!!
---
Being an Ironman always makes slayer exciting, currently 92 slay
---
Sounds great! Thank you. Will check it out
---
devalues spades then, pkers gonna be pissed
---
Really gives that old school feel
---
No you're right, the jmods who accidentally spawned tbows, gave everyone max cash, instakilled half the people in the DMM finals, hacked accounts and RWTed the gp are certainly not as much of a clown fiesta as the RS3 mods. Certainly not the jmods that this sub needs a drama calander to keep up with all the bullshit they do. I'm really glad Kiren said that because if there's one thing jagex does well, it's keeping their promises.   
---
 
---
Also raids is easy and vorago can be massed.
---
huehuehuehuehue
---
DCung was just as prevelant.  You bring 3-4 items and the rest are risked.   Think about the price of dragon and mid tier armor if this happened.  Theyd actually have use even in endgame since your confidence determines gohe risk
---
hhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Pooped my plateskirt

&gt; Max rates at level 99 tick perfect is 406k

I saw this superior for the first time ever the other night whilst on task - how does it look like anything other than a giant scrotum?

Had to pay 750 Slayer points for the damn thing and it's rarely worth taking anymore

Don’t apologize. Just do yourself a favor and order from them

I'm gonna print this out and turn it into a book. Make a complete collection of these stories and pass them onto my kids when I die. Chef hat guy will go down in history.

Wow how did I not even think of this😂 will have another go and try to line the healers up so ones hitting me. Fingers crossed🤞🏼
---
You named 2 Jmods, and in both scenarios people got refunded and the game was rolled back. Try again.
---
I mean, I'm sitting here arguing with a guy who has a brain issue in which he feels forced to play a game to get a cosmetic pixel cape.

It was cool
---
Devalues my pre-collection log completionist ironman
---
Ok now this is epic 😎
---
He's doing the "hotline bling"
---
Be sure to post your sexy new cape
---
This man is using a $10 markers to color runescape shit. The madlad.
---
And pvm affects pvp aswell. Bulwark was one of the worst items for pvp to ever enter the game. 
---
Who cares if there is a negligible issue ‘affecting’ the rest of the game, when pvp is... PART OF THE GAME. If you didnt spite vote we’d actually have good pvp updates and jagex would actually want to put effort into it.  Imagine if in the 3 years we waited for BH update, it was actually worked on, and not suddenly rushed and put together in 2 months time?  We’d have engine updates, new uniques, fun content, and something likely larger in scale than CoC.  You might ACTUALLY LIKE IT then!!  
---
Pvmers brought this upon pvpers and then want to blame pking for the shit show they created in the first place as proof of why pvp shouldnt get updates.  
---
Honestly cba with knuckle draggers like you.
---
Ely will soon be in the system of the sancasino then, never to leave it.
---
This is amazing to read
---
Ah yes, very OP for spending thousands of hours to get it. What's your point? It would function exactly like Max cape so it's essentially cosmetic.
---
Have they been polled in osrs? Havent noticed
---
How do you setup the NPCs exactly? I keep getting caught even though I'm clicking when they align shown in vid
---
WoUlDn'T ThAt bE nIcE?
---
It would solve every issue there is with PVP.
---
Non PVPers don't have any reason to vote no for PVPers, and PVPers get to fight people willing to fight back.

You can afk profit making Rune Legs/Skirts/2hs at 99, hardly useless.

awesome id be willing to check it out

"Cancel by Card" is an option for specifically this reason
---
Construction contracts pls
---
And stick a dragon stone on the forehead
---
Heavily agree.  Knuckle dragging mongoloids downvoting you are gunna have a rough fucking time when death mechanics are finally reverted and they lose their bank dying to vorkath and zulrah, and their 3rd party clients that practically play the game for them and spoon feed them everything are also banned.
---
If you're using a macbook you can do command+space bar, search for screenshot and you can then right click save to desktop or wherever you want to aswel.
---
Nah, my true osrs journey starts from here.
---
I'd disagree with The Division. Their concept of the Dark Zone works really well as a PvPvE environment and its problems were never with how the community approached that content, but how well the devs balanced gear sets.
---
Okay so technically a 1/500 chance of chompy chick is easier than 1/300 from chaos ele, but lets not forget that chompy chick is locked behind western elite diary. This means that to even have a chance at compy chick you must have 93 slayer, 85 thieving, 85 agility, 85 fletching, and you must kill zulrah + thermonuclear smoke devil first. Sure, its easier to get chompy chick once all prerequisites are completed, but to say its an easier monster drop pet to get is a bold statement lol
---
Point boosting = Turael x9 and then Konar every 10th?  Expeditious bracelets for the Turael tasks?
---
Ok jagex mod
---
LMS Reward and back when Venenatis and Callisto were introduced.
---
Polling wasn’t the primary issue here. It was poor implantation and the lack of proper QA in releasing a heavily exploitable piece of content.
---
macroing major in 2015
---
That boy has followed me to help fightthe Dark Wizards. Definitely a good boy.
---
3rd age stuff, raids items, and dragon hunter items
---
Wdym there are literally 'kill 46 dogs' slayer tasks in this game. You can also abandon your cat for 100/200 death runes.
---
Those badboys are still going for 30m+. Choo choo!
---
It's the new butterfly net only instead of ruining pures they're ruining HCIM.

Thank you :p

Why can you only buy two things with minerals in the mining guild, can we get something else to buy like gem packs in motherlode.
---
They've given them Santa hats before I think, I'm talking every battlestff run I want to see these Units
---
because people complain about profit all the time. I mean look at Saracnis. New boss drops a good crush weapon, but is dead content. If you are not making bank on a boss it's dead. Hell people barely go to Basilisk knights unless they are on task.
---
Damn thank you homie this is awesome
---
“82 Slayer”
---
“Enjoy Abby demons”
---
Something about that doesn’t add up?
---
Are we trying to kill Curtis? He just finished.
---
ewww
---
I don’t play an Ironman at all but I think they should add an option for Ironman only to show the item to someone to add it to the log, or just somehow auto add every banked item to the log on Ironman accounts.
---
Noice!
---
you right, my bad.
---
Where can I buy 1?
---
So basically slayer is horrible gp/hr unless you get a black demon task? Lol
---
Did you play a lot back then? What did you do on rs
---
They did do [something](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Mimic) about 3rd Age. Masters have always had a 1/2270 chance of dropping a piece of 3rd Age, and Mimics from masters now give an additional 1/3420 (1/15 for Mimc, 1/228 for 3a not ring). 
---
Assuming my 7th grade math is correct, the chances of getting a piece increased by 66%. 
---
(1/2270 + 1/3420) / (1/2270) = \~66% increase
---
I've done this twice after seeing posts like this. Not this time lol.
---
Pretty sure drop rate from ele is 1/300
---
Bro if max cash is a lot to you I can give you some if you want
---
edit: this sounded deameaning but I mean it generously
---
I remember when i was a little kid seeing this dog follow me around. i was so happy about it. i couldn't really read much back then and i was just a kid (i thought you had to kill goblins for money)  so i clicked on him and was sad to see that i shoo'd him away. 
---
Jagex, give us an option to use meat on the poor dog to feed him instead of shoo'ing him away. Why was this an option in the first place? UNPLAYABLE
---
I knew there were rocks underneath my farming patch
---
Forget karambwan, lobbies are the shit! All of the foods are F2P except for the last one.
---
Can I get the animated version?
---
Ok
---
In single combat zones it's really hard to get skull tricked. The risk is a bit higher with a singles team, but a singles team is not going to bother with you unless you are a high profile target or are displaying huge risk.
---
In general the risk of singles teams is way overblown.
---
What changes can we expect for the official desktop client,  it's quite ridiculous that mobile runs smoother than desktop..
---
How I should have done it, honestly. This is a much better version of mine, and gets the point across much, much better. Thank you for this ♥
---
i just went, dude only one reks u. It drains defense and magic to ZERO. lol so you have no defense at all.
---
PVP challenges between LinksOcarina and Rargh. Half of the uploads are on one channel, half on the other.
---
They also make content seperate of eachother which is quite enjoyable (albeit less then the pvp challenges imo)
---
They could easily change it to act like a binding necklace or something. Runecrafting has dozens of quality of life updates they could give it. Make it teleport to any rc altar 10x per day. Could be useful for some quick RC xp or amazing for those annoying Sherlock clues where you craft cosmic/nature/death runes.
---
What master did you use? And any tips for blocked tasks? I need to get back into slayer again. I'm only 77 currently.
---
Lmao spent 15 minutes setting it up my first time. Finally got it, 5 minutes later a level 100 froob came in and played it like a noob (legit trying to dodge them and hiding between bushes and shit), got caught and all my work was ruined. Fuck this. Back to blackjacking I go.
---
I've been reading it as dibbler for so long...but it's better than diddler, I guess
---
ROAD ROLLER DA!
---
True, but keep in mind if you're buying GP and then buying bonds you're effectively saving yourself money. 
---
Gp costs 50c a mil and at current bond prices at \~5.5m each it means if you do the 3 bond bundle that's 45 days for 16.5m or 11m for 1 month. Why pay $11 when you could pay $5.5? Literally half the price. 
---
I'm not advocating for RWT but OSRS isn't worth $11 a month when they don't pay their Jmods and what they've done to RS3 with the MTX.
---
Support
---
I think its awesome because it allows me to play for free as im poor IRL.
---
However i think it could be dangerous as if you just buy all the gear you want with real money/you wont really have anything to work for and might burn out faster
---
They don't end your slayer task streak
---
If you're in combat you stay logged in, after 6 minutes or so you'll stop auto retaliating if you ever stop being in combat, and 20 minutes is the max afk time before you get auto-logged.
---
It will work on the app as well but your phone has to be awake and the app open the whole time.
---
&gt; I get 5-10k xp per hour.
---
&gt;I don’t use a cannon though
---
Slayer is utter shit unless you're willing to do the stuff you're supposed to. Cannon/slaughter brace the multi combat tasks you can and you'll get significantly more exp/bour. Start bursting when you unlock dust devils.
---
I know this is easy to fake (not sure if there’s a rare drop log or anything somewhere I can provide proof with) but I just saw the spear on the ground while afking crabs and the drop rate blew my mind! This games weird lol
---
Just burst dustdevils or nechies. More afk/more xp/more gp.
---
Wow sucks lol
---
Salt
---
Can't tell you how long as I took some breaks from OSRS and had a lot of skilling grinds in between. I probably started this grind around early summer. Took a long break to do skilling passively and diaries/quests.
---
Roughly around ~115M profit if my estimates on supplies costing 10m is true. I think slayer is the funnest part of OSRS so I highly suggest slaying and getting the correct diaries and quests to go with it.
---
Just like how fortune cookies work!
---
He needs it, he just got robbed.
---
Last night was bad. They were getting ddos'd for months, it went away for a while, I think it's probably back now
---
alch that shit.
---
flipping
---
Normally I burn out after a goal has been achieved and a month or so later I’ll come back with a new goal. The purchasable gear hasn’t really ever been a goal I’ve set myself as you can buy it, but I see what you mean. If I ever got to the point where I fully felt bored and done with my main I’d just put more time into my Iron Man.
---
I had that mousepad for the longest time. Wow.
---
Can you update your anti cheating systems. Lms items have dropped 40%, bh had to be disabled, wildy has a ton of scouting bots. pvp is dying under the current system
---
Duradel 90%, Neive 9%, and Konar 1%. I hate Konar's tasks as it caused quite a few skips and it wasn't worth unless point boosting at the streak mark.
---
It’s time
---
How do you get the markings for the herbs?
---
That doesn't change the fact that it's op, it's removing so many clicks.
---
Wild pie is a pie made with the Cooking skill. Like all pies, it is eaten in two halves. Each half boosts the player's Slayer level by 5 and Ranged by 4, and restores 11 Hitpoints (for a total of 22 per pie).
---
Really good idea, would love to see testing on that
---
I did play alot. I messed around alot and mainly trained range.
---
Lol Nice
---
If you are in a position to be able to buy them and want to save time then it’s your prerogative to do so.  It’s not shameful. Don’t worry what people think about it, all the people giving you shit for buying bonds are the same people who buy them ingame and need people like you to be bringing them into the game. 
---
Jagex have also said that over half the playerbase has RWTed before so I guarantee that at least some of the “mommy’s credit card” players have bought GP themselves to get ahead and now pretend they are so against it.
---
99 strength, 1 agility
---
In general, yes. It's much better at higher levels with much better gear. I didn't do Zammy, Arma, KQ, etc as I don't have the gear or stats for that.
---
No just harry. Yer a wizard
---
Dont worry not many people see this. Dead content sadly
---
Rip rng forever
---
Can confirm
---
I didnt want to restart my account for osrs not gunna do it again. Idk i may be in the minority of not retraining skills as most are shit and leagues is just a time period and then gone. So pointless other than some fashionscape
---
They've talked about it and said they are collecting data about the issue
---
Could this be considered for Hespori as well?
---
Why not just add a visual filter of some raindrops, snow currently does not interact with anything and is purely a visual effect. I’m sure a visual filter could be coded into the client that activates and deactivates on a timer or something
---
“It’s a bit crude but, I got an erection.”
---
god speed gamer.
---
They do if you use Turael, if you dont you gotta pay 30 slayer points.
---
Why would I share it with someone who is incapable of understanding it? We can't have a proper discussion on it lmao
---
Lmao. I know of runescape and dabs a funny thing people do! This makes me uppy @!!
---
Bots will always farm any player vs player encounter that exists when the rewards are created out of nothing.  You think ehp would stop a bot farm?
---
there is a boss who's cave is in the wilderness, but the inside of the cave is not a pvp area.  There is a special portal outside the boss's room that lets you use an instanced room so only you can enter.  When someone plays as ironman, if anyone does any damage at all to a monster, the ironman gets no loot.  Even if they damaged the monster 30 minutes ago and left, and the monster has recovered to max hp before the iron even starts.
---
So for 200k, you get a guaranteed fresh boss and no one can enter while you are fighting him and steal the kill.
---
God that's so crazy expensive in today's standards. Makes me wonder what kind of setup I'll use in 10 or 15 years and what games will need those crazy specs. Or maybe I'll use my gtx 3080ti and 180g of ram on osrs.
---
Best story ever.
---
Doing brutal blacks with a dhcb off task is it more effective to use elite void or just a blessed d'hide set?
---
You've never noticed that lol? It's usually just every 1 hp = 1 slayer xp. There are a few exceptions but they're largely irrelevant as no one kills that shit anyway.
---
Abs
---
100% was I did so A LOT.
---
The best money maker in the game is running pure essence for lava crafters. It pays around 8m an hour if you have good feedback, are experienced, and can run tick-perfectly for an hours at a time.
---
I wrote [a guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sorceress%27s_Garden/Summer#One-click_Summer_Garden_Method) on the wiki for this some time ago. It's a great method.
---
Thanks i hate it
---

Tie
---
Right, just like every other pie, but they don’t boost your level for acquiring tasks meaning you couldn’t pull an Abby demons *task* with the use of a pie.
---
Nice. I did it yesterday too
---
Afk and watch shows or if you can, while at work
---
learn to meme
---
Reqs 77 rc though?
---
What happened to the polling ‘constitution’ or whatever it was called that you guys said was gonna get made?
---
His account is better than mine by the time he finished the easy tier... I don't have that in me
---
Emblems were like 80k
---
That’s fine if people want a G/E or trading post system. I think the G/E is too easily abusable though.
---
Just realize you made a zero IQ comment and get on with life.

How does this fit in to the Spakkiberket Lore?

You can give him bones.

How did you guess?;)

This is too much and going into rs3 direction tbh
---
Aint about fashionscape
---
bless your heart
---
No idea what that even is but congrats on the wealth
---
No one is forcing you to enter the wild bro. Literally no one. Don’t want to encounter PVPers? Don’t enter PvP zones. Very simple solution.
---
That’s my subreddit
---
Windows has three tools for screen shots
---
Print screen
---
Snip tool (windows 7)
---
Snip tool (windows 10)
---
There are rarely teams bigger than 3 people at any of these locations lol
---
Right but there is still OSRS for people who would rather play that.
---
Lol you’re a huge fucking asshole. Funny nonetheless
---
It's time.
---
Blocking the sunlight, just like a professional RS player.
---
You mean like the attack option setting that is already in the game?
---
You'll die just try again.
---
&gt;No one likes doing the activity though, it’s super unrewarding.
---
In your opinion. I know plenty of people who have finished the whole shop because they enjoy the content. Aerial fishing is fine. Most people don't put any effort into fishing or hunter so adding a method that is relatively click intensive for a desired reward is a good thing.
---
Lobster pot mith grapple teleport scroll to pest control or dig site? Maybe a guthix kite in there some sort of HAM top and a pestle and mortar also maybe the grey one at the bottom could be something for blowing glass?
---
That works out to earning $2.75 an hour? No thanks
---
Not even surprised
---
The biggest tip I have is try to relax it's easier said than done but honestly my problem was when the had round started my heart rate would sky rocket and I would get too nervous and make mistakes. 
---
My secondary tip would be don't try and aggro all the healers at once, just aggro one then get ready to switch prayers and repeat.
---
Yeah the prayer one is tempting but the thing is that once you hit 99 prayer it effectively shuts off, the only bonus it gives is halved drain rate. Which is good, but I don't think it competes with 85% refunded runes/ammo (especially since you have no access to the Ava's devices) nor *infinite run energy* and 4x hp regen. I'm really torn between these two, as both remove a hefty amount of misery from the grind.
---
In normal worlds sure. On 2k and 2.2k they risk a bit more. Mystic + ballista is already 1m
---
I probably would.
---
They've only recently dropped below 8k tho... it's entirely because the air orb supply is dried up. Bstaffs are tied to the alch price of air staffs minus the air orb cost with air orbs going up bstaffs have to go down.
---
Idk but a whole lot of level 3 bots can. Where the fuck is a jmod on the scene it’s been going on for days
---
I'm just gonna downvote because you already posted this like 10 minutes ago.  - spammy
---
Jagex has backed themselves into a corner. Hindering future progression of the game based off this polling system. Its kind of discouraging seeing everything T75 because the community is not prepared for endgame content and new skills.
---
Don't lose your shit at jad. Just relax and focus. My first time chasing firecape was stressful because I was worried of failing lol. Just stay focused on your prayer and when the 4 healers come out get them when you can
---
I came to this thread
---
Add me in game "Bitcoin 3" or "Bitcoin 2" or pm me ur nickname so I pm u when I'm back online in the game :P
---
Might start a clan chat for this tomorrow, if people might be interested I think you could get very high gp/H for the time involved in deliveries, way better than any other skills/npc built-in money maker. You could even keep alching or fletching while doing that for no xp waste.
---
No one is going to support you with that kind of smug attitude. You're wrong, by the way.
---
If you have fire a shot post it's invincible, especially a crossbow, it can delay your crumble undead spell and cause you to get hit by the spawn. It's currently one of only non-braindead aspects of Vorkath.
---
&gt;sadly found deliveritems cc extremely nenligent at that, as they have a policy against economics /payment offers or tips / or even scenarios where there would be most demand as GWD (LOL).
---
well yeah, its more a social/helper cc not a runner cc.
---
no way
---
In all my other comments I also write /I think./
---
Literally 6 attacks acid  6 attacks freeze, repeat until dead.
---
If you are playing on a limited account you need to be aware of game mechanics, if you don't understand the mechanics don't do the content.
---
 If not understanding the mechanics puts you in danger don't do the content.
---
Oh sure. My name is NotOwain
---
Just because it is as prevalent as before doesn't mean it wasn't always an issue that needed to be addressed. You shouldn't lose all your shit because of shotty servers, or even worse, because someone ddosed the service so they could take your shit.

i bought condoms and same happend.....
---
this is a really good question. they made all of the equipment rewards tradeable for exactly this reason — a lot of people will just want to play on their alt. i’m not sure if they’ve explained how that will work with those non-item rewards though.
---
I sold mine for 29m
---
I thought this got nerfed a while ago
---
The hell is that thing in the back Jesus Christ
---
I'm more intrigued by the official client.
---
Lol, I just assumed it was a reminder to log in.
---
I might want to start a runner cc, to help myself and the whole community of newbs and veteran players. Noobies could help themselves a lot by running requests while alchin tbh
---
Those are some extremely overpowered drop rates for previously rare or untradeable items. 
---
What’s the point of making them weak to different melee styles? That sounds like a lot of dev work with balancing and such, and there’s no reason to do it.
---
Maybe if the eyes weren’t so big and the moustache was green like a branch i wouldn’t think it was a face of horror
---
It was clear when SOTE was being pitched that the crystal bow would be dead content. I personally hate the "make another item useful by nerfing another" approach. All the blowpipe nerf would do is change years of an established meta and make max melee/tbow the meta again. Blowpipe already has a high operating cost.
---
It’s definitely not ideal that they wouldn’t change passwords for those things frequently but that’s definitely not that weird for even a big company I feel like. But I think It’s kinda unprofessional/petty for him to be informing them though a public twee like that lol. 
---
And I’m not saying like it’s totally fine cause that is pretty poor security on jagexs part but that’s something I could see happening with the social media accounts of any large company. Still it’s not that big of a deal that he tweeted that either, just seems a little petty to me.
---
What about KBD?

Maybe you fancy a little lady named Cerberus? _ÚwÙ_

In a raid, you have a raid tab in that area, he or she is currently viewing the raid tab and just has it closed

So that's where the humans have been hiding it.

travel to front of island to drop aggro, travel back works in the meantime

where can i find the average # of nests for each tier of bird house? im wondering if it is worth it to upgrade from yew to magic from a pure profit perspective. my gut says yes but id like to see some data to back it up
---
Why you lying 😂😂
---
Could have been worse. He could have done it from *their* login.
---
I’m telling people “posture check” and everything.
---
Guess I'm just exposing my bossing noobiness. Have never raided yet.
---
They're not all that significant. Demonics give 408.5 xp and have 380hp. KBD gives 258 and has 240hp. They're mostly all bosses, which are trash xp anyway. You're right in that it's not a strict 1:1	anymore, but it's not a crazy difference is what I meant.
---
Well you're supposed to spec him down and then move around him, hitting at each corner. I know that's not a very descriptive response but it's hard to type it out without a visual. 
---
My recommendation, just watch a quick vid it's not all that complex, and there's phases you also need to be wary of
---
32 is average, so 23 is nothing crazy. Grats tho
---
Yea I know I over simplified my response as we really pissed this guy off for him to make a post about delivery cc's.
---
He’s trolling look at his gear lol
---
Not a chance.
---
r/ironscape
---
all these people saying "account ruining", like oh no, the icon turned from red to gray, truly huge difference to gameplay. Dude in picture probably won't care by this time tomorrow
---
you should be able to dds spec out the varrock dog and feed its meat to charlie the tramp. why should i respect a dumb dog when i have 99 hunter
---
Eh, i'm at 110 solos dry with 30-35k pts/raid....4x drop rate atm.
---
oh fuck i just noticed the cape and shield/sword

gg

I misread his farming xp as his slayer

It is YOUR responsibility to secure YOUR account!!!

There's always someone who gets annoyed over a free service sadly

&gt; This is why there are spite vote rules now.

There's no such thing.
---
It's ok. I will do it for him. Its "sample text"  
---
You are welcome richry
---
If you don't want to do the content you don't get the reward. Aerial fishing is a click intensive method by design, and the pearls recieved were already buffed. 
---
Want the reward? Do the content. Don't like the content? Don't get the reward. Not an insane concept.
---
Would definitely reccomend you start it, lots of fun and not nearly as hard as it seems, it's just starting it that's frightening
---
It's easy to forget that they annihilate you if you don't wear it because you're always wearing it
---
Shit like this is why I tell everyone who tries to talk to me in pub chat to fuck off
---
What BiS gear do you think KBD dropped in 07? We've had barrows since 2005, defenders since 2006, GWD released in 07 lol. The best you've got is a niche visage chance that you can get outside of the wild
---
It was my nmz setup but cba reset nmz everytime I 20 min logged so just went here lol
---
Yea I feel your pain, mobiles killed my parents too :/
---
There should be a warning sign in his honor
---
What confused me wasn’t the part about dust devils, i just didn’t know dying changed you from a HC Ironman to regular. The whole Ironman mode is pretty foreign to me
---
This is what it looks like when you turn on every single runelite plugin
---
And here I thought it was a seed dibbler that you wield in the off hand like a defender.
---
All GWD give wildly different slayer XP bonuses that aren’t nearly 1:1.  Same with majority of superiors that try to fall somewhat close to 1:10.
---
K’rill: 37.5%
---
Graardor: 32.5%
---
Kree’arra: 40%
---
Zilyana: 37.5%
---
Slayer XP is pretty arbitrary for majority of high leveled monsters and bosses.
---
Cooking and Fletching are both afk and profitable to 99.
---
Short of blast furnace which requires intensity, Smithing is a major loss until 98.
---
My apologies. 1 pvm related change in almost 8 years due to the literall millions of bots that have been created for the sole purpose of botting pvm.
---
That seems fair right?
---
We have to make updates with direct concern for  bots in PvP for the thousands of bots. While pvm can have millions over the life of the game.
---
It’s almost like every pker in the beta test said multiple things to fix, yet were completely ignored.  Now that it has been launched the pvm community should have to wait 2-3 years to get it fixed like with zulrah. Just like we had to.
---
I’m not saying that the current  inherent system isn’t flawed. It is, I’m saying that They had the feedback from the community, ignored it and now the PvP community has to face the backlash again. 
---
Also scraping adding value to pking is the equivalent of scraping all future pvm content because zulrah was implemented terribly
---
How the fuck did Settled win Best Content Creator when he makes 1 video every 6 weeks lol...
---
It is 2019 sir
---
You're 18 prayer and 17 slayer but 15 for the rest the account is ruined throw it in the bin 
---
Edit didnt even see your att or hp lol
---
Just to clarify, there is no UHCIM.
---
There's:
---
IM: No trading
---
HCIM: No trading + no dying.
---
UIM: No trading + no banking
---
HCIM is the only status you can lose. When you die as a HCIM, you become a IM. Dying is OK on IM and UIM.
---
I'm sure you're familiar with this series (hugely popular on OSRS Reddit), but you should check out "Swampletics". He's a UIM that can only play in Morytania. It's really cool to see how he deals with not banking while being restricted to one of the more obscure areas of the game.
---
What about PKers that don’t kill any1 lol, or wildy slayers that die a lot ? Genuinely curious as to how It could be done I don’t see a way without alienating bad PKers
---
Rather a skilling boomer than a PvMscape zoomer
---
Agreed 100%, with the death mechanics we have now it's really fucked the community's mindset.
---
Hey! This is just a reminder to try it out! Good luck
---
Uhcim (ultimate hardcore ironman) doesnt exist, and honestly would be virtually impossible to play.
---
Uim (ultimate ironman) have a few, much less convenient options for storing a limited number of important items including a looting bag, death banks (zulrah/vorkath/hespori/etc), stash units, poh, tool leprechaun, and others.
---
Obviously, looting bag and death banks would both be virtually useless on a theoretical hcuim which is why it would be nearly impossible. Many quests or skilling methods rely on you having an empty inventory and the best way to achieve that without dropping everything you own is to die at a death bank
---
You don’t need 90 str and range. Again, you don’t know what you’re talking about. This is my main point as to why new players should not have a voice over pvp. 
---
You have to GRIND for raids. You don’t have to grind to make a decent pvp account.
---
Regardless if it’s comical or not, you don’t seem to understand  pvp. Like your points about leveling and money.
---
always been that way. not sure why the slayer money meme got started
---
Lmao that is weird
---
mate all we want is for you to just say what you need, if someone can get you they'll get you. Other people play the game too
---
Will you be paying in bitcoins or osrs gp?
---
'knowing you're using an inefficient setup.' I definitely didn't know this. I just use barrows nowadays as a means for elite clues; I've consulted multiple outlets and get really good chest times / chest per hour. I'll have to look into the blowpipe but I don't think I could get faster chests. I believe I first started using this method after watching Jakey and N0thinglasts talk about it being most efficient but that was awhile ago.
---
I think a large portion of this community did not play back during the early 2010s era.
---
Currently at hydra the mechanic is Hydra must be on the vent before the chemical shoots up for it to be weakened, any chance it could be looked at to change it so it's weakened if its walking into the chemical as well?
---
He should know just as much as OP considering he's killing the dust devils.
---
Never understood how people can get this far into the game and not know how to search a wiki page for the drop rate of an item
---
That was my first goal in my iron  got it at the minimum stats  to wear it lol
---
That was a typo. It was supposed to be 99. So you get 99 str/rng/mage and there is no more leveling to do. That's a weird point to hinge this discussion on, seems you are out of points to make.
---
Just going to end it here since you didnt seem to read what I said even and continue to call me a new player.
---
/u/BenjoRS
---
Anything that doesn’t produce incentive to continue playing it in the long term, yes. 
---
Pest control still has xp rewards as an incentive (used by limited accounts/uim/some players genuinely enjoy it and train there). 
---
Castle wars is pretty dead content at fault to efficiencyscape
---
Trouble Brewing is about as dead content as MTA is. But at least MTA *can* still be very minimally profitable (I think like 300k/hr efficiently?) 
---
TLDR: it’s better for an item(s) to revive content somewhere than to do nothing elsewhere. They talked about doing so at MTA with elemental tomes but those failed the poll (probably because warding). These robes would’ve been a good fit for taking their place
---
Why isnt this higher up?
---
I'm interested to know too, I've never seen a stun splash on an impling
---
[you](https://i.imgur.com/poQxTe3.jpg)
---
I’m not sure what their criteria is going to be but again I’m pretty sure it’s possible to track down whether or not you’ve engaged in PVP activity. They are looking into a period of time in which you’ve engaged in said activity, not whether or not you ever have or if you have been while the poll is active. So regardless of whether or not you’re good you’ll be fine I think. 
---
The object is to avoid PvP kill farming. As for people who do wild slayer and die a lot, I don’t know if they’ll have a say.
---
Everyone's just talking about normal mobs, asshat.
---
MORE
---
permaban irl
---
Plot twist:
---
It's a copypasta
---
Yes but rules are made to be broken so he is right
---
Shit that's genius. No wonder why it's dead content
---
Then kill demonics
---
Enables sticky keys too.
---
The game is all about fun brother
---
I have nothing to say other than that Xrenor's videos are what got me back into the game.
---
Asshat, normal mobs such as drakes, hydras, brutal black dragons, demonic gorillas, etc... give bonus XP that’s an arbitrary %.
---
Nice job coming in hot and making yourself look dumb.
---
The guys above have given you a pretty cohesive answer and stuff to think/work on. 
---
My rsn is Grey Wardn if you want to shoot me any more questions I'll be happy to help out.
---
Miniquest? It needs to be a grandmaster quest.
---
You also dont need a whip or trident u can do the whole game with a d scim. It's a dumb argument
---
No, it’s because PvP is part of this game and it deserves its own unique rewards. If you don’t want a bandos pet, you don’t have to do bandos. If you don’t want ancient tele tabs, don’t do PVP. Very simple.
---
This makes my point stronger. The only stats leveled through pvp are the irrelevant ones that already have a better method. Thanks for backing me up.
---
Making other ranged weapons as strong would be powercreep, with the exception of tbow class rare weapons that surpass blowpipe against specific creatures.
---
Rs3 ppl kill them for money lol rs3 economys fukd
---
Thanks for typing out your phone number, gf account
---
Isnt there the fortnite storm in lms? Idk dont remember
---
1. D pick is only a 6% increase in speed, so not required
---
2. MVP is imo about 40% skill, 40% luck and 20% stats and equipment. So shouldn't hold you back from MVP
---
3. Even if you never get MVP it's not a big deal. The secondary drop you get from MVP is tiny, like one tenth the value of the main drop.
---
Nice video. You can also lure it to the bank. If you join "Splashworlds" Cc, we usually have one lured. It is all right next to a bank booth.
---
Just add the Twitter account to your Tweetdeck account. Even if the password of the account is changed, you'll always have access through Tweetdeck.
---
Unless they revoke the App access, which is somewhere deeply hidden in your settings nowadays, you can keep using it.  You'll still be able to Tweet, Retweet, Like, Send &amp; Read DMs, etc.
---
What cb is your obby lol. Let’s see how experienced you are
---
I second this. People have suggested it before but never seen it make the front page.
---
You're better off not knowing, trust me.
---
It’s worth at least 2379gp
---
It’s not the truth at all. Pvp loot is way north of 50k. It’s 100% reliable
---
Wouldn't a ton of companies have disgruntled employees tweeting crazy shit then?
---
Jesus you twist things. I said people want to level up. Someone else suggested you can do that through pvp. I pointed out that's only combats which don't take long to max.  I never said you need 99 stats for pking lol.

91 smithing ew no thanks

Tbf how skillful is OSRS really besides bossing? Lol most skills are just patience tests.

Imagine getting to something like the demons in underground pass only for your weapons to break before you can kill them
---
Make what go you can in game while flipping high frequency items on the ge. That’s what I did. Made 7mil in my first 3 months playing decently casually.

Thanks for the suggestion, I will check them out. Thats also my issue with most of the generic OSRS Youtuber's I have found.

You're referring to Boss slayer where you can get wildy bosses?
---
1. It's a toggle, you accept the risk of getting a wildy task when you toggle it on.
---
2. Krystilia assigns the wildy bosses much more often so I don't see an issue with Duradel assigning them very rarely.
---
3. Just skip them, they're so rare, or you can just choose the lowest amount and do that so quickly.
---
ok?
---
If the community wants it, sure.
---
Thanks!

Most people want to have levels that are good for their bracket.  Other than that, stats are irrelevant (unless you’re talking about specific builds)

I agree, and I also understand its an MMO and there is a private room for this very reason, but its just funny that people seem this entitled to stupid stuff in a video game. off to kill kraken in my own private room i guess!
---
He wasn't staking to stake, that's just gambling. He was looking for people that were attempting to scam and by playing by their rules gain an advantage against them. I guess a lot of stakers also RWT, but I'm not sure what that has to do with this instance...

The only controversial thing about it is that Jagex still allows the sand casino to exist.
