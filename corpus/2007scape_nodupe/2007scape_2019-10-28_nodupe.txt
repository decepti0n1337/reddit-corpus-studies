Well it is 1:1 since ardy knights are left click pickpocket anyways. I know a lot of people do use windows mouse keys on osrs, no idea if it's bannable though for sure. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Which if like this guy said, you're doing a 1:1 input then it should be fine - so if you're just changing out left click on a mouse for let's say 'A' on the keyboard that is fine. Just can't have it do more than 1 function

I have 800 hours of Factorio and 50 hours of Satisfactory. It's almost a 3d rip off, really pretty game and absolutely worth a shot. But no, it didn't capture me like Factorio once did. Too much manual labor, walking around and doing pointless shit. I'll probably return once the full game is out

I know there are multipliers for 10/50/100/250/750 and 1000 Streaks (Not sure with the 750 one) So says the wiki but i didn't find any clarify about the 500th so idk if it counts as a 250 (250+250=500) or as a 100.
---
If you have the money to level mage, I would go to Barrows. Not many people realize that Barrows is really profitable at low level. If you can get magic level to at least 70-75 you can do Barrows for 700k/h, easily.
---
Okay thanks

I got macro majored falsely on 2 accounts, one was reversed but I just quit the game. It's not worth my time if my account could just vanish like that.

Slaya or barrows. Also, do herb rubs

not really any good updates recently. just pandering to ironmen and now they're gonna waste dev time to literally remake the normal gamemode v2 (group ironman) and this new nightmare boss is probably going to consist of just clicking on it and eating a piece of food every once in a while. basilisk knights were a total let-down too. literally 2005 content all over again. go afk with prayers on, occasionally eat a food. their mechanic is literally negated by auto retaliate lmfao garbage design, demonic gorillas were like 9176176x better and a lot more engaging for instance.

Please tell me this is a joke. You want qol for your actual life now? Pathetic
---
you're at basically teh absolute minimum stats to wield the things you need to fight zulrah (trident, blowpipe)
---
you should get your mage and range up some probably, but it is technically possible to do zulrah yeah. if you just need the 1 for the diary go nuts. if you're looking to farm then get your mage up probs.
---
Karamja diary question. Need to trade gems for machete... wiki says I need gout tuber... GE price is almost 1mill. There‚Äôs gotta be an easier way right?

---
Farm runs, questing, rune crafting at ZMI, clue scrolls, etc. Like I said, there are lots of practical applications to getting graceful early. As a non-ironman, sure, perhaps not as useful given you can just buy stam pots and construction for a stam pool.
---
I used runelite‚Äôs screen maker feature to mark all of the places I‚Äôd have to click, ordered them by colors of the rainbow to remember which one was next and afk‚Äôd extremely hard while watching Netflix, looking up every 10 seconds to click again.

OSbuddy once stole hundreds of players accounts.

Maybe XD
---
Not only that, but on almost all of the members worlds, the Varrock GE is dead. In a way, you can actually start to play RS3 somewhat efficiently only _after_ you've unlocked prif, or in some cases, max guild (with its 1 click tele to a ge 3 spaces away...)

FYI, if your account is banned, simply dispute the charge on your credit card. Because they have literally no support whatsoever, refuse to present evidence, and are blatantly unilaterally banning your account, they will lose the dispute every single time. And to naysayers claiming you shouldn't for such a small charge or whatever, it is a feature on your cards for a reason. I'm not really suggesting to do this if your account was banned for legitimate reasons, but I strongly suspect (as in it happened to me) that many folks are banned erroneously by their automatic systems.
---
Nothing is gp efficient. Going out of your way to make money with no side benefits (pet completion or xp) is never a good choice in runescape on a main. 
---
Clues give log completion and a chance at a master, which gives a pet chance. So they're always worth doing imo.  They also have rewards like the giant casket or giant spade, which again are always worth building towards. 
---
That being said, on ironman I think hard clues are nearly the best moneymaker available, assuming you already have one. It's like 1m-1.2m raw cash "per hr" in alchs. You won't go out of your way to grind them, but if you get one it's always worth it to go and finish it.

Actually there has been a bunch of people appealing macro major bans that happened years ago and most of them seem to be approved nowadays.
---
I know some people that had 20+ accs unbanned and I personally recently appealed 5 and am waiting for the answers.
---
But it is 93, to boost +5 to amulet of torture.
---
hmm, just my opinion here but I'm not sure if all that would fit well. I'd prefer the boss to be closer to mini-game oriented than combat, and those moves seem like something more fit for a combat oriented boss.
---
That necklace would be too OP and drive the red chin values waaay down. Although I am definitely for a possible Hunter xp boosting set.
---
I would also enjoy a quest that leads up to said miniboss!

From what I've seen is that most people tend to stick with this game for two years at the most if they've made friends in it. If their friends got them into it and later quit a few months later theyve quit with them too as part of the popularity trend. That's especially true with mobile. Lots of people got into the game only to quit a few months later. 
---
I remember back in 2006 that was the trend. I'd make friends in the game and they'd quit about a year and a half to two years later to play another game. Cod was really popular back then and I remember losing some friends to it.
---
Be faster
---
I use it all the time at brutal blacks, it's my favorite and feels pretty afk chill if you wanna turn on the old YouTube and make some coin.
---
Good idea to get your money back but I dont think this will make them do anything about the support..
---
It does add a +1 hit to max if you have an inferno cape. So it is not just on paper. It is just negligible if you do not have a inferno cape.

Is that a bear?

YouTube farming guide
---
1. Humidify does work regardless of weapon equipped
---
2. Plank make is good and a decent profit if you buy at the right prices. If you want really really fast magic exp grind slayer and each burstable task will give you decent exp.
---
Try MLM(Motherlode Mine) it‚Äôs the afk method to mining. But yes Mining is a horrible skill, up there with RC and Agility. I recommend you do as much quest as possible as they will give you good chunks of exp for the early levels.
---
83 con first, it'll make gaining back the 18-20m faster/more efficient, then get rigour as soon as you can reasonably afford it, rebuild a bit if necessary. I did a rebuild when it was 72m with a 130m bank and didn't regret it
---
Seriously though. I can understand the lantern things though. They‚Äôre like 1gp each iirc lol
---
Crafting is pretty chill, fun for me. Also woodcutting gets pretty afk on higher levels and you can try to do it with fire making and see if that works for you. Cooking for me is pretty good too, similar to fishing, but levels up much faster. I have only played f2p, so those are the only skills I can speak of. Also level up your magic to unlock teleportation scrolls, as that will make travelling easier and faster, and if you are p2p then go for some agility training too as it will help you in long run in terms of travelling.
---
Gear discord has a tab of bank tags.

---
Side note get varrock hard or at least med, those bstaffs add up
---
For farming runs use the best compost you can afford and use as many patches you can. Then use a seed that will make you profit, ranarr is always profitable, even at 32 when you can first farm them. Then just do your runs. You also need a seed dibler and a spade, make sure you have secutars in hand to get benifit.
---
So I‚Äôve tried to do some research for you to see if 16 attack offers any benefits.
---
At 15 attack you can wield the ancient mace, also requires 25 prayer though. Interesting weapon that allows you to drain your opponents prayer.
---
At 20 is of course mithril, if you‚Äôre already using a slayer staff for melee damage though that would be pointless. 
---
40 attack for rune (might enjoy some non members pking, the pk worlds are a lot of fun!) 50 attack for gmaul, or 60 for dragon. Assuming you pk with b necklace I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll mind risking the the new handle for g maul.

And they say there aren't any item sinks
---
Have an equipable item in your inventory. If it fills, equip the item and proceed to dismantle and rebuild. Then take off again after.
---
Thank you. That's so simple and idk why I didn't think of it.
---
Seriously. Everyone knows left to right wiping is best.
---
I.E them *admitting* gp has real world value makes staking pretty sketchy and Jagex juuuuust finished lying to parliament

Ranarr can be variable. Still good if a good yield, but toadflax is more consistent.
---
I just wanna know how the fuck the name "Canadian" wasn't taken at the time Iron Man mode came out
---
If you want something comparable to fishing, Id definitely recommend woodcutting. Hunter is also something to try and see if you enjoy it. 
---
A lot of early level methods aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù when leveling up a skill and some skills aren‚Äôt really made to be enjoyable. You might hate doing mining right now but end up enjoying some of the other later methods like mother lode mine, volcanic mine, etc.

Did u have the same opinion of KBD back in 2006? The food chain mechanic has always been in place, its only attitudes that are different now.
---
I think a big problem is that the devs don't want to do REALLY major changes to the original towns, which is why they're doing a lot of stuff in Zeah. A lot of the people wouldn't recognize the game anymore already, it'd be even weirder for people who come for the nostalgia to come back and find the OG towns all different.I mean that doesn't mean that the OG towns are actually lacking. The reason that varrock seems like it's full and the rest of RS is empty is because everyone bankstands in varrock and the servers aren't exactly packed. There's also a lot of efficient modes of transportation now so less tedious running between cities. I remember teleporting was pretty expensive back in the Old times for me a child noob.
---
Falador's already a big (underground at least) mining town and is already a big hub for getting medium clues It's a little OG they might not want to mess around here.
---
Alkharid is pretty dead outside of Duel arena, it would be nice if there was more stalls to steal from or people to pickpocket/kill but it's a pretty OG place they might not want to change much about it as well.
---
seers village is pretty popping woodcutting, teleporting, and agility wise. heck people bankstand and chat here quite a bit.
---
Rellka, this one is also pretty dead but then again it's a remote barbarian village in the tundra the doesn't get many outsiders and a lot of it's content is behind freminik trials quest which can be a bit long to complete and it lacks a bank.
---
\---
---
A lot of cities could use something, but not every city can be packed with crap to do ya know? These are some of the cities I would actually like to see more content in honestly though because they're cool.
---
Keldagrim: I know it has blast furnace but I kinda wish it had more content since I really like the city's aesthetics and the quests it's a really alive feeling city with npcs chattering away.
---
Dorgesh-Kaan: I also love the aesthetics of this city and it's quests, and how chatty the npcs are. It's like Keldagrim's sister city, a large lively town that lacks any meaty skilling content. There is some good thieving to be had at least.
---
Zanaris: This city has like nothing in it, and it doesn't even feel like a city. I know it's supposed to be weird and alien feeling but I wish there was a bit more to it or that they would crank up the weird alien vibes. It is currently the best place to bank from the fairy rings, access to puro puro, cosmic crafting, and some creatures to kill so I guess it's not actually hurting for content like some places...
---
Burthorpe: I only wish the games room was replaced. I liked playing there as a kid, but I think it would be cooler if they replaced it with skilling based games. Like escape room, an obstacle course that's all in one room(for chatting), a party room, or a POH hub area with games just like something that would make games room a social get together? something you could chat and do. If any town would be good for having a GE it would be the games room it would be nice bankstanding and chatting. Unfortunately it wouldn't make much sense from a lore standpoint. currently it's only a place to cook something on a campfire in a basement and were you run to the hero's guild.
---

Gz man. Brings my back to good old draynor village days

Abusing of stalls and unnoting mechanics were intended to be removed from DMM. He admits in his own Tweets that he knew about the oversight and knew it wasn't a legitimate way to play. The second he began abusing the stalls and unnoting method he lost.
---
I agree, i used to drop all of it just because I hated having it all clog up my bank, but I just fixed up my loot tab to accommodate it and it's honestly so much easier to just bank it
---
Love it, definitely support. Way better than RS3s cooking pet.
---
I personally would love to see them create pets for all skills. Grinding all the RS3 pets has been really fun (still missing quite a few boss pets) but it's helped me set goals that aren't necessarily just "get level 99" and let's me do skills past 99 without it feeling like a waste of time.
---
Uh yeah that‚Äôs called fraud and is a crime
---
No, because PC players have also been quitting. there isnt a whole lot going on, so while modt mobile players also dropped it over time after realizing the grind is strong, not accounting for the inflated decay there is still just people quitting normally as well.
---
400k you got lucky
---
Be that as it may, however because ge tax constantly removes gold from circulation this would be very effective at preventing inflation, and as far as I know jagex has nothing implemented to stop it, only considering factors  here tho.  I wouldn't vote for it, this would have crippling effects on high value items and I don't think it's fair for jagex to take gp out of circulation.  General stores did a pretty good job at keeping gold valuable back in the day, but I'm sure most of us remember how we all felt about that.

Congratulations on 99 defence!

THIS!!! My shits not squeaky clean but nothing since 2010 and nothing prior.. I really wish jagex actually gave a shit about the player base

Who downvoted this xD
---
Bonds are $6.99 each so jagex indirectly makes more from you buying bonds than just buying the membership. 1 year of membership with bonds is like $182.
---
It's one thing if you actually make the cash for bonds ingame and don't want to give them real life money, but rwting the gold is literally just giving them $80/year for free.

They never show proof though, it's always our system detected you...

That being said, there should be some time and dates and activities they claim you botted.

people don't like mining? that was like the second skill I maxed, it was insanely relaxing and like 70% afk at MLM, much easier than the old days

In terms of macroing, they probably don't want to release any evidence so botters can't find ban patterns.

Thank fucking Christ someone understand. Majority of people in PvM clans like Oblivion, and Hero PvP on their mains or an alternate account. The PvMers (aka kill 20 zulrah/hr) might hate PvP because they‚Äôre bad at the game but good players typically play all content.

btw?

A long time ago as a bored kid I literally only played this game to scam peeps, made like a bil gp... came up with some really great scams I should make vids of in case there‚Äôs any copycats. Anyway, successfully appealed a permaban like 5 times and I still log on to use my daily keys for the hell of it.
---
Depressed

Look's like my brain cells during an exam.

Doing medium clues from bought eclectics is like 500K an hour. That's pretty freaking high for an activity that doesn't have any major requirements.

It‚Äôll work

fuck em, if i ever got fucked like that i'd be damn sure to pull that shit.
---
The games fine lol, always has been always will be. Cya tomorrow nerds
---
The mechanics are so easy to recognize and avoid if you‚Äôve watched a decent guide and pay attention during the fight. You need some decent RNG on the bolts, but other than that it‚Äôs not amazingly hard. Good comparison to Jad tbh, very doable if you can keep calm.
---
Like motherload in Falador......

infinity boots -&gt; augury -&gt; heart -&gt; torm -&gt; anguish -&gt; ancestral hat -&gt; other pieces of ancestral and arma

heart and torm order is kinda up to you, you can also use brimstone boots instead of infinity to have one less switch but it would be worse than dhide and infinity boots
---
My friend only needs to contact jagex to revert the manual unban now that his balance is 0.00. However he has yet to hit the reddit lottery, or find a competent twitter response that isn't a pre-written reply to a generic support page. He gave up trying since then and unfortunately he made a new account

When I was working towards 99 cooking I had a conversation about what the cooking pet would be with the people at the Hosidius range.  I actually suggested Remy with a gold chefs hat xD Although it would be cool, I think pets should be added sparingly and a cooking one is hard to justify.

Sounds like a great idea for a different game perhaps
---
Sounds very reasonable level requirement. Not only for the clue steps, but also for an EXTREMELY good spot for cutting Teak and Mahogany, thanks to the Trouble Brewing's deposit box.
---
Would be reasonable because that shortcut gives an access to very powerful spot for Teak and Mahogany trees too.
---
Nobody cares about "underrated comment" comments.
---
Idk how people play that shit. I got 2 accounts to 50 and it's just fucking boring. Fetch quests or run the same dungeon for 5 hours straight. Mmmm fun amirite

I‚Äôm not going to give it out as I‚Äôll only get the reddit police on me. If you use your brain and the power of Instagram it‚Äôs pretty easy to decipher the puzzle.

Pretty much only barrows. Zulrah has decent mage def so you want the high accuracy. Trident also attacks faster so you can get more hits in per phase change, and a few other minor benefits like being able to use lunars for venge

You could still give them a try without, its just gonna be really difficult. Fairly sure its possible to tick-eat Galvek hits, the troll quests *can* be done withot the fremmy shield with high stats, maybe the basilisk shield can be an issue, not sure
---
Before the g.e. it wasn't like 2006-2007, it was all about zybez bidding system, you would post there, wait to get pm'ed and meet with the dude.

Varrok west bank was filled with bots auto-typing on big volume goods like food.

Honestly I didn't agree with this stance a couple months ago, I didn't watch these debt streamers, but I also didn't care they existed. BUT, after spending a couple minutes watching a few of them, I see how disgusting the practices they do are. One guy I seen literally had 20 viewers and was begging every single stake for either "loan, donation or chuck", he was in 3b debt. Not only is this super bad, considering the outrage that Runescape 'gambling' is receiving right now, but the streamers could also easily be involved in RWTing the people's "loans". Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if most of these guys that are in billions of debt, are RWTing the loans they receive, because they probably don't even intend to pay people back to begin with.

Anybody know if this permanently turns the outfit into a members object? As in, are you unable to obtain the original version?
---
I was also wrongfully banned for macro and i never played again until osrs came out again. I was crushed because I was just a kid and it meant alot to me at the time. I went through all the stages of grief, I specifically remember the denial was strong lol, I even got grounded for smashing a computer chair. Im pretty sure i had black marks against my account for a trade scam and swearing as well so that probably sealed the deal.

Chompmas has some hilarious upcoming Chompy-related tweets out on the Twitter. WE NEED MORE CHOMPY LORE
---
It could be a fun thing to try out late game, for sure. Thanks for taking an interest :D
---
I also feel that the toxic blowpipe decreases my barrows runs, so I swapped to magic shortbow (i). good alternative imo

Some monsters also has XP bonus, but very minor one. For example Blue dragons has +2.5% and Brutal black dragons +7.5%.

---
Just gots 2 day ban for ‚Äúmacroing‚Äù are you kidding jagex?! I just came back from a 4 year break and I‚Äôve been playing like crazy to catch up!?
---
Yes? Now that the technology of phones exists your at a disadvantage if you don't have one. Just be glad this technology is free.
---
Great observation. I‚Äôm honored to be in the presence of such impressive intellect. I recognize that the human species host a massive selection of great minds, who all think and act differently. Nonetheless it is still a privilege to express my thoughts alongside you, chief.
---
Why do all of these "first 99" posts have identical titles?
---
Easy to ban thousands of freshly made f2p throwaway accounts without people complaining.
---
Whatever points you had before the beta came out you can still spend in the old shop, otherwise you buy looting bag/ r pouch at edge Wildy slayer master for 30k / 1.5m
---
I've been lobbying for a runelite feature that randomizes the music list. Hopefully it'll exist someday.
---
Worth noting, to be transparent. In most countries this fall's under credit card fraud.
---
Also if a number of people start doing this it (ie Jagex as an entity start to pop up often on the banks records wet charge-backs) the fraud department at the bank will investigate, and they may not understand how much your virtual character means to you and that will make your life a pain. At the very least, the outcome is that if you do run into issues with your bank account later in life (at any point) you will have massive trouble getting your money back...
---
I have 300 KC and only got 1 pair of gloves 1 top and a pair of boots. But want to get 99 fm anyway üòä
---
I don't mean like screen shots and stuff I just mean broad time ranges.
---
Like for example we detected you botting from the 1st of this month until this ban or something.
---
Wish I could remember where I've heard that song from.
---
[Coincidence?](https://i.imgur.com/4AI5kcP.png)
---
Yeah, once you have most teles unlocked, a max house, and most stash units built they can be very quic, especially with Runelite.
---
Wild will be full of one itemers and raggers like it used to be. Only reason they are kept at bay is the fear they can be smited or ancient maced.
---
I‚Äôm gonna guess it‚Äôs when you hug a topless dude that has chest hair like 45 year old Italian mobster
---
You can click to douse flame with humidify. You aren't able to is because you drank a brew. Lowering your stats hence not having the required magic lvl to cast
---
It really, really depends on what percentage of your max hit it is. Are you hitting 20s without it? That's a 10% damage increase, so a one-hour task takes 54:33. If you're hitting 90s without it, because you're a crazy dude doing Slayer in full Dharok? That's a 2% damage increase, so a one-hour task takes 58:42.
---
A Ring of Wealth saves you one tick if you were going to pick up the coins anyhow, so in a 150 kill task where everything somehow drops coins that's 1:30.45 - it makes a one-hour task 58:30. Note how this best-case scenario still loses out to Mr. DH up there, who gets the least benefit from the Berserker Ring (i). It's pretty much never going to be faster at lower max hits.
---
It's definitely way more AFK to just wear a Ring of Wealth and have a charged Bonecrusher, though, I'll give you that. Not to mention cannoning, where it saves you running across the room to that one kalphite way off in the corner or whatever.
---
I don't remember it being too annoying either, wasn't the worst part of going for barrows gloves at least.
---
Na
---
Pretty much why I stopped. Whats the point of playing when your acc could get banned anytime?
---
rsn: 65axe2543
---
But you wont tell us who it is, nor offer any proof that you know whose account it is? Cool
---
Creating an infinite amount of legit verifyable email addresses costs a maximum of ‚Ç¨4 per year, probably less
---
no lol
---
That is why the Grand Exchange was created in the first place, in an effort to combat bots on member accounts and real world trade.  Credit card companies insisted Jagex do something and have a real plan then.
---
I think you have to press "can you make another monkey talisman"
---
I hate that Kalphite doucher. It's the worst!
---
thats cool. he made a video that isn't an ad because the guy isnt selling the bot.
---
if he's looking to do 25 min raids he wont need the Herb and Farming level since he'll have to do no preps
---
Not really
---
I also want to know this
---
The return of the King!
---
His dad is Jagex.
---
he just need to vote for bunch of new skills so you can get more levels faster 
---
he is 1276 levels  behind rank #1. Vote for 50 new skills, get lvl 26 in each skill, became rank #1. ez pz.
---
they don't even detect consistent autoclickers.

i've used gary's hood for near 2 decades without being banned.

cape is just a house tab so that doesnt really change anything
---
&gt; Is it worth me paying for protection for all these?
---
Magics no, calquat and palm protection is super cheap so yes.
---
&gt;Additionally is it worth doing herbs or allotments at all? I can do vork/ zulrah etc
---
In terms of gp/hr? No, not really. It's chill and there's no risk of dying, but bossing will be better money if you don't plank.
---
Thank you, beast
---
Catching dragon implings is not really a thing you do regularly. If you're in a CC you might get the occasional call, but it isn't something you should expect to get more than a few times a week at absolute max, if you aren't a big name streamer.
---
This happened to me but with a primordial crystal. I managed to get back on time before it despawned. 
---
Luckily the guy waiting for me to finish my trip was afk, otherwise he could‚Äôve yoinked it.
---
Blessed by the chest?
---
Isnt this the Sigmund artwork from Idle Heroes?
---
yea i mean before that streamer got banned and unbanned in 5 mins i would have said lets wait for the jmod to tell him he's for sure botted. but legit it could be a false positive so who knows.
---
also like i said in my other comment legit it could be rs3 hijacking
---
Your profile looks exactly how I thought it would.
---
Have you heard the Orchestral version of runescape music album?
---
It's pretty amazing, trust me.

I'd at the very least try out vorkath so you can get an assembler. Make sure to use a salve(ei), and a bandos godsword during that time if you can afford it.

Chief, I understand you dislike the phrase "king" and respect you for voicing your opinions, but I implore you to also see the other side of things. People enjoy these wholesome speeches and if it makes them happy, even though we dislike it, we should not discourage them from doing so. After all, we enjoy different things and this does not damage anyone. 
---
Stay safe, chief, and enjoy the subreddit and game.

Once you‚Äôve killed Vorkath for about 100 kills, you start to learn the audio cues associated with all of the attacks, so you really don‚Äôt have to look at all unless you hear a bomb attack or special attack

Wow. As someone who played through the release of the GE to now, I agree with all of the points made.   
---
I mostly play Ironman Mode now, but I'd absolutely be in favor of making the GE available at all (or at least most?) banks. Imagine if the GE was available at all minigame banks. The minigame population issues would likely be solved.
---
I don't think it's possible to go back to the good old fally trading days, but this might be the next best thing.
---
100 percent this dude's been botting.
---
No it‚Äôs not. My friend who was pmod had both his main and alt as pmod. He showed me the mod Center too, kind of weird, you could also vouch for people back in the day,  not sure if that‚Äôs still the case though. Also not gonna lie, I got him to mute people that were ass-hats to me too on many occasions.
---
To get pmod you need to change password and bank pin once a month, if you don‚Äôt do that, no mod for you. High security on your account. He said if you‚Äôre on world 1 &amp; 2 a lot it helps odds, not sure why... also you don‚Äôt need to report people a lot, they‚Äôve just gotta be good reports. Avoid reporting people for bad language and shit, report people who are advertising websites and bots from time to time. Spam reporting is what wana-be-mods do and jamflex doesn‚Äôt like that. Membership isn‚Äôt a requirement, and not a factor to my knowledge either. 
---
There is some element of randomness, but most people don‚Äôt change their account password and pin monthly. Also don‚Äôt have any black marks or else it‚Äôs less likely and don‚Äôt swear obviously or bypass censor.

They said use them at your own risk, they didn't say they are banable they didn't say they are allowed.

remove the duelk arena and this games dies, very quickly.
---
How many hours does 99 rc take?
---
Where is this
---
Not a fan of it personally, but it can work. The thing is regular armor is better than void in almost all cases (there are a few rooms where void range is BiS, but even still there are rooms where d'hide/arma is better). On top of that the defense from regular armor is a lot better, but I suppose there are a few niche scenarios where void might be viable (Like when trying to transition from suicide --&gt; no suicide, prep --&gt; no prep, just so you have the extra inv spaces for more brews).
---
If you're asking if Void would be better than basic welfare gear like ahrims / d'hide / torso, not really.
---
Godly
---
No dsword is superior because no quest requirements and you'll be 70 attack for whip in no time
---
I think some hackers did a long time ago. They somehow got multiple people into the instance to kill jad.

Who?

My dad works for nintendo
---
Of course you CAN fix your bank, most people can't be bothered. I explained why sometjing occured, i didn't endorse it.
---
Also the people who do this are just looking to get the single medium needed for a master clue, not grinding 4k of them.

So how long until the smackdown? Did I miss it??

Welcome to the club. Got my zerker permed for macroing while i was pking. :D ive been pming jmods on twitter and reddit, no1 cares about us non-contentcreators.
---
Ironman btw
---
Personally I would get the ornate pool, ornate jewellery box, mounted xerics, mounted digsite, fairy ring, occult altar and wildy obelisk. everything else is optional in my opinion
---
I found taking the time to do gem mining better than MLM. I rather spend the time actually playing the game for a few hours out the day and get 45kxp+/hr  than getting 30kxp/hr. It‚Äôs also pretty easy to do while watching something on the side. Also the money is 10x better. Currently at 92mining averaging 150k xp a day.
---
:(
---
This is probably a case where Jagex's role is not to protect the player-base from being dumb. I don't want these streamers to exist, so I don't participate, donate, or watch. Encouraging other people to so the same is probably a net good.
---
I think when a streamer advertises "5 bil debt stakes," the player should be smart enough to know they aren't getting their money back. I have to believe they know they're throwing money away.
---
People donating to streamers of this type are arguably participating in player run games of chance, just with 0 return on investment, *at best.* Streamers are arguably running scams. So report them if you like.
---
He just wants more challenge while playing!

bcuz they know I need them gains

Yeah why dont you buy a few 1000s of dollars worth of equipment and just stream for j mods instead.
---
Eh I haven't done it either. Close to 1900 total account about to get my first 99 (range).
---
I enjoy the skill grind far more than I enjoy quests. I was gearing up for ds2 this week and although I have all the requirements now, I've already gotten bored of questing just after doing tale of two cats, icthlarins and legends quest.
---
I hate the feeling of losing progress for questing.
---
Honestly, Cerb isn‚Äôt worth it with at least 75 agility. Summer pie through the wall and also, always keep a spare keymaster TP in your bank in emergency scenarios such as this.
---
Again for the mobile players use your data not company wifi or IT will be on your ass (unless you work in IT ofc ;p)
---
They already said this won't happen
---
Of course but would be a pretty big coincidence for an account that is most likely rendi's and chestbrah to both be at the same place, same world, at off hours
---
I doubt it because I got a 3 day ban for ‚Äúbotting‚Äù as well and I‚Äôve never botted this game before. I just skill and don‚Äôt talk to people and they report me. I‚Äôm lucky because it‚Äôs not a perm ban but still. For the genuine players who get banned for this and it‚Äôs false they are just gonna lose more players, mainly talking about rs3 on this one.
---
Honestly, jagex is in the running for worst gaming company in my book. Someone managed to get past my authenticator, my password, and my bank pin and transfer out everything of value that I'd accrued over seven years. Ive never clicked on anything, or entered my password anywhere other than their website. I don't even use third party clients. They don't give a shit about any of that. Couldn't even be bothered to even respond to my emails. Cancelled the memberships for both my main and my ironman a month ago and haven't looked back.
---
R u a streamer? /s
---
Sorry, I was joking because I'm pretty sure Chestbrah is Rendi
---
Whip for def + attack. Abyssal dagger for str (not poisoned) for optimal exp. If you can afford the abyssal bludgeon it's better for str training.
---
This might be a good idea if the server's weren't shit. I don't mind paying for my own mistakes, but more often than not, any death I've had at top tier PvM has been because of lag, DC, etc.
---
- account sharing (sparc mac's cape, framed's entire youtube channel)
---
- disallowed plugins (all of the streamers)
---
- advertising 3pc (websites)

- poll manipulation (not actually a game rule but should be)
---
- rwt (staker streamers)
---
- spec restore alts multilogging 
---
- scamming (24h donations)

- unofficial games of chance (oakdice)

- encouraging others to break the rules

- inappropriate language (ice poseidon's entire stream)

Any real runescape player is more concerned that you're currently idle here, get ready to rumble brother! Need those xp drops.
---
Maybe quests aren‚Äôt their thing they like doing? I didn‚Äôt finish monkey madness till I was maxed on my main because I hate questing
---
These people make 10 accounts repeat the same steps and yall still find it interesting lmao
---
to be fair op made half a joke
---
Yeah not going to worry about getting blood runes. I only care about maxing asap
---
I'll be getting my first 99 this week. It really isn't much as it's cooking, but the child in me is ecstatic
---
Bonds are rising in price so that means less and less people will resort to black market as gp/$ from bonds increases
---
I works if you think of an ultimate ironman's inventory as their bank.
---
Yep. Banning Bots = Less money for Jamflax.
---
Wait, did you draw this of me? My RSN is Ned and I‚Äôm a skiller with 99 prayer :)
---
Got the same shit. Appeal saying they made a mistake got denied too, didn't think it could be hijacked and used on rs3 so appealed again with apology. Should've gone for hijacked option I guess.
---
90 me bro :d i‚Äôll give you the rest of my ‚Äùluck‚Äù
---
whenever bond prices go up third party gold site prices go down. been like that forever now
---
If your in a clan I guess you could go dks if they're 3 of you in total hopefully you can get lucky.
---
You could also do barrows, which i would def recommend, do trips in w330 to use someones ornate pool and use barrows tabs to get there fast. Just use ibans blast as your magic spell.
---
Training your fletching- making maple longbows + should give you some small profit
---
You could also look into alching some items for money
---
Training agility the marks of grace are over 9k (You need to exchange them for amylase crystals (10 marks for 1 box))
---
You wouldn't start making much money from slayer (besides hard clues) until 65 (for dust devils) 72 (for wyverns) 75 (gargs) so you could train slayer and hope for those task while you level up
---
only with rs famous people. i made framed his fury in the first DMM
---
Yeah, that's true. I guess that's why I've always been a fan of something like artisan to some degree. Do x task in y location for z reward. That would definitely be a way to get people spread out and doing things in different locations.
---
Congratulations on level 99 firemaking!
---
Ikr pre upstairs kinda not worth it
---
He didn't even lose to swamp man in one of the awards.
---
He lost to some guy piggybacking off swamp man by making some 2 minute meme video.
---
So dont you have some studying to do then
---
I feel you brother some one hacked my old account from like 2009 and it got deleted completely
---
Yes they are for old accounts on first offences.
---
Pg&amp;e cut power to the part of California that doesn't get wildfires.
---
Example: 
---
Humboldt county has redwood trees which are pretty much immune to fire, power got cut at 1 mph.  Pg&amp;e leaves power on in a place with an active fire and decides oh yeah let's turn this off a few days in, but leave the surrounding areas on.
---
Besides the art, congrats dude. Ranged is my favourite skill
---
Sorry haha, varrock center
---
Click on it ;)) ^^^happy ^^^early ^^^halloween
---
I know, and also I‚Äôm sure that 2 minutes of swampman walking around is easy to watch and go ‚Äúheh funni meme‚Äù but a 41 minute video about game mechanics and killing Jad is something a lot of people are afraid to click on. Rendi definitely has the more entertaining content right now in my opinion. But you need a lot of free time to binge a few of his videos.
---
Mama mia
---
Only been back at uni for a month, haven‚Äôt really started any proper work yet.
---
Totally possible, just RNG based.
---
Thats a terrifying but in a way, beautiful view.
---
are you suggesting that if OP said "whos gonna tell him that you can't achieve #1 on the hiscores due to someone already reaching the maximum XP in the game" that would be a better title?
---
News to me, they've always been weeks, months or permanent.
---
Most Def.
---
&gt;Again I honestly haven‚Äôt botted, it wouldn‚Äôt make any sense to with that many hours on an account. 
---
This is as old an excuse as "the dog ate my homework"
---
How long has it been since we've had a smackdown?
---
&gt;if you're so much about efficiency why the fuck ur killing drakes  
---
  
---
Spinnin' straight flax
---
Chargebacking back in the day is the reason why we got trade limits and pvp in wildy was removed. Banks basically just told Jagex to fix their shit because a ton of cardholders were chargebacking purchases from Jagex.
---
Its fairly possible it was actually breached.  Jagex isn't known for their stellar account security.
---
My luck was like this too, but stick with it man, ive almost completed my 2nd ballista at just over 900 kc!
---
Then dont play on mobile while the bug still isn't fixed. Are you really bitching this much because of 400k?
---
When you create a prayer potion with the herblore skill it will be a 3 dose potion; the current price of a Prayer Potion(3) is ~7800gp, Ranarr Potion(unf) is ~8200gp, Snape Grass and vial around ~180gp which leads to a loss of around 600gp depending on how hard you get merched. This makes training herblore by making prayer potions approximately 6.8gp/xp if these prices are accurate :&gt;
---
Sure. If jamflex got their shit together and managed to ban scouting bots, or the sharing of high level accounts ROT and other clans do (to hold down rev caves on 2k+ worlds), then it would be fine. The fact is it's too easy to exploit the current system due to jagex's incompetence.
---
I really enjoy this series. It's pretty eye opening as someone who generally thinks of the GE as a positive for the game. (I don't miss needing to do bank sales every few days to get rid of stuff I don't need). Would really love if they got rid of ge and moved it to every bank to bring back some life to the game.
---
The one thing I'm concerned about is it would essentially turn the crafting guild into the new ge for a lot of higher leveled people. I already spend more time there than at the ge itself.
---
Yeah i agree, barely anyone talks about the game anymore.
---
Barbarianism?
---
What?
---
You never really quit, you just take extented breaks.
---
Isn't woodcutting the opposite of this
---
This is why rs players doesn‚Äôt have a gf
---
I think the cc is osrs soa or something like that. Check in the list under minigames teleports, then click join chat.
---
Ah lame. Was hoping to do some thieving on mobile while I wasn't home
---
Well i guess for pking it is good? But otherwise its kinda useless since ure limiting urself in content then?
---
Isn‚Äôt the farming skill a better representative for this cause?
---
Hahaha that's what I meant. Just woke up when I posted man, leave me alone.
---
Oh yeah, getting all the diaries done was one of my first goals. Don't think I'd be doing gems if I had to do the aboveground stuff.
---
Thats just what it seemed like but thanks for the tool
---
Lol thanks brother.  No one there even knew what osrs is. The caption in the photo was funny, thought I'd share. Cheers
---
Oh my god that hurt to watch! Press F to pay respects.
---
I think they talked about something similar once in dev stream, they would love to do it but it would need engine work, which makes it probeably not worth the effort
---
Torfinn destroyed my lunar staff fuck him
---
i figured it's better in a group but social interaction is scarier than accidentally teleporting to deep wildy with my cash stack so i'd kinda rather not y'know
---
Yes. 
---
When I am mining or fishing with mobile I work more tbh :p
---
For the people saying farming would be better/woodcutting is the wrong skill.
---
It's called penance, they're giving back inturn for how many trees they took
---
I always assumed it was ironmen cleaning out space. but then again why would an ironman go to the GE
---
Hey OP, if you're using an amulet of chemistry and want to see your average loss on PPots, multiply the 4 dose pot price by .7875, then subtract the value of the ranarr and snape grass.
---
Actually I'm looking at it rn and there's a break even/profit point at market value. OP ignore this, that money/xp is mine
---
You're right, jagex messed this one up which makes this game.....
---
Unplayable.
---
First i was like GG m8 then i was like GG mate
---
Nice, front row seats to witness al-Baghdadi's assassination in Syria
---
So adding strength level will let my ranged attack hit higher damage more frequently or something like that?
---
And I'm still 100% ok with that.
---
The reason anyone is able to make good money flipping on the GE is that it's not 100% liquid and people would rather get their item now and pay an extra 200k than wait 15 minutes before they can go do what they want to do. GE prices are a good representation of what items are trading at within certain error bounds.
---
Flippers offer a service of making the GE more liquid by increasing trade volume. They skim a little off the top for their efforts.
---
Didn‚Äôt see it mentioned yet, but obviously don‚Äôt freely give away your recovery information. Getting into your email doesn‚Äôt really matter as much as long as the hijackers don‚Äôt know any of your account recovery info like your first dog‚Äôs name or what your last 3 passwords were.
---
That is a very good question that I'm not sure I have a good answer for.
---
I don't know if there's anything too wrong about using the same accounts for moneymaking, but I can definitely understand if some people oppose it.
---
Jagex nearly got ditched by Visa/Mastercard back in the day because of massive fraud.
---
I have a feeling its about to happen again.
---
Correct answer.
---
There wouldn't be anyone left for this guy to fall in on with his team if everybody who went solo decided to give up on deep wild pking, which is what we are heading for.

That‚Äôs partially correct, yeah. Mainly for items with more stable pricing.

I wasn't giving my opinion on how to do vorkath. I'm just stating that if you are using a blowpipe, the most gp/hr is to bgs spec twice, kill, tele out. doing more than 1 kill per trip is less gp/hr than going for more kills per trip. I'm not arguing that you can indeed do more than 1 kill per trip, it's just not worth it gp/hr wise.
---
I'm aware you're going to get cleaned eventually, as I said in my post. And if you know any basic grade school math (statistics/probabilities) you know it's dumb to stake at all just from the numbers point of view....
---
cant wear ROS without 75 hp iirc
---
You can get a fire cape in rs3 on a level 3 without bug abuse these days, and that's without using those instant kill darts on everything.
---
It takes this man a little more than an hour to do the Inferno god damn.
---
Set private to public like everybody nah jk just get rid of f2p worlds
---
I'm only aware because my zerker that still uses a username (pre emails) got a 2 day ban, it was justified though I was autoclicking high alch lol. but that was about 2 or 3 months ago
---
Chief! Thank you greatly, i wish you the best for this comment, may your beard never tangle and your beers never spill.
---
I‚Äôm like 107. I‚Äôm lazy and never do much more than slayer. 
---
I died to jad last night. Got him half health then those healers fucked me off.
---
I mean, he laughs?
---
43 prayer puts you at 8 combat my friend, and the ring of suffering requires 75 hitpoints, which would be 19 cb
---
His gf went to plug in her phone and pressed to turn off his pc by accident. The "are you sure you want to close these programs" screen popped up and he clicked to cancel turning off. Runelite had closed automatically from powering down but streaming software didnt yet.
---
Ironman like kempQ? To not gain hp xp
---
I'm reporting you to Mastercard and Visa for fraud.
---
Me destroying something that someone spent hundreds to thousands of hours on would make me feel bad. This is the type of laugh you respond with when you fuck over a mate and inconvenience him a little. There's no actual regret to be found in her response. That's why she's a bitch, she's acting as if it's just a little oopsy doopsy mistake.
---
Why should this be stopped?
---
The viewers lend to the streamers they enjoy watching with their own accord. No one is forcing them to do this. 
---
If the lender trusts the streamer, then that‚Äôs THEIR decision.
---
Stop being a little baby.
---
Or if your an Ironman you can start the quest, and then you can enter. You don‚Äôt have to finish the quest.
---
I don't believe this is against game rules, though could be wrong.
---
Idk why you are going to reddit though, just ignore him.
---
If his answer isn't tele grabbing those coins and rings under the bank in varrock then what is he doing with his life
---
No me
---
Please make N0TANA1T a pmod he is a good person and totally not me.
---
Don't know who kempq is just want to stay 10hp and not ironman
---
Started playing again a month or so ago and tried to get my fire Cape yesterday, literally became so nervous at Jad I couldn't move my mouse properly.  The mental block is real
---
Getty fire?
---
Rather it be through an official medium than the shady unofficial shit like the dicing bots.
---
It's as "fair" of a system as gambling could ever be.
---
Can‚Äôt believe i need to write /s when I post things so blatantly sarcastic over and over
---
Did this boss last night with same setup as you and 75 magic. Just used brews and restores. I took about 8 restores the rest brews. Don't worry about your health so much for the first 3 specials she does. Just focus on damage output and responding to her special attacks correctly.
---
Right after the healing stage, start to brew up, get to 1 sip from overhealing and then when she freezes you take that last dose to overheal for the special, you'll be fine. As soon as you tank the hit heal up to like 3/4 health and then restore to get your mage level back up. Then focus on damage until the healing stage again. Rinse and repeat.
---
Honestly using blood blitz is useless cause the health you gain does not payoff compared to the damage you can deal for that same hit. Your better off just dealing as much damage as possible and using the brews to heal. Try not to heal until after her healing stage, but if you need to don't be afraid too. 
---
Remember on the stage where she splits into multiple forms, the correct form to hit has a lighter glow underneath than the rest of them.
---
Last tip, don't get within melee range, you'll take unnecessary damage. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Damn. I have like 5-6 in &gt;700 kills lol
---
Technicallyyyy still a stalfos.  And only appears in twilight princess üòè
---
Blame the guy flexing in the GE, not the person who took a screenshot
---
There's been a guy with 7 or so bots spamming "orange man good" stuff for a year (I think) in RS3 lumbridge.
---
*Laughs in wine of zamorak*
---
It also baffles me how streamers have access to other people's accounts. Account sharing was against the rules back in the day. Did they just get rid of that rule? That also goes for PK content creators. Some use others' accounts to try items or setups.
---
wow very good to know thanks
---
Easy game.
---
Hopefully. Dumb girl
---
I mean he did specifically say ‚Äútan leather,‚Äù it‚Äôs not unreasonable to take the words used at face value.
---
Unlikely any power got cut off since he stayed live and the mic was still working.
---
Most people with 200ms don't want the xp cap to be raised. I don't know who that would serve.
---
I agree with this, just sit down and do it. I did zmi the whole way to 77 and at a certain point it just stopped sucking
---
ur being berated because u said as a student u could have 18 hrs to play rs, people are trying to say that if u have 18 free hrs as a student u are probably mismanaging ur priorities (don‚Äôt shoot the messenger pls)
---
Ah. Didn't think of that one. I'm genuinely confused then. Poison bone dagger? But that would make xp gain. To poison. Only other options would be -65 or whatever range accuracy,  and emerald bolt speccing to poison and hit 0, but I'm not sure how that would be possible. Would be something to look into though.
---
Gonna have to find a new excuse!
---
I think the solution to this might be something like a GE tax. It takes gold out of the game and encourages people who want the best deals to go trade person to person, but I think most people will continue to use the GE.
---
This annoyed the hell out of me during the quest. Makes virtually no sense from a lore perspective and felt like an incredibly forced cash sink.
---
Thanks man this is really helpful
---
Found the scammer
---
i just bought bonds for 84 con
---
Don‚Äôt need people telling me what I should and shouldn‚Äôt be doing without knowing any circumstances. Shit is fucking hilarious y‚Äôall preaching to a stranger, who they know nothing about.
---
I have extremely similar stats to you but I don't use many supplies at all. I use trident of swamp, blowpipe with mith darts, then I wear guthans chest and legs for tank stuff nezzy helm, d boots barrows gloves. If I get lucky with verac in the tunnels or something I can do an entire run without prayer pots or food.
---
Bloods are less xp/hr, you spend less time doing rc through souls, imagine wanting to spend more time runecrafting lul
---
rc is my favorite skill and i like to afk moneymake
---
so bloods are perfect
---
Buying new gf  10k

The method for 17 would be the exact same just depends on how your rng is is the cave whether you gain the extra level or not

yeah same ive only been playing since 2017 and im lvl 32 idk how these guys have so much time to grind

wtf rs3 has insta-kill darts..?
---
Where are we going?

I remember the ‚Äútricking‚Äù days... ahh good times.  You could just risk like 50k and ‚Äúbuild‚Äù an item potential meter and get crazy drops in pvp.  It was broken.

Did you just assume the dagganoth king's genders?

I agree that the streamers shpuldnt stream that content, but why on earth act like a 6 yr old and make mommy jagex stop it? Sure its stupid, but its their gp. Why should we decide what theyre allowed to do with it?

That‚Äôs the point of the title

wtf, how???

---
Not sure about yak armor but I know frem shield reduces hit a lot against the ice trolls when I cannon. You still need protect from melee but the shield blocks a lot of the ranged hits so that you can heal with just monkfish for the entire task.

This tweet doesn't seem to mention anything about legality - was there another, or was that just an assumption that was made?

Sad part is I need 28m to get from 48-80 using mahogany planks. Should give those to me instead!

You know....

The game was rigged from the start

That's a cool idea, like the north and south pole.

If you need proof still of global warming this is Wintertodt.

Oh god dude. I‚Äôd recommend oak ladders till you can do oak dungeon doors xD I used to do mahogany tables in rs2 when my bank was like 3m lmao. Alternatively you can switch to mahogany when you can do mounted mythical capes. Slightly more than dungeon doors but a bit faster too
---
Just do birdhouses. I‚Äôve got 83 hunter and maybe only trained 15 levels myself somewhere in the 30-40 range. The rest has all come from birdhouse runs

If you're good at lavas less than 200 from level 1. If you do the normal route you're looking at 400ish from level 1.

"omg haha :D oops"

Rune items? Kid,go complete MM1

Bruh that's way too many switches for a first timer. BP w/ Addy darts and God dhide is all you need, guthans only during first 62 waves.  
---
When the healers come, completely ignore attacking jad, and focus on one click per prayer switch. Get all 4 healers, one at a time, and then back to jad. You'll be starting at his full health again most likely, but then it's literally just a game of swapping prayer until he's dead.
---
Huge if Factual
---
So I'm just jumping in here to say, I suicided my main a while  in an attempt to finally say "fuck this game im done" and botted divination for like a week straight on rs3,  a couple years later I saw that you could appeal it, and decided to do so, and it got denied..
---
I had tried a few more times since then even though it says repeat appeals will be ignored, just to see if anything happened with no luck.
---
Not too long ago I made a post with my story and reasoning behind suiciding the account in the main RS sub, it got next to zero attention, pretty sure it had 0 upvotes, so Im pretty sure no Jmods or anything saw it but who knows, I made the post directly after making another appeal and the title was along the lines of "I wish jagex would give appeals a second look"
---
Few days later I got unbanned, can't remember if I deleted the post due to the shame of 0 upvotes and likely mocking comments but I never bothered to check what anything on that post said, I just gave my genuine story and apology and put my accounts name in
---
Again, I'm almost certain the post had nothing to do with it, being buried so low on the sub by being immediately downvoted to 0 and staying there, but for what it's worth I think on rare occasions jagex will take a second look at the account and the ban, my best guess would honestly be that you have to wait about 5 years, at least for a major offense like botting, because after many tries and years I finally got that email telling me how exceedingly rare it is and lucky I am for the chance and that my account will be heavily watched going forward or whatever
---
I don't encourage people to spam jagex with these, seriously, don't abuse the system, but it doesn't hurt to put in that yearly appeal, and just see what happens if you lost an account you genuinely loved because after years I finally got mine back
---
Haven't touched it since because my new account is better, I'm such a dickhead
---
Edit: yeah seems like I deleted the post, it's extremely unlikely it had any factor in my eventual unbanning but who knows
---
[here's proof, I realize the date discrepancy on the messages, but the denied one is from 2017, Google doesn't show the year in the actual message for whatever reason, I can easily prove this if need be](https://imgur.com/a/GdH3Vpm)
---
Kemp q has very little actual talent or knowledge of game mechanics I really doubt this is him. 
---
Lately he has been busy making fucking main progress videos and slowly fading into irrelevancy.
---
Reading your post you didn't get a cape at level 3, you reset your stats after getting it which is completely different
---
Do... You know what a drag queen is?
---
Mmhm. I splashed in lumby for days after the ban just to annoy people.

Oh hi there

---
Yeah I‚Äôm not using the guthans after the 62nd wave. Just to get there with minimal pot usage. I just camp a safe spot waiting for spec to come back and use it on the weaklings to gain prayer. I get to 62nd without barely taking a scratch. Then dhide up for jad. It‚Äôs just the jad bit that‚Äôs getting me. 
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind when I try later tonight. Cheers
---
jagex doesn't have customer support
---
Are you in the white towers on wilshire and barrington?
---
Keep the gloves and torches they swap for magic and torstol seeds
---
No, he's right that it's not content everyone can enjoy. Swampletics is content you can enjoy with little prior knowledge of OSRS and it is easily shown by the fact people outside of OSRS actively follow the Swampletics series.
---
Lower the Better is content only people who play Runescape could really understand because the relevance of something like the lowest level combat Prifdinnas entry is just so specific.
---
And lastly, that's also just your opinion. Just because you find it interesting does not immediately mean it is interesting for everyone else, which is the major factor here. It's not a matter of if you enjoy it, it's a matter of how many people enjoy it as a whole, and as seen by the Runefest awards, people did not enjoy 18 cb Jad as much as Lil Smokey's video.

I mean didn‚Äôt they come out and say that the reality is MTX is the only thing keeping RS3 profitable? You could argue that MTX caused a large exodus, but we all know EOC was the real tipping point where RS started to die

To be fair they cost 5m gp each where you only get to buy a few per year, don't award KC or drop log credit, and you can only get a handful of "free" ones per year from certain events.

Mostly used by noobs to try to RNG a drop for money or by end game players to save GP at telos in case they risk dying.

I'd probably fly into an incoherent rage if I just had 2,500 hours of my life thrown away. There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself. What matters is where it is directed. Raging over the unfortunate situation would be fine, raging at her would cross a line.
---
This perfectly encapsulates where I am right now.

Thank you for this.

Some people can't stand to actually play the game.

People log if they think they're PID is bad and try to work around it, but as far as I know, there's no way to actually manipulate it so you always have PID.

Don't care if it works it works

you‚Äôre suggesting on behalf of not even considering playing the mini game, you must be a Pvmer or skillet by nature

Agreed, would have had to pay over 20m for 2 cerb disconnects today because of connection issues.

Bots are the reason for that.

You don't use regular essence to make soul runes. You need to chip dense essence from the two rocks in-between the blood alter and soul alter on Zeah. It's pretty afk/chill

That is nothing and it's hilarious

How'd you get enough money for a dhcb.. and why are you killing steel dragons??
---
Absolutely sick üëå
---
Imagine posting on reddit to gain sympathy for your own screw up and being mad when you get told the truth.
---
not even close lol
---
Personally I did a mix of ZMI and Zeah library whenever I got bored of one I'd switch to the other. It's a slog for sure but you just gotta push through it.
---
If you're betting an infinite amount of times, sure. If you have 10bil and are starting at 1k, it's statistically pretty unlikely for you to get cleaned.
---
If my math's right you'd need to lose 13 times in a row which has less than a 0.001% chance of happening.
---
Gambling isn't engraved so deeply into this game, though. Most players don't stake often enough for it to be the major factor in why they play this game. If the duel arena were removed entirely, there would not be a mass exodus like the removal of wildy and free trade.
---
Go to the wiki and look up the task weights.
---
Y'all are being assholes; good luck learning how to exploit the system prick. As far as I know exploits simply have to do with checking your PID before a duel to make sure it's lower than yout opponents.
---
Quests weren't even fun the first time
---
lol it was actually like a slow 8 month grind, but before those 8 months i hadn't played since 07/08

No they're quoting the actual source smh

this is why people call the pvp community toxic lmao
---
Id rather gtfo RC jail and finish the rest of the max grind. I was going to sell the runes I got for construction/fletching/smithing so doing bloods makes no sense when I could kill Hydra or Votkath for money and just buy the bloods later. I'm an Ironman if you didn't know.

Fishing is one of the longer skills. Just because it is largely afk and not super high intensity doesn't mean it's not worth celebrating

full obby will be your best dmg on low defense enemies, which crabs are, also you only need to use a str/super str pot, att pot will not help as your att level is already high enough to hit around 99% of the time.

Well, group ironman was announced as a project like a year or so ago. It was only announced officially at Runefest. For such a large update, I feel it was appropriate. I‚Äôm in the same boat though, can‚Äôt wait to play it!

Bit of a misleading title then, was wondering why he wasn't angry that she had done it intentionally.
---
Yea I wanna know
---
For real though, what's the big deal in letting players toggle between trimmed and untrimmed skillcapes once they have multiple 99s?  How does this break anything?  I just don't understand why JMods are so adamant about sticking to the status quo on this one.  Let people use the cape they want.
---
0/90 prayer, might as well start all over.
---
Turbovirgin
---
First at 212
---
Second at 234 KC. But it was from the second crate of a 10 crate inventory.

So you could say it was 226 I guess.

Aww ;( sux
---
So I'm assuming he bought the extra life right? Thats why he can still log into the character? Cause otherwise its completely locked right?

This doesn‚Äôt take attack levels and hit frequency into account the actual dps increase isn‚Äôt going to come close to 1/15 faster.

Got it on my 8th try... It gets easier
---
Agreed. I dont like these streams but it seems like theyre really popular. Abyss and odablock come to mine and they can pull 300-1000 viewers which does advertise the game a fair bit. 
---
Its really just like a soft donation. Most understand they wont see their money again but theres always a chance you get it back. So in my opinion we should ban accepting donations if anything as thats the real problem here, not ban ‚Äúdonating to streamers for them to stake/pk‚Äù

Missed opportunity have a 19 it inside the arena instead of a 73
---
It was less than 7 seconds, and his PC didn't turn off.
---
You also have to factor in the reaction time from when you realise the power button has been hit to turn in off, before you turn it on.
---
This is really well done. Some thoughts that came to my mind we‚Äôre having a character in the scene wear a blue party hat and spectacles (Sparc being an iconic staker), also having a character wield a hasta in front of the no scamming sign.
---
Stop giving out your info and you wont get hacked.

I used to kill guards there as a kid because the ones outside the bank were always taken
---
best part is that you're no closer to getting a shard than you were on 1kc
---
Doesn't matter what amount you're using it will come out the same. There is no benefit to this betting method. The expected return of each stake long term will be negative (due to tax), if there were no tax the expected return would still be 0 (no gain or loss).
---
this clip is far better
---
I brought the pitchforks! ‚Äî‚Ç¨
---
No that's not how HCIM works. If you die on a HCIM it just makes you a regular ironman and you can continue playing.
---
They offered it and people said no because having to wait 1 month ahead of some people for a cosmetic 99% of the community won‚Äôt see is unacceptable. 
---
Even though some need to wait 11 months to get the Halloween skin, but that‚Äôs different some how..
---
So discouraging
---
All those hours of mining and its less than one good solo raid reward
---
Would've been reasonable for him to be angry, thats 110+ days of his life down the shitter.
---
To add to this, the motivation at ZMI spikes once you hit 75 and get the Giant pouch going.  Once you hit 75, getting 77 is a mentally a breeze.
---
yea that animation is choppy af
---
Ahh okay then
---
Ive been just doing herb patches for farming so i didnt know of that use

lumbridge is the closest to a bank without paying 5m for the edgeville one

It's NOT opinion, it's objective fact.  Look at the popularity of settled and look at the popularity of Rendi. Rendi isn't a 5th of settled because he's newer or anything like that.  It's because his content has a higher barrier to entry.  People need to be invested in RuneScape first to even remotely have any idea what it is he's accomplishing and how he's doing it.  People don't need to know much about RuneScape to see that Settled is playing a game locked to a region that makes it harder, and it's clear that it's ridiculously harder because he's jumping over a bridge 9000 times and falling on his face repeatedly.  But it's entertaining because of the commentary and set pieces he makes.
---
It's essentially why the big YouTubers became big YouTubers.  They made easy to digest content on topics that people don't need much knowledge for.  Muselk became huge playing video games, first TF2 then Overwatch, then Fortnite, because he was making generic but overall ridiculous content that was always funny to watch, regardless of how much you knew about the games.
---
Now does that mean that Rendi isn't working as hard as these kinds of people?  Absolutely not.  The time and effort that Rendi puts into his videos is massive, probably even exponentially more than Settled for some episodes.  It's just unfortunate that he's doing it for a niche audience.  He's a hard worker, he's a fantastic content creator, and he's genuinely a great guy.  But he's just not making the right videos for widespread mass appeal.  I've got nothing but respect for him, but that doesn't change the fact that his content is next to impossible to enjoy without knowing a sizable chunk of the game before watching.
---
Obviously that doesn't justify it at all so why even bring it up lol, she threw some cardboard at him. Oh no
---
if you dont play the game heres some advice, just use runecrafting as a bargaining chip and youll get whatever you want
---
Thank you all for the kind words and the people that have graced me with awards! So glad everyone seems to like this one! I'm always looking for new ideas. Feel free to suggest any ideas for my next piece on this thread! 
---
^(And if you really just need to see something painted, I do commissions! A print order will be made in the next week as well so hop on the train if you want this or any of my other pieces. Contact info can be found on my profile page.)
---
How high is OP?
---
Yeah this is terrible.
---
I‚Äôm F2P

---
I did back in the day in Varrock in any of the houses/walls.
---
It was just so suspicious when someone went there and you could see them all on the minimap if you were on the second floor yourself so I'd book it there.
---
This was way back then when my brother, 2 sisters and I all played.
---
And THEN we were teaching our mom how to play and were in Varrock and saw someone acting dodgy. So we went and intercepted three full rune sets.
---
Considering what a rune set used to mean in f2p long before ge and stuff, she was set for life. She quickly was able to buy all the best gear in f2p and resources and quickly outleveled my siblings and I, ran out of things in f2p and then bought members (the original reason we showed her the game because we knew as kids, our parents would never fork out money for a subscription game mwhahahaa)
---
So thanks drop traders \^\_\^
---
Oh right! Sorry my dude.
---
No comments or anything
---
First task I got 4 zenytes, managed to get 5 zenytes in one task another time, basically rocketted me to be raids ready.
---
i kept one to put it on helm but put the other in g/e for 31m and it sold instantly for 31.5m
---
man im 2k chests dry at barrows still no gloves :/
---
World 420?
---
neat
---
If people get scammed, it's their own stupid fault. 
---
Can we stop with this 'ban this' 'remove this' nonsense. For starters, it's literally impossible to enforce considering Twitch and Jagex cannot collaborate to stop phishing streams.
---
We did it Reddit
---
Nice, I'm 2k dry

smelting :P
---
There is no profitable f2p smithing.
---
I'm leaving this comment though in case I am wrong and learn something new.
---
For real. If it wasn't for EOC I'd probably still be playing RS3 tbh. Curses are probably still my favorite update ever to hit runescape. I wish they'd bring them to osrs, albeit a nerfed version, but turmoil would be awesome, as would reflection prayers if they didn't block 100% dmg.
---
We‚Äôre you using an auto clicker or anything similar?
---
"These bonuses stack with the bonuses of its ammunition. For example, using¬†dragon darts¬†on the charged blowpipe will increase its Ranged attack to +78, and its Ranged strength to +60."
---
nope game is completely dead now, not a single person logs on anymore
---
Ive had bad expierence with trawler My self, I was there for over a hundred games,12 minutes a game. I wasnt having a Good time. However ive seen people get the full set in 2 hrs. RNG is real
---
What if she sees someone in crazy endgame armour, like full Mithril? You won't stand a chance of keeping her!
---
what.
---
You need to get 100% favor with the big 5 software companies FAANG, it's a real hassle because if you help one the favor of the others goes down.
---
So, do you keep it on the iron as useless fashionscape, or main it for 26m?
---
Thanks for the feedback! I guess it truly boils down to accessibility to ease time to 200m all (via gp) and if you consider gp an overall valid metric in the ‚Äútime‚Äù it takes to max
---
Game is more alive than ever and twitch presence is still a top 30-10 game out of thousands. U might just be remembering watching twitch when an event was going on like dmm. 
---
Just get mems right away.
---
Shoulda just said you were from Europe or Canada
---
Yeah, I think in this situation I'll happily stay uncool and keep that remaining shred of sanity I've got...
---
Rs is mainly a sandbox mmo so u do whatever at your own pace. If you want a goal i suggest working on the dragon slayer quest. Use the wiki for help if you need to. If u still enjoy the game after that i highly recommend buying members.
---
Aau is so fun I actually dropped classic wow for it (and I am a huge wow fan)
---
Slay queen yaaaaassss
---
Ty for clearing it up. Lol i was 99% sure but couldn't remember if anywhere actually had attack bonuses listed for them. But just going off the obvious fact they SHOULD have higher accuracy i assumed as much, plus not to mention the simple tests of me using both and noticed higher tiers hit way more frequently, not just higher.
---
Idk man. I‚Äôm making 600k-1m an hour with gem mining and come close to 52kxp/hr if I‚Äôm paying attention. You know the wiki comes close to the actual average right? Blast mining was also the same if not a bit less. If I was doing something wrong so be it but I‚Äôm happy at gem mining and you saying it‚Äôs bad because of rates that honestly don‚Äôt even seem that achievable unless you‚Äôre in the 90s in mining is kind of ignorant. TBH
---
43 Fletching?!? "Maxed"

Crazy good

Roaming Revs is pvm
---
Barrows sisters just being the girls from avatar
---
Not a terrible idea TBH, cheers. I'll mull over it for sure
---
Not really. Your email is the fence.
---
Random people shouldn't be easily getting access to your email to remove your authenticator. That's YOUR problem, not jagex's.
---
I guess you could say jagex gives you a gate for your fence, now if your fence is shit, a gates not very helpful right?
---
Rev caves are the wildy

Lost 7b this weekend over a few stakes.  Was at 1b two weeks ago, which was the highest I had ever been, and managed to win all the way up to a max of 9b.  At that point though, raiding and playing the game seemed dull because I had every item in the game and 1b in supplies.  Why go do raids for 3 hours and hope to make a few mil when I could go win that at the casino in 30 seconds? It is true: both losing *and* winning ruin the game.
---
Good to see, Im trying to add that human element  that the bots can't really provide, maybe a short analysis for the g.e newbies. Cheers for the feedback!
---
HAHAHAHA made me lol hard
---
Haha funny original meem
---
Is there a use for this?
---
It's a fucking mmorpg deal with it or fuck off
---
What if...
---
We kissed inside lumbridge castle?
---
My favorite is zooming into the people in the back. High quality illustration right there
---
Why are you asking for the best slayer master for a basilisk task if the weight for the knights hasn‚Äôt been released yet?
---
Yea tbh the advice was good, i used range protect for my last kills and will use it in the future. The way he told the advice in the other hand wasn't so good.
---
It‚Äôs time to r-r-r-r-repost!
---
This is fucking sick mate great work
---
Thanks for the advice friend, will definitely be thinking thrice.
---
That PKer's name? Albert Einstein.
---
Ahh, never forget the "Join party in daemonheim, cast tele to daemonheim which stalls your game, then your teammate enters into daemonheim and kicks you from party, forcing you to join a random instance on the world once your long ass teleport animation finishes" ol' paftaroo.
---
I did this a lot and the best ones were walking on the sea or joining other peoples dungeons and harrassing them. There is currently a mostly unknown smuggle you can still do in OSRS regarding a certain minigame and quest, but they made them a lot more difficult to smuggle as you can't teleport or walk without releasing the House Options menu. You can smuggle a few animations out of the same minigame by doing this as well (teleport out of minigame, press house options when the teleport animation ends).

Thank you that calculator helped a lot!
---
It‚Äôs a bar down the street from your place bro, look it up :) we could meet somewhere else though too, I have a friend from my clan in Burbank as well I bet he would be down to come, we both are lvl 120+
---
I‚Äôm with you on that one man. Spent the past week grinding it nonstop. I got to level 60, moved to Werewolf training in Caniff and fell a few times taking damage, no biggie I still have 30hp. Fall again for 30 damage. I sat there and stared at my screen for a good minute. Crazy stuff.
---
Ring of cheat codes: Makes the Event rpg 360 noscope always hit, and allow it to be used at long range.
---
What if I told you pmods are actually just regular players
---
You're not funny
---
Just if u grind it make sure to have fremmy elite diary u will be guaranteed decent gp that way.
---
Ring of Odds: consumables have a 50/50 chance of having either a double effect or no effect (example: eating a shark will either heal 40 hitpoints or 0).
---
no lie its actually quite helpful, atleast at ZMI since the altar clickbox is so small, and is located right next to the clickbox of a tunnel that you could missclick on.
---
People over estimating how much we have to do. Then also tryna lecture me on what to do with my time. Fucking jokes man haha.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if troll
---
I saw a dude standing outside inferno other day on 169KC complaining about pet. Is that you?
---
What if I‚Äôm mobile only?
---
The hilt looks like plastic
---
Never got anything off hards, but I got cape of skulls off an ez clue which is 21m. It's something.
---
if I ever get to a point where I need a plugin to help with an altar that takes up literally 15% of the standard clients window I'm just hang up my clicking finger bud.
---
We got the best OC in the land boys.
---
That's not nearly as bad as it seems, because the only advantage you get is 1 extra attack with 0 stats, compared to actual pid manipulation (that I think is most likely superstition, honestly) which is an extra attack with an 82/82 stat weapon.
---
Fire cape before dragon defender? Huh, I did it backwards. Gz either way!
---
Ya. 1 def pure of some sort
---
woosh
---
So so good
---
Someone should tell him uims can note pots now at decanting npcs
---
He also didn't have a ring of life. It won't save you all the time, but even if bosses average 30s on you (they don't), it saves you 1/3 of the time.
---
Honestly, Staking as a whole should be removed.

Dagger?
