That's mostly subjective but people often get impressed by levels that take a really long time or are particularly tedious
---
1 year old account, no comments, and first post ever? I'm confused
---
No shit? That's awesome
---
You are a Mo foe
---
I'd ask you the same
---
Sad face, I'm over 1500 I won't be upset until I hit 5k with no drop lol
---
As far as i can see slash and crush defence is the same for both wyverns?
---
Don't forget to turn on auto retaliate
---
Set goals. Short, medium, and long term ones... short term like gaining x amount of exp today, medium example could be getting from 40 to 60 attack to use dragon weaponry, and a long term could be barrows gloves; avas assembler; or like quest Cape.  
---

---
Depending how far into the game you are can help shape your goals.  For example, I had a long term goal of diary Cape and used all the individual tasks for a given area as short and med term goals to keep me motivated to working towards the Cape.  If you just look at the reqs for it and see 86 runecrafting (91 without a boost) you're likely to say f-that right out the gate but getting to the various levels to do other tasks like 77 for fremmy elites, 82 I think it was for lumby, then finally 86 for karamja makes it not seem as bad and it gives you milestones to enjoy along the way.  
---
Granted runecrafting is probably the worst example to use, you can substitute in any skill or big goal you have then break it up into smaller grinds to help keep you motivated.  Hope this helps :)
---
99 range grinding brutal blacks. I use elite void, salve ammy, dhcb. Don’t wanna spend the 60m on rigour yet but I might. Good luck bro I love this boss. Currently on task

It’s all fun and games until you come home one day and walk in on her doing inferno on one account, killing Vorkath on a second account, killing Zulrah on a third account, tick-manipulated skilling on a fourth account, and deep wildy PKing on a fifth account, all simultaneously.

u/SlayerKrex: “Hey babe, I’m home. How’s the - what the fuck!?!?”

GF: (*Hastily turns off monitor, grabs iPad, and logs into u/SlayerKrex’s account*) “Oh hey! I was just chopping some Eucalyptus trees with the red axe, haha! Am i doing it right?”
---
That’s an npc

And you barely got anything for it
---
Ass
---
yes
---
The best thing that you can do to complete fight caves very easily, is to lvl range to 75 and buy a toxic blowpipe and fill with addy darts.
---
I killed it on my 2nd try with around 80 range 70 def black dhide top and bottom, ancient coif and glory ammy and barrows gloves.
---
Wc lvl?

Fuck that guy

Because you have got different settings, probably in RS, not runelite

I haven't made one personally, sorry. I just afk on my main and shared figures. I don't really enjoy multilogging. Definitely try something like a cannonball alt or house tablet alt first and see if you enjoy doing that. You'd need to play one in excess of like 30 hours / 2 weeks to profit on your bond cost, but they are super low requirements and the most afk things in game basically. If you enjoy alting constantly for a couple days, then start making your rune dragon alt. Only takes like 400+ hours I'd guesstimate.
---
Yeah I'm still under 16
---
Set small obtainable goals that you can achieve in a reasonable time frame. 
---
A long 50+ grind to 99 can seem endless and cause burnout. Especially if you only play a couple hours a day. Set goals based on how much you expect to play and are able to reasonably achieve in a session.
---
Also setting goals that build on each other. IE my current goal is to finish 93-99 crafting so that I can more efficiently do lava runes. This in turn allows me to finish up the elite diary's with RC requirements.
---
Nice bro
---
It read like a bad fanfic
---
I'd move back in with my mom if that happened, fuck me lmfao
---
Not the pickaxe really after maybe Steel (could be wrong) but level does. The higher your level is the less chance there is for the Stone to deplete. So dragon pickaxe is in theory better if you spec with it. Or at least you can be a little bit more afk
---
This is why i refuse to do zulrah if i have already burned through my daily regeneration from the western elite diary. Grats man!
---
She's too easy
---
For sure, definite pros and cons to each approach. Redwoods save you 5-10 hours from 90 to 99 but are click intensive and costs 6 mil, Wintertodt is a longer grind but is profitable and more afk.
---
looking for an afk moneymaker with an emphasis on afk - which is more afk, woodcutting or fishing?

Not everything has to be balanced in a videogame.. Especially not in runescape. You could make this post about a ton of items. And if you're planning on doing that, please do it for the seercull, that weapon looks dope.
---
We already get crystal armour and weapon seeds from the gauntlet. If anything, Zalcano's drop table is pretty nuts and could do with a tune down as it's good gp/hr in both uniques and regular loot. 
---
Realistically, it fits the current pinch the gauntlet it is and doesn't suffer any consequences for doing so. Presumably, the QA testers thought the Blade of Saeldor would be so good that it would be 100sM gp. But in reality, it's worse than even a rapier and for ironmen it is probably not even more worthwhile over a regular whip, if you care at all about your time and activities/hour, over just doing TOB for rapier and scythe.
---
I'm assuming, they're presently working on an overhaul of the shards and charges they provide across the crystal equipment and the rates at getting them per hour from various activities. But they shouldn't be universally the same across all the content. It wouldn't really make sense to get the same shards/hour from hard-mode gauntlet vs. the agility course. If you want 50+ shards/hour, do the harder content. If you want to do very easy content, like agility and mining, you should have your shards/hour reflect that minimal effort and be offered much lower rates at shards/hour.
---
I bought a second phone to take pictures of my first phone while I play RuneScape on it.
---
it's only after i started to get good at Vorkath that this attack became any sort of a threat...overconfidence, man

nice repost

Most common mid-tier money makers with low requirements are herb runs and birdhouse runs. For herb runs you'll want 38+ farming and you can start off with toadflax, then avantoe at 50, then ranarrs once you get high enough farming so that you average 7.5+ herbs per patch (around 80 farming in my experience)
---
Birdhouse runs require access to fossil island but are a fantastic way to passively level Hunter and take maybe 2 minutes per run
---
Blast furnace is also commonly recommended as you can turn a profit doing steel/mithril bars with relatively low requirements
---
its because alot of players understandably don't want to go back to that risk. They don't want to lose their items so it threatens them.  I get it, I do. So many pvmers are used to zero risk where as pkers never had the mechanics changed, its what caused the schism between pvm and pking, and the reason they get so mad when they die in the wilderness. It actually carries risk where as the rest of the game its just a minor inconvenience. 
---
I get why I get downvotes, but it doesnt matter because the integrity and longevity of OSRS depend on death mechanics being adressed.
---
I just like to skill and chat. I do the "afk" skills (ones that don't require much clicking) and just have conversations with people.
---
You don't need to be a hardcore player, you don't need to even do any combat at all, you can simply just be a skiller. It feels satisfying to get a good cash stack just by mining, woodcutting, smelting, fletching, even if there are better ways to make money and gain xp.
---
It's simple, it's relaxing, that's what I've always liked about it.
---
You ever get a tob item party rock?
---
S
---
Would you recommend to hold on to it and sell it later or do as what u stated?
---
Sounds like xp waste to me but ok, ty.
---
Yes you do. If you're currently on wave 1 or 2, you can not at all do the low/med gamble, and if you're on 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, you can not at all do the med gamble either.

I believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/57k9uv/the_slayer_shield_revised_mid_level_slayers/) was the original suggestion. It was similar to the helm in that it took a bunch of slayer items and merged it into one. There have been a few versions of the concept, but pretty much it could take the Anti-Dragon Shield for Dragon, Elemental Shield for Wyverns, Bug Lanturn for Harpie Swarms, and even other stuff like Slayer Gloves for Fever Spiders or the Bell for Molanisks and put them into one item. If we do get it, I'd expect it to end up more as low-level or mid-level so probably not appropriate for a Cave Horror boss.
---
GZ!
---
Chad as fuck I love it
---
Through the wilderness? Is it faster to do it that way?
---
TIL
---
Ancient Wyverns (the strongest ones)
---
Yeah, I see your point. The wizard guild did have a fantasy aestetic. But its something different more or less. Its more simple than high fantasy. I guess more of a mystical aesthetic, with the glowing lights and the falling star lanterns, its very simple and down to earth in a well magical sense.  
---
No areas that seek to capture this like Arcauss (or however you spell it) try to use grandeur and flashy colors to trick you into a sense of mysticism, when really it would be better off just making it like the wizards tower or yaneille, and even those areas had some creepy stuff!  like the restless ghost skeleton or the hand in the sand quest!
---
It was in the release blog. Said it was for "thematic reasons".
---
The fuk?
---
they were specifically given no right click interaction because it would get very annoying/youd be able to rag with them if they did. imagine going to the fishing spot but theres 18 peoples pets that also show up when you right click

Toggle scape though

I started doing barrows for money and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for how I can speed up my runs? [Here is my setup/levels](https://imgur.com/JQ8ii7K). Right now I'm putting all the money I make into training prayer so I can do the Morytania hard diaries. 
---
The order I do the brothers is Dharoks → Verac → Karil → Ahrim → Guthans → Torag, and when I make it to the crypts I get to 77% and then kill the brother, or kill the brother and get 88%. Is there anything I'm doing wrong that can speed my runs up a bit?
---
RoT is so irrelevant that after their inside man Jed was fired they  completely hide from wars and just sit at 2.2k revs.. RoT is actually broken and riddled with spies nowadays, so sad especially seeing what they once were. Completely broken lmfao.
---
how are they taking 0 damage
---
Still counts
---
Can you explain more how the death mechanics are broken?
---
Lmao just eat noob hahahahahaha
---
Go shotgun a beer like the rest of them
---
Can get ags g mauled from full hp with lucky rng. Always a risk of dying
---
What should I be aiming for on my Ironman? 89 range, 80 mage, 75/85/72 a/s/d, 79 slay. No real bossing experience in osrs. I know the question is a bit open-ended but suggestions are appreciated!
---
You want a really jank way of playing? Get your firemaking to 50, then go to Wintertodt _immediately_ until you max out firemaking. It's not expensive to start, and it nets you decent money.

Clans just waffle stomp everyone cause of sheer numbers. It’s like going against clans in rust it’s just unfun and 1 sided. At least in rust you can opt into solos only
---
Lol I always end up standing out side of said activity or boss.
---
Anything that takes any sort of time commitment I end up thinking of a billion things that I need to make sure I do b4 I go into said activity.
---
So many hours right outside of a boss lair or my Slayer task. Then I end up talking to people there and waste even more time
---
Congrats on getting IMO the sickest cape in game!!  🔥🔥🔥
---
bust a fat nut
---
Again I could be wrong. But I do remember the RuneLite devs saying that some configurations could be incompatible. Try joining the RuneLite discord server and posting in the support section with your problem, I’m sure they would help you out.
---
Artisan would be a buyable skill
---
I believe so yeah. Just avoid the clouds or run thru them and make sure you chugg antipoisons.
---
3 bank spaces, even. I don’t wanna have to go make steel plate legs any time I wanna be an ardy Knight.
---
At the very least, having 33 magic can save you 10k during the quest
---
I think it will, I believe last week they set some kind of record for bond sales which typically means there are tons of people playing right now. I used to play rs3 which has no where near the same population as old school and it still felt alive.
---
I'm not sure if jebrim has written a fully coherent statement but he has that 1 second margin figured out. I think it's just starting the course from a full stop, and not running towards the ladder, but there might be other parts.
---
You already got your answers for gear and such below, but one final note.
---
Don't get 88 percent, this means you're eligible for bolt racks, which are less profitable than any runes except mind runes. You generally want to get 86.2 or 86.4 potential by killing 2 skeletons, 1 bloodworm, or 4 bloodworms respectfully. Thes monsters spawn while opening doors, so they're convenient to kill for loot potential.
---
I did quite a bit of mine afking aggressive tasks so I could work/do things around the house. Was getting around 30k exp/h so looking at about 400 hours doing that, if you cannon as many tasks as you can whilst bursting/barraging nechs, dusts and smokes you'll easily reach 50k-60k exp/h pretty chill.
---
I had litrally used well over 5000 tokens, got 7 clues scrolls and was about to give up. But then I read this comment, spoke to oziach and guess what happens on my next kill? ... Got the dragon defender!  No joke. OZIACH IS GOD
---
And your email and password so we can try to do Jad ourselves. Then we’ll know for sure.
---
llǝʍ sɐ ɐılɐɹʇsnɐ uı ǝɹǝɥ pɐq ʎʇʇǝɹd s,ʇı
---
The first couple ticks the thing shows up don’t do  damage so you can react to them spawning.
---
So the PvP weapons were an additional option to the new armours, which will be very expensive. They're the big ticket items like tbows and scythes, whereas the PvP weapons will be more like the other drops
---
Now to recolor the set
---
You’re the gift that keeps on giving tell me more 😂😂😭
---
I do mean brews and super restores. Towards the end the monsters took a really long time to kill and I had to pray the whole time, so I burned through my restores. Blowpipe alleviates that problem, but it also adds a significant cost to your run with the zulrahs scales. Also if you do decide to go with RCB, use broad bolts over barbed.
---
I wouldn’t recommend using a simulator, the last Jad simulator that got popular ended up becoming a phishing attempt.
---
Nah cosmetic upgrade to black mask that makes it 4x bigger
---
How often does that sorta thing happen
---
appreciate the words bois, gl on your grinds. Be smarter than i was
---
The only thing you can really do aside from getting higher levels for blowpipe and trident are to get your mage up a level for occult for more damage. Kill all brothers and 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm is ideal. Everything else is good. I don't see a benefit to killing any particular order myself since you are going to be using pray the whole time anyways, ahrims maybe because of combat stat drain but the rest you'll pray through aside from verac which can hit you anyways.
---
Yeah i was aware of that first part, was around then.
---
But didnt know about that second part, thanks man.
---
It depends on how long you plan at sticking at barrows and what resources you have available to you, or how you plan to train.
---
Barrows does give some nice magic exp but there's a lot of faster and easier ways - but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to train magic just for it if you're just planning to just get a few more item drops there and move onto other things.
---
If you're going to be camping there for a significant amount of time, i'd definitely look at investing in training a little bit first. I just came back after a break so i'm not sure if splashing has been changed or not, but if you're on the lower budget side of things and you have a lot of spare time or time you can multi-task with, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
If you have a bit more money available to you, you could try doing some bursting to quickly speed through to 75. You'll need to spend longer doing barrows to recoup your costs, but I would personally say the boost from the trident would be worth it, if only for it makes the runs much faster and enjoyable. I haven't run the numbers, though.
---
Train how you enjoy, however.
---
https://i.imgur.com/72SyTZJ.png :( it came true for me
---
grats
---
I will hunt Kyatts till 99, thanks!
---
Personally I find them to be extremely annoying to kill compared to skeletal wyverns due to the annoying freeze mechanics. So I used the 500-point block to remove them from my list.
---
If I want an ancient wyvern shield I'll go get one later off-task =P
---
at least 10 years older than you, but i'm glad we like the same game man :)
---
Unfortunately, I got a few people's birthday coming up so I'm making other tiny cork decorative bottles for people atm. I got a mini [dark souls bonfire](https://imgur.com/a/ylKoFPq) here I'm making for someone else. I wasn't kidding when I said it in my post, I had already spend a week on the runes and it was already driving me nuts so I needed to move on to my friends' birthday bottles haha. I'm not sure if i'll make more runescape themed stuff but i'm always ready for new RS ideas.
---
I see you also have an alch bottle cast. I raise you with [my own](https://i.imgur.com/iNyIi7p.jpg).........[wahahahaha](https://i.imgur.com/p3xGVEq.jpg). Teleport theme bottles [like this](https://i.imgur.com/EHEKzTw.jpg) isn't a bad idea either! I wish you luck making these and selling them! I don't have time sadly and I knew the demand was high. It's your problem now! hehe

Death mechanics got changed days after GWD was added to OS, and then again about a month after that but the timer stayed slightly longer than the original.
---
Mom get the camera!!!!
---
Yup. One of my fav tasks tbh because i want pet and xpdrop is juicy af. Slayerhelm also gives that extra dps boost so i finish caves around 40minutes.
---
Never had anything like that happen. It could be a bug but most likely you made a mistake. Any chance you accidentally cancelled it? Or the bars went straight to you bank?
---
It should be. Did you make your account on an apple device using Game Center?
---
its 8-16 if u have ultracompost
---
No not really
---
Good job on 79 though, that's impressive and you're halfway to a fury!
---
Na the north sign is clearly covered.. I think I'll be taking the account.
---
Same

Magic training, it will give you access to alot of teleports, will also boost your magic defense, and is basicly the combat style you will be using for alot of the early quests :)

Dont think so but they're identical in appearance to steel legs anyway.

True, and who has time to reload a massive portable cannon?

Yeah, playing on normal difficulty with the right set of bosses means that you'll get hit very rarely. Especially if you've got a high defence level/rating. You could drop your hp to mitigate more of the I coming damage, but I never bothered.
---
Fun fact: Rs3 has this but as this dumb lil purple orb. Id much prefer this absolutely adorable bacon thing

Yes

So whenever your inventory filled up you banked?  Or did you leave alchs on the ground?

And what does that say about you? Getting triggered by a \*non-sensical rant? Maybe you're not so perfect after all. You have a lot to learn little guy. You've disgraced this subreddit with jargon and confusion. Know your bounds or you're likely to find someone stepping over your bounds, looking you straight in the eye.
---
For real. I *just* started farming Vorkath, like literally finished my 20th kill today. It's so nice to actually be able to do some rewarding content for once, which is an ability I *earned* by learning the mechanics, grinding out void and the stupid imbues, skilling to the point of being able to do ds2, paying for supplies/death tax, etc.
---
That's not to say the gauntlet shouldn't be more rewarding than it is now. It should be! But I hate this attitude of trying to pull up the ladder when vork and zulrah have been in the game for years now. Next thing you know barrows will be 'too profitable.'
---
Ah I see you have a 1 hunter pure as well, nice.
---
Now to finally do monkey madness one and stop being a pleb
---
but we knew lathas was evil already before SOTE
---
The big bomb has a distinct sound
---
And bossing wise u can do zulrah vorkath raids gwd etc but its alot more doable with 75 attack zerk then 60 but 75 isnt that great pk wise
---
Nope, this is it, have to get portal on first obstacle and start from the base of the ladder and now run to it and climb up right away, it’s pinned on his Twitter @fakejebrim
---
Ok
---
Wish there was a way to weed out these inaccurate reviews.
---
As you and other people have stated, on a normal account u do the best money maker u can and then the best xp per hour training method u can too for any skill. This is how u play efficiently however on ironman u dont think about money instead u think about items themselves.
---
I also thought about my main too when i started ironman, my main is around 700 total level and my ironman is now more than double that but thats not the point. When i thought of all the work i put on my main, i just had to remind myself that on my main it was all about grinding the best money maker only and that got me right back to iron.
---
I created an ironman to get BiS slot items because to me buying a generic piece of armor o a weapon ok the GE doesnt feel as good as getting it as an actual drop from the monster that drops it. Ironman basically forces you to do content in this game that u otherwise wouldnt do ever. In my opinion (in my opinion) why do i deserve to wear an armadyl chainskirt if ive never set foot on the armadyl section of gwd or never even killed kree arra?
---
If u are interested in starting an ironman i would recommend oziris ironman guide version 3 to get an initial direction and set of goals to get u stared.
---
I would also recommend u visit the ironscape reddit to see what other ironman are up and what its like (they upload their achievements there and questions, guides, etc).
---
That’s sooooo cool!
---
99m for me :/
---
Agrarian skies 1 is easily the best one btw.

and fits the character. Good enough for me

Are you going to be killing them for GP or sheer enjoyment?
---
Did you buy rs3 bonds?
---
Ohhh is it because it’s supposed to hide the comment chain? This makes so much more sense.
---
go watch parking meter has a series called "life as an endgame zerker" which is what it sounds like, he's 99 slayer and does lots of pvm and pking, few videos will give you an idea of what a zerker is like to play on.
---
my personal opinion is that zerkers are somewhat outdate when it comes to deep wild, these lvl 97-103 60 attack piety builds are tearin up the low-mid level bracket, you have piety and rigour and if you're level 97 you can harass pures in pvp/revs if that's your thing.
---
Youre strawmanning harder, good youre almost there
---
It would require doing quests which grant exp in skills that I'd prefer to keep lvl 1 for aesthetic purposes.
---
Rock climbing boots
---
I dont get it
---
Great concept
---
Interesting shield idea. The mask puts you in a rage obviously, so what if the shield (by magic rage power), DECREASED your defense by a significant amount (maybe 50%), but it also increased all offensive production by a significant amount (maybe 10-15%).
---
Q
---
Lol bro I'm maxed lol. Because afk prayer is ezcape. I didnt listen to anything because there was nothing to listen to...if your saying I *misread* what you said I didnt. Take your snarky shit elsewhere and if your worried about defensive stats at all against cave horrors I'd say your the one who needs to get good.
---
The only bright spot of pre-eoc/eoc was the God quests and bringing back Zaros. I would absolutely love if we bring in our own quest line of the Gods!
---
If I rock up to rock crabs and there’s one other person there, I don’t hit there crabs and only the ones I aggravate, why do they tell me to hop?
---
It happened twice yesterday and drives me crazy.
---
He doesn't seem mad at all.
---
Had the exact same thought 😂
---
then how would he farm GP to sell????????
---
DPS (damage per second) is more important than max hits. Il at work or I'd try to explain better but essentially it's a formula of attack speed vs max hits.
---
I like it, but I'm also a normie account. I want to buy my fashionscape, not work for it XD
---
Ironman btw
---
Should have been brought to us by John Lennon
---
That was my first idea, sadly they can't be alched
---
Mad bruh?
---
Holy fucking shit you are condescending. You even saw the comments, and still decided to post a stupid comment which you thought said the same thing, which it didn't. Your posts were always irrelevant. Get off your high horse and grow the fuck up.
---
Bwanar*
---
A lot were unhappy with that, but it was polled and passed so... Blame the community for that.
---
It’s kinda fixed on the higher tier monsters and bosses. You have to use a variety of weapons on them for best results.
---
Prayer is very low for this no? You would be heading to an altar every 2 kills maybe?
---
Did you use any of your melee stats at all? I’m a supreme noob. If I wanted an earlyish firecape to boost melee training, should I just boost range and prayer training first.
---
Can confirm. Am ironmon. Played Skyblock heavily.
---
I do this whenever im too lazy to get out of bed

Slowly working on the music cape. I hope I don't have to do 50 elite clues for the mimic soundtrack
---
Currently working on 83 construction to boost to 91 for occult altar, fairy ring, and ornate jewelry box to have a cool looking and efficient house. Currently level 77 and I already have a nexus and the achievement room. Very exciting! I’m also trying to flip more to replenish my bank because I’m doing benches.
---
The fail rate is high, but I don't think it is a problem. It is like how tough monsters deal more damage to you, but their drops make up for that. You don't pickpocket elves for exp, you do it for the loot. That said, the loot is pretty decent at the rate they drop the tele seeds and shards.
---
For alching
---
This hits closer to home more than I'd like it to.
---
It’s pretty wack that it wasn’t made with dfire protection
---
sigh...\*unzips\*
---
Somewhat lower than smouldering stones imo, maybe ~2m?
---
Bruh if you have 99 you shouldn't fail anything. The game said I am a MASTER at thieving but I can't steal shit from some elf commoner?
---
Mvp?
---
Time it took?

Please include these things

Of you ever plan on multi pking the zerk bracket is pretty dead while the pure scene is kinda healthy

Don't bother. Some people can't admit they're wrong even if their life depends on it. It actually impacts negatively on our daily lives even if we act like it online. Just a heads up to the other guy. I've been there.

untradeables make no sense. you turn event that is supposed to be fun to  activity  you have to do and on so many alt accounts as possible.

Also I am sure if question would be "add untradeable but you dont receive one" more people would probably vote no.

I got the zulrah pet and I stared at it confused for at least a solid 10 seconds thinking, “why didn’t this snakeling die? Is this a glitch?” And I almost died and lost the pet because my anti venom had run out and was out of food. Got to a POH and pool just in time to keep it lmao

You're not going to survive wearing green dragonhide. May as well wear nothing at all at that point. From the sounds of it you don't have the gp or levels to survive pkers, so essentially if you get caught you're fucked. Only option you have is logging out whenever you see a white dot.

Consider yourseld fucking lucky

in theory the exact opposite of skyblock. instead of no ground, theres no sky.
---
in practice yeah its pretty similar
---
It would be better without the solutions!!!
---
make her put the solutions inverted so there's no cheating

Very possible, but luckily jmods haven't done anything shady so far :))))

yeah I am gonna try something like that hopefully it works out
---
I’m a pest control girl myself.

I know they're not perverse for doing this, it's just nenligence.
---
But I want ppl to consider these kinds of updates of dead content are extremely perverse in nature and allow that kind of corruption.
---
Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutly.
---
there is a stoneblock 3 and skyfactory 4 I think... but I never really got into them... They make almost everything plant based so the middle-game is nothing but farming and at some point you just wait around for hoppers to do everything... I prefer the older gen personally. but to each their own.
---
The biggest problem with this is that people would know they would be discontinued and most likely start rising in value so people would just repeat the event on alts etc just to get more of said item, just look at the purple partyhat dupe in rsc.
---
What could be a better idea is over the 2 week period of said holiday event jagex say we are going to be releasing 1000 of X item which will be a tradeable discontinued item, these will be dropped by monsters or randomly rewarded through skilling. This way people couldn't farm them and the incentive would be if you play lots over that 2 weeks you might get one, the rarity of them would make them desirable and valuable without flooding the market and allowing people to stockpile them.
---
Not a whole lot, scimitar and rapiers has always been king.
---
Yeah I'm averaging 2m/hour as well. I know a lot of pvm is better money but damn, this is brainless asf to do, zero risk, supplies are p much a few monkfish. 20 monkfish will do you like 700k-1m of loot.

I remember this in 2007

Thanks! I love all the support. I have a busy day today so I'm not sure if J cant start then, but ill come back to here once I do!

I’m gonna day the n word
---
Honestly it gets boring when your next gear upgrade is always another 50m away or more unless there's something you actively enjoy doing regardless of any sense of progress/goals. I'd 100% keep going.
---
Those quests are currently still the same in rs3. Thats what i meant. Rs2 is rs3 now. Theres no difference.
---
Why is this so funny. I can't stop laughing
---
It actually hits harder against them. I routinely smack 60's feels so good.
---
Nope not permadeath unless you play hardcore Ironman, even then you just lose your status and become a regular ironman.  If you are PVPing and die you lose all your equipment.
---
It's only a suggestion. I should have added people that don't want the gauntlet taking away their hard earned and almost afk gp from Zalcano, as an option
---
I know that he's the prophet, but I didn't know that praying to him would be considered sinful, TIL

Its super chill to play with minimal attention if you want, so even if you're busy you can still have a go. Add me in game if you ever want help, IGN: Wazi

HAH YES.

---
Try doing druidic ritual to unlock herblore then one by one get all the member skills to like 20 one by one. That should get you in the swing of how they work. Quests are a good way to make you run around and get used to where stuff is.
---
I'm pretty close to maxing total on my Tank too :) You going to get 99 prayer?

Looks like the 69 gave u a d long 😉

False. There was one case of shady shit outside of Jed that I can't remember happening.

Its not that much of a strawman, ive seen people who think mining iron ore is good money actually comment on late game content
---
Nice.

Yeah, don't indulge in crazy, ever. And don't spread HIV.
---
While I appreciate the effort you put into this idea, there 're some huge flaws in the lore department. For example, xau tak can't be on geilinor because the edicts are still in place, xau tak would be far to powerful to be a boss aswell. There are other things aswell which are not congruent with the current lore. If you're curious which parts I can always offer some more critique. You can also look up elite dungeons on rs3, they're raid style dungeons connected to the xau tak story line, the shadow reef is similar to what you described.
---
Use a cannon and skip hellhounds..jeez man
---
Yes, that would be stating the obvious. But generally offering a service in 2019 that does not support case sensitive passwords nor passwords of substantial length is pretty laughable.
---
I haven't ever been hacked myself, but I also take every precaution I possibly can to avoid it. It's just annoying that I can't go the extra mile on my RS account, to feel safe.
---
With that said there have also been countless reports of users getting hacked where the hackers bypass authenticator and bank pins because they know the recovery questions of an account (the recovery question loophole I was referring to). They briefly mentioned this on the Q/A stream too, when they were talking account security, so it's without a doubt an issue Jagex has recognized themselves. Imo this is probably the biggest flaw in their security systems and needs to be addressed asap.
---
I hear you man, because of all those waves the pressure gets to you. Are you using fkeys to switch from inv to prayer? If not, please do because you get faster at flicking. There is also a jad flicker online to practice, it’s from RS3 but it helps learning the rhythm. Just remember, you’re not in a rush.
---
Best of luck to you friend.
---
I appreciate your time to reply..
---
Just don't try and make yourself look any better because you cannot hide the fact the insurance money got real world traded, that screenshot being solid proof. 
---
You are basically confirming that money buys everything in this cc, which is sad, but unfortunately very fucking true. People are woring their asses off in this cc, whilst not being noticed at all, while we have people like you not even running a single bone and being somekind of leader of this cc. 
---
We'd happily take our insurance back, but not by any of your accounts or the owners accounts we'd have to choose our own trader.
---
Hey why you selling my gf?
---
Especially not in-game ones.
---
Agree to disagree. I'd say they are about the same now since the change. Before I would have agreed with you.
---
Because they kinda suck
---
Tho they're better than aids
---
Fashionscape value. But not this cape, it's ugly-looking.
---
A better argument against Jad would be having to slog through the 62 prior waves. They're not hard, they're just brain dead boring.
---
Well it is a game. It’s basic and simple, but that doesn’t disqualify it

Can't remember the names but vids not good, youre not missing out on anything good

What they’ll usually do is say ‘bank sale’ and put up 22 items for like 25m and ask for 26m but one of them is the grail so they make 6m off that alone. It really is your fault if you’re knowingly trying to gain money by deceiving people. Just don’t trade anyone for items. Use the ge
---
Better economy, more player and of course more nostalgic. If you are playing for the way the game looks your should not be playing any version.
---
Started at 3 with my dad, now i'm 21 continuing his legacy, tbh the best memories of my life are from playing this game at your age, enjoy it!
---
Gang is accurate, im on toilet rn
---
Yeah, they had some Instagram page with lots of anticlimactic content. This is the only "capturing" one, hence why it became a deceptive meme tricking people into thinking there's more to find.
---
google osrs best in slot. The website is probably the first result, like your search query but with no spaces. You can input your combat stats there.
---
Hope you return though and happy scaping!

Same happened once to me, felt so mindfucked and just bought a new one

Could've just bought them.

Vanessa Phoenix and Lexxxus Adams are their names

Shitty gang shitty gang shitty gang Spent 3 Days in My Game Chair, Yeah I Gotta throw away my undawear

That's a dead method compared with modern raids which grants like 5m+ iirc
---
Remember not to let your gp that you've accumulated just sit in your bank. Flip with it to earn more. When I was f2p trying to get my first bond, I did high volume rune flipping. Simply buying for 4gp and selling for 5-7gp deending on how many i had. I really got a good deal/flip when someone (I assume who was rich and helping me out) bought all my runes for about double their price.
---
3 pets? But why
---
2 hours? casual. real players can invest 10-15 every day after work. Gotta manage your time better and never marry.

I've lost 25b staking in 15mins. It happens. Been cleaned over 1b like 20 times. I'm trying to quit atm. Spent alot of real life money buying gold. So it's gotten out of control. No matter what if you stay at the arena you'll get cleaned eventually. So if u win one stake leave and never come back. Becuz if u do come back you'll lose what you won and lose your bank chasing that one loss.
---
Useless content is not broken. This game history of updates hasn't followed an upgrade tree system for power creep, new stuf has replaced the old, so there's a lot of vestigial content. It's fine.
---
What you should focus instead is in asking jagex to avoid creating more vestigial item when they release new content.
---
But you're a greedy fuck that just want monies
---
How are runes actually used? Does anyone know? Does the character throw them in the air? Smash them together? I wanna know how theyre used to cast magic spells.

Sure does.

jagex has made statements about their game design choices for the future, and they said didn't want to over-saturate the game further with teleports like the example you just gave because of how it makes the game feel smaller
---
ah ok
---
The point was that bloods are not the best option for moneymaking with RC, says right there in my post. You're right that it's more efficient to to do Lavas then do some other moneymaker, but that wasn't my initial points and like I said, that wouldn't even be truly efficient.

With that untrimmed cooking cape, I love it

Thank you

No, but I can identify that your argument is fallacious. A teleport isn’t going to cause any problems in the game.

Because since the item cannot be sold on the GE, RuneLite uses it's high alch value for the loot tracker, so in OPs picture the shards are already worth 6000 x 188 or 1,128,000 of the total value

That’s legit how I beat Jad on my second try, was with a blowpipe and diamond bolts. I used the blowpipe for the waves, and just killed Jad and the healers with a rune crossbow with enchanted Diamond Bolts with 92 ranged. Really helps against his defense. I killed him way faster than with the blowpipe for sure, and I just remained calm and focused on my restores and switches, managed to just kill all but one healer or whatever, cant exactly remember their specifics, and then just went bad to fucking on Jad with my trusty RCB and he was done in about 10 more seconds. The blowpipe I actually managed to last longer but the bastard just wouldn’t die lol.

Are you trying to compare the inferno to zolcano?

I like being able to bring it inside, but the tele is a bit unecessary

try making a slayer helmet with it, maybe that will solve the problem

I've only got to jad once and I died to his first attack. I always lose focus while I'm grinding waves and let my prayer drop on the mages and die. But there's no way I'm doing it without a YouTube playlist on so...

 "Amount to be dropped: XX,000,000 (to be revealed)   expected length of drop party: 1-2 hours "

He was at 115 hp. Can she even hit that high?

Not when you have 1500 total

And at 115 hp

Skirts probably aren’t that graceful when leaping from buildings and flashing all the onlookers.

Fight Caves, you fight through 62 waves of enemies and then you fight the final boss (Jad) on wave 63, and is one of the first times you're introduced to swapping prayers depending on attack animations.  
---
  
---
The fight itself isn't that hard, the problem is you just spent the last hour getting to him and if you make a mistake in your prayer he can nearly 1 hit you (Max hit is 97), so there's a lot of pressure you put on yourself to not die, which usually is what causes you to die.

It's pure RNG. The only mistake you made was getting bolt racks. Provided you aren't a btw.

Damn I’m still searching for the head. One of these days it will come! It’s my favorite slayer helm
---
That’s funny. I got my girlfriend started on the game yesterday and that was one of the things that was pissing her off until I came around to help her
---
The argument was never "why should I NOT do this", idk where you got that idea
---
Yeah, just get a dfire shield.  It won't be very efficient kills, I would suggest either green drags or something else.  Blue dragons hit considerably harder and have decent defense.  Pray melee as well.

It’s from the old school Solomon’s general store. Can also buy cosmetics there to make high level weapons look super bizarre and not even in the colour scheme of the original game.

It doesn’t always hit 115 without mage pray, plus he teled in time... sooo no, he didn’t get chanced

Not sure how up to date it is, so many modpacks uses earlier versions of minecraft because of mod development.
---
If you've finished bosses you wouldn't want on your list, are you basically screwed to have shitty NMZ?
---
It's a dangerous path my friend. I quit for 10 years or so and have found myself sucked back into the game too. So much nostalgia but productivity irl has gone down quickly haha
---
To be fair, Song of the Elves was a huge quest. probably took a lot of development hours. I wouldn't be surprised if they only held the small quest when their isn't a huge quest to deal with, even after launch they need to update it with what's going on. I'm sure they'll work the small quests eventually.
---
This. It's pretty stupid to supposedly be outraged by it and then post it yourself for 1000s to see.
---
There’s already too many blowpipes, serps, fangs, etc in the game already. Over time, yes, they would increase in price, but who knows how long that would take? For your “vision” to work, all pvm boss drops would have to be rejuvenated in order to balance each other out, which to me, seems unfeasible in the short term. People will grind something regardless of its fun, and will only go for whatever is highest gp/hr in comparison to ease of content. Thus, nerfing their loots would all but cause a shift in content to the next best grindable money maker, (with less gp/hr) leading to a larger discrepancy in player wealth. In laymen’s terms.. Larger shift in wealth gap = bad

ORANGE MAN BAD :DDDDDDDDDDDD
---
To keep an untrimmed skillcape you should still be able to drop it and tellegrab it after you get your second (or third, forth... if you still have an untrimmed cape) 99.
---
seems like you arnt hoping worlds, have you tried it before? how did it go? i have rex pet and still kill all 3, but when i get my 2nd ill just camp one, hop between slayer and normal (if tasked) and hop worlds. was wondering how annoying it is with taken worlds and kills/h
---
Thats not the point though. I would of been able to grab every item had I somehow died, but my connection was out for to long. My point is if youre gonna give a whole hour due to disconnects then why not do what someone else in the replies mentioned and use rs3s death system. Its a gold sink, you buy back and items have different % of tax on them due to how expensive they are i assume.
---
Can't imagine, both parts they're used for happens at a fixed rate
---
It's exactly as fast just more expensive
---
“Would need game engine rework”
---
YES! I used to love hanging out under the bar in world 33 as a kid! Sometimes I still stop by there but there's never anyone hanging out :(
---
And then your following action, regardless of weapon type, is delayed to the speed of the 2h. This is how the game has handled concurrent attacks since 2003; it was more broken in runescape classic because every weapon in the game shared the same attack speed. You can call it whatever you want, but if it was considered "cheating" by literally anybody, it would have been addressed at some point in the past sixteen years lol.
---
Just get the bar of soap from taverly and give it a wash. Ez
---
I tried it in the past, and it trimmed while it was on the floor.
---
Have you heard of Mars?
---
It doesn’t need additional rewards, it drops the bis slash weapon in the game, and 50-100k every other time. Save new items for new content

No to tele. Too close to a deposit box.

because true old school RuneScape the items appear  instantly, y'all want easy escape

I know, even a couple years ago, when 07 scape came out i checked it out but no one was there, lets get it popping again

You need to drop it in a F2P world. I just got 99 farming a few weeks back and did this to keep my fletching cape untrimmed, it still works
---
Jaa zie af en toe ook wel nederlanders voorbij komen maar lijkt me wel

Tof als er gewoon een world is waar bijna alleen maar Nederlanders inzitten.

Woke up to another denied appeal. This is pretty shitty man. I've given all the personal information that fits, all the info I can remember. This is a terrible way for my rs career to end man. I feel like they should be able to see in the logs that I've been playing from the same place forever. There is no way it's a stolen account. I've given locations, my most accurate creation date, it was 18 years ago I mean come on. I feel like my account is being held ransom and there is nothing more I can do. If a jmod could actually talk to me or look into it, other than just filling out appeal after appeal with the same info that I have access to, then nothing is gonna happen.
---
Oh gotcha so you rifled through my post history.   
---
A) That post still wasn't a question  
---
B) Get a fucking life. Like you're not even trying to have a conversation, you're just being the cringiest type of edgy and combative.
---
Haha
---
Sounds like A Friend
---
True. I apologize for my stubborness. And I can see now it’s not cheating. As it compensates on the next attack speed of 2h. Still feels a little cheesy but I’ll get over it. Minmaxing nowadays cannt go without cheesing, so is it called cheesing? I guess not. Anyway thanks for your information and effort, you have a good weekend now!

It’s a video game. You making this post just proves you have paper thin skin.
---
Yeah fuck that dude bro it’s embarrassing at the end of the day if you think about it he can’t be having much fun if that’s his approach to randomer in the game, in my eyes that’s a win for you my dude he can carry on playing a very sad game while we’re all getting do gains and achieving accomplishments
---
honestly if this is your view of the game you would be happier just moving on with your life. runescape isn't for you.
---
I don't think there is a cc anymore. They changed the mechanics and now NPCs do the work.
---
I love how the only place soap exists in RS is one hippie dude's basket
---
Dungeoneering is more boring than osrs runecrafting. Ways worse is that it gives equipment that is definitely needed for mid level content
---
It's really not, you just are more likely to remember each time it happens
---
No sir you will get dropped if you mess up
---
Turn private to friends only and use the private instance, comfy as shit task
---
The context here is important though. When we're talking about mobile games the audience is going to trend pretty young, so the age in this case would be relevant.
---
ZMI training to 77 then bloods to 99.
---
It's slow, but easy to afk and bloods give you ok money.
---
They want to force you out,duh
---
But with the time it takes to trade some of those runners, you're probably better off running the bones yourself anyway. You'd have to do trades in like 6 seconds or something like that to make up for the trip + house loading time.

---
the thing that made scams happen was the fact that I was 10 years old and thought trimming armor was believable do to me being only in f2p. To do Raids and fall for a scam like this, and be over 18 you are a dumb ass.
---
The quests though. Tick eating and all that shit.
---
If only it were true
---
&gt; Fill -&gt; Venerate -&gt; chip -&gt; fill -&gt; venerate -&gt; craft -&gt; chip -&gt;craft

literally everyone does it this way.
---
if you would do this the other way would you doing the run to the alter twice as often. its a way more than a "little" faster, its not even fucking close.
---
You probably messed it up. I just got 99 range a few days ago and dropping + telegrabbing worked to keep my HP cape untrimmed.
---
Also, you don't have to do it in a F2P world or even a different world.
---
Bro, who cares? Why is everyone so god damn sensitive now, it's some random nerd online that you'll never see again. How is everyone such a pussy
---
diamonds are getting merched hard irl
---
You can’t have a soft heart playing this game bro. People are savage.
---
I tried doing gemstones to help my crafting grind, but it ended up being really slow crafting xp (as the mining took a while).  You might need a glory to make it worth it.
---
Is it not a reference?
---
9 rc*
---
You don't have to go to a F2P world. But in the situation they were describing, you would hop to a F2P world, drop the cape, hop back to a P2P world and get 99 farming, then hop back to F2P and grab the cape.
---
But again, you don't have have to go to a F2P world. Dropping and telegrabbing works just fine.
---
get a quest cape
---
well it worked, i couldn't bother because they kill them so much faster than me and wouldn't leave. I'm pretty sure they were friends because they came at the exact same time. This happens to me multiple times per hour. I think it might be because i took the 4 spawn spot maybe?
---
I think it's a coincidence
---
You too, thanks :)
---
Around 5rc lvls, 14 fish and 11 mining and 4 smithing.  I afkd a lot of it too
---
I just want more in morytania lol
---
Sucks about the scam but like your username 😜
---
Man this guy is a prick, agreed, but if that's all it took for you to quit then turn  your public off and set friends to private. How I play and only put public on when needed. 
---
No I'm not siding with that guy even a little, but it also shouldn't even bother you let alone make you quit. It's the internet and every game will have people like him in it, just remember it's only a game and who cares what a faceless stranger on the internet says. Everyone plays differently and there's no one right or wrong way, you do you.
---
It’s a repost

Noobs calling each other noobs? Who else but  **C  H  Y  E  A  H  B  R  A  H**

I don’t think ‘Nex’ herself should be the final boss. I think a different Zarosian general would be more fitting. Leave Nex in the frozen door until the time comes that the OSRS engine can handle her pre EoC mechanics.
---
As for the rewards. I think 3 entire new sets of bis Armour from a single raid is a bit much. They did this with raids 1 when it was first released with 15 new uniques. It’s too much imo and could be spread out towards future bosses/content. 
---
Maybe a mage or range tank version of justiciar?
---
FYI if youre not a pure, you don't actually need to kill the healers. Just tag them and they won't do shit

---
In that case I should change the title but I don't know how xd
---
Idk why they even made that weapon lol
---
do you realize your comment is also toxic lol.
---
It really depends on what you plan to do. Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the construction cape has a tp that's the closest to a bank in game and if that's worth it I'd say go ahead
---
Bro wtf
---
Not like they're changing graphically. They'll still be just as iconic, nobody pays attention to the icon.
---
Of course the runescape kid is wearing a sweatshirt
---
I literally should be dead after that, I don't even wanna know the odds... probably less than 5% chance to live.
---
For reference, varrock armour 3 also works with mining tephra
---
Shoutouts to SimpleFlips
---
Update, second kill with a mouse got the kill, having my full switch on gear and prayer before he even pops back up into his next form is a life changer. Now I just have to get consistent with it.
---
Or maybe because we're playing an **old school** version of Runescape and graphics shouldn't be updated because of ["why not?"](https://twitter.com/JagexWest/status/1154755290526601216). The nostalgic graphics are a huge part of the charm and identity of the game and we should resist these incremental "why not" graphic changes. If you want a pretty, "looks great" MMO there are plenty of those out there.

---
odds were so against him there, he should've flopped
---
Yeah i get that and i'm sure others did that too. I'm just one of the guys who was really hype when they said osrs would never have a GE, or claws, and swore up down and backwards they'd never happen. Then they happened anyway. I just miss when herblore and crafting were profitable, smithing didn't feel fuckin useless, merching actually took effort. Ge has always been one of my most hated updates because it kills off multiple skills just by existing. It completely baffles me every time a high level potion or item sells for less than the cost to make it because xp is valued more than actually having the item.
---
Does he use that glory to teleport to Edgeville?!
---
I'd change all but the D-boots, TBH. the fremmy boots look really good being changed.
---
No but I bet you were the one saying «  pause » when about to be touched by the one with tag

Quest cape, had it then lost it when I stopped playing, have like 5 quests all simple besides the new troll one and the elf one

nah

Pk clans are kinda of armies at peak times. They got like 50 guys waiting with burning ammies
---
I feel so bad for the mods after reading that cesspool of twitter comments. How much of a low life can you be getting upset at changing the angle of boots in your inventory
---
What's your point? I'm not trying to fuck any of these people.
---
To be fair, the mage doesn’t give you Runes until you finish the dialogue, click on the spell book, then talk to the mage again... maybe he missed that and the mage didn’t give him runes so he couldn’t cast the spell.

Nobody covered this on YouTube. I posted it 5 months ago on my dead YouTube channel. I thought i'd just share it here and hopefully make it on the hot section of this subreddit. Either way, I enjoyed making this short guide and tried it to make it entertaining for you people to watch so it's not so ResidentSleeper.

Ok, thanks. I decided to go with your WDR suggestion since they had workshop today. I tried my best at learning it, but managed to die twice at Olm. Got the kc at least :)

I'd argue it's more of a "fix" to make everything consistent, but to each their own. It's things like this that make me glad we have a poll system in osrs.

Base 80 non-combats on my pure. 3 skills away atm, but one of them is 54 runecrafting... gonna have to set aside a week somewhere and just grind it out I guess.   
---
Should finish maxing my main but I burn out a lot quicker on that account for some reason. :\
---
That could be, I suppose.
---
Would it be something viable to attempt imbuing another material other than rune essence, if our player could somehow convince the magic to hold?
---
All you do is read through dialogue and follow his exact instructions, how hard is it to understand what to do when the npc tells you exactly what to do... in fact if you missed it the first time you can go back and talk to the npc again and he’ll tell you exactly what to do again... who needs to be handheld to do a simple task?

yew risked it, but........did you get the biscuit?

I recommend using the Slayer staff it auto casts crumble undead, always remember to preset that spell before every trip. I just equip the staff and that undoes my agro to vork

Why only 1/3? Pretty sure it's close to exactly 1/2 the cost assuming you don't die (which if maxed is unlikely)

But I can see that if you have a butler it could make it faster

I like it. It's different than what I'm used to, but it makes it similar to prims, which is an icon I also like. Not sure what you meant by ridiculously stupid
---
Not really, I get MVP 1/3 of the time these days and it barely increases my drops most of the time. Sometimes I get a 400k drop (Onyx bolts) on a regular roll. Sometimes I get two drops totaling under 100k for an MVP kill. This means profit tends to be steady around 2M/hr even if you don't get MVP.

Inventory icons are just as iconic as the actual model, and I still think you're overstating how bad the old model is. It's not great but it's by no means bad.
---
If it's like the Jad task it does not affect your streak.
---
It's going to skyrocket if the dmg stack was implemented.
---
No, that's not the issue at all. I've had 1-4 clients open in the past and each had an auth that it would remember every time I logged in. For whatever reason I started having this problem a few months back where it wouldn't remember the auth. I'm having the same problem as the OP and it's super fen annoying. I've tried taking the auth off and putting it back on but that didn't work either. Every time I look for an answer no one knows why or pushes it off on each other. RuneLite says it's not them. Runescape says it's not them. It's really annoying.

Lmao I know. I'm not a brainlet. Giant seaweed is the best way to get the pet and it's incredibly easy to add to a run that you can do far more frequently than trees.

I'm not saying be happy about it. And I didn't really explain this well I guess but I want saying to just pretend it isn't happening and move on.

Yes, it is a shitty part of the community, and yes it wasn't the way it is. Anything we can do to help the community get less... Shitty, and have people actually act like adults is welcomele.
---
But it's still not equal to physical assault. Like yeah they both suck, and in an incredible simplified sense it's similar, but theres a HUGE difference between ignoring someone being physically assaulted and ignoring someone being made fun of online.

And if YOU can't understand that, then you need a reality check, my dude.
---
Haven't done that lmao

How nostalgically obsessed were you to execute this move?
---
no thats u
---
I had to learn to recognise bandos boots from their icon, the inventory icon is bizarre
---
Not needed. The official response by West when asked why should the change be made was "why not?". That says all you need to know, really.
---
Make sure boots added in the future have the leather boots angle, but there's absolutely no need to retroactively change sprites that have been in the game for several years.

TBH I haven't checked whether the other methods (keys, etc) are better at that point.

Just ignore anyone with an anime or rs related avatar and you're good.

you know they are game devs for a reason. Their literal job is to implement changes some good some bad, but if you don't let them do their job then you're moronic. It's not like they made a perfect game in 2007 there's always room for improvement.

OP, if you don’t mind, is this in YXE? I think I recgonize the venue.
---
Genuinely loved this, don't stop with the history lessons when they're relevant they were great haha - something different than the other series. Looking forward to the next one!
---
I don't remember what game/anime it is but enemies/villains were larger or smaller depending on their power level (maybe dark souls is what I'm thinking of) so to me hes not that big irl, his size is a reflection of his power (huge, being the general of bandos' army)

Best of luck ❤️

Or nerves. It's easy to panic on if you're not used to it. Go ahead and do it that way. I was just letting people know who may actually care that there's an easier way.
---
As I said, I don't have a problem with saying that OSRS graphics should stay consistent aesthetically.
---
My issue is with people who are bringing RS3 into this. There's no reason to. Talking about RS3 brings in a lot of baggage that isn't relevant to graphical updates. The problem with RS3 wasn't the graphics; it was the microtransactions, the overhaul of the combat system, and the Jmods' failure to communicate with the playerbase. If Jagex decided to force in the boot icons without a poll, it would be reasonable to be concerned. But as it is, this is a Jmod asking for opinions on a possible change. There's no need to be alarmist.
---
My next weakness...
---
A complete joke? There's still only 35k total corrupted gauntlet completions, and it's been several days since the update. It's definitely still very difficult. There've been almost 10x as many normal Gauntlets completed.
---
Why not just change the leather boots?
---
Same, and also for the Black Knight titan. 
---
Except it was adamant, cause I'm cheap af.
---
My moms a virgin
---
Dragon Boots are the only ones I want to stay the same
---
Depends on if you're a MVP or not 😜
---
Unpopular Opinion: The only reason we were made to care about blood diamonds was because the industry was concerned with cheap diamonds flooding the market. They then made a media campaign, lobbied African governments, and then released "Blood Diamond" leading everyone in First-World countries to associate cheap diamonds with dead African slaves. Now the diamond industry, through agency-capture, owns the regulatory testing groups and those that certify a diamond is not conflict related. Now, all because of their manufactured media outrage, they can inflate prices while keeping many "unconfirmed" diamonds out of the marketplace.

Not sure but I think he drops ourg bones in rs3,

Nieve in smash pls
---
Avoiding damage is pretty easy if your just doing it in a group of 5ish (which is ideal).
---
Salty.
---
I guess that's because I've never seen someone so adamant about sticking to a negative perspective.
---
I prefer the old design of the dragon boots. I'm honestly surprised so many people are in favour of changing such an iconic inventory icon because it "looks better". Old school simple graphics are one of the things that gives OSRS it's unique and nostalgic feeling. 
---
And no, I'm not agains improvements/changes, but I am against changes to iconic/nostalgic items. I don't really mind changes to the Fremennik boots.
---
Nice try Illuminati I'll crack your code
---
What the hell is that thing between nature and soul rune?

Yeah Bro it's a video game. Can't base irl decisions off a game
---
Good job, man. This will help out a ton of people.

Do you not need to be MVP anymore to get the pet? Gz on the pet.
---
I think we should just be abke to wear it in gauntlet without a bonus.
---
No cape looks gross imo
---
That prolly would've been useful for me haha. I got it down from the timing. If he hadn't stomped yet I knew he'd be lifting up for mage
---
Just right click him and travel lol ?
---
I don't really like that argument because 6 hour nmz also attracted a ton of players. And people used the same argument of only having a few hours a day to play, so why would they spend it doing the boring grind when they can skip directly to the bossing stage? When you make things super easy more people will always enjoy it but it doesn't make it good for the game. I know it's just my opinion but the "convenience" took a lot out of what made it a great game with a huge world imo. Everyone nowadays is all about efficiency instead of just enjoying playing. (yes ik people can have fun being efficient but there's a reason tons of people post about how they wish they could start over with no knowledge of the game).
---
I think ironman is a cool concept that i'd never enjoy. The trading aspect is what i miss most. I hate gathering everything myself and training skills i don't like. But i loved that other players could also make money off that by selling items needed for quests, or kits for whole quests. I liked that players could have an identity as "one of the herb sellers" because he'd sit at vwest makin potions all day, so you knew who to sell your unids to and who had potions ready or same with crafting/fletching. It was also the greatest feelings when you got a PM out of the blue like "hey man! You've got 99 mage that's sick!, could i pay you quick to enchant my fury?" The game just felt much more like an adventure with an actual sense of community and ironman doesn't really add that back for me. I would absolutely love a single world with no ge. Accounts made there can only log in there and vice versa
---
Looks 10x better.
---
I don't get what the big deal is in changing the angle of the fucking boots lmao. It isn't going to change how they look when worn. It's a god damn inventory picture 😂
---
I like the change.  Can the dragon boots have the left spike toned down? It is like twice the size of the right boot.
---
He means the current angle for them is ridiculously stupid
---
Why dont you pull some more facts out of your ass?
---
Today I hit my 16k'th lesser demon kill. Still no champion scroll.
---
Still better loot that our average Tob run

Wear good tank armor + a good tank shield (preferably DFS or BSS, but a D Sq will work in a pinch).

It's actually a positive perspective, if you're not a man child that gets his feelings hurt incredibly easily.

Diminishing the hardships that real victims go through by referring to this guy as a victim is a far bigger problem than some dude telling someone they suck at a video game.

I have 90 as well. My plan is for it to be one of my last 99s. Law and dust runes are super cheap and I don’t mind. Unless you have an urgent need to get it I wouldn’t do it just yet. Save it when you plan to max.
---
maybe he doesn't have the prayer level for it.

as a consumer this isnt necessarily something i am, or should be concerned with. i understand its the reality of the situation, and not the devs faults. but its still jagex's fault and a poor excuse to the customer.
---
Isnt there some sort of man made diamond now that are exactly the same as naturally occuring but are higher grades and cheaper to produce?
---
Not that great IMO. Sold mine last night, mostly due to the price crashing.

Brining osrs back in, that makes complete sense considering you can break opals when cutting them in this game

Because she got enjoyment from it I assume

This is a hard lesson in get rich quick schemes. Everyone thinks they are smarter than the scammer. Pro tip, you aren't. No one is immune no matter how long you have played or how much you know.

I myself would be interested in a new skill and I am under the belief that they could potentially make a new skill that would work well.
---
However, those people saying we need a new skill are a little goofy. I don't think we NEED a new skill. The game isn't going to die if they don't add one or anything like that.

Every time this meme pops up i always ask myself 'i wonder how many monkeys were/are being spanked as a result' the answer is at least 1.

Players who log in after an item has been dropped wont be able to see it. Same as if someone drops a load of items at the ge and you hop to that world after he drops, you wont see them.
---
Just load another client up and trade yourself
---
Shut the fuck up
---
ah yeah free nats
---
You could multi-log and trade items to yourself..there is no reason to drop trade any more. I believe the alt account (the account you are drop trading to) has to be logged in at the time the item is dropped from your main account in order to see them be dropped. At least from my experience this is true, Not 100% sure.
---
What if you get a 700 gp drop (like gargs do) that wont change your cash stack if you are over 100k and dont go over a new thousand if that makes sense
---
My point is that suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodwork claiming that the pixel art on the dragon boots inventory icon is something that is cherished and beloved, when realistically when it was released everyone said how stupid it looked (and still does lets be honest.) If anything the icon we have now looks objectively less "oldschool" than the proposed one if we compare it with every other old boot icon in the game, along with all of the other boots they have created recently like the diary ones.
---
I don't really care either way personally since it's just an inventory icon and I rarely need to even use d boots but I imagine they want to change them because they look out of place compared to the rest of the boots in game.
---
Looks cool!
---
If you enjoy making pixel art you should look into the tool Acesprite. It's super easy and fun to get into but I also the fun feeling of doing it Minecraft

---
I think Jagex are way behind the curve when it comes to handing out mutes to people.
---
Almost any other game with a chat will ban/mute you if you're running around telling people to kill themselves or calling them autistic/niggers. For whatever reason, Jagex don't seem to mute people anymore so people keep doing it. Maybe we need more pmods or maybe Jagex need to look at "seriously offensive" reports more often otherwise shit isn't going to change.

I want black graceful locked behind an obnoxious requirement... like a quest with horrible prereqs.

---
&gt; My point is that suddenly everyone is coming out of the woodwork claiming that the pixel art on the dragon boots inventory icon is something that is cherished and beloved
---
because they're changing it...
---
bro ngl, you just blow in from stupid town?
---
26 m fish exp?
---
I don't think graphics has anything to do with this potential change. All it is is a different angle for the icon that is consistent with MOST other boots in the game, and having consistency for all boots seems like a reasonable proposal.
---
Tell that to my body pillow uwu
---
Don’t even understand why the guy asked you that...obviously you were going to censor his name and the website
---
In a much more subtle way, the triangle is still present elsewhere.  As someone who always plays a caster in D&amp;D, a ranger who wants to aim at me is the biggest problem.

Use the proper wikis quick guide. They are short and to the point, and make even the longest quests seem a hell of a lot less daunting.

Okay, but there is absolutely no reason to change the aethestic and classic look of this game because new players think it needs to be changed.

sf4 is a really "reduction" from the formula making it a lot easier with bonsai trees though.

The idea of (modded) skyblock is always to "automate everything", from mob grinders to getting ores etc; sf4 has created a very straight forward way to automate everything - lots and lots of bonsai trees. Making it less of a difficult path and more a quick playthrough.

I mean yeah what he said was toxic but you're gonna come across a lot worse, it's an online game. There will be toxic people in every community.

If you deposit them in the bank, and scroll up and down, the model becomes animated for a short time.

Yeah sorry, autocorrect messed me up. I know the gp/hr is lowballed but it consistently stayed between 1.5-1.9m/hr on the wiki until recently where it’s continually been dropping. But the other reasons definitely make sense as to why it dropped so low.
---
But having the marks to buy a second set of graceful is still nice. Presumably if it's like the blue graceful you'll still need marks to get the set to color.

The new icons match much more closely with what they look like when worn than the old ones. Surely you remember and associate nostalgic feelings towards what they look like on your feet more than what they look like say in your inventory?

I read that entire comment chain. Dude, you're an idiot. 
---
How can you compare what happened to OP, and his decision to QUIT, to battery? And I assume by assault you mean a physical altercation.
---
I really want an explanation to that. Don't give me some straw man shit. Don't change the subject. Just give me a simple explanation as to how you think the two scenarios are even in the same ball park. Like, how is being violently beaten comparable to being told your RuneScape account sucks? How could you possible categorize those scenarios together? 
---
"Oh, being beaten and being made fun of RuneScape are equally as savage. You just need to see it from the point of view of the person being made fun of. They could be really, really upset." And don't give me some bullshit answer like that.

my dad is in his 60s and has played runescape on and off since 2008 with me. he has 8 99s, including slayer, is 126 combat, but his hands are just too slow to switch prayers and gear at demonic gorillas/zulrah and other mechanic heavy bosses. i get that its cool for others but it sucks to know hell probably never get to do tge theatre of blood

Why say stupid shit like this when the proof is literally in the picture

Combine all previous sets

Not in one myself, but I know most casual clans post on the official RS forums. I'd check there to start!

Bro it's easy all you have to do is hang around Italy rock and depending on the spawns which switch constantly and at some points seemingly randomly, kite around it and tank depending on priority of what you're being attacked by, then once Jad spawns, bait him into a corner and stand on the correct tile such that one of the healers can't reach him and tag the others

Jagex says alot of things that make it clearly apparent they don't play their own game. Zalcano you're lucky to get 50 shards p/h which is currently the optimal method to get shards followed by gauntlet at a rate of 35-45 p/h.
---
Considering how minimal of an upgrade the blade is over a tent whip which is so much easier to obtain and maintain the blade is already dead content. For a weapon that is literally locked behind a 4 hr + grandmaster quest plus quite lengthy pre-requisite quests it is extremely underwhelming strictly due to the tediousness of its upkeep. Personally i would like to see a permanent charge option added where you can sink something like 1-5k shards into it for a permanent charge and making it untradeable, in order to trade it again you would lose all those shards. In its current state it makes no sense to use it anywhere.

This is true but i see alot of solos and duos pking at the altar and i personally would run if i saw a group of 4 or 5 and i was solo or duoing. Just my 2 cents. A protection CC would actually be a cool thing to see.
---
Correct. There aren't really any quest reqs outside of having Dragon Slayer started. You don't really have to have 1 atk/str/mag either, I just did it for fun. How you get the 32 qps for DS is entirely up to you.

Are u calling all ladies demons? Rude

Cool thanks a lot

This sub is rapidly becoming /r/crabpics
---
Well yes, but actually no you absolute mongoloid
---
it's like 40k every 3 hours if you do palm trees, you'd literally be better off doing whiteberry bushes
---
well at lest you can sell it for another 2 weeks x 3 membership and go for it again. feelsbadtho.

He's the tree at the north of the clearing, try chopping it down
---
Might take a look man! Decent exp at mid levels then looking at that. I use rl as well (who dont these days?)  I actually got the tele book by myself without runlite or help and it took me like 3 fucking days. What a moron hahaha
---
Sounds good, its been a while. Probably messed it up, or I just forgot to do it again with subsequent 99s and thought it initially didn't work.
---
Why is there a 3 day countdown? Do people really wait that long at the venue or am I crazy?
---
Thanks for the quick response but there is no tree to chop, it's a fixed location right?
---
When one gets a strike at bowling

Best spell to use at 75 mags for zulruh?
---
Shoot me a message if you have any questions about the kill, set up, etc. I did around 1k kills this way and developed a solid method.
---
Yea it's like a normal tree dude, it doesn't show anything special until you try to cut it
---
Change everything but dragon boots. They look bad, but, you know, nostalgia.
---
there are 3 stops where big stuff will be dropped, as stated in the video
---
Thank you for explaining that, I didn’t even look at the name. My bad, want me to delete it?
---
Only complaint I have about the new icon is the holes are just black, the leather boots have shading but its not just a black hole
---
I love it.
---
didn't know about that sub, thanks
---
Since the one that actually created the account is the only owner of the account yup they can always recover it. Aka never buy accounts not only because it is against the rules but because the account is never actually yours. You are just renting it until the owner decides to recover it back
---
Nah man, I bought these on Etsy.

A literal Barrel Chested Cannon.
---
A Cannon strapped to your characters chest takes the chest slot, can fire every 20-30s during combat, does the max hit of a cannonball and in multi-combat pieres through enemies to hit up to 3 mobs with diminishing damage.
---
Your character shouts "Yarrr!" everytime it fires.
---
Wearing an eyepatch item at the same time increases the firing time to every 10-15s.
---
Seems like a good and logical idea!
---
Delet
---
Haha, correct! It was for my brother's 21st 😄
---
nice man, i was very surprised to see this, goodluck on the grind!
---
Absolutely brilliant
---
I don't, sorry!
---
finished cerb in 3 tasks :D
---
Am I blind?
---
watched a few movies and with my friend on discord it wasn't too bad, didn't do it in one go i did 2-3 hours then played a different game or took a break then finished it off after
---
now that's really going out of the box LOL!
---
no thats moltres
---
i don't really like it.
---
I think a Partnership would be a great opportunity to add Black graceful!
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome! you got my vote. Im almost done with my attempt of [Zuk](https://i.imgur.com/aDx2gil.png). I messed up on some places, don't know where, but I don't want to start over so I just keep going. Your building speed is so fast, have to watch it on 0.25x speed.
---
Truest things ive ever seen on reddit
---
These are awesome! How are they made?
---
O.O
---
On my character, yes. In my inventory, no.
---
Weebs and koreaboos hate this
---
Well sure, I'd like to hear it.
---
He can’t. He’s a BTW
---
Real question is: why it needs to be changed?
---
selling it in an alt is always an option
