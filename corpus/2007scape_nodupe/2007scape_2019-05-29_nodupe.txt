What do you want out of this? For the max level damage rate to be lowered or for hardcore iron pures to no longer be able to get through wintertodt? Because I dont see them lowering it without trivializing the already trivial game for high level players. And if they make it flat for everyone your taking a really great early game money maker for irons away and will only push it closer to dead content I feel. Without completely overhauling the point system, which is in my opinion a waste of developer time how else could this be resolved?
---

---
Furthermore whether at 10hp or 99hp wines can pretty easily be used to do wintertodt and they're extremely cost efficient.

Redundancy, conjunctions, lack of content, overall sloppiness due to lack of proofreading

---

Where is your proof?

Yea I wasn't sure how many you'd typically get since ik wintertodt is a fairly popular activity for irons, but i've never done it past 70 myself
---
Being banned in the crossfire of rwt should not result in the permanent ban he received. Buying the cape was a mistake in general but the punishment he received isn't totally justified
---
The point is why are you here other than to troll?
---
Your allowed to not like the game, but your on the subreddit for said game shitting of the subject of the subreddit. You know what you're doing.
---
 
---
You are purposely trying to piss people off for a reaction 
---
This is called trolling...
---
There's no reason for you to be here if you hate the game so much, leave.
---
Side note: also sorry to burst your reality bubble, but all games are made to waste time... There's not a single video game that's "productive"
---
That's really good man, dagger is ultr rare!

Are you seriously trying to argue that? Do you think trying to be a smart ass is going to get you anywhere? Do you think Jagex is going to go, ‚Äúoh, damn he got us there.‚Äù
---
Jagex has stated multiple times buying the inferno cape is against the rules and will result in a permanent ban. Simple as that.
---
Haven't felt brave enough to tackle that yet but want to make my first attempt sometime soon.
---
Listen, you‚Äôre cute. But no. Gargs are no effort and damage is irrelevant cause you afk with decent armor and use guthans or sharks. My alt made 4m a day there just in the background. 85 def

Like the other guy said, a lot of people‚Äôs times of availability are really limited and erratic. Like I wouldn‚Äôt have really been able to do a part time job, but 30 minutes here and there as I can? Yeah that‚Äôs feasible because it can be spontaneous. Got done studying/doing homework? Grind a bit. Waiting for 15 minutes for the next class to start? Lemme check my flips. Stuff like that is easy to do IMO
---
[removed]
---
You can just rock cake every five minutes.  Your health will get up to 5 or 6 during that time so you‚Äôll go through absorption‚Äôs faster but if it‚Äôs worth the afk then go for it.  Only thing more afk than that would be using prayer potions, but that would be too costly.
---
See? This is what I mean by my other comment. You're just trying to bait reactions, your trolling, even if you don't know that's what you're doing.
---
Well you seem to be venting unnecessarily without providing any usable feedback.
---
It's honestly a little ridiculous.
---
But thanks for your feedback. You have been credited one orange arrow for your time.
---
Some redundancy yes. I assume you mean contractions rather than conjunctions, and there is one. That‚Äôs a stylistic preference and I feel that it flows better with a contraction. Lack of content is purposeful, as the full discussion takes place in the following paragraphs that I chose to not attach to this post. As far as sloppiness goes, nothing is grammatically incorrect or flows improperly.
---
I was thinking wtf, first big drop and i get a 1 32k or some shit.   üòÅ

---
&gt;it's not higher exp rates compared to normal barbarian fishing
---
Literally never said that it was?
---
&gt;you said people wanted a method that was both less effort and more exp. you can only have one of those.
---
Do you not understand the concept behind this entire post? Let me break it down step by step for you since you seem to be having issues.
---
OP want to drop effort of barbarian fishing to level of other much more afk methods. Barbarian fishing have 2x exp of afk methods. Auto dropping no lowers exp by 2x. OP and supporters just want high exp afk method of training because they want RS3 sans MTX+EOC.
---
&gt;if you compare it to shift click barbarian fishing, it is not higher exp rates. if you compare it to some other afk method, it's not lower effort
---
You sure you're even replying to the right person?
---
Could you add the spottier cape weight reduction bonus to the Hunter Cape? It seems like it should fit thematically, in my opinion.
---
Valid question. Several reasons really, A was a konar task so had to do in catecombs, B still kinda low melee stats- 80 str, 85 atk, 89 def, and C not really comfortable bossing yet, only boss I have greater than 10 kc on is hespori.
---
isnt it though
---
No, just his hair
---
I haven't gotten void yet but the problem I see is that you can't wear tormented while wearing void, and you'll also take a ton of damage if you have low defence. If you have elite void but can't afford a tormented bracelet then it might be worth trying out, otherwise I'd stick with defensive gear and ideally use the tormented. You could swap to elite void for ranging Ahrim but I think it's actually more efficient to DDS spec him down
---
Also I basically never use SotD spec, you always use your spec on Ahrim regardless of whether you're using BP, MSB(i),or DDS, and your spec isn't always up by the time you enter the tunnels.
---
Just add in all the melee bosses that I can? Or do my standard point method without rock caking with all the good point bosses? The issue I see with that is I will auto retaliate Damis and Fareed etc without the gloves and would cause issues only looking every 5 minutes.
---
If you do hard rumble and more monsters you get more points. So use all the bosses you can that aren‚Äôt to hard to slow you down. I use about 8. Also hard is a must as they don‚Äôt get that much harder for the amount of point difference it is. As for the other stuff not sure but deff use hard it was best thing I did.

How do you make money from agility? Stamina‚Äôs or something?

I tried one of those early on before I knew how well obby works. Inferior to what I am currently doing as it would still have to be easy mode rumble and the cost of repairing guthans vs obby not degrading as well as higher hits makes obby the clear winner.

4:1 is how people generally do solo olm melee hand. The term means that for every 4 attacks you use, olm uses one. Being in a 4:1 cycle means you are always dodging the 1st and 2nd (the special i.e. spikes, lightning, teleport, healing) attacks, getting hit by the 3rd causing the 4th to be nulled. There are methods to also null flame walls by standing on certain tiles or moving at the right time

What is the potential for Seren themed Vestment Robes?  
---
Other Seren themed God items are a possibility, but perhaps in Prifddinas we could see a vendor sell a set of Seren vestment robes for coin or some special currency. This could offer a way for ironmen who have experienced bad clue luck, to purchase a set through other means. To do so they would have needed to get to Prifddinas which is an achievement by itself. Thematically it makes sense for it to potentially be sold there.
---
I know this response is late, however do you actually think other countries don't want their cartels to be running their governments? It's the same argument of saying if you don't want drugs in the US you'd remove them.

Probably. A lot of botters / RWTers / &lt;insert ToS violation here-ers&gt; use VPN's, so if one of them happens to use the same VPN as you then it's possible you'll get hit with a ban for something they did.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The act of using a VPN by itself is not a ban-able offense, but I wouldn't risk it unless it's your own personal &amp; private vpn that no one else has access to.

No I haven‚Äôt tried that yet, but I will look into it. On a side note thank you for finding me in the comments and taking the time to talk to me about this. I really appreciate it!

With everything still to come, I look forward to seeing the 5-year comparison of this place. I said before that Kourend would be one of my favorite OSRS updates; not because it was, or is,  good (though most the content there was pretty good for a city since launch), but because it has been one of the most community-driven pieces of content in the game and that kinda was partly the point of it. I always saw Kourend and Zeah as a whole as a foundation to be built upon; it probably shouldn't have needed to be reworked as part of that, but it is certainly working well as a foundation.

When stuff is considered for game integrity, or doesn't match its originally polled rates, they don't poll. And I'd agree they shouldn't

Every time they've increased membership prices, they've let people who were already paying the lower price continue to pay the lower price. So if you are someone who has been paying 5 a month since the time when that was the price, you still get to only pay 5 a month.

I‚Äôd suggest you actually use whatever few brain cells you have to go actually remap click to a button and see it doesn‚Äôt infinitely click and maybe actually educate yourself on AHK or go tweet Mod Ashe like I suggested so you can see how dumb you sound right now.

It might not be a default setting for Runelite, but it's called Loot Tracker. Look for that in the settings and turn it on, and it'll be its own tab on the right. You can even tell it to not track certain items, reset tracks, that kind of thing.
---
That's funny. For me, daily tasks were a big part of what finally got me to switch to OSRS. I hated feeling like I had to log in every day or else I was losing out on all my daylies, made playing feel like work.

My point is gaining do for running is like gaining xp for being logged in. You‚Äôre going to do it whether or not you gain xp for it.

void mage+dhide is clunky af.
---
&gt;buying things like mage's book and even eternals would give a larger increase.
---
hardly anything compared to torm &amp; heart.
---
you mightve also been calcing on a bad interval for torm given you didnt use boost pots/heart. dunno. really though its more important to not be using evoid range than anything and dhide+void mage is pretty clunky.

There will be no new method. Jmods aren't for this idea so it'd never get polled anyway. If players want AFK, they can do sharks or monkfish. But fast exp requires more effort.

If you‚Äôre going solo I‚Äôd say Sara, since you just have to run away from it the whole time. Arma is pretty decent to solo as well but it‚Äôs expensive if you use the chinning method. I think bandos and zammy are the hardest to solo unless you‚Äôre barraging them but I‚Äôve never attempted either solo

Except this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúless carpel tunnel‚Äù as you put it, it‚Äôs just eliminating training the skill entirely. Content like CoX, ToB, and most questing/bosses require tons of running. So you‚Äôre not just skipping early levels, you‚Äôre skipping like level 1-90 which is all you need anyway. Absolutely moronic idea.

I currently have normal void and using swamp trident with ice burst I can use 0 prayer potions a run tanking ahrim or karil in the crypt and freezing melee brothers in crypt once or twice depending on rng of swamp.

When can we see a sequel to A Soul's Bane? If you read the dialogue for the quest, Tolna talks at the end of an evil presence in the dungeon, watching and waiting, perhaps enjoying warping Tolna's mind. The character then says, "well at least we have advance warning now, thanks to you" or something like that. That was way back in 2006, and there has been no sequel for it. Perhaps a quest would elaborate on that evil presence, or perhaps a sequel would reveal that Tolna was mistaken and have someone's emotions warp the dungeon to have four rooms with "good" emotions instead. Either way, the way the dialogue to the end of the quest is written, it is just begging for a sequel.
---
"Tolna: I managed to find the remnants of the ancient civilisation that the stories talked about. It seems people used to worship a god there years ago in numbers far greater than a simple cult following. Sadly there is little remaining so I have nothing else to tell. As soon as I entered this area the ground swallowed me whole. I felt there was something watching, waiting. It's like there is some evil power under the ground that wanted me to suffer. As if it got some sort of empowerment from it. At least what ever it is, it doesn't want to reveal itself to the world yet..."

no food redemption and pool in poh

100 percent agree, pkers are typically more toxic to each other, especially if they are from clashing clans. Rule of thumb is that the more pkers in a clan present, the more likely they say toxic stuff cuz of that gang mentality. I've been in both casual single and multi clans and it's something I've noticed

Yall forgetting about tzhaar city. Game over when had 98s everyone

Are your GPU plugin settings the same as his? If he has lower draw distance or lower AA, then that might keep it stable. Even with a great card, some areas (like Mushroom forest) just have too many pieces to keep at a constant rate for most setups with high settings.

He‚Äôs an Ironman that did inferno with 1 defense and 45 prayer??? Yes he def earned it.

West Ardrougne plague reminds me of the Tuskeegee Syphilis experiment. Some parts of history in the United States are hard to imagine. I think it was only mentioned to me in grad school, surprisingly never in high school or maybe i missed that day of class
---
Hm?
---
Putting this here so it gets seen
---
This post and most of its comments are so beyond sad, everyone ganging up on a pker because he trash talks. Lol, you guys beleive thats justification for a PERMANANT mute? I strongly believe its obsured to mute someone without providing solid proof, and even then, I rarely believe a permenant mute is justified. Its just to extreme. Do you see athletes having their right to free speech taken away because they talk shit? What about when a criminal loses their shit to a cop? No. There are punishments, sure, but nothing similar to a "mute". Theres a reason its a basic human right in the developed world. 
---
The circle jerk against pkers has become laughable and embarrasing for the community at this point. We all play the same fucking game.
---
Raids 1,cox already took a lot of the good elements of dungeoneering and also allows you to use most of the skills, maybe appart from smithing...
---
You're a dickhead
---
Dps is king. Even if the diamond bolts only save you 1 attack long term that could be the zuk hit ur preventing. Brews shouldn't be an issue, I'd say the majority of attempts (90%+) that make it to zuk aren't dying because lack of brews. Getting zuk dead asap especially after enraging is a huge priority because if you miss 1 shield it could be the end. Just my 2 cents though, it can't hurt to try
---
Extra challenges from the limitation. Different meta to play around as well
---
&gt; Unironically caring about spoilers.
---
10k xp in 15 minutes?! Where???!!!
---
Damn, I thought my 182 was good yesterday, good job!
---
More clanmanmode at revs. 
---
Ew. :) oh well this is why i dont do wildy pvm lol. Idk how people do revs, I cba with having to tele every 2 minutes. Unless youre doing it with a clan I suppose.
---
There are dozens of us!! Dozens!!!
---
Dont think anyone can help you out with this. You learned the hard way to never buy a account. Sad story tho... hope you will still make a new account and enjoy the game.
---
That‚Äôs your own fault, hope you learned your lesson LOL
---
Birdhouse seeds such as jute seeds and others as well
---
Hey all!  
---
Is it possible to keep different tiered items of the same diary at the same time?  
---
I really don't wanna get rid of my tier - 1 chompy banner but I also basically have the requirements for the hard diary.  
---
Is there any way I can keep it? :(
---
This is dumb. Youre trying to be funny here i assume but it seems your plan backfired. You were a dick/douche for no reason. And nothing about your conversation with him is clever or funny..youre just being a douche..lmao.
---
Let's discuss the new player experience!
---
On almost every world, there are bots in the grand exchange advertising RWT, advertising scam swapping clans, or advertising some youtube video in order to phish players. This is highly detrimental to the new and existing player experience. When are you guys going to recruit more player moderators to police this aspect of the game? I think doing more to address this could help the new player experience.
---
Thank you for discussing the new player experience!
---
train hunter &amp; farming and do birdhouse &amp; herb runs, otherwise money-aware (s)killing will net you enough in members
---
99 runecrafting
---
Yeah, it's more of a desperation attempt to recoup 300+ dollars. It's a lesson learned, I just want to try to explore all opportunities before giving up
---
How does your runescape look this good?
---
I think expecting a Jagex mod to assist you in getting your money back after you got scammed by breaking their rules is way more than a longshot lmao
---
It's getting there
---
Is this series worth watching? It seems interesting but the long video times make me a little hesitant to start it
---
Sand crabs too, shamans which meant dwh in the game, farming guild, hydra, aerial fishing
---
Yes this the correct thing to do
---
Not gonna lie I don‚Äôt agree with OP, but for a grown man ‚Äòwith a wife and kids‚Äô to be that vicious to a stranger over the Internet... now that‚Äôs pretty pathetic
---
You're correct, they've really made zeah worthwhile going to. However, tithe farm is probably the **worst xp/h** for farming in game. Tree runs are like 1m/h if not more.
---
I think its more for the people who do tick manipulation for 12 hours a day.
---
You call that vicious? Must of had a sheltered life
---
r/cursedimages
---
I already know the difference. It was late when I wrote it so a mistake was made. Not really sure what you want me to say. With respect, I come to reddit for funny memes and the occasional serious discussion about the game. Not to talk about grammar where my posts are very readable.
---
Ex-rainbow gracer here, they got to me :(
---
Join the club I know the feels lol
---
Why'd you delete everything? All your vids, your reddit, and the discord server?
---
Initially, my explanation wasn't there. People made their assumptions and decided to vote based on that.
---
Tons of high level pvm gear progression goes random bullshit -&gt; void -&gt; absolute max gear. 
---
So unless you're a bond baby or a 1kc tbow type of dude just get the void
---
But in the case the client goes rogue I dont want my info out there
---
I think you know what to do now.
---
Can the functionality of the music player in-game be improved?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/HandsomeBloodyWoodpeckerMingLee
---
if you watch xzact this has gotten a lot cleaner nowadays, you do it in a different corner and dont usually have to take dmg on pillars. but you get the general idea. it's not entirely necessary but it removes some rng.
---
also yeah in digging up this clip i managed to actually find seanii doin pure attempts legit like 2 years ago back before nobody rly had pure capes.
---
When completing the Varrock and Kandarin diary you unlock alternates teleport locations, accessible through right clicking the original spell and configuring. Could we be able to talk to the respective diary tutor and split the alternative teleport location into its own spell in our spellbook? \[Creating a separate teleport icon for Seers' (S) and Grand Exchange (G)\]
---
Wait you guys are allowed to listen to music?
---
This is so powerful
---
L M F A O O O
---
ye also add daily/weekly ge price info kind of like stocks in newspapers, make varrock square into wall street lmao
---
Actually most people just get the favor because it doesn't take long at all and unlocks some great content.
---
Is this a personal attack or something
---
This would be so nice! Doesnt have to be super different but the variance would be appreciated greatly
---
learn what free speech is
---
Who needs strength xp without hp xp besides like low hp obby maulers?
---
I bet they add the ability to change the colours yourself now. That'd be cool, custom coloured hit splats &lt;3
---
Have a guy that glows in the dark sell it to you
---
I think you could shorten this to anyone who plays runescape is probably brain damaged.
---
You definitely haven't seen the previous post.
---
You ever see a spiritual mage splash on ice fiends?
---
How do you know you're being ddos'd?
---
Pretty hyped for this tbh, although a small change will impact more accounts than song of the elves

Autoclicking 99 strength, hell no

Awesome! Same in-game name?

Plus keeps more "american" hours

How do you get the infernal cape?
---
Ign is Paralocto
---
Yes. It's very awkward. Whoever has been in charge of animations lately isn't doing too well. The designs aren't bad though.
---
Agreed.
---
could you buff the void knight seal since nobody is ever buying it?
---
suggestions:
---
- 10 teles to pest control
---
- when equiped you do double damage in the minigame
---
Gg account
---
&gt;If you power mine with legit ~~human~~ inputs that's fine
---
Living organism.
---
The solution is just to lower magic defense overall, not flip the script and make 70 defense+ accounts the only viable PK build for bridding.
---
Because my internet crashes and i cant get back on it

I love both of these

&gt;With slayer you learn how to fight special monsters who can't just be fought the regular way. 
---
That's what slayer was supposed to be. When's the last time you had to kill a vampire with a stake or fight werewolves with that dagger?
---
I'm married with no kids and know better to be playing RuneScape when I could be with my wife or making money.
---
had to go past 99 for that hahahahaha
---
Jesus... wp. What were your stats?
---
okay so i just thought of the time to distribute the crack 
---
the next christmas event is just going to be as normal but except the christmas crackers are actually the crack because it has crack in the name so the crack is in it so when you crack the cracker u get crack (10) and a crackpipe so we can smoke crack on christmas this is such a great idea
---
&gt;The account **belongs** to the original owner and there is no stopping him from simply taking it back at any point of time.
---
False, legally speaking the account belongs to **Jagex**, which is why they are allowed to restrict your access to the account at will. If the account legally belonged to you, Jagex, for example, wouldn't be allowed to ban you for things like selling the account, since it's not their account to decide what you do with it. Anyway,  this is in their EULA. (Fun fact: this is also included in the EULA of essentially every online service you sign up for. You don't legally own the vast majority of accounts you have on websites, you just borrow them from the owners of the website. In simple terms, this makes it so that they can enforce rules on their platforms without the legal mess involving restricting people's access to things that are legally theirs.)
---
What this means is that the police can't do jack shit. He likely doesn't even know who actually owned the account in the first place, and it's not like Jagex is going to give OP that information for the police to look into.
---
Thats what happens when your game contains gambling unfortunatly, the game should be rated 18+
---
How about the game isn't fun to begin with, and is just another kind of high to chase like gambling or drugs.
---
Theyve already proven that changing images/menus are possible with Runelite, id like to see an option to replace any in game image with your own, id finally be able to use the 08+ Herb sprites for example, the 07 ones are awful
---
Woah
---
Food and ammo wasn't needed, because I used guthans to gain hitpoints when needed. Armour repair costs were around ~1m.
---
Whats the point of farming karma
---
About 5 weeks
---
Please add this!
---
bro trust me theres no skilling linked to smoking crock anyone can smoke it 
---
in a perfect world crack should be free so it will be free to obtain unless it is bought from another player
---
If that's the case. You're lying about how much details you have on the account. Account recovery is way easy. It's the reason behind most hijackings.
---
Thanks I'll take a look! How many people do you have?
---
God damn my boy came prepared with sources.
---
Remove jad pet because zuk pet is better
---
that's how the gambler's fallacy works. you should probably stay away from sand casino lol
---
probably about 220
---
There are several options and many many videos on making gp.
---
You could
---
-Rush 77 slayer and camp brutal black dragons
---
-loot in bh world
---
-get 75 mage and range and camp zulrah
---
-do wilde or konar slayer
---
-make unfinished potions
---
-camp revanants
---
-camp cave horrors
---
-camp gargoyles
---
-do runecrafting
---
-do practically any gathering skill
---
-barrows
---
if you use the runelite plugin you can see when the streams are going to change, so you know when to swap
---
you dont always get banned you know that right

just don't give up

NICE youre a life saver!

*torvesta intensifies*
---
He only uses his alt accounts dedicat3d and MrMole73 now.
---
It makes perfect sense because that's what a bastard is.
---
That's definitely true. It took me 5 tries to get the cape. I died at Jad every time on my first 4 tries.
---
It's getting downvoted because this is reddit.  Redditors downvote people, not ideas, who they see as outsiders to their collective opinion.  The collective opinion of this subreddit happens to be anti-PvP and that all PKers are toxic.  There is a belief that the "right" way to play the game is by PvMing and competing on the skills leaderboards.  This positive feedback loop of self-righteousness gives the illusion that redditors are part of the majority when in reality the world outside of reddit is quite large, and this applies to pretty near every subreddit.
---
One of us! One of us!

Wine? Nah I just guthan the shit out of the bruma roots
---
If the median lifespan decreases that still shifts the boundary of middle age lower tho
---
We also need a priority of healbars and the attack list. I don‚Äôt care that some guys Karil is at 20 hp. I‚Äôm supposed to kill mine and gtfo. Why would his npc be on top. Also there is no fucking way to check which one I‚Äôm supposed to attack when they are stacked

I've been trying but i fail every time

Were you under the impression that gargoyles were substantially more than 4k a kill?
---
Gmaul pure is nice  to start with, later on it  can be 60att if gmaul gets boring.
---
&gt;I don't want these hitsplats 
---
why?
---
the only possible reason i could come up with is you don't want change (which is valid).
---
how braindead easy boomer generation was. They spawned the best gen and now the gen after ours will be crap. And the circle repeats. We need another war to mentally destroy people.
---
B0aty is your friend.
---
I doubt you didn't use a calculator to do that math
---
Complete the Inferno.
---
Yeah, the original attempted to be realistic which is a downside in humour.
---
That looks like Monni, it the text had Wirgin instead of Virgin it would have been a good reference
---
I guess you just bolt him as he escapes then? Do you have any idea how this actually works? How you need freezes to kill somebody?
---
Gear worth like 25k should not make it that easy to escape.

maybe when posting event time, use the clock in the clan chat tab

After 20 minutes afk your character stops attacking back.

If the community wants it, sure
---
Yep all these REEEEEEE ezscape people use runelite, hypocrites.
---
In a vulgar manner he basically said he didn't deserve it, it's only one kc! What are you, an idiot?
---
Yeah but you can't really release those back into them can you
---
you're right, I did use a calculator since its a freely available resource. I also rounded to 41m since its so close. 
---
third point I'm a brainlet
---
pretty sure he chose the rsn 'zezima' b.c it's his last name so some may share his last name
---
I read this and questioned the 560 hours a week before even realising he said he had 27 kids.. shit man
---
Listening to people talk about how "surely it would be easy" regarding other peoples' code they've never seen is really irritating
---
There's no way to get an auto default setting to 1-click jewelry box, right?
---
He repeats over and over that he fucks up with rule making and needs to redefine things to better fit reality of situations. It's not him being an ass it's his desire for consistent rules. Noob.
---
Lmaoo that is legit the type of ppl that watch swampert
---
Everyone ranting like he literally had half a video explaining rules. Like wtf there was a 12 min time stamp he told you to use if you want to skip the rules. Why all the salt being thrown?
---
This content is devaluing my account where I just stand at the Grand exchange and act jealous when I see a fire cape :/
---
dumb ass if you aint selling it, why are u price checking it
---
now everyone wears graceful and its disgusting

bring back the lederhosen hats

I'll be your gf for the account

Ta :)

Can someone explain the 12 rules of life book meme?
---
Just do a charge back?

Looked like everything was made of clay to me.
---
Oh snap I‚Äôm legit about to do this after work today, just hope I don‚Äôt get banned or something for it
---
Literally EoC SMH my head
---
Maybe that's it. I'm never going to download imgur app lol
---
Fuck you pig
---
It looked like everything was made from clay
---
Not Op. I‚Äôm usually fine with change. I just think they are kind of ugly. I‚Äôd be cool with it if they changed the colour. 
---
Regardless, I‚Äôll still vote for them because I know they are a good thing for the game, even if I don‚Äôt quite like the aesthetic.
---
what is that key symbol?
---
muppet lmao
---
Is it still worth to begin runescape? It looks fun
---
Yeah i shouldve added that my version is just a spanish slang word. Was funnier my way tbh
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs nuts. I had the windows open and fans on yesterday and it was around 36.
---
They banned it only because it got super popular. Other fairly popular subs with the n word still exist.
---
Let me guess, you lost your hardcore status at the wintertodt?
---
Does he work? Or does Swampletics fund him?
---
Good plan! I can see how that run gets tiring, definitely not a bad idea to cut back a bit. Also Hespori has a chance at Tangleroot, so if you have the ability to do that, I would suggest that as well.
---
&gt;I'm having to edit a LOT of combat damage code, and I'm not finished, so it'll be weeks before launch.

rng i guess.

This is really nooby but where can I farm gargoyles? I just unlocked them on slayer and only thought you could kill them with a task
---
I support nailing gnomes
---
You right. Btw do you know when this update is coming?
---
For Some reason I got an beginners nest from birdhouses lol, so that is possible
---
Who? What did I miss out on
---
On my first week playing I caught a guy drop trading a green phat and blue h mask and was able to get the mask ( this was around 2004-2005) so my irl friend told me that they were pointless and that I should sell it in w1 varrock gen store...so that‚Äôs what I did!
---
Are you allowed to do this? Surely this isn't what you're being paid for? lmao

Any time I hear animal I have become by three days grace my mind is transported to the warriors guild grinding out tokens

i believe they were aiming it for summer, so hopefully in the next 3-4 months?
---
How man gmauls bro? Just out of curiosity.

I mentioned wingstone in my other comment, the tag feature is a great solution for them blending in, but the fucker wanders so much you can be in the middle of his range and he‚Äôs out of npc render distance

‚ÄúAt least 1‚Äù

Minimum 5.

I miss that mini-game
---
IMO its overall deflation(Opposite of inflation) because of the duell arena tax.

Your not getting poorer your money just holds more buying power.
---
No Tyrone
---
Yep Salve (ei) is MASSIVELY important, if you don‚Äôt hit over a 30 for both specs tele to house and get your spec back, then run back so you don‚Äôt have to pot again. As Crat0z said only eat during acid or frozen stages. Not sure what else to tell you really you seem to have everything covered.
---
Don't give up, looks like other people have given an answer.
---
That's why I can never really complain at that ü¶Ä5$ü¶Ä life
---
Well that's good at least. From looking through a previous reddit thread it seems like it's fine, as Jagex would have to region-lock an account for it to be an offense, though I can't imagine they would be too happy about people getting a 60% discount because of exchange rate and vpn shenanigans.
---
(It's 5$ a month if you get the Mexico 6 month package, I'm honesty really tempted).
---
You‚Äôre doing something very wrong if your PB is 3:30 with 97 range.
---
+1, now all we need is a j-mod reply
---
What is it?
---
That requires not only a large cash stack but also you need to be prepared to have all that money tied up in battlestaves for a while and then wait for them to be alched, which again is only really possible if you have plenty of money to let you do other things.

im thinking similar. torn between pisc blue, brimhaven blue and purple and really wishing i could play around with a model viewer before comitting

1. Hop until you find a world where all 3 blue streams jump after eachother (no greens inbetween)
---
2. Try to go for the first blue that jumped, even if it disappears soon, it has a good chance to be replaced by one of the two other blues immediately.
---
3. Exercise patience. It's better to waste 1-2 tick to see if you can chain blues than to swivel around.

Now equip the rune kite shield with it :0

Did you ever die?

The joke splashed
---
The combat triangle is bullshit because freeze the dude and camp pray range/hides and their only option is to bolt you through prayer, that‚Äôs a terrible meta.  Mage and range need to be roughly equivalent so pray flicking and switching rewards skill over braindead bolting

No just save the image on your pc then when you make a post upload the image instead of the imgur url.  It only needs to be imgur if the picture is in a comment.
---
Great picture btw
---
This is awful information, it's so easy to spoof emails. All of the phishing emails are being spoofed to show that they are being received from the emails you have just approved as safe.
---
No because then players who had voted would take screenshots and post them over Reddit and Twitter, defeating the whole point of hiding poll results.
---
I can see your point, but i think jokes about racisim ingame dont have any place on this subreddit
---
Principles refer to the general concept and idea of free speech, not the legal definition of such.
---
Hang tough man
---
If you play the games right, you play them for yourself, so $5 and MTX will win every single time, because you're not obliged to pay for MTX, and whales who can afford to, can do it either way.  
---
I don't see how that affects you.
---
Could do black chins without being disrupted even though I‚Äôd usually kill or make the PKer tele out.  Was just trying to grind some levels.
---
Tell me which part of runescape besides economy that has been fucked since forever is multiplayer aspect of it.
---
If someone wants to dump 20k on MTX, let them, that doesn't affect your gameplay at all.
---
Soon enough the new Chad's will just be people who take care of themselves and live a fulfilling life. This meme shit is wild.
---
You could try the clan chat 'cheah'. You're a little below the requirements but theyre pretty lenient while you finish them off. They teach raids, all general pvm and have a pretty active discord
---
Thanks man for being concerned. No need to follow up. I appreciate the prayers and I'm sending mine to yoy as well. I hope your economic war comes to a peaceful conclusion soon.
---
How are you supposed to stop someone from escaping then dumb fuck?
---
I ironically love these
---
I think they are Louis Vuitton
---
Armadyl is a great duo boss. So long as you dont mind the cost of chins and blood barrage.
---
Also mobile hype is over.
---
More items coming into each day at a faster rate than new players coming. With things like WDR discord people do raids 24/7.
---
Osrs also doesnt have proper item sinks neither does it have the old death mechanics.
---
Imagine not just buying your skilling supplies from shops.
---
All of those are strawmen except the one about Marxism in education. That is something he often speaks of. 
---
He doesn't literally say that humans are like lobsters, he only makes the comparison to show the importance of serotonin. 
---
&gt; His actual self help advice isn't bad but his worldview is insane.  Remember that he got his start by protesting against the idea that you should call refer to a transgender person by their preferred pronoun. 
---
From what I understand he believed that a law in Canada's parliament would potentially compel speech. He hasn't said that he wouldn't refer to a trans person by their preferred pronouns if they only asked him. 
---
I don't think his worldview is insane, but he is wrong on a few things, global warming is a perfect example.

this is the kind of quality posting i come to this sub for

FoG. It was a game that provided you with unlimited runes but halved mage xp. Rewards provided BiS mage gear and melee shields for f2p

Any particular reason why you don't cannon greater demons?

This is Settled.

the snipping tool is literally right there

Just hit print screen. You don't have to do anything with it right the second. Hit print screen, leave the raid, chill. Then open up paint or some shit and paste it in and post later... This is horrible.

Then they'll tell you they built their own distro

Actually, run energy drain rate is only affected by the weight you're carrying. Agility levels control how quickly it regenerates when depleted. [Source](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Energy)
---
I think the main goal that the mods have been talking about is adding options to increase the regen rate for beginning/F2P players who have low agility levels and thus really slow regen rates. This suggestion sounds like a pretty good way to do it, I think. It adds a use to firemaking, adds multiplayer engagement (can build fires for others to use), and would be useful for low level/F2P without changing anything for higher levels because it'll never be as good as staminas anyway.

dude do your research before you spout inaccurate facts. he wasnt protesting against the idea that you should use preferred pronouns, he was advocating against it being written into LAW. Transgender people aren't even the main point here, it was all about the infringement on free speech. People shouldn't have to be forced to memorize an infinite amount of pronouns for people they dont know and be able to be prosecuted if they don't want to/don't say it correctly. He has nothing against trans but everything against speech laws.

Best advice is use that money to quest which will unlock more content to make the money back. 500k isnt much, but will help you get all the quest items before hand for most quests and to stock up on potions for hard battles. Have fun!

my father didn't understand much about games or the internet but he understood happiness and I guess at the time, he knew I needed it and to this day even after the release of OSRS I'm still using the same name he picked for me, Edith Mianus.
---
Only a few years into my teens, I found the pun he made, he was my best friend, even if he didn't under the current trends from when I was a kid, he made it work and it made me happy. I miss him.  
---
I play OSRS because its a great game but every time I stopped playing for awhile, I feel myself draw back and there it is. The login screen, the music, the twin flames on the side, I enter my details and I remember, my father loved me the best he could in the only way he knew how, through my happiness, I miss you dad, I love you. I log in and I see Lumbridge all over again, From that day, I've been playing almost everyday for months because it brings me memories of my father being happy because I was happy.

thx for checking, il have to play around with runelite settings

Dumb questions about magic:
---
Does autocasting with the defense exp option decrease DPS?
---
Also, which spells/staves DPS scale with your magic level? 
---
Thanks

Absolutely pointless thing to flame someone over. ‚ÄúHow dare you give me a lower quality image‚Äù get over it man.

I thought modern f2p was pretty busy, especially with mobile's release.

Even with that Sprint 3G USB dongle. Nice!
---
Vork with 300ping cause why the fk not.
---
Wait why would an ironman buy gold instead of getting to 40 mining/smithing for dank infinite jewelry?
---
From what I've heard, the "problem" is that there are very few pkers nowadays, which I wouldn't exactly say is all that true to begin with if you're comparing it to a couple years ago. The stuff that everybody else is mentioning like high barrier to entry/no incentive are difficulties in getting new people to start pvp.
---
About the high barrier to entry, this usually ends up being a problem for middle cb (65-80) accounts with normal stats, since most fights in pvp worlds would be against pures who have significant stat advantages. For max or somewhat close to max accounts (100+ cb), pking is much more doable if you're just melee/veng fighting. In typical veng fighting, you could bring 200k risk and have decent success. Many people refer to pvp as specifically hybriding or tribriding deep wild with switches, but that's not true; veng pking is popular, fun, and simple.
---
Okay but if you nail him down how is he supposed to fix your diseased crops ??
---
If you do it perfectly then you dont take much damage outside of certain spots, but that implies a perfect run whereas many mains who get the cape make a few mistakes during their runs and are bailed out by their stats and armor. 45 prayer is actually more impressive since prayer is a large constraint during the inferno.
---
You know what to do.

Just made a HCIM but I‚Äôd rather keep ‚Äúworking on my main‚Äù lol
---
You need to re read the original post. The "I think" part was in reference to him being 18. "Probably" was in reference to wealthy parents, so by your own logic he was telling us to think that.
---
Is this like a personal attack or something?
---
I really like your watercolors, they're rather minimalistic yet so expressive with what there is.
---
After your recent comment about the complexities of conveying the danger of the wilderness, I really expected a dark, robed silhouette holding a staff just on the horizon.

Just don't go there?

**If I told you, verbatim, ‚ÄòI think the earth is flat and vaccines don‚Äôt work.‚Äô, I would hope to GOD you‚Äôd understand that the ‚Äòvaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äô bit is also included in the ‚ÄòI think‚Äô.** 
---
Same goes if I say, ‚ÄòThe earth is probably flat, and vaccines probably don‚Äôt work‚Äù. At no point did I claim to be telling the truth. 
---
Now, using your example, if he said ‚ÄòSettled plays Runescape all day because his parents are well off and he must not need to worry about a backup career.‚Äô, you‚Äôd actually have a point. But alas, he did not, and you dig your logic hole even deeper.
---
Why is this non answer posted so often, paying real money is the obvious solution to membership you really think that it didnt cross their mind? 
---
If someone is looking to buy bonds clearly they are not interested in spending real money, perhaps the idea of making money in game is not as much of a chore for them as it is for you and they do not mind spending that time. Working OT at some shitty service job with terrible hours vs relaxing at home listening to music/podcast or chatting in discord while grinding gp, the choice is easy to me. At a point you start making enough to buy bonds just by ‚Äúenjoying the game‚Äù anyway.
---
If its about supporting jagex, they already sold the bond and made their money.

Absolutely zero sympathy from me, there are loads of 'beginner guides' on you tube such as the one created by Theoatrix that breaks down the game brilliantly for new players along with 1-99 guides for each of the skills.  I'm all for catering to new players but when someone  starts complaining about not having the correct tools to cut a tree down I think its time to go back to fortnite.
---
Even if it did crash stamina‚Äôs it wouldn‚Äôt be by much. People question would still rather take stams than a tinder box and some logs. I doubt they‚Äôd even crash much.

Damn man, I really hope you can get over your addiction and just enjoy the game without staking. But I imagine it'll be hard to find anything that gives that rush of winning so much so fast.

Also, don't give your opponents odds with that sub 99 def!

Is this actual lore or just something you made up? It's a nice explanation, but based on the incandescence of magma, the fire cape would be much hotter then the infernal cape.
---
You understand the itch.... my only focus is to learn how to enjoy the game again but as you just said I compare all gains to wasted time staking... money has no meaning when you can win or lose 500m in 60 seconds
---
do you have a source to show that beginners clues reduced the odds of getting other clues?

it was something like: cannon range, blowpipe hp, then str

..did you try changing your password? If not then yes its a phishing email. Also if its from "asta lavista" that is clearly not from jagex lol. Arnold Schwarzenegger doesnt work for jagex.

It's a phishing email, I've seen the exact same email (with the same email address) on this subreddit at least a dozen times already. Jagex might send you an email to confirm a change to your account, but never to cancel it.

Nah, ruins game immersion, if this game was all about getting to one place in the fastest amount of time, then sure.

There's no p2w to begin with.

Having higher skills than other players has no advantage.
---
And you could say same about new player POV when they come into game and everyone with way higher levels does some things like mining faster than them.
---
Nothing to do with MTX.

There's no feelings involved, it's just a fact that Runescape, whether you like it or not, is pretty much personal experience with some multiplayer elements like PK and boss raids.

Nah. How long till op deletes? Over/under 1 hr?
---
I would still like to see Agility come to F2P, though. There‚Äôs plenty of low-level city/town courses accessible to F2P as it is and it would be nice to give players more to do.
---
Not to mention Agility would be a passive bonus to run energy while this bonfire suggestion could be an active bonus that requires no movement or combat.
---
Either way, I like the idea. Support.
---
Great idea, only edit I would make is that these effects do NOT stack with gracefull and/or other bonuses (such as the stamina potion). Otherwise it would be far too OP.
---
(And by doing this gracefull won't lose its value because even tho resting would be great for run energy the downside is that you're not moving)

Nice.

Except that... Catering to these noobs is literally exactly what they are trying to do by brainstorming community ideas, lmao.  New player retention rates are too low for Jagex's taste, so they are trying to find an agreeable way to fix this.  Personally, out of everything I've heard lately, this suggestion seems the most acceptable.
---
Maybe because he... doesn't want to?
---
Here fishy fishy fishy, keep coming back when you said you were gonna leave &lt;3
---
" there is really no excuse to not get mem since there are bonds how about actually support the game  "
---
Who really gives a shit about the game if they don't know anything about the game?

How about first make new players care about the game and then push bond onto their face.
---
Makes me sad.

Range is probably the highest priority. Maybe then melees and mage? I'd just go to 90+ all stats, you may have a hard time finding consistent teams with your current stats.
---
Made it up, but the fact you believed it means it should probably be lord cuz it makes sense
---
Idk what you mean by "unhealthy"
---
I love this idea, it actually gives a point to training fire-making (utility). Although I feel if you're burning more expensive logs, others should be able to benefit from recovered run energy (albeit at a reduced rate). 
---
x4 for normal logs is way too high though. Resting in classic runescape recovers at a multiplier of x6.4.
---
Normal x2
---
Oak x3
---
Willow x4

up to like magics at x8/x10 (better then resting in EOC rs).
---
Rip the Chilean economy
---
What are you mad about? Who hurt you?
---
training str by maging wizzy tower lesser demon?
---
Burning logs is still the best xp/hr. The concept of afk is a big problem in this game as it hurts the social aspect of the game. Which is the most important factor of an mmo. The problem is, with all the clicks and space required for fm you cant even be social when you are giving the game 100% attention. 
---
The choice is either wt for great xp + good profit or burning logs which is best xp but its all at a loss of gp. Click intensity should not be a factor here. Just like its not a factor for smelting, herblore or cooking.
---
Why is the head of the character icon blacked out
---
New players are quite literally the most important thing for the future of the game. New player experience is objectively bad right now.

That‚Äôs actually a really good idea, a tiny robed silhouette and ancient staff

Go play rs3 you dummies. You literally have a game that already has that shit. If you want to continue to ruin the genuine OS experience keep on suggesting these lame ideas

For me, his videos lies somewhere in between regular twitch streams and a tightly edited 15-min Settled video, which is one of the reasons I love his videos so much. It gives you the feeling of watching VODs where the most boring and lengthy parts of the grind have been left out, but still benefits from the traditional video editing. Also the viewer are regularly given some golden moments throughout the video, like who else would sing a 3 min musical 2:07:00 into a 2:30:00 long progress episode? Or what about the commentary on how shocked he was when he gained a mind-boggling **4 levels** in the same clip?
---
Well fuck that then. I dont know why. Thought I were right at something in my life.

Well, his views range from standard Christian conservatism with a thin modern veneer to really weird pseudoscientific garbage like when he uses lobsters as an excuse for human hierarchy or my personal favourite, argues that ancient Chinese, Egyptian and aussie aboriginal cultures had knowledge of DNA and the double helix.

Lol without new players say goodbye to osrs.

Its as simple as that and tbh I'm against the graphics changing. 
---
Pvp needs to be reworked that will bring a huge amount of people to the game. And I dont even pk seriously. 
---
Also I think that focusing on why things are better and increasing mid lvl content will be the next move to do.
---
Lmao, that's disgusting. Visiting that sub and agreeing upon their sentiments, is essentially an act of terror. Pigs!
---
I'm going to have to agree with OP. You really need to step away from the game, and consider seeking help for your gambling addiction. Your account will likely get suspended for buying gold anyways, it's a good idea for your own well being to quit.
---
Quest help please! I think it may be a bug, or I'm stupid and can't figure out what's wrong. Im doing Family Crest and I'm at the part where you have to make the "perfect" gold ring and necklace. I got the perfect gold ore and smelted them into the perfect gold bars, I then use the bar on the furnace and select "make ruby ring" and nothing happens. I have the two perfect gold bars, two cut rubies, the ring mould and necklace mould in my inventory. I don't see what I'm doing wrong. Nothing pops up in the chat or anything, simply nothing happens. Is this a bug?? Thanks!!!

It's a very politicized issue, friend. Their word isn't worth as much as you think it is.
---
All they really said about Peterson's assessment of C-16 is that you won't go to jail for refusing to use people's pronouns. However C-16 's purpose is... "This enactment amends the *Canadian Human Rights Act* to add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. "
---
So yes refusing to call someone their preferred pronoun (even a wacky made up one like xir) could be considered discrimination. These cases would be brought to human rights courts who could order someone to pay a fine or something. Peterson asks what happens when you don't pay the fine or go to the sensitivity training? Logically it could lead to jail time.
---
But he said to move along! Wit a period before AND after!

Only members with a minimum of 300 total level and 25+ hours play time can vote. They are the stated guidelines that determine whether or not a player can have a say in the game‚Äôs future. Poll results are also hidden. Your opinion of ‚Äòbad direction‚Äô is just as opinionated as my suggestion. Don‚Äôt need to point out how this kills your argument.
---
 I knew reddit would be a tough crowd given the people on 2007scape are very invested in what RuneScape was, is and what it stands for (which is a great thing!) But in turn how (my opinion) that may‚Äôve blunted wider progression as a result of a minority that are willing to set their Reddit feed on new to let themselves be heard about suggestions that might jeopardise their childhood nostalgia. Apologies for the personal dig, but this is always what it feels like.
---
- I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as easy to confirm a stereotype as I have done in the past 20 mins. Your comment is similar to others, and similar to the example in my post. Just not worth replying to.

Questions:

OSRS is a business and naturally will be interested in increasing player base.

You have agreed in your comment that what I‚Äôve said in my post is correct, that better visuals may bring more players to RuneScape.

I'm trying to think of places where this would be potentially broken to camp a FM alt for groups of people, specifically ironmen who lack the Herblore for stam pots.

well if you had read the deleted comment i was replying to the guy said he was a physical therapist and that it was actually tendonitis but people here call it RSI, and I have had tendonitis but had never heard of RSI other than on 2007scape and was wondering if it was just a difference in terminology. Thanks though.

Could‚Äôve sworn I saw a tweet that stated if you rolled a clue you already had, you would receive nothing.
---
Lonely
---
Personaly not a fan of this idea, however I do acknowledge that there is a problem with run energy. I remember runescape had something like rest where you could sit anywhere for like 30 seconds and regain full energy, I didn't really like that idea either.
---
You're also mis-stating Peterson's point on the lobster thing. He states the existence of dominance hierarchies (supported by serotonin) in lobsters as a clear example of hierarchical structures outside of human society. 
---
He also alludes to this as a potential justification for the way that our society is currently structured, but when confronted about it (as in the much mocked [Cathy Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZnygvRRmPE) interview) he says "it's inevitable there will be continuity in the way animals and human beings organize their [societal] structures." Which if you want to talk about crazy world-views, there you go.

Whenever I get a legit email like this from any site, it tells me to ignore it if I didn‚Äôt request it. This is a sad try.

You're a whole ass main at this point vro

I think the lesson you need to take from this is how to act like a mature adult. If you act that way in real life you're going to have real problems. I don't really think continuing this conversation any further is going to do anything useful.

Have a good day.

Best of luck in your career dude!

Champions cape. 1/5000 drop from each of the challengers, so on average 50k kills on things that generally don't give great loot

Ruins the point of playing an MMO, dumb argument

If you don't talk because of the majority of users being foolish and not contributory, that's an argument id buy. But avoiding speaking to any user is just disrespectful

C'mon guys get him even thought he is appealing because he knows he didn't macro, not even once
---
&gt; **The game doesnt need changes to help pvp**, other than fixing the economy so loot is worth the trouble, people need to change.
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Please tell me youre trolling and arent actually this clueless. PvP needs fixes/changes/updates in the absolute worst was possible, as you can see by how dead PVP is in this game now.
---
Truly blows my mind how absolutely clueless many people are on this sub when it comes to knowing anything about PvP.

The thing is man, runescape isn‚Äôt the problem here. Gambling is, runescape is an outlet for you to relieve your gambling addiction which is where the problem stems from. The solution to your craving is usually a one click teleport away, your gambling addiction has already translated from solely in game to in real life as well. You‚Äôre spending hard earned cash on pixelized gambling, that‚Äôs a problem. People downplay the significance of gambling addictions however they are on par with extremely severe drug addictions. Gambling ruins peoples lives, it kills people, it tears apart families. 
---
A guy that works for me, his brother is clean 10 years now, however he used to be an extremely successful entrepreneur. He was extremely wealthy by the age of 23, close to around 1 million net worth through software development. Had an amazing house, 2 beautiful kids, comfortable and making heaps of money. 
---
He went to the casino on his birthday which is where it all went downhill, he won a few hundred but that was short lived. Over the next few months he would go occasionally, to frequently, go not going to work so he could chill there all day. He‚Äôd tried quitting for months now and went behind his wifes back, he started selling stock and assets to fund his addiction, he would win some and lose some. He got to the point he was dumping tens of thousands of dollars, ended up losing close to $900,000 over the course of 3 years. His wife could no longer handle it, they had to sell their house and live in an apartment, kids were taken out of private school, ended up divorced, court order meant he could never see his kids. He was extremely violent and became an alcoholic, he lost everything and went homeless.
---
All because of $100 which spiraled his addiction, you need to understand this addiction is **severe** and you need to get help for yourself man. You‚Äôre already dumping money into funneling your addiction, one severe addiction over another is not a solution to your problems. It‚Äôs only going to get worse for you, significantly worse. Get help before it‚Äôs too late man. While it may not seem as bad currently; I can assure you from an outside perspective you‚Äôre addicted to gambling and that‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs why you can get help to aid your resolution before it gets worse. Every addiction starts somewhere, stop it while it‚Äôs early.

Im usually friendly too and make a ton of friends at GE daily but it's always those situations where you have a long friendly conversation then add each other when one has to go and then you never actually talk again even though you see each other online all the time lol.. I can't be the only one who experiences this
---
Is this what people say to you after you ask how to get laid
---
Almost like bonfires which granted a temporary max HP boost. Nah, this is so pointless. Just walk instead of wasting time next to a "fire", which destroys osrs main vibes too.

It's possible.  Several (not RL) plugins track people's damage accurately.
---
Resources shouldnt be half the fight it should ne there to help if you make a mistake the fight should rely on skill
---
The JMods just talked about it on stream. They didn't want to develop this since shift drop already exists and is close enough, and it would also apply only to fish that people don't want to bank, which is a pretty slim share. They also thought the carpal tunnel joke was serious, I think.
---
It doesn't give any purpose to do fires unless you wanna throw away your time on an unneeded activity lol..
---
he doesn't look like mohammed
---
&gt; he says "it's inevitable there will be continuity in the way animals and human beings organize their [societal] structures." Which if you want to talk about crazy world-views, there you go.

I don't see the crazy in this. Mind explaining? I'm ready to be proven wrong.

Watch his Zizek 'debate' for an idea of how lost Peterson is outside psychology. Bringing just the Communist Manifesto to a discussion with a Marxist scholar is like bringing a pencil to a graphical design lecture in 2019

Back when the mod Jed thing was happening (before people knew it was a jmod leaking info), it was theorized that people were getting their accounts recovered after posting valuable drops with their RSN's showing... So people started blacking out their account names so others wouldn't know who to hack (Which then evolved into blacking out HP, run energy, random inv. items, skills, etc.)
---
I'd do this with the butler so hard, make him tele 1 step next to the bank, and tele back next to the con spot.
---
&gt;So yes refusing to call someone their preferred pronoun (even a wacky made up one like xir) could be considered discrimination.
---
Except the body of lawyers in Canada said it wouldn't be treated like that, could is a big word there and it falls to legal interpretation, I'm going to trust the people that know how to interpret law. And yeah, heaven forbid trans people get protections from discrimination just like religions, sex, race, marital status, disability and more! Furthermore, as someone who's best friend is trans and is incredibly active in the trans community, literally all the enby people I talk to go by they, and they say they don't know any enby people that go by these weird pronouns either. You've been on TiA too much if you think those are at all prevalent and a reason to deny trans people protections from discrimination.
---
I really want to try this minigame but no one is ever there. Has lms been revived already?

Why dont we just remove running make everyone walk. Put it on an even ground.

For absolutely zero dollars I'd be happy to click+drag entire forests, stalls, and wine spawns for Jamflex to get rid of these bots that scripts can't detect.
---
Gotta pray mage if you don‚Äôt have a anti dragon/dfs/ df ward.
---
I fucking love this idea. It's balanced too as you have to be near a fire to rest, unlike in RS3 where you can literally rest anywhere. Also provides another use for creating fires, especially early-game for new players. Also feels very "Old School". Great idea!

As long as the quest includes some reference to 'trailblazing' or 'Blazing your own Trail' etc. in the title then I'm all for it! haha

Aw I'm sorry you feel disrespected by users who don't feel like interacting with your obviously wonderful personality.

Define a little while ago.

The day they released overloads, because I was already 99 herblore. The game was infinitely fun if you were one of the relative few with access to them and spec restores.
---
I... what? It doesn't ruin fuck all, that's their own way of playing. Arbitrarily dictating what is or isn't the "right" way to play is what ruins the point of an MMO.

Appeal to accomplishment is a logical fallacy

Probably my favorite PvP encounter I brought like a knife, shovel, and clue for 0 risk. A guy tried to skull trick me, and just gave up and attacked me. He realized I didn't have anything and he said "fuck it, I'll box you." So I kicked him to death, then he logged his main and wiped me out while I tried to get some loot. Worth losing the clue for the laugh.

Nobody here is a true doomer. All I see is happy people trying to find a label. *sigh*

And with extra supplies! Well done
---
Dragon Slayer 2 and Monkey Madness 2 are both 2 of the hardest quests in the game, but the unlocks they give you are amazing.
---
You don't want it to be better than staminas. This would be for more of a feel-good factor for new players at the end of the day. Depending on the log type, perhaps there actually isn't a time save over walking? But if it gives the illusion that it's quicker, they may feel more compelled to keep playing since they can technically run everywhere so long as they keep a tinderbox and a few logs handy.
---
Achieving 99 fishing in LRC and finally being able to buy dragon claws... which I lost in about 48 hours after that to a one itemer rusher with a barrage to gmaul spec. 27-21-28, will never forget those three numbers.

gz, thats insane! your name reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMJk4y9NGvE) scene from Rick n Morty

Wait that actually sounds cool, how does it work?
---
I bet it's been exciting to see all of your old friends slowly return to the game! 
---
I was a big fan of running quests too, there's just  something therapeutic about exploring the stories and solving the different puzzles they had in them.
---
Where in VA?
---
Ohh... oh dear. That‚Äôs unfortunate. Yeah I think I might put that RC on the back burner as well.

Pretty sure they're bank*rolling* ardy bakers.

Building up an insane armory just eats your cash stack and prevents you from buying BiS stuff for when you need it

I guess most people just disagree though for some reason and I'm getting downvoted lol
---
Yes, in RS2. People don't typically like it on this sub because apparently it's an RS3 trait these days. That's why you have to be cautious when you make a suggestion like this and you have to be clear why it makes much more sense than RS2 rest.

If Ourania is like 45k xp/hr you can do it in only 288 hours. Over 4 weeks that means you have to play ten hours a day.

Someone needs to write a post that tells you all the cool stuff runelite can do cuz I barely know how to use it

This is too accurate.

Have you ever heard him talk about philosophy, history, politics or psychology? The only people who think he's an intellectual are the ones who don't know anything about what he's talking about, and assume he knows what he's talking about because of idiotic assumptions like "he went to Harvard so he must be a genius." He's the definition of psuedointellectual, somebody who sounds educated to the unintelligent while refusing to actually learn anything.
---
You wouldnt bring logs to jad because brews in those slots are way more hp. using logs for hp would pretty much never be worth it unless you had a magic or redwood tree to cut and rest by right next to a boss while waiting for it to spawn. And stams are better for energy, so this would only be used for f2p new players and maybe ironmen while questing.
---
 I like your stat restoring idea, it still wouldnt be efficient but could have more uses for high levels
---
I love my hydroflask. Unfortunately it doesn't fit in my car cup holders, but they sell "adapters" on Amazon for like $10 so I'll get around to ordering one of those someday. At least that's what I've been telling myself for the last two years.
---
Not sure I get your question
---
I only wish I'd had the patience to work towards a skill cape during the golden age of this game. 
---
Everyone would celebrate with you, you could capture the moment and share it with the other players... These days it's alot more likely you'll be celebrating that feat with nothing but a gang of bots who will never understand the grind of truly playing the game.
---
Yeah but this guy did it on accident.
---
Not with my no social interaction iron man.
---
The time has come, remove none bis memes!
---
Changing the colour of "Examine highlight (transparent)" in the "Chat Color" config should do the trick
---
This would be balanced so that the benefit of using it is never better than staminas/super energies. Bear in mind that the usefulness of this activity depends on your firemaking level/the logs you use and is really only handy for free-to-play users who don't have access to stams or super energy pots.
---
Have a bush in my yard that's real Grass like. Called it snaps grass thinking it was a legit thing lmao.

Awesome!

I always loved Barrows and everything about it, got back into OSRS about 4-5 months ago, was wondering if farming Barrows for armor, whether to sell or keep for yourself still a thing? Thank you!
---
Oh shit true
---
Ah that makes sense then
---
dragon heraldic please
---
I can definitely see your point. When I got my 99, I think it displayed it for everyone in the chat and everyone was so happy that I got 99. It was super cool to see random people celebrating an accomplishment for someone they never met, really felt like I had a little family when I achieved that milestone.
---
Go dilate
---
On it as we speak!
---
I like this idea or the one where people have to enter a bar in order to restore run energy faster, both seem valid.
---
Jordan Peterson is literally just an anti-SJW who says "postmodernist" instead of "SJW" and for some reason that makes people take him seriously. All of his political views or statements are him arguing against strawmen of crazy feminists, and he fails to engage with any leftist ideas in good faith. 
---
I don't think he believes women are inferior to men or whites are superior to blacks, but he actively argues against the examination of existing power structures, of concepts like patriarchy, and addressing inequality in society, and that's what makes him a bigot. Maybe "prejudiced" would be a less charged word. Or "reactionary". He sees uppity feminists arguing for more representation, more opportunity for career advancement etc., and he sides against it.
---
I didn't say anything about insta-buying
---
Even if you were, it would probably average of a loss of 1-2% insta buying over time - a small cost for the higher damage/etc output
---
I finally killed him! Only took like 4 more tries haha
---
tithe farm with the daily tree/fruit tree runs I would assume
---
Good on you man.
---
The whole issue here is if it is a problem for new players. It turns out that it actually turns off many new players so I would call that a problem. Failing to attract new players is a problem for the game as a whole. They're not just gonna give everyone free stamina pots but they're going to look at this and make some kind of small change.

Tbh now that I‚Äôm a bit better, it seems like I‚Äôm more of a burden when I THINK I‚Äôm a burden to people. GL to everyone struggling.

Completed mine last night, was good! Fight wasnt that hard actually

Omg that water makes me thirsty

I agree he is annoying on twitter but this is impressive, regardless ü§î
---
It was a pretty major event back then, not that it's any less of an accomplishment today of course. But I remember numerous times I was present when someone had finally earned their skill cape, everyone would congratulate them, they'd run off to collect it, and 5/10 minutes later they would return with it equipped to show off the emote to everyone for a bit. 
---
Its a shame that people achieving that milestone today won't be met with the same reception.

I'm AFK training in NMZ and keep getting logged out randomly after 5 minutes while still in combat. I watched as it happened to see what was going on and after exactly 5 minutes of not touching my mouse, while still in active combat (I was attacking and being attacked by 3 mobs), the game client logged me out. Why does this happen? What can I do to prevent this? I thought I was allowed to AFK in combat for up to 20 minutes but apparently this isn't true.
---
Edit: I know I'm still in combat too because the client won't let me log back in immediately. It says there's another session running and I have to wait another minute or so.
---
Your calculations are taking into different average gear setups, and that video goes into much more depth than what you said. Your just flat out wrong and that video will prove it dumb shit

Runelite resets unless you make a profile to save settings to.

Nah, don't worry about it. These days people are just happy to get a round started. 
---
Go as 2nd attacker and switch to 2nd healer around round 8. Then you'll probably only need two runs in total for both roles. 
---
For collector and defender, CB lvp matters even less.
---
No solos? :(
---
While I like and support this idea, as I was a fan of "resting", I feel like if you are playing the game efficiently enough to be hindered by run energy, you probably can afford a few doses of stamina/energy pots. Hopping to BH world/W30 and using spec pools is a high IQ play as well for a newer player. All I'm saying is there are ways around it for players that wish to be more efficient at a lower level.
---
Edit: also, dueling ring + clan wars portal.
---
This man definitely was offended by this.
---
bloomers definitely dont play runescape.
---
it's more of a doomer, broken bloomer type thing.

What? Early game has 10x the content and speed progression as late game lmao....
---
Even with max exp rates getting 93-94 attack will take 20x as long as a noob getting 34-35.

I love this update, but I don't understand this logic at all.....
---
Of course, I have nothing but respect for cops. They risk their lives to better ours and do not deserve the hate that people give. Thank you :D. If you ever wanna do some bossing or raids hit me up, I'm almost always down to raid/boss when I'm not working!

Another benefit: it encourages teamwork. If there‚Äôs already a fire up along your path, you sit by it and get chatting with the guy who lit it, and before you know it you‚Äôre killing cows in lumby together or whatever.
---
Is he the schizophrenic guy?
---
In terms of pressing buttons to kill monsters/move your character, nothing changed. Everything else did change, though. Basically imagine going from 2004 RS2, to current RS3, just without the combat changing. It's close to that large of a shift in terms of gameplay systems changing, just with less P2W (but still technically P2W elements that were added way later into the game's lifespan).
---
If you never played and are just looking at second-hand footage, I can totally see why they'd look extremely similar, but the overall flow and experience is basically a different genre at this point.
---
Only give her stuff if she‚Äôs a returning player. Otherwise just answer questions if she has them.
---
Maxed people are probably .01% of players. Wat a stupid fuckin comment
---
This seems like a solid solution, not sure if they'll do it. It kinda breaks energy/stamina pots.
---
Do you think you will ever release a piece of content again without being polled? Personally i think a non game changing quest would be a great surprise.

A friend of mine said he wishes he could just play OSRS single player. Freaking cracked me up.

---
Yeah.....
---
Oh alright sorry to come off as a dick. I'd recommend checking out wow classic when it's out. If you handle the osrs grind then it's not like it's any worse I mean if anything you'll only be out 15 bucks if you don't like it
---
You might have been able to telegrab them, but the gear will have despawned by now I guess :(
---
‰∏çÈîô
---
I know this is old, but did they break it since? I can't seem to get it to work.
---
Lmfao do you even understand what carpal tunnel is? You talk as if because u click a little bit u get carpal tunnel, do you have glass wrists? This sub makes it sound like 25% of the RS population are running around with carpal tunnel LOL. The game cant make assumptions about whether you have carpal tunnel or not, you choose how much you want to click and how much you dont want to click (except for content where u dont really have a choice like inferno unless you want to die, but fishing is no such thing) if you dont want carpal tunnel either fix your posture, do afk methods, dont play the game or go to the doctor. Plenty of fixes to your non problem. You can literally click less now for fishing than u would do with fish drop.
---
Now you're just saying things.
---
I can still hear that scream lol
---
I‚Äôm happy your happy about this, but man the time spent on this game for 99süòÇüòÇ
---
2190 total and quit my iron man after 2 months. I have never felt so personally attacked in my life.
---
Peterson wants nothing more than to address these issues with men. That's actually like one of his main teaching topics. He has multiple times cried while talking about how much he wants to see young men be honest, truthful and willing to do the right thing. He couldn't advocate any less for "toxic masculinity" or anything of the sort. It sounds to me like you would seriously be into his lectures. I'm not quite sure I am following the disconnect between what you believe and him.
---
He also isn't a conservative. He worked for the NDP party on Alberta growing up and is certainly more centrist than anything. He makes claims that we need the left as much as we need the right.
---
About sexuality. He thinks porn addiction is a serious issue (it is) and that men and women should abstain from sex outside of marriage (or at minimum a very serious relationship) because of how serious a sexual relationship is. He has addressed this many times. We as a society have trivialized sex, and now seeing the outcome, we are often just blaming men for it. We don't want to believe that we have made sex no big deal, sexualized everything, and now we wonder why shit has hit the fan?
---
I apologize, I'm at work and typing on my phone so my thoughts might not be as organized as they should be.
---
Edit: did you see the video of the guy who ran on stage to talk to Peterson? Who was having that break down? Peterson took the time to speak with him on stage and after the talk.
---
What did the left do? Call the hurting man a cultist. In my opinion from what I've seen, it's the left that's causing issues and not allowing us to address these issues in men.
---
Literally me, also can't PVP to save my life.
---
I just want ONE 99, after all these years just one 99 would allow me to quit for good
---
Wholeheartedly agree.
---
I usually just lurk around, but I gotta say, this is amazing! Great work
---
Sorry guys it takes a while to find the bots
---
You know you can basically just safe spot him.. right?
---
Not only reason, but it started his humanophobia
---
lmfao, i'd do it for free, at least for the dice bots at ge that LITERALLY all dress the same and spam the same thing.
---
it's not a solution for all bots, but for some it is.
---
Yeah I didn't include them in the picture. I stopped looting them when I had 110k fire runes.
---
no changes is more viable in wow because it gives them an opportunity to do BC/Wrath.
---
the thing i don't understand is the anti classic players say over and over again that classic is not a good game and its only nostalgia. i even read that shit on **this subreddit.** how can people play and enjoy osrs and think classic wow is going to flop lol
---
I mean tbf, I‚Äôm going to quit OSRS when classic comes out.
---
You want ez scape play rs3 ü¶Ä real talk though firemaking is kinda pointless on osrs so it would make it more useful.
---
That‚Äôs like 80% of this player base lol. Nightmare zone is so OP.
---
How much is your bank worth? A 4 dose stamina is like, 6k right now I wanna say (don't quote me)
---
1-2% loss is huge when you're constantly buying and selling 100m+ gear every task.
---
Okay then why does he talk like this about people who also want to address these issues, for men and for women? How is that helping the conversation?
---
Good thing they don't have good names and get those good names banned.
---
Did not know that, I haven't used Trident much as I haven't started Zulrah yet. Most of my """knowledge""" is based off of other people making bossing videos and I typically see either Imbued Heart or nothing. Magic potions make a ton of sense though, pretty much no reason not to bring them if you can spare the inven space
---
Pures ruin pvp, fuck them
---
Bracelet
---
‚ÄòI have a feeling‚Äô by the Black Eyed Peas is next on shuffle
---
Thanks!
---
Sounds like you need a CC.
---
leveling will be harder end game will be significantly easier.
---
1m loss to kill vorkath 150 times on task with a dhcb, worth it
---
How did you nail this so exactly? Also I feel personally attacked.
---
This feels scary accurate to my life lol
---
Right but that would be normal logs, it would get a bit faster with each tier
---
I swear this dude is baked off his ass most of the time.
---
Duradel 50 Slayer req? No?
---
And they have taken a path just as bad as the one that led to eoc.
---
How?
---
You're actually dense as hell. Anytime run energy is needed you use a stamina, and weight is fucking irrelevant.
---
he says on the osrs subreddit, the only mmo in the industry currently growing instead of bleeding players. 
---
edit: oh lol nice meme
---
just days after i start playing dark souls i see this
---
Duradel requires 50 slayer
---
Edit: He can start with Nieve tho
---
The PVPers today ARE the problem, so what they have to say means less than nothing.
---
Basically a glorified sleeping bag from classic then?
---
I'm in the middle of my dhcb rebuild right now and let me tell you it was so worth it.
---
I'd add something to barbarian training that lets you somehow light a log with an axe. Similar to how it currently is with bows, make it very slow so it isn't worth doing for training but worth it for run energy. 
---
Or maybe rework gnomish firefighters to be equippable and able to light any fire. Or a ring of flint that can do it... Lots of possibilities here.
---
Now I do agree that its wrong of JageX to lock a lot of content behind skilling so people feel forced to do more than what can be expected. But I dont think thats ever reason to make skilling easier, thats reason to lower requirements.
---
so was osrs yet here you are.
---
Yes, BUT I SURVIVED!
---
Okay stfu i did not get here to be personally attacked
---
Weigth is not gear bonuses anyway. Your argument is both irrelevant and you cant even word it properly. Actual degen.
---
even at the redwood 8x rate it's still worse than just walk+running at 1 agil
---
why are you trying to nerf numbers without doing any fucking math first
---
log into the real website and check, most of these emails are fake af
---
Free amazon prime 1 month trial works too.
---
Remember, do not attack anything with your 1def pure after this update. Changes in combat engine ^^
---
Seems about right for the sweaty ass neckbeard rs community.
---
GREEN BIRD EM'
---
&gt; See, its toxic cunts like you with their head too far up their own asses to understand simple things.
---
LOL? "toxic"? You must be pretty sensitive if you think im being toxic just because im pointing out you CLEARLY have absolutely no idea what youre talking about regarding PvP and have absolutely no experience with it on top of your own clear bias towards it. All im doing is pointing out what youre saying makes ZERO sense and is not accurate, sorry if you cant take that bud.
---
Pretty ironic youre going to call me a cunt AND claim ***IM*** the one who doesnt understand things. 
---
&gt; Years ago in original pre eoc RS people didnt need updates for pvp. The wildy was flooded with people killing each other no problem.
---
??????????
---
And what in the actual fuck does that have anything to do with today? Not to mention, there were plenty of things with PvP that could have still used fixing and things that people complained about back then as well. 
---
The wildy was flooded with people because there was MUCH, MUCH less to do in the game and the meta had yet to develop in PVP because it was still new and people were not as good. So there was actual incentive and it was exciting to go into the wilderness. There also werent super strong weapons and armor back then either which adds to the danger.
---
Trying to claim "oh well back then, no one NEEDED updates then so they dont need them literally **15 years later**" is probably one of the most illogical and stupid things Ive ever heard someone say about PvP. 
---
Lets turn that around so you can see how dumb that sounds: PvM and skilling dont need any of the updates theyve received in OSRS either, why on earth would they need new content or fixes? I mean...im not even sure of what else to say to logic that is so absurdly dumb and silly.
---
&gt; Fast forwars to now this modern mmo mentality of min maxing and all this other shit that doesnt work well in old games like rs is suddenly causing problems in the game.
---
The core problems to PvP have absolutely nothing to do with min/maxing. Pretty sure that has absolutely nothing to do with Magic Def being broken, or people scripting in PvP, or perm raggers/bot raggers, or the wilderness being completely dead (although it somewhat does). Min/maxing has nothing to do with the fact Jagex has done absolutely nothing for PvP for years etc. etc. There are tons of problems and things that need fixing in PvP, you claming there is nothing wrong is not only absurd but it shows you just dont know what youre talking about.
---
Like im sorry bro but you clearly have absolutely no idea what youre talking about, theres no other way to put it.
---
&gt; Now pvpers are bitching about this and that and whining for updates OG players never needed.
---
PvPers are complaining about fixing things that have desperately needed fixing for a LONG time, mechanics that were there back during the "OG" days too. Again, trying to use that line of logic is not only completely invalid but it means absolutely nothing and its absurdly silly to try and make some nonsensical excuse that "OG players never needed or wanted fixes/updates back in the day".
---
&gt; If PVP hasnt received proper attention, then riddle me this why was the wildy so full of people in the original but not now? Hmm? What is your brilliant take on it? If nothing has been updated there shouldnt be issues with it.
---
????? What? I genuinely have no idea what point youre trying to make here because it makes such little sense.
---
There have been such drastic and massive changes from the game in 2006 so trying to compare the two meta's/era's is completely irrelevant they were/are MUCH, MUCH different times. Your logic is that if PvP hasnt been updated in 15 years, while the rest of the game has drastically changed around it.....then PvP should have no issues?? You realize how completely idiotic that sounds right?
---
Virtually nothing youve said has been sensical or valid or showed you have any idea what youre talking about with PvP, its all been nonsensical, illogical and in some ways just completely wrong in every way possible so I have no clue why youre trying to talk about something in the game you clearly have such little experience and knowledge with.
---
At least 4. Maybe even 5.
---
That's just semantics. Adding on "classic-style" updates is making changes to it.
---
Yes please. Anything to make getting around in this game faster. Especially early levels when it takes like 10 goddamn minutes to recharge energy
---
The purpose of the account is to make it as difficult as possible though
---
I don't think you understand how painful it would be to try to buy items on a wolrd like that, especially since there would be so few people on there.
---
Cut across the wrist for attention, up the street to get the job done.
---
Is it harder to get banned nowadays? I know back in the day any cursing or derogatory speech was pretty likely to get you banned.
---
I see you caring at how others play but absolutely nothing about how you play.
---
i guess i should've used the super serious tag instead of humor.
---
Technically don't know if that's all you used
---
Current wow isn't bad for new players, it's actually pretty fun. There's a few big annoyances with how gear works now and how you obtain gear, but overall it's pretty good. I can definitely see why people don't like it, but it's definitely not a bad game.
---
You do solo to maximize rewards. get it down to like 10% so it does minimal damage and then fletch to 13k points. With 6 brews and 2-3 monk fish for the initial damage you'll take you have tons of inventory for logs and plenty of brews for the session.
---
Who the fk starts multiple quest at the same time lol
---
I was going to say, I‚Äôve walked away from quite a few Wyvern tasks with easily over 1M in profit after supplies.
---
Lol it was a complete nightmare, it felt like it would never end
---
I did the same thing when I started back when bonds were a bit cheaper tho sadly just to get some capital and it was the best thing I ever did
---
I've gotten "lol, nice bot" a couple times....
---
Is his account an ironman?
---
Definitely worth the 9 minutes.
---
You're a saint.  Thank you.
---
I'd settle for it going the other path, not getting any updates, stagnating and dying because of it. If only so I could point at it when I tell the existing anti-update players in osrs when I tell them to stfu.
---
So only sweaty nerds are allowed to decide what‚Äôs good for the game?
---
Depends on how afk you do it. I do ultra afk nmz while at work and get 75k an hour. High effort dharoks probably around 130k
---
Didn‚Äôt  rock cake after all i see.  I suppose it‚Äôs still neat anyway.
---
The ‚Äúmy laptop‚Äù brand laptop sometimes has issues but it‚Äôs really hard to diagnose them because they are all different.
---
Shut up dum dum lmao TBC was the best part of WoW hands down, my opinion is objective and yours is wrong!!!
---
How much longer till you can start playing the game?
---
Why was he originally down voted so often? I've always been curious how the hate started towards this dude. He doesn't write replies anymore though.
---
I find pures in general are "toxic"
---
Should've been polled, just got 99 fishing through barb and still support this

Exactly this. Account progression from low level pure, 20def, 30prosy, rune/zerker/void, then 60cap and 70cap mains.  Get your account unlocks on your own time

Why don't you at least learn how to take a screenshot before you start  trying to throw shade, kid.

Fuck that's me except I've never forgotten an email

Sounds like a bad laptop
---
Everything shift click? Lol?
---
you're right i should clipped my inventory too
---
i feel personally called out by this one.
---
Yes thank you I was wondering what that item was and where I could get it. Thought it was the Bonecrusher lol
---
I wonder how much karma he has from these 20 posts :0 anyway. Cba to do math and research.
---
Username is swem
---
They even have mages.
---
RIP.
---
Yeah I agree. I usually don't watch people's shit 15+ minute videos all the way through, but I watch every damn second of Swampman's vids.
---
Support but not with the HP regen
---
Minigame tele to clan wars rip
---
This is fucking cool. It would also be awesome if the ranks could pin a message or something for general announcements and such.
---
And here we have a pker in his natural habitat
---
Yeah I just started playing a month ago, both RS3 and OSRS, and my two main complaints of OSRS are the run energy and no tool belt. Other things I can live with but I‚Äôve spent much more time in RS3 because of those. I‚Äôm not saying they NEED to fix them if it‚Äôs not in the spirit of OSRS, but they‚Äôre such huge QoL updates that I love.
---
So true, that episode was chills and I watched that around 13.
---
Imagine buying bottled water
---
People deal with void well enough
---
Definitely a good idea, but giving firemaking a use is needed by now.
---
&gt;‚ÄúI bought full rune guthix because personally I think it looks the best‚Äù
---
jfc this has been me since 2006
---
they seem to be a temporary thing used for testing since they give access to any gear you wanted and max stats regardless of what your normal account is while you're logged into the world. if they were a permanent thing everyone would just play it instead of the normal game.
---
they're basically beta test worlds so who knows when the next one will be available.
---
thanks a lot, worked like a charm
---
Damn dude pretty neat idea
---
He had a holier than though attitude toward everything, and was literally incapable of saying anything nice, just belittled the accomplishments of others.
---
all 750+ crates btw
---
&gt;the fact that classic wow will never have any updates
---
That's not a fact. Ion said they might do some post naxx content updates. 
---
There's always the mount hyjal raid portal in vanilla along with the emerald dream portals behind the nightmare dragons. 
---
They even said they'll consider making a burning crusade server.
---
At first, yes. After a day, no way. I can have my client at the size I want, in the spot I want it. I can also continue to browse reddit or watch whatever while I play fullscreen games. I can also throw RS on the second monitor while I play other games.
---
It's not very effective
---
Can confirm
---
They also seems to have the habit of crashing into your kills, and yelling " hop my guy ".
---
about 800k/hr honestly not bad
---
No, and he gets a lot of donations from people so idk why the slayer seeds matter at all haha
---
Sweet I‚Äôll look into it!
---
Why does that matter though?
---
Point still stands. Most of the early boring slayer could be skipped
---
It's obvious that Jagex doesn't really want to combat the bots. Remember what happened last time they tried that?
---
Yh I played them a little, I doubt people wouldn't play the normal game because the whole point is progressing and getting items, having it handed to you is boring af
---
&gt; lmfao, i'd do it for free 
---
Do you have a job?
---
Also, some things disappear and some don't, no one knows why. Wiki says I lose them, but I keep everything when I die.
---
I like the idea, but disagree with your points on making agility f2p, I think that could work even better in tandem with your suggestion.
---
It wouldnt be fun because people are "efficient" very few players are efficient, its completely misunderstood. It would be boring because everyone are max combat, zero diversity in combat, and that makes pvp very boring (when its 1 to 1 at least) u could still do something interesting with castle wars.
---
farting guild unlocked
---
Same, I used to add people back in actual 2007 and so on.
---
Very petty. I'm none of this (I don't play RuneScape - hardly browse this sub)  and am rather fond of Peterson.
---
'Ultra-right-wing propaganda' is an exaggeration to the point of ridiculousness. Make fair criticisms if you want to be taken seriously.
---
TBC is definitely the peak, but I'd argue that overall player 'satisfaction' was likely higher in Vanilla than WotLK.
---
I'm just excited for a woox fires-only inferno
---
He's using a halberd
---
I‚Äôm not saying it needs to be added. Just that as a new player I enjoy how RS3 handles it much more. No need to waste inventory slots on gear and it lets you skill whatever you want at any time without having to visit a bank first (and as a new player I don‚Äôt have all banks memorized). Just trying to offer some insight of a new players experience.
---
Interesting idea, although to accommodate this they'd have to completely rework firemaking. There would have to be a different fire object for every type of log. Not impossible, but a pretty big change. How would you tell them apart? Different color logs under the fire?
---
Make a new skill call it Bard. Then you can learn different instruments that give you small buffs and people around you.
---
You can also play in taverns for money which will help out new players and it will allow a lot of people to socialize in one spot like the good ol days, now everyone is only ever at the GE
---
Some cool gear that's just for looks and maybe some quests to go along with the skill
---
Finally who doesn't want to get more osrs music.

Imagine running into a max combat killing cave slimes

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahashahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Anyone wanna be my Osrs buddy and help me out/progress with me?
---
Damn y u gotta make this
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. Retrieving pet after death is already there, you just have to insure it beforehand which i think is bullshit. Why not skip insuring yet making it retrievable all-together. Get it? I‚Äôm not adding a mechanic, I‚Äôm removing a bullshit one.

---
I play wow to raid so Im a bit biased toward expansions with good raiding. 
---
Wotlk fucking sucks outside of pvp and raiding but man the raids are so good it balances out all the shit stuff like emblem farming and RDF
---
Actual good reason with solid reasoning unlike the lumbridge rooftop course
---
I've had an RSI from playing runescape before. There are times when I think it makes a lot of sense to eliminate the need for certain actions. Lots of people with very sedentary lifestyles play this game a fuckload, the risk of injury is real. If done correctly the game can be made more ergonomic without sacrificing it's integrity; there's plenty of high effort content in the game that itsn't psychically strenuous such as high level PvM or skilling methods like swimming. 
---
I think shift-drop for example was a great change. Trying to power-drop items with a mouse was a nasty action, you have to rightclick, move down and left click over and over; and since you can drop any number of items in a tick you were incentivized to push yourself to do that as fast as possible. Most people already just used mousekeys / AHK. I don't think you should be forced to do that just to play reasonably efficiently. 
---
Buying items from shops is similarly nasty because you again want to click as fast as possible since there's no upper bound on what you can buy per tick. Mousekeys made it more tolerable, but stuff like buy-50 and generally reducing ironmen's dependence on hop-and-shop have seriously made the game experience less strenuous without (always) making it easier.
---
It is funny that people seem to want to call any kind of RSI carpal tunnel
---
Well, to be fair you need about half a million cannonballs at that. Imo, ramp up the cannons damage and reduce the exp. given so it helps completes tasks faster yet doesn't make exp training "overpowered"
---
i feel it spiritually
---
"Not sure" Proceeds to post a IG profile. Nice.
---
How? I disregard them and choose to spend my time in discussion with others who want to share ideas. Why spend my time or energy on someone set in their opinion when I can have fruitful discussion with someone with an open mind?
---
My point is: you're wasting your time telling them they're wrong even though you and I both know they're wrong. Ignore them and focus your discussion on the people who are also wanting to share ideas.
---
Except no zerk that actually pks gets 99 attack so it's dumb to look at it that way, or else you'd have to calc the 70 def build with 99 attack too and of course that makes it even more of a main
---
we know bro thats the point half of the time
---
Ok i am not sure but i think you are behind the twitch fake account scam.
---
This is the 8th episode of my one chunk at a time ironman series. Inspired by Pookaguy, I made my own account, with a few differences, the main one being that I choose my own chunks, trying to find the best path to unlock the entire map.
---
Sorry for posting this a second time - I had messed up in the title of the last one and wanted to make sure I had it right. If this is against the rules, let me know and I'll delete this, no problem. I don't want to annoy people by posting too much.
---
Yeah they are. If you look it up on YouTube there are a lot of videos exposing people and explaining what the scripts do. But basically, it‚Äôs just a script that is downloaded and it doesn‚Äôt fully auto pk for you, but it switches and uses specs for you. I can‚Äôt think of his name, but there was recently a streamer who was plastered on here that blatantly used scripts and streamed himself using them
---
Maybe a kind of "Blessed" log that recovers run energy at a low rate and prayer at a decent rate. 20-25% prayer per log over time?
---
Most pkers are mid level looking to kill the squishier low level accounts, higher level accounts wont bother since karils/armadyl or even black dhide offers pretty good mage defence, too much to KO, and the main KO methods are range and melee, which the dihns offers such high defence against its just a waste of spec most of the time
---
Can we have a report all bots you see day?
---
What a chad
---
Musicians was one of the greatest updates to the game in my opinion. Maybe it was too excessive to the point that agility was made largely useless in terms of run energy replenishing, but the idea was spot on. I think run energy in general is bad design, anything that makes it obvious that you're moving around at a less than ideal rate is always frustrating.
---
Depression is literally a chemical imbalance.  You're comment is entirely misguided and not helping anyone.
---
WotLK raids were definitely good but a little too puggable for my taste. Imo wrath was the beginning of the end for WoW. It's clear they chose to start focusing solely on the casual player who cried for 5 years because they can't get purples.
---
Same thing happened to my ironman during the fight arena quest. I was running towards the door after i killed the first 3 bosses, the last guy 2 hits me and i die. Couldnt go back in because quest was considered complete, lost all my money and quit the acc lol
---
I love this comment.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. A lot of players seem to be stuck in this mindset of "If I could deal with it when I was 10 I don't see why we should go changing it now." But that mentality is extremely detrimental to the new player experience, which will only damage the health of the game in the long run.
---
damm congrats keep at it2
---
For the record I was the passenger btw
---
I had a rs gf that would pretend to have sex with me in game. She would use the ‚Äúheadbang‚Äù emote, then say ‚Äúoh yeah baby‚Äù. I kept giving her all the money i had lol
---
Fuckin gotem, well played
---
if you didn't pick up the ess and gold bars you would stil have over 40 Mil. I don't know if its worth it picking them up.
---
Isn't Runelite and other 3rd party clients a slipperier slope than this or shift dropping?
---
FOR REAL BRO. I used to get very tired of sharing my small(ish) laptop screen with RuneScape and other things, now I can have my full screen for whatever I'm watching/doing and have OSRS in my lap doing some afk shit like WC, mining, fishing, etc
---
This has more of a mobile main player feel tbh.
---
I get your frustration - people are very quick to jump to conclusions about Peterson - but maybe try a less forceful response next time. That way people might consider our views. Thanks.
---
Wait, y'all complete your quests?
---
A) Don't have high hp and eat cake.  
---
B) Use wines.
---
you almost always gain more run energy than you lose while running a rooftop course. if there is drain, it's incredibly slow.
---
He does. If by safe spot, you mean flinch spot.
---
That's not how that works? There are 2^31 negative numbers and 2^31 - 1 positive numbers (the leftover is 0, which is neither negative nor positive). 2^31 + (2^31 - 1) + 1 = 2^(32), which is how many values can be represented by a 32-bit number regardless of interpretation.
---
Half of 2^32 is 2^(31), not 2^(16). =p
---
65535 is representable with a signed 32-bit int but so is 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647. So there's no good reason for it to cap at 2^16 - 1 = 65535.
---
This would be cool. Definitely needs to happen.
---
Bruh don't you feel proud knowing you're slightly cheaper to pay than a robot is to build and maintain????
---
at 2s in ''we have shift click'' .... Im not sure but I think shift clicking an inventory is 100x more strain on your wrist than AHK 123'ing.
---
Was at a time where I had all the Amylase from Agility and Super Combats had pretty much just came out so they were profiting
---
Nope, but that wouldn't be a bad idea... I'll run that by the other mods.
---
Well it's either a bug or you're still doing something wrong. You might wanna file a bug report or tweet to a member of Jagex staff.
---
I‚Äôve always thought that‚Äôs what obby capes were
---
It‚Äôs better to just do vorkath
---
they already said that the armor and weapons would not come near raid gear. so its not new for a majority of the game.  Money making?  They said the skill was suppose to be a gold sink.  Did you actually watch any of the videos or read any of blogs and posts they made concerning warding?  Warding is suppose to be another 300-400 hour long 99 grind that is suppose to help remove gold from the game, that is not healthy for the game.
---
Sorry if I was unclear on this point - yes I agree most of the time medication will help, but not all of the time. And there are times where meds can be more harm than help. This is something that needs to be thoroughly discussed with a doctor and carefully monitored until you find what works for you.

Why not just runespan lul

---
Out of all the slayer boss pets, this is the one I hope I actually get by the time I get 99.
---
&gt;What changes should be made to broaden the availability of optimal builds/create new builds?
---
I'm not sure about others, but I might would start pking again if the magic skill would get some variety.
---
&gt;What are your biggest complaints about PVP? 
---
Lack of risk. Too many people using stuff like xerician robes in deep wildy. Too many people risking d hide chaps and msbs in bh/pvp worlds. 
---
&gt;What did jagex get right re: PVP?
---
Giving some variety to melee and range, Pvp worlds, hotsplots like black chins. (If those areas are still active, havent been online in quite a  while)
---
&gt;What changes could be made to allow these skills to be primary account features?
---
I do not see this as being feasible, especially for defense which is already incredibly strong. Many just prefers a lower cb lvl. 
---
&gt;. What can be implemented into the game to expand PVP areas, incentivize play, and most importantly TEACH, in a risk free environment, HOW to play osrs pvp? 
---
Incentive is the largest issue as the majority of the player base simply doesn't want to PvP and there's not much that coudl be done about that.
---
Someone took me to brimhaven and asked me to kill a tribesman. Those motherfuckers poison hard af. Had no idea how to get back.
---
I really like these ideas man
---
&gt; A 99attack/1str build should be at least AS viable as the 1attack/99str builds that already exist.
---
But why? There are so many more important issues with PvP right now. My point is that there's enough builds and adding more just adds more issues. In addition, I feel most non-PvPers don't want to create a new account just to have viable PvP stats. It's too much of a time investment and doesn't attract more people to PvP.
---
&gt; it would revitalize the scene by providing players an introduction to PVP when they otherwise may never have ventured to try it in the first place
---
We already have 'introduction to PvP' mini-games in the form of Castle Wars, LMS, and the Duel Arena. On top of these we get the tournament world with *unlimited* supplies &amp; builds every few months.
---
I don't think adding a permanent 'PvP-only' tournament world would really improve PvP activity much. I feel like most non-PvPers are concerned with efficiency &amp; fun - in that order. The reason rev caves were so active is because it was the most efficient money maker for a while.
---
&gt; The core mechanic of PVP in the game should be inviting and accessable to all.
---
Agreed but getting there is a struggle for Jagex.
---
&gt; ideas for 3rd party PVP matchmaking and competition
---
This already exists in these small PvP communities (e.g. sharkbrew). Automated tools to do matchmaking are not useful because the community is too small and won't participate. You would need to drop thousands of dollars in prizes for me to believe anyone would adopt a 3rd party matchmaking tool. Jagex would need to implement this sort of match making in-game and then reward participation and rankings.
---
Anything stupid

it starts at wave 50 but at the end it shows the completion time. Also, he streamed the whole thing earlier today.

517 kc and 518 kc. Hello?

idk, last i checked 518 comes after 517
---
You are quite literally the dumbest and most ignorant fuckhead I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit. Open up google and do some fucking research before you spout cancerous bullshit out of your illiterate mouth. People like you are the problem with mental healthcare you ignorant town idiot. It‚Äôs a chemical problem in your brain, it doesn‚Äôt compare to being late to work. We‚Äôre in the era of information yet you somehow defy thousands of years of progress to spout nonsensical bullshit out of your mouth. It baffles me how people are a google search away from understanding topics and conversations, yet their ignorance and stupidity is so god damn overwhelming they can‚Äôt even bother reading more than a sentence. You come with these god awful statements about depression, with absolutely no understanding on how depression works or even what it is, statements that are so blatantly disingenuous about an issue that severely affects the entire world.
---
Go fuck yourself

That's such bullshit, when has he ever made claims of racial superiority? Every time the alt-right is mentioned he denounces it. And you can't soften the definition to fit him in because as far as most people are concerned alt-right and far-right are the same and the far-right are fascist racists.

&gt;does catching fish only to release them back into the same place and catch them AGAIN make sense to you?

Disagree, the art team has more tools and more experience now. Why make things look bad just because original models looked bad? Characters models don't even have fingers so how low do we want to set the bar here?

Is there a good hc Ironman start to Max guide?  To my understanding it's still do quests but now there's fossil island, foreigner continent, wildy Slayer for emblems I think, etc.  Apart from sweaty B0aty 3 tick Barb fishing and Swampletics using lamps for Hunter I'm not super sure of a semi optimal route.
---
Did you not just read the previous comment, I was joking
---
Ah I see. Makes sense. Also, it was fun PCing with you a while back which I'm sure you don't remember everyone you chatted with doing it but it was like meeting a local celebrity.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone did
---
Fishing has so many methods that are afk, eels, monks, anglers, etc that are extremely close to a bank. The thing is barb fishing is pretty damn OP considering you get str and agility exp, on top of that you can already cut the fish for bait so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs any different. I‚Äôm all for QoL updates but fishing literally can‚Äôt be any more convenient or easy.. cut them up or bank them? Barb fishing is already good enough with exp and cutting the fish.

You can bring a stack of alchable items. I use alchmate.com and go to the stable pricing.  That way you can do something while waiting for the wine to drop. Tbh I made my first bond F2P the rest p2p. That first but of time sucked. A YouTube person did a spot where he was gonna make it to a bond on F2P gave up, and help up a sign next to the street asking money for runescape membership. 20 minutes he got $20. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest begging irl or in game. But you gotta think what 11 is for you.
---
Scimitar will always be better
---
The email address I keep getting the emails sent to are from accounts made way back when OSRS first released that I have not used and also no longer have access to. The emails sure are a pain, but not much I can do about it now.  I have a separate, secure email for my actual account.
---
I make a lot of suggestions and I want them to be seen so I try to put a fair amount of Photoshop time into them. I rushed this one and it still took me about an hour and a half to get it right, but I was adding stuff as I went (didn't plan it out prior). 
---
The background image comes from the Wiki (it was/is the Old School Runescape website background?). I repeat it to make it as long as I need to. The font is Runescape UF (you can DL this with a quick google search). Otherwise I'm just using the photoshop skills I've picked up over the years.

wasn‚Äôt it free magic xp? Could be an okay method for those who can‚Äôt afford tunes, namely f2p, to train magic while enjoying them self
---
Yikes
---
D scim is going to be better unless you are fighting something weak to stab, like dragons, then drag short sword
---
Even with 99 hp i don't find a problem with it. Wines cost next to nothing and the xp/profit far outweighs needed to drink 2-4wines a game imo
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed
---
Scimitar and shortsword are comparable, longsword is worse because it's slower. If you've already got scim, just keep using it.
---
Call sir Pugger
---
He was there. Or so I think it was him. He was beside himself. Not sure what his maulers name is
---
A new player (presumably not a member) can't do that. Side note; They also wouldn't know to do that because it's never declared ANYWHERE in-game that agility makes run energy last longer. 
---
However, I don't think making an iconic members skill free-to-play is the way to solve the issue. I'd prefer if Firemaking became the agility alternative for free to play, given it has hardly any uses at all there (no Wintertodt, no light sources, no infernal tools, nothing).
