I mean the reason runescape takes so much skill is fighting the terrible interface. (terrible meaning it's hard to get anything done, which is the point of an interface)

---
If you had like a wow action bar control scheme it still would be challenging but less so.

---
Person: something stupid
---
Someone else: that's fucking stupid
---
Person: bruh I'm just kidding
---
None of this is a real reply to my comment. 
---
Yeah, there are more PvMers and skillers and non-pkers in game nowadays. 
---
That doesn't change the meat of my comment, which you ignored.
---
Thats pretty cool. More stuff than I knew it was used for. Ty for answering.
---
No one is forced into the wilderness lmao. If you don't want danger don't go in or don't risk.
---
using a client that tells you where to stand and everything? OK
---
Thank you, u/yellow-boxes very cool
---
sir this is wendy's
---
The thing is it's *your* fault if you get skulled... Unless it's through the auto-retaliate bug, fine. But don't complain if you click on someone and get skulled...
---
A bulwark and black dhide is four slots.
---
This is really good advice. Even when I'm taking a break from OSRS, i browse this sub because its just so over the top and entertaining. 
---
Small nerf to an end game item most of us probably never even used: OMG WTF?!?!
---
i love being toxic when i pk and i love being toxic to pkers when i escape at callisto/vene/vetion
---
Please keep you right and left politics out of it this is a video game. Also don't assume that most gamers are for alt right it has no place in this community. Calling some one a racist is not and argument grow up and stick to the argument at hand thanks.
---
Don't fucking attack them then.
---
No it shouldn‚Äôt because you just admitted it‚Äôs an overpowered item that has been causing problems for years. Integrity changes don‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt get polled because they will never pass they tried this before.
---
It should break and drop 1m coins and cost 1m to fix.
---
Definitely sus
---
It really seems to like you, though...
---
I wonder if RS code could pull off an item that has like scaling defense based on # of attackers but terrible defense otherwise
---
um no, 1m is not worth my time at all.  Peanuts.
---
You mean people would rather watch fast paced high intensity gameplay instead of grinding out skills for questing? I'm shocked.
---
No. We just cuddle
---
Dude it's not a fuckin lifestyle or something, it's just not leveling def. Basically all the quests and reqs and stats and shit you need for 1def, you will eventually need for 45def aswell. A quested 1def pure is basically just halfway to being a zerker.
---
‚ÄòPurely stack defense‚Äô doesn‚Äôt = bulwark + fucking black d hide
---
Luckily I work down the street from the company so I can pitch your idea.
---
Yes they should have a reasonable ability to escape. 9 out of 10 times is not reasonable. It should be lower considering the pvmer has bulwark, it is in singles, and the pker has some risk.
---
Just get all your little clan buddies and go get some guy in Dinhs while he‚Äôs training prayer in multi. Then you guys can suck each other off for the black d‚Äôhide chaps he was wearing and complain about them being too cheap and op despite the fact that you‚Äôre wearing cheap and effective robes! Awesome dude!!
---
NOBODY who is legitimately good at pking uses fucking salad robes
---
The fact that it can freeze you in place for 20 seconds or prevent you from teleporting means it *should* have a lower accuracy. Those are really powerful things to do
---
It'd be cool if different spells could have different accuracy values. Pure damage spells could have a high chance to hit while teleblocks and freezes could be tougher to land
---
It's dropped from a raids with the same rarity as the best mage armor in the game, and is one of the best shields in the game.  The fact that its valued at only 6 mil should signify that it does not require a nerf.
---
No, this is ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äjagexü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
People don‚Äôt consider that Dinh‚Äôs is raid tier gear (which should mean it is very powerful), no they just see ‚Äúless than 10m on GE, it shouldn‚Äôt be that strong!‚Äù
---
I don't really feel like this type of content and roles belong in osrs at this point and the bulwark should have never been added imo. If we did get an update like this, it would have to come with a lot of changes and a ton of discussion
---
Make it wieldable.
---
They are prison tats
---
Would hardly call it "new". You guys post this shit every day.
---
https://youtu.be/-15VC4Yxzys
---
well yeah? the vast majority of this playerbase arent people with 2-4  accounts who make pures/alts to gold farm?
---
fucking casuals and their fucking enjoyment of the game.. need to watch more kill montages and austitic flexes of skill tricking ppl for rsgp lol
---
Man there‚Äôs no point in arguing. PvMers make a bigger majority and one day the wildy or PvP will be removed once again, then they‚Äôll complain about how the game died
---
You could. Adamant is sold at some shops like full helm at barb village I think. Rune is sold at desert and guild south of varrock
---
Nice gains bro!
---
What app is that? It looks good
---
I've got 200kc Zulrah (no rare yet) and 350kc Vorkath, both are good money makers. Zulrah is a lot harder to learn, but faster and easier once you do manage to learn it. I alternate between the two if I get bored of one, but Vorkath is definitely easier to learn and better money
---
Truth is the player base is a hivemind.
---
If there was going to be a bone whip attachment I'd assume it'd be the Hydra tail as that's what was being considered before

Linking to facebook from reddit, you are a sick man
---
"You are not entitled to have a good chance of not dying if you invest in it"
---
How deluded is that? 
---
YOU are not entitled to get the kill. YOU getting the kill is at the expense of another player. Me living doesn't drop your shit.
---
In every fucking scenario you all describe a dude in black dhide being incincible risking nothing. THEN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ATTACKING THEM? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN
---
Jesus Christ pkers are so retarded.
---
The purpose of doing mlm for 20 hours was to get my xp boost. How does that defeat the purpose?
---
Bet, will do thanks for the advice
---
[removed]
---
I hope jagex reads this and realise competitive castle wars comp is exactly what the community needs
---
Their vocabulary pretty much ends at "sit kid"
---
Are you serious? The whole point of the wild is that it's risky. If you're invincible in the wild that defeats every purpose of the wild.
---
i remember doing clan events back in the day, just us noobs, goingbossing for our first time. high and low leveled players all around 10 ppl killing bandos for 4h to end with like 500k loot at the end. good old times.
---
Sometimes you just have to remember you play this game for fun, not the xp.
---
You can buy adamant and rune stuff from some shops. Dragon is tricky because you need them as drops.
---
There is a 0% chance of you dying in singles with a bulwark. A bulwark is cheap as fuck and you don‚Äôt even risk it, stop calling it an investment. I don‚Äôt even PK I‚Äôm just not a complete fucking retard like yourself.
---
Here's the solution that'll make everyone happy. The Dinhs bulwark is fine for the skills and content it is locked behind in order to obtain it when relating it to its bonuses. The real problem is the price that PvPers are really bitching about. So here's what we have to do.
---
Step 1.
---
Push the bulwark lower on the CoX drop table (to where elder maul, tbow, and Kodak are at). That will decrease the rate of supply of bulwarks in the game, which will raise the longterm price if the bulwark.
---
Step 2.
---
Make more PvM opportunities to use the bulwark, because it's only use is niche PvP situations, which gives it a low demand, which is why its price is low. By making more opportunities to use it, which will increase the demand for it, which will increase the price. This could be in the form of new bosses or another raids where equipping the bulwark severely lowers damage of a special attack similar to a dfs to dragon fire. 
---
This may not entirely fix it or raise the price by that much, but it will be a step in a direction to fix problems that everyone (PvPers and PvMers alike) are bitching about the bulwark.
---
Since when has range ever lost to melee? Literally never.
---
Agreed bro. Shits super annoying to see. Can‚Äôt wait til it dies down.
---
thank you!
---
I wish they would allow me to remove the graceful blessing off my graceful gear and put it onto some other zero stat gear of my choosing. Let me boil my graceful hood down into a special soup I can dunk my aviator hat into.
---
I've been doing black chins since the update testing dinhs. Still busted. I have enough time to shit talk a trip brridder in ahrims and karils with like 15 Sara's left. 
---
Its too easy to survive the pking brainlets.
---
so funny hhaaha LOL

there was absolutely nothing humerous about /u/kingdom9999's comment.  just plain hating and stupid.

Also bottled water has to be bought prepackaged as opposed to fountain drinks which are bought as massive syrup bags and poured on-site.
---
Non-bottled water is almost always free.
---
Is there anything in runescape that says gnomes aren‚Äôt gay?
---
Shit. First reddit post. This is not a good look for me.
---
I laughed more than I should‚Äôve, this is great
---
Half an hour each month, better off hopping crafting store for 5mins and get like 2-3k thread.
---
Thanks for keeping the game free for me I guess
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
I might be a bit late, but if you're going to lower the chaos elemental's respawn time can you set it to 30 seconds rather than a minute? every other boss in the wilderness has a respawn timer of 30 seconds, it'd be weird for chaos ele to be more than that.
---
you read someone's math on a Reddit comment 1 hour ago that shows 50% accuracy against 15k dhides and a bulwark using mage mage.  congratulations?
---
&gt; &gt; yeah but i wanna do it in the wild
---
There's a difference between "wanting" to do the wildy content and Jagex putting some of the best xp and/or gp methods in the wild, "forcing" people that otherwise wouldn't go there. Causing even more anger towards PKers from said people. 
---
See: Black chins, Chaos altar, all the fucking wine spawns, wilderness slayer, revs etc etc etc
---
Also other question, should i use pearl bolts (E) over diamond bolts (E)?
---
Anyone who puts a word count in their essay title lmaoo
---
There was a whole to-do last week over Jagex "partnering" with other companies to introduce timed exclusives. Its all the sub talked about last week. 10s summary:
---
Jagex makes a poll basically asking "Hey, how does everyone feel about cosmetics? Do you want more house cosmetics like a mortanyia or elves theme?" And then you go on the blog and its like "Hey, we want more money, so these themes are going to be locked behind promotions with partner companies like Twitch. Go vote yes". People flipped their shit. Jagex fixed the poll to reflect that it would be 'partnered' content or something like that. Poll got voted down so hard Jagex ended it early. They then wrote a passive aggressive blog about how much they wanted this but are gracing us by listening to the polls.
---
That‚Äôs awesome, are there still cw clan chats
---
That doesn't change the fact your logic is flawed. You're trying to make an asymmetrical situation equal. Should you have a 50/50 shot of killing someone with equal gear as you if they're one tile away from you not being able to attack them? How about when they have a teleport? Saying you should have a 50/50 chance of killing someone who has equal gear is just laughable, especially when you take into account whether or not you're actually GOOD at pking. There's so many variables that you're just ignoring.
---
Rip :(
---
Thanks! I did like it!
---
How is this a problem? Putting a Bulwark on means the pkers' target has zero chance in fighting back versus equipping a weapon and fighting back.
---
With nmz points you can imbue berserker, archer, and seers rings as well as slayer helm. Gives a lot of damage bonuses.
---
Strong resemblance to Evil Dave.

Lol, this game sure is home to some special snowflakes

The purpose of doing whatever mlm is, is to acquire the outfit that gives the xp boost, not for just the ability to obtain an xp boost. The clothes gives the xp boost not the activity. If ppl don't like how they look with the outfit, then the solution is really simple, just don't wear it!

Hey brother I‚Äôm also a Mobile only Ironman, I just learned CoX last night and got my first kc in a duo, if you need any tips or help feel free to message me, I have a pretty decent grasp on all the mechanics on mobile.
---
Yeah my bad. Definitely meant less afk, misread it
---
What a sick cunt
---
Do you have a lot? Or at least a decent amount? Could two people reliably take someone with a DB out?
---
Yeah its pretty dumb. But just bring a clue box if you're bringing more than 4 items and you'll never lose a clue again
---
I dont even PvP but I know if you go into the wild, you're fair game
---
"I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy," the future president said. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, **and many of them are on the younger side.** No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life." - Donald Trump about Epstein
---
Unless you want to be extremely charitable, he fucking knew lmao
---
Thanks :D
---
Wait you bring 3 items you expect to lose and are mad when you get skull tricked and lose them?
---
My argument is that it shouldn‚Äôt make 25m+ of magic gear reduced to a near 50-50 chance of 94 level spell hitting when supplemented by 9k in additional gear.....
---
So, if you want to talk about good faith, you should first attempt it yourself.
---
Fix singles, skull tricking, and disallow bulwark in pvp. Everyone wins apart from singles clans and skull truckers.
---
Why should all content be in safe zones? If you're not willing to go in the wilderness to get the item you don't get the item, I don't care if you want it. I don't see you guys complain about the Mage Arena, Chaos Elemental or the KBD being in the wilderness.
---
Yeah, its just frustrating seeing all these enlightened pkers come on and tell us why we're all stupid when they are literally only looking the the symptoms and not the root cause. If the Dihn's was actually a half-way decent raid item it would be 100m. But it sucks ass everywhere but wildy and its getting fucking nerfed for people to kill chinners. Great job jagex, good priorities.
---
Also Pkers go back to twitter.
---
the outlaws next to the ge give severely reduced xp (1/10 normal i think?) Anything else will give the normal amount of xp
---
No problem man, but honestly, I really don't think the current polarisation between pvp'ers and pvm'ers is healthy for anyone, especially not for the future of the wilderness. These rejuvation attempts are not doing any good to the polarasition we see lately. I don't think Jagex can't keep getting away with forcing wildy updates by labeling them 'integrity changes', so it's in the interest of all pvp'ers to try to understand the viewpoint of the pvm community instead of just calling them scared. There's clearly some unbalance that has to be fixed imo.
---
Resetting at wave 1
---
To add to your point, it also works on charter ships without talking to the charter crew. You just choose "Charter" select the map location and get the halved price.

*HORSE WHINNY*

Lol the pvmer circle jerk is real. 60 downvotes from a genuine response.
---
Sey
---
\-pvmers are not going to fight back most of the time anyway, the shield just happens to play into that.
---
\-people who are hunting pvmers will not bring 40m in gear because it will be lost to a meta pvper
---
\-it obviously depends where someone is attacked, but 30% is a extremely low number, thats the entire point of a nerf. The shield allows people to not participate in pvp, they can click shark and walk all the way to edge while having a skilled/geared pker on them the whole way, this is not the spirit of the wilderness.
---
How is nerfing Bulwark discouraging new people from trying to pk lol. Using Bulwark in wildy is the opposite of pvping.
---
The item is completely useless. At least rework it instead of just throwing it in the shitter.
---
top left not pointing his toes inwards like everyone else triggers me slightly
---
&gt;he doesn't know about OSG
---
lmao
---
It's just a photo op, nothing will change
---
Price is determined by the players (and merch clans). We as a collective of players decide the worth of an item.
---
Just because a pker thinks an item is underpriced doesn't mean it is. And just because a pvmer thinks an item is overpriced didn't mean it is.

Literally never been attacked by a pker at wildy bosses with robes above mystics. In hundreds of kills and dozens of pkers.
---
Wasn‚Äôt about the magic negative for me, but rather gear you‚Äôd likely run into someone risking in a deep wild set up, lol.
---
i think they should just let you do it for free at any time.
---
bring some surprise back to pking, not knowing exactly what the other player could do was part of the fun.
---
Same as regular drops. You have to get the drop to roll for the pet.
---
Don't know why you're directing that at me lmao I don't even PK anymore.
---
i think it was whenever they mentioned something about changing the music at the farming guild. I'd have to go search for it but it was within the past 2 months i think
---
I'm curious, how does this "worry" you, as an option? Literally the only case this has an affect is people trying to scam you with multiple accounts into attacking them.
---
I don't see any sort of functional difference between this and a trade confirm screen or the wilderness ditch.
---
It's useless in pvm, yes, but quite the contrary in pvp where it's completely overpowered for the price/risk.  I've no problem with them reworking it to be useful in pvm but the nerf is needed for pvp until they come up with something else.
---
Welcome all RS3 refugees.
---
Wow a yang ganger / tulcel who is a racist conservative, never heard that one before
---
and scamming is you accepting the trade, what's your point?
---
This is so cool
---
Haven't played since jan 2017. 2240+ total. Completely empty bank.
---
Good ways for start-up gold? Wrath runes still decent gp? Any significant updates?
---
Pmods could report bots more actively but Jagex's selection of pmods is actually shit tier. They piss around in the GE without muting doublers and use uwu speak and ignore you if you try and speak to them. Remove all pmods and start new. Find people who have high total, no toxicity, and have homeworlds they can control.
---
I agree, but I'm sure there would have to be some kind of payment for them to implement such a mechanic, as trivial as that would be.
---
250k could be good, I threw 500k-1m as a ballpark range, though 250k might be getting close to the minimum.
---
This is kinda eh. The company mentioned in the article doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúUS Platinum Fortune‚Äù does not exist so it‚Äôs either a translation error or total bullshit.
---
those people are at edge border in bh world because then they actually earn something from pking
---
&gt; take away the one item that makes people go there and risk bank.
---
NO one risks a dinh's and dinh's isn't worth shit.
---
Underpowered my ass. Aoe Freeze, damage overtime, aoe heal in 1 spell book man. If you make it where magic is hitting in line with the other combat options it would be severely broken and in my opinion could only be addressed through altering the ancient spellbook in correction.
---
Because you never trick them with something that would work irl, but some stupid game mechanic that could easily be changed to make it not happen.
---
I saw ‚ÄúUS Platinum Fortune‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
That game can be infuriating at times.
---
[This](https://youtu.be/2ar3NwhcCms) is why I'll never play xcom on ironman.
---
Except ur noted bones ahahaha
---
No one risks a Dinh‚Äôs but people risk noted bones while they‚Äôre wearing a Dinh‚Äôs.
---
wilderness and skulling wasn't made for skulltricking, just like trading wasn't made for scamming.
---
Awesome are you a rs veteran?
---
Thank you so much. Appreciate the explanation.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre very likely right, still interested to see how people would feel about this as a fix
---
I'm not encouraging it. It's just easily avoidable. Not like skull trickers are breaking into your house and skulling for you... Don't try to fight back if you don't know what you're doing, and turn attack options off.
---
I'd be interested in hearing someone in the industry's opinion on all of this
---
They supposedly have a staffer who scans for emails like this. I'm on mobile ATM but Google suicide site:reddit.com/r/2007scape
---
There was a jmod who explained what to do in your situation a few weeks back.
---
I think thats the only real way though. Any attack options tweaking wouldn't work and im sure that would cause lots of bugs.
---
I think they at least need to acknowledge that PvPers are using 30k worth of gear expecting to hit through a Dinh‚Äôs which is a raids one item.
---
I‚Äôve no problem with a rework but this is an unpolled nerf which only torpedoes the price.
---
Lame AF bulwurk was already worthless now thw price will tank more...
---
No
---
Yeah, that's the part I don't get. I've googled "US Platinum Fortune" a number of times since this news first came out. Nothing ever comes up. I've also tried just "Platinum Equity", but also don't get anything.
---
And when you search "US Platinum Equity Jagex" a bunch of articles like these pop-up...but nothing about the company itself.
---
Never even seen pkers complain about it. When pkers bring bank gear they also bring a dihs a lot of the times anyways. I wish this community wasn‚Äôt so toxic.
---
and why's that?
---
Lol gl pking like that and distinguishing every I,l, and 1 instantly.
---
Bro that's amazing, you've progressed fast! I can't wait to have the gear to be ready for CoX. I'll definitely message you when the time comes for Raids (:
---
Scalable inventory and chat boxes would also be fantastic. Playing on a high resolution monitor is almost impossible due to the small item icons.
---
This is a great solution and would be much more welcomed by both sides than the current update.
---
The real item that needs a nerf is black dhide. It should not give the same defensive bonuses as the tier70 variant while costing virtually nothing. 
---
Maybe something similar with black dhide can be done to what they are suggesting with maul. Add a 100k gp component to your black dhide to give it it's current stats. Wouldn't effect pvm and it would actually add incentive to killing the ridiculous rag range and tank hide meta.
---
And what if you're resetting wave 1 because someone else left your team?
---
No, you can be in max or close to max and not hit shit on someone with a bullwark and 0 risk because they protect it.  It's not people in 30k gear only.
---
Devalues my 55 crafting
---
From the few streams I've seen him, hes the type who has a lot of dumb ideas that inspire others to have their own ideas. We need more of this
---
why would someone bring an item that's still partially risked &amp; doesn't offer anything offensively?
---
I like where your head is at but it was way to OP in singles. I dont really get why people are so mad, it is barely being nerfed
---
What do you mean it's not just a song???
---
Unskull pking aka self defence? What the fuck lol.
---
Simpler days
---
I don't think Reddit was never intended for real discussions despite what the founders say, everything about it is against that. We have single reply chains so you can only address one person at a time, easy to attack someone against the hivemind when 7000 people reply that they are wrong but they have no way of defending themselves/their opinion without copy pasting 7000 times. Upvote system brings popular posts to sit at the top of the page for an extended time while unpopular ones never see the light of day. Up/Downvote system that is analogous to thumps up/down and like/dislike systems in other social media platforms, obviously the userbase is going to use it the same way and the founders, if genuine when writing the redditqutte, were frankly idiots for thinking that would work as intended. This is the circle jerking, closed minded, self righteous persons dream platform.
---
Exactly for the reasons you described.  Even back in the day there was highscores.
---
\&gt;My argument is that it shouldn‚Äôt make 25m+ of magic gear reduced to a near 50-50 chance of 94 level spell hitting when supplemented by 9k in additional gear.....
---
Why not?  In near max melee/mage gear my chance to hit many of the high defense bosses is literally less than that.  50% to fucking prevent a bwana from moving away when that's their only desire is fucking amazing.  Speaking of good faith, are you pretending like the cost of dinh's actually matters?  It's gonna be one of 4 protected items anyway.   It could be 40 mil, it's still the same risk.
---
Honestly its not pvmers voting out of spite. Its the fact that in order to skill in the wildy its needed due to clans showing up in rag gear and all good wildy skilling is in multi. or all escapes pass through multi.In single way combat yea its stupid but you shouldn't need to bring 500k+ armor sets to skill when the pkers are all just gunna show up in xercian and d hide or maybe mystics to have a fuck all of a chance of getting out. Nerfing the bulwark will pull more people out of the wildy and less people getting zammy wines, black chins, and dark crabs/ wildy altar are all gunna thin out big time.
---
What
---
Lol im a pker but i dont know how that has anything to do with this topic:D
---
"why go into an area of the game"
---
"which is why so many ppl grind out pets and ironmen grind out drops"
---
So you already knew the answer to your question.
---
Thats like telling a programmer: "Well if you cant build a computer from scratch you dont get to have a computer". Its not his job to build a computer. Why should skillers and PvMers ave to PVP
---
I just got one of those. Congratulations
---
To be fair, swamp man *is* good, and rc *is* bad
---
They had this before. People would just ddos you and you would die and then you items would appear and they would pick it up. The change I believe was to combat it and it seems to be working
---
And tricking people isn't an "exploit" of the game.
---
This made me curious so throughout the country:
---
There's 4 taverlys
---
0 ardougne
---
0 lumbridge (but 1 lumbridge hill wood)
---
0 catherby
---
0 seers village (but there are a few seers roads/courts/drives)
---
0 draynor
---
0 varrock
---
0 falador
---
4 edgeville
---
A few kharazi related
---
1 shilo village
---
1 karamja
---
0 brimhaven
---
0 barbarian village
---
And a lotta camelots.
---
No shit thats why i pointed it out.
---
Not to mention that offensive gear should cost a lot more than defensive gear. 
---
It‚Äôs fine if defensive gear is cheap because they risk less, but their outcomes are either dying or surviving generally, meaning you risk less but have almost no chance of gaining. . Offensive gear is more expensive because the outcomes are kill or don‚Äôt kill, meaning your chances of earning something are larger
---
What do you mean? ü§î
---
Hey look at all of the players THAT SHOULD BE PMODS AND WOULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN THE SHITTERS WE HAVE NOW.
---
I never said otherwise, I'm just stating facts. People are down voting me though?

"very lategame shield" 6m btw

---
I agree with /u/-Maxy- that you should stay and kill it then and there.  
---
Here‚Äôs some more specific info from the wiki, to answer your question.  
---
&gt; A superior monster will despawn in two minutes if the player stays in the vicinity and does not attack it, or less than 30 seconds if they leave the area.
---
dying isn't afk
---
Lmao can't believe you did this bruh
---
It's also pvm. It also has clues. I don't understand where you think you're OWED my death or something just because you're pking in the wildy. Want to kill someone with good gear? Use good gear. That simple. 50% hit rate with Ahrims, but you can't have that, because that means you're actually risking more than you're demanding we risk for you. Don't want to risk mils? Don't attack someone with defense gear worth mils. That easy.
---
&gt;very late game
---
I‚Äôm not sure about that one Chief
---
Lol
---
Dhides are a large part of the issue but it wouldn't be a big deal if the bulwark didn't make you like a brick wall in the face of melee or range. If they could switch to melee or range after splashing to get some hits in it would be reasonable. With bulwark I can have arma chest and chainskirt with a veracs helm and suffering and be virtually unkillable by all three styles unless I have a stroke when I get attacked, all while only risking 200k.
---
Personally wouldn't mind removing the shield if we just removed multi from the wildy. I've never watched a vid of people multi pking and been like "yeah this looks like it contributes something to the game" 
---
Whereas singles looks fair, balanced, and way less cancer. Leave clan fights to clan wars and I'm all for nerfing the absolute fuck out of people's defensive options in the wildy. As long as multi exists I wouldn't even mind doubling the Shield's bonuses so multi isn't an instant death sentence that just must be avoided at all times anymore. Make it easier for single players to pk pvmers (already easy besides not being able to find people because multi exists and they're scared to go into the wildy) and get rid of it.
---
Elo system would help imo. Pairs noobs with noobs and gives incentive to work your way up over time. Soon it will be time for me to move on from my main, with an elo system I‚Äôd get into pking instead of committing the rest of my young life to an iron
---
They‚Äôre both New York billionaires, of course they were bound to have interactions with each other. That isn‚Äôt evidence that Trumps involved with this. Clinton personally flew on his plane 26 times. Clintons involvement has actual evidence to back it up, the only thing I‚Äôm seeing about Trump is speculation from reporters who would love nothing more than for Trump to be involved. I‚Äôve said all I have to, the evidence will prove me to be correct.
---
We already have this.... It's called Morytania legs
---
Lol....what do you think?
---
Fr if you want big money go pk other pkers, not the guy with 200k of d bones. But the people complaining are likely not good enough to win vs someone who knows how to pk.
---
Just remove the wilderness completely and make all the kyles go back to punching drywall and hating their fathers

Quests bad actual oldschool philosophy bad raids good
---
My bwana üòç

Yeah lemme just bring a guaranteed 6m risk so they can call the TB earlier /s

Stop wasting people's time when they give you real answers because they think you're genuinely curious. Just makes you look like a dick especially because you have no clue what the fuck you're talking about.

Thank you for this line - many people need to hear this

Good ol stick and pokes with your friends lmao
---
40m, it says on the top of the bank window
---
Well there is one more color still...
---
Lmao obviously. If you are pking you shouldn't get salty about the possibility of another pker getting you.
---
You'll be waiting a long time.
---
But you didn't say it. You danced around it with a passive aggressive tone üòÅ
---
Welcome to the club
---
Funny... back when I was pking in classic I was fighting other PvPers, not obvious skillers risking jack shit or pvmers.

Invest in better snack foods mate. I went from fat piece of shit to regular piece of shit just by swapping chips/cookies etc to slim Jim‚Äôs beef jerky and fuckton if granola

Zulrah vorkath raids best money makers afaik

I was walking to varrock once and this same guy ran up to me and gave me a stamina pot, what a legend #blessedbythechest
---
Because its unreasonable to expect people to bring Ahrims to counter gear worth 20k.
---
I'd prefer some method to make the D'hide cost more than nerfing it but its difficult because of how easy it is to obtain
---
Good days.
---
In addition to any other boosts the pker has and any other debuffs they've placed on you
---
Blessed d'hide already exists, why not just nerf black d'hide but leave blessed d'hide alone?
---
Aware.
---
Turn on auto retaliate.
---
Congratulations. You're now able to deal damage to the person attacking you with literally no risk of being skull tricked.

so tanky armor is tanky?
---
gotcha.

It‚Äôs literally the same % that you got lol.

---
Are there any plans for more wilderness updates? would love to see some more methods to gather resources in the wilderness.
---
\-Some new fishing spots would be great, and because they are in the wilderness maybe they have some sort of extra bonus. Like a chance of catching two fish, or catching fish quicker.
---
\-Magic trees and other trees that have a chance of cutting double logs. Or an Undying tree similar to the redwood tree but it is a magic tree. And with diary completion it can be noted logs.
---
\-A farming patch in the wilderness would be really cool too.
---
\-more cool chests or other things to use thieving for as well.
---
\-Gem rocks in the wilderness that are more likely to give higher level gems.
---
anyhing really that might involve more skilling in the wilderness, that either provides more resources or more xp or a balance of both than conventional methods in safe areas.
---
This took me like 20 minutes lol
---
They couldn't at least give him a border radius on that picture.  Sheesh, looks terrible.
---
No rage. Just a congrats on a sweet drop!
---
L0000L chestbrah no beaver
---
His dmm views and pking views skyrocket compared to him playing on his hcim with 1.5k views. I dont know where u got that information from.

The reason swampletics gets a lot of attention is because of his unique gameplay and knowledge of the game. It's something new to watch for people.

Opposed to a 6m shield
---
Funny meme. Lame attempt
---
I'm guessing the not filled in one is white and there's no yellow because you don't have an Asian friend?
---
The hate is *real* but I kinda prefer them  too.
---
U are wearing BLACK D HIDE. Comparing the same fucking gear man
---
&gt;Pray melee and manta ray brew every hit. If it‚Äôs singles and you only need to tank for a bit, you can‚Äôt die from this.
---
You can't just always avoid multi, and if you're skilling odds are you don't just have a shit ton of supplies to tank every single hit one after another.
---
Did you just tell mammal this on stream? Gratz!
---
This nerf is pretty much to cater to rev caves pkers. Doing any other boss in the wilderness requires you to eat your food so you're already at a disadvantage when a pker comes. Rev caves is in multi to make up for this. 
---
Nerf was dumb and the shield was perfect as is
---
üóøüóøüóø

MRW is the part in capitals friend

My non-scientific guesses

Easy - 5k

Medium - 75k (this one can basically just be calculated currently via the price of eclectic imps)
---
Hard - 100k
---
Elite - 150k
---
Masters would just be equal to the price of the sum of the first 3
---
The prices would crash hard though as there would be so many more clues being completed.
---
everyone there looks like a a noob i would too

You're a madman
---
Gratz! I‚Äôve still yet to get any pets but I‚Äôm happy for you!
---
Whoa, I was just giving you a suggestion. 
---
Apparently wielding a Bulwark is 100% guaranteed protection in the wilderness from clans. How is it even considered a 6m risk if you literally can't die while using it though? 
---
I don't understand how you're getting baited in edgeville and if you're complaining about getting baited in deep wilderness i'm even more confused as to what your having a sulk about.
---
Either you get it or you don't
---
I dont think the update has happened yet. I thought it was happening in tomorrows update and the blog was just letting us know.
---
Pkers actually think this is what non-pkers are like.
---
That's a good meme right there

*doesn‚Äôt have 99 Magic in 2019.*
---
I do zero PvP but just from a week of catching black chins in the wildy I could tell the bulwark was ridiculous. People screeching about this are just idiots who don't like anything being made more difficult for them, even if it's justified. Bulwark is meant to give really good defense, not invincibility. As it stands now, it gives invincibility. I don't even bank my chins it's so ridiculous.
---
The two things you‚Äôre stating are 100% in conflict
---
A metal shield shouldn‚Äôt have a lot of mage defence even if it is late game lmao
---
Downvotes don't prevent you from responding lol, if you're making a comment and some downvotes is all it takes to dissuade your argument you clearly didn't believe very strongly in that argument. I've seen many times in the past where someone says something that gets downvoted but gets upvoted in their further responses cause they actually stay calm and make sense. The main problem with people making PKing discussions is that the PK community is so immensely toxic and they huddle themselves together they don't know how to stay calm and be rational when faced with disagreement. I've seen proper points brought up from all sides, but 9 times out of 10 when a PKer tries to argue about Dihn's or some other topic they inevitably devolve into attacking the person they are responding to or devolve into a 'troll'.

ok the game is designed and iron man is a side option for people who want to play the multiplayer version of the game by themselves
---
&gt; Don't try to fight back if you don't know what you're doing 
---
Yeah man, just lie down and die. Don't try to fight back in a fucking player versus player area because you can get manipulated through the game system to lose more than you're supposed to. And PKers wonder why the wilderness is fucking dead.
---
There are two kinds of Pkers:
---
One is a pussy who attacks defenseless PvMers because they are trash at the game. 
---
The other is one who attacks anybody they see, more so other Pkers with good gear and not the PvMer who will keep his items on death. 
---
So, which one is complaining about the bulwark?
---
They should send a global broadcast message to everyone in-game as soon as Chestbrah logs in.
---
That sounds perfect. It'll make grotesque guardians more lucrative to kill and gmauls rarer.
---
Its used both ways go look in the rev caves once vast majority of people will be using it both pking and pvming 
---
and idk how to increase the cost I'm not a gamedev increase the leather needed per piece or smthing
---
It‚Äôs very comparable, because one is a set designed for a high risk activity and the other is protection for people against that.
---
?
---
F
---
I'm not here to argue what is the best gp/hr in the game. That is irrelevant. 
---
Yes lava drags is multi and everything else... Not sure why that matters when you can't smite a bulwark from an unskulled player. 
---
My whole point is that you said pking was high risk high reward (or some one else did in this same chain) AND you say that the only reward is a 12gp spade. Legit just arguing against yourself here. 
---
There is risk in the wild from tons of players...that's why there are as many pkers as there are.
---
What people are failing to realise here is that the guy with the bulwark isn‚Äôt the one that would ultimately kill the pkr, it‚Äôs another pkr that comes along with better gear.
---
Those pageants have one massive area where people get dressed. It's not uncommon for staff to be back there with the contestants.
---
Is it creepy? Sure, but it's not evidence of someone having sex with underage children.
---
Killing  a defenseless  pvmr  is just so fun. You never know what they have it's like a surprise every time
---
No, xp/h using dharok is only better starting at 92hp. Full obby + berserker necklace and super combat is afk way to go
---
Pking was fun for noobs before people brought 1 tick switches into the wilderness. I remember bringing a r2h and armor into the wild as a kid and occasionally killing people. 
---
However, The skill floor to be able to compete is insanely high, and when you consider that you have to actually invest your bank into learning, it is no wonder why people would rather just farm zulrah.
---
What pking was is gone, and jagex needs to stop trying to catch the same lightning in a bottle and makes some changes.
---
Why not make a consumable item that announces your inventory value? ü§î Could make a "pls don't kill me, I'm worthless" actually legit. Make them cost at least 100k. If they kill you for fun, you're in the wildy. If they don't want to waste time for skull, np.
---
Because the pkers also face 0 danger against a player with a Bulwark unless attacked by another pker, so it's fair.
---
Putting on a Bulwark does not make you magically invincible. You still need to be good at keeping HP high and prayer switching.
---
Trump isn't staff. There was no reason for him to be back there.
---
This sounds like a cry for help out of ELO hell. I'm sorry friend, it gets better
---

---
You can only buy the keys from RuneShop.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to splash don‚Äôt attack the person with bulwarks. No one is forcing you to attack him.
---
:0
---
I think they both noobs in this picture
---
You aren‚Äôt forced to try to pk people with bulwark.
---
It‚Äôs 2% less effective. You‚Äôll be right mate
---
The Pker is risking that gear because they are skulling while the PvMer is not. Don‚Äôt wanna risk the gear don‚Äôt skull. Simple as that. The game shouldn‚Äôt cater to pussies who only fight PvMers because they know when they attack another pker they will get smashed. 
---
Tl;dr: reeeeeeeeeeee
---
good luck maxing an account without training 7 skills...
---
Right, but it allows you to close the gap in order to then stack someone out. 
---
Melee and ranged cant do that.
---
I have a quick question in world 347 there are 20+ lvl 3 players walking around continuously. Wtf is going on?
---
And where you can use shields in response to being attacked, since that's what shields do?
---
They are able to die, you're just upset at having to deal with tanking
---
This, or something like it. Nobody is going to invest time and money into something that's gonna yield mils in losses before seeing any profit.
---
Yea but no one with dhins is about to skull up, that defeats the purpose of it
---
I like having HC Ironman hunt for their clues in wildly still,
---
the solution should never immediately be to nerf an item that is already super niche. it should be to buff the options or introduce things that counter it.

Nice copy pasta off of Reddit poker

Just promote 50 trusted players to be p-mods, allow free membership if they mute 10 people per day, problem solved.

ok, so good. pvmers should be able to escape. maybe pkers will finally start killing each other.
---
What's with all the hate towards pkers? They're part of the community just as much as everyone else is
---
eh i bring claws to dark crabs and such with a suffering on recoil. U snake a bit here and there

Then leave the wild?

‚ÄúDo you want to lose money for having an item‚Äù of course people will vote no. I think it‚Äôs dumb to nerf a tank item created for tanking... but whatever, I‚Äôve never used it and prob never will. The gmaul is broken and needs to be nerfed. Void needed to be nerfed. Zulrah and Serp helm needed to be nerfed. They wouldn‚Äôt have passed a poll because most people think about themselves. ‚ÄúDo I want to make less money at profit snek? Hmmm no I like it how it is‚Äù

I like it just as a [[[very]]] rare drop. The thing is that even if it's something like whip drop rate, it seems like the price would crash pretty quickly since you know, not a ton of players really need the luxury of not having to buy thread and have it in their inventory. Seems like it would make a really good "luxury" item (Similar to having a pharohs sceptre for getting to pyramid plunder) and something for mid level players to really be surprised by as a lucrative drop.

What if the skull of players who have attacked you appear a different colour and act as a hit box?
---
Is a bad thing giving pvm and skillets reasons to go to the wildly?

so then they can get a scythe.... tob is not hard, people just dont want to learn how to do it.  And eventually there will be something better then scythe.

"Osrs soa" cc is good for doing shield of arav/heroes quest. You can also try joining a clan, there are 8 trillion on the rs official forums

Probably bots, some dude has an army of bots that do elaborate follow dances
---
Your question is addressed to those who don‚Äôt do their clues. That means their clues are almost worthless to them. I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd be willing to sell them for a lot less than the average loot of said clue given they‚Äôre not willing to do the clue in the first place
---
It is against their word that they changed it so long after COX was added.  Dinhs was polled to be how it was, for them to integrity change it years later is not integrity.  They would've changed it years ago if it broke the integrity of pking or the game.  It is also *extremely* alarming they chose to classify it as "integrity."
---
This classification affirms a belief many hold, they are classifying some updates as "integrity" updates to circumvent polls.  They are using it as a mechanism to push updates through that Jagex believe will not pass a poll.
---
They have also guised it as something pkers requested, essentially saying they surveyed pkers (well actually met up with some streamers IRL to talk about things that can be done to fix or otherwise revitalize the wilderness again).  The problem?  We were never told who came up with the idea, what other ideas were pitched to Jagex, or anything.  Basically, some mods liked this idea (possibly coming up with it themselves) and pushed it through the game despite the promise content changes would be polled.
---
I respect that self awareness, follow your own advice in the meantime and put your energy into something else. Upvoted for attention though
---
Dinhs Bulwark isn‚Äôt a shield it‚Äôs a bulwark
---
My other favorite classic spot was lvls 1 to 5 wildi as a lvl 5 fatigue mage in east varrock by the rats. Took maybe 15 mins to set up and maybe 50k or so for supplies to train and pk indefinitely. Was so much fun back then.
---
its not impossible though, i guess im not wearing the 100m setup but ive died a few times at chins in dhins and dhide when a team tbs me and i have to tank all the way to ditch. besides even with -10 to dhins youll still be just as unkillable in full arma, mostly this just hurts the people who cant afford the full tank gear
---
You can 1 tick with the dds and claes just like the gmaul
---
Yeah like I said doesn‚Äôt seem illegal so might have been a mistaken ban if they found that many accounts from the same IP doing the same thing (would appear to be botting) 
---
Hopefully you get those accounts back!
---
And just a word of unasked for advice, I get it. But at the same time playing a lot of runescape to not think about your problems while an okay coping mechanism short term isn‚Äôt healthy long term. When you get out of this phase/game you don‚Äôt want to come out worse
---
Nope. Sounds like you lost it somehow.
---
To be more precise- because everyone is crying "it's getting nerfed!!1!" without actually reading- it's getting -10 in all defences. Very small nerf, borderline trivial
---
30~ hours
---
The game said I commented the offense on 05/19, I haven't played since 02/18

That was fine before the skill floor to compete got so fucking high. I remember killing people with MSB &gt; DDS back in the original rev caves. I might have died 3 times for every person I killed, but fuck, I still occasionally killed people. Now everybody has 1 tick switches and teams, its impossible. Jagex is trying to catch lightning in a bottle, the old wildy is just not coming back, not without some serious changes to pvp. Pkers don't want that though, so we're stuck here with PVMers ignoring the wildy, and PKers complaining about a fucking shield with no other use in the game.
---
I get that not everyone likes to be in the wildy, but it is a more exciting part of the game. You have to be focused on your surroundings if you want to stay alive. You can't (but in reality there are plenty of moments where you can) AFK like in 80% of the content of the game.
---
What about mage damage buff? I think 5% should be enough otherwise it would be too good.
---
Thanks for your input, this is a great solution, I just wish that I woulda thought of it first ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I was thinking this as well. I'd also like to see:
---
a toggle to remove orbs that show public-private-trade options to allow the chatbox to be up higher and give more room.
---
Or a completely click thru chat box, with a button in the settings tab that brings up the keyboard. 
---
I even had a look there is a nice little space for it to go next to the "followers" and "mobile function" buttons (which can be found after clicking the joystick button in the setting tab) it is easily accessible so there is no real delay or pain to use the chat 
---
Better yet both of these to be toggle options to get more room and be able to click near the chatbox without a keyboard taking up the whole screen
---
I can post pictures of my proposal if it's hard to understand
---
I like this! I‚Äôm 235 hard clues in on my btw with no blessed d hide top so I‚Äôm jealous

FUUAAARKK
---
You can 1 tick the dds to gmaul and 1 tick the claws. It's people like you that'll ruin pvp with this rushed shitty update
---
26 to be exact. It's 500k an hour and 13m xp to 99, 13 / 0.5 = 26

If you feel you can't do anything because of 'XP waste' you need to seriously take a look at yourself and identify a way to get out of that mentality. Set a limit on how much time you play RS every day or make a conscious decision to stop playing when you get the feeling like you should have stopped an hour ago.
---
Being tethered to a skinner box and neglecting real life responsibilities will destroy a person if left unchecked.

If you aren't addicted and just enjoy playing Runescape more then Rocket League or Dota or whatever then shit man play whats entertaining you the most.

download it
---
But how do you define legitimacy?
---
Any clan that takes somebody that isn't max combat isn't a clan, more like a slightly organized mob.
---
I can see how I overshot but it‚Äôs within a margin of error which is okay, but let‚Äôs agree with you there. His KC has 0 influence on whether he gets a b2b or it‚Äôs rarity. That‚Äôs a pretty key statistical concept that you‚Äôre missing. In games of chance the previous events have no correlation with events that occur afterwards and there‚Äôs lots of sources to back that. I‚Äôm not gonna continue arguing with you over it.
---
my goal is to get all 99s so i can never play again /s

Trump knew Jeff for 15 years but didn't know he had a child sex ring? lmao
---
Yes! This is a great suggestion. I think it should just be charged with thread charges for simplicity‚Äôs sake. This will make it nice to be able to make an extra d-hide body in a full inventory setup.
---
Thanks maybe ill do this.
---
This was before Runescape 3, last I remember, farming and construction came out during this time.
---
I kinda wanna add onto this for a cape room? Just a room full of mounted cape racks or something to showcase your skill cape, and other achievement capes
---
Nobody will bring that shield if charges are dropped upon death. 
---
They can nerf it, but they should also revert the effect delay upon wielding the shield
---
yeah man, I'd wager if you can learn to not stress you're already ahead of a lot of pkers. after that you can actually learn the mechanics, since you can think about what you're doing. learning not to panic was the biggest barrier for me at first, at least
---
Jagex has already decided that all PvP changes are now integrity changes, so there wont be any PvP polls for you t o vote on buddy.
---
The G maul alone is 31-35k once you add in armor an arrows a usual risk on a lev 48 (my current pure) is over 80k...
---
Get cancer
---
But not the way the market works
---
I thought it was a pvm focused item
---
So I loved that game when I was growing up, and I love it even more now. I'm just curious. Do prayer bonuses stack with item bonuses? Like salve amulet does melee bonus against undead. Does the attack prayer stack with that??
---
add tags to boss droptables, same rate as jars
---
What‚Äôs the fastest way to drop an inventory of ore/fish/logs etc?
---
Not trying to be rude, but the front page on the osrs site should probably be your go to for info rather than reddit.
---
Married with a kid and you play maple story
---
There's fucking bots with 2k total doing that for months.
---
Ice barrage is a broken spell. There should be broken armor to defend against it.
---
Maybe like, fight someone who would actually fight back? Like oh I don't know, another pker? I know it's a foreign concept nowadays but it's actually quite fun to fight someone on equal footing.
---
Although on the other hand, nothing compares to the rush of trying to kill someone that has no intention of fighting back. The feeling when you pick up that 50k worth of loot is unparalleled.
---
Once you've killed a pvmer for 50k there really isn't going back.
---
Yeah you def run out when trying to use it on dusties
---
I'll bring the usual darts and Ava's along with too
---
This is the most accurate one
---
its not whining if its an glaring issue thats being ignored as they pretend to care about pvp(which they dont, for understandable reasons).
---
Www
---
No you‚Äôre right. I just couldn‚Äôt find anything when I googled it. I just needed to be pointed in the right direction
---
Yeh good idea man, run a speedcheck on a few computers in the area, if ur getting consistently less than your friends you may be able to get a free upgrade on your internet plan/infrastructure
---
It is though
---
Pvpers who risk a shit load bring it out with them because it's broken op
---
Now THIS is a poll I can get behind
---
I‚Äôve barrage is bis ancient damage too tho lmao.
---
I honestly enjoy browsing this subreddit more than playing osrs
---
It‚Äôs going back to what you have been talking about with your past comments in this thread.
---
We're all gonna make it bros
---
Clicks are fine (it counts as remapping) as long as it's 1 to 1. Mouse movement is not allowed except with mousekeys
---
Another fanart by Zuhaar maybe later ;)
---
Yesn't
---
How do you know you're in the top 100?
---
Before you start actually playing, do the observatory quest and check the reward from constellations, you have 1/3 chance to get combat exp. This matters so you can access fossil island eventually, since you need to complete it to get the kudos required. If you have a constellation which gives combat exp you need to re-roll (think it's still like this anyway).
---
The brimhaven fruit spider ain't so bad, you can pretty safely stand on the north side. If it does somehow agro on you, walk 3 or 4 tiles north to de-agro.
---
The calquat patch is a different story, there's spiders, snakes, and those fly trap plants on the way (from fruit patch). On the patch itself are two spiders, I found the south side to be most safe. I always bring 3 wines for this part of my tree run and usually only use 1.
---
I also get to gnome stronghold for their tree/fruit patches by using "the outpost" tp on necklace of passage, there is some hobgoblins who also can hit 5(?) but if you have run energy you should only be hit once.
---
Also farm cave nightshade at draynor manor for more herblore exp options. (wear gloves)
---
Falling rocks at MLM can hit you only for 1 hp
---
Desert heat can 10 hit you
---
Failing higher level agility hits the same for any hp level so always carry food there (can't one shot, max is ardy with 8 I think)
---
Long post but that's most I could come up with now
---
It's one of the least accurate spells in the arsenal, use better gear and you'll get better results \*shrug\* and if you did splash 40 barrages in a row, you just got fucked on RNG, get over it.
---
What you're suggesting to be added to the outfit is really similar to what [the amulet of bounty does](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Amulet_of_bounty), gives a chance to save seeds
---
why should pvmers have to risk money when pkers risk jack shit in the first place?
---
I dont want to be forced into the wildy to complete pvm content to satisfy retard pkers who wouldnt pvp if not for pvmers being forced into the wildy...

I got downvoted for it on other subs but: the one thing Redditors hate is pointing out they act like Redditors.

---
Atleast charge it with regular thread?
---
how is this useful for people camping dragons though? you still have to tan the hide
---
Haha gotcha.  I could just see myself doing something like that.  Usually only take a whip, spade, glory, and some food into wild when doing a clue.  But could forget runes or something before heading out.
---
going by level is senseless and wrong, according to your logic the magic equivalent to black dhide would be ahrims lol.
---
Imagine just a loud neighing noise while you're skilling.
---
Www1
---
It‚Äôs not a KO weapon though, it‚Äôs like a damage over time weapon. Considering AGS can hit like a 70 and you can use it twice, vs this once, despite it being a t75 vs a t70, I thought this was a good item. But ya clans can abuse of it but you can do more DPS barraging with ice barrage. Plus you can move away from the 3x3 square unless you‚Äôre frozen
---
thats some completely arbitrary nonsense
---
This reads like someone whose never skulled in their life typed it
---
Maybe a right click on the needle that brings you to your inventory like high alch?
---
Probably engine work tho
---
I think Jagex should stop forcing ovm content in the wildy to satiate idiot pkers. Idc if the wildy is safe otherwise.
---
I find it bad for constructive discussion, but not horrible.
---
I think that's a decent tl;dr to what you said? It's also my opinion.
---
Yeah let the 80% pvm only playerbase vote on pvp updates smh
---
Imagine trying to lie about this being yours.
---
They're so annoying! Whenever I see them I leave toy horseys in a circle around them and give them to the people trading the bots.
---
Why should dinhs bulwark be nerfed?
---
Yes! I need more cute NPCs and monsters in the game
---
But that's just what happens when you skull. The entire point of the skulling mechanic is that if you attack people you risk a lot of money. If the guy with the bulwark skulled he would risk a lot too. If you don't want to risk your ahrims dont skull.
---
I made a new account because I didn‚Äôt know you could move the camera around with the middle mouse button and I got trapped upstairs in the general store in Falador because I couldn‚Äôt find the ladder to get down... I also made a new account because I had the mysterious old man flood my inventory with the mystery boxes and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get rid of them lol. I love this game
---
The weapon‚Äôs spell effect would resemble the RS2 spell Miasmic Barrage. That halved attack speed of the opponent for 48 seconds with Zuriel‚Äôs staff. This is 25% instead for 30.. unless the special is activated when you cast a spell, then it wouldn‚Äôt need engine work.
---
Please Jay Gexx, give us a lil' spider and let us charge him with bugs
---
You read it wrong
---
That is partially true, but the wildy would be less dead if there were motivation for pvmers to fight back when they get attacked.
---
Could you even imagine gatekeeping a nearly dead aspect of a game from 2004? I mean seriously, imagine getting to that point in life.
---
I remember this
---
Quite
---
never liked this loser
---
Pked a few times with my rune stacks bolt stacks etc xd. Best one is going gdz or rev ent in zulrah gear. Or goibg rev caves with 4 items forgetting your skulled. Had my heart racing a few times. I knee this girl a few months ago that teled to gdz 3 times in full gracefull lop! She got out 2 of those 3 times :/
---
This is a really good solution for multi.
---
It's just 500k-1m isn't that good for singles as you have less than a 1/1000 chance of killing someone who has enough dexterity to left click potions. and that 1/1000 chance is hitting a 80-40 gmaul.
---
here's the data:
---
https://i.imgur.com/VV5M7kW.png w/ prot from magic applied to the dps (not max hit in the pic).
---
takes 360seconds to deal 15 brews worth of hp not even including the starting 99. That's max MAX mage.
---
https://i.imgur.com/nzXRAhK.png for melee/range. this is without melee or range protection prayers
---
318seconds to deal 15 brews with 99hp with best realistic dps I guess. He didn't have prims and bring or pegs and buckler because no1 has 2 11 way switches in their inventory. 318 seconds is &gt;5mins which means you can tank a full tb doing nothing but left clicking potions in your inventory.
---
and this is all vs this rag gear https://i.imgur.com/he64s3p.png 2.5k risk
---
You also lose dps because you have to freeze them in order to continually melee them. 
---
So yeah, even if you risk 1b with the best gear available, you still won't kill someone sitting in a bulwark risking 2.5k in gear praying magic and augury and nothing else. literally nothing you can physically do but hope you ags a 80-40 gmaul
---
again this is for 2.5k in gear.
---
Then once you add suffering, serp helm, and fury...
---
https://i.imgur.com/OUGJsuj.png
---
Thats 376 seconds (more than 6minutes) to kill someone. And again, you still have to lose dps freezing him. So if you catch someone more than 76 seconds from a tele spot, don't miss the d scim spec, dont splash the full tb, and the guy doesn't do anything but pray magic, you can kill him for 500k now (or 30k right now).
---
Well there isn't really a magic equivalent to black d hide, but yes it does most closely resemble ahrims
---
Your amount is kind of ridiculous. Craws bow is ~20m and required like a 350k risk to use it for 1000 hits, which is way more than needed. A 6m item should be risking 150k for tanking 1000 hits.
---
Maybe don't say anything until you replace your brain with one that works properly
---
2% nerf, PvP community is gonna remain salty thankfully.
---
Lol I've never played this game  but the lingo sounds crazy
---
Like I read this whole thing and have no idea what it meant
---
I'm imagining Rot building their own statue in the wilderness @ 2200 revs and people fighting to take it down.
---
Sounds fun. Gets clans out there planting flags claiming territory and battling
---
Is it possible to balance something that's being controlled by market price though? Don't you risk ruining prices of either d'hide or one of the higher tiers by skewing it out with nerfs/buffs?
---
That link was just as un-epic
---
Dang, didn‚Äôt know. Used to watch him a lot before I took a break. Came back to check his twitch, social media and everything was MIA. Do you know if he announced anything or did he sorta just stop?
---
alch value - was why people used to pk in splitbark top, as mystic to protected over whip
---
If you grind the falador agility course for 1000 laps, you unlock this song in-game
---
Go teleport to house instead of crumbling undead the Vorkath Spawn yourself.
---
It is still possible to tank without the shield easily. 
---
I have never used one and as long as you have karambwans, shark, brews, stams and restores you can tank a 1v1 unless you just sit there and wait to die. 
---
They are complaining because they will have to actually learn mechanics instead of camping revs with no knowledge of how a multi combat area works. 
---
There is a reason those crossed swords show up on your screen. If you are not scared then you deserve to lose your items.
---
no wonder no one likes him anymore
---
Pkers: dont go to the wilderness
---
Also pkers: jagex pls bait more people into the wildernees
---
Market change to God d hide
---
Dinhs is one item though.
---
I think one of the Jmods released a graph with data on top hours played, on Twitter a while back. He could be basing it off of that.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the easiest skill in the game to hit ehp rates in, like its super easy to maintain 0 tick banking while watching tv.
---
Remove quest requirements entirely is what I‚Äôm after.
---
Low detail because shit PC.
---
What's wrong with the health bars or am I just crazy?
---
I used to always go to the Dark Warrior's Fortress back in 06 to restock on my chaos and other runes. I'd get PK'd there all the time back then.
---
I don't know why people downvote this. This is a very good example, I have many encountered many of these myself, but we were usually with 5 people, did he die easily? No and we were even using godswords.
---
Look at the use of the prayers by the bulwark person. It's dreadful to say the least. He is simply relying on his shield to survive.
---
Is this where we want PvP to go, where it doesn't depend on skill to survive?
---
Thanks for taking the time to look through the writing! 
---
Choice as creating resentment, hm, I can see that. That's a heuristic device I hadn't thought to apply like you just did: framing it in terms of a meaningful choice to assume risk, not a forced one that generates resentment. 
---
Off the top of my head, it does depend on what players think is "mandatory" or not. Like I never hear complaints that EHP for hunter is in the wilderness (3t black chins.)
---
It's worth exploring for sure as I edit this piece. Thanks for the feedback :)
---
It's so easy to not die doing wilderness clues. The only times you are vulnerable are mid combat against the spawns and that's only for a few seconds and most places are so random pkers won't be just chilling there.
---
just seeing the word "rune" on a weapon made me go nuts too haha
---
Oh ya ive started vorki and i love it, easy af and good money
---
How did you fix it?
---
I‚Äôll check that out good call
---
Haven‚Äôt played in a few months but here‚Äôs my .02 cents
---
If the problem is as bad as some Pkers are saying than a nerf would make sense. No one item should be an end all be all to avoid dying in the wildy. If say someone in full ahrims or mid level semi-expensive gear (5-10M) can‚Äôt hit I think that‚Äôs an issue. 
---
Though if they‚Äôre overhyping it and just mad that their black robe Gmaul rushdowns aren‚Äôt working than this is a total non-issue
---
Today was a good day for many noobs lol
---
He's done it to me about 2 or 3 times now. I don't think it's necessarily bannable unless you're crashing an ironman, just a scummy thing to do. I don't know about streamer harrassment. I do stream but I don't get any viewers so I doubt he's stream sniping.
---
take my reps
---
who cares, use whatever you like best
---
This is comedy!! üòÇüòÇ
---
Ahrims req 70 should not be hitting consistently on black dhide anyway
---
Bulwark req 75 should be comfortable blocking weapons of this tier or lower, thats what it is meant to do, you sacrifice the ability to fight back.
---
'Jiglex pls nerf bulwark to stronk'. Try using max mage, you'll hit.  "I dont want to risk that much" your problem, meaningless and should not be taken into account.
---
Were u able to figure out the legitimacy of the email?
---
nah, no one is going to get banned for crashing at corp
---
You‚Äôre getting really hung up on the cost of the items rather than the utility of the items. Of course a Dinh‚Äôs is going to be cheap ‚Äî the only place it‚Äôs useful is when tanking, with the huge downside of having 0 offensive ability. That‚Äôs not very sexy utility, but it‚Äôs fucking effective at what it does, and it‚Äôs intended to be. 
---
Risk is not equivalent, because people value the ability to do damage over the ability to prevent it. You‚Äôre gonna have to spend more to kill someone who‚Äôs trying to survive and run away and NOT DO ANY DAMAGE TO YOU than they need to spend to get away. They gain nothing if they win, you gain something or nothing if you win. 
---
My recommendation is try to fight people who wanna fight back. It sounds like you guys risk a lot. Lmao
---
I‚Äôve found the best reply is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind sharing :) ‚Äú and it usually makes them more upset and they end up leaving.
---
Did 100 chests and got 3 pieces worth a total of 300k so I stopped doing barrows. This was like 4 years ago
---
People will always favor an advantage by attacking people unprepared for a pker rather than a fair fight where the risk is equal. 
---
The wildy would be empty if there were no pvmers.
---
I'd a rough trade-off as people don't want to go into the wildy and get killed when they're not looking for a pvp fight.
---
But nerfing the bulwark is stupid as it deters pvmers even more.
---
Right? Every time I see the suggestion that we buy the game from the new owners I wanna bash my head against the wall because it demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of how business works.
---
That's kind of part of the charm/joke for me. He uses it *every* fucking time without fail.
---
Bounty hunter. They added kill death ratio recently, I think baby steps could work and if people like it and pvp count increases they can work towards some type or ranked. Just pairing you with a bounty target of similar kill/death and similar total kills or death could be a good way to start. And work something out so that you can‚Äôt skip or wouldn‚Äôt want to skip targets
---
Maybe she deserved it. I mean all I see is one sided comments here. Did she hit him first ? Did she cheat on him ? I highly doubt he just suddenly decided to randomly beat her up for no reason. Keep this shit out of here
---
extraordinary
---
Hides are meant to block magic, hides arent the problem, players that are expecting equal level gear to hit consiatently when one is designed to block the other are the problem. You should not be hitting consistently with magic wearing ahrims vs black dragonhide or karils.
---
If you got killed and did not hop then you did not learn your lesson. 
---
You would literally be better off not taking any food at all and hovering over the logout button. 
---
It is called game mechanics. Logging out is your biggest defence that is why they dissable it in dead man mode.
---
it makes me feel like a smooth operator operating effectively
---
Why pay 10gp when you can do it for free
---
what is everyones fetish now-a-days with everything being degradable? i hate it
---
I‚Äôd pay $12 for that
---
You arent risking enough for it to be worth the food and pots
---
Missing 4L bag of milk
---
"I want to make lots of money but don't want to risk" 
---
I should be able to fight back without the chance of skulling because I exist in a dangerous place" 
---
love the brews on the ground. sums up the fact everyone complaining doesn't know how to run and tick eat. they just think full inv of brews should save them.
---
you suck
---
Not quite the same, [but the world select page still exists](http://oldschool.runescape.com/slu)
---
Yeah just bring 150m in mage gear for a slightly better chance duh
---
How could you possibly know if it has or hasn‚Äôt from that picture?
---
I actually really liked Legion, what are your favorites? TBC and WOTLK?
---
I like it
---
Fuck no, because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing
---
90k Vs 6m .... Yeah op op must nerf.
---
Time to 3rd party develop? I wish. HD graphics were the best looking RS to me. The current though is nostalgic to some, just feels weird to play at first after being on another game in 1080/1440 with high FPS.
---
Amazing insight! ‚ÄúIf (your spouse) tries to beat you up you leave‚Äù. Why didn‚Äôt anyone think of that? You sir may have just ended domestic violence!
---
That‚Äôs not the point... it was just the sheer number of bots there. After the many hours I‚Äôve been there throughout my career I‚Äôve never seen that many before.
---
Falador. Remove second a. Faldor. Move l one space to the left. Flador. Could be misheard in a quiet conversation as flawed door. A flawed door wouldn't shut. Aka unhinged. Mod jed was unhinged.
---
Rot mod jed is 9 letters.  White knight is 11 letters. Mod jed confirmed did 9/11
---
The only reason people get banned for crashing streamers is because it's targeted harassment. This guy can crash random people all he wants as long as he isn't following you around worlds forever.
---
But the pker not being in danger isn‚Äôt advantageous to him, if anything he‚Äôd probably want the guy with the bulwark to fight back
---
If u only got 500k I‚Äôd say no
---
Blue wiz robes, wtf ? Lol
---
I wouldnt bother they wont raise the alch price because there are so many in game it will put too much cash into the economy which is why they are looking at seperate attachments. The g maul will only be worth its alch value
---
All bosses are usually safe spotted i don‚Äôt think that can hold much of an argument imo any time I try to pk pvm on a boss they have an inv full of brews also
---
Where is varock
---
By your logic we should get rid of relay races because rugby exists. Absolutely non-sensical reasoning.
---
My insight was to offer an alternative to whaling on them back, not end domestic violence
---
Thank you though for your thoughts on the situation
---
Agree, I'm not ready to quit yet, but I'm sure it wont be too long at this rate.
---
But can‚Äôt the guy with bulwark just protect mage since he‚Äôd have high range and melee defense
---
do you have any screenshots? I'm genuinely  curious as to what the 500k risk is. Mystic robes are 100k. Craws  bows  is automatic 400k risk.
---
The delay between crafting is not 1 tick though
---
Honestly so what lol?  I haven‚Äôt seen it and if everyone was following the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt repost old stuff rule,‚Äù people who haven‚Äôt seen it wont get the opportunity to enjoy it.
---
Just milk the spider more duh
---
Either you get it or you don‚Äôt
---
Does the typical person bring sanfews, imbued heart, arcane prayer?
---
If I had silver gold or platinum to give, I would use it for this. Way to go!
---
Why dont u do the math with all the variables i didnt account for since ur so big brained. 
---
Heres the numbers for small brained individuals. https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cbmdle/coming_from_a_pker_the_dihns_bulwark_did_not_need/ethl453/
---
I know of one chestbrah who was zyzz's brother, idk if it's the same one.
---
Fuck it man yolo and tell us how it turns out
---
You're acting like the entire game should be balanced around a player's value as a target versus your ability to kill them
---
You consider being attacked in pvp area harassment? Lol
---
As somebody who really dislikes basically every pvp aspect of this game I totally agree with your first statement. I don't get why people just gloss over the fact that for like every kill he gets multiple people get away. It's not like it'd be an interesting video if he just posts super long clips of people running away and chugging brews
---
My raids 1 content reeeeeeee
---
For one, don‚Äôt do vyvanse, addy, Ritalin, etc. to motivate you to study. It doesn‚Äôt actually help you retain any information. Focus on diet and sleep. It‚Äôs much much better to get a full night‚Äôs sleep and then study than pulling all nighters off pills. 
---
Second, if you have to, literally map out your RS time for the week/day. Limit yourself to an hour or two today, whatever you have time for. Always, always, always plan out study hours/class time/etc. BEFORE you even think about planning RS hours. Stick to your plan and set up rewards for sticking to it. Positive reinforcement is the best motivator, but if you have to you can punish yourself on RS. Go over by 10 minutes? Drop 50m (or whatever would be a really inconvenient for you bank depending on your wealth). 
---
Have fun
---
Oreos taste good but I feel so sick every time I eat some :(
---
It‚Äôs actually hard dying in wildly pvm if you keep a lookout
---
Irrelevant. It's still a rip off
---
Dutch worlds üò¢
---
I completely agree, although making pvmers easier targets is not the solution. Bulwark tanking is not the reason pvp is dead, it's because of the barrier of entry inherent to the risk in this game.
---
Easiest way to ruin your day i reckon
---
!delete
---
By selling Inferno capes
---
You obviously didn‚Äôt understand my point. It‚Äôs when it gets reposted weekly or more, upvote the good memes and people who actually enjoy Reddit will properly sort for week/month top or hot posts. Most do it ONLY to karma farm, not because they think it‚Äôs funny so much that they want to repost. Read my comments with OP, I respect those that keep the subreddit fresh, keep good posts around AND I understand if a person just saw it on twitter or such, then post here.
---
Give me a minute and I'll show you some different popular setups in the rev caves.
---
Why tho?
---
Buy at Christmas you get like 30% off for a year sub. $8.88 btw (or something idgaf drunk in Vegas getting away from the fucking rain back in Alberta).
---
Tbh I probably wont be resubbing after classic tho
---
appreciate  it! :)
---
How did you exactly stubble upon this Facebook post?
---
No, but just sounds logical
---
Yeh buy a bgs until you can afford dhcb. I'd go rigour first since you can use that for everything else in the game unless you plan on exclusively camping vorkath, then get dhcb first.
---
The bgs will speed up bp kills quite a bit until you can afford dhcb.
---
Not enough pkers to support it.
---
Found the guy who bought his cape
---
Bots exist because players are still so entitled they buy gold
---
Go to a pvp world, hang around the bank chests at lumbridge/camelot for like a min or 2. Watch about a dozen bots at each location teleport in and out every 15s or so
---
there are lots of bots rn
---
It ruined my day just imagining it
---
If you're in a 3v1 in multi you should lose
---
The guy looks like a pre teen, of couse he can only beat on girls...
---
I think he's referring to putting out the fire(s) in olm room in raids with water spells, but I could be wrong
---
1/50 so getting 5/50 is pretty rare I'd say. At least you can make a couple backup assemblers if you feel like taking one pking ;)
---
The explorers ring can already cast high alch straight from the equipment tab, so probably no engine work required.
---
Jeez. Luck in all the wrong places. The other day I get drake claw on 8 kc
---
92 is halfway to 99 u see. Ur like a little under quarter level.
---
No, I do die.
---
But not to Salad robers.
---
What I &gt; SORT OF &lt; understand is that when I do actually die... you get black dragon hide and that's lame.
---
On the other hand I am not there to provide you with free loot, so yeah... either leave me be or stock up on d'hide sets.
---
I like the tan party hat, is that new?
---
You're just revealing you were a noob who didn't bookmark the URL with their home world in it...
---
Not OP but I share his sentiment. I think if you remove the "I might get screwed here -&gt; run" feeling you currently have to have to not get screwed (skull tricking/pjing) people will be more likely to risk/dare to do some things. 
---
If I know that when I'm in single the worst thing that can happen is that 1 other person fights me - I won't get accidentally tricked to skull or spec dumbed - then I will take more risks.
---
As for Pvmers being pushed out of the wilderness -&gt; That's a good thing. Pvm'ers don't want to be fighting other players or stuff like that. They will if some BIS is locked there (d pick) or good skilling methods (black chins and wildy altar). Let the pkers fight pkers and let them pvmers do their thing.
---
Fair enough, although dinhs is mostly used for melee and range defence and the mage defence comes from the hides, but I get your point
---
You can absolutely use the Brimhaven farming patch. If you stand between the patch and the dock (I can't remember offhand which direction it is) the spiders do not roam far enough to be able to attack you. The only thing you need to watch for is where Garth is if you pay him to protect your crops, as he often runs into their range.
---
The calquat tree is likely one to avoid, as that is much more dangerous to reach. You can stand to the south and avoid the spiders again, as they don't roam that far, but I believe there are things on the way to the patch which could kill you.
---
For Runecrafting, I do not think the Arceuus books are great xp at low level. I did it for favour at fairly low level and I barely got any xp at all. You would need to check the rates online. It may be more viable at a higher level though.
---
The Wiki says that Motherlode Mine's rockfalls only hit for between 1-4 hitpoints. Not enough to one hit you, but enough that you would need food to stay safe from dying by accident.
---
Food/potions/runes is like 100k lol. Average tribrid setup ranges between 600k-1m
---
This is fucking golden my man wtf
---
Grove Street. Home. At least it was before I fucked everythang up
---
Because people love this particular game and they don‚Äôt want to see it ruined? What a dumb question
---
U shouldn't get another wc lvl in ur life
---
You could still go for clan pking
---
Streamers always getting special treatment is another huge L for Jamflex.
---
This reminds me of a pokemon, maybe an Entei-Suicune mix
---
Idk if I‚Äôd pk with fire blast because I don‚Äôt think the rune slot would be worth it, nor do I think the dps increase in any significant way. 
---
It‚Äôs just silly how people expect to shred through the best tank shield in the game (that was specifically meant to be so) with a dds and rcb. Like literally a 16k spec weapon
---
Oh buddy. It is a game lol. If you think just because you spent a lot of time on it that does not mean jack shit. You guys think you are entitled to basically run the game yet you are not an employee. I have been playing osrs for years yet I do not give a shit what they do because it is there company and people want to grow and make their company bigger. You guys are selfish as shit and just care about yourselves. Let Jagex do whatever they want and shut the fuck up.
---
I agree, why can‚Äôt the wilderness just be focussed on pvp, new items, new equipment that has extra stats while in the wild and looks jice for pvm but is not useful.
---
They should fix that shit
---
So little updates and all of a sudden the game is ruined? LMAO i see all of you complain about the tiniest updates and you all act like it is the end of the world. Get over yourself.
---
That would make a lot of sense, but a big part of the pvp community enjoy to just harass players and don't care about a fair fight. It seems apparent that their toxicity is backfiring at them now and the only way they can get updates through these days is by asking big daddy Jagex to force updates through integrity changes. Not a healthy situation IMO.
---
Especially these days
---
I‚Äôve thought about this before; but for every skill essentially: Either do the milestones or have a milestone/maxed (to get 99 instantly). Example: Proof of running a sub-4:30mile, automatic 99 agility. 
---
Squat twice your body weight? 99 strength 
---
Make real life wood items: fletching xp..
---
You get the picture
---
Arceus, the god of Pok√©mon, respects you for your worship! üòà
---
It isn't an excuse when the skull actually means something. 
---
Skulling with Risk means any other Pker has a chance of killing you. 
---
It is literally stupid to risk a lot as a pker because you will get scouted and taken down. 
---
Complaining about being able to run away less effectively is fine, if you accept the fact that the shield is carrying you not your skills. 
---
The bulwark won't save you if you don't know how to tick eat. the nerfs just make it less of a  crutch. 
---
I think the funny part is no one talks about how DFS will be +2 mage defence better than bulwark after update AND you can just passively attack with a rune crossbow.
---
None of these are actual QoL, idk why jagex labeled them like that.
---
How do I get customer support to resolve my issue in less than 48 hours? Cause I'm sitting on 40 hours of not being able to play RuneScape.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the Pok√©mon and not the Kourend place? Arceuus has 2 u‚Äôs
---
How about we address the real issue of skull tricking? Stop Youtubers glorifying this abuse and encouraging others to do the same.
---
Aye but you can pk some serious loot if they open the chest
---
I don‚Äôt even play it lol.
---
People fucking pay monthly for it you dipshit of course they are entitled.
---
The actual reason for this post is to flex the war ship
---
I realize I didn‚Äôt tell him to spell it right but, the message got through at least.
---
Try the chat: clan team cable. 
---
we have a large group of players who like all types of content in the game and range from top end PVM players to new starters. 
---
Hope you find a place that works for you
---
I always vote "skip questions" on matters i have no insight into such as pking, personally i don't like pking, i don't like multiplayer at all where the purpose is just to kill one another. But i have to respect and understand that not all aspects of a MMORPG like OSRS are for me, that there exist people who enjoy other things than i do, and also as being a person who loves history and the lore of the game, the Wilderness is the aftermath of the God Wars so i see the logic in it being a place of chaos and player killing.
---
YOU ARE THE REASON JAGEX DID THIS WITHOUT A POLL. YOUR IGNORANCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GO IN THE WILDERNESS
---
I mean GE basically killed the value of ever using game mechanics for non grinding purposes. Game had more mystery and socializing back then too. Still love the GE and its important for player retention and ease of access for new players. Really miss the cluster fucks at the General stores in varrock and lumbridge tho.
---
you just drew one of mintmadcow's videos
---
You think Torvesta is going to leave in the 100s of clips of him splashing on bulwarks? Fucking monkey
---
Thought it was chessbrah for a moment.
---
&gt;best shield in game
---
Ely?
---
"wasting"
---
completely ignoring the fact that thats a separate issue that should be fixed too
---
Just from the ones I run into + occasional streams I jump in, some ended up being pretty valuable lol.  Been playing since release tho
---
I would make a pking account if G-Maul didn't exist. I like the idea of Vengeance stacking but Adding That plus a G maul is just unfair to anyone low skilled in pking.
---
Why have you linked me to the calculator that proves you're full of it on your math lol.
---
 That's why the Reddit community is such a joke; nobody here even knows the mechanics of the game, they just angrily rally and circlejerk over whatever the hot button issue is. 
---
I guarantee you that you did not once on reddit speak up about a dinhs nerf before today, but suddenly you saw jagex arbitrarily decide to -10 everything about it so here you are, prattling on about this issue you gave very few fucks about before like it's the single most crucial change ever to happen to the game.
---
That's something that should still be polled IMO.  Spears are fine IMO if mace/bgsing isnt a thing.  Pretty sure itd pass as its a pretty bullshit mechanic.
---
You can't run with it in your hands, but having it in your backpack is no issue lol.
---
Lol, I remember people getting banned in 18 rated games for saying the "I'm 12 and what is this?" Meme in chat.
---
Always awesome to see some of the original RSC ideas that were floating around - where‚Äôd you manage to find this?
---
As a pker i completely agree. Dins bullwarl and karils at chins or chaos altar -&gt; dont even bother attacking
---
xerician has really negatively impacted the wild, that and the fact that ballista teams can sit at 30 wild with 1 mage and risk 200k and pop 30s through prayer very accurately. The fact that the rev bracelet destroys melee's max hit makes range the preferred style for the caves.  It would be nice to have a rev brace combine with barrows gloves which would mean more risk and help abolish the range bot meta of revs.
---
Not surprised really jamflox is quite a good company to hold onto
---
I mean, blowpipe, salve (ei) and a dinhs with black dhide is literally 0 risk
---
Pretty sure he meant monster farming spots, has to do with crashes is my guess.
---
I can just hear the prepubescent voice screeching this at the screen "MOOOOM I CAN'T KILL THIS GUY THAT ISN'T FIGHTING BACK TELL JAGEX TO NERF HIM WAAAA"
---
Mate, you have no fucking clue how I vote on pvp updates.  Stop assuming everyone in the world is as salty and vindictive as you are.
---
You don't have to, normal builds can do quite well in the wild, frustrating pures with camping range pray and if you got a dds you have a shot at a k0. Give it a try, you don't need a new account, or you know you could train your current one if you want to have more of a chance.
---
But why? Neither of those were specifically designed to be the best tank gear and were developed with future bosses in mind. DFS arguably was meant to be tanky but you can also wear a weapon with it. Dinh‚Äôs is literally a giant 2h shield, specifically designed to block the most amount of damage. 
---
I just don‚Äôt see the point in the stat nerf. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it logically. It‚Äôs super tanky, that‚Äôs literally the intent of it. You basically used this guy as a punching bag because he couldn‚Äôt attack back while wearing it. Idk, seems like a decent trade off. You didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything the entire time
---
[This page](https://runescapeclassic.fandom.com/wiki/Manual:WorldMap) on the RSC Wiki. It shows the evolution of the world map from November 2000 to March 2003.

Thank you for this
---
Why?  I'll just bring a Dinhs and be invincible apparently, according to y'alls logic :&gt;)
---
It's funny to see when brainlets literally run out of blood pressure to their brain and have to resort to these flashcards.
---
Actually, the screens of this heavily parkour infester concentration camp got me into p2p. This gloomy and chaotical village is the work of art!
---
Lorewise, it's an Auchswitz, what did you expect? Left-click follow Elkoy option?
---
Could always try my clan chat: P Room. Great mixture of new and experienced players. Also we do drop parties so it can earn you some extra money if you‚Äôre not doing much else in-game at the time.
---
The shield will still be nearly double the range and melee def of a dragonfire shield.  Seems like it's still going to be ridiculously overpowered to me. 6 million gold and way better than an elysian is which is 100x the price.
---
Yeah had hard time on that and the first parkour or combat ting ;D
---
Thank you kind sir, I hope you can look passed my potty mouth
---
I didn't call anyone a bigot lol.  Might wanna crouch down to increase blood pressure to brain, might aid in your reading.
---
\&gt; And you‚Äôre pretending he is impossible to have a conversation with lmao 
---
You're the last bwana on this sub to talk about that, looking through your post history.
---
Like when people start recognizing your username and being like "yeah this guy is Serene 2.0, he makes dumbass failed arguments all the time", it's time to pack it up Charlie.
---
38 is not the max hit for magic. Fire surge with a tome of fire hits in the 40s.
---
Hnnngggg, mirin' GAINZ
---
Do feel like it‚Äôs such a huge area of dear content. Something to spice it up would be good
---
Your membership first has to expire, only then can you start a new payment plan
---
Always "rS3 clone" reason lol. Why adding GE, Dragon Claw etc in the first place then? i am not saying we need exactly what was added in the past. But this game is full of people who are afraid to change which really limits its true potential to develop on many other aspects.
---
Idk why, but this is so wholesome
---
Pizza gate itself wasn't factual. The pattern itself was. 
---
Child exploitation rings tend to operate in similar fashions to what led people to suspect that pizzeria in the first place.
---
Of course, nothing was actually found. And busting in with a gun trying to be a one man vigilante and threatening everybody was certainly not the way to handle it. [But the suspicions were relatively legitimate. ](https://youtu.be/7dQVRLrCbZs)
---
Make a PvP minigame of the Tony Hawk Graffiti battle
---
1 day is accurate for noob account. High level account with one alt can make it in an hour basically afk
---
Fuckin spec trading clan!
---
We‚Äôre having some Crawsfish if you want to come over and join us!
---
Didnt notice, lol
---
I want one
---
Fair enough. just shows that you don't pk. You don't know no you're talking about, just farming karma lmao. 
---
nice fire cape post 12 days ago gz lmfao you don't even have the stats for the pking on the topic being discussed.
---
Popcorn out for the JMOD Smackdown
---
Yes and no.  IMO it was dumb and wrong for Jagex to put politics into the game.  But at the same time, many of the people overreacting were genuinely homophobic.  I'd be willing to be money the crowd would be smaller and less toxic if a damn Hillary statue went up.
---
That reminds me, i really should use fixed for my afk alt...  
---
having 2 runelites running + watching stream on twitch on a separate monitor all on the same PC is really hurting lol
---
no redwoods, no yews, no invisible level boost, further from bank
---
No lol
---
Bruh those were hella scary in f2p
---
Just having one is considered pretty awesome.
---
Save 5 minutes of your life and keep hopping then. Or you know, take an actual fight..
---
Not even proud anymore of being a pker, sad era.
---
When you play fixed you can accurately build up muscle memory with your clicks over time. 
---
Secondly your viewpoint isn‚Äôt  covered by the ui :) 
---
Hope this gives a few reasons
---
MrNoSleep &amp; mintmadcow lmao
---
*horse sounds*

You're just plain wrong if you believe that there exist any group of people with absolutely zero bias of their own or lack any form of groupthink.
---
A friends baby
---
I bet u are a anime loveing boy. Weeeeb
---
100m robe set whilst being surrounded by 5 of your own guys with literally 0 FUCKING RISK. I swear skull trickers, raggers and clans think they're doing god Ash's work out in the wildy
---
Maxed mains already destroy pures because you hit nothing but zeros most of the time on them.
---
Zulrah will be rough with those stats. Probably best to do some barrows first to get a few gear upgrades and mage levels. Do Morytania hard diary first if you haven't done it.
---
If you, a singular person, can witness 100s of people convert to pking, then surely there are others who have seen 100s of ppl convert to pking.
---
Yet pk polls don't go through, I wonder?
---
I agree with you guys, 100% suffering, since you won't have to suffer (hehe) recoil ring expirations and such.

Hey, I had the most amount of fun then.

I will take half the loot.

Well done.

Unlimited amount of wealth lol....I think you're over estimating what people bring when they do clues. Enjoy your shovel noob
---
b2p and alchs at gwd
---
If youre not disabled, you dont get skull tricked. Pretty easy.
---
That's because it adds a layer of skill. If you agree to not use overheads, you only have to switch gear. If both of you decide to use overheads you will have to switch both gear and overhead prayer.
---
And then voluntarily choose to kill a pvmer over searching for a pker?
---
Would you go nuts over me?
---
#Starting Stats and Equipment
---
Upon login into the beta, you will receive a random set of stats. When you start a game of LMS, these will be boosted to 99 except for Defence which will be changed to 75. This is to test that the automatic stat changes when you enter LMS work correctly.
---
Players will no longer start with just a beginner weapon. Instead, each player starts with a full tribrid setup. At the beginning of each game, all players will have the following items equipped:
---
*     Helm of neitiznot
---
*     Imbued god cape
---
*     Amulet of glory
---
*     Adamant diamond bolts (e)
---
*     Abyssal whip
---
*     Mystic robe top
---
*     Dragon defender
---
*     Rune platelegs
---
*     Barrows gloves
---
*     Climbing boots
---
*     Berse[r]ker ring (i) 
---
In their inventory, each player will find these items at the start of each game:
---
*     Black d'hide top
---
*     Mystic bottoms
---
*     Spirit shield
---
*     Ancient staff
---
*     Rune crossbow
---
*     Dragon dagger
---
*     Ava's accum[u]lator
---
*     1x Saradomin brew (4)
---
*     1x Super restore (4)
---
*     1x Sanfew serum (4)
---
*     1x Ranging potion (4)
---
*     1x Super combat (4)
---
*     1x Stamina potion (4)
---
*     12x Shark
---
*     2x Karambwan
---
*     Rune pouch - a unique version allowing infinite casts of blood and ice barrage and blitz 
---
#Looting System
---
Players will no longer receive loot from locations such as drawers and cupboards - only chests. These chests will now require a bloody key to be opened, which are still dropped when you kill an opponent. When looting a chest this way, your loot rolls once on an offensive loot table and once on a defensive loot table:
---
**Offensive:**
---
*     Dragon claws
---
*     Armadyl godsword
---
*     Armadyl crossbow
---
*     Staff of the dead
---
*     Granite maul
---
*     Dark bow with Dragon arrows
---
*     Infernal cape
---
*     Dragon warhammer
---
*     Seers ring (i)
---
*     Elder maul
---
*     Kodai wand
---
*     Ghrazi rapier
---
*     Heavy ballista with Dragon javelins 
---
**Defensive:**
---
*     Ahrim's robetop
---
*     Ahrim's robeskirt
---
*     Karil's leathertop
---
*     Dharok's platelegs
---
*     Torag's platelegs
---
*     Verac's plateskirt
---
*     Dharok's helm
---
*     Guthan's helm
---
*     Torags' helm
---
*     Verac's helm
---
*     Amulet of fury
---
*     Blessed spirit shield
---
*     Eternal boots
---
*     Bandos tassets 
---
If a player is in the final five survivors, they'll start to receive bloodier keys as a drop. These roll on the same defensive loot table as the standard bloody keys, but also roll on an upgraded version of the Offensive loot table which contains the following:
---
*     Zuriel's staff
---
*     Morrigan's javelins
---
*     Vesta's longsword
---
*     Statius' warhammer 
---
Loot crates will still appear on the map as before, but now roll on the upgraded offensive loot table. 
---
#Rules
---
The entry fee and reward systems for each mode will be as follows:
---
**High Stakes**
---
*     Costs 1,000,000 GP to play
---
*     Players who finish 3rd - 5th win a free entry token
---
*     Players also earn points for the rewards shop
---
*     Will continue to reward GP 
---
**Competitive (requires 24 players to begin and affects your rank)**
---
*     Players earn points for the rewards shop
---
*     No entry fee
---
*     No free entry tokens awarded
---
*     No coins awarded 
---
**Casual (requires 4 players to begin)**
---
*     No points awarded
---
In High Stakes and Competitive games, players will receive 5 points for taking part, 10 points per kill and an additional 30, 20, or 10 points for placing first, second and third. 
---
#Rewards
---
Let's talk rewards. Currently, LMS doesn't offer any rewards outside of the GP prize awarded to winners of high stakes games. This is unusual for a mini-game given that they typically offer rewards that are also useful elsewhere. Below is a list of proposed rewards, most of which have been suggested by the community. Let us know what you think and if you have any ideas of your own, feel free to send them our way!
---
**Deadman Armour**
---
In the currently retired Deadman mode, there was a set of armour that players could purchase for blood money. Unfortunately because the armour wasn't very good and blood money could be farmed, the armour was not widely used. So our first reward idea is to remove the stats from the pieces (top, bottoms, and cape), making the set cosmetic only, and add them to the LMS store.
---
**Trouver Parchment**
---
While in the Wilderness (under level 20), some untradeable items will break on death instead of being lost. Players can take these broken items to Perdu who will repair them for a fee. In order to encourage use of these items in deeper Wilderness, we propose a consumable scroll that can be handed into Perdu. He would then use it to enchant one of these items.
---
An item enchanted this way would not be lost on death above level 20 Wilderness. Instead, the item will lose its enchantment and be kept in its broken form as if the player had died in under level 20 Wilderness. This will also occur for PvM deaths. In a PvP situation, 75% of the repair fee of the item will be dropped to the floor for the killer as coins.
---
This is expected to widen the range of items used in the rest of the Wilderness. Because players will no longer have to go get these items again and possibly endure the grind again (defender, void etc), you're more likely to see them appear.
---
The cost of the scrolls is subject to balancing and testing.
---
**Halos**
---
For Many years Castle Wars have offered the 3 God Halos as rewards. But what about the other gods? Armadyl, Bandos, Zaros and Brassica have been underrepresented in the headwear department. As a result, we would like to offer 4 brand new Halos as rewards. These will have the same stats as the existing halos, but will allow you to support the god of your choosing.
---
**XP Rewards**
---
For the top 5 players in any competitive game of Last Man Standing, we would like to offer an XP reward, through a tome or token that can be redeemed in a combat skill of their choice. The XP awarded will be 35 x skill level.
---
This number is subject to balancing through testing and the beta phase.
---
**Games Played/Won Cosmetics**
---
These would be similar to the capes awarded for Chambers of Xeric or Theatre of Blood completion milestones. We would like to add two separate versions: one to show games played and another to show games won.
---
**3 Speed One-handed weapon**
---
For a long time now OldSchool has had the Event RPG and more recently received the Ham Joint as quick weapons to help train certain pure builds. We would like to offer another weapon to add to this list but one that is a bit more thematic with the regular weapons of Old School.
---
This weapon will attack once every 3 ticks and be one handed.
---
**Guthixian Icon/Staff of Balance**
---
In early 2018, players gained the ability to add a Saradomin's Light to a Staff of the Dead. This added some variety as a high level magic weapon that could cast Saradomin Strike. But what about Guthix?
---
With this reward, players would be able to take the Guthixian Icon to Juna. She would then infuse it into a Staff of the Dead, creating the Staff of Balance,
---
The staff of balance would have the same stats as both the Staff of Light and Staff of the Dead, and be able to cast/autocast Claws of Guthix.
---
**Bolas**
---
The bolas is a thrown ranged weapon that would require 70 ranged to wield. When a bolas is thrown as an auto-attack, it binds the player for around 10 seconds. It is possible to miss the bind as with other attacks from a weapon. Thrown bolas cannot be retrieved from the ground or by any Ava's device.
---
The bolas will carry the same offensive stats as a rune knife but with an attack speed of 6. The attack range of the bolas is 7.
---
**Staff of Paralysis**
---
The Staff of paralysis is a one-handed staff which requires 70 magic to wield. The staff would hold up to 1,000 charges and require 3 Nature, 4 Earth, and 4 Water runes per charge.
---
On each cast, the staff of paralysis would have a 1/10 chance of turning off your opponent's run. The staff would have a maximum damage of 10 and has an attack rate of 5.
---
**In LMS only cosmetics**
---
When we're good at something, we like to show it off. With this in mind, we want to offer the ability to unlock cosmetic changes to the starting equipment described earlier. For example, you could change your mystic robes to light/dark/dusk, your ranged equipment to gilded, and your rune equipment to any of the god and gilded variants.
---
We have heard your suggestions on some other items, such as moving imbues, Korasi etc. However, with other discussions taking place, we have decided that these may be better suited for other upcoming content.
---
**Negative XP Lamps**
---
One suggestion we've had had been to add negative XP reward lamps as an LMS reward. Since they were last polled, there has been continued demand for and discussion around the topic. These would allow players to remove a small amount of experience (~500xp) from a combat stat below level 50. Doing so means players could 'fix' their accounts by removing unwanted experience.
---
These lamps could potentially be used to remove XP awarded from quests, increasing range of account builds possible for PKing. This would open up a range of exciting possibilities to shake up PvP.
---
However, there is also a technical issue to overcome. Currently, XP removal has very strict restrictions built into the game engine to minimise the risk of accidental XP loss, which could be very serious for a player's account. Now that players would be able to trigger it arbitrarily, we would need the engine changed to ease these restrictions while still providing the necessary safety checks.
---
Let us know what you think of the idea. If the suggestion is taken forward, negative XP lamps would be polled again before being added into game.
---
All other rewards above and any that are added will also be polled. Before then, let us know your thoughts and suggestions!
---
&gt;autoclicker
---
And how do you know when a person is risking nothing? You can't see what they have in their inventory. If you see someone with no gear you might aswell kill them if there is nobody else around because it doesn't take more than 10 secs to do so. And yes some people carry stuff worth killing for even if it looks like they dont. 
---
Why is it so horrible to die if you dont risk anything? Ive done 300+ hard clues and got pked only a couple of times, its not like you die everytime you do wilderness step, unless you do them in bh world or something.

#Other Changes
---
Here is a list of smaller improvements made to the minigame:
---
*     Players' Defence levels are now set to 75 rather than 70
---
*     Spellbooks are set to Ancients for the whole duration of the game
---
*     Fake XP drops now show for all account types
---
*     Prayer no longer drains
---
*     Smite has been disabled
---
*     Shops no longer exist on the map
---
*     Killing your opponent now restocks your inventory with the starting supplies
---
*     Killing your opponent now also restores all of your Hitpoints and run energy
---
*     Supplies only appear to the player who dropped them but equipment appears on the ground to everybody 
---
#Future Changes
---
**Customisable Loadouts**
---
The option to organise your starting equipment and inventory is a feature we would like to add further down the line. This would mean players would not have to rearrange these to their preferred set ups at the start of each game. This was not possible in the beta, however, as player profiles are not saved on these worlds.
---
**UIM Access**
---
Ultimate Ironmen are currently unable to play Last Man Standing unless they have no items on them. In the future, we will look to implement a system to allow them to play by temporarily storing their items to be returned at the end of each game.
---
**That's all for the LMS beta, We hope you're as excited as we are to try out the changes and look forward to seeing you there!**

whats the point in starting with both a sanfew and restore in lms when you only get 1 brew? wouldnt it make sense to just have 1 sanfew since pray doesnt drain

---
One more time!
---
Smaller screen equals less mouse travel time which equal more clicks
---
QoL updates shouldnt have to be unlocked.
---
You dont have to do 200 temple tracks to unlock the shiftclick option either.
---
God that old school scan ad on top of the screen
---
Absorbs on Normal Custom Rumble. Started with food while I collected points.
---
When I hit the first 20K, I'd spend it all on Absorbs and just slowly build up the points.
---
If I spend 20k points on absorbs, I'd make about 23K points back. As you build up the absorbs each session, you end up with even more points. Now I take 100 doses in (25 spaces) last 3 spaces are Super combat potions. Lasts around 4 hours. Remember to log out after a session so the 6 hour timer doesn't mess you up.
---
Google the obsidian method for gear. Shouts to /u/sub-lyme for telling me the method.

---
Need a safespace? Just dont go to Reddit lol
---
I'm glad you guys are finally giving a proposal for a Guthix weapon alongside the Staff of Dead and Light- but I really don't like using the Staff of the Dead as a basis. Guthix has no presence in the God Wars dungeon and already has his own autocast item: The Void Knight Mace. If this reward were to be integrated with *that* instead, possibly with some unique stats, I'd be on board. (I don't know if I'd want that particular reward to be part of this minigame but that's also something I happen to not really mind)
---
I remember drop trading myself stuff in those 6 houses, holy shit i thought i dreamed that
---
If you aren't 99 mage/range I'd get them up with the money
---
Good thoughts man, People only see the surface level of PKing like the shovel meme, but it's better to get a shovel than lose to spec trading
---
"Willingly" no. Also my account is standard, I didn't put 100's of hours into a minmaxed pk account.
---
You get attacked.agter.you maybe kill.bulwark guy.
---
nsfw
---
Wow can‚Äôt believe I met dexys at the GE once
---
You thought a -10 mage defence "nerf" was over the top...?
---
the 2 are not relevant to each other? what does temple trekking have to do with shift clicking? Negative xp lamps are going to be advantageous for strictly pvp most likely, and thus should be related to pvp to obtain.
---
Man the people on this sub have zero IQ sometimes I swear
---
Nice rwt
---
Wouldn't call it an end game item with how much it costs now days. Dinhs is about 5-6m (not sure of exact cost) and you need to risk 100m+ just to land a freeze.
---
I'm fairly new to osrs but why do they have multi zones? Seems unfair to let a clan dogpile one dude.
---
Hard to swallow pills. I *never* pvp, but this guy is fair enough.
---
Personally I find getting pked in the wildy annoying af, but you can't claim any sort of objectivity when you're down voting someone for playing a sandbox mmo the way they want to play it and having fun.
---
Some people find pvm fun, some people find skilling fun, some people find flipping and merching fun, and god forbid some people find pking fun, even when none of the above activities are guaranteed to have a reward
---
"There are situations where youre wrong" doesnt mean there arent also situations where theyre right. A large portion of the playerbase feels like the wilderness is actually annoying to go into because there are players literally hopping through multiple worlds on multiple accounts to find victims regardless of their gear. I know the argument is that the wilderness is for that and its what you should expect, but its actually just garbage because 3+ pvp accounts will almost always kill non-maxed skillers making their way to or from a boss. Whats the point of fighting back ever? All you can do is run and hope they splash. Or are you saying the wilderness is worthless content for pvmers unless theyre prepared to fight 3+ players?
---
Hopefully it's a highish tier reward? As to not allow people to afk farm them. Not keen on this potential update either way.
---
I was around 4.5k kills dry for a whip at one point and I wasn't even lucky before that. I think I was like 1 whip behind drop rate
---
Pking is fun, dying will never be fun
---
That took me longer than it should have.
---
gmaul actually benefits beginners, and this is coming from someone that's new. It's much easier to get a gmaul kill as a beginner than a dds kill. (at least on pures)
---
Nah fam
---
They said they‚Äôd like to do this in the future. However the worlds it‚Äôs on currently are beta worlds your account info isn‚Äôt saved
---
That's not really a solution though. It's a bit of a vicious cycle actually. The more PvMers understand they'll die out there, the less they'll go there in the first place. The less people in the wildy, the more apt PKers are to just attack the first white dot they see regardless of gear because they've been sitting around for 20 minutes waiting for someone to show up. 
---
Pking people with no risk who don't fight back is never going to feel satisfying. Jagex should be looking for ways to make PKer vs PKer combat more profitable, and looking for ways to have the victor of that battle make it out with the loot before they get piled by a clan
---
Whats up with the "massive iq pkers" I see in all these posts? You're really that salty that new players are trying to PvP and attack you in a PvP zone? These players get killed all the time because they're easy pickings for decent pkers so I'm not sure what your problem is.
---
Yeah it would be really nice to have it as an add on to void knight mace
---
Tfw hackers abuse the game by mounting ur gadget on their face to get wallhack.
---
ITT PvM whining, how about we just give PvMers tools to fight back? 
---
Oh wait...
---
Lol straw man. You want some gifs in your dm of single pkers getting baited to multi daily.. the tag team in single is a weird one and probs needs a whole need thread. 
---
And that has been a tactic in mmos for decades...
---
[what about this lad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunescapeGoneWild/comments/a6mcbj/woodcutting_lvls/)
---
always knew that dude was a shady cunt
---
Because if you didn't wanna get PK'd you shouldn't have gone in the wild. Sit nerd!!! Nvm that we keep asking for pvm content to be put in the wild so we can triple team someone 20cb levels lower and spec him out. Just git gud.
---
No the devs making a balancing change despite it failing a poll does though
---
yesyes
---
We're talking about fighting back in singles as a means to get away from a pker. As a PvMer if I fight back and the pker attempts to lure me into multi by running away, I'm probably just gonna get the fuck out of there and not follow him to try and get a kill, because my intention isn't to get a kill, but to deter further aggression.
---
Okayyyy that would be a skiller :D btw
---
It would honstely be badass if houses werent instanced
---
Ranging rune drags is brutal. They hit super hard at a distance. Just melee them
---
The no-splashing update its really good actually. I wonder if there‚Äôs any way to apply this to bots at hotspots like draynor willows. Something like stop getting xp if the player repeats the same action identacally every time.
---
If it was charged with bugs then he'll never get hungry in this game
---
whats the point in adding it to the voidmace instead of sotd?
---
the only people who ever use god spells are people who do mage arena 2 (most people only need to do it once because the capes death mechanics have been changed without a poll) and low lvl pures.
---
The first group wont grind out pestcontrol just to be able to autocast 100 casts to unlock the spell and another 20 to kill that ent demon thing and the second group cant wear the mace because of the stat requirements.
---
Something about the lighting at the bottom of the halberd is wrong looking. Looks good other than that though, not like I could do any better.
---
Do ironmen use herb boxes or farming as the primary source of xp?
---
they will have to make halos from LMS take same amount of time as castle wars ones since you cant make sara and zammy ones hard to get and others easy.
---
You‚Äôre probably a child who just learned grammar rules yesterday. Good luck in 10 years when you forget them all.

Bolas op, gg mage

Aberrant Spectres?
---
I mean they‚Äôre at alch price now, so unless they change the alch price, the risk of loss is minimum
---
ya realistically i only see jagex adding death mechanics so you lose your stuff even out of wild, although it would never pass a poll.. invisible cloak would be pretty cool to see but would prob kill the wild
---
Quickly, while you're fighting someone, tell the difference between lIlIIIllIl and lIIllIIl. Or how about BlGBOBBY and BIGBOBBY? Did you even pay enough attention to know which one you were fighting in the first place?
---
Also, keep in mind that in scape it's harder to differentiate the letters.
---
Icons are so small on my tiny screen I have to tap around in their general area to get them out
---
You're the person attacking, right?  You're the one who is actively trying to kill someone else, willingly losing your safes so that you may have a chance of taking someone else's gear.
---
Maybe they should put that on the fucking sign, so that people like you might realize that skulling doesn't mean that the *other* person should be dropping more shit.  As far as anyone is concerned, PKers should be willing to risk everything they have all the time for the increased chance to PK harder targets.  If you don't like that risk, then don't PK :)
---
But stop bitching about how it's not as profitable as you want it to be.  You should have to risk something to get something in return.
---
Why on earth would you need to bring full ancestrals
---
lamps are limited to 500 XP (10 lamps of 50 xp)
---
The biggest gear change is that you can lamp away the 500 xp reward from a souls bane and unlock medium varrock chestplate 
---
AFAIK you can't get a new tier of RFD gloves with the additional 500 XP that the lamps would allow you
---
This might be different on a 10/20 def pure
---
So im guessing double stuffed oreos are platinum which you dont have, you peasent
---
Advertisement? All of the people PKing, PvMing at revs, hunting for bosses at chaos ele, etc would be able to see your clan's tag. If they saw it consistently, all the time in almost every world, you would definitely be recognized one way or another.
---
Among PKers that would be a way to build prestige for their clan.
---
Dude, I read ‚ÄúI saw Chestbrah‚Äù and set down my phone without seeing anything else to grab some water. I then thought, ‚Äúhuh, I bet it would be really funny to tailor that store copypasta to RS with Chestbrah in it. Then I looked at my phone and it was actually the pasta. Crazy how my mind went there without actually realizing I was already looking at what you had made.

&gt; I knew what he meant and followed his advise ever since.

---
Let me get this straight.. you think the gmaul isn't poorly balanced because it was worse in pre-eoc, even though it is a tier 50 item and costs 30k but it is used with literally every single melee combo.
---
And your other defense is that people will just RWT for claws? With that logic literally nothing should ever be balanced, because fuck it players will just RWT for BiS.
---
That's one way of thinking I guess lol
---
Don't get bammed, bro

If subscriber numbers drop significantly due to the granite maul nerf I will personally fund an entire squadron of skywriters to write ‚ÄúLazypole is special needs‚Äù over the location of your choosing.
---
"10s summary" meant I'm not going into the details of "its locked for now unless you participate with a 3rd parties promotion but we've been promised that it'll be unlocked after an unknown quantity of time has past after the original release of the partnered content". The simple answer is that its MTX locked content.
---
Source?
---
&gt;Integrity changes are jagex's way of forcing unwanted updates and failed polls. If the community wanted it, the community would vote for it.
---
Nope, they are wanted and they are needed, maybe not by the people who are using OP things that are getting nerfed obviously but that doesnt mean they arent wanted or needed.
---
The issue is that the way things get introduced into the game is terribly flawed (and Jagex has admitted this, and is a primary reason why theyre forced to do integrity updates) so this idea that "if the community wanted it, the community would vote for it" is a complete logical fallacy.
---
The PvP community has wanted and needed A TON of things to improve the PvP aspect of the game in the past 2+ years. Those things werent voted in not because they werent wanted or needed but, because of the majority of people who DONT EVEN PVP deciding that it wasnt going into the game because they are the bigger part of the voter base(and that snowballed as PvP got more ignored and more people quit/stopped PvPing from the lack of updates and fixes).
---
Regardless of the fact many are incredibly biased, hate PvP, dont even participate in it, or dont know enough/ have enough (or any) experience in it to actually be able to discern between what updates are needed and good for the PvP aspect of the game.
---
**Weird, you dont see people who only PvP and mostly dont PvM or Raid trying to tell people that do, what updates should or shouldnt pass and what needs to be fixed or what doesnt because they dont have the knowledge to make those decisions. Yet on the flip side, the people who rarely ever participate in PvP think its completely fine to decide what is a problem and what needs fixing and what should go into the game when it comes to PvP and actually DID make that happen for 2+ years.**
---
 If you dont like Jagex making integrity updates (which are actually positive things for the overall health of the game) then you shouldnt have spite voted every single PvP update out of existence for years.
---
You made your bed, now you have to lay in it. Dont cry to Jagex about it, youve had your absolute way over controlling everything that went into the game to a fault and now thats being only SLIGHTLY changed and you cant handle it?
---
.70 usd
---
90k an hour if you make it. Not too bad.
---
Some did, some didn‚Äôt. For me the north walk felt longer so even though the north bank is more to the west it felt north. Typing that made me realize how weird it sounds but ¬Ø\\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Huh? That is strange, because it sounds like they spent more time by restricting it to Lumbridge. 
---
They already have the code to stop giving players with low Magical accuracy experience. At -68 magic accuracy you'll never hit anyway, so it won't affect legitimate players. As those players won't be wearing that type of equipment.
---
I like this idea, similar to how they are reworking the GMaul.
---
Tier 50 items that cost 30k shouldn't be BiS spec items.
---
I'm sorry that is tough to understand
---
Lol did you just start playing? there‚Äôs been significant player drops for less.
---
Dude there is a torvesta video where he specifically complains about bulwark and black d hide
---
I forget which YouTuber it is, but it's a YouTuber.
---
Ancestral is 50k risk?
---
Then buff the tier 60 and 70.
---
Man I kept clicking on that at the GE last night! Wondered wtf it was
---
If anything, I would suggest that there a single day per week where the GE is unavailable. Because I'd rather not have to wait to buy key quest items.
---
Mystics are way nore expensive
---
Only the body is 40 def
---
The chaps and vambs are both ONE defence.
---
Doesn't matter that they require 70 range as that is offence, and we're talking about tanking.
---
hardly, 10s snare on a 6t cooldown.
---
The previous version a slash weapon equipped or protect from ranged halved the duration as well.
---
Good alternative IMO
---
My statement stands
---
Took me 2.2k to get my first one. After that I started getting one a task.
---
I would say no, you probably couldn't do it with those stats. With or without poison
---
Presumably it'll requires at least 2 to 5 spaces of inventory to do which is the part I'm sure you haven't thought about. So that's about a fifth of someone's inventory space gone in the wilderness just to put your name on a wall. Then you could rag it but if a clan PKs you they can just use your supplies to tag instead so it's counterproductive.
---
Btw wildy slayer got ruined as a moneymaker, emblems dropped 100k. It's not worth doing anymore.
---
Bro how about just bookmarking the world you wanted to use? Or runehq‚Äôs fast world hopper.
---
Same tbh. The only ones that I still watch and stay subbed to are J1mmy and 9Rain I guess. I never liked the OSRS youtube scene that much anyway, but I think that the quality of most OSRS content has dropped again or just become too repetitive for me.
---
Might just be me though.
---
Yes
---
Im an asocial recluse, so i doubt I'll be publicizing my self any more than i have to here 
---
But maybe :)

Good game
---
honestly, the 500 XP cap + a large GP sink on these items sound great. I'm not a pure but I would be genuinely excited to see this in-game because I think they serve a really key purpose without being op.
---
PVMers want the ability to fight back if possible, PVPers want easy ass kills because some of them are too chickenshit to fight other pvpers and rather to just kill skillers and others who can't fight back.
---
Yah, lets pretend there is PvM dude with 5m risk and i pk with 200m gear (ancestrals, staff and spec weapon).
---
1. Time what it takes to find that dude is long
---
2. Teams chase whole time
---
3. I need to find 5m risk dude 20 times without dying, so i dont lose shit ton of money.
---
All im trying to say is risk doesnt mean reward with current state of wilderness. 
---
I dont complain im just trying to make it clear for you, i pk with 1m risk against other pkers. I cba to try kill bulwark dudes.
---
Say I'm a new player - just joined - everyone in the starting area is attacking these rats? I ask them what they're doing and no one replies? I try and help them out but can't. There's 10s of them there I don't understand. Why is no one answering my questions about this game??
---
Fuck it I'll go back to ________
---
Killing White knights for coins 14 years ago in F2P... THE DAYS
---
huh, I didn't know the elysian was 2 handed tank gear
---
Isn't basicly all gear from pvming?
---
The shield only gives +15 mage def... it's the dhides that make people splash. You shouldn't talk about balancing pvp and revitalizing pvp when you obviously don't participate in any pvp yourself, you're out of your element. No one seems to mention how OP it is to let 3 people dump their d spear speccs on bulwarkers, it can stunlock them for a great period of time and they won't be able to eat through the duration of the stun and get stacked out. This nerf isn't needed and taking down a dinh's is easy enough already with coordination. This mass circlejerk of people mixing up black dhides and dihns defense bonus really shows how misinformed some of the people here are, they just want to create drama and farm karma.
---
Note to self:  befriend jmods

Bad joke
---
Lmaoo the rune med helm on the cork
---
useless and the fact that its not a cox drop anymore
---
You're correct. The stranger will just hang about for a bit and follow someone, nobody but the person he spawned for can attack or be attacked by him though
---
I can‚Äôt believe it.... chestbrah...
---
I wonder what is flagging your accounts so hard? If it's the number of accounts from 1 IP or the client interaction?
---
Regardless, i wish you the best of luck. I enjoy your content, and wish you the best of luck
---
P.s. what are your computer specs? Do you know the best specs to run as many alts as possible?
---
idk if youre just really stupid but when yters make a pk video they leave 90%+ of the escapes out and only show the kills lol
---
When you're clan rushing one guy at revs but even with that much of an advantage you refuse to risk more than salad robes so you can't catch a freeze and cry on the forums because you can't get a 10k split with the boys.
---
At least we can teach noobs new places to splash... Or lure them to 30+ wildy for their 5000 chaos runes.
---
53 prayer is optimal. You do not gain any combat levels on odd prayer levels
---
Alt + escape is not remapped at all. I press both keys.  Winactivatebottom is a different function (basically the reverse of alt + esc, makes cycling back and forth super easy,  barely an inconvenience)
---
How can you learn if you're up against skilled pkers
---
but if it costs 5m it isn't really 'very late game' because you can get it with like 2-8 hours of money making and it requires 75 def. if it required 95+ def, then it would be 'very late game'
---
Wake up
---
70k after 2k hours
---
You could always flinch that lil ho
---
&gt; Yeah because there are totally no racist or toxic people in any other part of the game.
---
&gt; 
---
Lmao, I love how this is the go to defense for so many people.
---
It's way worse in pvp, and anybody who has skilled/pvmed/pked knows it.
---
Yeah you get weirdos ranting at you at resource/boss spots every now and then, but it doesn't even come close to stepping into a bh world or having a deep wildy team in salad robes target you.
---
I feel like when I was 10 I used to go to west bank to bank coal from mining guild
---
Pking in pvp worlds isn't the same as being in deep wildy. You realize in edge/ge pvp world pking you can tab whenever you want. You probably thought your comment was highly intelligent when you clicked save.
---
That's not how balancing works. A quick buff to high tiers is a lazy solution and cause way more problems.
---
Wait what
---
It's almost like it's the highest level shield in the game and is made specifically for tanking only and completely removes the ability to fight back.
---
I'd be inclined to say it's more than just a few. This was in the span of an hour... and I imagine it'll only get worse when the non-pkers are done with the activity.
---
As far as I'm concerned none of the pitched rewards are worth coming back.
---
No guide master race
---
Yes it sections those best blood is closer to the city
---
Well shit I'll stop using my alt to boost cw then, not bigbrain enough to have been doing Meesrs splashing but absolutely have been standing there dancing with my self for 20 mins regularly haha.
---
Anyone who doesn't subscribe to 25 buttholes WITH THE QUICKNESS will be slapped and sent back to lumbridge to kill cows for cowhide. See you at the tannery in Al kharid, goblin bois
---
Why does that sound at all reasonable to you? Because you‚Äôve tricked someone with it before? The only reason accounts can look the same is because of game mechanics. If you were randomly set a name and looks like at birth you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that. If the game locked on or tagged the person you were fighting by simply even changing their name color it wouldn‚Äôt happen. irl you can‚Äôt have someone magically spawn underneath you and require attacking you by right clicking now. irl i‚Äôm not going to let you walk 10 feet out of my game rendering distance and then be confused because two people are occupying the same space at the same time.
---
Because you're rigging mini-games. Doesn't matter if you're alone or not.
---
Every day we stray further from Saradomin's light
---
Isn‚Äôt she black
---
I believe one of the mods posted a top 100 list on twitter at one point but I could just be smoking that dwarf weed
---
but its a dead mini game now right?
---
Truuuue that. Makes you wonder what detections are really in place such that blatant cheaters can get away meanwhile authentic gameplay can get false flagged.
---
Meanwhile RNG #2,147,483,647 is still standing there
---
Did they actually do away with splashing?
---
By far the most popular and populated private server on the best wow expansion lmfao?
---
You wanna say fucking bfa retail is better than wotlk?
---
Seems kind of fun tbh. Here's a spitball idea for how something like this could work as a full feature / pesudo-minigame-
---
So picture that there's a wilderness castle or the rogues castle or whatever out in the wilderness that can be "claimed" similar to a capture the point game. Maybe this is destroying enemy flags in the castle and setting up your own, or maybe it's just occupying the castle by standing in it with your team with no other enemies in it. As your team 'owns' the castle it slowly generates resources/gp similar to managing miscellania but at a higher rate. You can then retrieve these resources/gp *from* the castle, but you still have to make it all the way south to actually deposit it safely so you have to establish some envoy or caravan to get it down there from would-be pillagers. 
---
Everything is balanced for the amount of players. Just having one player occupy the castle generates resources quite slowly. Having many makes them generate faster, but also causes criers and other sources of information to announce that the castle is occupied by whatever force. This makes it so you can't just hop until you find a dead server and sit on it alone because your income would probably be less than just hunting black chins with roughly the same risk. Of course, the more people sit on the castle, the more resources have to be split, so comparatively smaller clans are incentivized to take down bigger clans since they get a larger cut of the profits each. 
---
I think it would really invigorate the wildy. Give people a ready to always be there and always have different fights and conflicts going on at a time.
---
Sure but the difference is you'd only need to attack yourself once a minute and you'd be invincible
---
My words seem to bothering you. Why don't you just block me on reddit?
---
Hector says Buenos Noches
---
&gt;But so is killing me while I have no intention to pvp.
---
Once your cross the ditch you have every intention to pvp. It's like playing a game of tag then complaining at the tagger for tagging you.
---
You can interact with alts. That's such an archaic rule that was never enforced anyway. It's because you're rigging mini-games. Jagex doesn't really ban for rigging cws alone either though. Now if you were trying to rig the matches in the official worlds that would def be different.
---
meanwhile, dicers
---
you cannot seriously imply that reddit's voting system is good, what you're refering to is "downvote what i don't like and move on" which is everything reddit is about
---
Do you have the level for it?
---
Wow this update is incredible, only thing that won't pass is bolas which is probably a good thing.
---
I did go back and read it another time, and I think the wording is very poor. I'd like to believe that it is akin to the first time they discussed these lamps, limited to 500 XP per skill.
---
Although it is not clear and some clarification is needed sooner rather than later so that more people see which is meant.
---
If someone hits you, you are legally allowed to defend yourself. What if she came at him with a knife? We are only getting one side of the story here. Yes you shouldn't hit women obviously we all know this. But you need to get both sides of the story before making assumptions.
---
let's just remove pvp ok
---
Not at all dude. I'm sitting here at work just chatting.
---
It does affect them. Many of the polls just make it easier to die in the wildy. Why would people vote yes to dying easier?
---
Obviously. But you don't need much def either. Why not have the accuracy.
---
Yeah theres only so much you can with this game. Swamp and j1mmys videos are carried by their personalities and video making skills. No way i would watch someone do quests but j1mmys commentary makes it hilarious.
---
Oh good point on the hoarders. That can easily be mitigated by replacing with alch value since it is already at alch value.
---
Rambling was good, I have to agree with the post
---
I want to chat to. Can't exactly do that with public off.
---
You can tank most of the melee brothers easily with decent defense. I personally just use d'hide to get the bit of extra accuracy on Ahrims where it helps more imo as well as the better defense.
---
You monster
---
There is very little merit to killing revs without a clan or a tanky main
---
Maybe they should buff activities where both people are interested in PVPing (PVP worlds, bounty hunting, castle wars, clan wars, things like that).
---
Defend your own argument, coward
---
Should probably have a walking RS3 logo in nmz then.
---
Que?
---
Lmao what?
---
It just is
---
There are many "steps in the right direction" that can be made imo. Pj timers, that recent suggestion of "attack option only visible when it won't skull me," fixing abusable 1-way safespots and single-multi bh target tele lures, etc.
---
But I don't think pvp will really be in a *good* state until big changes are made. Bandaids can only do so much. Moving pvm content out of the wildy, having pvp armor/weapons come from pvp-related challenges in the wildy (*after* pvm content has been removed from the wildy, so pvmers have no need to go there and don't vote no to pvp updates for their own benefit), and making high level pvp gear *way fucking better* in comparison to low level gear in order to actually make it worth risking are all changes that would have difficulty passing a poll, but would drastically alter the stale and dying landscape that is pvp, hopefully for the better.
---
Keep clicking innocent people minding their own business trying to train cause everyone thinks you‚Äôre a shitlord anyways and you can‚Äôt do anything about it. :)
---
Eric Hansen going hard on these kids
---
There is roughly +9 in all defensive stats compared to Varrock armour 1. Same magic def and only +6 crush def difference.
---
The stat difference is Steel platebody vs Black platebody.
---
Did it last night on my alt and runelite literally highlights everything you need to click, shit is so easy
---
As someone farming chaos ele recently. This. I can hold my own and I have a little fun trying to 1v1 if I‚Äôm getting attacked. But the last few nights have just been 1v1 for ~30sec then poof. 4+ more show up with heavy ballistas or barrages and it‚Äôs just in poor sportsmanship imo. I mean you‚Äôre fighting a guy with craws bow + dds. Yet I‚Äôm holding my own with just curry so you gotta call your goon squad since your pride is clearly shattered? Do these herds of brainless, dickless pkers have no code of honor? I‚Äôm ok losing fights, but when y‚Äôall stand there for 20-30 seconds watching me hold my own then dogpile the second your boy gets under 40%. It‚Äôs just in poor taste. It‚Äôs why no one goes solo to the rev caves since it‚Äôs just 90000 scouters. I wish the wildy had more ‚Äúsolo‚Äù content to deal with but as it stands I cbf to really farm Shit out there. It was a nice change of pace but I guess I‚Äôll go back to hydra or start learning raids at this point since most of the interesting stuff in wildy is in multi.
---
Came here to say this, heartbeat scanner deployed.
---
Maybe we should jus nerf dhide and introduce a more expensive higher leveled version with the stats of black dhide as is rn. Black dhide is pretty OP for the cost lmao.
---
That is one of the dumbest things I have ever read of course you haven't been skull tricked when you are PKing, you can't be skull tricked when you have a skull already.
---
And if you are chin hunting or pvming you probably aren't fighting back if you do get attacked, which makes it impossible to get skull tricked as well.
---
The whole problem with skull tricking is that is gives people absolutely no incentive to bring decent gear to fight back against PKers with because while they are risking 20k with their salad robes you are risking getting skulled and losing millions.
---
You can only get skull tricked if you are fighting back, which is exactly why there is no incentive to ever fight back.
---
lmao what
---
Has anyone got some zulrah tips for me, it's not going well
---
Exactly. And I'm not blaming the content creators I unsubbed for being bad or unoriginal etc, but I just didn't watch their videos anymore.
---
And yeah ofc I still follow Settled, been subbed since he uploaded episode 1 of swampy.
---
Castle wars or clan wars? Not just pugs in those, but those community ran competitive versions of them
---
well then I guess you don't have any issues with wildy being dead as fuck and pkers only attacking pvmers
---
L0000L sit u little virgin sensitive cry baby go play club penguin and fortnite u queerbag

I can't wait for the day you forget to bank your cash stack and get clapped with a quickness. Maybe you'll even end up on the "fake" vids.
---
Would you like some beans with your fish or will you Avarice?
---
The idea was they don‚Äôt want people splashing in lumby specifically because it‚Äôs confusing and weird as shit to new players trying to figure out the game.
---
Ironmen can't use the herb boxes from nmz if that's what you mean
---
not jagex, it's you. If you have 2fa, they must have accessed your emails. They can't just hack your account and bypass authenticator, it doesn't work like that
---
I prefer Ironman. Regular osrs was a bit boring. And also your counter points are pretty weak.
---
Then it would have the same mechanics as the quest cape when a new quest cape. If you have a quest cape and a new quest is released, then it will automatically unequip to your inventory. If there is no space in your inventory, it will unequip to your bank. If there is no space in your bank, then it will be destroyed. You also won't be able to use the quest cape to teleport to the Legends' Guild until you've completed the new quest.
---
You don't have to play this game you know
---
Some trash talk and some are just legit assholes, put public off mate don't let them turn you away from the game mode it'll be a great game mode for learning the ropes
---
Of course
---
Pk bad shield good. I just came back to osrs 2 weeks ago and this is all the subreddit has had to say
---
It was definitely a fun game, but I wasnt a fan of the rewards.
---
Different rewards, and it'd get my yes in the polls
---
On your second point the post is talking about magical defense. At the moment mage defense is dependent on your mage level 70% and def level 30%. Idk if I‚Äôm confused on your wording but it sounds like you‚Äôre saying you don‚Äôt like that mage level is involved in defense and should be lowered. That is exactly what they‚Äôre doing.
---
Since the final stream usually hits 100k+ viewers with their offixial stream + individual streams I'd imagine somewhere in the few millions area for the week.
---
No, I'm a skiller. If you join them other people are just going to see a bunch of whiny PvPers.
---
And it‚Äôs not like splashes can‚Äôt go splash somewhere else now. I used to think it was silly until I got into some other games and felt bad not gaining exp until I started splashing to use up my ridiculous mind rune stack haha. No qualms with it now!
---
Neither compare to wildly PvP. If you‚Äôre thinking of sending someone to castle wars I really think that speaks for itself
---
Well worded, although you'll probably get downvoted anyway because you're not joining the hivemind against pkers
---
Skull tricking is equivalent to scamming/luring imo. The game mechanics are supposed to let you protect at least 3 items... People shouldn‚Äôt have to bring less risk because some asshat decided to log in under them, have similar names, etc. Skull trickers are just as scummy as lurers and scammers.
---
Big oof. Copying top post to the point it‚Äôs near exact copy. Nice.

yea, a lamp at the end would be nice or something similar to make it optional
---
I've still never been there, why is it disappointing?
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Okay so maybe we shouldn't rely on the same OP spell to get every single kill? You don't need to nerf a PvMer's only defense because PKers have to use the same spell everytime and cannot adapt to the situation at hand.
---
gz, got mine yesterday aswell at ~1700kc
---
I think a big step is removing the ability for teams to do what OP described in singles, where they have a dedicated tb/freezer then just smack you with specs one after the other. I'm not sure how that's implemented but it definitely needs to happen in some fashion or people will never have an incentive to risk in singles without a team.
---
Means no to artisan
---

---
[no it doesnt?](https://i.imgur.com/32aDJe0.jpg)
---
Saying the gmaul isn't OP is a hilarious joke. There is a reason the meta for pking in PvP worlds is AGS/Gmaul. Its inaccurate sure but it's by far the best spec weapon under 10m. And the fact it's so dirt cheap is why you have hundreds of rushers using it without any risk. 
---
For something to be the meta from lvl 50 thru the endgame pking is a joke. Even disregarding it's price.
---
This
---
...what? Do you struggle with simple logic or is English not your first language or something? It‚Äôs gotta be one of the two. 
---
So because people DONT even use magic cape on random PvMers a large majority of the time, that means it should be nerfed....??? You‚Äôre saying the things that people DO use it for should suffer because people aren‚Äôt using it against PvMers enough? You realize that makes ABSOLUTELY ZERO SENSE right? Like that may be one of single dumbest things I‚Äôve heard on this sub lmao. 
---
PKers use magic cape switch PRIMARILY against other pkers BTW. No PKers complaining about it either since you can only use it 5 times. 
---
And what exactly does a mage capes price have to do with a bulwarks price again..? And no, getting 99 magic is definitely harder than just buying a fucking bulwark for 6m LOL. Jesus Christ start using your brain dude. 
---
Why do I care that Bulwark got nerfed? Ummm because it needs to get nerfed, duh lmao? It‚Äôs INCREDIBLY strong in singles PKing and singles is all I really care about. Not my fault Jagex cant actually nerf it an even noticeable amount because PvMers would literally have full on seizures if it was actually balanced. Just look at how you and others have responded to a minuscule nerf...the thing is going to be virtually unchanged in effectiveness in Singles and people are acting like Jagex just literally cut the shield in half LOL.
---
It's just a bunch of empty dilapidated buildings. It's also sort of a 3D maze where you have to go up and down levels to get around. 
---
I expected NYC and got Pripyat.

---
If your defense &gt; magic, you're getting buffed. For most accounts this won't be a big change.
---
Hell, at 70def-99mage you'll only go from 90 to 84.5 "defensive".
---
we're already wasting time playing the game.
---
Not Morton cus the infected blood makes them sick

---
Haven't played in a while, what is spec swapping?
---
But that guy didn‚Äôt dress up as a fish
---
All PKers really want is people to stand there and drop loot. They don‚Äôt want challenge, they dont want to earn a reward. If PKers had the ability to freeze everyones game and spec down AFK player models, they all would.
---
That‚Äôs why all the meta is cheese. 10 people log in and freeze/tele block/spec one person, are you really surprised when they vote no to PvP updates that would make it easier for you? Especially with things like skull tricking and abusing GE values.
---
In all the time Ive spent in the wilderness I can count the number of times Ive been PKed without being frozen/teleblocked on one hand. Its 1. Out of like 75+. Then I see people complaining that no one risks more than ~150k at Revs. Gee I wonder why! /s
---
That makes it even worse if they are the best pkers in God gear and people still get away the large majority of the time
---
It doesn't drain your bank account if you actively partake in it. That's what's wrong with MTX, people get into serious financial trouble with it. It also doesn't give you a paid advantage ingame.
---
Addictions a bitch lol
---
I have a bad issue with needing the best gear for the job. I knew I'd be maging everything in quests and wanted MA2 as it's BIS.
---
It would be but the lag would be awful I bet
---
Cool. I'm glad you like video guides. You do you, I'll do me.
---
Firstly I would disagree that the shield takes away all risk, people farming resources with the bulwark can still die though it is unlikely, and if they would be doing wildy bosses then the player would be in multi combat so the risk of getting attacking and killed by a group is always there.
---
I would also argue that there is already an inherent risk/reward difference between people looking to kill players for their loot, and people who want to slay a boss or grind a resource regardless of gear. PVP is all about the risk of not getting a kill, dying or the enemy not having good loot, for the potential payoff of a lot of money, while skilling is no risk of not getting paid outside of getting PKed, but for a more consistent income, and bossing is sort of a middle ground I suppose. 
---
Sure you might only have a 1/20 chance of killing a chin farming with a Bulwark with low level magic gear, or a 1/5 if you have equal tier (which to be fair is much more expensive) magic gear. But the potential reward is to get a hours worth of farming in about 3 minutes, or if they are bossing, some of the gear they used as well.
---
The problem with punishing people for abusing alts in cws is it's kind of hard to track. And then even if they have the means to track it well enough, is it really worth the effort it would detract from other areas?
---
Low level bounty hunter abusers aren't even banned all that often and that has actual impact to the economy. Why would they bother with castle wars when it's less obvious to notice abuse than bounty hunter?
---
I'd like some of that fun, pls.
---

---
My seed is recharged
---
I'm not those people
---
Well said. As a PVMer if Jagex could implement a way to eliminate the chance of getting skull tricked I would absolutely fight back when doing wildy activities. I really hope they take all of this feedback into account.
---
That's only one thing wrong with mtx. Theres plenty more wrong, like diminishing the integrity of the game.
---
Okay now i‚Äôm actually interested in the original
---
Lmao what adaption?
---
That is the only spell we can use, by your logic we would have to use standard, not be able to freeze because entangle is god awful 14 seconds(7if u flick pray mage after freeze immunity wears off) and it deals no damage
---
we then have to either bring rune pouch or waste 7 inventory slots on just runes
---
Then we must bring a tome of fire to make fire surge even worth using 
---
Are you nuts? You want us to risk more for less while you risk less for more
---
 what kind of myopic logic is that?
---
Yet Again people not understanding spewing more  nonsense
---
I think it's a good idea but the wording just makes you sound lazy. Also, it won't happen because it means less money for Jagex.
---
jesus Serene shut up

So you played on average 8.5 hours a day for a year? Do you have a job?

I'm not exactly sure how powerful defensive stats are but with a pretty cheap defensive setup swapping dinh's for DFS + Ivanids flail I go from 377Slash-&gt;311 120mage-&gt;120mage 398range-&gt;322 range seems barely noticeable
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand these posts. It‚Äôs still going to be like impossible to kill a pvmer with half a brain that has dihns and food if you‚Äôre a single pker. Also what content are people frequently doing with dihn‚Äôs that has everyone so stressed out about this? I literally never pk, only pvm, but I genuinely just don‚Äôt understand. The item will always be worthless based on how this game is played. It has a single niche which it was too strong at and they toned it down, but it‚Äôs still ridiculously strong in that niche. And the argument about pkers not risking enough like... what do you expect them to risk 10m to pk someone risking 300k just to get logged in on by a team and destroyed because the state of pvp in this game is atrociously bad? Idk man idk.  I think pking pvmers is the biggest waste of time and youre an absolute moron for doing it but I also think everyone having a fit about dihn‚Äôs is equally dense.

Every update in the wild to revive it involved adding pvm/skiller content for pkers to go kill, I wish just once they'd put their brains together and try to revive it with the mindset of pker vs pker.

Toxic trident will help a lot for dps. You should have the stats for it, it just takes a while to get used to zulrah.
---
Once you start to get to know the rotations you will take a lot less damage and figure out how to max your dps (for example, you‚Äôll learn how many hits you get on each phase and when to start switching so that you can hit the next phase immediately).
---
Your gear and stats can obviously be improved, but you should be ok once you get more practice! Stick with it
---
PvMers have a powerful defensive tool that allows them to tank long enough to get away? That‚Äôs how it is.
---
First of all. I can‚Äôt take you seriously with those ‚ÄòLOl‚Äô and smilies.

Secondly, they were forced by the credit card companies, because too many stolen credit cards were used in the game. They had to come up with a solution quickly, so they made one.

Thirdly, they made the game, why are you so sure they‚Äôre ill-equipped to handle their own game.

'In moderation', yes I agree that's ok. But what I'm worried is Jagex not doing it in moderation (given their track record with MTX on RS3. Remember when they said a couple times they'll tone it down?)
---
Or they'll do it in moderation but then overdo it further in the future - hence the 'slippery slope'.
---
Haha nice, did you get em tho?

I've found guides for us all (G4A) to be an enjoyable boy.

Trick and scam are just semantics.  Luring doesn't get banned by people, why is that frowned upon?  Abusing dspear mechanics with smite didn't result in bans why was that patched?  Why do people insist that clans with ancient mace is a problem?  Don't bring a +1 if you don't like it...
---
But skulling is the mechanic when you attack and initiate a fight. Tricking people to get them to skull when they're defending is certainly not the spirit of being skulled, and it's just plain scamming.

Bro, just remove splashing! It‚Äôs clearly a negative. The only decent thing that comes from it is that pures can level magic without leveling HP. If you want that to stay possible, add a new method of doing that, but just remove this super gimmicky leveling method.
---
It‚Äôs easy too, just raise the magic accuracy of armor so that you can‚Äôt reach the -57 magic threshold.
---
No, not if you are on a pvp server.
---
But that's not really a fair comparison. Lvling in wow is a lot different than in runescape. Players will need to go into specific areas to progress where the levels are appropriate and pvp will be flagged. in runescape you can avoid the wilderness altogether if you so chose. Nobody is making you 3 item that clue scroll, you don't even have to do the step. You want to and by going over the ditch you assume the risk. Same as selecting a pvp server to play on.
---
Getting ganked isnt always fun, but same goes for spade running for a clue scroll.
---
Same, until I found out about limiting FPS from this thread.
---
My phone used to heat up quick too, that‚Äôs why I would never play before on mobile.

Yea league is like taking hits of crack.

Amazing, nothing better than when you carry 1v5, but earth-shatteringly tilting when not only does your team int, but you are the one inting the hardest because of how tilted you are, and you are literally shaking, because you are so mad, but you can't stop playing.  
---
You just want another hit, so you queue up and start the cycle again.
---
I know I understand that. But then do you really think the guy I replied to would say something different to a person complaining about dying in the wildy with nothing on? Probably not. He‚Äôd also say ‚Äúit‚Äôs the wilderness, dying happens. Don‚Äôt go there if you don‚Äôt wanna die‚Äù cause it‚Äôs true for the most part. But if we can agree on that, then it‚Äôs ridiculous to make fun of someone for being ‚Äúshook‚Äù when instead of accepting death thanks to that advice they decide to take it up on the second part and just don‚Äôt go to the wildy.
---
Another question does the 109% more crops apply if u have the magic secateurs unequiped in inventory?

It should take skill tanking a 5 man team, not a 6m defensive item.

"hop idiot Ive been here all day just had to run a marathon quick"
---
Yeah 10 year old me just picked a number I liked lol.
---
Wow.. i cant afford that shield but i wouldve sold it after this update..
---
Bolas are meant to be a defensive tool against pkers, because they'll only require 1 inventory slot to use and black d'hide boosts their accuracy, while the person trying to freeze you will be in robes.
---
Hasta luego virgins
---
Jesus Christ you really need to brush up on your reading comprehension. Where did I attempt to justify it or say it‚Äôs fine? 
---
I pointed out people need to stop acting like this is some super common occurrence in PvP or like it‚Äôs something that is unique to PvP. It happens just as often with the PvMers that get killed by pvpers who just get irrationally mad.
---
Game shouldnt be balanced around peopleimiting themselves.
---
Haiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
Count urself lucky if it was me who hacked u I would have dropped ur Abby demon heads
---
Cuz it still wins even if its nerfed to half its stats.
---
As purely a pvm player I have no issues with that. My ironman will suffer a bit but it's not a big deal
---
6m is a lot to bring into the wildy. That's like saying staff of the dead isn't that pricey, or that it doesn't make sense that everyone isn't wearing serp helms and fury amulets in wildy
---
But you aren‚Äôt actually risking 2m+ because they aren‚Äôt fighting you back.
---
I remember that client required a 1024x768 screen resolution. I always used 800x600 and didnt like how much smaller everything looked on 1024x768, so I stayed with the official client at 800x600.

If you kill Olbertus, he should give you a chat option to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you with the cursed alter so that you receive or don‚Äôt receive pray xp

&gt; you know the drama is just about the fact it wasn't polled right? the shield will be used literally just as much for the same shit and the nerf will have ~~0~~1% effect on gameplay.
---
Fixed that for ya
---
mmmf I love stinky elf feet thanks for the fap material kind stranger!
---
I think the issue is people(you included based on the post) act like its some end all, be all tank weapon. It helps a lot, but it's nowhere near impossible to kill someone with a Dinh's. As someone who frequents the wildy altar, I see dinhs get stacked out often. If people quit just because someone pulls out a nice shield, I'm blaming the pker not the shield.
---
Honestly this might not be a good idea, there's not a good amount of people that still play this mini game As it is. Doing that will make it really hard to put together a team.
---
Good, hope your remaining accounts and any new accounts you make going forward all get banned as well.

Yeah I would agree with this. It gives such a bad impression to new players. It's like 'Welcome to OSRS - you don't even have to be looking at the screen for 10 minutes to level up!'
---
i fight back and anti pk when im pvming or chinning all the time lmao most pkers are clueless and free loot. pvmers would know that if they literally ever fought back
---
Just cleared my 4th reset! Must have just been where I was standing!
---
Man that's ridiculous bahahah!
---
Thanks a ton I'm freakin amped now!
---
And those great memes never come from the massive circlejerks. Every now and then you see some gems.
---
what lol
---
With a Dinh‚Äôs the risk is low *in comparison* to the pker. Not in general. You‚Äôre over exaggerating Dinh‚Äôs. For equal gold investment you can have more magic attack and 15% damage boost as your weapon and offhand than the other person has defense with Dinh‚Äôs by far. The difference is the 7-10m you spend on that weapon and offhand is risked because of skulling. The Dinh‚Äôs person doesn‚Äôt risk it. That‚Äôs how skulling works.
---
The average solo pker doesn‚Äôt attack someone with Dinh‚Äôs because the average solo pker will not do what I described above. Risking 7-10m is a lot for most people. So rarely will the average person be on equal footing with the person holding Dinh‚Äôs. But again, that‚Äôs an issue of skulling, not Dinh‚Äôs. To have an even fight the pker has to risk about 7-10m more than the pvmer. But that‚Äôs literally SKULLING. It‚Äôs a mechanic in the game, and the higher gear the non skulled person has the more you have to risk when you skull. It‚Äôs just only noticeable with an expensive item like Dinh‚Äôs. Because assuming you as the pker risk what the other person saves in terms of gold, with Dinh‚Äôs you risk 7-10m for an equal match. But if they had just dhide you don‚Äôt need to risk nearly as much to have an even fight. 
---
Peoples issue is with skulling, they just don‚Äôt realize it until the unskulled person is wearing something as expensive as Dinh‚Äôs and they are expected to risk something equivalent for an even fight.
---
to me this is a buff to the pvm scene in the wildy and anyone else that doesnt build a 1 defense account to abuse the cmb level calculation. 
---
it rewards people who train defense by making the stat better at buffing your defence, which imo should be the case. From the wiki
---
&gt;&gt;Defence
---
&gt;Defence is by far the most commonly suppressed skill. While like all skills, it has its pros and cons, most pures generally agree that the cons outweigh the pros. Some pures choose certain levels, including 10, 13, 20, 40, 42, or 45 Defence to have immense power compared to main accounts of the same level. The Rune Pure, for example, can obtain armour that has nearly the same Strength bonus as a maxed account with 99 Defence.
---
&gt;Pros of having high Defence
---
&gt;* If your Defence level is high, you won't have to buy as much food for PvP or PvM situations. Also you can train on higher level monsters much more easily.
---
&gt;* The higher your Defence level, the less likely you will get hit. This will enable you to tank easier in team PvP situations. Low-Defence pures have an extremely difficult time tanking because of their lower defensive stats.
---
&gt;* You will be able to wear better armour with higher defensive stats. This will make you even less likely to get hit.
---
&gt; Cons of having high Defence
---
&gt; Being a Defence pure mainly has two big cons. These are that if you have low offensive stats, it will be harder to level up (getting less XP per average hit), which makes creating a high-levelled Defence pure very time consuming. Also, if you have low offensive stats as a Defence pure, it is harder to win a 1v1 fight, as you will hit very low on your opponent, while the opponent might have methods like using a Ring of recoil, Vengeance, Verac's armour or another method that could hit through Defence.
---
I've pretty much stopped playing with this new wave of hacked accounts and negligent customer service. This game is dying and it's a brutal, slow death, but quite inevitable.
---
skull tricking happens so infrequently, and if you are paying attention at all you can tell that something sketchy is going on lmao
---
I have a 2018 Macbook Pro i9 with 16GB and it still runs extremely hot. Honestly kind of scares me to continue playing on it.
---
But ranged doesn't have that disadvantage when attacking melee users at all, because any melee armor that protects against ranged as well as black d'hide protects against magic is significantly more expensive that black d'hide.  So Ranged doesn't have to deal with black d'hide equivalent, 13k t70 melee armor when attacking, but they get it against mages?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d0akyotRrOw
---
Is a good starting point. He covers some pretty cheap/effective methods with helm variants. I think this gets the point across.
---
Turns out it's a common issue and they advise to wait 24h for it to solve itself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah well that's their own fault
---
literally everyone who pked srsly had pretty much every max build, you could bot 247 without ban and gold was dirt cheap
---
The fact that it happens at all means why should I fight back. There's literally no incentive to fight back
---
If you don't like Dinh's stop being a little crybaby bitch and don't attack people wearing it. Fucking mongoloid retard smoothbrain cousin-fucker
---
You can't really compare cheating in multiplayer games, to someone who has set out to PK someone fighting a PvM in wildy.
---
The person doing PvM still has the chance/opportunity to escape. Killing PvMers is PvP ? PvP literally stands for Player vs Player. Ergo by definition whether it's a one sided fight or an even fight it is still PvP. Again you're spouting nonsense, easy and free money? No. Supplies are still used attacking an opponent, and ultimately if someone either A) doesn't fight back or B) doesn't try to run away/log out. Then that's on them not me. 
---
I honestly don't get the hate against pking on this sub, considering the wilderness/pking has been an integral part of runescape for as long as I can remember.
---
TL:DR. If you can't handle the pressure of potentially being attacked/killed in the wild, don't go in. Simple.
---
"it is hard for me to kill an npc while watching my minimap so they should make things easier for me"
---
just because you are bad at something doesn't mean it is unfairly hard
---
I've heard zerkers or whatever be referred to as say 45 def pures or 'void pure' for 42 stats
---
Something which is becoming increasingly harder to do. Some game companies aren't even making physical copies anymore
---
That's your anecdotal experience. My anecdotal experience is the opposite. When I pk pvmers, or when I see other teams pk pvmers, or when I'm a pvmer and I'm getting pked, the majority of the time I see people go after the biggest target they can feasibly taken down.
---
Now you may decide that because a pair of 103s isn't targeting a maxed combat account they are "only going for the smallest fish", and if that's the case then you're simply twisting the logic. But in the wild I usually see the smaller fish go ignored -- the thought being bigger fish usually carry more loot or get more cocky between banks.
---
Well, aren't you already locked out of content because you chose to do so? We should just let pures have all BIS but at any level they'd like. Why not? Don't wanna keep tens of thousands of people from enjoying all the content. Let's also drop all the requirements from quests and diaries. Not fair unless everyone can do them and keep the same build!
---
If you're shit, maybe.
---
A real fix could be slightly nerfing the defensive stats, and increasing the damage reduction in PvE.  Then it could still be useful for future raids, and still be useful for pvp protection, but not as much
---
slash bonus so imbued warrior would help a little, as well as getting 99 attack if youre not.

if you go into the wildy (a pvp zone) completely unprepared for pvp, then how can you be mad if you die to someone who is geared specifically for pvp? how many times have you been skull tricked? it happens very infrequently and is super obvious if you are paying any attention.
---
but . . . i'm not a sane person??

Invest in your account?

Aye same, it‚Äôs the link with promotional stuff that makes it toxic for me

10 seconds is an exaggeration when your cast time alone is around 3 seconds per cast. It takes about a minute. And you‚Äôre exaggerating the profit. The average clue scroller drops a spade and maybe a glory or something if somehow they didn‚Äôt just protect it. So like 20k in a minute? Congrats, you‚Äôre making less gold than most pvm content. Clearly you‚Äôre not killing them for gold. You‚Äôre killing them for fun and see the gold as a bonus. But again, why on earth you see killing something that does nothing but run away as fun is beyond me.
---
Still for $600 US which is the equivalent to 800 Australian you should be getting more than a dual core. Dual core is old technology but if you're only going to run runescape and nothing else then I guess get the dual core. Personally the lowest number of cores I'd look for is 4.
---
I've never been skulltricked but just knowing it's possible is enough to make me never fight back in the wildy.
---
Ah right, I always remember a 3rd party client like SS/SS that had a gold and white theme, can't remember the name though.
---
mhm yeah I know some of these words
---
Yea i can take some gp too

But group a's increased fun is based on the increased risk that justifies the higher rewards in the first place...

its not like zammy halo etc takes long. its a 10 hour grind, less than void lol
---
LMS is so luck based
---
omfg thank you this post makes so much more sense now
---
How did my dream from last night end up on here?
---
literally no incentive other than killing the pker and getting his loot, while also not dying yourself. and before you say "omg its all salad robes warriors risking 20k", i pk in a not very expensive setup and i risk 450k+ even if i protect item. Even in absolute povety gear with full xericians with a rune crossbow/dhide swap the risk is 250k+
---
I don‚Äôt know him personally, but what other reply do you imagine he could give. It‚Äôs true that if you go in the wilderness you can die. And that if you don‚Äôt want to die like that, just don‚Äôt go to the wilderness. These are facts, it‚Äôs like calling water wet. ‚ÄúWater is wet‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou can die in the wilderness‚Äù

Omg yes please

Wilderness is for risky slayer, god capes, boss fighting, gathering resources limited to the wilderness i.e dark crabs and yes pking, with jaxex releasing slayer keys they clearly want pvmers there as well. To think its only for pkers is retarded, boo woo you cant kill someone in bis defence gear in &lt;100k gear lol

---
Ancient staff  85k
---
Glory 15k
---
Even for the good setup, that's 500k with spirit shield and a +1. No +1 is 300k. +1 and rune kite is 380k.
---
In what world is that 600-1m? You bringing thousands of casts?
---
if you are so afraid of being skull tricked that you don't want to fight back, then either dont bring your 3 most expensive items to the wildy, or dont go to the wildy at all. If you get skull tricked it is because you made a mistake, if you dont want to risk making that mistake then just dont go to the one area in the game that you can make that mistake in.
---
They're on the same plane, they're way North of the wildy. There's maps out there of it
---
Why do you want to kill someone so bad who isn't risking
---
Yep, but also the community.  Soup, a popular content creator, laughed at that specific idea, alongside Framed.  It's insane that strong voices in the community are pro-scamming just because they're pkers and they like to skull trick.
---
Majority of PvP interaction is between Pkers on BH and PvP worlds. Minority of interaction is between PvPer and PvMer in the wilderness. Though if you are only a PvMer or Skiller, you will only see the PvMer x PvPer interaction. If you don't pk, you'll never see the pker vs pker interactions, because you have no reason to be in those places.
---
This is simple bias.
---
It's not impressive.  What they did is.  Duh
---
or...and see if you can keep up with this point....the issue of the shield being too strong and pvp needing some love to help revitalize it can both exist at the same time, and neither one nor the other is the solution to either problem.
---
So I should use a PK inventory setup for wildy bossing then, right? I forgot that bosses and players are always the same set up.
---
It's not the frequency that matters. If something is sitting on an oven, and 9 times out of 10 it's not hot, it still will burn me once. So I probably won't grab the metal part, cause that shit is gonna hurt.  Same idea. Fighting back is fine until you are tricked, and then you get burned by subversion.
---
Don't risk anything, expect to die and be happy when you didn't. It's not rocket science so you don't get many differing answers
---
No, you're just wrong. Market price of an item, *especially* crafted items, has, and should have, 0 correlation to the power of the item. Supply and demand is what decides how expensive items are. That demand changes based on the power of the item, yes, but the power of the item doesn't change based on the price.
---
Was rapier more powerful when it was 300m+?
---
Did craws suddenly become shit when it went below 30m?
---
No. They simply became more common, and price fell. Black d'hide is incredibly common, and because of that availability it is inexpensive.
---
The gear itself follows a fairly linear progression of armor tiers up from green d'hides, just like their melee counterparts.
---
It‚Äôs in game, look for the wrench üîß tab
---
Finally a use for coloured firelighters!
---
If this is how they treat me after I vote yes to all pvp updates then I don't want the bulwark to get nerfed.
---
Considering you can't take any items in it should be a safe death
---
Just updated to Mac OS 10.14.5 and this has started happening, any fixes?
---
The majority of the post I didn't read I knew it was troll. Just 2nd guessing the edit cuz someone stupid enough to make such a dumb troll post might also be dumb enough to get skull tricked
---
and those ones cant kill my grandma, so who cares about them? not to mention 100k is more than most pvmers risk lol, which is fine, i dont risk much when i wildy pvm either. But if you wear full black dhide (which costs \~20k) you should almost never die to anyone who is risking 100k pking
---
Because Bulwark is the most niche item in the game, probably
---
Yeah man. If I'm risking 40k in equipment and supplies, I should be able to take down any pvmer that comes my way. You just need to understand the way things should be.
---
I know wildy slayer is more pts/h than Turael/Duradel, plenty of people have tested it and compared them. Most wildy slayer tasks are small and on low level monsters. Cannoning 60 scorpions in the wildy is pretty much just as fast as a task from Turael. It's only when she gives you fire giants or something that you'd skip, or do it slowly.
---
Not sure about Konar, idk if anyone has tested that, but I have my doubts since he can give really slow tasks too. 
---
&gt;Hell, depending on the tasks and use of skips you can do 9 tureal tasks during your 1 wildy task.
---
The streaks are separate, that wouldn't work. If it did, that'd be the most points/h by far.
---
So I bought this item a month ago to use for sara boss... havent read what the nerf is about but scared cuz I havent been on in a month
---
who says it's a rabbit hole?
---
Pvp gets a vast amount of devtime compared to the size of the community though.
---
Love the negative xp lamps, but it would be nice for it not be restricted by level 50, if you really want to change up your account why not allow it to be possible, but a bit of a grind? :D
---
Wow... braindead kid of the year. You think 6m is alot of gold? If the fucking shield is 600m then sure it deserves this kind of defense bonus. You clearly have never had one never been in the wildnerness and never even pked! Reddit fucking makes me nauseous
---
Nope. Reread my comment about being lvl 70-80
---
The main people complaining about Dihns aren't arsed people with 400k worth of dbones are getting away more that people getting caught with their pants down on 6 brews and a full tb face tanking specs aren't dying thanks to dihns + ktop.
---
I bet most the outraged people on reddit don't even own a Dihns nevermind use it in the wild.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs just a parody. I see images of cartoons and other games and if I see a way to make it relate to RuneScape I recreate it!
---
Ty. For a melee weapon, I was thinking of a new sword called ‚Äòblade of Avaros‚Äô. This would be a t70 weapon with stats equal to a whip. It‚Äôs special attack would be ‚Äòpower of Zaros‚Äô. When activated, costs 100% energy. For 8 seconds, you will absorb enemy damage, and when the 8 seconds are up, you will recoil 100% of the sum of the hits to all the opponent‚Äôs that hit you divided by the number of players that hit you. 
---
For example, 4 players attack you and you activate the special. One person hits you a 10, other guy hits you a 20 other guy hits you a 23, and other guy hits you 8. The next hit cycle they hit 0, 14,30,10. The third hit cycle they do 0,0,20,30. 
---
Summing all the hits up is 161. 
---
161 divided by 4 is 41.25 rounded down to 41. Every player or NPC that hit you would be dealt 41 damage. 
---
Thoughts? This could be cool tbh.

True, there's already the bug with autoretaliate skulling you rarely.
---
And that‚Äôs why they get killed more often? Now what‚Äôs your point?

No one brings dhide because they probably can‚Äôt brid fast enough to counterbait the pk‚Äôer, whereas Bulwark + dhide covers all angles with the player only having to focus on eating.

This is awesome. Well done.

Wait... You are telling me that the shield with a giant, living, blinking magical eye in the center of it has magical properties???? Noooooo /s
---
hisec - Area where unprovoked attackers will be destroyed within a matter of seconds
---
yellowbox - locked on target, but hasn't fired yet (locking onto someone isn't considered aggression cause locking can be used to provide repairs to friendlies)
---
Jita - Massive player trade hub, think of it like the GE
---
Banana flag - Low security status icon, basically warns players that you've previously been committing pirate activity, but still cannot be engaged in hisec without provocation 
---
Suspect timer - Looks similar to banana flag but inverted colors and flashing, this means you have recently committed "illegal" acts and anyone in hisec is clear to attack you without penalty.
---
 Concord - the invincible NPC "police force" that kills pirates in high sec. (Think guards from darkscape) Escape is inevitable, but if you wanna grief or gank your target, you can still blow them up before Concord gets you if you're smart/lucky

Can you show me some examples? Does the target have combo foods and brews? Are the magic levels the same? The defence levels?

Strength would only give a +2 compared to the firecape, but would have no other stats and would be locked behind getting a 99.
---
Yes.
---
If your phone is running at a 100% managing barely 40fps then limiting it to 15 or 20 (so running at maybe 60-70%) will give you drastically better battery life and thermals.
---
Combat capes are a bit OP. Hunter cape idea is great though.
---
This will help me a lot getting into pvp Pog
---
who knew attacking magic into anti magic gear would lead to poor results.
---
If you do it on stream be prepared to get stream sniped, but should be a fun goal
---
I don't question your motives, of course. :) I question the motives of people that bullied JMods for having the idea in the first place. I do however think that emotional reasoning doesn't make you see what you're fighting clearly. I will be on the frontlines when they actually introduce MTX~~, because there's no way I'll ever be able to quit the game~~.
---
Either side is just stupid tbh. Reddit seems mostly pvm'ers who won't be happy until the wildy is completely safe. Twitter seems mostly pk'ers who want pvm'ers to die instantly and drop their whole bank.
---
Vocal minorities are so stupid
---
The land of the old! Haha yeah I didn‚Äôt know anything in this area that played feel free to message me I‚Äôll give you my ign
---
*most toxic, fixed it for you buddy!
---
Wish you the best! I...I still don‚Äôt understand how your initial argument isn‚Äôt a non-sequitur. But life shall go on for us both.
---
This stupid predator/prey mindset is so toxic. If you didn't specifically build your account in the right way, you can't be a viable pker. Which means people don't do it. Which means going into the wildy just means standing sround waiting for someone to show up and kill you.
---
If the max cape gets all these overpowered perks then good night. +14 prayer? Unlimited spellbook swaps? 110 HP? Just why?
---

---
You aren't minding your own business if you're using the superior wilderness methods
---
Yeah, I did a ton of it on my main to unlock all slayer helms. Still really dislike it, but great points.
---
On my iron now I do every 10th task at Konar, but obviously playing iron is really different. I don't care about efficiency at all anymore, so I just afk the slow Konar tasks with ranged.
---
PKers can massively up their offensive KO potential by bringing an AGS as their +1 for no real extra risk. Dinh's is just the defensive counter to that to balance it out.
---
Ok I have it on the lowest FPS and my phone gets HOT when I play for more than 10 min.
---
ill be honest, i do pvp often with my clan but we don't really complain about the shield, if we manage to catch someone out in shield its all good but if they get away the most i'd hear from them is : " damn that shield tho" more often than not we'd praise the guy for getting away from us. 
---
but i do  have one gripe, and that is for its price, the shield tanks out pkers risking 10x more easily, anyways the shield was,by jagax, meant to tank in pve.
---
also when we gonna address black d'hide's defences for its price, its super cost efficient, like it makes other equipment around its level less effective as its usually more expensive. e.g. karil's set( like i understand that karil's is used to mage tank in pve but i was wondering for its price could we get maybe a +1-5 range bonus over the d hides?)
---
this might be to combat power creep but a set of black dhide costs roughly 12k? 
---
and a set of karils about 3m, idk man i just feel like karil's aint worth it sometimes
---
No anti dragon shield.
---
It's a joke.
---
Definitely agree. I think it's kind of silly that your lost items don't immediately become lootable by all players when you bite it.

Although Reddit only gets shitty ones and overused jokes.
---
I'm starting to realise that. I don't even know why there is a whole "us vs them" mentality. It isn't as if by PvMing your locking yourself out of the pking aspect and vice versa.
---
I guess it's true. Doesn't matter what game, doesn't matter how much the developers cater to whatever community. There will always be those who'll find something to bitch about.
---
Godwars is nowhere near endgame though. If you got 70 agility I guarantee you could solo Zilyana right now lol
---
damn this style looks great
---
Experience says they do
---
This is the smartest thing ive heard all day
---
you know 1def, 1 pray account pures with 99str exist right. giving them a better firecape for free is dumb. most of them just pay for someone capable of doing it for them, but some dont.
---
No I'm not, because 2 of those were people bitching they splashed on a bulwark when I can get budget gear that has more mage defense than a bulwark and dhide, 2 of them bitched about pvp in general and happened to have mentioned bulwarks are ***one*** of the things that should be balanced, and the others barely mentioned a bulwark at all.
---
I'd vote Yes to actually fixing mage in pvp but not to item nerfs to an already subpar item.
---
It's not about there being advantage one way or another, it's about balance. Welfare magic defence vs welfare magic offence is massively skewed toward defence; it's not balanced. 
---
Two players, equally skilled, should be a 50/50 as to who wins. Right now, the person tanking will win most of the time regardless of skill.
---
Pking in the agility course is fucking cancerous and indicative of psychopathy though. Zero people there will be carrying anything, so literally the only reason to kill someone  there is to make them suffer. It's the torturing small animals of Runescape.
---
Tyty
---
People need to quit saying this
---
What are you talking about gear that coste less than that fool? Every pker has at least a d claw or ags and this shit is fkn 5 mill broken asfuck while not being skulled

For some reason I need you to get 1 more abyssal demon kc. But yes that would be fun

---
This is the best argument pitched yet. The clanning scene really changes everything in the wildy. However it's hard to find that delicate balance where you can die to a single player and also survive being tagged by a clan. But even so my gripe remains that in a 1 v run scenario, the bulwark is just way more effective than the offensive gear in the same price range.
---
This is straight up not true.
---
Huh. I've never had that happen to me.

With a Dinhs, because Dinhs is OP. But there aren't a whole lot of tools otherwise

Except PKers don‚Äôt play this game more than any of the other extremists. There are players who aim for max that spend almost all their time playing, not to mention Ironmen. Your point is just irrelevant to PvPers.
---
Going from country jig to forlorn homestead during herb runs gives me whiplash.
---
thank god this game only cost me $60 a year.
---
It is hyperbolic, there are plenty of pures that are not toxic and are nice people. That being said, there is definitely more toxicity amongst the pure community - or more generally the pking community - than others. I think since you‚Äôre fighting other players, you‚Äôre more competitive and competitiveness can sometimes bring out the worst in people. Toxic pkers are just people who don‚Äôt have the emotional maturity to bite their tongue when things don‚Äôt go their way.
---
No matter what account build you are though, as long as you are a nice person then people will treat you with respect. It is a shame that the vocal minority give the rest of the community a bad name.
---
Oh and welcome back to RS :)
---
I remember this in classic. I have fond memories of being attacked by some guy in addy armor but managing to out DPS him with a rune 2h and bolt spells.
---
How about you make a reason comment as to why it shouldn't be a thing
---
You‚Äôre reaching.  The quest had, again, a single step requiring a fairy ring.  The devs realized it wasn‚Äôt that important and decided to remove the step.  
---
Imagine if the new quest had a step that required use of the Grand Exchange, or to trade another player.  The outrage from ironmen would be huge.  Oh, but ‚ÄúThEy ChOsE To LiMiT TheMseLvEs‚Äù right? No, they would‚Äôve had no idea at account creation that they would be locked out of a future quest, city, and the quest cape.
---
Typical response from someone who doesn't know anything about PvP.
---
They're constantly trying to give PvMers an incentive to enter the wilderness, then they're suprised as to why PvMers are upset they're getting killed all the time.
---
The reason they're PvMers are because they don't wanna PvP, but then they're making the Meta to be at the risk of being attacked by PvPers.
---
It's just fucking dumb.
---
PvP should be for PvPers. Not PvMers who are lured in to the slaughter.
---
Congratulations!

But fix black dhide, for real.  That‚Äôs the bigger imbalance imo.
---
No? Soul wars was there before summoning skill
---
It was either vetion or a deep wildy clue, can't remember which.
---
It‚Äôs a purely defensive item, and you say that it shouldn‚Äôt have def. ü§î
---
Because he couldn't afford it in game, so no one should of had such a good item.
---
So your wear full veracs and keep pray melee up at all time. You veng whenever you. He has an attack that you can't pray against - you can't see it coming. That will hit your veng. You do get hit hard - nothing you can really do against that - just need to be ready to combo eat
---
How long were you asleep for?
---
Agreed
---
Thanks for the memories,
---
It was hard to start again but once you grind your attack and defences up and get some gear questing and everything is much more fun. It's a great game to play while you have a beer and watch TV.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt even have been nerfed in the first place.
---
Have fun with Bubba and Tyrone, champ.
---
This is nothing. I got my first whip at like 2.5k kc
---
&gt;Find me any comparably priced item that offers offensive bonuses similar to the bulwarks defensive ones.
---
Can you stop trying to do your shitty brigade LOL.
---
I was waiting for him to say somthing abojt how this magical shield that seems to be a living being can't have mage defense because "iT's MeTaL".
---
What on earth did you purchase for $149.99??
---
Shhh!!
---
The bone burner isnt cursed though. Only the altar is cursed.
---
Again you're twisting what I said. I never categorically stated what you're trying to imply I did. I merely pointing out a fact that whether you kill a pvmer or someone who's set out to pk someone themselves. It is inherently still pvp/pking. 
---
Oh were arguing are we? I thought this was a discussion didn't realise the two were mutually exclusive.
---
Stop making/asking for content that's designed to lure PvMers into the wilderness then.
---
Fight PvPers instead.
---
Right on! So agreed
---
Better idea: Nerf both
---
LMFAO
---
Nor did I say it was but you've completely missed my point.
---
They could of at least made an actual change to how powerful the bulwark is in the wilderness. The -10 nerf will have a 5% effect on actual gameplay, so the pkers arnt getting what they want. All this "nerf" does is facilitate a clueless circle jerk from people who have never pked or want to be pked.
---
What did he say?
---
It's uhmm...  Invisible??
---
This reminds me, why is stack size a signed int?
---
I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but I would think that by agreeing to terms with Jagex that in-game items have no fiscal value you would not be able to argue in court in a case against Jagex that they do, in fact, have value. Especially with verbiage like this in the agreement:
---
‚ÄúFOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND MICRO-GAME CREDITS HAVE NO CASH VALUE, DO NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF MONEY OR MONETARY VALUE FROM JAGEX AT ANY TIME.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs not to say that perhaps you wouldn‚Äôt have a case against another party, say a gold seller, that didn‚Äôt adhere to the terms of a transaction between that seller and yourself. But I don‚Äôt think any argument about the value of in-game items or currency would hold against Jagex under the current user agreement.
---
They also specify that the purchase of ‚Äúmicro-game credits‚Äù (bonds) is a measure of the extent of your license to use the product. A license that is specified to be revocable at any time.
---
I think part of the reason people only use god spells in PVP was in part due to the best PVM spell only able to be autocasted by a mace with bad stats.  
---
Claws of Guthix has the most PVM applications, give it a good staff on par with sotd/sol and it should get more use.
---
Your videos weren't funny after the first 5 minutes. Imagine watching multiple video of the same insults repeated ad nauseum in Microsoft Sam voice. 
---
Inb4 you call me a goblin boy or some dumb shit
---
Agreed. Ice barrage existing kills any chance of pvmer vs pker fights. Throw in the risk of skull tricking and you are far better off as a pvmer just running away or just bringing 3 items and letting them kill you.
---
The fact is that they want the PvMers in there to risk being killed by PKers.
---

I'm not sure about a generalized conclusion from this but I do know that if you move 1 tile south and try to barrage those nibblers you get pulled out. So it is at least somehow related to the shallowness of the angle- I am not confident to say that the exact number of tiles available is the angle required in all cases though.
---
I'm also not seeing the issue. I'm only seeing people who say this getting downvoted, with no replies for why.
---
I think you should just be able to find a quiet world and play together there. The game is never going to be busy enough that there aren't plenty of empty worlds.
---
Worst of all, is always these sorts of things are coming from grown, college educated adults (some of them I suppose).

And we are back to what I said at the end of my comment. I don‚Äôt comprehend how it‚Äôs fun to hit something that doesn‚Äôt fight back. It‚Äôs not for profit as you said, it‚Äôs for fun. But imagine the hypothetical given earlier. Some pvm boss that gives 500k an hour and all it does is attempt to run away but can‚Äôt run away. No one would do it. It‚Äôs not entertaining enough to justify doing it for the 500k an hour over something else (could find more entertaining activities that make more). It‚Äôs not profitably competitive obviously. And it‚Äôs not even ideal in terms of being afk. If you just wanted to free cast on something for profit you could just go do barrows.

You people are clownshows. Why should a giant fucking shield covering your entire character have any magic def at all?

None of you would get it cause your afking your slayer task while posting on this. Tools

Hey

How is this related? so I vote no on some PvP feature, and somehow that means that the PKers are obliged to exclusively kill people who are not interesting in fighting.  
---
This must be some big brain stuff because I do not get it.  
---
Good meme though, made me chuckle.

Wish they would put the real Blood Altar back in there...  for integrity reasons...  Keep the Zeah Blood altar but add the real blood altar in as well... so you get crazy agility xp while RCing.

---
I agree with most but the crafting. No chisel? Are you supposed to magically break the gem with your hands or what? Maybe wrap the cape around it and hit it against the ground? While we want benefits they also need to make some sort of sense
---
Thanks buddy. Don‚Äôt suppose you have a pestle and mortar do you? Ive got papers.
---
Have you ever played before? That‚Äôs the question. You can use bonds to get you from early ‚Äî&gt; mid game ASAP, and cut out a lot of tiring levels. I did the same when I started playing again, mainly because when I was a kid I never had that option, and so I spent hours and hours of my life grinding gold and I never wanted to do that again,
---
To put it unto perspective, when I started out 6 months ago I probably spent about ¬£20 on bonds. Because I had all this cash, I was able to progress so much faster, to the point where I now can earn a few mill gp per hour. This means I no longer have to pay for membership as can self sustain, so the initial outlay ended up creating cost savings eventually.
---
It‚Äôs up to you, but if you value your time as worth more than ¬£1 an hour, then buy a few bonds when you get started and then use that cash to play straight from then on,
---
being locked behind an easy 99 is free l0l
---
You implied it in the first thing you said with the cost of it. Go afk your slayer task you muppet
---
Found the guy who wears salad robes and a water staff. 
---
Stop bitching about the shield being op when you yourself use level 20 armor. It doesn‚Äôt compete with endgame gear. That‚Äôs just not how this game works. You gotta have good gear to compete with good gear.
---
I don‚Äôt have a credit card
---
Dude lmao you're mentally ill and dont even play Runescape. Holy fucking shit.
---
There are plenty of ways to contact Jagex about an issue. You‚Äôve utilized just one of the official means and one of the unofficial ones.
---
I somehow think, that -10 in mage is a lot. I already get 95% tbed vs 126 decent geared pkers.
---
Revs is shiite loot unless you rent a world out. Having to tp every other kill wastes a lot of time. Though if you are looking for best gp you should do zulrah. Demonic gorillas are good as well.
---
500xp max, not 500xp per lamp. Poorly worded by Jagex; hopefully they clarify soon
---
retard. you try to ruin the game
---
I had 64 ranged 2 weeks ago.  You know what chinchompas are son?  I know you've never succeeded in killing a farmer since you're here whining bout a shield, but cmon, basic game knowledge
---
What do you mean offset its ability? It just has massive defensive stats, it doesnt have 20% damage reduction in PvP.
---
The problem is its strength is necessary and isnt quite as OP in multi, but its INCREDIBLY strong in singles to an absurd extent. It quite literally turns people who dont know how to tank and cant switch prays correctly into great tanks by default, its a huge crutch for most people. And you can use it with a really strong setup and risk virtually nothing like Serp+Dinhs+Arma chest+Suffering. The amount of effort it takes for someone to kill someone in a good Dinhs setup in singles is ridiculous most of the time unless they get godly RNG or the guy is just genuinely that awful at tanking. You need at least one other person to TB them (probably half) and preferably a focuser in a max DPS setup like DCB+TSOTD+Claws and then 2 or 3 more guys to spec dump as well. Other wise, chances are good theyll tank a half TB with no problem and KOing them is pretty difficult. 
---
And the sad part is, the nerf isnt going to change virtually nothing for singles, its still REALLY good.
---

I saw some youtube videos about this mmo called Tibia, where they mentioned that houses in cities would be expensive as fuck (So I assume they werent instanced). Would be cool to have noninstanced houses, but every week or month they go to auction or whatever, and you can bid on the house, as the owner you would have to outbid other people to keep the house, and the player who won the bid would pay, and those money would be removed from game. Money sink and noninstanced houses

I recently got back into LoL. Arams are fun and laid back. The game itself (in my opinion) is shit, but anyone can get lucky and have fun on aram.

With that alone, it's hard to play osrs. Its hard to juggle 3 very time consuming games along with my job and other activities I'm interested in.
---
The PvM (bossing) meta is tabbing to get refill inven + get spec back because the distances from banks to bosses are so short now (also shit game design. If this wasn't the case, I would be more willing to accept that the nest box was a more impactful change.). They didn't nerf it because they thought it would mess up PvM balance (if they did, well they're even more misinformed) they nerf it as a knee-jerk reaction to seeing that one guy bringing extra brews to Infernal. However, the limiting factor in what makes Infernal difficult was never really about running out of supplies but was not making a mistake in 6 jads + zuk wave. You can literally just wait out SGS spec if running out of brews. But we can disagreed to agree on this point.
---
&gt; "I'm not sure what else they're supposed to do." That's fine because you're not a game designer and I'm not one either but making it so you can't get splashing XP in Lumbridge with arbitrary boundaries  as a way to  stop splashers in Lumbridge is a solution one can literally think up in a minute. It makes zero sense lore wise, game design wise, and technically as well.

&gt; I do have problem if you think that salad robes or mystics should be hitting every (other) barrage on Raids1 item, which is made to tank.

Nobody thinks this you mongoloid. If you pked once if your life you'd black d'hides is enough to easily escape from salad robes. 
---
&gt;You go after nonPVP crowd and you are pissed that you are unable to kill someone who won't fight back (RCers, Wildy altar, chins, etc).
---
Again with your delusions. The new players that mainly are attacking people here are easy pickings and get killed by decent pkers. It's called the circle of life.
---
&gt;I won't ever kill you, so the only thing you are losing is the runes/supplies. So against me you risk nothing. What you risk against other is not my fucking problem.
---
Your problem seems to be your delusional mindset. Whatever they are attacking you with they are risking it. When a team or another pker logs in guess who their target is? It's the guy attacking you who actually risks something.
---
&gt;A) You leave me be, becouse you understand I risk nothing and you'd be wasting your supplies
---
or
---
B) You attack me.
---
Then B1) You kill me, you get sub 50k loot (bones, d'hides) or B2) you don't kill me.
---
This just shows how out of touch you are. Can't understand why people attack you in a PvP zone. 
---
&gt;You don't respect my tanking. You think that for the simple fact that you are a PKer and I am not I should just die and hand you all the gear and loot I carry.
---
Respect your tanking? Buddy I've been on both ends, attacking someone with a bulwark and tanking with one. It's the most brain dead tank ever. You could walk away from your pc get water come back and still be alive because the shield is that overpowered. You don't need to switch protection prayers or even think about what the opponent is doing. How is that respectable?
---
Why would you bot splashing üòÇ
---
The problem is that almost none of that content or new content is *so* worth it that the risk of going there is like this fun thrill
---
Intellectual
---
&gt;takes picture of screen
---
Almost as if there's more than one person and multiple opinions..
---
Nah those combat brackets and ranges are imposed by the game. You can't attack anyone in the wilderness, they have to be within a certain range that scaled with wilderness level. It's like having weight classes in boxing.
---
I feel you Men I got a full time Job, gym and social life it only lea es time for like 1 time consuming game and casually others. And with the state of osrs it doesnt feel like osrs is the time consuming game to go
---
Oh cool! thanks for letting me know
---
Can confirm, paramedic who plays at work for 85% of my gameplay
---
Just be less of a big cunt lol
---
Oh that sounds great, thanks!
---
You imply salt when you start bringing in their iqs just because they are attacking you, moron.
---
Start making firecape a requirement to vote.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Theres a fraction of them compared to normal worlds. It's the best you're going to get. Expect to get pk'd anyway it's free loot for them. It's just not as often there. Not sure why I got downvoted for simply trying to help some dude saying he can't even use 5 bones before getting attacked lmao.
---
if dhin's didn't exist would the defender still always be advantaged? thanks for humoring me
---
Have you checked your own settings first?
---
Would still be good if they implemented a clan wars style system to it though :) but I also don't know if its worth the dev time because you're right
---
Reworked the requirements of SoTE. Mate, it was literally one fairy ring that was going to be part of that quest lmao.
---
So why does endgame gear for ranged cost 20k while endgame gear for mage costs 6m? And if you're using a t75 shield shouldn't a t75 weapon be good enough to combat it effectively?
---
What about them?
---
Because that‚Äôs how online video games work. That‚Äôs how MMORPGs work in general. That‚Äôs how Runescape has been since it was released and everyone except for a small, extremely small minority of players prefer it that way. It doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs gonna poll, it‚Äôs not gonna pass, and then we won‚Äôt have the discussion for a couple years and someone will be so passionate about how they fucked up and should be accommodated immediately that‚Äôs we will repeat this process.
---
Making revs instanced based off different combat brackets would be an interesting idea
---
Not arguing any point?? Just trying to help a guy get better xp and avoid pkers? Where did I try and argue against anything
---
Thanks
---
Got to talk to Oziach first
---
looks like you are indeed the goblin boi, watch your back little timmy before we laugh at your negative -30 score
---
Make sure you say NoseDab sent you, I‚Äôll be asking when I log in lol
---
no, other than normal fullscreen mode
---
Is that true? Are there NPCs with ranged/mage attacks that can be 1 way safespotted? I didn't think that was possible for NPCs
---
And what‚Äôs wrong that? There‚Äôs a reason that the skull and +1 system is in place.
---
You want to attack someone that‚Äôs 3 turning with high tier items? Good luck, there‚Äôs a chance that you won‚Äôt kill them.
---
Yeah but like... That's several hundred, even thousands of lamps (if QC). I think it would be cool to let the people who are willing to put in the time do that. (Also imagine when the new quests come out and they have to get their stats back up, and then down)
---
There already is some engine work to be done to make these lamps a reality.
---
Depends on if you are trioing or duoing. 
---
Trio 80 defence should suffice. 
---
Duo I would suggest 90+
---
Damn. Well do you suggest regular fullscreen or fixed fullscreen?
---
Sold mine as soon as they started talking about the nerf
---
I said that because in your comment you said "you have a chance at pking an end game item" it's not true
---
Ok, but don't pretend they don't exist.
---
s
---
If pkers spam their team name hashtag on you pvming that's actually really pathetic lmao. the hashtag thing (which actually comes from TS) is used if they take out another pker from another team to kinda say "hey we just killed your boy and this is who did it." still not a big fan of it, would rather see things like what Fools say "Cheers/gf from Finland"
---
I like regular but its all personal preference
---
Maybe you‚Äôre too dense to understand the nuance of language and that my response was my retort. Get a brain isn‚Äôt an argument.
---
Why don't those players just bring better gear?
---
This isn‚Äôt true at all. Check edgeville in BH worlds, pvp worlds, the black chin spot, clans meet at revs all the time. Just because you‚Äôre not pking in the wilderness against other pkers doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening
---
they were set to hidden. I had to right click to attack him. And it was definetely the same guy. I brought the whip in case i had to fight when i tried to dig for the clue.
---
New pet!
---
I will agree, a lot of RS3 content is locked behind either maxed or near maxed skills, which isn't the best way to run a game, even if it's not as tedious or slow as it used to be to level up skills. Combat can be odd to get into, but unless you're bossing or obsessed with max possible damage, revolution bars for abilities fit pretty much every combat purpose. Jagex made a lot mistakes with the game, but at the very least they launch updates later the address the glaring issues
---
Shit like this is why Guthix had to banish all the gods.
---
It wasn‚Äôt deleted. It‚Äôs still down at the bottom.
---
Even with this buff people wouldn't use the attack cape over the fire cape. You ever put in warrior ring vs berserker ring into a dps calc? Accuracy means almost nothing against anything that isn't corp. The defense cape is in a similar situation where it isn't better than firecape enough to be worth using except for certain niche situations. It certainly shouldn't give more magic defense than the mage cape though.
---
Have had internet issues the past 2 weeks. thanks comcast :)
---
I'm really failing to understand your point here, not going to lie. You're saying a shield that's worth 6 million GP deserves to make you basically invincible in the wilderness? Isn't the point of the wilderness to add a sort of risk and danger to the players?
---
If you are using an Elysian shield, and suddenly they nerfed Elysian shield, then yeah I would  understand cuz Elysian shield is rarer than Bulwark, and over 100 times more expensive. I really don't understand why people are defending Dinh's Bulwark.

---
that's what I miss.
---
&gt;It was actually quite difficult to die. Im not joking. I would escape in 90% of encounters.
---
....and this is what every PKer tries to explain to people who literally do not have any experience actually trying to kill people in the wilderness and were told "no, PKers have huge advantages and its so easy for them to kill PvMers...why is Jagex conspiring against us to make it even easier!!". Yes, imagine being told by someone who has no experience doing something that they actually know better than you do.
---
Another common shit post meme that people will respond with: "Dont complain about not being able to kill PVMers when youre wearing salad robes and a water stick"
---
Despite the fact ive never seen a singles pker complaining about struggling to DPS/kill PvMers at Chins or somewhere, and despite the fact that the vast majority of singles PKers at 44s and Chins do not even wear salad robes, let alone a freakin water stick. Most everyone is in at minimum 500-600k risk basic mystic sets and people fairly commonly also run the Dboots+Blessed SS (And some go seers ring as well) in addition to that which is like 2.3m+ risk for an upgraded "basic" mystic set. People dont wear such garbage, rag setups like salad robes at Chins/singles strip or 44s because youll literally just get bullied by everyone else or not even come close to killing any PvMers...so its a ridiculous claim to begin with. The only place people use salad robes mostly, is Revs.
---
People legitimately have no clue how EASY it is to tank at chins, especially with a basic Dinhs setup. Get TB'd? Just run to Hobbs to box or you could pretty easily tank most half TBs. I truly wish these types of people would actually go out and TRY to PK in singles and attack these people and see what happens instead of sitting there and acting like they know everything, and in fact know BETTER than the people who actually PK. 
---
&gt; The pkers are a *fundamental part of this equation*. 
---
This is something Im genuinely confused that SO MANY PvMers dont comprehend this and act like entitled cry babies over the fact PKers DARE attack and/or kill them in the wilderness.
---
Like do people not realize it is **quite literally** a PKers job to attack people doing content in the wilderness. The Wilderness is a classic Risk vs Reward area (And something that the entire game is based around basically) and if you took PKers and gave PVMers what they think theyre entitled to, there would be no wilderness. Without any PKers attacking you, there is ZERO risk, its just another area. I think its because Jagex has essentially COMPLETELY removed Risk from PvM outside the wilderness now because they removed death mechanics and everything is instanced. The worst people "risk" is 100k per death at Vorkath and ToB which is laughable. So people have become spoiled and come to expect things that are MAX REWARD MINIMUM RISK. 
---
If all these people crying about a completely negligible nerf to the Bulwark, or everything else they cry about with the Wilderness actually went into the Wilderness to singles PK instead crying then things would be COMPLETELY different. Theyd realize...oh wow maybe these people who PvP every day actually do know what theyre talking about and theres a lot of broken, unbalanced shit in PvP.
---
I loved it too.
---
Also- correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the area used to look different? I recall watching a friend doing the questline and instead of a run down dark wooden ghetto it looked a lot more stoney with tons more ruins... (This was on RS2, not OSRS)
---
it isnt pures in full ghostly who complain about splashing on dinhs, literally maxed mains in extremely expensive gear splash an inordinate amout of time on it
---
again, the shield is just too strong against similar gear match up.
---
I used to splash on the cow at nmz. It's a power move that not all are ready for though.
---
You're not wrong. Mod ash is bae though.
---
Fix how though? Just a flat nerf to magic defense, or something else?  I can understand it needs looking at, but we gotta know how to tackle it correctly.
---
Open to level 1s, you traverse every rooftop, if you make it, it's lvl 99 xp at the end. Abnormally high failure rate.
---
I absolutely would bet money on that.  I'm sure there would be a crowd shouting lock her up, but I doubt there would be ISIS cosplayers with noose wands spewing hate.
---
yep. I'll bring along a maul and a nitzy helm and turn around on a single pker trying to steal my spade, IF i know it's just a single player and all I risk is my 50-100k above my 3-4 keepers.
---
Nobody is forcing PKers to waste their time attempting to kill players wielding the best tank shield in the game either. Sorry that I can get away every time, why does it need to be nerfed? To make you feel better?
---
I seriously doubt it.
---
Has to be symmetrical unfortunately:/
---
Attack cape &gt; inferno
---
if you unironically think that jagex caters to pures then you are actually clueless

pure doesnt affect main accs

I remember making runs to get a cosmic rune spawn and all the phat stacks I was going to make.

Indubitably
---
100 dragon bones is pretty damn trivial man.
---
You lose nothing if you don't attack others and only have 3 items, so it could only save some time killing him. And for if you need to fight: on the wiki it tells you if you need to fight and a dds is already enough to kill a Zammy wizard.
---
Hook me up with some God imbued capes outside wilderness, brainlet OP
---
but what skill in this alternate reality would give u a player pet?
---
you cannot edit ur comment, this is your final warning next on will get u banned.
---
replace "y'all" with "bish" and crosspost to /r/KendrickLamar
---
It seems so yes, they've taken away the cost of competitive
---
Do what you want, just quit crying when I get away due to your incompetence, your poor gear, or your poor stats.
---
I wouldn't go that far... 
---
And last I heard, a growing number of players are freely trading their $11 every month to get/keep membership, so it seems like the "fair" price isn't even as high as it could be. 
---
Personally, I'm canceling mine for at least a while, and just going to try to live off trading for bonds
---
Okay so pandos, trogdor, one of the skulls is fucking sans, and a dick godsword. Oh and gamer girl bath water. Jesus this is a mess and I adore it
---
I am pro-PvM, and yet I agreed with you until your last phrase, when you say why should you risk, when the enemy is only risking 100K.
---
Perhaps, only perhaps, he isn't risking much because he isn't in the wildy to pk, and if you want good loot, you should search for another PK who WANT to fight, and NEED to risk good gear to be able to defeat you.
---
That is some nice 2h penis right there
---
Memes aside I believe they said it would require engine work as something is changed with the mobile client that isn't included in the desktop version. So yes, it can be added.
---
Can I ask if you use LMS worlds? Or the new beta ones? Never done LMS
---
Actually just construction.. all of these skills are expensive, but only construction removes gold from the game. You give that gold to another player for herblore, prayer, crafting, smithing, and farming, thus they are not gold sinks.
---
I want fuck the shit out of here
---
8k kc btw
---
Happened to me also in RL, did yours reappear?
---
Yes it's very helpful, I would recommend the Logitech g502 (the non wireless one is within your budget) if you are right handed.
---
Why should a T75 shield protect you against all types of attacks with the only downside of it is having poor offensive stats. Which ultimately don‚Äôt matter because nobody uses the shield offensively anyway. So for its purpose, it essentially has no downsides in how it is mostly used.
---
Almost positive this is the case lol.
---
In a free society, workers have the right to not work for a company that won't pay/treat them fairly. Freedom goes both ways
---
it wasnt a level requirement, it was an arbitrary requirement to use fairy rings and did not make sense. 
---
Negative xp lamps are a terrible idea imo. And i have 2 failed pures lmao. theyre not bad because they help pures who made a mistake though, theyre bad because people have spent insane hours on doing things suck as 99 def 1 atk, or 10 hp builds, or lowest level firecape, and to be able to beat all that work by just using a negative xp lamp seems pretty lame
---
none, rip rune pouch 2019-2019
---
Kkkkkkkk*
---
The argument is that the shield is intended to be tanky considering the fact it is a rare drop from CoX (end game content) and is being nerfed to make it less effective against clans of salad robes, books of darkness, and a mystic water staff risking 50k. Tbh I don‚Äôt think the nerf is that extreme but I do think it should have been polled and won‚Äôt bolster any pvp content.
---
You make a valid point, I like it
---
That‚Äôs an interesting way of saying you want to leave
---
Pretty sure it's worth 100K
---
Meh, pking was more fun before people safed to 100+.  With the maul nerf, it will be impossible to stack above 110 and unlikely to stack above 80.  Hopefully, people will stop safing and if they do, you can just safe up and walk away.
---
Or maybe... he was just a dragon
---
Firemaking cape is op
---
They're catering to Pkers because they bitch about there not being enough pk updates, the funny thing is this update just widens the divide between pvm and pkers
---
Yea my pixel 1 would die in 30-45 mins, but my note 9 goes for hours.
---
The altar is weird because it is one of the things that has a reward worthy of PKing risk but you don't actually have to risk anything
---
Which all belong in the wilderness, as its Risk vs Reward. Red Chins and Herbi exist. CoX, ToB, Zulrah, Vorkath all exist. Gilded Altars and Ectofuncus exists.
---
Would you rather all these things be easily accessible with 0 risk? Let's just show up in max gear to revs without worrying about anything, or even get 99 prayer for dirt cheap by using the chaos altar right next to a convient bank!
---
What? You think people don‚Äôt get PTSD from killing someone?
---
I work on my collection log
---
Eve is pretty fun! It can be really demanding on your time, even more than osrs depending on how you play it. 
---
What I described was something that can happen in the game if you get caught exploring in a wormhole. I've been on both ends of that. Eve players will have fun completely obliterating your first ever shiny explorer ship and fighting over your mutilated corpse then afterward will notice you are new at the game will send you a bunch of money and then invite you their corp if you aren't already in one. While eve gameplay is pretty brutal the great community more than makes up for it.
---
Damn she thicc
---
Just did....
---
Wait you can buy the bucket? I just assumed it was untradeable when reading the hespori drop table. Wtf?
---
Because this is an easy quick fix and the issue you had is way more complex than changing some numbers
---
I feel like this sub is real dramatic when it gets pked.
---
I hunted for imp boxes for about 3 hours and it basically set me up to bank every 100 chins for 99 hunter. Thats all it took.
---
I think my most expensive death ever was about 150 chins. Add in gear lost and thats about 500k. Like I said, i probably lost about 3m total. Maybe 3.5m when you factor in gear/food losses.
---
In return, i got a 6th trap, significantly higher xp rates, and almost 1.5m gp per hr at level 99.
---
I also learned to switch prayers, manage food, and react quicker when in a pvp scenario. It made me objectively better at the game.
---
I wonder how many of the people on this sub have actually done wildy skilling...
---
This reminds me of the great ninja war arc, when Madara rains asteroids and the shinobi are speechless
---
LMS is great fun for me, even as a non-PvPer. I find some of the mechanics really frustrating but I really enjoy the game mode.
---
I hope the rewards are more similar to Castle Wars rewards in that they're mostly cosmetic with minor stats (Even the halos are cool). I don't really want arbitrary items that are actually useful to people to be a reward because then you'd kind of 'force' people into it.
---
had a very similar experience pking at revs some time ago. neither I nor my mate are pker material but we had an absolute blast trying something new with actual player interaction
---
There are many, many pkers active right now that when making contact with other pkers will run away or log out, they're simply out in the wild trying to sneak up on an unsuspecting pvmer to try to make a quick buck from us losing our leet pvm gear. They have no intention of fighting someone who will actually fight back.
---
That‚Äôs because Reddit isn‚Äôt jagex customer support and 99% of the time they are guilty.
---
Twinking lol
---
I play at work all the time too.. but definitely not max still.. not that efficient.
---
Changes like these has ZERO influence to YOUR game, well, only thing what I can think of is that pures can use some features which they otherwise couldn't, like upcoming Blade of saeldor. So, you might get killed by a pure with a new sword, which is a slash version of Ghrazi rapier what pures CAN use. But even with such changes, they STILL has 1 Defense or other limited stats so they cannot do various current quests nor use equipment which would make them perform better in combat.
---
So, please, explain me why making changes like is a bad thing? Why aren't you saying anything about catering mains when they are getting new crystal armour which pures CANNOT use? Why pures are forced to live with outdated gear while mains are getting more and more new equipment?
---
Ps; I am a main &amp; HCIM and I don't own any sort of pure account.

I definitely think pvp in RPGs attracts a certain type of person who is often toxic.  There is a reason in WoW if there is a toxic player in your group you can probably fairly accurately guess what class they play Typically rogues, and warlocks - in the past at least.
---
You had a solid argument until you went all "wahhh no one is gonna like this cos theyre bitches" at the end. Downvoted JUST for that.

Alts can interact with each other. You just can't rig mini games such as castle wars.

don't give it any signs, randomize the course for every single player, make it so that you can't tele out once you start and give each obstacle a 45% fail chance. When you make it to the end you're 99 agility.
---
Why does it matter what the context of him going into the Wild is for. No matter what the content he is doing in the Wild it‚Äôs a fact that ‚Äúin the Wild expect to be killed. If you don‚Äôt like being killed‚Äù. So he avoids the Wild because surprise surprise be doesn‚Äôt like getting killed. But then he gets made of for being shook. So which is it. Does he not go to the Wild since he doesn‚Äôt want to die, or should he go to the Wild so he isn‚Äôt being ‚Äúshook‚Äù by pkers

you will wish for death before the end opening those.

Nope I used there official customer support multiple times including getting an account unbanned. Worked great and they are fast with responding.
---
So how this works is one guy attacks you convincing you that it is safe to attack back. They will make it seem like you can kill them easily. Then the guy will freeze you, step under you, and swap to a different acct (most of the time with a very similar name/lvl/gear). Now because you already were in combat and most likely believe you will win this fight you‚Äôre gonna fight back. The difference is you‚Äôre fighting someone WHO HAS NOT ATTACKED YOU FIRST this is why you became skulled. One of the most common tricks out there. Sorry you had to learn it the hard way
---
so if the client does it for you is it easy, or is the client playing the game for you?
---
Haha same happened to me a couple months ago I decided to try Wiley slayer for the first time and got attacked he went under me after freezing and switched accounts I got skulled and lost afew mil and my imbued slayer helm has to go back and grind out nmz I was quite annoyed to say the least.
---
I'm not a pker and I am totally lost on what you're trying to say
---
Just started playing osrs. Wanted to try my luck at pking. Currently have 85 mage 72 range. What should I do to practice pking?
---

---
Do you have to have your heel off the ground? Looks very uncomfortable.
---
Finally learning farming runs (tree, fruit tree, and a little herb). Hit 41 farming. I never used to do farming when I used to play and it‚Äôs good fun.
---
&gt;If you have food and are prepared to survive in the wilderness it's extremely likely you wont die.
---
Just a (maybe unpopular) opinion here. But if you are a PvMer headed into the wilderness, you bring some defensive gear, some brews, some high level food, and you are decent at the game you should be able to survive. Escaping should be easy if you know what you are doing and are prepared for a fight. I don't get the logic in pkers being upset at how often people escape. If someone runs away the second they get attacked I am 100% okay with them living.

A fine choice for first 99. That cape surely will make rest of your game way easier with an unlimited teleports to the best bank on the game. \^\^
---
Congratulations for your achievement! Wear that cape with proud while thinking what work you did in order to achieve it! :)
---
Dont go to wilderness if you dont want to get attacked. Problem solved no problem.

Are you an iron? Keep at it. I got mine at just under 1.1k kills.

Hey thanks! I've been looking for info about this, I'll read up

Yup.

How can you stand training combat stats?
---
I can do agi or rc but somehow doing crabs for combat training just makes me want to pull my hair out.
---
People who tell me to quit taking the game so seriously think the Inferno is some godlike feat. They usually struggle with fire capes and are just bad at the game. I didn't say you said that, but was rather stereotyping you. L2read scrub.
---
Yeah and I mentioned the Elder Maul which is a Raids I item as well. I don't see y'all crying about that. That's the point I made. You and the 200k other crybabies on here are obviously just terrified of PKers and wanna spite them. It provides for a good comedy scene.
---
Why would I? My parents got me an internship, a car, my apartment, and foot my tuition bill while all I do is maintain a 3.5 GPA knowing that my computer science major will land me jobs. Life's good having money.
---
number 3 is the most lazy, hamfisted solution to a symptom of a problem I've ever seen in OSRS. How about allow the locking of attack styles so they can't be selected by mistake, or actually supporting pures as a legitimate gamemode and allow them to set their level restrictions? Instead we have to do all this engine work that might also fuck up the highscores and any stat tracking sites and feels private servery as fuck to boot.
---
The funny thing is in OSRS the Blood Altar that was created by the Dark Altar on Zeah, actually gets its power from the real Blood Altar, which is suppose to be in the middle of Meiyerditch somewhere.

Did someone make a typo from ‚ÄúWe pay we say‚Äù?
---
It‚Äôs not as uncomfortable as it seems. You can either do the heel to press or other way. I usually just tap occasionally while I‚Äôm watching a show or on phone. Gotten 6 mage levels without looking at screen
---
100% worth it and getting the stats for the diaries makes your account better and is enjoyable so I would highly recommend getting it done!
---
I am not. I just wanted the ‚Äúironman experience‚Äù. Well, it sucks üòÄ
---
Thank you for explaining. That's probably what happened. I know he was wearing the same gear, but I was in a bit of a panic because I didnt know teleblock also blocked the levers from working.
---
Damn f2p was lit back then
---
Well I looked dps Calc and I think that I'm better of with range even though I don't have rigour. I don't have money to buy bis melees and my range is few levels higher
---
What a fearful world you must live in if you think someone geared up for callisto is going to turn around and smite a Pker for their +1 lol.
---
Oh no. What ever will they pkers do?
---
Oh no 100 dragon bones what are players gonna do! Sorry maybe if it was 1000 we would have some issues but 100 isn‚Äôt a big deal
---
Even with just dhcb with low stats, normal void and no rigour I'm getting like 2.5m per hour
---
So same logic would mean 1iteming an expensive endgame weapon like a rapier should just tear through someone in endgame armor? If people were tanking in legit endgame gear like dinhs with armadyl/barrows then sure they should be effective tanking vs endgame gear but someone 1iteming a dinhs with some cheap hides shouldnt be able to tank vs a max mage
---
Haha yes most of the playerbase opinions don't matter, only me and my 3 sweaty friends deserve to have opinions.
---
I was a 2k total on osrs before EoC. Ain't nothing righteous, I've earned my spot
---
HAHAHHA i bet ur just shaking right now not being able 2 log into your account hhahaahah
---
I don't see a problem here. Not sure does Iban's blast hide one's shield, so we cannot be certain does he have an anti-dragon shield or not. 
---
As for being in melee distance with melee protection, that's very effective early-game Ironman tactic since they don't have an access to antifire potions. My brothers did the same tactic on their Ironman careers when they started playing.
---
i'm a btw and i interact with other a
---
players all the time lmao. just cause you can't really boss together outside of raids doesn't instantly make it a single player game.
---
Fuck bolas, otherwise looks good.
---
&gt; it technically may be fully innocent if we're filled in with the context.
---
/r/selfawarewolves lol. best assume the worst instead of understanding theres context missing
---
its only 2.8m for some tedious work, nobody is going to do that.
---
In Dinhs + black d'hide you only risk whatever else is in your inventory- you barely even risk the shield due to how invulnerable you are and due to the fact you keep it.
---
You have to be risking way- WAY more- and ACTUALLY risking- as a skulled player- to beat through the shield.
---
So it's just a buzzword/catchphrase and has no origin or meaning?
---
I‚Äôd give you a set of prims for a puppy
---
Took me til 98 on my ironman :^] :^] :^]

---
everything bought
---
If you get skulltricked or lured, you deserve it and will learn.  What happened to any ounce of risk or self accountability in this game?  Players want Jagex to hold their hand and protect them from everything now.  Back in the day it was never like this.
---
Ah kk ty
---
Then pvpers will whine about how no one goes to the wils
---
What is it from? Sounds familiar but I can't remember.
---
Shoulda had a 15+
---
Maybe the exp scales with the level of who you‚Äôre attacking. High level bots would be risking the account too much?
---
Aren't they nerfing the Gmaul....?
---
Hit the nail on the head.
---
Everyone wants to play osrs for a living but no one realizes that to succeed they need to be an *entertainer* for a living who happens to play osrs.
---
pkers are brainlets they get salty we use dinhs but they will have 4 accounts taking turns hitting you while tbd??????????? makes sense
---
hey, that‚Äôs me! :)
---
Armour stand in the workshop is useful too
---
The entire game is RNG, what are you talking about?
---
Praise /u/tridomking , the voice of the people!!!
---
True, its like farming was made for mobile
---
You're genuinely retarded
---
Black D'hide isn't endgame gear
---
If a skulled player is one item'ing a bulwark, just the bulwark, they are still risking far far less than the gear it takes to penetrate it with the d'hide.
---
By your logic, sub 50k risk one "endgame itemer" should be able to beat out a bulwark 50% of the time.
---
Except it's not even close- you have to be ACTUALLY risking way way way way more on a maxed account even.
---
so if its all rng why do some skilled pkers have over 75% winrate?
---
Lol I'm glad I auto clicked i reap the benefits  of a 99 and didnt have to become suicidal
---
Oh man I see... You must have a learning disability. I'm very sorry for trying to talk to you. You and your "chip" have a nice day! Godbless! ^.^
---
It makes absolutely no sense to put combat restrictions on quests as it only devalues the challenge. You can attack any NPC at lvl 3 but you will probably die, why should quests be any different? If some wants to attept to "Woox" a new boss what's the point ruining the fun by taking that opportunity away?
---
Doesnt matter I ain't talking about that .
---
You can have my primms and pegs for smouldering.
---
the defense stats, again, arent the problem. its that its USELESS to dedicate yourself to doing no DPS no matter what content you are doing except fleeing pkers
---
Same. Was at Castle Wars and DClaw specced with defensive :/ it doesn‚Äôt even affect my combat level but it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same
---
you'll feel like a failure after maxing, trust me.

Let that sink in!
---
maxing isn't skill, but endurance. Horrible tedious endurance. Also, you can do it slow (no skill req) or fast (endurance+skill required). Like, getting like 7m slayer xp in 1 week for example, not anyone can do that. It takes effort and endurance and smart play.
---
Yeah but in relay races, the teams are all running at the same time. With a team verson one person and theyre tagging agro, its like one team gets to sprint for 10 secs, passes it to the next guy, and so forth while the other team has to keep starting from the beginning
---
except for the part where you gotta flick a prayer every 30 seconds or chomp down on a stone
---
This take is about 20 degrees celsius

jagex should design content around people who choose to limit themself

It's not the only way it's just the most efficient completely afk method

It would seem projection is strong with this one...

If you can point to where I said black d hide, I‚Äôll concede the retardation. Otherwise you might want to take a good long look in the mirror.... if your attention span allows for it üòâ
---
I think you've nailed it bro. I haven't played my 1def in ears, and I'm scared to learn again incase I mess the account up while PKing. A negative xp lamp would give me more confidence that I wouldn't waste a lot of time and effort, but at the same time, I just know it'll be a lengthy job and I could have better stuff for my main/iron from the dev time.
---
Yeah and one's a real game mode that they're saying "fuck you too", and one is a player constructed restriction around content that pures don't even use
---
Petition to re-open rsc*
---
Some did, but not all of the people who voted no. It would only take 14% of those who voted no to change their mind to make up the 4% difference. Do you honestly think over 86% of those who voted no were opposed to the entire concept rather than the implementation?
---
The better question is why you would, in absent of context, get the feeling you would get if it wasn't innocent. It's because the man is black.

Hey, I didn't make it. I stole it.

You might want to delete this comment lol

For my $0.02 (of my $11), it's that Pures kinda put paid to the idea of "just fight back and anti-pk lol" for a lot of level brackets.
---
 Sure, just "fight back" in a PVP system with a high skill floor against an account that is specifically designed just to kill other accounts.
---
Its good for ToB.

And you only need 72 thieving, can use https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Summer_sq%27irkjuice for a +3. But thieving is quick anyway so its up to you.
---
Stop trying to push the podcast on people. I'm entitled to an opinion and I voiced it. Stop acting like the sun shines out of their ass.
---
Because beginner clues are f2p and bird nests are a members' item.
---
I mean every RPG rewards min-maxing stats and pures are just doing that
---
If the only issue people have with a change is that it's trying to be inclusive of other builds, then I can't say that I really care and I would question why you care. I doubt the removal of the defense requirement changes the content much at all, it literally just makes the content available for accounts that want low defense levels. And there's no harm in adding negative XP lamps, I'm really not sure why that failed the poll. 
---
Point 2 does affect the wider game but for mid level accounts that the dungeon was aimed for, it's a small cost. And it's also a cost you would have to incur regardless, just so happens that you would get prayer XP.
---
It does suck more for Iron Men, but if the point of the post is that you shouldn't be catering to limited accounts then that shouldn't be a consideration and it's a self defeating argument.

The HP is made up for by low DEF, so even if it's higher than GWD bosses, it takes about time same to kill as Zulrah or Vorkath. IDK about loot yet because we don't have droprates, I was getting like 25k/kill though which is pretty ass, should be double that.
---
I agree about the web shit though, especially since you can skip the stall anyways with a mind shield. Maybe lower the HP a bit, make the webs last longer, hit randomly like Verzik, and let teammates slash you out of the webs.
---
It‚Äôs honestly amazing. It‚Äôs kinda like a rewarding rspsw
---
Yah... It's getting nerfed because people in rags are bitching about not being able to beat someone using a 5m+ defensive item. 
---
&gt; Players want Jagex to hold their hand and protect them from everything now
---
Same. Exact. Thing. 
---
Hell. If you enjoy the absolutely risk-free PVP of OSRS, then you are part of the problem. There is basically no major risk outside of GP. I remember the time where dying meant praying that you could make it back to your spot before your Torso/FC/Void disappeared. Hoping that they don't freeze you to troll you.

---
I mean you literally can't solo TOB without inefficient Woox shit so making it soloable would be catering to Ironmen in a way
---
none of what you posted affects you in any way. Stop being such a little bitch. Jagex caters to Ironman, high level players etc all the time. But when pures benefit, people like you crawl out of your caves.... 
---
M-muh 200k worth of dragon bones!! Smh...
---
PVMers are absolutely jumping on it being people in no risk who are complaining.  That's absolutely not the case at all.  Even with a decent risk, bulwark is still stupidly overpowered for only being 6m and risking nothing.
---
Probably for the best when you think how much waste os involved with making and distribution of physical copies but it's majorly sucks to be in a download only world with a shit internet speed.
---
I thought there would be more ‚Äòtrickery‚Äô behind it than ‚ÄòHere take this and click it.‚Äô to be completely honest lol.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs somerhing I wouldn‚Äôt fall for especially when I wear gear that expensive.
---
He's literally implying black d'hide = ancestral robes though
---
&gt; The issue however is that I could be in full ancestral arcane toxic staff etc and still splash 10 times in a row with augury on
---
That's just not true though, I go out deep wild with the bois on the regular in mystics/ahrims with toxic and augury and catch freezes on Dinh's easily.
---
The real issue is the 20% reduction on all incoming damage along with the 40% reduction on incoming damage with overhead prayers resulting in a 60% damage reduction assuming the overheads are timed correctly. Now this doesn't equate to the splashing that everyone is referring to as splashing is calculated on magic accuracy, not damage. 
---
The Nerf itself is barely even going to change how the Dinh's performs in tanking. Out of boredom I did the maths, assuming the attack and tanker are in the following gear:
---
Attacker:
---
Ahrims Hood
---
Ardy Cape 4
---
Glory
---
Toxic
---
Mystic top and bottom
---
Book of Darkness
---
Mystic Boots
---
B Gloves
---
Seers
---
Tanker:
---
Serp Helm
---
Ardy Cape
---
Dinhs
---
Black d'hide top and bottom
---
Mystic boots
---
Rune Gloves
---
The calculations come out as follows:
---
Pre Nerf:
---
107/(2*(112+1) = 0.47% chance of freeze
---
Post Nerf:
---
1-(102+2)/(2*(107+1)) = 0.51% chance of freeze
---
So put in layman's terms this nerf will give you a 0.04% freeze advantage or even simpler, you'll catch 1 more freeze in every 25 possible freezes.
---
Everyone needs to chill out with this nerf, it changes quite literally nothing game wise, the real issue is that Jagex are making in-game changes that affect the gameplay (regardless of how nominal) without polling.
---
[Mean Girls](https://youtu.be/mXovJSCc6M0)
---
You would be risking it because your in the wilderness. Just because you specifically arent attacking back doesnt mean he isnt going to run into someone who is going to attack back, or another pker, or a clan..
---
Seriously, Craft skill cape is amazing. Unlimited, super quick bank Tele. And it's a bank chest, so no dialogue box to click

Because they are lmao.

üòÇ I'll give you that one, made me laugh

Yah I agree, it‚Äôs rarity would make it worth way more with increased PvM use. But it‚Äôs just not the case rn
---
Q
---
Yep. Nobody‚Äôs likes kids who DDoS to win their battles.
---
A raid against another team would most likely just get farmed by 1 team losing on purpose with alts for example like castle wars can‚Äôt really see a way around this
---
Nice reeeepoasttttt
---
*Psst playing a bit as a dumb middle schooler like most of us, quitting for 10 years, then picking it back up when OSRS came out doesn't mean you've been playing for 10+ years*
---
idk man sounds like another rev cave, which means clans will just hold it down making it impossible for small teams/solo to compete
---
It's more or less the d pick equivalent in gear for training at black chins
---
Expected coming from this sub.  Worst part is that they fail to see that the freezing range weapon (I forget the actual name) can be used by pvmer to get gap and escape as it‚Äôs ranged based and 1 inv spot.
---
As much as I see your point, remember that an SGS in inferno would be worth more to use as you can heal twice. This on the other hand would reduce your food considerably but I mean then you can heal up with blood barrage. But I didn‚Äôt think of it. You‚Äôre right. Mind if I ask, what would be a better special instead?
---
Im sure you can make a gloden gnome worthy meme with this dentence you just posted. Truuuu
---
3 vissy aswell wtf lol I would go put on the lottery if I were you
---
yea and i could kill kbd 1000 times and not get the pet, everythings comes down to RNG. so using an example like ‚Äúif i wear x i can still splash x amount of times‚Äù is pointless when almost everything in this game is rng based
---
One thing i didnt really understand is that the blog said DMM is retired? Is there gonna be no more DMM?
---
Finished arma and bandos in one day btw
---
It‚Äôs sad that you have to explain this to PK‚Äôers. 
---
But also imagine how different the wild would be if you auto-skulled upon entry.
---
I think there will be too many exploits if negative xp lamps becomes a thing, either that or you would have to spend a lot of dev time just to make sure its secure, and nothing is ever secure. Even if you can only remove like &lt;500xp there will always be someone with too much time that finds a way to get something locked behind defence and then revert back.
---
So you‚Äôre saying just leave pvmers alone and only fight other pkers, even though the pvmers entered the wilderness fully understanding the risks. 
---
Thats kinda backwards, and if you‚Äôre relying on an op gearset to ensure no one can kill you, it isn‚Äôt really fair either.  Dihns should be good at what it was made for; pvm, where monsters can hit 80‚Äôs or insta kill you and the defence would negate part of that. Rather than another player who is on a level playing field as you, and cant hit those kinds of hits, or use special mechanics like a vorkath fireball. Hell, once your special attack runs out you pretty much lose all K0 potential save running someone out of supplies.
---
Paying 200g to remove trees from patches, your turn.
---
Pking should be at least 20x the risk to the pker than the person being attacked it's a high risk thing to do so yea defence should have the edge over offence.
---
But for one item and negating its main weakness with 14k worth of black d'hide- being able to square up against max gear, is a bit ridiculous
---
And here I thought the only brainlets were pures
---
All jokes aside I think these criticisms are poorly conveyed and supported, also the ENTIRE ironman mode was made because of self restricted accs
---
Is this to poll an MTX cape for a ‚Äúveteran cape‚Äù
---
Please say no.
---
Describe how you think banking was nerfed. I know what you‚Äôre talking about and you‚Äôre categorically wrong. I want to hear your thought process.
---
Yeah it wouldn't be worth it.  I'd end up getting throttled - if I wasn't renting the place I'd run a line to the house (only like $1k) but I'm just renting so I've resigned to accept it.
---
To be honest, they should poll it.
---
That face shows all the emotions that happen in a split second; it's incredible. Well done!
---
Unless a quest reward impacts the PVP meta I don't see the point of combat stat locking quests tbh.
---
get ready for the hate train, that is insane dude, seriously go out and buy a powerball ticket.
---
You can skip the stall with a mind shield, huh?
---
I‚Äôve not gotten anywhere close to Vorkath kill times, even challying for 100 off the bat my kills are like 3 minutes, even in some fairly optimal gear, so I cant imagine mid levels having a great time.
---
I found the average drop to be around 25k yeah
---
It would be fine if you're risking the shield.
---
Shit... Back when I was younger, I used to get 2 bucks a day for getting a lunch at school. I never ate at school, I kept the money and bought shit at the store later. There was a couple times I would just buy a package of otros and eat the whole thing in one sitting. Surprisingly I don't have the diabetes today
---
Camelot gang wya?
---
Go around trying to role play, usually have to goto f2p for that but you can lucky in 2k worlds too.
---
Ahh okay I totally see the issue with it. Do you find there's any room for a similar item if it was tweaked at all?
---
I ask because originally I was on board but I did not think of the issues you had just mentioned. But I'm curious if any sort of ranged "freeze" could work
---
Pvp gamers don't tend to be the most intelligent sort. They actually tend to be the short tempered whining neck beards that gives the rest of the gaming community a bad rep.
---
That's what people felt ruined it before, the randomness
---
Arguably one of the most useful capes for sure
---
I get a solid 4-6 hours of nothing a day at my engineering job. And the rest of the time I could play idly.
---
Possibly because you‚Äôre the noob screenshotting  (badly) random players to shit on them on reddit and assume they bought their gold with a credit card, when he‚Äôs not even wearing anything THAT expensive.
---
too*
---
mobile good
---
&gt; All the players that have played OSRS  
---
  
---
Ehhhh, that sounds like it will be skewed by things like bots, alts, and one-time-players.
---
Dudes good for a bit he got two extra vissys lol
---
you hear that suckaaa,  everything been had been made.
---
Consistency separates good pkers from great pkers. You may get a couple clean gear, pray, and barrage switches, but can you keep it up throughout the entire fight when its neck and neck?
---
I think he's saying every player gets the same build but it would randomize which build that is each game.
---
Why make the effort to respond then?
---
People doing black chins or chaos altar
---
The d pick costs 6m, who the fuck is using it at PvM
---
So im basically paying either 5 dragonstones or 100 dragonbones to use the altar? That's gonna be a hard pass from me instead.
---
That means they'd also have to remove items from the chests, right? I mean, can't have a 1 def build with Torag legs.
---
Never would I of thought my home-state would be mentioned on this subreddit. 
---
Shut up, and take this upvote sir! Haha
---
I would get tired of that clicking noise after 8 teleports.
---
Or.
---
The ability to remove/add runes from the bank.
---
I mean, I'm a skiller. I have vested interest in Jagex not nerfing it to make my life a lot easier when doing wilderness content.
---
But as it is now, it's not hard to tell it's pretty unhealthy.
---
I would never want to swindle the almighty H8's gp.
---
You kill the boss faster, meaning you do get more rewards since you can make more gp/hr. What idiots are upvoting this? 
---
There is no risk in pvm outside of wilderness, and risk doesn‚Äôt equal rewards in wilderness. It‚Äôs easy to see how pkers find this unfair
---
Hacking you now, gg.
---
Nope. Not yet anyway ;)
---
You don't own 6m?
---
I understand wanting to avoid confusing players, but seeing people splashing also teaches them what that is. I think it‚Äôs pretty weird to restrict areas where we can do things we can do in others, or could previously do in those areas. This seems like a heavy bandaid fix for a niche problem if you‚Äôre looking at the player experience as something that needs to be heavily guided. OSRS is a MMORPG and so many of us LOVE it because of the different play styles it offers. People play all sorts of restricted accounts and have so many goals; there are people who have gotten 99 stats without ever using an ‚Äúintended‚Äù method (pumping blast furnace as an example). *BOTS* are a problem that new players shouldn‚Äôt be exposed to, players using valid methods of gameplay aren‚Äôt, new players should see these players and learn that they have those options.
---
Should we tell him?

Who are you kidding? Not expensive? It's obvious he didn't earn it.  I only reddit on phone not pc btw.

Very well drawn. The expression is perfect.
---
Oof
---
Honestly made the wilderness more sp00py and less empty.
---
Thoughts?
---
Looks like he‚Äôs having fun while you know, playing a video game.
---
I personally think any PvP with 99 defense is quite boring. I‚Äôd say cap it at 75. This was also a problem in DMM and other PvP tournaments - everyone had 99 or near 99 defense. Bunch of 0s makes for boring gameplay.
---
Feet gets an upvote
---
But who is using this shield...?
---
&gt;Reworked the requirements of the Elf City quest to remove the defense requirement.
---
Why are low level pking accounts getting to decide the requirements of an end game grandmaster quest?
---
By this logic, why are PvMers allowed to vote on PvP updates if it's not made for them? The simple answer is, is that everyone in this game gets an opinion on how updates roll out, regardless of whether you PvM, quest or whatever.  You can't just decide that this grandmaster quest (which obviously is made for an endgame area, it's a GM quest) is ONLY for people that decide that their accounts are not restricted. 
---
I'd also like to remind you that this community is one of the most toxic ones i've ever seen when it comes to ANYTHING PvP related - do you not remember when the adamant gloves poll came out? Pures got shot down then, pures got shot down again when the KQ head poll was announced.  Everyone shits on pures just because it is a different way of playing the game, but why does this matter? While our accounts are limited, does our opinion not hold just as much weight as yours? 
---
Can't speak on 2, as I don't know enough about the new area - but the mod talked about it below on why. 3rd one I can't see being a huge problem if it's put in correctly!
---
No I don't mind it. It's just silly to say it's *not* an ironman-focused update.
---
I dont mind dying and losing my stuff, im a garbage player so 99% of the times i die its my own fault. The thing i dont enjoy is being forced into the wilderness to get items i kinda need on my account and have no other way of getting. Like i guess if i want 99 mining ill just use a rune pickaxe or grind out master clues (and drop the ones that put me in wildy) 
---
You shouldnt be shoehorned into the wildy to progress firstly and secondly they shouldnt nerf defensive items so that you can die easier when you get pk'd

Then one guy has a thing he shouldn't for 1 day until someone else notices and he gets banned for bug abuse and it gets fixed. What on earth is the big issue?
---
Very good. Expecting more, bub.
---
I think you need to log out completely, you can't switch world's in game
---
it's 2/772. or, simplified, 1/386.
---
or, if you're smart, it's 50/50
---
No, you just clearly want PKing to be too easy. 
---
I never had a problem taking down bulwark with a small team other than a select few times, mainly by my misclicks from my excitement of getting his bones; which was my fault for screwing up. 
---
I also don‚Äôt wear full welfare and expect to demolish him and catch every freeze.  
---
Nor do I want my small team, or a PKing clan to have even  more of an advantage than we already have in this dying state of the wilderness. 
---
These changes isn‚Äôt going to bring  fresh meat to the wilderness, it‚Äôs going to stop even more people from going there due to the ridiculous changes.
---
"I only risk my own bones"
---
-death
---
"Really? Again? You know I have no risk."
---
"Fine, I'll hop."
---
This but unironically, thouse of us with littereally zero interest in pvp gaming should have the option to opt out.
---
Sure, but things have changed. It's now an official game mode that something like 30% of the playerbase actively plays, so it's a large enough fraction of the community to warrant *some* attention at this point. Pures who want to engage in pvm content are a much much smaller fraction, and not an official game mode.
---
It was too random before. This is more randomizing the class everyone is playing in. Some strategies would change depending on the starting gear and upgrade paths
---
Because he wants to?
---
got your ip already thanks for the account
---
Good to know that real noobs still exist
---
Careful with that. I‚Äôve seen posts and comments about people geting banned for using that foot thingy.
---
Yeah me either. Lol. Maybe half a fight
---
My mistake, forgot that part.
---
Yeah, that's when you tell them to give you their rune armour and after they give it to you just sell it and ignore them.
---
This seems good.
---
If there's players that we "shouldn't be catering to" it's those who are so pathetically bad at the game that 200k worth of dragon bones is something to waste a sentence complaining about.

It never stops, there will always be new ways and that requires dev time to iron out every small weird interactions about quest xp and items you wear that you can no longer wear for little to no benefit.
---
Never trust a South Carolinian!
---
You have to actually go fight a boss (stronger enemy) and kill it. Like i said.
---
I cant just go hit target dummies or goblins and claim i deserve bank because im wearing good gear
---
Yall complaining about pvm players not dropping millions is like me complaining that i havent gotten any good drops from the goblins outside lumbridge
---
&gt;id probably play an iron if I wasn‚Äôt so far in my main
---
Haha do I feel you there. I said that for 2.5 years, until I maxed and made an iron. Try it. You'll wish you had done it sooner. And gathering quest items is really not a big deal. Everything just take a slight bit longer but that's well worth it.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much all I did! Just used AHK to remap my numpad keys like that video. Haven‚Äôt tinkered with the program beyond that. I have a feeling it is indeed a hardware bug with my numpad, which is why I followed that AHK route. 
---
Appreciate the heads up though man!
---
What if some areas single and some multi? Multi areas can have a slight increase in luck, maybe like 10%.
---
Not everyone wants to just hop worlds all the time, its inconvenient and Id usually expect not to be killed twice, or more often in a row. Sometimes I have to.
---
Level 3s don‚Äôt have armor unless their main acct gave them it
---
I don't follow. What's 2/772?
---
Why couldn't they just update magic so that there is no negative magic bonus to allow you to always splash, i.e. There will always been a small chance to hit.
---
Ooooof
---
The changes don't seem ridiculous to me
---
The guy running south from black chins will die like 20% more of the time, still not lose the item, big deal.
---
The new LMS is a good start. Would like to see different gear setups. You risk nothing and can practice. Also, you can play got money as well. It looks great.
---
No they are the east and west bank.
