There are two things you should do that you might already know. When it's wave 42 before you end it, if you have the supplies just wait a bit and breathe. Take note where the orange one is that is where jad spawns and go behind one of the rocks that would seperate jad and you and breathe more until you are not stressed out. It's fairly easy once you are calm, take one action at a time and use the keybinding for prayer and inventory.

Just any % it like any other game. That's usually the main quest line... So I guess a quest cape is completing the game.

Questing burnt me the fuck out. I hate questing with a passion it just feels like homework to me, I used two methods though. There was a week where I did like 5 quests a day, and others where I did a quest a day. Hated both, but getting through the quests ASAP was better imo. It let me get back to what I actually enjoyed doing in the game more.
---
I‚Äôve never been one to stick to one game for months at a time, but I do always end up returning to OSRS burnt out or not. So in the end I say do the grind and if you burn out then that‚Äôs okay. You can always pick it up later, that‚Äôs what I do at least. This isn‚Äôt practical though if you‚Äôre struggling to pay for bonds of course.

where did you hear this? this hasnt been confirmed anywhere
---
i know they want imbues to be moved, but they cant lock it behind something with any requirements with all the pures with imbues.
---
I actually went through and read it. This person has no idea how runescape works... in fact they confused market regulation  (buy limits) as some form of capitalist plot to stop the working class...
---
They claimed that communist took over all of world 32 and changed the whole economy and distributed wealth, then went on to say that jagex took party hats which where a parent 2b in osrs (according to them) and made it worth nothing as some kind of conspiracy to fuck over socialist. They fundamentally don't even understand communism, they just know how to type working class, and understands a word for the ruling class in french exists.
---
It was god awful, and was all lies. Not cause I don't agree with them, but for the fact it's incoherent chapo kid rant, and that it's literally impossible for what was described to happen. Anyone that played runescape a little understands more about economy more than this person.

I'm 100% this a troll or an April's fool joke. There is just a magnitude never seen before on how factually wrong you can be, and still get something published.

Yo, lend me the gear and take me with you. Learning raids is good enough of a reward for me, let alone taking 100m!

Jokes aside, I'd be greatful to have people teach me raids and lend me gear. I can understand why they are upset but I also believe they are becoming a bit spoilled. If you really care,  Yo you shouldn't ruin a friendship over a game thus I'd stop having then come with. They're in mid-game reaching end-game and have already experienced a lot of the content many don't ever get to see.

This was during QAs months ago. I can try to find it later on, but they  said Warding would be holding Imbues if it passed, it neither warding nor Imbues passed then Imbues would be removed from NMZ regardless and they'd be removing all current imbues from all items in the game, making people re earn them with the new content they'd be added to.

wtf
---
&gt; i really dont get this argument vs rs, "all you do it point and click!" but cant any game be simplified to its inputs?
---
Pretty much. One of the most popular PC strategy game series, Civilization, is a "point and click" game. The only controller you need to play the game is a mouse. Hearthstone is a "point and click" game. There are many popular games that can be played with only a mouse, if you felt like it, and it would be considered "point and click."
---
Most of the comments indicated that. Obviously I am indicating that I disagree with that.
---
Maybe have clues/caskets ready to go?
---
No word if mimics will be added retroactively to pre-existing clues/caskets though. For example, when farming guild came out, new seeds didn't feature in old nests.
---
Maybe stock up on implings? They may go up in price on release if they haven't already.
---
No
---
Fucking dumbass.
---
It's a dangerous meta they've created by letting this go on. It narrows the scope of content they can create when everyone has access to tools like this, since they have to take into account that these clients exist whenever they make an update. They have to design content to not be breakable by clients but also not so obscure that it's ridiculous. 
---
Should I mention the hypocrisy concerning paid client features being fine but micro transactions being off the table?

Oh yes, always the end-goal. Any tips on not burning out in the grind? I've noticed past about lvl 70, skill training seems to slow way down

---
This works on all the barrels with the same model [you can see another one outside ardy at the end of this vid](https://youtu.be/XHZrMFqLie0?t=416) 
---
There are barrels like this in most bars in rs, the top floor of the towers in lumbridge (by the pickaxe spawn) and plenty of other random places. 
---
Graphically updated pubs like the one in seers village have a different type of barrel that you cannot get beer from though
---
&gt; currently reading this on mobile while my desktop yew longs away just like that, lmao
---
Keeping a consistent art style is important though. Just because something is graphically superior, doesnt mean it belongs in the game, imagine if the dragons used the models of skyrim's dragons.
---
That's too bad; it seems like this bard actually knows some tunes to summon Rngesus incarnate...
---
**Rngesus Incarnate**
---
What am I even talking about...

Wait no hold the phone I think I'm onto something
---
Rngesus is a deity, but he is also pretty fiendish sometimes...
---
Something something trust in the heart of the cards, and you will come out on top.
---
Double nats aren't even where the money is, right now Astrals are better and better exp, and Wraths are more profitable than both sitting at about 1.6m/hr.
---
eoc
---
Would rather spend another year in mlm than do sandstone tbh.
---
You're using style of the content and the content itself as if they're interchangeable. You can love the content without liking how it looks.
---
Yup, I did mostly profitable methods until I could afford that stuff I mentioned, but now that I have Rigour and DHCB, Vork is my moneymaker and im finishing up RC with lavas.
---
Well you didn't say that part..
---
OH MY GOD. I have to watch that again. 
---
yeah im just saying that its all high level rc, and most people have access to much higher gp/hrs by the time they get that rc level
---
Not actually a bad idea

So your assumption is that everyone wants diary cape then? Lol... That's really not terribly far off max cape you know. Most players will not end up with a diary cape. Try again. 
---
I disagree as far as mechanical clicking goes. 1.5t teaks is harder than the clicks necessary for the inferno.
---
That said, being able to react to variable situations in the inferno and staying calm through zuk is an additional challenge that makes the inferno harder overall (obviously).
---
I like Paizuri and this was really sad to read, I am glad he is getting help. Kudos to Thurco for acting on his instinct.

Not anymore actually, with current rates you still have to do almost 92 million Range exp post Slayer.
---
Preserve isn't nearly as important at this bracket because of the fast pace of fights and the rate of which you end up needing to use brews. A better alternative to using preserve and fewer brews is just to have good cb pot management in terms of using it during specs and not wasting it. That tends to be more of a problem in nh rather than veng style pking, but it's important in both cases. In any case, I don't think that it's worth redoing the whole account for the sake of 52 vs 55 pray, as I think you would still be getting the same fights in bh.

Ugh. Script kiddies.

&gt; Hackers try this stuff in other games, and if someone is proven to be hacked a GM will simply reset the account then give the player back all their items.

Suggested block lists for slayer? I am really annoyed with Hellhounds and Black Demons but I've heard that Hellhounds are good xp and Black Demon tasks become more bearable after I am able to do Demonic Gorillas for money. I currently have Steel Dragons and Spiritual Creatures blocked but haven't done enough high level slayer to become familiar with the tasks.

Will salve (ei) stack w/ slay helm on these?

correct. the game doesn't allow weird characters in general. there was actually a glitch a while back where you could type a certain special character and literally everyone who could see it in public chat  would crash. people exploited this by attacking people in wildy/pvp worlds and then force dcing the world. ever since then the characters presumably have a whitelist.

I think it's a culmination of multiple things.
---
‚Ä¢ A lot of the new players from mobile release that have been playing casually are doing farm runs, but not many are high enough level to do late/end game PvM where most brews/restores end up getting used (CoX specifically).
---
‚Ä¢ This time of the year, a lot of items typically dip. School breaks are over, a lot of people in school, so more people playing casually (not really doing late/end game content, more AFK/mobile).
---
‚Ä¢ Theater of Blood is becoming more and more meta. As more people learn it, less people are doing CoX / Vorkath / Zulrah / etc. In ToB, a lot of people actually PROFIT restores. You bring 1-2 in, buy 3-5 for Verzik, and typically only use 2 for the Verzik fight. Granted there are exceptions to this (New players that don't properly manage their potions and restore after every brew dose, high efficiency players that bring in 2 restores to avoid flicking prayer and only have room to bring in 2-3 restores for Verzik, etc.), but I'd be willing to bet ToB has brought more restores into the game than its taken out.
---

---
Thanks for the easy guide! Just maxed my Ultimate Iron Man :)
---
It varies heavily, depending on if you're after profit or XP. Check the skilling discord for max xp/h block lists, if you're after profit then just block things like black demons (til you can do demonics), hellhounds (til you can do cerb), bloodvelds, etc.
---
his weekly act stupid on stream so kids donate with mommy and daddy's credit card.  Shame that it works and you have 1200 people watching his dumb ass while he laughs while watching the donations come in.  Hope his dumb ass gets banned from twitch.
---
Its...a lava cape. Where do you see green or blue lava???
---
If only RS3 devs were like this.
---
Just something relating to the mix of new content coming in. Osrs mixes textures and models for visual fidelity. Recently a lot of new content only models, bringing it closer to rs3.
---
Could the floors be textured the floors like the tower of life instead of modeling planks them? I think it would help it fit in closer to osrs aesthetic. 
---
Since most classic and memorable areas do this, say a tree trunk is modeled but its "leaves" aren't blobs but textures instead.
---
You aren‚Äôt even over the droprate? Who makes this kind of post without being at least 2x droprate

We‚Äôve come to expect that from Jagex.

Best tip I had for that is jad spawns where the orange 360 spawns

This is the correct one. But don't be discouraged to rock the scimmy if you don't got the cash. Most slayer monsters it will Excell in with pots, and slayer helm. That said, a upgrade is still an upgrade.

Try updating your drivers to the latest version. The RuneLite devs test this and fix bugs all the time. When something "works" but doesn't look quite right, that's usually a telltale sign that you have to update to the same driver version that the people that made the software were testing on.
---
This is better.
---
Isn't the only point so you can pk low level players super easy without any risk and without them expecting it. Basically, dick move. But it is part of the game so I can't really whine about it.
---
  
---
Personally I feel like a character with high stats in every skill is way more fun to pvp with simply because you'd be fighting people at your skill level instead of easy kills on new players.
---
But whatever makes these pvp people happy :)
---
Honestly awesome. Keep up the great work!
---
what world im legit thieving
---
Have you ever considered making your RNG better?
---
Because you, like many of us, come from a time when runescape was a medieval fantasy game and not all about efficiency. Thats how you can tell the same people that played years ago are still playing today or returning - we all grew up and things got more serious and people started to research instead of wearing whatever looked cool and doing whatever was funnest (looking at you, castle wars)
---
I'm not sure tbh, always done combat stats through slayer/raiding and have basically no experience chinning... It'd be easy enough to test tho if you plan on chinning anyway.
---
3k is literally the droprate and I've killed a few after this, so I am over the droprate. And have you ever done this boss? It's awful. Just want some Reddit luck.
---
&gt;Wish they would put their brains to some better use, the site and everything is so legit i mean they have so much potential to be doing something else, something legit.
---
Honest work makes less money than dishonest work in many parts of the planet.
---
Raid with them and accept you will split or dont raid with them and dont split. Ez.
---
Fuck eh
---
Too high quality damn
---
Its based on what is most efficient to do in every skill. So its possible to get 200k wc xp/hr, so 1 EHP (1 efficient hours played) is 200k XP. So if you have 20M woodcutting XP you have 100 EHP (roughly because pre-99 rates are different) and it works like that for every skill.
---
What‚Äôs so important about w324 not being a PvP world?
---
$11/$11
---
Yeah I've read the page it tells me to turn off DT and RFD but when i do i get 700 points per boss, thats the problem. I get so few points per hr with these methods that im barely covering the cost of absorbs and overloads
---
Can you make a maze random in nmz?
---
What grub room? You mean the thieving one? Yea the worms could be made stackable too.
---
Sure. What I mean is that Fire Max Cape shouldnt be a thing because we have Infernal Cape (Best in slot) Max Capes shouldnt have variants of the cape that arent best in slot. Just like there isnt legends max cape or obby max cape, that would be very silly. So Fire Max Cape, in my opinion, needs to be removed.
---
How would they know he broke the rules
---
This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen 
---
&gt; Ice demons magic level no longer boosts magic defence
---
i heard rumors of the weird changes. One idea i had was to make his magic level lower but his Magic accuracy will roll off his Ranged attack bonus so it will effectively be the same as before. Except this time magic will not splash as much.
---
And how many years did it take you to find them
---
It‚Äôs a day old you‚Äôre too late for a decent response.
---
Got tourmaline core at 12 and pet at 18kc. Can‚Äôt relate 
---
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks! I can see how it's kinda redundant.
---
I don't support paid client features, but that's irrelevant because RuneLite is free.  And I think its a bit of a stretch to say that QOL features are severely limiting content development, if at all even.  And if something like menu swapping or whatever is holding back the devs, maybe they should think of more creative ways to make the game challenging than adding minor annoyances to already repetitive tasks
---
Ideally you use your blocks for common tasks  - since Steel Dragons don't come up that often, you're better off just skipping and using the block spots for more common, shit tasks (like black demons).
---
In the end, if you don't enjoy a task, just don't do it 
---
Not long. About 6-ish months. I got the Heron randomly while fishing monks. Never intentionally grinded for them or anything. 
---
Again, I was joking. I don't actually want pets to be rarer. 
---

---
I just turn the camera
---
They keep posting shit cause people like you react to it.
---
On avg u get about 60k wc xp for redwood pre 97 wc. 
---
Like i said, if you dont mind the running and raking of roots which i find it a nuisance over time, mushrooms are definitely alot better than yew. 
---
Yew is for lazy people like me who prefer xp with reasonable rate and afkness. 
---
2/10
---
Ah yes. Swampletics eve
---
Bases on most efficient rates for example I think an ehp lf fishing js 115k xp it may take you an hour, or it may take you 3 but either way its 1 ehp
---
How many points do you get by the end of one game of nmz? I‚Äôm trying to imagine how you‚Äôre not covering absorbs and overloads. In theory an inv of absorbs and 5-6 and 1 rock cake can last you at least 4 hours 
---
Olm is a salamander btw
---
Do you know how the teleport to the boss will work with the wilderness?
---
If it's an optional teleport, do we lose the chance to fight the boss by opening the casket beyond 30 wilderness?
---
If it's a forced teleport, will we still be teleported from beyond 30 wilderness?
---
If it is going to be an optional boss, that might be better be done by having an extra untradeable teleport to the boss drop in the scroll, a la dark totems or giant keys. That way the whole question of "can you teleport from here" is avoided at the cost of 1 more clue item.
---
I'm sure this has been addressed internally, but it's a huge concern I have regarding this release.
---
i mean if you are using justicar there isnt much learning of the waves, you just run south. you want 2 range pots and bolt switches, if you can get to 62 you should be bringing them.
---
Looks like he's doing 3 way switches. I don't really see ahk here because he didn't 1 tick any barrages and had pretty normal looking switches. The most complicated thing he did that I saw was a 3 way switch and a 2 way 1 tick attack from whip into rune cbow.
---
I appreciate your usage of the n in your edit
---
It‚Äôs literally like this in the skills tab idk why it was ever a debate lol
---
Torment and suffering for sure 
---
That would be his third time getting perm banned on a top 15 ehp account so i think he can handle it.
---
Yolo
---
Also it's a linear transmission. None of the back to nuetral from any gear and reset bullshit

My phone does that when I turn it on its side.

Heyo, I‚Äôd recommend trying to find a video of someone doing it on YouTube with low stats.

If you die you‚Äôll lose your items, which could be quite devastating.

I don‚Äôt want to be a meme, but I suggest paying the $11, getting membership, and coming better prepared. Or else train for higher stats.

Gotta find somethin to complain about I guess

sell your pegs for anguish. buy torm, save for heart. use dhide and ahrims.
---
go and show love and support? no? he‚Äôs a bad person. stop feeding him. 
---
Not an expert but probably has something to do with greater player numbers/mobile players doing less click intensive things/more afk things like fishing and cooking. Many newer players being at these lower levels bring in more of these mid level items
---
Yeah obviously is, there are ways to move gp without trading as well that should be looked into. During the period of time when free trade was removed people were RWT by manipulating GE buy and sell prices on low volume items. Essentially  "merching" from both sides. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case. It would make it hard to ban someone when you can't link the two accounts.
---
All you would need is a group of people and a front for high volumes of buying and selling........
---
This guy gets it

Did this back in 07 to get unlimited HP at Hill giants/Hob goblins. There's a Barrel right by the stairs in Edgeville dungeon. Salmons were like 70 EA, fuck that
---
Thank you!

I wonder why they didn't at least use an unsigned 32 bit integer, considering you can never have a negative amount of gold. It would bring up the max cash stack to 4,294,967,295.

Lmao 5 maples sounds like a lot more work than 1 calquat.

I will say that the bank interface update is such a great update that I am glad that mobile pushed them to make it

SwiftKit isn't even close to what RuneLite, OSBuddy, etc. do. It was literally just the game in an iframe with some calculators and stuff on the side. It didn't actually modify the client in any way, it just displayed stuff next to it. I wouldn't even call it a 3rd party client, it was just a frame with useless stuff that went around the client.
---
they will ban them but its usually not permanent

---
It depends what you're doing and what gear you already have. It's likely there is other gear that would be more useful to you right now than those things (sgs and bludgeon only have niche uses, tassets are not a very good gear upgrade for the price). Some other options you should consider: primordials (better value than tassets), amulet of torture/anguish, 82 construction for ornate pool, 78 herblore for raids, training up other skills.
---
I think a decent amount of people know Paizuri somewhat personally. As far as I'm aware he actually connected with a fair number of people in the community, so I wouldn't be surprised if people know his address.
---
When is that supposed to be added? Along with the Priffdinas and Song of the Elves quest?
---
How are we supposed to know what you plan to do on zeah ;~;

People really be out here saying ‚Äòr‚Äô bomb now huh

I mean if you're afking nmz I'd do msb (I) and rune arrows.  I averaged like 65k xp an hour on my pure like that at 99 ranged.

I haven't watched the stream yet, does the casket mention that it's a mimic if it is one or something? Otherwise, you're risking loot for a teleport.
---
The points are based on how many bosses you have enabled, along with the dream mentor and desert treasure bosses have a big points multiplier.
---
So turn on the desert treasure and dream mentor bosses, and disable the rest of the bosses that wiki mentions. The desert treasure bosses will be annoying to kill, but with them and the dream mentor bosses enabled you should be getting at least 800k points an hour using a whip/normal gear if your melee stats are 80+.
---
Notes about the DT bosses:
---
You'll want to bring ice gloves to kill Fareed.
---
Avoid killing Damis, as his second form will drain prayer. An ancient mace could be useful to restore your prayer in the event that you accidentally kill his first form, alternatively a prayer potion would work.
---
If Kamil spawns, his freeze will constantly interrupt you which can get annoying. I normally just spam click him until he dies.
---
This is fucking amazing 
---
You know a girl?

They usually do actually compare phone numbers and post codes with various records where available. If you enter a phone number that couldn't actually exist it's much easier to say "gratz on your vote" and disregard it than it is to alert you that your vote wasn't allowed. If they did that you might keep trying until you actually circumvented the rules. It's possible it was botted but they have a lot to lose in credibility if they aren't strict about who gets to enter votes. 
---
Essentially yes. I don't know how much your familiar with the combat system so I'll just give a brief overview. Pardon me if it's too basic or too much information. Your combat is based on two things Accuracy, how often you hit, and Max Hit, the range of hits you can do. 
---
Your accuracy rolls off things such as your stance type bonuses (accurate, controlled, defensive, long range), your attack level (range level for ranged and magic level for magic), and prayer. On top of that you get your equipment bonus based on your attack style. Using stab will use your stab attack bonus. Attack level increases are worth more than equipment attack bonuses due to prayer however equipement bonus upgrades are usually easier to get. However its usually better to go for strength bonuses to increase your max hit than go for accuracy.

Wait runelite counts hydra attacks?!
---
&gt;The majority of players buying a rune platebody or a dragon plateskirt are not looking to wear them; alchers buy these by the hundreds. A massive drop in demand for items like these would lower the price dramatically and make them accessible to new players.
---
Those are already very accessible to new players though.
---
&gt;If losing your gear didn't matter as much because things were cheaper, players would risk more in the wilderness. Death wouldn't really matter.
---
No, they wouldn't. Bringing more things doesn't equal more risk, if the net worth of those items is lower.
---
Other than that, valid observation.
---
I‚Äôm so outa the loop with the memes. Like what‚Äôs up with the crab? I like the music and it‚Äôs kinda funny with the dancing crab. But I don‚Äôt get how it relates to the controversies like $11 or that torvesta guy(was he banned?).

You passively get fossils while doing stuff on fossil island, fossils average out to about 800 prayer xp each and when you a ton and decide to turn them in you can get about 300-550k prayer xp/hr depending on the type you are using.

What about getting an Android emulator and playing mobile on your Surface?
---
I thought about this, but I don't think it'd be an issue. 
---
I'm not sure how the game would re-shape, but I can make a couple of educated guesses. First, players would still be trying to get rich. Second, without spending time doing things like farming monsters who drop rune daggers, players would probably be spending their time trying to generate  items that are actually useful to players. If players were spending their time doing this, then the items you need would be incredibly plentiful, and that inherently makes them more attainable. I'm not sure how specifically the prices would adjust, but in theory the game would be much more accessible.

And completing all quests, achievement diaries and pking in clans and solo pvp and slayer and skilling and combat and bankstanding and clanwars, castlewars, LMS, DMM and clue-scrolls and minigames etc etc etc... did you not see the report from jagex saying that there is over 200,000 hours of content currently. If you played for 5 hours a day, every single day for 10 years, you still wouldn't be able to complete all content. If you're bored of killing the same bosses, try something new. There are endless things to do and things like PVP never get boring because there's so much variation and possibly.
---
what do you mean?

I consider human life to be above make believe item prices in a video game. Guess that's just me though.

I'd rather a games econmoney get destroyed for the sake of people being able to live than being able to aquire gold easy. But again, I guess that's just me.

And like another comment said, there's tons of other places to farm gp, so why go crash the ppl trying to stay alive at literally 1 or 2 spots in the entire game?

Alprazolam isn't an antidepressant. In addition to that, it's very difficult to die solely from taking too much. I agree that it shouldn't be prescribed as much as it currently is, but educate yourself before talking about it. Also, where does it say Xanax is even what this guy took? It seems like the name of the medication is never mentioned.

Intermittent reinforcement is a hell of a drug.

That makes the first run of the day cost more and take longer than what I do now. I agree that it is worth it to do the calquat being 1gp/xp, but as I‚Äôbe said before and I‚Äôm saying again for the 3rd time now, I just don‚Äôt want to go out of my way to do it. That‚Äôs my personal feelings on it. And it‚Äôs a 10 minute tree run. Which still means I‚Äôm getting 300k xp/hr farming so I don‚Äôt really feel like that‚Äôs wasting time. I‚Äôm not going for max efficiency. As I said previously I don‚Äôt care about ehp.

Yeah it is. Pretty sure lynx titan abused it for a long time making like 10m+ per hour.

Not really bug abuse though since it was just poor game design?

You're right.  But, there is too much emphasis with most people I've been talking to on the fastest method possible.  I am very guilty of this. To the point I'm burned out.  I kinda just want to be in a clan or get friends who want to do things like minigames, or PvM for fun rather than profit, or better yet band together as the worst pkers you've ever seen. Lol

Meh bro. Imagine amount of work hours. Ash etc are already doing miracles and have a really unique game look.

Shouldn't really be valuing defence for DPS unless it was a guaranteed reduction for damage which it isnt. Plus the Olm has magical abilities which most dragon-kin don't, so it would really fit with the lore behind it.

its 100m / 2 weeks.

its not really sketchy, theyve been around for a pretty damn long time and are really pretty well run. if you are an iron its the only real effective way to farm the port+weapons, if you are a main and are interested in both the pking and farming aspects it can be worth for them as well.

Nobody is actually farming rune daggers though. Those items just happen to drop when farming for other items or when doing slayer.
---
For those that play W345 dmm. Is wildly slayer same as seasonals? Like the amount of emblems you receive and stuff.

I shall pass

Got it around 120 kc

Dumb question but I wanna be sure, if you die in nightmare zone it's safe right?
---
I agree on your point about runelite being awfully convenient, however your example isn't quite right imo. Only "real" helper in inferno are the highlighted squares, and that feature came out after the inferno. People just did it with runes from rune pouches or empty vials, which is still a bit harder than just highlighting but nothing awfully hard. All you had to remember is the 4th square from the edge, and then just let yourself to be dragged to the middle safespot. I'm sure highlighting other squares have never been a deciding factor on someones cape. 
---
The minmaxing of your potion durations doesn't even matter, since a difference of a few range lvls isn't going to make or break your attempt, and runelite definitely doesn't tell you what to pray. And to add to all points: you're not fed anything other than the pot timers, which I find irrelevant. The highlighted tiles you have to mark yourself, and you're definitely not shown what to pray.
---
Why would you even keep a tome for UIM lol

Technically the Fountain of Rune already gives more gold per alch as it negates Rune cost.

Some people would say that all liberals are npcs

Tldw?

I don‚Äôt se how anyone can call it a bug when it originally took gloves 1, then was updated to need gloves 3, and then removed from the game. A bug isn‚Äôt getting balance updates over the years. It was just an unbalanced feature that was eventually balanced by removing it. 
---
I like most of the ideas, would love to see the wilderness get a decent update. The ones that stand out the most to me are the skilling related ones, as it is currently there is barely any reason at all for skillers to enter the wild, outside of the Abyss and the agility course (which only ever gets used for a few levels). Something high risk high reward like what was done with the altar would be pretty dope. Increased xp for smithing in a dangerous area and things like that!
---
Also Corrupted Mole to kill the Wilderness only HCIM out there.

Talking about clients, I use runelite and I super enjoy it. But is there any chance of osrs hd coming? I started playing runescape late 2008, and it was my favourite period of the game.

Apple takes a pretty big cut of things purchased through their apps. Jagex doesn‚Äôt want to share that money with them unless they charge more for people buying on iTunes. Lots of subscription services don‚Äôt let you actually purchase them through the iTunes store. One that immediately comes to mind is audible. Amazon makes you go to their website on iphones so apple doesn‚Äôt take a cut for doing nothing

you can zoom out on vanilla tho
---
Orange, 3 doses, it's a random boost so may take you a while to get that specific boost
---
3 doses and just look up spicy stew on the wiki to find which color. Off the top of my head I believe it‚Äôs orange. Maybe brown tho
---
Its about mobile games though. Many mobile RPGs allow this, in scenarios where you need to "farm" for certain runes / monster upgrades / levels / etc.
---
Summoners War is a good example, where you can build a stable / safe team, start a dungeon, and will only need to collect your reward + replay after 3-4 minutes.
---
That is, until you reach a decent amount of good, strong monsters with good runes - then its back to semi-active gameplay, because you can clear the highest level dungeons in 30 seconds again :p
---
Good God that first one looks terrible.
---
Over a third of people hit the rate without getting pet, it's not that rare. Also, the boss is fairly quick to kill with 30 kills/hr ehb rate iirc. Of course it sucks, but you're really not that unlucky, you're just roughly as "unlucky" as the person drawing the shortest straw out of 3 people.
---
How do you paste it in the tag?
---
I guess I just don't see the reason to remove them then. Is the argument that only BIS capes can be max caped? Do we get rid of them and cycle through them with power creep for cape slot? Idk it just seems weird to me to remove a strictly cosmetic feature is all
---
&gt;if only they'd focus that energy on the rest of the game
---
&gt;&gt;Wait, do people think I meant the game as a whole?
---
Lol.
---
no harmony's other acc with 10kish ehp that got banned was "viore"

well thats what I get for only watching one video on a boss before doing it.
---
I see it as a waste of a poll question.
---
It took 18 months to originally do. If some of those models have survived over the years, they could be reused but it still would take a crazy amount of time.
---
Engine work was done in 2008 to support HD graphics, so engine work would be required. OSRS shares its engine team with RS3 and they are flat our working on RS3 mobile still.
---
It would have to be a toggle, since a decent portion prefers the current graphics instead but a toggle means 2 models would need to be made from every bit of content going forward, doubling artists time.
---
When HD did come out originally the team was a lot bigger then what it is now.
---
And the end result isn't content, it's just a different look on the same game. I'd much prefer to use all this potential time on actual pieces of content.

As someone who has attempted, do you really think that we should expect someone to think rationally on where they should express that they are killing themselves? You are not in a healthy mind set, let alone a rational mindset, when you are attempting to kill yourself.

Might be an unpopular opinion, but I think this would be taken just as "out of place" as any other new content if dorgesh-kaan was actually a new piece of content. Uneven walls with multiple colours, complex windows, cramped spaces with tons of things inside and an unusual colour palette (for the overworld) would feel foreign, but confirmation bias is at work.
---
I do agree this looks nice and I wish zeah was closer to this scale and quality, but I just disagree that the oldschool aestethic is mostly subjective and a matter of nostalgia instead of actual art direction

now if only they would sort the clanman scape out who ruin dmm and the wild

Given his PB is just under 2 mins I doubt he's getting near 30 kills an hour, plus it's a shit boss to get to without both agility shortcuts which makes it worse 
---
r/cutenoobs
---
See you on iltasanomat
---
[Laughter] You dumb bitch!
---
yes similar issue with letting clans rule
---
you let it beep &gt;:(
---
Shit boss apart from pet, I do then when I'm bored and I swear I fucking lose money on supplies half the time. Pretty sure kbd is better money lmao

---
&gt; don't forget general stores exist
---
This is also good advice IRL.
---
would really love to see gwd 2 with guthix, zaros and maybe something else
---
My bad, correction: Or maybe he was just fucking around, having a bit of fun with his loot and doesn't take the game as seriously as your sorry 3 T-bow free ass does. 
---
Fuck
---
nice tank
---
good picture A+
---
Went through your posts, and saw you‚Äôve been begging for food on Reddit...
---
Probably should focus on yourself, before insulting people on the internet..
---
They already got it.
---
I think void range is better dps than dhide but youll take so much more damage and ahrims is much better than void mage so its not worth bringing the entire void set unless you really want low way switches. 
---
I agree those things would make the boss worse, but things should be judged from an objective and not a subjective standpoint. If you choose to do guardians with a regular whip and mithril darts and no agility for shortcuts you're free to do so, but you'll still be judged by the merits that other players are judged by (assuming these players have the same restrictions, i.e. defence lvl, ironman, so on)
---
There's no real debt tbh. He's literally doing what he's supposed to do as a nurse. Sure he's not a fully trained one but that doesnt change the fact that it's his duty to help.
---
Might be worth starting a new account 
---
if someone wants to die, it shouldn‚Äôt be someone else‚Äôs problem. i want to die and i would be super annoyed if someone ‚Äúsaved‚Äù me cause fuck off
---
But I don't want everyone to know that I'm a cheapfuck who plants willows if I ever get the pet : (
---
Wait...
---
Anything in rev caves is awesome xp p hour btw. Could be worth it and lower lvls
---
Very important info if you ask me :) good luck on the road
---
Both irl and to 99 
---
They do look a lot like the runecoins in rs3 
---
‚Äù2100 total‚Äù as well hahah
---
Just use the shield and proselyte
---
You win the internet today sir!
---
My bwana
---
Different crowds I guess haha, I definitely remember people with 'spacers' (as I thought they were called) getting made fun of for them in high school
---
No thanks. 
---
I will never understand why people want rshd so much, looks pretty goofy imo.
---
Yeahh there is
---
&gt; Is the argument that only BIS capes can be max caped?
---
&gt; Do we get rid of them and cycle through them with power creep for cape slot?
---
&gt; Idk it just seems weird to me to remove a strictly cosmetic feature is all
---
Its not a strictly cosmetic feature and was never intended as such, hence why we cant combine pink or yellow cape with max cape, it was only BiS cape at the time, but now Fire Cape isnt bis anymore or mage arena 1 capes or accumulator.
---
Big man ting we need this in the game
---
well now he has 0 and i have two.
---
thnx for playing. ez clear.
---
Bartenders HATE him OSRS
---
fuck I just did the same after reading your comment
---
"Hey look, that guys just been hit by a car and he's screaming for our help, we should do something"
---
Op:;"Haha nah he's just seeking attention"
---
If the "hacker" has your email along with your username and password, he login into the Runescape Webpage (doesn't require authenticator) and choose to disable authenticator. Then he'll login to your email, approve it, and delete that email.  
---
Make sure your Runescape email is secured (change email or password as necessary) and set up an authenticator for your email as well.
---
As much as i would like to, not likely, mainly because the amount of players that are ironmen, even though they choose to limit themselves, Jagex still has to cater to them
---
Because it literally takes a half hour to find the insurance. Quit being lazy. They could have made it 1.5m but they didn‚Äôt.
---
It doesn‚Äôt count as a death if you say ‚Äúno homo‚Äù right before
---
Amstel still better than Heinekut
---
&gt;any boss assistance plugin.
---
Are there any? I don't see anything for Vorkath but it's been a month or two since I killed Zulrah. I know there wasn't any when I killed King Black Dragon a few weeks back.
---
I play almost exclusively on my phone since I got a Note 9, the s pen is amazing for nearly everything in game
---
Yup, this is the best way for a +5 boost on contruction. Since stews are random and not so easy to obtain, using crystal saw (+3 invisible boost) and tea (+1, +2 or +3) is the most advisable way. IIRC, Wooden Shelves 3, Oak Shelves 2 and Teak Shelves 1 dishware will give +2 boost. Teak Shelves 2 give +3, while the rest give +1.
---
Dharok bombing on tinder
---
That would probably be more so that it's useless not that people can't get it tho... 3a isn't THAT expensive outside elite/master uniques 
---
I just want to tell you to keep up the good work.
---
because people without mental health problems can't imagine what it's like, everyone can imagine physical pain to some degree
---
There are definitely manual cars with speed control.
---
If someone truly wanted to die they wouldn't post about it on twitter. They would just do it without notifying anyone. This is clearly a cry for help.
---

---
The mobile app is the one big win amongst all the shit that has happened. Congrats 
---
Bruh Wildy Slayer is WAAAAY to good not to do, especially if you said you have BiS gear. Craws Bow + Cannon, makes tasks laughably quick. 
---
Hell yeahh
---
No.
---
i wanna try to kill all gwd bosses for diary can i solo them? my stats: 99str 93 atk 92def 91 range and 80 mage. thanks
---
I don't think the point is how simple the input method is, we spend hours clicking three rocks over and over without anything in hour 1 to hour 100  being different other than speed and upgrading a pickaxe just to get a few more rocks per hour (very similar to buying a factory on a cookie clicker just to get some more cookies per hour).
---
While in an RPG or an FPS every game you play different one way or another with decisions having a direct impact on gameplay which can be said for some higher lvl content/pvp for rs but for the majority of the grind it's a lot closer to a cookie clicker than the games listed imo.
---
I never understood why we don't get the xp from crafting the bonus runes
---
Just searched paizuri on YouTube. Do not recommend.
---
I cannon MM2 tunnels for 170k/h.
---
train some slayer for now imo
---
stop being mad over someones elses smarts. You just wish you did it first.
---
Did you seriously go through my reddit profile to pull an ad hominem? üòÇ
---
Lmao, Americans...
---
I haven't done it since i was like 95 cbt, I'll have to give it another shot 
---
CoX is easy enough man. The recent QoL updates drastically made the raids easier than they were before. I really don‚Äôt see how you could complain now. Vanguards is easy, ice demon is easy, vespula is the fastest and easiest room in the entire lineup if you do the redemption portal method. I get consistent sub 30min raids in We Do Raids with random players and right at 20min raids with my team consistently. Chambers is fine where it‚Äôs at.
---
Transport fever? How do I beat it?
---
Simple yet hilarious hahahaha
---
I would really like it. I have much more nostalgia from RS HD than from osrs
---
Tell me, what do you hope to gain out of this comment?
---
It's not worth it. Also it would never pass a poll.  Nobody wants osrs to slowly become rs3.
---
What do you not like about it my friend
---
How is it ... Not... Strictly cosmetic
---
black graceful when? im not recolouring it cuz im waiting reee
---
He's not wrong, blacks say nigga all the time but chimp out whenever a white person says it. They are hypocrites and probably the only race I know of that calls eachother racial slurs so frequently like its a joke
---
I own both. And the automatic is definitely more fun to drive. Manuals are unnecessary with todays technology. 
---
This is what you look like when you have 28 sharks in your inventory
---
This guy cars / trucks.
---
Eh heh heh
---
my fm and hunt are now below rc I need help
---
Ye don't raid with them. They legit don't split anybody unless you're in their inner circle of Workscape, Fox, Zura, or Squirrel. 
---
The only issue I see is that they won't have ancients,  this will make nylo and maiden a bitch. Every other room is an easy clear. 
---
Why would you ever be doing an elite or master clue without a blowpipe equipped though is my point.
---
that's possibly the most sadistic thing i've heard anyone do on runescape
---
Both of those are worth the risk.

"Jagex" ignored you because you contacted the wrong people. Its simply not their job to deal with this kind of stuff. They wouldn't know anything about it.
---
I'm not entirely sure either, but I would recommend sending an email to tipoff@Jagex.com or something. It sounds like it suits the purpose of that email. You won't get a reply there either, but at least various departments monitor it. (Perhaps /u/Mod_SteveW can elaborate on this &amp; OP's claim if possible.)
---
The real question is whether or not Jagex can actually verify this claim of yours. The evidence you're providing is not strong at all. You could have made those files yourself. 
---
Personally I have my doubts. If this is true, I would imagine that the frequency of hijacked accounts would be much, much higher.
---
The dopamine release with every xp drop is what i live for tbh.
---
Yes. 
---
Yup some skills come easier to some that others, but no ones born with a guitar in their hand. Just womb wax. Anyone can learn to play if they just stop self loathing and go pick up a guitar and just learn.  Gotta give yourself some credit. Youre a great human being.
---
hi
---
No lol granite is the best method from 45
---
Not gonna lie, that's a pretty overdramatic way of putting it. Nobody's quitting ironman because of a small chance of impossible clues. There's no necessity to even do clues in the first place. But improving these things is always hampered by people who went through the pain themselves and want other people to not enjoy it too.
---
Like, god forbid changes are made that make the game more sensible overall at the trade-off of "devalues my pain and suffering only ironman". There's nothing constructive about an impossible clue step. That's what Ironman is meant to be, isn't it? Putting in the work to obtain the things many take for granted, entirely from scratch. But can you name another part of that journey where you are told: "No can do, try again later!"? And when RNG does bless you, it's never a challenge again.
---
The suggested workaround? For a non-iron it's a trip to the GE all the same, for an Iron it's still a ton of work going through med clues for an unique, but you don't actually have to be forced to throw away a clue.
---
Way better than having it cold and easier than heating it in a pan with some water 
---
Devalues my 200 death rune only ironman
---
Damn, you got fucked. 
---
Microwave is so much easier and still really tasty. Not worry the extra effort imo
---
The song is literally about jagex being scummy.. lol
---
Lmao just gotta troll you know? 
---
Use the 7 day free members trial on mobile
---
Interesting. TY for warning.
---
Not everyone likes it cold. I think its pretty shit cold .

Is this like, legit beatboxing tablature?

He doenst wanna get to know my arm :(
---
Indeed Jagex, just ruin the Wilderness by removing PvP.
---
That's because you're a normie fuckwad with no dedication. My normal only client account with level 20s in all skills would fuck you up in the wild. 
---
Careful you‚Äôll stir up the immature edge lords who think they are super cool for ‚Äúnot caring‚Äù about others üòé

Imagine the dissapoint getting trimmed climbing boots knowing they are the same rarity as rangers 
---
umm not it wasnt he was just the one to abuse it the most.
---
well, I'm almost out of food, so next is a few hours of fishing/cooking. then I was going to catch up on some quests, like finish temple knights. and ardougne. 
---
then probably train magic to 55. then back to slayer to train strength to 60
---
Idgaf if you actually do it I‚Äôm just saying that folks who used to use always harp on about ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm clean good society boi now‚Äù then just like instantly relapse lol. So don‚Äôt do that and you‚Äôd have proved me wrong 
---
I was more sad in Underground Pass when you're forced to smash a Unicorn with a boulder. That was some fucked up shit to make us do Jagex.
---
If your account is the only thing you've achieved in the last 2 years, maybe you should rethink how you spend your time.
---
I am confusion
---
Enjoy the downvote
---
Hi
---
I mean the game looks like a ps1 game right now. I still play, just saying it's a huge turn off for some people.
---
That‚Äôs what he said is it not, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like an area restricted Ironman getting a clue outside their area‚Äù I was assuming he meant you run away but lose the reward if you do so
---
Context?
---
This is absolutely fantastic, I can't thank you enough. I will PM you right now.
---

&gt;Adjunctive antipsychotic medications are often used as antidepressants and are also very very dangerous.
---
was going to say "literally when", but I looked it up and there is evidence that quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone and olanzapine may be beneficial in adjunctive treatment of major depression. You really know your shit dude. I wouldn't say that was often though. 
---
That's part of the fight
---
I did this quest yesterday and somehow got a bronze axe from the zombies on the first try :O
---
Okay Kemp q, why not make some super dry videos while you‚Äôre at it

It wasn‚Äôt even a competition honestly. We undoubtedly the best.

"Want HD? PLAY RS3." And that includes a new combat system. Learn to understand what the fk you're writing yourself idiot.
---
Correct, however doing it that way might not work out exactly as planned. Normally with expensive items like that the insta buy/sell prices vary by up to a few 100k, so you could still lose a fair amount for a one-time boost. 
---
You might wanna consider just using a magic potion instead if you're close enough, it'd be much cheaper (or you wouldn't have to wait for the heart to sell for what you bought it for)

Hello

Aubury also didn‚Äôt use alts so his task list was a lot more melee xp and less barrage tasks so the cape would have made a bigger difference for him.
---
there
---
I agree with you that HD would be a great option to have. I remember when it first came out how cool that was. It seems like a lot of the people are salty purely because it's something RS3 has (better graphics) and so that means it MUST be bad, which is a ridiculous argument. They still ended up implementing the grand exchange right?
---
Didn't know that. Was just having my morning coffee and sharing an idea. 
---
2. You can wear high prayer bonus equipment with bone crusher and stay there for a looonnnnng time while afking for 15 minutes. It is v good.
---
I get that you guys want it.  Me too.  Just isn't a question of its appearance, but of the means.
---
Wait what does it mean then??
---
Not trying to flame, but I am failing to see the correlation between d scimmy concept art and osrs hd. I personally dont mind if it happens or doesn't, I'd be lying if I said my fondest memories of scape weren't around 2010, but I love the game regardless.
---
Nah go play rs3 if you want HD
---
I saw a rumor flying around this sub that RuneLite will leak your username and password after you are inactive for x amount of time. A wild and ridiculous accusation, probably from someone who fell for a "giveaway" stream.
---
Cant even see the tentacles now... 
---
Just don't get hacked tho 4Head
---
Seems like someone just took their first high school Econ class?
---
Because certain art styles are timeless where others age EXTREMELY bad.
---
It‚Äôs really not a strange concept. The HD art style aged horribly already a year after it‚Äôs release. 
---
It‚Äôs why some ps1 games still look pretty good where others are unplayable.
---
Rose tinted glasses.

It's a 15+ year old game, man. Cut it some slack lol.

I have a feeling you're incredibly stubborn there's no way anyone could convince you to change opinions about something.
---
Smh ruined my money maker.

Even the original isn't original.

You're literally complaining just to complain. You have nothing personally wrong with the game but you want to point out what everyone else complains about? Typical fucking echo chamber

Can pineapple man be added to the lore with the Song of the Elves quest?
---
Runescape private servers are the only reason i know how to code and have any sort of career going for me right now
---
It's based on time...
---
You need to risk a tier to have the game generate one since October or November. 
---
You also cannot receive emblems opponents risk without a tier.
---
I thought "brb" meant "burp" when I first started... So everytime someone said it I'd be like lol and they'd be all ???
---
Let's be real its a dude in drag. 
---
Iirc actually implementing the textures is a significantly hard part, last time they did HD they did so with a much bigger team and it still took a very long time. OSRS team is relatively small, and light on engine workers. Besides creating textures, I'm not sure this could be done feasibly anyways
---
Give that guy a thicc walk when you get the Dragon Defender

Yes it would. There are examples of malicious checkins in larger open source projects that no one caught.

Pretty sure you got whooshed.
---
Well yes really though, with the kind of loot you are proposing, there would be bot farms up and running for these within a week. 30 mins limitation on killing the same account means fuck all when you have a bot farm of a 100+ bots farming them. Dont get me wrong, this seems like a really fun idea and cool content for PKing, but yea it would be farmed and would be broken.

It's all fine until Jagex allow updates that players specifically voted against. When the community voted no to re-ordering prayers, that should have been Jagex's cue to force all 3rd party clients to remove that feature. By not doing that, it's essentially Jagex saying "fuck you" to the community, "we don't care how you vote in the polls".
---
no thats fine
---
Sure, but it's really very minimal skill, and once you learn it, you then just proceed to grind. The learning is a very small proportion of the gameplay. 
---
Potatoooooooooooooooooooo
---
Lmao its a obby mauler pure
---
He‚Äôs using runelite which has an option to turn it on. 
---
Yeah I remember back in the day when you could actually get the stuff for low level money. Its kind of sad...
---
You have inspired me to unsub from here. Too many loot/pet drop shares. I'm here for funny memes, not sad people sharing the same exact shit over and over.
---
Both very true! But you are not obliged to pick up the key, you can pm your mates to quickly gear up in tank gear and grab the key or you can risk it yourself and run for your life.
---
But your first point also causes an interesting dynamic, where clans try to distract each other by fighting and that the person who got a key drop can quickly pick up the key and run. You really have to work together.
---
And number two is also very true, but then again, max pures can attack max mains who are holding the key and their team (presumably max main clan) can‚Äôt protect the key holder due to the pures being too low of a combat if the key is found around level 30~ wild.
---
So both of the points got a + and -. But it definitely wouldn‚Äôt decrease the people in the wilderness.
---
Melee exp still worth a lot. 
---
Since you mage so much
---
He didn't abuse that mogre

I‚Äôd purchase RuneLite if they started charging money. It‚Äôs too good and enhances my gameplay experience tenfold.

Why would pkers hate bounty hunter 
---
I'm pre-65 Slayer still, and it's absolute garbage. Go sit in a corner and cannon black demons. Go sit in a corner and kill bloodvelds. Waste points skipping iron dragons, go have a bit of fun killing trolls, then go back to shit tasks. 
---
I'm hoping it gets better once I start getting good tasks, but right now I despise it. 2 more levels to 65...
---
Nope

Since when is this even a thing 
---
Who's John C?
---
Nooo! With certain items I ment an AGS, TSOTD, DCB and pking items alike. 
---
So the system can recognize that you are an actual pker and thus the chance on a bloody key drop increases. Holding obscure highly valuable items wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
No I did not... When it came out you needed various keys, did they change this or am i just dumb?
---
I know you can only do them on task but didnt know about the key being a one time only thing.

How did you do the 1-77 grind? Currently using my main to run ess to my skillet at zmi, wondering if there‚Äôs a better way.

I did 250 wildy slayer tasks in 2k worlds with craws bow/cannon didn‚Äôt die once. Got me 10,000 points, 3.7m range xp, 1m slayer xp, and 134 emblems I actually profited off of it easily
---
so I am about at 99 range and once I get that I will be doing a bunch of slayer with melee.  I just got the fighter torso today (lol) so I am wondering what the ideal melee setup would be for slayer? I understand some monsters need different attack styles/weapons but I have 84att/90str/82def.  I am gonna get att to 90 then def to 90.  I was thinking of selling my SGS for tassets and prims? Would that be worth? I mostly do kourend when I can and can house tp - pool whenever, and also have unlimited monkfish supply.  so slayer helm - torso - tassets - prims - zerk ring (i) - fire cape - barrows gloves - whip - drag def
---
Forgot to hide special attack orb, thanks for your Account bro

---
The concept is the same, the implications however, are wildly different and acting as if they are morally equivalent is silly. Gold buying and selling websites are the sole reason botting is big in this game, without the RWT market the number of bots drops dramatically, by using those RWT services you directly support botters as the money you buy likely came from bots. 
---
I think it‚Äôs just one of those evolving memes. There‚Äôs been references about Pineapples all over the place for a few days.

At 90 you can make an ornate pool that essentially fully restores everything and at 91 makes the ornate jewelry box which then allows you to use all the general jewelry teleports anytime you are at your POH.
---
Getting 83 + crystal saw + spicy stew boosts you to 91 to make them.
---
That's just straight up not true.

Construction has a few benefits that are fantastic.  First of which is teleport portals and jewelry boxes.  When you unlock these you only ever have to buy teleport to house tabs and it will save you money in the long run.  In addition to that you unlock a restoration pool that can restore your hp/pray/run/special attack and stats. There are lots of other useful benefits as well but these are the 2 main ones. It's a very fast skill to train.
---
Someone make one for all the quest items you actually need to keep

I believe with DT bosses off the points for everything else are super low. Try with DT on and you should get 50k.

How did you get these stats and money if you have no idea what to train or how to use your money?

Long term the most money making skill is probably slayer so buy the best melee, ranged, and magic gear you can get and start doing slayer.

The HD effect with the texture overlay is pretty meh IMO, a lot of people think it's straight up worse. Dynamic lighting though would be an amazing improvement to the look of the game while keeping the OSRS feel, just like animation smoothing and render distance. Hope you guys manage to get that worked out for us someday.
---

&gt;What can I do for money at 30ish combat? I‚Äôve made ~200k by going around in PvP worlds and looting things people leave behind but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs sustainable. Should I just get some skills up? I‚Äôve been doing quests for xp so my hp is pretty low (23hp at 30combat). 
---
Thats... actually one of the really good ways to make decent money at low levels. 
---
I would just keep looting for a bit for enough for plenty of teleports/staminas and cheap gear to do just as you are, quests. Do witches house next, tons of hp xp from that
---
Sir, yes sir!
---
You have a ~60% chance of getting it by 3k, not even very unlucky yet.
---
Ouch! Made me feel really lucky about my lvl 63 Squirrel...
---
I mean Jagex is in the same boat. It's owned by a  subsidiary of a Shanghai based Mining company. There's barely any information about them on the internet, safe to assume it also has some back from the Chinese government as it is a vital state means of production(Mining). China these days likes to acquire more and more MMORPGS.  Still though I love that a 20 year old game beat out 2 recent phenomenon for this award.And yeah let's be real Fortnite&amp; Pokemon Go aren't free from their own controversies.
---
Dang, that's impressive
---
You're level 65...you can't expect the skill to be awesome when you're still low level.
---
Manual gives you control. Automatic cars with the toggle to shift on your own, makes it so you don‚Äôt have to control it yourself *AND* it will perform better than you would do without it, or if you had to shift yourself. All this in addition to offering you the choice to make the decision to shift, or let the car handle it. 
---
It‚Äôs a great analogy. You guys are doing mental gymnastics just to play contrarian lol. 
---
Why didn't you just ask the guy you took the screenshot of?
---
YES PLEASE! Bring us 2009 HD, it was so awesome!
---
Good to know, but now i have two bows in my bank. 
---
Hah I guess I can use up one and turn it into a shield.
---
I feel like most skills are at least tolerable at low levels, or they just suck all the way through. 
---
We'll see how I feel about it once I get better tasks, but currently slayer is second only to mining for my least favorite skill. It just feels like every task I get makes me go "ugh"
---
So I got my first bottomless bucket on my btwman and noticed with attas planted my herbs per run seemed very low. I checked the subreddit a few days ago and some others reported similar issues with attas plant and bottomless bucket. Does anybody know if this has been looked at or fixed?

Sure fps games are garbage on mobile devices but you can have a perfectly good mmorpg or turn based game on mobile.  
---
The fact that there isn't a game good enough to rival osrs is incredibly telling of the mobile game industry: they only care about churning out p2w and mtx-filled garbage to appease their chinese investors and milk their players out of every cent
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call fortnite a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù game. Hell, I wouldn‚Äôt call any of the shameless cash grab mobile games ‚Äúdecent‚Äù. It‚Äôs a market that showing even a fraction of an effort makes a game look god tier. Although, osrs certainly deserved the award as it shows that game‚Äôs on mobile can be really fucking good for a change.
---
No in game way, either ask or post a pic on here
---
Lol. Chill bro.
---
Yah, they have their uses. But so does everything. Generally though, you can class claws as a pk spec weapon and scythe and tent whip as pvm slash weapons, even though claws have their use as a pvm slash weapon. And whip has its use as a PvP weapon.
---
Sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you perform better in a street race with base controls. Automatic doing the heavy lifting for you will yield better results than you trying to time shifting while racing, pretty much guaranteed. 
---
Not to mention, it looks like this particular auto has the option to manually shift gears, giving you all the same control you want/have in the manual car.

The big reason we will never get this update is because it doubles the amount of art dev time for every piece of content in the future, not to mention the time it would take to redo all the content already in the game. For Oldschool, that's just not a possibility and they have said so in the past. I'd love to have HD Graphics and RS2 and HD Graphics was my favourite time in Runescape History, but it's just not very feasible 
---
And then while you're carefully watching, the seller quickly picks up some laws and teles your account to Annakarl to be killed by his friends.

Yeah.. Those posts on Reddit sure don't help saying: I got my first pet at the first agility obstacle I climbed. Or the first runes I made. Fuck those people man...  
---
And you should feel lucky! Pets are always a nice surprise, but unfortunately, I haven't been lucky enough to receive one. I'm hoping Mining will bring me better fortune.
---
This was the case when osrs started.  No one/few people could alch and there wasnt much to alch. I think right at the start 1k osrs went for 1m rs3? That held for a little while, 1:100 held for quite a while. Things like zammy pages were 15k, dragonstones were 10k when bis ammy really available was glory, etc.
---
The hoopsnakes are pretty cool i‚Äôll give u that. Not sure how they would implement it as a pet though, usually pets are for bosses or theres a 1 of per skill. Maybe they could do it similar to chompy? Idk.
---
Unrelated but I really liked the RS3 mechanic of havign the option to fight a boss again but he comes back stronger and gives better loot.  Maybe it just rewards players with best gear even more, but seeing how many phases you could get through and the decision to risk it would be pretty exciting to me. 
---
They wouldn‚Äôt want to get downvoted and look bad! Gotta make sure everyone likes you.

Dabloo dabloo dabloo dort

Artists do, and they are required for the vast majority of updates. Mat k already said on QA multiple times that hd would require around a year of no other updates  so it's never happening, I hard agree with his assessment 
---
Or just scroll past
---
It will really just continue to get better. Kurasks at 70, wyverns at 72, gargs at 75. Those alone make it a lot more bearable simply because its good money and easy access tasks that you can semi afk. 
---
Only a year?

Mobile is the exact same game. Same account, same worlds, same everything except UI

Sounds like some private server mechanic imo
---
Yeah I get that. It is more convenient and saves space to use tabs. 
---
As far as the achievement diary though. It is a hard diary, and considering the time that would be spent leveling skills for other hard diary‚Äôs, it seems pretty on par. Plus once you do have the spell unlocked is probably decent money and mage xp to make tabs.

If the goal is 200m, then total experience would be a better comparison, no?

EHP would make sense if comparing two bots that are going to get the same experience rates so each bot would take exactly 10k hours to 200m or something like that.

1 hour isn't worth the same to two different players.

Your update is wrong that isn‚Äôt a thing. You likely just didn‚Äôt realize how low your membership was and it ran out...
---
Yeah after they made it that way. Used to be 100% precise because of the information the client gave. You could have it say "45 minutes until grown" for a magic tree, then once you login it would say "magic tree dead" without being anywhere near the tree patch because of how the game worked back then.
---
But remember, open source bad. Must sue and demand takedown of open source client.
---
 üççBoatyVV *contemplates*
---
"Too much like RS3" is a perfectly reasonable argument against some updates because this is OLD SCHOOL Runescape. We play OSRS specifically because it doesn't have the certain features and elements of RS3.
---
Its just so out of the blue too, like one second hes just fighting along side you then poof, dusted.
---
That question failed the polls when the expansion was being voted on, so it's only the caskets which will be stackable. You'll still only be able to have one of each clue tier at a time.

looks like from the number of items this was all after the collection log. 9999/128 = 78 and he's very close to that number of helm + chest + legs. And is a little dry on hilts being 1/508 
---
I've found my people. If it werent for MM2 I'd probly still be sitting at 62 slayer. have got it to 71 now, just waiting for the money to pick up cuz im tired of getting these dumb black demon and fire giant tasks. For fucks sake, change the drop table on older slayer monsters. Wyrms are so easy and on a konar task at least drop keys and decent alchables all the time. end up making 500k off the task. But then I get dumb ass black demons and get barely anything cuz their drop table blows and they take a while to kill.
---
As someone who doesn‚Äôt participate in DMM I really hope all their PvP updates/dev time isn‚Äôt solely spent on the game mode, with little attention to the main game PvP.

Most pointless shite reddit post I've ever seen.

I like it too. I wasn't ever a big fan of the older heraldic items, but these look great.

thank you
---
does anyone have a comparison between this boosting method and wildy slayer? id like to knock out all the helmets sometime and wondering which one is better.
---
as someone who just recently got back into osrs, can someone explain to me what these are/where to get them? I see these posts all the time but have no idea what they are
---
Im sure 100% sure on the details but to my understanding when you paused after the 128 from fally got gassed there were still more than 128 in theGDZ zone alive. Obviously the pause got abused to take out all high levels from the smaller clans who could have also won, so if you just take the last 128 remaining after the pause that would be unfair.
---
I think you should probably manually check the remaining players and remove low level bolt raggers and put all high levels with good gear into the 1v1s. 
---
Otherwise you pretty much just hand money to the same clan that already benefited from the bug/pause again.
---
I agree they aren't hard but I just can't be bothered
---
He's right. I tried using only 33 and had to get more.
---
Swamp shanty 2
---
This would be a dream come true for me. My best years in RuneScape were during this phase of the game.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think it will ever happen though. Too many people think it needs to look as shitty as possible and would vote no.
---
Either way, the dev team is likely too small for an update of this scale these days. :c
---
You could try training Hunter until you're able to get black chinchompas. I find it pretty fun and easy to do while watching a show. 
---
bonds wouldnt be bought if people didn't buy them for gp in game 
---
I would too 
---
Tbh I doubt we even will, they just won't poll it cuz they don't want to lmao 
---
And what youre describing will likely NEVER happen unfortunately because that would take a ton of attention and time to create such new content (and they would need to fix legitimate issues in PvP if people are going to enjoy this content) and Jagex simply doesnt care that much about PvP which has been more than clearly demonstrated through their complete inaction while paying lip service that they actually do.
---
Its pretty hard to lower the skill floor without hurting the skill ceiling. All people have to do is make a baby pure if they want to get into PvP without spending a ton of money and facing some lower tier competition (although theres plenty of skilled people in that bracket), which takes a pretty short amount of time. If they arent willing to spend "hundreds of thousands of GP" (which is nothing) to learn something and get better at it then what theyre saying is they want there to be nothing at risk for them, but they want their reward of being good and thats not how things work. If people are willing to spend millions on skills, how is it different spending millions on becoming a better PvPer? Everybody whose ever PvPed has had to do that, failure is part of learning something... The reason why people arent willing to do that is because there is no new content, theres nothing enticing and if they do get into it then they get frustrated by the problems and things that are broken in PvP that have received 0 attention.
---
Oh that sucks :-/
---
I guess it's because the new one is on an independent site so it's not part of the Wikia/FANDOM whitelist. RIP.
---
Lol life must be rough for you, sorry bud. Maybe next time you‚Äôll have better RNG
---
It's basically the kids who started in that era are the ones who are really pushing for it.
---
Graphics aren't content.
---
I'd rather 1-2 years of content, than having every artist tied up for that long just giving the game a facelift which essentially adds nothing.
---
Not a very good alt if you're losing gp just firing bolts straight onto the floor, chief

Stop fucking whining you shill. You're not even keeping up with the updates or plans. You just want internet points for complaining.

bones to peaches being unlocked is actually very useful in places where you are going to bring alchs and want to extend your trip (assuming the monster drops bones). You can get alchs and BtP in 1 inv spot with a rune pouch containing nats, fires, and mud runes (or some other combinatin to get fire/water/earth).
---
Yes.
---
Yeah I have 2 of the minigame points I need for that spell. Had to stop for a bit, and now I don't wanna go back. Its the last thing I need for hards tho :( and lumby elite is the only elite I have a shot at completing without grinding out a bunch of skills.

Does the rouge's outfit affect the money you get from blackjacking?

Does the type of blackjack matter (oak, willow, maple) for your chance to knockout the enemy?

Seaweed is the last part of my farm run. My farm runs usually take 10-15 minutes with birdhouses and everything included. When I get to seaweed I like to afk and take care of other IRL stuff, so the diving equipment just lets me afk as I multitask. Plus if you're low on spores and can't be bothered killing lobstrocities just waiting for the spawns is beneficial while multitasking.

It's not actually near enough points for a master wand. Its *almost* enough to upgrade from the previous tier wand to master. 
---
Thank Yahweh you're here to defend all these poor marginalized groups!

To be fair no game can really cater to someone who plays for 30 minutes every now and then

This is so accurate.

Currently Jagex has much worse track record than Runelite when it comes to hacking/stealing, but if you are so paranoid there is OSBuddy which is owned by former and current Jagex employees
---
Doesn‚Äôt fit the OSRS art style whatsoever but I‚Äôll never use the content so I don‚Äôt really care 
---
Fishing pet, woodcut pet all the fkin pets bro
---
So they should release less content/updates into the game and focus on the quality of the existing material. That way artists will have less work and can model content twice. This can't be that hard, most private servers have 2-5 different game graphic options

I just pushed through the suffering to 99. Was at something ridiculous like 50 hunter with my next lowest being 87 firemaking.

Haha I'm just doing it to get a reaction out of people. I'm not actually a piece of shit I'm just pretending haha /s
---
maybe. or maybe they were just actual assholes? 
---
Roaming revenants and it being in the wilds were my favorite memories of rs
---
It's not that bad and it's a goal to look forward to. Go do it.
---
4 hours of this is nothing compared to combined time of training agility, runecrafting, mining and hunter.
---
No?
---
Bro it‚Äôs a fucking joke not a dick get it outta your ass. 
---
You are the brave hero we need to turn this community around!! xD!!!! please fk off
---
Yeah. They kept them since randomly removing content is just stupid and a waste of the time the developers put in. 
---
I was just thinking about how I'd like to use this at wyrms. why the hell would they restrict the type of bones you can use?
---
That isn't fair to compare osrs to this fine regiment.
---
We are far worse and only taint their kind nature.
---
More or less they were bantering and you thought it was mean 
---
well it's going up and it kept the graphics. I think it was because of the content not better graphics. 
---
I see, thank you.
---
They should have the same prize pool for the re-run though. They said they're still determining the prize pool, and if it isn't basically the same as the original prize it's still a big slap in the face to everyone who got screwed.
---
Surprising amount of skill displayed here. Interesting fluff vid. Best of luck in your endeavors, friend.
---
Well thats all i needed to laugh at today. I'm done thank you!
---
They should make the mimics godly hard so that it recommends multiple people to do it on chance spawn. Something like a spawnable world boss. Increased droprate when killed for new treasure trail items? Scales with type of scroll? Like only the master scroll needs team mates to do it, the others can be soloed. Would be a cool spike in difficulty in an unexpected location.
---
But you need the spell to have b2p and high alcs in one inv slot.
---
Why not?
---
Oh and also Santa isn‚Äôt real while we‚Äôre at it.
---
Respect for doing a re-run og the 1v1 stage and acknowledge that DMM in its current format has outplayed its role.
---
Now that DMM will be put on hiatus, are you planning to do other gamemodes/community events in the mean time? Castle Wars tournament? Wilderness Wars (open for regular players)? King of the Skill 2? PvP/clanning event? LMS event (if you ever update that minigame)?
---
No it can‚Äôt but it gets hot enough to make steel like cooked spaghetti
---
Champion's challenge too
---
Yeah exactly. You really have to reassess what is worth getting. Can you store it in POH? Is it easily acquirable after it's unlocked? Do you lose it on death? Do it's charges reset if you drop? It's cool stuff. Really makes you assess value of things as well as stick with grinds longer to make inv space lol.
---
Was hoping they'd mess it up again and just give me some membership since there was no way I was gonna win personally, but I had a bunch of clan members (LIT btw) who logged in and got piled instantly due to the pause giving a significant advantage to those already on the game who were organised. 
---

---
Thought that might be the case, hope whatever you do turns out well
---
they were literally following the guy around calling him shit. it's not banter if it's one sided, it's just being a cunt.
---
1.	Is the agility skill the only way to get my sprint points back quicker?
---
A: From skills yes. You can also use energy pot (X amount of %run back) or stamina (X amount + regen for I think 2 minutes)
---
2.	Is the grand exchange only through the server that you are currently on? Ex. If I‚Äôm on 301 will I only be able to sale items to other on the same server or is it game wide?
---
A: Grand exchange sell to every world to the current price matching offert. As exemple, if you put an offert to a sell a bronze dagger to 30 gp. Lower offert will be sold before you. So people selling at 1 gp first, then 2 gp, etc. 
---
Keep in mind Ge have a limit item you can sell/buy / X amount of hour.
---
3.	Can you do everything on mobile that you can on pc? Are there short cuts on mobile that make life easier?
---
A: Depend on your preference. For my personal experience, playing on pc is way more enjoyable on active task like quest when I have to move a lot screen. 
---
4.	How many people can be on one server at a time?
---
A: 2000 (will show ‚Äúfull‚Äù on the world)
---
5.	Are all servers the same? I know there are member and none member. But is that the only difference?
---
A: Pvp world (red) are dangerous outside of bank. Deadmanmode and blue star world (don‚Äôt remember the name) are completely different servers. For all ‚Äúnormal‚Äù osrs servers, only difference is specified activity. It will be easier to do some specific minigame if you need multiple players. 
---
6.	To start progressing at the beginning of this game should I stick to questing or building my skills?
---
A: Questing usually make the player discover new places, way to train, monster, upgrade. Set your goal toward quest requirement. I suggest focusing on monkey madness 1 then barrow gloves quest (full recipe for disaster quest). 
---
7.	Is it possible to play free forever if you can just keep getting bonds? If so what are methods that you find helpful. 
---
A: Playing casual through bond is hard to sustain for new player and might make you burn out. Yes it is possible with more ‚Äúendgame‚Äù money maker method.
---
8.	What skills are best to prioritize first?
---
A: One of the most liked skills in community is slayer. You can make bank and you‚Äôll get stronger combat which help in most of the game content. 
---
9.	How big is this game? 
---
A: Pretty big. You can play 10+hours/day and have something to do for more than 1 year only for the skill aspect of the game.
---
10.	What is the end game like? What should I expect? Is it just grinding (which I don‚Äôt have a problem with) or are there dungeons or raids like other games? 
---
A: End game look like best in slot (BiS) gear. Most people in this part of the game set personal goal like pet hunt (boss rare drop or some skill), personal best time in a boss, minigame, get post 99 (maximum level in a skill) xp, etc. Yes osrs have raid with same boss but different pattern of the dungeon. One of the hardest boss to kill is zuk from the inferno which is often set as goal for a PVM player. 
---
11.	Do you craft everything in the game or are there some items you can only get from certain events?
---
A: All useful items can be obtain by yourself through quest, skills, boss. You can obtain some items (mostly cosmetic) from event.
---
12.	Is there a meta for this game? Like is magic better at PvP Or is melee the best option? Or does it depend on your build? Same goes for pve is there a meta there or is it the same?
---
A: Depend on your goal. If you want to be a player killer, look into pure, zerker, voider type of build. If you want to go in the endgame PVM/boss type, look to get a main. There is many type of account but I think it‚Äôs easier to learn the game with a main and build a second account on the side for your specific need.
---
13.	(This question can be answered different by everyone) Was there ever anything you found out about the game that you wish you knew when you first started? 
---
A: No because finding and developing my technique for leveling, make money, etc was the best time I had in the game. Grinding efficiently 24/7 isnt the way I prefer or suggest you to play.
---
14.	What is the difference between rs3 and osrs. I want to play osrs but is there any benefits to playing rs3? 
---
A: Osrs is the backup from 2007 runescape game. It was developed from the backup since Rs3 was not like by most of the veteran player. 
---
15.	What has kept so many people playing for all of these years? Is there new content often? 
---
A: We do have weekly update to the game. Recently a new boss + area was added to the game.
---
16.	Is getting hacked as big of an issue as Jagex keeps telling me in game? 
---
A: It is. Many scammers in the game but external also a thing to be aware. Don‚Äôt click on double xp/money/drop party link they are all scams. If you get hacked, good luck with jagex customer service. 
---
17.	Did you notice I skipped 16? ;) (sorry had to throw something silly in for those that are reading all the way through this üòÇ)
---
A: No because I copied the post on word to answer before posting.
---
18.	How do I go about becoming the best runescape player?
---
A: Total skill xp you can‚Äôt, some1 is maxed all skill xp. Bossing, you can‚Äôt. A player called ‚ÄúWoox‚Äù is a god. Sorry about that.
---
19.	What can I do to fight against hackers sense they are such a big issue. 
---
A: Do not give any info, click any links or trade money to a random person for a thing like doubling. You can use the report button option to ban them.
---
20.	Are there some skills that are useless? 
---
A: Firemaking isn‚Äôt really useful. 
---
21.	What is the best way to make gold in this game? 
---
A: early game I suggest to try windertold (you need a firemaking level). Endgame: barbarian assault leech (8-11m gp/h) or the 2 type of raid.
---
1.	Last one, what is the reason you have been playing all of these years. What makes you come back day after day? I don‚Äôt what to get burnt out and want to love this game!
---
A: It‚Äôs hard to say, I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about the game. Once you‚Äôre into osrs, you can‚Äôt stop.
---
Saw the red button and thought it was an mw2 meme
---
One of the announcers on stream of DMM said something about this. There was a dude in DMM who hated himself enough to grind out full infinity. Said something to the effect of how hes not even willing to grind out B2P on his iron.
---
Pray to god the dude in infinity made it to 1v1s and didnt die to the glitch. fuck that grind.
---
Was hoping they'd mess it up again and just give me some membership since there was no way I was gonna win personally, but I had a bunch of clan members (LIT btw) who logged in and got piled instantly due to the pause giving a significant advantage to those already on the game who were organised.
---
Here's [the key](https://twitter.com/VosOSRS/status/1112115916094013441) of LIT co-leader with all the gear he would've brought into the 1v1s:
---
So you didn‚Äôt include that part, dumbass that changes everything.
---
&gt;Just make it so others can't pick up the items.
---
Yes, 'cause that'll stop griefers. And the bulk of gear is good at lower proce than before. No more RIDICULOUS grinding for one mere item. Best gear is still hard/expensive to get. 
---
Sorry you got lousy answers. 
---
&gt;The following activities are deemed safe:

1.  No. Stamina pots will decrease how much energy you use by 70% and restore 20 energy per dose and super energy pots will restore 20 energy per dose. Full Graceful will restore energy 30% faster. You do need to do Agility for graceful though.
---
2. I don't think so.
---
3. Mobile is the exact same game just with different UI
---
4. 2000
---
5. Yes. There are some differences (Blast furnace, Bounty Hunter, Pvp worlds are a bit different)
---
6. Questing will build your skills
---
7. Yes but it can be a pain in the ass at early levels. Later game bonds are very easy to earn
---
8. Combat, Agility, prayer, construction, and slayer imo are the most important. Every skill is important though. You need all of them for quests and achievement diaries. 
---
9. Pretty massive. I don't think anyone has 'beaten' it yet. 
---
10. Bossing, pet hunting, raids (Chambers of Xeric and Theater of Blood), a lot of grinding
---
11. You honestly don't craft a whole lot. Most items are gotten from monster drops. Some are locked behind minigames (Void from Pest control), some quests or other stuff.
---
12. Depends on builds and what you're doing. 
---
13. Honestly, I started playing like 14 years ago. I don't remember how dumb I was back then.
---
14. They're different games. RS3 is newer with 'better' graphics and a more generic MMO combat style. Imo it feels like a budget WoW. Also has a shit ton of MTX
---
15. There are weekly updates. Usually 2 or 3 big updates every year.
---
16. Not really. Use 2FA and a bank pin and don't click weird links. You'll be fine.
---
18. Watch Woox. Practice, grind, watch guides.
---
19. See  16
---
20. Some are more useful than others but all are needed. Firemaking is definitely the most useless though.
---
21. Raids, bosses, slayer. Take a look at the [wiki money making page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide). 
---
22. Player vs monster
---
PvPers are pretty sick of the food chaincontent that doesn't actually do much to benefit PvP. PvP to many players is engaging in 1v1 fights, outbidding, switching, and being rewarded for kills/winning. Hunting PvMers and being hunter by clans only appeals to a small demographic of Pkers and they already have plenty of that content to go around (Wilderness Bosses, Revs).
---
We need more content that encourages actual PvP. A good way would be to make Pking not complete shit money (like BH is). A more modern PvP system with better rewards if a good step. BH rework was supposed to be this I guess...
---
Now you have to wait till tears of guthix resets :/

I mean i know youre memeing but thats not how it works.

---
600 raids KC, no pet.

1200 zulrah KC, no pet. 
---
18m hunter xp at black chins.........  no pet. 
---
I have 0 pets. 
---
ICYMI there is a tag that actually says humour, obviously I've touched a nerve with some people on the circle jerk that is the osrs reddit. I do think it's a waste of time but if it gets polled and passes then obviously the community want it. I honestly very much doubt it would bring back enough players for it to be worth the time and resources they would have to invest in it.
---
This sounds interesting. I‚Äôll give it a watch later. :)
---
True same
---
yh i guess so, my mistake
---
'antisemitic memes' = content
---
This is why no one respects our base.
---
So what you're saying is nothing changed. You transported people into 1v1 area with more than 300 people still alive, yet you're only inviting back 256. There's no way on earth that only 256 people should be getting invited.
---
Just another half-measure... 
---
What? Randomly removing? I literally told you why it isnt random. 
---
Changing the game to be a more sensible game is the only thing that isnt a waste of the developers time, lol.
---
pay the toll..
---
You mean Robin hood boots?
---
i remember this was my favorite thing pre eoc then when i restarted last year i was so sad cuz i thought they removed it. whyd they move it?
---
This would effectively make early UIM impossible 
---
People spent time and money DDOSing so they could pick up billions of gp worth of items each hour. There was a huge financial motivation to do so. With this change, there‚Äôs not. 
---
Why would you remove something that's already in the game and that doesn't affect anything negatively?
---
RS3 doesnt have better graphics. They're different.
---
And in my opinion they are really ugly.
---
wouldn't it interfere with the device
---
My friend came into my room this morning and said hey eat this. And it was this. Wtf
---
\*insert unfunny, overused comment about your account being mine\*
---
You are telling me QoL features and some OP plugins are bigger ezscape then everything in rs3 you are out of your mind
---
People who want to do a lot of runs in one trip and don't use many supplies per run?
---
Also why are you so upset, chillll
---
If you are changing when you hear sounds then you would be dying from range hits not mage. Mage you can pray when you hear the sound, range by that time it's too late
---
Hydely-ho, pineapplerino
---
Uipanda had full ancestral, justiciar, Ely, infernal cape, and lots more. He got pkd though and lost most of it lol
---
So basically a normal HCIM?
---
I stopped around EOC, but enjoyed a lot of play time during HD. For me it was the period where the outlook of RuneScape was looking up‚Ä¶ until EOC. 
---
I believe there were at least ~150 still alive at gdz after the fally tele 
---
Curious to see how you will handle this, perhaps invite the highest 128 by combat levels? Reinvite the 128 that had already made it in the first run? Or redo multi portion? 
---
Hope things go smoothly this time thanks for the update
---
Rune crossbow is like half as much as dps as arclight
---
I see that your quest menu is set to achievement diary, lol thx for the account scrub!
---
Attas only makes no guarantees as to the yields. So I don't see how you could conclusively prove anything based just on attas seeds. But I can't say for sure whether or not the bottomless bucket vs regular buckets behave differently. I am working on getting ahold of a video proof of a 5 harvest with ultra compost and offered a bounty for it if anyone else can prove 
---
This actually happened to me yesterday with secateurs at the farming guild with hard Kebos diary too, but I thought I was just unlucky. I don't record so I have no proof.
---
Nani?!
---
In reply to this point, I know suiciding on an UIM is basically meta.
---
However, I don‚Äôt think Jagex ever intended it to be this way, and so rather than making it impossible it would likely just make it harder.
---
Personally, I want the old death timers. I miss RS of old. I miss the fear factor. I miss being able to pick up peoples stuff.
---
However, because of a few autistic neckbeards who go to lengths such as DDossing, I don‚Äôt know how this could return..
---
who the fuck are you calling homo
---
Oh yeah, sorry, you are right. 
---
it sure is funny seeing the same 5 comments every post dude
---
btw RC is slow \*crab\*
---
My brother got the pet on his 93rd kill lol
---
It would have to be random probably, but I think this would be great for the finals. I also think players always find a way to game the system though so they'd have to really think every angle through
---
Not even to be honest, most skills (especially slow skills like agility and mining) you only need in the 80s
---
Turn on a metronome going at 100/minute, and practice with that.
---
I've never used sound, it's not as accurate as just looking at him. I change prayers the second I see what his feet are doing, and if you see the projectile appear and you havent changed prayers, it's too late. If you think you're doing everything right, try going on a world with less ping (on a world that corresponds to your location)
---
its a lot slower. with pipe youll get around 2 min kills, with rapier its 2:30-40 ish.
---
You need mems for dmm so ez cash grab
---
nice
---
Na this is unfair. I want a bright green d scimitar cos I don‚Äôt like red, and I want it now.
---
I want it now!!

weird flex but ok
---
wouldnt be worth for him to do hydra pre - lance/dhcb just to use diamond bolts.

Pretty awesome news, but if you think about it. OSRS has had a litttttle bit of a head start on the competition.

You‚Äôre honestly better off just playing the game. It‚Äôs not like you progressed that far...
---
Congrats! Farm lvl?
---
I pretty much deleted all the other games on my phone once mobile was released...
---
Thanks Jagex :)
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll definitely send any more questions your way!
---
The guy who created Mage Training Arena also did runecrafting I bet....Activities intended to punish us.
---
But why would you all care if he is rwting or not??? Everyone makes a living how they want even if it's against game rules 
---
lmao this is the best youtube series 
---
Reported
---
That‚Äôs fair enough although an a non-gameplay note I would never stick my hand in a via koi‚Äôs sleeping creatures mouth even in a video game that‚Äôs too creepy lol
---
you use 66 scales per kill ish, so on rate for completion (1400)  thats a bit under 90k scales (or ~300 zulrahs). that's really worth. 10 hours of zulrah for 56 hours of hydra.
---
I believe you! I totally think this can be done. I just want video proof so we can show it to jagex and prove that there is a bug so they can fix it. 
---
Well they're not wrong.
---
You guys all have phones right?
---
Nice ranged.

How do i start farming on my ironman?

2 nights ago I had a dream I lost my HCIM status and then proceeded to brainstorm what restricted UIM I should make.
---
We need his weapon as our new Tier 75 or Tier 80 Longsword please.
---
That is the case with all the games. The three way split forces the dominating team to divide their resources making fights against the two other factions a bit less unified and dominating. 
---
It doesn't always work that way exactly in single instances, but if you zoomed out and looked at the whole map that's what you'd see.
---
Even if one team is too big they're not winning cause there is no capture this objective to win system in place. 
---
Even if zammy has the most numbers, a majority of the Sara and guthix players are doing good. At least better than a whole bunch of solo players vs 1 clan (rot).
---
Wasn't there an hd client out there already that got shut down? I mean like if a third party can do it...that said, I understand the hurdle is that new content would take a lot longer with better graphics.

Hmm, maybe that would be why they are stopping it a redesigning it possibly so much it might be renamed?

Tabs?
---
Tayroc, boys and girls. 
---
I don‚Äôt want deadman either, so he speaks for me too.
---
ah yeah I forget that. wish they were more afk, but they can be great money so maybe I'll give that a shot next time.
---
It's the most expensive for a reason. Arguably the most useful skill in the game. Infinite healing and essentially every teleport in the game sound good? Look into some of the stuff you can build
---
why do some people do bloods all the way to 99 instead of souls?
---
most bosses, yes a blowpipe and dhide body and max cape is enough to kill them.
---
how to delete all my crab comments
---
Damn clutch save by Jagex.
---
There's no way this thread will get anywhere near the attention as the hate threads.
---
Hey if it works, it works.
---
Not this far into mine, but I heard someone say once "It plays more like a classical RPG instead of some mass MMO then." which I thought was a good way to describe it. It becomes less about monetary value on the account and more about actual progress achievements.
---
You know how we know your confused? There arent any maples in lumbridge bro.
---
I'd say majority of pkers capes are bought
---
Why dont you?
---
What a huge loss to the community.... Lol
---
Especially if the cave skulls you as well
---
Playing the game? The screenshot on the top of this post? Are you braindead?
---
Another potential proof would be X runs with bottomless compost vs X runs with normal ultracompost? Both having attas, and comparing the average yield.
---
Make it so if you disconnect, you dont die and lose everything. Bring back the original death timer which only occurs when you die while logged in, and people dont have to worry about DDOSing. This will also solve the issue of thousands of HCIM losing their status because of dumb DCs as well. A way to prevent this from being abused is to check if a player is DCing suspiciously frequently (6-7 times in a row right when they are about to die).
---
He's right you know. 
---
No tabs did it by ear. Sorry!

I'm past 15K Kc now and have gotten 2 tanz, still hunting for a magma. My last Tanz mutagen drop was at 10,128, now i'm over 15,500 kc, so I guess over 5K Kc i'm dry of a mutagen. But Jagex hates me with a passion so don't use my bad luck as the norm, I'm sure there is coding somewhere that nulls Magma Mutagen drops on my account.

Are you referring to a sequential manual transmission?
---
99 farming and no pet :(
---
I can't wait until people stop watching and paying attention to a friend.  
---
Fill all STASHes and every container in your POH aswell.
---
its the void range thats the issue, not the mage gear.
---
which is why you dont use it at raids1, or at zulrah (unless 99 range/rigour/repotting at 111, in which case evoid beats arma by a little)
---
while void is a little better in a few rooms under ideal circumstances (mutadile, rope, olm head) that's only true if you aren't the one getting ranged by the muta, or the rope rangers. also its a minor dps difference.
---
the issue is where dhide is better, void range is really bad. So, vasa (if bp, especially if not 99 range+rigour), skelly mystics, vesp. Especially the last 2, if a raid has either of those and you are in void you are really leeching hard.
---
Legitimate clans would just get members on other teams to sabotage.
---
lolol
---
I agree that would be strong evidence but it wouldn't be straight up proof, whereas getting 5 herbs from an ultracomposted patch would. 
---
Wait I thought a friend wasn't a thing anymore. 
---
They dont have the time to change this at the moment. They did a massive survey on what they should do with death mechanics and still nothing has come of it.

The problem with your request is the change of their time paying out - very low.

As 21 once said, ‚Äúa lot‚Äù
---
A ton of good updates for osrs take ideas from rs3 and adapt them. Just because it comes from rs3 doesnt automatically mean its shit. 
---
that makes no sense
---
You can only have one cat/kitten/hellcat/overgrown cat/wily cat/etc. in your inventory/following you/in your bank at any time.
---
You look like a candy wrapper in a cool sort of way
---
Obviously pest control has the best cash payout, i just made 200k from it.
---
That‚Äôs not to mention every model new to osrs and not in the original game then requiring the artists to go back and add HD models to everything, ie all of Zeah, Inferno Area, Fossil Island, etc.
---
Dev time wasted 
---
Help this idiot has been splashing on me for 3 hours but I always hit 0???
---
This was brought up on the last clue expansion, and I remember seeing jmods mention that any caskets you currently have are only able to roll from the current clue scroll loot table, only caskets earned after the expansion will be able to roll from the new loot table.
---
At what point does it stop being "oldschool"?? This post somehow has 72% upvotes, really goes to show how shit this subreddit is.
---
well honestly RS is a whole big chore, at least the skilling part. For me, the only thing I actually enjoy in this game is PvM and PvP, skilling is complete mundane selfharm for me. However, Im currently at 2250 total and can't wait to finish maxing, I'll never skill again.
---
If the decrease to drop rate is something like a 0.005%, then even a few extra boots coming into the game would potentially offset that change for years. 
---
Another excellent solution!
---
yeah sorry my bad. However I do honestly think that going for 200ms is bad for mental health. I'm a rs nolifer aswell so it's not like I'm biased.
---
Wait what? I have one overgrown cat and one hellcat in my bank as we speak...
---
What was your weekend only one day? Rookie numbers
---
it probably varies a lot depending if you are playing during peak hours or not.
---
Using random() and using that number as the index to the list 
---
you can use math.random in java to generate a random number, then maybe use a bunch of if statements, or switch statements to display whatever goal that number corresponds to.
---
D
---
wyrms and greater demons seem to have a significantly higher drop rate for me, but i'm sure this is just some sort of suggestion bias.
---
I hope that is sarcasm.
---
For learning/practicing the fight I recommend higher def gear like barrows or arma if you have the coin. Once you get good at the avoiding special attacks switch to void. Ideally get elite, but it's only a 2.5% difference. 
---
I've watched it and clearly done more research than you. She drugged their drinks. They didn't know they were getting robbed. She was pointing out that she clearly used the premise of sex to get them into the situation, she just explained it incorrectly to save face. Even if the men are expecting sex, it can and is still considered rape to drug and fuck them till they';re knocked out and steal their shit. 
---
I‚Äôve personally had an overgrown hat and a hellcat before though, and only then did it tell me I had to get rid of something for a new kitten
---
Pretty sure it is safe. 
---
They're not really persistent games like osrs, there's not much incentive for someone to just chill deep wildy to be pked, idk what stamping feet about a playstyle that has been dead since before rs2 is going to achieve. If you want inconsistent log in and get some kills gameplay pk world's and rev caves exist.

Jokes at your expense aside, great move, fantastic solution, well done.

As someone who regularly dies to Karil, DMM is not for me. But I love the videos being made about it. I feel like a lot of people forget what a huge difference DMM made for a lot of OSRS content creators. Torvesta himself has said it practically made his channel. 
---
How does that not make sense?
---
If do half the drop rate of pet A and half the drop rate of pet B, then I have hit the drop rate for either (exclusive either) pet. That‚Äôs how statistics works. 
---
What I like about Runescape is there really is no class system, You can switch from mage to ranged to Melee on the same character and not have to restart a new character all together to access something different. I like that you can start on the lowest level of every skill, build each skill separately and maintain those skills throughout your character's history without losing anything gained from another skill. 
---
The dog is like "why are you making me pose like this?"
---
theyll probably be like 5-8m.

---
well u have to buy from a trusted seller or that happens lol
---
Try being a traveling contractor it gets rough to play sometimes. 
---
But you'd only need it once right? So at most in this hypothetical you'd need two bows? One to actually keep for clues or in a stash and one to use in combat. Not like you actually have to buy a new one every single time. I'm pretty sure there are like 800k cosmetic pants as a master clue requirement, this isn't that bad.

On top of this, people turned off by current graphics would be equally turned off by HD. Which is better is entirely subjective and seems to just be a matter of nostalgia, but I think we can all agree that neither look especially "good" by modern standards.

Perfect, thank you.

heres my qns, few days ago theres this broadcast link in game that pops up in my message telling me to join them in a Q&amp;A.

Yeah but the platform part was probably the worst designed thing I‚Äôve seen in RS, I don‚Äôt understand their mindset in making something like that.

Standard detail after 2009 was NOT the same as OSRS graphics.

I want to get an infernal cape. I'm just not sure whether it's worth it to try without a tbow.

Currently have 99 range and hp, 95 mage, 91 def. I think i have the stats, but only about 1/4 the funds for a tbow setup.
---
Wait a second, what? He didn't actually die to the 1v1s bug?
---
Iron men can get the random drop chance tier from targets so yes, but they can‚Äôt loot the one the target was carrying. Also you could do wildy slayer with pray. 
---
I mean he‚Äôs right, you are just bitching about the fact that you will lose the cape when the content is released and that you would want the cape for said content. Then you bitch about the fact that if someone starts an account after it gets released they will get a chance at the mimic chest for every single one of their elite/master clues completed while training up the account, which you didn‚Äôt get. 
---
This is going to suck for the iron men who lock their accounts in specific regions
---
The best you can. Depends on your combat level. You need 100cb and lvl 50 slayer for Duradel. 75cb for konar. 80 for Nieve.

Dude don‚Äôt hack my account please, I knew I was taking a huge risk posting this here so don‚Äôt try anything funny. My dad works at jagex he will get you banned if you try anything
---
;) 
---
It's a mistake to get too fixated on PvP because PvP doesn't represent enough of the playerbase. 
---
If Jagex is looking to make a new competitive game, they'd be wise to add in many aspects of the game including skilling and PvM. This allows them to make objectives for teams to compete over rather than just having them fight each other. 
---
There's unlimited ideas... there could be a valuable fishing spot which appears at minute 20. It cannot be fished from while in combat. These fish aren't boring items which just heal HP. They can grant you bonus damage or defences against enemy players, dramatically increased special attack regeneration, or faster attack speed for 2-3 minutes when eaten. An actual hype objective. 
---
The Giant mole tunnels around the map and can drop a spell book which teaches players Miasmic Barrage or buffs their existing spells. Or maybe it teaches a player actual necromancy and allows them to summon undead troops. Hmm, a necromancer class would be cool. 
---
So PvP alone is just too boring, there's got to be lots of new stuff in addition to PvP to really make a top-tier game.
---
Use the wilderness altar. It effectively halves the amount of bones needed. Even if you die a couple times it will still be cheaper and faster than anything else

I think this could be cool. I don't even pvp or play deadman, I just like the idea of thousands of people learning about the game through successful events every few months. Whatever structure that takes is cool with me.
---
Or I have zero experience with this game and saw posts of these programs being possibly forbidden
---
So cute...
---
Are you OK with range XP or are you a level 3 locked account? If you are OK with range XP you can easily use a cannon for wildy slayer and could get a ton of emblems. If you are a level 3 skiller, this would be much more difficult, but possible if you have a friend and do BH.

* If any player dies within a house (via the combat room or dungeon rooms), they will be teleported to outside the house but will retain all their items and have their [Hitpoints](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hitpoints) and other stats restored. This remains true for anyone who may die inside a POH to another player in a PvP world.

You have to qualify tho so what are you talking about

Yeah, me personally I played HC for about 3 weeks after it was released and my character died to a DC, I then made a UIM just to try it out see if I liked it. Turns out I did, I like the planning that goes into it and how rewarding the accomplishing the small goals I do feel. I personally don't mind the grind at all or the inconvenience of the looting bag, the game mode still isn't figured out and there are tons of different ways people are finding to train and it's fun to explore.

ah since you tell me that you needed other people to get your fire capes, I understand that you are not the one for the new content since you can't even do the old content yourself :) . dont talk about a we but your own opinion. never talk for a whole group.

Why even make excuses? How stupid do you thing an average redditor is?
---
Is it bad i wanna make a f2p account to test it? 
---
I think you're missing what I'm saying man. Obviously someone had to work on the details. The whole game wasn't reworked though all of the models were the same. The grass and shit looked a little different. Like I said it was minor. Not a complete remodel of the game for high detail lol. 
---
And yeah they didn't create the improvement hd was just the game. Low detail just took a tiny bit of that polish off. They didn't take low detail rs and add to it for high detail lol. It was the other way around.

It's also great for short tasks. I do my birdhouse runs exclusively on mobile

More RNG in an already RNG filled mode TBH.
---
Given how many low combats still play DMMT, those people taking up a "space" instead of someone who fuses with their chair for the week would make a massive difference.
---
Like if your team just happened to get 30 people who qualified but for whatever reason didn't put in the time to take it serious.
---
You could end up with some extremely unbalanced teams purely based on the RNG when accounts are assigned.
---
And if it's a player choice, what's to stop every player forcing their way into whatever team/clan looks the most likely to make it to 1v1's?
---
For example, Fools are going Guthix. So every solo player stacks Guthix.
---
The idea overall could work with some changes to the mode and how players progress to 1v1's. But as it is (multi fight to 1v1's) it won't really work in either player faction choice, or auto-assign.

The runelite plugin was only made after the room itself got updated - the locations used to randomize every minute, and were supposed to be unique per player as well (although that didn't work out to be possible at the time)

This isn't a coherent response.

Morytania hards require 70 prayer, for instance.  OP's point is that spending 4 hours grinding bones for peaches takes less time than getting 70 prayer.

Does "ggs" stand for something? Somebody ran up, said "ggs lol" and tele'd away while I was killing hellhounds. I figure he was just making fun of my funky gear or something, but I didn't know what exactly he meant.

That‚Äôs unfeasible as you need a members account every single time. And if it was just for the tourney then you wouldn‚Äôt be able to create new accounts anyway 
---
Ye they should also add randoms that give 13m exp lamps

Do you have/are you using a salve ammy (ei)? It stacks with the void bonus. I started Vorkath with regular void, tbp, salve and addy darts, all at 78 range. I only get 1 kill a trip but that's without a bgs and stuff.

To be fair, Slayer has devalued Skilling by an insane amount
---
Ah yes of course my bwanna you‚Äôre right 
---
Google sharkbrew.
---
First thing to know about PvP clans in general is that they **all** think they're the best clan and spread propaganda about how great they are and how terrible every other clan is.
---
Any recommendation you get will be inorganic, whether its from here or from browsing different clans on sharkbrew.
---
Another thing to consider is that every "real" pure clan requires you to do F2P, P2P, and clanwars fights. You didn't specify what exactly you want to do, but if revs are all you're interested in you're better off not joining any clan and finding some rev teams.
---
reminds me of the world event from RS3 back in...2013? I don't remember the year but it was kind of like that with the different teams, it was fun
---
I actually saved up all my money and stopped at 98 in a couple skills to get an untrimmed construction cape, probably the item I use more than any other in the game, very op makes it feel like a private server tbh

I like seeing a wholesome positive post about RC for once. I know it's repetitive, but it's pretty zen for me too.

Had it occurred to you that I'd not seen the other two, hopped over to the sub and hit 'CREATE POST' when I saw it posted 6 minutes ago on my YouTube homepage? I apologise for inconveniencing you though.

It should be the other way round lol. The whole point of the meme is to make the bottom section be more convoluted 
---
Crabs away boys. 
---
I mean NMZ is quicker to get to base 80‚Äôs and its afk, from there zulrah/vork until you have a good ranged level and then start grinding raids. 
---
Slayer is super boring IMO. I have like 71 slayer or something. I hate when people say it‚Äôs good money because raids is infinitely better money even compared to 99 slayer. I‚Äôve made 1.5b off 600 raids. 
---
Source: I have 28m xp in range, and 80% of that xp comes from 600 raids kc and 2500 vork kc. 
---
Did you finish all the previous steps correctly? Check your quest log
---
If you're meleeing, there is no real way to dodge the acid unless you can react and click away the moment before the acid hits the ground. If the acid does not land on the tile you're meleeing or the few tiles around it, then just woox walk + attack as usual. Otherwise, you will have to tank 1 tick of the acid damage and move left or right to find a free tile and woox walk. I assume you're using a serp helm so you won't lose ticks in using antivenoms.

Ah get over it, it's not that bad of a grind ya baby.

*chuckles* you dumb bitch
---
Smoothly transitioning between r/2007scape to /r/PrequelMemes.
---
So clans would make new accounts until they all get the same?
---
Yeah I only potion share.  My duo brings alchs. There isn't very many scenarios where I have b2p and alchs. I do still need to do it for the diary though. 
---
I like the simplicity, art style, not taking the game too seriously and I overall feeling. that's actually All in nostalgia so I can't think that away
---
Simple reason. It can't have good rewards or good xp rates. Which means that it would instantly be dead content, so not worth adding.
---
Or just make dmm like this it will take away the funneling but a clan can still lock down quests
---
I'm not saying I necessarily disagree, I'm just saying that we can show jagex indisputable proof so they can't just wave it off. There is a clear logical incongruence here that we can exploit to prove it. 
---
With me personally, I prefer the 2008/2010 graphics. They felt familiar and smooth. I wouldn't like the rs3 graphics, though.

Gravestoness were ok because they were better than the basic 2mins. But it relied on your clan mates who just would not bless it and just steal your shit.
---
Meme warfare works 
---
There is capture this objective though... You even said it, holding down an area is basically capturing an objective.
---
If one team has 1000 people and the other two 100 each, you have a significantly higher chance of being left alone by pkers if you join the biggest clan
---
I definitely would pick Guthix.
---
But it is still just as easy to funnel stuff with this setup. Either you make it 0 benefit to killing someone making pvp pointless or clans can still transfer items
---
Yes, this could also be done in theory- just do a double-run. Go through them all once at the 70 minute mark and inspect them all, then go through again at the 80 minute mark and harvest. This would also constitute proof. 
---
This is like saying an ornament kit isn't strictly cosmetic
---
Hmm sweet sweet haunted swamp to spend the night in
---
You‚Äôre right I totally missed that
---
Do the leftover fossils give other xp than pray or is that all you can trade them in for?
---
It would but the star on the skirt needs reviewing imo
---
Been at this world for 1 hour, then all of a sudden this guy arrives with his alt army and stays like this for over 30 min while I kill my 1 dragon LOL.
---
&gt;Piety
---
If you want to waste mils on prayer pots I guess?
---
I mean, if you add modern graphics and make real time action based combat, then you don't have osrs anymore. It's a generic mmo with osrs questing
---
Also, not sure why you think osrs skilling is bad. It certainly beats most mmos which just add a bar above your head and hand you an ore when you're done.

I haven't done max efficiency slayer for a while. Been playing on my iron man so I haven't done any of the new slayer metas

I guess that makes sense. compared to other rc methods zeah is chill though as you can kind of just afk it and watch Netflix. I told myself last week when I hit 77 I was just going to camp zeah til 80 then do something else but now I'm 84 rc and keep doing it whenever I just want to chill and scape.
---
Because I like the challenge sometimes but after doing like 20 tasks straight I dont have the motivation

Because content like this hasn't come around since Boaty's One man Army.

You could easily go through 4 or 5 accounts before getting the right team. Even more if you‚Äôre unlucky. Imagine that for a 200 person clan.

Hey u/settledrs if you can get teak planks you should consider the hidey hole for the hard Panic clue in the middle of the haunted woods. All the space saved helps
---
no it shouldn't
---
Are bloods faster than souls?

Why would they get rid of that? Tick manipulation is part of the game. High effort equals faster herb runs/better xp

I walked around GE saying"Is anyone generous enough to give me 5m? Just curious", and they considered it item scamming.

Whats the value then?  Saving 1 inv space on a training method most people don't use?  There are spell tabs bud, and making them is piff profit
---
Hey ive seen this before!

Ah that makes things so much easier then. It also makes me wonder why they're not putting more importance on Dharoks? I feel like it'd be invaluable in so many rooms.

Woah

This changes everything

I'm betting that HCIM status is going to go bye bye pretty quick when you roll one of those wildy tiles

An episodic series with great quality about a game everyone on this sub is interested in. Why would people here not care?

Because the good part of the skill doesn't start till u hit about level 75~

The people that stay block gargs are the people that cannon/barrage slayer. Gargolyes aren't efficient but that doesn't mean you cant do the task if you enjoy training that way

Ill save it thanks

You right, it was a saw he needed. Never mind then, carry on.

The tournament itself is PvP-only and that is the Esport. They are on stage in a 1v1 Arena and the players are not skilling or PvMing in there. 
---
Exactly what i felt like doing this piece of shit grind. Wanted to rip my eyes out.
---
Fuck you I got scammed by that :( also black satchel was a thing I also fell for. Also lost a rune platebody cause a guy told me it would duplicate if I simultaneously dropped it and pressed alt+f4. I was not a smart kid.
---
Read it as /rlcastration.

I need to go to bed

When picking up a new freshly dropped clue whilst having completed steps on another clue, your current steps will resets to 0. Because he didnt complete any of the steps on the clues he had gotten before hand they didn‚Äôt reset and could do them all seperately.

It was funny at first to see about him falling across a bridge for 15 hours, but it has gotten fully retarded now.

i dont like this

Old copypasta.
---
Lmfaoo nailed it
---
I think thats true because i did faster times. Look at my other recent replies with screenshot

Looks like it. I love mine so much

the only rational explanation is that the email i used for the creation of the account had been breached. I never clicked on sketchy links. All of my other accounts are safe.

I would always kill goblins for 10gp for the gate, *then* walk to Varrock east enterence. Why was 10 year old me so stupid.

An ultimate Ironman locked to morytania. He has videos on YouTube you should check them out if you want more details

Which tasks are bursted and which are scythed?

yep! love mine as well!

Sounds fair to me. It's 1 person VS hundreds.

I just use the regular RuneLite
---
Inb4 he gets 4 clues on the floor and is able to complete it through back to back steps on the first one 
---
You scare the shit out of me. 
---
At 4.6k kc atm only going for mutagens.
---
How long did it take?
---
What is meant by blue cape era? The episodes where he had blue cape I assume, but what was special about them? They were better?
---
The blowpipe is glowing m8. I neeeeeeeed it
---
Yo if you don‚Äôt want to be a member anymore, you can message billing. From what I‚Äôve heard, They are pretty good and will give ya money back and remove members ship.
---
This is the real question here. I bet the guy asking for advice is like level 50, otherwise he'd already have haunted mine done.
---
If you get a clue after completing a step it resets your steps completed back to 0 
---
There are people with millions or billions with no authenticator/bank pin. Meanwhile this guy has a bank pin without even having a bank. 
---
It resets if you have another clue drop 
---
every time a clue drops all steps get reset
---
Trust me I know haha. I just meant this particular..scene. lol
---
Well without the pin someone could remove his UIM status.
---
Likewise, only I have the skills for a career but no career apart from general programming jobs.
---
I have never played or heard of Runescape before this year, but I still love watching swampletics
---
Inb4 next time he tries he gets 4 clues on the floor and can complete all 4 from back to back steps and gets 4 ranger boots

Netguard

Nice try mr china-man
---
I think his strategy is okay though because of the seeds and the xp he's getting. It's like a potential reward. 
---
Respect the grind, my dude
---
RS3 has this.
---
Someone from my discord said they were maxing on RS3, so I downloaded it to go to the party.
---
Can you buy a damper peddle for your glock? Not will you, but is it even a thing to stop the resonance when you want to?
---
I didn't insult anyone. You got offended and angry from nothing. That's pathetic.
---
The stage event is the Esports broadcast. I had to explain that you, and you still don't get it. You're a lost cause. 
---
I highly doubt he needs hundreds of seeds from 18K kills for Temple Trekking. He's doing it for content, which is understandable, but IMO it makes the video less interesting
---
My theory: He wants a rune crossbow from lucky implings. That's the only really significant lucky imp drop I could see that he has any hope in hell of actually getting his hands on. 
---
It's a common drop on the Elite table, but I think that still makes it rather painfully rare. But theoretically with callouts for morytania imps across all the worlds he might have a chance. 
---
what is that backpack?
---
So could he just keep all the clues he can't do and then farm for a new one to reset them?
---
This... exactly. 
---
Ok ty
---
#The Boulder is confused, why does this meme work so well here?
---
how about rune crossbow (with ruby and diamond dragon bolts)?
---
To be fair i dont have a career yet. Senior in college right now so I'm praying once i graduate i can find work. But I'm going for my masters degree which will be one more year so i havent started looking yet
---
To be fair, the time he's spending killing vampires to get the clues is time that he is also spending on perfecting his pray flick.
---
I get like 20h of shark fishing in a week just at work.
---
Sure. But it doesn't really make sense to go for it now when he has to kill them with a rune scimitar vs later when he'll have a whip and better stats. It doesn't really help him at all until he's otherwise totally prepped for ToB.
---
Game wise, Arma would be too good of a drop table compared to the other gwd bosses. Sara would literally only have hilt and Sara sword. 
---
Secure your account email and send a recovery request. You don't need a jmod for this.
---
It'd allow him to use ruby bolts (e) and diamond bolts (e) so maaaaybe?
---
Does it just use whatever rune you have less of? If this is the case, just make sure you have more mist runes in your inventory than dust runes while you are killing kraken.
---
Wait wtf are their videos of their progress? Can I watch them?
---
i use them. i feel like even in max gear/stats you still sometimes end up having to bail after 5 kills so any boost you can get is worth.
---
I loved my MM grind, most enjoyable AFK skill for me.
---
I'm so sorry
---
One day of seeds would not be enough for 18k temple treks though.
---
Thanks! You're awesome :)
---
They both want $11 for any of the good stuff 
---
Well yeah, obviously. The correct way is ,002b
---
I dont think dying at Jad is a perma-death on a hc btw
---
I would say it‚Äôs worth it. If you want you could do a couple hours of each and see how much the bastions affect your kills per hour 
---
He needed the seeds anyway so it was still worth doing even without the medium clues coming to anything. 
---
Most places in the game are within a few seconds to a minute of a teleport. It would take a long ass time for the spell to make up the time it took to get the spell, especially considering the time it takes to pick up the bones.
---
Once he completes the attempt all the clues have a non mory step as the next step so are useless. If they had a mory step he would have completed them already to try and get a casket.
---
Vorkath
---
It says preorder. Can anyone confirm if its charged immediately.
---
Honestly it would be insane to see what kind of content you could bring to rs3. But totally understand it's not a game for everyone. Plus the viewers reaction might not be favorable 
---
No, but the profit is much greater and it‚Äôs more afk
---
Yeah, that's what I mean. Ruby bolts significantly higher dps against a couple of the bosses than a kbow does because the spec can hit 100's for most of the fight.
---
How do you get to this point? Just go kill Vorkath
---
Would anyone be interested in a four clan mode of Sara, Zammy, Bandos, and Arma? Members of the specific clan would not need to get KC for their respective god wars dungeon boss. I think it would be interesting to give unique bonuses to each team. Still require a grind but with a twist. 
---
Cant use dragon daggers until after Lost City, so thats off the table. I really have no clue what this item could be
---
Oooh, California, beautiful. 
---
I'll be at the next Runefest in a Rot shirt, say it to me there :) Deadbotting wouldn't so I doubt a no-namer would too
---
The impling part is about ToB, not the clue scroll grind.
---
The MTDF of swampletics episodes
---
If he's in the states then why the hell is he shipping his posters from the UK lol
---
510 here, youll get it, i believe!

Came upon this subreddit for the crab memes, stayed for the pineapple man
---
What's he gonna use a dds for?
---
Witness protection be like
---
I think they‚Äôre only worth it if you pray mage, which you don‚Äôt with dhcb. The def doesn‚Äôt help much for mage attacks
---
No, he hasn't even said who they are afaik. Just that they exist and will be trying to keep things as within his ruleset as possible. I'm pretty sure he's trying to keep it quiet for the most part. 
---
If you‚Äôre not an Ironman sell them and move onto a good money maker
---
I just bought a poster myself. I was surprised that it accepted a US credit card. Visa ftw. Lets go Swampletics! I'm doing my part, are you? 
---
Elite clues can give you an rcb. I think that means lucky imps can as well.
---
Ruby bolts might be enough to make the difference on a couple of the higher defense bosses.
---
Honestly... my main is about 2 years old.. play alot ngl... i just enjoy doing varieties of tasks... obviously im doing zulrah and vorkath aswell but as soon as you have both pets and you have enough cash... 
---
No, its defiantly not. BUT I would have just wasted nearly 3 and a half hours if I died. This was attempt 6ish. I have around 30kc on the main, but its so much different on an ironman...
---
Unfriended :clap:
---
He can't equip a dds.
---
I feel personally targeted
---
I can‚Äôt upvote this. The con is so bad.
---
skilling discord?
---
I don't even play Runescape and yet i'm so excited every time a new Swampletics video shows up.

You could watch Mr Mammal, or join the wedoraids discord :)
