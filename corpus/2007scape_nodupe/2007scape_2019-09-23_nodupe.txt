A guy in the craft guild I just randomly saw :P

&gt;Drakan (or one of the other vampire dudes)

This dude is Count Draynor, one of the Drakan siblings.
---
Yeah the same company that killed off their entire game when about 90% of the playerbase was against eoc.
---

---
The same company that killed the entire wildy in rs2.
---
Dont underestimate on how far they go.
---
Unlike these updates some shitty client isnt going to make everyone that use the clients quit.
---
Hold on let me put my glasses on I can’t read it

---
your mom
---
I can't wait for you to simultaneously gain two levels at once
---
\&gt;I think we were definitely on the wrong side of the protests lol  
---
I mean runelite and the features it has that the base client should have are one of the single biggest factors in why player count and retention have been so high in osrs in the recent bit of time.  Letting it exist was one of the best business decisions jagex ever made, since osrs was dead in the water.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But sure, a separate client is intentionally griefing out of spite for being worse than runelite so I guess Jagex's incompetence and an ex-bot creator's shitty morals means we were all wrong /s
---
Question should be, why include stats..at all lol
---
The werewolves are also under Drakan's domain, and therefore subject to blood tithes, so I suppose it would make sense that they would do whatever they need to do to avoid that, even if it means tempting the start of another god war.
---
Selfish bastards those dog people are.
---
Right, I misread rolls as crates. My mistake.

Deleting your post isnt going to make it suddenly get upvoted
---
Didn't realize. That's a great way around getting content you know won't pass to pass I guess lol
---
You like that a guy who used to make bots is mad that a free client is better than his so he's now abusing Jagexes incompetence to make life worse for everyone?  
---
The level of derangement....
---
Edgy comment gets an edgy response.
---
[removed]
---
&gt; seriously: why show of something when others do it better? Just be fond of your own process but don't share it with the public.
---
Cool, I'm glad we're on the same page now. By your own terms, you should not be posting.
---
Big yikes if you need to be banned to consider yourself out of a "waste of time". Should be a leisure activity, not an addiction.
---
No. Mobile doesn't have a the 50fps cap tho, people want that on desktop.
---
Don't have a source but Runelite has had it for so long that they'd definitely have taken it down if they weren't allowed
---
Ring is just a random dice roll bud no need to be so salty
---
The Badgers
---
No lol. I want a crackdown on third party clients. Apparently this is the only thing that will get jagex to address them
---
Yeah sure
---
You can't use runelite now?
---
one click con/blackjack has been a thing on runelite for over a year and I've never heard of anyone getting banned for that shit
---
People pay for this kind of company?
---
Language used included "Perks" that would make it "worth your time."
---
Cant imagine any cosmetics making it worthwhile but guess we'll see.
---
Game just isn't made for twitch viewership. Lots of repetitive actions and boring gameplay TO WATCH. Game's pretty healthy; maybe not rising, but at the worst, stable.
---
Wait what,it isnt called RunEscape?!!
---
I'm sure new players who are worth having in our community don't care about getting help from others when barely starting to play.
---
Eh Matt dodged any direct question of "did they respond" with dumb legal talk like "I won't speak for them". So no, they didn't respond. They just didn't say no.
---
He likely also has more insight into what talk is going on in regards to clients as a whole. Might be going nuclear with the OP plugins while he can to rack up a bunch of subscription sales before clients as a whole get banned.
---
I reread and it says it was Drakan who did it back in the “War of 164”. Apparently it was from one of the old RuneScape novels
---
I recall that. Maybe I'm remembering incorrectly then.
---
The only rng to complain about in osrs is for duel/staking. The fact that a 85/85/85 can beat a 90/90/90 11x in a row is insane amounts of bullshit that it aint funny. 
---
Now pvm rng such as drops..pets, etc - that's how rpgs usually work my man.
---
im at 7k kc now and i just do 3 kills every trip thats just enough time for me to only consume 1 extended antifire, venom and bastion dose on each trip so i dont have to go bank when im not even halfway a dose of extended antifire.
---
banking only takes a minute so your not missing out on much.
---
For real, did not expect to see Adore when I came into the sub
---
The answer is kinda lame lol, I died for a mug mining pure ess in varrock, as I don\`t play that much with this acc I dont bothered on making another hc lol
---
fucking brapposters
---
Does it matter? Is the only reason you don't bot because you might get caught?
---
To answer your question you probably wouldn't get caught if you did it right
---
I ran into that npc for the first time yesterday and thought it was a really good set up for a demon slayer boss like kraken or cerb
---
Made that same mistake lol
---
You know java coding existed without runelite right? People been making "OP plugins" for 2 decades. They're called bots.
---
I think I’ll just switch to vanilla now and use google chrome for everything lol.
---
Cheat clients existing is the only thing that will get jagex to make a probably shitty and incomplete decision, yes.
---
Why are you cheering cheat clients existing again?
---
I enjoyed Zulrah, and I will go back cause it’s fun- but Vorkath is objectively easier. And it’s also kinda fun.
---
I think technology (and especially the Internet) has caused a loneliness epidemic for our generation and the next. As our ability to survive increases, the need to interact with others to survive decreases. I guess common threats were responsible for a lot of our social interaction... lol. Social interaction isn't just a way to survive, though. It's also a reason to (debatably the only one). So now we're left with a social culture that's running on fumes and excessive isolation that continues to increase because we don't have a good enough *excuse* to talk to each other. Because you want to. There is no reason.
---
[deleted]
---
They cant catch you though. What do you think they do, screenshot your screen and send it back to them?
---
They can only send back a super tiny amount of data. They dont record mouse movements(because mobile), they dont record your screen or any overlays you have.
---
They record clicks, and check for patterns. They do not have a anti-cheat optimised for catching cheating humans, only bots.
---
I mean, blind to the effects of what *could* happen. 
---
Not really a great argument, considering that the osb new plugins are mostly across the line of what is reasonable customization; however, jagex isnt gonna make something nearly as good as runelite if osb does get 3rd party clients banned. 
---
No win situation.
---
Because I hate all third party clients and want to see them removed :^)
---
When should I use the ham joint in Tob? Whenever I'm melee role at nylo? I'm 95 attack and 99 str currently if that matters
---
The only case I don't use it is pickpocketing, other than that I think all the uses of it are reasonable
---
\&gt;I don’t understand how people can make the argument equating these plugins  
---
A game where a sizeable fraction of the playerbase is mentally ill doesn't attract people who argue in good faith.
---
... one is a visual overlay on a screen aiding you in what to choose to do, the other is literally halving your actions if not more and making normal tasks absolutely brain-dead 
---
Scroll wheel fletching would be like 1.5 to 2m xp/hr by just flicking your scroll wheel and not moving your mouse..
---
The fact you compare these and think informative overlays is problematic is the real problem. 3PC are a good thing for the game and the vanilla client is garbage and unusable for plenty of people using any sort of modern equipment from the last 5 years.
---
Fuck. We've come full circle, then.
---
If you want to go clanning go to multi
---
Not a fan of more minigame pets. Especially from ones that don't even really have a "boss" you kill, like BA.
---
Also because PC can rot in hell.
---
Yet OSRS has 24 staff members in *total*, meaning not just devs, but customer support, QA and Analytics to name a few.
---
Shift + command + 4(dalis ekrano) Shift + command +3 (visas ekeranas)
---
But the phat was fake anyway
---
No, I would quit with out RL. Sorry, thats how most people feel.
---
My goodness, that is quite the setup.. haha. 
---
Gz on the pet!
---
No worry man, blowpipe will never be a very expensive item because its price is linked to zulra scales, and i cant see zulra scales reaching sky high prices max 250gp each, which is 5m blowpipe
---
There are baby dragons just south of the regular ones in Taverley dungeon. 
---
Or you can safespot the regular ones with range/mage.
---
On the official client my pc gets 15fps in many areas making anything from Arceuus Library to dodging boss projectiles an absolute chore. Runelite's GPU renderer is a brute force hack job and I still get unpleasant stuttering from it but the only time it drops below 30fps is with max 90 render distance with the zoom limiter turned off and zoom out as far as it'll go.
---
Seriously, they teased a desktop GPU renderer over **two years ago**, it's absolutely embarrassing that a third party client with a handful of contributors beat them to the punch.
---
Ok thanks bye
---
And once again I'll tell you, when PvMers started mindlessly, mass voting "no" to every pking poll without any other considerations, is the same time jagex decided they needed to revoke their rights to vote. Also, PvMers were mass voting no to things that did not affect them WHATSOEVER (LMS cosmetic rewards). You're the damned naive one here lmfao, you're too naive to see the blinding contempt pvmers have for anything pvp related and it's asinine.
---
i wouldnt bring it up often before but i feel its the time to speak up and be vocal because goddamnit i play rs because im disabled and need a distraction, and the og rs client is so handicapped unfriendly that it hurts
---
They need to just ban clients fuck this shit
---
While I do think Adam (RuneLite creator) does have game integrity in mind... RuneLite only seems tame because it's only competitor are legit cheat clients. Half the plugins RuneLite has now were controversial when they were first released. It's like every time someone goes wayyy overboard on a plugin, our perception of OP shifts and we become more lenient with the less op (yet still OP) plugins. It's boiling frog syndrome at its finest. Something has to happen.
---
Oh. I was so confused because for some reason, I always thought MTX was super new, updated graphics.
---
I just like to see the methods they use to get to places, or like with karamja quests the paths they take to certain areas.
---
There’s a safe spot in the slayer task only area of the Taverly dungeon that I used to use a lot when I was a low level.
---
1350
---
No dude you dont get it, if something makes something a microsecond faster its equivalent to AHK macroing.
---
Ban all people with fast internet speeds I say.
---
I don't really know why this would force much from Jagex. Bot clients are already a thing, and botting already gets you banned.
---
OSB letting you bot doesn't change that.
---
That would work man, you might kill them from cringing to death
---
They just don't have enough people that can competently modify the game engine. And I don't think they can just hire anyone off the street. The person needs a certain skill set coming in and then I'd imagine a significant amount of training while in-house. And I doubt they pay competitively for a person that will best be able to fill that position. If you are familiar with programming languages, my best analogy would be trying to find someone to support a legacy COBOL system in 2019.
---
^just my observation, may not be true
---
don't wanna get hacked
---
Yeah, everyone has their "something" &amp; I get down on OSRS lol.  There is definitely a sunk cost fallacy associated with the game for me, but it's not like I don't enjoy playing the game.   
---
Except runecrafting. :P
---
Shiny pussy
---
And the tribesman is white, cultural appropriation much?  /s
---
Thanks man,  this is Very reassuring. Some guys at the GE made pressure and i ended up buying It. Should i sell It ir Just wait to see If It slowly Go down again?
---
When the results of that poll effect pvms they have every right to vote. Do you really think pvms would vote for things making it easier for someone to pk them? The flaw is in jagex putting more and more random ass content into wildy rather than actually fixing pking. Since those polls effect pvms completely the same as pkers then yeah they have every right to say nope I dont want that. Jagex either needs to poll the community or just remove polls altogether. Having essentially fake polls where they only poll the portion of the community who will vote how they want is just their way of removing polls but keeping idiots happy because they think polls still exist. If you can't see that there is no help for you.
---
They aren't trying to get their users back. They realized they cannot take down RuneLite. So they are trying to take all 3rd party clients down. They KNOW these plugins will require jagex to make a statement.
---
Buying gold is allowed via bonds on OSRS so if you’re gonna say mtx is game integrity then Oldschool has that issue too
---
This is just competition. Demand is low for osbuddy pro
---
ok
---
Couldn't you already do that before by zooming in, setting mouse to 1 click in settings, and adjusting the camera angle? What's OSBuddy doing differently?
---
They can do better than runelite lol
---
But you can’t snack on the swift blade.
---
Why can't they just send a s&amp;d to osb and leave the rest alone..?
---
You think runelite (ofcourse osbuddy) has gone too far?
---
they could ban all the plugins that assist any skill or minigame for all i care. 
---
i just want basic qol shit like gpu rendering, or skyboxes, or render distance, or ground item values, or jewlery charge on icon, or hiscores/ge integration, or bank tagging, item stats on hover, or fairy ring codes on world map, or low hp warnings, or remapping function keys to other buttons, or quest filtering, or music filtering, or run energy time remaining
---
You know, basic things an official client should have so its not worse than the in browser version that doesnt even work on anything but ie and a obscure firefox fork. Atleast in browser its one less program window and you can quickly switch to other tabs for ge lookup/hiscores lookup/the wiki, id go back to browser before i touch the official.
---
Casuals and champs do not like alting or anything related to it.
---
yet if people have to work 8-10 hours a day nobody says it's an 'obsession', just because it's work.
---
The free market is good until it does something that affects me — every libertarian gamer on planet earth.
---
Wtf you doing in the osrs subreddit nerd
---
yeah but if u have to work a shit job for 50 hours a week it's non a disorder amirite?
---
Take a break and rebuild when u feel like playing again
---
Wait, I'm confused. Can someone please fill me in on what happened?
---
This happened to me at rune drags. I missed a pair of D limbs and by the time I noticed the message, another guy had picked them up and said “you snooze you lose.” I was fuming but serves me right for not paying attention
---
The vampire in the fishing contest quest must have made it across then as well. Is there any lore indication that he is related to the Drakan family?
---
What's the shields name? I never remember lol
---
&gt;	When equipped, the magic secateurs increase the crop yield of herbs, allotments, grape vines, and hops by 10%, as well as yielding more higher quality herbs from Herbiboars; when held in the player’s inventory, they function as normal secateurs without the crop yield bonus.
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Magic_secateurs
---
Is there any particular reason why so many jagex mods have been leaving lately?
---
I'm pretty sure they are trying everything they can to get people back to pay for their subscription.
---
So you didnt get the other guy....
---
lol i go to college and have a girlfriend. it's very easy to progress in this game if you are efficient with your time, ESPECIALLY as a main. you can get barrows gloves in a month and a fire cape even sooner. base 50's should take like 2-3 weeks. ok MAYBE two months. not everyone who has a good account is a neet. what a dumb ass subreddit lmao. on an ironman you can argue that you actually have to have some time but on a main account it is NOTHING.
---
you know there's other games out there too right? why do peoplecome here and try to talk about how this game is so slow and should have higher xp rates. just go play some other games if you can't handle the grind..? this is one of the only games left like this.
---
Odium ward :)
---
I will :)..
---
I'm at blue drags atm for slayer task world 519 :D
---
Just got there and had my brass key with me instead of my dusty
---
You did 4 chests and you’re bitching???
---
Edit: adding /s for the slow ones.
---
but if someone sees these plugins and decides to download osbuddy to use them, they'll see that they're free to use so why would they subscribe? they'll just use osbuddy for their plugins and runelite for everything else. 
---
Unless they're relying on people deciding to buy osb pro to 'support' the devs.
---
Yes, it very much still is. You’re talking about a game that literally only survived because it’s been updated, San Andreas didn’t need that, because it was never made to be updated 🤦🏻‍♂️. Apples to oranges my dude.
---
Little bit of technique there
---
Delrith, but back in his home plane where he's stronk?
---
Is it bannable to use the new osbuddy blackjacking pluggins?
---
Well exactly. That would block the ability to do so in the same extent as a ban.
---
Yea, this doesn’t seem like a huge revelation. If someone is making a version of your game that’s hugely popular, but it’s YOUR game, it only seems like you’d want to make an official version.
---
I feel you. It's hard to think in a panic.
---
Pot, the kettle called.... youre out here trying to speak for the 99% lmao
---
since the devs dont really care about the game it doesnt matter
---
Brooooo you’re just trolling rn, you’ve gotta be. Every reply you’ve had is just... bad.
---
Was MVP roughly 1 in every 5 games, most with 4-5 man teams. I've actually gone from 73-80 mine mostly at Zalc but only have a loot tab for 77+. This equates to approximately 101.88 gp/xp. I was getting about 16k mining xp/hr so this took around 30 hrs total playing time. Thus I was getting approx 1.7M gp/hr.
---
gp sink too, cost gp to make bonds tradable
---
I didn't say it did. I said it removed the necessity to use mouse keys.
---
I can achieve the same use function by just rolling my thumb on 3 buttons on the side of my mouse to right click, move to use, left click.
---
No fucking support. Runelite ruined any form of integrity that this game had left. All y'all retards who think that Runelite ever cared about game integrity to begin with are probably the same ones who voted to keep 6 hour afk even though it's technically just botting at that point. You guys started it. Now live with it. I RWTed my 4b bank I had left after I was hacked for 2b. The fuck would I care? Lmao, they tried to ban 3PC to prevent this from happening and you guys rioted about it. Now y'all wanna complain? Gimme a break.
---
Make sure you do your hardwood trees! They have the best drop rate.
---
&gt;If you came to a game called "Oldschool" Runescape that is effectively a direct port of a 2007 build of a game and expected modern amenities then I dont really know what to tell you.
---
Thats.... literally why they changed the name to "old school" from 2007scape.  Its to signify while they're going to keep the feel of the original thing, they want the freedom to commit to a more modern product that tries to take lessons from a decade of game design and programming experience.
---
This is why most of the new content added doesn't at all resemble the type of content that would be added in 2007 - hell, the main lategame thing to do is something pulled from world of warcraft/other non-runescape mmos.  The content that has been in the game since 2007 has also been updated many times over to retain its feel (even then not always, see the new elf skins) but to still operate at a better standard of qol and playability (a recent example was them being able to code ba better so that we could wear capes in it).
---
So if you're still unsure what to tell me, how about "good point, a more modern standard of quality is more or less what the dev team are doing their best to commit to following the rebranding of this game to osrs from 2007scape".  That should cover it.  If you're otherwise unsure what to tell people, feel free to ask me for advice.  I'll be your tell daddy.
---
Clap Mossy Cheeks
---
Which would be the only true solution to banning 3pc and using their own.
---
It's just as bad as the jad and zulrah plugins and people act like those are the anti-christ
---
How does this get rid of the rumor that Vault scammed everyone? People were donating to the last minute, then the project was gone and nobody was refunded anything.
---
What an absolute champion chomping down the senior trees where it all began in F2P. Gratz my dude
---
tldr
---
you were instructed not to @ me
---
forgot to mention mobile is out too. literally any normal account can max easily by people playing like an hour a day. no idea how people even have the nerve to say anything anymore lol..honestly.
---
Also Zulrah does not have a paid chest to get your items back so you just spend your supplies even if you die. Its kind of ok if you die a lot when learning.
---
Read through a good amount of the guide, holy shit UIM is so complicated compared to normal IM
---
Good work to all who contributed on the guide, seems very well thought out
---
Counting to 3 isn't exactly difficult. Nor is reacting to an animation change. I see gorillas plugin brought up so much but I just don't get it. They were never hard even an hour after launch when I was doing em.
---
It's not like a zulrah plugin that shows you where to stand based on the random rotation etc.
---
Dream is also a good song

Better way to go than a DC or glitch. F
---
Nice.
---
I'm OOTL what did Osbuddy do?
---
And?
---
I made my osrs main an ironman on a whim back when I was still mostly playing rs3.  Some friends told me I should deiron my main and make an alt for an iron, but apparently I chose the option to never let me deiron at tutorial island.  
---
I'm glad I did, as my iron is all I play now and its insanely fun.  Every achievement I make feels 10x better than if it was on a regular acc.
---
I want this in a glass box to leave on my desk
---
Oh for sure. Collection log Barrows RNG meme tho.
---
It al went down hill since the dihn nerf black dhides lvl 70 and the shield end game lvl 75 I think and people in lvl 40 gear is complaining about splashing
---
Smart edit
---
Based on? 
---
Lmao, it's more likely that people reuse passwords or get phished or install a .jpg.exe
---
Remember that part where you ignored my entire post to disagree with one part? 
---
For 2008-2009 the game was still larger than it is now, if that makes you feel better since you missed that subtext.
---
I agree it's a lengthy grind based game..but that also lends itself to small increments over length of time.
---
Someone playing an hour or two a night after work can still progress in this game. Unlike some games where you'd lose the immersion of a singleplayer game, fall behind gear-gates in expansions of WOW etc. Even online shooters and such can feel a bit meaningless in terms of skill progression if you're only getting an hour or two in each night.
---
The wilderness. Right in front of the lava maze tele spot.
---
reddit is the place where people who have no friends come to brag/share
---
Check my history, it gets worse
---
Good goals you got man, just a heads up though the averic Defender is the final upgrade you’ll want out of everything in the game as it’s by far the smallest change in margin, but you whatever man 👌🏻
---
&gt; Thats.... literally why they changed the name to "old school" from 2007scape. Its to signify while they're going to keep the feel of the original thing, they want the freedom to commit to a more modern product that tries to take lessons from a decade of game design and programming experience.
---
People asked for OSRS specifically because they didn't want a modern product. You mistake new content for things inherent to a modern game design and philosophy when that isn't really the case. You can make new content that still adheres to the distinctively oldschool design philosophy of OSRS. 
---
&gt;but to still operate at a better standard of qol and playability
---
Define "better". A great deal of the "QoL" updates added to the game have had a negative impact for me. OSRS was perfectly playable on launch. 
---
&gt;a recent example was them being able to code ba better so that we could wear capes in it
---
This is a good example of perfectly reasonable QoL that doesn't negatively affect the game in any way shape or form. It's not what I'm discussing at all.
---
&gt;So if you're still unsure what to tell me, how about "good point, a more modern standard of quality is more or less what the dev team are doing their best to commit to following the rebranding of this game to osrs from 2007scape". That should cover it. If you're otherwise unsure what to tell people, feel free to ask me for advice. I'll be your tell daddy.
---
???
---
We all are
---
Except it’s jagex’s IP and it’s very much a free market principal for them to restrict their iP
---
They're on the ground, it's free real estate.
---
As people continue alching things, more and more coins enter circulation per player. No gold sinks means that money mostly stays in the economy. Players pass coins back and forth while trading, but the number of coins continues to grow. More coins means that the perceived value of coins decreases and prices go up. High prices means that new players, those returning after a break, and those who haven't been actively participating in the economy have a harder time catching up. Eventually coins become worth so little that the economy struggles to function.
---
Gold sinks provide ways for coins to exit the game. The more the better.
---
Science doesn’t support that people have preferences in the way information is presented to them?
---
You convinced me. I'll keep playing.
---
Can't wait to see max capers who don't know how to right click.
---
Left clicking bankers isn't. Menu entry swapping isn't.
---
Shift drop is an official feature now, as is withdraw options. Are you okay?
---
No they are scammers. They always were.
---
First thing I did was fletch some logs into arrow shafts. Really tugged on my heartstrings. Everytime j do now it hits me right in the feels
---
Choosing to use the official client doesn't mean people have an unfair advantage over you. It means you are choosing to use the client with less qol features.
---
Why would you have 74pray and 45def?
---
I'd choose what I have, 60attack 1def 52pray
---
LMAO, you're fucking insane if you think I'm shilling for a 20 year old, 8-bit video game's pking scene, but believe what you want I guess. "You've got an agenda" lol'd. I don't comment because I very rarely get on reddit. Only made an account because it's necessary for the mobile reddit app, but ok Mr. Conpsiracy theorist. You just don't have a real argument, so you resort to this weird deflection lol idk why you can't admit it, but have a solid day man.
---
Throwback to the days where multilogging was bannable
---
Now they encourage multi logging left right and centre
---
Well if there are better looking cosmetics people would be less likely to buy other cosmetics lowering the demand lowering the value. It is simple economics lower demand means lower value idk how much simpler to make it for you. If you have an argument other than pkers should get whatever they want regardless of what the community as a whole thinks I am waiting to here it. I wanted warding so should I have gotten a poll that only me and a few select other people could vote in so that it would pass? That is exactly what you are saying pkers should get so if you want it one way you should want it both ways or you are just a hypothetical idiot?
---
 I couldn't care less about what updates pvp gets or doesnt get but doing stuff like that is idiotic and they would be better to remove polling rather than have polls that you are only allowed to vote in if you already agree with the outcome jagex wants. That is the point I am trying to make not that pvp should not get updates.
---
What are your stats looking like?
---
things like the client using bones on altars for you
---
That's a big "if". Botters usually gets perm.
---
No bank PIN. *Let’s get him bois.*
---
Ya so everyone would just look up the solutions up on the wiki anyways... no point in removing the plugin when it just shortens time that would be wasted looking up the solutions.
---
Can't do shit when it's their garbage security. Regardless, get the fuck over it. I was still able to afford BIS after that and made a couple grand after which you probably couldn't do due to being shit at the game.
---
Also, Runelite's a corrupt client. That's why their client will be shut down unlime OSB. Imagine thinking Jagex would ever consider making Runelite the official client.
---
Without hotkey remapping I will probs quit tbh. Like ten years of using same hotkeys not about to switch now...
---
But you don't have to left click bankers, can left click the booth Infront of them or the chest. Why would bankers be different? Or are you simply a fan of inconsistent and poor design?
---
They are official features? But they're changing 3 actions into 1?!? How can Jagex let us all cheat like this!???
---
The only area that is permanent on every world u imbecile also im talking about wilderness not minigames
---
Bbds hit pretty hard with melee, so it would work. But dhcb and tbow will be faster and better overall
---
?... Single clicking bones at the house alter instead of clicking each one and also single clicking planks
---
THE LMS COSMETICS WERE GOING TO BE UNTRADEABLES. WTF IS WRONG WITH PVMERS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE im fucking outta here
---
Revenants could sniff you out from a mile away and take your lunch money at any time, good ole days
---
you’ve been posting this for 2 years now, what is wrong with you?
---
Loved how there was actually a moment of pure silence at one point. This is quality stuff man.
---
Do you think jagex tell you to stop using a certain bot? no they tell you to not bot at all. This goes under the same rule.
---
T
---
How hard is it for you to grasp this. The situation you described will never happen because there will always be an excess of gold coming in. The only thing that dictates item prices on this game is the amount being sold vs the amount of people trying to buy it. There is no perfect scenario for item prices,  the people obtaining the items get less out of the time they spend getting them because they aren't worth a lot or it takes people who struggle to afford them longer to obtain because they are worth a lot. People should want item prices to stay at a higher value because it keeps the pvm content alive longer.
---
For Rigour as Void Ranger. Just a few cb levels higher for much better Ranged. But that's what I mean, if you do a combination of zerker AND void ranger, you'll never get a perfect build for either.
---
What do you do mostly on that account? Do you have a lot of variation?
---
OSRS would die.
---
&gt; Shift dropping, withdraw options are menu entry swaps.
---
Those are actual features in the game. We're not talking about those. Are you drunk?
---
&gt;I think I understand "slippery slope" and I'm by no means supporting truly OP plugins like these OSB ones.
---
Then help me draw the line with cheating plugins.
---
&gt;clients as a whole are the problem when they drastically improve the playing experience of a majority of players
---
Sure, and unless you draw the line as to where it becomes unfair, then you can go to the extreme and say bots skip the tedious parts of the game. The problem is when these plugins provide enough of an advantage to the point where the conveniences offered are so advantageous that the users of the clients have higher xp/hr than the people playing on the official jagex client.
---
&gt;I've presented actual cases.
---
You've presented selective, innocuous cases of information that can be gleaned honestly. The swamp tile detection, gorilla plugin, render distance increase (zmi, blood), and many others are unacceptable.
---
If people didn't get the taste of the crutch, we wouldn't be here right now. They'd be fine and still playing. Now that action has been delayed until everyone agrees that a problem has manifested, it's difficult to take people's crutch from them, because equality feels like a disadvantage.
---
I hope all peoples abusing this gets perma banned.
---
I was at rune drags once and someone got a limbs drop but was afk and died, he didn't get back before the loot appeared
---
yea i don’t know about all that.
---
DMM now is completely dead and broken so it that just the goal for this?
---
Is this actually unironic?
---
Bullshit. They have a profit sharing agreement with OSbuddy. Anyone with a brain knows it.
---
Yes but if people get one of those they are less likely to buy one so the demand is still lowered lmao like I said it is simple economics. The fact that you only failed at saying I was wrong there and ignored all the other points I made so you could reeeeeeeeee just proves you know you are backed into a corner and are completely wrong. Or do you have a rational argument instead of just the standard reeeeeee I was proved wrong and can't get everything I want?
---
Training RC was mere practice to prepare our attention spans for this series.
---
I wonder if they can solve OSRS customer support problem
---
I'm sorry in advance, but this is one of like 2 or 3 rules I just HAVE to point out to people: It's must've (must have) not must of. Again, sorry.
---
With what everybody enjoys from Runelite, that changes how *everybody* wants the game to be played. Many of these changes were made later in RS2 and RS3. The OSRS team doesn't generally bother with many of these things because it isn't worth their time, because it takes away from developing new content, and Runelite does it anyways.
---
So is runemetrics a full blown client? I thought it was just extra features you could see on their website like xp/hr and such... I quit before EOC came out so I have no clue.
---
Lesser demon would be best since Kril is kind of the greater boss
---
I've hosted a few times, but only when I've been afking myself doing pray, I'm 99 con but uses a host so I can run bones on an alt. Anytime theres no host on I always just let them use my house until a host comes on, but always refuse to take donations and dont have a jar. I would prefer people to go find genuine people who could use the gp alot more than I need it.
---
Turning multiple clicks into a single click, which allows for much easier tick manip. Easy bone usage on altar, the 1 tick method
---
Learning curve
---
These arent macros, macros tie multiple actions to a single input. What these plugins do is change the default interact option to something in the right click menu or something not normally visible but still accessible if called directly, removing the need for multiple actions entirely. Its a loophole resulting from an old insecure codebase.
---
Found the guy who didn’t read the post
---
It is, it always has been, and you’re still mentally challenged
---
Fuck yeah. You only spend like 4/5ths of your life in a shit job but that’s totally cool
---
Before runelite they actually made money and we’re a business, now they are grasping at straws and customer support goes out the window
---
Would the end of the game for me.
---
God I wish I was you. The bravery and amazing writing prose. I salute you comrade o7
---
It wasn’t and it also was a bad joke
---
For real though some kind of magical farming multitool would be cool
---
For Graardor, depending on your level and gear, I’d say 2-3 is good. I’ve gotten a good amount of kills in with 3 people.
---
I wonder how much rarer it is to have an untrimmed slayer cape vs a trimmed one
---
Do you really think an obese person can run 28 magic logs back to the bank several times a day without breaking a sweat and not to mention his full dragon armor hes sportin cause he can fit into it and it looks fab?
---
Cleaning herbs sounds perfect for you
---
But what if your character trains RC? That character is sure to get cardio in.
---
Not everyone wants to work At jagex for minimum wage
---
Is there really any benefit to doing that?
---
Due to the amount of work they've done on it, yeah. This is the sort of thing where it would be better to poll the community on what they want worked on next before starting to work on it
---
How hard is it to solo corp? I have a maxed acc but never did it
---
What do you mean by this? I found 6 jads harder than the Inferno. Triples took me 4 attempts before I succeeded but 6 jads took me 400 (Runelite took a screenshot everytime I died).
---
If you can do 6 jads you can definitely do 3, but the converse, at least in my experience, is absolutely not true.
---
i tweeted today for the first time ever at os_matt or whoever the dev is of osbuddy and modash about it today to try and stir up some awareness
---
You're probably thinking of something else. Graphics in a game can be bleeding edge. The inferno is not bleeding edge.
---
Just use a VPN
---
The whole learning visual/kinesetic thing. Everyone has the capability to learn things in all of those ways. Because the brain can process information in more than one way.
---
I have a 60 atk pure. I finish work in like 6 hours and can practice in white portal or edge pvp. I am still new to 1 def nh but im pretty decent at 75def. What server do you get good ping on?? Mine in order of best to worst are aus, usa, eu, ger.
---
The only youll get a false ban from this is if ita aroubd the duel arena. ive heard false rwt bans for lending accs for staking
---
No visafe smh
---
It's more the auto solve puzzles demonic gorilla plug in and the like.
---
On what grounds?
---
&gt;Free market principle
---
&gt;Restrict IP
---
Ok
---
Fishing infernal or sacred eels is pretty mind numbing.
---
Youll be fine g.
---
https://twitter.com/JagexSween/status/957292953197793280?s=20
---
Seems like they don't ban for it, but it technically is against the rules? Obviously, the selling of services isn't allowed. Ill keep looking, as I recall there being a different post as well.
---
No
---
Runelite does listen to jagex what are you in about lmao
---
Ahh, it seems like we're different time zones. I'm west coast US, and I'm going to bed in like 30 min to an hour haha. I'd typically be pking in the evenings probably around this time unfortunately.
---
Different people would be responsible for that
---
75 atk and def with 77 pray. Med level is best level. I can kill everyone!
---
That would be a good idea if you wouldn't mind having 0 updates for 2 years
---
Then it would not be impressive to have an untrimmed 99 slayer cape
---
Yeah, if you care about maximum efficiency that much... but that's every game with loot and stats and custom builds. There's ALWAYS an optimal setup and way to play, but nobody's FORCING you to play optimally.
---
If you want to do raids in a chef's hat and bunny slippers cuz why not, you can.  If you want to be as efficient as possible, you'll choose the best gear.
---
Welcome to video games.
---
Same man. If they fuck everyone over for more cash I’m gone. Idc if they ban the clients unless they end up doing some shady shit.
---
I'm looking forward to this and I know many people who are really looking forward to it.
---
Okay, you're just trolling at this point if you honestly still think that after the links I provided. See you later.
---
I believe account sharing is okay so long as you don’t use it for unfair advantages, ie inferno cape, exp records or leaderboard ranking.
---
Sorry for being "that guy", yes I am 😂 Been called a grammar nazi all my life and quit the habit, but still correct some things because it benefits the other party more down the line than it hurts me to do it.
---
Thanks for being a good sport about it
---
Can someone fill me in on the drama?
---
Best to keep it a mystery tho. They bring gods back in rs3 and it sucks ass.
---
Ahh I see! Enjoy Shenzhen mate. First time in China?
---
what do you mean keys? if that where the case wouldn't have jagex done somthing about the over powered runelite plugins you can add yourself?
---
Goodbye
---
I'm becoming a big fan of this meme
---
25% of the time it has a 10% better chance at not splashing
---
Or I think that could just be summarized as having a 2.5% better chance at not splashing all the time
---
If something’s on the ground and no one else picks it up, there’s a decent chance I will scoop it, especially if it’s worth 20 million.
---
60 att piety
---
I've been sitting @ XoC barb fishing for months, is chill af
---
Okay if you want a 2019 standard why do we still have shit graphics? Time for a graphic rework huh.
---
It's a meme
---
make the lore that the boss regained strength from all the demons the player killed in the chasm, yet again making it the player's fault something has gone wrong
---
Doesn't surprise me. I know the OSB Dev "Fox." He's an in-your-face gay furrie who is an absolute douchebag of a person to anyone who tells him he's being a little much.
---
Sounds exactly like something he would do.
---
Good riddance dumb helm
---
legendary name
---
So is Fremmy Exiles coming this week? Just got my quest cape a couple of weeks ago so I'm ready for this new quest so I can keep wearing it
---
Demons you either summon onto your plane or travel to theirs. The three you listed take the latter route. I think it’d be interesting if you would have to perform the former with the help of the voice of Yama, who’s banking on you failing to kill his master.
---
It isnt lol.. where did you even get that idea from haha. It would kill all the clans. 
---
Also there is a massive different between singles clans and multi clans. If you want to know i can tell you but it seems your an entitled pvp that just wants a safe space to do wildy content.
---
If your not just a troll let me know. I can explain some things. If you are then just move along.
---
clearly you have no clue about pvp because everything you just said is false ... me (i would say majority) of pkers would be fine to remove pvm and other methods jagex put in to artificially boost activity, also pkers dont whine about not getting easy kills its pvmers crying because they cant bare to lose a single gold piece as there is no risk outside of the wild. pkers do engage with pkers but that doesnt get posted about. again clearly you have no clue. and "griefing" you for your spade is pretty pathetic considering you dont know what someone has in their inventory you chose to cross that ditch
---
I mean I don't mean to be straight up but if you'd quit over a SkyBox/distance rendering I don't think you truly enjoy playing the game that much on its own.
---
I would personally recommend just power leveling your stats on monsters with no drops (sandcrabs come to mind) until you're all 70s. With your better stats, you'll be able to level up slayer and actually kill things efficiently. Then around slayer level 65-70 there starts to be creatures you can kill for decent drops and combat exp.
---
You don’t want this. Stuff will get changed and you will see MINOR updates maybe once a year as it gets put on the back burner. Then comes polling for changes, have fun with that.
---
hard pass
---
Yes it works tried it before
---
it's not actually on the rules page anymore lol
---
Iban’s Blast doesn’t technically count as a boosted spell from it, so one page/charge It will give you unlimited fire runes for Iban Blast (but it won’t make it hit harder). I use it for Iban blasting at Barrows so the only runes I have to carry are death runes.
---
What are you doing in Corp instance?
---
they get stuck in all kinds of walls
---
I think you're right, it's only disallowed for hi scores and inferno. 
---
I browsed some newer threads on account sharing and that seemed to be the consensus.
---
With me its not even the fact it's easier to understand. It's just more convenient. I play mobile only (I don't have a pc) so I can throw on a video guide and just play along side it.
---
I was expecting "this game ruined my life cause I hot addicted and played 18 hours a day, dont be like me"
---
This is much more wholesome. There truly are some amazing people in this community and I'm glad it's been a help to you
---
calm down first
---
Support
---
more like a spuvel
---
seems like you could have gotten more money
---
What happened to os buddy?
---
Im waiting for the tutorial island to max cape plugin, i have 35 jobs 72 kids and emily, I mean cancerto busy to grind
---
&gt;Okay if you want a 2019 standard why do we still have shit graphics? Time for a graphic rework huh.
---
Graphics arent exactly something that needs to be high quality- see minecraft.  Some of the best games of this year have far worse graphics than some of the worst.  Nonetheless, theres a lot of people who want to see a return to runescape HD.  I think that the current graphics are fine and respect that the devs probably cannot afford to offer a better option.  Nonetheless, we also get more modern graphics occasionally, such as with the elves.
---
On the other hand, if an unaffiliated volunteer on github can supply a qol standard that most of the community clearly wants, then the dev team could too.
---
I dunno if this was supposed to be a gotcha or just a segue, but graphics is definitely neither here nor there.
---
I kind stand these fucking idiots that say it’s unfair. Everyone can download runelite.
---
What bothers me is that there’s really people out here thinking that the clients they use on a daily bases can’t be breached or even used against them by the client owners themselves. It’s kinda like believing the Holocaust never happened.
---
that's not a source, anyone could just say that jagex said that
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting at 380ish kc with 6 crystals and no stones.
---
Booooo
---
If you're referring to *that* market then yes. Jagex is within their right to do that
---
Well. We got Prif.
---
If Jagex as a company lasts another 4 years we might get a Menaphos port.
---
I gave you logical answers and you ignore them to just post troll comment, fuck off dickhead.
---
"unfair rng" lmao
---
Do you know what rng is?
---
Maybe they can make Muttadiles a little less buggy while they are at it? That room makes high experienced raiders throw out a “wtf” more often then it should.
---
No bait, going through your history told me all I needed. Now fuck off back to lurkville scrub
---
I feel like that counts as a super budget photoshop haha
---
Account sharing is against the rules when it’s used to compete for hiscores, and they extended that policy to the inferno because of how difficult it is, they don’t want just anyone to have the prestige of the infernal cape.
---
Simply questing for someone or training their stats (not for the sake of hiscores) is not as bad, and would definitely be allowed if it’s done for free. It’s just unclear if you can pay for it
---
I was in a really bad place recently too, I got addicted to drugs to try to escape reality due to my depression. Once I started taking anti-depressants I actually reactivated my WoW account and it instantly made me want to play Runescape again, because I never really took it seriously or have gotten far in the game. I started playing Runescape more and more and now I'm absolutely in love with it, it's brought me out of this world, I've formed many friendships with my clan and random people. Thank you for being a part of the community, hopefully this game continues to make you happy.

Jesus christ
---
A 3rd party OSRS client that has tons of QoL features. It’s basically the better and more free version of OSBuddy which locks up a lot of those features by having to pay.
---
Rofl, then ask for that in the vanilla client. Support for that and then banning off all 3PC. Stretched fixed mode and a couple other things.
---
she's glitched and doesn't actually poison apparently
---
who cares?
---
This is art.
---
This is exactly the post someone who bought their account would say.
---
Stop trying to flex your account. No one cares about it.
---
Prove it
---
i have a 2k total pure, a 1900 total main, and various accounts i made to pk on. i made my iron 6 months ago and holy fuck is it way better than the pvm/pking scene. it feels like im playing as a kid again, exploring different methods to train. accomplishments feel 10x better knowing that im an iron and had to grind twice as hard
---
Noob
---
no because it's nigh impossible to tell third party clients apart, they could say all they want but there's no way to detect it.
---
plus people have already developed stupid features for runelite, they're just added in and passed around as unofficial runelite client mods. think stuff like telling you where to stand at zulrah or highlighting the prayers you need at jad or inferno.
---
Just a third party client of OSRS which has a bunch of plugins and is overall a better client than the official one being used now because it increases performance and the experience of the game.
---
Damn I didn't realise Jagex is the lead developer of OSB now?!?!
---
Dude, you don't have to try and casually insult people because they disagree with you, it just makes you sound like you're burying your head in the sand. (Also what wording was I tripping over, I literally said that people can lie on the internet....)
---
I wouldn't take Adam's word for gospel either, nor would I take anyone's word of mouth without being able to fact check, and neither should you, which should be pretty common sense really
---
It very well may not be bannable for whatever reason, (although I think they'll have a hard time justifying not banning it tbh) but I'd rather wait and hear what the statement that they're preparing on the matter says (source: Mod Ash) before letting people be told "yeah it's okay, the person who made it to try and encourage people to come back to paying for his client said so, so it must be okay". 
---
You need to bear in mind, bot scripters advertise scripts as having 0% ban rate and shit too, doesn't mean you won't get banned for using it.
---
is it not allowed now?
---
I'm waiting for the home page to max xp plug in. I don't have any obligations, I'm just lazy.
---
OSB basically enables nonexistant options before (not just swapping the menu entries), such as left click "offer bones on an altar (instead of having to click on the bone and using it on the altar) and left click building an specific furniture in construction (without the need of selecting it every action).
---
The irony in the ring of life killing you... RIP
---
The calculation is complicated because you're not working with flat numbers. A seer's ring (i) always gives +12 mage bonus, but the chance to reduce your opponent's defense scales with... your opponent's defense. If your opponent has 1 defense, then 10% is nothing. But if they have massive defenses, then that 10% reduction could be significantly greater than +6 more magic attack.
---
For end game content like raids 1 and 2, you're probably going to bring the Brimstone ring over the seer's ring due to inventory space (brimstone counts for ranging and melee accuracy \[dwh specs\]) and because your targets will have high defenses (% reduction can be stronger than flat accuracy).
---
If you're in mid-game, seers ring can be helpful if your mage is super low, but most of the enemies you want to mage will already be extremely susceptible to magic, so extra accuracy might not help.
---
It probably *was* on the way.
---
But then their lead engine dev quit.
---
Aaaaaand ***now*** here we are.
---
Thank you I'll get myself one for raids I'd call myself mid to late game anyway 😊
---
bro it woudlve been fucking hilarious if he died to goblin on purpose, sitting at 1 hp for like 15 seconds.  "god dammit that thing is tough"
---
I think people just dont care about a useless show account
---
We get it. Runelite, Pvp updates. RC bad. Can this sub move on already?
---
I think most people threatening to quit would realistically do the same thing.
---
What a great idea for a... promotion.
---
Thank you for the guide on a dying game mode.
---
A third-party client that offers a variety of useful (toggleable) features, such as rendering with your graphics card, a low detail mode for weaker computers, increasing the draw distance, adding a skybox rather than the black void, putting nametags on items on the ground, price checking items, clue scroll directions, and farming timers, and more. It's very handy, and they keep in close contact with Jagex to ensure they don't compromise the integrity of the game with any features that automate or trivialize things (such as when they were asked to remove addons that give you directions on how to avoid bosses' attacks as they occur).
---
Depending on the license, you might have to get agreement from everybody who's ever contributed code. See: Bukkit.
---
lmao, we do know. They don't have enough devs, especially engine devs to keep up the standard that loads of open source devs doing each small part of the program
---
adopting it is an entirely different concept though
---
By giving money to the owners i’d imagine
---
How? Its just a menu swap...
---
Shit axcount
---
A
---
Its your own ip addresses its going to

Great idea!
---
blackjacking normally is aids, but 1-click blackjacking = watch half an episode of your favorite show and get like 60k xp, it's completely dumb
---
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT US A GOOD OLD FASHIONED WEEABOO
---
Then it will be their responsibility. Right now runelite is giving us features that jagex should be giving, but they're doing it for free. And jagex has to do nothing about it.
---
If jagex bought it, they'd be responsible for it and have to pay runelite devs more. Obviously not in their best interests.
---
Jagex absolutely has legal rights to C&amp;D OSB if they have to
---
Why would you post someone else’s video, trying to make it your own?
---
sadly though I’ve never played RuneScape, I just lurk here and learn about the game without ever playing it haha
---
...it’s tempting, though.
---
Mouse isn’t made to work on the app version of the game.
---
it has +20 magic accuracy/def with %% magic damage with a special attack
---
No snake in here just a small statuette
---
Awesome. Thanks.
---
Great, more ways to get onyxs into the game
---
Any suggestions on gear or strats?
---
It doesn’t really make any sense from the game developer’s perspective. A lot of these plugins are quick wins to make the game easier. They’re very useful, but many of them are very ugly and primitive.  That’s perfectly fine for a mod or plugin, but not for a game development studio. 
---
For example, if Jagex wanted to implement a visible clickable area in agility courses, they wouldn’t just show an ugly colored box. They’d have to do it in a way that really fits in the game. 
---
It means they don’t need to acquire third party clients. If they wanted their features, they would have to redesign it all and just implement it.
---
I know this, but I was told it still works as if your 'tapping' there, which I'm happy with as I don't have to 2 hand on my phone and allows me to put phone away from me at an angle I can see it and move my hand to my mouse instead of across to my phone. 
---
As tapping on the screen kinda knocks phone over.
---
You’d need to gamble points in my opinion, otherwise it’ll be quite the common pet seeing as so many accounts do hours of pest control for the equipment or specific builds
---
The wilderness is unfair and it always should be that way. It means when an individual is skilled enough to beat the odds, you can feel amazing.
---
Good shout
---
Nice guide my friend. It's a shame Jagex deleted the w45 guide from their own website.
---
Wow, mommy’s card can make some really cool accounts
---
Yup, I noticed that earlier when I was researching stuff to help make this guide. I tweeted Ash about it. Smh
---
I’d go underground, from what I’ve gathered most underground clients just mirror the official of RL client so their footprint is hidden. It’s extreme, but that’s how much I hate the official client.
---
Couldn't be you who has shitty speakers or low volume.
---
Sounded fine to me.
---
Correct, its not fair use. That's my point. Thanks.
---
You’ve a volume button you nark
---
Lol saw this guy at the mining guild today
---
Its also not cabbage why not bring up cabbage while we are talking about the things that it isn't?
---
I've been off lately so can someone explain or point me to a post where all this 3rd party plugin drama is explained?
---
Grow some balls lol.
---
Considering Rendi has a level 18 combat firecape I believe it would still be possible? 
---
It would just take a really long time
---
Speak of the virgin. And it will appear.
---
&gt;and send it to some server which validates the "approval" of the plugin, and voila, if it's approved then it's safe.
---
What happens when I modify the client to always send the approved hashes, no matter what I'm actually running?
---
snipers take the shot
---
you disagree with me so you're the virgin!
---
Do chatbox notifications not count as interfaces which stall cannon activity?
---
Check out “ember of ash”. We do a little bit of everything and do tob/cox learner raids all the time.
---
You gotta stay relaxed. Do you jerk off?
---
Yes, but basically none of that is going to the team. IIRC most mods have said they don't do the job for the pay, as it is atrocious, but because they genuinely love the game. It's not a job you'd want if you just are looking for money, it's only a job suitable for people who genuinely don't care about being paid too much and just want to work on the game.
---
What is the OSB plugin? I'm a bit OOTL
---
That’s fair, but that’s more on your phone/choice of phone than it is on OPs recording is it not? My point here was you shouldn’t give off at OP (like original poster did) over something that’s out of his control
---
Lmao
---
It wasn't clear because it's completely untrue. I'm in the same CC as /u/Tigerballs07 and I'm not sure where this is coming from. Fox is honestly a really nice person, and I've never once seen anything anywhere close to what Tiger is claiming.
---
He was poor during the first charges sooooo
---
Dropping pages for a book allowing the player to read and chant incantations to summon the boss would be a decent way.
---
Honestly, you are still clicking. Just less carpal tunnel really. Not like these people leave the pc and go afk as all the logs or whatever are used.
---
But hey, I dont know, I spend more time here than on osrs at this point. These memes are too good.
---
Fox is not like that, this guy commenting “was” a friend of mine, he’s being an ass.
---
It's 0gp/hr on average, the "I use the martingale system" people are big dumbos
---
I mean you can sell the tbow
---
100m is more like 60 dollars
---
From my very little knowledge it looks like it might be runelite then used widget tool to edit the 99's as prayer doesn't match world map value
---
Honestly, I would spend days mining rune essence by hand if it meant I could stack them for fat rc exp gains
---
Fuck, I don't know then. Magic?
---
Talk about lying out of your ass
---
C&amp;D against an anonymous github page?
---
It will do nothing. They either have to ban 3rd party clients, or allow these plugins. They can't enforce a middle ground.
---
If you have to resort in cheating to make a game enjoyable then I'd hate to see how you deal with real life tediousness. If you don't like grindy games don't play what is arguable considered the king of grindy games.
---
This is generally funnier when you post someone elses comment
---
I actually really love the minigame, so the diary is gonna be fun for me to do. It's just some of the teammates I get stuck with that I don't like.
---
Join the clan chat which is OSRS Weekly
---
They are a really nice group of people and they will give you tips if you ask and help you out

full black d hide, archer helm, snakeskin boots, glory you'll be able to do it
---
in rs3 if you dont like the spins, dont use them?
---
gambling style mtx are predatory and unethical and should at the very least be more regulated. 
---
but just because rs3 has a different, worse, issue doesn't mean we should be grateful and just accept the lack of game integrity in our game. im perfectly able to be opposed to both mtx and cheat clients
---
I actually enjoy it too, I just haven't gotten around to it as I'm waiting for some friends to run their torsos so I don't have to play with randoms that don't listen.
---
Because they are actually keeping a tbow in the bank and the rebuild takes like a week
---
H
---
That was my thought. Technically they're probably not infringing any copyright, especially considering it's not compiled, and is dependent on a separate piece of software. Not saying it shouldn't be addressed, but legal action is hardly the answer here.
---
🦀🦀mods won't reply to this amazing idea🦀🦀
---
He a noob lol took so long to turn on protect from meelee
---
this is such a troll! Hahahahahahaha
---
I'm going to keep playing. It probably doesn't look like much to most people lol but that account is nearly on par with my main, and really it has become my new main. And the fact that it's no longer HC is a bit freeing as now I feel like I can actually go into the wilderness to do some stuff there!
---
What I meant by the “don’t use them” bit was don’t use them if you feel like they ruin your game. Is someone with one click log burning really going to ruin YOUR personal experience?
---
I could be deeply misinformed, but I haven’t seen anything about OSBuddy that would ruin the game for others. 
---
I use RL though, so idk what’s really going on
---
Just like all RuneScape players and mods
---
And than say sit kid
---
Went back to it better prepared (after a bit of moping) and I just got another step since that was only the first step. When I do eventually complete it I hope the reward is good!
---
No :)
---
give credit where due before using our software :)
---
D claw price is definitely on par for a bis weapon but my point is still the spec is op, specifically for pking. I have no problems with it in Pvm
---
Ahhhhh the ole I'm not an idiot if u aren't one u would have authentication AND bank pin
---
Sounds like you watch too much DMM. The majority of pking is not some constant tribrid switch while nhing. The majority of people who pk will tell you to turn prayer off if you think about making it a nh fight.
---
Doing this on my ironman, were you able to do alot of other combat content on your account or were did you have to strictly focus on slayer
---
The correct answer is actually money wasting fashionscapers
---
Very nice comparison
---
Explore, train skills, do some quests
---
Always my favorite crossover
---
Back when gathering resources made money. I remember selling willows in the bank to people training FM.
---
Ok boomer
---
yeah let me hack into the osbuddy mainframe network and hypercharge their ecolinks to triangulate their earnings of the last year
---
More devs=too many cooks in the kitchen
---
It’s already a growing problem
---
Gays rejoice!
---
Im out of the loop. Are they banning runelite again or something?
---
ironically enough, bot/mod designers are actually pretty good people to consider giving a job, as they've already demonstrated their familiarity with the game and their abilities.
---
&gt; The only thing that dictates item prices on this game is the amount being sold vs the amount of people trying to buy it.
---
What about the amount of excess gold buyers have? Or the amount of gold the seller deems a fair price? Pretty sure there's more to it than amounts of people that are buying and selling it.
---
I was so sure the DDS was the best weapon for training. The dragon scim felt slow and hit less, and had a crap spec. So I trained my stats almost solely with DDS until I got a whip.
---
I didn't mean it as a counter point, just that you can't compare those numbers directly. I used to track logged in vs clients open since osb tracks both but I don't remember the average ratio. I think about 70% of open clients are logged in
---
If you can afford an ACB, you can afford to use bolts and darts better than mithril. Addy darts are the best option for 95% of blowpiping and broad bolts have the same stats as adamant bolts while also being cheaper.
---
Training prayer at gilded altar. 
---
I literally didn’t pay attention the whole time. Just bone to altar. And then focused on something else.
---
careful for that hp level
---
Lacking polish and refinement might be more accurate, it is rather clunky and would be in proved with some of the RL QoL features.
---
When a lot of people call the vanilla client unplayable what they mean is "now I've had better I can't downgrade"
---
You are in the wilderness dont complain about being attacked just be prepared
---
The entire game is already primative and ugly.
---
How is it clunky?
---
You're partly right, but it's not just server costs. It's basically a second game mode that has to be maintained as well. Even if it's not an f2p update, it still has to be tested there to make sure it doesn't break anything. It costs Jagex more than just spinning up a few more VMs.
---
I don't really see how any of that would help though, they can just establish the session through the default client and then hijack the connection.
---
Really jagex needs something like denuvo, this is a prime example of where denuvo would be a good thing for regular players.
---
Ur fault tho
---
&gt; its no different to other clients
---
xd
---
So Bowficient, is it me or F16 who TBed you?
---
OSBuddy recently added some really OP plugins, like 1 click to use bones on a gilded altar, 1 click firemaking and 1 click construction. There's also been lots of controversy in the last 3 months about custom runelite clients and plugins that pkers are using to auto-switch protect prayers, gear etc.
---
If you think killing someone in the wild is toxic, this would seem toxic as well.
---
No one in the original post talked about the sand casino, don’t be condescending.
---
thanks for the response and looking forward to it!
---
So, you admit you don’t have a clue lol.
---
there's a large amount of players who aren't cheat client dependent babies
---
Yup exactly, got hacked had 2a on posted an appeal immediately rejected tf am I supposed to do now?
---
The plugins take away from the game, devalue players accomplishments, lower the skill ceiling, and a large majority are simply unnecessary. Runescape is known for being a grind fest that’s part of the appeal. Simply put it’s not healthy for the longevity of the game and it’s sad that so many people seem to miss that.
---
Hammerstone. 2 gp on the GE while Barley seeds are 4 gp.
---
The best advice I could give you is don’t follow any guide on what to do. Just walk around. You see a rat that you want to smack but you don’t think it’ll be useful for any reason? Smack it anyways. If I could relive my days I started playing Runescape, I would. I didn’t use a guide and games that I’ve tried recently with guides just aren’t fun. They ruin the element of discovering things yourself and that’s the fun part for me. 
---
I’d say tackle a few quests without a guide. If you want to mine, mine. If you want to fish? Fish. If you want to go kill cows all day, go do that. If you eventually become a member (which I would HIGHLY recommend - most of this games content is locked behind membership), you’ll be able to do a bunch more too but for now just see what free to play has to offer.
---
Do they also consider working more than 20hrs a week a work disorder?
---
every clip in those tweets is based on your client l000l
---
You think mat will go back to his old ways and clean all osb users as apart of this exit strategy?
---
I'm fine with everything pkers do in terms of killing, but they seriously need a life with the trash talk
---
doesn't change the fact that those features will be around, all the clips in the OP are from runelite+ anyway
---
What do you mean you can’t get a team? If teams are looking for a role that you no longer need the points for, you should take the initiative and start your own team. It will fill up pretty quick. I’ve did fighters torso on about 8 different accounts now and I’ve never had an issue with getting/making a team.
---
Then quit, clearly the game isn't for you.
---
Not popular worlds, all f2p worlds actually! I remember having to wait until some item dissapeared after being one left in stock and rushing to sell your shit on that slot because people were waiting aswell lmao
---
You don’t regret it when you hit a win streak and rwt it all for a nice juicy 5 grand
---
youre blind then.......
---
I'm boutta defend my boy 6ixty9ine, but the case against him was use of a child in a sexual performance since he allegedly filmed it and posted it on his Instagram. Some other guy there got a bj from her and did time. He claimed to have not known her age and pleaded guilty as soon as the case was brought against him (you would have to be pretty dumb to knowingly post sexual content of a 13yo publicly to your Instagram if he was indeed aware - about as dumb as you'd have to be to tattoo big 69's on your face).
---
I believe the judge considered him to be telling the truth and charged him as a youth. They also ordered that he get his high school diploma and not reoffend for 2 years or some shit.
---
But then my dude let his nuts hang, didn't get his diploma and did some crimes and shit. Even if he beats his current fed charges for racketeering he's probably gonna have to register as a sex offender and/or do some time since that is still outstanding.
---
What's interesting is they probably told the judge presiding over that case in 2018 for resentencing to not give him time as the FBI was building a bigger case for the racketeering gang charges.
---
My guilty pleasure is following the life of this rainbow haired SoundCloud rapper, don't hurt me.
---
Im not sure what gives you the right to judge that. I enjoy mining while watching the news or a show on my main monitor.
---
They should let you keep your first untrimmed without going through hoops
---
These PvMers will never understand mate.
---
I don't think I could even look at the game anymore without GPU rendering. It looks so fucking clunky.
---
 ”Unzips penis”
---
Honestly get your frustration but i feel like mobile isn't a complete fuckup. I certainly love to whip out my mobile phone and run some agility laps, do some afk slayer or w/e. Sure it might not have done what Jagex would have wanted it to do but it sure as hell kept me in the game.
---
If each splat was independent, you could hit 40-40-40-40 with claws.
---
I know and it hurts to see us stuck to Twitter when posting real PvP stuff. Really like your misconceptions idea btw.
---
just do it fam
---
Be an Ironman and thief for 10 minutes with rogues and get yourself enough seeds for 20 runs or buy them from the chick at Draynor Village market. Or yeah, buy them from the GE.
---
I know buy i still try lol.
---
To be honest I mostly  use 3rd Party Clients so I can render with my GPU and have animation tweening. I play 50% on mobile anyway so if we all have to go back to the Vanilla Client my main concern will be people quitting and the game going quiet rather than anything personal...
---
This it's just osshittys way of staying relevant since their user numbers went to shit. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the grab data and run updated from them...
---
Well then jagex can watch those player numbers drooooop and big time.
---
Classic is out. Come back to us, brother.
---
So they’re trying to sabotage the whole competition. Petty and sore losers.
---
Happened once before with an osb dev, he'll probably do it again lol
---
My guess is that your not getting back on target fast enough after a phase/gear change.  The priority that I recommend is...
---
change prayer &gt; click to begin running to new position &gt; switch gear while running &gt; attack boss.  
---
It'll come with practice, but you want to maximize the time that you're attacking the boss.
---
Also, elite void for a range switch is better than hides or armadyl.
---
Is this about the latest update?
---
OW!!
---
Haha couldn't remember the full name, knew it was Swift something. Yeah, irc client and stat lookup, calculators and notes. And for colour schemes!
---
My man you come of as a guy who took intro to computer science at your local community college and decided he's an expert. Data sec != Software sec open source software is more secure as is software with active bug bounty programs. 
---
Here's why your strawman of just hand out your data doesn't work: 
---
For bad code to make it through the open source pipeline and into users hands a few people HAVE to look at it and many many more people might look at it. It takes only one person in that chain to say wtf is this shit and the bad code is outted as bad.
---
For your strawman it would take one bad actor to compromise my data if I entrusted it to everyone here. As apposed to open source where it would take many bad actors and have a trail and visibility to be found later IF it got through the checks. 
---
I know you like to believe that people don't read code for fun but legit every week I skim through the upcoming milestone for runelite and see how things are done cause to me it's fascinating. Don't have the time to contribute myself but huge respect to those who do.
---
I've gotten 8 of them banked :)
---
Menu entry swapper lets you left click the GE/bank instead of right click left click. Ban runelite.
---
Everything in this chain was worded as a matter of fact. There were a couple people in this thread i did honestly stop reading their replys. My main post and main reply to op received many upvotes and sparked discussion. I dont care to change the minds of ignorant people but i have helped many people through DM here. Again not sure where you would have seen anger or false superiprity, im a pker dude, all this politically correct and looking for any excuse to be offended shit doesn't apply to me. Ive also seen real truth being spoken by many on this reddit and they get mad downvotes. The hivemind is actually so wrong on some things lol now that is something to pity.
---
Just ban all 3rd party except runelite... They have been very open with jagex and are actually not scums.
---
Im a mobile only player and I feel like runelite deserve a pass
---
What's going on with osbuddy ? Osbuddy I'd the only decent client I can use on my laptop cos I run Ubuntu
---
Brain exploded
---
Vorkath is like working a day job, zulrah is like entering a local lottery
---
I guess it's each to their own. I don't disagree with you. But hardcore ironman is a competition of who knows the game best until a dc :p
---
wut
---
Thanks for your service!  Do you ever get pked at that altar with how low you are?  You seem to take a decent amount of risk compared to most.
---
That's not very nice, my son has down syndrome and I don't like this comment at all :/
---
Ice bursting in the mm2 tunnels fo sure
---
Right when I turned it on it looked awful, now I can't play without it
---
Explain to me how this meme is like the current situation with OSBuddy?
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pet
---
This has up to February if that helps.
---
Congrats!!!
---
&gt;The people around him deserve sentences, he deserves time off.
---
He's a pedophile. He does not deserve time off.
---
I'm happy he's bringing other despicable people to justice, but that doesn't mean he should get less time. It's unfortunately just a way to coerce people to out others.
---
Just ban OSB. I think adam has shown that he isn’t gonna take the piss and whenever there is something jagex doesn’t like he removes it instantly. And then there’s the OSB dev. Ex botter, robbed people and now makes incredibly OP plugins with nothing less than a fuck you. It’s obvious what he’s doing. He knows his client is dead in the water so is trying to get all competition removed because he can’t handle not being on top anymore. Yes he’s a petty cunt. Yes it’s my opinion and yes i do believe I’m right.
---
Holy fuck your Twitter is aids...
---
meanwhile in Linux osrs players: but how i can then get to game without 3rd party client? as far i know, Linux users can't play osrs without 3rd party clients since the standard vanilla client doesn't run on Linux.
---
I’ll never understand the people that defend skull tricking as a “mechanic”, its literally a hair above scamming and taking advantage of the clunky interface. 
---
You want to keep skull tricking, thats cool, but so too do you have to accept there is a mounting list of reasons people don’t want to be in the wilderness.
---
OSB used to be a botting client. They might just go back to that if all 3rd party clients get banned.
---
OSB Dev also has a history of hacking his users accounts to sell the gp for $$ with a former bot he used to admin for as well. So theres that option. Offer OP plugins, get a huge increase/return of users (victims) using client again, clean accounts, sell gp, leave and let whatever happens happens with clients not caring. 
---
Either way they don't care and it probably won't be a worse off spot then they are in right now, due to runelite killing them off basically.
---
With this plugin you only have to keep 1 pressed in at all times and leftclick in a certain spot every now and then. Before, you had to keep 1 pressed in and rightclick-&gt;leftclick rapidly to make sure you're on time before the butler returns. It makes the con grind way easier
---
The game isn't for you if you think either of those hard to get.
---
I did multiple trace routes on world 391. When my ping was over 140ms, the last IP it connected to was German. WTF Jamflex

---
Hey, guy who always does his puzzle box manually here.
---
You can memorize the algorithm, but its definitely much faster if a program walks you through it.
---
I’m worried about some of the lesser plugins that we’ll lose like ground items. 
---
Another one, and at the risk of being called bad, I think I’ll struggle to relearn demonics. Muscle memory is now based off that plugin.
---
Yeah they should just add sky as integrity update
---
It definitely has room for improvement in many areas but this community has gotten way too used to unfair plugins they can live without.
---
They dont require def when u use them for the quest
---
Isn't there a market for gold swap between OSRS and DMM? I've heard of people swapping DMM GP for OSRS GP, and having a really high exchange.
---
Big RIP dude
---
Yeah bollocks to that. That was fine 12 years ago. Jagex needs to get their head out of their arse.
---
Karma thot spotted
---
Fun fact, "mouse keys" =\= AHK. Using a program to change what input is registered by the pc when you hit a button, such as hitting the 5 key to trigger left click, was always fine. Automating inputs was always against the rules. The problem with AHK is that it could do both functions, one of which was keymapping which is fine and the other being macro input which was always against the rules.
---
Once upon a time it was actually against the rules as well. My cousin and I shared accounts when we were in middle school and we got a temp ban for it at one point.
---
You're giving this advice on reddit though.
---
:thinking:
---
D
---
You could use osbuddy there
---
They kinda have already made themselves the enemy
---
I am unaware of these things. :)       
---
     
---
I think it’s helpful, during the drama, to have someone to explain what’s going on - because I don’t play the game enough for this shit to affect me, but I enjoy the game enough to want to know what’s up.
---
Ya but I'll go from 20 hours a day to 10 hours a day, that will surely teach them a lesson.
---
Thanks for sharing. Doctor here. I highly recommend you keep going to therapy. It turns people's lives around.
---
This meme doesn't make sense
---
\&gt; The game would be better off without any third party clients, and the people that would leave with them.
---
Runelite is one of the major reasons osrs didnt die out lmfao.  Its hilarious how there are people out there who are so stuffed on their coolaid that they havent thought about how when the game has 48 players and 2 servers and no updates, the fact that "everyone else didn't deserve to play the game" will be little consolation.
---
My whole childhood my sister thought this was the name of the game
---
I got 99 fm without getting that or a Phoenix... gz though
---
points at Linux. What about them? as far i know Linux users can't play osrs without 3rd party clients.
---
Im in this picture and i dont like it
---
I charge money for a product, someone comes along with a better product for free, i try and shut down the entire market because i lost. Yeah no take your L like a man and move the fuck on.
---
\&gt; lmao you can make that argument about anything.   
---
You could, but its literally true that barring like 5 things runescape is not a skill intensive game.  Like at all.
---
Its not bigger than the 2004-2011 era lmao
---
When you tell the internet you are mad, theyll be sure to make you more mad.

I mean almost as much as i do on my 99 atk acc. My med is 109 max. My main is 123 maxed at 81 pray. Both have pros and cons.
---
What the fuck
---
If you actually think something is going to happen you should probably have a break and go to sleep, shit like this been going on forever and the next week everything is fine. Every. Single. Time.
---
Imagine being so addicted to a game you worry about a 3rd party client fight lmfao
---
Btw the runelite blue sky looks like dogshit, would be good riddance if that was removed
---
Can they do this? I find it hard to imagine exp gained by time is tracked for all accounts?
---
Would be quite bad gpm considering you would be snared for the whole time

Seriously, if you see claws come out you can just pneck and triple combo eat and laugh.

And then I got dragon axe at like 80kc and never realized untill recently it was 1/10k
---
I still think warding wouldve been nice for iron
---
I try to defend pvp cause it's part of the game but alt pvping is cancer
---
Even big YouTubers do it and people think it's cool
---
This is why we shouldn't let ironmemes vote on pvp updates, this guy actually thinks this idea is good.
---
They lost a engine dev recently too. They only had like 3 of them to begin with and thats been true for years. They're probably never replacing him.
---
Jagex can tell them to remove the feature all they want but it probably wont work.
---
Also, Jagex cant tell which 3rd party client you use, only that youre using one. The only logical way for them to stop this at its core is to ban all 3rd party clients and anyone using one will be banned.
---
This is all an exit strategy for Matt to grab more account details from people switching to OSB so that when 3rd party clients get banned and/or he has to shut down OSB/Doesnt care about it anymore, he can recover as many accounts as poss.
---
He has done it before and he'll do it again with no problem, the guy has zero morales.
---
Wouldn't this only very mildly increase the value of the item? It doesn't really seem thematic either cause runes aren't used in bulk to create a staff, and can't be retrieved
---
Yes you’re 100% right no sky looks way better, the blue sky makes osrs looks like sims 4 or some shit. It’s hilarious all these kids complain about keeping the game oldschool then they’re worried about a blue sky
---
Firemaking via wintertodt and agility via rooftops. Might not be quicker but variation can make it not as mind numbingly boring.

Ow!
---
The only retard from this comment chain is you and thats a fact. Using words like hivemind, believing youre absolutely right and the vast majority are wrong and dumb because they cant see the real truth that you, the alpha, can.
---
Reminds me of the people from that louis theroux documentary: americas most hated family. Everyone is wrong but me, true insanity.

Id love to see what your life is like because people like you simply cant function in society, sat behind your screen in your tinfoil hat worshiping your own almighty omniscience.
---
YouTube a 1-99 crafting video
---
I am still against the use bones. Did i use it.. yes. I am against this, will i use it... well yeah.
---
I doubt jagex would do it. 
---
But it's kind of like what blizzard did with add-ons. Pretty much built almost every popular add-on into the base game and made them obsolete.
---
If you’re going to quit based off what client you’re playing on then just quit please
---
He can’t calm down someone insulted his runelite, dudes probably still yelling at his mom about it

I had to play on a computer without GPU rendering a while back, shit was awful, only thing I could do was bank standing skilling and even that was painful.
---
And the ones that do will be bottom of the barrel anyway.
---
Theres literally no benefits to working for jagex, except that you literally cant get a job anywhere else in the industry.
---
but how do i activate it? or is it only for p2p osbuddy?
---
This is the type of history I like to see.
---
Hahahhahaha omfg dude keep going. I am saving every single one of these, ahh bless
---
What gives me the right to judge? this is a public social website, everyone has the right to judge everyone. 
---
The 3rd party clients are more convenient but are in no way required to play the game even when watching something on another monitor. It's really not that hard to adapt. When an update comes out that makes runelite unusable for a short time so you have to go back to the vainlla client it takes like 5 minutes to get used to it again then it's fine after that.
---
AFAIK they can't detect what client you're using
---
Honestly yeah, thanks for confirming for everyone how delusional you are lmfao
---
They probably friended you to know which world you were in
---
I was kidding.. OSB ruins the integrity of the game with its broken plugins
---
I wish I could escape from this game but it seems we're all stuck here in the land of Gielinor forever lol
---
I see you also saw the DtRH vid.
---
Where did they release the code?
---
I would just bring telegrab runes. I don't care about wasting the runes, I just want the numbers for maybe 2000 revenant kills.
---
They did this before. It's called rs3. Micro transactions aside... The insane amount of QOL has ruined the game. The 'kek' reference to my knowledge is from world of war craft... A game which too relaunched itself with wow classic and is absolutely smashing it now on twitch and wowcensus. It shows that too much quality of life dilutes the thing that makes rpgs good... The grind and prestige of being amongst the few
---
Thank god because it's either mute or 11...

You should watch rendis firecape video, he did it on a level 17 or something ridiculous
---
Just started watching it before i left for work. Totally forgot he was a thing back in the day.

I was thinking a boss that could be an alternative for both, not just one or the other. Plus lesser demons aren't assigned by higher level Slayer masters and they're really not assigned much by the lower level ones either.

From the wiki: " The **Sinister Stranger** is your competition during the quest [Fishing Contest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fishing_Contest). He claims to not be a vampyre, despite very obviously being one."

This is the first time OSB has done something like this. It hasn’t been going on forever.
---
No they won't.
---
You say that, but if enough people did that, jagex would be in trouble.
---
Doodoo
---
You definitely have a good case for agility (ignoring silverhawk boots) but on RS3 bonfires are super afk and insane xp
---
That's why I said c&amp;d
---
I once teleported to GE and saw a gravestone (yeah it was RS3 but still). A few seconds later some famous guy whos name I can't remember comes and claims it.
---
A few hours later I found out from friends I ended up in a stream and that guy said something like "not getting my stuff bitch" about me. The fame is real
---
It’s an anglerfish.
---
Like tapping the screen twice is so hard. The game even highlights the game tab when something drops. Open to see what the drop was, close. It's faster than reading that last sentence.
---
What woman would look at that and just think “yes please”
---
Wasn't this posted the other day and someone pointed out it's a movie prop?
---
I’m gonna be honest with you, if all you nerds talking about people quitting after runelite is gone are right (you’re not) the community is about to get dramatically better.
---
Support is atrocious. Decided to try and come back to the game and try playing ironman. Account banned within 24 hours, reason given as "Macros". But no macros/bots were used. 
---
Only things I can think that may have triggered it was using runelite, which is supposed to be okay at the moment. Or the fact that I played inside of a VM at work, which also shouldn't trigger it as I did it on my main for months with no issue.
---
And of course all support will say is "Submit an appeal, we may do something about it in 2 weeks". Cool taking my money and then immediately denying me access to what I paid for is totally cool.
---
wait WHAT?!?!?!
---
1/100,000,000 or 1/100 million
---
Yes, all those other crimes are typical stupid adult shit. The fact you don’t seem to care about what he did with that girl says a lot about you man....
---
Dude's already a multimillionaire so I doubt he will have to do much. But he's really really dumb so maybe he'll spend it all really fast.
---
The thing is it’s just straight up bannable because it’s not using 1:1 ratio. We’ve had clients remove plugins before for being too overpowered before and the same thing will happen again.
---
honestly I wouldn't even mind the p2w aspect of rs3 I just hate the combat system. shit even the graphics are whatever to me just like wtf is up with the combat
---
Use an ad blocker
---
Right? This is exactly what warding was suppose to do and now people are asking for it. Smh this community.
---
There is no skill in fighting someone who isn’t fighting back or gang banging a solo dude with three iteming and a spade
---
Frankly if it's just Jagex making an official statement I'd be okay with that. As it stands the rules are so horrendously unclear that it's very difficult to say which plugins are and which aren't okay.
---
RuneLite is an open-source piece of software, as such unpaid people put a lot of effort into making new plugins that, for whatever reason, can be taken offline immediately after. Simply because there is no official stance on what is deemed "okay".
---
Really, the only reason why we as a community think that that is an undesirable outcome is because we don't trust Jagex to make the right call. I find it a bit strange that all of the hatred is focussed on OSBuddy whilst really it's Jagex's decision that we fear.
---
If Jagex decides to blanket ban all third party clients that will be on Jagex, not OSBuddy. Were it not OSBuddy doing this, it would have been some fork of RuneLite.
---
We need an official statement on third party clients sooner or later anyway.
---
23 hours left! Go go go!
---
clan of pures? I stay. a naked level 3 named "rocko6234"? I  hop
---
Dracula don’t suck
---
Did you read what I said? He says that’s what happened with another guy, not him. I just can’t remember the name he dropped and the interviews are quite long for me to go find out again.
---
I'd rather have a smaller playerbase than the absolutely EZScape we're seeing.
---
It’s like power steering or airbags in cars. I’m sure people loved cars still before power steering came out but now no one in their right mind would buy a car without them it it now. It was an objectively better way to make a car and it doesn’t make you more nostalgic if you get a car without them, it makes you an idiot.
---
:)
---
Support, it should work this way for all combo staves, not just steam. Lava staves are alch junk right now, dust staves are almost alch junk, mist and mud are almost completely worthless, being worth maybe 80-100k.
---
The only one actually worth anything is smoke.
---
40k of 2 types of runes pegs the minimum value to around 400k (40k runes *5 gp each *2 types of runes) on the ge, making them at least somewhat decent drops.
---
Username checks out
---
It's actually a nice way to make some 07 gp with little effort
---
You can want whatever the hell you want.  Just realize that you asked for it when the content updates come slower and slower until the game winds up failing from lack of cash flow.
---
I'm really not, though.
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
w...why limit yourself to static, slow movement?
---
CML was having errors for a month or so after they sold it to h8
---
Agree with everything but a company has to find ways to increase revenue.
---
I'm Bullshitting because you have a slow learning curve? Okay then.
---
That would actually be so helpful. But the old fashioned way is the only way so far.
---
So, the same thing as OSB?
---
"god damn zeros" bro its unluck
---
🦀🦀🦀JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST CHEAT CLIENTS🦀🦀🦀
---
Yh remove another aspect of pking which people have been using ever since wildy came out! W00t!
---
If Jagex gives keys to clients, they can force the clients that connect to not work unless they have a Jagex approved key assigned to them. They currently don't do anything as far as blocking 3rd party clients, they just let all the connections come in, without caring who it's from
---
Because Osrs is a slow moving game and camera angle doesn't have a major impact on completing a task. I use zooming in and out much more than middle mouse camera movement.
---
My buddy always pks the YouTube’s haha. Always.
---
honestly I wouldn't even mind the graphics aspect of rs3 I just hate the p2w. shit even the combat system is whatever to me just like wtf is up with the p2w
---
I can't provide proof as to how much they're making, but you can extrapolate from the slow decrease of osbuddy users and then rise of osbuddy users that the amount they make would also dip and rise in the same fashion, as it would make no sense that the ratio of free to pro users would drastically change as the user count changes.
---
This is talking about 3rd party clients. I'm not suggesting a fix to Java app reflection bot clients, and that's not what this is addressing, so I'm not sure what your point is regarding my suggestion
---
Died died
---
MERCILESS KILLING
---
mine does it everytime i log in on pc not mobile or my laptop
---
No I didn't yet
---
&gt;typical stupid adult shit
---
Ah yes your typical stupid adult gets caught up in a prison gang and eventually gets numerous federal RICO charges.
---
Also when the fuck did I say I don't care about that lol?
---
You're actually a complete idiot.
---
I use arrow keys, so much better imo
---
So why does runelite change the option then? Or the spirit trees are 1click to travel now.
---
Downvotes for telling the truth XD
---
You can use legacy for pre-eoc combat
---
also, key assignment kills other people building their own clients without applying through Jagex. This system is what discord uses to moderate and distribute their bots, and it'd work similarly to other developer APIs being used all over the web
---
all these plugins exist on runelite based private clients also
---
It's not as bad as people say.. I stopped using 3rd party clients a year ago, and I do just fine doing anything on the game.
---
They could certainly update the vanilla client though.
---
Doubt it
---
Given that you got a visage, the odds of one on your next kill were 1/10k.
---
I think a large part of it is that it devalues the time, effort and money that people have put into skilling already. Getting 99 in anything in RS3 is super fucking easy these days thanks to double xp events and MTX, and it's no longer a sign of dedication to the game that it used to be. Back in 2005 when I first got into the game, getting a 99 in anything seemed like an impossible task, and I would be in awe of anyone wearing a skill cape. I think people want to hold onto that feeling, and not let OSRS go the way of RS3. 
---
That said, I agree with you to a certain extent. A lot of OSRS just seems to be grinding for grinding's sake. It doesn't make the game any harder, it just turns some skills into a massive time-sink. I don't think one-click skilling is the way to go, but I would support additional, quicker ways to earn XP that actually take concentration and skill. I don't have any ideas on how to do this, though. Maybe something like Wintertodt but actually difficult? Quicker XP but you have to work for it. Messing up would have repercussions. Dunno.
---
If you are using F keys your hand is not on wasd
---
Everything
---
Got pked by b0aty when he was really into dmm.  video has like 350k views still look at it once in a while
---
Mee hoy minoy!
---
&gt;he deserves time off. 
---
You're fucking stupid as shit mate. Him helping taking down shitty people doesnt make gim any less human garbage.
---
They wouldn’t just ban large margin of the community, especially when there no official statement along the fact that this construction QOL isn’t bannable. The prayer method is 100% bannable since that increases the hourly xp rate.
---
The overall community will be much more enjoyable when you sweaty incels actually quit because a cheat client won’t be able to hold your hand anymore. Bye neckbeards
---
Can't temple trek on 1 defense but, yes, a 50 attack pure with 1 prayer 1 def has gotten untrimmed slayer.
---
Well they do say customize your hero....
---
I mean... That's been jagex' stance for years?
---
They would ban ahk if it was picked up as a bot. They mentioned if mouse keys allowed ahk type functions they would ban that as well.
---
The real question is if they really can. Like is it detectable, etc...
---
How does that work, the attack delay is based on the last wep you hit with, so wouldn't you need two ham smacks to take advantage of the attack speed? Is 2 ham smacks &gt; 1 whip hit?
---
im not confident in them doing anything but my point is bucksbanana is completely missing the point of why people are tweeting at jagex.
---
I wish I could make the dwh permanently untradable
---
Gpu renderer, fog, skyboxes, anti aliasing, smoother textures, smoother animations all make the game vastly more visually appealing while retaining the OS feel and art.
---
Skilling stuff like marking squares for banking, highlighting agility click boxes, hunter traps timers, afk notifications, and many more all make skilling much more smooth and less tedious.
---
Whats the deal with the censorship, 2007scape mods?
---
You will never see me cry, just laughing when your clients get banned. They ruin competition, period.
---
Based on what I've seen (mostly from the Runescape subreddit actually) the Chinese compant who owns Jagex (Fukong Interactive) is fuuuuuuuuucked already. They're literally just trying to squeeze as much money as they can out of Jagex before they're forced to sell it by the Chinese Stock Exchange because they're super super in debt. So Fukong gives zero shits about the future viability of Jagex, which is very concerning.
---
Just looked him up... extremely impressive, especially for an UIM account.
---
Ah gotcha.
---
But runelite good and Osbuddy bad.
---
OSB, with its current business model, will go out of business anyway. Even just hiring a single developer can easily cost more than 100K/year.
---
RuneLite is free and outdevelops OSB, this is their last ditch effort. OSB has nothing to lose.
---
Excessive ha ha's, over punctuation, constant insults, attempts to belittle, you really do show every sign of a troubled emotionally under developed young adult. 
---
If you want to talk about it im prepared to put this behind us and help you through it.
---
No, you come with your own sups, but there are 1 or 2 reward chests inside that pretty much give u 2-3 pots free
---
Everyone wants everything easy, lazy fuckers
---
The game have less than a year if 3rd party clients are not stopped or restricted. That i can pretty much guarantee lol.
---
I am not basing that on reddit lol.
---
Scythe is about 630m now
---
Bgs is fine since you need one in the team anyway. Just need friends who can loan 20-30m for the rebuild. But yeh I get you, dwh is nice.
---
Between adults as in mentally capable of making logical decisions. They fuck up, that’s on them. 99.9% of the time Nobody gets murdered for no reason. It’s usually retaliation for something. Child abuse is 100% the child being taken advantage of against their will and then they have to live their life thinking THEY did something wrong and in absolute fear. Look at the long game.
---
Nifty, didn't know this, I'll see if i can find a video.
---
Haha rol doesn't remove poison?
---
Jesus, this is why I don't play any hardcore anything. I don't know what is rs3 and what's not in osrs...
---
I was in the latest Torvesta vid, I'm so happy
---
D3 and Poe main game modes are dead outside of seasonal resets people hop on play for a couple weeks then move onto other games until reset time rolls around again.
---
Dividing the player base of a game that already has a large amount of discontent for where the game is at/headed is an absolutely horrid idea.
---
Imagine ever trusting OSB lmao, you all knew they were originally a bot client
---
I have a very specific question. If I die outside of wilderness in pvm with a decayed (0/broken) blighted hood of ahrim on, does it go to my inventory when I respawn, as its not tradeable and equipped, I'm hoping it stays on my head, would this be true?
---
If it is not already broken, my belief is it goes to your inventory broken, but if it hits 0 while its on your head, it stays on. BUT will it stay on like that, through a pvm death outside of wildy, if its already at 0, and equipped as a barrows item? 
---
I can't find this answer anywhere.  
---
\- its not a tradeable  
---
verses  
---
\- barrows goes to inventory on death (if not protected, it wont be protected)
---
Kind regards,  
---
\-
---
How long does that acutlaly take pls?
---
If you turn on the valuable drops in chatbox for like 1k, you'll just get spammed, which isn't the most viable option...
---
OSRS has its fair share of issues and drama too. But, welcome aboard!
---
No. It would fucking not be cool.
---
You obviously don't know what runelite actually does, or you have a very outlandish idea of what OP is
---
you... you can do that? O.o
---
ok and? this is about risk not profit
---
That's a Gameboy SP. Please restart with actual GBA
---
i left for a lot of the reasons you stated but i do love w345. i'm thinking of coming back with a new profile (my old one got hacked!)
---
couple of things to add:
---
1) you're not forced to train combat skills outside of safe zones. you can get to max combat all without ever leaving a safe zone. it's not the most efficient, but it's doable if you're afraid of pkers.
---
2) the safe deposit box is your best friend. use it to store alchable wealth (if you're sub 1m in wealth) or your most important pk gear.
---
your post made me wanna come back!
---
Zeah is the biggest thing that you could do at low/mid levels. There's also lots of new clue scrolls (beginner which is below easy, elite and master which are above hard).
---
There's a lot of new stuff in slayer, and then a lot of new bosses and end game content!
---
Here's the list of ALL updates to OSRS. Obviously this is a bit overwhelmingly large, but if you want to like start at the beginning it could be a good place to start.
---
I bought some raw hides off the ge, I used lunar spell to tan them, which then I used for crafting xp. Then I high alched the black dhide bodies I made. The the combined gp/xp for both skills was a Lot cheaper. Took a while but was afk!
---
Nah I'd actually quit. If they ban RL the game would be unplayable for me (item indicators, tile markers, GPU, etc.): PS4, old friend, I'm coming back.
---
Also my playtime on RCT and Minecraft would skyrocket.
---
If you start from scratch and evenly train attack strength defence and ranged (cannon), you will end up with 96 across those skills. Same goes for pures, except you replace the 96 attack and defence for 96 magic since pures will be using the Trident.
---
Oh yeah, MES is totally not macroing.
---
This is oldschool. It's not supposed to be as consistently or drastically updated.
---
I too would like to know
---
I love tiles. there's some turn based strategy game I wanna get that looks like this, it's on my steam wishlist
---
I didn't think the brainlet memes were true but wow I was wrong. We have live proof here, unless he's just trolling.
---
ur gonna be pressing the cloud not the swordy
---
Even here I’m constantly reminded that Bruce is leaving.
---
You don't have a clue what you're talking about, and honestly thinking a hard reset is an actual plausible solution to anything is completely laughable to the point I'm not even interested in debating how flawed your assumptions are.
---
They won't, and I promise you they can see right through this bluff. Either way it doesn't matter, RS3 is still their cash cow.
---
One that knows the pricetags I guess
---
Not changing it but ok lol
---
There was a guy who suggested I change my password for osbuddy and for my actual account. I did it earlier just as precaution because I am at work and can't do it at home.
---
Just doing my part to make the internet more hostile and uninviting to all!
---
Waaah I quit came because I don’t have plugins 😪
---
so wouldnt it be possible for jagex to detect the length of time between these packets hitting the server from client and flag them for it?
---
This is beyond adding simple overlays and getting packet spammed seems like an easily detectable ban, I suppose OSB could then just add random delay between sending the packets though. It at least would force the xp rates to be lowered
---
Make a new discord, change your in game username three times and it’ll be ok?
---
Look at his comment history, hes one of those guys who shits their pants for xp gains
---
EOC has the combat triangle harshly enforced.  Were you trying to kill Lesser Demons with melee?  They're magic class enemies, so they ignore a lot of your armor and you have a huge accuracy penalty to hit them with melee.
---
Whats the plan? To clap them in multi?
---
Did you follow the rules?
---
* **Raiding Rules**
---
* Do not kick or leave a raid without consulting a Moderator
---
Ty for pointing that out! I'll fix the guide to reflect that
---
Been unsure what the actual rules are on all that.
---
And thanks for the compliment :)
---
You can cancel membership by card number
---
Congrats
---
yeah i know that, but most people seem to think it is a rule, even when they dont follow it and use runelite features that break that rule as well.
---
I was in a MintMadCow vid when LMS Beta was happening. Just standing outside the area. I typed "This boy dummy thicc." Good stuff.
---
I work full time too, so feel your pain. That said, there are nmz setups that only require you to click once every 15 minutes (can do via phone with Remote Desktop)s and still get 60k+ exp/hr with base 70s stats (higher exp with higher state).
---
There’s YouTube video guides out there but basically you run full obsidian setup w/ 6 super combats and rest of inv is absorptions. Do normal rumble with: trapped soul, count Draynor, sand snake, king Roald, and the Kendal. Once every 15 minutes you just top off your absorption and re-pot. Takes 20 seconds max.
---
Mom: “Get off Runscape”
---
Power in numbers m8
---
We're all sweaty incels here boyo
---
I think their bot can track name changes.
---
Wdr doesnt have a lot of rules but unless someones griefing you do not kick. Mute, screenshot, finish the raid and report after. Its not a hard rule to follow.
---
if you evenly spread melee and use a cannon a lot you end up base 96-97s with 99 slayer. Loads of room left to do normal content, plus you can keep an untrimmed cape.
---
Yeah let's completely ignore the fact that dyslexia is a thing, and some people struggle to read text. I also use the wiki quick guides but I'm not going to pretend that it's the best method for everyone. You're an idiot.
---
Thank you!
---
140ish on my old iron
---
He bombed a federal building that had a daycare in it.
---
we just need a boss that drops unique high end items that takes more damage from steam battlestaff than other weapons
---
Idk I barely played the game before runelite. Runelite made the game playable for me so going back to it without the client sounds like a shitfest
---
Did you read the post?
---
He knows it's against the rules.
---
Amenity pked me on stream once and it was the best moment of my career
---
OSBuddy bad Runelite good. Punish everyone using menu swappers.
---
That’s strange, I’ve never heard of getting a back to back task outside of the slayer cape perk.
---
Seasonals have ended for the foreseeable future. Jagex couldn't get their shit together &amp; there were too many screw ups every season, so I guess they've shelved it until they can really iron out all the problems.
---
345 is like seasonals, except it's never reset &amp; some of the mechanics are a bit different.
---
Nice
---
i got killed in one of sparc macs vids and this was literally me
---
I saw myself on pornhub. Made my week aswell
---
Similarly, I remember seeing a dickhead from my rs2 clan get worked in a vid at mage bank in like 2011. That made MY day
---
have you met my friend, C Engineer?
---
How long should it take them to do something then? After all you cheaters get your undeserved 99’s?
---
Ty
---
They certainly do. As I admit, I am being very dense about it. I think the game does provide the information I need to get used to the combat, but I never put a lot of effort into understanding it so my experience suffered as a result. My fault, but at the same time I generally dont put a ton of effort into this stuff and have figured it out pretty easily in other MMOs (casual gamer here). So that's the only point as trying to make and why I made sure to include that the confusion is self inflicted haha
---
Still alive and kicking! No matter how many people are on, you'll always find a crowd at the GE
---
F***ing gold. We’re all slaves of God Ash
---
My middle mouse button doesn’t work so I have to use WASD
---
Dude this is literally brain dead. What a fucking stupid thing to say
---
is that a newer thing? I swear the first couple of times i tried to get my stuff back from vorkath it made me pull the coins out. If not im prob just dumb
---
I absolutely agree that the new plug-ins are cheating.  If Jagex is going to accept some plug-ins and deny others, they should have a client that adopts the plug-ins they approve of. I agree that the playing field should be level, but I think there is a way to achieve that without taking away the plug-ins that make the game more enjoyable. More oversight is definitely needed (the new osbuddy plug-ins are a great example of that).
---
And a seed dibber as the handle!
---
&gt;for your left hand to be there on the keyboard
---
Tbf I said the specific location
---
There is no way to tell what client you are using they are all running the same things.
---
Leave rs3, join us
---
That whole system seems to allow people to be toxic with no consequences
---
Yes and if you look at the ban list you also see he's not listed exactly as a scammer.
---
 **im kas** - Refusing to split ancestral bottoms equally
---
He could have just as easily split equally and not done raids with that person and/or wdr but instead decided he was right therefor he didn't have to follow the rules.
---
Better then they did, pinged them on twitter like all the threads suggest and all i got was "Use the ban appeal" which I had already done, and most threads report they never get a response.
---
Ah on the keyboard. Completely forgot f keys are on the PC tower
---
Your RS3 account will always be there if you change your mind, so you don't need to feel like you lose out. As an RS veteran you'll probably adapt quickly. Welcome aboard!
---
Playing on desktop is definitely more fun though
---
All that for a drop of runecrafting xp?
---
sounds like spaghetti code to me
---
Yeaaaaah buddy!!
---
I need to know the thought process behind picking agility as someone’s first 99 lmao.
---
They tweeted about the OSB situation this morning, maybe if you did some research you would have saw it. I won’t bother linking it because it’s one of the top posts on this subreddit as I type this.
---
Join a proper clan or find some mates
---
wait, there's a better client? what am I missing here?
---
Why the /s? You’re right
---
I'd love to be experienced enough and have experienced team to do it that fast, lol ;d 
---
It normally takes 4-8h with randoms, but you are right
---
Solo mission DMMT day 2 like 2 years ago, had no clue until a cc member told me that I suck at pking 🙃
---
He did say wasd, just referred to it as "there".
---
Because Runelite doesnt support macroing. If jagex says they are okay with skirting bot detection in that way then runelite will likely copy the feature.
---
07 is a pay to win mobile game. Hell, they’ve got a bond pouch front and center for all the kiddies to spend their money on gp.
---
Most of the grinds arent even that bad when you realize how to balance time/gp cost. Back in the day you would look at a skill and there would be a time efficient method that cost large sums of money, and a method that takes large amounts of time, while also either being cheap, or generates gold, and you would defer to the latter. Except the latter only makes you 10m and takes 15x longer. 
---
So if you go and do something else that generates that amount of gold in a fraction of the time while training another skill, the save that money and spend it on the fast method when you can afford it, you've made 2-3x the progress in the same amount of time. 
---
I've made more progress in the last year than a decade of playing the game the first time just by valuing time over gold. They are fungible but time is objectively worth more. Methods that trade time for gp are a trap.
---
Either you're being obtuse or you're just ignoring/don't understand the word there.
---
Hand on f keys? Reasonable place.
---
Hand on wasd? Eh.
---
Two different locations, one is there (points at f keys) and one is there (points at wasd)
---
To add to this, don’t forget that people started getting hacked after using the bot client rsbuddy (now osbuddy) in 2010 after bot nuke when they lost their business.
---
Yeah that's gonna be a no from me dawg. Fire and water runes are 5 gp each, so that'd be 400k in runes.
---
I would get 85 range, imbued void, and certainly a bandos godsword. You could argue you could do vork now with just the bgs but you might as well get the other stuff out of the way before.
---
It's a game: so the winner is the one who enjoys it.
---
Why not just ban osbuddy client and set a precedent for runelite?
---
heres left click only con https://twitter.com/Thurco/status/1175147143503519746
---
left click the altar for prayer (adding completely new options to the game)
---
https://twitter.com/Thurco/status/1175147531132686336
---
heres an example from another 3rd party client of spam-left-click darts. this isnt in osbuddy yet, but matt has plans to add it (which you can see if you scroll up from that tweet)
---
https://twitter.com/NMZscape/status/1175853569129484289
---
Yes
---
I was this way too, nearly quit until a friend mentioned I should start an iron. Haven't looked back since. It might be just what you need
---
All Barrows items are tradeable when in their broken (0) state. Thus, it would be dropped on the ground on death if not protected.
---
Why not? Have it on a toggle. If people wanna go into a quest blind they can. People like me can toggle that bitch on and power through quests easily without a second monitor.
---
...turn off the plug-in.
---
Thats still vague as fuck.
---
Is there a big difference between the two? And is monkey madness 2 a pain in the ass like 1?
---
I hope everyone that uses a client quits because they ruin the game
---
Over half of the player base used it or have OSBuddy installed. Best they can do is check the individuals who trained what and how much experience was gained. Though that not the right ethical approach to this whole situation and they’re response was pretty vague. 
---
Also just ignore the trolls on this Reddit. They like seeing people get banned due to the drama that comes out of it while not acknowledging the RuneLite has cheat features on it own behalf.
---
Jagex should ban all 3rd party clients and update theirs, adding gentle stuff like item indicators and notepads.   All this overpowered spoonfeeding client bullshit has got to stop.
---
If you cant handle playing the game without it being made into a childrens coloring book then just stop playing.
---
Either way, if clients are banned people quit. If clients arent banned people quit.  In my oppinion, id rather the people like you quit.
---
And no one cares, please do quit. We need less entitled brats on this game
---
I was like that until i started playing lms and endgame content. Now i use middle mouse button to move faster so i have more time to focus on everything else. Food, prayer, switches, ect so i dont waste 2 game ticks moving my camera to see a guy standing on the wrong side of me
---
&gt;continuously added super overpowered plugins
---
Like what? The jad plugin was removed. And the only other actually controversial ones are demonic gorillas, menu swapper for bones, and clue puzzle solvers. 
---
But even the tools for clues (like puzzle solvers, and all the clue locations/answers) can be found online easily enough. And pretty much every other plugin just makes available information easier to read, or provides something that an open browser and Google search bar can provide. 
---
Yes menu swapper for bones and gorilla plugins should be removed, but OSB is making literal 1:4 macros that trivialize tick perfect click intensive training right now, which is on another level entirely than highlighting agility obstacles. 
---
&gt; 3rd party clients need to go.
---
No, op plugins need to go.
---
Hell yeah I’ll be there. You’ll be the first person to know when I leave tutorial island. I’m really hoping I haven’t already started my dmm character on this acc and missed my 12hr window of safety lmao
---
Holy shit i thought this was a post about wow classic it really is a trend
---
&gt; In the end I lost my patience and we agreed to kick the guy from the raid. 
---
&gt;as it states in the WDR rules that you are not allowed to kick people from raids.
---
Looks like this was on you
---
Gonna finish up my blue dragons task and hopefully get another solid task next. Working towards Slayer Helm, put it off for a long time. I've been enjoying Slayer lately, mainly because I've been getting tasks with decent drops.
---
3372 for a black mask on my ex hcim....
---
It will decrease his defense level, by a lot.
---
My question is: Does dwh spec during phase 1 also lower his defence on phase 2?
---
the next lebel play*
---
No they wont.  Theyll quit for 3 months and come back as soon as the next slayer boss is adder.
---
If so, it's not the end of the world :b
---
You'd still have x5 exp forever! Hopefully you start with a clean slate
---
Looking forward to seeing you m8

Same

And this is why I hunt Black Chins wearing full Justiciar with a Dinh's.
---
Pest control/xp lamps are the most 'reasonable' ways.
---
I think it's a bit different.
---
With AHK you could literally do a series of pseudo-macros with just 1 button. Well, im not sure, you might still be able to do that, haven't really tried nor am I interested in.
---
But the plugin thing is literally just QoL, so it's understandable why there isn't much of an outcry. Why would there be? Stuff like the 1-click blacjacking is just common sense and should've been in the game since day 1.
---
You can flinch Elvarg in that Southeast corner but I wasn't remotely doing it right and just fell back on eating more
---
End-game content hasn't really stopped me from using WASD. In some of the comments below this I talk about fighting Hydra boss and using the zooming more than relying on adjusting camera angle.
---
The problem is we got a mini game for it now and everyone down voted all the rewards for it, so how are pvpers going to be rewarded if all the pvmers don't want the pvpers having better rewards then they have.
---
The -10 is a defencive stat. D warhammer reduces defence level and vetions defence is 395.
---
yes it does https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1037622636434677760
---
Not about being bad at rs, it's about the base client being terrible.
---
Not true what so ever.
---
In this case the rules explicitly say to mute the player, continue the raid, and report toxic person to the mods.
---
I do not play anymore, but WDR staff was super helpful when I came across these issues. They were also fair and fast in punishment.
---
OP did not follow the rules and was punished. That being said, if he corrected his mistake I feel he should be unbanned.
---
Not a clue, just hopping on the meme train
---
Isn't fletching super fast with bolts/arrows on osrs since you don't have to use the make x interface and you can just spam click them?
---
Nah use dragon defender.
---
Those are the odds he got them on first and second kc. Assuming he just got the drop, getting one in the next kc is still 1/10k.
---
How about seeing your own bots in a YouTuber's video? Torvesta tried killing my bots in a video a while ago.🤔
---
I deserved that one
---
Be careful making large trades of GP. Countries like China, Russia, and Venezuela get flagged for gold farming and go thru extra scrutiny when it comes to unbalanced trading. You may lose your account if you do activities that look like gold farming or rwt.
---
R/pathofexile will gladly take all of your free time.
---
Reminder that you're more likely to get a drop rarer than pet than to get the pet.
---
Ohh that answers it! I thought it needed a whole seperate account to play and would rather use a bond off my main instead of real money :p ill probably try it out then as ive got the next two days off!
---
A normal kill in the plane will access the Gorak Plane drop table, getting the kill in the midst of a TP or something causes it to roll the normal Gorak drop table, not the Gorak Plane table. Which if you look it is different than say the Gorak found in GWD. Nothing about guaranteed drops ( unless you’re talking about big bones lol )
---
Ban every op plugin osb and runelite has and only allow light QoL plugins like ground items and pot timers.
---
The swedish chef is out here revolutionizing farming
---
And how that changes the odds of 2 in a row is?
---
Almost like they're working on determining that and they only have blanket statements currently. 
---
Basically this is just saying if they determine a plugin is too much then they can ban you for it. So just don't use anything that's too OP and wait for them to make a statement about it. Spamming twitter is useless
---
With the rafs on &lt;3
---
But the rest of us would rather have people like you quit.
---
Can confirm, in torvestas “Upgrading the rushing gear” video I kill him once he gets to elder robes/occult and he put it in the video. To be fair he rushes me about two scenes after in edgeville and I get stacked for a smoke staff/occult/tome while trying to attack some dude in the bank lul (he ended up using the loot in the next episode)

Level 99 Invention
---
Cool opinion bro it kinda hurt my feelings. Maybe not everyone is autistic enough to tell the difference between two identical looking tiles and tile markers aren't game breaking. What in my original comment is cheating or game breaking?
---
Actually it'd be superheat form on curly roots with some invention perks on a crystal hatchet &amp; offhand. Something like 800k-1m xp/hr. Pretty high reqs tho, and it's also very click intensive.
---
OSBuddy in 2019

Living up to your name
---
well obviously they would only monitor the packet types and activities that are being abused. no1 cares about recharging prayer. i agree this isnt an optimal solution but I think it could be done to flag an account thats able to send way more use item packets on an alter then humanely possible in a short period of time
---
Open source and regulated do not go together.
---
That's not how that works though right?
---
So your solution is to ask everyone not to include unfair plugins, then try to detect those who don't do that, then take to court those which ones you detect, then try to detect other clients with unfair plug-ins which you first time didn't detect and take them to court. And you Believe that in that time someone hasn't make new client with little modification. Remember that client's can be just shared by players, how do you sue just random guys who share clients. Also do you know how hard is it to detect using unfair plugins, detecting use of client is much much easier so banning all clients would actually do something
---
&gt; frosty flowers
---
The dicing game that Fishy, the rwt guy, populated? What happened with that guy?
---
why don't they just tell tribot to cease and desist?
---
Its basically the most cost effective, well very competitive. Craws bow at revs is probably bis for most. But if u alt scape then blacks is def bis.
---
As of right now, getting 90 smithing for rune scimmy.. with that, I’m in search for an ornament kit. I’ll be getting 40 attack with just genie lamps. 
---
Also 750 total level.
---
Nah, if runelite gets banned im done. Playing on the vanilla client is unbearable now.
---
I have 70+ in all combat stats and I'll look into clan wars. Is it a safe place risk wise? Sorry I'm at work can't go on the wiki atm
---
jokes aside, that’d be cool if they added different color variants of pets and have the mutagens or just the colored pets themselves have a double drop rate of the normal pet, id say the mutagen though because i could see some people getting upset that they got the color variant they didn’t want.
---
If I had to guess, they're just going to nerf the mechanics the plugins themselves use. Expect a nerf to the wildy alter only allowing you to offer 1 bone per tick, just like what happened with regular prayer alters when left click use on bones came out.
---
Its double the xp but also double the pain in the ass. But 2x xp is too good to pass up

I got the phoenix in Wintertodt, was hoping for the dragon axe

Lmaoooo I remember having to explain that I needed 2 memberships
---
He look a little sick mane.
---
They are just implementing features that simplify tasks, like lighting logs or fletching darts with one click.
---
I just want to say that i can understand why people are angry but at the same time, people tend to have double standards, we have had updates like this get into the game under the *"QoL"* umbrella and everyone liked it then.
---
Is not like Fletching and Firemaking take any fucking skill to begin with what's the difference if people reach max level one or two hours faster? If anything training the skill is a nuisance.
---
Like i fail to see WHY this is so blasphemic to the game, everyone complains the skills aren't entertaining so why subject people to be bored when they can get to the fun stuff faster?
---
No i think jagex blocks ur attempts so u got to have thousands of proxies for each attempt to cycle and even then ur getting like 15,000 pages only.
---
Run escape their is no light at the end of the tunnel
---
cant really trust anything the jagex support twitter has to say, still glad i didn’t use any of the osb plug ins though.
---
Fuck WDR theyr're a bunch of powertripping dipshits, who cares what they think
---
I'm saying your suggestion wouldn't change anything.

None of those sound hard or bad whatsoever

Well except for OSB. They practically endorse OSB since they actively refuse to ban its users even though they can tell when players are using OSB.
---
People pk anyone in wildy because you never know what peoplle have.  Some people honestly forget they're wearing an eternal glory sometimes
---
Is it “log” or “logs” that is grammatically correct here? It’s bothering me.
---
if you only have that much gp id suggest getting something more all around beneficial to your account, a dfs is nice but im sure you could find a more useful upgrade for cheaper.

I'm at 70 base stats, except for combat, with like 210 QP and I still consider myself a complete noob.

Inflate and imbue every single RS item into one.
---
tried to find an open kraken world for 10 minutes while taking a shit because i didn’t wanna spend the 25k for a few kills, i was thoroughly disappointed.
---
Third age longsword and pickaxe are pretty expensive along with third age Druid robes.
---
That may be the rule and it looks like OP did break it, so this whole situation is kinda on him.
---
But I think it's a *bad* rule. I think WDR's mods handled the situation very poorly as well. Judging by the fact that they're entirely unwilling to edit the ban list and seemingly unwilling to be flexible at all, I don't think I'll be joining them or supporting their clan in any way. Especially if they have the kind of influence OP suggests; they are way too risky to even get near.
---
&gt;  If anything training the skill is a nuisance.
---
why not just make botting within the rules then?
---
But wOw ClAsSiC iS hArD and cHalLeNgInG!

JSupport has no shame, i doubt they'll remove lmao

ice ice babe

I feel like a piece of fungal meat irl
---
Can you look up open source software and explain how they're going to buy Runelite? Maybe I'm just derping here
---
Also if you report someone griefing/ being toxic from WDR in a raid that wasnt formed in their discord, they won't do shit. Oh this guy fucked your whole raid on purpose and you have multiple screens proving it? Well fuck you we don't care we would though only if you formed the team in our discord. Legit shit for brains no wonder only lows raid in their disc

That’s basically what happened to me - he spawned and I accidentally opened the door again, which spawned a second one. Thought it was pretty funny that they also both attacked me simultaneously, despite it being a single-combat area

IIRC for 95% of setups 96 str is the last unboosted max hit boost. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong.

https://twitter.com/Thurco/status/1175147143503519746 theres 2 clips here of the OP plugins. left click only construction, and ADDING A COMPLETELY NEW OPTION to altars to left click spam prayer, instead of having to actually use the bone on the altar

My psycho babble guess is that we are more attracted to specifically addictive games

Yes , and if u could buy this in solomons store it would be great. #makeosrsgreatagain

haha. it's funny cause nobody quits Runescape. NOBODY! You will always come crawling back like the rest of us. We are but slaves to the game killing time on Runescape. See u soon brethren
---
I'm guessing he either retired or started a swapping or gambling site like all the other big boi dicer rats.
---
Why? It makes more sense for people who used to play on OSB to continue playing on the client..since people tend to be stuck in the past. That's literally why OSRS is popular in the first place. Nostalgia.
---
Real players looking for nostalgia stick to the vanilla client tho. It's good enough.
---
i know you're joking but all it is is slow paced combat. the challenge is patience
---
sadly actions have consequences; don't break the rules next time
---
That doesn't work they have ways of tracking you
---
Or Zeah runecrafting, or prayer training, or construction.
---
There is no way for Jagex to distinguish between OSB/RL/etc. They can only see that you're on a 3 party client vs official client
---
“When a clan log in”
---
Tracking accounts by IP isn't as reliable as you think it is lol. You know bot farmers use proxies for each individual account?
---
Yes, everything is unequipped when you die so it’ll end up in your inventory.
---
OLM is an OLM not a dragon [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olm)
---
I find enough uses to justify keeping it. It's a great tank shield for it's price. Useful for Slayer, bandos, dks
---
According to osbuddy they are. Haven't heard anything positive from jagex themselves. I just know osbuddy has posted somewhere that the plugins that simplify the interactions were discussed with jagex and they said it's okay. No proof of jagex saying that anywhere though so I wouldn't believe them without proof.
---
I hate you
---
The reason Oldschool server came back was because PvP. 
---
But OSRS doesn’t exist anymore, now it’s EZscape or QoFScape.
---
Honestly, I think this is a fair option for Jagex to take. Maybe bump down the regular membership price and keep the same price for a Jagex-run runelite client.
---
What about Konduit?
---
No I don’t believe that is the case. The original creator now works for jagex doing bot detection though if that’s what you’re thinking.
---
Reddit has paid lip service to Runelite for years. This is nothing new, nobody have been in support of OSB the past year+.
---
They won't care about that, they've already lost to RuneLite anyway. It's Jagex who won't want a legal battle because it's expensive, so it's easier just to ban all 3rd party clients.
---
Why not make the skills fun in the first place?
---
I don't endorse botting one bit, however, don't design your game in a way that machines doing repetitive tasks are better suited for them rather than humans who want to have fun with a videogame.
---
Yeah its cheap. Multi is also cheap tho. Ur just bringing unnecessary risk
---
LOL. You're right
---
The bottleneck is the OFFICIAL CLIENT

It took me til 50 chests to get a item(guthans helm), done another 50 chests dry so gave up and haven't been back to barrows since

I saw this right before I got in my car to drive home, laughed the entire drive. I knew I had to share this.
---
I don’t think you’re understanding.  Their mods are volunteers.  They don’t have time to get into the drama of judging if every kick was justified.  It’s much easier to just take a report and ban the toxic players.

How many clicks/steps do you save by using clue help?

Switched from rs3 (played 2 months) to osrs last week and was struggling with money. Mostly sold what ppl dropped at the GE and had 8k coins at most until today
---
Today I found out about making bow strings and the first batch of flax I bought turned into 30k coins which now funded a much larger batch of flax :)) Very happy
---
I never struggled with money in rs3 cause my very first TH key got me 200m lul. That being said I am so over rs3 dailyscape. Enjoying osrs A LOT more, even tho I miss the money pouch and toolbelt. Now I hope jagex doesn't change their view in 3rd party clients bc of osbotty and I can continue enjoying osrs w/ runelite
---
At the same time that forcing yourself to play on an objectively worse client started making you better than people who choose modern convenience.

you make it sound like you sacrificed your account for the greater good... everyone knows those bots spamming at ge are scams lol, gf your account pepelaugh

Hahaha that's what you get for being a goblin boy. Back to the lumbridge collecting 10gp you go
---
Sorry let me rephrase though really shouldn't have to. How specifically are they doing this what specific action have they implemented or are going to implement that will have an outcome like this.  The question was asking you to expand on the image with some detail nto state the obvious
---
They also ban people if they're repeatedly toxic. You can report them to a mod after and they have a strike system for toxicity
---
I need to kill the dagganoth kings for the fremmenik tasks. What the easiest way? I don't really have any friends to help me on osrs.
---
I mean making light of a situation i put myself in yeah.and it wasnt a bot at the ge just looked it up lmao
---
I dont see how labeling items on the ground marking tiles is spoonfeeding. Same with exp trackers, being able to see clan and friend usernames overhead so you can pick the people you know out of a crowd, or being able to render using hardware you own. Or even just being able to keep chat logs in the chat when you hop worlds.
---
None of that changes the game. All it does it put information in a place where its accessable and useful. Thats the definition of quality of life. Nothing in RL breaks the game or alters the way any actions are performed in any discernable way. Thats nothing like the OSbuddy updates. You shouldn't lump them together.

No going back now.
---
why jagex would ban free money?
---
Personally it tells me that OP didnt have any proof that the guy they kicked was being toxic. Even after the fact its wayyy to easy to acreenshot chat logs. And youre gonna convince me that 3 people couldnt find a shred of evidence to their defence? Sounds like bs to me. They booted guy who wasnt part of their group so they wouldnt have to split 4 ways if drop, and then got mad that he told on them
---
Everything is so different. I’d suggest to just look a lot of shit up at first. If you think you know the best way to do something, there’s likely a better option now. The wiki and google will be your friend for quite awhile.
---
Yeah absolutely. It’s not a great situation for both parties, but when you’ve got thousands of people using a free service with limited staff it’s just a fact of reality.
---
I hope the press helps OP get a more temporary punishment.
---
Though your delivery a bit offensive I do appreciate the message. I agree there needs to be a balance between everything. The thrill and intense activity of PKing isn’t for everyone and those trying for the lucrative PVM bossing/other content of the wild need to be made aware that it is the Wild. I hope Jagex continues to put forth focus on PKing(player versus player) specifically into the wild and not just mini games. 
---
Making PvP worlds that remove and alienate the PKers is a detriment to a healthy server and to the wild. If these servers were possibly removed and there be added reward to the significant risk the wild offers this would help revitalize the PvP in this game.
---
Final thought, I believe lots of non-pvp members of the community view PKing as a vicious act on the innocent but I believe since the warnings are very clear when entering the wild and with a giant skull above active PKers would also continue to make clear the point that you’re not safe here.

The blackjacking and construction ones are just menu-entry swappers, not AHK. Like switching "bury" with "use" on bones when training prayer on RL.

Oh really so literally EVERYTHING else works fine including other youtube videos except this ONE video? Must be my speakers right? Lmfao.

Same, I really don’t get the issue. I used to use RSBuddy years ago but after the runelite controversy I just stopped using it and went back to classic client and it wasn’t really that bad 
---
I get 3rd party clients are nicer to use, but I think people are seriously overreacting. Like if you’re gonna quit over that and throw away years of progress just because you don’t like doing things manually or have slightly worse resolution, then I don’t really know what to say to that

I don’t think stuff like overlays belong in osrs, outside a few things like potion timers or maybe ground loot overlays, but even those literally save you a click or two realistically

1. He helped you in the raid all the way up until the point you kicked him - him not being there at the drop and "his points" being "deleted" due to the kick does not mean he didn't contribute
---
2. Him being in the raid to begin with raised the scale of your raid -- meaning even after you kick him, the scale is still set to the number of people as it began, meaning the points earned has the same multiplier -- tl;dr: he is giving you points even after you kick him
---
3. RW saying they won't post something does NOT mean it is "not a scam"... they will only post cases where the victim is "present at the time of a drop"
---
4. You straight up told the mods to ban you.
---
5. Your name will have (REPAID) next to it on the ban-list and removed from the "scammers" list to the "toxic" list so the 3rd party clients will not falsely label you as a current scammer.
---
6. You should realize how much easier this would have been if you literally just muted the guy, put up with his shitty raiding and deaths, and then put him on ignore after the raid.
---
Everyone here is bitching but I think you're right

Ooo you're missing out man. A truly full farm run is so satisfying with that quick 45k xp drop for doing nothing.

The cool thing is mains can do a lot of things with irons..  DKS, Raids, etc.  We've dropped woody but we pull him out from under the bed to play with him still on occasion :)

clan wars is safe, all you lose is you food/potions you eat
---
I used to be a general in a very large PK clan so I get it.  We don’t have time to deal with drama about “he kicked me mid trip” or “they all BSed me”.  If someone is brain dead or toxic, report it to me and I can quickly mute/ban him.  If you take matters into your own hands, now I have to deal with tracking down all parties involved, getting both sides of the story and working out a judgement.  When there’s 150 members, that becomes overwhelming fast.
---
Now WDR has the same issues only it’s an order of magnitude bigger.  If they had to do mini investigations every time someone like OP kicked someone, their mod team would be crushed.  It’s better to have simple retroactive rules so they can be enforced quickly and blindly.  It may not seem fair or desirable, but it’s the only way to keep a group that large functioning with only a few volunteers managing it.

What are your stats? They shouldn't be that hard if you have decent stats, worst case you just need to wait for them to be in good locations when you climb down.

NO THIS IS PATRICK
---
At lower levels ranarr is a bit risky. Another poster recommended harra, toadflax, and avantoe, and I completely agree. A good idea is to start unlocking the disease free patches and the teleport methods. Some targets to go for are: ectophial, ardy and lumbridge medium diary, hosidius favor (and lizard men/shayzien favor I guess for the xeric talisman), my arms big adventure (and making friends with my arm). Higher farming levels will get you into the farming guild for another herb patch.

I second this. Bought the Elder Maul to try at Sarachnis and got pet first kill lol.
---
agility training. Also the fact that there is a master clue step which requires 90 mining + prospector and also 90 wc + full lumberjack. Just the skill requirement is bad enough, but you're gonna slap on the outfit too? Jagex....
---
Right. Any suggestion I've seen here. There's a lot jagex could do. Nobody has suggested any real solution.
---
Also no solution will ever be 100% solid. Else we would have had those solutions for Botting clients themselves.
---
Mutagen for me.
---
Every rdt drop hurts.
---
Won't be polled, they will push it no matter what because alternative game modes encourage players to pay subscription on new accs to play these modes while afk'ing the main game accounts. Because without doing it, one can only log into one game mode.. not both.

That's it.
---
I mean... Look at the stupid shit you felt compelled to put in the chat box just to take that screenshot, probably not a huge stretch to assume you said something worthy of a mute. 
---
Not sure why you wouldn't have gotten the chat log transcript of what you said to earn it though.
---
Gl with that.
---
Did that last night which inspired this
---
What's stopping 3rd party from using reflection? There would be no difference. Sorry.
---
Most third party clients are just modded runelite, even some bot clients. They report as "Runelite"
---
Yea ok people in the comments RL isn't the reason you play no matter how big of a paragraph you write.
---
No take backsies
---
Oh yea injection pellets
---
Yes, or in game? Idk if thats possible
---
I don't really boss with them, I just hang out in there which is why I said "there are guys who do raids", so I can't speak to that part lol
---
&gt;The much easier solution would be to ban all third-party clients by incorporating checks into the official client and temp banning every account not using the official client.
---
If it's that easy why didn't they get rid of bot clients 20 years ago? They've just let them exist on purpose?
---
Wait... I literally just trained 57-60 and that was miserable enough. I just watched Theoatrix’s video and noticed left click black jacking.... how the fuck did I not have that on through RuneLite
---
Edit: jk it’s through OSBuddy I guess
---
*people won't quit if you add trade limit and EOC*
---
I pk on my ironman, doesn't matter to me.
---
Yes they're both left click but they're not dynamic. Build and remove are not normally both available at the same time, so it's just moving both options to the top.
---
Thing is, a lot ppl don't realize that everyone who started DMM had to deal with the same problems. Even like a week after it began, there were high leveled pkers ruining the fun for the low levels. You just have to learn how to evade the pkers. Gotta always be ready to teleport, and use uncommon training spots in the first place
---
Range lets him cannon
---
Add a hammer and I’ll vote yes to this
---
Ohhh I see. Thanks for pointing that out. I understand better now why some people are so upset
---
I'm Ravi. Spell my name correctly next time, please. It's case sensitive. What's up though, my nubnub?
---
I'm pretty sure when Pvp worlds were first introduced, the jagex newspost made a joke about 2 woodcutters fighting over a tree in pvp. Of course that never happened outside of red chins :(
---
that sounds kinda shit lol
---
We do raids isn't a clan. It isn't multiclanning. We do raids continues to grow. Sob stories don't cut it.
---
Still seems a little sketchy, but yeah less so than the others
---
I dont use a website, Idk if one even exists. I just do time over cost math and plan accordingly. 
---
I find skills that cost money but train quick, calculate the money to my desired level, then I spend my time training something else that generates money. I sit on that money until I have enough to get that desired skill level (and leave me a buffer), but while that money is just sitting there I invest it in merching. So im gaining revenue from both training to make money, and my money itself. Then I do asap methods and dump the gold to get the levels I want. Then I go back to training for money. 
---
Just make sure whatever youre doing has a synergistic effect that compounds your efforts to your goals. So for example, combat generates money and trains skills. Prayer costs a lot of money, but assists combat, so one helps you get the other, then once you have that, it amplifies the other skills, making them even more effective at generating that money, so now you're earning more money, and using that money to make more money, so the 2nd time around, it goes faster, and then you put that into other like skills, until you have maxed out all the skills that synergize in that bracket. You can then use your now optimal combat skills to generate seed capital to move on to others. 
---
It doesnt have to involve combat, theres other brackets of skills that synergize that have one or more that generate revenue that directly feed into other skills that consume resources. Mining to crafting and smithing, crafting and magic, hunter to range and clue hunting, fishing to cooking and agility, agility assisting runs of a dozen different skills, ect. 
---
The more you do, the more the snowball effect kicks in and makes every subsequently easier.
---
A lot of the players using these plugins are probably spam clicking and generating abnormally high rates of use signals being sent, even compared to the sweaty one tickers. When a casual who doesn't do tick manipulation suddenly is suddenly using bones on an altar 3 times per tick?  Easy ban.
---
change ur rsn
---
profit
---
ladyyellingatcat.jpg
---
Of course. It's gonna be like AHK, people that abused it before the official statement didn't get punished, this is going to be the exact same. Abuse the shit out of 1 click blackjack and construction. I wouldn't use the pray altar one, that seems way too sketchy too me.
---
I have been scammed a Tbow as well as multiple other drops raiding with people in the WDR discord, you really can’t trust anyone in there
---
I dunno, 200 xp is more than a Green D'Hide Body gives. And again, only 46 crafting compared to the 60+ you would need for a green d'hide body.
---
Ah yes, hero pvm resorts to recruiting reddit users. My expectations were low, but somehow I'm still disappointed.
---
I was wondering that as well. Didn’t get any armor either way...
---
Good point. I like it.
---
This is interesting. The more I think about it, the more I realize a "color blind mode" in games has benefits for everyone. For normal players, it can make the game easier at a glance like with League of Legends where your own HP bar turns gold. I feel like more game companies should put these modes in and leave it as an on/off toggle for players to pick on their own.
---
Only an idiot would argue that a 3rd party making modifications to a game is QoL.
---
1 click bj's sound great. Where do I sign up?
---
Probably not worth doing. I imagine turning giant seaweed into molten glass and then glassblowing it would be waaaaaaay better.
---
I've only ever played with Runelite so what is this Menu Entry Swapper people keep talking about?
---
I hated thieving so much. Ardy knights were painful until the 70s. Then I started failing less and watching Netflix. Don't remember doing the thieving but seeing that "600k xp gained" is so fucking nice. It's my highest level now
---
OSRS was officially p2w ever since bonds came out, deny it all you want but you can buy success in this game
---
&gt;nearly as much
---
There's your key phrase. By admitting you are willing to compromise, you demonstrate your lack of commitment to your own position. Define it as cheating if you like, but taking the time to google something breaks the immersion for me more than a blinking arrow. I'm looking to have fun, not play the tedious task of figuring out coords or the strange orb task. I've done them by hand in the past, but remembering every npcs name for an anagram or figuring out every riddle is not on my to-do list. I'd rather do a few clue scrolls as a break from other content and then get back to the next task I have planned.
---
Maybe ten years ago I would have agreed with you, but not now. That doesn't mean there aren't other things we won't agree on, but this is most likely not one of them. All the same, have your fun your way, and I'll have fun mine. \^\_\^
---
On a side note, does anyone have a *clue* on how "Thanks, Grandma!" relates to the answer of going to see Tynan?
---
People said they'd quit if warding failed. 
---
Guess what happened.
---
Pretty sure glass blowing would be faster at the end of the day
---
I love how you put your opinion out there and get downvoted. You didn't present it as a fact or everyone agrees. Just an opinion. This sub sucks
---
Holup
---
Don’t speak for us cos you’re wrong, thanks.
---
I would love to play with you but although I've watched many guides I'm too afraid to ask people because I'd probably have no idea what I'd be doing the first time. also ironman around 87
---
Seems fine to me? Lmao... raging at someone for not being able to do crabs properly?
---
Being crappy and inefficient is pretty normal for lfr standard, but hey, raids are raids. Anyone who got their ass dragged thru mentor raids can join a standard.
---
with how this game is going, If they outright dont fix the main client but ban 3rd partys, im playin RS3 or dropping RS altogether.
---
[Absolute frauds](https://imgur.com/TOsaOn5)
---
To completely dismiss the competitive aspect of this game is interesting to say the least.
---
Any game with a free market will be competitive at its core, since competition dictates wealth, which tends to correlate with fun. And that’s not taking into account the more competitive aspects such as PvP and the like.
---
To take things back to the real world example:
---
If I’m playing football (soccer for the americans out there), for fun with my friends, I still don’t appreciate if someone cheats...even though the score itself doesn’t matter.
---
Hate both.
---
Bh. Pvp you’re going to get insta rushed, specced, and tab out. 
---
Bh is the same, but less frequent. Find a buddy to help you learn. 
---
My dms are always open to help.
---
Started going through all the standard minigames/unlocks on my 1.5-month-old account. Grinded out Graceful over the weekend, plan to get Auto-Weed tonight, and the Fighter Torso is up next... plus a little Wintertodt, here and there.
---
ty i'll try it out
---
NoFireGain? Yeah bud that's going to be a hard pass for me. If I can't use the fire altar for gains I'm out.
---
Id love to watch 24 people all do LMS with gba controllers
---
not even close to being efficient. just do your giant seaweed runs and get buckets of sand from the desert.
---
Did gnomes invent spirit trees? I thought they simply learned how grow them and to use them for transportation. In which quest-line does it say they were invented?
---
It's time! Remove all non-bis slayer helmets
---
They can be planted so the elves planted 1 lore solved
---
No company ever comments on the methods employed by it's anti-cheat systems. It would just be handing botters information on how to get around it.
---
People say that about RS3's MTX all the fucking time and they are still playing. It's the battered wife situation, at some point it becomes your fault as well for not leaving.
---
OSRS is doing that too, every major update or controversy is flooded with people who say *"If X happens i will quit"*, which is bullshit and never happens.
---
Jokes aside, this movie is going to RULE. Check out "Good Time" on Prime if you have it. The Safdie Brothers really know how to make it feel like you just did a line of coke for two hours straight.
---
If I lose my GPU renderer and draw distance I’m out. We played the game for the game 13 years ago and it was fine cos it was the best we had. That’s like having to downgrade to a nokia 3310 and living life like its 1998 in 2019. Just wouldn’t work this day in age. Same with the client. It WILL show its age and people will just leave.
---
Saves you a novel-long reddit post :D
---
Tell me where I was raging lol, they were afk with 3 crabs aggro'd.
---
Ya i only really mark safe spots or tilrs in nmz.
---
tbf konduit was actually legit at one point and was a nicer lightweight alternative to resource-hungry-ass osbuddy but neither can compete with runelite
---
If the task is in the Kalphite Cave go cannon the soldiers. if it's in the lair then i'd just do the workers.
---
Y’all complain too much lmao.
---
This isn’t sarcasm and this isn’t supposed to be toxic but are you new here lol. You should wait till these posts get popular and have a bunch of comments then read some of the fucked up justifications people try and give for plugins. 
---
One of the few legitimately QoL plugins in my opinion are ground item overlays, and stat boosts.
---
Finish str, then attack, then def. Str matters up to 99 for some setups, like melee vorkath. You can also do range nmz if you want, with a blowpipe if you are cool spending a lot of money, or msb(i) for cheaper xp. Use void if you are using a locator orb/rock cake consistently to stay low hp, or dhides for more afk time.
---
You can also skip def in nmz and do defensive barraging/bursting while doing slayer.
---
Or play mobile. To know my PC experience would be the regular client I'd much rather play mobile.
---
Jagex Support said they will give consequences out to those who did it
---
I would reccomend banking enough ores to finish the quest, if you chose to continue training mining (or just any gathering skill I'm general) I would reccomend dropping them to get faster Xp/hour. If you're on PC make sure to enable the Shift drop feature, in the settings, so you can quickly Shift click drop items in your inventory. If you're on Mobile you can hit the click option, the top menu option on the left side of the screen, so you can quickly tap drop. 
---
Welcome to OSRS by the way! You can add me Monkeycomnd2 and message me if you have any questions 😁
---
People say that all the fucking time, nobody believes them just as nobody believes the people who say they are quitting RS3 because of the MTX shit.
---
Define low level
---
did you just downvote me on your own post in an argument that is only going to be seen by you and me? 
---
...did that downvote make you feel better?
---
ikr
---
Some people have talked about this before. Either he'll upload 2 videos of the same thing, or 2 videos of half the quest, or say fuck it and just do 1 vid
---
it would require a LOT of work to prevent this kind of abuse. a SUBSTANTIAL addition throughout the whole game's code. Basically everything would have to be handled by the server, rather than the client. So, the servers, unless HEAVILY upgraded, would grind to a halt.
---
I stopped playing as much recently so maybe I’m biased anyway but even at my peak if RL was banned I’d definitely play less if not quit entirely. Some of the quality of life things are just necessities for me. It’s not 07 anymore where I didn’t know what I was missing
---
Get con up to 83, I assume you've got money from pking :)
---
bruuuuvvvvvv this is sweet
---
This winter, if you know what I mean.
---
Rough timeline:
---
1. OSB Releases client with cool plugins and even cooler plugins for a monthly fee
---
2. Other people release similar 3rd party clients offering the paid features from OSB for free
---
3. OSB mad that their monthly earnings are dropping because of #2
---
4. OSB attempts to shut down ALL 3rd party clients out of spite
---
I don't think any action has been implemented yet but they are making a fuss about it while not directly saying it's about money loss but it is.
---
Nerf blowpipe, fix death mechanics, add item sinks
---
Mods will reply to this but not incredibly broken REAL integrity issues presented by OSB
---
okokok.
---
It’s not Zuhaars
---
Inferno plugins? RL doesn't have any
---
obsidian + 5 super combats + locator orb + absorption
---
normal rumble count draynor, sand snake, me, khazard warlord, king roald, tree spirit and kendal
---
Yeah its pretty useful TBH, although I do feel a bit scummy about it. Its one of those things where you kind of feel like if the designers had known that it would be the meta, they would have made that be the left click option. But since it evolved over time, its still Bury.
---
Mod Ash hinted at this on twitter
---
Regardless of the 'rules' self defined by a community unaffiliated with the game other than that they spend a lot of time in it, their 'rules' are entirely ruining the game for another player. that's wrong on so many levels, especially since I disagree with how judgement was passed on OP.
---
Breaking a clan's rules should never result in not being able to play your favorite portion of the entire game.
---
It’s just so much nicer imo. Once you try the GPU and extra draw distance and anti aliasing you will see why I’m sucking its dick so hard lol.
---
What was the first?
---
Been using this method for a while, and it's great. As afk as it gets, but good exp rates still.
---
it’s a shiny !
---
Elite void, magic shortbow imbued, rune arrows
---
Runesink, eoc but with currency
---
Ahk in pking has gone unbanned for how long, jagex cannot detect mouse movements or any of the stuff mentioned here. the server sees 100% organic inputs.   The only way to stop this is ban all 3rd party clients
---
Ornate pool like something to chip away at.
---
Zenytes are good as well.
---
BGS is also a good choice.
---
Raises to the good mods, increase to customer support, and increased community involvement to even more than what we have now. 
---
And yeah, work on rs3.
---
"Hey, human being who helps run a huge discord for free, you need to get off your high horse! Who do you think you are, kicking people from YOUR discord for breaking YOUR rules, this man is ENTITLED to use your discord for his personal gain for free!"
---
The WDR mods/admins can kick anyone they want \*for no reason at all\* if they choose to, and no one has any right to say otherwise. They owe no one anything. They are not a business, nor a government, nor selling product. They offer free services and use of their discord. All that's on the line is their reputation and popularity of their discord, and it's doing fine. It's a hobby, not a job.
---
ah worse than i had hoped. thank you have a nice day
---
I know, I play on Linux and I use RuneLite. Yes it’s great and I love it but Jagex should make the vanilla client better and people should stop acting so entitled to 3rd party clients
---
Great channel, I think hes been somewhat inactive lately though :(
---
Due to it’s licensing they don’t have to buy it. They can just fork the source code and do with it as they please.
---
Got a link to that?
---
Giant mole
---
Barrows if you have morty hard with trident. Not really a boss but good money
---
Abyssal dagger is my dream drop bro... I just got the Red Slayer Helm (i)!
---
I would like this! I think they should add a senile old man/woman who will never recognize the player and kick them off. Funny, believable, and useful while not being a significant buff/nerf to anything.
---
not much - mole and barrows come to mind
---
or also the hill giant/moss giant bosses
---
Mole with falador hard
---
Your question has already been answered. Feel free to send me a message in game if you need anymore help.  
---
Rsn: Im Dustin
---
LOL
---
Can never have enough pets
---
Didn't jagex lick the boots of osb once
---
I would fist fight a bear
---
I don’t blame you for getting triggered when a casual says something stupid because they don’t understand or have enough time for a game but the shit you say and still try to say you’re a good guy is hilarious
---
Would there be some potential legal issues if they are taking an openly licensed projected and using it for profit?
---
People cry about easyscape but can’t play without clients. Smh
---
Classic is back baby!!!!
---
I mean like it's really fun to see the difference in drop worth. You know 20m=red=you freak out
---
I'm in the minority, but I really don't think we need any more polling than we already have in this game
---
ash literally said higher ups are discussing it. a junior dev that's been there for a month isnt a higher up
---
Universal Basic Income
---
I’d have to look at the specifics of its licensing again but I don’t believe so. Its essentially free and open to use as you see fit in just about any way
---
That’s quite the run from the portal! There is a pirate at the bank if you complete the lunar quest line who you can still bank with if you don’t have the seal on you. After you bank with him you can talk to any other banker, space bar through their dialogue, and they will tele you (kick you off) to just south of the docks. You should give it a try! It’s often how I get to relleka even when I’m not doing vork. It’s really quick and may speed up your trips.
---
THAT close to the GE? All the bots are going to spam them and tank their value on the first day! If *everyone* has bis then *nobody* has bis!
---
(This sub, probably /s)
---
Can we also get the tirannwn forest w/traps on the stepping stones from the GE agility shortcut? Seems like EZ scape with only a few dark mages and a few thousand stones
---
cheat client
---
People are scared of getting their accounts banned, but there is a plugin to instantly unban your account. Panic over boys.
---
and u a bitch ass shitter
---
????
---
we have a 52 inch 4k, so the client is super tiny, but add on to that im 5-7 feet away on my bed, and im constantly straining my eyes, like im not going to go blind playing a legacy mmo, lol. i fricken love this game, have spent a depressing about of time playing/ afking, but yeah, if i cant see, i cant play. simple as that
---
Lol that would be a good way to do it. I actually think Ash said something along the lines of "They're magic enough on that island that the elite diary could give you a teleport portal in the bank that takes you to where the kick does now" something along those lines
---
Guthans
---
Can you resize the window and then maximize it? Might force a repaint.
---
Name almost checks out - *'Ilikepickaxez'*.
---
Oh fuck, so I'm guessing Jagex is gonna step in and lay down the hammer on clients?
---
Happy cccake day phone
---
The reason its specifically being talked about today is they OSBuddy added a lot of OP functionality over the weekend. Summary here:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d87y3w/summary\_of\_the\_osbuddy\_updates\_that\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/d87y3w/summary_of_the_osbuddy_updates_that_are/)
---
I don't really care about the name, if i did i would have had it already.  
---
I would appreciate it if you gave it to me, but i don't really care about any extortion attempts.
---
There will always be jealous people in the world who dont like others having it better, but progression is good. It doesn't bother me if someone has an op plugin to train with, good luck to them. These clients make the game so much easier to play and nobody likes carpal tunnel.
---
Edit: I'm also really happy for you !
---
This is incredible, you've really nailed the original OS feel man!
---
flexing the rafs
---
I use them to make a square around vorkath that is max blowpipe range so the woox walking location is obvious.
---
&gt;things that still require 100% user input.
---
I mean...it literally doesn't require 100% of the user input though. For the altar example, you should have to right click the bone-&gt;move the mouse to use-&gt;left click use-&gt;move the mouse to the altar-&gt;left click that. Even if you ignore mouse movement as an action (you shouldn't) that means it takes 3 clicks to bury a bone. Now, it only takes 1 and no mouse movement. This is at best 33.3% of the user input, imo much less cuz mouse movement is subject to error making the whole process much tougher to do quickly.
---
Cheef kang feelswowman
---
It's support on the website and despite all the memes, it helped clear up an issue for me last year
---
I don't want to bring them out when my project is work in progress - I planned to tell them all once I have finished this, which I will this year.
---
But I can tell you that the improvements are ***very*** positive and every other week I keep track on several circumferences, weight, my physical performance progresses and my look. Not sure will I reveal the photos tho, but I will other progresses.
---
seriously, this statement puts it in perspective
---
What teleport spell/item brings you the closest to a fairy ring?
---
Right, damn. 
---
Thanks for the response
---
jagex has explicitly okayed reordering before (osbuddy had left click use on bones for example) so I could see them doing nothing, provided theyd have to rewrite detection code to address this.
---
jagex has refused to do anything meaningful in terms of stance on 3p clients historically. and dynamic blackjacking for example is not something detected as cheating and has been around for a loooong time now too.
---
Its not "being a leader" when its a random group of 4 people. In fact, I would say its more "being a leader" to take the initiative to take a vote between the people there to decide if you should kick the last player, in order to improve everyone's experience. But hey, call me crazy.
---
New region, new achievement diaries, reward is a swiss knife.
---
Yeah any drop above the threshold will appear red. Everything else will stay green in certain boss rooms
---
That’s not the plugin for left click blackjacking are u dense
---
proof?
---
I can agree with those two a bit. But I usually will only do them in small chunks so I don’t get too bored, or put on something to keep myself entertained, like some YouTube videos or something.
---
I did this after spending 7 hours on Elemental Workshop III in RuneScape 2. Did that damn quest without a guide.
---
99% chance no. Especially if you only used it for literally 4 minutes. It's not physically possible for them to tell you that were abusing this specific plug-in, so best they could do is ban everyone who uses OSB, which isn't going to happen.
---
Agreed
---
My cousin met his wife on WoW. He was 14 and she was 40. When he turned 18 he moved to Alaska and they got married. To no one's surprise, they got divorced a couple years later because she felt like she was taking care of him like she was his mom.
---
Advice to anyone: Join a clan and raid with them. WDR should be a last resort for finding team to do CoX with lol. A combination of randoms that pretend they know what they're doing when they don't makes for a bad time.
---
But if you click once and the client does something that would normally take 2+ inputs to do is this really still 100% user input? This isn't just the new osbuddy update but all menu swapping things at what point is it not 100% user input? If I use a manual input to start a bot program that does 100+ inputs wouldn't that still be 100% user input since I had to manually start it?
---
Luckily, Jagex isn't good enough at developing clients to be able to distinguish between all clients like that.
---
If they could, they would have done so to ban botting clients.
---
With all the osbuddy drama, what is/was ahk?
---
Virgin jmod smackdown vs chad WDR mod smackdown
---
I farmed 200 fremminik boots 4 so I can easily drop them when picking up Vorkath loot. It would be nice to have the Lunar isle bank rotation back though, its such a smooth rotation. Maybe if they add the ability to get kicked off Lunar isle after Fremminik Elites, the dialogue could be quicker, furthering the speed reward of doing the diaries?
---
Cool dude.
---
You know when MTX was first coming in rs2, people said the exact same thing you’re saying. “It doesn’t affect you, just don’t use it !”
---
Yeah take a look what happened. Sometimes a line has to be drawn for the longevity of the game. Game is grindy, always has been, but I think it should be Jagex and the community’s call through the system intended to be used, the polling system, to decide. Not some third party. “Just don’t use it” is a no-argument, it’s a compete cop out.
---
House tele (if you have a fairy ring in your house), quest Cape, ectophial, glory. Ordered from best to worst. Might be some other options I am forgetting.
---
There are examples of this in both OSB and Runelite before this update. Everybody who is starting to complain now is just a hypocrite. Either it was always cheating, or it was never cheating. It isn't suddenly cheating because it is now 4:1 instead of 3:1.
---
Lmao it takes 5 seconds. In-game settings, start button and type "mouse keys" , enable. Done. Instead of wasting these precious 5 seconds, you waited 2years for osb to release it and now it's god tier. Not to mentioned could have downloaded one of the multiple clients with this already.
---
You ok dude?
---
Just because you guys are seemingly stuck sunken cost fallacy addiction doesn't mean we're all as addicted as you are.
---
How did you guys manage to quit RS2/RS3 if you're that much of a runescape lifer?
---
Fishing is good. I got to 99 while at work
---
This is a game I play to unwind. It should not feel like a job.
---
People use 3rd party clients to make it feel like less of a pain in the ass.
---
How about not making it a pain in the ass in the first place?
---
You dont have to make it an afk-able game, just make it so it's friendlier for mobile and dont add microtransactions.
---
Do you know how annoying it is to left click on mobile?
---
Mobile will bring in a lot of money and players. It already has. I came back because of mobile.
---
Also, 13 million exp is already a huge thing to grind to. That is plenty rewarding.
---
To assume your skills are devalued because more people can get to 99 slightly quicker is selfish and toxic thinking.
---
Why do you think we all play the game? We all want those sweet capes!
---
There is no other reason besides getting GP, Killing bosses, and getting max stats.
---
You have been hacked
---
Thanks for the thoughtful response dude.  I wish I had you as my jedi master while I was a youngling rs player
---
You can still run it, but getting it configured can be a pain. Hope they don’t ban RL, works straight out the box on most Linux distros.
---
I'm gonna make a killing on my ring of wealth merch once this update passes
---
Honestly WHO CARES what client people use. IF YOU genuinely care about people using certain clients over you, get a life. WERE all playing a REBOOT game from our childhood. I dont even use any clients other than vanilla runelite. I dont have the time to get the astronomy degree required for hard clues. A majority of us dont play 6+ hours a day like the nerds that are actually upset about this. Im sorry that my clicks werent earned like yours as if someone actually cares. we are all around 25 years of age, lets not get carried away about something so stupid. Kick out clients you kick out a majority of the playerbase.
---
You can afk sand crabs for 10 minutes .. Smith cannonballs 2 min 30 seconds idk about fishing or woodcutting though
---
&gt; You already know none of features would pass. 
---
That's a very interesting concession, if I do say so myself.
---
Thats not even releveant to what i said. Leader of wdr, not leader of the random raid party. Why would a leader of a random raid party/op being looking through evidence or wondering if something is forged. 
---
OP went against the rules and is nagging about it. Its not worth the stress to oneself to unban him
---
Yea I really don't understand it.
---
Are all these "No one can quit! Too addicting!" people just people who found runescape after it went to mobile or something? Or did they literally forget that they themselves quit runescape once before.
---
Runelite is better in terms of features
---
I made a giant list of mine and others' favorite AFK training methods! Take a look! :)
---

---
It's broken down by skill, with some specifiying if its more AFK than others, or more to maximize xp/gp, etc! If you have any questions about it, let me know! :)
---
Auto hot key. It is a tool that allowed you to make scripts that could input mouse/keyboard commands. Some were innocent (change right mouse click to some button) others weren't (fletching darts with an infinite looping script that only required you to click and hold one button)
---
That's the problem, I can't join any clans because of this.
---
I just started getting back into OSRS the past few weeks after not playing since 2010. Could someone explain “pets” to me? I remember you could have a cat or a dog, but I’ve never seen an octopus before.
---
Lmaooooo OP real dumb
---
Literally told that if he didnt split he would be banned
---
And then once he gets banned he is like “wait no jk let me split instead”
---
Its possible, but its the only thing I can think of that would cause the ban. Im sure its possible my play behavior was wierd enough to get me flagged or something, but runelite is the only thing that is 3rd party, and could have any chance at causing a ban, so I assume its the issue.
---
You’re in the wrong here man. Very disappointing language and behavior for a Singh. Never too late to change and become a nicer person.
---
You can easily get 220k+ if you are good at blackjacking. Just takes clever screen manipulation, tons of attention and lots of practice
---
Wasn’t this posted a week ago?
---
Me too. “Stud fucks 5 babes”.
---
I’m the creepy looking guy jerking off while watching through a crack in the door.
---
Hooba hooba haaba haaba
---
Nah botted 99 str felt better knowing I didn't spend all my time getting it.
---
Mobile users will not be effect by this. Jagex is going to realize just how badly they need to shit out a new client. Ui scaling will probably be delayed.
---
You're allowed to rebind keys and use windows mouse keys still. Any other program is banned. You can still do things like bind mouse keys to QWER and spam them sequentially to quickly perform actions like crushing bird nests.
---
Oh man.. reading this makes me want to deiron my main account and start playing again
---
Brother there are a massive number of extremely casual raiders in wdr who spent 40 minutes in the raid and go slow. Wdr channels are like friend finders, you try to meet people who have similar goals as you to build a friendslist.
---
Ive raided in standard, there are some seriously slow players when it comes to rooms like crabs vangs vasa olm etc, but i go into lfr standard knowing that. Someone who does 150 super noob casual raids is going to still have 150 kc, kc is not an indicator of anything. 
---
Wdr explains which channels to use based on goals. You get a player like that in casual or adv/max eff, they will get strikes/reports for how they play.
---
What do you use ground markers for apart from multi in wildy and bosses lol
---
Karil's might be good to try since it will be a lot more tanky than void.
---
Thanks for your answer. Currently im getting 1-2 kill trips at vork with addy darts and no bgs. Seem te be making around 1.5-2m/h. Do you think bgs would improve this rate enough to justify the 9m investment? Can I use bgs at other places too? I feel like anguish/torture is a better investment because they have a wider range of use, but I don't know a lot about the games endgame stuff. Also, would you choose anguish over torture or other way around? 
---
I don't think I'm gonna invest the money into construction as of right now. The investment is too big for the small convenience I get out of it.
---
do all the f2p quests first
---
The p2w is the best part of the game, vote yes to MTX
---
This is why I will never be able to do raids. These OSRS clans are filled with man children who get such a fucking big head over their ounce of power and will kick/ban anyone they themselves don’t consider worthy. It’ll be cool for the first day but after a while they start not giving a fuck about you because you’re just a “random” to them.
---
I'll hack u
---
However I also believe that once you do get it, the telegrab glitch should not then be required to maintain it.
---
I wish they'd add more interactive training methods for multiple skills like PP, thieving seems to have the most what with PP and the minigames in zeah
---
People cheating is already a problem so that doesn’t change much. If jagex says “use anything but these clients and we will ban you” it would at least deter some people.
---
I’m not very literate in coding but couldn’t people make their client register as runelite anyway, even if it is probably more effort?*
---
Good call, thats a good benchmark to set.
---
for tweed
---
When I was stuck like you I tried pray range with antifire potion and antidragon shield, helped me alot personally. Also always keep eagle eye turned on
---
It's been crazy fun to experience this stuff again lol
---
no please, i was just kidding :(
---
why not run windows? why run linux?
---
Ooo ya. Whose gunna render a gilded one?
---
What are you saying?
---
adb is just tunnelled inputs over TLS? Or am I mistaken...
---
Hey congrats man that's great to hear!
---
&gt;5. Your name will have (REPAID) next to it on the ban-list and removed from the "scammers" list to the "toxic" list so the 3rd party clients will not falsely label you as a current scammer.
---
If this is true then I am very grateful, this was the only thing I was hoping to get by posting this. 
---
&gt;6. You should realize how much easier this would have been if you literally just muted the guy, put up with his shitty raiding and deaths, and then put him on ignore after the raid.
---
You're human, I know you understand that people don't always act rationally, especially when angry.
---
u put suggestion tag instead of humor mate
---
Well since you used your manners
---
Dude got banned for botting and is trying to make it look like osbuddy did it
---
so take 1 or 2 anti poisons (4) and drink 2 doses to remove the venom, make sure you have 3 forms of antifire (shield potion prayer)
---
on my Iron I took 1 super anti poison, 2 prayer pots a range and antifire pot, a diamond bolt switch runes for the spider in my rune pouch and the rest sharks.
---
I used full karils and a salve ammy ei, antifire shield, rcb.
---
you should only need to tank the range hits and what you take from your ruby e bolts
---
The only place I'd use it over a defender is Wyverns
---
fucking perfect
---
How do you make these? Do you just 3d model it in blender and try and match what old school restrictions might look like? It looks fun to design osrs armour
---
My mom could create these plugins and everyone would still hate them. And no one hates my mom
---
If you plan on raiding, you’ll probably need 75 for toxic staff for melee or rapier if you can afford.
---
75 is super enjoyable with all the options and If you’re going to be doing deeper wild pking you can still bully pures but also means you can get bullied by meds and zerkers.
---
I was banned this morning after "achieving" 99 construction with RuneLite's plugins... So I would say yes! Two-day ban is all.
---
Runelite should be fine. Osbuddy is the one that's getting shady and people are worried that they might cause jagex to ban all 3rd party clients. But you should be fine using runelite normally for the moment.
---
We ironically actually dont own that website. 
---
Weird, I know.
---
Support, I've done this at Vorkath a few times while turning off quick prayers. Isn't fun
---
That fits too well into the older art style.
---
You need to add big shoulder pads, a lot more spikes and shade the crap out of it.
---
Ooo yeah good call I want to finish 99 con
---
yep, and since it doesnt interact with the client it is completely undetectable, jagex said as much. they will never do anything about alt1 because of that, people bitching about clue solvers need to get over it because they will never go away
---
nope, this is what happens when you cheat.
---
Forgot the words "to memorize" an algorithm. It's not like a Rubik's cube, where you gotta memorize a 10-turn process or something for the final few blocks, because you just go line by line until the last 2 lines, where you do the left corner first, and then the other 5 remaining ones.
---
You can enable a force-override for mouse support as a developer setting within adb. Then launch the app normally and use your mouse. 
---
Alternatively you can have an overlay application that mirrors your mouse inputs to the screen as tap inputs. This requires permission to draw over other apps, which, again, you can force if need be.
---
No, but it's a little thing that you no longer have to worry about. You're simplifying the gameplay by *just little bit*, and by doing that too many times, you make a skill so much more accessible, it becomes trivial. It's not always bad, and I'm by no means a purist who wants xp rates to be set in stone, but at the same time every time you increase these rates you're making the skill just a bit cheaper. Runescape is an MMO, it's a competition by definition, and by evening the playing field too much you make it boring. It's not as fun when everyone's 99.
---
Its hard to tell without all the evidence,I just cant see him doing it again, which is the only reason to perma banBut he needs some sort of punishment so it wouldnt be encouraged. He already paid back, said sorry, slap him with two weeks and call it a done. In my eyes he is no worse than the flamer.  Now Ben has come out and it seems like he refused to split even when they straight up said he would have to. But even so I dont see the reasoning why this guy never being allowed to raid again, if he didnt get a drop nobody would care, but just since they happend to get lucky its somehow much worse. If we pretend there was no drop, it would be a group of guys all agreeing that someone toxic isnt worth having in their raid, even though they should have just muted him and they realise that now. If he actually was toxic then losing &lt;30min time is nothing to complain about, and now he even got his part of the split. TL:DR: people get heated and do dumb shit, I dont think there is any danger of him dipping with a split anymore
---
Great idea. noted.
---
I had no idea you could remove venom that way! I must have glanced it over in the wiki... Thanks!
---
Ironman mode, hello?
---
Best thing to do is finish all or the majority of the F2P quests and level up all your skills to at least 40 (excluding RC and member skills). This is a useful guide to follow: https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Quests/Free-to-play
---
But spending huge amounts of time pressing your finger against a piece of plastic consistently is the exact kinda stuff that will get you RSIs, doesn't make you fucking weak lmao
---
I guess go get a metal mouse or something if you want to feel like a big tough guy while you slowly destroy your hands the same way
---
I'm sure OSBuddy can make (or have made) a plugin for that.
---
We're talking about OSBuddy and the possibility that the new plugins they've been releasing will cause Jagex to ban all 3rd party clients (because they can't differentiate between them as of now), including RL.
---
In case it gets buried:

---
This guy isn't affiliated with RL - he just uses my name and a similar logo to confuse people and gain trust.
---
They don't need to ban everyone using it, all they need to do is temp some of the biggest abusers of the plugins (assuming they actually do have the means of detecting it) and once the word of those bans spreads around it'll dissuade the good majority of others from using them.
---
I might give that a try!
---
I was getting 220k-250k the other day, it’s definitely possible but god is it fucking painful.
---
What thieving level do you need for those?
---
If you think Reddit is so trash why do you spend so much time here
---
Seriously, if you're actively not having a good time and are just getting upset and pissed off you should stop. It doesn't matter what it is, that's not something you should have in your life. It's very unhealthy.

Gzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!

It helps with end game bosses

Reset your password, hopefully you used a real email. Then all will be good, most likely mistaken your password for another constant you use for other things...

Waterfox came into being when Firefox didn't have x86_64 support.

You go girl! You show that Mole whos the biggest, meanest underground-dweller around!

“If someone comes I’ll just spam tele and be invincible” solid plan the first 15 seconds
---
Imagine thinking mods are there only to ban you and not to help you. Just like the police eh?
---
It's not entirely open source, some parts of the project like the deobfuscator were made private when Jagex were demanding they shut down back in like March or April 2018.
---
I mean you’d know more than I would. Idk if you’re serious and tin hat what if you’re lying! But it would be cool to see something explaining where or how it’s safe besides a blanket “open source” statement. Not that I’m worried I’m more curious and surprised nobody’s laid something out for us casuals to understand.
---
Draw distance, is that how big i can see the world? Either way, what shluld I set it at?
---
Looks like this whole third client shit was rigged from the start.
---
Clues are movement puzzles for me. How do I travel to the place I need to be, what should I have in my inventory at all times, what gets left behind for being too niche, etc. I find that kind of gameplay fun.
---
And thanks!
---
Runelite has always cooperated with jagex and removed any plugins that jagex didnt like.
---
All jagex needs to do is ban clients other than runelite. It worked for ahk. Sure some ppl still use ahk for things other than remapping keys, but most people dont wanna risk their account and wont do it. Same thing will happen here, but other 3rd party clients will die out when not enough people use them because of all the upkeep needed, and everyone will stick to runelite which actually listens to jagex.
---
Yhh boi mem is wavy, just don’t buy it by gp 5.3 is a bit when u starting.
---
I dont approve of the pluginz but you, OP, seem to be an asshat a size too large.
---
we dont want people like you who came back because of mobile and will inevitably move on to the next game in a few months coming in and demanding all these changes. what you are asking for is a huge reason the main game died so no thanks
---
Kids geeking out? Mate I doubt youre much older than the average playing age of the player base at this point.
---
Best content I’ve ever seen.

I think I might just do the 10hp pure. For some reason I always found level-3 skillers to be more impressive, but for the sake of my sanity I might stick with 10hp pure.
---
&gt;it's definitely not a shitty discord, the people who have had bad experiences with it tend to deserve it.
---
Sounds like a shitty discord to me, with shitty people in it. Wow!
---
Sorry didnt mean "kids" like 12 year olds.
---
OSRS was released in 2013; 3rd party clients appeared much before that.
---
Why not run Mac OS? Why run Windows?
---
It's preference. I use Linux on all my machines and prefer it that way. There are many, many things I do not like about Windows.
---
well yeah hopefully, but the fact that other cheat clients seem to have nonexistent ban rates worries me
---
RuneLite does this but since RuneLite is open source other people have made their own forks with the features back in.
---
Alright that's what I think I am going to do. I'll level up some skills keeping it level-3 before moving unto magic for teleports and whatnot. This is a really casual account to afk on while I level my main anyway.
---
Only had one when I went to go change it
---
28k+ members. so yeah. there are definitely some shitty people in it, but there are also a lot of shitty people who play osrs. that's yknow, part of the thing that happens when you run an open discord, anyone can join said open discord.
---
done like 2000 cox, 700 tob -&gt; a good 8-12b in raids over like 1.5 yrs with people i met plus a  decent number of pickup raids. only ran into issues with a handful of people.
---
Then do it?
---
If not then stfu
---
He’s really a boomer...
---
Barbarians, they atm you - leave room when they stop then jump worlds. Best way to AFK combat. Make sure they aint to high to smash through your def n not too low that it’s a k.o.  The Giant spiders hit you no matter what lvl you are. Probably be harder if a pure...
---
Social engineering does exist but to go to that extent is kinda excessive.
---
It is. The maximum seems to be 71. I use 45 but you can max it if you’re on an ok PC. Anti aliasing is pretty self explanatory and the animation smoothing makes everything look less clunky.
---
I mean anything is possible, but it’s not common for open source software to have malicious code. A lot of people have eyes on it. And every change is visible in the commit.
---
Yeah, you're in the middle of a circle, and the higher the draw distance the bigger the circle.  I think the max is 90, it depends what your GPU can take.
---
death grips said no
---
&gt;yay
---
I use arch, btw.
---
Kidding... kind of (Manjaro btw). I remember having to use rsu-client back in the day for RS3/EoC. It worked, but it had issues loading textures and with the cursor. I'd be a little upset if 3rd party clients were banned not only because the official client is god awful, but also because I'd be getting a subpar experience.
