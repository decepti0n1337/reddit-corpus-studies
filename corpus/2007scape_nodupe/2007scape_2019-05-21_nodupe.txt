What prevents the bot client from calling itself RuneLite? All information that the server knows about the client comes from the client itself. Jagex would have to add some kind of DRM to the client to make it difficult for botters to modify, but it's probably even harder than just banning bots normally.
---
---
---
You do in large swathes of America
---
Yeah the Venezuelan farmer hysteria had begun around only 2 years ago. Before that there were plenty of bots, as well as Chinese farmers.

Pretty sure the occult necklace is just better than that set effect.

How does it "fuck the economy"? Sure it devalues skilling as a source of resources, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is any negative consequences in the long term.
---
I'm just sad that d pick is hard af to get on my iron
---
I think '07 reddit' was good, 'osrs fb' is popular too. Dunno many others
---
Definitely not. It's a phish.
---
I didn't mention anything about a phone number. I don't think the right way to go about it is to limit accounts. It's a very hard situation they're in where they're trying to deal with bots, but have to value real players experience more then trying to put a heavy anti-bot system in place that annoys/falsely bans people
---
Easy solution: grind hard clues to get the full set and free up the inventory space.
---
You’re kidding right?
---
Do you how little value GP has when alchables flood the game?? Do you see just how worthless resources are now?
---
I don't know if that would be so hard, they could just ban 3rd party clients and work with RuneLite to add some features.
---
I mean, even most video games you can't play online if you haven't bought it.

&gt; I'm mad cause I'm bad and I don't have enough confidence in myself or my abilities to try to learn something that I'm unfamiliar with.
---
Just make a pure alt and spend mils dying not learning much each death, among mechanics that can freeze you in place, teleblock you, while a clan piles on in multi
---
I'm not opposed to learning but I feel like the only thing I'm losing out on is an incredibly obscure looking pvp system I'll stack L's in and lose hours of progres with against people who unironically finds runescape pvp interesting and have been with it for years
---
I like doing PVP in a lot of other games, runescape is just the one I've never really felt it with due to how bullshit and weird it seems. I've watched probably 6 hours on and off with various streams and barely learn anything from just watching.
---
&gt;You don't even have to fight back. You can just try escaping and eating food.
---
"Then fight back, you invertebrate." is what I was responding to
---
It's a very 4Head thing to tell people unfamiliar with PVP.
---
For real. Unironically tell me PVP is learnable to a "you lose only 50% of the time" level in even under a month in the current climate.
---
Know anyone in either of these chats? Probably more the reddit one, since I frequent the site. xD I wish you could just join via the chat name ,not a player.

Oh hey I got mine a bit ago last week.
---
Yeah lol, I was wondering what you thought the stronghold had to do with anything. Where’d you think you got em haha
---
i personally dont mind getting jumped in wild, i dont bring risk so it doesnt affect me personally, just a loss of like 2 minutes

Wel all know how this goes... see you back on in 4 days.

Whatever seems fun
---
what’s your TTL? and yeah you’ll get there.

Its easily possible. Just runecraft lol. You may not get the best possible rates buts its possible. There are level 3 f2p ironmen that got 70 and up RC only using air runes lol

25% chance to increase damage by 30% would be worse than just the flat 10% boost that Occult gives. So hnkess you're an Ironman and don't have access to occult at your Slayer level, I'm not sure why this would be used.

Well this is only gonna be held at clan wars. No risk involved. Most people in my clan have a toxic staff and not a regular staff of dead so  they can't use their toxic staff but cant charge it with scales.

Yeah, I meant something a bit more specific.  Like the decypher puzzle in the X marks the spot quest.  I went looking for a hint and all I saw were places literally just telling me where to go.  I eventually figured out how to solve it the correct way, but I wanted to see if there was anything like what I was asking for.  Doesn't hurt to ask.
---
This post is so funny to me 😂😂
---
No I was saying with you nerd, lessss goo lol after my angler outfit grind
---
Obviously u cant use dragon bolts with a rune cbow lol but if you happen to choose an armadyl crossbow as your +1 you cant use onyx dragon bolts
---
You'd still have to get it from the gauntlet. Which should be rather difficult, just like any other endgame gear source
---
And you will still be able to buy it right? So you just don't want to put in the time to improve your account and finish the quests. Play RS3
---
I am Dutch yes :)
---
There's some content that never should've been in the wild to begin with. Like black salamanders and the agility course. No one risks anything doing those. Same with clues honestly. Clues are such a bad money maker why did they make them worse by putting them in the wild.
---
Maybe have something similar to Agility shortcuts but instead you have to burn your way through them?
---
Or make a weapon that is similar to the Handcannon in RS3 that Firemaking improves the use of
---
Could have an additive to logs like what the Firelighters are that give slightly more XP and turn into special ashes that can then be used to make something in Herblore or another skill
---
Also, higher tier logs should burn for longer than the lower tier ones.
---
You should use Reddit less.

Add me sometime. My usernames Rodnino. I'm having the same issues and its driving me away from the game man :(. Hesitant about renewing my membership today :/

The column of non +1s mean that those items are freebies and are allowed and are not considered as a +1.

Uhh it actually affect my tele grab then low alch only uim locked in the lumbridge swamp
---
There was a post exactly like this 2 years (roughly) ago where some friends were staking and traded gold over. Jagex admitted it was a false positive and unbanned then both.
---
With runelite tele room is tedious but a joke.
---
Alch room is never not shit
---
Would tell you my username but I don't want to be hacked
---
You should probably change your password.
---
Use the quick guide on the wiki. If you're an experienced player, it's a quick guide. If you're new to most of the quests, it's a guide which is a bit harder to follow.
---
Lol I made it in 07 when rs3 was osrs
---
Can we instead make it so if you'd roll a Torch or Gloves when you already own them, it gives Pyromancer instead... Then after you have full Pyromancer it could go back to giving duplicates/seeds for the others. I'd say those drop rates are more of a problem than action interruption when a boss hits you.
---
I got Dharok Helm on my first chest and Karil top on my 3rd chest... not a single item since and I'm around 100kc. Always kill 6 brothers and have mory hard done so at least I make some decent money off runes.
---
Just did thank you!

I usually don't enjoy the crab memes but this one is good!

I think that would be a great idea for a new skill! We could call it summoning and being a higher level could allow you to use better Pokémon!

You def keep your progress lol no matter where you log in from. Check out the top comment, its probably something to do with logging in via google or whatever. But yeah accounts on osrs are not bound via one main account. Each account is separate, its own entity
---
add sitrus berries to farming skill as well plz
---
L0l they should have tried that on my ptsd ridden ass i would have just stabbed the fuckee
---
Isn't that enabled by default?
---
First time someone said "Unpopular opinion" and actually have it be unpopular. 
---
They are breaking the rules, simple as. I couldn't give less of a fuck what their reason is. Jagex is banning them for RWT/Botting and they can make new accounts but those will be banned too.
---
I misclicked on infinity gloves like a total brainlet, too. So after grinding out Master Wand and Mage's Book, my dumb ass had to grind out more points for the boots
---
Good internet
---
Banning bots also makes legit players want to play. Tons of people quit because they have to grind while some people just bot. Why get into a game if all around you is a bunch of goldfarmer bots and you have no idea if p2p is any better?
---
Would it have let me use the exact same username?
---
Was pretty much my first thoughts... they put a lot of effort into the WoW version, and in the end, it was still just a niche update that 1% of the playerbase actually uses. 
---
Limited reward, time consuming, waste of development time.
---
That's a good point, but the game the ad tries to sell you is more manipulative than the ad itself. Some people may be interested in a mobile mmo with pvp and collectible characters, and as such they would download shadow legends. However, if the game itself is manipulative and gets kids addicted and spending massive amounts on mtx, then every youtuber that promoted their game is complicit in the business practices used in that game.
---
Yep
---
Can’t wait looks like an interesting one!
---
I don't think it's so much a straight path line as it is an arrow in the corner of your minimap.

Official Runescape Forums has a pretty active clan section (look in the OSRS sub-forum).
---
When I read that jagex statement it sounded more like a PR statement. We're doing everything by the books and making sure we don't do anything stupid sorta statement. AS for hacking that doesn't really exist as it's just submitting a recovery request instead of breaking into a system.
---
Yet I do every task i can in catacombs and I run out of arclight charges fucking constantly. And i literally use arclight only for skotizo, and demonic gorillas. Use on abbys if i got charges sometimes.

Lost city is pretty straightforward. Once you have the skill reqs, the only thing that'd make it difficult is if you don't hit against the tree spirit with magic, but since you have protect from melee/prayer potions potentially, you can basically do it atm.
---
Once you unlock the fairy ring network, you get like 90% of them. Only a few have some conditional requirements (like needing to buy access one to Zeah or visit Miscellania for Miscellania's ring). It's pretty worth it though getting the transport network though, so the prereqs are worth doing.

Just incase people haven't ever done chaos altar before, there's no risk. You only bring 28 bones, you teleport steps away with the Burning Amulet and suicide to the boss nearby. It's over 200k xp/hr with wyrm bones and you get pked so infrequently and for so little risk, by flicking prayers and praying, pkers can actually increase your xp/hr by making banking faster.
---
I think a lot of wilderness content has shaky design, but the chaos altar has always stood out to me as particularly egregious.
---
When I had to remove my authenticator I was sent an email i had to respond to. Im not an expert in this cus I've only done it once, but maybe your email is compromised? Might be a bigger issue than what you origanally thought? Idk man. Best of luck.

It can only point in a straight line though. If someone is in al kharid and wants to walk to corsair cove, they're just gonna walk into a fence if they followed the arrow.

iirc RWT stands for Real World Trade. It's against the rules to trade realworld items or money for ingame items. Doing this gets you banned, and jagex has a sort of system in place to detect if players obtain obscene amounts of gold through drops/trades from other players. 
---
OP claims that his account was banned because of a RWT trigger. The system believes OP got "too much" free gold from somebody for nothing in return, so the system banned him on the grounds of him trading real world items for in game items.
---
3K

Cheating isnt?

I've been real world trading bills and bills for years and never been banned

I did fletching up to 85 fming but I am enjoying Todt more just by simply burning the logs. I still average around 600 points a game.

You're calling people brainlets lmfao? The irony.

Yeah, but is green armor better than red armor?
---
They’re gonna go up because of the update and upgraded crystal chest lolol
---
It's important to make a distinction.  In a criminal court case, Jagex's TOS doesn't mean anything.  It's the government/people vs accused, maybe UK is different than US though.
---
Jagex saying the gp has no value or it's their property does not mean an individual represented by the prosecution did not suffer criminal damages.
---
The upper section(needs 72 mining and 200 nuggets) has veins of ore that last much longer than the ground level. It gets much more afk when you unlock it
---
If they did, servers like pkhonor and soulplit, which have been around longer than 07, wouldn’t still be around.
---
I'm glad you got it back.  I'll admit I was really scared my account was gone forever but now I have full confidence in Jagex lol. Also my account was in the same spot I left it when I logged out,those bot guys are good at what they do. I didnt get anything free, your lucky lol. Well back to chopping logs for bonds :p
---
My most ridiculous mute was asking this guy named collinturner if he was the Collin turner I knew who lived down the street from me (we were kids who hung out) and someone immediately reported me for a week ban

Sitting at 70 agility, need to get my boots still lol.
---
I had not played OSRS for close to 6 months when I decided to hop on last week. I discovered my account had been banned for macroing in March. I appealed the ban and won. Changed all the security settings. 2fa, rotating password, new PIN, the whole nine yards.
---
Here's the thing...
---
I was lvl 49 when I left with about 450k in the bank on a free account. I hadn't even done Dragon Slayer yet.
---
I log on, I'm lvl 84 I have an abyssal whip, 250 green dhides, 300 dragon bones. There is not a gold piece left in the bank but the items alone are worth triple what I had before.
---
I'm just confused. Why go through all that work, get the account banned, not appeal, and just leave it? The password hadn't even been changed on the account.
---
Cant make any money effectively until 75 magic really. I'd personally just splash to 75

---
The game design philosophy you're talking about is what made this game popular in the first place. the danger of getting killed by other players was used to justify the rewards of the wild. maybe its just outdated and the wildy just isn't as popular anymore (i mostly blame jagex for this) but people forget the primary reason the server was even voted to be opened was pvpers and specifically the wilderness.
---
&gt;OSRS's poll system
---
my hot take has always been polling was a mistake. its fun voting no for 95% of updates i guess but honestly if pvp got even half the attention and effort skilling and pvm has gotten from jagex it would be in a much better spot polling system or not.
---
I just want nex

Thanks a lot, splashing what? my bank is like 2m so im poor but fire strike seems to be way too slow
---
I’m losing my shit? When?

I was so disappointed when I came back and everyone at the duel arena was staking. I used to spend so much time there back in the day just funning people on a zerker.
---
it leaves that Achilles heel open
---
Damnit. Actually dyslexic.. thought the M was W
---
If you're going to get higher agility in the future (70+) then it's better to do wildy course from 47-60
---
No it's not!!! An argument is whatever I want it to be!!!
---
The problem with wildy is the people who have only pked since the original games release. You literally stand no chance against some of these people. 
---
That and learning all the best load outs, finding a good PvP group that will show you. Then you have people doing cheap things for easy kills that you would otherwise never find out on your own. You can learn it as a new player but your gonna lose a ton of cash and get clapped countless times
---
i care
---
Dota has Pokemon?
---
tbh I thought that was a fruit roll-up at first
---
works fine on mine
---
If you still need this i dont mind helping out in like 20, pm me
---
I had a similar opinion in the original post and I've been thinking about it more since then. Gaming at the time when I started (2004) was a bit different. RPGs like Morrowind were popular and were extremely open world. As the 2000s progressed, games like Fallout 3 and Oblivion threw the exploration out the window and implemented waypoints with fast travel. Now, almost all games implement similar features, and gamers are likely used to being told what to do. Especially younger gamers that have grown up with the waypoint system.
---
I want to see this game grow and thrive, but I'm cautiously worried about bringing people into the game who expected a more streamlined experience. If they do end up sticking around and vote in the content polls to continue to streamline the game, it would ruin my experience and cause me to turn away from this great game. I'd really like to see the internal Jagex data that shows why new players are quitting the game specifically.
---
dogshit analogy how is this front page
---
no ones making you do clues, revs, wildy agility, wildy bosses, etc.  If you want to do MA and MA2, then cool, just do it and get it over with and dont bitch about it.  I've gotten maybe like 25 capes without getting pked.  you're risking about 100k if you do die.  if you want to bitch about 100k then it's honestly a personal problem.  if you die more than once, it's definitely a personal problem.

Wizard 101 gameplay was surprisingly solid for a game designed solely to make kids beg their parents for the P2W MTX.
---
I'm pretty sure the stronghold of player safety doors or whatever had a question exactly like this that told you to log out even if you're leaving just for a minute and there's someone else in your room
---
Let me preface this by saying I have severe anxiety issues. 
---
I've spent two weeks fretting over MA2 cape, waiting until I could be on at 4am in order to attempt it, only to sit staring at the login screen. The fear of being PKd is absolutely paralysing.
---
I used to play back in 2002-2005, and hated the wilderness for much the same reason. I never even got the MA1 cape back then, purely because of how scared I was.
---
Since starting again a few months ago, about half of my clues have had Wilderness steps, roughly 5 or so. So far, I have been killed on three of those.  
---
I didn't lose anything since I 3 itemed with a clue box, but that's beside the point. This was not fun, this was not risky, it was just stressful.  
---
Of the three other times I went (Ghostly robes, MA1 cape, Easy diary), I was attacked twice and killed once doing the diary. I didn't mind as much when doing the diary since it is not exactly relevant for someone not using the Wildy, but herein lies the issue in my eyes, and why PvMers dislike it.
---
The issue that I have with the Wilderness has nothing to do with risk/reward, and everything to do with exclucivity.
---
Let's take the Dragon Pickaxe as an example. It's a worthwhile risk to go into the wilderness and kill the bosses, because they have a drop that is both useful and valuable. This is good, since it keeps the content relevant.  
---
Now, say we add another boss outside of the wildy that can drop the pickaxe. Suddenly it's pointless doing the wilderness bosses, because it's a much, much better option to simply do the other source.  
---
However, let's say we instead add a boss that has 1/5 or so of the chance to drop it compared to the wildy. Now, you can start asking yourself the question, is the wildy worth the risk? (For this argument I'm not going to include the KBD, since he is fundamentally in the wilderness and the entrance to there is popular for PKing)
---
The trick here is making sure the balance between a non-wildy source and a wildy source is worthwhile. I'm of the opinion that no non-PvP items or content should be exclusive to the wilderness, the key word being exclusive.  
---
If it took me 10 hours to do something outside of the wilderness that would only take an hour within, that makes the wilderness a viable risk. The time saved would outweigh the risk and loss of being killed, but if I don't want to risk it then there is an option.
---
________
---
An option i feel could work could be an anti-skull, or halo. Instead of succumbing to the darkness of Zamorak, instead you imbue yourself with Sara's light or some shit for 20 minutes.  
---
Consider how the revs work at present, where being skulled improves the drop table. Imagine something opposite to this, where you're unable to be attacked but in doing so drop rates are increased by an order of magnitude. You're safe to engage in the content, but the price for that is a substantially lower viability.
---
Obviously, there are some things that would still require the risk.  
---
Have it so that in having the halo, Zamorak doesn't like your bones and the chaos altar is unusable.  
---
Make it so that the fountain of rune doesn't resonate well with someone who's alignment is not balanced or something, so you don't get the infinite runes and each charged glory/ring requires an individual click with a slower animation lock.  
---
Make Krystilia unimpressed by your efforts if you kill something on task with the halo so it doesn't count, similar to a Konar mob in the wrong place.  
---
Make it impossible to enter the Rev caves since it's a place of death or something, since their four unique drops are all fundamentally PvP items. Maybe make these items lose their passives if you've got the halo too.  
---
Make black chins dazzled by your holy radiance or something dumb so that their catch rate is substantially reduced to the point where it's more viable to just go and do red chins in both GP and XP.  
---
And finally, make everything extremely aggressive. It still has to be at least somewhat dangerous.
---
The point is to make the wilderness usable with the halo, but not worthwhile. Very few people would bother to do most of the viable wilderness activities with it active, but for the PvM content that exists there, people who have no interest in engaging in PvP can still participate.

When you say "old account", you're referring to pre 2016 and osrs release, right?

Everyone started from scratch, many of us keeping the "same" account which is linked to what is now rs3, which is where your progress is.

Yup. Every 20 minutes you repot super combat, reabsorb, ezpz.

I think this happened to me too, but I was clicking too fast to see the final message and clicked out of it instead of reading it and continuing. What was the last display you completed?

jagex needs to stop basing pvm around the drop tables, i want them to come forwards one day and just tell us we are getting a new duo boss, or small team boss, with shitty loots and 2 or 3 big rare items.

Plus i swear to fuck if they make one more range-focused boss... im fucking 43mil ranged exp and not even 99 melee stats! stop making everything blowpipe tbow, what ever happened to "immune to style of attack"?

Hadn't thought about it from an overall efficiency standpoint, I need to keep that in mind for the future. I'll chew on this for a bit, might decide to buy one sooner than I originally thought. Thanks for the response!

I prefer having a game where people get punished for making mistakes rather than being able to bring BIS to every boss and never have the equipment leave the economy.
---
I played when booters worked at GWD and while it sucked stability has come in leaps and bounds since. The band aid solution which was promised to be just that has massively overstayed its welcome and was unpolled. I'd bet that there are pvmers nowadays who started their accounts after the "solution". 
---
I guess you prefer bosses being braindead simple to gear for and kill. Having to protect item and having interesting risk:reward to consider for gear choices is a mechanic basically completely lost everywhere but in the wildy and I really think that's a shame.

I offer you advice as someone who has been meleeing Vork since he came out and you can't look past a joke in my comment?

I feel so bad not being able to figure out Zulrah. Grats on the drops/gains bro.

Hasta/spectral switch or rapier if you can afford. Everything else you've said looks fine.
---
Nmz is a single click every 10 minutes lol rune dragons is far from that.
---
where were you guys when these QOL things came out like 3-4 months ago and they were talked about often?
---
if you read the notes it says it's only recommend to use the spectral during the souls part of the fight. but it also ranks bludgeon higher than hasta on the effectiveness list. so yes you should bring all three and switch to hasta and spectral during the phase that drains prayer

Not true. Pugger covered this in one of his bot busting videos. Between bots, venezuleans, and others, they buy a 7-day membership for like a dollar off of some website offering a special deal for OSRS membership. They've also utilized mobile free 7 day members.
---
Sure thing you do buddy. What do you want to bet you work either fast food or retail? Nothing wrong with that but when you’re lying about making money, it’s pretty fucking pathetic and embarrassing. My experience with people bragging about their income is most of the time they’re dead broke. Anyones whose has enough money doesn’t give a shit about spending $20 to support content they enjoy. 
---
I spend hundreds of dollars on Bill Burr comedy shows because I have more than enough money to do so extremely comfortably and it’s entertaining. If you’re throwing a fit about someone spending $20 for entertainment you obviously have no amount of wealth whatsoever, so quit lying. 
---
Also, bashing Bernie is hilarious. The one politician who wants to help 99% of this country not die because they can’t afford cancer treatment or go bankrupt. Also help people go through University without accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Thankfully I already got my degree from a top university with no expenses and was able to study and focus on school comfortably. 
---
Imagine dying in a first world country because you can’t afford healthcare. There are third world countries with better healthcare than the US. The place is barbaric, people losing their kids and family to cancer because they can’t afford it, it’s pathetic.

Can’t afford rapier unfortunately. So should I bring my bludgeon alongside that?

Damn man I feel you on this, I've always wondered if I'd get banned for lending IRL friends that have started playing big ticket items like the tbow, maybe I should hold off until they're on my friends list for a longer period of time or something.
---
Friend of mine wanted to play ironman with me, but im about 2 months ahead in progress so he decides to buy an ironman account with roughly the same stats as mine. cost him a bit, but in my eyes jagex get membership money, he gets a fun account to play and venezuelans get food on the table.
---
all well and good until 3 days later when the account got hacked back even with an authenticator and email changed etc. I mean, the seller had literally hundreds of accounts farmed and for sale, the price was fair and everyone should of been happy, but nope they got greedy and decided to steal, so fuck them for that.
---
all the green dragon bots on every world making it annoying to kill some dragons, fuck them.
---
but on the other side i shed a tear to whats happening over there, and i'd probably be doing the same if i was in their positions. wow my emotions are all over the place, fuck them but good on them.
---
Thanks mate, that’s what I wanted to make sure of. I read the notes, I wasn’t understand if it recommended just bringing the spectral without the hasta which is why I posted.
---
Damn man that sucks hard, lost the tbow and your friend losing his account
---
what were you gonna do? punch cerb when you use your spectral? :p

I had not logged into osrs in around a year and when I did try log in I had been banned for macroing back in December. I sent in an appeal and am no longer banned. Someone had hacked my account and boted on it. My account was a pure with 99 STR, Range, and 50 attack. After I logged on I discovered that the person who had hacked my account had cleared my bank and got my Defense lvl to 40... I know that I will not get any of my supplies or gp back, and that is understandable. Is there any chance that Jagex will rollback my stats? At this point that account is ruined for me, loved and spend a lot of hours making that pure. Just wish they would put the defense back to 1. Thanks for any help
---
Spoiler?
---
You okay? Did sparcy take all your money. Also calm down on that fanboy shit, cause to the untrained eye that looks like lag.

Just kill more dragons and use house altar.

You'll need the other supplies from Hydra/Vorkath/Rune drags/Addy drags and so on.
---
Got 99, I'm coming in!

its not lag, thats just how game ticks work. your attack option only updates every tick...?

theres legit 0 point to use ahk to stake.

---
You don't need any of those to Max. Why even have a wilderness if you people just want to have everything risk free? And you guys always exaggerate how often people are out there pking you. I've been to the wildy plenty of times and seen absolutely no one.

Compare it to making some kind of art whether it's a model or anything else and even if everyone else hates it and it means nothing to them you still put in a ton of work making it. Now picture you having a ton of these all over and someone that was your "friend" came and smashed your entire collection which took thousands of hours to make, that's pretty fucked up.
---
While I don't know how Jmods would tweak it, I'd imagine they'd present it similarly to how TOB loots are rolled but without the MVP perhaps.
---
Hornwood helm. Holiday item, you can get it from Diango in draynor.
---
&gt; I don't like the risk vs. reward concept of the wildy in application.
---
uhhh what do you mean "in application", theres no difference in theory vs application. I think youve just been conditioned to expect 0 risk for everything you do in PVM in 2019 that there actually being some real risk in the wilderness(and lets be real my guy...the wilderness is dead AF so what exactly are you complaining about again?) causes you to think that youre being "wronged" somehow by having to go into it. Jagex really screwed up completely removing death mechanics and making the worst punishment for dying being 100k @ Vork and TOB, and then making Wildy bosses not really even worth doing GP/hr wise compared to things like Vork+raids etc. on top of having much more risk.
---
&gt; stuff like luring, using a book to stall lure, and skull tricking should be bannable/removed because legit PvPers never use these tactics and they just make people afraid to ever attack players. 
---
So if youre in the dangerous PvP area called the wilderness and a team lures you into multi somehow....they should be BANNED? Not sure if youre even being serious? 
---
Book stall is in PvP worlds and has nothing to do with the wilderness so not sure why youre mentioning it but yes the mechanic should be fixed but Jagex cant help the fact some people are so naive/stupid they get themselves into the situation where it can be used on them in the first place. Remember there are MULTIPLE warnings about logging into PvP worlds and about trading in PvP worlds/the wilderness, its 100% on yourself if you get lured in a PvP world.
---
And skull tricking=ban too? I mean how are you even being serious right now? Youre in the wilderness, anything goes. If you skull because some people are cleverly using the games mechanics and your own lack of experience/knowledge in PvP and they arent abusing a bug or something then what is the issue? You seemingly just want Jagex to ban people because there are some incredibly naive/stupid people out there. Well guess what? That wont stop those stupid people from continuing to be stupid and Jagex has never nor will ever seriously ban people for luring.
---
And apparently youre not a "legit" pker if youve ever skulltricked someone....LOL? You realize a ton of really good pkers have done or do some sort of skull trick all the time especially if its just a PvMer in a lot of good gear tht they randomly see out there and had no intention of skull tricking going in. Theres nothing with that at all, you sound like you just want players to be coddled as hard as possible and remove as much risk as possible in the game so that it can just be nearly 100% reward.
---
&gt; into "you're pretty much guaranteed to die as a solo player eventually from a clan piling you, also don't bring a +1 unless you camp like 50 HP or else you might get Ancient Maced with no counterplay
---
The only valid thing you said here is getting Ancient Maced (which they "fixed") which I think is just a stupid weapon although it takes a ton of peopl and coordination to pull off. There is a counterplay however, bring someone you can suicide with.
---
Thanks for the answer, I appreciate it.

So not having 91+ slayer makes you a NMZ prod?

Hopefully these handouts don't affect the beginner adventures

Because when you're at Venenatis and you get smited (or don't have protect item on), the flial is what you will lose. So some dupes are always nice.
---
Verac's good against wildy bosses. Flail's the cheapest item of the set, so if/when you get smited in the wilderness you going to lose the flail.
---
i had this for Zulrah pet on 1790 kc. Teleport to house and it wasnt following me anymore. panic relogged because i tought it as a bug and as i logged in it was there again. my heart skipped a few beats lmao

Spoiler tag would have been nice u fucking dingus
---
Loads of bots do go banned, can’t get every single one banned. Those that have millions are a FRACTION of the tens of thousands banned daily or weekly. it’s not something that easy to deal with or it would’ve been solved already. People really need to realise this
---
Well said brudah
---
Alright cya tomorrow my dude.
---
This is exactly why the wildy is dead, with raids and Vork/zulrah etc. coming with far greater profit and far less risk it means people have no reason to go into the wilderness. They need to significantly buff the GP/hr for the bosses (since, if the risk is much higher in terms of GP lost from dying and you can only really bring 3 or 4 BiS gear pieces) to the point where they are either right in line with something like Vork or even slightly higher since chances are you will die and lose your gear AND loot at one point or another which has significant impact on profitability.
---
And Barrows is extremely fun imo

Auto smash vials when you finish the last dose. That requires some barbarian training (I think). Or at least you have to speak to somebody at Barbarian Outpost.

tob very very likely has the exact same system as cox, just not visible though.

You must be joking? I could see people training melee at nmz with the dharoks set (70 defense requirement), they max their melee, and then they reset the defense back to 1.

nothing except 15 skills, 21 quests, 2 bosses and bunch of fashionscape items from random events.

how much where nats back then? I would think they would cost more than they do fight now
---
You overpaid way too much bro, average going rate is 10k
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Yeah obviously air wards seem like they'd be the one thing that might have the most split opinions on. But if done right I think they could be an interesting and unique mechanic for everyone to use.
---
And with god armors, on the one hand you're right they would be somewhat devalued by being forgable, but on the other these have already become so cheap that almost everyone wears it in pvm in free worlds. It would somewhat make sense if these armors could be made by players considering they do offer a nice prayer bonus.

Sorry for delayed reply, buttload of work to do today.

Their anti-cheat specialist application made that very clear.
---
The skill cap for lavas is extremely high because there are so many actions that can be done in the same tick, so for the most part it's an issue of banking quickly and emptying/crafting quickly at the altar. That said, a few things that may help: 
---
screen markers for items in bank/equip slots so you can have your cursor in the right place while you wait for the next tick,
---
if you can set up mousekeys, they'll improve accuracy and prevent fatigue, 
---
make sure you're emptying pouches with shift+click and crafting immediately after the first craft happens, as there is no animation delay when crafting lavas,
---
start clicking to move before the teleport animation completes so it registers immediately when you do.
---
I googled and actually found this:
---
" In an update on [3 October](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/3_October) [2011](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/2011), the [high level alchemy](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/High_level_alchemy) value was changed from 223 coins to 74; and the [low level alchemy](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Low_level_alchemy) value was changed from 148 coins to 49. This was done because the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Exchange) price of nature runes dropped under 111 GP. From below this price, Nature runes could be alched for a small profit. Example: 2 x 111 = 222 GP = 1 GP profit. "

+1. Mainly highrisking and its horrible. 90% of the pures/zerks are AHKing. Its more rare to find an legit good pker than an ahker.
---
&gt; inv spaces dedicated to stuff like box traps, specific gear for bosses, and the supplies used for bossing, the non-PvPers are at an innate disadvantage against PKers,
---
So what youre saying is that you think you should be able to bring that stuff and the best PvM gear you can bring to the wildy ON TOP of bringing everything you need to anti pk effectively enough so that you are on an equal playing field with someone who is there to only PvP? Somehow that disadvantage is "unfair" to you? You should be able to come as best equipped as possible for both a PvM and PvP encounter at the same time with no issue? 
---
I mean im just not sure you have a realistic view on things here. The wilderness was and is not a place that has ever been about being as "fair" as possible, its a place where anything goes and its dangerous which is exactly why its so fun. You can EASILY bring anti PK gear and brews etc while you PvM that is enough to kill people/tank who are trying to PK you, there are tons of people who do that ALL THE TIME without issue. Why are those people not complaining like you are? The difference is obviously that they are GOOD at both PVP and PvM and know what theyre doing and most of all...they rather actually take the time to do something about it instead of complaining about being attacked in the wilderness.
---
Sorry dude but the issue is not about incentivizing Risk vs Reward with Pvm and PvP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that (the only issue currently is that the reward is not nearly high enough for a lot of things compared to their counter parts outside the wildy), the issue is with "getting good" and be willing to spend the time and effort to do so. If everyone who did nothing but complain about it, started to learn how to tank/anti PK like many people already do while they PvM then there would be much less issue not to mention it would make the wilderness MUCH MORE fun if there were groups of PvMers all of whom could also PK and turn the tables on PKers.

What unit are we talking about? Hours? Minutes?
---
id prioritize zenytes, rigour/augury, and ancestral personally. arma is good but its only like +5(?) range bonus over dhides, and ancestral gives you the magic damage %.

for what its worth i average like between 1-2 minutes a kill with ancestral into elite void.

i think thats what all newvbies like me decide to do eventually

Yeah with a liberal twist

Why tf does this have 4K upvotes
---
&gt; Your attitude is exactly why the wilderness is dying, PvP is so unpopular, and why people mass vote no any polls that benefit PvPers. 
---
?????
---
What? How on earth can you genuinely think something like that?
---
The main thing killing PvP is OBVIOUSLY Jagex by ignoring the hell out of for years and therefore alienating its PvP community. People have been luring and skull tricking FOREVER, but you mean to tell me that now its the reason for PvP being dead when that never killed it before? What youre saying doesnt even make sense, if it did then PvP would have also been dying when people were getting lured all over the place back in the day before there was a ditch or all the warnings that exist in the game today. Except it didnt.
---
&gt; This attitude just inhibits the growth of PvP, discouraging newcomers from wanting to even try to get onto the skill floor.
---
No...Jagex ignoring the hell out of PvP and making the people who already PvP'd, not want to PVP on this game anymore inhibits the growth. Them not adding in new content that would allow for people to get into PvP easier, inhibits the growth of PvP. 
---
Im just saying that you cant blame (or saying people should be banned, when all of these things have been going on FOREVER) PvP being in a horrible place simply because I tell you that people who get skull tricked/lured etc. are naive and dumb at this point since there are TONS OF WARNINGS already set in place by Jagex. I mean what more do you want them to do? They cant help it if people IGNORE those warnings and then put themselves in positions where they then get skulltricked/lured etc. But somehow its "my attitude" that is why PvP is dying? Thats a completely absurd notion. **People discourage themselves** by ignoring those warnings and being naive/stupid in areas they know are PvP and are very dangerous. If someone goes into a really bad area, where Police have warned people not to walk alone at night and where theyve seen people have been shot/robbed on the news...and then they get shot and robbed themselves, whose fault is that? Its that person's own fault since they knew full well the risk they were taking.
---
&gt; A player should lose to players that are better and more experienced than them, but new players shouldn't randomly lose more than they expected just because the rules of the game weren't made clear to them and are abusable by others with no punishment. There needs to be a more controlled area for people to PvP, the wildy is just outdated.
---
Umm..thats how people get better though? Facing people who are better than them? How are you genuinely going to say new players **SHOULDNT** lose more often, thats literally how it is for every game ever, its part of any learning experience, you learn through FAILURE more than anything. And yes, rules and warnings are more than available to people like I said so thats completely false.
---
**The rest of what youre describing literally only proves my point:** PvP is dying because of Jagex and Jagex only. Youre asking for barriers to be removed and a new piece of content where people can practice PvP (I mean this already exists in Clans wars, Duel Arena, etc.) with more ease and essentially an ELO system where people can learn facing people of their caliber. That is ON JAGEX to implement, and theyve chosen to ignore PvP for 2+ years. Do you not realize you literally just proved my point for me?
---
I also started, to ignore time, when i play. I set up a timer of like... 2 hours and ignored all clocks or xp per hour rates and whatnot and just played. I really started to get much more enjoyment out of this game playing like this.
---
Weirdly enough: i somehow had fun while runecrafting or fishing X D
---
I think more players should try that and sometimes just remove guides and the "efficiencyscape"-thing out of their heads. I'm not saying that they should abandon it entirely though. If it's fun for then, it's totally fine.
---
It's a game after all and not a job.
---
Np :)

Buying mith ls ^^please ^^no ^^ban

Only rune skirt weighs less though. Not even god rune skirt. All platelegs and plateskirts weigh the same as their counterparts except rune skirt. Sara rune skirt weifhs the same as rune platelegs and sara rune platelegs
---
Players like A11 IN who are max combat just hop clans, steal loot without splitting from bosses, change their names and repeat for months on end.
---
Jagex only bans simple bots and game changingly broken bug abusers, like the TBow drop.
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔

Question. Is it immoral to take seeds the bots drop?
---
tfw socialsm makes the currency of a 12 year old medieval childs game more valuable than your nations currency

Sorry, no. Invulnerability in PvP zone is a big no-no.

Not necessarily because helpless noobs would benefit from it but because it would get abused by pkers heavily. Have clan fall on you? No problem, godmode on.

Got a kill and nice loot but no supplies to survive? Godmode on.

Only by a second tho, h8r

Using Konar?
---
It is free and it won't hack you, most big streamers and their mum use it
---
I look forward to trying that out.  
---
The problem with talking about afk stuff is that people try and compare *low effort* stuff like wyvern killing and blood crafting with actual afk stuff such as redwoods.
---
No, but they do deserve to have their armor trimmed.
---
Here, I can do it for you, it'll only take a second...
---
Ooww you could then kills these monsters. Get one of 3 mysterious beings that you could put in a cage for up to 3 days. That could have chance of getting more xp per kill, or a slight boost on slayer tasks of 2.5%, or get more points for finishing the task.
---
He's the guy who hides under the general store merchant on that acc, uses a bot on worlds saying drop party [3xx] then uses his alt to use the Read A Book bug to make any character trading him move outside in the trade.

Doesn't even remotely look like ahk
---
Youve proved that you dont use a guide, since the quest is called Cooks Assistant not apprentice lmao

Saying a game "looks trash" is one of the worst arguments ever.

It's not surprising they make details incredibly easy to read from the database, it just shows a lack of integrity.

I don't know about Jagex's NDA but in my case the NDA I signed for the telecom company I work at states that I would have to pay for all the damages in full if I breached the NDA.
---
Obviously telecom companies have to have extremely tight security by law but I imagine jagex would have something similar.

thats nuts, thanks! was super curious about this

No the crabs know you are boosting levels and therefor unworthy

Alchmate, friend. Updates every half hour or so, defaults to market price of natures, and lets you sort and filter out super low volume items

Alternatively, just do black and blue dhide chests forever. Their GE price is almost always low enough for a tiny profit per cast.

Are you seriously crying about spoilers for a runescape youtube series?
---
Id understand for a major TV show or Movie but come on... we all know he is training slayer, hes said it and shown it multiple times, we know he will have 85 next ep, this spoils nothing...
---
I don't think it does too much, 100k isn't really that much. Plus it's way easier to spend the money than make the money.
---
If you download it from the official website it's not gonna hack you. If you download it from a fake site then yes it will hack you.
---
Nice.
---
Jagex needs evidence, otherwise they won't do anything. They're probably not waste time going go through an entire account's history to see where someone may have broken the rules. You need to give Jagex enough details for them to look at a specific thing in a specific time frame. 
---
If you did, then I don't know why they didn't punish him. Perhaps they did punish him with a temporary ban or just locked the account for the owner to recover. It could be that this account buyer was able to unlock it again.
---
It could also be that they just missed the email or were too busy at that time.
---
I have edited it for you ^^
---
That would be pretty interesting tbh.
---
Brutal task pays for itself
---
I’ve had some thin herb runs too. I swear it has something to do with that damn Bottomless Bucket. Ever since I got it, seems like my yields have come up short.
---
This must happen a lot. My wife got 500k from a random dude while she was splashing. Split it 50/50. Thank you random dude while my account was still new.
---
Did they not say in the last Q&amp;A that they are working on bringing the clan features RS3 has to osrs and that it would give them the ability to make group ironman possible?
---
What do you gain from going around peoples jokes you grinch
---
I don't like platelegs because they're *coarse* and rough and irritating and they *get everywhere*
---
I’ll look into that, thanks!
---
Good thing you don't have to run anywhere.
---
Cause you suck at games and like to waste ur money rofl.
---
KOing someone with a rune warhammer.
---
Rs3 bad. Swamp man good
---
That’s useful information, I’ll try that when I get to that point. Thanks!
---
yeah nah, have it like bh scores.
---
Have they restored HC status in the past?
---
😂😂😂😂 u r  funny boy
---
I think it took me nearly 40 hours, but I was nowhere near max efficiency. I needed around 1200k xp and I did somewhere around 30k per hour.
---
osrs already has mtx in terms of bonds. No one stops you from buying ~300 bonds and selling it for a tbow
---
&gt;  evidence of OP’s wrongdoings and history
---
They don't do that sort of thing anymore, they just say "You know what you did" or something like it
---
Real men KO both of them with a rune Warhammer?
---
Bitch maybe
---
Iron platelegs (t) works better with the shayzien body imo, overall i like that you used dragon gloves instead of dark mystic gloves like everbody else who picks this look. Might wanna try out the void mager helm aswell. I rate 8,5/10
---
That's not how it works, most people risk ~300k-1m in various areas of the wilderness, the only people that bring ridiculous gear and multiple +1's are clans and streamers/youtubers for the most part. Just because there's lots of options for bis gear it doesn't mean using them is the standard, generally it's mystic or xerician with all of the other same basic gear.
---
the friendship between zilyana and graardor is legendary, im glad you brought it to life too :)
---
Crystal harpoon is the dumbest idea I've heard this year.. I can just catch minnows and trade them in for sharks..
---
Why the hell would I want a new harpoon?
---
Who says i ever fixed it? *Evil laugh*
---
If you don't want to risk dying don't get into a PvP area? It's not even hard to see them coming use your mini map.
---
Yeah your last point shows how broken this would be. Ironman streamers could do masses where all of their viewers get just under 15k points and they could finish raid in like 100 kc
---
In my recent games of it I have been using HP cape and regen bracelet and camping redemption. After each game I tele to house and use pool, then jewelry box teleport back to camp and bank rewards. It has been working pretty well for me and it isn't too often that redemption even procs but its a nice added safety net if you get chosen to be WT's personal bitch for the game
---
So what does a f2p noob do? I feel overwhelmed by the things you can do. I'm just doing random things it seems. I don't wanna be googling and youtubing every thing to mix max optimise my gameplay, but I feel pretty lost trying to figure out stuff on my own. 
---
So here I am asking a bunch of enthusiast what do lol.
---
Because I couldnt bother dropping it on mobile every time I had to fix the wheels.
---
I alwaays shoo away those bitches. Worth losing the exp efficiency.
---
if you have 95+ combat stats across the board and not 91 slayer, yeah.
---
Exactly, they can just expand upon the bond shop. 
---
I see nothing wrong with say, some simple cosmetics here and there, it would give more options for fashionscape anyways.
---
Thank you.... i always forget to do this
---
he has ma2 cape already.
---
Damn, I just made a hcim... ok not just made, more like 3 days ago.
---
I figured if you get a parrot or rune ornament kit you could make some money. No real way to make some money in f2p though.
---
why are you posting on reddit instead of going to see the movie then
---
Hey everybody, Rocket League is a scam because it has loot boxes!  Quick boycott the game!
---
It makes the game less valuable over time
---
That’s nuts..
---
Yep I vowed to never return my brother started playing months ago and I eventually caved. Now my ACC has more time invested than his and I'm thinking of which Alts to make and considering having membership on multiple acy
---
This is a bs death I agree but they won't give the HC status back, they simply don't do that. No matter the circumstance
---
Not quite. The higher your str and attack the higher xp/hr you can get so it’s still better to train those up all the way then just solely train defence with the whip
---
"youre cooking has attracted a pet"
---
Don’t stop tbh, I made like 8m in 50 kills without uniques

18 is absolutely not the standard. Most universities require you to get written approval from an academic adviser to go over 18. 18 is more of a soft "max" than the norm. 15 is "standard". Gets you 120 credit hours for a Bachelor's degree in 4 years/8 semesters.

There is no official website to download KMSPico. KMSPico is officially released onto the mydigitallife forum. There are people that put an adware wizard onto KMSPico and spread it around on official looking websites trying to make a profit of it and filling those sites with ads. I only ever downloaded it from the mydigitallife forum and I have never had to look out for adware or have it bother me.

How did you buy it? What payment method? details details. Otherwise u have to make a twitter account and contact support
---
So just to be clear, you want HCs who die in safe deaths to lose HC status? PC, Castle Wars, Fight Pits, Fight Caves, etc? Do they just lose their status because they died or do they lose all but their untradable and 3 most expensive items? Can they return to loot their stuff or is it gone forever? If their stuff doesn’t drop to the ground is it really considered a “death”? Can the engine handle treating deaths in mini games/ other safe deaths differently player to player depending on which game mode they have picked? Is making previously “safe deaths” now dangerous worth whatever dev time it would take to put it in the server live? What do you do about every HC that has already utilized the “safe death” mechanics to obtain items?
---
Anytime I go to the mushroom forest part of fossil island it lags really bad for me. Is this just an issue most people run into or is it just because my laptop is garbage?

In the US the credits are the number of in class hours per week typically. So if you have a 15 credit semester, you’re spending five or take 15 hours in class per week. Supposed to match that time for studying and homework.
---
I've been following the optimal quest guide since I haven't played since 2008, and I only played f2p. As soon as I hit "Lair of Tarn" and read "short with slayer ring", I said fuck it and grinded slayer ring reward and 75 crafting.
---
Yeah i will agree its much harder than back in the day and i'm not a fan of the gmaul meta.
---
Holy shit that’s hilariously fucked hahahaha
---
I did it with an extremely easy trick I saw someone post on here once.
---
Say the attack Jad is doing outloud every single time. It registers in your brain a lot clearer. 
---
And if you have so many extra supplies left, you have all the time in the world to kill Jad, there is no rush.

Does anyone else who has a gf that's plays also notice that they don't wear helmets? My gf just started playing again and she never wants to wear a helmet because she doesn't like how it looks and wants to see her characters hair.

just once I believe, but he was never put back on the highscores
---
You’re the worst
---
It's kind of pintles and redundant though. he was responding originally to someone who was referring to the fact that the guy was on the way to go to elvarg without the shield.
---
I've never seen such an unskillfully rolled joint in my life.
---
my non-smoker wife's first try was better
---
Obviously you shouldn't get hit by fire from outside the lair, the guy you're responding to isn't saying it's his fault for not having the shield equipped.
---
The question is, why does it seem like this guy is about to fight Elvarg without having the shield at all. It's not in his inventory, so what was he planning on doing
---
We know you're broke soz
---
Jimmyflax
---
I did a similar thing like two days ago. I realized I hadn’t logged on in months and wasn’t planning on it so I gave away my 8 mil to help ensure I wouldn’t come back
---
I'm missing your thought process here. You create a HC if you want to play the game with the added challenge of not dying. My main account hasn't ever died. An extremely overwhelmingly large majority of HCIM lose their status because they did something wrong. A slim percent die due to poor internet (you shouldn't make a HCIM if you have poor internet). 
---
If everyone lost their status due to 'stupid bullshit' like this, this post wouldn't exist or get any attention at all. You wouldn't be here to comment in the first place...
---
Task extensions for the good tasks. Also I don’t recommend you stay on Konar for very long. She’s pretty garbage for slayer xp
---
M
---
Because when a HCIM has Inferno cape walking around with Sycthe its sorta impressive as an appeal.
---
Being able to do 100s of kc at TOB without dying puts you in a decent bracket for a decent PVMer.
---
Also; if yourr gonna play ironman, may as well start as a hc and see how far you get.
---
Tumeric?

Anglers change spots fairly frequently

God, I wish. I'm almost 97 slayer and it's killing me

Let me just chill at ardy course, get the same xp/h and turn off my brain please
---
Yeh but try being 6 years old like most of us were back then
---
Each spiritual creature has different slayer requirements. The spiritual ranger requires 63 slayer, warrior requires 68, and the mage (which drops dragon boots) requires 83.
---
The problem they're having is telling why people are quitting 
---
They said this in the last qna
---
They know when people start and quit, but there's really no way for them to reach out to people who have stopped playing the game and ask why.
---
Thank you, I did not know that.
---
skip skip skip
---
Now bonds is like 4m+ lmao
---
You can kill spiritual rangers at 63.
---
Because it breaks the high scores and they can’t fix that with a flag. I understand in good architecture it should be that simple, but you should know that this is anything but that
---
wow =  world of warcraft hehe xd
---
You should have prayed Melee
---
I would try this if my ign were: faps 2 traps

Kill spiritual rangers, skip the task, or do temple trekking to 68 slayer.

---
how is the [stone chest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stone_chest) for both loot and theiving exp? thinking about doing this on my hcim for some fangs
---
Fuck the Italy rock trick. Jad will spawn in the same location the YELLOW 360 mage spawns. So kill the yellow one last on wave 62.   
---
Turn on range pray for jads first attack but be prepared to switch if needed. You should have plenty of time to react to his first attack since you know where he spawns.   
---
When healers come, tag 1 in between each jad hit. No more. I know it seems complicated but after you do it once the pressure is off and you can probably do it 5 times over without dying once.
---
Shit now I'm scared to do fire cape on my hc
---
They are. Take a closer look at the picture. It's an edited version of the new Hosidius that's coming.
---
Dota has pets
---
Being 6yrs old is completely different from being brand new to the game. Although dragon slayer was an intimidating quest back then, it’s so easy to complete if you’ve got a working brain
---
You can get Twitch Prime and get a 30 day subscribtion for free.
---
I maybe tagged one or two but I had a very similar setup and ended up out-dpsing them
---
It’s good to balance it until 70 attk IMO. I always did 10lv of strength then 10 of attk until 70, then str all the way.
---
if he gets his status back, i demand that jagex also removes this fire cape from him
---
No, but if I die while being teleported in any situation I die. Really I think hardcores should lose status if they die in the caves, kind of a joke of a gamemode that it's "if you die you'll lose status unless you die in this place or any of these other 25 places"
---
Is it better to AFK monks or anglers at 89?
---
Strength raises your max hit, meaning you can hit higher which gives you bigger XP drops.
---
it requires 2 astral runes not 1, or am I missing something?
---
I think they should have made HCIM have like 3 lives not 1 life. It makes it more easy to prevent stupid buggy deaths and dc deaths.
---
I think it would be less than 1% of the playerbase. It would probably be 1% of the people who have pets
---
I just remember her fighting like a regular green drag, when was she changed?

Except you can tell the difference between an ironman and a failed hcim

"the only right way to play is my way"

I remember I mined coal for an hour, got like 30k out of it, and immediately got scammed and had to start over.

He didn't die in the fight caves. He died outside of the fight caves. Even if he did die in the fight caves he would have just wasted 90 mins because he was incapable of pressing protect melee.

Dragon Bones
---
You're just referencing people but I'm still getting triggered
---
That’s exactly what the original person said. The person I replied to is pointing out the person didn’t have a shield. And that’s completely true. But the comment before that mentions not needing an anti shield unless you’re fighting. He wasn’t fighting yet. Hence no need for the anti.
---
So no, I’m not stupid, but you might be. =)
---
You can't get to that area unless you're doing the quest if I recall correctly.

Well let's see then
---
if you use fkeys for switching between prayer and inventory it can make it a little easier to eat/pot between attacks. but mostly just focus on prayer switches.
---
I’m noob so maybe I’m wrong, but aren’t bonds 20 mil? How can that be sustained with like 200k a day?
---
Yes, I'm on par with ranged, not magic though, I really dont like it lol

defense rating sucks if a rock broke it.

Got it, thanks !
---
Blood is overrated m8

My blood steals from me, shits on me, and constantly causes drama. My friends are more my family than my family.

Is this a thing in RS3?

They’re between 3 and 4 mil.

---
1) log out at the end of the wave before the double mager (62? 63? Idk.) Take a walk. Calm down. Don't work yourself up over fighting him.
---
2) I'd recommend an RCB + diamond e switch for jad. Bp is pretty weak against his high defence and is short ranged, making it harder to tag the healers without getting punched in the face.
---
3) there are jad simulators online that are as simple as "listen to the sound effects and click which protection to use." Just practice it.
---
The biggest thing is stress. If you keep telling yourself "if you mess this up your entire last hour is a waste" then you're going to make yourself mess up. If you go into it knowing that you will mess up several times but learn something and get more practice every time, you'll get it eventually.
---
Lol dude you're talking about fishing. Whether you watch the screen or not, or use a harpoon or a rod it's not going to be any more or any less fun than fishing has been for the past decade.

Super low framerate on my shitty surface pro, but runs fine on my phone and on my desktop. Almost definitely a hardware issue

That was the true hardcore mode though, made the game so much better imo

It's the last 99 people go for most or the time

Oh interesting, I didnt know that. It makes sense though. It's not like they individually gave status back, they just reset to an earlier save basically, right?

A bond is sitting at 4mill each right now. Check on the wiki

Are you using Runelites GPU plugin? Turning that off when I go there fixes the issue for me
---
They spent literal years unravelling the spaghetti code to implement bank fixes, construction fixes/changes, and basically everything that's been changed or improved since launch. That is something that would take a weekend to fix, and allow for more things to be fixed on behalf of fucked up hcim situations like this one.

Here is something that helped me when I first beat JAD, I had died to him like 5 times so before I tried him again I used the JAD simulator to get used to the prayer switches.  I did that for like 10 minutes till I got the hang of it and have killed him 4 or 5 times now no problem.  Also realize at your level you can kill the healers one by one and he shouldnt get full health by the time you kill them all and switch back to him, I found this easier than trying to tank them and eat between switches.  Even if he gets back to full health, the second time he calls the healers I think only one appears so its much easier.  Just relax and if you do mess up a switch, just focus on eating once between switches.  Good luck dude!
---
Currently, bonds are 4.1m. Those are for 14 days I believe. I didn't realize that they have gone up so much, last I checked they were close to 3.2m.
---
Still would only take 2-4 runs a day to maintain.
---
Yeah because buying shit at varrock/fally is harder than having to obtain it all yourself lmao
---
Awesome add me man ! 
---

People don't want tradable dust cause of the minimal slayer xp/hr buff, meanwhile catacombs are fine
---
You never know what someone is carrying. Its like killing npc that can drop anything, but good loot is usually mega rare. Its ok to kill anything if you dont whine about pking not being profitable. That is just bullshit.
---
Yep I agree, I remember dying back in the days and losing my items because I couldn't get my net back up in time to pick up my items. Even if i had an ecu key it wouldn't be enough time to loot when I get a dc. The middle ground should be grave stone where you pay a percentage of the total gear you die with. It's a fair punishment that hurts people using max gear more than noobs using lower gear. The 100k fees for death at vorkath and hydra aren't enough when you get that money back in one kill. A percentage would be a healthy gold sink.
---
99 farming with cape,  attas seed, secateurs and ultracompost = 6 herbs . Pisses me off
---
Oh nice, I always used one by legends guild.
---
Quickest would be to just make a new account
---
Honestly I think that's the worst part.. it will be fine for 10 hops, then the next 10 hops you get 3-5 "you have been signed out." Don't even know when to expect it
---
And people that go for max xp / hr should not even be effected by tradable dusts.
---
I notice this on pretty much every game sub. It's like some people take it as an attack the game or something and need to find a way to shuffle the problem back to you.
---
Nope
---
Holy shit are you for real. Failing at pking will never be the same again.
---
This is fundamentally missing my point. 
---
It's not about money, I don't care about the monetary loss from a death in the wilderness. Any time I've had to go I've 3 itemed anyway.
---
My issue is that for players who have no wish to engage in PvP, there is absolutely no positive gameplay to be had there. Being PKd when you have no interest nor any chance of winning is not just unenjoyable, it's fundamentally a negative experience.
---
People choosing to take that risk in order to reap the rewards are fundamentally wanting to engage in that content, so while it's not enjoyable to be PKd, that's a risk you're choosing to take.  
---
An easy comparison that exists at present is skulling at revs. You increase the risk to increase the reward, but that's an active choice made by the player rather than a neccesity.
---
If a player has no interest in engaging in PvP and gets a wilderness clue step, there is absolutely nothing positive about this experience.
---
When I watch people in the wilderness with the bulwark they more or less become invincible even with a team pounding them, it does need to be nerfed a bit.
---
She is their girlfriend now
---
got it from konar, says kalphite in kalphite lair.. thats where i am.. i think, starting to doubt it now
---
There's moss giants on Crandor. Could easily be going to train on those.
---
&lt;3
---
there's also one in the f2p part of falador mine iirc
---
Not really, nah. Cerb is already annoying enough especially if you don't have a spectral.
---
I’m only 62 slayer so I don’t have any of the good tasks unlocked yet lol. I’ll keep a buffer so I can extend them as soon as I unlock them.
---
gonna check agian.... this is some wierd shit
---
You should be able to afk fairly well with those stats. Full obsidian + zerker neck would be your best setup. As for bosses, simple melee bosses are best. When I want to afk, I use Treus Dayth, Tree Spirit, Count Draynor, The Kendal and General Khazard.
---
If you cant tell the difference between two attacks you probably have brain damage and are bad at video games
---
It's meh. It works and cerb is a good task, but it'll be quite a hassle given how many p pots you already go through. You can try if you want, but I'd just get 91
---
There's 2 different locations. Kalphite Cave is right outside Shanty Pass and is  a task only area. Kalphite Lair is to the west of shanty pass. It's where the Kalphite Queen is. You'll need a rope to access it
---
I am reminded of the brigands from Thief and the Cobbler
---
That's the rs2 beta
---
that's the one where kq is, youre at the kalphite cave which is task only
---
Yours didn’t have a nice meme attached to it

**The State of PvP Blog**  
---
*In March 2019, we addressed your concerns regarding the state of PvP. Strengthening PvP and competitive gaming is a key priority of ours. This blog will give you an insight into our plans for PvP including content changes, events, and future poll questions.*  
---
📷**Content Changes**  
---
📷  
---
**Changelog:**
---
* Added Bulwark Rework in the "To Be Discussed" section
---
* Added Imbued Capes and Other Untradeables in the "To Be Discussed" section
---
* Added a GP value of Gmaul drop with special attachment on PvP Death
---
* Removed Overhead Prayers from the "To Be Discussed" section
---
* Specified Wilderness chests for Wilderness Slayer Keys
---
* Moved Zammy Wine Spawn from "To Be Discussed" section to "To Be Polled" section
---
* Added poll questions for all "To Be Polled" changes
---
We are frequently asked to place less focus on new content and instead concentrate on fixing PvP. With our recent PvP cabal in April, we asked members to prioritise a list of changes they want made to help fix PvP. Though the changes below may seem small, we want to ensure we start off with a good foundation for PvP before we introduce any big changes to the PvP meta. We also want to continue to do PvP cabals with various members of the community including ex-pvpers, clan pvpers, and solo pvpers. This will allow us to continue making changes to PvP in the foreseeable future. Below is a list of suggested changes for PvP that will fall under the "Integrity Changes", "To Be Polled", or "To Be Discussed" sections.

📷**Last Man Standing**  
---
Mod Roq with the help of Mod Maz, have been toiling away and redeveloping Last Man Standing (LMS) into a different type of minigame that focuses on a style of PvP more likely to be seen across the game. This section will go over proposed changes to the minigame.  
---
When Last Man Standing arrived in August 2016, it arrived with a lot of hype but ended up with a mixed reception. Contrary to our expectations, the minigame only peaked when high stakes weekends were run to attract the top tier players. In addition, with no real rewards for playing there was little reason for PvPers to play. In short, although a PvP minigame is definitely needed, Last Man Standing didn’t end up being the minigame players wanted.  
---
Behind the link, we address some of the biggest issues and show you how we intent to improve on them in the initial iteration of the new Last Man Standing minigame. We will detail how the first live playtest will look and function and how we will process the feedback from it. Everyone has their own ideas about what gear should be used, what loot there should be, and how the mechanics should work. We plan to use live-testing and feedback to direct the minigame into the best possible position.

**Deadman Spring Finals Re-Run**  
---
The final 256 players from the Spring Finals Tournament that took place on the 30th of March 2019 will be re-invited to compete in a re-run. We'd like to thank you for your patience, and we're now able to announce that the date of this re-run is **14th of June 2019**. There'll be two open beta tests ahead of the re-run. The provisional dates for these tests are the **24th of May** and the **7th of June**. There'll also be a trial login on the **3rd of June**, this is specifically for the 256 players we'll be inviting to the re-run. This will be an opportunity for us to test that the steps we've taken to restore your game saves are correct, and that your accounts will be as you expect. Please look out for more information in your in-game message centre in the coming weeks. Future news posts will also talk about the re-run finals start time and the beta test date.  
---
**Deadman Summer Finals**  
---
The weeklong Summer Finals will begin on the **22nd of June**. Competitors will have one week to prepare, and it will conclude with the Permadeath stage on the **29th of June 2019**. In early June we will send inbox messages to all that have qualified regarding finalised times of the tournament and finals.  
---
**Future of Competitive Gaming**  
---
Competitive gaming events help grow the community through Marketing and Influencer Livestreams. We want to work closer with you to determine what you want from competitive gaming events. Whether it be something as small as a community initiative PvP Bingo Event/PvP Clan Cup, to an entire overhaul of a new competitive gaming mode, we want you to feel like you are being heard. We started our first cabal in April by outlining community ideas like a Deadman Revival and a Territory Wars event and we want to continue to gather new and innovative ideas to make an event the community enjoys playing and watching.  
---
You can email your new competitive gaming mode ideas at OldSchoolCommunity@Jagex.com with the subject "Competitive Gaming", or discuss in the community-led [**2007Scape Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/), or the community-led [**OSRS Discord**](http://discord.gg/OSRS)in the **#old-school** channel.

📷**Bounty Hunter Rework**  
---
Two years ago, a Bounty Hunter Rework was mentioned at RuneFest. We promised big changes but then made little progress on those changes, and failed to communicate this to our audience of dedicated Bounty Hunter players. It is time we made a start on delivering some Bounty Hunter changes.  
---
Mod Gambit has now taken on the Bounty Hunter Rework discussions and planning. We would like to involve as many people from the Bounty Hunter community as possible to work together on integrity changes, major content changes and a new Bounty Hunter system. We will start by inviting some top Bounty Hunter players to an open design discussion, covering the current issues and potential solutions. From there, the design will be pitched to you all in a future design blog to ensure we are on the right track. The final plan is to release a poll blog based on your feedback from the design blog.  
---
We want you to help us make the right decisions to fix the root of the issues relating to Bounty Hunter, not just band aid the problem. This will not be an easy task with simple fixes. We want to get it right, and that will take time. We appreciate the dedication and passion of our player-base and we look forward to seeing your design and ideas around Bounty Hunter.  
---
While we await a dedicated Bounty Hunter Design blog, here are some small changes we would like to make to Bounty Hunter:  
---
* **Leader board:** This leader board will allow players to see who has the top BH kills that day or most emblems farmed. The leader board will reset around midnight game time.
---
* **Disable Box Traps, Fires, Bird Snares, and Cannons from being set up in BH Worlds (1-10 Wilderness):**When on a BH world in levels 1-10 of the Wilderness it will no longer be possible to set up Box Traps, Bird Snares, and Cannons. This is to prevent disruptive behaviour within BH. Should this be successful, we can look to extend this change to every world to improve PvP across the board.
---
* **Cosmetic Reward Shop Additions**: As the rune pouch can now be obtained via Slayer, there aren't any unique rewards for participating in BH. We want to create some unique cosmetics such as a hat or cape to signify elite status within BH and encourage more players to participate. These are just suggestions and we are open to more feedback from you about rewards to include in this potential shop.
---
My internet connection was a bit patchy and I hit retry a few times. Seems they all they went through when the connection came back.
---
Well you're still wrong. Parent comment is "Lmao seems buggy, but he was fucked anyways with no anti dragon shield!", someone replied (justified) that why would he need one when theres no expectation of dragonfire. The person who made the no shield comment explained he meant that he assumed the hcim was on his way to fight, which if he is right, would justify his point. Yet here you are still somehow arguing against this...
---
The problem with rsps is the lack of players
---
&gt;Be careful doing that. Obsidian shards are basically like glass shards.
---
So glass is acts like glass...huh the more you know.
---
Because there's an animation for bending over to the wall and for standing back up
---
Do i use the absorption method for this or just super combat potions?
---
This is how ticks work in this game.
---
Pkers definitely make their profit from killing PVMers over other pkers, so it makes sense they're against any change that makes it harder for them, specifically the bulwark and prayer changes.
---
Confidence comes after the first succeeded attempt, and you will almost always confidently nail it, but oh boy the first one is hard as fuck. Keep trying and believe in it! Yo can definitely do it!
---
No, if you want to participate in the worst part of RS you have to be able to handle the scum
---
If u wana add "p hat c j" im on a lot and have a lot of ironman experience if u need it
---
Fally mine f2p only has 2 unless one was added that I dont know of
---
Yo, I was high alching and the sound effect worked PERFECTLY with the beat! Take a listen for yourself and I think you would agree!
---
Full Obsidian, Obsidian sword, B neck, Fire cape, B ring, Prims, Barrows gloves, Obsidian shield.
---
Implying this isn't the original.
---
Very illegal and Interpol will be at your door
---
This but unironically.
---
i got skel vissy at 12 kc. And ava upgrade at 20 something. Only wanted ava but ill take that thanks.
---
Can't use a defender at 60/60 att/str
---
no finishing the cave doesn't reset your stats either. If you kill jad with 10 hp 10 prayer left, you'll be outside with 10 hp 10 prayer.
---
youre probably right, it's been a minute since i was down there
---
By using the bulwark you already lose the ability to fight back. The damage reduction effect isn't even active in pvp. 
---
In multi if the team has enough numbers there's no chance, bulwark or no bulwark. 
---
In *singles* I don't think having a *team* pound on you should even be a thing.
---
RuneScape!
---
The good thing about Magic is that you can train it through non combat methods. For example, I train Magic while I do Agility by casting High Alchemy between obstacles.
---
it's kinda not a glitch, because your stats are NOT restores to full after you complete the fight caves. He simply got his at the last possible tick :/
---
Screw that. Alch room is free magic exp and fast. The tele room takes 10 times as long and is utter shit. Alch and enchant room are my fav easily.
---
It's a bold strategy Cotton
---
OSRS Advice
---
I mean max efficiency task list contains some cannon tasks (mainly for points) so it would be a small increase in xp/hr but I honestly think it would be hardly noticable
---
Do u have every boss pet?
---
maybe around the end of the dragon slayer quest, if they want that rune pl8, they might like some gold
---
you also have a good name
---
Like I've said pkers do use it because of the magic damage, it's super easy to get if you know where you killed the particular demon last, and they can stack in bank for return sets.  The people that keep arguing against don't know what they're talking about.
---
Only dust devils and nechs are worth extending, and not if you're using Konar because you're not guaranteed to get them in the catacombs where you barrage them.
---
Add a 0.9x slayer xp multiplier to all catacomb burstables to compensate.
---
Ahh when did he switch? I just remember after he endorsed runeloader and they owner leaked IPs that he said he wasn't using 3rd party
---
I don’t really have a clue about what makes pvp shit either, as i never really cared for pking - what are some of the problems with pvp in its current state?
---
Honestly wouldn't be a bad idea either way with how inflated slayer xp rates are now
---
Up tot he top of Jagex customer support you go.
---
wait, you can log out in the middle of a jad run and it continues where you left off??? holy shit
---
Life on easy mode
---
Thank you lol
---
Your moms like home tele, free.
---
....because you shouldn't be?  If you really think one item should make you unkillable then I really don't know what to tell you other than to go gear up with 2m risk and see for yourself how broken that item is.
---
After the official client crashed on him and almost lost him his HC on Skroomoomlie. Pretty sad that a third party client is more stable than the official one.
---
&gt; 3) there are jad simulators online that are as simple as "listen to the sound effects and click which protection to use." Just practice it.
---
You don't even need a simulator, just use a youtube video. Instant feedback. Do it until you're perfect, restart every time you mess up.
---
At the end of the day this is more or less just quality of life updates for pvp. This isn't the bounty hunter rework expansion we've been promised for over 2 years now. I feel extremely underwhelmed by what is being offered knowing pvp won't be touched for another 2 years after these QoL updates go through. I'm so sick of empty promises, and blatant lies. In the dev blog they claim pvp is important to them, that its their PRIORITY, the crowd control tactics are a slap in the face. Put more bodies on this project already. Give the community what you promised years ago.
---
&gt; more def builds (20, 30, 35 being viable)
---
That will never be a thing. Level difference between those levels and 42/45 is not big enough that it wouldnt be worth it to sacrifice a few str levels for all the things you unlock with 40+ defense. 
---
Those accounts were only a thing pre eoc because curses were so insanely good and people didnt really gave a fuck about having good accounts back then
---
Oh yeah lemme just get that real quick
---
We don't know how he did it.
---
Good luck man!
---
Still semi click intensive. You have to bank and re-cast every minute or so
---
This, if you can't flex the inferno/cmode pet you haven't even started.
---
Yea Looks like someone never climbed the 7000 steps.
---
Youll be glad you have those extra flails when you start the dpick grind
---
I'm on the same boat as you dude
---
A few days ago I saw a 55 CB with a firecape. Dude had 11 prayer.
---
For reference;
---
1.  Brimstone Ring pieces are 1/180, I've gotten 3/145. 
---
2. Heads are 1/256, I've gotten 3/145.
---
30 kills left on task...
---
25k /hr &gt; 0 for sure
---
Zulrah is all about moving at the right time and standing in the right spot. You can avoid a lot of damage by doing these two things right. If you do them wrong, you can get stacked out in a blink by poison clouds/snakelings/missing prayer switch. It's tough at first but it'll click after a while.
---
Others have said more or less the same but it's a combination of summer coming up which means more players which means more stuff entering the game, merchers trying to speculate on updates, and good old fashioned market correction after the huuuuuge boom mobile/other recent updates produced. Prices have been absurdly inflated for the last year(ish).
---
#literally unplayable
---
Wheres the one sucking the dick coming off his head?
---
Singles teams is fine, I just think spec trading could see some more changes.  If nothing changes then I'll probably just start sticking to BH deep wildy, although the last time I tried that I only fought people using AHK prayers so honestly just not sure what to do.
---
I’ve recently come back after a few years. Everything has gone up in price. When I quit I sold everything because I thaught is was going to drop. It was a huge mistake because nog I can’t even buy back half the stuff I had before. So I dont fully agree with you. Some prices of lower tier items have dropped a lot tho. For example dragon platelegs or some barrows pieces.
---
Why does it matter what the value of items is?
---
I'm saying to allow them to be acquired from PvM, but with a 10x decrease on the drop rate for the majority of the table.
---
There is absolutely no way that people would bother to do the bosses without the halo if the gold/hr was 1/10 of what is is now. If the price of those items was to tank, then they would be even less viable to do. By nature it's a negative feedback loop, and the price would not ultimately suffer.
---
But there is a fundamental difference between having the option to do so and it being worthwhile. 
---
Regardless, most of the issues I have stem from the MA2 cape and clue scrolls. They're both fundamentally PvE content with PvE rewards, but they require engaging in PvP content.
---
Can this be done with right ctrl or only left?
---
Really depends how many per acorn is needed and how abundant the other seeds are. And if any new ways to get them will come with priff.
---
Well, hopefully a while comes soon. I've gotten better at moving, but I still can't figure out the safespots at all, so I get fucked by poison almost every time. Even marking them in runelite didn't really help somehow, the guide I followed for the markings I think is different than the form guide I use (the one from the wiki), so trying to figure out where to stand between my ground markers and the Xs on the phase map is messing with me.
---
Good call. But for real, if you're struggling on Jad my best tip is to practice on a Youtube video. Do it until you can run through the kill flawlessly multiple times. Instant feedback, if you mess up restart.
---
Digsite exam specifically says to equip your leather boots and gloves as part of a safety precaution
---
I don't know what the fuck any of that meant
---
I don't know he was there to fight Elvarg, that's why I said "seems". I saw he had a bunch of runes and food, and I actually didn't know people ever trained there, I thought he had just finished unlocking the shortcut and was off to finish the quest
---
It's no big deal really. Bring along an anti-poison or two and when the venom starts to hit hard drink two sips. Venom is only really nasty if you let it build up to the point where it's doing ~16+ damage. 
---
(Venom always works the same way. It starts hitting 8's and then goes up by two each time it hits you to a max of 20.)
---
I can't see why not. I'm all out in favour of warding and I would like to see nex added to the game. It's just very difficult to convince the majority of the player base however.
---
Where's the guy with the dick on his forehead that he can suck?
---
Flippidy do my good sir, the black knights aren't going to destroy themselves...
---
Not really no
---
I actually didn't know that, that makes sense
---
Yeah, I was doing a bit of research and I think this is probably my best bet given my current construction level. Now I just have to get 83 hunter and start catching dragon imps lol.
---
You're not even 20% of the way through drop rate on a claw. It'll come in time.
---
Most people compare it to cerb which you can start comfortably boosting at 88 slayer(not far off 85). Cerb is more kills per trip/way easier to kill/decently more gp. ALSO That 2m/hr considers bludgeon drops which you need to complete to sell, meaning to actually see good profits you need to do 400-1000kc to complete a bludgeon. You can't sell the pieces on their own.
---
You don’t need to, your voice is great :)
---
I’m sure sure
---
It isnt thought because thats not the discussuon we were having. Nobody has disagreed with the point you made. Someone was a smart ass to someone who made a valid, seperate point that is irrelevant to the bug. We are discussing the idiot who doubled down on the seperate, valid point that was made after the person clarified it, and it was valid.
---
Reeee angry boy.
---
I get that lol, thats definitely most people who pvp.  Some people just take it to another level that makes me question their mentality
---
It is known.
---
I don't get it. My pvp clan gets attacked by other pking clans and we hardly get hate mail.
---
&gt; Jad will spawn in the same location the YELLOW 360 mage spawns. So kill the yellow one last on wave 62.
---
Jad will spawn where the 45 spawns on wave 3
---
The unfortunate thing is, if there was some "best alch" item, then the price would go up when everyone found out about it no longer making it the best alch
---
AYS
---
The main problem people have with Jad is fear of wasting their time and having to do all the bullshit again. DS2 you'll be fine because worst thing is paying 100k per death. I died like 5 times to Galvek but after doing some more bossing in the game (raids) you realize that Galvek isn't bad at all. There's a few scenarios where you can get dropped but it's fully possible to do it in 1 try if you pay attention to his fire ball and know where to walk during the tsunamis
---
I have runelite... This is for scrolls people may need help / advice with outside of where to go and who to speak to.
---
Dude. Use the blowpipe to get to jad
---
Then switch to rune cbow and diamond bolts enchanted.
---
You're attacking too fast making it difficult to multitask
---
With the rune cbow you focus one thing. Hit the healer then switch or dont switch your prayer. Hit the next one switch prayer. Etc. Once all 4 are off jad switch back to you BP hit jad and focus on prayers.
---
Biggest thing with jad is focusing on prayers. One miss and he can one shot you.
---
they do this in RS3, you have to pay a percentage of your items lost, and it's usually like 500k-2m? That'd be great for osrs.
---
Who hurt who 😂
---
Awesome! As we grow I'm sure there will be some west coasters too :)
---
THis is exactly what OSRS needs, PvM has become essentially a completely risk free environment where everyone uses BiS gear with no risk. I think thats why so many people complain so much about PvM in the wilderness(outside of many of the things needing their GP/hr buffed significantly to make them worth doing), there is ACTUALLY RISK involved which is something that people have been conditioned to not expect anymore. 
---
The economy would be much better off if death mechanics were reintroduced like this and some item sinks were as well. People have been getting far too used to there being absolutely zero risk outside of 100k per death at Vork/ToB while doing the most profitable things in the game and its probably one of the biggest issues in PvM.
---
ikr the only people who use bulwark are wilderness skilers, actual pkers don't even use it often.
---
&gt;	What would really help people to not quit pking out of frustration would be to add some new PvP area (they planned this colloseum on zeah for pvp maybe use that) where you just fight the same way as you would in wildy/pvp but you have to challenge someone to fight you so you can get PJed/rushed.
---
People could potentially do this at duel arena and put up cash instead of getting items on death. Although I do like the sound of a new arena to do it in, perhaps allowing stakes and losing all items on death. 
---
Another thing it could include is the EP system from pre-eoc where killing someone gave random loot which was determined by how much you’d lost/how long you’d been risking. But instead of basing it on those metrics, base it on kill streaks. Every additional streak count, you gain a % chance to get a random item in your loot. This would make killing someone who isn’t risking much more exciting, because there’s potentially a decent drop from the kill streak table.
---
That feel when curved bone
---
You can almost see the pile of bones voting no to pvp updates.
---
Yes, when you click the logout button it tells you that you will be logged out once you complete the wave you are on or if you force a log out you have to restart the wave that you're on
---
Let’s see you drop 50 patterned items without any disappearing. Got 10m you cant recreate it. If you do, drop your username we can meet and I’ll deliver
---
Pking at fire giants can usually be free emblems because people don’t want to bother banking and running back.  That’s why people do it
---
It’s not sociopaths, it’s edgy kids who think they are sociopaths
---
I dont know off the top of my head. Maybe like 40k? An hour. That number could be way off though
---
Shared definitely isn't the fastest, you want to keep strength around 5 levels higher than attack and basically ignore defence until you've reached your str and attack levels
---
My back for not catching it. 
---
Sadly there seem to be enough people who actually feel that way though.
---
Might check it out after lab. Commenting to save

You have too much time on your hands
---
&gt; People could potentially do this at duel arena and put up cash instead of getting items on death. 
---
That would defeat the point though. Just being able to do normal 1vs1 fights without having some guy trying to rush you as you step out of the safezone and someone else tb you after you get a kill would be nice.

I think it was released with the first treasure trails expansion :)

In Blessed d'hide at 74 Defense I had to eat because I almost died to the healers. They do a lot more damage than people give them credit for

Thanks for the vote of confidence. I only have MM2 and DS2 to go. Will probably give it a shot soon.

If I use the week membership trial from mobile, is there a reasonable way to make enough for a bond in that time?

Currently have ~1m on f2p, and [stats](https://imgur.com/mbWL6oH) if it matters

I just did it again at 85 range with bp, addy darts, slayer helm, blessed d'hide, fury, eagle eye and tagged one healer that was close to me. out dps'd the other healers easily. probably could have out dps'd them all.

Replace PvP with runescape and you're on the right track. The narrative that this is only pkers is wrong. It's not any specific section of players, it's just some players are really shitty people with those shitty mentality.
---
I've probably been shit talked more by random people during slayer tasks than I have in the wilderness, personally
---
Its crazy how back then for even the most minor offense you could get a mute (like typing a swear, having the in game filter change it to asterisks, but still being reported and muted) yet today people talk shit as if its a Call of Duty MW2 lobby and everything's fine.
---
Welp, there's something I'm never going to be able to un-see.

Someone told me in vc in discord that the new elf elite diary would increase their drop rate. Though just looking through the dev blogs I'm not seeing it so I'm not sure how true that is.
---
because the fire cape is what everyone wears when they first get it, and noobs who go for cooking skillcape first  wear and show it off like its a huge achievement. Was just making a silly joke

Oh jeez am I really that tired? Just realised who he’s talking about 😑
---
So no answer?
---
whip for melee, rcb/msb for range(get bp at 75), and when you get 75 mage trident

Perhaps you need to find new people to raid with. I’ve never had an issue with my friends.

Lmao I go to cow pens on world 1 when I'm drunk and tell people to moo with me the ones that do get 100k
---
Clearly catching a freeze is important at revs because it allows you to keep ur opponent in multi for as long as possible.
---
You were saying that magic is the best dps at revs which is horseshit. Especially because you'll be blitzing to avoid friendly fire
---
I pvm and pk in the wild. Pkers almost always hop when someone is on an account built for PvP and geared for PvP. I prefer pvm so I don't really care if PvP self destructs because everyone wants easy kills but this idea that most pkers are looking for actual fights is just a fantasy.

Oooohhhhhhhh, had me super confused.  Was thinking I was missing a chunk of info that made the cape OP hahaha

I know, it's like people are still enjoying the game even though they're not making profit. Losers.
---
I'll happily attack anyone I see and it's fully understandable and expected that it will happen to me when I'm doing clue scrolls or pvming. It's not all about making money, it's just the wilderness

Very different environment for sure. I think now that it's not viewed as a kids game, they're not as worried.

&gt; rwt is something the game is strongly against 
---
But we have bonds.
---
Some people can't play games with killing, others can't play games that are open world, others cant play games that give you the option to legally gamble.
---
And 1000s of people get banned everyday.
---
Im not sure why theyre focusing so much on slightly nerfing the magic defense of Black dhide when that will have only an incredibly small impact on mage defense, it also doesnt impact how good black dhide is OFFENSIVELY for its price. I dont think people realize that a standard black dhide rag range setup(which costs &lt;100k) is only like .9 DPS lower than someone in MAX RANGE(250m) and the accuracy difference is pretty small too, its something like 8.8 DPS in rag range and like 9.8? DPS in full max range. 
---
I think people who are complaining about black dhide nerf (mostly PvMers who dont actually understand the mechanics) dont realize that the nerf will have VERY, VERY little impact on things yet theyre acting like the sky is falling. People will still be splashing a ton even in decent gear (and no, im not talking about people barraging in xerican rag mage setups for the clueless people who want to make that very flawed argument).
---
The core problem is how magic defense is calculated and it being 70% of magic level, 30% gear. Splashing on someone in a full melee setup even in decent magic gear is something that happens WAY too often currently which is directly because of this fact. People arent expecting or want 100% mage accuracy for the PvMers who try and make such a silly argument, PvPers simply want magic to not be broken anymore and actually be a damage source that will make people quit camping range/melee pray because you mitigate more chances of dying by doing so. This should be the highest priority, not slightly nerfing black dhide.
---
One of the other big problems in PvP is the use of scripting and ragging. Currently, people do both with pretty much no fear of being banned or anything, and it does in fact aid in killing PvP....yet Jagex does basically nothing about it. In fact, by adding 60% prays and not addressing magic defense, Jagex would be making ragging even stronger.
---
The BH "rework" is just completely disappointing, how you can announce something over 2 years ago and then come up with THIS is just mind blowing, it shows that they clearly put next to ZERO effort into it....OVER YEARS of time. Thats something that is just completely unacceptable and shows that they really arent as dedicated to PvP as they try to make it sound like they are.
---
Lastly, **CAN WE GET EVEN A SINGLE PERSON DEDICATED TO PVP?** There is not a single person in Jagex's team that is dedicated to PvP which is honestly absurd to even think about. In every other big MMO, there is a TEAM let alone a single person who is dedicated to the PvP community in that game. This is the reason why there is such a disconnect between the community and getting much needed changes into the game, moreover the RIGHT changes/updates. There is no excuse for this, the game is at its height in terms of popularity and how much profit Jagex is making overall, they just added multiple new ARTISTS and youre going to tell me you cant hire even a single person to dedicate towards PvP? There is simply no excuse anymore. **They pride themselves on being a "community driven game" but that comes with a huge asterisk at the end, "ONLY if you primarily PvM or Skill".** The only way PvP in this game has been "community driven" over the past 2-3 years is the PvM community voting down any PvP updates from going into the game and Jagex actually allowing them to do it as well as ignoring PvP. The excuse of "oh there isnt enough support for PvP updates" (complete and utter bullshit) or "we dont have the staffing power to pay attention to PvP" are tired, old excuses that need to stop.

:P nah i was just being funny

Play an ironman.

Probably blast furnace doing steel bars. It won't be good and it'll probably take 10+ hours for a bond, but it's not impossible.

I'd recommend just paying and building your account for now. Spending 80% of your time worried about making money that goes away at the end of the week will burn you out.

Twitch prime also has a promo going, gives out a free month. Use it to get a head start.

There's no way you're an active deep wildy pker if you're making these statements. You're actually delusional.

Tbh it's not really that high stakes. In other games once you die while playing in ironman mode like in XCOM or EUIV, it's game over and you have to start over again.

Alright Ironman. Your joke wasnt this funny you had to post to reddit

OP is soft.

It would give capes to all the people who didn't get it due to it.

How the fuck is that not, by definition, making it easier? Are you retarded mate? If people are failing to receive a cape because of it, it's obviously part of the challenge.

Literally proving everyone's point that people just want the game made easier.

Where did I say magic is the best dps, I said against Dinhs you should stop bolt ragging and barraging/blitzing.
---
Yeah you should be in the clear. I mean, your friend should be in the clear
---
Again, if he died before he was moved out of the cave he wouldn't have gotten his fire cape, I literally would have done that in that situation

Sadly, I was only a bystander to this epic dialogue exchange. Not a btw :(

If jagex automated system doesnt believe you are the owner a mods not going to help you. Try adding info. Remove stuff you are not filly certain of. An acc that has not been recovered can generally be recovered off knowing all the earliest passwords, general creation dates alone.

Bulwark:
---
\&gt;This isn't a problem in itself however, in its current format, it gives  the player high **invulnerability when combined with certain  equipment/protection prayers.** We would like to discuss any ideas that  players may have that allows the shield to have more of a use outside of  PvP and also talk about reducing its effectiveness in PvP situations.
---
[Cool, cool, cool, no doubt, no dobut...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDcbpFimUc8)
---
I think 99 is great for the cape’s perk. I also regret not doing it at a lower HP.
---
I don't think negative bonus for attack on Dhide is possible given all the content out side of PKing that relies on range armour that doesn't inhibit melee.  Which is why I chose melee stat reduction on a spell because it gets around those other balancing conundrums.
---
I think it’s more just the achievement
---
i know im awful for it but i laughed so hard at that part of the quest
---
Have you never staked before?
---
Our experiences in the wild have clearly been different. With your experience, what do you think bringing more pvmers into the wild will solve if you are truly looking for PvP fights?
---
ty (:
---
Warming up with the rune scum so you can slip in the d long, nice
---
I know this is mostly dealt with but let me say a few things. 
---
1. Keep doing it, it took me multiple tries as well. 
---
2. Dragon darts are kind of a waste of gp if you can’t afford to be doing this elsewhere. At 90 range addy darts do fine and bring me a 49 minute kill w/slayer helm now. 
---
3. Jad simulator, Jad simulator, Jad simulator. His graphic aren’t the same but the attack animations pretty much identical. Learn the mage/range switch first and when you get comfortable switch to melee praying too to make it harder. 
---
4 MOST IMPORTANTLY TAKE A BREAK AT WAVE 61. Idk if anyone else mentioned this but this is how I kill Jad. 
---
Spending almost an hour getting to Jad is annoying and exciting in itself, I promise if you end at 61, take a 5-10 minute break to collect yourself. 
---
I say 61 because you don’t want to log in to the Jad wave beginning right away, so you get to start at the two mages and know exactly where Jad is to prepare. 
---
Hope this helped a little.
---
you really don’t get caught unless your stupid about it, I’ve done it more than 15 times still haven’t been caught. Check player auctions lol

He might just be tired of the job. If he lost his passion for the job, he better changes before he burns out.

Turn your sound off its more confusing for you.

Tfw I have the same tab but it’s only 60m because I don’t do boss tasks

Well the reward for them is that there is no risk for them except teams.  I just had someone suggest that the best solution for me is to ignore people with bulwarks.  And it's a good suggestion, which is a problem

Easy if you can kill all of them sequentially without overlapping spawns

Slightly difficult if you are slow at switching and let more than one spawn at the same time

Do you realize how little sense you make?
---
Read your comment out loud... What does that have to do with 
---
&gt;If it scares you, you or one of friends RWTs for sure.
---
You implied that "me or one of my friends RWTs for sure" because I said 
---
&gt;I lend equipment or help out my irl friends here and there.
---
In a thread where JMod confirms they banned OP by mistake.
---
So not only are you completely incorrect but my original comment is completely legitimate because it literally happened to OP.

If any of these words are too big for you I can slow it down...

Why is Snare a members spell?! Just died to Obor because I didn’t realize I couldn’t cast it and kept trying on mobile! Lol
---
I mean it makes a lot of sense. Runescape players wanted an old version and just that. Wow players still want the patches in classic and the raids that follow it. I'm pretty sure almost everyone is on board with following it up with burning crusade but after that one has to wonder where things lead. That still means we have a number of years worth of content though before shit hits the fan.

Yes.

On a second read through I suppose it could be taken either way.

you can profit with a cannon at the jatiszo ice trolls
---
i got like 80k xp/hr at 70-75 range with cannon + rcb w/ mith bolts
---
you need to start the fremennik isles quest to access jatiszo
---
you need to use a fremennik shield to reduce the max hit of the range trolls to 2
---
🦀🦀🦀 Its only nostalgia 🦀🦀🦀
---
That’s not even remotely true, either argument. 
---
It’s not hard at all to bring anti gear and a bulwark, 3-4 items means you can bring ags or claws, ballista (some bring elder maul as well if they’re good) and more in addition to your bulwark with vengeance and that’s an extremely strong anti PK setup with very high KO potential in a simple dhide+ Neitz setup. You can bring all that and risk virtually nothing. 
---
And it’s not like every pker killing pvmers are good...a lot are quite bad which is why they practice on PVMers and it’s not hard to catch them off guard with a vengeance+ballista to ags  Gmaul spec and drop them since it’s a really strong combo.
---
Got 2 on 20 kc yesterday
---
yeah rcb is rune crossbow. you can buy a trident off the ge. a trident of the seas(the weaker one) is only like 70k
---
Nope. I heard they are amazing. I mainly did Magic’s/redwoods.

Interesting. I never played classic so I'm not aware how strong nostalgia will hit (I'm sure its the same with all of us and runescape) but it seems like that after the nostalgia dies down it would get a bit boring, wouldn't it?

ctrl + click  lets you run to your destination even if you dont have run enabled. tab allows you to reply back to the last person that sent you a pm, cycling tab cycles the last people who sent you a pm. just a couple. i know there are way more out there that i cant think of right now

Thanks 🤘🏼

Yeah, but then a week or so later I was doing the fairy tale Quest and the RNG Gods decided that I would need a nature Talisman for it, which is a pain in the ass to get your hands on as a low combat level Ironman.

Is there a preferred order to kill them ?

---
Heads!
---
I get around 4-6 kills on average per trip. Usually my inventories fill up by the 6th kill. I was wondering if a Imbued heart would make me get 6 kills more consistently since I would be taking less damage due to higher magic defense but at the cost of 1 food/inventory space.
---
People claim to get a consistent 6-7 kill but despite being perfect, it's not a consistent 6 for me. A lot of times I end up with 4-5 due to bad RNG.
---
The problem is at level 126 too. It doesnt matter if its split because the accuracy would still be the same. 99 x random percentage + 99 x 100-random percentage will still equal 99. Ur magic def is rolled off that total number. I dont think u have a solid grasp on how accuracy is rolled as ur suggestion would leave us in the same place as now bar the armor nerfs.
---
What was your xp per hour on magics?
---
I always sell them off. Those boots are worth some money.
---
I'd guess you've easily logged thousands of hours of across multiple accounts? From what you've told us, you're in the top .01% of active players. There are not many games out there that can provide quality &amp; unique gameplay experiences after that much time.
---
At some point you have to realize you play more than the devs can hold your attention. You're far more active than the target audience. Here's a few things you might find interest in:
---
- 200m in your favorite skills
---
- Unique PvP/PvE accounts like a 10 hp ironman
---
-  Creating content for others (youtube/twitch series)
---
- Leading or taking up responsibilities in a clan (PvM or PvP)
---
You mentioned you like long grinds. Any goal you set here will be a long grind. Becoming well-known &amp; good at social media (Youtube/Twitch) is a *grind* just as much as creating a new account or earning a rank in a clan.
---
At this point, it's up to you to find things you enjoy because you're clearly playing more than almost anyone you meet outside of your maxed-friends circle.
---
Aww how very nice of you to show that you care by commenting, thanks man!
---
actually it's called international waters
---
What? That's not how things work when you have to support a family. It can take months to get a job.
---
How are you factoring in dead herbs? They shouldn't be included in the seed count used for the average since you didn't get any yield. Try splitting it out and removing those if they're included.
---
I’m down to make it +10

Maybe don't go to an area specifically made to kill you?

Theres nothing wrong with enhancing the game for a certain playerbase while not affecting the rest. The issue is that people vote with biases. 75% of the community according to the blessed armor poll spite votes if it doesnt benefit them even if it doesnt harm them.
---
Bit of a backstory: never did my clues because I never have good rng and I thought you could stack clues up until a couple months ago but at that point I was barely playing anymore. Decided to hop on after about 6 weeks of not playing. This was the first clue I've ever completed :)
---
Uhh, they already can. It's called the menagerie.
---
I heard it was way more hardcore. I remember I would go to my friends house every weekend and every time I went over he or his brother would be playing WoW and I'd say "What are ya doing" and they always replied "Grinding for epic flying"
---
No idea why that's so funny to me but it is lmao
---
Most people succumb to him simply due to being nervous/overwhelmed. If you're composed then he's generally pretty easy, got through with him on the first attempt with 75 range
---
Sounds like you’re projecting your shitty outlook on others. Judging by your post history I think I’m correct here. Just quit already and stop being so damn miserable.
---
No I'm just testing some things
---
My opinion:
---
Everything doesnt have to be best moneymaker or xp to be worth. Gg got one of the coolest pets in game, as well as the cannonball buff perc.
---
Normal gargoyles however needs a decent nerf, maybe remove most alchables (but keep ores/bars) OR something like that..
---
Because that's way easier to keep track of than the mage the prior wave...

it’s pretty fun and it doesn’t take a super long time, at least for me.

---
You have no idea of their financial situation or how comfortable they are.  Half a year with no work is doable for some.  Hell half a year with no work and then going back to low wage until you find a well paying job isn't is doable for some too.
---
Flying wasn't until TBC, but yeah, lots will be grinding for epic mounts. Could see it thought, grinding has taken on a different meaning since it was originally used in MMO's lol.
---
Why does it have to be "consistent?" Isn't that more boring than having a variety of boss mechanics that aren't all the same? Idk I think we just have an irreconcilable philosophical differences as to what makes the game good. It feels like you're just salty that someone with fewer hours in the game can do the same content slightly easier which I just do not have a problem with

for normal people a lot of people will stop before level 30 for sure

Mat is Savage as hell
---
Snail swaps
---
A lot of people prefer to do it slowly rather than efficiently, so I wouldn't worry too much. Efficient slayer is a lot of forcing the same tasks over and over, which I don't think a lot of players like. But if you're curious about blocks/skips it's:  
---
  
---
Blocklist: Abbysal demons, kraken, hellhounds, greater demons and 2 shitty weight 8 tasks so gargs, black demons, wyrms or drakes.
---
Do with bracelet of slaughter: Smoke devils, nechs, dust devils (all barrage), kalphites, dagganoths (cannon).
---
do with expeditious bracelet: Trolls at jatitzo, suqahs (cannon), dark beasts (melee with cannon), black dragons (babies for quick points).
---
   
---
Skip everything else.  
---
Now, it may be hard to maintain parity on points until you unlock every task, but since I've hit 93 I've been gaining points from streaks. Personally, I also barrage abbysal demons with expeditious because I'm missing the 6th block slot, and they're not too bad exp and they've been profitable from whip drops. It's just tough to find a world with both rooms free. I also do steel drags with expeditious since they take like 5-10 minutes with ancestral and trident. I also barrage ankous with expeditious because they take 5 minutes or less.

Minnows are like 300k go an hour I think so a long ass time

---
"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂
---
My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂

That's terrible logic. Why play the game if in the end you're gonna quit eventually anyway?

It's because people enjoy how normal things feel slightly risky. It's fun as long as you go in with the mentality that it's not gonna last forever

Honestly if their work ethic is that bad, they will probably just buy gold or bonds when they need to start getting the more expensive gear.

You know where Jad will spawn for 60 waves, that's not really something to "keep track of." And if Jad is going to spawn in a suboptimal spot you can just walk out and retry without using any resources
---
Since you are all so adamant that you would prefer to fight pkers let me ask this. If they made a version of the duel arena that gave your inventory and equipped to the winner of the fight would you do that instead of the wildy? If not, why?
---
Uhhh what whips are like a few mill mate. Are you talking about rs3?

Thanks for all the info, definitely gonna save this post for when I really delve into slayer

the player in the clip is not wielding an anti-shield so he got melted. that's how elvarg works.

You use Verac's full set against Wilderness bosses. If you get pk'ed you only lose the flail.

If you don’t want the rewards why would you be forced to grind the currency? Just don’t do it then if you don’t want the reward. No ones forcing you to do anything in this game.

Hey wait a second I’m back at the castle now and all my stuff is gone?
---
Why go that way in the first place? The Eastern entrance is a little bit further and way safer. Like there is this whole meme/joke about dying to those wizards that I don't understand. There are 4 entrances to Varrock only 1 of those is dangerous thus choose one of the other 3 to enter from.
---
I'm right where you are in my grind for my alt account - just hit 70/70/65 melee stats today.  I suggest watching this video for good afk advice https://youtu.be/Q0huAx4pGSk
---
With these stats I can make it about 2.5-3 hours before running out of absorption pots.  This is with full obsidian, obby sword, berserker necklace, and rune kiteshield.
---
For lasting even longer, wear full rune or dragon armor to push your defence up.  In full rune I last about 3.5-4 hours before running out, but the exp/hour is lower (44k in rune vs 52k in obby).
---
This is all with absorptions and super combat pots, with interacting for about twenty seconds every 15 minutes from my phone to desktop.
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land
---

Yeah yeah, I know, now take my 10k, put on that rune skirt, and start dancing already.

Do it until it’s done, no brakes just smash through it. Eventually you will  get it, especially with dragon darts you can plough through the caves in like 50 mins

I was just being a dick with that comment sorry dude. I know that you can run more than one client I was just wondering if this person had multiple monitors just as a curiosity. I mean I myself could never devote that much time to this so mad props to  whoever can. And I guess by saying "what kind of set up does this take." I made myself sound like an idiot but it was more of a curiosity as to what kind of setup this person had and not so much a question of weather you could run it on one pc/monitor.
---
I was clearly talking about the nature of PvP...not that specific situation, regardless of its a "competitive" situation or not doesnt have anything to do with it anyway tbh. People will talk trash regardless, its just how it is in every game with PvP. 
---
&gt; From what I've seen, the people who prey on unarmed, lower level people in the wild aren't the people who do competitive pvp.
---
People arent going around looking for unarmed people to kill, most PKers will attack someone because its a simple matter of why not? Takes all of 30 seconds, waste virtually no supplies and theres a chance they have something of worth on them. If they dont have anything? Who cares, youve "wasted" 30 seconds. Theres no down side to attacking them, it has nothing to do with "competitive" PvP, plenty of the best PKers in the game will do it does that mean they are therefore not interested in competitive PvP? Its just not a logical argument.
---
I string gold amulets, about 140k exp per hour
---
I found it easier to learn without one of those rotation chart things. It takes too much attention away from the fight and people usually get distracted and die. All you need to do is see what color it is, change your prayer immediately, then change gear as fast as you can then attack. Don’t worry about the exact spot to stand, just obviously stay away from the gas

How did you appeal the macroing ban???
---
I also had a main (total level like 1600 ish?) that I took a months long break, then when I tried logging in on him again he was perma banned due to macroing (which I've never done anything like that). There was nowhere to appeal and I wasn't able to see the evidence of why I was banned.
---
Too bad it’s really a man 😂
---
Nice false equivalency you are trying to push. Pures don't have an advantage over main accounts, defense is very useful. They are only good against other accounts their level because of a quirk in the combat calculator. Honestly if they wanted to fix that I wouldn't mind, but it isn't ACTIVELY PUNISHING people like wintertodt does. This entire game is about progression, so yes I am going to point at one of the only things in the game that punishes you for progression. (The only other thing I can think of off the top of my head is the twisted bow in pvp)
---
I really thought it was gonna land on a horse.
---
You could realistically learn everything except for olm very easily by yourself.
---
Only try to learn olm solo if you really really hate yourself. It's a biiiiiiiiitch.
---
Wrong. You can still pk them, and if you cant go back to playing your ironman. People with Bulwarks tend to risk 5x if not more than the average PvMer in the wilderness. I honestly think the Bulwark is perfect where it sits. It’s a defence shield. Thats what it should be.

I just finished this on my ironman last night actually. I really didn't want to come back later with a high HP so I pushed through, but it made for a boring 2 or 3 weeks. I wanted to quest and train other levels but was limited by wanting to keep my HP as low as possible. I took breaks every now and then to train other random skills, farming, mlm because it's afk etc. For me it was worth it in the long run so I wont have to come back and use 10x as much food but it's definitely not worth it if you get burnt out over it.

It's possible he wants to consult which means work part time, If he had a high paying job he might have enough of a nest egg to retire fully but doesn't want to just yet so he'd rather retire from Jagex and consult at another company for extra cash to go on vacations and stuff.

Lol don't take my seriously, I'm just bored. Good luck with your series
---
No... why would it be? There's just no reason to, they drop the worthless seeds.
---
What do you consider high ranked in those games? D:
---
&gt; Yeah, their items lost on death screen reads 100k+. Woopdie doo. I'm sure they and their team of 5 maxed friends in singles have a serious chance of actually losing that as they dog-pile the dude with Dinh's, who's items lost on death screen reads 2m+.
---
So this situation your describing is 100% of PvP interaction and situations? Your argument is flawed in every way possible.
---
And youre trying to claim that PvMers with dinhs always risk 2m+? What? I thought people like you always tried to argue that PVMers dont risk anything? So wouldnt it actually be a GOOD idea for those PKers to risk 100k for 2m risk? Whats wrong with that anyway? And PKers only risk 100k all the time? Even if that were true, thats STILL more risk than any PvMer experiences in PvM.
---
Also not sure if youre trying to insinuate that PKers only attack PVMers? Ever been to 44s? Id assume you havent. PKers die to other pkers ALL the time in the wildy, and also have to worry about getting hit by a team all the time because people cant even 1v1 fight anymore at 44s or Altar. Youre honestly just completely out of touch with what goes on in the wilderness with PKers, not sure why youre trying to make an extremely flawed and silly argument about something you clearly do not know or understand much about.

Huh, I was almost sure they weren’t anywhere close to making out

I made a female iron*woman* account just so I could walk around asking for free stuff and for them to trade me. F2P players were so confused to why they couldn't trade me.

Was it the one where they just attached obsidian pieces to a sword? Or like made the whole sword.

Looking back on it my reply was not very funny. I’ll take away my downvote.

They took a huge amount of community feedback and polled (almost) every update that came into the game.

This is the kind of shit I came here for to Begin with.

Main 2 things. First was a massive overhaul of the combat system that happened in 2012. Osrs uses the old combat style and never added the overhauled combat style. The second is micro transactions. These were added into Runescape but never into osrs. What it really comes down to is that all changes made to osrs are polled. There are poll booths in every bank in the game for players to vote on different potential changes to osrs. We decide where the dev time is spent. That’s why people are pretty satisfied with the state of osrs and keep coming back for more.
---
It’s okay we’ve located the sociopath

To be fair, RS is wildly different than those games. Also, out of curiosity, what do you consider 'extremely high ranked'.

Gimmie that heads man :)

Because making amethyst scale for price to dart ratio would make the current price skyrocket and blowpipe is already pretty powerful as it is.
---
Your defense is really low especially with a torso. 2-3 kills isn't that surprising. I think range can work but blowpipe isn't cost effective and im going to assume you don't have a tbow
