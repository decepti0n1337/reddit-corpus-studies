I've been playing for 3 months, on and off, and still rocking rune cause shit takes forever when you play only a few hours at a time and want to do quests or grind agility for a miserable week.
---
The ultimate crime
---
Unplayable.
---
first of all, good players don't really adjust their timings when hitting a shield or something, they just press L at a timing that covers both hitting and not hitting. second of all, I don't have any trouble L-canceling, nor did I dislike it when I had to learn it. I just got convinced that it's a superfluous, unnecessary requirement that doesn't involve any decision-making. in an alternate universe where there was no l-canceling, and somebody suggested it as a mechanic, you would think it's just as absurd as me suggesting it for other non-aerial attacks.
---
[removed]
---
Ty again, nothing too interesting, how was the quiz?
---
Too expensive I guess lol.
---
Some new players end up getting to 15 attack before realising can switch attack styles. Don’t overestimate a new players knowledge.
---
You can have my hot cakes ;)
---
Summer classes are by far the hardest I've ever taken. Took calc 2 last summer and it felt like I had a full class load
---
Like actually have to use the sextant, watch and chart!
---
This is just another gamergate! We aren't even allowed to shit ourselves anymore. Fucking SJW moms.
---
If you have a girl that'd turn down sex cause of an OSRS mat, bruh.
---
Even then it's a stretch
---
Upvote
---
Wooot
---
Good to see them explicitly address the whole alts voting thing—it was clearly always just a conspiracy theory against this nebulous group of “maxed neckbeards against Warding”, and disproprionately fractured the community relative to any actual effects of alts voting
---
They also don't have easy access to warhammers.
---
If you are Venezuelan then you are now the king of Venezuela!
---
Damn dwh tanking hard. It was 60m when I got mine.
---
Too real.
---
But by that same logic if it ‘make sense’ you should also have change the Dragon Warhammer’s attack requirement.
---

---
Anyway I see what you mean it can make sense it I just think that all metal weapon should have a consistent attack requirement as there is no need to confuse new player and they will quickly move on from this weaponry.
---
Depends on room rotation and more, would be interesting
---
Just remember to mainly focus on jad and kill healers as you have time for it
---
Theiving and rc fighting for the tears exp, is this my account?
---
Go to Kourend dungeon for that task, people always cannon, can’t at combs
---
They fixed modifying slayer tasks to tasks that don’t exist this week. Made a list of all the existing ones and compare it.
---
So you can’t do !kc urmom or custom !tasks
---
Clup pengween

The Grand Exchange is pretty easy access imo.

there is no way using guthans is faster then banking when banking takes like 10 seconds every 2~ chests

PKers, how did you get into PKing? I'd really like to get into it, but the skill curve is somewhat daunting. Not to mention the high cost of gear that you risk on pretty much any fight. I'd like to test the waters at some point, but don't really know where to begin. Any good sources of info or general tips?
---
You take this game way too seriously
---
I love this too!
---
Kinda reminds me of playing Minecraft for the first time actually.
---
Not knowing anything about the game. Its kinda exiting! :D
---
&gt;So now you've changed what you said/think to not agree with me?
---
No?
---
well use the bis range you can and tanky shield and mask would be fine ill help with some of the inv set up
---
Commenting so I can check this later
---
I dont know what asf means but I ain't reading that shit.
---
2h has a higher max hit but scimitar are the best dps by far
---
IDK what weapons you have but take the [Rune 2h Sword](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_2h_sword) vs. [Rune Scimitar](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_scimitar)
---
The R2H is +70 Strength, 1 attack per 4.2s, Scimitar is +44 Strength, 1 attack per 2.4s, if you divide it, then it works out to 16.67 for the R2H, 18.33 for the Scim, meaning that the attack speed gives the edge to the scimitar, with the gap increasing as your strength level increases and you wear gear with more strength bonuses.
---
Why are you so aggressive?
---
I have worked in digital design previously, so i guess.. that? :p
---
Will start to use phone tho, noted! Is it fine if its old tho? I feel it would  kinda defeat the point if its a modern phone and the photo is actually good :/
---
Try a different totem
---
I found it very amusing. Thank you
---
18 guthan pl8s and only 3 torags hammer thats what i call *balance*
---
Nice
---
Longest time without a shit was like 5-6 days I don't remember much because I was on opiates from a broken arm that was gross. It took 2 days after taking laxatives before I could shit.
---
Holy hell this comment gave me a flashback!
---
&gt;Oh shit lol, just realised this all started because you were upset that irons have their friends help them at bandos. You then started to say that this is against the rules ~~but couldn't~~ and then provided a citation which I accepted
---
FTFY lol
---
You are looking at damage. Yes a 2H does more damage. But the important stat is damage PER SECOND. Which factors in time. So the scimmy is better as it attacks almost twice as fast doing more damage overall in a given timeframe. 
---
Scimmy is better
---
Really? I swear I checked and I couldn’t...
---
2.3k chests looted..9 year old CC, the fuck is the point of this?

Spamclick agility? Where at?

Holy fuck is that you.

---
MFW people play a MMORPG with tens of thousands of people on a fixed number of servers yet complain about competition.
---
Very sanitary.
---
what are the stats for a rune long sword?
---
Herb and Birdhouse runs are amazing at the low-mid levels for profit. You can easily make enough to maintain a bond with some surplus by doing them 2+ times a day if that gives you an idea on the kind of profit you'd be making. They're also pretty quick, to do both takes maybe 10 minutes total so yeah.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just youtube some guides for herb runs and birdhouse runs, they're pretty easy to understand and get started in.
---
I actually had a lot of fun failing the obstacle in MEP2 120+ times.
---
Make sure the camera quality is as shitty as possible. The people on here will eat it up.

---
Someone can tag jagex support here for me or moderators
---
And no response lmao
---
I think it has because someone else had that issue with a halberd and everyone was shitting on him.
---
Fuck this post, you, and your cc
---
No ur mom ;_;
---
 My advice is to sell your pair of iron legs (g) and buy some runes to train magic so you can teleport around instead of walking around.
---
Drop any spare Yommi seeds in your inventory before switching totems :) Relogging might help if that isn't it, too.
---
Also remember to pray melee before the switch!
---
If you're a non ironman (or high level IM), the bludgeon is better, but if you are I'd recommend the cudgel+zam book offhand for vetion and whip/scim+zam book for callisto.
---
I've done a fair bit of doloing at Bandos before, so I don't think APM would be an issue. But I could also just prayer flick at Sara, which would probably be just as effective or better.
---
Why wouldn't Zammy work though?
---
I had completely missed that tbh. I just saw a UIM and the title made me think we was going in. Ty for clarifying.
---
Lighthouse is where ya go only to cannon lol. Like others said, catacombs if you're gonna melee. 
---
You should really cannon the task regardless though. Super fast.
---
Very cool kanye, thank you
---
welcome
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rune_longsword
---
Has the same problem, 25% slower attacks but only ~10% more damage per hit, so the damage per second is worse than the Scimitar and the gap continues to widen as you equip more gear.
---
People have determined that the Scimitar is by far the best weapon type to use (except at level 50 when the Granite Hammer is better) and after level 70 where weapons start to diversify.
---
It’s like you want this to become RS3
---
Seercull i legit didnt even know was still in the game l0l until i had to buy one for an elite.
---
Its being nerfed already announced
---
Speak to Oziach in Edgeville
---
&gt;I don't care enough to be bothered asking anything, but I do care enough to let you know how much I don't care
---
Avernic is one of the very last things u should buy lance blows it away
---
Speak for yourself. I did my part and voted no on 10 alts. fuck warding and fuck new skills. 
---
We have enough already and you reddit crybabies probably don't even have high runecrafting so why are you asking for more?
---
Tekton, you get it from a dust drop in challenge mode raids 1 and it let's you transmog the oml pet
---
Olm pet with metamorphic dust morphed to tekton
---
Reminds me of Saradomin, Guthix and Zamorak from left to right
---
The Venezuelan economy is so grossly inflated that playing/botting in osrs and then RWTing the gold is a viable income.
---
The point of chainbody and med helms is that theyre a stepping stone. They are cheaper, and thus weaker than the counterparts. This is intended and should not be changed.
---
Well you can take a screenshot which is better than 90% of the community
---
Is that brimstone ring? I thought people liked it
---
I just hit 70s on my str atk and def so I was wondering what armor I should pursue now? I already have a fighters torso, helm of neiz, d defender, d legs, and d boots. I was thinking barrows armour cause I saw swamp man grind for the set
---
I might take you up on that offer as well for the CC. Started a new ironman and it's been a year or so since I played old school. Came back to 3 for double xp last Feb I believe it was after a year off. Stopped playing after 99 mining and grinding for fishing through March or April. But old school is what I remember.
---
Sorry you waited mate. There were only 3 others that came, so you didn’t miss anything too crazy. Perhaps I can offer you some genetically modified apples as compensation?
---
You're doing great!
---
Fashionscape is on point so you’re doing something right
---
Is that the Elven Signet? I wouldn't say that needs a buff. The rest all could use some tweaks at the very least. Personally, I don't think the Seercull or Hydra Tail need that much of a buff. The Seercull should just aim to be a decent level 50 bow, nothing crazy. The Hydra Tail should just give the Dragonbone Necklace a small buff like Power Ammy stats (keeping its prayer of course).
---
The Scepter is the only one that 100% needs a major buff. I picked one up the other day and decided to try it at Scorpia... It is really bad. Aside from the built in spell ideas, I think another way it could be buffed it to let it auto-cast Ancients while charged (or just in general) and in the wilderness, in addition to its damage boost, give it a 50% chance to make your spell cost no runes at the cost of an additional ether. At the moment, it costs an extra 177 gp per cast due to the Ether on top of the existing rune costs, which is a ton compare to tridents; if it could cut down on the costs that would help... But it also could use more damage to better compete with trident.
---
How I slept after finding out the tbow glitch happened while I was at work
---
99 mining, dragon pickaxe. Team size varied often between 4-8 people.
---
A window shaped cabinet
---
Venezuela's economy inflation made selling gold in Runescape a viable job. Pixels aside, this game is supporting plenty of real life's.
---
4 iq move
---
How long is an average raid? 30ish minutes?
---
wow
---
At what point did you realize this could be a real job for you? I'm sure you didn't just wake up after doing it for a while thinking it could be what it is for you today.
---
Mole pet when
---
Nice work. I hate it.
---
I see where you're coming from but I think having options is a good thing. Maybe it shouldn't be BIS in most or all occasions but it should be a viable second-best. Especially for ironmen or broke players.
---
How is giving dead content some value like RS3?
---
Depends on your view
---
In depth quests, tons of content, a insanely functional and vibrant economy (at least rn) and not a huge barrier for entry 
---
I do enjoy it and I don’t think it’s trash Bc I enjoy it more than other stuff I’ve played
---
That’s actually a really good idea
---
Never done a skill of the week event. But I'm leveling woodcutting right now and this will be a bit of added motivation.
---
Do we join a discord or is there a reddit thread where we do a bit of smack talk and encouragement or bragging?
---
oh i guess that would work too, yeah
---
no need to be passive aggressive
---
Absolutely phenomenal
---
You have to be 13 to play the game? Reported.
---
Wrong sub for that, bud.
---
33
---
^/r/counting
---
start with an f2p pure to learn basic mechanics, or i guess wait for the full release of lms
---
I would love to see atleast the war hammers get polled. This could potentially make f2p and f2p pking fun again
---
250k/set
---
don't think so for playlists, but you can set your music to loop so it isn't silent after the song ends
---
I think the worst types of people are the one's who think they're entitled to you giving them a bond just because you look like you have money. A guy was begging me for a bond and when I told him its only 7 dollars he responded by calling me selfish lmfao.
---
if you have barrows gloves already get 99 str and torso and u can dh pk
---
Sometimes when I fart I poop a little.
---
He meant they don't have the specific formula for when your burn rate hits 0, not that there isn't one at all.
---
why not just get a scythe drop? lol
---
Makes it tough to pk melee fights I guess but it’s a way to pk so can’t hate on them. Besides a low level like that is a risk in deeper wildy
---
This made me lol
---
I remember first starting out that the damn Vampire was so hard to kill
---
Really like the ideas. These weapons need something to prevent them from being absolutely dead content.
---
1.300M = 1.3b in some places
---
the original comment in this chain is poking fun as 1.300M in some places would mean only 1300k
---
I'd say it was very smart of you. 
---
I'd literally sell everything I could to shops, that was my way of making cash
---
Took me months to get 10k
---
need? why do they NEED a buff?
---
I remember crying in my bedroom from being so pumped up with my headphones on ready to take on the fucking world.
---
Jagex needs to investigate ASAP
---
Why ring of suffering?   Is it better than the other zenyte stuff if you can only afford one?
---
milk truk just arrive
---
It'd be nice to make them **somewhat** viable even if they're never on the same level as scimitars. Right now they're just absolute jokes and they're almost never used because OSRS has fewer true newbs.
---
You realize he’s probably just clicking back and fourth to stall the run animation because he’s bored... not botting...
---
Ping should be better in sophenam
---
Imo they should just flat out have no negative bonuses. No -magic defense, no -ranged or -magic accuracy.
---
!remindme 2 days

you tryna get pked?

I know that there has to be one. I’m just surprised that the formula is not on any wiki or forum

6/10. Shoulda gone with granite legs and boots
---
Nerfing is usually worse than buffing the low tier weapons. Current content is based around bis weapons at the moment and you'd have to need bosses as well.
---
Grand exchange
---
I do though its not easy at my stats. I just feel like this should be giving something more than nothing. The wc guild's invisible +7 boost is probably comparable to this and that just requires 60wc and nothing else
---
op what do you say me and you take that commenter out back and kick his ass?  this post was funny and the man should read it.  hes going to spend the next 3 hours scrolling around reddit he might aswell read this
---
This is so sad.
---
The Grand Exchange is your best option. Its located in varrock. Best way to find it is to press the world icon under your minimap.
---
Even as someone who plays OSRS often I don't get this joke jus sayin
---
The plague was real after all😂
---
Remember when RS2 came out and Jagex said they had balanced all the melee weapons so that everyone wouldn’t just be using the same weapon (r2h). Obvious pretty much immediately that rune scim was the new r2h and has never been rebalanced. 
---
Wouldn’t hurt to make some changes, really only impacts f2p anyway.
---
Ahh, Milwaukee
---
Eleventy hundred pennies!
---
Then tell him to stop being so hot
---
Just buy it on the GE
---
10 kc, i was with him, thats why his reaction was so weird i was just under 2k then
---
bots dont sell at the general store, they buy at low alch price, which is like 1 gp for maples. its most likely an ironman who got it from miscellenia and didnt want to fletch them all
---
I own one and don’t know what it is. I do know that right click is annoying as fuck the way it is though.
---
This would make the rune warhammer the f2p meta for range/melee pure pking.....fuck it. Support
---
Lance
---
That's like a rat pad if anything
---
Btw, speed is inversely proportional to the interval
---
So you meant to give maces the same speed as scimitars: 6
---
Hey i see you in ricecups videos, hope to see you get one in one of the vids!!!
---
The difference is you could effectively get 99 rc by training warding.
---
Yes. This is finally back ive ben looking for this video for a while.
---
How's he compare to the other skilling bosses in terms of drops?
---
While I agree that they're shit tasks, there hasn't been overwhelming pressure on Jagex to do something about them to the degree that they addressed Fossil Wyverns. That exorbitant, targeted block is an admission on their part that the task should never have been on slayer lists to start with...
---
...which begs the question, why not just take them off instead of slapping a 500-pt fee on some weird toggle that you might find on some kind of private server?
---
I remember hearing that RS3 was attempting to do something to make the variety of weapons not pointless, granted these all sound far less extreme and more well fit for OSRS. It'd be different if they currently fit a niche, but when the only people using a mace are utterly new players and Caveman Only's monk, it really says something.
---
Yeah what finally did it for me was practicing on jad simulator with 500 ms delay, I realized I was panicking when the prayer wouldn't switch and it's just lag, after that I was able to calm down enough during healers to tag them one by one and then go back to jad, I tanked them all at the same time though since I had the bastion potion
---
Gauntlet takes 10 mind and gets about 3-7. Zalcano is about 4 mind getting 0-6 ish on average
---
You should look up the Chmystry raids 1 progression guide. It’s pretty solid.
---
Protect from melee is the best defence prayer for melee :^)
---
What /u/ModWilliam said, but also you can imbue it at NMZ for some good stats to help defensively. Not having to worry about recoil charges is really the main reason it helps, though. Plus, it frees up inventory space, instead of holding backup recoils.
---

---
Woka floka flame
---
ya that what I came to the conclusion when I decided to look at it on the wiki to be sure. Way slower than a shortbow to make those 2 spaces worthless unless you really need a safespot i guess? Maybe?
---
Why can’t people accept that sometimes things are just dead content? You can do like 3 quests and gain enough xp to never touch one of these weapons and that’s ok.
---
You are one sick pup!😈
---
Isn’t it not against the rules anymore?
---
Nah it's alright
---
I thought you get it from trimming armor at the GE? Can you also do this by bank selling? Can you also do this by buying gf?
---
That's true, but the f2p headslot items are quite limited.
---
Na just do it with trusted freinds. Just beacuse it could happen doesn’t mean we should scrap the whole thing beacuse some people may trust the wrong person.
---
I'm more curious about the neck beards who actually buy the gold from the Venezuelans. What's going on in their lives
---
nonsense. mvp is just little extra loot along with a max reward potiential greater drop table roll
---
Thog dont care
---
I got a couple 99 wc without pets
---
stop snitching
---
I want the pet more than the ele
---
It's pretty grindy, so I'd you really want to get into it you either have to enjoy grinding, or be willing to afk (something like osrs in background while doing something else like watching TV)
---
The assumption that maxed players don't want a new skill because they're done with the game is pretty flawed– these are people who like to challenge themselves and grind shit out, and who love the game. Some voted yes, some voted know. We don't know the percentage of those who did and those who didn't, but I bet it's pretty fucking close to the general population.
---
Yes but you risk that 23m every trip without one. Imo it makes no sense not to use a regular glory, as you want to be using full graceful and switching to an abyssal bracelet to avoid being skulled.
---
Once you have the dust from challenge mode (and the olm pet, ofc) you can morph it into any cox boss as you please.
---
BET!
---
Depending on if you can,doing the morytania hard diary will help get you consistent profit, but does require some levels and questing. (For example, 66 agility and 70 prayer.)
---
I think Runescape is actually the perfect game to make every weapon/armor have a niche because this all adds depth and strategy to the game. 
---
Outside of this the game is relatively simple and adding strategy like this is way better than stuff like 1.5t and other "skill cap" stuff Jagex has been doing. 
---
In addition to that it would be cool to see people wearing all different types of gear around the world based on what they're doing and their personal style.
---
If you have the capital, elemental battlestaves are the way to go. A little profit and huge buy limits
---
Why would you want to watch it. Look at that girl, she looks 12.
---
Well, Jad is one the easiest bosses of runescape. You should you seek psychiatric help tbh.
---
How long did this take to render? What engine did you use?
---
This is fucked
---
If you’ll notice my advice was not to start with a pure at all, but his main. 
---
And apart from etiquette genuinely I don’t think there’s much overlap that you can’t get from pvm too. 
---
Tick eating, switches, barrage stacks, etc are all fundamental parts of pking and you can’t learn those on F2P
---
[lol best I could do](https://imgur.com/VRyGICF)

Very nice! Got away safely? Don't forget to insure it

---
Selling fishes getting bitches
---
I personally did my first run with prossy over range, as I wanted high prayer bonus to save money on prayer potions, depends if you care about money that much.
---
What are you talking about? There are four bosses in GWD. I have no clue who Nex is!
---
Nice.
---
sir this is catherby bank
---
I thought there was something off about him until he started shitting himself, tbh
---
Gauntlet is supposed to be like gwd, not good loot if you don't get uniques. Shame that Crystal Armour is useless
---
No instead they played a shitty college trivia night game for half the fucking stream
---
Don’t iron men have separately stocked shops vs normal accounts?
---
Where can buy the neon under glow?
---
No
---
The first couple kc can be a bit of a pain, but for sure better than not learning at all, also join a clan and try for teams there, way better people and less frustration compared to ffas, i regret not doing it sooner.
---
the price gets cheaper and cheaper as you keep selling. you only get the full 32gp for like the first 10
---
You literally cannot win with skillers. You want a high gp/hr activity, that isn’t super afk, and doesn’t devalue ehp methods. And you don’t want pvm to bring in more resources per hour than Skilling, but you complain when a Skilling method out performs another Skilling method. Like Jesus Christ. What magical Christmas time solution do you want. Zalcano is a step in the right direction for Profitable Skilling methods. I only wish Zalcano required more skill and game knowledge than it currently does. Than it could stay a more elite money making method over a longer period of time.
---
I don’t find it too bad at all
---
i remember when my monitor looked a tube too
---
Low-key the best part of the whole outfit. It makes the gilded outlines more continuous and (along with the gloves) adds some variety to the yellows, which both add to the Tekton look.
---
Hey man as no one has posted I thought I’d say congrats! I’m on an Ironman and this grind is on my soon to do lists. Good luck with the other drops!
---
Whats up petrol enema.

It does the most dps, but it’s expensive to use. Don’t worry about the blowpipe till you get to the fight caves

If you enjoy the cosmetic look, might as well wait and get the rune (g) set when you hit 40 def since that won’t be long from now.

Telealching to camelot with a decent profit alch is around 2gp/xp and a very reliable 140k xp/hour

&gt;Med helms could use some love. They have lower magic and ranged attack penalties than full helms, but not enough to matter. It's a tough one to get it right, but I think I'd remove magic defence penalty and increase one of the bonuses to match or surpass full helm (slash? stab?).
---
Crush, obviously. med is the bicycle helmet

I mean it helped me tank like 5 other attacks since it was a team, the problem was i was completely out of food and had 1 prayer dose left cause it was gonna be my last kill of the day, i even only had 50 charged craw's shots left
---
3 generations in one pic
---
Yes RuneLite is your best bet. Plugins to enable are GPU, ground items, unlimited/vertical zoom. On https://osrs.wiki there is an optimal quest guide which is what you might be referring to.
---
I don't insist on the name, they could add a new type of attack that trains all stats and increases the speed. Basically a melee equivalent to "rapid".
---
But I agree that this change might be the most controversial. The thing is, slash weapons are already pretty saturated and I'm not sure what else could be done to promote longsword usage, other than making it stronger than currently used weapons - and we don't want that.
---
cooking and wc
---
He didn't pk them in the abyss.
---
Do people actually do this
---
That's specifically why I didn't want to modify dragon weapons at all. I feel like all of them find their uses at certain point of the game due to quest requirements and special attacks.
---
It's called fashionscape. Look it up.
---
Forgot what Jmod posted this but they're looking to increase it to 50 hits per shard, idk how much of a difference that's gonna make.
---
Got 99 cooking, are redwoods comparably AFK to barb?
---
Lmao
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide
---
If you wanna download runelite do it from its official website runelite.net; check their official twitter for links if you wanna be extra safe
---
True, but it does not mean 70% of the weapons should be much weaker for no reason.
---
That’s a good point. I’ve been receiving a lot of backlash for trying to obtain this piece of code, but really I just want to know when I can start cooking swordfish and higher fish in hosidius with my gauntlets and maximize xp gains. I know I can start before the non-burn levels but idk by how many levels.
---
1) it doesn’t matter if Jad gets to 100% health if you don’t kill the healers.  This means you basically have infinite time to tag the healers.  Switch to long range, then just click each healer then click back to Jad.  Bring bastion potions (you only need 1-2) so you have boosted def to help tank the healers
---
2) Practice on the Jad Simulator website (its for rs3 Jad but basically the same) with 500 ms delay, you’ll learn to calm down and just weave stuff between the prayer switches, a good test is to do med supplies and run out all your prayer without missing a prayer switch (while using the restores)
---
If you get bad loot as mvp that's just bad rng like you get loads of runes but they are only worth sub 100k, not game's fault.
---
Shitty bait, thats like 10 raids raids done post log
---
Were you MVP when you got tool seed? Is MVP required for it?
---
Thanks for all the comments. I got the email secure and the account unbanned!!!
---
you're way too interested in something so irrelevant, besides jmods don't read this thread
---
They’re so comfy hahaha
---
A new kind of attack could be introduced. But I'll be honest, even if just maces and warhammers got buffed, I'd be happy.
---
I completely agree, my point was that we don't necessarily have to teach players every intricacy of weapon niches because they're just going to use what's cool any ways.
---
I really like your suggestion because I can still find ways and builds to make a rune warhammer into a viable weapon.
---
Are you telling me you don't tribrid at the soul altar on your 40 attack failed initiate pure?
---
You're missing out on the best this game has to offer, maybe you'd have more fun over on rs3.
---
Become a member and do Waterfall Quest.
---
That seems extremely normal for a multilogger. "Why you lying" about him being a prolific botter?
---
dragonfire ward barely makes a difference against the antidragon shield anyways
---
only 1.3m?
---
Thanks for making these OP.
---
He should ditch the helmet and go for a Mr T look.
---
Check on the wiki. Pretty sure they have a table that shows cost/ xp and +/- profit for each piece.
---
Off hand i know usually gold rings and necklaces sell for a profit
---
Buffing the prayer bonus on mace but not the dps would have them remain dead content. It could be +100 prayer bonus and people still wouldn't use it for combat (would be useful in skilling situations, but that's beside the point and not really desirable anyway). The best you can get out of it in f2p would be a very long-lasting +15% attack/str boost, which isn't worthwhile since it's less than the dps lost by opting to not using a scim.
---
If it's not viable in this extremely exaggerated example, there's no way anything that would realistically be implemented would have a chance.
---
Buy enough gold and gems for 1 of each you can do, make them all, sell them. Make what you get best margin on
---
Yea for optimal xp bosses you need to have done a few specific quests. Check out the wiki [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nightmare_Zone/Strategies)
---
Worth doing though because its super AFK, up to 20 mins at a time with the right setup and points are important for imbues as well
---
They updated some text on it not too long ago [last year](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Spellbook_Rework,_Wise_Old_Man_and,_Increased_Zoom).
---
&gt; We’ve adjusted text that referred to the game as RuneScape, clarifying that the game is Old School RuneScape and the world is Gielinor. With two games on the market, both called RuneScape, we’d been finding a large amount of confusion from new players who’d landed in the wrong one.
---
But if you're specifically asking when the word itself was invented, nobody really knows but it's 15 years old or more for sure.
---
MVP adds a grand total of around 15k on avg. That's 6-7M pf the 113M price check that does nor even account for the tool seeds being 20M+ atm.
---
Good call on the wiki
---
Not sure if it’s the “knight” that does it, i’ve seen a lot of games censor night/knight because the filter detects “nig” and doesn’t like it so it refuses to let you keep it.
---
Burning your wealth is not good for the economy.
---
You won't bid up that money to the product of someone else's gameplay farming whatever.
---
Inflation is not terrible in the game, making gp balances out with making items. We would be talking about all non-consumables suffer inflation thats why phats sinked most wealth in rs2.
---
Found the botter
---
What's with the clipping of your right arm and shoulder?
---
However if variations where those 3 letters aren’t together are ALSO censored then yeah i have zero idea, sorry
---
Gotta take what you can get when you can't hang with real pkers.
---
wow i didn't even notice it was mj
---
Reported for abusing NSFW
---
Do slayer then you're training without realizing it.
---
Instead of changing longswords, we could also make all hastae 4 ticks (currently only the dragon and Zamorak ones are 4, rest are 5) and make them f2p. F2p actually lacks a method to train on controlled (not that it's important or anything, just something I noticed), since scimitars have a huge accuracy penalty when used on controlled.
---
K.
---
You can also vegetable other players
---
Hey everyone,
---
I finally achieved my first goal, getting barrows gloves, fire cape, fighter torso and dragon defender + some decent gear. This was my final goal as I started playing a few months ago. Right now I dont feel like having that many goals anymore, I dont really like questing so quest cape wont be happenning, but I was curious if any of you had some nice goals I could work towards :)
---
I checked a couple of different names ending it with Knight and they were allowed but something about the word Argon when paired with Knight/Nite/Night/Nighte etc trips the restriction
---
I'd do slayer and see where it takes you.
---
Ammonite crabs at Fossil island (best) or Sandcrabs at Zeah.
---
Eoc was a blowjob made me have a hearty chuckle
---
https://i.imgur.com/0EqIvyb.png
---
didn't bother checking t3 but t1 and t2 both give str xp
---
How bout i do it anyway
---
i still enjoy tob regardless of my situation u will love it especially if u got friends to do it with
---
Yeah but currently I want a fast way. And then I will look into slayer.
---
Downvote this guy to hell.
---
Holy fuck that metric of comparison
---
No cuz you dont get pets often but even I as Iron insure every of my pets
---
no 500k is nothing, even if you have every pet in the game its less than 25m

/u/Padaz linked a great article for a quest order. Otherwise I'd say just have a look at storylines that interest you and follow those series.
---
Keep doing gods work my friend. One day the bots give up! ;-)
---
Come on bro.. it’s up to you.  Nobody is making you insure it, if you lose it you lose it.  Just get another one later.
---
Full justiciar and zammy spear vs dragon hunter lance and barrows for rune dragons?
---
Then pick flax til you can afford it lol
---
In the process of getting the pets, I'm sure you probably make the insurance money since making money in this game is pretty easy, just time consuming
---
Click rock
---
/u/JagexGambit has largely completed work on it, it was sent round internally for feedback, and that feedback is being implemented. 
---
It'll be with you soon (sorry to say that again).
---
Rice got his scythe at 645 kc though? That's not crazy low honestly as scythe is 1/173 droprate in trio's, so that makes it like 1/519?
---
Not WR, clan mate got 1kc scythe on pure but congrats!
---
Still worth checking yourself, the wiki' links to ge are cached. It's burnt me a few times fletching.
---
Are you sure you're using the same account for the same game? There is no difference between mobile and desktop OSRS accounts.
---
read up another thread to get my explanation of my total drops, this log is missing \~900 kc
---
1 yes
---
2 usually slash is better with a scim, but it depends on the monsters defense bonuses. 
---
3 thats where a rune 2h is more useful as it has a higher max hit and KO potential. However if its main accounts in single way f2p combat, the only way somebody is gunna die is if they intentionally risk or are very deep wildy.
---
4 no
---
We cleaned up some in-game text recently to make it consistent for lore, but I do remember reading the old [God letters](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/God_letters) when I was a teenager in the early 2000s and seeing reference to Gielinor.
---
Distract them all onto you. If you want to kill them break line of sight with jad then kill them. After that re-engage jad and claim your cape.
---
500k is nothing.
---
banned accounts don't get names released
---
oh wow, nice
---
its a meme, you know... sarcasm
---
That 25m can be better put into a..... idk... sgs?
---
Considering their rarity and that you can not buy them, the vast majority of people would say that the price to insure is always worth it.
---
It's not that i don't have the money....  
---
It's the money can be better spent upgrading gear.
---
I’ll mesh you nerd pull up castle plat insert random rag server number. I swear ark is the only game that compares to this one when it comes to toxicity.
---
Are you an AI dev?
---
I do.
---
per.
---
Its always been allowed because its never been enforced. Its just a trust thing, which ends up bad in some cases, so its just a headache for jagex when it does go badly. Now its at your own risk.
---
You speak like you get a few pets per week. What lvls and kc did you get yours?
---
You earn about 12 shards an hour, so take that as you will.
---
Start training Farming, good skill to make money and necessary for Fairy Rings
---
I got my skotizo at 14KC...
---
sure
---
The boss is not weak to anything. Mage is lowest dps against it because how magic defence is calculated
---
Sry, I sold them
---
Pixelated asses is nothing compared with the real deal, cmon now.
---
Apparently it turns out that using ultra compost gives the tree a 92% chance of survival, coupled with resurrect crops means it's very unlikely to die.
---
It actually works out cheaper to do that than it does to use the Dragonfruit, personally I'll just be spending the extra cash on Dragonfruit for convenience.
---
Not enough rebellious vibes.
---
A signed 32bit integer goes up to 2147M, same as max cash stack. No problem with datatypes, just engine work.
---
That literally only applies to ironmen and people who haven't done dragon slayer. There is no reason at all to be wearing a chainbody or a med helm in 2019.
---
Could you Expand on why it shouldn't be a skill? What do you think earns the Right to be a skill?
---
Reporting and ignoring them does  close to nothing. I reported some prominent rc bots a while back, took months for them to actually get banned.
---
Jagex need to step up their teams dedicated to perming these botters, scammers, and lurers.
---
It takes way too long to have an effect.
---
I'm so glad to hear!
---
the problem is when the bot makes any amount that is worth keeping it sets up a fake bet with the hosts gold-storage account and trade its over.
---
That's why you see some people use the bot 15 times in a row. It's cuz the bots making cash and trading it over.
---
Oh, they looked like addy gloves to me. I assumed he was 13def pure or something
---
Sorry to Hear
---
It's "nice" that people are breaking the rules, ruining the game? And you're encouraging that? Ridiculous.
---
Not enough fancy boots present
---
Best bit is when the music changed to that near the Al Kharid gate, you see someone over the bush asking if anyone has 10gp lmao
---
Glad that they got quarantined.
---
Thanks for the Feedback!
---
\&gt; though it is still susceptible to many of the arguments used against dungeoneering and warding. 
---
Would you mind Expanding about this? Could help me Tweak things further in the Next Pitch.
---
r/whoosh
---
Thank you!
---
You can buy full gear except t bow and scythe but with that money i'd go for pets i guess
---
Well done, I spent all night channeling like Goku to get it. Must have heard me mention 69 and given you at then. Next good one 273.
---
Bring out the assault rifle!
---
I have fun when I go into the wilderness because someone can come up and kill me at any time. Gets the blood pumping a bit, ya know?  I’m glad there are people running around killing whoever. Adds some threat to the area.

damn 3:12 corrupted gauntlet, impressive.

aaand they fixed it.  #Proofreadinggamestrong
---
There's a safespot on the east side of the table, between the two chairs. Set up your cannon north, and go back to the safespot each time you refill.
---
I think you mean help them, not hinder. I'd think they mostly hack new f2p accounts and add members to them, otherwise Jagex would have many many more disappointed customers.
---
That or bots have randomized early game skilling that makes them look like a hacked account just to confuse.
---
He dropped the thingies you throw at Zalcano

When did we vote on a task system?

this is not always the case, many people who are perm banned just keep their name.

No worries, I am working on my only mining coal with kandarin elite at the coal trucks rn

They all follow the same path

Typo, fixed already.
---
We've made our decisions on those items and will included them as part of the Bounty Hunter blog next week.
---
Anyone else notice he said to cook the fish while in fact you have to uncook the fish, which is already cooked when caught?
---
&gt; 2018 was a good year for Old School RuneScape, but 2019 could be even better if we solve one of our game's trickiest problems - welcoming new players into our healthy and vibrant community. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We're sure you remember your first experience of RuneScape, and how steep the learning curve can be. We're increasingly seeing that the curve is causing players to drop out before they're able to experience the real magic of the game. 
---
&gt; We've already been making changes to tackle this, such as streamlining Tutorial Island and adapting messaging throughout the game. We’ve enjoyed some success, but now need to start looking at more significant improvements. However, our approach needs to be swift and reactive, adapting to the needs of players as and when they materialise. **This need for versatility and responsiveness means that we can't poll these content changes, as the process would be too slow.**
---
&gt; It's important to note that the types of alterations we're considering focus on new players and the early game experience. Everything we do will be true to the spirit of RuneScape without impacting anything in the late game or affecting the value or importance of items. 
---
https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/dev-blog-new-player-experience?oldschool=1
---
Monkey pee all over you
---
Fixed :)
---
Gauntlet times should be the other way around: 4:45 is the time for the Corruped Gauntlet, not the Standard one
---
Stalked ya reddit, you use too many !!!!!!!!s
---
Not necessarily. Lack of a spec bar really hurts KO combo potential. Msb would remain the go-to Wilderness ranged weapon.
---
If you threw the blue rocks at it to kill it (stop stop Zalcano from healing) it would drop a high amount of blue tephra, but the loot was visible to everyone meaning other players can hi-Jack the drop even if they didn't help kill it.
---
Jesus christ
---
Left clicking once every 30 seconds is not PKing.
---
that sounds cooler tho
---
Thanks for the answear!
---
report them too. Jagex might be able to trace to shady shit.
---
I'd love to hear from them that they banned banking account with bills
---
jagex only listens to pkers with regards for osrs.
---
Or, well, they are too afraid to offend pkers.
---
They said "we're not going to be adding MTX to the game" in a post suggesting MTX that they want to add to the game. This is supposed to increase my trust in them?
---
I personally don’t think that there would need to be a leaderboard or rewards locked to making correct reports. 
---
The reward is having a *cleaner* game, and hopefully to the point where we can, together as a community reduce the amount of bots to an extremely small amount that Jagex can pick off and detect before they have an impact of anything. 
---
I would like a message to know that my reports are having an impact though.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Alpha, Rita's escaped! Recruit a team of teenagers with attitude.
---
Man who the hell was asking for Zalcano to be made *easier*?! Where are you getting this feedback from?
---
Like god forbid a boss worth 2m/hr+ and locked behind a Grandmaster quest present any kind of challenge.
---
I just don't **get** you guys sometimes. I really don't.
---
Just want to say that, as a rs2 player that quit the day eoc dropped and just now returning, you jmods seem way better than you were back then.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
I think most people nowadays learn video games off YouTube guides and such. At least the older crowd that is.
---
I said ONE of the reasons. By trying to appeal to every gamer you are then pushing away your current players. WoW has had this issue for YEARS.
---
Wut
---
Youre going to have to expand, I dont see which reward from the elite dairy has been impacted here at all.
---
String would mess up colour scheme
---
Flat ecumenical key droprate. Previously it got higher the more keys you had, but Elite diary had a flat rate. Now everyone has it.
---
You probably just got scammed by these "trimming skill cap" guys. Upvoted for smackdown
---
Good thing they are making changes that don't affect existing players in anyway.
---
Google "osrs crafting calc".  There is a website that lists how many items you need to craft for X amount of xp or X amount for a specified level goal.  
---
It also gives an estimated profit/loss based on median GE prices, but I wouldn't rely on it.  It's just a good tool to get started on finding profitable skilling methods.
---
Everyone's said it already lance is definitely next, then maybe avernic?
---
pretty sure there are some quest related safe spots that required a longbow?
---
Why do people still think this... Don’t just parrot what someone else had told you man, Jagex released an official statement saying that ALL hotkey programs except windows mousekeys are against rules unless it is only being used to remap keys...
---
See: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/mouse-keys---changes--clarification?oldschool=1
---
&gt;There was no wiki back when I started and I did fine, 
---
Exacly, **back in the days**, now is not those days anymore, and Jagex are willing to explore ways to make the game a little more easier to begin playing without damaging the old school feeling, but the community keeps REEing.
---
 
---
&gt; literally is how it works, that's how OSRS was founded and how the game grew. The moment you throw it away it will fucking tank.
---
Thats being Paranoid if you ask me, we should be careful about Jagex's Doings but we shouldn't start yelling "MURDER" every time they suggest changing something we dont like.
---
It wont affect your experience at all believe it or not
---
Unless 😳😳
---
Just put an offer in and none are buying at that price
---
I love this idea. As someone who really enjoys F2P, it would really add a lot to the game.
---
Huge fan of the ecumenical key changes
---
For context, this was one of my 2 joke offers that I've had in for about a month after seeing someone else get lucky.
---
Which Korea?
---
I still cant believe anyone here supports zalcano, a loot pinata that requires almost 0 supplies, and drops loot en mass.
---
Damn, pretty sure I was doing zalcano with you when I got the pet, now I feel like a dick lol
---
&gt; This game is accessible to new players
---
Honestly, its actually not. Not to completely new players who dont take advantage of things like reddit or the wiki. To really get anywhere in the game you need A LOT of knowlage, knowlage that is not found in game and that most players find through engaging with the community outside the game. Shit just reading reviews on the mobile app will show you many players feel lost and confused when they first start out (and no doubt this is supported heavily by data from Jagex or they wouldnt be doing this update at all). YOU might think its accessible, but actual new players seemingly dont agree. 
---
&gt;the game is literally growing
---
Actually, since the massive boost from mobile, the player-count has been in steady decline, likely because the game is failing to retain many new mobile players.
---
As you're only remapping keys (like numpad 1-9) to left click, its not against the rules.
---
Roughly 2.5m/hr based off the hourly kills OP gave. I haven’t finished the quest yet, is it above Vorkath after net item usage?
---
Don’t talk to me or my son or grandson ever again
---
You can make bonds shoot up by buying loads at one point since they arent flipped loads. 
---
But that works with any item that is kinda rare. 
---
360bonds is 18 years btw i buy them over 1 week so I don't pay double.
---
yes  enslaved unicode
---
Considering the minigame itself is already decent farming XP: this makes it very worth it for Ironmen.
---
$11
---
Millions upon millions have played OSRE since 2001. Yet they could handle it? Why would I want some zoomer that can't hold attention for 10 minutes to play the game? If they can't learn to do what we all have for 18 years then truthfully I'd rather them not play and vote in our polls.
---
There wouldn't really be anything to stop a crushing attack irl
---
Isn't that not very AFK though?
---
Totally support, makes ragging so much more deadly and actually have a chance of getting a kill!
---
Do you really want to wait months and months between new videos? No, so stfu
---
Do you by any chance have alts to attack their alts in other world's to distract their bodyguard alts?
---
I should have clarified, in this example yes it’s fine, as it is just remapping keys. I was referring to the 1 button one action comment
---
Lol the fattest kid in our class was the richest as well. He went from heavily overweight to skinny over the summer and rumors spread that he got liposuction.
---
Yellow cunt too.
---
But it doesnt matter why if the super majority agree with it
---
Maybe Jagex should poll a new skill called "banning", you train by bankstanding and reporting bots, at higher levels you can report slayer monster and green dragon bots, and at 99 when you where the skillcape you can ban the bots yourself 😂😂😂 Maybe that's the kind of skill that will actually pass polls...
---
Gilded is all gold and has rune stats, trim is on all metal armours and is just those gold lines
---
What about adding additional content that promotes more "untradable" endgame items?  I think crystal shards are a step in the right direction, especially since it makes the crystal equipment require SOTE to complete (similar to crystal bow back when it was top tier in 2007 or whatever).
---
What are the team's thoughts on more end game items like that?  Similar to the sense of accomplishment one gets when they get barrows gloves for the first time, an item that is BIS but you can't simply buy bonds and get.
---
A more slippery slope. If changes come in which will actually negatively impact the game ill be happy to join you in protesting. At the end of the day, Jagex are a business and they need new players and this kind of update seems like a good way to do it while also not impacting current players in any way.
---
Lmao look its hyphonix
---
I was just going off the kill counts and loot value in the pic, I’m guessing prices aren’t updated for the seed? Like I said I haven’t done the boss yet
---
He forgot his twitter login so he came to reddit. These are the high lvl players who vote no on any new player qol changes.
---
10k every time someone you reported is banned
---
&gt; Every weapon should have a niche, though explaining the niche is as equally important as having it. 
---
I strictly disagree, it's often times good, or desirable, to have strictly bad weapons in a game, especially what is ostensibly a shared single player experience, rather than a competitive multiplayer environment.  
---
I think Ben Brode talked about strictly worse cards in Hearthstone at one point, I'll try and find it.
---
Because the super majority are people who will continually vote for shit that makes the game easier and faster etc.
---
Good, keeping it untrimmed is an unintended mechanics that's been abused by too many people. Jagex should just roll out an update and trim all untrimmed capes automatically if you have more than one 99
---
I thought about making them stab-based 1h KO weapons, but I think battleaxes already fill that particular niche pretty well. It would be better than having a useless weapon, but it wouldn't really give the players any new significant options in terms of account builds or training niches.
---
If you hit a double on 19 of then your drop rate has hit nine perfectly
---
I appreciate the effort you are putting in to raise awareness here, but you must realize this is like trying to hold back the tide with a squeegee.
---
Hopefully NEVER, it's another forced, unpolled change.
---
Yeah, and they are the majority opinion. So the why doesnt matter if most people want it
---
LowSoulGamers cc has alot of nice people! CC: dabe
---
I’m at 700 vork kc, I’ve tracked everything sold/bought and I average at 158k gross/kc, or just over 3m an hour with a draconic drop. After item use it’s about 130k/kc for me
---
I don't recall the exact specifics but some of the ones that were talked about on the stream were;
---
1. A new type of fruit that gave a fraction of the exp but more points.
---
2. Changing the way the point threshold? thing worked. So instead of not giving any points until 75 fruit deposited, it'd start sooner but still worked out to same points. Just made it less punishing or something or so you could do a partial "game" if you only needed X points for something you wanted, instead of a full 100 seeds for lets say 2 points.

Can runecrafting xp cure PTSD?
---
with a maximum reward of **15,000gp**. if you're a stable player in this game, you can make that in minutes. come on now, it's to guide the player after tutorial island. theres hundreds of hours of content and while tutorial island shows you how everything can be done, it doesn't show you where things are in the real world. This can be very overwhelming for a new player

They dont give prizes at all.

When should I use the dwh over the bgs?

I've been afking MLM on my ironman for the past few weeks and it's insane the amount of bots in there, and I'm talking about the upper area which requires 72 mining. I reported probably over 50 bots this past week, hopefully when I login today my ignore list will be like yours.
---
Can you actually climb with them now
---
Everytime someone starts listing RNG odds out to me I just stop them and I'm like

"no no no, that's where you're wrong you see.  It's 50/50, ya either get it, or ya don't."

My in game name is MarkToast. I just got base 70 all stats and melee are 81 att/ 89 str/ 80 def/ 84 range/ 81 magic. Quest cape is done. I have all hard diaries done.

Thank you, it was the resizeable mode.
---
The blue magic attack is the only one that should hurt you, if you're using super antifire, that is!
---
Go full elite void and you should take less damage per trip since the kills will be faster.
---
you mean just you? people complain but are just fine with the gmaul,  like almost everyone with a slight bit of knowledge when it comes to pvp knows that the gmaul is a fluke trickshit above 40def. stop bh pking likes its 2005 with cookiecutter pures.

Yes, that is the one is that is literally destroying me. Sometimes I am taking about 22 damage per hit, and if he decides to throw this attack repeatedly, it hits HARD. What kind of difference would I see getting 99 mage, does the defense bonus reduce the damage a lot?

So much truth in this post here, yet they downvoted you, unfortunate.
---
They want to make a ragging weapon bis over a 500m bow. OP has to be kidding right?
---
It's because even if an item can't be alched it has a "value"(look it up on the wiki)
---
The alch value is directly tied to this in-game value(high alch is x% of value), and what they used to use to calculate what items protected over others
---
They now use ge prices to decide what items are protected over others
---
Nice u beat me by 6kc
---
Ha ha ha ha ha

WOW

how? That can afford one t bow, then you need well over 1-2b for the rest of max gear and over a bil for other skills. this is no where near cash for max account

Unexpected, amusing encounters with people. I was bankstanding in Edgeville the other day, and the following dialogue happened (with an unknown individual):
---
Him: Daddy?
---
Me: What is it my son?
---
Him: I'm not sure if I can do this dad...
---
Me: Believe in yourself and do your best. Know that I'll always be there for you.
---
Him: Thank you dad
---
And then he ran off.
---
I'm not sure what happened there but it made me feel wholesome.
---
Team cape i and Bryophyta's staff.

Someone replied it's more like the American Goodwill.

So maybe someone with knowledge of both will be able to tell.
---
That sounds like a recipe for disaster.
---
Well there’s two raids. Chambers of Xeric is the one that requires herblore and farming, but less gear and combat stats. Is say get base 90 combat stats, with range str and mage being the most important. Theatre of blood is much more punishing and difficult to learn, so most teams won’t take you if you’re not close to max combat with at least decent gear (claws, elite void, chally, zenytes)
---

---
I had an idea a while back of channelling new players (players who didn't beeline through tutorial island/ supposedly bots) into more player condensed worlds.
---
Lumbridge at peak times on w301 feels a bit like it did back in the day, but on every other world the place is fairly desolate. A lot of new players asking questions are eventually guided to the GE by other players, which is where they can really get their grounding.
---
**Could you get metrics** for players who have "found the GE" and their retention rates?
---
What about retention rates of players on more populated worlds?
---
If these seem to have positive impacts on retention, how about created more "high player hub" worlds new players are plopped into and regulars have a higher weighted chance of randomly getting as their world for that session? And of course, this would be for their own region.

Tons of games do this.
---
I've pitched before too and Jagex said it's because "bots will look for holes in the system to avoid being banned"
---
It's a poor excuse, and I don't report players as much anymore because I don't believe anything happens to them.
---
Example, there's a bot whose got many 99s that's I've reported. I know it's a bot because there script broke once and it was doing this same loop for hours in edgeville. This was like 6 months ago and the acc is still active

It’s still really fun once you get it down because you can always improve. Nobody has perfected it yet and trying to beat your fastest raid pb is fun and challenging

I fucking love this lol
---
Why do I see you in every single post and why are you always such a cunt
---
No, but those people only have themselves to blame, and they should learn from their mistakes. In terms of OSRS, there's nothing I can stop doing to stop them from ruining the game. 
---
Regardless, there's no point in comparing semantics, both scenarios suck. Even if one is worse than the other (which I'm not saying it is) it doesn't mean that the other is ok. Both are bad and both should be stopped.

I'll probably work towards that then. I'm sitting at 82 slayer rn and have been procrastinating on finishing this dgs task. Been dry for almost 600 kc now .-.

Yep. I do have other 99s and didnt have a spare. Sucks too I got lots of compliments on it

I'd imagine fairly easy with a stylus. I was doing hydra on mobile and having little to no issue back on release.

Can't you just redirect the tablet?

port khazard or catherby rtele is still closer to charter i think, redirection scrolls exist (for mains)

we dont need to be able to teleport to every tile, theres already 3 teleports into prif

this is great lmao
---
If the new poll question passes then it will cost 195 per attack(780/4).
---
My question is, will divine potion increase in price since blade users will save their shards for the blade?
---
lol
---
Replaced bots still need a cash stack on them to start off. It’s probably costing them money at this point if they keep banning
---
I really hate your argument.
---
'i like this content but I'm an Ironman.. how is this gonna affect me?'
---
I never thought Ironman would take off and was against the idea of dev time going towards it. Clearly I was ENTIRELY wrong.
---
Cost would be percent of GE value. If the dev's WANTED to they could make it different for iron people. But maybe they wouldn't. It's your choice to play the mode. Your only argument then would be that you made the account while the system was free deaths.

I’ve actually tried mummy’s feet and it looked weird, arma d’hide matches the skin color better.
---
ya their report system could be better you have to stop whatever you are doing to do it and if you get attacked while trying to report it cancels it out as well.  So while its exp waste for us its very challenging trying to report if near any aggressive monsters
---
Well prif requires less interaction.
---
oh shit
---
I remember it being \~300 gp before Zalcano, its probably just evening out again.
---
I’ve burned out a few times trust me don’t blame the game for it. It’s just you not having fun playing the content anymore. When I burnt out I would just bandstand with nothing to do and now I’m playing again and having a blast doing everything. Just take a break and if you want to play again go for it.
---
Your friend needs help
---
Testing changes with a small controlled sample size before rolling them out to the general population is an industry standard, and does not set any precedent.
---
What makes it so good?
---
First (200) times
---
It really does. I was doing wintertodt til 99. Got it and 98 because i already lost hope. Did like two rounds before i noticed i got it
---
The things that finally made me beat Jad was to:
---
1) Remap prayer menu to F1 and inventory to ESC
---
2) Before killing the orange ket-zek, pot up, max prayer points, eat, switch blowpipe to dragon darts, deep breath
---
3) Make sure pray menu is open as orange dude dies, hover cursor over pray range
---
4) I kept repeating out loud "If he stomps, I switch". That made me consistently aware of Jad's movements, and when he stomped, I switched prayer, hovered over mage pray and started to repeat out loud: "If he hangs legs, I switch". It may look stupid but I found it really helps with concentration.
---
And as everybody says, take it one action at a time. One successful switch buys you enough time to do one thing and do it correctly. If you can tank the healers, do it, if not, remember: Jad can't hurt you as long as you watch him.
---
The question for increasing the max charges for all crystal equipment would affect the crystal armour too I suspect although it would be nice to see the armour get more charges per crystal shard alongside the Blade of Saeldor.
---
money is 0 time

Does slayer dungeon level buff also mean changes to some of their loot?

Issue with slayer dungeon isnt that the mobs aren’t stronger, the rooms are WAY too big for how little spawns there are. Either increase spawns or make the rooms shorter first then go from there imo
---
Its not actually fine. Its boring. Jumping out of a fucking window should be intense, but its the same boring climbing over a low wall animation. They need to make it slow mo, multi angle camera swoop, and shards of broken glass flying everywhere. Take a lesson from the brimhaven agility course darts dodge.

which is why my initial advice was LMS when it came back. low risk, great practice.
---
Didn’t know that it was actually fine, but the commenter below is right, it’s definitely a bit spamming the ad.
---
Aah damn my dude, that’s unfortunate. An untrimmed HP cape looks dank too. I suppose it was an unintended mechanic we were exploiting so we gotta live with it if it doesn’t work out
---
The nostalgia I've been hit by when I got back into it as of recent.
---
Takes me back to my childhood pulling all nighters on a school night when I should have been asleep but instead I was grinding mining XP.
---
Yea hard to take away such a powerful thing that currently exists. Just figured it would be a way to tie it into the existing Nardah buff that never gets used.
---
I've personally used mouse and keyboard while running IpadOS and it's definitely nice, makes it more of a legitimate option for doing shit other than afkable skills. The mouse cursor itself sucks though and makes it a weird experience as well as the right click is done just  by doing a long click with the mouse which is also weird.
---
Yeah like I said I figured I'd get another 99 and mess it up. But it would've been cool to max with an untrimmed cape
---
our swamp boy bout to get a prince albert
---
True, but I more meant an improvement to its set effect. Players have been saying it isn't strong enough since before the poll and it is kinda surprising nothing has been done for it for this long. I can understand releasing it first to let players try it in-game before offering a buff, but it has been two weeks and there is nothing being offered for it and no mention of any changes being considered for the future.
---
I also think that the Tools, Weapons, and Armor could gain 200 charges per shard instead of 100, but it seems they may want to standardize that too so I can understand if they didn't offer that now. Perhaps the prices will sort themselves out on their own still without needing a buff.
---
Happens more often than you would expect. Especially in nooby pvm clans.
---
Then everyone would spam illegitimate reports making the system break under its own weight.
---
Good spot, I missed that line in the blog!

Im 99 farming. Watermelon to make ultracompost; cadatines (the price of the seeds will come way down after people stop grinding herbalore for SotE; coconuts and other herby precursors.

Still solid all around. I have decent luck at revs when I go on around 2:30-3 am. I actually just landed my first ancient statuette last night 7 kills in.

Glad to know it was just anecdotal :)

All these hate comments, but really look at your stats. All these 99's and 1 agility liked hard

how much did it sell for?

True I missed the world of Warcraft posts too

Mate, that’s not even halfway to 99, call us when you manage all skills 92 is literally halfway to 99

Explain pls how the fact that an original chathead didn't pass a poll is a reason to limit options on a completely different NPC.

Have you tried punching yourself in the head?

Heavily agree

Thanks I got the lance :D

Can’t hurt. In theory dual wielding styluses would be the same as dual wielding fingers, just more accurate
---
Not angry at all man, you just make fun of some dude missing some bis items blah blah some comment about slaying pussy. You don’t slay any pussy at all.
---
If it weren’t for that one attack vorkath would require almost no food to kill. You gotta get hit by something
---
I hope you’re just exaggerating because every time something like Vork is released, we complain about alchables for weeks.
---
Would make for an awesome mousepad.

Not really, I was drawing more attention to the fact that he had crazy expensive armor with some noob accessories rather than male/female avatar

So prayer + hp skillcape is new inferno meta? You could gain free 1 hp and 1 prayer each time u activate it

Don't forget Torag's hammers.

Close your eyes then lol

Who hurt you?
---
I feel the same way. Back when we played there was no reddit or really and solid goals to achieve. Now that mobile is out and we know what to work for I feel my account slowly coming together and everything starting to fall into place. Although I’ve done skotizo 16 times and got no pet (asshole). Good luck man
---
Yeah that's the common animation stall lure.
---
Did this cute noob hurt you? Lmao relax hypocritical virgin
---
That was the Elena chathead.  She's not an elf, nor was that a question about NPC models.
---
Care to expand?
---
I like memes, though. But that shit? That's just bad taste in drawing form.
---
What yield per seed you getting? What farm level?
---
I remember a few years ago I would get messages on Xbox 360 from my friends who would ask everyone to report their name for a free switch too. Never knew that worked in osrs as well.
---
Yes
---
I like updated graphics fight me
---
Guess we're getting offended at jokes now lol
---
Make the Iowerth dungeon multicombat. Or rename it to "Dead content Dungeon"
---
I don't think "remaking" the Prif elves is as big of a project as they want people to think.  They would just use pre-existing elf models.  When they add men, women, or goblins to a new area, it's not like they have to remake them from scratch.
---
Can you make it so the health/shield can be seen from the waiting area outside the room? Or upon peeking the barrier?
---
Have you tried it with the Crystal Armor? It gives 15% Damage and 30% accuracy if used all together
---
Or a bit farm to report their second bot farm (which is simultaneously reporting their first bot farm).
---
ikr? if it didnt work as well as it did we wouldent see such a high number of the bots but apparently its a fucking gold mine
---
Did the quest about your CB level and really struggled with Vork. Will probs take you a few times. Think I ended up losing my temper and power chinning range until about 78 from 75, and then did the quest in one go!
---
Should find galvek much easier.

The suicide boys just keep coming back with a free 7 day trial. Props to you for doing what you can though mate, I report most that I see.

Folks that bot other things don’t seem to get caught or banned as often. There was a thread awhile back about a guy using a bird snare to mess up bots. The thread got deleted, but the RSN that was bottling is still playing to this day. He even had 111m thieving xp, you cannot find a more obvious botting account.

U could have participated in only trails giveaway
---
It's a clan of F2P players. I started with the goal of completing Dragon Slayer on an UIM with the restrictions of not using a safespot on Elvarg, and never doing a grind. I had an absolute blast, and when I was finished I got into /r/W385 and kept playing my account for quite a bit before retiring in Karamja.
---
Yea I absolutely hate farming I’m so lazy and don’t do runs but I wanted to get song of the elves requirement. So i was at the second tier of seeds (56 farming i think?) and did that til 70. It was so many clicks it was kinda miserable tbh.  Maybe with this new change it won’t be as bad and I might actually enjoy it since you don’t have to be near perfect with clicks watering them over and over lol

I laugh ngl

Flat out wrong. Crystal bow is a 5 tick weapon. Rapid lowers this to 4 ticks. Check the wiki.

using your logic, we should revert the changes because 33%, a minority (very vocal minority at that) , want it?

Now do it with every appearnace changing equippable, hairstyle, gender, skin color and clothes.

Seriously the fuck is that logic?

Wait do you know if the game also removed crystal bows you had stashed when all crystal weapons were turned into seeds? I guess I gotta go put another crystal bow in that stash unit then.

&gt;If they solve that - what about that players second, third logins? If they are put into a densely populated world on their first login, but the second is dead, it may be even more confusing.
---
For all players there would be a base increase chance of spawning into these worlds; perhaps while you're still under a certain total )or xp level due to bots specializing in 1 skill) you'll keep being put on these worlds if you're still fresh
---
&gt;There are too many worlds for the playerbase IMO
---
I agree

Only if its preset. Allowing you to set your own status, everyone sets status to "Reeee 73 420 nice"
---
Yo. SICK dude
---
I see your points, but I still believe it didn't need an official poll - The amount of elven content pre-SOTE was very limited, trying to base many new models/chatheads off the basic characters we had at the time would be incredibly tough, that's why I believe the change was made. I completely agree about it affecting prior quests though, I don't think that's okay - it definitely looks weird when seen in Ardougne, but to me it looks fine in Tiranwynn - they're different areas of the world after all, why wouldn't they look different?
---
Also, as in my edit, they didn't revamp it without any details, posts or letting the community know. In multiple Q&amp;As they showed the elven models to decent reception, and the artists were posting non-stop and asking for feedback. They definitely didn't sweep this under our feet, it just wasn't made as easily obvious to every player.
---
Lastly, I'm not white-knighting, the concept of that is dumb. Jagex has their faults, I'm simply stating my opinion on this one matter. I can respect what they've done and give them praise without being a 'shill' or a 'white knight', just like how you can criticize them without being called names or generalized. Either way, good points.
---
I feel like the biggest issue that most RS players have is that you play one of the most casual, slowest games to ever exist, and then when you're in a situation where you need to react at all to anything, you panic and fail.
---
The game updates once every 0.6 seconds, Jad attacks every 8 ticks.  That's 4.6 seconds to prepare between attacks, and 0.6 seconds at minimum to swap prayers.  If you keep your prayer on ranged at all times except when needing to swap it, you get 1.2 seconds to swap to mage before swapping back another second later.  This fight gives you tons of time to react.
---
The best advice I can give is to play games that force you to deal with significantly less time between required reactions.  Shooters are typically decent, RTS games work great, play some League and push yourself as far as you can go, get into Apex and learn to react to other players, both options are free.
---
When you compare the Jad fight to things like Slayer in general, yeah, it's very difficult.  But when you compare it to other games, it's a cakewalk.  And those games are not even that bad at all in terms of difficulty.
---
Point is, you go through 62 waves of keeping the same prayer up (mostly) and just auto-attacking and drinking a potion here and there, then come to the boss where you can't just afk it.  So the best thing you can do is train yourself to react to things faster and more accurately.  It's not realistic to train that on Jad, since you get one attempt per hour.  You're going to need to practice in a different game.
---
No, I haven't played UIM. But as far as I can see the meta would be waterfall quest for 30/30, then The Feud for Addy Scimitar &amp; camping fire giants for Rune. I don't see much reason for any weapons that aren't scimitars to be used, not even for snowflake accounts.

Under advanced options enable side panel can be closed by the hotkeys
---
In all fairness, the tiny rooms of the Catacombs are the exception rather than the rule - compare it to old dungeons like the Fremennik slayer dungeon or the Slayer Tower.
---
I'd be more supportive of nerfing the catacombs than changing other dungeons to match it, but I suspect this to be a very unpopular opinion.
---
I wouldn't call a third of the playerbase a minority
---
I always hear it with that funky sound

That’s exactly the info I needed. I was dropping the ores but I’ll deposit them.
---
Worth mentioning a few youtubers have put out videos detailing making a fletching alt that can sustain a bond for itself and your main. Im sure a lot of these are real people who are clicking 3 buttons every minute and a half while their main does whatever
---
The "I suffered so you have to too" mentality just needs to stop in general tbh. I spent months getting 99 farm with hardwoods and papayas but if they add a lot of seeds to drop tables reducing the price of farming I'm not gonna get ass mad about it I'm gonna be happy for other players that will get the skill faster or cheaper.
---
Yeah lol, this is a terrible take. Unintended mechanics is what makes retro gaming so much fun

If ur socially awkward with no gf and like creepy greasy weeb girls then sure

99% of the time they say ‘automated’. 
---
And their autotypers are set up to be automated:
---
Aka: *trade accepted X amount from player111* 
---
*player111 roll ## you lose x amount*
---
And then back to spamming or sometimes they relog (unknown why but i’d assume it’s some sort of reset).
---
Make permanent ropes or the KQ shortcut not require elite completion.

Too bad you can't dye it with the 250m crown's crystals

I'd love to see more done with canoes, for both F2P and P2P! They're such a unique and interesting transport method, locked solely behind a skill (not quest/item/etc.), and they're only along one river in the entire map. Seems a shame to let the cutscene go to waste as well.
---
The desert has a lot of black space around the edge for future map expansions. Improving the rewards to the desert diaries can wait until they release a desert expansion so that the diary rewards can tie into the new content.

You could do lavas for like a day and be done with it. It’s still pretty awful but you level up fast.

You're asking people to harass him, if you asked once and didn't get a reply, tough.  Doesn't matter your intentions, spam = harassment.
---
Why nerf the dungeon (all the blog says is increased combat levels, no mention of drop changes) when its current only use is an alternative way to kill kurasks and cannon some monsters you can't normally cannon in single way combat?
---
Y'gotta lot 'a balls postin' this 'ere
---
No need to be facetious. Obviously some skills are a lot less fun to level up then others, and some are slower as well. Runecrafting, for most players, fits both of these categories. 
---
It's not an insane proposal that players should enjoy the game they are playing.

&gt;the best possible interpretation is that it would have failed at around 66% yes under a traditional poll
---
You don't know that.  You can try to extrapolate results from an opinion poll that diluted votes between 3 different votes but you have no way of actually knowing how a binary poll would have gone.  
---
&gt;They can't just run "popular opinion" polls for new content with "nothing, option A, option B", requiring only 33.4% support for a change to be made.
---
Weird, someone should tell them that because that's what they did.  
---
SOTE was a unique case of adding a huge new area that meshes with existing content.  The existing content needed to be updated to be in line with the new stuff.  This is new ground for OSRS as the major expansions before have been in totally new areas.  Jagex learned some valuable lessons and is correcting the biggest missteps.

&gt; Chainmaille is extremely ineffective against piercing.
---
This is a common misconception, it's actually very resistant to that.
---
&gt; Mail armour provided an effective defense against slashing blows by edged weapons and some forms of penetration by many thrusting and piercing weapons; in fact, a study conducted at the Royal Armouries at Leeds concluded that "it is almost impossible to penetrate using any conventional medieval weapon".[42][43] 
---
Also, mail was usually worn with a padded hauberk underneath, making penetration even more unlikely and cushioning your body from bludgeons.
---
Bottom line, if chainmail wasn't effective against penetration, on a battlefield of spears, arrows and stabbing swords, would they have even taken the effort to make it?

tbh while I think Iorwerth looks better not purple, I never really understood the "he looks too obviously evil" criticism. Part of Song of the Elves's story is *literally* that the obviously evil guys might not be as evil as you assume.

You can try to extrapolate results from an opinion poll that diluted votes between 3 different votes but you have no way of actually knowing how a binary poll would have gone.  To say "This got more than 25% in a 3 way opinion poll, therefore it would have failed a pass/fail poll" is trying to equate two different things.  Especially when the opinion poll wasn't a full duration poll.  
---
This is a lot like the arguments you hear after every political election, where the losing side argues their candidates really would have won if the system was different.

Updated Elena head came in last place by a longshot.  Stop claiming the compromise as a victory for RS3 graphics.  Also, it probably only won because it was a blind poll with the word "compromise" associated with one of the options.
---
Interesting. I think Jagex could potentially feel pressured into adding some further QOL to its existing client if in this scenario.
---
That hasn't even been hinted at for OSRS and there were some small changes to the lore so it may not still apply. Either way, we're likely never going to go further into Seren than SotE.

Heh, it seems I should told you that my [**Agility project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bndshv/project_agility_in_game_and_sorta_in_real_life/) isn't just Agility. Of course if you literally do only Agility, it feels like staring at wall. One of my in-game pals got 99 Agility by doing Agility and watching videos - no additional clicks in-game. I personally like to chat with people while I run laps, but only when I'm not cycling at the same time. Our ways are not very efficient in terms of experience, but we make Agility progress while doing something else than additional gains.

Agility pyramid is like 3-4/5ths xp rate of optimal courses at 250k per hour

Why would XP need to be reduced from lap completion at a certain point? At 50 agility, the course is giving so little XP that I don't think it's an issue. If they add Agility to F2P I don't see why they wouldn't add the rooftop courses that already exist in the F2P areas in.

Yeah, this is the real issue. The ring works great for tools, but like you explained noone wants to give up an Archer's ring in that situation.
---
What would you say is the best way to go about it, increase the amount of charges given per shard similar to the proposed blade change without altering the stats, or keep it somewhat expensive to use and increase its viability?
---
I think I'd lean towards the former

I think the only thing that *could* mitigate it for them is actually the huge number of new players that play mostly or exclusively on mobile, who therefore wouldn't care about a desktop client.
---
Still, fuck that. The vanilla client is awful lol.
---
Ah, I'm a little out of touch with the F2P game. Turns out they were made available in 2017. I remember talking about that change a few years ago and it's fantastic to see they have already made that change.
---
A couple of reasons, in my opinion:
---
1) much of the old content is irrelevant and will remain irrelevant unless they also update rewards and things, making it a bad development cost also leading into:
---
2) despite it being ‘a popular opinion’ in theory, in practice it would be a nightmare. Reddit loses its mind over everything because it’s a hive of manchildren, which would be 10fold if they’re changing the base of the 07 game. (Look at the rs3 hate, which is fundamentally a better base for a modern mmo than osrs is)
---
3) it’s easier to attract new people with a new car than it is with a refurbished one.
---
i think so! i'm not really a pker someone just posted this jpeg in my discord and i went to check it out, hang on i'll grab it off my phone

So apparently my crystal halberd is bugged and lost it's special attack. I've tried dropping it, relogging, and made sure I don't have any runelite plugins active that might hide it. The special attack orb that turns blue is also remaining grey while its equipped (but turns blue with other spec weps). I'm at a loss here reddit, has anybody encountered this before?
---

🦀🦀chapo is gone🦀🦀
---
Why are you doing a lvl 30 course when you are like 80 agility? Lol dont quote me on it but I am pretty sure chances are better in higher lvl courses
---
No it's not. You can pretty easily maintain 65k xp/h doing werewolf agility, or 55-65k doing ardy. The only task, in isolation, that comes *close* to that is barraging nechs/dust devils. Things like dags and kalphites are closer to 45k xp/h. Even if you assume you have enough points to skip everything but the highest xp/h tasks, you still have to go back to duradel every ~30 minutes and regear which eats into your xp/h as well. 
---
The accepted values for 'efficient xp/h' has slayer taking 290 hours to max while agility takes 207. It's almost 50% slower.

You can hold whatever opinion you'd like, I can also hold the opinion that most complaints are pedantic and a waste of breath and dev time on fixing things that weren't even an issue.

Passionate about integrity change? Sure, that really does steer the direction of the game. Complaining about updated graphics because they aReNt OlD sChOoL and you weren't specifically asked? Waste of time.

Why does prif need to be connected to every major transport system? Very few cities in this game even have the current level of access to transport networks that prif does...

Whats to stop me from demanding a varrock gnome glider, or making zeahs minecarts connect to falador? Its the exact same argument...
---
Efficient trio tob is 12m/hr, duos are 14 but you'll need a lot of practice first. Duos used to be 18m/hr before everything crashed
---
Class Jagex stubbornness and sunk-cost fallacy is what lead to the games original decline.  They make an update that they put time and money into, and refuse to admit their mistake when the community hates it.  Sure, they might make compromises like Legacy Mode, or these "middle ground" elf models and chatheads and exploit the human propensity to support compromise as "definitive proof that the majority of the community liked the change." 
---
These are all lose-lose compromises.  100% of the player base was happy with the old elves. The update was not requested; that's an indisputable fact.  After the update, probably 95% of the community was enraged and 5% actually liked the RS3-esque models.  Now, instead of having 95% enraged and 5% happy, they take a compromise that makes 100% mildly unhappy, but not enough to complain.  That's a quick way to ruin a product, and I'm sure many companies have gone down this path to prove it.
---
Addiction can be a bitch, but hopefully most of us are casual players who plays OSRS for fun.
---
XP drops took a while too, right?
---
Moving the amulet teleport closer would probably be the only acceptable change to the community. People LOVE their pools, so you're gonna have to make an "integrity change" to change them in any way.
---
It's fast for getting to duradel, but that's about it
---
I don't really see how this is op, it's got a crazy agility req, and npc contact does it's job like 10x faster
---
Better idea: revert the elves 100%.
---
If the resources price is already at a floor, then an influx of resources that need to be made into alchables doesn’t actually increase the supply of alchables. The supply of alchables in this case is solely dependent on the number of people crafting/smithing them (since resource cost is already at the floor)
---
I realise I am a little out of touch with F2P. They made the potions available in 2017 which is awesome.
---
I understand that being able to go into castle wars right now is a little strange (and I almost forgot they did that change) but I like that they can have a preview of the P2P world. That being said a Lumbridge course would be pretty cool
---
An amazing way to start off your Ironman Barrows journey! Congratulations! :D

I'm not an Ironman I just don't personally care about arclight charges or skotizo attempts. All the tasks I do in catacombs are barrageable. Nechryael, abyssal demons, and dust devils basically. That's enough shards for most demon slaying I do.
---
Bloodvelds and d beasts were far more efficient to do at Nieve's cave and MEP2 respectively than they were in catacombs due to cannon, so this gives a bonus incentive to kill them here for shards. Kurasks gives a less bot infested location to kill them with the shards as a bonus. I blocked waterfiends so I don't care about them.

I just think you're personally not the niche this dungeon was for, and that's fine. No idea why you downvoted me for disagreeing with you though.

---
I see you Gainesville homies
---
You should transfer the wealth anyway and if you're able to save your account transfer it back. Even if you lose your account it will be easier to rebuild up to that point with that money. Focus more on recovering your account than playing the game.
---
If ever thinking about making a new build I would ALWAYS recommend just making a completely new account to do so man, then you always have a variety which is super nice, I get bored on my accounts and switch back and forth all the time to switch it up, also I think once the defence hype wore off you'd probably get the crave for that 1 defence again
---
Good luck on the grind!
---
The drop rate of the pet is the same on mobile as pc, (penguin course is 1/5k I believe)
---
I hope you'll be getting it soon!!
---
Here's to hoping the decision is a sensible one
---
Is this a fucking troll im triggered
---
I was really alluding to Nechs and should've specified, I wasn't sure about dark beasts.
---
Regular as in we aren't looking to reach ehp rates or  use tick manipulation methods.
---
Also Happy Birthday!
---
I think they're heading towards the Fix options since that's what they mentioned in the latest newspost. I'm hoping the gnome stronghold would be a cool preview to encourage F2P to buy members.

I have to get 87 fishing for mine :(

That could work too

We should all pool together and send this man a nice head set!

They're already getting smacked it's too close

This course has the highest base chance on obtaining the pet.
---
At least

Which rocks are you comparing them to? The members only section of the mining guild has rocks respawn at twice the normal rate. Prif doesn't have this, so they are slower. AFAIK, they are the same as anywhere else, though. They seem to be the same as fossil island, from the test I just did. I'd like to have the prif mine have the same buff as the mining guild, at least for iron, but it hasn't been asked on the Q&amp;A the two weeks I've posted about it.
---
Stay one defence and just nmz up a zerk or med on the side.
---
What about the chronicle bought by Diango? One of the only f2p teleport options that has no reqs to use, and is super useful for new players to be aware of. 
---
And are energy potions included?

Can confirm 400 hrs for me
---
The subreddit and the people complaining on twitter were broadly complaining about the entire rework, including all Elves and Elena. Elena's chathead was used as a good example of how much they changed the models, and Jmods interpreted this response as the players freaking out over just Elena's chathead.
---
Perhaps snakeskin boots?
---
White Knights would love to see the Prince ousted and take Burthorpe Sovereignty for their Junta government.
---
I'd like to see Zaros quest line continue, I figure it'd be quite interesting without going to Dragon Ball style power increase and return of gods.
---
Why are they doubling down on this shit? 
---
The new models look out of place, and are just not good looking.  Why must this constant desire to go fancy persist?!  The game has the pixel space of that really old internet gif of an angry dude walking into a room and kicking a lady on the chair. What it needs is distinctive simple objects, not something that's so convoluted that it looks like a  rejected Darksiders model.
---
are sharks significantly more afk than monkfish? i know monkfish give more xp and gp but i mostly care about afk
---
Ty! Yup gunna try that now
---
Fun, challenging content, but the rewards are terrible. There’s 3x as many corrupted deaths as completions but zalcano is still 2-3 times the gp/hr
---
On the final wave before Jad (62) with the two 360 mages, look for the the bright orange level 360 mage. Jad will spawn where the orange 360 mage spawns, not where the red one does. That alone should help any panic when the final wave comes and you’re racing around trying to find Jad unable to see his attacks.
---
Ohhh that would explain a lot then haha. Thank you! I’ve been high alching at the GE
---
 I lol'd
---
You cropped your head/neck and I can still see your neckbeard.
---
I didn’t say it was dead just honestly not a great picture for reference 😂
---
Adwaam also has an inferno cape on a level 59, but you woudln't say inferno can easily be done with 1 def and 75 range. Three average players new to tob could not complete it with 20m banks.
---
Go gatas
---
How British of them.
---
Yeah nechyryaels are pointless, I actually forgot they were even in the new dungeon lol.
---
Maybe it's a German thing, Aldi does it too.
---
Ngl though both those shops are such great value. It's cheap, but not nasty.
---
I recommend using antidragon shield rather than dfs because dfs is -10 range bonus and the melee/range defence bonuses it provides are useless.
---
Just get better at doing faster kills (eat during poison phase to save time) and raise your levels, faster kills mean you will take less damage.
---
Try to keep your range potted up high (range pots are super cheap) and always have eagle eye or rigour on when attacking.
---
They get replaced so fast because of the free 7-day mobile membership. Until they get rid of it having public chat off is downright mandatory in every populated area, it's ridiculous.
---
Just put a timer on things like rejuv pool and call it good

i kind of doubt that agility is the skill you want to add where training it will make you want to buy members.

---
F. Holy shit, I loved watching this guy too. Is he gonna make another?
---
We've been playing for what, 10 years? More? Let's face the facts, back in those days there were no other free MMORPGs out there. We had to make do.
---
It took me a week to get out of Lumbridge the first time I played this game. The only reason I stuck with it was because it was a wet winter and no one wants to play outside in 5 inches of rain.
---
Nowadays, there's a million more accessible games than OSRS that people can play.
---
It's very clear why Jagex didn't poll this update, because it's absolutely obvious a large portion of this community has no idea how the new player experience is or how a good new player experience should be. We haven't been new players in over 10 years.
---
And no, starting over as an Ironman doesn't count. We still have the knowledge we had before.
---
Another one of Jagex's out of season April fools jokes
---
My comebacks aren't comebacks, they are facts, the majority of the players wants a new skill.
---
Gj telling me my idea is stupid without Explaining further and then calling my answer an "irrelevant comeback", you're kind is what giving the people who didn't like Warding a bad name, your saying that everything you don't like is dangerous and stupid.
---
Rune pure and stay 60 atk 75 is very boring
---
Imagine thinking that’s a valid argument
---
man i cant even imagine putting in that much time and effort into an account and losing my HC status, thats why i just steer clear of a HC because i know damn well id die early on.
---
Imagine thinking it’s just about elf models
---
Not the guy you asked but astrals are my fave. Better xp and similar profit to nats because you can do faster laps. And you unlock double runes at 82 instead of 91, for 1.2m/hr profit.
---
H8
---
why
---
This actually brings back some nostalgia cause it's such a common thing to see in runescape after killing almost anything. Well done.
---
Another HC dead? FEELSAMAZINGMAN :))))))
---
Guess that’s why it’s “hardcore”. It’s unforgiving

Pets are some of the rarest items in the game. 500k to insure them is literally nothing.

its 650k

Dying to the skeleton in the closet you need to go into for ernest the chicken.

Good, the polling system hinders the game's growth anyways. I wish they would force more content tbh (IE Warding)
---
Son son lmao
---
2007 was peak, in between GE release but before trade restrictions.
---
Someone else said you need to log in every 2 weeks to keep em active
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Feels like it. This sub for sure does
---
the POH isn't overly powerful, it's overly convenient.
---
if you didn't have it, there would be an alternative "best spot" to use as a teleport hub/healing center/stat restore/altar
---
I remember selling gold ire for like 600 ea on day 1. I seemed to be one of the only person producing it at such a fast rate, that I made people come to me so I didnt have to stop mining so I could keep up with the demand lol.
---
When is this coming out? I actually want to see that
---
Regardless of whether or not you think Oldschool needs a giant fire serpent spell or a giant water orb stun spell, we can all agree that the current standard spells suck donkey balls.
---
Your wish is granted
---
I think that's a really good point! 
---
They could create a path called "Explorer path"\"Cartographer path".
---
This path will essentially feature two types of tasks:
---
1) Reaching a location ( city, dungeon, points of interest (for example: the GE). Upon arrival the player will be presented with a small pop-up message which will give him some details about the location he just reached. 
---
2) using different transportaion methods (teleporting, canoes, items and so on..)
---
mlm, zaeh rc and blast furnace
---
blast furnace is the worst for me
---
Needs new blade of saeldor imo
---
Jesus fucking christ the dragonstone armor looks horrendous. Please consider suspending the dipshit who thought something like that belonged in OSRS.
---
Pls
---
Yeah I've been playing for about 15 years now, I definitely had other options available to me but all my friends were playing RS so it was just sort of get into the game to play with them. I found it pretty simple like I wasn't very old back then but I think within 2-3 months I had completed every f2p quest and found stuff pretty simple, like I remember using the clues on the main website to get through tricky parts ect, mining gold ore for my first 1M in f2p ect and that feeling of absolute euphoria that I got when I was able to enter the mining guild. For me I wasn't really thinking like damn this game isn't very accessible to me, and even if I subconsciously thought that I wouldn't have continued to play.
---
There is far more games than OSRS that people can play. I would argue that everyone knows how the new player experience is because they went through it, perhaps they have an even better idea of what it's about because most people were quite a fair bit younger than the potential new OSRS player now. I would further argue that you're not getting the 12 year old new player to OSRS because it isn't flashy and new graphics like something that overwatch has to offer, that isn't quite as important to the older OSRS player and because of the older demographic people can definitely see themselves around the game a little easier.
---
This was after losing his other HCIM with way more hours invested too.

---
by anychance you hit the buy limit and sold to yourself? ;)
---
This is the opposite of that sentiment.
---
What we're looking at isn't a situation where the people it doesn't affect can vote, we're looking at a situation where the people it does affect specifically can't vote for it.
---
If you're a new player with below 20 in every stat and less than 24 hours of in-game time, you cannot vote on an update that ONLY affects you. This update cannot be accessed by veteran players because it's set up solely for players below 20 in each stat fresh off Tutorial Island.
---
So this isn't a situation where Skillers are voting alongside PvMers on new PvM content. This would be like if PKers were locked out of voting for a purely PvP update that has no affect on Skillers or PvMers in any way shape or form.
---
That's a bad analogy. Typically you dont want to be shot, unless of course you do because you're testing bullet proof vests while wearing them because why not, in which case you do want to be shot.
---
Since Prifddinas is behind Song of the Elves with 70 base stats in multiple skills and it requires more attention, I find Prifddinas Agility course's experience ratio reasonable.
---
Fletching diamond bolt tips is over 300k /hr

Oh thank god. I thought i got hacked lmao...
---
we need the bunghole
---
It's not. People just like to pretend that memorizing usernames of everyone attacking you is skillful. The same people saying "just don't fight back" are also the ones complaining that the wilderness is dying. Yes, "don't fight back" is a solution, but it's not a fun one for either party.
---
Tank gesr man. Esp with 70 def no reason not to use verac helm and skirt. And with 85 range too your dps would of been more than sufficient. I tanked all 5 healers my first cape and that's with 60 def and 75 range lol using d skirt/archer helm i think and fury. 
---
Inventory setup matters too. Since i was only 45 pray I ended up needing way more super restores than brews. Also play style will effect your inventory and how good you are at body blocking etc.
---
It is also happening on RS3. SO yikes for the whole system.
---
nice
---
Seems to be an American problem atm, 3 americans in cc having issues, UK seems to be fine
---
took me 10 mins to log back in. i try to hop and get kicked out again reeeeeeee
---
Hopefully it's a mistake instead of an attack
---
I'm more interested in buffing stun/vulnerability as opposed to the elemental spells. In legacy pking in rs3, people began (melee) fights by using vulnerability which would increase their dmg on them by 10% and could not be relieved by the opponent using overloads/restores. So, it was a suitable alternative to veng, which I like the concept of. Those spells also don't need multiple runes, as vulnerability is just soul runes and entangle is nature runes, etc.
---
Can confirm. Pretty frustrating
---
Dcing every few minutes, almost died to bandos guardian on an elite due to prayer just not going on or being able to walk. To all you hardcores: good day to fish..

A lot of clans use the party room for their drops.

So does that scam site that you pay money to gamble (runechat or something?)
---
Currently, I'd say the Crystal Bow has 3 defining features: It requires no ammo, it has max range even on rapid, and its speed is between a Shortbow and Longbow, which fairly uncommon. If the armor made it very high accuracy, that could help, but with 70 Strength at its speed, its damage is pretty lacking. I tried it at Brutal Dragons earlier just cause and it was decently accurate but it hit about as strong as a Blowpipe while being far slower. Perhaps something like 50% Accuracy and 25-30% Damage could work instead of the current 30% and 15%.
---
It's incentivising subscribing, which is business, it's no more than a little bit of peer pressure :v)
---
Haven't gotten kicked off at all, but I've been having a lot of lag.
---
Thanks, so pumped!
---
Pinged a UK server and it timed out. Getting some responses from some servers occasionally
---
A year ago, very viable.

Now? Not at all, there's actually a lot of pures in 1750 and 2ks have dedicated 100 meds to rag pures

Thanks for the incredible detail.

Bottom line, it's NOT effective against piercing. There are hundreds of videos proving this, with higher quality steel than they had in medival times. In fact i have a physical, real, not osrs fantasy, high quality, riveted chain hauberk, and can speak on its regard.  
---
As to if it wasn't effective would they make it?  Your life is at risk, you are to be put in a battle with a high likelyhood of being mortally wounded.   Would you rather go in naked, or go in with even a tiny bit of armour? 
---
Chain by itself is NOT effective, which is why it was paired with both cloth and plate armour, in almost all cases. This is clearly shown in medival text, artwork, tapestries, aswell as battlegrounds such as wisby.
---
Interesting. So really, you'd have to be 60 something combat to be effective at all?
---
It's cool guys I'm in 😎

Ye I know. Did 80 kills past 2 days, was quite a long task. Should be 1.5 tasks per droprate nominally luckily.
---
From US. Trying all servers in CMD and some resopond, some time out. weird as shit
---
Also be able to toggle each song off the shuffle list individually
---
Move on if you aren't having fun. Some people are too damn attached to osrs. (In a sense that they keep playing without real reason/having fun)
---
I believe in seasonal deadman it was quite popular since you spawned at the GE and it only requires 13 crafting and 27 magic.
---
I think that's where i know it from, because i sure haven't used it myself :p
---
It's not, git gud
---
This exact thing happened to me I lost 350m in 3 items while doing kbd
---
maybe so, but the best ping you can get is 120-130. Americans and Europeans get like 30 pings. there is a big difference and there is no reason why Jagex cannot set up Arab servers in a rich gulf country. I'm sure they will make it back by the mere fact that more people will play the game simply because they will have less lag and better QoL and they will contribute more to the end profit of Jagex (which is all that counts in the end lets be real) since they are rich countries and are able to. I see no point in setting servers in poor countries such as south american countries for that reason.
---

servers getting ddosed again smh $11 btw
---
Yet even still pures cannot compete with mains, and the purpose of a pure account is pvp. If the reason to not buff it is their interaction with PVM, then its a negligible reason.   Furthermore why stop someones fun, theyve been a part of the game since its inception,and unlike ironmen, they do not limit themselves purely by choice, rather by nessecity.  At lower combat levels pures are absolutely neccisary in order to effectivly PK as others have them. therefor, even if they don't want to be a pure, they have to in order to compete.
---
I started off as a HC, but then I got bopped doing Waterfall Quest. I'm just that good.
---
No.  First you'd hardly get any kills at lvl 60 and even if you could they have maxed gmaulers (lv 78) to ags pures (lv88) rotating and patrolling 24/7 through account sharing. It's not effective for any acc unless you pay them
---
If you still cannot log in, try logging into a UK world. I would advise logging out and choosing a world to hop to if you plan to be hopping.
---
im surprised osrs doesnt have angel or demon wings. most mmo's have it lol

Developing a group of people that you trust enough to not yoink loot is a huge social element. Joining the queue for some sterile experience that is the same every single time is exactly what's wrong with most MMOs.
---
not everything has to be good but the amount of requirements needed to get it makes it seem shitty now that they put in a ton of things that are better with basically zero requirements
---
What kc did you get it at?
---
My concern with opinion polls like this is how votes can be split across options. Since the highest voted wins, that can be a big problem. For example, if Lord Iorwerth's model was A, B, C, or none of the above, it could end up 27%, 23%, 25%, 25%; that would mean option A wins but if none of the above wasn't an option, that last 25% would have went into the other 3 options and could have lead to a drastically different result (e.g. 30%, 32%, 38%, making Option C win). And the same problem applies to just polling the 3 options like they are doing, but the more choices there are, the more the vote is can be split.
---
Thank you Osrs Jesus

OSRS is more of a ghost town. Like I said most of the worlds are empty, the players are just bafflingly more toxic

You're here crying on reddit but he's the salty one?

Lmao, absolute chad right here

I remember making holy symbols and selling for 30k each on the trading post for the mad rush of impatient pkers shit was amazing
---
lower the attack speed ticks, he said it right

Failing to see the logic in not offering a buff to the crystal armour set effect. It was useless before it ever went live in game.

What part of my post is salty? LOL

Vet'ion is actually just a retextured quest boss from like 2005 or something. I think it looks kinda neat but if they graphically updated it I wouldn't mind.

Low effort bait but I'm still downvoting regardless
---
Wow I just got 99 hp and I just bought the cape I thought the game was glitched cause as soon as I bought the ho cape it was like I was getting DDossed I just added somone on there too and was wondering if they were the ones attacking my connection is it just mobile or all servers?
---
1274, so not awful.
---
Stands for death dot, usually that term is used when a team pks and all stand in the same spot so it looks like 1 player on minimap. I guess it could also be used to describe when you stand under your opponent in a 1v1 when he's frozen to hide your switches, which was how he was using the term.

nUh UH U c@n'T pR0t muh attAAAAAAACKS1! maaaaaaaaaaaaahm! get jamflex daddy to b@n th15 k11$d! Clan wars and the duel arena have the things you're looking for regarding yes/no on prayers/overheads/other specific fight rules. It's just that people spam 50/50 no movement gamble fights instead of DUELING and that is why the sand casino sucks.

So there's a 1 in 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 chance of me shuffling a deck of cards in a specific order?
---
Do you think it would be fair to increase DWH drop rate to something like that, or would it become ez scape?
---
No, you don't. 
---
There's 50 cards to choose from on the flop, not 52 (because you already know your KK).
---
46 of the cards are K or lower (50 - the 4 aces). Thus 46/50 for the first card dealt. If it isn't an ace, theres now 45 from 49 to choose from, thus 45/49, same for the 3rd card.
