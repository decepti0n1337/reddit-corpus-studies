I'm curious about the reaction of each Torag helmet after about the 8th one or so lol.

The planets name is Gielinor named by guthix himself. Later on runes were discovered and humans nicknamed the world Runescape after them

The similarity they seemed to touch on was just about it being a boss in a cave where you can go in with "infinite" people. No instance, no slayer only solo boss, etc. Just a big ass boss you gotta kill. I imagine it will technically be solo'able in a similar way to corp as if it's not instanced it won't reset stats on specs like corp.
---
I don't think he's smart enough to have thought that

Bro, RS3 is having an MTX event to raise awareness for mental illness. We can man up and deal with some overpowered slayer mobs.

Do you have any plans on updating the desert in the future?

at the moment it seems rather dry (pun intended)
---
Still a chad
---
I really hope they look at partner slayer with these engine features. Because it could be seriously fun with friends without having to wait to have our group irons there.
---
As for your 3rd question, they *definitely* will. I'd see that as being a mode ruiner if you couldn't, as that's the main reason we want it. Iron man makes progress so different and enjoyable, but removes the ability to play with friends except in minigames and raids. This brings that back. And the engine work required to have it doable is why they had to delay this update so long.
---
Sounds like private servers are actually what you want.
---
What about "theeeeeee collection log"

The average kill gp is the same. It may seem like bandos is more profitable, but that’s because you can stay there for hours on end.
---
Good job, Just one mistake I noticed with the seers ring and archers ring, but any noob can see what its meant to be.
---
The best thing to do when you get a bond is to make more gp. Until at the end of the two weeks you can buy another bond. Depending on your levels there are many ways to do this. This is just for the beginning, after you get that rhythm down you can do anything.

When I first saw the image I thought you were dead lmaoo. Anyways, gzz on the pet! I got it at 282kc, but not in that risky situation :P
---
Can't alch hydra heads either :/
---
Well we only know it’s 3x for now, I’m also hoping they make it at least 8-10x more xp. Unless they have a relic that increases xp, but who knows. I think it’s too early to tell. Also...

Could GE buy/sell progress messages be moved to trade instead of game chat?
---
Accuracy matters more and more the deeper end game you get. And with that said most bis upgrades are these kinda small changes. Even lots of the +1 strength upgrades rarely give you a max hit, but adding them up together does make significant changes while potted especially. Accuracy does the same.

hessuex69 is a cutie exorcist tho

Any Venezuelan beaver cheese perhaps?

tangleroot looks weird in this pic
---
It's ironman mode is it not? Or is it just fake ironman where you can't trade with people and there's obviously no GE. Cos I guess ironman mode would cause problems of griefing by doing single bits of damage.

Very much agree. But skyrim could not have been prettier.
---
There's literally 0 risk for people who never step foot into the wild which then creates this negative rep for the wilderness because once an entitled pvmer who never loses items dying to goblins and chickens all day gets pked, he loses his stuff and goes bat shit crazy on the polls and spewing hate towards pkers. Safe death mechanic is what tore apart the pk / pvm community into two separate player groups which is stupid.
---
He's almost always set up on 2k worlds but still flickers if you get a few people on him.  Entity hider is your best friend here. At least on 2k worlds it's rare to encounter people who despawn him
---
I'm sure it is possible. I hope if it's ever polled / desired it should be a toggle..because personally I don't want anything to do with that. But if it's client side and just for you and you can toggle it on, sounds good (and would benefit mobile pretty well)
---
ik, but 
---
&gt;Fire cape or infernal cape
---
there's a bit of a gap between those two things lol
---
also seeing base 70 stats/pet/diaries and slayer helm/torso/ddef on the same list is kinda disorienting
---
Skyrim was beautiful no doubt
---
Worth a permaban.

I dont understand why it bothers people that a group of 4 got together and created a group in a world that isnt 378, 377, 375, 302-305. You can literally go to any of those worlds if u wanna group up in masses and leave the people who want to grind zalcano alone

Oh man that's so mean.  But also kind of true.  Clans really are the best way to enjoy an MMO, it's amazing it's getting better support.  I'm hoping the clan revitalization will help that out, and help more people make these friends in game.

It's coming out November 14th so I'd expect any extra info if they're gonna reveal it will be end of this month / beginning of November. They may wanna keep a bunch of the stuff secret though so it's more exciting when people unlock it. What else do you think they need to reveal?

I've played my iron for less than a year and its total is almost better than my max combat PvM-oriented main account. Skills are just pointless on a main. There are no goals for skilling outside of a max cape, which is a hard pass for me.

Nothing of value is lost. Support.
---
Yikes. Is this satire?
---
Just get 200m firemaking xp at wintertodt, free 99 construction

Half runes? Where does it say that? All I read was it gives 50% more xp, but it's gathered by your own account mining the ore and trading it for essence.

I don't know how many here are younger and haven't left home yet.. But 5+ years at any position in your 20's is well above average. Leaving is inevitable, especially early in your career when you develop skills and become competitive for higher positions elsewhere, or have a change of heart and switch careers entirely.
---
How do you know they just won’t pay you back? Genuinely asking.
---
Why not?
---
Lmao was this in the tunnel system under the dorms?

If you can't tell, some of the words are scratched out.

You would have your high DMG armour for the ticks that you are dealing damage, and then flick the tank armour for ticks you are receiving damage
---
is it a big difference with void elite versus blessed d'hide? 91 range/88 def.
---
Okay!
---
3 nails, 4 planks, and a lot of knowledge
---
I love my 3 monitors!  Nice setup.  I have a 4th above my main for my streaming pc but I'd never go back to 2 and DEF not 1 monitor :)
---
Fair enough, I had the magic defense formula wrong, but you still don't need brews and restores. He drops 2 bones every kill so 7 kills is 14 inventory spots taken up by bones. He also always drops a fuck ton of rune long swords and kite shields. Every time you brew you're going to have to repot, unless you want to kill vorkath without a ranging pot. But go ahead and waste your gp on brews and restores at vorkath, that's the true brainlet move.
---
It'll definitely be balanced to solo methods. Balancing to runners would be a massive change to the skill. As runner methods are essentially just ludicrously expensive ways to get the skill done faster.
---
Main thing I'm looking at is people will just afk this mining method.. which I imagine will be designed to not give much xp while they're alt accounting etc. And then do lavas at 50% more xp. That will bump lavas to like.. 100k/hr rates while training, but ehp wise be the same due to the mining time 
---
It's honestly a clever way to indirectly reduce the time doing a skill people don't enjoy without just releasing faster rates on new content or far easier content (like zeah and zmi). Unfortunately if it's not explained well it might not pass a poll due to people thinking it is just a 50% flat buff.
---
Seems reasonable.
---
The morosity is so high they don't really make that much money with that tbh, even when lending money they don't really have, banks struggle to make a profit, makes you think lmao
---
Group bank is such a good idea, as long as it's separate from regular bank. You'd have like a personal vault and a shared PO box. I'll share, but I don't want to have to share EVERYTHING. But then, seeds, herbs, potions, food, whatever could all be shared freely regardless of who is online right then.

Yeah people with above 0 iq don’t get lured

I think changing items to look significantly different can cause confusion in what the item is. Currently ornament kits kinda just add details to the existing kit. With the main ones I think of in terms of changing a lot of the appearance being the dragon pick ones, but it's still very recognisable.

Weeeeeeell, nuclear annihilation is still an ever present threat. It's just one that most governments assume is not one to consider since nobody is likely to use them.

Economies can be rebuilt, but good luck fixing a radioactive wasteland. It's just the likelihood of one happening is far higher than the other.

Ex-mod Woof is trying to start some drama already.
---
How is it brand new?
---
Too much magic defence. Nerf.
---
why tax at all? the issue with the economy long term is lack of item sinks, the amount of gold is irrelevant since so few activities are tied to gold value.
---
I did not know that. Why wouldn't it count?
---
The only PvP content that ever makes it to a poll is content designed to bring non-pkers into the wilderness to be preyed on. That vast vast majority of PVM players would vote yes to PVP content if it meant PKers killing each other, but it never does.

prob just rename the tele to al karid

I feel like our game is going to be dead in the next 2 years at this rate
---
Rotate your camera...
---
I don't. I think they should have designed it with a similar design approach as they did with other slayer monsters.
---
Kraken baby's drop it's uniques, but uncharged and at a diff rate. Boss is better.
---
Hydras drop ring pieces (I believe?) But not the big drops like claw.
---
These should have been an actual med level slayer creature.. which yes would be afkable.. like 95% of slayer creatures) but have an absurd jaw drop rate that they arent "worth it" unless you get extremely lucky. Essentially their off task rate should be the flat rate.
---
They should be slayer only so they can't be indefinitely camped. Also means safespot didn't need a nerf. They haven't nerfed wyvern safespots after all these years Afterall 
---
Then make a repeatable slayer boss with similar mechanics to the quest boss, but it's one of the bigger knights rather than the snake we killed. Have it drop the jaw at a more reasonable rate, while also offering some decent drops but nothing amazing (it's a LVL 60 slayer boss Afterall). 
---
There, you got your afk option with shit chance of the unique, and a more engaging boss that's not afk'able, but also killable by players at the level range it's catered 
---
Right now it's a med level quest that gives you content not even worth looking at until you're nearly max combat.
---
i'll say the same thing i said about the gay pride event - keep your politics away from my game i use to escape the real world
---
Here's what I dont understand about group Ironman. What happens when in the future there is a high leveled group ironman that has tons of gear, and can invite someone to his group temporarily to trade him a bunch of items, then that same person can leave and join another group and introduce all these items to people? Wouldn't that create a ton of issues?

That’s because it drops from desert lizards. And we all know that desert lizards suck ass to slay.

I know, it's sad. Today's announcement made that clear. I'd jump but Jagex owns OSRS too and RS3's running out of whales.
---
Your first statement is not true. The bh poll had pvp only content that would have no negative effect pvmers and it only helped pvpers but it failed. See the first two questions failing for for having multiple rune pouches and looting bags. All of the pvp weapons failed too which are weapons for fighting other players. 
---
You second statement has no evidence supporting it. Most of the pvp only polls fail and the pvm in the wildy polls pass. The Dagon Hai robes passed with 80%. They are pvm content in the wilderness. See the wildy rejuv polls too for more examples. 
---
20% of people who voted said they voted no simply because they do not like pvp. This supports the idea that people are okay with pvm content in the wilderness over voting for pvp content. Jagex is not luring people. How can you vote yes for pvm content in the wildy and then blame Jagex for being lured?

That’s gonna be rough I think. On one hand, someone can conceivably fuck over legit players if they ban the whole group but on the other hand it’s gonna be hard to prove that it was planned in advance rather than “joe decided to bot while he was at work and didn’t tell anyone” when stuff like discord, IRC and text messages exist so people could get away with it fucking up competitive stuff.

Waterfall quest for a nice boost to attack and strength.  Druidic Ritual to unlock herblore.  Start working on Agility for the boost to run regen.

I'm new to barrows and I've been doing a few runs per day there. I'm currently just over 30 kill count, and have been doing the recommended loot potential kills while in the catacombs. I kill all 6 brothers and then a couple of skeletons as per what the wiki says, and I have not gotten a single loot. Am I doing something wrong? Does anyone have any extra advice on exactly how to maximize the loot potential? I know it works based on total combat level of each kill, I'm just a little confused. Is it just bad luck?

Make a gmaul brid.  Do all attack quests.  If you don’t like it get 60 attack.  If you don’t like it get 42 def.  if you don’t like that get 70 def. if you don’t like that get 75 attack and defense with rigour.

Except when the video game companies (Blizzard) are actively banning pro esports players and taking away their prize money because they are pro hong kong.  Blizzard is a disgrace and while you might be comfortable in your gaming chair there are people suffering on the other side of the world.

You won't get banned for using it. A high percentage of the community uses this plugin. Jagex isn't stupid enough to mass ban people after a vague announcement like that. Jagex knows major clients are waiting for more inot.

The whole group fails if you cant trust each other anyway. These features dont change that

What they're doing is also completely communist and actively against what is wrote in the constitution of the United States.

Well that's partly true, but just saying that does not fix anything and the reality is that people will gamble. It's like saying: drug addiction is people's fault, just don't do drugs.

Yeah, just don't do drugs. Pretty sure that didn't solve anything tho

The point is that the sound is really loud even at the lowest setting, and I don’t think the notches actually represent a 25% difference in volume.

First off, there is no specific rule that says what they did is off limits. Blizzard allows the right to remove people from grandmasters if they express beliefs that are anti-Blizzard, but the whole point is that this shouldnt be. 
---
Even if there was a specific rule against this, realize what an act of protest is.
---
I wish there was more I could do to support the people of Hong Kong, if you have any ideas, please let me know.
---
But may rarely even get a bank kill
---
For people who struggle to simply do basilisk knights I doubt it is shit easy lmao
---
And no people aren't banned from sports for expressing their religious views in the US.  And also, Blizzard is an American company based in California.  Anyway.
---
Yeah bc who goes to Pollniveach without a magic carpet
---
Seems a bit elitist for me.
---
A 2 year old account that only posts in a niche subreddit isn't likley working for the Chinese government.
---
Please for the love of god do not use craws bow on Callisto. His ranged defense is insultingly high. Get the chainmace or use veracs. Both are higher dps
---
Quality shit
---
Gz
---
It’s a poor man’s crafting cape
---
Recharging pool is right next to a tele
---
There’s green dragons in the dungeon below
---
Stove literally on the tile next to the bank chest
---
No, like how duelibg on rs3 works.
---
Lmaoooo
---
25 to life.
---
Oh piss off
---
My buddy got chin pet and herbi in the same day
---
Not at all! It's just nice to play with people that don't constantly call you a virgin or a nerd or a neckbeard for simply having the cape! A lot of my in game friends aren't maxed, but I get along well with maxed players and end up gaming together for collection log grinds and such
---
You you go against what you literally just said about Americans being banned because of their views?
---
So you are asking le to risk 140k (or 740k with gmaul) for every try?
---
I use a main acc to pk with, every single person i fight has d claws, ags or elder maul and has min-maxed stats. How do you expect me to even have a slither of chnce without using barrow armour?
---
Max guild, sure, but no ge. 
---
Total level worlds, 2200 is fine as they aren’t even full. 
---
Clean up the cape, agree it’s an eyesore. 
---
Historically osrs has never had trimmed or Comp cape.
---
Gz man, feels good putting it on for the first time
---
"Wildy Mom" aka Avrah has this series, but it's on hiatus atm.
---
useful for clues as well
---
Can I identify sexually as this meme
---
No your question was very specific, someone from America being banned for their views from a blizzard tournament.
---
Historically osrs never had max either
---
Obviously
---
Literally impossible to give advice without knowing your firemaking level sorry.
---
You can say what Blizzard did was in their own self interest, but people can still get mad at them for going against human rights.
---
Fuck everything about China
---
We had a ton of stuff on there. The Connection Lost along with the the A q p, Buying gf, Nice, the old ice posiedon memes, max cash stack all on the top right. I remember there was also a gnome child on there at one point. That even was so cool.
---
:'(
---
 Seems like some therapy would be suiting if Joe Schmo calling you a neck beard or nerd is bothering you. But honestly, I’ve played the game or been around since 2004. As a person who has never maxed due to just not wanting too, it helps to see those maxed players playing the game instead of hiding in a world a real non bot level 50-60 doesn’t have access too. Gives you hope that the game isn’t to grindy even though we all know the truth.
---
Of course they can be pissed off with them, let them be pissed off, this entire thread has been from me saying keep the shit out of a medieval clicking simulator.
---
Guns don't kill people, people kill people. If we take away their guns they'll just find other ways to kill each other. Wait, I mean gamble!
---
The quests won't really tell you how to play thr game but they do unlock various pieces of content.
---
Your best bet would be to Google "optimal quest guide" and follow it. That would give you the simplest path forward.
---
A more accurate video would be the "big lez show" or the mike nolan show. But ye these cunts are pretty spot on.
---
Right.
---
I mean it's true, they will just move to 3rd party alternatives.
---
Okay if we are being pedantic give some examples of Americans being banned from tournaments because of their political beliefs.
---
good chance that anti prc keywords will result in permanent mutes for players in the near future since jagex is owned by fukong
---
&gt; the map you can buy in the general store is also not terribly useful
---
Newcomer's map was my boy back in the days. It's the only way I got around.
---
Yeah because I'm sure EVERY other large company would risk billions of dollars in the Chinese market because of bad PR that will be forgotten in a week. Yeah, this is such an unexpected move from a company whose sole purpose is profit.
---
It's a social game. People are going to talk about whatever is going on at the time and there isn't much you can do about it.
---
What is sote? Apparently it isn't "Song of the Elves" in this thread.
---
I starydd wow classic
---
The player should 100% take them to court. I know it's against their rulebook but I'm still not sure "I'm not going to pay you your prize money" would hold up in an American civil court. 
---
You can't just not pay people you agreed to pay. I don't think taksy-backsy clauses are legal.
---
Well that's a drop in the bucket to 99 mine, and not much of a "grind."
---
Same
---
Yup got sold to a US company.
---
I thought so too, but there's no info at all about that being a thing, so I guess I've misread something on the wiki.
---
Use the report button for him botting and you stalking him
---
Ash has said over and over has has 0 plans to go anywhere and loves where he's at
---
He's also said the new upper management is some of the best he's worked with, so idek what's going on anymore
---
I get killed while training hunter at black salamanders, it's in my best interest to not have anything equipped but I still get killed just because it's an annoyance.
---
I remember fighting those clowns that kept trying to add ellipsis to the end of it, good times
---
It doesn't have to be when buying, selling is another matter
---
after the new update, the knight noclips through anything necessairy to get loose
---
just because that's the way it is doesnt mean that's the way it should be lmao. i wouldnt try to make excuses for a company that hasnt even updater their vanilla client since release
---
Nah no worry, its for your own interest, just like how i vote no to everything that buffs pkers killing me out in the wildy
---
Literally nobody is talking about rs3 but you, buddy
---
Why bother trying to make anything better right? Things will just be bad in a different way, no point trying then eh?
---
I mean how many mods have left b4 recently?
---
They had a huuuuge influx of mods like 5 -6 years ago and now a chunk are leaving. 
---
That sounds like regular employer turnover to me
---
meanwhile osu getting wrecked at the bottom
---
He's said a bunch ko times he has 0 plans to lesve anytime soon
---
«ur fault» still haunts me to this day
---
Yes and 5-6 years ago there was a huge influx of mods
---
It happens
---
Why back a currency with a commodity (gold) when you can just back it with the economy itself?
---
What if hardcore mode readded dangerous random events? Ents, exploding rocks, whirlpools, guardians (tree spirit, rock golem, river troll), etc.
---
From the wiki:
---
&gt;Towards the end of the [Legends' Quest](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Legends%27_Quest), it is possible to obtain them by allowing [yommi trees](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Yommi_tree) to die and chopping them down, which seems to yield magic logs about 25% of the time. **This cannot be done once the quest is complete!** This is a slow and tedious process (~2–4 hours depending on luck), but is a viable alternative for those who do not have 75 Woodcutting or 58 Hunter to catch [nature implings](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nature_impling).
---
They also has a big influx of jmod hires 5-6 years ago  and now some are leaving. Its understandable and a regular thing that happens in all lines of work
---
Its almost like this sub has a bunch of people that don't work/have a career
---
Remove yourself, friend, from the gene pool, because last I checked the Duel Arena IS a part of the game.
---
The most dangerous game
---
they are planning on removing it just so you know.
---
Oh, sorry I have the dumb.
---
Reason China is going after certain companies is because they have chinese audiences. Osrs is banned by the chinese firewall so they have no reason to censor it.
---
If anyone is interested, pro Hearthstone player was banned for 1 year got his winnings taken away for supporting Hong Kong protests. Two casters were fired as well. Blizzard had to close their reddit due to huge amounts of people posting their disgust about blizzard policy. A lot of people are leaving blizzard games due to that.
---
Yea and I'll take everything else...
---
For luck
---
An example of something i never stated l0000l dude. Go read your own replys. I told you at the start i don't waste my time on dense retards like you. If you had of replied to me in a reasonable way i could explain do many things about rs3 with split banks, max guild, prif etc etc. This is something i have really looked into. But you made it clear you dont want to learn anything and just want to argue. I love debate and discussion but not with people that hold your mindset. Peace dude, enjoy rs.
---
Someone call the dude that was 27k kc dry here and make sure he’s okay.
---

Hong Kong was created as a British colony and was eventually turned back over to China, but with the stipulation they could rule themselves as they wanted. This was agreed to for a certain amount of years sincr Hong Kong was by far the most advanced city, and made as much money for China as the rest of China combined.
---
Fast forward to the 80s or 90s, and that time limit ran out, however, HK was still making a good chunk of money for China, so with that leverage they bought themselves some more years of self-government.
---
However, now mainland China is making far more money than HK so there's no incentive to honor that agreement and are really bearing down heavy on the propaganda. They've also started kidnapping HK citizens who are anti-China and if they show up (usually months later) they're in mainland China on TV apologizing for their treason before never being seen again.
---
This has all escalated over the past few years as more and more HK citizens are revolting, and now it's pretty much daily riots between HK citizens and the HK police (paid off by China).
---
This is a pretty tl;dr version, but it's super interesting.
---
Off task the jaw is 5x as rare as on task. For most estimates, you're still hundreds or thousands of kills below the drop rate.
---
Yes. They will be as long as PvP exists.
---
Quite a few sweep the revenant caves.
---
I was pretty far from his melee and the ranger was dead I'm so baffled
---
Nah I wa pretty far from him
---
The fearmongering is a bit silly imo
---
Yes it's understandable to be worried, but this "omg jagex is doomed, everything is wrong, something's up at jagex, etc" is not helping at all. Its just causing panic.
---
The facts are we know nothing other than what they tell us, and what they've told us is that after 5-6 years some people are moving on to better/different jobs. Just like there was an influx or jmods 5-7 years ago, now some are leaving. This is normal for. any career. Its just a little weird they're all happening in the same period.
---
Probably spent like 500g in runes just to get that thing... Legend.
---
Granted if he read the chat he probably would’ve know that you need to use the air spell and not
---
The air rune.
---
I was far from him
---
Just get to 750 worlds and you'll be golden
---
The ranger was dead and the mage was far from me for meleee
---
You weren't praying what you think you were praying.
---
Can someone summarize for me who A Friend is and what he did to become so frequently mentioned around here?
---
Lol that's bot how currency works
---
On your recommendation?
---
I had 25 prayer left. I was paying attention
---
China banned the Christopher Robin movie because people were comparing the Chinese President to Pooh, for example.
---
I'm honestly so shook man
---
&gt;proper PvP content instead of getting piled by team
---
kind of funny becuz i cant play battle royales due to the whole thing being a 3rd partying gangbang while youre trying to have a fight with another team/person. its always at the end of the game too where that team that wins is the one that camped and hid the hardest
---
 i cant play osrs pvp either tho lol
---
Your mom is better go than basilisk knights lol
---
lol
---
Can also just access the main osrs page, so yeah, I think we're in the clear.
---
He was watching at x0.50 speed. Checkmate.
---
^^^/s
---
obviously its an integrity update
---
3. Yeah it’s infinite run energy. 
---
4. Wow I’ve never thought that that relic would count for non-combat spells too, that’s wild op. Idk. 
---
5. The construction store shouldn’t be moved for this event. That is part of the challenge of area-restricted accounts. Besides you can get limestone from wintertodt. I’m not sure but I’d guess you could just walk out your house portal to go back to Kourend, as jagex wouldn’t lock us in our house. Although maybe we’ll get Hosidious house from 1con, who knows.
---
Actually the UK only handed it over in 1997 and the one country to systems principle will stay in effect for another 30 or so more years. Chinas really just being a dick at this point.
---
This is great!
---
I don't understand though. Elvarg damages you through absorption. Does he not when you use anti dragon shield?
---
... Are we just going to gloss over the fact a group of people have succeeded in remaking the Mona Lisa!?
---
Quest dialogue would be a lot less tedious if it was more like WoW where the entire quest is read on one page. I get that it wouldn’t work with option choosing in OSRS but still, it can be tedious.
---
Am I too old for knowing what that is?
---
Kinda of a big fuck you to all the people that lost all their shit because of it I guess. Plus exploitation of a bug is against the game rules.
---
Those cup your man boobs very nicely.
---
And emily faked cancer
---
I am shidding and pissing my pants right now man
---
This man is right, until you've been there and lived through this. All you're really doing is emphasizing to whatever the media wants you to believe. The amount of downvote to this man's remark is a great example of that.
---
I can't think of anything more cringy than people censoring their own profanity on the internet because they're scared their mom will find out.
---
look behind you
---
China also banned South Park from the Internet after their latest episode 'Band in China'.
---
Shut up boomer
---
Been seeing this alot lately can anyone  please expand on this?
---
What's being protested?
---
The varrock square massacre
---
which is a company that is 98% owned by a chinese guy and may or may not be a fukong puppet...
---
JE SUIS FALADOR MASSACRE
---
Drug dealers havent done anything wrong,its all weak people who cant help themselves
---
Quit that bullshit,if someone is not too strong to overcome addiction by themselves,its not a reason to trash on them
---
On low defence monsters the msb(i) (you need to buy an msb scroll) is good. Use either rune or amethyst arrows. It's still worse than the blowpipe, but a whole lot cheaper.  
---
Honestly this is a hard question because what you're killing changes the answer so much. If you're killing bosses you would want to use a rune (or better) crossbow.
---
I'll give you my t bow if you kill a gorilla with 1 slayer
---
The final battle comes down to luck more than anything, assuming you can dodge the instakill mechanics which might take a few tries but is actually pretty fun once you get the hang of it
---
I hate Ironmen with a passion...
---
... but I can't help but say Nice.
---
Welcome down... to my... PLANET HELLLL!
---
I absolutely love how it's inextricably linked to the massacre. The falador massacre is absolutely one of the ALL TIME video game moments, up there with evo moment 34 and the [Loopzook](https://youtu.be/k-wFI9vTqto).
---
You can easily trap 2 of them in the more western room, i did it today without knowing that trapping is a thing
---
Switching to members as fast as possible is always the answer. Everything can be done more easily and more efficiently (for example, questing your attack to well over 40 without ever needing to train it).
---
TBH that's a high quality lure. Wouldn't even be mad.
---
Was expecting something much different in spam, then read the repeated message and mini map shown above lul.
---
Yeah violins went on for too long, plus I'm not sure if they were the right entertainment for your typical runescaper.

Also I think the female host does stuff for the BBC? Like BBC games.

It's worth noting he wasn't always edgy or whatever you want to call it. For a long time he was one of the most popular content creators who had done nothing wrong. Then he went weird.
---
Travelling so no playing... Just browsing Reddit
---
The extra effort of carrying water skins... unplayable!
---
not hard to be informed on rs these days, not like there are major updates every month.  we get what, 3 a year at best?
---
Not once do I recall saying it was Jagex's fault, I simply stated that I could not figure out how this issue happened. Virus scan was done and confirmed nothing out of the ordinary, Password had been changed the night before and not shared, Account was not recovered as all details remained the same from when I logged off.
---
For fucks sake. Not everything is some fucking dog whistle.
---
you are a lying saying your drops are covering your cost, so tl:dr dont lie to try and get reddit karma makes you look like a tool.
---
Yup, because these are the bots that are easiest to make. Finish tutorial island, put on some cheap gear that looks expensive, give it  100k and its ready to go. No huge cash stack  is needed because the bots never pay out, so the max risk on a ban is like 250k.
---
This is great
---
and now he'll be in textbooks one day
---
What do you guys think of soul wars being added to osrs ofc with a different reward system that being a nerfed version of the rs3 or changing it completely to something cosmetic like castle wars ??
---
SO TRUE NONE OF MY FRIENDS GET THIS!!!
---
what about me, 1700 killed no draw... so in essence if i do get one it would be less then 600k a hour.  pretty damn shit.
---
So your confirming you scammed your friend then.
---
I’d say 61 for rune crossbow would be nice or maybe 70 for dhide. People have done it in way scuffed gear.
---
?
---
Botting gold to sell for real money. Nobody panics.
---
Botting to protest for human rights of Hong Kong people. Everyone loses their mind!

modern banks are not ancient, just one century old

Thought this was a bait but it's a serious suggestion lmfao. So, say they remove the duel arena, what's to stop them going to RS3 duel arena staking, then they remove that, what's to stop them playing poker online then there's no middle man for cashing out (gold website etc) and they get addicted to that instead. Don't blame the game on addiction, people have addicted personalities, they should start there and sort their own life out.
---
and jagex would do it too
---
Freaking happened to me today..was in deep deep wildy on a hard clue. Running back to the ardy lever tele. And some a hole started barraging me..i swear i coulda made it back, but he had a teammate that IDK how tf he was not visible on my screen, and guess what his name was 'slash web' and guess what? He perfectly stood at the "slash web" spot next to the lever tele, and it fucking worked great for them, i attacked him in panic clicking mode, got skulled and lost the inventory amd shitty gear i was wearing. Didnt care about the gear i was just upset i was close to finishing the dam clue scroll &gt;.&lt; but i let 2 min pass and i was just like ehhhhh, its just a game. I actually give them props on that slash web trick they pulled, got me like a fool.
---
you are so very typically american, even if you live somewhere else. what a wonderful site we are on; where douches debate realworldproblems they dont know shit about nor have experienced first or second, maybe not even third hand, think they know better. go back to your safespace.
---
This has nothing to do with gambling. 
---
Addiction is real but most that claim “addiction “ really aren’t
---
That’s exactly what durial321 would say ...
---
sadly that we me. Lost my best gear that I I had just earned enough to buy and quit the game back then. Also broke the moniter.
---
I think what gets me most about this entire debate is the incorrect assumption that everyone makes regarding the level requirement of the Knights. While there's a general trend that higher level content is better/stronger, the power levels of content unlocks in RS have always been inconsistent as fuck, and even the mods stated that the level you unlock a piece of content doesn't dictate its balancing, the whole tier shit is just something the players made up and brought from other games.
---
Could you fight back if you got attacked?
---
enough gold sinks in the game, and items are suppose to go down in price as they exist longer.  lvl 70 gear should not cost 1b+ for all of osrs life..........
---
Democracy, the god that failed. By Hans Herman Hoppe
---
I did have my hand on his back.
---
I read that it was originally supposed to be a survival game, hence stats like fire making
---
Wasn’t implying unofficial gim unless you consider mains gim ... but with a very big group
---
The price of items thing is interesting, definitely know what you mean there, spend ages making money only for it to get wiped out in inflation ...
---
I dont think that this is the work of bots,
---
Lucky
---
My god man ... if it takes you 200 hours to learn pvp where you can literally only do 1 of 4 thing ... spec, tab, eat, venge ... you’re just not meant for this world 
---
It took me like 10 fights to go from bad to average, then maybe 10 more to go from average to better than most 
---
If I die, why did I die, if I win, why did I win - just ask yourself that and adjust
---
I doubt it, the backlash in this community especially would be colossal.
---
Thought was much lower than this ? Isn't an item now like 1 in 725,000 pts post update? Solos give usually over 30k roughly, id say the numbers closer to one in 30 or 25. My log supports that and most others do as well
---
They could try to get creative and set up sting operations, like having a Jmod pose as a dicing bot that sets up right by a bot that never gets muted and having a system in place to see which pmod shows up and tries to mute them without muting the other bot.

Could The Maidens blood spawn mechanic in the Theatre of Blood be changed?
---
Perhaps where they only spawn if a player steps on the blood she throws out?
---
Ruby bolts (e) already exist
---
You need elite diaries and grandmaster quest completed to use the stones as well
---
I'm just glad osrs wiki works
---
only if it makes it nondegradable
---
Any idea why superior bones arent even selling for as low at 10k? Never seen them crash this hard so suddenly.
---
Metal dragons in brimhaven dungeon can drop noted bars after you complete karamja elite diary, but otherwise no.
---
It actually wasn't for quite a few subs. New accounts couldn't place squares and you could place a square every 5 minutes. You used a program to generate the main image,  mapped it to coordinates,  then your sub brigaded those coordinates. Wars were fought over image space.
---
A friend and bans.
---
It may be against the rules but this one as it goes is pretty harmless. The people losing stupid amounts of wealth could probably afford new stuff. It's not like he was destroying the in game economy by duplicating items.

You guys couldn't even stop a pride event organized by one jmod.
---
You’re the one who got sent to lumby tho
---
The show was made by Americans. Some of the fiction regions are based off of Asian countries. If I had to guess, Fire Nation has a lot of similarities to Japan, Earth Kingdom has a lot of similarities to China, Water Tribe has a lot of similarities to Eskimos and the Air Nomads have a lot of similarities to Indian Monks (although in the show they are white).
---
Businessman is a strong word to describe him. He's a conman that takes loans and never pays them back and doesn't pay contractors. He's also had multiple casinos go out of business.

I love making them and havent in a while so I thought itd be fun
---
Not sure, but ill try to find some osrs pixel art
---
Omg I was a clan leader in that game
---
Nice man! keep up the grind!
---
Pretty dumb assumptions
---
&gt;	Engine work
---
Important work
---
If you weren’t so bad at the game you could easily tank most singles pkers. 
---
You all just choose to stay bad and complain instead of learning how to survive. I guarantee you I could complete almost any clue without dying to anyone in singles.
---
That's how it should be taken but looking at how the comments go on posts like this I'm not surprised they made a comment like that. People really get pissed off for being killed in the wilderness and say all sorts of stupid shit and down vote anyone calling them out on being dumb.
---
Wait until right after tomorrow's system update when the stock will be at default.
---
Yeah. THE BEST

It's not like bigger gaming companies using orchestras is ever any better. No this is best music bro
---
Playfusion they make the game Lightseeker which is one of those games that relies more on you buying figurines and cards than the actual game itself.
---
If you don’t give a shit, then ignore it and move on. It’s very very simple.
---
They've been evading the sale, they were only starting the process back then
---
Fukong is currently basically just going through bankruptcy in China &amp; still owns Jagex
---
Complicated situation
---
Playfusion is the company they made the warhammer card game
---
why do you keep spamming this shit
---
U high? Its 50/50 you get it or you dont.
---
Fukong is not a cooperative with government Chinese company, but it's also in the process of dying and when they do it's possible the game will be China's to auction.
---
If that happens we might get tencent and that would be horrible for all of us
---
So, how much time did it take to get from 300M to 3.2B?

goddamnit i knew something was up when he started running his hands through her hair. Got in the first part ngl.

You're right. I really need to stop saying shit without my contacts in.

Agree, I only play with sound when doing quests.

How much will you pay me to be your RS GF?  I got feet pics ;)

*sigh* unzips
---
Hey, retard, you were told that the community voted no. No one owes you an explanation as to why, nor do we need you to judge the intellectual value of our comments.  You don’t present a case for or against something whilst simultaneously overseeing the proceedings as the judge who ratifies the responses.  I suggest you stop being a pretentious douchebag or make your way back to RS3 where you can jerk yourself off whilst basking in the adulation your “rares” bring you.

Durial wasn't ban for this incident. He was later banned for rwt

I ask again, link me to the articles you mentioned.

What's your plan with the money?

With guthix rests mushrooms are pretty much safe. But as it stands for the rest of your xp varrock museum is the best method. Use world 304, it's the unofficial spec cleaning world.

Isn't it weird I can have the most powerful equipment, kill many creatures. Commit genocide against elves as an order of some dude in the jungle. (Rwanda/congo genocide alike). Yet I am unable to swing my weapon to kill a simple harmless person wielding stuff? Hell I'm suddenly able to do that if I jump a 1 meter gap.
---
We should be able to kill anyone anywhere. It would reduce the price of end game items as no one will be willing to risk to use said items (thus lowering demand).
---
My guess is you turned on protection for magic too late. You have to turn the prayer on before the attack animation even starts, otherwise you take the damage. The same thing could have happened with the ranger. Could have shot an attack right before it died and hit you.
---
Just triple name change and hope she didnt add u to ignore list.
---
I think there was a combat ring, not a portal. The house host was lagging too hard so he kicked everyone out. Anyone in the combat ring at the time kept their Attack option. Durial was later banned for rwt, not for bug abusing.
---
It's actually ridiculous, even when u put windows volume on 1 it's still fuckin ear-piercingly loud.
---

Not in the public eye tho.
---
Keep going, you’re on a streak.
---
I'm not being a pretentious douche bag lol, I'm aware the community voted no but this poll was around the start of Oldschool rs and people obviously voted for it to be that way because they've never owned a rare before. Nobody has given me a valid reason why it is "bad for the economy" because it literally isn't
---
You dare slander the heroic that is Pick and Shovel
---
BANK YOUR ITEMS
---
How much did you sell the jaws for?
---
If the community wants it
---
Why are you assuming their morals? Lots of people work at blizzard I am sure some support hong kong and some support the CCP.
---
It's like getting banned for saying the n word, westerners are so sensitive yet so ununderstanding. Everyone who says CCP is oppressing hong kong, they have been protesting for months without the CCP interfering, only vague reports. Trust me, if CCP wanted the protests to stop by sending in the military, it would be over in a day. But they respect the current law of self governance. Not oppressed.
---
My favoeites are Hespori fight music, shipwrecked and jungle 2?(monkey song on karamja) and some of the deep wild music are the greatest and some of the angstiest music ive ever heard! Music cape is something i aspire to get but need 75 slayer for gargoyle song :(
---
*Insert Spade drops and pvpers desperation meme*
---
Imagine supporting a company that supports America then? Probably 50x worse, but its ok.
---
Just reddit being reddit snd going crazy over shit that no one cares about in a week
---
I mean first of all i usually only gets piled at rev by 5-6 people, secondly i dont see whats wrong with voting for your own interest，i would have definitely voted no if jagex polled the entangle buff since that makes the teleblocker stronger and i believe entangle got no use in traditional pvp where 2 players gl each other and fight
---
they cant fix it, it happens i think whenever they use more than 1 layer of textures on an object or use transparency at all
---
And my ear damage only HCIM.
---
The fix for pvp is to take care about pvp cheat clients and that task is in progress :)
---
I think you mean Red God Good.
---
Yup
---
Blizzard literally has a Mission Statement. 
---
“Think Globally”
---
“Every voice matters”
---
Also you should get banned for saying the n word but that’s another issue.
---
Blizzard ignored their mission statement because Winnie the Pooh had a fat cry.
---
The time I erased my entire memory card by accident...
---
I really don't understand your point of view -- what makes him entitled?
---
blowpipe doesnt need any more cheap strong ammo...  rune darts arent even that expensive, and theres already good demand for amethyst
---
Morytania is unfinished though, darkmeyer isn't accessible currently.
---
I’m getting better xp with full melee gear (not obsidian).
---
I seriously hope they do these kinds of things, else it'll just be ironman with a gimmick like all the other IM modes.
---
found the adult
---
How about no since the beginning of the TDMM we euw people had to suffer with horrible ping. Always on an NA world. Now its ur time to suffer.
---
Suit yourself, bootliker.
---
Thats why OSRS is on 1% volume in windows settings
---
No. A tradeable dye for dark graceful would make the dark color useless, unless the dye is extremely rare like 3rd age.
---
I think this is more about trying to bait jagex into making a mistake similar to Blizzard.
---
9/11 never forget
---
This guy just wanted to flex that we won some money, not answer any questions. Weird guy
---
You seem like the kinda guy who would laugh at a mugging
---
Oof
---
For the sake of how humans actually hear sound logarithmically. There isn't much difference between 50% and 100% to your ears if that's a 1:2 ratio so just in case the Jagex mods working on this don't know this detail.
---
The settings we want are
---
Nil
---
-9dB
---
-6dB
---
-3dB
---
0dB
---
That way each setting "sounds" half as loud as the setting above it.

Some one 4 shotted jad with that set up not long ago, the healers didnt even get a chance to spawn so i highly doubt it would be even slightly a struggle with that set up

🦀🦀🦀 MAINLAND CHINA WONT RESPOND TO THIS THREAD 🦀🦀🦀
---
That’s called dyslexia
---
They patched this, it works for the step now.
---
you still need con for staches, raids, quests, and other uses could be added, think of the ease of operation of this system, the current irons still would have to grind con, because using these pools/portals would be op for them, everytime I do corp people are just like whos house we using, this settles it. The people that leech con are gonna continue leeching con anyways, This could be a huge sink of a lot of resources and bring the community together in something that people can actually use.
---
I bet there are nerds who would genuinely like to have this added, because they know they can only dream of having the tanned, masculine, marble cut physique of hot guys such as myself.
---
do zalcano. I went from 85-91 mining by just making good money and watching movies on my 2nd monitor.

I'm just here to say "you chose to limit yourself" as nobody else has yet.

He was absolutely banned for this, cursed you, the guy who was having the first 99 construction house party ended up getting banned for RWT later on.

It's not the player options that make him flicker it's the fail animation clipping with the stack of 3 or 4 or more players

Green d hide wizzy hats when??

Too much drama in this community tbh 😒

Na I know my password

I just checked and it's still a screenshot of something happening in the game...

THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THE RICH SWEATY TWITTER NECKBEARDS WANT YOU! SO FAR BEHIND IN THE ECONOMY RACE THAT YOU'LL NEVER CATCH UP! DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, FREE YOURSELF FROM THE SHACKLES OF POVERTY! DEMAND BUFFED DROPS FROM JAGEX! LET MY BOY POOKIE OUT!
---
I only log in once.
---
I'm a little late, but I would guess that Woox uses the original binds.
---
Which is just f1 inv, f2 gear, f3 prayer, f4 magic, f5 special attack. 
---
You could set whatever you like of course. It won't make a difference once you get used to it.
---
yea its worth getting a dhcb
---
Q
---
W-whats in the montherlode mine?
---
Could be wrong, but I think people normally farm in graceful.
---
they'd just loadup everything and wildy suicide anyways.
---
Yep, people who weren't in the house party and affected by the glitch could be attacked but not fight back.
---
The volume slider is an integral part of OSRS gameplay. Changing it like you suggest would create huge imbalances in the game and would require changing tons of other options menu entries to accommodate.
---
OSRS was meant to be played either with no sound or with so much sound that you can actually see the screen with your eyes closed. 
---
Third party volume adjustment tools, like the windows volume slider, should be bannable.
---
Play the game like it was intended you dainty eared dope.
---
Could be wrong but I think they're trying to get Chinese people booted offline as China is actively censoring messages with certain keywords.
---
You ok?
---
Someone is spamming your acc with login attempts with a bot. Unless it stops, you'll have to change your login info through some sort of support channel

Oh look, an oxbow lake!
---
Bro, please keep making these, original content, and its simple and nice on the eyes.
---
1) Full obsidian (with the sword and berzerker necklace) blows nezzy/whip/d boots out of the water, doubly so since strength is by far the most important melee stat, and you can't train strength directly with a whip. For slayer, though, you'll want a slayer helm (imbued) and strength gear. DScim is fine for slayer but whip is great too I'd you don't mind not training strength.
---
2) I would say yes, even as low as level 50 there's a lot of useful things to have in your house such as portals, an altar for prayer restoration, a mounted glory, etc.
---
3) This depends a lot on your block list and ability to do tasks quickly and efficiently, so it's hard to give a straight answer. At max efficiency turael boosting is better but personally I prefer wildy slayer.
---
4) Are you talking mith darts in a bp, or just throwing darts? If the latter, msb(i) is likely better, if the former, then bp. You can check the dps calculator against whatever npc you're fighting to compare setups, higher dps=faster training.
---
Just get a 3rd age
---
Read your history
---
nice
---
Pked = lose stuff, but the other player doesn't get it.
---
I think this exists it is called deadman mode
---
I don’t see how you can feel severally limited with 2 unless if you’re a twitch streamer? My 2nd monitor is literally just a spot for discord
---
How do you even define "minimum stats"
---
Yeah lol, just having a laugh.
---
That's a nice upgrade.
---
The kneejerk reaction they had was fucking pathetic and it made me sick. Do you support hong kong if you dont mind me asking? Do you also onow of the atrocities that china has comitted?
---
I do agree that to an extent politics should be left out of gaming, but a country in love with gaming is pretty much on its way to being torture town. I don’t mind someone bringing light to the issue in a post game interview, that’s all he did.
---
Much less so, there was a nerf to void a while ago that made it a lot worse at most places. Regular void is never good except iirc for a few pk builds. The only place you would bring full tribrid (or even hybrid) evoid would be as a learner at Theatre of Blood. Elite void range is good for vorkath, Theatre, and has niche uses as an advanced switch at Chambers of Xeric.
---
Rigour?
---
No worries. Yeah it was like every ~7,000 pts = 1% now it’s like ~8,000ish so roughly 1/40-1/43 without being overly specific. But happy to help.
---
Got mine at 14kc, first pet😁
---
Well, whats your time? Dhcb is still better for consistency, you dont need to bring melee with it
---
no to poor
---
Wow.
---
Blowpipe isnt going to give 50 second pbs like you see people getting with a dchb, what times are you averaging?
---
They became my favorite band after seeing that video
---
That's an awfully nice pancake. Congrats.
---
That's prolly the biggest thing if I had to guess, gear looks fine.
---
Rigour is deff worth saving for tho, relatively cheap rn too
---
best time is 1 55 but thats rare that i get sub 2min
---
I do this but it still takes almost a full minute to long-tap every pile of useless items to try and find the seed drop. GE value of stuff like irit seeds are 12gp so they are either hidden under every other drop or are on top but blend in with the ground too well to notice without running to draw every monster away then running back and clicking every tile.
---
about 2:30 to 3mins
---
HAHAHAHA SAY THE THING
---
Pricecheck?
---
This though. There is satisfaction gained from setting someone back. Also a lot of dumb people carry their cash stack or open caskets while in the wild.
---
sometimes i dont even hit tbh
---
Cox treats me nicely anyway I'm averaging a drop every 16 solos or so atm so will be a while til my rng balances out. 
---
Can't say the same for any other boss in the game, but I'm blessed that of all bosses I'm lucky at chambers
---
Don't worry, nothing going on it's all coincidence. /S
---
Vannaka does have high weighting for Basilisk, but there are way to many monsters that can be assigned by him, making that weight mean less. So, you probably aren't as unlucky as you think.
---
BIS???
---
I'll just continue to max my main until GIM comes out. When GIM comes out I'll play that with friends and do the AFK stuff on my main if it's not already maxed by then.
---
There is a bones to peaches happening in there.  And also a SOL spec
---
1) I think melee has the most variety of weapons to choose from, even though majority of them are practically obsolete. I personally enjoy melee the best.
---
2) yes it’s easier to get it from mobs/as a reward.  It currently takes almost maxing smithing skill to start crafting rune armor which you equip at level 40 def
---
3) ranged is used more than other combat styles for PvM
---
monkaS
---
Heres me, a pure with no shield, 1.5k kc
---
looks like clippy
---
So I did this when my bank was around 150M and it easily was the best decision I made.  I think my fastest kill before I bought rigour with the DHCB was around 1:15-1:20 but can range anywhere from there to 3 minute kills based on RNG.  It is so much more consistent than the blowpipe and because you can pray ranged you will increase the number of kills/trip drastically.  Rigour is definitely worth it and should be the next upgrade as it makes your kills a lot more consistently even when RNG isnt on your side.
---
That sounds normal without rigour. Definitely work towards that and dhcb
---
I agree. This is not an issue with Jagex support.
---
Currently it's 0% - 85% - 92% - 96% - 99%.
---
Ppl @ runefest don’t wear deodorant.
---
They can, it's not like it's something that they just aren't capable of doing. Some bots do it.
---
More like 2100kc. Zalcano is around 17k exp an hour.
---
Got rag to 11% last night.
---
motivated me to get back at the pet grind. thank u

happened to me at KQ. !remind me 6 hours I'll throw up a screenshot of it when I get home

This is sick

China isn't communist, it's Dengist, state capitalist

And it was capitalism that lead to this.

It might have something to do with the 3PC announcement, and the one-click training plugins. A bunch of people selling high-tier bones at a premium would crash the price.
---
Yes. Runelite's main developer is dedicated to fully complying with all of jagex's requests. This means updates to the main runelite version (what most people use) carry no risk of punishment for users.
---
If you don't try you would never know whether you would succeed. A revolution is happening in Hong Kong right now, over two Millions people marched on the street since June and it is now spread across NBA, South Park, and Blizzard in defense of the universal value  #StandwithHongKong
---
Yes. They're all right next to each other, so if one takes a little too long to respawn, it doesn't matter! There's one right beside it!
---
And a bank not *too* far away, especially if you have shortcut.
---
[deleted]
---
There are massive pro-demoncracy protests going on in Hong Kong at the moment.
---
China does not like this because they do not like freedom of speech or other basic human rights.
---
There have been efforts by china via the american companies they own or have influence in to censor and silence any speech about these protests.
---
Why if waiting for it to come out means you’re playing for the wrong reasons is beyond stupid. Some of us have maxed accounts that we don’t want to play on anymore and why start playing an Ironman now to restart in 6 months. I quit a year ago but will be back the day group drops until then the games stale
---
Tencent (a chinese company) owns Riot Games.
---
The casters are Riot employees.
---
Unclear if they aren't 'allowed' to say Hong Kong, or is they are just avoiding it.
---
but, Here are two examples of casters about to say Hong Kong Attitude, stopping themselves mid-sentence, and saying HKA instead.
---
If you want a full tinfoil hat theoy... I think China doesnt want people searching for 'Hong Kong' so that they dont learn about the protests.
---
What did Swamp man ever do to you?
---
Fukong Interactive Entertainment was going to sell to Platinum Equity to remove their debt but after profit margin rise they might have halted for now?
---
Kill times aren’t drastically different with dhcb, but you don’t have to spec and you get way more kills per trip which increases your gold per hour by a lot. I average 5 kill trips with 90 def, 96 range. Good trips get 6 bad trips get 4.
---
No barrows gloves lmao
---
Pffft, not even maxed, only level 95 run energy
---
PLEASE
---
this has happened to me a few times as well. lmfao like ok
---
As long as u have auto retaliate on it automatically removes you from the stone.
---
use a DHCB, if you cant afford it then vork isnt worth doing. I sold my entire bank for DHCB and rebuilt with that. I was able to buy rigour and now i have 1minute20second kills on average
---
I think it was that he started as a temp one month thing and then was hired normally after that. Some likely were on contracts for X years or such that are now expiring, but I am not sure if all the mods leaving hit that point recently. If it is just unfortunate timing for a bunch of contracts ending and nothing more beyond that, then I don't blame them if they wanted to move elsewhere. We know from past mods like Ronan that Jagex doesn't always provide the best growth for a career and I haven't heard good things about the pay either.
---
At this point, why not?
---
The dude legitimately sounds mentally ill. He literally hates the game but plays it because in his opinion there’s nothing better out there. Sounds like he’s chronically addicted to video games. He could find a new hobby that he doesn’t hate.
---
where are you getting these?? these backgrounds are epic I loved using them all
---
Oh hai Mark.

Dude blew 10k on a set up just to play a game from 2004.

I try to fire grapples at Kree'arra, I teleport to Lletya when I want to go to Priffdinas, I teleport to the Wildnerness in full Bandos when completing clues, I tank Graardor in a Karils top with a defender because I'm impatient, I forget to enable recoil on my Suffering and, worst of all, I forget to turn run off at Vorkath and look like a lunatic skrt'ing all over the place.
---
Bro punctuation.
---
Well done, Jal-Yt.
---
It's actually 73. Rachel got pregnant and Chris was arrested for stealing a bike.
---
Jagex is over 300 people.
---
Guess we're just going to have to disagree.
---
Hey man I’m new to reddit just chill
---
Right? If you hate what is in your opinion the best game on the market, doesn’t that mean you hate video games? Why not do something else with your time? Read a book or something, draw, develop a new skill, something.
---
Yeah if WoW players quit en masse because of Blizzard’s actions imagine what the OSRS community would do if Jagex pulled some similar shit. It’d be catastrophic.
---
What a pervert.
---
I think Jagex only seems like a good place to work if you already love RS.
---
It looks like it's only the art and music departments that can really use the knowledge they gained from their time at Jagex elsewhere.  
---
Having worked for 5 years at the same place looks good, but when literally no one else in the world uses that language it's just kind of obsolete.
---
cool but that’s not the point of the protest
---
Pretty sure you can skip the entire tutorial now?

People were following him because it was unbelievable he was attacking and killing people. The most prominent video is of a pker trying to get Durial to attack him (not knowing he couldn’t attack back). We’re lucky we have a video of all as it wasn’t common to record back then.
---
You can go onto the wiki, select a slayer master (in this case [Duradel](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Duradel)) and see under "Alternatives" what monsters fall into that task.
---
I think you get a notification every 10 kills if you wear a combat bracelet. Is it because sometimes you’re wearing one and other times you’re not?
---
Where's the rhino scene at the end?

99 99 99

I'd be surprised if it takes anyone longer than 90 minutes.

I started at KO for England and Montenegro and was done by 3-1.

They are. I assume the statues looked like that before dark beasts where added.

Well, if you're new then you should be educated on the dangers of phishing.

Also don't drop your items when a friendly guy offers to give you 500m or take them to dangerous places.

Just tele out if you don't hit with BGS.
---
Entangle does damage so that's a no go
---
Smh, yes you are correct. Completely forgot about this since I take it off while ranging. Thank you for the quick solution
---
? Have you watched his videos? I'd argue he has woox tier game knowledge
---
I'd say it is a bit surprising. Mods like Harrison seemed to really like the game and Shauney seemed pretty sad to announce his leaving. I don't think they were forced to leave, so it probably was a tough decision between a job the like and their long term career. I'm also not sure how much management is to blame since Ash said he preferred the current management to the previous, which is at least reassuring for OSRS.
---
Damn this is proof there’s no respect for veterans. Wtf are these downvotes, you guys should be ashamed of yourselves. 
---
I salute thee, soldier.
---
They’re in the process of selling the game to some company out of Cali

Okay, you're right. Someone dressed as UID, ROLL, BET, RNG bots, advertising gambling would be a false ban. (Sarcasm)

What does trapping him do?

Do ardy master farmer next! Nobody knows how to trap him and keep him trapped
---
I remember that there were more at the time, but I haven't been able to find them since. Any idea where I can find them?
---
99 is even better though: unlimited POH teleports that won't take up inventory space if you wear the skillcape.
---
I just heard about that, will change it.
---
I've followed that game from the Kickstarter, it's my favorite game by far.
---
Yeah for sure. With DHCB you don't have nearly as much variability. Most of my kills (94 range, max gear and rigour) are right around 2 minutes, and rarely ever exceed 2:45, if ever.
---
Except you could buy and instantly sell an item and you'd loose money. At ant given time the buy price is higher than the sell price so if the price remains the same or only goes up slightly you will lose money.
---
&gt;I'm an experienced player  
---
&gt;was just scammed
---
Na
---
Prif
---
I had heard that somewhere but couldn't find a source so didn't want to include it. Pretty fucked up.

Unlocking more content as fast as you can ruins the game?

Armadyl crossbow is one of the last upgrades you’ll use for raids 1. It’s very low bang for your buck compared to other upgrades. Check out Chemyst’s video on YouTube about gear progression.
---
[Blizzard stated it was against their TOS(under a catch-all "don't make us look bad" rule).](https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304)
---
They turn into tokkul
---
It’s frustrating to do work for no reason whether or not it’s ultimately a good direction for the game. It’s not about being in touch or right or wrong. And I highly doubt there are ideas that move forward without approval from the team.
---
Thanks for the suggestion but I don't have VR gear lol.
---
What is this referencing?
---
Clearly, results are there for you to see. Maybe turn up the brightness on your computer?  
---
They take 5 months to release a "patch" to "bug" these bots into malfunctioning.
---
Bot makers take 1-2 weeks to fix/adjust in order to bypass the "patch"  
---
Another 5 months, another "patch"
---
See where I'm going with this? These software updates for detection are useless, a waste of money/time.  
---
Hire someone to manually apply these bans. Not necessarily to people skilling, but dicing bots can be 100% banned instantly on P2P worlds, they have been around for a long time and will continue to be around.  
---
They will then resort to clan chats to gamble/discord (as they have been already).
---
It takes 1 undercover Jagex Mod to shut the cc down/manually ban the bots trading from the discord server.
---
No they're the old dark beasts model.
---
Not endorsing a message doesn't means being ok with the opposite one
---
ramblings of a very tired redditor... I say dumb shit when I'm tired.
---
Please do
---
I also want them to come out and make a statement but they certainly won't. They're owned by a Chinese parent company. I doubt that Jagex itself even COULD say anything in the unlikely event that they wanted to.
---
Getting less than 1 ehp/hr? That's a reportin

You know he's blasting the new travis scott

Some guy murdered his girlfriend in mainland and fled to HK to completely get away with it which is a common trend among a lot of wealthy people. In response they introduced a bill to allow the mainland to extradite criminals. US and UK are able to extradite people from HK but apparently the country their a part of shouldn’t so they started protesting and it gained traction as a call to arms among rich students that don’t want to move to a socialist system that prevents them from exploiting the working class. The protests have welcomed fascists, partnered with US intelligentsia and carry around banners praising US imperialism and the colonial government that has given hong kong one of the most atrocious wage gaps and horrifying working conditions.
---
Fair enough, I guess it's safe to say you will lose a nominal amount of money no matter what.  However I think that's a distinct difference from what the person I originally replied to was insinuating.  Buying/selling gear as you need it isnt going to lose you any substantial amount of money is the only point I was really trying to make.
---
Who gives a shit
---
Actually kinda true
---
I don't think you're in a position to talk about any kind of basic understanding.
---
I've never worn a combat bracelet, yet used to get these messages. Most bizarre.
---
Who says they are suppose to be mid level content? None of jagex post claimed they would be mid level and they drop a BiS item.
---
I agree, mid level starts at about 97 and ends at about 98

You guys know he's claiming to be a victim, not durial right?
---
There is nothing for me to get over, I’m not the one who is upset about dying in the wilderness. I’m sorry you lack the basic skills required to defend yourself while out there. But that is no reason to take it out on the other players that do. Maybe one day you will be somewhat decent enough at combat and have the ability to do whatever it is that you do in the wilderness without getting combo’d out by some g mail pure testing out their account for the first time. Ahh you are forgetting about dragon claw specs bud. Considering I don’t use the weapons you have mentioned. Also I’m not too sure where Americans came into the picture, that is definitely not my nationality. Did they do something to upset you too? They won their independence from you many years ago, there is no need to still be salty. Maybe you should talk to a psychologist about all these resentments you have against all these silly things.
---
5 is the dust pan
---
You literally just compared them after saying they're not comparable.  The comparison you made was that one has more features than the other.
---
That's a comparison.
---
Time to make justiciar chain body!
---
Honestly skillers are just attention seekers
---
It will if you're regularity selling 100+m in gear. It might not seem like much but it adds up quickly at times.
---
I was actually thinking reddit was over-blowing this situation, but now with harrison and shauney b2b like that starting to get worried.
---
Sorry I'm not going to read that, it seems like you're very involved emotionally and it just doesn't do it for me. I'll vote no and you can poison your dagger to make things more exciting for your Pk'ing adventures. Take care lol
---
Nah, works the same way as other trees. 1/8 chance for the tree to fall down every time you chop it. There aren't a set number of logs the tree will give, it's just random every time you chop a log, kinda like drop rates from monsters.

---
You definitely havent watched his videos... he does crazy stuff like tick eating (not that crazy), interface stacking, fake logouts, animation breaking, etc. He does stuff that the game definitely wasnt made to do. I have 2175 total and cant do most of the stuff he does
---
And you can continue to play your game with fewer people.  I'll play other games with significantly better QoL features.
---
He very well could have been trolling seeing as op commented he tp'ed immediately after
---
Congratulations, I wish I was as lucky as you
---
&gt; He infamously killed someone with a green partyhat and equipped it mid-massacre.
---
I know bug abuse it wrong and that’s terrible for the other players who lost hundreds of millions of gp in items but that is one of the most badass things in runescape if not all of gaming I’ve ever heard. The sheer balls on that man.
---
Do you have an alt with fally shield to point you around?
---
Pretty sure bracers are better if you are only ranging and using prayer
---
the point is Jagex probably can't find anyone to replace them if they pay so shitty
---
*Oh bother*
---
I appreciate artists who accept critique!
---
From 62-70 you’re looking between 8-9k Milton glass at about 75-80k exp an hour. Very afk and it will cost you between 600k and 650k I believe!
---
I thought you had to be in j mod clanchats 25/8 and constantly lick their balls and respond with smileys and shit.
---
If you want to multi skill, I found black dhide bodies effective and quick.
---
Alch them after to make a solid profit. :)
---
Why should Jagex release a statement, nothing will change if they do or they don’t. They’re a game developer and that’s all they should focus on. There’s no need to drag politics into this
---
Well ok. How about an NPC expansion then to the canves and dungeons to include more npcs in the wild? Skeletal wyverns in deep wild wouldn't be a bad idea would it? Maybe have a buffed drop tabled compared to those found outside of wilderness?
---
Chop chop!
---
lol oh, its referencing the people who paid for nieve art bro
---
bro 😎💪
---
Right now double cosmics is more gp/h. You profit around 300gp per essence, while with nats its around 230gp
---
When 75+ combat stats is considered low-level...
---
we get it, you have several 99's, you didnt have to show all your skills
---
very cool :\]
---
muh generic orchestral music
---
muh game of thrones soundtrack
---
So long as we have daddy Ash.
---
And that's true as well but having that much gear and access to vork/raids type moneymakers also means that extra bit that adds up is easily replaced.  Though I'm not quite, quite there yet so I'll have to concede with a lack of experience.
---
So brave
---
Thank you! Should I be doing through the abyss with double cosmics or should I do zanaris with a necklace of passage (to wizard tower)/ duel ring (for bank) then dramen staff?
---
I agree. I don't know what i was talking about before. I think i pressed reply with one intention but forgot what to write so i ended up with that...
---
Video shows otherwise
---
No, I'm not confused. I don't know why you keep saying it's political; Chinese owned games are banning streamers for pointing out the Chinese government is shooting its citizens in Hong Kong. It's really not about politics and more about human rights. But hey, I can't pull your head out of your ass so go ahead and keep whining about your precious tournament.
---
At least you don’t have to deal with pesky things like human rights /s

How is this a magic only account, it's obvious you have at least 4 prayer

Okay I stopped playing a couple months ago but stop into this sub from time to time because, frankly, you guys have the best meme game on Reddit.  
---
Could someone please fill be in on why it seems as if a JMod is leaving every 1-2 weeks?  Is this normal for Jagex, are the positions backfilled?
---
No but my media presence is pretty new, maybe if i keep it up something will happen. Thanks for the comment!
---
Ok bye
---
With that rng, just make a new account.
---
Why the fuck would they make a statement about something completely unrelated to them?
---
meh. I mainly try to kill them for the hides and bones since their gear is trash. Why kill dragons when you can kill bots.
---
Thanka alot!
---
Even if it was a 2H weapon? Like surely there is some situation where it's okay.
---
Make it cost 10 mahogany planks, a gold leaf, rune nails, and some stupid unique item like a book-end. The cost of completing all 6 books is also something like 2m, so the overall cost could be a lot closer to Dinh's.
---
How does that apply to Activision though?

Some people like being higher on the highscores. I like training cooking cause it's easy when I just don't feel like trying at all, and is easy to pick up or quit and do something else.
---
One of the most iconic infamous events in gaming history. Hell we even associate a song and a date 6/6/06 to this event. I can even tell you where I was in game when it happened. Was surreal reading the private messages from people in that world
---
They removed the followers of Iban because Iban is dead. Its the same thing with a large portion of other enemies/npcs in the underground pass, they all served/sought after/wanted to kill Iban.
---
Lmao I never thought of it that way
---
This aged well
---
Gotchu - I imagined it as something that essentially turned off auto-regen.
---
Dont forget the tinder in the far back.
---
Never tested the Zanaris method so i dont know the rates. However the abyss is pretty efficient and dont have any high requirements. Also you dont need tiaras, so you can wear full graceful with the abyss method.
---
Thanks much, when inktober is over ill have an actual osrs story to follow, maybe starting at from easy to hard quests etc.
---
That's what state capitalism is. 
---
Communism is a society where workers control their workplace: they decide working hours, how profits get distributed, what items to produce, etc.
---
China is decidedly not that, and never will be, because the authoritarian government controls the workplace.
---
Protests in Hong Kong. 
---
Chinese police are shooting people in the streets for fun.
---
Hong Kong people want help.
---
Hearthstone player brings that protest to a blizzard stream
---
Blizzard promptly bans him, bans the interviewers, takes away prize money, etc.
---
People are pissed now. Blizzard obviously cares about making Chinese government happy rather than helping out people that are literally being subjected to genocide in Hong Kong right now. 
---
So let’s upset China ourselves. Let’s do it on platforms with blizzard or activions name on it so that they know WHY we protest. Let’s show other companies that we aren’t afraid to do it and will do it to them too. 
---
There’s a 2nd fucking holocaust happening in Hong Kong right now and companies prefer money over saving fucking lives.
---
I am honestly tempted
---
You know what i care about more? Keeping shitty politics out of this game.
---
Yea i get that. I ment more what the goal was. 100m total exp? Top 1000k con? 69420420 exp?
---
As it is now they're spending hours manually removing bots 1 by 1. While the botters have scripts pumping them out by the 100s with little to no work on thier end. As of now there seems to be no system to catch them other than happening apon them. At least with some system in place in forces the botters to put in effort and change their scripts. As for innocent players being caught in the detection no innocent player spams what the gamble bots do all day in the g.e. For these bots to work they need to say something to identify themselves to players so they can use them and these thing are always consistent between them. As for clear cut rules that can be avoided, you can make rules for you bot detection system without releasing what those rules are to the general public, which they already do for other types of bots. Which makes it hard for the botters to figure out what they did to cause detection.
---
        
---
Ps Ive only been referring to the gamble bots you see in the GE not any of the other types.
---
can you tell me what the other item you can get is because I'm too lazy to care that much to go over there but I care enough to want to know
---
You can PM I won't tell
---
Thanks for the critique, i definately gotta work on my story telling, i know its one thing that will make my comics as good as ive been wanting.
---
Worthless reply thx
---
This weeks update most likely. Otherwise next week for sure.
---
Some guy at barb fishing said hello , a few people said hi back 
---
He then proceeded to tell us he reported everyone who didn’t reply as they’re probably bots and he heard that’s how you become a jmod.
---
I don’t know why but it just annoyed me so much
---
OP doesn't even play this game. He's just baiting.
---
Man I've never played efficiently and I never will lol. Zolcano already seems super boring after just 1 kc and if I've already got the pet I dont see a need to go back. Now that vorkie tho.. I'm still hunting him
---
shout out wisconsin
---
They fixed that
---
That's low level in terms of pvm
---
Why do you say things like this, when you don't know what you're talking about?
---
This. I wish KBD dropped more valuable supplied like more moderns bosses. Only thing you can get that is good is the visage, dragon pick, and pet really. all other drops are not worth much.
---
Never knew you could burn chickens inside that house... i used to run all the way back to Lumbridge wtf man.
---
Not unless it was very recent
---
I was always under the impression that these basilisk knight were something like this: Complete a "master" quest, then \*take a stab\* at the Basilisk Knights. Hence, should be a pain to kill, aka not camp-able by most players.
---
You could try getting jad as a slayer task and using slayer helm(i) with dhides. But since its ypur first try at jad you could have a few practice runs before the task.
---
Ok, I wanted to train mining and always though Zalcano gave no XP till I came across a reddit posted 2 months ago. Might give it a shot and make some money too!
---
People say this but it's never "easily" unless you have a TBow
---
The healers heal Jad for WAY more than people think, even with the absolute maximum setup for a blowpipe (maxed range, rigour, dragon darts) they're gonna be offsetting the amount of damage you do by a lot. I'd recommend with that setup at least tagging two of the healers then trying to out-dps the other two, just so the fight doesn't take three times as long for no reason.

Im definitely not sure as i didnt know any f2p players who got a 99 in rs2, but i thought the capes gotten in f2p areas were f2p back then.
---
yes, these are the people that made karil's crossbow.
---
oh god his twitter is covered in k-pop shit, i bet this guy is a beta irl
---
same hungry overlords so i dont think anything's gonna change
---
A whole hour a day for a week and you're done. Oh no!! Lol
---
I was going for top 1,000. I noticed how little the skill was trained post-99, I had some leftover planks, and that it would take less than an hour to boost myself into the top 1k. Ended up in top top 700 actually.
---
this is cool but imagine how good it would be if people gave a shit about this outside of how this affected their videogames
---
Are these lemmings? Lol

not sure about the /s

Yeah I get the whole runecrafting bad meme but do you not see anything wrong with that?

You have runelite at work?

Yeah, no. That thing is completely busted.

Returning to a Chinese companies game to protest china is about as OSRS player logic as I could imagine.

Wow what a great job!

Normally when people get married they've kinda been together for a good amount time. He's also probably just making a joke out of it

That's a tricky one because tree chopping is coded as an environment sound. I recall the devs saying it'd be a pain in the ass to fix.

As your new don’t listen to everyone about downloading runelite before I see you post about getting hacked cos you downloaded the wrong one. Just go to the main RuneScape website and click download client. Then when you know what your doing then go download runelite if you want to making sure it’s runelite.NET not .org not .com NET.
---
Expecting everyone to reply is fucking stupid, but I have sometimes reported ppl for botting when they are constantly tick perfect skilling non stop for hours and not responding to shit. Maybe it's just a 50% chance they are botting , but fuck it.
---
The official client is from oldschool.runescape.com. Could also look into Runelite which adds alot of little functions like slightly nicer graphics (Anti aliasing, further draw distance, skybox, animation smoothing), better performance, bank tags, Ground Items (Shows name and value of items on the ground), lets you look up GE values and player stats directly on the client.
---
I don't think you have to worry about space. It doesn't take up much.

I'm not sure if you can full screen it but you can make the window take up the full screen.

Not working for me either, have spectrum as well.

There's definitely high level players who dislike the runner meta. I think some kind of buff to non-runner methods would be one of the more welcomed buffs to a skill, especially if it would make RC viable without relying on others for good rates

ooh, a 12 day old account that likes to scream about the CIA and bootlick china.

Weird number of these accounts in this thread

I find it hilarious that a fully geared, 4 man team rolls up on me while I'm wearing shit gear and risking nothing, perfectly clear on what the point of the wilderness is though :D
---
Eh it's going to crash divine super combats so nah. The players with the herblore lvl to mix these don't need extra crystal shards because they can just buy it cheap from the GE from players with low herblore lvl. This will then increase the amount of divine supercombats in circulation --&gt; ultimately crashing the price. 
---
This is just an attempt from OP to merch lmao no point in it because you can just go straight to divine super combats
---
I was thinking the knees, but you do you
---
The guy I responded to tacitly agreed with me by referring to this as a "second Holocaust". He knows there's only been one true Holocaust, yet somehow thinks there can be a second involving China.
---
&gt;ask yourself why Chinese people do go around having opinions
---
Their internet is censored, they are killed for having religion, they have no access to information. "Why don't they have x opinion???" Because the Chinese government won't let them have that opinion.
---

Am I missing something or?

Steven bots are fuckin hilarious tbf

We should actually try and get everybody to announce when they're getting the 99 so we can meet there an all chant "do it, do it, do it, do it"
---
Only regular tasks, always skip or block any of the boss tasks such as DKS or Jad. Having to think about more than one enemy attacking with more than one single type of attack requires way more brain power than theirs is capable of producing. If they can’t watch their hentai and do it at the same time it’s just not going to happen.
---
Is he like the Mod Mat K of RS3?
---
Quick, go grab an air staff and a shitton of Law runes
---
its true that Most sweaty efficient skilling doesn’t bring many resources or finished products into the game that matter, or tank the cost of certain items to oblivion. Lava runes for instance, yet steam runes, which are only 5% slower, are 14 times the cost of lavas and result in profit with only slightly lower experience rates. Gold bars, a byproduct of fast smithing training, are 1/3 the price of the gold needed to make them, while other high grade bars are equal to or exceed the price of the ore and coal needed to make them (interestingly enough, it’s the price of the coal needed to make them in the blast furnace, as using the normal amount of coal to make bars is not done by anyone). 
---
However skilling is definitely necessary to the game economy’s health. items that skilling produces that are positive are cooked food, high level ranged ammunition from both smithing and fletching, and potions/balanced potion prices along with herbs and secondaries from herblore.
---
Ahhhhhhh. Ignoring it = kosher. Being mad for penalizing speaking about it = not. 
---
More of that solid logic.
---
I don't care which of you wants to karma whore these out but I'm loving these nostalgic wallpapers. Is there a list for all of them?
---
Just go back and get ur stuff?

Yeah because every method for mid-lvls need to lose you money. Money making is only for the sweaty try-hards that need to 3 tick everything
---
Unneeded buffs to Range tbh half this game is already forced with range bosses, blowpipe being meta for majority of slayer etc.

He was raising awareness on a stream and got banned by Blizzard for that. If the world ignores what China is doing to the population of Hong Kong they will get away with it.

Java is still relevant.  Being able to code, adapt, work through the backend spaghetti code of a consistently updated and changing, incredibly successful and at a time unique game like Runescape has a lot selling to it to someone hiring.  Along with the fact these people aren't learning one language and calling it quits.
---

---
Why would that fence stop you from reaching over to chop it down? The real problem is that we chop trees at the middle of the trunk
---
Yeah! One of my next ideas was going to be that. A sort of 'potion sink' where you add doses into the items themselves. Naturally this means the items would have charges, but I think that's fine. 
---
You would still also be limited to using in regards to their respective cooldown. (7 or 8 minutes) So it'd be useful to have these items, as well as potions which you can still drink whenever you want.
---
lmao

Ye this subreddit has no idea about corporate life, much less software devs in the gaming industry.

Also, jagex pays an average wage for junior devs, but it is absurdly low *for the area they are headquartered in*.

Do I smell upgrades for said crossbow?

No you're doing something else but have the bot running on a second monitor or something like that. You're never actually clicking stuff in game, the bot is.

def send some pics. i didnt even use pixel art i just kinda went off what i thought it looked like lol thats why its mediocre :/

Welp they can’t if they wanted to. Just saying i’m done with blizzard and activision in general and returnering to the game I played before even if they are just as worse.

This hits too close to home. Just started the grind today.
---
Yeah, but then you wouldn't get banned by my report. I totally respect that people don't wanna talk, I've gotten more like that the more I've played. But when I'm quite certain someone is botting I'm not holding back that report.
---
I agree, I have high runecrafting and I don’t like the runner meta.
---
The fact that a lot of players had to grind running back and forth to the altar to get the level they have means that many probably wouldn’t approve of any changes that make the grind faster or easier because they had to do it in the first place. 
---
I like the sound of the proposed Moritania update - mining special rune essence sounds a bit more afk and if you mine 100% of the essence you need to get to 77 you’ll spend significantly less time running back and forth but more time in total if you include the mining you have to do.
---
I died xD
---
Yeah the guys stupid but customer support is suppose to effectively handle complaints about game flaws whether theyre poor design or user error. So yeah the guys dumb but its customer support's job to deal with dumb people.

A hearthstone player from HK spoke up about the protests after he won a tournament. Blizzards reaction was to fire both casters and ban the guy from competing for a year, as well as not pay him his prize money. Everyone has since lost their shit and there has been 0 response from Blizzard since it haplened.
---
Anyone named BOT&lt;bunch of numbers&gt; should be auto banned because obviously they are botting!!!!!@@@@ but also congrats :D
---
An overwatch player said something in support hongkong protest movement after winning a tournament.

Blizzard took his prize money back and banned him for it.

Am I not allowed to be dumb?

hey sween, unrelated to this but please look at these maps, related to 2020/21 content for eastern lands or desert, i did maps for both.

imo desert should be very expansive not just an immediate drop to sea and end in sandstorms that turn you back not sea, to fool scale.
---
3+ matches but never getting that "its a match!" screen owiee my soul
---
I was thinking more along the style of GWD bosses, DKs, even Cerb is pretty good. They're pretty well balanced. They take a decent amount of time to get to, they don't flood resources in to the game, and they have desirable drops.
---
People do use all those methods already but they're not exactly the most efficient due to the cost. 
---
There would obviously need to be worthy drops to make it do desirsblr but that would be reflected in their price.
---
I guess what I really don't want is another boss that you can teleport directly to and kill with minimal resource use that floods 1000s of resources in to the game
---
You got me excited for a second thinking there was a rc guild. I haven't played in 2 months.
---
Soul all the way

Yes
---
That's what I'm picking up on. I just went back to Duradel and am just hoping I get lucky at some point. Unfortunately I've been getting alot of Waterfiend tasks so those haven't been going so quickly.

I mean....what's the difference

Do they still have those fan art submissions? I remember i would wait for them weekly. Some of them were great.
---
There was a SirPugger video on this... You can rent PMod accounts for hours or days at a time, and use them to mute your competition.
---
have everyone install a Runelite plugin that auto-reports GE chatbots?
---
This is a great idea. Maybe a new mining game based on the new farming contracts. E.g. Mine 100 coal in mining guild, 50 addy ores in Abandoned Mine etc. Rewards can be xp or new content
---
I'm arguing that if blizzard doesn't try to censor it, it will bring awareness to the situation to get it resolved, and in turn, prevent it from spreading, in turn again saving peoples lives.
---
I'm not asking blizzard to go to china in person and stop it themselves, but don't encourage it by preventing awareness to be spread
---
F
---
I am just now learning about this. Still dont understand what it is xd
---
Yeah, I saw that. It's disappointing to say the least. I saw a PMod or two at the GE not doing shit as always and it just confirmed it for me.

God you're dumb.

Huh, the difference isn't as bad as I thought it would be at lower levels, but it does seem to scale a lot towards faster weapons at 99. Maybe that's due to the crabs having 0 defense. Thanks for the link!

Thank you for sharing.

No, each log obtained is a roll against depletion. So 1 log = one (7/8) multiple. So (7/8)^66 is just probability of gettingg 66 logs. Which isn't what the OP was.
---
I guess (7/8)^67 is the probability of getting 67 logs. (7/8)^67 * (1/8) is the probability of getting 67 logs and then failing once, which is what happened to OP
---
When it's offset by like four dragon bones from someone just training prayer. No doubt.

Get used laptop for same price and youll get mouse support and runelite client. Play on phone if you want portable version, but tablet for osrs only isnt worth it.

Miscellania teleport is closer than the fairy ring (and if you haven't done Lumby elite yet, it means you don't need to bring a dramen staff), GE teleport is useful if you're not on standard spellbook and you're bringing house tabs, falador park tele is extremely close to the music clue steps, Glory to karamja/draynor is useful for clue steps and questing

Souls are more efficient for irons, bloods to 90 is enough bloods to last for a very, very, long time. Only way you'll use them is if you do a lot of pvm with scythe.
---
You can sell half the bloods you get and easily get ~20m slay xp with barrage tasks still. (Better to not sell if you plan on post 99 stuff though). After you run out, it's more efficient to buy whatever else you need from shops than it is to craft more bloods post 90.

The biggest problem with PvP is that PKers are asking for low risk/high reward content (lure PvMers and skillers into wilderness).
---
There is only one profitable PvP content and that is bounty hunter, everything is either break even or supply loss. We see what emblem farming has done to BH. If Jagex adds anything similar, what's to say that we won't see a repeat of 76k tricking?
---
The main reason for wilderness PvP being dead is not because of power creep but because the community is about efficiencyscape. PKers whine when they can't kill players for bank loot but most of them risk salad robes. I'm exaggerating of course but most of the time PvMers risk more than PKers. I also count max magers with teams as 0% risk because for all intents and purposes, they are not going to die with so many friends to protect their ass.
---
Do they still have that service where you can get answers to quests? Like, you have two points a day and it first gives you a hint and then actually tells you?
---
Wildmudkip might be a good one, he’s pretty wholesome/nice, he may cuss some in his videos though, like a “holy shit” when he gets a drop but I can’t think of any specific instances so maybe check him out.

I’d just get 84 because 83 takes a lot of luck with those stews. And In the end could take longer to get than just getting one more lvl.

The only way to solve it would be to reset the economy (deleting clue items would be required or they'll forever be devalued and make it useless to do clues) then ban all 3rd party clients as well as update the engine and give QOL updates
---
That's not going to happen any time soon
---
Don't be a moron. I never said HK is a shithole but your comment about HK being more technically advanced than 98% of USA is utter stupidity. USA technologies are far superior to HK technologies and the ONLY way someone could agree that HK is more technologically advanced than 98% of the USA is if their head is so far up their ass that they only see one little tiny thing through that anus.
---
Give me some facts, goblin boy. I'll send you to goblin town with the quickness.
---
I would assume you'd have the nexus portal if you're going up that high, which would cover the ge tele when off standard spellbook, but its true just saving those couple extra steps for things like faly park and misc (especially w dramen staff) are useful. I just have my mounted glory the room over from the jewelry box so it's easy access, the only thing i feel the box has over all the other stuff is the hotkey teles more than anything.
---
Ahh okay that's not bad and if it's as AFK as you want keep going with. I also train WC while at work lol, I would personally reccomend Teaks, which is just south of Castle Wars, you'll pull about 60K/hr. Or check out the WC guild, it only takes 75% favor with the Hosidious house, which can be done in like an hour, and gives you a +8 to your WC level, also there's a bank very close. Which I use instead of dropping because I hate emptying my inventory, it hurts my hand. They have pretty much every tree except Teaks there. 
---
If you want a a very very AFK WC method do magic trees in the WC guild, (this takes 75 WC) it takes forever for the tree to despawn. It'll net you around 30k/hr and about 100k gp/hr if you bank. 
---
Sorry for the rant but I love training WC at work.

i've done around 200 easy clues with left click pickpocket on ham members. i assume it's the same as ahk, if you arent doing really abusive stuff you wont get banned for sure.

Oooooooh were so sorry, but a tired copy paste response tryna shift the conversation to definitions so that you can weasel around the definition to act as if what you said isn’t based in racist ideology is unfortunately not a better combo than racism and stupidity. Better luck next time :(

Fuck I just wish Jagex would ban 3rd party clients, and improve their own.

I don’t see them doing this for the first season but depending on turnout for the first season they might experiment with such ideas for the second. It’s a really good idea though.

Yeah the entire system is scuffed. Between spite voting, self voting vs potential integrity, bots, convoluted wording in questions, language barriers etc. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen people comment on something saying they wouldn’t vote for it when they completely misunderstand what it is they’re voting for. The majority of devs who brought EoC are gone, I don’t think Jagex is stupid and I somewhat believe they wouldn’t shit the bed with adding in more “integrity updates” (so don’t poll them). 
---
Regardless of what people think about that there’s no denying that the system as it stands and fucking garbage.
---
But you get smithing xp for fixing them
---
do you realize jagex doesn't need to please Mr. Winnie the pooh because they don't have market in China?, probably the investment company have no fucking idea what even runescape is, they just care about money and numbers.

Blizzard in the other hand one of their biggest market is China l, and they have done a lot of shit already because of the chinese like censoring games, diablo mobile etc.

jagex still has to show any sign of appealing to the chinese

A tick is 0.6 seconds, thus a minute being 100 ticks, one beat per tick: perfect. Or is it?
---
So for 3-ticking activities you need to perform an action every three beats. With most songs being 4/4 time (4 beats per measure (right word?)) you have to perform an action on the first beat of the first measure, on the 4th beat of the first measure, on the third beat of the second measure, and so on. That is actually a pretty difficult rhythm to hold onto. More visually, you have to perform an action on the bold ones:
---
**1** 2 3 **4** | 1 2 **3** 4 | 1 **2** 3 4 | **1** 2 3 **4** | 1 2 **3** 4 | 1 **2** 3 4 |

---
Maybe not correct but I think he's wearing eternal glory, battlestaff, frog mask, frog slippers and max cape and he's at one of the dead content in the warriors guild
---
It’s actually not when you’re considering feathers versus seeds.  
---
Higher buy limit seeds such as onion seeds have a buy limit of 600 per 4 hours, versus feather’s 13,000 every 4 hours.  
---
Every day you can buy 78,000 feathers, or 3,600 onion seeds.  
---
150M feathers will take you approximately 1924 days to purchase at the maximum buy limit - which is 5.27 years.  
---
10M onion seeds will take you 2,777 days to purchase at the maximum buy limit - which is 7.61 years.  
---
Now also consider this; feathers come in bulk packages, and are a F2P item. You can make as many accounts as you want, quest them to 7 quest points and buy an extra 78,000 feathers for each day with no real additional expense.  
---
Conversely we have seeds, a members exclusive item. If you want to get multiple accounts purchasing you now need to buy a 4-5M bond for each account, a significant expense considering in the 14 day period you’ll only have accumulated 50,400 seeds.  
---
Now the mid level to high level seeds such as nasturtium? Their buy limit is 200/4hrs (1200 a day). So any high level seeds stacks will take thrice as long. A 10M nasturtium seed stack is 21 years worth of max buy limit member items.   
---
So no, every one of his 10M seed stacks is far more impressive than basic ass feathers.
---
I voted no on some of them myself, but all of them? 
---
What did you mean by affect the meta in bad ways? What would you like to see that would affect the meta in a good way? I think if people want pvp updates they have to accept that the meta has to change. I thought most people thought the pvp meta wasn't in a good spot as is? I could be wrong though.
---
Sarachnis is actually the best wsy to get elite(1/60) and hard clues(1/40) 
---
The Meta is to duo with scythe
---
I see way more maxed players at sarachnis, if anyone at all. People kill it for the pet too
---
But really the boss is just dead

---
Exactly brotha, like you said the game even tells you
---
They've said they want to but don't know what it should be
---
The thing is...we want to encourage both. If people are in the wilderness, it’s meant to be dangerous. If you’re geared to PVM then you’re probably vulnerable. And that’s why the wild is dangerous. The rev caves would be ridiculous if there weren’t pkers galore.

Once you hit mid level the levels stop coming and it takes a whole day"s worth of playtime to gain a level.
---
The games almost over 6 years old now. There is way more than 5%(you just pulled this number out of your ass with no real backing) of the playerbase nearing endgame content.
---
I'm not bitching, I'm stating what I'd vote no to. Everyone has their opinion and this is mine. It might not be correct, maybe I'm worried more than I should be, but honestly this is why I don't give a shit about voting no to these things. Because I voice my concerns and I get shouted at and called names because I don't want to hurt the game (Because yes, I think a lot of these things would hurt the game). 
---
There's a lot of things I'd vote YES to, surprisingly! I'm sure you didn't expect that one! New PvP areas/minigames (LMS was a fantastic choice, and we need more of it). A wilderness expansion/revamp, or hell, add a second PvP zone elsewhere on the map. New spec weapons, ancient warrior equipment, go wild! But don't get pissed off at me when I say no to things that I feel would actively damage the game.

Don't look at the overall exp left to 99, just make daily/weekly goals for yourself to meet.

Today i was curious also, where is the lvl3scape. Because i was in his clan for like +1year i think. At the time i was a skiller (he had skiller clan). So, today i joined his cc and typed: So, this cc is dead? Because there was like only 4 people on the cc. And Rank on that cc Said that he passed away. And the rank didn't respond anything else. I'am kinda in shock now.. Also noticed that his Youtube is deleted.

If you took the time to actually read the comment I said he shouldn’t download it until he is officially ready how can you tell a new person to download runelite be overwhelmed with loads of features and then expect to be able to play the game? Open your eyes you fool I told op the original link to use when he or she is ready your comment is pointless but thanks for the input you melt.
---
AGS that bitch
---
Okay, I just went back through and reread all the comments. You got given maybe 2 or 3 reasons why its bad for the economy. And every single reason for why you claim it would be a good idea was proven wrong very convincingly with actual logic. 
---
The thing is that you refuse to believe what anybody is telling you and think that people are downvoting you out of spite because they're emotional and butthurt that they've never had a rare. I can promise you that's not the reason. Nobody gives a fuck. 
---
The reason you're getting downvoted is because you're being presented with actual logical discourse and reasoning for why your ideas don't make sense. And instead of trying to understand what people are telling you, you're basically sticking your fingers in your ears going "lalalalala I cant hear you I know I'm right rares are a good idea". 
---
And even if you were right, its already been voted on and the answer was no. On top of that, mods have said in the past that they also don't like the idea of ultra rare items like party hats in osrs and they also do not want a repeat of what happened with rs3. 
---
So you can think you're right and want them all you want, but the fact remains that it is never going to happen and nobody else really cares.
---

---
You realise a game is meant to be played for fun and there isnt just 1 right way to play?

That would be cool and all but while that plugin is reporting one bot three new bots are born

The sooner, the better because everything from F2P is easier and more accessible in members. But it's also good to have at least somewhat of a plan so you don't feel completely overwhelmed by all of the new content! Read about some quests and rewards, the new skills you'll be able to do.. set some tentative goals of things you want to accomplish when you get there.
---
Seers at Kandarin with hard diary is close to like 15 marks per hour I think. You should have more than enough marks by the time you get to like 75 agility.
---
That's fine, nobody is forcing you to play. You are 100% allowed to have the opinion that all of those things are necessary, but they aren't. Do I wish we had some of those features on the regular client? Yes. Do I hope that Jagex eventually adds them in? Yes. Is the game less fun without them? No. Does it impede my ability to do the things that I want to in the game? No. 
---
The game functions and plays just fine without them. Like I said, if being forced to play the game the same way that most people already do is a dealbreaker for you, then that's pretty sad in my opinion.
---
Since when is the objective of OSRS to have all the same features and plug ins as every other game out there? I thought people played OSRS because its, ya know, old school and reminds people of the game they knew and loved as a kid, regardless of if it has all the bells and whistles of other current games or not. 
---
That's like saying that the graphics are shitty compared to other games. Well, yeah, but that's sort of the point. This is how it was back in the day. But for some reason playing on the same client as back in the day is unacceptable and gets people butthurt to no end.
---
The DPS calc doesnt account for dps lost to overhitting which is way more punishing with slower weapons, you can look at my previous comment above for more of an explanation on that.
---
Im fine with it being a distance that's unviable for mains, but even corp is far better to just duo / dolo or trio the boss and just one trip spec it. Far more kills per hour then doing the ironman method.
---
not opposing is not the same thing as supporting. I believe we called the people not supporting but not opposing Hitler just "German Citizens".
---
The entire country took a major hit after the war, but people that didn't oppose hitler (mostly out of fear) def weren't lumped in with actual nazis.
---
its literally subjective, to a non-sweaty who wants to be able to afk moneymake, its the best method in the game
---
“Blood RC isn’t a great moneymaker” by itself is opinion. Once he gave a valid comparison to the money per hour of other sources however, it became a valid fact. On the other hand, I find it difficult to claim “pvm isn’t fun” as anything aside from an opinion
---
Shut up. You have no idea how to run a business. They’re selling a product not running an activism campaign.
---
Google what the word enable means. 
---
If you do not support the oppressed you enable the oppressor. Period. Enabling is no different that support. PERIOD.
---
There's three ways this ends:
---
\- Government kills all the protestors (or at least as many as they can), world sanctions, WW3.
---
\- World sides with rebels, China boycotts foreign investments, global economy collapses, WW3.
---
\- The citizens give up a fight they literally can't win, world goes back to normal. No WW3.

Oh, we know, but if we banned it on everyone's PC we wouldn't get any time in either.

do i need royal trouble for miscellenia or is it optional or does it affect the loot

People are surprised because lots of them are leaving all at once, which doesn’t normally happen, at least not recently.

Yeh totally understandable and I figured it was something this basic in design that was limiting you. 
---
Is it possible for their to be an option where the override volumes only take effect when the ingame volume is turned on?
---
Sell prims and pegs. Buy rigour. Use d boots and d'hide boots while making back money at vork. Even at cox rigour makes a bigger difference than having the extra str/range accuracy from the boot upgrades.
---
Sorry I've missed something, what's the joke here?

How the fuck you gonna call hk a shit hole? What shit hole country were you educated in?

No need to apologise. I was interested to hear your side of things. Just keep achieving those awesome things as long as it makes you happy :)
---
90-99 is like 200 hours of bloods or 170 hours of souls (160 if doing abyss). You'll make 355k runes if you do bloods w/ diary, or 260k runes if you do souls.
---
355k bloods x 320 per blood = 113m
---
260k souls x 145 per soul = 38m
---
Making bloods is 30 hours slower but profits 75m more than souls, so if you choose to do bloods you're getting paid 2.5m/hr for those extra 30 hours.
---
You should stake that way you have a reason not to lose even if its just 10k
---
Considering shes been around since 2003 I would say so.
---
Lets hope I get lucky on the next task.
---
cope? with what? you sound schizo lmfao
---
Ah. A deontologist. Can't say I relate, as I happen to think context is incredibly important.
---
The right thing to do is whatever minimizes suffering. In practice, however, it's difficult or impossible to know exactly what actions will do so, and as a result we must use heuristics to decide how to actually do things. 
---
One of the most powerful heuristics available to us is empathy, and I happen to empathize with people who feel trapped, who don't know when everything went so wrong, whose decisions were minor or meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and whose personal rebellion from their wretched state would be rapidly silenced. 
---
In the end, it is because Sophie Scholl was remarkable that we remember her and the rest of the White Rose. If she had not been remarkable, if everyone had risen to her standard, there would be nothing to remember her for. To condemn everyone who wasn't like her is to condemn the human race. I have seen too much good of humanity to do so.
---
FFXIV?
---
That's not how maths work
---
The point is you should be doing souls when you can instead of bloods because the time saved from doing only bloods brings in significantly more money doing pvm.
---
Yeh now actually address what i asked for. You’ve given me half a story.
---
ok, so the fact that you're not actively fighting against all forms of terrorism means that you are in the wrong and should be considered part of said terrorist organizations?
---
There are definitely levels of right and wrong.

ya like staking 10k is fine but i dont wanna lose the cash i have on osrs cause ill have to tranfer more from rs3 lol.
---
i literally don't even know what your point is
---
no where am i trying to dispute that there aren't better methods out there. All i said is that blood rc is great (IN MY OPINION)
---
you are arguing for the sake of arguing and its pointless lmao, i dont think we even disagree on anything
---
Except he's claiming it makes bank. It just doesn't. If he said something like "I find blood runes more chill" then sure. Nothing wrong with that.
---
i indeed remember the whole 27 characters
---
The sad part is that your osrs membership also gives you an rs3 membership, if we’re sacrificing anything let us sacrifice that
---
Rune drags are just as afk and 3 times more money per hour.
---
Where's your CC tab? 🤔
---
Ty for the ELI5.
---
&gt;If you want to go by facts then the best gp/hour is getting a job and buying bonds
---
Technically yeah. But it's arguably the worst option for the average person.
---
Barrows is low level pvm and kq makes the same gp/hr. ToB is new content. The next raid will undoubtedly be in the desert unless it's in an entirely new area, which I doubt.
---
So there will be an expansion to the desert to suit it's needs like you want and deserve. If they put nightmare there it would not fit as well, and wouldn't be the kinda big scale update to the desert. I imagine RF2020 is going to be desert expansion with quest line and raids 3
---
I got more hilts tho, i should be hilter
---
fools closed a couple months ago
---
No. There are a lot of max combat accounts hanging around in pvp worlds.
---
I dont do PVM, so im gonna do bloods because I prefer afk money over xp
---
Has nothing to do with the graphics lol, dude thats a complete strawman.
---
this isn't about the game, its about the client and UX. How are ground items not mandatory? I'm so baffled how that doesnt impede you on the official client.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah, Demonic Gorillas technically only require 69 slayer but are even more mechanically demanding and difficult than basilisks, or even something like Kurasks.
---
Not a fan of quests.
---

&gt; Absolute best long-term is Lavas until 82
---
Aren't steams like 5% less xp and 500k/hr profit?
---
You need to take a chill pill and stop caring how others play this game. Your assumptions are also baseless. You must be a miserable human being.
---
Except most devs don't use Java any more they use RuneScript, so unless you're an engine dev it's completely useless for anything later in your career.
---
What makes you think he's any of that?

Full clue hunter garb and iron warhammer

And smashed glass from all the vials

Okay, who has the bread? We need to do that for 3 days.
---
Raids 1/2 SOTE
---
One of the most corrupt on earth sadly.
---
Chinese fucking over Blizzard. Chinese fucking over Jagex. The fuck am I supposed to play now?
---
If that's a big deal then this might not be the right kind of game for you.
---
It's how it's meant to be. You only repair it if it's your last deposit before having to empty. If everyone does that, then no one has to repair each invent.
---
Okay how about this.  
---
one of several pieces of content that is severely underutilized and often overlooked and forgotten
---
Until you get it down and then you dont need the songs anymore
---
I'm okay with your opinion. The only thing I'm commenting about is how you're treating others' opinions as factually wrong. When in fact, they just have a different opinion as you.
---
Sounds like you get wrecked in PvP lol
---
And you're sitting home and enabling them. Period.
---
Commenting on reddit is a negligible achievement; don’t know why you even did it
---
thats not a runecrafting guild chief maybe learn
---
I really hope you didn't.  That's legitimately evil

Can you make a tall version of each so I can use as a phone background? =)
---
yes, automatic perm ban if you use the "h and k" word.
---
Roughly 275 hours from 77 if you switch to souls at 90.
---
As someone who is not much of a pker, I love the wilderness as it is now.
---
It adds so much depth to the game. I have the most real interactions with people in the wilderness. My heart pounds more trying to escape a pker with a bunch of risk than doing anything else in game. I love attempting to pk myself occasionally (even though I'm miserable at it).
---
I wish people could just chill out sometimes. Way too much vitriol thrown between PVPers and PVMers when we're all just runescapers.
---
Actually, I protest frequently. 
---
The moment we start gassing people in chambers though, I’ll see you on the front lines! Surely right?
---
Lol no, I just want to see a bit of variety, PVP is dying out because of how little variety it is, everyone is a meta account, I've even got a meta account for myself, but unluckily I didn't make it in time before PVP died out.
---
I’m not going to disagree with what you’re saying but when you’ve been exclusively using an archaic and niche code for years when and where it comes up will on hinder your chances when competing with others.
---
Rune drags, gargoyles
---
i dont think it will be OP.
---
melee dps pales in comparison to range in most bossing pages.
---
for casual slay the meta is already zero dmg via afk camping overhead prayers. buffing sustain should not be a big deal.
---
i dont see why tying it to fury is fair. you dont have to sacrifice anything to use overheads to sustain or drink ppots. itd make the necklace very low value. why use a fury with healing over torture+ppots? you'd never do that tbh. you might throw it on an alt for tanking gwd, but outside that?
---
&gt;What if we added a negative defensive bonus to the upgraded Torture? Think the Berserker Necklace - which has -20 in all defensive stats. Something along these lines which would keep the fury even more relevant when you want defensive stats (tanking GWD).
---
there is already a gigantic difference between fury/sring/bgloves and tort/berserker ring/feros no?
---
&gt;The SGS is used
---
sgs has very little practical use. Hell, a lot of inferno setups dont even bring it anymore, nobody uses it at cerb or demonics really anymore. i really dont think the healing in pvm will end up mattering. like, not at all.
---
I gave you the silver award for finishing second in this conversation, enjoy!
---
I understand there’s a lot of work, but I thought that most had already been done because I saw streamers playing pseudo group Ironman. My mistake.
---
They need to have no pet too
---
Runeing runes
---
We already have dbaxe for str. Atk isn't needed.
---
I like the idea for the imbued heart, however rather than divine, battlemage effect would probably be less OP.
---
I agree that range isn't needed, unless it's accompanied by a BP nerf.
---
Skillers are playing an rts except the only thing you can control is a single villager
---
No I meant Bossing, like you do a simple boss with 2 accounts etc.
---
I repair when it's the last inventory.
---
If everyone does it like that, no one has to repair much
---
Have one. Doesn’t satisfy me. I’m hard to please
---
Sarachnis is easy on a level 100 with like 5m gear

---
This isn't 2007.
---
Ahh, gassing bad, drone strikes good? Guess the crafty government can escape your resentment as long as they don't go the gas chamber method, but a more modern solution is fine. You're lucky they're not executing people for protesting then, unlike in nazi germany where you would labeled a traitor and thrown into the same gas chamber.
---
I'm even scummier.
---
Sometimes when nobody fixes it (rare) and my hoppers full...
---
I hop 😂
---
Imagine actually walking on a fucking crazy land-bridge like this? Id be terrified
---
It does not.
---
HAHAHA it was a big brain move. 
---
I wasn’t sure about how many confirmations screen there were (haven’t been to duel arena in like 10~ years. I thought there would be another one accept screen but there wasn’t. 
---
The moment I realized that, and noticed I could not attack or do anything, I immediately xlogged and checked a few days later to be sure.. and everything was gone 😂 havent been online since
---
Oh no it totally happened, I have a more detailed post in my history but to try to recall off the top of my head:
---
Basically I had a lot of gp like a million at least or just under I was going to tip him. And I got sick of waiting and said fuck it. And I made it. And got distracted by something. Was eventually logged out for inactivity. When I came back I had PM's from him like "where are you" and everything. But he blocked me I think because I added him to reply of course but he's never online. If I could I'd apologize and give him the tip for sure.
---
Edit:
---
Original story
---
I was doing underground pass with 40 agility and so annoyed. Had gone through the last of my agility potions and at desperation asked someone in the clan chat to trek through the pass to deliver me agility potions 2 steps from the temple.
---
This dude said he was on his way, I had just under 1m gp on me and fully iintended to give him all of it. Well I get wreckless and went for it and despite an hour+ of failure I made it. I freaked out and got the staff and got the fuck out. I was so elated I forgot about this courier dodging blades to give me free stuff.
---
So I beat the quest. And then went to make food. Got logged out of runelite. Log back in and I see I missed PM's from this guy "hopping worlds now" "where are you" "I'm here" "where are you in here" "I've checked the entire top and bottom I'm sorry I can't find you".
---
He was logged out. Ive waited days for him to login so I could pm him and apologize and give him the money. But I guess he's filtered or blocked me. That was the one time I used that service, I made a guy go through shits Creek for me. He in his own kindness was willing to do it for free to help me out. And I utterly fucked him over. And that's my story of the free delivery clan chat.
---
Probably bought it
---
You easily make money on Cerberus per kill without uniques. 20x dragon bones etc pays for an invent in a drop.
---
True — in all of my protest attendances and arrests NONE of them have ever been anti war protests! Maybe I should go all 2nd amendment on them and fly over to the Middle East and shoot at the drones or something!
---
Does anyone know of a Fight Cave cheat sheet of sorts that I can have up on my second my monitor when I attempt the Fight Caves tonight?
---
Yeah I use that when I’m tired and want to go to bed on slayer tasks haha thanks
---
Master quest and 60 slayer requirement. That's what said it.
---
nah the cannon special attack shot two hits at once. as far as quest requirements, the cannon had pretty low reqs. like 60qp or something and i think the balista is higher
---
Clearly me grinding to nearly 1750 in 20 months is counter to that. Maybe this isn’t the right decade for you lmao
---
RuneScape merch store, think it's sold out again though
---
Remove posts about removing posts about the duel arena clue scroll step.
---
It's time.
---
Y
---
I'm sure the dead appreciate your protesting.
---
never heard any of those songs before is 25% any good? thanks
---
If you have an anti bot on 1000 people, then are they really much of a challenge?  Zero effort is met with zero-effort
---
take kourend out, put in a mounted xeric's talisman instead.
---
I wanted to use trio scythes, but scythe sucks
---
Demonics profit a ridiculous amount while being barely harder. You can mitigate all of their damage due to prayers. It's a count to 3 mob. This mob has unavoidable damage, and requires prayer while doing that.
---
All while being lower req and having an absolute trash tier drop table with only a single unique that when killed off task is absurdly rare.
---
Yeh demonics looking so much better designed than these. Easier longer trips, better profit, endlessly killable off task if desired without hurting your rates.
---
I'll never understand why people hate this step so much. Is it just because it makes clues last a few minutes longer, ruining your efficiency? There's the argument that it's the only clue that requires another player, but so what? That's what makes clues fun, they're a unique experience that have you doing things and going to places you normally wouldn't. I'd be pretty bummed if they remove the clue because loudmouths on Reddit don't want to interact with other players and want to be able to do Hard clues in less than 5 minutes.
---
I don't think "all" gamers are overweight. You can't classify that many people into a single category. That's like saying all Asian people are good at math. The majority of people I know that play games aren't overweight at all.
---
Thanks for the back up lol. Die may have been too strong of a word but there’s now way it’d have no impact.
---
&gt; So why wasn't I logged by the 20 minute timer?
---
the 15-20 minute timer is for auto retaliate. you stop auto retaliating at 15-20 minutes, then you typically die. however, normal nmz you dont take much dmg so you might die very slowly.
---
you can test this by splashing. youll 6 hour while splashing after gaining only 20 minutes of splashing experience if you just click a goblin, then afk. thats assuming ofc nobody pjs the goblin afterwards.
---
6 hours is the only time you get hard logged out of combat.
---
Sorry about that. You okay now?
---

---
What are the reqs for bandos again? What slayer level is zammy?
---
aint no hope when you're smokin dope
---
This ain't new
---
You keep login for 6 hours when your in combat you just stop attacking back
---
Probably as much as they appreciate your sitting at home. 
---
I trust you’re competent enough to be able to find out what all protests have started/changed throughout history, so I won’t drop a let me google that for you link. :)
---
You seem very upset. Who killed you?
---
Sorry I don't have time to debate nuances and your walls of text.
---
yeah fun orb or die
---
&gt;Looking at polling charter to see what and how we poll 
---
I really hope this isn't changed solely to benefit PvP polls. Looking at the polling system still isn't going to fix the problems PvP and specifically the Wilderness have, and giving PvP special attention in regards to polling would be *horrendous*.
---
I will freakin be there. I always try to show up to redditor/cc thrown 99 parties
---
T
---
How did the communist turn all the way to the other side?
---
Not even close my dude.
---
I'd say 500 tops.
---
Which won't even be noticeable because that's a fraction of the regular daily game time expirations anyway
---
not a tankie, definitely not pro state capitalism.
---
china isn't fascist either, they're authoritative but to assume fascism is a bit out of character
---
Yeah! Shit all over them!
---
Wow great to know, thank you
---
I've heard about that, I asked because of that new crystal bow that shows on ge tracker and runelite for aprox. that value, is it a different version?
---
100% not. Im pretty sure even Sparc Mac has gotten more than that in 1 session.
---
zulrah, raids, slayer
---
A friend told me about Settled, so I watched all of Swampletics a couple weeks ago, and started playing for the first time in years 2 days ago
---
As someone who plays wow as well, can tell you that player numbers haven’t changed.
---
Happened to me too. Got another one 3K kills later. 
---
Flex with me
---
Buy a tier 10 off the ge. This will give you roughly 2.5x the points you need.
---
Buy 1 rune pouch and use the rest of the points to buy other stuff to sell on the ge. You'll end up only paying about 500k in the end
---
My older cousin got me into the game in late 2008/early 2009. So about a year after you started. But I feel that once we conquer that glorious hurdle of getting just one 99, the world will be at our mercy.
---
imagine not understanding class conflict and then using that as justification for attributing your individual failures onto a whole demographic of people.
---
also you're much more likely to find me on /r/cumtown, I haven't listened to CTH in well over a year
---
415b + inventory stuff isn't even close?!?!
---
Sorry about the hate in this thread.   
---
  
---
Right now you are getting 34.4 KPH. Using rune knives would cost 200k / hr (up from about 20k/hr using broad botls) and net you about 25% faster kills. The extra at least 8 kills per hour equates to 240k gp with a 1/800 chance of a 24m drop.  
---
Using ranged potions costs only 9k an hour and should also net a few extra kph, for net profit. Using hawk eye costs about 66k / hr for you and offers another few extra kph. You would really benefit from getting to around 60 prayer to get more out of your p pots.  
---
Take away: you have to spend money to make money, and broad bolts aren't cutting it. At the very least you should be using ranging potions as they are incredibly cheap.
---
weird ass looking dds
---
4500kc no mutagen btw
---
For group ironman mode, will leeching raids be allowed? It would make sense to see raiding parties only exclusive to your group. Plus it would make the achievement of first to complete, or first to "X" item, much more meaningful.
---
Correct. 
---
I know of people who have maxed tokens. Just because they don’t go flaunting it everywhere doesn’t mean that there isn’t wealthier people.
---
I tried to edit the quick guide for MEP2 puzzle once. There's a specific mirror in it that's preplaced, and a buddy of mine got stuck not knowing it was already there. He thought he had a full inv looting one of the chests and missed a mirror. After an hour of completely redoing every single puzzle, he asked me wtf he could've done wrong.
---
Only the full guide mentioned that the mirror was preplaced, so I decided to put it in the quick guide that "this mirror is preplaced".
---
Someone actually took the time to edit it back out. You're fucking right on the maxed sweaty neets there.
---
How would you buy blue dragonhide?
---
You'd be giving up crafting xp in any case.
---
Seems a bit like a meme valve reference: never releasing a third game.
---
sparc had like 200m tokens + the rest of his bank obv before losing most of them if im not mistaken? Havent seen more than that, atleast its not publicly available, might be some runescape trillionaire somewhere who isnt flashing his wealth :D
---
yeah you should just give up and toss me one of those elys
---
Probably so he can just use tea and saw instead of spices and saw.
---
Since Jagex is owned by a Chinese company, can players get banned for supporting Hong Kong or criticizing the Chinese government?
---
Maybe they could add some sort of mechanic to it? Like, toggle whether you want to roll for the pet or for drops, and you can only choose one or the other. Pet hunters would have no effect on the economy.
---
How did the morytania expansion play a role in its rise? Seems very fishy
---
Using tier 1s is a terrible idea. You need 24 tier 1 emblems costing about 1.7m
---
Instead buy a tier 10 emblem for 2.5m, buy your rune pouch and spend the rest of the points buying stuff to sell on the ge. Total cost for the pouch ends up being around 500k
---
If I run into naked people while pking and they ask why I'm attacking them, I usually tell them it's a cavity search. So if you come unarmed to a place were people kill you and steal your belongings get ready to spread your cheeks. The wilderness is about SURVIVAL not EFFICIENCY.
---
I just say fuck it, get a tissue, clench my loofa, and let her RRRRRIIIIIPPPPPP. (It usually hurts so fucking bad).
---
Turnover is natural but the rate of it is worrying some people. As you stated, people with jobs know how turnover works. That being said, in my own company, it was **not** a coincidence we suddenly had the most turnover in years when the company announced we were moving across town and downsizing our office space. Many long term employees didn't like the cheapness of the move, so they left. Yes turnover is real, but stages in a company can certainly effect it. When you have several long term and respected employees leave, to the outside of course it looks bad. Turnover is one thing but turnover is damaging if your senior and trained staff leave. New hires mean less experience, more training, inefficiency. You want some turnover but you don't want some of your best staff leaving all at once.
---
You can buy tier 10 emblems off the ge now too, you end up saving money over using tier 1s
---
I'd encourage you to step up right after the 99 guy.  Why be selfish, ya know
---
This vape is the shit
---
Seriously can I have like 250m lol
---
Slayer 90 and you are asking for ways to make money? :D
---
I expect to see more 99rc posts in the new RC guild.
---
If you ever get an email from "jagex", do not click any links. go to the main website directly from your browser and log into your account that way. From there you can check for any changes
---
I like the way path of exile does it. Depending on how many tasks you complete you can earn cosmetic reskins of items for your main account
---
What's sparc at now I don't really follow him. When did he lose big (did he chuck a bunch or what).
---
