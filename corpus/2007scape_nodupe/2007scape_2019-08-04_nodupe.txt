This is true but i see alot of solos and duos pking at the altar and i personally would run if i saw a group of 4 or 5 and i was solo or duoing. Just my 2 cents. A protection CC would actually be a cool thing to see.

Correct. There aren't really any quest reqs outside of having Dragon Slayer started. You don't really have to have 1 atk/str/mag either, I just did it for fun. How you get the 32 qps for DS is entirely up to you.

Might take a look man! Decent exp at mid levels then looking at that. I use rl as well (who dont these days?)  I actually got the tele book by myself without runlite or help and it took me like 3 fucking days. What a moron hahaha
---
Sounds good, its been a while. Probably messed it up, or I just forgot to do it again with subsequent 99s and thought it initially didn't work.
---
Why is there a 3 day countdown? Do people really wait that long at the venue or am I crazy?
---
Thanks for the quick response but there is no tree to chop, it's a fixed location right?

Since the one that actually created the account is the only owner of the account yup they can always recover it. Aka never buy accounts not only because it is against the rules but because the account is never actually yours. You are just renting it until the owner decides to recover it back

A literal Barrel Chested Cannon.
---

---
A Cannon strapped to your characters chest takes the chest slot, can fire every 20-30s during combat, does the max hit of a cannonball and in multi-combat pieres through enemies to hit up to 3 mobs with diminishing damage.
---
Your character shouts "Yarrr!" everytime it fires.
---
Wearing an eyepatch item at the same time increases the firing time to every 10-15s.
---
Seems like a good and logical idea!

He can’t. He’s a BTW
---
Real question is: why it needs to be changed?
---
selling it in an alt is always an option
---
If you mean the daily ones from zaff then as long as the air orb+ the nat is under 2300 gp total than yes you will profit from crafting them. Otherwise no you lose from buying everything from the g.e.
---
If that's from the RDT, then it's not that bad. Considering its a 1/8k from any monster you kill on that drop table. But i'm at 3k vorkath kc with 2 necklaces... :/
---
What? No why change something like this. It's perfectly fine as is
---
Technically you can wear them. Whenever you stop running, just switch to the graceful cape so you get that 30%.
---
*angry btw noises*

If I set it up for a herb run it only gives me 3 plots in the route.

1/1000 chance. It looks like four rolls, but the first position doesn't matter (where assuming you just want them all to be in the same position). So we have three rolls after selecting the first. 10^3 = 1000.

Would you consider selling this?

I hate when they try to 'improve' little graphical things. It always leads to the 'don't fix what isn't broken' vs 'it's just one little change don't whine' argument. So fucking stupid. I honestly think Jagex hates their old school player base and resents having to maintain lower graphical standards.

It’s is not the best. I haven’t worn full graceful in so long doing so many different activities

The goal of the skill is to act as a more task/minigame oriented skill rather than as a Gathering/Production/Combat skill. In some ways it could resemble minigames and D&amp;D's because of this.

**Route Data:** There's "Can Access?" and "Skip?".
---
**"CA"** \- 90% of them are just TRUE, a few look at the quest, achievements, and farming level. I don't think you mean this column.
---
**"Skip?"** \- Looks at the "Active List", where you selected your seeds to see if you need that plot, based on your seed choice, or skip it. For instance, "Draynor Village, NW" looks at "Allotments", "Flowers", and "Herbs" in the active list. If **any** of them has a seed chosen, then it's marked false (as in don't skip). For Draynor Village, NW:
---
\`=AND( // Returns TRUE if ALL are true, else FALSE
---
OR('1. Questionnaire'!$B$6="Level too low :(",'1. Questionnaire'!$B$6="Skip"), // Returns TRUE if ANY are true, else FALSE
---
OR('1. Questionnaire'!$B$7="Level too low :(",'1. Questionnaire'!$B$7="Skip"),
---
OR('1. Questionnaire'!$B$8="Level too low :(",'1. Questionnaire'!$B$8="Skip")
---
)\`
---
It checks Allotments, Flowers, and Herbs in the "Active List". If **all 3 cells** are "Skip" or "Level too low :(" it marks FALSE, else, it's TRUE.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**As far as the herb run:** "Skip" looks at the "Active List", the "Route Dropdown", what populates your location choices, looks at the "Usable" columns in "Route Data". The "Usable" columns works like "Skip" - looks at your selected seeds. Most things look at what you've selected in your first sheet.

After creation, change to name you want

That won't fix it either. The name change will reserve the name for 35 (?) days or something to the account that changed the name. Either way, I'm hoping to avoid having to rename my already established accounts just to name this new account.

Personally, I hope we do see more stuff like that. Aside from the Gauntlet stuff, it was a nice addition. Sure the graphics could do with improvements, but I don't that should discourage them from doing secret updates like that. It is important that we get to vote on impactful things, but knowing everything about updates before they release can take away some of the fun. And while Quests do provide a lot more unknown than other types of updates, SotE wouldn't have been as good of an update if it did lack things like the Rabbit with the Chalice, Dragonstone Armor, or whatever those Bells do.

I hope so. Runescape banter wouldn't be the same without the youngins. Ch00b.

Not sure I'd want Jagex to spend time making hundreds of new graceful items.

**"Tree Profit Type":** Added a "None" option. It shows as:
---
     IF($G$4="None",VLOOKUP(F11,{'Crop Data'!C$3:C,'Crop Data'!D$3:D},2,FALSE)*-1, 
---
Looks up the sapling name (**F11**) in the **'Crop Data'** sheet in the **C** column and gets the corresponding seed value, **D** column (2 = 2nd options in the {array} and FALSE is means the data is "not sorted" ) then takes the number and makes is a negative (the total loss value). Doesn't factor in the 200 gold to have it removed; should it?
---
**E1:** The shopping list was all screwy lol It wasn't counting the plots, which idk why I didn't use those. Good catch! I fixed it. Seaweed &amp; Hardwood are updated.
---
    =IF($B3="","", //If the neighboring left cell is blank, make this one blank
---
    //If the seed's plot type if found, count the "usable" plots, add them all up!
---
    //Does this 3 times, one for each patch #.
---
    SUMIF('Route Data'!$A$3:$A,"="&amp;VLOOKUP(B3,{'1. Questionnaire'!$B$6:$B$20,'1. Questionnaire'!$A$6:$A$20},2,FALSE),'Route Data'!C$3:C)+
---
    SUMIF('Route Data'!$D$3:$D,"="&amp;VLOOKUP(B3,{'1. Questionnaire'!$B$6:$B$20,'1. Questionnaire'!$A$6:$A$20},2,FALSE),'Route Data'!F$3:F)+
---
    SUMIF('Route Data'!$G$3:$G,"="&amp;VLOOKUP(B3,{'1. Questionnaire'!$B$6:$B$20,'1. Questionnaire'!$A$6:$A$20},2,FALSE),'Route Data'!I$3:I)) 
---
**E2:** It was just 1 per plot, yes. I changed Allotments &amp; flowers to 3 per plot. "Usable" is now "Seeds". I don't have the qty for each type, I usually just grab 500 of each seed. I'll mark them next time I do a run and update!
---
**E4:** I haven't added 5 things, Celastrus is one of those. Check out the "Notes" tab, I try to keep that updated so I know what I need to get back to :P
---
Thanks for the help!

Woah I think I just saw dboots correctly for the first time. For some reason I always saw them as being upside down.
---
That has nothing to do with QA Testing. They'd make sure the item works properly, and it does; it is exactly as it was polled. Once it passes a poll, they deliver what we voted on, unless they find an issue like Superior Bones at original rates from Rune and Addy Dragons. So it would be the fault of the community for voting for the item in the proposed state or the CMs for offering it without revision.
---
Anyway, I expect we'll see something polled for it soon. I'd say 50 or 100 Chargers per Shard would be fine. Also, make the Elven Signet work with it; you'd still never use it over Berserker Ring, but it is so strange to intentionally exclude the Blade and only that... It might also be worth upping the charges per shard for the Armor and Tools; especially the Seed Weapons since 200gp per Crystal Bow shot is worse than the old costs.
---
Idk man I'm just hoping for a hot fix soon, we deduced that it was because I talked to the swamp lady first instead of tree guy

I mean it was always going to be way way below a rapier. The same weapon with different attack style, with a running cost of sorts?

Yeah its supposed to be an intermediary between whip and rapier for PvM bursts, but I do agree 25 per one shard is far too low.

In terms of maxing, UIM is definitely more impressive than HCIM. In terms of PVM achievements they're more equal. You have less inventory for supplies/gear vs have to have 2 internet connections and safe up and screw over your team in ToB.

Pepsi graceful
---
Sure it doesn't need to be. But it was pitched to be the next end game PvM content to hold interest until raids 3, not some new slayer boss. Slayer bosses like hydra are drastically more gp/hr. Gauntlet is even less gp/hr than sire and Cerberus at the moment, who aren't even end game PvM bosses. That's absurd. If something is end game content, it can't just be 1-2m gp/hr, otherwise the content is dead for the very group it targeted for one thing. Fixing the blade for an actual use in the meta, underneath a scythe, was absolutely the intention of the blade and it has failed. The jmods themselves intended this to be a weapon you use in TOB, but as it turns out it's less hours camping a bloody abyssal whip for the 500+ kc it would take to acquire both a rapier and scythe to replace the blade of saeldor.
---
what even is this post

It’s my belief that this is the same reason people were angry about MEP2 handholds being made easier. It turned like a 15 minute grind into a 10 minute grind, but to these people it’s either a slippery slope or it devalues their accomplishment
---
They have 'small man syndrome' or something similar. Killing another player gives them a mad rush of adrenaline because they never win or accomplish anything in every other area of their life. They don't like challenge because people who like challenge are typically winners and pk clans are far from winners. Even in the game they have to ensure there is no chance of losing so they walk around in groups, hunting defenseless players because that imposes next to no risk on them and gives them their 'high' of victory almost guaranteed.
---
Source: Used to be in KoS, they never talked about good pk strategies or gear setups or anything strategic about the whole point of having a pk clan. It was just a chatroom, to meet up with other players in the clan and go chase down people in deep wildy, focusing on revs for easy loot. I lasted like 2 weeks lol. Pk clans will make you hate pking unless you're also an insecure loser.
---
This would just make it so you always carry that talisman with you and take it on and off whenever needed

I don't like the idea of permanently using an inventory space for this, it would probably be used 99% of the time

It's on the front page somewhere a guy is making it for the PC. Looks awesome 🦀🦀
---
Have you every played this game because something in it is fun to you? If the content is fun to someone it's not dead content. That's it
---
0/10, not enough raving happening here RN
---
Had it before. Wasn't a bad idea but it caused for a lot of manipulation. They would have to prevent people from entering the wild with leant items.

That's gotta be the biggest mindgame around though right?

I'm posting it to raise awareness in hopes of it getting patched? imagine sitting on reddit 24/7 that u know ive reposted this only 4 times l0l
---
I actually program for a living, I don't know what their backend looks like to gauge if this is possible or not.
---
But I imagine it’s super rare still right? I know the grapier/grazier (can’t remember the name) drops, but I’d imagine that’s super rare 
---
Either way good luck with drops!!
---
It's exchanging the money for that gold from other players. So it isn't disproportionate. Your argument would be against the allowance of RWT as that's what RWT is, the exchanging of two currencies. Which is a perfectly fine argument. I take issue with people throwing it in with MTX though, which is a different issue.
---
If you wanted to argue against RWT though (which you'd have to, as Jagex is only doing this because of gold selling websites, because it's an RWT issue, not an MTX issue), I'd have to ask what the alternative solution would be. As people can just buy gold from gold sellers anyways, and Jagex made this change to mitigate them. So they'd need an alternative way to prevent people from performing RWT without their sanction to even consider not having bonds in their game.
---
WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFO
---
I agree with what you're saying and I'm no way defending putting someone else down for having a "lesser account" but just because someone has a better account doesn't mean they have to dedicate more free time to the game than someone else. The game has been out for 6 years. If you played one to two hours a day since release you COULD be 99 everything by now even playing casually.
---
im just saying what ive seen from playing in bracket.

I agree, they probably could pull it off if they can keep weapons/armor off of Entrana.
---
I think it's a good idea as long as it had restrictions on where you could use them. People already lend gear to others they know, why not make it safer and players could even make a bit of gp off it as well? I can see the worry Jagex might have for example lending a Twisted Bow to someone so they can do content easier might not sit well with them or the community but there are always work arounds. It should be polled for sure.
---
Let me guess, it's $11?
---
Good luck! There’s a few mobs who drop champ scrolls fast. Can’t remember which but I saw it on a vid. Was either like a goblin or some weird low level npc. 
---
Also I have a champ scroll. But is it needed for anything other than music cape? I thought the reward was just a banner
---
&gt;because it's an RWT issue, not an MTX issue
---
actually it's both. that's all I ever wanted you to understand.

Didn't this cause alot of BiS items to crash in rs2? It'd be convenient but idk if I'd want my bank value to drop 25% for it.

I might be wrong tho

I dont get it?

can't hurt but its mainly for prayer bonus

I'm amazed by your ignorance. Why drag autism through the mud? Cunt.

The other guy probably went to the bathroom beforehand and didn't eat anything all day.
---
It isn't MTX though as the MTX financial model is created for entirely different reasons with entirely different goals, that's why it's important to have the separation, to make it easier to highlight why an MTX model would be bad for RuneScape. Instead of having people adjusted to the idea that an MTX model already exists, and isn't so bad, so we should just "trust Jagex".
---
But you can carry graceful with 1 inventory slot instead of 6...
---
whoops my b, they added it last update
---
Youve literally changed your argument 5 times now every time I call you out, shut up. Picking a colour based off a pro is very fucking different to "playstyle".

against because the really high value items get hoarded by the super rich who make money by lending them

You can try Ice Trolls on Neitiznot, the guards help you kill them so all you have to do is last hit them for their alchs iirc.

There is also a range/cannon safespot over on jatizo side idk about neitizot

I’m getting back into OSRS. Can someone explain to me what this gear is and how to get it, because I’m very interested.
---
So its been answered. But i trained at fire giants. Safespotted all of them. Then idk why but i picked up fire runes and it was like a stack of 3k runes. I hadnt picked any up before.
---
Idc I want the chair
---
The 2.5b one hurt lol. But then when i got back up to 750m after so much b.s. and just not having a good time, i felt good again finally and then blam. Dont get me wrong rng is rng - but there absolutely are patterns in this game and honestly its annoying. I promise im not a conspiracy kinda guy, however I also understand osrs is running on a dated engine, and certain things are just bs. 
---
For example, this guy ive staked numerous times (lets say 13 times probably) has 4 less attack, and 1 less defense. Same stats otherwise (118 combat, 85 def 94 att 99 str/hp so not maxed) and i have literally never won once against him. The odds of me not beating him at least ONE time, with having superior stats, is astronomically fucking low. Or it SHOULD be. Im not really superstitious either, but ive made one for myself and i hate it. First off - I cant duel him anymore. Just in my head is that I'll never win, and 2nd is that hes got that blue skin or whatever type of dye it is and I always lose to that skin model/outfit. Again, a silly superstition i normally dont have but created for myself somehow. 
---
Sorry long post lol just need to vent. So naturally the realist in me says that while hes won 13 times to my 0, its not like ive done 13 in a row with him directly (although ive done 4-5 in a row and even THAT is horse shit when i already lost 2x before those) but i mean, even thinking as a realist and non conspiracy theorist, I swear that some accounts just have a "shit bracket" (as in, a rng bracket of sorts) vs another player. This other guy who has 5 def on me and i have 1 att on him, everytime weve staked the last 6-7 times ive won. 
---
Its just weird, and again rng can be "50/50" of course but i do see patterns and it's hard to wrap my head around sometimes. I know you arent gonna win every stake.. But i mean to lose 13 out of 13 to someone you have higher stats in every category than, it starts to feel like a big pile of shit. 
---
- my b for wall. Havent vented that out yet and needed to haha.

When you can do, torstol and snape grass for max xp. It will pay for itself.

Both their kicks are ❄️❄️❄️
---
Clue scrolls don't really need graceful considering house pools and the amount of teleports in the game
---
Aesthetic even
---
It's the ornament from rs2 that people really wanted back.
---
Kinda they use "real boost" which isn't actually real it's just the marketing name. It feels quite similar and pretty much looks the same as the real thing. You can pay more for "BASF boost" which looks closer but imo not worth paying more for.

The gold was added to fit Zalcano's theme more.

I'm 70 ranged 76 HP 70 def right now and trying to kill Galvek. I currently have no issue with the fight mechanics but I keep running out of supplies in the second phase.

This is not a skilling problem. This is an OSRS problem.  Best in slot is easy to find out and the culture obsessed over it.

&gt;Go marry Xi ji ping or smth if you love censorship, let the man joke about w/e he finds funny.
---
Where did I ever say I was for censorship? This comment has nothing to do with what I said. I expressed that I don't find this type of humor funny since it can actually be harmful, not that he musn't have the right to say it. I said he **shouldn't** say it *publicly* or at least as a society we shouldn't be okay with these jokes said out of a private environment and at least shun them, not censor them. He can say whatever he wants and I can express my opinion about it freely too.
---
&gt;I personally thought it was quite funny since in Islam, women are infact second class citizen.
---
And this is why jokes like these are abhorrent - they bring out these thoughts that are still in their infantility and that are categorically untrue. What can I say though, I don't expect any different from this sub.
---
No. But they could remove that gold on it.
---
My comment was in reference to it saying "here comes rapid fire dragon fire so turn off run". Can just keep it off and hit control if you DO need to run at any point.

I honestly feel graceful was a bigger mistaken then just adding a rest option in the game

&gt; Run energy is a HUGE problem for new players, and if every player wears graceful anyway it's basically like nobody is wearing graceful - graceful is the new "no armour".
---
Except for activities where run energy plays a big role, e.g. Sara Godwars.
---
Try not playing it on ancient hardware.
---
Heh heh.

I think it's funny that this very subreddit got all uppity about chatheads being changed for no reason, but now that another completely unnecessary change is being proposed people on this sub want it just because some weeaboo doesn't want it. That is some serious cognitive dissonance.
---
I personally think there could be a ring thst costs a bit more than full graceful that works like graceful and nullifies your armor's stats except maybe weight.
---
Also not to be confused with chestbrah the body builder

Inspired by John C?

The same happened to me. I used around 30 min jumping between worlds and restarting the client, but it wouldn't spawn. I almost made a post in here myself, but then I switched to the official client and suddenly the tree was there. I can't see why the client should be the problem, but it seemed to work for me.

Just did some calculations. On average dwh actually reduces def by more (marginally), however bgs is much more consistent: 6% chance to miss both specs vs dwh 22.7% (in max gear), and 10% vs 36% at base 75s (with reasonable gear).
---
also dwh uses an extra inventory slot for the defender which isn't ideal
---
Achieved at Runespan, smh
---
Would that not cause some serious balance issues to get that effect while wearing normal armours? Perhaps this would work ONLY if your other equipped items give no stats? I'm not sure if items like elegant have stats, but I think this could be a viable way of using it in the arrow slot.
---
Totally worth it though over losing a 15k xp drop.

To whoever is reading this comment you said Chestbrah in his voice, admit it.

The reason why bp cant have mutagen recolours isnt that the devs dont want to add the feature, but that every different dart type in bp is a different item, and to add the recolours you would need to have three different items per dart type.
---
nah its a hacked account

A spec better than claws? That's a bit absurd. I think it's fine as is. It should be a cheap upfront weapon to use your spare shards on, after which you sell it on.

I don't recall saying it was **critically** important. I am saying all of these small issues combined make one major issue.

Ah yes the wiki that was updated last in '17 for reference information.

You have to post every bit of drop you get on reddit?

Your long term goal should be the quest cape. Don't actively go for it and burn out, but doing quests will balance your skills out as well as unlock lots of useful content.

Not at all what I'm doing. Bye.

Printscreen. Use it.
---
Tyvm man, yeah this pet was a pain in the ass
---
Pet chance is only increased after 200m exp. :S
---
&gt; But it's really good agility xp, so it shouldn't be a really good shard rate, likewise, zalcano is really good shard rate, but awful xp rate
---
Only since its recent buff. And even then we'll have to wait and see where shards go to see how it compared to Ardy with its Marks of Grace. Also, if good exp means it gives bad shards, then how do you explain Iron? Granted, power mining Iron late game isn't amazing exp, but it is still high exp and with a nearby deposit box too.
---
It will be interesting to see where Divine Super Combats go. Given how niche the potions are, I don't think we need to nerf them or add more reqs. But the viability of the crystal items does concern me with how costly they currently are. Hopefully, that cost comes down, but we'll have to wait and see.
---
Next stop, getting your first 99!

Yeah it was a pain getting this pet

Dear Thurgo, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'

I got a GE offer full of redberry pies waiting for you my chap.

I like the blurite sword you made too, that shit was phat

Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
---
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is wise old man.
---
That would be a completely acceptable title. I'm just overly upset by click bait, apologies.
---
I beg to differ. My closest attempt on my ironman was having Jad spawn healers and was out of food. As soon as i started to kill the healers, one smacks me for my remaining hp, had a few pray pots left, but no food. That remains as my closest as i made a new acc shortly after :)
---
I did the same thing but from a fresh account. i trained hunter to 80 and used hunter potion to hunt implings. 15k magpies (what you will be catching most) 25k ninjas and 350k dragons. you can also snare them so they dont run if you fail a catch attempt.  you will have to do lost city but its very simple. i hunted imps for my first 6 bonds whilenleveling slayer and now passive slayer sustains my acc.
---
It doesn't make a difference what these people do in there free time or how they play the game, they're still his customers, and I dare say the anime ehp nerds are probably his best customers.
---
It seems like a decent number of people think the set effect makes your run last longer.
---
The set effect makes your energy restore 30% quicker. You only restore energy when standing still or walking though, you do not restore any energy while running. The set effect isn't useless its still good, but not nearly as good as I think people think it is
---
Also in case you're not aware all weights below 0 are the same as 0, so there's no need to be at -20kg vs 0kg. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Take off some of your graceful pieces and put on some fashion :]
---
really loving this "no shit sherlock" series. 
---
a suggestion for the next episode, "when your prayer hits 0, you can no longer pray."
---
So when exactly did they change this and could you provide some actual evidence? Mod Ash tweeted in 2017 that ”Energy regeneration doesn't happen while you're running. Graceful kit just changes the rate at which it happens when it does happen.” (https://mobile.twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/874935498984345601). So unless you show me the update in which this was changed, I’ll take the word of our God over you.
---
it's at least 6 severe.
---
that "makeameme" tag has iFunny energy
---
Man they grow up so fast :) maybe one day, this guy could max. People can dream big.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a joke. Big brain moment.
---
Oh. No.
---
Yes, but there is a good chance that the early game might be super f boring so here is some tips; 
---
Run energy is shit, deal with it and try to get 57 agility and full graceful (will take 3 days of boredom, but its worth it if you want to keep playing the game)
---
do a lot of early quests to skip a lot of hours of training.
---
Your goal should be trying to get 75 in all stats or quest cape, then all achivement diaries done and then max. gl and try to have some fun, if you get bored of the grind then try out rs3.
---
also dont fucking play ironman mode if you are a returning player, I swear to god that is a fucking meme. its runescape but without the social aspect of trading items with players.
---
I started 2 months ago, I had a great timein f2p. When I did all of the quests and got my stats into the 40’s and 60’s I bought membership. Been playing alot since then, while it does get quite grindy the game is extremely fun.
---
Yeah all I was saying is prices seem above what they should be because of the ability to buy gold through 3rd party sites and bonds. Although the way I said it didn't really say that
---
"Changes like these are what led to RS3"
---
I am back on, W330
---
Have you tried talking to Zalcano?
---
if he touches the newly added anvil in UGP i'm out
---
Why are you getting so defensive over this request?
---
Rsn: Vespolar1 see you in game :)
---
Oh yeah it's more afk than NMZ? Motherlode? Fishing?
---
So is chestbrah an actual different guy or is it just an elaborate rendi alt prank?
---
Why does it need a buff?
---
It’s a god damn mini game.
---
Even the light one is disgusting
---
r/iamverysmart
---
train combat so i can actually use gear worth 40m
---
then id sit down and wonder why i just spent 80$ on a game ive had for a week
---
Oh I see the 99 reposting too gz!
---
S
---
Blowpipe + crystal bow is great too if someone values a shield with cbow more :D
---
Train prayer to 43 atleast
---
who needs the stam pot bridge when you have this guy
---
Law of attraction
---
For all you thirsty runecrafter boys
---
Fyi it's actually sinking feeling
---
Completely depends on the goals of your account, you're so fresh that you could just get a decent lvl in every skill. I'd spend the first money on training prayer to 43, use someones house or the wildy altar, you dont need that many bones.
---
Could probably also get full obsidian and afk at rock crabs and lvl your combat stats. When you're done you can resell the gear again.
---
Better off setting yourself a goal like completing recipe for disaster than thinking how can I spend 40m
---
Might want to get a job at the grocery store kiddo. Hunting swamp lizards for 300 hours isn't a job. Keep selling merch ? If you sold out so fast why would you continue to allow yourself to sell out instead of providing some form of merch people always have access to...
---
I would love to be able to remove the metal shoulder pads and trim ribbons off a skill cape, removing all stats, and then using a graceful cape on it.
---
 This would allot the agility cape to still be a "tanky" gracefully cape without having to pay for a conversion, but still allow us to show off skillcapes with our graceful set.
---
Get you a snelm
---
Bet ya dont call thieving  bdsm
---
That depends what you mean by making it last longer. If at any point you stop, then it does make your energy last longer overall. If you'd otherwise have weight above 0, then it does make your energy last longer.
---
HYPERBRUH
---
Unless you're bankstanding or doing combat you may as well wear Graceful which is why everyone does it.
---
Because it's not even close to being decent for the amount of effort put into it.
---
The only reason to play the gauntlet is for fun or the pet.
---
What would you recommend if I can't flick? I try to do it, but I am not perfect. When it comes to Jad though I try to just keep pray on.
---
Blood spells are a great idea! Thanks for that, I am pretty concerned on how I'm going to heal.
---
It does, assuming you’re holding anything else that weighs something. This title is misleading. It does make run energy last longer, but to a limited extent - that extent being how much weight you’re carrying.
---
Damn they got Jays &amp; yeezys
---
You run out of run energy when you hunt salamanders. Why use stam pots when graceful will eliminate the need for it?
---
do oak tree farming until ranarrs, buy a stock of ranarr seeds and start doing herb runs multiple times a day - work towards quests which unlock more patches, work towards a house that offers most teleports/pools.
---
these 2 things will save you a fair bit of money in the long run
---
get 43 prayer
---
work towards unlocking royal trouble for kingdom management, work on varrock diaries as a priority, other diaries if the feeling hits ya
---
with that hp, i'd wait until other skills are up past 60's before doing wintertodt - also wait until your house has the teleports/pool to make it easier 
---
probably do slayer in the inbetween
---
It’s not MEANT to be a money maker.. that’s the thing I think your missing.
---
\&gt; Also in case you're not aware all weights below 0 are the same as 0, so there's no need to be at -20kg vs 0kg. 
---
That's assuming you''re carrying nothing. If you're carrying 19kg worth of stuff, then having full graceful is useful so your run energy doesn't deplete as if you had 19kg net weight.
---
We literally got a new course in the last two weeks.
---
Is that your opinion or Jagex' official stance?
---
Really just sounds like you're trying to push for a merch. As well as the OP here.. "oh look how these items are rising in price guys LOOK THEY ARE GOING TO RISE". Pretty obvious to me
---
No I think he's doing rc 2nd to last and Slayer last
---
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Take my updoot and thanks for the laugh, man.
---
Ouch. So close yet so far
---
You are very dumb
---
You don't even spend supplies for it
---
Yes this is why you wear graceful for zeah rc but for abyss/ourania you mix with boots of lightness and spottier cape so that you have more weight for defensive clothes.
---
Use gilded altar in someone's house with dragon bones and get 43 prayer. Train combat/slayer and upgrade your gear. Start doing quests and train for the level requirements as needed.
---
I’ve killed 600 haven’t received one yet but have completed a heavy ballista
---
Add a new course for 90 agility with marks to buff graceful like the barb outpost side thingy agility. That was cool as fuck
---
I can double your gp Jennay, please love me.
---
99 agility almost doubles your run energy recharge rate vs level 1 as it is, that's big.
---
Yes i agree about the weight, but graceful isnt even bis weight reduction
---
q p w hand tat lmao
---
and thousands of sweaty nerds will grind it for hundreds of hours for that sole reason
---
Another one
---
I thought this was for osrs related content, not a Facebook simulator.
---
Rc bad
---
£20 figured it would be a fair price for a game that's free and this big. Haven't done it yet though, was more contemplating it
---
All guides should be in this format
---
I guess if you can read it is enough to be smart around here.
---
You can still wear 19kg of weight reduction and some fashionscape in your head or cape slot
---
No
---
All it takes is having weight on you.
---
If you have 20 weight on you with the set, you'll weigh 0kg and you run energy will last longer than if you don't have the set.
---
This is how bossing should be. If anything, it's probably still too lucrative. It should be a chance at a good drop, not consistently great money.
---

---
same!
---
I also leveled up quite a bit in f2p before p2p. I would recommend runecrafting until level 30 atleast. For all the hate this skill gets, it's still pretty fast to level 30. 
---
I would also recommend getting att, str, def, range to 70. I did this at moss giants and it wasn't too bad. Everything else looks great though!
---
This is why you see people wear skillcapes to flex while doing agility but use the full graceful set when runecrafting.

Lizardman Temple in Molch. (south of farming guild)
---
Honestly man, the best way I can explain it is, it's 100% psychological. You gotta program your brain to not care about how long itll take. You gotta just do it, and not think about it. Pull up some movies or videos on a second monitor or something
---
That's incredibly unlucky. Oof.
---
You just said that zolcano is a boss, and in the same sentence you said:
---
&gt; "you seriously need some help and to learn there is more to rs then farming bosses and mot every boss needs to make mad money"
---
My question to you would be then why is zolcano 3-4m/hr or something, and it is really easy compared to corrupted mode gauntlet. And why is corrupted gauntlet only 2m+/hr?
---
Doesn't really matchup in my opinion.

So I understand you grew the mithril bars with mithril seeds.... but how did you grow the gold ore?
---
The misconception lies in the way run works. Prior to graceful, You would wear hunter capes, boots of lightness and i think full hunter gear used to be quite light/offer negative weight values. The goal was to reduce KG to increase how long you run for. Nakeds will ofcourse, run the longest. Heavily armored people will burn through run energy like crazy.
---
Agreed. \^\^

---
Literally everywhere. Any time more than like 5 players are on my screen somebody has it.
---
As someone who flips team zero capes, I can safely say that even if you sell it instantly, you will get at least 99% of its current "true value" on the ge.
---
Its funny... I just don't understand how it's possible to do this with years of guthix though
---

---
Weight reducing equipment wouldn't be that important if this was implemented. You could get an additional -13.5 if you wore boots of lightness, spottier cape, and penance gloves. It's a nice bonus but it would only be beneficial when you carry a ton of heavy stuff in your inv.
---
It should be limited to items with a very low weight to keep this from becoming significantly more powerful than graceful. Stamina's and other energy restoring items would become less useful if this reduced the weight of combat armour.
---
I can't think of many unintentional buffs that would cause issues. I guess skilling outfits would be a bit better, but I honestly think that's completely fine.
---
Ghostly equipment, halos, climbing boots, weigh less than 1 kg. And there's probably a ton more I can't think of. But you could just turn this effect off in the wilderness if PKers think this causes a problem.
---
The problem isn't the stats it's that it's "unuseable" due to it requiering 3h of Crystals for every 1h of combat.
---
I didn't know you decided what content gets buffed and what doesn't. I am simply trying to get my voice heard, and there are a lot of people in this post who agree but also disagree with me. It is great that this has sparked so much conversation on the topic. But I don't know how you can just say pretty much that "new content being dead content in a few months is fine"... Because that is basically what you are intending there. 2m/hr for a hard "minigame" that has no other rewards than the pet / money. is ridicilous.
---
I am gonna start it asap! thanks man!
---
I can't use rune yet
---
This is how I play, I try to dress for the activity I’m doing. For example I’m smithing right now so I got an outfit together that looks like a smiths outfit.
---
You’d be surprised how many people wear graceful to run from West Varrock bank to the anvil.
---
Damn, how did every pker in the game type this one reddit post? That's amazing
---
Goooootem
---
my fragile world view is officially shattered. Thanks reddit.
---
We're doing a poll for some post-SotE changes soon. I'd be shocked if they didn't at least acknowledge some things like the Crystal Armor and the Blade.
---
Also, reqs for money-making methods aren't super consistent. With Zulrah, you can do it with budget gear, but it does benefit to have better gear and higher levels. It also has low quest reqs, but it still does need you to start Regicide and you'd probably want the Fairy Ring and Agility shortcut until you can manage enough kills to use Scrolls, which usually means more gear investment. Stuff like Revs is no quest but you'd probably want a decent weapon so some investment; also it is very volatile since PvP area. And I'd say most skilling has a high req even if it lacks a gear req; though you could say stuff like Rune Pouch for RC or Tank Gear for Black Chins.
---

Iron Man btw
---
sell the tbow, buy 2 elys and go to arma with 2 accounts, much less effort and its around 7m-8m/h
---
no thats the point of this video, you do not need full graceful for abyss/zmi runecrafting only zeah.
---
 you dont stand still long enough to take advantage of the effect, and you can get to 0 kg weight without the full set, and you need to use stamina potions anyways
---
Got it on there for 3.65mil now, I'll just leave it on there for a while. It'll be more money than I've ever had so I'm happy either way really haha. Thanks for the advice
---
Tbh for a huge gold price, or marks of grace, or something like that, it could just be graceful compacted into 2 pieces, so you can have some fashionscape too

Don’t
---
&gt;Like I get people’s argument for not  buffing it, but gauntlet is legitimately difficult(especially corrupt)  and the rewards you get for completing it don’t really add up.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But then you look at normal  gauntlet and it’s almost not even worth running.  The loot you  typically get from normal is about the same you’d get for killing KBD,  but nearly 5x the time and the difficulty difference.

\^\^\^\^\^ Yup.

Mining is a tough skill to grind because 85 mining gives access to runite which used to be a good moneymaker (best in f2p). Idk if that's still true but last time I was in deep wildy the 3 rocks were all free.
---
I'm already petless on 99 thieving, farming, and hunter. I might go back for those, but if I go petless getting 99 runecrafting I think I'll let that one go. You're a lot more dedicated than me.
---
They are so desperate of making magic a viable combat style, but they don't know why it is in rs3.
---
6 accounts to max combat isn't an achievement at all.
---
I'm not up to date on the QOL lore, but regarding safespots: That's the power of mage and range. Before bp at least, melee was much stronger (and cheaper) than the others DPS wise. But mage and range have always offered you the possibility of safespotting. 
---
I have the opposite problem with that. I hate that they've nerfed lizarmdan shamans like 50 times to get rid of all the range safepots. That's the power of range. Why not nerf green dragons, blue dragons, and every NPC in the game then? Why are lizardman shamans getting special treatment.
---
RS3 map is also the same way, and considering they wanted to take a lot of inspiration from rs3 prif, it makes sense to keep the city invisible to outsiders. Although I remember them saying they would allow non elves into the city, so I can’t remember why it’s hidden to the outside world. Regardless, the map only updates when inside the city.

I always play fullscreen mode and zoomed out all of the way when AFK, but it doesn't seem to help for this.  I can't run from the MLM deposit box to the bag without having to click further away (or click esc), or spin my screen.  All other places don't seem to be a problem.
---
I used thw same setup including inferno adze and mages book I'd like to have the inferno adze added to osrs I know we already have one but I miss the good old animation it used to give off while woodcutting.
---
Well I think its cause shamans actually have mechanics compared to the other npcs you meantioned. Even if you can range or mage something doesnt mean you shouldnt have to dodge occasionally
---
So happy for my base 1 level skills
---
And a cape which shows you havent fully lookwd into it all the way or probably even played it. And it does make sense because still challenge kbd and infernal cape for times to see who does best ans it cost literallt nothing to do gauntlet if you dont like a MINIGAME that makes 2m/hr go back to camping bosses
---
Get into a clan chat. It makes it more enjoyable to grind as you talk to them while grinding.
---
Don't try to sustain membership until you hit end game, you will get burnt out real fast doing the same thing over such as Barrows during mid game. Just wait till end game when you have probably at least 75 combat stats and 75 Slayer.
---
I legit don't care about any of this
---
“Foot stance” not being a dick just thought you should know the truth
---
Fashionscape variety would be more diverse, and this would definitely be something that is locked behind a looong grind. Hell maybe make it cost like 500 marks of grace and require a full recolor of every set. Wouldn't be worth the grind for most players, but nice reward for the ones who do decide to do it.
---
Time you could spend moneymaking+cons is better than doing RC. Also there are some not so well known strats like myth or legend capes for cons. Its has great xp/GP ratio.

Graceful isn't useful in clues because its better to just wear teleport gear from diaries and not in agility either because of the passive regen on rooftops. Maybe on other courses like Werewolf but I never tested it.

Graceful isn't really that useful but because people think it is, they continue to use it for everything.

I remember just wanting to KMS when i  was trying to rc lavas.

But then i tried to ZMI and i want KMS less. You click once and get to afk for like 20 seconds. Also filling/removing from pouches with runelite is super ez cause you can hold shift to empty easier.

Honestly, runelite is seriously making the game so much easier.

Inefficient rc isn't much more click intensive nor much slower than, say, inefficient slayer. Rc is just more boring because every run is the same. And rc makes like 800k-1.3m per hour depending on what rune you're making, starting at double cosmics
---
Obviously to each their own, but if I had to play 8 hours straight I'd much rather do rc than slayer because I could open a couple movies on the second monitor and chill with a beer instead of having to focus on what setup I need for the next task
---
problem people go reee rs3, people fail to realize rs3 is better then osrs in so many ways.  The reason no one plays it is because of mtx + eoc. we had 50-70k on in 2011 pre eoc compared to 50k now and 50k bots/gold sellers.
---
Nah mate never said that, but sounds like a bot to me
---
you can't mage through that stalagmite.  some obstacles you can, some you can't.  if you're able to range/mage a monster, it's able to range/mage you back.  Large monsters like the dagannoth mother will get stuck on obstacles and can't get past, but sadly she has the ranged attack and will be attacked you anyway.  at the very least, you can guarantee only a ranged attack will come.
---
futhermore, you can get 1-square large units stuck around a corner, but this is something you'll have to experiment yourself as i cba explaining it.  easier to just range over a rock for those
---
Lol the jagex employee who read this must of died laughing. I remember in school this chick would make fun of me that I played RuneScape and she would do it in front of the class. She would draw the RuneScape logo on the chalk board and laugh at me... jokes on her... her brother played and was nearly maxed but she never knew :)
---
It's an incredibly dumb post. There are plenty of places where having most of the graceful pieces are important (an example being getting weight down at blast furnace smithing), and plenty of places where the actual effect of graceful is meaningful (smithing plates, zeah rc are two incredibly obvious examples of many). I don't understand how OP can be so clueless.

Hands up if you knew exactly what this was before clicking it
---
doesn't work with range/mage as it takes time for the projectile to cause recoil.  it \*does\* work if you splash, because that causes recoil instantly, but obviously that gets you nowhere.
---
&gt; I'm starting to think that graceful should have its set effect completely replaced and overhauled, and run energy be buffed across the board to near-graceful levels instead.
---
If you're talking about that drake meme thread about graceful, that was actually one of the lowest IQ threads I've ever read. People seriously suggesting to make the graceful set bonus the default, making graceful +2.5% xp, making set bonuses into a blessing, etc.

Depends what you're using it for. Usually at bosses yes because dragon bolts are a huge difference but if you dont need the range for whatever you're doing, blowpipe is probably better.

This and the BiS dungeoneering armor at the time looked SO fucking dogshit- literally the most braindead designers created this shit. When you played at normal viewing distance this set would turn into fucking STATIC it was so hyper detailed. I think OP's image is of the set toned down a little- I remember that gross layering of black and white extending onto the legs too.
---
He would have to die with a full inventory more than half of his runs for it to not be worth
---
So before warding.
---
Gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Actually hilarious. But whilst I'm guessing this is completely satirical I'm actually very hopeful this continues haha
---
I would still run blast furnace in full graceful instead of nothing... Coal and ores are heavy in the inventory and weight reduction is your best friend there. Even stamina pots take a beating over there.
---
It’s not really abuse if it’s been a core part of pvp for 15+ years.
---
I did a little [write-up on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/2ky0y0/heres_a_trick_to_make_your_run_energy_go_further/) about 4 years ago.
---
The interesting thing is that [memes like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cl3kdq/speed_i_am_speed/) actually improve how far you can get with the same amount of run energy because (and I take no credit for this, it was Woox's testing) your run energy never goes below 0 even if the amount that should have been consumed that tick would theoretically take you negative.
---
Thus reactivating your run every time it reaches one is a viable strategy for getting to places quicker if you don't have staminas or other energy replenishing items.
---
I mean, if Summoning or Dungeoneering were added back in I'd finally have a good hard reason to quit. Even RSHD and I'm out.
---
30 def was a big thing in the pure world back then
---
Still half of graceful is BIS weightlessness but yes, the set effect is run Regen which is imperative for many activities

There's clearly no point in discussing this with you since you refuse to look at this logically. 
---
Anyone at the stage of doing TOB on the regular is not investing time in collecting shards for a blade. They will use a tent whip until they get lucky and get their scythe and this is clearly apparent if you have even done any tob.
---
Most people don't even bother bringing a rapier switch to vasa if they already have a lance since it's just as good. 
---
And yes shards are something you go out of your way for. The fact you bring up agility as a method shows me already you have no idea what you are talking about considering how painfully slow it is to obtain shards via that method. The two best methods (gauntlet and zalcano) to obtain shards are at a pitiful 40-50 p/h and that's if you get lucky. The fact shards are tied to other content in divine potions probably means we will unlikely see a buff to the rate of shard collecting due to the impact to these items. 
---
5k shards for a permanent charge is 100m gp and 100 hours of play time not including the time invested questing. Most players looking for a weapon of that caliber are just going to sit at zulrah for that amount of time and make enough for 2 rapiers. 
---
Rapier will always have a place as long as time restraints exist on creating the charged blade but it seems you fail to comprehend this fact.
---
I really like how this looks compared to the graceful set and we don’t have a dark gray or black set really sucks. Also miss the 2009 graphics/ RS HD!

The only concern I have with it is the possibility that they may introduce something to correct this.  Whether it's increasing ways to get the crystal tree seed or buffing drop rate of the weapon seed.  That's the only concern preventing me from HODL.

That's just my opinion. The game is still enjoyable but it'd be nice for them to reflect on what the game is, what the player base is asking for and get that sorted before trying to deliver things we don't necessarily desire and wasting what could potentially be months of development time planning just to scrap it when all that time and work could have gone into an update the majority wants.

A quest line featuring the sandwich lady and evil chicken going into business, meeting all the old random events and starting up a random event shop full of sandwiches and tricks with fun rewards. Right? 🤔
---
I just suck up the inefficient movement out of refusal to give up my fashionscape, but it'd be nice if you could compress the graceful set into a ring/neck/quiver
---
The problem is the lack of mage special attack weapons. There’s no viable way to KO people with mage beside maxing out hits.
---
I don't wear white because it was more difficulty it just looks better than the rest in most cases
---
Wear proselyte cheat and legs and a nezzy helm and then max out your strength bonus from there. Use prayer potions and either overloads or super attack and strengths. You can afk for at least 5 mins probably that way

So then would you have to avoid doing quests that give large exp drops until you're at a point where they won't cause you to gain several levels?

why spend 300 hours making a video when you can spend 300 seconds.

I just think that the run restore rate should scale based on how many pieces you have equipped.

Not just an all or nothing set effect
---
everyone who had it loved it
---
1. Yea, I was, it falls under my right of free speech. 2. Very hypocritical considering you using age as an insult (especially since nowhere in my post, nor his, showed any signs of immaturity) and 3. Calling me a snowflake is hypocritical as well, since I never indicated being personally attacked nor have I presented myself in such a manner, nor attacked him in any way shape or form, but by your response you seemed have have been offended by it by your response examples being: calling me the equivalant of a 7 year old and calling me a snowflake. So in your own words, "stop being a snowflake", and have a nice day :)

I would agree a few years ago, but we've gotten some amazing content updates that far surpass the benefits of pre eoc.

I’m not sure this is exactly true
---
You stop failing Seers at 79, with 56k agility xp an hr.
---
Priff is 66k agility xp hr at 90, which is only 10%, plus the fail rate and time punishment here is huge, with the wiki reckoning 53k xp hr at 75
---
I think Priff is better, but its definitely not “literally 25% more experience”
---
lol
---
How about the ring has no effects at all, unless warn with the full set if graceful, giving 2.5% increased co rate on completion of a rooftop course?
---
You know, something that actually makes sense and isnt broken.
---
This isn't a post about song of the elves, this a general post about everything that is added to the game and how some of the stuff seems unobtainable.
---
Hey did a random guy in lumbridge run up to you and trade you hundres of striped feathers recently
---
Most people us guides which remove all the fun of doing a quest. Obviously reading a list of tasks and completing them step by step is boring.

There's gotta be a better way!!

Grats dude!!! Fuckin nice first pet tbh
---
In those cases the typical joke is to insinuate that the gf is the OP's sister
---
I can’t beat Seren I can barely get her to 40% before I’m out of food
---
is it so hard to copy paste extra graceful set and use bucket to make it black?
---
I do both PKing and PVMing at revs often and it would be hard to estimate how much it's saved me/how many extra kills I've gotten because of it. Just don't actively plan to use it as an escape every time - use it as a last resort when teleblocked.
---
Whichever you want or is required for a certain milestone or quest
---
This also means a completely different thing

Like reproducing? Burn

Jk jk goodjob

Thank you! My drop before this kill was 2 uncut dragon stones and 16 uncut sapphires and I almost left. My chest exploded

Git gud

Imagine getting that offended over someone saying thanks cpt obvious.

Idk man if you are not mid-high level then there is already a looooot of stuff for you to do, including new new updates. Theres nothing wrong with adding content for players who have are ready for the next challenge

If you think that's crying you're just dumb.
---
i died a lot to galvek, completed ds2, tried to do vork , failed, tried again, failed, tried again fialed, tried to kill rune dragons, failed, tried to kill vork, failed.
---
started playing ironman.
---
Same quests as for 1def but with nature spirit.
---
Sandcrabs
---
Yes lol, by the hop patch?
---
Because of all the problems with the game some jackass walking around lumbridge isn’t a huge deal. The poll system is still 1000x better than anything any other game has
---
This would impact very little i think
---
People would likely just choose to wear the outfit just for the negative weight
---
Once people hit 75 agility, they would swap the graceful cape for the other weight reducing cape
---
If u use it a lot and its worth it keep it, if it isnt worth what it does, sell it.
---
Only you play with that sgs and that character soo youre the only one that can decide upon wether to keep or sell it.
---
Now is a bad time to sell it btw
---
Do Kandarin diaries and seers? Maybe it’s not worth it at this point for you but seers has + 5/10/15% marks of grace with the respective diaries
---
What do you plan to run gear wise for firecape? Im almost to 70 range then going to attempt to get it as well!
---
Inefficient bad setup.
---
Do people ever look you up and head you off at the shortcut? That'd be my biggest fear lol. Definitely appreciate the tips, I was beginning to think 70 for blue drags was about it
---
Low dps doesnt make the fight harder than galvek, galvek has more mechanics, you rely heavily on bolt procs and have the instant death fireball being spat every 2 seconds, with low dps the fight with seren would just take longer
---
I'd like to add on to this with some other info
---
If you are a baller on a budget you can replace the super combats with super attack and Dragon battleaxe.I usually use ~4 super attacks per trip being fairly afk.
---
Gear until ~92hp goes Full obsidian with berserker&gt; Whip&gt; Dharok if you are fighting the right monsters which are the ones above. If you don't have all of the ones the poster above mentioned, it goes Me, tree spirit, khazard warlord, bouncer in order of preference (weakest defense to strongest).  
---
You use a rock cake to get to 1 hp use the right click guzzle at first and to get from 2 to 1 hp. This way the most a monster hit will take from the absorption shield is 1 or whatever your hp are at the time if below their max hit.
---
You could do wyverns
---
Dont feel too bad. I'm 3k dry at zulrah with no uniques.
---
fml 😑
---
I was just using him as an example, try to keep up.
---
Swamp
---
Looks like that fat ass zombie stuck in the well of season 2 walking dead.
---
Slayer helm, superior creatures, bosses (in that order)
---
Next is up to you but I extended gargoyles, black dragons, rune dragons, and a couple other tasks as well as unlocked tzhaar tasks
---
HELP AND GUIDANCE BAD.
---
Are they just called wyverns or a specific kind
---
This and calc our your attack xp from quests accordingly
---
&gt;Going frugal is fine, but people tend to forget that being frugal on the cost of gp makes you extremely wasteful of **time**.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;In the end it's best to find a mix of gp, time and fun. It's a game after all in the end.
---
Stop playing the game the way I don't like! 😤😤
---
Shift empty is a default feature not from runelite btw
---
Mod West has recently said that it won't be any time soon
---
Pretty sure most people wouldn't like that rhetoric at parties unless you're still in highschool or with a bunch of clout chasers. I'm sorry you can't grow up :/
---
The blade was never going to be worth over 100m. The ghrazi rapier has the exact same stats except it uses stab instead of slash. Theres not many monsters/bosses where its worth to use because the rapier has the same damage output.
---
Not to mention it takes forever to charge and burns through them very quickly. Hopefully they can at least fix that.
---
Right! I got quest cape and do farm runs without graceful and I survive just fine with the way my house is set up
---
I like it, the proposed icons actually look like boots.
---
It lasts for exactly 100 minutes of combat
---
Wrong, a ton of old games like melee, super Mario 64 are getting brought to their knees.
---
Yep, its him!
---
And I’m sorry you can’t take a joke :/
---
Trollin?
---
Petition to improve graceful set effect
---
Yeah I do :) Took about 8 attempts, but managed it as a pure
---
If it sat in the 85-90 agility range (instead of 60 for full graceful) I think it would be ok.
---
&gt; Which shouldn't be news to anyone as it's already widely documented and understood to work that way.
---
Guess what; it is.
---
No?  What am I missing?
---
Objectively they are usually "cool" colors and get used often in a lot of other mediums too. The slayer cape being red and black is always gonna add to the popularity since it's slayer.
---
How the fuck is it overpowered when stamina potions exist?
---
You make memes come true :’)
---
Elemental shield
---
That shield doesn't work on fossil island wyverns.
---
Good question x
---
Literally unplayable
---
That makes sense. Scamming seems to have deeper roots in Runescape, with how the Wilderness has always functioned. Part of the reason I addressed scamming immediately. 
---
And the small group of people is how I intend this to be used, rather than by large clans. I only have 2 friends I know IRL who play OSRS, and they are the only two I ever lend items to. They would consequently also be the only two with access to my Bank Chest.
---
You need a mind shield or elemental shield for wyverns not the anti-fire
---
What is the efficient setup?
---
There are pyramid plunder bots that will stay logged in 24 hours a day and gain over 100 million xp before they get banned.
---
A guy posted info on his zulrah bots that made front page, his best one made over 1 trillion gold and was still not banned.

It's not just the bots coming back, their detection methods suck too.

That's a link to its stats (pre-EoC). The def bonus didn't really have much use, especially when you could wear hides with penance gloves/boots of lightness/spottier cape for higher bonuses &amp; still negative weight.

I hated it too, until I did some abyss nats. I honestly don’t think it’s too bad. 52 rc now from nats and I can still stand to do it. I’m sure bloods will be much better.

Looking forward to the last episode in May 2209.

Because they're just suggestions and are not likely to even be considered by jagex. If jagex did officially propose implementing one of reddits skill suggestions, I guarantee you'd quickly find a lot of opposition to it.

Why ru upvoted. Blast mine isnt blast furnace
---
.. thank you.  I saw all the dragonfire and just assumed anti-dragon.
---
No prob just thought u was trolling lol
---
It’s pretty obvious that he is a skill pure
---
And there goes 50 years of your life you'll never get back.
---
ya maybe at lvl 60 but zerkers start to outdmg pures at around 70 because of the gear. Zerk helm + chest + defender gives them more STR bonus than pures can get by having 1 def.
---
That's almost the exact route I run except I don't wait outside the last blast to pick up the ores. Light the last one,  then grab the ore to your left, then the one to the right,  then step outside the blast to grab the far right ore.
---
Lose 1-2 energy per lap, more on banking laps
---
what is the best pk build for lvl 80 then?
---
Pretty sure OP is telling people who mistakenly think you run longer with graceful which is why he said “PSA”...
---
I heard you can do blood runes at Zeyah.
---
Every time I see one of these threads I have to mention that it would take no more than an hour to program an algorithm to give you the solution, and use it.
---
I got through like 3 kills without a problem, and all of a sudden started getting shit on. I thought it was a bug, but I just got stupid lucky for 3 kills lol.
---
Sure.
---
It's in the grand exchange but it's still quite rare not a lot of people buying/selling.
---
Thats sounds an awful lot like warding, are you suggesting warding?😂
---
Yeah that’s not how that works lmao. The character was running the whole time, it doesn’t matter which way you run or if you set a new destination marker you’re still running and moving. Run energy is  a timer not a distance tracker.
---
Apparently a lot of people didnt know. Whats wrong with him posting this? Grow up
---
Seren has an attack that does close to max hp if that's what you mean? No insta-kills, sorry.
---
This guy is a fucking legend.
---
It's members only.
---
I was hoping to get 115-120m for the set (I see 130m on ge-tracker as the only two other sales recorded) Not really trying to separate the pieces but throw me an offer.
---
So would that make this guys inventory bag a toy bag?
---
fruit trees + mahogany trees yeld great xp for no effort. Try that out.

theres so many f2p worlds and the f2p wildy is dead , i died in like the 400s , clearly just bad mechanics.

It is pretty normal for someone to have their sexual preference change, for example I used to be heterosexual but once I got out of high school hormones died down and now I am asexual
---
So it's not that far fetched to be an ex-gay
---
 Q
---
Forreal like I actually enjoy crafting astral son lunar isle I don’t know why people bash on ex so much. Yea it’s slow xp but the profit is insane
---
I wonder how the boots would all look if the angle was changed to match dragon boots. I like the consistency change though
---
I speak for myself and not on behalf of the community, pal. 
---
More to the point, yes, we are seeing a number of things implemented and then subsequently polled but that’s still more efficient than polling EVERYTHING. 
---
Put yourself in their shoes with the addition of Hatius; he serves little purpose outside of four conversations for the diary, why would they even consider polling that when it’s insignificant. Sure, in hindsight, the majority hate him, but that’s the bittersweet nature of hindsight.
---
the probability of rolling two dice at the same time and trying to match them is 1/36

the probability of rolling one dice at a time and trying to match is 1/6

Personally I always found it incredibly boring, legitimate question:   
---
What did you or others like about it?
---
I did this yesterday. Found a level 8 and nabbed him
---
Cow hides in lumpy
---
exactly why i made this post, the you should only be standing still for 1-2 ticks at a time at BF no longer, so you dont have much time to take advantage of the restoration rate.
---
Boots of lightness and spottier cape both weigh even less than graceful so youre better off wearing graceful + boots of lightness + spottier cape instead of graceful boots/cape
---
Well it's something I'll verify when I max.
---
you can turn it off
---
Torso, defender, zerk helmet, b gloves is +18 str. B ring i for another +8 if the pure is using a +1. That makes up for it. Then ofc theres veng. Or u could double use void for a -1 max hit. Zerkers start hitting higher with melee in edge at 80 cmb, earlier if 50 atk. and 85 if 52 prayer/60atk. Pures max at 88 cmb. 
---
90 range void is better dps than 99 range even before armor consideration.
---
Yeah i wear mostly colored graceful with a hat and cape of fashionscape and that -20kgs is usually more than im ever carrying so it works most of the time without any thought and is stylish
---
the amount of ornament kits god damn!
---
PETA disapproves

You need to redo this with rc

So it seems some quest mobs can be tanked for your skiller, Lost City is the one I can find the most evidence for. Some other questions though like The Feud, I don't think the mobs can be tanked by anyone else plus they're poison immune.
---
Was hoping someone who's used this strat before would happen upon this thread to enlighten me lol.

Shades give like no xp for Slayer and combat training. It was recently polled to change this, but I don't remember if it passed.
---
As I really like any guild related stuff in games, it is hard to see such thing in osrs. I am not sure if something like this will be added to group Ironman if it ever comes out, but logging in for half a minute isn't a hard task to give something once and then take it back somewhen later. 
---
At the same time, it sounds like just second bank space if it checkes the "shared pool of wealth" condition. People will treat it as a second bank playing solo and that can be a critisism towards main bank being just 800 items which for someone isn't enough. 
---
One chest of 10 slots that your friend can access once a week to trade something doesn't really add that much of cooperation feel to the gameplay. Seems like alts, scammers and hackers/phishers would have much more value out of it rather than group of friends. 
---
The idea is fine, but, maybe, the time and conditions for it are just not yet there. If such thing was added, it would for sure need much more settings towards item limit, price limit that can be taken out for day/week and etc, list of things that were placed in/taken out, which can be filled with repeated actions to hide any possible stealing of an item. 
---
Like, in the end, it seems like hard coding/designe work for barely QoL update
---
You can easily tan cow hides with those stats
---
yeah I agree sexuality can be somewhat 'fluid' but the context of that post was not giving a progressive understanding of human sexuality, but more using someone who was (ex) gay as a shield for their homophobia,  'as a black man...' style. but it was fucking hilarious that they could only find an 'ex gay' to upvote Lol
---
Yeah, but I'm also saying that because most people don't use staminas anyway it serves another practical purpose for them
---
I have a friend who started playing recently who built up a 2mil bank from killing chaos druids and instead of spending a few 100k to level crafting to ~50 for quests he decided to actually kill cows as an 80cb to collect their hides to tan and craft. He is basically playing ironman mode and it frustrates me to no end how he refuses to spend next to nothing to save himself from HOURS of a boring grind.
---
Try looking out for skillers clan chats. I am pretty sure people there are experienced with such things. On Reddit you will be just hoping that someone sees the post

thank you, i've been in a really really dark place lately and this cheered me up today
---
I feel like I remember seeing a lot of pures that had them stockpiled in ridiculous amounts walking around in phats and shit after that happened because they for whatever reason had a stack of like 15k that they alched, interesting stuff
---
This is didn’t know...
---
yep
---
Most hype moment of my career so far.
---
Was iron zezima the mvp?
---
Wake up earlier
---
A zerker with 85str will most likely be a few combat levels above me, and has the exact same max hit as me assuming they bring a rune defender switch. If not it would be lower. 90 range would obviously be without void since we're assuming they have torso, b gloves and zerk helm so my 99range would still out DPS them.
---
I'm legit thinking of building a 2nd Ornate Pool atm bc I want to rotate the southern garden's pool to be closer to the nexus.
---
Amazing, thanks dude. I've been nervous to get into the harder parts of the game as I've spent all my time leveling and some questing, which has all been relatively simple!
---
going from positive weight to lower positive weight or 0 weight makes you run longer yes. graceful is not the only set that reduces weight, theres actually better items for weight reduction in the boot/glove/cape slot

nice

To get full exp, use the shades in [Mort'ton.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mort%27ton) The ones in the stronghold aren't really meant to be something to train on, they're just there to drop shade robes.

It wasn't that bad; had no right being called a skill though.
---
magic shortbows are never efficient to do anyways
---
Hold up, so there is no difference between 1kg to 20kg over weight? I just got my full graceful set yesterday. Both weights will make you lose the same amount of energy while running?
---
Yea, I was just half asleep and being a dumbass lol. Rebuild going strong though, have good friends.
---
what a idiot lmfaooooo im so dead rnow
---
Why are you acting like they do this on purpose to “trick” us. They want us to enjoy the game they’re not trying to intentionally piss us off
---
Then, I guess, it is just a system bug that can be changed only by custom ROMs in some cases, but probably not. Had the same problem with the phone, nothing much you can do about that. Maybe, someone somewhere on Samsung forums had same stuff generally.
---
If 4g has less of logging off randomly, use it for anything needed like hard quests bosses.
---
Yep it’s avernic, I’m just a noob so I don’t know what it looks like.

Dude I wish I knew lol, I was just making a joke about real events that I thought were silly
---
Yeah, damn monopoly. Gear farm meant to be right on tho
---
[Here's my 3x3 setup.](https://i.imgur.com/61glx0Y.png) You will have to rotate the gardens around so you enter your house 4 spaces from the ornate pool. I've moved my nexus portal room around and think it's best when it's next to the pool. This is just for efficient playing though.
---
If you plan on hosting you will want a gilded altar directly north of the entrance portal with a wall mounted glory in a room next to it. 2 rooms for the gilded lecterns, maybe a combat room for the max hit dummy?
---
Rip in peace

Very true, wasn’t paying attention. I’m a dumbass

Yep. Madder do ee

they will stop you and force change your name to something random and garbage and lock it for a year
---
Who said anything about blast furnace?
---
Most people I see using graceful at blast furnace afk at the bank, getting the graceful benefit.
---
It do be like that
---
That's a pretty good point. I guess I'm usually wondering whether something is due to difficulty from coding vs. lack of manpower/hierarchy of content.
---
It shouldn't just say "Humour", but also "PSA".
---
Well a level 3 isn't green so he is prolly like lvl 5, so thats why lol.
---
Like I said, they’re man children. Go look at the streamers who play this game, then imagine the people who watch that shit like it’s “television”. Anyways friend, have fun!
---
This is some enlightenedcentrism if I've ever seen it. One side is threatening violence against Mod West (top response to the tweet), the other side is saying 'We trust the JMods that they know what's good for this game'. And then you're here like 'Just as toxic'
---
I hate pking as well but once you enter the wilderness you do so on your own risk. Don't try to find logic among pkers, as Michael Caine so eloquently says in the Batman movie,  
---
# “...some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.”
---
where are you running with 28 rune bars other than BF. id recommend banking the bars if you want to run longer
---
how long did this take you?
---
Sorry dude but your words will fall on deaf ears to the r/2007scape "riot over a pride event" community
---
Blade is probably going to be buffed by making crystals add more charges to it and upping the number of charges it holds. Rapier will probably go down a bit and blade will go up a bit. Main reason it’s the way it is, is because the blade doesn’t hold many charges and runs out very quickly
---
Por Que no Los Dos. Barrows!
---
Both will probably just stay the same, unless they tweak the blade's mechanics. Blade will likely continue to decrease in price for a while.
---
They are not the same, rapier is a stab weapon which has more uses, and it doesn't need to be charged. Biggest problem with the blade is the charge, takes about 2-3 hours to charge it for what I believe is 100 minutes of use. Slash isn't that valuable, if they did something about the charges then I could see it going for 70m, but I doubt it will ever be over 100m for a stable amount of time
---
Wauw gz mate!! In my opinion on of the best pets in the game, i'm hunting him aswel, he looks so sick!
---
Gz mate, on wich kc did you get him if i may ask?
---
As others said, Rigour is super. However, you can liquidate the pegs if you need money for some other, non-ranged related activity. If you plan on staying with range, Rigour all the way.
---
I think it's a misconception that just because the skill has tiny Xp/hr rates that it's any slower than other skills. It requires a lot of effort yes, but that effort can be reduced with other skills.   
---
That being said I would like to see some Warding.
---
"i voted no to warding so it would be a shorted series" lmfaoo
---
Nostalgia. It's a big thing. And my theory is the same as yours, it's all these people have. Like that post of the guy sadly playing on his computer in 2019 thinking back to when he was happily playing on his computer in 2007, there is no other source of joy in these peoples' lives besides the nostalgia of runescape.
---
Thanks mate ^
---
Nah, the 100k+ who signed up for 2006scape didn't want pre-EoC, they wanted old RuneScape. That whole demographic would not be playing if they made pre-EoC servers instead.
---
People who want pre-EoC were playing right up until EoC. People like me quit way before that and just want old RuneScape.
---
I recently came back and that just sounds wonky. Guess I'll just have to try it out
---
lmao, neither of these things are true
---
I have a full colored graceful set and I'm 70 RIP
---
It is. Tob is the blades use case.
---
Why do you think that? Blade is BIS new slash weapon and is on rapiers level, also it's second best at TOB after scythe so i'm thinking people would want to sell rapier (which is almost double the blade price) and buy blade
---
scammed? you mean hacked?
---
I don't go out of my way to do them, but if you're logged in you might as well get the bstaves, ~10 seconds for a free 120k

Gz dude!! Still waiting on a unique drop from Zalcano
---
Is it bad if i do the ankous in the stronghold for slayer?
---
If your rig is laggin anything In runescape its probably time to upgrade from a toaster. To a decent microwave oven man.
---
just do blood/soul runes... you’ll get 99 in ~a week, depending on how much you play
---
Tongue trimming?
---
This would be far too game changing.
---
This is basically exactly how it works
---
That’s the same way with any game or time NOT spent working. It’s fun bro.
---
That's a bot..
---
Oh so they finally decided to stop the seasonal dmm? To try and fix it once and for all?
---
You should learn screenshots next
---
Ooh share this in r/banktabs
---
Why the fuck do almost 1k people have 200m cooking
---
Repost?
---
I largely avoid wildy slayer cause I’m a big chicken and don’t want to lose my shitty low level gear, but every now and then I feel crazy and get a wildy task.  Always a rush to get out there and complete it, especially ones around pk hotspots like rev caves.  Heart pounding time!
---
Can confirm this method is the best all round for afk vs xp. 
---
It's so afk, you can literally get like 1m XP a day doing nothing but checking you're still logged in every so often and banking every like 3 hours. 
---
Got 99 str on like a month old mobile-only acc and realised the rest of my stats were embarrassing lol.
---
Public: off
---
Already done :)
---
Imagine getting beaten up by a fucking kid called *spencer*
---
Can't wait for the next ep
---
Wow amazing dude. Real original huh? Seriously? This is your best? Pathetic pre school level humour? Fuck you and everyone that upvoted this low effort garbage.
---
Not in price!
---
We have all received this message one way or another.

Go spend ten minutes trying to find the 98

Varrock - 35

Lumby - 31

I was told that Black, and white, are strictly shades. I'll try to accept your input but nothing will get rid of that haunting memory
---
Against
---
Thanks. Just to expand onto it more. It could be thematically tied into the singing bowl where you show the blade to Reese and you get some lore about only a master smith could improve this blade add a 80-90 smithing requirement even. 
---
Not only would it make the blade more viable it would also encourage players to continue to grind the gauntlet to build up their shard stack and hunt for their own blade in the process. 
---
Beats the current meta of walking to the g.e and dropping 3m on a whip and kraken tentacle. It wouldn't devalue the rapier because the ability to use the blade is locked behind the quest and the sunk time required to obtain the 5k crystals to charge the blade.
---
It's a fine line, though.
---
For instance, that quest that was a Halloween event was awesome because it was a "bottle quest" and you didn't need to bring anything.
---
Quests in general require so much arbitrary shit, though.
---
Just as one example, I would have never thought to bring a pickaxe with me to elvarg's lair in DS2. That would have been one of many trips back to the bank.
---
The last person I saw at black salamanders kicked me to death for my spot 
---
I was 11 salamanders from 70 hunter for SOTE 
---
It was completely infuriating and genuinely hilarious at the same time
---
What kinda lobster are you eating? I live in a place where lobster fishing is a huge industry (Atlantic lobster) and the stores here sell them at $10 a pound, places across the country are paying $25 and up, restaurants charge $40-50 for a lobster meal. I’m not saying you’re wrong but is king crab worth as much as that? I’m asking out of curiosity, not being a dick.
---
How about you remove yourself from this subreddit?
---
Yes, please.  I'm all alone.  :(
---
Atleast a lot better compared to how they look now
---
This tab makes me so happy though
---
or just max ur poh
---
The loot doesnt need to be touched IMO. If the blade gets the above buff as proposed the gp/hr is fine for something that takes 10 minutes of your time on average with 0 cost to participate. It shouldnt reward players for failing IMO as it currently does i dont like the whole alchable participation trophy.
---
Can confirm the legitimacy of this I’m in a clan with him
---
Gay

Tldr?
---
I've had this happen twice I'm pretty sure
---
Why was 2006scape and similar servers blowing up then.. there was massive pre eoc servers that's playercounts were going down, not rising like crazy like all the "osrs" servers.
---
imagine actually getting triggered by what people type on the internet XD
---
What a weird development 
---
I’m looking forward to more of this weird shit

Not sure what you expected with that name

---
yikes
---
Yeah not accusing you, sorry if you thought I was
---
I think that would be great. Someone earlier mentioned how it takes 3 hrs to get it charged but it lasts only 90 mins in combat. Doesn't seem fair xD
---
Only for helmies
---
Nice find.
---
Oh nothing like that brother no worries
---
This almost sounds like a budget copy pasta
---
Disappointed. No one is here :(
---
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but perhaps more consistent drop tables are entering the game more frequently now is because it is more enjoyable to the average player?
---
Keeping something old school just because it's old-school is a dumb idea if the majority of people don't like it. Games are meant to be fun.
---
Clearly this game wasn't fun when it was all about the things you described and population numbers dropped to less than 20k concurrent.
---
Sometimes you have to accept you're in the minority and changes are going to be against what you want.
---
I had overloads and turmoil, but add that to having things like a yak made the game way too easy.
---
Yeah they were
---
Just curious, do you consider wintertodt pvm or skilling?
---
I like how the top comment is a gay joke but this joke gets downvoted
---
I have no idea, I was just talking shit lol
---
The fact that the blade is charged is an untradable resource is the main issue with it with it being a degradable weapon and a cap at 2500. Compare that to the tent whip, tridents, sang staff, scythe, and blowpipe, barrows. All of these require a purchasable charge item via (whips, scales, runes), or a cash repair fee (barrows). 
---
The items essentially require money to use which you will use to make more money and profit to pay for the upkeep. The blade however requires time to charge it thus making it less desirable
---
What paints did you use? :o to me that looks more pastel than paint but tbh it could be oil :') I'm clueless when it comes to paint types :P
---
bruh take ur candy ass n gtfo
---
Congratulations in accomplishing nothing
---
Okay cool, I didn’t know how that’d work out. Rough for the account, better hope some glitch happens that lets him train herblore (unless this is a 1-2 part shitpost, which is acceptable)
---
Wow you’re a funny cunt aren’t ya?
---
My advice would be slayer, great for do and cash later on plus you’re always working towards something!
---
pepople should stop linking to subreddits as comments shits dumb
---
I did 197 kc before the buff to the drop table, guess I should go back now.
---
being afk is wasted xp. you either scape or don't scape.
---
I mean, it’s also just fun as hell for everyone. It’s highly competitive and great for lazy fucks like me who don’t enjoy the running part of tennis.
---
Didn't account for the new skills and level cap increases, as xp levels now scale infinitely.
---
Do they have their own osrs servers or do they just use jagex servers with their client?
---
I said that if the blade continues to drop, then sure. Sorry you lack basic reading comprehension and long paragraphs (well, a few sentences) start to get confusing.
---
You can already do ~8-10 gauntlets an hour if you're not braindead. That's like 1.5m an hour guaranteed, probably quite a bit more once you count shard prices as well. If you think that's not better than GWD is currently as far as guaranteed loot goes, you should probably go revisit first grade math.
---
Maybe if you weren't actually retarded, the content that requires a brain for better gp/hr would actually seem better than content that doesn't require a brain.
---
Nope, SKL.
---
Same!

I don't see how you could get to 70 on rooftop courses without getting enough marks for graceful unless you miss most of them. I've got full coloured graceful at 76 agi and I did about 10 levels at werewolf

Dunno what the cape is

And the average damage the spec will do is 80. Minimum damage weapons are very dangerous territory in this game. The only one currently in the game is dragon claws, and its minimum is a 0,0,0,1.

Yes, location changes like this make recoveries pretty much impossible from my experience. Look into a VPN where you can get a private IP address, then use that to submit the recovery request. It's how I got my account back.

But do NOT use a public VPN, because it will not work.

It's almost as if the higher xp rates of black salamanders are balanced around being in a PvP area lol.
---
Oh wow, I didn't see that reply, I am on PC. Maybe it's because I'm not logged in to twitter? Threatening violence is never okay, that's terrible. 
---
Reading through the rest of the twitter replies not all of them seem to be mindlessly criticizing his work, manked for example said:
---
"Personally really dislike seeing items like d boots being changed like  this. It’s one of the main reasons I stopped playing pre eoc because of  all items looking completely different to how they did originally. I’m fine for a couple of items, but this will probs lead to more items"
---
to me that seems like a solid viewpoint, maybe not popular with reddit, but he provided feedback in a non-toxic constructive way. He would rather not old items have their looks changed and gave a reason for it.
---
In my opinion toxicity is wrong regardless if it's at devs or if it's at other people for simply having different opinions. Them threatening violence on twitter does push them over the edge though and so I see your point, it's not the same.
---
At 79 Slayer now, almost 80 for nechs, what's so good about them? Where/how do you usually kill them?
---
Eh I like it
---
Everyone is forgetting the amulet of glory. C'mon guys.
---
The Amulet of Glories and Burning Amulets have all charges as I sometimes PK them.
---
Yet here you are, expressing just how much you "don't care"

Have them in the POH.

Yeah the tick manip was insane, instantly mining 6-12 tephra as soon as mining starts, getting 2-4 damage ticks on DPS phase in populated worlds. It wasn’t fair at all lol.
---

---
thanks &lt;3

Oh my bad. I did 2246/12 and got 187 and mistakenly thought it was months
---
thank you &lt;3

Why do people always recommend Slayer rings so much? Where are you guys teleporting to so much that you want them? For catacombs I use a kourend teleport and for relekka I use the fairy ring right outside the cave. Those two things together cover almost every task. 
---
I suppose maybe if I get a gargoyle task I'd appreciate the 10 seconds saved to teleport to the tower instead of just using the Canafis fairy ring? Doesn't seem too worth it to me, I think blocking shit tasks should be a higher priority.
---
This is literally me fuckkkkk runecrafting lmao
---
Literally bro.
---
I always tell my friends that the wildy isn’t really scary if you just expect to die. Take a few good items that you protect, then some dhide for defense and just lose a few thousand gp if you die.
---
Make sure you always shit talk the pker when they attack you. ;)
---
It kind of does since it reduces the amount you're carrying thus allowing you to run a farther distance.
---
I see 13 types of teleport tab
---
If its taking up a good portion of your bank then that's a good indicator to sell it. If it drops your screwed and it doesn't seem like the type of item to be rising in price any time soon.
---
&gt;Back in my day,
---
thanks for putting this early in the comment, so i can know right away that the entire comment is worthless
---
You can barrage/burst them in Zeah catacombs for 90-150k XP/hr (depending on how much attention you pay, alts usage, etc) and still profit.
---
I do, yeah, do you think thats a bad call? Does it limit too much of the content? Ive been told its a good way to get into PKing by my friend who got me into the game. Im just working on my magic level before I do. I figure if I dont enjoy it, I can try to max after.
---
If you're already taking up a slot for the dramen staff, why not just carry a rune pouch with laws and combo runes? That way you can tele to several places, including your house.  That's what I do. 
---
Unless you're an ironman and can't get some of those items, in which case it might be useful
---
I love that wine so much. So cheap but so good.
---
You'd have to take that up with Jagex sir

All the power to ya for dressing in fashion, but farming has utility items you need to use (magic secs, farm/max cape, teleport jewelerry / capes). And using those + weight reduction to save a whole house trip to replenish is a massive time save over time with the amount of herb runs you do.
---
But again, play how you want. What's your go-to fashion for farm?
---
i use the g305 its amazing

This is getting milked for karma pretty good.  Seen this a couple times already.
---
DYEEEEEEEAAAHHHHHEEEEEUUUUUHHHHHH
---
Where?
---
Though tbh there isn't much else to wear while doing zmi, you bring a big hefty shield like a DFS, and your dust staff. Then with essence in inventory and that the weight reduction helps. As its a stamina potion activity it's not end of the world to fashionscape but some people don't really care about looking slightly different to others when half the people aren't even paying attention to their screen for zmi haha
---
Thats why I do it. If I am somewhere safe like at the GE or something I just walk away from my PC and do not even log out.
---
Even better yet is if I am WCing or fishing, I just wait until a new tree or fishing spot spawns, click it, then walk away. A little extra XP while im gone, idgaf ban me jamflex
---
thats suck
---
Forgot about that guy oh shit lol
---
What I do is mine until I'm interrupted (by falling rocks or w/e), even if it's only like 2 rocks. Smith and imbue them. Go back for another cycle while waiting for the blue circles. As soon as they pop up I stop what I'm doing and throw the rocks, and if I run out I just go back to mining/smithing/imbuing until the boss is down
---
Doing that gives you zero down time and seems to give the best loot. I get MVP sometimes even with 71 mining and a rune pick
---
70+ mil gone
---
Yep brews were the key for me. Couldnt do it with rays. Would always run out
---
It’s not possible to play RuneScape for less than 8 hours. That game is worse than heroin.
---
I read this as "[Suggestion] Kalphite task." That's all have a nice day.
---
6-7m for Chambers, 10-11m for Theatre
---
Not a single mimic kill chance ?
---
Mainly because there's not much point doing any other method after 77. Most do zmi up till 77, and then bloods till 99. Very few will go to double nats or double astrals because it's more effort, and the profit these days isn't even that great compared to far superior options for grinding gp.
---
Especially with bloods 77-99 making 150m these days at a relaxing 35k/hr
---
Just slay and you will have all the cash you will need
---
Those are two capes I really want next, but unfortunately I don't have as much time to play anymore to get that bank up and I got other things I need to get before those ._.
---
Not gonna lie this is a good idea.  Progressssionnnnn
---
I was expecting Chestbrah
---
Hey fuck you, don't be an asshole
---
This is just wrong. I'm at 91 and running anywhere is still aids.
---
Penance gloves are the only ones that are a bit weird and not many people obtain because they only do the minigame for torso and then LVL 5 roles for diary.
---
But boots of lightness are free, and spottier cape is merely a hunter requirement, just as graceful is merely an agility requirement. You have to grind to the low-mid 60s to get full graceful, same applies for hunter with spottier cape. And it's a faster skill.
---
Wear those two slots and you're golden for most skilling / general activities.

Yea but I'm not personally super crazy about efficiency, and lately my bank hasn't been getting any bigger because of the lack of time that I actually get to play, so until I get enough time to consistently play I'm trying to cut costs everywhere I can lol
---
time to bank stand at g.e world 302
---
Not nice
---
I can’t otherwise if I happen to PK someone with a odd number of charges like Amulet of Glory(2) or burning amulet(4) I wouldn’t be able to bank them.
---
I think its 4+1 which is 4 raiders and 1 alt for doing secondaries/dps. You can also have another person prescouting so the team doesn't have to wait around between raids

All fish are fucking disgusting. If you eat sea creatures you're literally a monster.
