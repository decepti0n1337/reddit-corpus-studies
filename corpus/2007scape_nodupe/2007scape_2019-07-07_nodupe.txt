Because they said they’d treat every partnership the same way
---
---
---
What's the big deal with waiting a few weeks for a skin color when it can bring in players to our game and help us grow?
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I see the argument with 'memebership not unlocking all content'. I honestly don't care for it as long as the content will be unlocked without me paying anything more than my membership
---
You could also alch with the diary ring while you're bursting
---
They’re able to do that because of MTX and supporter packs
---
No they aren't lol. D chain sat at 30m for a long time, my brother sold one on an online auction website in my country for $300, mills where $10 each.
---
I didnt know they still played Party rock anthem at middle school dances.
---
By that logic though, it doesn't matter what you vote. If they're going to do this against our wishes then your votes on a poll don't mean jack shit. If they ARE going to respect our answers then we're just shooting ourselves in the foot by bitching about the tolerable content.
---
Partnerships are happening regardless of what we vote. We just vote on what can come in via them. Vote no to everything and Jagex will just stop asking permission.
---
But with the way the servers have been this league...any newcomers are going to think that's the norm and hate it
---
I've done over 100 kc, it's easy to find a free world.
---
Good suggestion and I like the detail of the colour scheme matching clues
---
Bonds are already worth exactly what they're meant to be. Hell, they went up a full 1.2m on osrs to account for less people buying them. And they're still not in short supply. Jagex makes money hand over fist. They tried to make esports happen. Don't let them fool you into thinking they're a tiny little backwater online game company. They don't need any more money, they'll keep trying though. Go play rs3 for a year and tell me you don't feel largely incentivized to spent money on mtx, due to how treasure hunter rewards are manipulated.
---
They all kind of are considering war, pestilence and famine are all different forms of death in environment or something.
---
I think we're talking past each other.  I think the former, what you're talking about, would be something more related to a command economy/ reminiscent of the Soviets, while what I'm talking about is a sort of syndicalism, or labor managed firm.  A company managed by its employees, not by the government, though these both do fall under the broad umbrella of "socialism".
---
The thing is players won’t actually quit you just think they will because you’re dramatic
---
osrs was literally made because this is what happened. history repeats itself.  they even changed their rules from the last game (rs3), they started small then snowballed into the shit show RS3/EoC is called. once the higher ups put their boots on their throats for more money they're going to say fuck it and do it.
---
omg i scrolled up looking for people humping for like 30seconds before realizing haaaaaaaaaa
---
Thats fair enough I guess. I played for a few years and never felt super pushed to buy things other than premium. I got like 5 T10s and felt it was good enough.
---
Granted I do have something like 12 prem tanks. A few were free event things but I did pay for most of it. I was fairly young when I was seriously playing so its entirely possible I didn't notice and just opened my wallet.
---

Thank me later
---
Wait so it’s faster to spam click? Fuck
---
every few months I feel the same and quit. but I'm always back eventually lol. I've made more progress on my current account than any other account i've ever had so it's hard to leave permanantly
---
You've milked it long enough fella, it's time to stop
---
Well it actually isn't 'free' since they'd have to be lucky and already have the membership that Runescape is doing the partnership with, or go out of their way and buy it. 
---
You do make a good point though I wouldn't want players that care about free promotions to flood the game, but osrs being the game it is I doubt someone who goes for mtx  would get very far in the game unless they buy bonds
---
whats the story behind this green pixel stuff?
---
Nah its just more of a psychological thing that you have a harder time telling people of different races apart because they usually have different distinctive features than your race. White people typically identify other people based off of their nose and eyes, so that's why some have a hard time finding differences in Asians
---
Just do it man, the rewards feel so good
---
That rune Warhammer looks really bright so I assume it isn't a rune Warhammer?
---
Yes? I have no desire to replay the same game I just finished yesterday? Games tend to get really samey after 10-20 hours of gameplay
---
Sounds a lot more like you're willing to overpay even more for a game that takes next to nothing to run, and would be making jagex a landslide profit even at $10 a player.
---
I agree, just relating facts.
---
I did a ton of castle wars pre eco and I maybe got 120 tickets total?
---
No one is quitting over a skin color change or a house design, you reddit nerds are so dramatic
---
Get real
---
[removed]
---
Nice
---
jojo...
---
just google it
---
oh sorry i thought you were slermz mackenzie
---
From a business standpoint (the people you are talking to) you obviously aren't overpaying if you keep paying for it.
---
If they saw this, which I doubt, they will scoff at your message.
---
 I totally agree, as long as they do it right it we could get some dope shit
---
To be fair, POE is PVE mostly solo game and the game is properly designed around cosmetic MTX to be positive for the game. Where as RS, is absolutely not designed for that gamestyle. Love both games in their own special way.
---
There is a difference between stupid cosmetics in RS3 vs OSRS. In OSRS you will see these things exclusively in social hangout spots where as in RS3 they are persistent everywhere on everyone. This photo is immersion breaking as well, just not in the same way as if everyone was going into combat wearing this.
---
A partnership. We're voting yes to stuff we don't actually know anything about. And yeah, there's noway to know ahead of time, but that's why it's just a bad idea
---
You mean the players that can buy bonds and sell it in the GE and do the best xp methods? We already crossed that bridge long ago. 
---
Let's  be honest. For someone to go out of their way to buy memberships with other companies to unlock house themes (that no one usually sees expect the player himself) and skin colors (which sits underneath your armor anyways) when they will unlock it all the same by waiting a few weeks or so sounds entirely farfetched. 
---
Yeah I'm satisfied with the player count too. But if we don't find new younger players our playerbase will only decrease.
---
Lmao bro I'm so high and didnt even realise. Yeah based on him, futurama 😅😂
---
Didn't downvote you, but thanks for shooting me anyways. Wow is $20 a month, and loaded to the brim with mtx, and has the most rapidly declining fanbase of any mmo. They too are tired of bring money gouged for worthless bullshit, when they already have empirical evidence showing the most dev time goes into store mounts in place of actual raid tier rewards, armours, etc. 
---
Wow is currently in the same state that rs3 was at the release of eoc, and are paying the price for it every patch. Until the finance dept of any company is banned from game dev meetings, we have to stay on our toes. Also, look how much more wow players get for that nearly $20 a month.
---
You could just not play the game tho.
---
whats fun about dchain though? there so many cool items and people still play for fun not making a pretty easy to get drop worth like 10 mil doesnt mean ppl dont have fun lol.
---
I really doubt partnerships as proposed are going to accomplish that goal. But you have valid points.
---
Maybe you should read the entire paragraph of things you're voting on?
---
Also not a pro pvmer, but tryharding the caves I have my pb at 34:22 and almost never go above 38. 
---
I also literally run around the caves with stams and safe spot nothing though.
---
Uh, no, I've been switching worlds and the boss is still being campred
---
Bad idea from a business stand point, but I'd personally love it.
---
This community sucks? Why because you lost your shit and we are supposed to feel bad for you. Reeeeeee
---
Would it be okay if i got this tattooed on my body?? I love it bro!
---
Did you at least wear deodorant?
---
they literally turned the entire game off for a full day to fix the tbow bug. and they banned boat loads of people.
---
what exactly is 'game breaking' to you?????????????
---
Well I haven't actually started killing the boss. Been waiting for it to clear out a bit first. :p
---
My point was if you re read the post that they're disappointed with themselves not the players. All you really have to do is read the post without your victim cap on.
---
I love you
---
Yes yaks are still decent for training but sand crabs/ ammonite crabs are much more afk. Also you could just train your combats while training slayer. Always the preferred method.
---
Your* semantics
---
Lolololol
---
I Enjoyed it. It was worth it - but its not the same devcost as 40 hours of single player game is the point I was making
---
About three years ago there was a comment asked by another user for a "minigame master cape" much like the current quest and achievement diary capes. It was mentioned that Mod John C was looking into it. since he's no longer with the OS team. Could such a cape of accomplishment idea be looked back into?
---
Have you played SMM2 and SSBU online? They’re fucking garbage. 
---
&gt;Frequent game breaking bugs
---
I’ve been playing since 2005 and OSRS since the beginning and mot once has a bug been poorly handled by jagex. They always without fail deploy a fix within a day and ban those that benefitted from the bug abuse.
---
&gt;make the game worth $132/year.
---
For a subscription based game the real value of a game imo depends on how much people are willing to pay for it. The playerbase is higher than ever and OSRS subscriptions are making more money than RS3 entirely. I’d say membership is quite fairly priced.
---
Nvm, that was a hasty assessment. This community has some nice ppl in it. 
---
You on the other hand...
---
Yeah, sorry. I'll be sure to consult you next time before cleaning up my post so it reads better. Didn't change out calling you a parrot, and in fact I added another insult for you.
---
\&gt;Much lower xp rates
---
So RS2 was the real EasyScape all along? /s
---
I never downvoted you, I didn't see your reply until after the edit.  I don't downvote people for disagreeing with me.  And I do have a counter.
---
I don't buy the slippery slope argument.  Yeah its just my opinion but I don't buy it in this case.  In the poll blog, I thought the OSRS team was extremely aware how it would look like the start of the end and they tried their best to address those concerns.  They were very explicit about making sure they would only use rewards we were okay with, and reaffirmed their commitment to keep true MTX, game content you can't get without paying for, out of OSRS.  
---
Could they have been lying and would we see them break their promise in 2020?  Maybe so.  But they could force it on us any time they want.  Everyone knows how well that would go.  Jagex could yank the poll system whenever they want.  So I don't find it helpful to base my judgements on what might happen, because anything could happen.  I based my judgement on what was offered at face value.  And I thought about half of it was reasonable.  And I thought it might offer some real benefit to the game.  
---
Now, in a different universe where this poll passes lets say I was wrong, Jagex goes down the slope.  Well at the point they start inserting true MTX, my sub is gone.  If Jagex wants to ruin the game, they will.  A failed poll won't stop them.  So I don't buy the slippery slope or what ifs, I judged based on "what happens right now if this passes"
---
~50$ if you VPN and pay in Mexican currency.
---
Jagex can suck a fat cock for what they’ve been doing lately so I’m happy to pay them as little as possible.
---
Well, generally, debating on the effect of adding micro-transactions to a game is pointless as you wouldn't know what would truly happen when doing it. Of course, that's only generally. In this situation, we know what would happen as it has happened before. We watched the game we loved get destroyed by greed. The reason that we, the OSRS community, are so adamant about fighting for a micro-transaction free game is because we've witnessed what it will do firsthand.
---
It's ultimate parent is a Dutch company Wolters kluwer
---
Nah
---
Actually it's AT&amp;T you fucking nerd
---
This is a question we can't answer.  Not without access to industry data and analytics.
---
Damn man this is amazing! I would be very interested in checking out more of your work as well (doesn't have to be osrs related)! Do you have a portfolio IG or anything?
---
As much as OSRS is hammered for being "too simple," when I watch videos of people Spec Switching, Prayer flicking, and Vengeance baiting throughout the game, it's a work of art.
---
BUT GOOGLE BROUGHT ME HERE
---
Yah
---
How long did it take you? Just curious may try myself..
---
Shit this brought me back!!
---
Pls speak for yourself. I'm hopelessly addicted to OSRS - as long as they don't pull an EOC on us (this is what they want).
---
Pog
---
Tried, it was removed lol
---
Yea I don't know if it would be good for them in the long run but I am just imagining if this game was released like minecraft with all the different fan servers and player mods.
---
Another private server will pop up that was just like 06scape.
---
I was cleaned 'cause of the duel arena (lost 8.6b) so I had to rebuild.
---
What I decided to do was make an alt while I maxed my main account. I finished up 99 rc which got me about 30m or so from soul runes. I used that 30m to invest into my alt. I grinded it up to barrows gloves, got it some gear and trained slayer until gargoyles. 
---
I ended up doing 25k gargoyle kc (you can see my tab here: https://i.imgur.com/zMdTqLn.png)
---
I decided to stop doing gargs 'cause I heard about brutal black dragons being significantly better (and they were). Did about 2k kc there (tab here: https://i.imgur.com/HIx3mSb.png). Good thing about doing this was that I bought my dhcb for about 53m then it shot up to like 100 during it so I made even more.
---
From here I decided to quest a bit more and do DS2 to unlock rune drags. Rune dragons are THE best AFK money making that are commonly done by people in the HLC (high level community) on alts. You can make 1.5-2m/hr here. From the previous grinds I had enough money to buy myself the gear to do these well (used hasta as this was before the lance was in game). Again did a little over 2k kc there but I don't have a tab of just that loot.
---
I was putting a lot of attention into the account so I thought why not go to Vorkath? Ended up getting 91-99 range there over 4.5k kc (I have a tab of my rune drags + 3k kc at Vorkath here: https://i.imgur.com/ddui9G8.png). 
---
At this point I had like just over 700m total. Ended up selling the tab 'cause ToB was gonna be released the next day so I wanted to buy gear. Didn't end up getting a team so felt like a waste and ended up just going back to Vorkath on my alt for another 1.5k kc.
---
Eventually I did end up doing ToB more and from all that initial grinding, I have now got nearly 1.5k ToB kc making 14-15m/hr total over my time there. That's how you can afford these things.
---
It's not quick but you can make so much more money once you have money.
---
Overpaying is paying more than it’s worth.  You’d buy stuff that have more value than cost to you.  If you think the value is more than its worth, you can overpay and still buy it.
---
Ie) a watch is worth (has an MSRP of) $100 but I really want it and am willing to pay $250.  I can’t find it anywhere except a pawn shop for $200.  I’m still paying twice it’s worth but getting value so i will overpay.
---
Thought you said Pog at first, full ? from me hahahaha
---
Definitely going to happen as they are already clearly hinting at more areas that exist in Zeah that we can't go to yet. You can see a bridge leading off the map south of Mount Quidamortem (Raids 1). South of there is apparently a place called Valamore and we already have some people from Valamore in game we can talk to in and outside Kourend Castle.
---
As a stingy person who will regularly wait to get a better price, this analogy is lost on me.
---
I don't see time gated mtx as "just as bad", especially for pure cosmetic items we get to vote on.  It's apples and oranges.
---
Would be cool if these proposed cosmetics came from some sort of mechanism where you got a drop from a monster, then had to solve puzzles and eventually get a reward chest.  The reward chest could have different tiered rewards, with the most sought after rewards being the rarest

Gz!! Log in on mobile and try out the free week of membership if you havent already.

When is song of the elves coming out
---
I also not really know how to Reddit and I only have mobile so if this is breaking a rule or something please Mods just delete this and shame me back into lurking.
---
They've tried that. Nearly every major release they have attempted to make has failed. They even had the rights to make a Transformers game at one time.
---
H
---
No
---
I can’t stop you bud, an if you like it that much who am I to say no? 😜
---
My dude, addiction or not, this game is never gonna be worth $11 a month or any of the other bullshit they pull.
---
Thank you. I was just way to excited that I didn’t even think to check!
---
Hopefully you realize that if we let them add any form of MTX, a lot more MTX is to come
---
You got this
---
Ayy thanks man! Took me a while to save for it but it’s worth it.
---
It’s called fashion.... look it up!
---
 H
---
fair enough
---
== is equivalent, do ya mean !=   ?
---
Next try to sell him some of your "gamer girl bath water"
---
I hope all of the houses at least get slight touch-ups. Even if some of them are okay as is, Hosidius is far and away the best one now and I'd love if all the others were brought up to the same level of quality. I'm a big fan of Zeah as is but it has the potential to be so much better.
---
They could come up with another way to afford it. It’s a pretty small expense for such a massive company, and seeing how successful they are in business, they ought to have a few more ideas.
---
I make enough money to afford the money I spend on the game.  I’m just saying as someone with a job, volunteer group, an outdoor club, and is active in other games, the $22 per month is steep for me.  I’d pay it than limit my already limited play time, and I have enough fun to pay it, but I’m saying it is very steep, especially considering how little you get for it.
---
Do you have a source? I couldn't find exactly when the shortcut was added. Just a picture that shows lava dragon isle map without the shortcut, so the shortcut came after march 13th 2014 (rejuvenating the wilderness update).
---
Wildy diary was released on march 5th 2015 and has ["Shortcut to lava dragon isle"](http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,131,65529393) listed on the rewards
---
It's possible it was added somewhere between the two updates, but I couldn't find any mention
---
Maybe jagex should partner with pornhub.
---
Naked character models coming up
---
Stick with d'hide and a Neitiznot if you have it, melee gear before 70 defense doesn't really matter anyway. Would not recommend void unless you plan on keeping your prayer up 24/7 which is going to dig into your profit quite a bit
---
They should still allow us to make it smaller; it feels too big even on iPad
---
quit
---
Let me guess.. you have western province hard done and 70+ Agility...
---
I have clan mates that have literally sold their bank to afford just a dhcb and said it was absolutely worth it.  I like to hoard sets of gear myself so I have it when I need it.  If you're able to let go of the bank to get one item, and grind gp to grind the bank back... it might be worth it.
---
If you wanna get real sweaty you can alch between teles too
---
I mean true but there’s also xerics talisman, Minecart travel, fairy rings, kharedsts book, and a couple other teleports that give the place just as much accessibility as the main land.
---
Have any ex-jmods actually commented on the issue yet?
---
Imagine grinding to save $1.80 an hour
---
mory elite fishing req is absolute torture
---
I literally cannot believe this.
---
👌
---
Honestly the amount of time I play it could cost $100 a month and still have a better dollar to hour ratio than any other game I’ve played.
---
Every person I played with, and most major guilds that I was involved with had the largest player base quit for two major events, one being free trade being removed from the game, the other being EOC. Now again, hive mind effect can follow, but Jagex almost bankrupted its company twice from both of these events, so there doesn't really need to be a poll to confirm the reason.
---
I quit from both of those things, I returned after free trade came back, and I quit again after EOC released. I returned for OSRS.
---

They don't leave them.  They ban 100k+ bot accounts every week, and then more take their place because creating new accounts is trivial and also easily automated.
---
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind. Which is Part 5 of JJBA. You should probably sit through the first four parts before watching this.

Reddit gold pls
---
Damn, both of them?
---
You're still going to have to spend at least some time actually participating in the skill, as you level it.
---
You could have infinite money, but you'll still have to run to unnote your bones, and then go back to the gilded altar.
---
You are right though that it diminishes value, it's a strong argument for getting rid of bonds.
---
I got u fam. Have one of mine.
---
I don't feel like it's p2w as bad as people say. You get 1 hours worth of Vorkath on a character, so what? You still need to do the skilling. You can buy 1-99 prayer using bonds, but it still takes tens of hours to max. You can buy 1-99 construction, but you still have to put in up to 100 hours to do it. You could even buy all the stuff needed to complete every quest - but you won't complete those quests until you grind the stats and do the quests.
---
People like to freak out over bonds, but quite frankly I think bonds are fine because it keeps a lot of people playing who might not otherwise. I'm not the only person who thinks membership price increases suck and  bonds are a great way to keep playing.
---
You guys are both dumb for playing children's games
---
Tbh, no idea on the cape rack. Never looked into it
---
If all you're doing in osrs is making numbers go up then you're missing out on a lot of good content.
---
I don’t care about sustaining my bond as long as I get at least 1 day to train
---
It's not the least fun thing when anything near end-game makes a bond in 1-3 hours.
---
Yeah it's a different model to OSRS. With £75+ quid per year from every paying member you'd expect at least a functioning fucking customer service.
---
life
---
Not saying any of this as a argument of any kind, but I think a one-time purchase of anywhere under 60 dollars(typical price of a newly released game), to have a very solid setup to "fully" enjoy PoE is pretty fair. At least when being compared to Runescape's monthly subscription of $11/mo, $132/yr, per osrs account.
---
Goodbye
---
Home teleport reskins that are just different books is a great idea. Shit like the cow home teleport is fucking dumb but at the same time it's kind of grown on me. I don't think I want to see more cosmetic content like that one though.
---
Don't quote me on this but I believe Mod West said Arceuus and Lovakengj were the next ones in his sights for reworks, so we might see those sometime in the next year or so.
---
I believe you’re able to switch membership off of accounts if you have good a reason. People meme about customer support but regarding irl money their support is perfectly fine.
---
Income tax already exists lol
---
Spam click allotments learned at 98.
---
I've probably put more money into PoE than any other non subscription based game. And I still feel like I've gotten way more than my value out of it.
---
Youre probably right on that 1 my dude
---
🦀 🦀 🦀 Chinese overlords won't reply to this 🦀 🦀 🦀
---
I feel like most games MTX's are typically related to cosmetics, and Jagex was pretty clear they are wanting MTX's for cosmetics, not to further easyscape progression such as buying exp, or buying in-game advantages.
---
I would agree with you about EOC. It would be a great system in many games, but why would you change a 12 year old game to a whole new combat system that nobody even got to test or comment about?
---
You've already had insane luck
---
Can we have the old Soul Altar colouring for the map? The current one is an eye sore and actually makes it hard to tell where the path is just looking at the map.
---
11$ a month isn't that much imo, that is equal to a game every few months up to every 6 months. Which isn't a crazy thing either. Just looking at how much people around me spend on food ( luxury food ) is making up for the 11$ easily.
---
exactly lmfao. it's basically a non-issue. not to mention all these gambling bots are LITERALLY dressed exactly the same fucking way, all spamming the same thing pretty much.
---
it's almost an insult to us that this is an actual problem.
---
c
---
This is a repost from earlier today lol
---
This game from the early 2000s where anyone can just take your account if they decide to costs more than Netflix for the whole goddamn family.
---
I mean I spent $7 on CSGO and i put 1600 hours into it. You could say all of that was grinding because it's the same 7 maps but I wouldn't, because each match was a brand new experience and every time it was exciting from start to finish.
---
What'd you take so much damage from? I first timed Jad recently and only really took damage when I got bad spawns and couldn't safespot everything. Things like when one mage, one archer and one melee would spawn, and I had to safespot the melee, pray the mage and tank the archer. But even situations like that, I only took maybe 15 damage in total before killing the archer.
---
I feel like they should be able to detect the obvious pattern of these bots?
---
Didn't have a tbow, but lost a couple hundred mil a couple weeks back, somehow my authenticator got removed without jagex sending me any email about it, subsequently my bank pin was also removed.  
---
I love OSRS but their customer support system is garbage.
---
You can't get 99 all stats by buying bonds. That's a far bigger weight than buying bis using bonds. Not to mention buying bis with bonds requires you to be filthy rich. T-bow aint cheap. Other stuff aint cheap either, combined. As someone else said it's thousands of dollars.
---
IMO bonds are good. Buying gp from jagex puts money into OSRS. Buying gp from a 3rd party seller does not. It will happen either way. Everyone forgets that you can;t buy your grind. Well I suppose you could, but you might get banned for botting or paying a venezuelen to grind agility :)
---
And you can get banned for things you've actually never done. All your work gone with no one to plead your case to. Why can I not speak to a real person immediately when hours and hours of work gets taken from me? 
---
I was so excited to come back to this game. Played back in 2005/6/7. Middle school sleepovers were all about RuneScape. Being able to jump back into, what was for all intents and purposes, the exact same game: such an awesome experience for me. I decided (after finishing dragon slayer and banking some cash) to go Member for the first time in years last week. 
---
I fell for a scam. Logged into a mirrored forum of the official RuneScape website. I couldnt log back in for the next 5-6 hours. I submitted an account recovery ticket immediately, and hoped for the best. I guess my authenticator saved me, cause when I tried to log in again that night I had access! None of my stuff was gone, all my money in the bank. (I had set a PIN earlier, it had not gone into effect yet.) Needless to say I was excited. 
---
I decided I was gonna train for a while that night as a celebration, I picked thieving to grind out. Wanted to try using OSBuddy for the first time, didnt know what it was all about. After about 5 levels with OSBuddy, and reading some posts here about it, I decided to go back to the official client. I didnt want to risk losing my account for the usage even though Jagex had said they wouldnt ban anyone for it. 
---
The next day, I grinded out some agility. Probably spent more time clicking the same pattern on the screen than I ever had playing runescpape. I made it from level 10-39, and on literally my last lap before levelling up to 40 (so I could finally get to that new agility course!) I got kicked out again. Thought it was a hiccup so I tried to log back in. Some kind of message, saying check account status.

Im banned for Macroing. Non-appealable. What the fuck? I've never cheated in this game, and I wouldnt even know where to get a bot let alone how to implement it. It took me posting here and tweeting at Jagex support to find a link to appeal the ban. Still havent heard from them. I want nothing more than to be playing right now, but im playing Hearthstone and seething instead. 
---
Im truly dissapointed that I paid for a membership, that Jagex has already collected on, that I got to use 3 days of before getting permanently banned for something Ive never done. Im truly saddened that the most nostalgic video game experience of my life has been taken from me. Im deeply confused why I wouldnt be given the opportunity to explain how much I love this game as is and why I wouldnt implement 3rd party software to cheapen the experience. 
---
Goddamn I want my account back.
---
TLDR: you wont believe me, but thats ok. I know im not a cheater and I fucking earned those levels. I think Jagex's customer support is broken too. Thanks for posting this OP.

 He pays fortnite, don't worry, I didn't take his words to heart, though i appreciate you and your clear display of empathy. Folks like him will never understand struggle &amp; I don't blame him. He assumed that my debt was only 2k, and assumed it could be paid off within 2 months with an entry level job, this just shows me he's still likely living with his parents and never had to deal with the reality of paying bills. He'll grow up one day &amp; perhaps, if we're lucky, have a better outlook on life.
---
Going through all this really may signal something internally for you.
---
Okay? Jagged held the same position when it came to RS3, until they didn’t. 
---
It all started with a cosmetic “promotion” with Google Chrome. 
---
This is a slippery slope Jagex has slid down before.
---
Not to mention, the servers are light enough to run on a single Raspberry Pi on a 100M internet connection. 2k cap private server worlds have done this.

Your dream loadout is 12 mill?
---
It’s simply because the materials to make it are easy to acquire. Same thing would happen to the equivalent tier of melee/mage armor if the materials were as easy to get. It drops 100% from mobs that have very lucrative drop tables, so a ton of it comes into the game. The quivalent mage and melee sets are not craftable and are rare drops.
---
I dont know what you mean by this statement?
---
If I play say, 100 hours of Runescape in a month, then its less than a $ per hour.
---
I never state anything about any specific value I got? I just said that 132$ a year was a good deal for how much time I could spend on it if I played for a consecutive year (I play Runescape on and off)

Supporter packs would be cool in osrs, I'd pay for a membership + merch pack, maybe a list of names somewhere hidden in the game like a random bookshelf, add a forum border or something, idk
---
Not if you're buying bonds from their website. If you do buy them off the GE then it actually takes gold out of the game. Bonds not only help the economy but take it away from gold sellers. People can call it MTX all they want, it's still a healthy addition to the game that doesn't push towards a P2W playstyle

The Ardougne achievement diary is a good one to get out of the way early for an infinite teleport to the monastery just south of the city, which will be good for getting around early on. This can also be useful as it puts you fairly close to both a fairy ring and a spirit tree, once you have unlocked those. 
---
It also has some okay bonuses for an easy to obtain, early game cape.
---
From memory you need 15 Fishing, 5 Thieving, and to do Biohazard and Plague City (both relatively easy quests) plus Rune Mysteries.
---
There's literally multiple people who have said here in these threads that they came back because of the Twitch prime deal and stayed. You also got a month of gametime.
---
Basically, they need to leave all their advertising promotions to membership deals. I think that’s fair, and they can still increase profit.
---
I'd rather them add an option to pay for an instance room rather than non instance only if it doesnt die down to the point I dont get crashed every 2-3 runs
---
That content isn't dead though. It's the same gameplay as modern WoW questing and leveling. People do it while leveling and it does what it is supposed to do the way it is supposed to. How is that dead? Not to mention it just got a huge revamp in the form of level scaling, changing up how and where you level. it was made less braindead as well by being properly scaled for the hp/damage creep that had gone untouched since Cataclysm.
---
Runescape 2 came out 16 years ago or roundabout. Scimitars are still the best weapon class until higher level options become available. Every other class is varying degrees of unused and worse. We have skilling content that is universally ignored by everyone. We have lots of areas of the game that go unvisited except for people doing a quest or clue.
---
The leveling content in WoW is akin to the content we use to level up skills. It's not dead, even if it's not the most useful. Make attack potions, sell them to make back some change. Level up your character by going through zones you won't visit again on that character.
---
I just now thought of achievements, mounts, battle pets, and transmog/gold farming as well. All these things keep old content relevent to various players in WoW. What keeps content relevent in OSRS that you've outleveled? Nothing unless it is overpowered. WoW has hundreds of hours of side content in older xpacs that keep them relevent to tens of thousands of players if not more. OSRS offers miniscule amounts of low level area content relevent to high level players. What content does do this is limited to money makers like herb patches, the equivalent to gold farming an old raid.
---
WoW previous xpac level zones and raids/dungeons are the furthest from dead content they've been since Mists of Pandaria. There is so much shit to do even at high level you could fill your week with it ignoring the new xpac entirely and still not run out of stuff. All combined, it's more content to do than the current xpac.

If you really wanna do this go for it. But understand it is a better way to lose money than gain it. 600k an hour, while possible, is if you went into the wild, killed green dragons non-stop and never got pk'd.
---
Needless to say that is a bit of a dream, realistically you will need to bank every few kills (no need for a looting bag, staying in the wild that long is a really bad idea for your stats)
---
I will always advise people who dont know much about what they are doing to never step foot in the wild with anything on them or in their inventory they dont want to drop at the GE. So 27 dragon bones is pretty high on that list when you are hurting for money already.

With browser based gaming not being anywhere near as popular as it was back in the days of miniclip, to ensure any sort of success most of the games would surely have to be developed for android/iOS.
---
I'm guessing Jagex isn't willing to do this.
---
The staff would be specifically for this boss though.
---
"ignores magic defence of spiders"
---
This is why I buy bonds with RWTed GP
---
You can do Waterfall Quest prior to Wintertodt as it doesn't require any actual combat (just be careful of aggressive monsters!), so you shouldn't gain hp xp which is what affects things at Wintertodt. This may be helpful as it will save an inventory space by letting you wield your axe for chopping roots.

The absolute worst offense you can get from buying gold is a 2 week ban. Emily bought gold a few years ago with absolute proof and even admitted it iirc and only got a two week ban. Subreddit went mildly crazy about it for a few days.

I'd rather pay a few hundreds of gp instead of grinding to 80 agility

Could you imagine playing Arcansist or Armies on iOS or even Android? Hell, they could MTX the crap out of either one and people would still play it. It would be fantastic.
---
The boss was purposely made to be a melee only boss. Do I need to go and quote the blog?
---
&gt; if it is free eventually it's not a paywall
---
&gt;There literally is no wall you have to pay to get past to access the content, you just have to wait
---
This is an understandable, but misguided perception of the economics here. For your statements to be true, time must be an unlimited resource for the customer. The paywall exists, monetary or otherwise; It is one of two things: (time spent waiting) OR ($x). The user chooses one option based on the value they assign to the content in question as it relates to how long they would need to wait for it, as well as depreciation of the content's value as time goes on (cosmetics undoubtedly make their greatest impression and carry the most weight upon introduction before leveling out and becoming "standard" gear. The only way to stand out with brand new gear becomes paying extra).
---
While that is true. You've always been able to buy gold anyway. And it's still alot cheaper to buy gold from gold sites. It's kinda like the benefits outweigh the negatives because it directly supports jagex.
---
Also I disagree with it being pay to win. Noone pks in top tier gear most of the time and the difference between alot of high price gear and low price is so small it barely makes a difference. I mean technically yes you get a very slight advantage. But the better player will always win, no matter your gear. If a dude in black d hide goes against a dude in full armadyl. The black d hide dude can still win if he's the better player. Pay to win usually means you pay for a huge advantage on someone. But with rs the better player will still win.
---
Dark Beasts don't mage when you're in melee range of them, there is no difference.

This is great and all but its still fucking terrible.  Everything is twice as big as it needs to be.  The bank in port piscallarus is bigger than an entire screen in normal camera mode.  Same for every building in the Shayzien area.  And theres no actual content in either, lol.  I just maxed favor in both today without seeing a single other player.  Its honestly really sad what a failure the whole continent is but people just forget it because muh farming guild, catacombs, and raids.
---
Your trying to give content to a mid level boss.. that’s like giving obor a drop that has a chance of making it a t70 crush weapon that’s bis at vetion. Doesn’t make sense.
---
I feel ya, i lost my acc with alot of work and progress and never heard back from the appeal, that was almost 1 year ago. Needless to say that i quitted, but im still in the reddit for the memes and info in general
---
Good meme
---
REE
---
You're beyond braindead mate lmfao.
---
I disagree with the premise of this post.
---
You're comparing apples to oranges here, also if you were to compare them you get way more out of OSRS than you do with 2 nintendo games a year and their "online services" even though they don't use servers they use peer to peer bullshit (atleast for mm2, correct me if i'm wrong). This is the only mmo on the market without garbage MTX or upfront fees beyond the sub. OSRS has more relevant content than any MMO on the market. I'll agree that the customer support is mediocre and could definitely needs an upgrade. Your post insinuates that 11$ a month for this game is a massive waste of money in its current state, its not.
---
Yeah, I just quit when I logged on my pure to give me brother some dosh for membership. I have no idea how, but I was cleaned out. 
---
Had every single security feature put in place besides a bank pin (my fault, being lazy) and I still have no idea how it could of happened aside from using OSBUDDY a year ago.
---
Idk what to say. I love the community, I love the content creators but seeing how this game is changing so rapidly as far as MTX is concerned, I’m finally breaking the addiction.
---
Fucking A.
---
Disclaimer: I did vote no.
---
Would you agree that the statements in the poll were too broad than? If the poll had given a guaranteed time frame, such as the time of the promotion to the time of full release, would that had improved the likelihood of it passing? For me that was the main issue. The questions were too broad, and they tried to cram it in without warning during a holiday week. 
---
They've mistaken in game polls as feedback machines, when that's not their intended purpose. The in-game polls should be the final or midway point after an idea has been hashed out. Not the green light for them to start working on something. 
---
It seems they, as a team not individually,  think they are communicating with the player base at eye level when in reality they just happen to meet eye to eye with certain player sects at certain crossroads. Nothing is 100%, but my conclusion is that this poll was actually a reflection of their ability to communicate with each other, badly, and not accounting for the differences in their point of view... the last bit was a spiel to myself, lol. So just the first part if you even feel like it.
---
Thanks!
---
Hi, I came from r/all but you can have my axe, dear sir!
---
It's not like you wouldn't be grinding for money anyway, the bond is "just" a 4,2m gp drain every 14 days, so it's hard to start out, but once your account gets momentum you can sustain that just with Barrows runs, so it's not too inaccessible. Once you get Morytania hard diaries done and get some decent gear for barrows, you can sustain your membership without spending any irl money (which is much harder to get than gp), while keeping a good chunk of it to upgrade your gear and move on to a better money making activity, like Zulrah or GWD. Even if you have little time to play OSRS, you can make 4,2m in a week of intense barrows runs, and the other half of the membership goes to worthwhile investments. Once Barrows isn't enough to afford better gear you'll already be paying for the Bonds and doing something better. Learning how to flip is also really useful for making money on the side, though personally I'm really bad at it.
---
&gt; Excluded from its original launch

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
As long as it's a setting that could be toggled on/off. Personally wouldn't want it when I'm playing on PC, but definitely would want it for mobile.
---
It is! I'm not complaining about drop rates in this game again when I run a little dry on barrows from now on :)
---
Ah yes in a game with a shit ton of bosses, quests, diaries, skills to train, and much much more the incentive for people to try the game is MTX. Why haven't we tried that before? If only there was a game that has a shit ton of MTX that makes it so you dont even need to play the game anymore. Damn if you ever find a game like that let me know because I would guess its booming with new players
---
It is statistically impossible for every single RS3 player to only be playing because of addiction.
---
Where can I find resources for UIM? Things like communities, guides, CCs, Discords, etc? I’m aware of the YTers like Settled/Link/Verf/DVS/Mudkip but I can’t seem to find much else.

Wait, is Mechscape/Stellar Dawn STILL a thing? I thought they shelfed that YEARS ago since it never released.
---
Like 90% of the game????
---
Like, yeah, sure. There's annoying amounts of time spent on mtx bullshit. There's also a fuckload more content, and levelling rstes aren't gated down to 30-50k an hour max at anything below level 90 because snobby players don't like the game getting even slightly better. Like, it's just patently more enjoyable. Your time accomplishes things. A whole day on osrs seldom yields more than 400k fishing xp, which is a massive yikes. Mtx isn't that bad, just not necessary. Ignoring them is the best way to play.
---
Oh it still is but its just thinking about what you're going to do beforehand during and after. Not like the days of old where you just right click and waited
---
Parks and rec is too normie for osrs imo :(
---
Got them at 120cb with 0 issues 🦀
---
IMO I don't think a promotion to play our game with whatever sponsor and get a red skin is going to attract anyone either. I don't know the correct way to go about that, but none of the proposed cosmetics would get me interested in a game anymore than an ad would.
---
As someone who has been playing for 13+ years, maybe it is just time we rip the bandaid off and just hang our skill capes up for good. Lets be honest Jagex has pulled this stunts once and we know they’ll do it again. None of us can really grind like we could as kids because we are all adults now. Maybe it’s time we just come to closure with the game and let Jagex sink for being the absolute bastards they are.
---
I remember buying "wins" at the duel arena for 35% less than market value, making 1m+ an hr.

This image is now missing the doc and for those that do not look up the solution will have a darn near impossible time solving this clue due to it not matching up to what is there.

They don't combat RWT...  They are RWT. You just flood Jagex with RWT profit instead of some broke 3rd world country gold farmer trying to survive.
---
Me and a friend are trying to earn enough gold for bonds. Our current plan is mining gold in the crafting guild mines, are there any better options for us to choose?
---
I've found RL always stutters when I do demonic gorillas.. not sure if it's due to the constant switches.. not sure if that relates to your issue
---
Oh I didn’t know that. My bad then!
---
Making it worth more takes so much work since you have to basically scale back all sources of black dhide. Not saying you are wrong though it should be worth more or harder to make. Just the game wasn't designed like that from the start so it's pretty fucked up already and easier to adjust the stats.
---
First things first - make passwords case sensitive. It is extremely insulting that customers get blamed for getting hacked but you don't put the effort in to secure our information.
---
I'm in! Thanks boi
---
Why would a content dev have any say on advertising? It's quite literally not their business.
---
I'm not sure what you're confused about. You literally just activate your VPN and go about your regular activities, it's fairly straightforward
---
I started when it was $5 a month, which is obviously $60 per year, with no discount for buying multiple months. I thought that was high. I quit for awhile and lost the grandfathered pricing status. I tried to play again, but between the steep price, the unfriendly pricing strategies, and especially the loot boxes that killed the fun in the game, it was simply not the same. It’s a game. It should be fun.
---
For a lot of players it's twice the amount too. Anyone that has a main and an ironman, or a pure, or a skilling alt. That's realistically $264 a year for one player.
---
Do he got big bone? He do.

THat's 3 coins you didnt' have before
---
Lol but they don't even have to announce a pet drop nobody should be expecting it from a mid content boss anyway, it's just nice we got one.
---
I wish Jagex would just release the bosses and only show us the equipable uniques, let the pet drop be a discovery in its own. There were literally jmods on this subreddit going around reminding people the boss would have a pet drop, so of course people were going to camp it in droves.
---
ahh.. I see haha, I hope you get some counteractive luck yourself!
---
You must be a special type of retarded
---
Not like anyone even uses the official forums
---
Aw, man. I remember back in like, 2005-2007 I'd spend hours reading posts in the forums. Some people would spend more time in the forums than in-game.
---
Imagine buying bonds with gold you make in game when you can illegally buy gold and then buy bonds for each.
---
i warped to draynor to fish for a herring just to warp back to varrock to have charlie give me the leather cowl
---
They aren’t though. It’s a way to pay for membership. It values membership in GP. That’s different than RWT. RWT promotes botting and hacking of accounts of real players. Bonds promote the game by making it possible for you to purchase membership by playing the game. Your logic is twisted.
---
just leave RS already and join up to a serious f2p RvR team pvp game like Champions of Regnum. There is still crafting and grinding of your choice, but the rest of it is enjoying fun RvR combat, soaking up the alpine, sunny plains or desert landscapes and generally being chill in chat.
---
You can also buy some items to highalch for the same amount. Back then I did amethyst javelin heads because I broke even with the money I spent on that plus runes but you would have to check market prices! 
---
Its a very repetitive task but at least you don’t lose money on runes.
---
i think you misunderstand the MTX situation
---
No pretty accurate, it's a buisness first and foremost
---
Book of law with dds? Smh whale
---
AH yeah I shouldn't have said 'dev team' rather osrs team
---
This is a pretty recent feature though.
---
Mod MMG admitted 40-50% of players purchase gold every month in 2013.
---
None of that is really getting good, raids, inferno, everything is all just memory, not really skill. Justicar makes the inferno tons easier, CoX is honestly a joke to learn, and ToB takes a while but is ultimately limited by the fact that finding teams is hard.
---
Definitely the coal bag since your goal is money making.
---
Because he lives in a sewer
---
Just want to add: I got downvoted two days ago for saying the boss will be soloable in a few days. Anyone who stumbles upon this post I want you to go check the boss out.
---
Because it's fucking empty and I was right.
---
But you have to add why we're limiting it.
---
"To be completely clear about this - everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that **we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape**."
---
You have to add the fact that the entire company and even the CEO is  against MTX, and we still choose to limit the player base because of the slippery slope argument of mtx.
---
I believe the two week mobile trial automatically signs you up for a recurring membership that you have to cancel not to be billed after two weeks

Rob Schneider is - a carrot!
---
I love it &lt;3 and the anatomy is perfect, you have a lot of talent keep it up!
---
If ppl would stop using the. then they'd go away real fast.
---
It's not that the game is addicting, it's that the game is niche. When you have a niche game with people that are passionate about it, you can get away with charging more for it, and that's not a bad thing.
---
The issue is they're trying to play capitalism with a game that doesn't support it. Sure we love autistic nostalgia, but we're only willing to go so far.
---
Every CEO that touches this game seems to want to go full capitalism. If you do a little stalking and watch their speeches you'll be shocked how out of touch they are with the product they have in hands.
---
I'm not an economist, I'm just parroting out pieces of things I've heard that seem to fit in the recent happenings, but I'd love to hear from someone that speaks capitalism to hear his thoughts on the matter
---
be completely clear about this - everyone at Jagex, including the CEO himself, is in agreement that we will not add any MTX to Old School RuneScape. 
---
I guess this flew right through everyone’s ears?
---
At the end of the privet servers life they started to get good. Not complete, slayer was minimal and few quests, but i think if they fucked it up again some people would be dedicated on making a better version. Only reason the RSPS scene went away was because any player willing to go out of their way to play on a private server would rater pay the membership cost and just play actual osrs.

All jokes aside, catfish alts are easily the most profitable alt in the game, I have no clue why ehp nerds dont make these (other than the fact that they might not have the social skills needed to play them)

Can jagex detect that you switched to Mexico and lock you out for security reasons? I sure want to try it. Would it be too risky for a high level account?

F2P money making *sucks*. A lot. I'd recommend getting the first one or two months by paying and only then maintaining it through gp.

Personally I think some pray pots and lobsters should make it easy enough for a baby to do it, I guess I thought you were trying to make him feel bad because deep down I think he deserves to feel bad for being so terrible at the game.

It's a completely semantic argument. We don't know how the game is coded, so we can't say that any given items that share a drop rate or have similar drop rates are on the same table, so it's easy shorthand to assume that everything with the same drop rate is on the same table.
---
An item that's 1/128 is probably not on the same table as one that's 1/100, but it's very possible that an item that's 3/128 *is* on that table. Whether or not there's an *actual* table with both items on it is irrelevant, because it doesn't affect the drop rates.

WE PAY WE GAY!
---
Not really, dont know who that is. Saw his community reccomended, seemed scummy.
---
Okay boot boy
---
the dude has 130 strength! how could they not invite him!
---
You think that the game is so expensive because they're struggling for money? No, it's because they charge to optimise profit, if people will pay it then they'll charge it.
---
Isnt bonds mtx tho?
---
Name checks out
---
Jagex wants MTX? I say its Pesos2Win
---
https://twitter.com/WooxSolo/status/741040811907948544/photo/1
---
Got it from this, though it is admittedly pretty old. Has something changed?
---
Imo it's perfectly reasonable to think Jagex will take MTX to the extreme. Partnerships and their cosmetics don't mean Treasure Hunter is right around the corner. But after you see the extremes Jagex has gone to with MTX on RS3, I think it's entirely reasonable to fear any amount of MTX. Jagex worded the bonds poll in a manipulative way. The gist of it was "Do yall want f2p... also we want to add bonds". Jagex hasn't ever won my trust back when it comes to things like this. The Partnerships blog, even if you think it was worded fairly, still had a lot of unknowns about it. Again, In my opinion, I don't think it was hashed out deeply enough for me to understand whats in store with it. Seeing the RS3 precedent, the deceptive ways, and the vague partnership blog post is enough for me to vote no. They can still add "MTX" in a similar fashion as the partnerships, but hash it out more, and give us concrete wording. Then maybe I'll vote yes.
---
If we vote yes and bad MTX happens, Everyone gets hurt. If we vote no and we lose potential players, then it's not really an actualized lost.
---
Agreed. I have 3 accounts that i wanna play regularly. I have a main, a nmz alt, and an account i wannna do qp cape at 85cb with. Due to this i mostly just play on my main..
---
Trying to get a dragon defender for the first time and I'm wondering how long it takes on average to get it. (Including the time it takes playing the minigames to earn warrior guild tokens)

They should also remember that WoW Classic is coming really soon, and people will be more than happy to jump ship  
---
Plenty of nostalgia/grindy mmo games to play
---
&gt; Because most people that multi log use multiple accounts, and if you  didn’t have the choose multi log most people would choose having two  accounts instead. 
---
Okay so what's the issue? People who want to multi-log can make multiple accounts as they always have done, people who want multiple characters but don't care about multi-logging can have more than one character slot, again not that much of a problem.
---
&gt; Gpu renderings isn’t some insanely hard thing to do, if it proves  beneficial they would have done it already as it’s a fairly simple thing  to do. 
---
I'm not going to pretend I know how to code but I imagine the issue isn't that it's hard to do so much as the team has development priority on different tasks, for example they halted it for development of mobile.

They already do use one for intergrated graphics chips on mobile and they have in fact been testing the GPU renderer for years.

The problem is, in a MMO like this it's impossible for the game not to be P2W, so we can't really blame them. If they didn't have bonds, there would just be more players buying gold from bot farmers, scammers and other types of shady players that hurt the game by buying illegal gold, and the game would still be P2W because players are just getting the gold somewhere else for real life money.
---
With bonds at least bot farmers and such get less customers so there's less of those types of players ruining the game, and Jagex sees more of that money those players were getting.
---
JoJo's Bizzare Adventure.  Worth watching every season.  Season 1 is the weakest out of them, but its still good.  The series just gets better and better though.
---
Apologies if these questions have been asked before but I have just a couple.
---
First off, when training ranged (not cannoning or chinning), is it better exp to use a magic shortbow imbued, or to use a crossbow with an offhand?
---
My other question is when is it better exp for ranged, magic, and melee to use void knight gear as opposed to high strength gear for melee, and higher accuracy gear for magic and ranged?
---
That is true, that is what I like about bonds. I feel it's nice that f2p players can work towards something. However, there is a big difference between paying membership and paying for bonds, one just unlocks more content for the game which makes the company money, the bonds do the same but also allow for people to buy in game currency.
---
$30k/year? No fucking way
---
And the increased influx of bonds would drive the cost of bonds down, then increasing the $/M per bond
---
That Honda Civic is more reliable than that Lamborghini plus Lamborghini’s breakdown and cost you the cost of another Honda.
---
Not everyone is American
---
I like how because we voted no to all their shit they're not going to do any of that content, at all. Meanwhile, a lot of us probably would like a lot of the themed stuff they proposed, just not through MTX. Just shows how spiteful and pissed they are. Their passive aggressive community post just drools with what their ulterior motives were behind everything. And you make damn sure they're gonna do it again, and if the day comes where they just force it into the game it will truly be the beginning of the end.
---
Gold sites don't sell gold as a quest. They sell gold for profit. They have margins they shoot for. If those margins become close to nothing, no more gold farm as it is not worth their time. In addition, based on my research they'd have to drop it to nearly half of what OSRS chooses to do in order to attract a customer. Most people wont break rules and risk their account to save .10 cents per mil.
---
E
---
Same. This post woke me up, no joke.
---
I am saying have those bonds be hardlocked at a price in the GE (as in they can't be adjusted from 6m to buy a bond, up or down)
---
Where is the legal issue. Where is this unethical. It's just global economics at its finest.
---
Bro I’m 50 attack, 90 str, 99 magic and range at 72 combat
---
Yeah, but maybe you dont have the agility lvl to be agile enough to "land" so to speak.  A 200gp moneysink for a once in awhile clue step is not going to make any dent in gp whereas adding it as a diary/agility reward actually feels rewarding in order to have access to a shortcut.  Dont want MTX, but want shortcuts to be easy instead of involving the skill(agility) that is dedicated to shortcuts.
---
I'd rather have 5% of players participating in RWT than 30% of players buying bonds, but that's just me
---
Thank you for this post. Making me realize how much I'm over paying. I'm cancelling my membership now. You actually woke me up, thank you for this.
---
In my opinion I don't want any reskin for gear or abilities. One of the things I dislike in RS3 is that you can't tell what someone has equipped at s glance because everything is reskinned. I feel like it's a step toward that
---
I worked for an engineering firm that had 24 employees and a yearly profit of ~20M but consistently made our jobs harder to save pennies till it became unbearable and half of us left, they then replaced us with semi-skilled workers at about 60% of the pay. 
---
Some people are so money crazy they don't even think about the negative effects it'll have on the business, it's money now they want not growth or sustainability. 
---
They now make a fraction of the money and went from being one of the top 3 for quality, quick turnover production to blacklisted by my current employer who happily tells our clients to never use them unless they want a headache and shit quality.
---
But hey, they got me a forklift license I've used a lot since and paid me more than fairly so I can't complain about my time there.
---
I mis-read. My apologies haha. As said though, farmers will just undercut by a few cents and be atop again.
---
We aren't 10 anymore
---
"Shouldnt be too hard for them to do" - People who know little to nothing about making something.
---
wanna trade moms?
---
Or people can just stop buying gold from the farmers? Ban the people who buy gold from any other source.
---
These gold sites don’t have margins to meet because they’re literally expensing little to nothing to keep the bots rolling. The only expenses they have are internet and power. Which they pay the bills for in probably 4 hours or less already. Trust me, these sites would continue to sell gold because they’ll still make profit doing literally nothing.
---
Don't bother with any minigame besides the armor animating one, should take you 3-4 hours. Just remember to show your defenders to the women outside the room after each one or the next tier won't drop
---
Do you not pvp? I hardly see how pvp in an mmo differs from the skills needed in any of those games. Reaction time, precise control of character, superior strategy/execution, ability to read you opponent, etc? Isnt this what you refer to as being skillful lol. I feel like your afraid to call apples apples. =P
---
it's an easy change that makes the starting area much more presentable for all parties, new players included. the splashers were a real eyesore imo, i'm glad they're gone too.
---
Doesn't matter what he pays, every new account pays 132 a year
---
Absolutely no idea how you came to that conclusion /s
---
I just replied with something like this, but actually gold farmers won't farm gold if the profits aren't there. I've been doing some research and talking to some buddies that know people who run gold selling sites. The reason gold selling works is because they get customers, and they make profit. jagex can cut into those profits MASSIVELY if they increase the gold worth of their bond to constantly be within the range of a gold farmer. In addition this drives customers back to Jagex bond shop.
---
Just got 60 agility for DS2. Are there any notable milestones at 70 or below? Trying to decide if I should keep training for a bit or move on to more DS2 reqs.
---
I can't even laugh at that. That's just sad.
---
Also gold farmers used to sell for about 85 cents per mil.
---
Check out the [Optimal Quest Guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide). Quests are a great way to explore, unlock content, and get some nice early xp.

Jesus ive been saying $11/month is too much and everyone just shat on me
---
Tf you think a continent is?

Definitely do some quests and get your range up. You could farm green dragons for a few hours to recup some money. Remember on osrs, if it sounds too good to be true, it is.

---
But it looks like he kinda got himself messed up in the proccess. Noodling refers to catfishing.
---
That literally never happens. Too hard to detect and one misstep in this category completely destroys the community trust for jagex competence
---
even stuff like mutagens? all the "reskins" we have so far, it's still obvious what the original thing that's being reskinned is. we're not talking full cosmetic slot overrides here.
---
Not sure what SOL means but you're never guaranteed your name unless by special means, like the aforementioned. 
---
Higher priority names such as ones with few letters or that are very unique will be more at risk to sniping so it depends what name you have/ attempting to transfer. There is *never* a guarantee.
---
Unless you talked to a JMod potentially to discuss the issue, it would still be pretty unlikely that they would give you that luxury
---

They're running almost complete rips of the original content up to the week. I'd say this depends on the private server, but I'd say these servers lean toward the side of "lightweight" considering they were first created to run on Pentium III Xeon-powered servers...
---
At one point in time, a Mil was a couple dollars. It's was a combination of the economy and competition that brought it down and then the bond came in and it became a triad of reasons the prices went down.
---
&gt;  I quit between 2011-2016 and frankly those were some of the greatest years of my life
---
Why would that not make you stop playing right now?
---
Copying my other comment:
---
Generally yes, however if there are two independent rolls and you only roll the first one but not second one, I somewhat understand you're not happy. For example, if for some reason you really want a sapphire drop from rdt but get a diamond instead, it makes sense to think you were close to getting the sapphire. Because you managed to roll the rdt in the first place. Anyway, this post is about that this exact logic does not apply to ranger boots.
---
It's a similar concept like being abused as a child and then wondering why the child hates you after X amount of time.
---
It'd be nice if Jagex just fessed up with being wrong and move forward together with the Community.
---
What's the drop rate on that?
---
2/3 is halfway
---
See this is what led me to play Ironman. All I was doing was grinding vorkath all day every day to be able to afford a piece of gear or a prayer that would...let me grind vorkath more. But this time, kills would be a few seconds shorter. I hated every minute of it so I gave Ironman a shot and havnt looked back.
---
I left  years ago, wanted to go back, found it was weird and "new" and had to pay to play, didn't even think about it. I haven't played since like 2004. Wish I could go back for nostalgia's sake, but it seems the game's gone to shit.
---
Big oof. it looks like you are f2p, there isn't many options that are free tbh. You can kill ogresses for decent money, but that'll require a few quests.
---
Who is getting 20-30kc an hour at vorkath with a blowpipe?
---
Bonds are always paid with real money, people can sell them in-game to effectively RWT money to gp.
---
lmao clever one
---
What you might need is a therapist, osrs won’t help you process your issues, just stack them up and delay them. And no therapists aren’t for ‘crazy people’.
---
You can do almost every task with ranged no problem, save the maging for nechryael/dust devils tasks and burst them
---
Kinda specific but if you're getting stats up for Wintertodt, do tithe farm when you can. It's very click intensive but you will fly through the early levels doing it, when you'll struggle to get seeds to train conventionally otherwise. 
---
I would also try to unlock seaweed farming ASAP and start doing it. I started doing it even casually as soon as I could and by the time I thought about doing the glory grind, I had the seaweed to do it. It's also worth probably making glass orbs rather than lenses to 75, it's not a significant experience loss but will provide you with all the orbs you need for the following tip
---
Getting Varrock hard diary is way easier than most other hard diaries and unlocks 60 battlestaves a day, which if you have the runes to make orbs, will profit you 120k a day which is a very nice way to get cash early game. One session of grinding out Cosmics and then orbs will last you for a long while, at least long enough to get you a decent cash stack. It's not a daily you should feel bound to do but is worth doing to get your cash stack up for a little while, and will always be available there if you run out of cash.
---
It’s $6 increase for me.
---
New armor usually has different stats.  Like Barrows armor is much better than rune or dragon and requires 70 def.  Having better stats allows you to kill better monsters.  
---
Honestly, just grind slayer.  I'm not sure why you hate it, but its something that really needs to be done if you like to PvM which it sound like you are trying to get into.

I've spent a lot too, not the point.
---
Bonds for sure enable people to buy gold who wouldn't have otherwise. I'd say more people in total are buying gold through bonds than 3rd party websites, but the people buying through 3rd party websites are buying larger sums of gold.
---
Thank you
---
I had a lot of respect for them for honoring the results of the poll, and then immediately loss that respect and then some with their condescending tone in their post about how we the players are somehow in the wrong for voicing our opinion which they asked us to do with the polls? 
---
I’ve lost so much respect for JMods.
---
I know right? I'm so glad she made this.
---
I think also polling so many cosmetics all at once raised a ton of red flags, at least having a poll with only cosmetics on it was a mistake.
---
Why don't you blame jagex for deciding to not make this an instanced boss at the last minute instead of players just playing new content? Just because they're maxed killing a boss intended for 100 combat players doesnt mean they don't have a right to try it out.
---
This is literally all on jagex.
---
The "I don't actually know how to fish." part fucking killed me. Legend.
---
I stuck around for the longest time purely because I didn’t want to leave behind my account I had worked so hard for. A few of my mates eventually about 8 months ago convinced me to give OSRS a go and I haven’t looked back since.
---
Made me lol
---
Well... Rs3 developed into a very nice game. The combat with abilities is very smooth and they did keep it unique.
---
It doesn't.
---
I can pay $3.2 for 4mil gold and buy a bond.
---
Bonds are $6.39 for me, as I'm using euros and that's 5.69Eur for me.
---
Needless to say, I run a bot farm and bonds are free for me, thanks.
---

Its about the same as a zammy hasta, they have the same offensive stats except hasta has 5 more strength with is at best 1 more max hit. I was just done with a raid and just came for the music track, but its a betyer setup than the others in the pic, as well as most setups except scythe&gt;bludgeon&gt;hasta
---
It is pounds sterling not dollars. £30k. Still pretty low.
---
I always liked the "magical" far off areas of runescape hard to distinguish on the map though. Troll mountains and the big ice bit for DT for instance.
---
Adds a bit of mystery from early on- I'd actually love it if they made the map a little *more* "confusing" in some places for that effect.
---
Oh that does make more sense than d'hide.. But would Pkers ever wear trimmed black?
---
I know I’m late to this thread but fuck it I can’t sleep and have a few things to say. Our current account security  and customer support system are fucked and I don’t have much else to say on that other than they have promised improvements on both fronts so let’s see what they propose before we get the pitchforks. 
---
I’m not a fan of MTX in general, and certainly don’t want them in osrs. With that being said, I can’t help but feel the response from this sub over the past few days has been overdramatic to say the least.
---
Let’s take a look at what was actually proposed in the poll blog. Cosmetic upgrades to POH, locked behind a paywall for some time, then later accessible to everyone. 
---
**That is not pay to win. That does not hurt game integrity.**
---
If anyone has an argument for different colors and textures in your POH being “PaY tO wIn,” Id love to hear it. But I won’t, because such an argument does not exist.
---
I understand slippery slope argument, no need to explain it to me. Once we see the introduction of the partnership program, even if purely cosmetic at first, we’d be at a greater risk of seeing actual MTX that **do** affect game integrity some time down the line. 
---
The problem with this is that Jagex has clearly stated multiple times that any and all future aspects of the partnership program, would also need to pass a poll. 
---
Even if the partnership program is introduced, years go by and it becomes normalized and accepted by the player base, a MTX that affects xp rates or otherwise impacts game integrity, will **never** pass a poll.
---
Maybe I have to much faith in this community, and I can understand not wanting to take that risk, which is why I voted no on the polls. 
---
But the top posts on this sub recently are making this seem like the end of days. I’m already seeing dozens of comments from people across various threads basically saying “MTX are coming, game will he dead soon, cancel your membership and sell your gold and accounts while they’re still worth something.” 
---
At first I suspected no one is that stupid and that these are just trolls who want karma on reddit, but I’ve seen enough of these comments to where I’m seriously puzzled and thinking some people must really believe this idea and I just simply can’t understand their thinking.
---
Dunno where I’m going with this really but just wanted to be a voice of reason in an otherwise unreasonable hivemind.  
---

---
My account got hacked and used to farm gold. Jagex banned my account (which was old, high level, and with RL money invested in it) and then wouldn't talk to me when I reached out to try and have it reinstated. I haven't played runescape since

Jagex did over 600 million pounds in sales last fiscal year (Over 90m profited). An indie startup has better customer support than Jagex, there is no excuse at their level. Osrs is a game about grinding for something that is rewarding and mtx compromises that integrity. Take a look at rs3 and see how they're holding up after mtx.
---
YouTube 🙏🏻
---
Would have been preventable if Jagex wasn't so greedy and had an actual cap on how much you're allowed to spend. There is a cap but it's at like £1k or £4k and is only there to prevent credit card thiefs from *potentially* emptying someone's bank.
---
They are already known for that tho
---
Just, its "free"
---
On sample size of 1
---
Think they're just going for bankstanding looks here
---
I'm not saying every world, I'm not even saying most worlds. I'm saying just a few reserved for mid level players so they can experience the content on release.  That isn't punishing high level players at all and as a maxed player I don't find it discouraging at all and don't see how you could, you'd still have access to hunt it on almost every world and the mid lvls could compete amongst themselves in a few worlds.
---
It was still a *catastrophic* fuck up for those players, though. A fuck up that could happen in any other form and affect players other than HCIM.
---
Also you're contradicting yourself per your own words:
---
&gt; Usually when people say "game breaking bugs" they mean something along the lines of: I can't play the game ever again, **or my 100 hour save file is lost**, or the game is so bug ridden that it simply won't ever run on my system without crashing.
---
Beersprite told you this has happened and you brush it off because only a minority of players were affected by it. The problem is that *it happened* in the first place. 
---
&gt; Did anyone but those players cancel membership because of it? No.
---
So just because only a few people quit playing the game it isn't actually a problem or indicative of a bigger problem? That's like saying because only a couple of people quit working after they lost their finger due to a malfunctioning machine that the problem with the machine isn't worth mentioning or indicative of a greater problem. You know, because only a small amount of those affected stopped working.
---
Yes
---
Where do you live m8. How do you do deal with school and shit?

Out of the 4 original houses I always felt outside of the tiles in Arceuss it had the most "identity"
---
The city itself has a unique layout with terrain that causes you to remember the area- especially the whole Dark Altar/ path to wintertodt/ Zeah RC areas. Love those.
---
If the houses could be made less fuck huge and the transitions to the city a bit more distinct (I liked the idea of adding some sort of forest) I'd like that more.
---
On the other hand, Lovakengj is hot dogshit, and Shayzien is a nightmare and needs work asap
---
That's just how OSRS is though, for me its that gem of a game that I pick up once a year and play the shit out of it on my free time for a few weeks, then quit and log in once in a while to do random shit, and repeat
---
OSB and RL approach GPU mode in different ways so it’s possible that this approach just isn’t compatible with RL.
---
Definitely a good alternative, I mean most other platforms have some sort of advertising throughout tournaments
---
2 years ago
---
This relationship is mostly based on the fact that they fucked Rs3, and i took us the playerbase to convince them to even intruduce osrs. 
---
So any update thats resembles previous updates from Rs3 is met with high criticism.
---
If only 2.2k total worlds were like that.
---
Yeah, good point, you never actually state that it would be easy, just not hard for them to do, so you can understand where I make my assumption from :P
---
I'm P2P.
---
I think there are some points worth making. Firstly, even if you say this isn't aimed at the OSRS team, they are going to still read and still be hurt by it. That is the nature of having such a passionate team.
---
Secondly, I don't agree with the idea of OSRS being poor value. When compared with other activities the amount of hours entertainment people get from OSRS is huge. You can easily spend a whole year's subscription going to the cinema 6 times or 2 nights out at a pub. In fact it is inline with Netflix, Nowtv and Amazon Video.
---
However, that is not to say some things shouldn't be improved.

---
This is just ignorant. They have already said that the HD graphics engine will never happen. It’d take a full game rework. In addition I’ll let you in on a not secret, Jagex made a 58,000,000$ profit off of runescape in 2018. Does their staff of maybe 40 between both RS3 and OSRS get paid that much? In addition this is a UK based company not a US one so your pay scale is off. MTX would ruin the game and you’re ignorant because you did 0 research before throwing around silly opinions 🤷🏻‍♂️

&gt;Whether or not there's an actual table with both items on it is irrelevant, because it doesn't affect the drop rates. Probability doesn't have "close" when the output is binary.
---
Probably does have close if there are multiple rolls though. If you hit the boots table (if there was one), you were at one point a 1/4 roll away from getting rangers boots. That's what people are talking about when they're saying close. If the odds are 1/1000 and a first roll makes those odds 1/4, you're very close to getting one. A lot closer than not making the first roll.

I never said you said any of that. I was clarifying the point being made, because you stated “You need to play better games” if the person you were responding to gets tired of games after 20 hours; when some games aren’t built to be played for 20 hours.
---
I wasn’t making any statement against you or your stance. Just clarifying the point being made above that comment.
---
How disappointed you were with the cups in the kitchen's cupboard*
---
Would've been such an interesting story if this was the case.
---
Nice try, but you added the word typical there. That implies that partnerships may be mtx, but they're not typically the manifestation. And that s what most people are arguing here, if you bother to listen. These changes, as you said, certainly are NOT typical mtx. But, Jagex literally has a history of doing exactly this to open a door to more direct mtx. It's so simple, if you get something slightly in the gray area in, then you can get something a little more gray, and a little more until you're in full blown mtx. It just takes time, look at RS3. They have very very slowly, over years and years implemented new ways to suck extra money out of those people.
---
Most old schoolers will not risk their game to these sleazy tactics, with inecxact wording and slight deceptions. Hell, I got tricked into voting yes because I thought by partnerships they meant you partner up with an NPC to build your house. It was not until I read about it that I realized what they had done. I never thought old school would go back on their word and try to implement something so similar to what Jagex did to RS3. People are not mad because they don't want to see pepsi logos on shields in FTP. People are mad because Jagex is trying to decieve us, and they have I'll informed and too trusting people supporting them.
---
That's not the game's fault. Sorry that that happened.

Most of the dice bots and giveaway scammers are highjacked accounts, wouldn't really help.

The bond is paid for with real life gold because whoever buys the bond with real money and sells it to you is paying for the membership. The membership can't be free for bonds. It still has to be paid for by someone in real money. When someone buys a bond they are buying someone else's membership, which can be exchanged for gold, items, or nothing at all. Bonds are bought with real money and gifted left and right

That’s me :^) I haven’t played in 5 years. Before that, played for a year on and off and again left when the original OSRS changed to EOC.

Why are people continously submitting throwback photos to this unpolled political event several times per year?

Cha-ching

People tend to like when companies keep a consistent line of principle, by for example *polling* in-game content. Suddenly the jmods decided to completely circumvent that promise, hence the outrage.

Thanks DS2 isn't that far off, I will chip away at that and the mage's book asap, I can afford some of the other stuff with gold right now.
---
100% had the same thoughts recently, PVM being the biggest money maker, from producing items for PVM enables more PVM and devaluation of these items, it would be really interesting if PVM drops were more widespread in use, but it’s difficult to come up with skilling items that don’t just lead to the production of new resources, bottomless bucket is a great example of skilling items done right, perhaps some house cosmetics (not even memeing on the MTX), or some other rewards like rare endless teleports
---
I'm curious why do you think that lovakengj is so bad? 
---
Sure arceuus certainly has identity. But the colors are way too bright and vibrant, and don't mesh with the surrounding sandy beaches and woodlands. The old version was more muted, and i think it looks better than the current color scheme.
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

Seriously, the support team is a joke. I got my account hacked and my money stolen. The one reply I got basically told me “well... you didn’t have any security measures in place, so it’s your fault.” Fine, even though I already had a bank PIN. So I changed my password, and set up 2FA. I got hacked again. This time they stole my money and full rune. I reported it, and heard absolutely nothing back about it. I left the game for quite a while. I figured if they weren’t going to help me, I’m not spending money on it. I did eventually come back and so far I’ve been lucky 🤞🏻. But the fact that I pay $11 a month and they refuse to help with stuff like that is pathetic. If you don’t want to help, you don’t deserve my money.
---
Wow instantly what a huge difference the Bastion Potion makes without any other changes, thanks a lot I had no idea that even existed or defense did that much.

The ostrich approach, the problems may be worse when you decide to pull out your head from the sand
---
The full story behind it isn't really that interesting but I decided that I wanted to make a gaming Shelf and put a bunch of memorabilia that I had lying around plus a few things I wanted to buy to display on a shelf and naturally I chose to get something from a huge chunk of my life (runescape) and I was really disappointed because I couldn't find anything shelf worthy from the store and I couldn't ever finish the Shelf so she took it upon herself to make one for me and I think it's a great addition.

Idk what he stated in that wall of text, but don't give away free stuff. Slippery slope, you may enable beggars/scammers.
---
On top of that, it’s already P2P. The majority of the game is hidden behind a paywall. That’s fine, but I think that’s already restricting enough.
---
runelite plugin
---
Why do you think it's for no reason though. It's not like they can see what you have in your inventory. Even if you are wearing nothing that just means they can take you down fairly easily. So in their mind it's like hey lemme kill this guy and take whatever he has. No loss and a small chance at gains.

Alching is pointless unless you're an Ironman

It's just unnecessary and i think it says a lot about a person if you can sit and laugh at a creature in pain as if it's some kind of joke. The irony is these same people would throw a bitch fit if it was someone abusing a pet.

Well something needs to be done by the players, not just jamflex. This has to have community involvement and even when I was playing oldschool this has always been a problem so unless something different is done, it will always be this way. Goodluck scaper

See yourself out of this sub please
---
I feel we need more utility (Bottomless bucket) / item combination drops (Kraken tentacle/ DHL).
---
You could have multiple uses for each item, for example, a boss that drops item A, which can be used on its own, but could be used with item b/c/d (obtained elsewhere) to create x/y/z. Each item having its own benefits for use in either a particular skill or PVP/PVM. 
---
The new spider boss drops the sack of eggs, you take the eggs out (skulking resource), maybe give the ability to combine the sack with a rune pouch, once you’ve collected enough you could combine them all together and have a massive rune pouch that hold say 5-10 more essence that using the current 4, whilst freeing up invent space.

I probably haven’t explained this in the best way but I’m sure you can get the idea.

As a somewhat rare item, the dragon chainbody only retains value as a fashionscape item these days as it has an iconic/unique look, and pairs well with a lot of other useful dragon equipment.

Lova is just SO huge and empty. Did we really need "Mining/ smithing faction... DWARVES AGAIN!"
---
Houses have enough space between them to fit villages, the setting just kind of looks like the wilderness except there's nothing to do in any of it.
---
I'd much rather have it be a bunch of interesting terrain with obstructions/ paths/ impassable mountains with the Lovakengj city nested in the volcanic canyons somewhere.

Each time I've been there it's left no impression on me besides "wow this is a lot of walking"

I like Blast Mining and sulphur quarry though.

&gt;But the colors are way too bright and vibrant
---
Agreed but I see it kind of like the Lunar clan + Zanaris had an ancient city. It'd make sense if it wasn't right at the doorstep of Kourend castle to be honest. I'd imagine some mystical forest filled with witches and spectres would serve as a nice buffer between the relatively medieval cities and its mystical land.

You just helped a dude get off and sexted him for runescape money. Time to go rethink your life. Seriously.

This is 100% false. Bonds are without a doubt MTX. However, bonds are arguably healthy for the game unlike most MTX. They allow dedicated players to play without paying a subscription price, and they combat RWT (people buying black market gold). Most people are okay with bonds, but anything else is off the table.

[About three weeks ago, i made a post about playing Runescape for the very first time ever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/c067tj/as_a_complete_new_player_to_the_game_i_just_want/) Since it was quite popular and some people asked me to do an update, i thought i'd share a small milestone: 1000 total skill as an Ironman.
---
People were saying that Ironman might not be the best choice for a new player, but i'm really glad i started that way. Makes you appreciate every little gear upgrade that much more. Regular accounts seem kind of boring to me in comparison when you can just grind for gp and buy gear, optimal skilling items and so on.
---
I'm still absolutely floored by how much content there is in this game. I feel like i've just barely scratched the surface. There's still so many areas i haven't been to, quests i haven't done, minigames i haven't tried, mobs i haven't been utterly destroyed by, etc. I haven't even really started Hunter or Construction yet. There's literally 10 handwritten post it notes and spreadsheets taped to my monitor that help me keep track of stuff i want to do.

Definitely start working on Slayer with your stats. Mid level slayer kinda sucks but once you hit 60+ you start to unlock some very good money tasks and your combat will level nicely along the way. The Slayer helm also gives you 15% extra damage and accuracy on task when imbued which will help even more

U are realy that broke to pay 132 usd **yearly** and its a issue? Get a job/ go bossing and pay membership with bonds.

At this point, fuck jagex. I wish osrs could become it's own standalone thing. What does jagex do for it, or us? The devs get paid 30k British pounds per year, there's only like 8 of them, while our 40m per year goes to executives and flying out "influencers" to have lunch dates. 
---
Why should we have to support the whole damn flawed as fuck company? Rs3 is in shambles, jagex has never succeeded in anything else, we just want our game that we pay out the ass for to be REASONABLE.

Wow you really are an idiot, arent you? You can't even read hahaha. Wow you truly are special. I tell you what, I'll number and break down points so it's easier for your brain to take in.

1) yes fish kill each other. They kill each other and eat for survival. This guy is being a try hard by trying to catch with his hands and then posing with the fish once he's rammed his hand through its gills.
---
2) you are effectively saying that you think humans and fish have the same level of consciousness and intelligence. Do you not think we are more evolved from fish? Judging from your inability to read basic sentences, it's probably safe to say you haven't.
---
3) I never said I could hunt. I was saying I bet you can't go out and hunt your own food, yet you still eat meat. The amount of people who claim eating meat is natural yet can't kill and prepare their own meat is unreal. If you want to use the claim that we are meant to eat meat naturally, go out and hunt for it yourself the natural way. Try reading next time ;)

The ferocious gloves add +4 to all melee attack bonuses and +2 more strength over the barrows gloves and the tormented bracket adds +4 magic attack and +5% magic damage bonus over barrows gloves.

This is such a disingenuous way of putting it. I'm pro pride, but to say it's not political and about "accepting people" is horseshit. It goes against many of the most popular religions, a ton of social norms and a legal precedent for many countries for the entirety of history.  It is political even if you pretend it's not.

Seems to me everyone offended in the comments is missing the entire reason people were upset by this event. The event was put in the game for political reasons. Events like Christmas and Halloween are mostly, if not entirely, apolitical. Modern day politics do not need to infect ever realm of fantasy. Aside from that, it's not like the characters in R.S. can even have sex. There is no reason to host anything related to sexuality when it has zero bearing on the game.
---
Financial problems? Jagex makes more money currently than it ever has before.
---
Well wait what? It's true that "if we weren't told they existed, we would have no way of knowing" but since we DO know that subtables exist, and that jagex informs us of these subtables (and not on a one-off occurrence, we can assume (through observation and application of what we observe) that since we have not been told of a boots sub table, one does not exist. 
---
But, since we do in fact know they exist, at least in situations where it is a confirmed fact, such as zulrah, you can, absolutely objectively say that landing on the unique table, and then getting something bad, that you were "closer" to the unique you wanted than someone who didn't roll the table at all.
---
You managed to pass one of two barriers towards getting the unique you wanted. Since it's been confirmed, we know it isn't "you rolled a 1023/1024, so you get X" making you indeed, no closer to getting a  specific unique than a 10/1024 and getting no unique at all. You really DID roll a 256/256, then get the wrong roll on the 1/4 roll. You did "almost" get a drop in this situation. And that's not really arguable. 
---
It is "implementation specific" as you said, but in specific implementations where we know the coding, you can in fact almost get a drop. Yes, we don't specifically know if  there's a boots sub-table (nevermind, edit mid writing, we know for a fact there is no such thing) and so in terms of getting cabbages instead of third age, or a mithril cane instead of ranger boots, we can say for sure that one of them is "closer" than the other.  You did, for a fact, roll on the mega-rare table THEN (and this is key - the fact that it's two step is what transitions it from semantics to a factual argument) rolled poorly on said table. Third age appears to be (funnily enough) about half the mega-rare table, so you do literally lose the equivalent of a coin flip for not getting it. Which I dare say, after succeeding a 1/13168, could be called "almost". But regardless, you are definitively closer to getting third age than someone who got no Mega rare.
---
Tldr; you're right about it being implementation specific, but because of that very fact, in some situations you can "almost" get a drop, while in others you can't (or it is unknown to us if you can or cannot, and in those situations you are correct - it would just be semantics, since no facts could be brought in to clarify.)
---
Oh shit, can you do one for me
---
Why is it only shortcuts that anti-diary shitters have a problem with?  I don't understand it, nearly every skill has some benefit from diaries.
---
Exclusive Hunter areas, new spells, extra (and disease-free) patches, extra Slayer points/XP and a block slot, more blood runes crafted, not to mention loads of teleports... But an agility shortcut is what triggers them?
---
Took me several tries to do Jad having 90 Ranged, Elite Void, Blowpipe, and Dragon Darts. Gear and levels don't matter nearly as much as skill. Gear definitely helps but if you're bad it will certainly show.
---
I completely agree with your statement. you literally only pay like 3-4 dollars more for a month of WoW. a game made by a billion dollar company, amazing community care, humongous updates and a support page that actually seems to care at least a bit about what you are after..  
---
I'm not saying osrs is an mmorpg of that degree, but that doesn't mean the devs shouldn't care about us. the company gets passed around like presents on boxing day, you seem to be trying to push us more and more towards MTX, and let's not forget about the monthly hiccups that become huge drama threats.  
---
Bonds are your only saving grace for those of us that are tired of spending a single penny on an overpriced mess. I hope your post will get a lot of dev/mod attention and we can rise as a community!
---

---
Found the guy that got cat fished
---
So I should spend my real, hard earned money instead? I think not. I’d rather save that for bills and fun stuff that I can do with other people. People underestimate how much you can actually make with the right methods. Earning enough to pay for a bond and then profiting another 2-4 mil by playing 20ish hours every 2 weeks is well worth it for me, but if you have nothing else to spend your real money on, then do you. After all, the beauty of RuneScape is that there’s no one right way to play

The cow dude really *takes the cake* in this contest.
---
&gt;Before you even think about trying to squeeze more money out of us, how about using that effort to make the game actually worth $132/year. And if you really can not, stop insulting the community by withholding the content we are already overpaying for. 
---
I have to fully stress, when you're talking about "Jagex" thinking about squeezing money, that initiative comes from the top-down. No actual artist imagines "hey how can I MTX these little fuckers with some bait costumes they won't be able to resist".
---
Also that money they get form you, that doesn't even go to them (aside from bonsues perhaps for the top executives) but this is mostly siphoned off to pay dividends to shareholders. 
---
So to the contrary, the more active the game is - they'll think even MORE about how to squeeze you. And us complaining, only gives them a bigger incentive now that they know we're not lifeless bots, but actually beings with circulatory systems that are ripe for some bloodsucking us dry.

Can something be done about osrs being close to impossible to play without being 1cm away from the screen WITH a 1440p monitor etc. The UI is too small and only fix for this right now is runelite... Which isn't right, even with runelite it looks blurry/you can't resize the UI well enough. (Feel free to edit my question)
---
TLDR: UI SCALING PLEASE for high DPI monitors
---
Nah, bringing politics and real life issues to a game we all play to escape, hardly suprising this is how it turned out
---
This is why I don't listen to my GPS when it says turn right, but there's nothing on the right. :P
---
Why would they? People play games and pay for things regardless of the number of support staff. This thread is evidence: “we will quit if you don’t ______!” Well, they aren’t doing ______ and people are still paying. It’s a really shitty way to do business, but it works.
---
It’s because people ‘reeeeeeeee’d about the hydra being instanced.
---
"git gud" in RuneScape just means putting enough time in to achieve the levels, barring the few instances of skill expression.
---
That looks like a ton of bots. Sorry for asking but, what are T10s and T1s?
---
Quit my maxed character several months ago without any issues. Stuck around the subreddit for the memes. Compared to all of the high quality free games out there, or a game like World of Warcraft with high quality customer support, bug fixes, and consistently big content updates. RuneScape just can’t compete. The only reason they’ve stayed relevant is due to the nostalgia feel and the sense of accomplishment that comes with grinding mind numbing content for skills. They’re trying to squeeze as much money as possible due to the lifespan of the actual game.
---
Worked for WoW classic servers.
---
Well if this ain’t the most wholesome shit
---
I agree completely they deserve more, however there is a big difference in salary between game developers and software developers. Game development is a relatively saturated market compared to other types of software dev.
---
Unfortunately they get paid shit because they can be and people will happily replace them if they find it unacceptable. Starting salary for a game dev in the uk is £19k to 25k. It's supply and demand :/
---
Im glad that lady was there to help
---
Okay ..in that very literal sense I get where you are coming from..but that's not how this plays out in real life. I take it you dont have kids/havent been around very many children
---
Yep. I had this clue step while doing a clue on mobile. Went to the wise old man lol
---
I don't bgs, I'm just very careful with my resources. I always take full pots, I overheal before the fight, and almost always fully avoid the fireball and spawn. Sometimes I have misclicks on the spawn and have to face tank it, but that normally results in not being able to get 2 kills. 
---
And nope, I don't woox walk. I just find me a good line with enough empty spaces, pace back and forth, and turn my quick prayers off until it's over. Also, make sure you only eat during spawn and poison phases (unless you just have to stay above 35-40hp) to not interrupt your DPS, resulting in longer kill times. My PB was 3:02 until yesterday when I had some really good hit RNG and got a new PB of 2:28

Firemaking is a pretty good money maker. Get it to 80 and the gp starts pouring in
---
Assuming all 350 employees are on an average of £30k a year, that's still only 10.5m.
---
If osrs devs got a starting salary of £65k every programmer in the UK would be applying haha
---
Damn. You definitely don't get into computer science to just make 50k a year.
---
This reminds me of in like 2004/2005 when I was a kid, on MSN messenger you could make it so your webcam plays videos and I downloaded some random girls webcam video and would get guys to pay for my membership via that SMS text thing lmao.
---
What food do you take? Since I normally take all sharks +4 or 5 karambwans in case I fuck up and sip a super def, range and extended super antifire before the fight
---
I agree they should be paid more but the bay area in the US is an exception. The 'go big or bust' culture isn't really compatible with Europe since we have laws that protect the workers. Wish we'd invest more in our own tech though. Choosing between cisco and huawei sucks because both aren't secure.
---
There's little room for error on barbarian assault speedruns either.. Definitely takes some skill.
---
That’s what happens when they don’t poll something, people will get toxic very quickly. They poll what kind of Easter event we have every year...

Idk man, thats almost 3 months of membership. Tough choice

I see no issue with that, as long as game integrity isn't destroyed. Totally possible though
---
i still like doing them since they're very fast
---
Imagine telling your mom you're upset with runescape cup designs.
---
Yeah there's way more profitable things to do with your time than mine for 100k/hr
---
I haven't played the game for the last year or so, but from my understanding, are they bringing MTX to OSRS?
---
This is bullshit
---
I would assume mod ash makes more than 50k
---
Ahh finally, here's your problem!!! I've been looking. Your mom sometimes has to go to work and doesn't clean up your cheetoh bags and piss bottles for you all day, and when you have to do it yourself, you have to get off your little game and it makes you salty. That's when you get on reddit and act like a bitch.
---
Force it down my throat daddy
---
Where? It's all relative anyway.
---
Same with souls there is only one difficulty. The first run is always hard but I can run through DS1 in about 4 hours at this point. Same with runescape. Getting that first firecape is usually rough but after that it's no problem.
---
Na my freinds just have better things to do than waste their time playing MMOs. Besides raids are the things for groups and clans bossing should be done solo.
---
&gt;	Ash still paid out 10k of his own money.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
She came in to look at the shelf I was setting up full of gaming stuff and asked where my runescape section was. She knew how attached I am to the game. I told her that i didn't like the designs they offered and she made this. So what's your point? It's horribly weird that it come up in conversation?
---
Source?
---
Literally all reviews on OSRS emphasis this yet jagex hasn’t got a clue.
---
Starting salary at good tech companies in the US is &gt;$100k
---
What are the best stab, slash and crush weapons in the game?
---
&gt; I pay $132 a year, [...]. For this I get only one profile on a bot-filled spaghetti game that has frequent game breaking bugs.
---
hahaha. and you are still not questioning yourself?! :-)
---
Haven't you heard? Gamer girl bathwater is the latest greatest hot commodity! Don't you subscribe to questionable subreddits?

Tojo machine gun fire blew them off in the war. He killed fiddy men!

Widespread internet adaptation and it's consequences have been disasterous for mankind.

You think this would help but the day they add it you'll be on here bitching about how only maxed pures and access the content so we need to restrict it further. Wait a few weeks to kill the boss, or deal with the boss being popular and taking less kills/hr.
---
I will never have Elite Void, how about normal void? Before I took it to the wild and had some fun losing it, it wasn't as strong afaik

Is it possible to recover a account from 2003 only knowing the username? I dont have my email from that time and jagex was wanting the email.
---
I’d cry
---
Same issue here.
---
I understand that but everyone keeps talking about it like Jagex will still add MTX even though the community voted no and Jagex addressed that they won't add MTX. It makes it seem like they are still pressuring to add MTX
---
yeah i also diced

Please consider a different way of participating. There are bots that do better.
---
The game is online as you can see by watching streamers, but you can’t log in. So you can play if you’ve been playing. But basically everyone that was doing anything that requires world hopping. Pking, revs, Pvm, slayer. Like 90% of the community world hops so we can’t play
---
A moment of silence for the servers... maybe we can finally quit this god damn game
---
Or like u/ihavea3ds pointed out, you might need to try the ledge or the tanky route
---
(chuckles at my username)

Slow

Nice.

me too it just happened to me too I need a refund also

wtf is wrong with your legs dude first the knees now this

That’s incredibly low! I live in a cheaper area and I earn 30k euros per year for a lot less demanding work (IT support).

Its not just meeeee. Let me tf in. I gotta grindddddd

Support.
---
Jesus, that pay is abysmal. Take into account the outdated tech stack and working at Jagex isn't just career suicide. It's just plain suicide.
---
You betcha.

Bot nuke

Thank you man :) we had so much fun making it

Not to mention you play GW2 which is full of MTX..

You literally should just quit talking.

Maybe Jagex tries to convince us that partnership is needed to run servers.

Neither works for me. =(

Ayee!! This has to go viral!!

I heard every one was creating a "No need to create a "Error connecting to server" post on Reddit...."" post

So you lied for upboats huh?
---
Yes I am too.
---
Same don’t know why
---
There isn’t anything I’m not flexing about with 99 STR
---
he didn't eat stackable food, he unnoted food at the rimmington general store
---
A while back someone (I think Woox?) Won a deadman tournament by having tons of noted food and using phials to un note it and eat through the fog damage, which allowed him to survive the longest without PVPing. It was decided that the person who won through PVP would get the winnings from the tournament, but Ash chose to pay Woox(?) Out of pocket because the trick with Phials was something Ash meant to patch out of Deadman worlds.
---
Yeah me too
---
HCIM btw
---
Same. Was at bandos, got kc then took a shit and came back to this
---
He was sitting by vials in rimmington and un-noting karamwans and i believe sharks or (or manta rays?) and then *combo eating*. He was dq’d not for doing anything specific against the rules. Just didn’t feel like spirt of deadman to have him win. Hence the controversy.
---
Just got this now, I was logged on normally few mins ago, wtf

Bro 8m for premium? I'd vote yes

Damn 2 hours of vorkatg for premium? Count me in.

Cool beans.

Wages, taxes, pensions, healthcare, costs of living (food, rent, etc.) are all very different in the US vs UK and rest of Europe. You get paid twice as much and all you have to show for it is bleached white teeth.
---
Everyone today. Apparently ppl got kicked out of the servers too
---
This is completely location based. $55k in my state is pretty much equal to $100k in California. Cost of living variance around the US is insane
---
This is me :)
---
£50.000 sounds like a lot.
---
There should be some kind of compensation to EVERYONE who just disconnected
---
thats genuinely shocking, please can people remember it is just a game
---
Nope, not at all what happened.
---
Same here too
---
nope im at revs getting free loot
---
I believe it was the second DMM tourney where Woox used Phials and tick ate all the damage from the fog in the final hour. This caused him to win over someone who truly won, but Jagex gave the other guy the award money. Woox was upset because no rules stated he couldn’t do that, and he should be the rightful winner. Ash paid Woox the $10k because he felt bad about the game he coded, more or less. 
---
TL;DR - Woox won a tourney by tick eating and never fighting, jagex didn’t pay so God Ash did
---
This makes no sense.. Its literally easier to rig the results when people can see the number.. You didn't think about this very much.
---
Trying to get 89 WC today!

Fish taste great, and Im sure hunting them like this is a ton of fun.

Yup, me too. Wasn't sure if just me as I've not tried to log in for a few days.
---
You know how easy it is to get to Senior Software Engineer? Takes like 2 years. The quoted salary is 41k pounds, which is 51k dollars. 
---
OP of this reddit post read a comment on another thread that I also read that was probably bullshit and everyone took it at face value smh.
---
That's such a Jagex thing to do. "You didn't technically break any rules since we forgot to make any rules, but fuck you."
---
I don't think anyone who understands mmo trading systems would consider bonds mtx. It's pretty clear why they exist and what they achieve.
---
This community is destroying itself.  The players are used to being ignored and now when you have a decent game where the devs actually listen, instead of meeting them halfway with constructive criticism you have posts like this that are just basking in a power trip.  You sound like a modern day SJW in America who gets anything they want based on victim complexes and then still hits people at rallys for voicing an opinion.
---
When you consider Jagex is based in cambridge it isn't amazing either. Software developer roles in cambridge average around £30k for context. They're pretty much bang on average
---

does the trident of the seas work for driftnet fishing or should i buy a merfolk trident?
---
Sure, it works well for the cost of living, but you kinda get screwed if you want to buy foreign goods. If what OP says is true, I make more interning for a small startup at my very first job...
---
Membership cost, it went up in price and ppl say that the 11$ should be the cost of making the game not do things or do more things
---
So every pays 330

I honestly leave them as motivation to keep doing laps, in the back of my mind i know if i stop too long or slack off too much im going to lose out

but uhhh yeah, the ticks man, im doing it for the ticks

I'd assume before - recent graduate friends fall exactly in those lines with the most paid just starting a new job this week at 25k.

This is from an average uni however, I'm sure if you graduate from somewhere prolific you will start higher, working in London also increases starting salaries by a lot (doesn't make up for living in London)

It's really, really shit for Cambridge. It's not as bad as Oxford or London but Cambridge is probably top 5 most expensive places to live in the UK.

Many people see the partnerships that were proposed as MTX.
---
They recently increased the monthly subscription price from 9 or 10 bucks to 11, so whenever there's a typo or minor glitch somewhere in RuneScape it's a meme to say "🦀🦀🦀🦀REEEEE I PAY$11 FOR THIS??  LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!!🦀🦀🦀🦀"
---
Why the heck would you start a petition? 
---
If you don't like a companies practices you stop buying their products.
---
Now stop buying bonds and paying for membership if you actually care, and stop fishing for karma.
---
Same! I do pretty much everything I used to do except for bossing. Farming, Slayer, NMZ, etc. Questing is a bit annoying but that's nothing new
---
Literally unplayable
---
Did they really? F
---
Wait. Thats ilegal
---
get the loots
---
Sure but then in that case pray ticking can also be considered an “exploit” along with the woox walk and other tricks. This is what woox does is find these little tricks. If he found the loophole he should be allowed to do it.
---
50k in the UK and you're pretty minted
---
I hated cheese from this lovely cartoon lol
---
£30k is equivalent to like $1000/wk AUD which is decent.  I'm sure they get overtime when they stay back on projects or work on weekends as well, unless it's salary based.
---
Okay when the developers make it clear that it is not MTX and will not lead to MTX, then this overreaction is rooted out of pure distrust for the developers.
---
Idk about you, but that sounds super toxic of us as a community.

Honestly finally someone said it.. step it the fuck up jagex.. I recently ended my membership until things get better.. I’m just gonna do occasion f2p training and skilling in the meantime... I’ve spent easily 500+ dollars on membership over the past decade and to be frank 11.99 for a bot filled spaghetti game with underpaid devs who do all the dirty work. It’s unacceptable and I wholeheartedly agree with this post. Something needs to change, I love this game but I am a man with dignity
---
Bloody hell. Do you think there is a magic money tree?
---
wah i like capatalism except when i dont - osrs community
---
It never showed up the first time as far as I remember. But it is safe?
---
They are trying to do that with warding I believe
---
A bow gets the force from the bow flexing and returning to the original position. A longbow would have a draw weight of around 50-60kg meaning when you flex to full draw and hold it it is weighting 60kg on your arm pulling back. So in reality bowmen aim before/as they draw and just release. Holding more then a few seconds is impossible without severely affecting accuracy.
---
If the force was in the string it would have to be some super elastic string which does not exist in current world. Maybe in fantasy yeah, but you won't kill anyone with an arrow shot like that in the real world.
---
some were more affected than others, those HCIM are rightfully pissed for losing their status because of this.
---
This is the worst thing I've ever read dude

He’s gonna browse reddit outside on his phone.

Ash is one of the first developers. He probably has an equity stake in the company.

---
It's considered a legitimate way to win in other Battle Royal games. It's reasonable to believe Woox's strategy would be allowed. If Jagex didn't want people outhealing the fog they should have made it an instant kill. It's on them.
---
Awarding the prize to both could have been a way to honor both the spirit and the letter of the rules. Awarding the prize to neither means they do not get to take any highground in this argument. Even if you think Woox was cheating, Jagex still committed fraud.
---
I wonder if there's a chance someone got stuck in that house with the BGS on a table. panic sell BGS now
---
yep. if a user is smart enough to exploit loopholes in your game, they shouldn't be punished for it. you thank them for discovering said loophole, maybe reward them, and patch it out.
---
This just reads like a disappointmented dad speech.

It's pretty much always safe to leave them there.
---
*pretty much...*
---
If you're not willing to drop the game in protest of their poor treatment of the devs, then I'm afraid your post will fall on deaf ears.
---
It's been 3 days, pay up!
---
Hey! Capitalism is trash.
---
30k is definetly on the low end of the scale, I work a stones throw from Jagex and am on 40+ with just two years experience in the field, with a lot of my friends / network on the same. 30k for a job is amazing for sure, but 30k for a developer is essentially peanuts! To put it in perspective I started as a junior on mid-twenties!
---
This is very different, Janitors work doesn't directly result in the company making more money.  Developers have a direct correlation to profits in the game.  Also these are not interns making this, this is entry level making low wages.  Senior developers are paid around 45k according to glassdoor.  This is disgustingly low.
---
For perspective, I work in the U.S. in a rural area.  I work for a DoD company and make 72k a year as an entry level software engineer fresh out of college.  I have a bachelor's in computer science.  My work can directly influence the profits my company receives on the programs I work.
---
How is that any different for the developers at Jagex?  There work is a direct influence to their profits and they are going to gouge them?  This is nothing compared to "Janitors working at Amazon" get a grip.
---
Too many worlds? It's literally impossible to get a spot in crowded places

---
Lol no they haven't. Go on pol now they're quite overt and open about it. 4 national socialism threads, Christchurch shooter appreciation thread, Jewish media control thread, black people hate thread, AI will kill us, Hitler appreciation thread, YouTube is run by pedos, book recommendations, etc etc.

Nobody using those boards is pretending to be ironic. If you read any one of those threads you'd see it's all pretty sincere in what they believe.
---
Shirt rip to rage scream was tight though
---
weird flex but ok
---
google ‘rng’
---
damn.  that's the dream
---
Yeah but that was what they wanted, did it sell for that? That’s huge. Not that I would be surprised, multiples have been crazy lately. 350M seems reasonable.
---
the same shit happened to me, every object seems like 2 squares away
---
I think it was more not punishing the guy who just outlasted everyone in the big ass final fight using his pvp skills. I believe they should have paid them both personally, but what do you say to that guy that played great and came out on top?
---
$132 a yr btw
---
And what's your point exactly
---
Big not false
---
can you pick it up ??
---
Lol. Are you talking about unique stash tab? If so yes thata how it works but you can buy 6 stash tabs for 12$ on a weekend sale (which is happening right now) and that one can fit a lot of different armours and currency. The cosmetics works different because the money you spent gets subtracted to the amount of cost of mtx you want, so if you wanna buy mtx in the future all the money you spent before will lower the price of mtx. Lastly the mtx was the only way to support the devs.
---
Lol

Jagex not paying their employees enough is a direct correlation to the greed of trying to introduce "Partnerships".  If Jagex wants us to trust they have the games health in mind, then pay the developers more money.  If they start paying more for developers, then maybe they are being serious about healthy partnerships and not greedy money grabbing partnerships that will erode the games integrity.

Move your house to Rimmington so you can teleport to your house on W330 and use someone else's house for their stuff when you need to, then plant it in Brimhaven.
---
So is the other 1000 posts about it.... so weird how you also have this problem.....................
---
the real advice
---
No it is just an MTX ridden cesspool.
---
I also despise iron and steel dragons. I blocked steel because I was getting assigned them so many times. Would it be efficient to block iron dragon tasks? It just doesn't seem worth my time, at 76 magic the kills are relatively slow.
---
After maxing my incognito mode ultimate iron man,
---
I was in middle of a TROLO zammy trip, main tank account logged off instead of hopping worlds.
---
Had to finish the kill with duo tbows, and hoping the tanker didnt die while your servers died.
---
At moments like this a pornhub partnership would fit in, brb
---
I forgot about that. Basically you want to extend all of the do tasks that you can except the expeditious bracelet ones. You want to unlock bigger and badder and slayer rings. You do not want to unlock anything that gives you different tasks. I put tzhaar in the list but actually you should probably hold off on that until you can do fight caves super efficiently.
---
why didn't jagex pay him though?
---
Bro they’ve been having log-in server issues that’s why you and your clan mates got disconnected. Use your brain they haven’t started fixing it yet.
---
Fuckin same broooo
---
Get bigger and badder ASAP, extend dust devils
---
Why not just take the servers down for X minutes to fix. Lmao, RIP the next HCIM that dies when the "fixes" are happening because he didn't see the announcement hahaha
---
Hardly any software developer will be making the equivalent of $65k in the UK, even with 10+ years experience

Yeah a jmod already posted a thread on it - https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/ca8tkt/please_read_login_server_outages_potential/?st=jxt6zb29&amp;sh=911aabe4
---
Embarrassing the whole thing
---
It happens. Sucks for it to be a nice Sunday afternoon when something blows up, but that's the joy of trying to manage 24/7 uptime.
---
Nope nope nope. Dont put microtransactions near one of the only actually engaging things in the game
---
But there could be scamming involved, which is another thing this would solve. I imagine the interface would be like trading an item.
---
It appears that the osrs subreddit is broken, if you make a comment you'll get downvoted to shits.  
---
When someone else makes the EXACT same type of comment he'll get 300+ upvotes, I'm just thinking about leaving this autistic circle-jerk.
---
There are 133 salaries reported on glassdoor, across 77 job titles, most of which only have 2-3 reports, and glassdoor lists them all (as far as I can see)  as low confidence. For content dev there are 4 reports listing it at £30k as the BASE pay, this sounds entirely accurate for a junior level position (newest content dev is a fresh from uni hire remember, and £30k is entirely normal for graduate level positions in the UK). Who knows how old those reports are, or what Jagex raise policy is (the company I work for, for example, starts at a low base salary but hands out raises very fast). Your post is nothing but a quick karma cash in and you should be ashamed.

So you'd be happy if someone could just use real money to unlock content first, while you will have to earn it afterwards?
---
Luckily, I took my loot (including the dust) out of the chest within the chambers, but as I was going to use it on my olmlet within the raid, I got dced. Ideally it should be in my inventory, but a lot of my friends have been talking about a potential rollback. I'll be so sad if I lose this.
---
Exactly, this happens all the time it'll be fixed soon.
---
Reported
---
Absolutely not. This breeds resentment between players who can afford the partnerships and those who cannot. Look at times exclusives in games like Destiny and Call of Duty. It's unfun for everyone involved.
---
Exact same thing happening to me - apparently there are server issues
---
Same problem for me. Can't log in to my maim.

You won't it appears in raid chest outside the bank.

I was already disconnected before this message. When I can only play for 1 or 2 hours every few days due to my life circumstances, and I am paying monthly for this, how is it that all worlds can just go down for over 10 minutes at a time in the middle of the day?

I wish I could give you gold. Such an under appreciated comment

PoE is a shell of it's former self. PoE and GGG were great 5 years ago - now the game is riddled with aesthetic killing super shiny MTX, lootboxes (don't care if it's cosmetic only), LOADS of screen garbage (enemies, skill effects e.t.c.), completely mindless gameplay and difficulty based on random mechanics. You don't die to a boss any more, you die because there are 80 enemies on screen and an offscreen archer bops you with a crit for 8k life that you don't see incoming.
---
As you can tell, I'm a salty ex HC player. Feel like the HC crowd made a name for the game, pushed it hard and then we all got abandoned. Old school PoE was a suber vibesy dark masterpiece - walk into Lunaris part 2/the Crem and are greeted by harrowing screams. Now it's a mess of flashing lights and a complete inability to see what's on screen.
---
£50k in the UK is far above average, and in most cases (outside of London) is considered a middle-class income

This is a joke. All worlds going down at the same time means that this game's netcode is the most spaghetti bullshit. How can a game that makes millions of dollars, played by hundreds of thousands of people, all be hosted from a centralized location? Shockingly incompetent.
---
Does changing password regularly help with account security?
---
He said that this notice is in response to the unexpected server outage. They are giving a heads up to the player-base that hasn't been affected yet so they aren't affected by something deliberate like taking certain servers offline. What you experienced was unexpected so there was no way for them to warn you beforehand
---
Why are you petitioning for somebody to make 45-50k? What is the overall goal here, where did this figure come from? The devs applied for the job and signed the contract they wanted like everybody else. Its not like they are children drafted into a sweat shop for 10 cents a day. it's a good salary and a good job. maybe you should spend this energy trying to improve your own situation?

It's also still wasaaay too big. Same with arceuus and shayzien. Pisc is relatively small and feels like there could be a lot of stuff in there in the future and hosidius is largely fixed with the updates.

Ive actually had decent experience with the new boss with stuff like this. Most mid levels will either be willing to dou, wait for their turn, or simply hop worlds.

The only bad experiences I've had are from the 120+ players. They'll crash immediately and say nothing because they know my 103cb ass has to hop if I want a chance at any of the drops.

The salary of devs has a downstream affect on other jobs too. I'm a writer in the game industry and considered a few European companies but the pay would have been lower and taxes higher.
---
I make just under 6 figures now, with a few years experience as a writer. I don't know how Europe gets away with paying devs so little.
---
Also, some person below mentioned health care. Those of us making professional salaries in the US get full benefits. Even European companies were offering me private insurance on top of the public insurance, so no that doesn't really account for the massive difference.
---
This is gold

Yeah, like they know the exact second their server goes down right?

I’m wondering if I even need a gaming pc. The literal only reason I want this is for osrs as I have an Xbox One X that I use if I want to play any other game.

I think at this point they need to make this the new login screen.

The prime membership literally effected the game badly botting forums were selling twitch prime membership accounts in bulk to suicide bot p2p areas heavily, this couldn’t be done without bonding suicide bots or paying for p2p both of which would be rare

I have literally never dced in osrs. I wasn't playing for this and I'm not really saying the servers are amazing or anything, but I have personally not once dced.
---
Most people who say otherwise either haven’t got a job in the field or work in big tech cities and think it’s like that every where.
---
That's only true if you're trying to work for startups or companies making "new" products.  Programmers with high levels of experience in even Java are in high demand for product maintenance.
---
Look at the salaries they're offering people who program in JOVIAL or COBAL.
---
Ok

This is fantastic!

Pretty sure that is what people are misunderstanding. People opposed to free speech like to mock people in this kind of way, when nobody ever really demands they should be able to bypass company rules like that.

Your mom has 99 crafting
---
 or they decide to add more than just cosmetics to continue the increased revenue stream from it. 
---
This part of your statement simply can't just eventuate out of nothing. Believe it or not, I have a feeling that jagex have some idea of what their playerbase is ok with. They aren't just going to go "OK, we added some cosmetics, lets introduce an item shop where you can buy X"  They've already stated unequivocally that they would never offer Exp, wealth, or resources. 
---
However, even if they DID, take FF XIV as an example, which has a perfectly reasonable cash shop in the game, that as an MMO (That has also used Twitch prime partnerships btw) is absolutely CRUSHING IT. The game is  amazing and one of the few MMOs that is still thriving. 
---
I don't think they will ever do that with OSRS, they aren't so stupidly out of touch. Being scared of this slippery slope is a ridiculous reason to not want Jagex to do things to bring in new players. All they are saying they want to do is introduce some cosmetics as a reward to players who join through whatever partnerships they offer, and then make those cosmetics available to all players, and you're all freaking out.
---
Also depending on the company it's not uncommon of for janitors/cleaning staff to work for a third-party company instead of being direct-hires.
---
They did develop that C++ client for RS3 which works brilliantly (much better than the Java client, at least). I'm just surprised they didn't do the same for OSRS yet.
---
should be plenty easy to disprove then
---
Vorkath is easier but alot more boring imo due to no hype off rare drops due to them being super rare.
---
It sucks having to use runelite for it but under the stretched mode plugin do you have "increased performance mode" ticked on or off? I play on a 1440p monitor with that off and my ui scaled up 60% and [it looks clear to me.](https://i.imgur.com/AykC7WC.png)
---
That's not nitpicky at all. It's two entirely different things. One is using a stackable food item to eat wherever you want to, another is using one specific NPC in one specific location.
---
More like 60-65k anywhere else but definitely not 80k+ as people have mentioned unless in a big tech city.

That's what I'm saying as well, sorry if I didn't make that clear. Even with internships, most new grads end up in that range, albeit at the higher end.

It's why game devs are paid like shit compared to software devs, data scientists etc... the competition is watered down because people are willing to work for less on a game that they play in their free time.
---
Unlucky him for not occupying the top of the food chain. Or not having teeth lol
---
You are correct, but the prime membership was an issue on Twitch's side. People found ways to create infinite Twitch prime accounts, which they could then use to claim infinite months membership. If we were sitting here saying "Jagex shouldn't partner with Twitch until they fix their system", then I would be agreeing with you.
---
Facebook/Instagram/Whatsapp (valued at $560 billion) went down for 6 hours the other day. Jagex solved this issue in 15 minutes, have some respect.
---
Wasn’t giving me an error message just not letting me logon entirely
---
&gt;people think they know more than they do about the financial side of game development
---
Apparently you think you know as well, or you're just an idiot because you're choosing to put blind faith into a company with a well-established record of fucking up their own game in various ways on the orders of their shareholders. 
---
Everything about this process, from the wording of the proposed microtransactions to the cancellation of the poll and the snarky blog post reeked of bad faith on Jagex's part. 
---
Of course the community lashed out the way it did. Many of us don't want to see 6-13+ years of loyal commitment trodden over on account of a deceitful, short-sighted business decision. 
---
This is OSRS, a game born from the ashes of Jagex's failure. *There will not be another version of this game*. This is their last and only chance to keep things going the right way.
---
What is Microtransaction? Is it paying money for small part of game?  Does it matter if this money is paid directly to developers or 3rd party company? No, it is still MTX.  
---
 They just said there will be no microtransaction in post about adding microtransaction. in 2012 thy also said there will be no pay2win micro transaction, it did not ended well.  
---
There were people against twitch promotion.
---
What they polled was also vague.

Does anyone know the specs needing to run OSRS seamlessly?

yes 2007 servers have the same colour plastic as normal gracefull

Sometimes I genuinely wonder how Jagex can fuck up so terribly. I'm still dying of laughter from that TBow spawn.

Right, and it was an unacceptable choice, which you are defending as normal.

While that sounds nice, I don't think I could be away for that long every week from my gf and my kid that's coming soon, it's nice and an option if you're young and carefree without a family to look after

The pay is definitely significantly lower in most of Europe. I don't know if it accounts for the difference, but you have much more rights.
---
Here in Germany for example, you can't really get fired easily, meaning job security is very good. Things like "sick days" aren't really a thing. You can be sick for months, still receive most of your salary and eventually return to your job. You'd have a right to 20 holidays for working 40 hour weeks, but in my experience, around 30 days is normal for devs. Things like maternity/paternity leave are guaranteed and very elaborate. 
---
Another related advantage is if you do lose your job while being on the public insurance system, you don't suddenly lose your insurance. Losing your job therefore won't bankrupt you if you were undergoing any treatment.
---
Can you pm the name?

You say they might get paid 30k a year but I'm pretty sure the company has bonuses at the end of the year depending how good the year went which almost every game company has these days.

One of the main reasons I quit osrs. Too much anxiety with my very high lvl Ironman with uniques that took hundreds of hours to obtain to just to be lost to the ground by a DC. The anxiety was so high I couldn’t bring my self to have fun at GWD bosses. Jagex dragged their feet with gravestones so I decided I didn’t find osrs fun anymore and quit back in January. Been playing FFXIV and been having a blast.
---
Because it's in the wild
---
Twist it around in there next time boss.
---
Having an npc that breaks 4th wall completely by acknowledging usernames and giving them value to buy and sell would be extremely out of place and immersion breaking imo. 
---
I also think it would be weird for a company to be okay with name trading so much that they opening encourage it in game. They've said it's not against the rules but advise you don't do it cus of scamming and I think that's how it should stay. Being able to make money in game just by making and trading and selling user names is dumb to me. I know people already do it but it's all about it being black market grey area vs being upfront in my face as a part of the game.
---
damn head. Clearly, you're thinking with your dickhead. Maybe use the actual head you have.
---
Yeah sure send me a screenshot

why didn’t you just tele out after getting it?

I earn that much doing IT support in a low pay area of England. These guys are more qualified, have much harder jobs and live in a far more expensive area. £30 is low for a software developer, never mind a games developer

Just don't give them your account name or anything as jagex might ban you out of revenge.
---
I at least feel better when they talk a little shit to me so I know they’re a complete scumbag, when they silent I just picture some chad sitting there thinking like “well I already hopped 3 worlds, you gotta suffer now.”
---
This is why i refuse to grind 77 runecraft lol not worth it if the game could be ruined by the time im done
---
How can they still have it? Any name i try with ganja gets rejected and cant find a bunch of random names i type with ganja in highscores either.
---
Damn you're a salt mine lmfao
---
That’s RNG my guy. Some dude is gonna do 1,000 and get 141 pairs and it balances.
---
This is the saddest TIL for me :(   These developers made my childhood fun and memorable
---
I pay $5 a month tbf.
---
I’m trying to get geared up to grind some Vorkath for gold. I don’t have enough gp for a bgs, should I be using another spec weapon (bone dagger or cbow potentially), or should I just go with most likely much slower kills until I can afford it?
---
Yeah wtf. £65k is a lot, especially for game development.
---
If you’re going to make a post saying “I just read X”, you should at least provide a link to it
---
Do many of the devs even have cs degrees? I have to assume only a few or none of them do given that the response to a lot of suggestions is “sorry, engine work”. 
---
Not only that but CS salaries are significantly higher in the US compared to EU. According to pay scale, senior software devs in Cambridge, England can expect between £45-55k a year.  
---
Additionally, I don’t know (at least from this post) who the devs are that are making 30-40k or what they actually do - we call everyone on the osrs team a dev but some of them are just doing community stuff, some are graphics, etc.
---
I haven't seen any other contributions for the contest but this one looks absolutely smashing!
---
Who says they every fixed them?
---
Oh wow something that isn't a joke....Looks really good has that old school vibe.
---
Yes, forgot to mention that im also collecting everything from random events tho lamps would be a bit difficult considering they cant be bankes
---
Senior for RuneScript I see as pretty likely. But I dunno if that would mean he gets paid much more :/
---
Gno you
---
Yeah, ofcourse they wouldn't pay him that now.
---
But the game wasn't worth the same 15 years ago.
---
Anyways, from the statements it doesn't look like he has ever had a stake, unless he's part of one of the investment firms for some reason.
---
But I'd be suprised if he didn't either get a pretty hefty salary or gets a bonus depending on the yearly income.
---
Lol so bad today almost died twice.
---
Chill the fuck out lmao
---
He thinks Americans are dumb and doesn’t realize that there a tons of not stupid Americans... it’s weird people can in one breath derp Americans are dumb and in the other they talk about google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. All American companies. Weird.
---
Jagex isn't that stupid not to remove max cash stack from the chest after showing it off... Oh wait
---
It’s so bitter, not a fan
---
Yeah, RIP in Peace those guys amirite?
---
who cares
---
Ah yes, all the brass necklaces the heart can desire!
---
I remember when they updated Varrock and I saw the newspaper, expecting there to be new updates on it all the time. Kinda dissapointing
---
What would be a better upgrade for zulrah, armadyl helm for range or Ancestral Hat for magic? I am currently using full blessed dhide and ahrims hat
---
Daily reminder that runelite doesn't make the game easier.
---
My bad I'm just in a bad mood :/
---
Is justiciar or karil's is better for tanking zammy? And would tbow beat out archlight for dps?
---
Yeah that's the sort of raise I've had in the past.  That's about 1.5k/year extra right?
---
He also does accounting for free with some nonprofits, and plays violin. Tbh I think he's just a regular old nerd with lots off passion every where.
---
It's hard for us to see cause we're young and not in a good place, but people like ash do exist. They found their niche in life and just enjoy to continually work on those hobbies or passion projects. 
---
It's how you don't go insane in this crazy world we live in.
---
That'd just make them have back ups ready to go, wouldn't change much. While their accounts that meet the requirements are spamming, they'll have the replacements aging.
---
Solo mission also
---
You're bound to find a couple series you'd enjoy from at least a few of them I hope. Good luck and happy training!
---
Everyone on reddit is an expert at game design, balance and economics, who could definitely make and run the game better than Jagex does.
---
Honestly, you would have to have nerves of steel to work for Jagex with how toxic the community is, or just not browse the internet at all
---
You would be surprised.... people underestimate how much they are worth all the time and settle for what they're getting, and the company isnt looking out for you, at least not monetarily. 
---
I do think op has a point though. They make a helluva lot of money with relatively few staff yo be paying them nickles, especially in a dead end job like Jagex.
---
You’re right. It’s a legal grey area and it would require an actually analysis and decision by a court.
---
However, he *definitely* violated the spirit of the game.
---
I do agree though that perhaps I didnt provide the proper definition.
---
The “spirit of the game” is basically the intended way to play, in order to have fun and give everyone a fair chance. It’s actually pretty easy to violate the spirit of a game.
---
The point is, a court could, in theory, find that Woox violated the spirit of the game but in a way that wasn’t very severe, and thus still is owed the prize money.
---
My point is, when I say Woox “violated the spirit”, I dont mean he isnt owed money. It’s basically like saying Woox “did something kinda shady”, which he did.
---
So what I’m saying is that we should all agree that the spirit of the game was violated, but we can disagree on whether or not it was bad enough that Jagex is at fault.
---
Now, again, legally speaking Jagex is essentially giving away free money in this contest, and the courts like to let those who host expensive contests do pretty much whatever they want (within reason), so Woox would DEFINITELY lose if taken to court, but that’s beside the point.
---
Anyways just know that “violating the spirit of the game” doesnt mean cheat, it just means you did something strange or unusual which the contest host didnt really intend/expect/want to happen.
---
Heck, you could even argue prayer flicking violated the spirit of the game, and the courts may agree. However, the courts would just be like “well prayer flicking does violate the intent of the prayer drain system, however there’s clear precedent of Jagex allowing flicking, therefore it’s ok”
---
Justiciar pray mage, Arclight still better DPS
---
Wtf Jagex added Morytania POH even though it failed smh
---
A dirty part skipper? In my jojo community?
---
Personally I think ancestral hat. Gives a % damage increase instead of just accuracy.
---
what did you do to this photo
---
if i am afk'ing something that drops a lot of coins (gargs i.e.) then fuck ya i wear that shit :D
---
berserker ring is generall the best for the +2 max hit
---
Try saving up for bgs. Your kills will be slower at first, however you should be able to quickly afford a bgs.
---
Who just lashes out in violence when they are upset. Big yikes
---
When i finally did ds2
---
BabyRage
---
NO! Anything but my reddit karma points! you can take my wife or wwe championship belt I personally won and killed john cena for anything but the reddit karma!!!!
---
Its literally a ballot box lol. Get ur tin foil hat off OP
---
In what case is that ring better than all others?
---
Wtf is up with 2Heads thinking they'd ever reroll because of server issues. They only ever do that with gamebreaking bugs like the tbow spawn lmao.
---
My name has no spacing since with spacing it would be more than 12 characters. So guess i can't do much about it.
---
yikes
---
Runescape is way overpriced for what you get. And before people try to say base it on hours, hours played != a games value; otherwise games like CS:GO or LoL/Dota would cost $500-1000.
---
Jagex taking the money and running
---
Bulgarian CS grads accept really low salaries or something? Not European so quite curious about this.
---
Yea, no.
---
I’m a Modelo kind of guy, it’s perfect for me.
---
I'm pretty sure when the login servers crashed earlier it causes some graphical glitches where the entire game was shifted a few tiles out of place, boundaries still exist in their normal places, just everything is being displayed a few tiles away from where it should be
---
At the end of day everyone who works for Jagex knew what the salary was coming in and agreed to it by signing a contract. Its not like any of them were tricked into joining the company. If they weren’t happy with their salary they shouldnt have started working there in the first place.
---
the face in my name? if so, yes
---
Some people do not realize OP is joking
---
Lmao you're really butthurt, aren't you? Do you even have a Twisted Bow? I got a split hours after the rollback from the bug.
---
Obvious when there wasnt a rule about it? Prayer flicking isnt an intended mechanic either but people do it all the time and is almost required
---
Probably should be though, I feel bad using the feature to basically auto complete it. Not bad enough to stop using it though, AYYYY
---
I played mobile for the first time at their brewery in petaluma. It was a great time
---
This isn’t really much of an issue tbh, longer passwords increase the entropy by so much more than a larger character set
---
Yeah what the hell.. software developers being paid 30k is horrible, makes me wonder why someone would work there though. Honestly hard to believe someone who's top notch would be willing to work for that little, it's an insulting amount even for an entry level candidate with absolutely 0 work experience.
---
I think that’s where they’re going to put your moms house
---
Yeah I’m at 55 and want to dive off a clothesline irl, the dedication from some people is unreal.
---
Goddamn, OP's ready to start throwing tea in the harbor again
---
I guess, it depends really on how much you value income over quality of life. A higher salary doesn't necessarily mean qol is better, I've heard theres no legal maternal/paternal time off, minimum holidays, pension contributions etc in the US. Doesn't seem worth it to me. Not to mention orange man.
---
I'd protect everything except for magic and mahoganies (I might be missing one). Cost of the protection items are too high to make it worth it for these.
---
Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?
---
This would have got me more prepared for a one shot. the spawn location of first purple blob that splits in 2  is where jad will spawn in the final wave
---
What if all share holders get free membership?
---
Not joking, I think it would make the game a lot better.
---
ur so right
---
This is a great idea. They could do max stats / max gear promotions for $30
---
Thanks, any tips on how to make it look better?
---
Also, one of them is warding. I thought it would be redundant to copy-paste the whole 54 page google doc they posted.
---
Absolutely based
---
U/uwutranslator
---
&gt; simple like JS
---
&gt;complicated like java
---
what
---
Join the fun :D
---
:^0
---
There is something happening with the servers, lots of people are disconnecting.
---
Once again great work dude, I especially like that you changed the salamander to one of each type of attack, meaning only really good flicks will be able to avoid it in combat. The new bolts look interesting too. I can imagine the community maybe not liking the butterflys as radius effects (such as battle wards which were taken from warding due to poor feedback) and am not the biggest fan but just my opinion. The effort you put it is amazing and this concept looks incredible and really fleshed out, I’d love to be able to do hunter contracts and am excited by the idea of the ur-kollus. Keep it up.
---
you can get those thru Garg boss too tho
---
D-boiz
---
Except he wasn't tick eating. This all happened before the fog would kill you near instantly if you weren't at the designated fighting grounds. He simply was out eating the fog, not tick eating. There was no rule against what he was doing.
---
lmao fuckin rip man
---
If that's true I'm no longer upset about the quality of this game, it all makes sense now.
---
I got it on my first try (waited till 90 ranged lol) it isn't all that difficult you just have to stay calm and do one thing at a time while ensuring you have the correct prayer for jad.
---
This is honestly what I’m thinking
---
And that 70s show
---
Amulet of magic/strength/power never run out. Forging should just be a right-click -&gt; check
---
SquadW
---
I am willing to wager that if make a C++ Client, and then open source it, it would take over Runelite
---
The birds could potentially work as a cape slot item. They were one of my favourite parts when this initial blog came out and I’d love to see them in the game.
---
/r/iam14andthisisdeep
---
Mom says its my turn to post this next week
---
Charges are for teleport jewelry I don’t think any of those have charges you have to worry about
---
It's all of the drama of May and June packed in one week of fun!
---
Sorry bub i got it locked down for the next 2 weeks.
---
Lel what a noob thinking it was sweets tsk tsk
---
I'm only fucking with you it was kinda close by purple sweets are a rare  commodity in DMM
---
Close enough I guess :-)
---
High volume items like cannonballs and runes are a good way to get a feel for it
---
garg boss takes at least 75 slayer which in and of itself is a nice long grind, bypassing herblore entirely is bad game design.
---
Hit me up in game. i'm at infernal eels until 99 fishing so i'm afk a bunch but always down for a chat, RSN Abzynthe. Always looking for new people to chill with :)
---
Don't try it
---
Sure, but that requires level 75 slayer and the stats to kill the Grotesque Guardians, and even then its only about 1/16 droprate. This is way easier to grind with lower requirements.
---
It's so prevalent there's a wiki page on it.  Have you actually played this game for more than a week?

Also certain monsters take up more than 1 space, so if you aren't standing in certain spots they can block each other from hitting you and you'll log out
---
Also you can transition to C# quite easily.
---
A guy named phials in rimmingotn unnotes noted items for a small go fee, he had loads of food noted and a cash stack, unnoted the food so he had unlimited food to out eat the fog
---
Hilarious that you think that people in Cambridge have to be paid shit because they live outside of California. If their product makes money, they should get some. Why pay so many dividends to investors? All they do is shit on the game by asking for partnerships and MTX.
---
What amazes me is how smart and profound you think you are.
---
Yikes
---
Mechanically it's really easy, the hard part is not getting nervous about losing an hour of progress then fucking up once and dying.
---
Personally, I think it's easier to pray based on the sounds rather than visuals.  Leave protect from range on, only switch when you hear the magic sound then switch back to range after it hits you.
---
reported
---
At some point earlier, players were able to glitch their end of the game to where it made it look like you were in places you couldn't normally be. 
---

---
Gamers show their age when they post nonsense that like upvoted post (based on information that is 100% unreliable unless it’s coming from a dev themself). Gaming companies are not non-profits &amp; they pay what they do to obtain the talent they need. 
---
They’re not going to blow out the market value of java devs or whatever it is in the UK (which is a low salary area across the board in comparison to the US) because some teenagers on reddit think they should.
---
[The Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Big_shark) at the least mentions nothing of minnows. I'd imagine you can not get it from minnows.
---
I'm so glad I started playing this year with runelite being a godsend and not dealing with all that controversy and bullshit.
---
right, dont understand how he doesnt see it pfft
---
Clearly.
---
Woah, we got a badass over here! 😅
---
So?
---
Every single player: "Oh nice a bonesack!! This would be perfect for... Wait. Cosmetic?"
---
Its ok for first year in a lcol area. Other than that, not really
---
Unsure to as why it does not match up. You can't extend task that don't have the option to be extended so I'm unsure of the pricing.
---
No, you have to manually catch sharks for a chance.
---
Such an awesome brewery. Have you been to their others spots? They have one near SD that is in an old naval barracks and a nice "hidden" bar in Oside.
---
I think if it had a bit more depth it would pop a lot more!
---
 **🦀**  **🦀**  **🦀**  **🦀**  **🦀**  **🦀**  **🦀**

Can get a new one from her, also if you have ring of charos or w/e. It's a varrock task to pick the colour of your next kitten. So best to do that task while getting a new kitten.
---
Nothing much lmao
---
What is this rare pink guy footage?
---
Lmao thats like 160k xp from 1 spin... sad
---
Yes!!! with only 75 attack you have to expect a crappy shotgun. I TIRED MY BEST &lt;/3
---
Not sure about this one 
---
With overloads and full obby and necklace (but just 89 str) I only get like 74k xp an hour
---
This looks better
---
I grinded out the last bit of 99 HP because your comment inspired me to [give it a half-ass try.](https://v.redd.it/bji8nnbkny831)
---
Or delete RS3 and make OSRS the main game, nobody plays that shit anyways
---
Stop crying about something I don’t understand?  What a stupid comment lol. If that was the case than you’d prefer that people don’t have opinions on 90% of the shit that goes on. I see this problem, and I’m frustrated. I don’t see it getting any better. But sorry, since I don’t understand it I’ll just go fuck myself.
---
Ever seen do something that WILD before? I have already made arrangements to play the shirt rip on repeat at my funeral. #EPIC
---
Well for 30?- was it 30? Uh for doing nothing 30k seems ok. Idk the rate. I think that's a euro :(
---
Are you a developer? Couldn't help but notice your use of !=
---
I think having a few brews before the first mm/jad/zulrah/ds2 is a really big deal, just to name a few.

Only, this one won't send you to the hospital. :\^)

Trust me brotha i never started the occupation! lol. I am 25 and drink maybe one beer a month, id have a terrible retirement
---
I make $18k
---
goat piss in a can...yes my friend, you are right
---
rip in peace? rest in peace in peace?
---
S
---
How much does your food cost over there
---
Ya i get that, sometimes it can look ridiculous (bet you've seen a few odd fashion-scapes yourself) but they dont take away from main items and for the most part there is legitimate ways to get them ie. Clue scrolls quest and events. Some of them even are a bit costly which i would like to see more of. I think expensive cosmetics show status like a symbol, example 3rd age. I know some people dont like expensive cosmetics because of the rs3 partyhat being 12billion gold but its a status symbol for a reason. Ima stop before i digress
---
A lot? Idfk lol
---
Use the cat to eat the hell rats get the spice make the stew feed the dude. I had a kitten and it took like two hours.
---
I mean, its the best pickaxe in the game so I'm sure if people don't have one. Yes they will buy it for this update. Every player should own one tbh. Why wouldn't you?
---
Holy hell then yeah absolutely runecraft
---
Pretty sure it was the 2nd dmm but the point stands
---
Followed by "YOU'RE ACTUALLY TROLLING. SHOW ME YOUR REAL WEAPON. YOU'RE JOKING. SHOW ME YOUR REAL WEAPON."
---
In wow the end goal isn’t max level tho, its upgrading gears. In rs one of the longest grinds is the level grind.
---
Hey jeans
---
Cool to who? If i saw someone open their beer with their teeth like a chimpanzee my first thought defiently wouldn't be "wow, look at that cool dude"
---
I understand having a few unique items but I’m mostly concerned about cosmetics that don’t match the theme of the game. I’m all for the gold defender, gold chef hat, etc. but those aren’t even expensive.
---
Yeah they just want to keep sucking ironmans metal cock and pump out updates that benefit nobody but ironmen.
---
I was able to sign into my iron man and ultimate iron man but not my main.
---
We are free?
---
48,500 is my salary
---
Fuck Delta Chi
---
Geez just jumping at the bit to complain about something.
---
30k Is not particularly high for cambridge, I just got a development job in the cambridge science park (Where jagex is based) and am being paid 34k as a graduate.. 30k is not good for the area.
---
or he really loves the game?
---
No, they've said it creates a huge amount of extra work as everything would have to be graphically designed twice
---
Do dragon slayer for the def xp, and work on range.
---
Its a flatpack for the Greenmans ale hotspot in the Kitchen of your POH.
---
Ok. That's now how the first comment comes off, but you're right. There is a safety net for major issues. There are still payments after you hit your deductible, though. Varies plan to plan.
---
Can confirm, i just got a job in a company basically right next to jagex, and am being paid 34k as a graduate.
---
Nope. New account or live with it. Hopefully you didn’t get too far.
---
99 hp: Alright

Beer shotgun: 9/10
