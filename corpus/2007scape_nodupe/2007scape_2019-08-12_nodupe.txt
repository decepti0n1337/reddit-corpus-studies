They talk about their player retention ideas and its stupid shit like making early game easier, those changes won't make the difference for anyone, it'll just give bots a more optimal route to whatever they're trying to accomplish.

---
This right here though is a real suggestion, anyone playing on a 2560x1440 or a 4k monitor will open the game up, see it takes up about 1/10th of their screen and just close out of it, unless ofcourse they have a friend to tell them about 3rd party clients (sad).

Better than "Go outside - love jagex" (This message was seriously in game around 2010 after getting 99 all.

This meme use to be osrs mobile in the mirror :)
---
I think it was a fair trade. Emblems are now around 60k about half of what they were at IIRC. The average loot for the new keys is over 100k. Even with slower drop rates they should even out.
---
I think this helps combat emblem farmers as it was a huge problem and they have effectively cut the costs in half while still making wildy slayer profitable.

Snake charm can be re-acquired from Ali the snake charmer in pollnivneach. Bonesack can be re-obtained from the weird old man west of paterdomus. Ogre bellows can be re-obtained by looting the chest in Rantz's cave in the feldip hills.

Coming from an ex-NEET its hard to even wake up and not sleep 16 hours a day. Wake up. Play game. Maybe edge myself 3-4 hours. Pass out. Wake up. Drink 8 monsters. Feel tired because dehydrated. Go back to sleep. Play game. Lurk reddit / 4chan. I'd trade my family for that life because its no responsibility though. Good 2 years of nothingness 2010-2012.

I usually just pray melee and piety and punch the double agent to death. There's an altar right where you do the clue step so you don't need to worry about running out of prayer. With only 70s for combat stats you might prefer to bring along some unfinished darts+feathers, but it isn't necessary at all.
---
In 3, 2, 1..
---
It's already atrocious enough that it had the accuracy bonus of a rapier that comes from the hardest teamwork-oriented content in the game. Zero fucking support. Sounds like your broke ass just wants a cheapshot overpowered weapon that anyone could use tbh.
---
 Thats the thing, i did. Everytime i read carefully what they want and try to provide the stuff they ask but yet again being denied. This is why i have no clue anymore and feeling kinda hopeloess as it feels that they just deny my recovery anyways. As of right now they mentioned:   
---
"When you created the account (MM/YYYY)  
---
If you have moved state/country, (let us know from where to where)  
---
Creation Country (Country + State if you're appealing from the US)  
---
Creation and most recent ISP (Internet Service Provider - for example BT, Virgin, Comcast, SBC etc.)  
---
Any additional information which you cannot enter elsewhere in the form (for example multiple transaction ID numbers for your billing)"  
---
But i already provided them multiple times with different transaction ID's for example.   
---
I provided my old ISP and recent ISP with IP. The ISP the account was created on went under and was bought by another company. I don't know if my IP has changed due that situation, nor do i remember the old one if it has been changed from so many years ago.   
---
I'm still in the same country, same adress, same state. I litterly have a creation e-mail with the exact date inside my mail which i provided the date from.   
---
This is why i have no idea what to do next and i just gave up on the recovery already because it feels pointless. It's also alot of work and time searching everything, going through bank statements, password logs, using my brain to dig old info which is from 9+ years ago while in the meantime i could make a picture of my face holding my own passport if i want to and attach it as a file to proof i'm the actual owner. I mean if a account gets recovered over 4 times with different bunch of information and yet you still deny it. I just don't know what you want from me anymore in that situation, it feels horrible actually. It also makes me that frustrated that i get in a bad mood about it and ruin the peace at home. It's just a anoying headache right now and it doesn't look good unfortunately.
---
Rapier is +94 stab, not slash. It only has +55 slash. So in situations where the enemy has sizeably better stab defence than slash defence, the whip should produce higher DPS than the rapier despite the strength bonus difference.
---
Could also be the OP saying "H" to flag this as humour.
---
he said on stream he has like 700-800m xp on rs3
---
Lynx titan not zezima lmao.
---
Hans Zimmer music too, epic
---
How much would that cost on a ironman?
---
Pretty sure. He went homeless so he could continue to no-life rs3 outside of a library using public wifi. I have a friend who was probably 6th or so to 200m agility, and she told me some pretty cringe things about him.
---
Well, it has about 200 rings, and the ones I could find here were pretty expensive. Filament is pretty cheap so the material costs now are like 10 bucks max. I already have my own 3D printer so that's no issue. Plus, now the plastic itself is immediately the right color. If I had to paint them, they would scuff and lose the color pretty quickly, because of all the rings rubbing together.
---
GWD are much more worth killing than KQ, garg and thermy lol. Using scythe at KQ would be actively losing money, so its not 'better' really. Tbow at GWD only improves it.
---
&gt;If you're going by "worth killing" then only tob is worth doing (all other moneymakers are shit compared), and it just happens so that scythe is huge there.
---
Inferno is more important content, and a tbow is way better there.

It was great! Thank you so much for the smoll boi too! c: You and Lilly are great! Love ur vids too!! &lt;3

This is perfect.

no, it requires extra clicks to fill pouches without closing the bank interface. you can set up mousekeys to make this easier, but that's really if you're going for maximum efficiency, and I generally just close the interface to fill pouches

Think about the people that brown nose to get a mod position in his chat. They likely spend huge amounts of time in a chat, watching a streamer play video games, for close to 10 hours a day.

It is still going on in Warframe too lol, the players being the voice in these two communities causes a rustle for awhile but it simmers down because at the end of the day it isn't actually what is a core issue in the game in the grand scheme.

Yes, he did get a message from the game: "You have a brief urge to cook some food." instead of any of the standard messages which correspond to a skill. Then he went, fished and cooked and ate a shrimp, seemingly nothing happened, then he went to do a master clue got a 1 step clue.

Not in the slightest.
---
Max was 11.5k
---
Oh yeah of course. Thats how Im so confused on how they got through. Must be some crazy shit, maybe through Runelite?
---
10 numbers we could assume 10^4 but since it doesn’t matter where the first number is, it would be 10^3... so presumably 1/1000.
---
It’s not lag, it’s your pic losing frames.

If you want one that bad just go get 99 cooking, there's no loss from it but hardly any gain compared to other 99s

Let's see.
---
I think I got you, if you mean fundamental changes that affect everyone, not just added content, there are a few I can think of off the top of my head.
---
* On death outside the wilderness, your tradeable items stay on the ground for an hour visible only to you and you keep your untradeable ones (there are some wonky exceptions but this is the general rule)
---
* Players can buy items called bonds from jagex that can be redeemed for 14 days of membership, and players can trade bonds with each other (for something like 4m right now)
---
* Multi-logging is allowed and common, as long as you don't use a clone army to give your side a big advantage in minigames. Lots of people have a second account that basically serves as an afk goldfarmer to help fund their main.
---
* Casual account sharing is also common and the osrs team turns a blind eye to it (except if someone other than the original owner completes the inferno, which is basically fight caves on steroids if the steroids were on steroids). However if this results in the other person taking your account you're boned, and selling accounts is still not allowed.

Wouldn't you enjoy that "Bored_Bottle" How about you enlighten me? You seem to be faking who you are on here so much.
---
No for both questions. I'd recommend going through each widget and see what they do if you can't figure it out by reading their names.
---
I recommend you turn on Idle Notifications so it'll notify you when whatever you're doing stops. Check out the widget called "RuneLite" for more notification settings like "Sned notifications when focused".

Ding, ding, ding, we have a winner.

To be honest the only place I’ve ever found the SGS useful was at DK’s to extend trips in between food drops. Even that was niche enough that I couldn’t justify keeping it.

"just hire more people" is a very rudimentary understanding of the problem and workload this creates. Especially when as far as I'm concerned (from everyone I chat to and play with) it's not an update all or even a lot of people would use.
---
Plenty of people like the graphics of old-school Runescape. You don't. And that's fine, but it doesn't make them shit.
---
It's the same way minecraft is an amazing game that has an art style that I still like. It's 16x16 sprites in pixel art. Hardly modern or "good" yet its great. You assumably don't share that opinion because it's not trying to be as realistic and as high end graphically as possible.

Comfortable to play when you're doing homework. I don't know how o could've made it through some courses if I didn't have virtual fishing to chill me out
---
Nostalgia of courses but being able to actually succeed in the game after playing as a kid
---
1000s of things to do. Other mmos start to suck when you realize what you're doing now, you will do that or two other things for the rest of the time you play
---
Polling. Community driven game is actually incredible. If we ever get mad at Jagex it's likely the balancing of the content and not the content itself
---
Not sure exactly what you are saying, but I'm guessing you think that adding GPU Rendering would be a negative for some users? It should only use GPU Rendering if your computer can support it; if not it would still run same as it does now. But even a decade-old system should still be able to benefit from this and it wouldn't lock you out of future updates. They aren't going to make the game run better just so they can make new content that runs worse...
---
Hard morytania diary for barrows
---
1200 days playtime. Wtf. That's 4 years. Omg.
---
Same happened to me. 36 agility btw. That quest was rough.
---
Is there any way to learn it on OSRS website? Or mandatory to do talk that dude in castle.
---
I especially like Cox on extra hard mode
---
F2P is definitely balanced, no doubt. The idea is to keep that balance but refresh it with new goals that players need to strive for. The goals in OSRS as we know can be related to skilling, PvMing, PvPing which we categorize depending on which will give us the greatest rewards. Some prefer PvMing that would give them access to new items that they can then use in Skilling or PvPing while others feel the reward when unlocking "new content" through the other methods. Keeping a balance of what currently exists and what should be released as an upgrade is tough. Yet it adds a very interesting factor to the game where you can motivate players to accomplish something only because they want to "unlock" the other thing. By having this multi-connected system of goals/rewards you can maintain satisfaction in multiple aspects of the game.

Yeah I just find it odd how little people are talking about this. Surely it's a relatively small fix? Just relegate all of the "options" buttons to one side the "Game" options to the other I'd have thought.

---
Back when they were doing the original skilling pets, they mentioned how they were basing it on actions per hour instead of exp so that faster methods wouldn't be a faster pet (e.g. so willow logs aren't way faster pet rate than magic logs). That said, there is still a fair bit of variance between methods.
---
But if they were to add a Firemaking Skilling Pet, since all fires light at the same speed it would make sense if the pet chance was the same regardless of the type of log you use. So it wouldn't need to have the more expensive logs give a better pet chance but you would still need more supplies than with the current pet skills, which would mess with prices.
---
the boots are the best part of this

Theres 2 ways to get through a pin.

1. To know it (by any various means)

2. To disable it and wait the 7 days for it to roll off

You said you took a 2 month break and the pin was removed. That means they did option 2. If it was option 1, the pin would still be active.

I may test that out but in challenge mode the stats are buffed up. I've heard of a lot of people restarting in max gear if they missing both dwh specs because of how bad it is even post nerf of Tekton's defense. I'll give it a shot and see if it is do able though.

Hopefully. Why would any dumb idiot put a 1B item in at 1 coin? You can instant sell by putting it at 800M. or 900M (probably even 1B) Not worth the risk of potentially having only one offer open at the time for an obscenely low amount.

Maybe I’m misunderstanding and you’re asking if you should get 70 defense for piety or just wait til it comes along during natural progression? Piety’s a great prayer. Getting two levels now versus in a little bit won’t make too much of a difference in the long run so don’t stress too much :)
---
He really should put a few more incremental updates out..
---
lol why would he play when he can't gain anymore exp? that's the definition of an exp waste
---
^^/s

Now I'm going to cry :(

Oreo the Chicken always said: "don't just warm your eggies, warm people's hearts as well". She just wants the world to smile so if someone laughs because of their joke, she would support 100% because it makes the world happier

Why are adamantite crossbow limbs profitable? 
---
All others are super not profitable.
---
ya like maybe if i was bossing but even then im rly not risking anything lol.
---
Lol yeah I saw that a couple days ago on GE Tracker, I always figured shit like this was an error in the API, but something similar happened with the Twisted Bow on GE Tracker

i have those exact jeans from amazon

update. quest cape back 🤘
---
why did it take someone 2 years to get this? if lynx was the first 2 years ago. No motivation since rank 1 is already gone?
---
Thought you couldn't get task until after beating normally?
---
yeah but it looks cool
---
no i wont
---
This one
---
ELI5 that I have an offer in for a tbow at 10k and this buy offer filled first?
---
This just makes me sad. It’s an incredible milestone and he really deserves the congratulations. That much determination and will power towards anything is insane. But to think how much time he spent solely on this game, with little or no real human interaction during that time. It just makes me sad to think about. I hope I’m wrong and he just really loves it that much. From my perspective it just seems like a lonely way to live.
---
Fighter torso definitely on the list. Would really like to get swan song done at some point, but I'd also like to get WC up because I want to try out different combat GP grinds like ents, plus WC is probably my favorite skill.
---
I have played for long time and I will never get fighter torso or void
---
Wtf this is the second post of a cheap asf tbow
---
Did u do combat quest? Waterfall? Etc I finished mm2 today the grind is almost over
---
"idk what ur saying lol"
---
How dare you stand where he stood. Perish.
---
Also, only use pots retroactively, not proactively. You can get kills without copping a venom hit.
---
nice life lmao loser

Hahahahahahahaha
---
Song of the elves
---
Thanks I actually had it for a long while from back at Uni when I wasn't able to play as much, finally got to put the full set on today.
---
this is actually the greatest trade deal in history
---
Good luck trying to find it without my attack style.
---
Marvelous
---
Excuse me what the fuck? 
---
But isnt the chance for it like 1/100 bil or something ridiculous
---
Right? I'm a trial and error learner and after 3 deaths to the Jungle Demon earlier I've learned why quest order can be important.
---
Tekton is always first in challenge mode so if you miss a spec you just restart.
---
Only for melee/magic though iirc
---
Ds2, elite void, salve ammy (ei). Try out vorkath or rune dragons for gp after ds2 completion.
---
He can't really put any other videos out since all he is doing is hunting imps atm. I guess he could start smithing or training another skill AFK whilst hunting for imps on main, if he wanted to save time....
---
H-h-he did it. He beat the game.
---
nearly 500kc with no uniques... all of my hate.
---
Possible explanation: some dude sells 3 t bows in one GE slot, first 2 sell and get him just shy of max cash. 3rd one then sells to highest offer that won't put him over max cash (in this case 13 gp)

Q
---
No, those are the uniques on the drop table for all of medium clues.  So, each of those items have different drop rates (some are more common than others) but the boots are roughly 1/252-1/400 depending on how many items your clue rolls.  For example, I believe each clue can have 3-5 items.  So if you rolled 3 items every clue (the least amount) it would be harder to get them, so 1/400.  But if you roll 5 (the highest amount) every time then you are more likely to get it so it would be 1/252.  Sorry for the over-explanation :).
---
Dude you a goblin slayer?

I'm trying to peer-pressure my wife into playing with me. I found her trying to melee ducks.

Is trading gp for coochie considering rwt?
---
Yeah, I said I was clutching at staws, but I do not think you have any aggressive elves anymore.
---
they don't compete with each other, people using magic seeds don't just plant one patch, they plant all tree patches, and all fruit patches too because the objectice is min:maxing time:xp gains.
---
Your bet is so bad I'll bet magic seeds are gonna surge from year lows now that farming levels are more useful than ever.
---
Nope
---
Makes sense, but at the same time doesn't.  
---
If he gets the RCB from an impling, would he still pay out other people who find Lucky Implings after the RCB? If he doesn't do that, it would be a red flag saying someone won the jackpot already.
---
Thanks for the reply anyway! :-)
---
I would just wanna shake the hand of god ash. That’s all.
---
I get your point but thats not what a NEET is
---
NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training) are people that dont contribute anything to society, the farmers youre talking about are contributing too much to society if anything
---
i literally cannot see whats going on. why the need for so much opaque smoke? takes away the beauty of it
---
this is why you ALSO get an inferno max cape and keep it in your inventory when you wear fire max cape. and then when they pipe up bust it out and flex on those sweaty shitsitting nerds.
---
If your incentive plan for future game content are pets we should be thankful you're nobody.

Is having a low cash stack bad? I have 1.4k total level but my cash stack is never even close to a mil (usually it’s about 100k). And my total bank value is only 12 mil which also seems low. What am I doing wrong?
---
I agree with this\^\^\^ (not really tho :P)
---
Nice.
---
He could make a video about this entire debacle. Starting the fund, featuring huge donations, hunting with the community, and seeing what’s its like from his perspective would be cool.

[Bank your goddamn items.](https://youtu.be/e-mWJjOPE6A)

On this, I've actually placed an order on two accounts for different prices. I've noticed that on occassion the one with the lower price actually buys before the one on the higher price, neither of the accounts were on buy limits
---
B gloves and 99 Prayer. Just hit 93 Prayer tonight.
---
Thei'yrere
---
Not how the game works, it won't let you put in an offer like that. Probably sold it to himself using an alt in however manner they do that.
---
It needs to take the biggest offer between current cash and max cash to fullfill the sell offer. 
---
So if a idiot sold like 10 bows in 1 trade screen in might be possible. 
---
It sells them one after another always searching for best possible offer. (Ofc that means the seller put them all up for 1gp each)
---
On my way to buy your gf
---
Oldest offer gets filled first. 
---
Person 1 has an active offer for 1 gp for a very long period.
---
Person 2 has an offer at double the g.e. value, that just got posted.  
---
Situation 1: Item gets put up for 1 gp =&gt; Person 1 gets the item, because it's the oldest offer and offers enough gp.
---
Situation 2: Item gets put up for 2gp =&gt; Person 2 gets the item, because it's the oldest offers that also offers enough gp.
---
Go to world 416. Make a party, advertise you're doing learner ffas. Specify a world you get better ping on if its an issue for you, to find others that are okay with that world. If not, stay in 416.

Put in the time to learn and wipe together. Get your first completion.

Don't tilt, don't blame others for wipes, focus on learning and improving your own game. Have fun.

Watch v the victims tob guide before even bothering with learner ffas. Have anyone you do it with watch it before as well.

HE WAS A FOOKIN LEGEND IN FALADOR ALLEY
---
Something similar happened with elys years ago when someone dumped like 7 in one ge slot. Whoever did this sold at least 5 tbows in the same slot. Two of them sold for the right amount so about 1016m each and the rest of them went to whoevers offers came the closest to closing the gap to 2147m.
---
i wonder if there will be a race when a new skill comes
---
1440p monitor and can confirm. I wouldn’t be able to play without RuneLite GPU to make things look pretty.
---
You can't place a sell order for more than max cash and you can't take money out of the g.e. if you already have max cash in your inventory.
---
okay dude
---
Private server
---
lmao that guy is salty.
---
I've had an offer in for 1m since CoX was released, there's no way I'm the only person, I'm definitely not the highest bid, there's also no way you got it for 13gp
---
uhh i got 2 at once and it kinda glitched and it wouldnt let me open the 2nd one / the 2nd one just opened normally
---
I'm still getting this problem connecting using my internet.. pretty shit if i can only login using phone without wifi..
---
Not necessarily, his sold at a little over 1, after all that guy's sold, so it could be around 1b 70m for two bows, then the scraps go to him right?
---
Having access to your email is not 100% 'control of your account'.  
---
Even if I posted my email right now (which as you mentioned looking through the person comments etc), no one would honestly really do, if they had access to my email, they would lock my account, and that's it.  
---
Even if I didn't have access to my email or account, I could still recover it 100%, because I know all the details. Your recovery pretty much gets denied if you can't even hand over a transaction ID or previous passwords.  
---
Someone who has 'wealth' is going to secure their account no matter what.  
---
Emails come with 2-step authenticator now and even trying to change a password of something (i.e. paypal), even that's protected too.  
---
You're honestly stupid. Do you just listen to memes on this sub or something?
---
Thank you for the constructive criticism! I'll try to keep the wisps down next time 😂
---
86 agility, so I can kill Kq with out blowing my brains outs. Also just finish elite desert diary.
---
This is actually a blessing. This just means your rng is being reserved somewhere else. Go TOB or COX, pretty sure you’ll get scythe,tbow af very low kc
---
seems fake af u cant flex that only be happy about it for urself if true if not srsly reflect on ur social issues if u need to come up with this cooked bs for attention
---
Kek
---
I know this girl it’s a no go she plays RS3
---
I was super skeptical but it’s kinda believable.
---
As I understand it, the seller sold 3+ tbows at once. They put them in at 1gp.
---
The first two sold for 1,073,500,000, for 2,147,000,000 total. A single slot can only contain max cash, so the third one could only sell for at most 483,647. So if OP’s offer was the highest offer below that specific amount, he’d get it. For a 13 gp offer to win I’m sure the first two would need to be very close to max cash though.
---
I’m still skeptical, but it’s believable
---
This is how kids in rehab get drunk
---
I’m not gonna lie, Chinese replica sneakers are fantastic.
---
I'll search so much stuff about osrs such as quests, achievement diarys, leveling guides etc that when it comes to searching for other stuff that's irrelevant to osrs I add osrs at the beginning.
---
Happy birthday.  I'll steal a chocolate cake for you
---
yikes i fucking hate attentionwhores who post about this bs on reddit big yikes
---
Awesome, really like the "frosty" aura it gives off, hope you're going to make the other GWD bosses and really curious how they would turn out!

But she ain’t messing with no seercull bwanas.

Wow. Grats MMK

Mat K gets an even better deal on tbows!

Nice going through my profile. Might I say you are the clown

Drop 5 mil and find out

I hit three procs in a row of ruby for Vorkath, it was insane. All 100 hits too.

Wow!

It takes an.... interesting mind  to look at this subreddit and think, "Hrrrrrm... There isn't any boring screenshots of a chat log of someone being mildly toxic on the best posts of all time. I'm sure if I do this It'll be so original and impress everyone and I'll get all the updoots."
---
Tbh the chance of him finding a lucky imp by himself is really low, so it'll likely be someone else.
---
Same as OP. Did the quest and never re-visited makeover mage. Not intentional but just dont care which gender my character is.
---
Holy shit
---
Lmao, this is too fucking good, very nice
---
Thanks, I didn't realize there was an altar right there.
---
New money making method?
---
Thanks, I might still do the bow since I will be wearing black d'hide.
---
Yeah I think that is also possible. Would be hard to do if not your account though, or you would assume at least.
---
Got your HP level, thanks for the account.
---
If you're planning to do slayer for a while, buy a black mask and imbue it at nightmare zone, the extra damage and accuracy % will be highly noticeable
---
If it was me id still rather have the slayer task and helm for the extra damage, defence aint going to help you much against jad
---
If a new skills comes*
---
C
---
Do it yourself, make it the newest mat k does _____ post. 
---
Have his stream cam overlay ontop of your rs screen going to the ge, puttin in an offer for 9001 tbows at 1gp each and it fulfilling, then him saying something in excitement or something.
---
The GE literally won't let you put in an offer like that.

https://gyazo.com/584a8c616eba089dfb683caa61b5871a
---
This guys is asking questions on the daily advice thread about how to train a skill. I can promise you he doesn't have the cash to train defense with chins at 72 ranged
---
Yeah that's the only time I've got sub 1min on vorkath. RNG is OP
---
99 smithing you can make rune 2h's. its 400k and hour
---
Either a trident setup, or you can alternatively go with a Dragon sword (weak to stab) and D'hide. Id use a defender +super antifires. Dont use protect from magic, your defence is 42 and your magic is 99 meaning you have a higher base magic defence. I would personally flinch-hit the dragons with protect from ranged on to avoid melees altogether.
---
The new crystal axe.
---
What do you mean? I just started playing again recently I’m 498 on f2p
---
Damn. Hope some Venezuelan gets it.
---
That’s an interesting exaggeration there.
---
If it’s not fake, I’d hold off on using it for anything or skilling much until you can ask a Jmod to verify it’s not one that was bugged into the game somehow. Just in case.
---
why are you snitching on somebody dming you loser

Nope, see my edit. I made a mistake.

---
Tulio and Miguel! Mighty and powerful gods.
---
As much as I'm against rwt his messaging u personally so your obviously mates why u going to just expose him great mate u are I'ma add him and tell the lad
---
&gt;But being at that playtime with 20m slayer and 1700 total is less respectable than being well rounded at 2k+ imo.
---
for sure, just the way that he said he "feels like shit" having 6k hours and being 2k total made me assume he would be going for max
---
lol nerd
---
It’s sad that not a lot of people get the reference and just start speaking to me in Spanish
---
I for one appreciate PK'ers that get me at the chaos altar. Makes it much faster to get back to the bank.
---
For real though black d'hide is retarded. It's way too strong. I shouldn't be able to use 23 bones on the altar with nothing but one brew and black d'hide top and bottom while a tribrid boy is attacking me non-stop.
---
Jealousy

Were you a teachers pet in school?

&gt;Feels just like yesterday he failed jad..

... and the day before that, and the day before that, and the day before that.

Why the fuck do posts like these keep making front page. Everyone and their mother has done MM1.
---
Gotta say. Trying this right now and oh my. over 3m str xp in few days. I will get 90atk 99str by end of my bond.
---
Get membership, do nightmare zone while you can on your phone(you can AFK train for 5-10 mins and won’t log out for 20 if you don’t die) or train slayer. Get some new quests done like dragon slayer 2 and song of the elves. Best gp in the game. Zulrah is good too but requires a lot of practice.
---
who
---
The downvotes on these comments are actually insane to me. I really just don't understand why this subreddit seems to hate PKers and the Wilderness so much. I bet these same people mass downvoting are probably the same ones that cried about the Wilderness removal.
---
Graceful 2
---
Why is there a tank parked outside of the Jagex building on Google Maps?
---
Agreed, so many of these clowns haven't even unlocked or seen half of the game and are crying that theres a lack of content to do
---
Even at max theres still challenging content which is impressive for this click based game
---
With such a pick up line, 100% guaranteed
---
Unlike lynx titan, just 200m log off never play or talk to anyone again. 
---
Dudes my hero.
---
the shitty video quality makes this even better
---
Depending on how your bank is looking you should probably look to either do vorkath if you’re broke or zulrah if you have a bit of cash to get some gear started. Definitely grind out elite void and do some questing and the money rolls in at either of those bosses.
---

Who the fuck has that much time on their hands lol
---
Hahaha haha. WOW.
---
Id take a look at some of the new quests. The latest one song of the elves thats just been added, ds2 and mm2. Then maybe train your ranged and magic up a bit and start doing zulrah for gp?
---
&gt;I mean yeah.  Youre calling this guy pathetic for his reaction
---
The thing i found funny that by complaining he perpetuates the cycle of which he is complaining.
---
And i wouldn't go as far as pathetic.
---
&gt;(for some reason we're keeping up the charade of 3rd person)

He said later he probably had done some steps on it before. It wasn't some weird glitch
---
Mep2 handholds are stupidly easy now, do it before they revert it.
---
I guess Shroud isn't the only gamer with a fat cock
---
Hope you're doing fine, it sucks losing a pet :(
---
Its totally plausable if he has the oldest offer for a tbow in. I could totally see jagex grabbing a list of all buy offers &gt;= the asking price for the sale, and then sorting by date and grabbing the oldest by offer to make the match.
---
Nah they just drop in large quantities from bosses.
---
It wasn't rng, he got 200m thieving before the pet...
---
I think he should have been sent to repair instead of my phone tbh

No it's not.

Sounds goos. Maybe you could also increase your combat skills through certain methods of punishment, if your picking up what I'm putting down.

I remember this by 2277 ÷ 99 = 23. Idk why I can't fucking remember that there's 23, but this sanity check always works.

Hey man he just found a more efficient way to craft death runes

It is made up, fake. I had an offer in for 1005 since 2 days ago, I am pretty sure I would get it first, but I didnt obviously.

He said on stream that his main regret was not doing 6h guthans

Just do some quests. You need 7qp, or 24 hours play time, to sell some stuff. Cooks assistant (1qp), sheep sheerer (1qp), and Goblin Diplomacy (5qp) will get you it and they’re all just bringing stuff to someone
---
Yeah, sure.
---
Imagine if people weren't as dumb as you.
---
It’s a lot more fun than cutting trees and mining rocks all day
---
Doesn't the GE tracker track the highest and lowest price a given item is sold for in a day?  So in a few hours when it updates can't we verify?
---
Wow ok Mr rich man, sheesh just rub it in
---
That does help! Thanks for your time :)!
---
What if he actually sold it to himself
---

For the boss if you get a decent BGS spec then pretty much just focus on your movement and watch when your prayer drops and he's a piece of piss.

What’s the current meta for boosting slayer points? I’ve just got a dark claw from Skotizo, but I only have about 100 points. Currently 87 slayer and am at around 315 streak if that matters. Don’t really want to do wildy if I can avoid it as I play a lot on my way to work and I get shit signal.
---
You’re real tough over the internet, why don’t you come say that to me irl and we’ll see who’s laughing
---
zulrah.
---
Cocks usually love a good grind. Wonder if he got some decent chicken meat though.
---
I don't think we really need to but yeah that will be the proverbial nail.
---
Tits'
---
didn't they have a tank?
---
You dont need rune mysteries for rc
---
Well we've all made mistakes. Clearly the person just wasnt thinking about it, but Its just a lesson to price your offers at prices youre willing to lose it at.
---
I equipped my new D Scimmy on Ape Atoll... got stacked by monkey archers.
---
Now what if the dude running away says "dont I'm a hcim btw" and you see his red ironhelm sign.... do you take the mans hc or let him run free?
---
Yeah, I had an offer for 1005m since 2 days ago, it's still in and didn't buy, ofc.
---
It may be a trap, but what if it's not?

Just a note, you won't find a team of learners who are happy to hop to aus worlds. You're going to have to learn on 416. There are a few people who will take low KC teams on 416 (I do one or two low KC raids every night) so you've got a chance of getting a bit of a boost, but it's not super common (most won't take people with 0kc).
---

what is your bank!

Rule of large numbers, thats not how it works.
---
Bonds killed my family
---
I like to insult them as they kill me at chaos altar when ive got no bones left haha
---
No I am not assuming anything, I am telling you how the grand exchange system works. If someone puts an item in for 13gp or below 13gp, and this guys offer is the next in line he will win that offer. If someone offers 1.2b it will fulfil that offer and that guy will be waiting, but as soon as someone puts an offer in matching this guys price or below and he’s next in line, he will win this offer. 
---
Whether this post is real or not I couldn’t care less, I’m just explaining how the system works to people who don’t understand it.
---
Would love to see some numbers on this, comparing the priff course to seers with hard diary done and at what level it makes sense to switch, xp wise

It will die twice.

Specifically, afaik you have an equal chance to roll each clue tier (not beginner) then the regular chance of rolling the unique table. Settled needs to hit the elite tier of rewards then it's a ~1/30, meaning it should, on average, take about 150 lucky implings to get an RCB.

I needed more than one trip just to do the handholds

Reasons like this that I'd like the levels up to 120. Even if only cosmetically. Feels bad gaining a ton of 99.

Shit, this made me laugh a lot. Thanks.

Usually girls get better and more choices in games to distinguish how they look. Like the crystal armour set looks really cute with a skirt and high boots. But on a guy it just looks like blue armour with a texture. I guess that could be seen as sexual still but I really don't have any other reason.

I just came back to playing since 2006ish and I remember pvp being a lot less click intensive. Was the addition of hot keys the reason why pvpers seem to click like 10 things in a second now? Just wondering when this changed as it's a turn off for me when it comes to pvp. So much more work than before lol.
---
Also, it seems easier to get 99 stats than way back then too. Are most people just botting or is there some other reason why?

Please someone make a brainlet meme wearing a stew bowl now.

This is kind of a weird question. Yeah, you're playing slow and casual, absolutely nothing wrong with that. But at some point you're going to have money on your account and you might as well spend it on something. If you're still a brand-squeaky new account I can see how the 3m price tag on a whip is a bit daunting, but take a breather and believe me when I tell you that it's not. In the early and mid game (basically everything before Barrows Gloves) money is super hard to come by and you might need to spend \~5 hours grinding out something painful like Blast Furnace to get that 3m for a whip.
---
But beyond that, once you can start doing real moneymakers like Barrows you can cut that time nearly in half. If you're planning on doing Slayer, I promise that you will have enough money to afford a whip some day. A single Blue Dragons task is going to drop like 750k at a minimum if you're banking all the bones and hides. Four blue dragon tasks and you're done (and it's a super common task). I have an IRL friend who I *promise* is as casual as you are and he has a 30m account value and a pretty darn good set of melee gear. It took him 10 months to get there, but he got there. 
---
Seriously, unless you are planning on spending your money on something else, like skilling, you'll be able to get your whip and some other good gear with the money that you've accumulated normally.
---
They only talk when celebrating killing new skills in the polls.

No it's real. MMG parked a tank in their lot back when he was CEO, though he's moved on, so the tank probably has as well.

Are Runescape among other unproductive things like TV the \*only\* things a human can do to chill? "Chill" is antonymous to productivity? It's not impossible for a productive hobby to be equally chill and enjoyable. Learning a musical instrument or reading non-fiction are definitely in this vein. And they reap you benefits that Runescape never would. Runescape reaps you \*zero\* benefits apart from killing boredom and passing time in the moment (unless you're the .01% that make a living off Runescape). To call the other hobbies equally useless \*skills\* is comical, because dropping time into a skinner box game hole like Runescape isn't even a skill.
---
If we read non-fiction, play guitar, go hiking, that experience could open a shit load of doors to new experiences and memories. If I play Runescape, I kill time and learn nothing.

Also the average worker doesn't just get home and watch 5 hours of television lmao

Dharocs increases damage based off the health you are missing.  So 1hp with lvl 70 would be 69 missing, 1hp with lvl 99 would be 98 missing.  From what I've read, around hp level 90 is where dharocs starts to out dps max strength and full obby.  So until then use obby.

Somehow I made my character a girl during a quest in Runescape classic yeaaaaaars ago when I played before it was all.. elvish?

all of a sudden every guy on the darn game was trying to hit me up. I started using the typing cheat to just say ''I'm a guy mate'' every 5 mins. it ruined the gameplay.

---
Both questions are mostly answered by the fact that we're now playing this game as adults instead of children. 
---
I have four 99's with over 2k total level. I can promise I didn't bot for a single second, I'm just an adult who is capable of long term goal setting and focused playing. You're damn right that I spent nearly two months of my free time clicking on little fishing spots to get a cape. 
---
There are some new methods that make getting xp faster for some skills, but it's 99% about how we approach the game.
---
Exactly, but my point is the UP doesn't have to suck. And you don't have to just change the game to make it not suck. You could just level up your agility. 
---
This is an important aspect. But this is my personal opinion. Just because the minimum requirement for something is a #. Doesn't mean thats the level you should do it at. You can go bossing with like level  1 melee stats, but should you?  
---
I'm just saying that you aren't forced to do the quest, so it doesn't have to be easier via changing the game.

One option would be to use the jar generator to get 9 jars, then go to Puro and catch the closest 9 implings. Doesn't matter what they are cos you trade them in for 27 more jars. Then go out and catch eclectics with that invent. 
---
It can also be a good idea to open the eclectics as you catch them, stopping only once you get a medium clue. *Then* you fill your invent as much as you can before banking. That way you're really maximising your time hunting.

Yes she was rigged, I didn't do an animation because it got to a point that if a wanted to change something, say move her arm 3° it took around 5 seconds to process, it really slowed down the workflow (my fault tbh because I didn't optimize her at all). The clothes I used another program called marvelous designer, it does all the fabric folds for you and is really great and easy to use. 
---
Some of the models in the scene, like her boots, are actually the in game model of the ranger boots I extracted from the game's files, what I did was use a combination of modifiers to increase the poly count, used that as a base and modeled on top of that, then I uv mapped and exported it to substance painter for the textures. The rest is just practice and a lot of tutorials

Best reply telling him it's a repost by far.

You can't put up an offer to sell items for over max cash, it doesn't let you.

It is better than Bandos in NMZ. Use a fire cape but make sure you use all pieces of the armor, the sword and amulet.

Fully obby is just helm chest legs and weapon. And make sure you use berserker necklace
---
I got d defender in less than 10 kills in the basement, I’m convinced that’s why my barrows runs are cursed
---
Lol if you are going to reply and tell me that it couldn't have been done this way, at least understand how the game works.
---
I said the offer would be to put the tbows in the ge for 1gp each, not 1b each.
---
Also, there is no possible way you can do this to trade an item to your alt. I don't know how you can possibly think this is a feasible explanation if you have used the GE more than once in your life. If he were to put the tbow in the GE for 13 GP, it would've gone to any other offer in the GE first. It prioritizes the highest bidder, and if there are no offers higher than your given price, it will sell at your price. No one would ever use this method of transferring to an alt, that would be simply mind numbingly stupid.
---
If you would like to take a second to understand, I can spell it out a little more for you. What could have happened is as follows:
---
Seller enters 4 tbows in GE for 1gp each, expecting it to sell at normal prices. The seller may expect it to work like this:
---
Game sells 2 tbows for GE price (say 1010m each) He may have thought it would halt his offer with 2020m in the coffer, until he took the money out and it would sell the remaining 2 at best offer (another 2020m).
---
Unfortunately it does not work that way. What would've happened in this scenario is this:
---
Game looks for a buyer for first tbow, sells at 1010m.
---
Current coffer is at 1010m.
---
Game looks for buyer for second tbow, sells at 1010m.
---
Current coffer is at 2020m.
---
Game looks for buyer for third tbow. Game instantly rejects all offers exceeding 127m as it would bring the stack over 2147m.
---
Game finds highest offer which will not exceed 2147m at 126,999,980gp for the third tbow leaving 20gp room left to play with.
---
Current Coffer is at 2,146,999,980‬
---
The game now how has to look for the highest available offer in the GE that will not exceed 2147m, so it would have to be 20gp or less. (I know it isn't exactly 2147m and goes slightly higher, this isn't meant to be exact)
---
The game instantly denies all offers over 20gp for the fourth tbow, and finds that the highest offer without exceeding 2147m is 13gp. The fourth tbow then sells for 13gp.
---
The seller's GE offer would then show that his tbows sold for an average of 536.75m.
---
2 tbows sold for 1010m each
---
1 tbow sold for 126m
---
1 tbow sold for 13gp
---
All leaving the buyer less than max cash, while getting rid of the items for highest possible bidders for each item offered.
---
no it's not lol its like 200
---
Who cares? His in-game name would still be the same, it only changes what you login with, and it can be saved on the client anyways so it isn’t any slower.

Will you as a gaming company ever add a new skill to the game even if the poll fails to hit 75%? I get that having polls and keeping the player base happy all the time keeps a game alive, but at this rate nothing will ever change.

If you have an account created before email logins were a thing then that's your only username option.  If it's public then this happens, though the same with any email login. You're stuck with whatever you started with.

How come that Redberry pies are so cheap? I mean everyone needs one at a certain point in the game for the quest and who is going to make them for 36 gp each? Should be at least 400 gp right?

No, the way im looking at the game isn't a waste of time as long as you have fun/enjoy yourself
---
Didn't Zezima decline all the options Jagex offered him?
---
I would assume so, but I’ve never left a quest at half completion so I wouldn’t know. Try sending a DM to a Mod. They should be able to give you a concrete answer.
---
Got that Dragon Long Ruby Doppler Factory new I see.
---
The trick to getting back into or even keeping interest in runescape is finding something you enjoy. At 110 combat, IMO you haven't even reached most of the fun stuff. Higher tier PvM (Raids, Inferno, etc.) are a nice change of pace from the rest of the game, and pretty fun/challenging. Personally I really like solo chambers... It has a moderate skill floor, but probably the highest skill cap of anything in the game. Hell, I'm just short of 1k solo kc and still see areas where I could improve (Mostly in 4:0, I can do 5 way swaps + prayers, would like to get that up to 7 way swaps, maybe even 9 while unequipping some things for mage).
---
As for HCIM... That's 100% up to you. If you haven't played an ironman before, then it's definitely an experience. A lot of things feel more fulfilling as well (Getting a BCP feels so much better than saving up for and buying a BCP), but that's not without its draw backs. Ironmen spend A LOT more time grinding, even for simple things. Want a brew? For a regular account that's 3k and a trip to the GE. For an Ironman? That's months of farming/collecting herbs, some more farming for toadflax, and obtaining birds nests. Want a glory? That's 15k and a trip to the GE for a normal account. That's months of grinding glass for an ironman. You also have to consider how willing you are to grind. Almost every ironman has that one item that just will not drop for them (L ake with his 3k+ raids kc before tbow, diy maryj with his 2500+ kc without scythe, etc.). For some people this is a good thing because it gives them reason to do all sorts of content that a normal account wouldn't typically touch (unless pet hunting). For others, having to spend hundreds of hours to get a single item is just silly and a waste of time. Know which type you are :P
---
RuneScape's servers also are far from perfect. Most top HCIM's end up dieing to circumstances out of their control (Lag/DC's, random glitches, etc.). It would probably be infuriating to spend thousands of hours building up an account only to lose your HC status with there being nothing you could have done to prevent it. 
---
You also have to consider how important the HC status is (versus just regular ironman) and how much you enjoy the early game. If you hate the early game and just think it's a needlessly long grind to get to the real content, then a HC probably isn't for  you. Pretty much all of the top HCIM's have had to restart at some point due to a death of some sort. Not a big deal if you plan on playing HC til you die to whatever, then plan on continuing as a regular ironman... But if you really want that HC status, be prepared to start all over again.

It matters a lot. Did it on my mates acc that was pretty low level no problem using that method

No I mean I understand your point, and I appreciate the civil discourse. What about thieving, if you try to thieve master farmers at the minimum requirement it will be so terrible. And lets say you need a ranarr seed, you'll truly struggle because your rates are so low.  
---
 The success rate is based on your level and if you don't like the rate then you have to train. It might be faster to brute force it, but not necessarily better.  
---
 I feel like there are a few things in the game with a balance of minimum requirements and speed, thieving and agility, (bossing length - as in if you want a IM drop you can grind 1 kill at a time and get lucky or grind a bunch of stats to do 20 kill trips and get the drop faster), hunter implings and to some extent fishing (rate to 1000 sharks slowly vs training and then 1000 fast).
---
Sure you can succeed at the bare minimum. But your CHANCES of succeeding 5 rolls in a row are low, but so are catching 5 fish tick perfect at minimum level, doing 5 bandos in one trip, getting 10 pickpockets without getting caught, etc.

Also I find this hardly believable. I got my email compromised 2 weeks ago as with my osrs account. 2FA on both saved my bum on top of a bank pin. Check if you have been pwned. You should have set a bank pin BEFORE, when the login screen constantly reminds you that you're lacking one, the stronghold recommending you have one and also everyone on osrs recommending it. It's not even that big of a deal if you change your pin settings. As for your issue, I suspect you fucked up somewhere and you just don't know or you're hiding some information

It’s based off your missing hp, so 98 missing at 99 hp and only 69 at 70 hp
---
I wasn't but I could go for some Medium clue hunting...

What?

You kill her and take the head? Idk man, maybe I'm missing the joke but it just sounds like a necrophiliac or rapey.
---
Any chance we can finish the superiors for all slayer creatures. Creatures without a superior include
---
Sulfur lizards
---
Brine rats
---
Turoth
---
Zygomites
---
Spiritual creatures
---
Wyrms
---
Wyverns all types
---
Brutal black dragons* may not be necessary
---
Drake's
---
Hydras
---
So definitely a good amount could be made and they are a fun addition to a slayer assignment. Possibly add another drop or 2 to the superior drop table possibly a way to fortify your slayer helm?
---
It was _his_ tank? How and why the fuck does someone just buy a tank? Just how much money does a Jagex CEO make?

Fire Cape, got a Jad slayer task and am taking my time getting my stats and gear ready.

I know people have done it with low stats but I'm wanting to get at least 80 range and 75 defence before starting.

I think that was fake.
---
yeah, essentially you just keep failing at logging in with their account name and it will lock their account for a few minutes. If you have a bot script continuously failing the user's login, they will be permanently locked out of their account.
---
In the case of Zezima, he was offered "other solutions" which he declined. It was likely offered to change his login name to an email address or something of that sort. Zezima has always been super prideful of his username, and even said before that he wouldn't have played the game at all if he wasn't able to get the username.
---
If he wants to be that stubborn about a login name rather than username, that is frankly his own issue. I'm sure Jagex will offer Sparc Mac, or anyone else with this issue the same deal they offered Zezima.
---
Didn't know you could use Iban's Staff for woodcutting.
---
If your 2FA code wasnt working it could have been due to a change on your device time. I had this happen to me where my device was 1 hour behind and couldnt log in until i changed it back, since the 2FA app uses your device time to generate a code

I should clarify by saying that Rigour alone decimates anything sub 70 def. The Heavy Ballista, in combination with rig is where it starts to become OP. You can smack 30s thru your opponents ranged overhead prayer.

---
Yeah but most of us don't RWT.
---
I dont have a dps calculator infront of me but i believe the imbued heart people are wrong. Increasing your magic level does increase your max hit but tormented brace increased overall magic damage. Tormented should be your first major purchase after swamp trident, in terms of maximizing DPS. Boots should be one of your last purchases or if you have the spare cash laying around, which it seems like you do not.
---
To save you typing, I used DPS calc and it's definitely void. Thank you for your help

It is implied in my post that their offer would be 4 twisted bows at 1gp each, or it obviously wouldn't have sold for 13gp.

They could call it "Kurasking for it"

A common criticism of Warding was that a lot of it's content could fit into other skills such as Runecrafting. What are your thoughts on this now that Warding has failed?
---
haha no I just don't know what else to think!!! Enlighten me please!
---
You can hit your buy limit and sell to yourself, all you have to do after that is fill your history so it doesnt show ur other offers
---
Right... I mean don't get me wrong, I have a 2k total acc and have put a lot of time into RS. It's a 'fun' game. But I can't stick with it for more than 6 months at a time. When you have a good gaming PC, its hard to play a game like this with buttcheek graphics. Can't imagine doing it for 10+ hours a day for YEARS on end, for absolutely nothing in return aside from a pat on the back from other virgins XD
---
Give this man gold
---
1. Barrows gloves? You probably already have it as you have 219 QP
---
2. Fire cape? Maybe not since you said your range was in the 60s. If so get 75 range, buy a blowpipe and go kill Jad. 
---
3. Get 75 slayer to unlock Gargoyles and have reliable and easy money maker. 
---
4. Grandmaster quests. Try and go for Song of the Elves or Monkey Madness 2, Dragon Slayer 2 might be hard until you get close to 80s in combat stats. 
---
5. Max house. Best investment in the game. Its like 30m to get the 83 construction lvl. And depending on what you decide to build, another 20-40m to build everything. Its completely worth it though to have all teleports and a heal-all pool one click teletab away.
---
This is actually genius, thank you for mentioning that. I have two friends that had the same thing happen to them this weekend.
---
Downvoted for being offended of getting downvoted.
---
*woosh* no idea what this means.
---
No, I'm just stating my opinion. I don't believe that implies that I have a learning disability. 
---
Yes, the gauntlet takes time, questing, stats, and skill, but so does almost everything in the game. That's just implied because that's what literally everything in runescape requires (minus questing for some). 
---
The gauntlet offers a pet for pet hunters, an expensive unique, and a fun activity where you dont have to buy supplies to do it. Just because the gauntlet isnt equivalent to zulrah/vorkath that doesn't make it bad content or not worth doing. 
---
If you want more gold, do one of those 2. If you want a chance at an amazing looking pet and an expensive unique, go do the gauntlet.
---
So brave 😍😍😍🍆

This one is a little less adventurous, but finishing that 99 fletching for the cape.

Hey, this isn't a bug, the Elven scout that has replaced Ilfeen will be able to recharge this for you, however you've been attempting to talk to the scout that replaced Islwyn and Eluned. If you head to the two areas that Ilfeen wandered you should be able to find the correct scout.

Looks like homie is about to pop a squat right next to his pc. #noxpwaste

Thats a good point, weird I didn't start that despite all the other quests. And any tips on finding a clan chat? I have almost always played the game 100% solo, so I find it kind of hard to get into or find a clan that I'll feel like I fit into.
---
I think he means alts that play similarly to rune dragon alts but are lower level / less investment to create.
---
HP or Lenovo. Both super reliable laptops
---
If I come back I'll only have about 20m left without selling off everything I have, and I wouldn't want to sell everything. Should I just sink a mil here and there into construction, or is it only really worth it all the way at 83?
---
There was information about adding the hyrda tail to the whip to make an upgraded version? Is there any further information about this? Thank you.
---
Gonna see them T Bows. Clap them Zuks.
---
Ds2 isnt that hard imo. I died to galvek twice because I'm an idiot who doesnt understand that big spikey balls kill people.... but other than that at 70 range it went pretty smooth. Nowhere near max gear either. Hardest part is staying calm
---
Yeah no problem! I don't know about you personally, but I find barrows to be really fun too. So having that extra bonus makes it even more enjoyable for me. Whenever I have "no goals" I just go do Barrows until I'm inspired to do something else :P
---
Source it?
---
Can the reward system of Zalcano be balanced so that it's viable to solo? Currently it's very annoying having to constantly hop worlds to make sure you have the optimal amount of people killing the boss to maximize rewards and pet chance.
---
They pffered zezima a fix. They offered him to change his login from username to an email and he declined.
---
Could brewing recipes be added to currently un-brewable ales? This would include Bloody Bracers, Grog, etc.
---
Mature variants would also be a favorable addition if this were added.
---
Great tips, i will try this method and let you know. Why not use void mage? It's more accurate than mystic. Ideally I would have the elite version for the extra prayer bonus, but can't due to this weird game state.
---
Your first couple sentences isn't relevant at all to what I was talking about.
---
&gt; and what I meant by that statement is that If accepting the highest available offers would have sent him over max cash, it can act funny in restricting the offer from doing so. I see the confusion now.
---
Making a sale through the GE isn't affected in any way shape or form by the amount of GP you have in your inventory or bank. It's not like the system reads that you have near max cash then restricts the amount of money you can get for the item you put for sale. I've merched with max cash for years and that has never happened to me once even if I occasionally make a mistake such as putting at item for sale for 1100 gp instead of 1100m.
---
What price u sold for?
---
Start working on those barrow gloves brotha! You definitely have the aptitude to get to addy now that you’ve accomplished some of the more tedious quest. You’ll see instant upgrades with addy gloves alone
---
His lowest skill is prayer though.
---
Lol you got the wrong username my toxic friend.
---
If you have to ask you can’t afford it.
---
Well anyone can change their display name. Members can change it every 30 days, or with the use of a bond.
---
The issue is changing your login name. Everyone knows what Zezima’s or Sparc Mac’s are, and they don’t have an easy way of being changed. These names are obvious to people because they were made before you could even change your name, or were forced to use an email address to login with.

Because in 2019 guys are trying to pretend they are girls.

You have a configuration file from the runelite folder that you can just copy from your old computer to the new one. No need to copy all manually. All your bank tags, ground item, checked plugin are supossed to follow.

I believe its instanced so any items you lose are lost permanently. Check the wiki.

Rune kite if he gets it from rare drop table, and the rooms where he uses the rune crossbow the shield doesn't matter, maybe nylo boss, but maiden is 100% accuracy regardless of gear, nylo waves the ranger will use karils as it clears faster, sotetseg kinda matters but the room will be so quick that it's unlikely he will use any supplies at all as people do it now in void and take no damage, and he will be in tanky barrows gear, and xarpus is poison damage, the main place the shield matters is verzik p3

Probably yes, but getting unlucky doesn't affect if/when you do get lucky

Are we able to get a 'semi-permanent' and 'permanent' bank place holder. It would work as such:
---
Semi-permanent: Fill bank slots with placeholders (coloured yellow/ orange?) for quick and easy accessibility. Will work wonders when you have to reformat your bank for skilling such as RC, smithing, alching etc to have the required items closer to 'deposit all' and 'withdraw item'. Semi permanent place holders will act in such a way that when you clear placeholders it does not clear all place holders in the bank but only those that you have set as semi-permanent. (Guess temporary is a better term?)
---
Permanent: Permanent place holders (red) will work how they are now. Present until cleared. This would be amazing for people who like to organise their bank in such a way that they use place holders so gears, pots, cosmetics, treasure trails, and set items, etc so they easily identify which piece is missing? God pages for example? This way there is a distinction between two types and can be interchangeable when needed.
---
Benefits: clearing semi-permanent place holders after skilling will not affect the layout of your bank when you have permanent place holders.
---
Saves time having to reorganise your whole bank when you have a brain fart and clear all place holders.
---
Cons: I'm not sure?
---
This is a really good meme template, im stealing it
---
Is this on mobile? Gratz :)
---
RWT.  RuneScape is fairly liquid in terms of items.  Almost all end game gear can be traded for gold.  So it's extremely easy to hack an account and take everything of value.
---
And on the flip side, you can buy most end game gear in RS with gold (and people like flexing their items), so there is the huge market for buying the gold.
---
I use ancient mace for free prayer (restores pray equal to hit) and guthans for hp, fraction of the price of sgs
---
I’m gay I was just curious lmao
---
Bro you already kill it in a minute, you don’t need to take risks on hp lol.

Yeah I mean for the most part I don't but I worked really really hard to get my infernal cape and honestly, doing some more killcount was fun. So 2 birds with 1 stone there lol.

Turoths especially, they're the only creature in the Fremennik Slayer Dungeon to not have one and it kills me inside.
---
It's probably not an offered feature cause they don't have a workflow for it, and when it was suggested before it was sort if on the fly
---
Wow thanks he’s cured.
---
Yes anyone who made an account since the launch of osrs will have an email address as their login name.
---
hp - once gmauls start coming out you want your hp to be reasonable.  
---
range lv (and magic, but not as important) should be equal to 2*(attack+str)/3, aka as high as possible without affecting cb level

zerks risk significantly (3-4x easilyi) more than pures do per death

Since all those posts about the Dicing Bot situation it’s evident that either:

It's way more difficult than vorkath, which is almost braindead easy. I understand that vorkath is locked behind DS2 but it's still an incredibly easy boss for being top 3 money makers, isn't it? I'm just saying make zulrah actually viable for high level accounts and add more than STARTING regicide the requirement for it. Scales and blowpipe are crazy cheap right now and bp is the most broken thing on the planet
---
True, but then it's still trading. It can be interesting even if he does trade, but I disapprove of people getting tons of help when they're playing the gamemode made to play alone.
---
I'm for this, although I don't know if we need more stuff from their drop table?

---
The pool is repeatedly upgraded from the most basic one, and each upgrade requires higher con levels. So yeah you need the fancy pool first before you can build the ornate one. Conveniently, if you're able to boost to build the ornate one, you can build the fancy one without boosting.

Can we get superiors in the Iowerth slayer dungeon to have a guaranteed drop of crystal shards? Certainly 1 at the minimum, but maybe like 2-4 or something? Just doesn't seem worth slaying there since catacombs gives guaranteed totem piece for superiors.
---
unable to replicate this.
---
pog yes
---
Can you add Song of the Elves as a requirement to kill Zulrah? The req would act as a gatekeeper against bots, similar to Vorkath, and make it difficult to get to zulrah without bots investing in multiple skills to 70.  
---
Don't remove pets from anyone who already has them and give a grace period to not mess up ironmen(Or allow ironmen access to zulrah without sote)

No, not animations but the icons. Every spellbook has a different style of its teleports, but the Home Teleport icon is the same for all spellbooks.

Uses, but doesn't contribute.
---
Also all the people on vanilla client.
---
I'm sorry, you can try and overexplain it all you want but it simply isn't enough of the overall data to claim it's infallible.
---
Useful, but not infallible.

just replace firemaking with dungeoneering so we have a skill that's worse than RC

Upvote for salad hat XD

Just because the majority want something doesn’t mean it’s a good thing. That’s just a fallacious argument.

Can the duel arena function without pking? (aside from forfeit and DC)

Actually

Glad my 11$ is going to good use

It's fake don't worry
---
But that's the point. It didn't. Multiple people have said they had offers above 13gp, so the only way to get the offer to go through would be to sell it to himself, or he's a photoshop wizard.
---
You're maging in karils?
---
This is the part that always goes over you retards' heads. It's not the getting killed part that pisses most people off, it's when the pker talks shit like anybody but them is impressed that they killed somebody with no intention of fighting back. It's the same losers who pad their k/d with free kills and then brag about their k/d.
---
Their ice barrage might still get us

This was a rumour posted on Reddit and never had substantial evidence. Not saying it’s wrong but it’s pretty disgusting how people just take it as fact now.

what brand toaster was this pic taken on?

I'm a f2p I was doing RC to get to body runes while I was high and I got to lvl35 before I knew it

Just keep trying though!

you cant even wear g mail it doesnt need nerfing

Seriously. Farming runs are so fun
---
20k is 20k.

&gt; this shouldn’t be an issue in the first place?
---
What is your proposed solution? Remove the log in limit? Then anyone can brute force an account, theoretically. Only enforce the log in limit on a per-IP basis? Anyone trying to hack accounts is already using a VPN lol
---
dude you don't even have 126 combat yet lmaooo the game's been out 6 years lmao

I dotn have a sister but $20 is $20...

I had to file a claim with my bank cause they wouldn’t give me access to my account since I switched phones and the acc had 2fa

I'll have to look into whatever Karambwans are, thanks. I've made Yew bows for profit while skilling fetching and have wanted to raise WC for Ents so I could farm some magic logs while doing combat too so I'll work on that.

I don’t think enough people are grinding gauntlet and submitting info to the wiki for us to know drop rates for cm rares.

I'm at 368 kc, most of it being solos (I did 70-99 Firemaking @ Wintertodt). I'm missing half the Pyromancer set, with no pet and no axe of course.

Where's your source on this?
---
Just because everyone doesn't have 6 Reddit links and a Twitter log in their bookmarks doesn't mean it didn't happen
---
I was with you, because it's always nice to have a source, untill you started flaming and making accusations when you yourself have no information to lend either. You don't know this is wrong or didn't happen.
---
The fact that literally 100s of people are vouching for it should atleast give you some sort of confidence that it might be real.
---
Maybe not try to base everything off an internet link? Because, yknow, if it's on the internet it's true, but only if it's a link.

Honestly you'll be pulling 50-60 kill trips before you know it. They become braindead easy after a while.

Are there any plans for a Gargoyle boss loot table update now that the Gmaul item is moving to the BH store, maybe even a boss rework to make it less tedious.

Popular players who have OG accounts with their OG logins can be locked out of their account by people spamming their log in with wrong passwords.
---
So like the login for Zezima’s account is “zezima” and space macs is likely “Sparc Mac” or “SparcMac” so people can lock them out by guessing passwords on their username
---
Tell me more

14 kc dex is badass, but damn the rest of that sucks. Rip dude

Lmao this happened to ice poseidon before. It's been broken for the longest time.

Time is money. Buying bonds with gold requires a time input to get that gold. Combine that with the fact that people who are buying bonds with gold make Jagex more money per month than normal subs (by creating a demand), and you should realize it's foolish to say they have "no reason to complain", even using your stance.

Is there a general method for searching for them, like a spawn point or time?

oh, then ive stopped caring, and it means nothing becuase you can already jsut let neive do all the work.
---
So the pker and the guy dropping are the scammers. The guy inside is my friend and I'm trying to anti-scam. 
---
The scammer would drop expensive stuff on a specific tile so that when my friend tries to telly grab his character will run into the open. This is on a PvP world. So basically before the scammer logs in, I have to log in on the same tile so that they don't see me and I just spam click on the tile. I guess I jumped the gun or the guy would have dropped the Arcane on the same spot.

Great! Now let me double it for you. 2 trades

This is actually happening to quite a few people including me, its linked to IP. Support isn't really helping.
---
Damn... im sorry for your loss man, truly. You have such a positive attitude even with a loss of a friend. I dont mean to sound cliche but I wish I had just a sliver of the kindness you have.

They didn’t kind of tell him they flat out said “keep trying, can’t do shit about it”

You really can't go wrong with questing - great way to get introduced to new areas while getting quest points and xp in the process

There should be an optimal quest guide on the osrs wiki so look that up and it'll point you in the right direction

yeah zezima cant play because of this

I've hurt my back from iron working for almost 15 years but other than that pretty good champ

I used blood blitz and then when it got to the 4th phase usually I was nearly fully healed so I would bring a few baskets of strawberry’s to fully heal myself and juggled food on the floor and repeated it took me a few tries but you’ll get it!

What happened in the SoE update that caused Bryophyta's staff price to jump from 2.7m to \~8m?
---
Player count might see a drop because of wow classic for a bit, but remember that blizzard is running that show. I have extremely heavy doubts that blizzard will go the same path as Jagex to ensure long term playability with that classic feel. They will almost certainly introduce mtx quite quickly and end up making the game more like modern wow without caring what players want via options such as poll.

I wouldn't say hate; more of disappointed. Probably also don't have 5 reasons without stretching it a bit. But the main few would be MTX, Exp Handouts/Events, and Unappealing Updates with most feeling more like forced busywork than good content. I kinda like the graphics and I don't think the current combat is that bad for that game, but I also have other games with pretty graphics and more fun combat so those don't win any points for RS3 either.

maybe you're killing things faster and you get logged out waiting for more mobs to come over

They offered to let him change his login to an email he said no.
---
I personally think thats dumb as shit. Its a game he wants to play but cant, and hes never going to sell the account or anything so i dont get that at all. How does him typing in a email address instead of Zezima on his login screen change his account at all.. he do it and never tell anyone no will know! He already has one of if not the most unique and iconic RS account in the world. Hes fucking Zezima.
---
Haha cause I’m cheap. I could buy pegs but I’d rather buy other stuff. Same with the Anti Dragon Shield vs Ward
---
Just look at the flowers, kid.
---
the most dangerous game?
---
I've made no statements myself. Period. I am being very vocal about asking others for evidence though. Look up "reading comprehension". 
---
Also, I regularly delete my comments so fools like you can't take my post history out of context and try to use it against me for a current, unrelated, topic. I guess I stumped you today with that tactic.
---
:(
---
What is your proposal then?  Only allow login attempts to flagged accounts from whitelisted IPs?
---
I reported this day 1 with the report a bug feature. Sadly I guess the only way for it to get fixed is if I would've post it on reddit. :/
---
I’m looking to do tob soon and a lot of Cox atm does your clan approve of irons?
---
Support for realism. Atleast in my life.
---
I wasn’t trying to say how they are doing it, I was trying to figure out how they are doing it and if such a solution could be implemented to fix the issue.
---
you understand these statements are not mutually exclusive unless you rip them out of the context like you have?
---
It does not matter if someone's offer was in the ge for 10 years at 1k if it was not possible for the GE to fulfill it (due to it making the seller's transaction surpass 2.147b)
---
The only time it matters is if someone had a 13gp offer in for longer. If we take OP's post at face value and assume it is real, then evidently there were no offers in the GE at 13gp for longer than OP.
---
If you don't understand this, you probably have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the GE works.
---
Yep
---
Heart racing? Palms sweaty? Welcome to the club my friend.
---
&gt;people spamming it shouldn't stop him logging in

What is your proposal to halt the security risks inherent with just allowing spammed login attempts while also not inconveniencing him?
---
u gonna get mad cus that other guy made some shitty video that resembled yours again? cOnTeNt cReAtOr (pay me please)
---
Do what literally every other game does and throttle attempts from a single client or IP and not the entire fucking world? It could literally be as simple as one extra column in a database.
---
I basically got 70 art, str, def, and range thanks to afking at work. I've started afking lobs/swords. Once I get 62 I'm gonna move on to monks. Mobile is amazing so I can focus on Slayer/questing when I actually have time to play.
---
Great screenshot
---
Fuck me really.. CHANGE IT TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS! If no one knows the email it cant be spammed.. they can only spam his account right now because his login is his name and its known by every Runescape player alive.
---
Cmon mate.. wakey wakey
---
Mind explaining how? Dosent that mean any potential hacker already has one of 2 things to get passed the login screen?
---
*psst* he doesnt have a sister, he just dressed up like that.

Well.... I'm not gay... but Zezima is Zezima.

Literally every comment you've written has implied that there's a solution other than him changing to an email address, that's what TisMeDA was getting at with your original comment and what I was wondering too

dumb seppo
---
A brand new release here in Canada is like $90 +tax +tip
---
That's true for inferno but not for jad
---
Dev here (not jagex) that has worked extensively on maintaining old-ass code.
---
"It's hard" usually means "It's hard to do this in the time we're given to do it". It's usually because you need, say, 10k+ hours of dev work to fix the current bugs and issues (not considering new features) and only 200 hours of dev hours per week to split it across.
---
Either Jagex needs to prioritize more work on bug fixing for issues like this, or they need to hire more devs. The former would probably delay new content, and the latter would probably require them to raise prices some more, strike sponsorship deals with other companies, or cut costs from other areas of the company. All of which people will bitch about.
---
It's hard to do it in a feasible manner that won't piss off a bunch of people one way or another. It's what tends to happen when you accumulate such a significant amount of technical debt.
---
Zalcano kph is around 30 (which isn't hard to get) which is 60 shards per hour, not withstanding an average value of 2m of other loot in that hour.
---
To match that with the Gauntlet, you either need to do 12 Normal Gauntlets or 9 Corrupted Gauntlets per hour, which is orders of magnitudes more difficult and a very small portion of the playerbase can even approach those rates. Even counting the small blade chance, the other loot doesn't compensate.
---
I've found RuneNation to be a really friendly clan for quick/efficient raids if you're looking for splits.

If you're interested, add "Javen" ingame. He should be able to sort you out.

I know thats what ive been saying this whole time..

Lmao what a joke 😂😂
---
Glad you guys enjoyed it :)
---
Why should the account be locked because a bot is trying to force it's way in? Do you know how long it would take a bot to get into an even moderately secure account if they only allowed 1 attempt a second even from thousands of clients? The odds are in the billions, and that's ignoring extra security measures like authenticators. No other game has this problem, and Jagex has been known to have lax security measures. This is simply making players jump through hoops so they can ignore it.

Hey, seconded

I remember opening one of this guys streams recently and let me tell you, what a fucking gamer. His opening intro was just this fast paced trance music and it cuts into him doing 1tick 6 way gear swaps and fakies in this tribridding fight. He literally destroyed this guy so hard and dropped him for max gear it was fantastic quality and skill. I dropped a follow and subscribed with my twitch prime. Just on the side of this pking screen, he had another account doing 3tick 5g mining in the quarry. His next stream that I caught, he was completing a solo ToB and it was like the 5th in a row he had done. This guy is a fucking gamer and probably the most versatile and experienced player in Oldschool aside from Woox. He's top tier in skilling, PvP and PvM. What a fucking gamer
---
Harassing J-mods who don't work in that section probably isn't the way to help pal
---
He didn't specify but common sense prevails here
---
Did y'all match tho
---
I got scammed in that clan for dhcb
---
I added him at one point to try and give him advice, for which he didn't care for. Then I noticed he hopped around erratically then realized that he was doing.
---
I went to the worlds he hopped to do that I could warn people what he was doing since it was scummy.
---
You literally didn't address his point. Botnet's use proxies from all around the world, what you suggested wouldn't work.
---
Infernal eels are the best that I'm aware of if you want minimal clicks/taps.
---
Then 2 hours later he did 3t fishing on one account and zulrah on the alt
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Well that's...just dumb TBH. To whom do you flaunt this "OG status"?
---
"yeah man I got that OG username loggin. I can't even log into the game because everyone tries to guess my password so much I'm locked out."
---
Do you know how to read? He said they had this same issue years ago and they fixed it lmao.

I'm just worried about having to fight mages while questing. I know there's a circle of mages outside Varrock where you summon the demon for Demon Slayer. There's also PvP.

No, you're just being a semantic idiot

Who even types their loggin name anymore anyway?
---
If I was F2P I would just grind out moss giants for the moss giant key and kill em as much as possible not to sure about F2P money making methods. And once you start as a member I’d grind agility then do underground pass and rush barrows since it’s really easy and you can get lucky with drops and once you have enough membership to where you can start grinding slayer start grinding slayer cause you’ll make so much money to where bond money is maybe a task or two. Good luck brother!
---
I'm aware it's been a few months, but it won't be forever. Somebody in particular is botting login attempts - but isnt going to continue botting it for years.
---
It might take 6+ months, but that's nothing in runescape time, and Zezima knows that.
---
Bastion isn’t really worth if you’re using an anti-fire shield cause you’ll only be taking magic damage.
---
Awesome series Chocobo! Fire art too.
---
In addition to what sumoboi said, they do indeed spawn and despawn on a timer, with higher tier implings being available for less time. I can't find it right now, but UIM Verf (Karamja Only) has gone through all those mechanics in one of the main vids.
---
I've got empathy of this one, rest in peace :( My heart still aches over the loss of my own chickenpet. All the other hens picked on her and excluded her, so I'd let her inside and eat breakfast with me. I also played runescape and scrolled reddit while she napped, swaddled in a towel in my lap.
---
It's my account goal to complete Western Elite diaries and get the chompychick pet in her honor.
---
Do you? He said "pretty sure".
---
Can't believe you're letting thieving prevent you from diary cape!
---
You're right, I missed that. Correct me if I'm wrong again, but I don't think it said anything about whether it would be worth dissolving top tier gear. For example you can alch ancestral but it's not worth it. Dissolving had the potential to remove top tier items but I'm not sure it would have.
---
You literally proved my point in your other comment. Sorry dude.
---
I trained to 43 prayer on f2p with big bones at the ge. All of the money was from people just handing out mills. I got a gilded 2h one time

Well 1 sure beats the hell out of the current 0. I'll leave the balancing to Jagex, but whether it be 1 or 10 or 50 shards, they should give something.

I don't care.

IP bans are worthless these days. People just get a vpn.

Have a link to a guide by any chance?

How is the gauntlet for those with lower cb stats (70att,70def,85str,82mage,80range) ?
---
I'd like to do it on my ironmemes to get those crystal armour, I would be doing the regular gauntlet. 
---
Thank you in advance.
---
Yes but this case is irrelevant to that. This is the players fault for not changing their account loggin info to an email address which Jagex already pointed out to them. They want the 'novelty' of having an account that's less secure because they see it as some sort of OG status.
---
&gt;And you're juvenile
---
This is so bold for someone who's been a half-step away from resorting to calling everyone who disagrees with them "stupidhead".
---
&gt; Sorry you're too lazy and slow to understand that the links that have been posted dozens of times verify nothing, and are only parroted by other half-wits like you. 
---
Look at that 200 IQ commentary from a true grown adult.

Markiplier? We're posting markiplier memes?
---
My hunter is only 75 as well lmao
---
No quest cape or diary cape.... going for the real cape first
---
All very valid questions, I hope these make it to q&amp;a. Number 1 priority should be adding a death cost to Zulrah.
---
Why not create a unique, dedicated email for RuneScape and save it to a password manager in Chrome? I just don't understand why someone would refuse to do this if this is happening.
---
Thank you!
---
I think the official forums is probably a better place for this.
---
It would, however, be a good opportunity to change the way the Achievement Diary cape gets trimmed. You could say that completing all the elite diaries gets you the cape, but only completing the master diaries trims it. This would mean it would function in a similar way to the Music Cape in that you have to do tasks specific to Diaries (as opposed to quests) in order to trim it. 
---
The diary cape being trimmed by the quest cape makes no sense when the quest cape also trims the diary cape.
---
1. Earn the trust of someone high leveled.
---
2. Have them give you money for a bond.
---
3. Grind gp much faster in members.
---
4. Pay back your sugar daddy.

Yeah I guess but idk I’ve managed to get 1-2 a day and with so many people helping him find Lucky Imps that just means more chances to spot Dragon Imps. I have the money, some people could benefit from 1-1.5M for zero effort, and its opportunity costs. I have limited play time and frankly can’t be bothered to spend hours looking for imps while trying to get a 1/19 loot. Hopefully this makes sense and you can understand where I’m coming from.

Id pay to see that.

Its a hydrant btw

Wait no we like this

Please add a favorites feature to the music player in game. It would be nice to be able to craft a playlist to listen to via favorites. Currently you can listen to the same 1 song on loop, or leave music on auto which gets really annoying when it keeps restarting the same 2 or 3 songs. Some of the music is really enjoyable, and it would be cool to be able to explore Oldschool's music more effectively.

You can't not follow that up

Thanks guys, I would like to point out that this is now the third account I have 200M in all skills on.
---
Holy shit congrats.
---
To nobody, I just like having it. I realize that it's pretty stupid but I don't have a better explanation. Having the same login as I did when I was a kid is a nostalgic feeling right from the login and it makes me happy.
---
If I was a public figure in the community or a richer player I'd feel different, though, cause that account security is way more important for them.
---
Why do you feel the need to mention this?
---
Back in the day I saved 200k from killing cows snd collecting hides, bought full rune off someone at Varrock bank. Went to the wildy with it to collect bones at the graveyard (with no food) and got 2v1ed and x clicked out in sheer panic. 
---
Saved up again, collecting hides, and got killed trying to fight a tree spirit at Draynor willows. Some very kind player picked up my dropped pieces and met me half way, as I was rage running back in hopes nobody took my stoof.

Isn't your proposed solution of changing your login name basically the same thing as logging in with an email address instead of your account name?

They're well aware and already said they plan on adding auth to website login as part of their security improvements.
---
I got blocked by swamp man today because of a impling mix up. Sooooo I guess there is a higher chance of someone else getting that lottery now.
---
By only doing tasks that are 80k+ xp/hr and mostly doing smokes which are almost 200k/hr
---
I thought Tbows were only 13gp?
---
Starsky and GUT
---
It definitely should be required, but it doesn't currently compromise your account. You can't do anything by logging in the website except changing your name once (reversible) and maybe getting you banned kn the forums
---
You can't change the pass or disable auth from the website without email access
---
Reposting an above comment:
---
&gt;They set up a channel that only Settled, and about 5 admins, would only be able to see but the bot that configured that channel's visibility had a bug on the backend and random people who knew what they were doing could see all the callouts in the channel.
---
from what I recall zezima and rs said "we offered but he declined" but I don't remember either party specifically saying what the offer was. it seems people are just saying the email thing because it's the most likely solution.
---
Yeah dude I get it, it's like a whole lot of doing nothing for not much. I just figured that came with the territory for late game ironmen. I just figured I'd give you a suggestion for something you can do since the info Settled actually gives could be helpful. I'm pretty sure Morytania is their highest frequency location regardless. You could probably incoroporate a few hops around the area during farm runs or something.
---
I believe so but only if you already have all beginner through hard clues.
---
Well Jagex could get their login situation sorted out by hiring some actual professionals to overhaul how they handle it like every other modern online company, but that's really asking for the moon at $11/month. Inb4 $12.
---
I don't know why we need teleport scrolls at all for things like zulrah and cerb. They aren't that hard to get to and they just make the bosses even more farmable.
---
I haven't seen any dice bots in a couple days.  It's been absolutely wonderful.
---
glad im not the only one having this issue
---
Sounds like a scam to try and get people to donate you money. 700k would def show in the loot pile as 65k tag on the floor.
---
well yeah pretty much. It isn't really my solution though. That said, the issue is that if your username that you use to login with is leaked then anyone can run a script to lock you out of your account. That is an issue whether you use an email or account name to login with. People who were well known before you had to use an email to register have very widely known login names. Everyone knows what usernames Zezima or Sparc Mac use to login with, as those were always their names.
---
Unfortunately no. The way clues work is if you have a clue of a certain lvl in your bank/inventory it would go down, not up.
---
with the exception of the serpentine helm, armor in this game doesn't prevent status effects. you just have to have potions to cure them. what effect specifically are you talking about? with the weird exception of disease, it's basically all either poison or venom and those both have options to deal with them pretty well.
---
could be that you're running a lot of plug ins on the client too, turn off some of the ones you aren't using
---
Ah yeah, powermining sandstone or granite or iron ore? Lol
---
no.
---
He started going for Dragon imps, which makes me think he actually got the rune crossbow. :P
---
We're the best.
---
Be nice to me too lol I’m poor :)
---
No rune armour gives you passive status effects, only a select few members-only armour sets have passive set bonuses. 
---
For the best defensive bonuses, people wear a full helm, platebody (or chainbody if you haven't done Dragon Slayer), kiteshield and platelegs or plateskirt. Pick up a pair of boots at the stronghold of security in the middle of barbarian village too.
---
Going outside is pretty high on the list during the summer months
---
Controlled whip is one of the slower ways to train to max melees. The most efficient would be to get 99 str then atk, just training def through bursting/barraging slayer tasks.
---
probably fake
---
Can't you change you username login?
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
Trust me. I already do a bunch of annoying and just stupid shit as is. (Not that your idea is stupid but if I add another thing I’ll basically never be pvming) Yeah that’s where most have been spotted. I’ve got a few people who found one and now they hop around for a bit. It’s free money for lower levels so I just like to help. Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
They got you? So you encountered scammers, then proceeded to go into a dangerous area with valuables on you?
---
Not a status symbol, it's just a nice thing for myself. It feels like an exclusive club and it adds to my nostalgia to log in the same way I did when I was little. It's not a big deal.
---
No, clue scrolls can reroll down a tier but not up. 
---
e.g. if you already have an elite/hard clue, and your nest would have been elite/hard, it rerolls down to a medium.
---
Lool he deleted it.
---
Or the 3rd way of no staff
---
This was years ago and it was already known that he sells gp. You bet some of those stakes in vids are rwt, he would be stupid not to but then again he’s not exactly smart and surely will brag somewhere.
---
2007 would be considered late 2000s wouldn't it?
---
get fucked you shat
---
wow
---
Are there plans to add more dialogue to Priffdinas? Currently all the generic NPCs have the same dialogue. Also, could the fight ring in the western part of the city be a bit more lively, like spectators saying things and cheering as the elf warriors fight?
---
Very easy to tell he wasn't
---
Assembler is bis for range Cape slot. Max cape is equivalent to wear the avas accumulator I think?
---
So essentially with just someone's email you can lock their account? That's fucky.
---
uwu
---
With fake client I ment that they don't use a visual client but just a client based on packets to make it faster.
---
can i downvote twice somehow
---
I'm out of the loop can anyone help me
---
66 kc here still no bucket
---
I would imagine zezima was a name not allowed to be made when osrs servers opened. Could have been him fucking with you.
---
Honestly how shitty Jagex handles CS is why I dont play this game, why spend all that time and one small slip in cyber security and its all gone and the devs are like "oh well get fucked"
---
That’s what I said?
---
I actually like the diaries. Excellent ways to set goals for your character, and makes you do a bit of everything. By no means are they a "must have" to be able to play though.
---
Seems like it's now becoming more of a meme
---
Are you implying he ever stopped?
---
Nah. Zezima would never answer my random message out of his usual spam. If he did, it wouldn't be asking to "hold a bond for a week".
---
I am going on holiday for 2 weeks this weekend, gf my accounts
---
Who actually remembers the origin of this
---
Was commented already but birdhouse runs for sure, can do every 50 mins and they take max 2 mins to do.
---
I accidentally entered the Monkey Madness boss fight with my cash stack and didn't realixe it until I was abput to get wrecked. 
---
I've been there.
---
i dont know any other weeb slang. so i googled it and linked for your pleasure.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/c4oKNNO](https://imgur.com/gallery/c4oKNNO)
---
He would still have his username though, it would only change on the login screen
---
Agreed
---
He has a youtube series where his ultimate ironman account is locked to morytania and can't leave the area.  He has gone from 1-99 hunter, 1-85 slayer and gotten a whip drop, multiple barrows pieces just to try to beat the theater of blood.
---
My point was he could afford the car even if he RWT's

I don’t mind a low level with a rune pick joining in at all since I know it’s not gonna effect my chance of MVPs or overall loot, if anything it just makes kills a little faster
---
I ate those food
---
I believe 2999 would be considered late 2000s personally
---
I’m at 280 kc solo on my iron with 13 purples so far. Decent drop rate but 7 have been dex and 3 arcane lol
---
Yeah, it's fucked up that OP's 26 and apparently sees nothing funky about chatting online about underaged sex. Should've jetpacked out of this conversation as soon as that headed there. Or sooner.
---
Damn that’s rough man you must be devastated.........
---
And zero dice bots
---
They work with elite diaries done
---
You'll be redirected to medal-delivery shortly
---
Yeah, still working towards it slowly but surely.
---
stand alone btw
---
congrats on 99 range dude!
---
Two different bosses completely, I’d say galvek is probably harder to learn and get down but you can do it over and over if you mess up. Thing about jad is the grind to actually get to him so you don’t get much time to fight him. However I will say jad is extremely easy once you get a blowpipe, you have 5 seconds in between each attack to be ready for the next one.
---
The audacity of using the GPU
---
Seriously tho I just came back to rs after over a decade and gpu acceleration in runelite is amazing *chef kiss*
---
You take max cape or range cape
---
Tough lesson, I'm sure you'll get that back in no time. I once tried drop trading inside edgeville bank a long time ago, and as soon as the items started appearing a random guy came over to ask what I was doing. He took half of the noted supplies I dropped, then called me a dumbass and logged. I was so sad, but I was indeed a dumbass.
---
Imagine spoiling shit to try get karma
---
Damn. Did you die right as the boss died?

that’s odablock

This made me lol in my head

To most of us, with login names entirely separate from our display name and email, using email to login would be far less secure.
---
This has literally been going on for a year now. Same guy does it on the same few accounts. 
---
It's been 5 hours since it was posted, either op has already been scammed or he/she knows it's a scam and they're safe. They literally try and do it back to back with this one, like within 10 minutes. 
---
They used to do it with ancestral hat, then ZGS, they're getting cheap. 
---
Also, you will literally never get the arcane. They make sure they have good pid before you get on. You'd have to log on, predict where they're going to drop it and be lucky enough to have better pid.
---
This should've been your first reply. Until this comment, I agreed with everybody else in that what you said implied you thought Jagex should be excused for bad coding practises. Now that I've seen your explanation, I can see what you were going for, but it wasn't obvious and wasn't the first natural interpretation. 
---
Don't blame everybody else for misinterpreting what you wrote. Maybe what you wrote wasn't clear enough, and that's fine. Just clear it up and don't act so defensive.
---
Rumour has it he found a 50 on the ground and since it only took him 5mins he quit youtube after realizing he could be making 600$ an hour scavenging outside
---
Ah I see a fellow balder in chat.
---
Moral of the story.
---
2 factor your account, use a unique email with a unique password that is also 2 factored.
---
Use a bank pin, and use a different unique password for your account.
---
Don't use this game email anywhere else, don't use the password anywhere else (common practice).
---
You never need to change any of this information, as long as it's unique and a strong password. I've not changed my OSRS pass once in 5 years. Keeping the same password is never going to be what gets you hacked.. using the same password in multiple places will.
---
**tl;dr**
---
Use a password manager. Make every password you use unique. Make a separate email just for Runescape and associate your account with that. Use 2 factor authentication in game and on your email (and ideally absolutely everywhere these days). Use a bank pin. You will never get hacked. You do not need to change passwords or pins at all, let alone 10+ times a year.
---
Unless you are an Ironman trying to get bolt racks. You should go for 88% rewards to get more runes as bolt racks are worth very little.
---
There are a number of ways but I found the best was kill two skeletons and 1 blood worm... this gets you about 86% so you get very close to the max runes with out losing money from getting bolt racks.
---
RNG decent
---
You could do both. Afk Barb fish or other things while playing your main.
---
You just summed up all pvp games lol
---
this is really bad logic, using a charged scythe on something like gargoyles makes about as much sense as using a tent whip
---
That is what this post is about, it's more punishing now than it used to be.

pog as fuck
