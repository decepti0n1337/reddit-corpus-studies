&gt; doesn't feel tedious.
---

---
Idk man, swapping out gear/ clearing inventory and doing it at intervals annoys the shit out of me more than a 6 hour grind doing something repetitive.
---
Not warding in particular no
---
Just use Tears of Guthix on them because they are waaaaaay faster than birdhouses 4Head
---
Aka I cannot take a joke, due to my parents raising a snowflake.
---
use chins!
---
Took me 70 agil to get full graceful through rooftops...
---
No. Aka there are plenty of people trying to sell accounts and scam others in OSRS.
---
Also: You clearly don’t know my parents.
---
Ironmen complaining that they have it harder than the average player even when they elect to make it harder on purpose for themselves and REEEing to get their way and nerf a thing they barely did? I am totally amazingly astoundingly shocked.
---
Nice name, awesome band. Got to seem em live on Drones tour
---
Time is money
---
Imbued heart -&gt; full arma -&gt; sang/ancestral (pretty sure full ancest and sang both give 1 max hit, sang is more expensive but the heal is really nice)
---
This is worse than game of thrones spoilers

---
Would give that amulet from shades a use
---
yesterday i started playing osrs lol after i maxed my rs3 account
---
99 agil should never fail 30 agil req shortcut too
---
No problem, I skipped the earlier levels of armor but that’s fairly obvious what’s good there. You should try to get a fighter torso ASAP from the Barbarian Assault minigame, it can be tedious but it’ll be the bis melee chest (when not tanking) until you can afford bandos
---
Sword will probably pass regardless because everyone votes mainly yes nowadays, although I wish it wouldn’t.
---
It would need to be at least 1000pts
---
So many things would begin to be too fast.
---
Ex. Gargoyls
---
want a cookie?
---
It's just in there to devalue tent, nothing more.
---
Are you copy and pasting this to every negative comment?
---
No, you clearly do not know me. Me and your mother are very fond of one another.
---
Aka she sucks my cock.
---
Just because you dont feel empathy doesn't mean others don't. Upvotes and Downvotes mean nothing to me. Other people mean something to me, regardless of knowing them personally.
---
Blessed d hide is better then void  at zulrah. Always wear ancestral hat, then wear ahrims occult and tormented. And swap to fury blessed d hide anguish b gloves and accu for range
---
How dare he tag ash in that
---
&gt; this is the rapier of slash, but degradable.
---
that already exists.
---
Kbd is for pet
---
Not everything on the internet is always true, also most people who actually commit suicide or seriously plan to tend not to tell anyone. Hence why you always hear or read stories about loved ones shocked someone they knew committed suicide. 
---
The ones that actual do tend to not to say so. But that's just my opinion and what I've read or seen.
---
Rs3 kiln much? Don’t think people will approve
---
Looks cool
---
They are in full nerf mode right now.
---
Might as well be parkour ....
---
you also had to bank the books lol.
---
it's like 30k/hr
---
Taaakeeee oooon meeeeeee

I don't need to give actual points, you're defeating yourself all on your own

Uh I've made 2 comments lmfao

Tell them you’re pregnant and it’s his.
---
If only saying it made it so.
---
Pick 2 spots to run in between for phase 1 and 2, focus on avoiding before hitting on wave 3, walk around Galvek and auto every few steps for wave 4. Use enchanted bolts, super anti fire if not ironman.
---
Show name?
---
People often use that kind of names for throwaway reddit accounts. Related to the case. Name has nothing wrong with it imo.
---
Holy fuck is this real? I’m F2P atm
---
Ye makes sense thank you
---
We won’t get particles in the client without them making a gpu renderer sadly.
---
I do too, it makes it honestly worth it, it makes your account more unique. And I commend people who do have higher levels.
---
Pretend to be busy at work
---
I thought it was earlier this week
---
Barrows and mole are the earlier bosses - you can start Barrows at \~50-60 combat (but it'll be slow) and mole after 70+ (dharoks). Both aren't brilliant cash but are decent for new accounts. Aside from PvM you can earn early cash through skilling (if you don't mind skilling). Blast Furnace is decent early cash, runecrafting is good money after L40 and hunter at 63+ will earn you bank through chin hunting. All up to you.  
---
Also, work towards daily tasks, like herb runs, battlestaffs and kingdom management when you get a chance
---
On that 99 grind lol. I love graceful and the revolves as outfits too
---

---
Former mod Gudi used to do it. It made me get quests done for korasi. Good times.
---
Imagine being so insecure you need to accuse a god of buying gold
---
Use the non judgemental bank chest
---
Lol frrl
---
that doesn't work out in practise though . put on barrows training slayer will earn u a spot on cutenoobs.
---
Shit like this is why I always bring either low alch runes or an explorer's ring with me into the wildy. If I'm risking even a single shark, I low alch it as soon as I get attacked.
---
Just because they're not polling it doesn't mean they can't take community feedback on it.
---
Zeah was more fun though, for me at least. :)
---
Sounds like something someone with multiple accounts would say
---
Noooiiiiicceeee
---
man that is fucking rough. I'd be raging if i were you.
---
Its pretty time efficient when you start, and for awhile after
---
all babys are ugly lol
---
How frustrating. Do you know why you don't receive emails from Jagex? Are they blacklisted or landing in spam?
---
How many new players do something like do tutorial island on perfectly efficient path, go directly to Doric's quest off donated items, powermine copper til 15 mining, and then do nothing but mine iron for 3+ hours straight?  Maybe someone rolling their new account for their nth youtube series, but so many players will just never take one of these efficient bot paths.
---
I would welcome this cycle.
---
No, the point of OSRS is that it's pre-eoc. This is literally the reason why it was made.
---
Anything else is something that came afterwards.
---
College graduation 😬
---
Separating pvp and pvm mechanics is up there with the worst of jagex mistakes
---
Im still waiting for them to start nerfing things that are actually an issue, like monsters dropping enormous piles of end game materials and alcheables.
---
imbuing isn't really efficient as magic is 0 time due to barraging slayer, it's more efficient to fletch darts in place of imbuing
---
No one cares , get baited
---
You act like you even have a say in this.
---
dart fletching is far more efficient than alching
---
do people actually take twitter seriously
---
Tutorial island doesn't even allow chat, which is shitty. If people were allowed to talk with others during the tutorial, it might make it feel a bit better.
---
Are you the guy with 100 of them that posts this crap everyday?
---
Yes I am a pleb with 96 qp. Bought rigour to out dps jads healers as I’m mobile only and keep fucking up. Going to start questing with camping vorkath as my goal. Zulrah would be the easier quest grind but I’ll never get barrows gloves if I don’t set my sights farther.
---
You should never use an account that wasn't created by you because the original owner can always recover it.
---
Because when done properly, it is the best rc xp in the game, even including imp trapping time.
---
Yeah but with the amount of people I see complain about it, it makes me wonder if I really did just get *very* lucky, or people just complain easily lol
---
SuperiorKami confirmed piece of shit
---
If your not going for pet or head always do Brutals
---
Not necessarily, there are tons of PVMers who are also maxed because the decided to just get it done with at some point. Most maxed people are skillers though yeah
---
&gt;NOBODY is asking for a stupid transport system right after tutorial island. what the fuck is this?
---
citation needed
---
The people who may have these complaints aren't those who would be on 2007scape reddit. Of course you're not hearing them complain.
---
Nah, it's gz and nice. No one says gj. Nice is for kc's and misc. Levels. Gz is for everything else, cause it's simple and no one cares that much
---
Wot
---
Now imagine being rewarded for equipping a *Barrows + Slayer helm, on top of Barrows item set is what I implied.
---
Rekt
---
An extended super antifire (or a regular one, prices are almost identical) is 11.5k a bottle, so \~3k a sip.  Each sip lasts 6 mins.  That's not excruciating but its not pennies.  Again, don't take my choice to lower my supply costs as an assault on your playstyle.  But in no universe is it 1k a sip.
---
Replace music with hunter. Music is too easy.
---
That was the wrong use of a wooosh. You should be ashamed of yourself.
---
I was just thinking that!
---
MAXIMUM. FUN.
---
Then whyd he bring it up?
---
Mod ash has just ascended to the level of super saiyan god ash
---
These aren't bosses, but a few ways to earn some good starter cash are doing passive money makers, like farming yanille hops and herbs, bird house runs, and buying battle staffs daily after completing varrock diaries.
---
For early bossing, mole and barrows we're brought up below...at low stats I definitely recommend barrows over mole though. Solo dagannoth Rex is also pretty decent for low level once you have Iban blast. But you're pretty much relying on getting berserker rings only, so dry streaks can be a bit tedious there.
---
They’re amazing to kill on an alt but on a main you’re better off just killing vorkath or zulrah
---
You can hunt for Imp Boxes (I was getting around 150 caught per hour), which lets you immediately bank up to 300 books (each caught Imp lets you bank 2 items).
---
The books allowed me to stay at 1 book location and bank around 50 of the same book with each inventory, mixing things up to keep the totals around equal.
---
If not for the 'nerf', I would have been able to just bank for a few of each book and run between the NPC's to turn the books until they ask for a book a don't have, that I could bank for and repeat.
---
Including the time to hunt for the Imps and to bank/use the Books it worked out a little faster than just getting each book as it's requested. Certainly not efficient for me to have done (even if not for the 'nerf'), but I quite liked the variety involved.
---
Problem with alching bolts is sometimes I’ll equip them because they’re not notable.
---
Crna makes 100-300k a year... a rn is 60-100...
---
I just did it on an alt and didn't have a single set of waves take more than 30 minutes. I got through all 4 roles in like 22 mins, 23, 25 and 28 min runs, all with randoms. It's possible if you don't just invite any random level 60 who probably didn't pay attention to the tutorial.
---
If you don’t enjoy pickpocketing then I see no harm in doing pyramid plunder. Just because you’re not getting the absolute best so rates doesn’t mean you’re playing the game wrong. There are multiple options to train skills for a reason. Not everyone enjoys the best methods in the game and that’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with taking worse xp rates for a method that doesn’t want to make you quit playing. This is a game after all and you want to be enjoying playing the game. If you’re only looking to get to 53 you should easily be able to do pyramid plunder. It’s extremely easy and can make you good money if you happen to get lucky.
---
From someone that’s deciding to go into that field I feel like it’s better to go the doctor route instead of crna. Is it not true it’s basically the same amount of schooling besides the 2 years of residency for doctors, which I wouldn’t  consider schooling since you get paid.
---
They don't stack and I can't note them, sadly.
---
it is 1:1 and i could do that
---
Chaos altar is best
---
Ahhhh did not know this 👍
---
it wasn't
---
If you dony have any friends what does your world number matter? If you're frequently world hopping it would be on your world select page. 
---
It's literally not information you need to actively see while you're playing either.. "oh good, I'm still on world 314, great to remember. These people around me are also on world 314. Neat. "
---
If you can honestly explain to me why the world number needs to be showing at all times, maybe I'll change my mind... but I doubt it.
---
well marginal profit if you leave offers in ge
---
Yeah, not played MS since like October last year.
---
Like the other guy said, chins work great! If not, just put your bow/crossbow/blowpipe on long range and just tag them slowly making sure to prioritize prayer switches first. If you have enough supplies who cares if he reaches full hp before you tag them all. At least you don't have to do it again
---
We can just have glitter that falls off
---
Then the guy you killed has even more reason to ruin future updates. Rince and repeat.
---
Is there a different way to tele to Rimmington besides house tele?  I moved my house to Hosidius for easy sand crab training, but I still want to be able to use other peeps houses, but there are no open houses in Hosidius lmao
---
You should burst dust devils since it’s way faster and you don’t lose money

Spartacus was huge for its time, True Blood too.

Boobs
---
Go ahead.. take a seat.
---
 Nobody camps it in a 1 vs 1. doesn't disable magic. It literally only lowers based on what you hit so use ice blitz at times. Drinking restore pot can be done with no tick delay. Also only does normal msb dmg so the opponent isn't forced to brew and instead can use the restore. I honestly don't see how it could affect pvp as much as you are making it out to be.

Btw, did you ever get your cape? Seems like you were also having trouble not too long ago. I hope you did. If not, keep your head up. We'll get there.
---
You're right, priding myself on my mathematics abilities I should have seen that.
---
Have you got any more specific info?
---
They're a bit long because of the amount of health they have. They are cannon able, and afk though if you use anti-fire, and they offer much better loot than similar Slayer level monsters. I don't have any hard number data for you unfortunately to tell you if they're ACTUALLY efficient, sorry.
---
Seercull is basically non-existant but you probably seen a tbow if you stayed at ge for any length of time.
---
You still lose energy from running tho
---
I agree with you but he is right. Discord is the place to be.
---
Jagex can't combat bots, it's been 19 years of 0 progress.
---
I'm not saying they need to get pmods to do Jagex's anti-bot teams job i'm just saying that purging all mods and starting from scratch with an increased roster could help combat them. Most bots that are muted can't tell they're muted so they'll just stand their spamming nothing.
---
They need to increase mute timer to 4 hours (2/3) of log in time.
---
My main point of the Pmdos though is to encourage the community to be positive towards new players and encourage growth in terms of account progression. Nobody likes to ask "Where can i train range" just to be met with the toxic shit that is this community.
---
Dunno who/what that is.
---
I love you both
---
Thanks for the heads up, i didn't end up using it.
---
I fell for it...
---
A pmod in j1mmy’s cc
---
I keybound all my gameboy emulator keys to left click and played through a ton of Zelda games while alching. It’s “against the rules” but literally impossible for Jagex to detect since it’s all manual clicking on their end. I don’t feel bad about it in the slightest, content that can be autoclicked is just unhealthy and terrible game design.
---
Can confirm this is true. I was also applauding.
---
Idk like 80% of the playerbase? Most people don’t use protection prayers so I’m assuming they either prayer nothing or camp piety.
---
🦀🦀🦀 Went shopping for a suit the other daaaaaaayyyyyy 🦀🦀🦀
---
Not exactly, for your BSN to qualify as pre-med you have a longer curriculum. After that, it’s  a 36 month program for anesthesia. No residencies, no interning, no fellowships, straight into practice. Most importantly though, they’re very different careers with different demands! Can’t argue that a physician isn’t going to make more than a CRNA, but I’ve wanted to be a CRNA for a long time. It’s a more relaxed lifestyle, rewarding patient care, with pay that’s good enough for me :)
---
But you didn't do anything stupid
---
No you both
---
It's almost definitely not efficient in terms of gold to xp compared to just base casting the spell, but you will get more xp/hr so it's up to you. It almost doubles the spell cost though for probably like 25% bonus xp (since the base xp gained for the cast is a lot of the xp you'll get).
---
I do wildy slayer tho
---
grinded out smithing and construction this week to do just this
---
How do you figure theyre starving?
---
Ah unfortunately we’re already out for the semester but I’ll keep it in mind for if I see him!
---
Uh oh, spaghetti-cOde
---
If it took 5 minutes to implement they should've done it ages ago instead of letting it stand this long and then deciding to do away with it seemingly out of nowhere, much like ZMI runners. Integrity changes being done on things that have been a part of the game for this long just feel wrong - what has changed to make these things suddenly stand out? To use a tired example, imagine if Jagex suddenly decided prayer flicking had to be removed as an integrity change. The only thing I can think of is that they want to push a new RC training method soon and don't want these methods to compete. Or they're trying to take the "RC slow lol" meme to the next level.
---
What makes you think they aren't doing something? Botwatch is an automated process, it's always doing something. If they did "nothing", the bots would outnumber humans many times over.
---
If they poll something that says 30k xp/hour, but it actually gives 45k xp/hr, do you think that should be changed immediately or ignored for a couple years then changed out of the blue after everyone's already decided it's fine?
---
Nah these mf ain't done a 99 yet. They dont know grinds. 
---
#gatekeeping

You can do that with rs3 max cape too

you couldnt afk collecting books, and it was mostly used by iron men who had to spend hours hunting imps.  apples to oranges.

Who touched your doodle as a child?
---
The problem I have is my small iPhone se. This is basically how it goes down:
---
Me: oh shit he stomped pray range
---
My fingers: turn Mage pray off. 
---
Me: oh wtf I'm not dead brew up
---
Also me: can't seem to click brew then over to prayer interface and switch before I get slapped again. Was doing the chin method before and there's to much going on to be able to keep an eye on jad at the same time. On pc you can quickly change interfaces with your keyboard and hover your mouse where you need to click. Don't have that luxury. I mean you can hover your finger but you get too close and your fucked. . I figure with rigour, anguish, slay helm, bp with ddarts he should die quickly.
---
Nah this is from when he was preparing to crossdress 
---
Can't wait for that in the remake
---
Neither is slayer, or quests.... which give combat related advantages. Whats your point?
---
I watched it. He has a wife and kid.
---
Dang. I got 40 magic yesterday and did waterfall quest to hit 31atk/strg today. Only thing is my HP is really low
---
Thanks for new scam suggestion lel
---
Yeah they do... what planet did you come from bud?
---
Pkers are powerless against $11 prayer level
---
Infernal eels should get you similar gp/hr and slightly more xp/hr than sacred eels
---
Minnows will give you better xp/hr than monkfish and over twice the gp/hr, but require pretty constant attention
---
Dark crabs make you something like 300k gp/hr and 40k xp/hr but obviously come with the risk of being PK'd
---
That being said keep in mind that it's usually better to do the fastest common experience method if it sacrifices a little GP, and use the time saved to do a better moneymaker. If monkfish are 40k xp/hr and you do monkfish to 99, you'd spend around 106 hours and make around 10.3m. If you barb fished at 65k xp/hr to 99, you'd only spend around 65 hours fishing and could use the other 41 hours to make substantially more than 10.3m at Zulrah, Vorkath, etc.
---
I'm still waiting for Hardleather (g)
---
I count at least 7 comments in response to me from your profile.  Why tell me to do something if it disproves your point?

being 1 def and complaining about others not hitting 0s on you

---
They should've made the crystal weapon/ armor seeds and new blade untradeable and made the crystal shards you charge them with, tradeable. This will make everyone try the content for the untradeables, and give the people who actually like the content to stay for profits.
---
Stuff you use to charge other things with tends to have higher value. Like whip vs kraken tent.

The 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm maximizes runes while getting no bolt racks, which overall gives max profit. Doesn’t affect clue rate but grats and gl lol

How does he talk to any mod like that* 
---
Like, they design our game, yeah mistakes happen (🦀🦀🦀) but overall I am satisfied how it went so far. Talking like that to anyone is just unnecessary.
---
As it stands now, if you don't enjoy the content you probably won't buy the crystal armor/weapon seeds or the blade in the first place. Since owning them requires having to do content you don't enjoy.

Drakes are a slow-ish 8 weight task. Similar to suqahs and gargoyles but slower. They're about the same as gargoyles in terms of profitability, so if you block or skip either gargoyles or suqahs you should block or skip drakes, especially if you don't have a dhl or dhcb.
---
Wyrms are also 8 weight but they die way faster, so i'd say skip or do them with an expeditious bracelet.
---
Doubt I’ll go that far, it’s an additional 10m do for 99 and likely an additional 70m.
---
I guess I’ll do it tho!
---
I’m so frugal with in game currency in all games lol.  I guess I’ll do it tho!
---
Sapnu Puas plzzz
---
Takes about 80m getting to 99 with oak dungeon doors. 160m+ for mahogany tables, but it's 2x the xp rate.
---
Not dying should be a priority so use supplies if necessary and don't take silly risks
---
Not nice.

I've completed all of the varrock museum fossils and I've been using my leftover small/medium/large fossils for the prayer xp, but I've been holding on to my rare fossils because I heard they might be useful in a future update. Does anyone know roughly how far away that might be? Should I hang on to them or just cash them in for the 200k prayer xp?
---
You have to enable the option, I think the primary concern for the ge tracking is people might fake data to manipulate prices (through modified clients etc)
---
If he’s gets going now he can get through about a third with only 3 or 4 shits in his pants. Maybe 2 if he loads up on fiber and is good at holding it.

I think this is the best way to play osrs. You train combat and make a lot of money. You just need some some teleport to make it more enjoyable.
---
Well now you’re allowed to criticize him
---
I watched a video day this morning saying that going either mythical capes or oak larders are the cheapest.  I don't have DS2 done yet so it would be oak larders for me.  Shouldn't take too long for me, 10 hours maybe.  Is this a good method still?
---
Each individual piece counts as warm clothing. The gloves and torch also count as individual pieces of warm clothing. So you can replace equipment slots as you get the pyro pieces for them without worry.

Yup you can make infinite supplies in CoX. Only downside to burning supplies is that you will use time to make more

This is probably a dumb question, but

I'm gonna be using BGS at Vorkath. Should I be using my special attack once per kill, or twice? If twice, how do I manage my spec energy, considering the bar won't be full for the next kill?

Also, what's the bare minimum for a BGS spec to carry on with the fight, without resetting?

they say so, have post about it on their twitter, ect ect. they have someones who's entire job is literally bot detection. this is just a case of if I don't see it, its not happening.

He also popularized the method which wasn’t THAT well known before he posted a video on it

This exact thing has happened to me today. Please let me know if you get it resolved.

what kind of logic is this

I've been running to campsite bank this whole time, I can't believe I didn't think of this. Thank you!

Thank you, you get it! He deleted his comment. Shame..
---
bro, if you get mage levels without hitpoints xp, ie. ( splashing or casting high level alch and or the curse weaken spells) you can get high enough levels for snare or even entangle to stop them. just do that. they wont make any changes to the wildy ditch cause "nostalgia " but i agree it does kinda make it so emblem farms can exist without any risk
---
I think that's the point he was making

How does he talk to any person like that even.

yea my bad. wasn't aware of the death runes xp rate which is really close to 28k
---
OlmMyGawd sooo Qute!
---
I know a lot of high level ironmen and none of them are complaining about the library. The meta is to do bloods most of the way from 77 to 99, not because of cash of afkness but because you need an absolute shitton of them for pvm and they're ridiculously expensive to buy from shops.

This is one of the best ideas I've seen. Allow multiple characters per account, if they want they can still require individual membership per character, but then they can add more levels of unique authentication without preventing legit alts.

Yeah you’re literally mashing the A button half the game getting through people talking to you

Congrats on telling us how you'd be fine with it, not that it means anything since y'know, 99% of new people won't feel the same way and just leave forever
---
It really is you get make rolls i did 99 firemaking this way in around 100 kills
---
*runs at walking pace*
---
All of the flavours out there and you choose to be salty
---
Firemaking cape should be lower

They are also basically mandatory. Anyone without magic has no chance at killing you but these mongoloids still think its the weakest style

Also why is your attack only 42 when your strength is 80? May I ask?

my ironman is my main, i'm a bit of a noob I've been playing for months slowly completing this clue. the steps were all over the world and it wasn't my main goal, kinda like a side project while I was exploring. I tried to do the hard one I had after this but i'm having a hard time with the mage guy popping up when I dig in the spot. so this was my first and only for a decent while
---
Prayer is only 50M? Assuming you've never gotten it because it's way more
---
That looks bad af, the infernal and fire cape patterns dont realy fit the max cape either. Any other of the capes look amazing tho

Yep this is 100% the way to go. Wildy slayer is great for this. Makes your experience with slayer so much better if you can start with a full blocklist and 1k slayer points.

---
The sum of all the skills shown is 1390.
---
Take your total level of 1536 and subtract 1390, you get 146.
---
So we have 146 levels unaccounted for, and two skills left.
---
146 happens to be 2 times 73.
---
Assuming you kept the pattern of getting all your levels to 73, which I’m assuming is a safe bet, we now know all of your account’s levels.
---
Simply put, this means your account is getting hacked, gg kid.

Yeah, but many would tie it to people buying bonds to afford the hats for their pets.

I love how "I dont care about settled" has become some peoples defining personality trait on this page, they have that little else going on.

It's what we all do when people talk about a TV show we dont care about.

Ourania altar
---
Haven’t done desert treasure Lol chill out man, no reason to get upset
---
those are expensive to make, consider doing pray pots instead
---
Oh really? I could’ve sworn the wiki had mentioned it. Thanks for the heads up
---
I mean, it was a range. 45 to 50. I coulda been more precise, sure, but I figured no one was going to be so pedantic over a couple thousand xp/hr and just went with nice round numbers.
---
Just remove the non BiS east dock, it's time.
---
Reported for botting
---
I used to continue with a kill as long as I hit 35+
---
Now my range is a bit higher so if I hit a 20 or higher I usually continue with the kill, can be a bit slow though.
---
Well the golden chest and the sarcaphagus both give a sceptre but the sarcaphagus takes like 6 seconds for 10 str xp and a 1/1k chance at a few mil. You're better off simply training your thieving unless you're super strapped for cash
---
Ehh I don’t feel bad shelling out 250k for palms but regular trees like Magic’s or maples tend to get expensive.
---
Just connect the docks
---
Not every ironman is going for perfect efficiency 99/200m all. I'm sure there are plenty of ironmen who aren't sitting around with thousands of gold bars in their banks at all possible times.
---
Yeah I am doing pyramid plunder mainly for the scepter, I have one now but I would like to keep one so I can craft the other into the occult altar.
---
I like rc

The *her* you're talking about is the questcape lady in the post.

I actually made a post explaining why black d hide chaps don't have a defense requirement. You can give it a read if you want.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/arfrx7/the\_reason\_dhide\_vambraces\_and\_chaps\_dont\_require/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/arfrx7/the_reason_dhide_vambraces_and_chaps_dont_require/)
---
Huh, I'm really intrigued as to how I came out as upset
---
To add onto what other people are saying, the most efficient method utilises imp boxes to bank the books as you collect them the first time around, which you have to catch first (and are factored into xp/hour)
---
So it ends up being around 80k xp/hr *and* I believe 30k hunter xp an hour.
---
So it's ridiculously efficient for a basically free method, although I still wish they didn't nerf it considering how smart the method is.

I’m still decently low combat and slayer, so I haven’t really opened up to the better money making methods. You have any suggestions for some of my stats?
---
Yeah that's what I meant. Don't really see the point cause the person manually casting always has a noticable advantage
---
I miss the old forums lol.
---
Honestly same, but then i boot it up and the amount of shit on the screen annoys me.
---
@Jagex
---
Can you please elaborate on what you mean?
---
Well im going to afk bloodrune because this might be nerfed too
---
Dude 
---
I didn’t even notice where you commented your degree
---
I thought BSN was short for like best In slot now or something
---
Lmao
---
What are the mechanic reasons? In your post you only said it doesn't make sense because it's different from magic and melee equipment? 
---
Making it so pures can't wear d hide champs isn't going to make them risk more. It's going to make them risk even less. If you want pures to risk more, why not ask for mystic/infinity defense requirement be lvl 1? They don't give defensive bonuses anyway...  
---
I don't think you're like this, but I think a good amount of the people asking for d hide chaps to have a defense requirement just want pures to be nerfed... The thing is, changing d hide chaps wouldn't affect pures much anyway, outside of making them mad. Pures would still be the strongest builds below 80 combat, which is what they are now. They'd still get shit on by voiders/zerkers above 80 combat, which is what happens now. And they'd still shit all over the low level "mains," who I suspect are the only group that actually hates pures... 
---
And I realize there are a lot of people that think d hide champs should have a defense requirement just because it makes sense, but I don't think most of them really care. I don't think they're the people actively trying to get d hide changed. After all, only a small minority of the playerbase regularly interacts with players that have less than 40 defense...

I’m playing ffxiv for the combat but the go here kill X go here get this is getting boring.
---
Nice strawman lmfao, that's EXTREMELY different.  You're comparing OP BIS items to a training method that's not even the fastest exp/hr.  I'm not saying "Don't like tbow? Don't use it." I'm saying "Don't like training with a dragon longsword? Use something else." As it isn't even the best exp/hr lmao for ironmen.  
---
As for 1.5 tick teaks, that's literally the BEST exp an hour, for ALL accounts, nothing else comes close to rivaling it and it was unpolled, unintended and is not being addressed, and was not addressed in the Q&amp;A today.  That's VERY different from polled content which isn't the best exp/hr in the game.
---
Thanks for making my point easy to make.

Dude a guy coming up to me and saying hello isn't scary. I never said I was scared of talking to people. I'd be just as uncomfortable with a woman I didn't know hitting on me randomly.

100% if mobile client wasn't released, I wouldn't play OSRS. It reminded me of the game and I was excited to see they brought back a classic. Then I remembered how grindy some shit was and realized that grinding on mobile was absolutely perfect
---
That dock is only for when you want to cook at the range on your way back to the bank
---
When verifying your google accounts. Are you talking about your Authenticator? 
---
Also I’ve never had this issue with a vpn while playing. 
---
And symbols in your passwords aren’t a thing so I don’t think that’s the issue. Jagex won’t allow you to have them at all. Neither is it case sensitive.

Grind some zulrah for bp, do DS2 or mm2 and try to get an anguish. Or use karil and switch for a rcb for frogs and jad.

I like the one on the small island off of fossil island
---
Nice, 3rd age item from drop is on my “to achieve” list :]
---
If you're a main, I'd suggest bastion potions instead of range as they boost range as well as defence - never know when you might make a small mistake and take damage. 
---
Also if you can somehow invest in a blowpipe, it'll cut your caves time in half. Other than that, I guess it's good enough. I'd always say brews + restores just to be safe
---
Max cape indicates that they have plenty of time to play. That means you have time to improve your skill level and do the content.
---
That shows that you either gave up and decided not to be good at the game or have reached your skill ceiling and will never be good at the game.

No. If you install runescape on your phone and log in using Google you sort of need to connect the account somehow to be able to play on other platforms. I don't have an authenticator. The first password didn't have symbols, only letters and numbers. But all my other passwords I use have symbols. It's tough remembering more than 4 passwords so I tend to reuse them and I don't like to us other passwords or I won't remember them. But yeah. I was playing just when I got kicked out. So it wasn't like someone actually logged in while I was away or something. I'm just very frustrated with not knowing whether it's okay to use a VPN, and having to make up a completely new password only to not know whether I'll get kicked out again to have to make up yet another password.
---
Yeah, i probadly should have put that in the titel
---
This honestly makes sense LOL fuck
---
I would suggest you to explore the game and learn it's basic mechanics, after some time you can read the wiki for efficient training skill or bossing strategies. Depends on how you want to play, some like pvp, skilling, pk or just to grind everything. See what category you fall in.
---
Use a pendant on the strange machine in the house on the hill and all your pendants will have an option to teleport directly to the house, where there's a magic mushtree like 5 tiles away. Verdant valley first then mushroom meadow.
---
Uh-huh, so you think *every single ironman* in the entire game, no matter what level they are or what their account focus/goal is, has thousands of gold bars sitting in their bank. Right..
---
I'm not sure why you felt the need to try to be so pedantic in the first place. The original guy clearly asked about having *emeralds* in his bank and I replied and said that it depends how long it takes to convert the emeralds to jewelry. I even said "**if** you have to go out and buy/mine gold..." If he wanted a specific answer about having emeralds **and** gold bars already in his bank, he'd have included that in his question.
---
Well you get 2x more xp per bone, essentially cutting bones needed by half. If you're short on cash/bones you can play it safe by using a bone on the altar and hovering over the logout button while you automatically use your bones.
---
Hi There! Thank you very much for taking the time to raise awareness and make this post. I've spoken to Player Support and they were already looking into the account thanks to an in-game report. I encourage you all to report in-game if you see something similar to this post that needs flagging to Jagex.

RS3 player here -  are divine super combat potions essentially slightly weaker overloads?

Wilderness Guardians is most active and old clan. We don't do pvm/pvp with unranked players, becos they might be spying/scamming. If you didn't recive a confirmation email, you could always let us know about it, and we would fix the problem.

Anyway, I'm not sure if we will accept you, after acting like a child.

Oh god. I’ve been wearing leather chaps for 3 years
---
DON'T DELETE THIS MAN'S BOOKS, JAGEX
---
I clearly said mid and high level ironmen.

Maybe you should just stop commenting on ironman training methods since you clearly don't know much about the gamemode, and refuse to accept basic facts like how it's completely normal for ironmen to end up with a huge stack of gold bars and nothing to use them for.

There are updates, but the community can vote and it's something like 75% yes to implement new stuff.

You've been slacking on your farming I see.

Can't do it.  It would spook the fish.

Realistically there shouldn't be any impact on the price, seeing as only ironmen could take advantage of it. Wondering, did the Ironman cave have any impact on Corp drop prices?

That’s my “shit my pants run and don’t want it rubbing against my taint” run

I think you may have missed the point.
---
You can go from 1-99 fletching in about 4 hours by making darts. It requires no skill or effort beyond using an item on another item repeatedly. The time investment in this achievement is low, as is the skill requirement.
---
If you want to do MA2 you must first train your magic to 60 to unlock the god spells. You then have to complete MA1 and unlock all 3 god spells. Assuming we go the Tbow  route, we then have to train our ranged skill to 75 and our magic skill to 75 to both start and complete the minigame. You then need to go into one of the most dangerous areas in the game and engage in some PvM with at least 3 different enemies. 
---
While neither 99 Fletching or MA2 are particularly challenging achievements, the fact of the matter is that one requires a higher level of skill and a far greater investment of time than the other.

WHY IS SHE SO THICC
---
Its SSS tier alongside with red, blue and green cape
---
Why is Mining S tier?
---
My friend and I did duo bandos. Probably a combined KC of like 60-70. Before the first kill, we got a Tassets drop from a minion since we didn't know what to do and I thought killing minions first would help.
---
Drops from the actually boss have been 1 BCP, 2 Boots, 1 Hilt, and the pet.
---
My friend died and I finished off the kill. The pet appeared behind him in Lumbridge.
---
We are terrible at the game
---
Nowadays with celastrus/hespori/calquat/redwood/hardwoods you can get pretty good xp doing a run a day for under 1gp/xp. I did that plus papaya and got 99 farming in a few months with pretty minimal effort.
---
Probably alts for the sweatiest rs players
---
I think they will 'feel' good to use too, which is important. I often forget to repot in slayer tasks, for instance, and it's one less thing to worry about.
---
Block if you don’t have cannon

That’s not on. Racism and homophobia isn’t a good look no matter how you play. C’mon friends.

Ayyy girl how's you xoxo
---
How does it devalue lance?
---
Bonus points if you throw up overheads for most of the fight, only to turn them off a moment before you're killed. They'll think they've smited you for your +1.
---
I'd say to drop magic to either D or F tier. Sure, it's expensive to get to 99 through bursting at MM1 or MM2 tunnels. But if you do slayer and burst the tasks you easily can, you'll get 99 magic a VERY long time before 99 slayer.
---
I'm 95 magic now 260k to 96. My next Nech task will probably get me 96 and I'll profit alongside incredibly good slayer XP.
---
HP cape could go down to. Unless it's untrimmed, it's literally just a skill that you'll eventually get 99 in just by not being a skiller. untrimmed 99 on the other hand requires a bit of effort to ensure you don't max any other stats 1st. Like, flexing on someone because you got 99 HP and they don't is basically saying, "I've done more hours of combat then you have!"
---
Also while I don't disagree with how annoying they are, you can AFK mining from like 35 and at 72 it gets even easier to AFK with the upper level MLM while smithing is profitable and pretty decent XP as far as I remember if you do blast furnace. It's still a slow process but it's profitable and not even one of the slower skills on the list. If you wanted to you could even do profitable blast furnace then later just drop the profit on gold ores to finish off 99 much faster.
---
When you spirit tree into your house, which tree is it?
---
Quickness?
---
Gross
---
Yikers
---
Yeah could probs go for 99, especially when i still have 30 spirit saplings sitting too which are pretty neato xp
---
I did NOT know you could  ank those books, damn

60 onyx bolt tips? wasnt that drop nerfed months ago...

is that auto-enabled? Where do the pictures get saved?

I sometimes end up risking quite a lot due to muscle memory. If I do a farm run immediately after wilderness content, there is a good chance that I will click my POH obelisk instead of my nexus. Ending up in 50 wilderness with 2.4m in saplings and coconuts isn't a fun experience.

There would be some impact due to drop trading to mains. Not large, I'd imagine, but there would be *some*.

He has 4 Ahrim's Skirt, which is like the 2nd most expensive item AFAIK.

He's also around 2 items over drop rate (should be at around 16 items).

Nice again.

I just love the crabs in parentheses..

Best of luck, mate. It's been a great 5-and-a-bit years of working with you!

It's not going to be better than lance at dragons tho. At best it devalues the hasta?
---
He is the greatest quest guide ever in the history of forever always.
---
Thank you for doing this for us every week! We will all miss MMK.
---
Because maybe he's proud of the achievement and wants to share it with someone he loves?
---
Mat :(
---
Yeah so quit now but give me your bank to hold first.

Slayer dart (e) has a 29 max hit on task with Slayer's helm at level 75 magic. Without the helmet it has the same max hit of 25 as Iban's Blast.

SHIT NO MORE JMOD TO CLOWN WITH EMILY MEMES.
---
It was 5 minutes ago. Even big news take a little time to spread. 5 minutes is nothing. Stop acting like it's been a whole week since the post was made.
---
Ancient staff on ancients...
---
this comment must be part of the contract
---
take emily with you
---
This wise man is killing the crab meme in style
---
It doesn't cover the back of the head

Oh boy

No one:
---
Zoidberg: your meme is poorly executed and you should feel poorly executed
---
Slowest?
---
Really sad to see Mod Mat K go. 
---
I found it strange that he  started streaming on Twitch recently, now I know why... Jagex had to.. uhm.. rebalance "existing content"...
---
I wonder why he left though, he doesn't mention it in his message. Unless the first sentence implies he's no longer full of optimism and excitement and that's why he decided to leave. Understandable.
---
Osrs is the only game
---
We’re fucked
---
Emily on suicide watch
---
That period seems so passive aggressive with the no to me and I can't stop laughing for some reason.
---
Why were limproots weight increased?
---
Most other Jmods get their own post when they leave, when mat leaves it's 'other news'
---
Good luck with your future endeavours, and may Emily bless your future as well!
---
Jokes aside, thanks for everything you've done for our community!
---
Ahh the underwater content most people didn’t even do got nerfed, what an interesting choice that is
---
It's a good idea but there will always be scouts at least this way it wont be as simple as putting a bond on a level 3 though.
---
It's still not, so rest easy. We'd prefer to focus on wishing Mat K the best than any MTX fearmongering.
---
wait
---
Twitch Prime also has one month free osrs membership so you can do that also for free one month.
---
Please have Mod Mat K come back on stage for the RuneFest reveals!
---
This spelling has been braught to you by the American education system.

They’ve changed the contact email address and put on their own Authenticator, which is why it won’t accept your authenticator. I found a forwarding address had been added to my email account. Consider checking that that hasn’t happened.
---
He's the reason I left rs3 to start fresh on OSRS ... I was so caught in Crack the Clue 1 that I ended up making my first osrs char to crack it and never left the game since.
---
Sad news :c
---
There are captcha solving services that are dirt cheap
---
Ash no longer actively plays, you sure this logic is sound?
---
Sad times, gonna miss you Mod DadK

What happened to the infinite charges on the lyre? I thought the poll passed.

bigger and better things, probably.

---
Generalising is a good thing, isn't it?
---
I see you're not English, 96% of the time they get the weather forecast wrong.
---
They said it would be overcast on Saturday but otherwise dry and not windy and it spent the entire day raining
---
And it will also act as a good selling point on your resume for a higher paying gig. Jagex' is notoriously low pay for the pricey area or living
---
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Gambit literally said in a comment *you replied to* that MTX is not coming. Mat K [has said](https://twitter.com/JagexMatK/status/934729549857939456) that MTX will not come unless voted in. I even remember him mentioning the Chinese overlords don't want it in our game, but I'm unable to find the post from a quick search.
---
It is fearmongering.
---
fkin beautiful lmfao
---
Nah, no way, Jagex knows full well what will happen if MTX were introduced, OSRS will go downhill just like RS3.
---
I'm just saying if you want access to all the skills and stuff you had, it's not gonna show up on OSRS.
---
When they re-released the game in 2013, everyone's account was reset to level 3 base stats.
---
I'm sure you still want access to the account, and that's fair. But I just wanted to let you know that if you put in all that time before 2013, before OSRS came out, most likely you'll have to play RS3 to gain access to everything.
---
Best of luck to ya!
---
shut up idiot
---
It’s just what society does. Not ideal but that’s what happens.
---
This is worrying, imo. Let's just hope there is some sort of internal shuffle around or something. Mat K has vocally been so anti MTX, i'm praying this has nothing to do with that and we don't see the hiring of some corporate/consultant type.
---
YAHHHoooooo!
---
...You know who else has been at Jagex for \~15 years?
---
Ok give me the approx. Cost
---
Didn't you scam a t-bow and infernal gear from some cc?
---
Thanks, Mat. Good luck
---
Let’s hope he joins the WoW classic dev team 😭
---
I like the idea of this. Be cool to see
---
Your touch will be felt.
---
Gambit awnsered your MTX concerns so still trying to say Mat K leaving means the MTX apocalypse is fearmongering.
---
Look at the photo. It’s a meme.
---
I like how you still blocked swedishfishes name even though dude shouts him out.
---
Damn.. Mat was the best tbh.
---
My favorite Jmod of all-time. Best of luck Mat, you’ll be missed.
---
Good. Coloured clouds it too RS3.
---
rawrrr xD
---
Not always. It depends on who's the target. I'm not racist or anything, but perfect example is the crime rate statistics on black people. I don't see generalising there.
---
Grats my man! I recently hit base 70 too with rc as the last skill. Keep on going
---
The people who won't ever visit the POH?
---
I respect their decision, but I also think its fucking stupid lol. Why not poll this????
---
Such a nice update.
---
Some of my fondest memories were with MMK and ash, watching the team begin to grow in 2013. The loot from X streams, arma killing people in the grand tree, etc were amazing times. Good luck MMK
---
update of the year
---
??? crafting is a great thing to do..
---
Nothing can get ahead of my rc unfortunately. 99 rc gang repping. Hunter is my lowest at 68, next highest is 82 so it'll be a while. I sort of want to leave hunter for near last tbh.
---
"No."
---
I dont get it
---
Scrub through the video, the struggles are clear.
---
its normal to quit a job for a new start somewhere else? this is new to me.
---
It was pretty funny but i dont think a lot of people here got the joke :/
---
Stupid bot
---
Oh. 
---
I took this one as a salute/send off type "you know what to do" but yeah.
---
F
---
You're wasting extreme xp by visiting the Fishing guild in the first place. Lol.
---
us
---
&gt;shut up idiot
---
Thank you for that eloquent and delightful response
---
when i got my first bond, i did 1-99 fletching within the 2 week timespan. i made 13m doing it. i think i strung magic bows
---
About 1bil
---
This wasn’t polled.
---
This is really fucking worrying. Mat K has backbone and despite all the memes he has held the future of the game and the community as the most important things.
---
Hopefully this isn't a prelude for the coming of MTX or other bullshit.
---
Whatever you will do in the future this community will be supporting you, thanks Mat!
---
Ofc the wu posted this on their official channel
---
Unless he wouldn't be able to play if he didn't fish at the fish guild, this is indeed a complete waste of time
---
Shut up idiot.
---
Ash and maz have been there forever and I'm sure some rs3 mods
---
Holy Moses thanks, I will dm you.
---
Excuse me mr juicebox can you please give back the twisted bow you scammed off a friend of yours, he would like it back
---
Full time streamer. Maybe with cat makeup
---
Yeah obviously that'll be the second one. Never enough lewd.
---
120 years is a long time.
---
If by yes you can achieve all 99s in one day you mean you have all 98s and then get them all 99 yes???
---
I'm gonna miss his stories during the Q&amp;As.
---
muh 2t house
---
Swear it feels like he's the only mod keeping it all together, especially when it comes to customer support.
---
Seriously, too many brainlets here on Reddit. Mat and multiple other mods have stated multiple times that MTX wont come to OSRS unless its voted for. And they even said that upper mangement understands that the community does not like nor appreciates MTX.
---
Actually sad feelsbad
---
shut the fuck up idiot.
---
And he'll also be able to publicly roast the Jmods on reddit when something goes wrong ... can't wait to see that! His reddit post's history is already a gold mine.
---
Well no because that’s just fact. Black people are incarcerated more than white people but that’s because they were born into terrible situations like ghettos/projects (are they the same thing?) and mostly have no choice.
---
That's why he flexes on us by posting on Reddit.
---
I'm already thinking Matt leaving is  where the end starts
---
already got the mask and b ring now
---
This is a very sad day in OSRS's timeline.
---
I wanted this to be a troll post/crab meme so bad. This sucks. Mat was adamant about relaying the concerns of the player base to upper management in terms of MTX. Really hope he didn’t see the writing on the wall and gout out while he could. 
---
Gl to Mat, he will be missed.
---
aww so cute :3
---
We're sorry for all the crabs, it was just a meme! Please don't go ;_;
---
In high demand fields yes
---
I absolutely disagree, balance changes should be made based on how players are playing the game, not based on a poll of how players thought they wanted the game to be played.
---
Cant do right now. I will try to watch it later.
---
ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
---
How do I beat the game
---
I feel sorry for you. May RNGesus be with you.
---
You have an active subscription to retail wow? Your opinions on what makes a good game are now instantly disregarded. Classic WoW will blow retail wow out of the water as OSRS did to RS3.
---
I feel bad for Ash, I just hope he truly enjoys working for Jagex, so many people look to him for help.
---
Max cape is F tier imo
---
Oh shoot I got doxed
---
yo wtf we didn't vote for this, rollback now
---
ummm... someone threatening suicide and your concern is what they do with their rs account ?
---
???
---
In those pvp challenges i see on youtube
---
You can’t f yourself
---
Could you also add the "make x - all" buttons to the regular smithing interface?  Like the one you've added to the goldsmithing interface.
---
Suggestion i made a couple weeks ago got some support: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bh7g52/qol_suggestion_update_the_smithing_interface_so/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Ah ok
---
MMK had a pretty good sense of humor, I would've gotten tired of things much sooner
---
Jagex only gives out beginner level salary and benefits and likely can’t offer those with super real talent actual growth. I could see even ash or ghost leaving but ash’s salary is probably the highest in the company id imagine.
---
Best of luck to him in the future, good things come to an end but for him it's hopefully for the better. And let's not forget that he's not leaving us behind forever, I will be looking forward to his streams and the progress of his old-school adventure as "One of us" now, may he take care and things go as best as possible for him.
---
I got lucky at pretty much everything else besides this and Sire, but I'd trade it all in to not have to do Gorillas anymore 😭
---
Yeah I hate the “but you can just grind vork for better money and do faster methods” like okay, but maybe I don’t want to grind vork? Not everyone has fun fighting the same boss over and over again
---
There are apparently also settings for drops over xxx amount.
---
My buddy set it to do that but then changed his large drop notification to like 25k for when he wasn't paying much attention.
---
That folder exploded from his slayer grind.
---
Watch Jad, attack a single healer, watch Jad, attack a single healer, continue until you got all four on you. It’s not that hard if you stay collected

Lol nerfing underwater training?
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
Is this on the website?
---
Russian bots even in osrs sub? Wow
---
Yeah, but so are all the other mods
---
ngl alot of the "balancing" lately is dumb af imo. i feel like the new jmods have nothing better to work on so they makes changes that hurt ppl who wanna put more effort in. like if we're gonna nerf these methods we should nerf tick manipulation too right? makes no sense
---
I don't even do that, I just stand in front of NMZ with melee gear just standing there and clicking once every 4 minutes so it doesn't log me out. No wonder that I have 1000 hours of play time and shit stats
---
you know the runes
---
Understandable. Demonics are a pain in the ass if you go dry on em.
---
Only support this if it makes you move from a safe area to a non safe area by accepting the trade tbh
---
What a load of bullshit. Vanilla private servers (and other xpacs) have been up and running for 10+ years with hundreds of thousands of players and millions of accounts created. Current wow is a fucking joke. You can do LFR  and get the same gear as mythic level raiders lmfao
---
which ones?
---
Lol that shit took me 13 or 14 attempts, finally got it on task. Don't think I'll ever go back
---
I mean going to a library to get books is how you’d get better irl
---
the original comment is 
---
" go to edgeville and say racial slurs"
---
"cba"
---
so basically the guy saying cba interpreted the original comment as telling him to go to edgeville, and he cba.
---
Oh shoot I got doxed 😮
---
Do I have to equip my fire staff for the unlimited fire runes?
---
Osrs is doomed. We only have Ash keeping it alive at this point

https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Optimal_quest_guide
---
You will be missed Kemplos!
---
me?
---
Wasnt he the invinicble corp guy?
---
Is he finally leaving to stalk Emily full time?
---
He also said that the Jagex owners have not tried to push MTX onto OSRS, so this idea of him defending OSRS from MTX is nonsense. Its good he was so passionate about keeping MTX out, but there is no reason to think now hes gone anything will change.
---
The point is they wont care. Jagex is owned by another company who could want a quick influx, and then dumo the company after the fact. Companies buy dying companies all the time for shit like this.
---
Imagine accidentally getting a 99, best kind of accident
---
Cor blimey mate, What are ye doing in me pockets?
---
Wait so one random kid screenshots one random dude saying racist shit and suddenly that's the representation of thousands of players?
---
Thanks for the reply Sween. My main concern was that MMK was let go under bad terms, as he was always known to fight for game integrity and the player. This helps alleviate that concern.
---
He's been promoted to customer.
---
The shields are down boys, fire at will!!
---
Get some runes and splash the ardy knight😂
---
to go be with emily?
---
As someone with a 16.5 year old account, id love to see some sort of 5/10/15 year veteran capes in the game.
---
If you recognize a flaw and perpetuate it instead of trying to actively address it, that makes you a knobhead.
---
Nothing on twitter, nothing on the update post, calling BS.
---
It's not though. You're making shit up to push a false narrative.
---
🦀no we didn't🦀
---
fuck yeah nigga
---
Plot twist: He left Jagex to be with Emily so Reddit won't blame him for shit that happens whenever Jagex fucks up something bad.
---
True, definitely at first. But it could become a success like bonds are. All depends on what they come up with and what the impact is on the gameplay.
---
Moving in with Emily
---
Any proof on that?
---
I’d love for this to turn into a thread praising good mods and devs.
---
Also the rocks spawn in half the time so you’re never waiting. Proper power mining.
---
I'm sorry were you dropped on your head as a child?
---
Aside from bonds, the only other form of MTX which won’t entirely ruin the game are cosmetics. Any pay to win MTX won’t fly with the community
---
Every build is different. High enough so you don’t get specced out, low enough so you don’t raise your combat. Most pures just go for 99 HP anyway.
---
I just figured since this was r/2007scape we were talking about osrs, not RS Classic or RS2.
---
Morrowind and Oblivion have the best animations
---
recording meta as well
---
Why would someone like Mat K?
---
1) With a baseless mentality, he argued that all forms of AHK are equal to botting, even simple 1:1 remaps.
---
2) Supported shutting down "Runelite" as soon as it started competing with his overlord "OSB", and backed the awkward situation with the most vague/senseless claims.
---
3) Defended Mod Jed when he was at full fault for serious corporate wrongdoings.
---
4) And if that wasn't enough, his favorite past time seemed to be leaving "jokes" about Emily on reddit (which you'd enjoy if you're challenged), hoping that the community will take them as "sarcasm", which weren't that at all... but in reality, he publicly showcased how much of an actual p word he was being and probably will always be (which is what you'd come to realize if you're not challenged).
---
Definitely a rock-bottom employee (the worst) if you think about it.
---
Break up with her and find you another girl who would appreciate hard work.
---
🦀🦀🦀 Remod Mat K 🦀🦀🦀
---
Basically mythic + is the only reason I decided to stay subbed at this point so that should tell you what I think about it lol.
---
I agree with you on classic dungeons. They aren't bad by any means, and neither are the raids really, but we've come a longggg way.
---
So is 1.5 tick woodcutting but most people do afk redwoods. Harder methods should reward you.
---
Why do people hate smoothing so much? It looks weird playing a game at 50fps and your characters animation is like 5 fps. I’ll take that little skip in the run animation over that any day.
---
That's when you crack out a blowpipe and start tagging monsters so he doesn't get kills haha
---
Unregistered hypercam 2
---
&gt; I'd imagine the only MTX they could get away with without a huge riot would be Runemetrics for Oldschool
---
Good fucking luck gimping/banning 3rd party clients "without a riot" lmao. 
---
People rioted over the damn different colored skins from twitch promos dude.

I thought the pride event was Mod Wolf's idea?

🦀🦀🦀JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST 2 WEEK NOTICES🦀🦀🦀

🦀🦀JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST US🦀🦀
---
Or give them 0 stats same as the champion's cape
---
Revenants are already best GP/hour PVM in the game. The wildy bosses are for pet hunts, not best profit. We don’t need more inflation in the game.
---
For now let's try to not normalize the idea of more mtx being enevitable. If jagex sees we accept that it is just a matter of time then they will push for it. If we continue to act as if it is taboo then they may be more hesitant.
---
This is bait.
---
He’s probably referring to the one that was playable during Blizzcon. People were able to play it from their battle.net launcher at home with a digital Blizzcon ticket, and the line at the con was full for the majority of the weekend. I’d say that was pretty successful.
---
To buy everything to do in 4 hours you need 1b
---
Low quality bait.
---
lmao; based reddit community
---
I love this sub
---
This meme is actually quite fitting for this sub.
---
Yea new mod, new event, new memes.
---
Those were good times, osrs streams felt a lot more personal back then
---
I think it should be made F2P, with only one extremely slow Xp/hour course, making it the slowest skill in F2P. Add some Agil shortcuts to F2P too. Then, while at it, change Agility shortcuts to fail less with higher Agil lvl, so 99 Agil never fails a 40 Agil shortcut (like one can do currently)
---
I never said anything about making them best gp/hour. I only said to make their drops worth the risk.
---
This is so wrong. Classic is miles better then BFA, and ive played classic for 2 years on privateservers - still not bored.
---
Services like 2captcha exist where you can pay a cent or two and have the captcha solved by a real person...
---
Trying to make Runescape a RTS... ffs
---
Attack bonuses: makes sense, seeing more = hitting more. Support.
---
Strength bonuses: would instantly devalue all full helms
---
Please no glitter/dust particle shit.
---
Its about 650m/hat on rs3. Gp is at around 0.1-0.15$/M on RS3 I think.
---
So that would be about 5x65$ if you sold them.
---
about 5x100$ if you tried to buy them.
---
I do not support any RWT(appart from bonds), and just did the research right now by using google. (Tbh you could have done that too)
---
This is bait to trigger irons
---
Could care less. Run energy is an issue in f2p that needs to be addressed for the sake of new player retention. 
---
It also doesn’t take away from p2p. Make a lumby rooftop course with a trash xp/hr rate. Let’s people get levels, thus longer run time, but isn’t detrimental to p2p.
---
Sad to see you go mate. Enjoyed all the love you and your team put into the game from the beginning. All the best.
---
Nope
---
Well somehow the OSRS community has a higher proportion of racists and sexists than general population, on top of lots of trolls thinking it’s funny to be racist or sexist or homophobic in-game. I don’t think that a new mod who encourages PC behaviour will change anything, so MTX is still the biggest worry
---
like for example with magic you can use it as a combat skill and fight monsters, or you can use it as a utility skill and use it for teleporting, or you can use superheat item and use it to train smithing along side it. some skill have multiple ways for training them with varying results. However runecrafting is a one way skill and because of that and the fact that it's slow to train, it would make sense for them to merge the skills together.
---
Yeah I tried ironmeme for a little, I prefer normal play but it’s definitely fun
---
Beautiful opinions and subjective feelings towards the subject man. Glad you feel that way.
---
Didn't he wants comment on Reddit that he would quit if they brought MTX to OSRS?
---
The oldschool team are sad?
---
I bring alchs and alch excess rune bars and pray augury to chug through excess sanfews. Not the most efficient but at this point im 6k+ kc no pet and i just want this shit over with. But yeah my inven is clogged.
---

---
Yeah doing that for triple jads helped me a ton, makes you feel more in control
---
Get 1 of each bead from imps.
---
No i'm a player that actually cares about the value and state of the game, you want to **DOUBLE** the supply, the prices are going to crash so fucking hard it won't even be funny, just like birdhouses did with saradomin brews, and then jagex tried to stable it and failed hard with removing nests from vorkath and nerfing the birdhouses.
---
Good, this man unlawfully banned my first osrs account right before I left for the United States Navy. I was banned for goldfarming/macroing. I had and have never broken any rules in osrs. I tried to appeal multiple times and my appeal has YET to be looked at. Good ol Mod Matt K put out a statement saying "there were no unlawful bans". I was not the only one with this issue, it actually affected people I knew personally too. This prick could not admit that he made a mistake. Seriously man, It still irritates me to this day whenever I think about it and it has been 6 years. I was so excited when this first came out. YOU managed to snuff that out pretty damn quickly. After boot camp and months of schooling. I started playing on a second account I made. I still play from time to time now. But damn...seriously sucked and still sucks that this man did that.
---
Now you can finally tell that pesky pker to fuck himself in the wilderness
---
What about untrimmed HP and Slayer?
---
nah I wish
---
kbd, vork (melee), rune drags?
---
it's definitely still a good item and honestly pretty cheap for its value as a tank shield that still supplies str bonus
---
Well yeah, I know it's stupid. But some people think that way.
---

No joke when I first started OSRS my wife had left me the day before. I was super depressed and just mindlessly killing goblins in Lumbridge. Some guy walks up to me and says "Need 10 gp for the gate?" I started typing to tell him to gtfo but then realized the golden crown in the chat box. It was Mat K. I confided in him what happened and he talked me through it for hours. 
---
Anway long story short Mat got married to me 3 days later and we've been happy every day since.
---
LOvely chaps.
---
Is there a general set of levels that's more at risk, or is it just a total free for all?
---
I'm level 120 and am wondering if that would prevent some from attempting to PK.
---
It already is impleneted and it does nothing since it costs $0.003 to solve it
---

This is the first time I've really felt it when a jmod left. I didn't really care about the others. He's different though.
---
ok thx
---
It is a step in the entryway to the school. The kids have inside shoes and outside shoes that the have to wear. Their shoe lockers are a little bit out of frame. I think they just forgot some homework or something and just ran into the school in socks real fast.
---
Sad days.
---
I really think it's because he's not paid enough. He loves the game and there's no more promotions for him at Jagex. He probably asked for a raise and got denied so he's going elsewhere.
---
An un-polled decision. Please come back
---
Not true. The two skilling hotspots in F2P which are Draynor Village and Barbarian Village River, rarely have bots.
---
Bots are only an issue for mining spots in f2p.

POH would be for higher levels who  probably wouldnt wanna spend the time on that anyways unless they were an ironman. There are 3 Chaos Temples that I know of in the game. 2 in the wilderness and 1 in Asgarnia. All 3 would be available to use. It would all depend on the risk you would want to take.
---
Doubt it'd be a story, the guy's skin is too light
---
Part of me hopes he got picked up by Blizzard, because I never played WoW and am giving Classic a try
---
What, with all their recent lay-offs?
---
Become a magic pure and go all out wizard mode. Looks and everything
---
This should of been a separate post, not buried at the bottom of our weekly update! 
---
Best of luck, Mat!
---
That's a classy leaving statement.  He will be missed.
---
Agility already is an extremely tedious skill to train. This is in P2P with access to highlevel courses. F2P will only have access to low-level courses, making the process a dozen times more tedious.
---
There is not even a good reason to make it a F2P skill. Pretty much the only reason I hear is because it would help them with their run energy. To me, it just seems that it would be far better for Jagex to just rebalance run energy in general.    
---
After all, they want to retain new players right? New players do not know that Agility gives the benefit of faster-replenishing run energy. Let alone be bothered to train it. If they do train it they'll probably want to quit faster...
---
Couldn’t handle the shit pay anymore
---
I'd put trimmed music as S tier, means you've all all the track + holiday music + achievement cape. That's definitely on par with stuff like runecrafting and champion's cape imo.
---
I hate things I have to charge BP being the only exception
---
no
---
No deal. D pick is 6m now. Used to be good enough profit at half that.
---
For all you know they've been rigging the numbers the whole time
---
There's no check to know what they were showing us is real.
---
However, if you're really that paranoid that an online game is lieing to it's community about polls by the community that are used to update the game then... I'm going to say your problem isn't with osrs but something bigger. 
---
Like thats some next level paranoia dude
---
Strange choice. I'd go see Nieve.
---
I either run down 20 wilderness levels spamming "lol no teleblock" or die and say "lol get fucked no loot for you" then I drop like 300k on the ground :(
---
Or just require an agility level? Why does everything have to require a diary?
---
Reddit really thinks an automated essentially spam message is considered helpful to someone in crisis LMAOOOOO
---
But Reach shared it around.
---
There's other more afk things with way better xp and money rates
---
Everyone knows all that and they are still excited. Everyone who thinks classic is going to fail also seems to think people excited for the game are delusional about how it was. People know exactly how it was dude. Some people value different things than you in the game. Everyone knows the gear is going to be difficult to get. Everyone knows the pvp grind is insane. Everyone knows the mechanics are prehistoric. Everyone knows the leveling process takes forever. Everyone knows it's hard to get 40 people together every week. Everyone knows class roles were limited. Everyone knows there's limited content if the game isn't updated.
---
I don't know why you think you're bringing people this revelation but you aren't. People know all this shit and they're still hyped for it. Why not shut the fuck up and let them enjoy things?
---
MANDAMANDAMANDAMANDAMANDA SHOWWWW
---
Thank you for your feedback. I just felt this was a way of creating more into the game with out really hurting the overall prices of things. Pros- more WoZ    grape $ increase    Wine price increase  Cons- WoZ $ Decrease
---
Yes Wines of Zammy may take a hit. But im sure wines and grapes would replace the price gap.
---
With Nests and brews we had nothing to offset the price difference
---
That would be entirely too easy
---
Rip
---
Exactly. It should be hurting pures. 
---
Pures are abusing this mechanic to get the best of every world. Low risk, high power, low level. They are by and large the most popular pk account and people hate them because they risk nothing.
---
So you give them a def requirement. Their options are basically leather chaps and vamb. Their power goes way down (again range was the only style to be able to have insane dps at low level) and people stop playing pures and have to play an account that has some form of risk
---
Well obviously they have no choice about where they’re born. I think i know where you’re going with this “they do have a choice what you talking about” from what I’ve seen there’s hardly any opportunities for people living in the ghetto. Obviously there’s some people that are just lazy and want an easy buck but that’s just a human thing tbh. It’s why they go to selling drugs. Everyone wants it and it’s eaaaaasy money.
---
Rev caves or bh world edge most likely
---
Even if it is the best method nobody uses it because it is aids.
---
hydras claw isnt at the right price b/c nobody sells it on the g.e so the price isn't updated
---
what was the design philosophy that made classic wow a success?
---
biggest thing people say to me about classic is they miss the sense of community. So why is it classic wow instead of a retail version with no dungeon finder/cross realm. 
---
Some say class fantasy, but what is class fantasy? Is it animations, is it quests? Gear? all of the above? Were legion order halls a good fulfillment of class fantasy? (dreamgrove ftw)
---
Was it the grind? If it was the grind why is it different from the AP/forge grind?
---
we're going to get a polished version of classic so we probably won't have the same bugs or the dumb flight paths but the classic community is so purist I don't see any changes being made to the game as there was a bit of a fit over blizzard fixing what was clearly bugs and nonsensical things from them.
---
 🦀 🦀 🦀 Mod Matt K is leaving without a poll  🦀 🦀 🦀
---
Ya I've never really been a fan of the guy personally he always was kind of off putting to me for some really odd reason. He looks like he would have a very musty odor that would fill the room whenever you walked in.
---
Also, with bulwark's dmg reduction not applicable in PvP, is it just used for its defensive stats?
---
Can f2p access those spots
---
It was complex for you apparently because you can’t have an opinionated conversation without feeling offended in some way.
---
Because no one trades the claw so since it's rarely traded the claws price hasn't changed. They usually just make the Lance and sell it.
---
Can I have your spare set of heads? I'm over 1k kc dry. Just want that T H I C C slayer helmet recolour.
---
They have zero requirements aside from raw stats. They're already pretty decent given that consideration.
---
Get rigour!!
---
Oxford Comma: 
---
*a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, before ‘and’ or ‘or’ (e.g. an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect ).*
---
A hall of fame for mods would be a nice idea
---
That isn't skill. You can't flick prayers better than someone. You can't kill a fire giant better than anyone (can kill it faster if you have higher level but once again that comes to time). Compare it to a shooter, you can out class people based on skill.
---
Grats!
---
oh come on, respawning would be like top1 most interesting mechanic
---
Oh yeah I totally trust the dudes that barely make a living wage to control the companies direction
---
The claw isnt 47m, its that price in ge because no one really buys and sells them. They're more like 72m
---
He's taking about god spells you Muppet
---
id pay 11$ for that
---
First time this meme format has actually made me lol
---
I think theres just a huge sample size, most mains will have a d defender
---
Imagine consciously turning off the rude word filter then reporting someone for saying rude words.
---
Lol doesn’t even make sense skill on 1 game isn’t skill but on a shooter yeah it’s skill 😂?
---
Pray flicking is based on skill. Smh 🤦‍♂️, I’d like to see you do 6 jads and then tell me pray flicking isn’t based on skill. PvP then, no skill in that either? Can’t outclass someone there?
---
How should I go about finding a decent team to run BA? I've never done it so still need to learn the ropes. My friends have no interest in doing BA
---
Great man, and his impact to the game we all love will always be felt. Thank you Mod Mat K, you will be missed. Best of luck to you in your new role.
---
Very sad to wake up to this, he's been one of the absolute best mods.  He got tons of shit and it never got to him, he just played along with the memes
---
Saw him a couple years ago at a concert and he lost weight but preached a bit, dudes wack
---
An inanimate object that's almost an exact copy of an in-game item? You've got some feelings and thoughts about children that you need to work through and get some help with.
---
I'll wager 100 Schrute Bucks.
---
No, your best chance for f2p is just pvp worlds at ge/lumby
---
Inspect element
---
Thing with Runescape is it's boring as fuck. Most of us play for the nostalgia factor. When I stopped as a kid, I never killed any high level boss. Now, I have 1.3b bank and I can PvE high level content with friends. My young me is happy.
---
If you enjoy grinding out towards a goal, Runescape is for you.
---
Yeah. I love to make shit up to pass one of my favorite games as a toxic wasteland, where edgy teenagers saying racist and homophobe things go unchecked.
---
Instead, I am here, having to pretend to every friend I invite to play that, despite the swastikas, the slurs and all the shit that must come from the bottom of /pol, it's all the exception and not something that you can find if you try to interact with players for more than 30 minutes.
---
fire should be one down at least
---
Frooty Bootys
---
Can't wait for your post about group ironmen sometime down the line
---
Crazy how a moderator leaving can give you a little emotional moment. Just goes to show the value the mods add to the game/experience. 
---
Thank you Mat K for embracing the memes and being a great part of our community.
---
Yes, 5/128 drop rate
---
Sweaty ehp people cried enough, either in wanting the ehp methods to be easier or wanting others to not have access to the methods they used, that jagex for some reason listened and made the change.
---
I think it's bullshit. I don't believe that people stacking arceus books were negatively affecting the integrity of the game.
---
The tinfoil hatter in me thinks they're going to tie something from warding to rune crafting, and by eliminating these other methods and leaving only the tedious shit, they can win a couple votes for people who just want RC easier.
---
Wherever he ends up, I hope they pay a lot for him. He could be credited for saving Jagex with how well OSRS has gone.
---
LOL
---
$12
---
Looks like the subreddit.
---
And in other tweets it’s said all levels of jagex are on the same page. MMK didn’t have the ability to control the companies direction either. He was just vocal about what he was doing. That doesn’t mean all the other mods were against him.
---
that boob edit is fucking awful
---
Yes, years ago there was a statement by the Gower brothers that they would not be adding MTX/P2W to Runescape, and later on it happened. They also didn't poll anything back then so the community had no say in it. 
---
It's different this time around since the community decides what gets added to the game and what doesn't. A majority of the community is against MTX, as am I. If they were added to the game they'd lose a massive part of their playerbase.
---
&gt; and I don't know what game you're playing
---
I'm playing OSRS, and you?
---
&gt; The kind of behaviour shown in this screenshot is an exception
---
A very common exception, in my experience.
---
shes a scumbag
---
change my mind
---
I'm surprised he is the one leaving. Sorry to hear you're leaving Mat. Best of luck to you in your future endeavors!
---
Untrimmed herblore cape on an Ironman?
---
RC on UIM?
---
Take that back, you son of a bitch
---
Pretty sure woox is more skilled at this game than I am.
---
This is pure fearmongering and you're adding nothing of value to the discussion.
---
Mod west constantly needing the community to fix his art and was the dev that pushed the tbow spawn causing the first roll back in osrs history.
---
Go Aztecs!
---
by "publicly discussed" you mean "constantly rules out" right?
---
Are you brain dead?
---
Do you know what cost means? 
---
He's asking for an approx cost. It doesn't cost 1b. 
---
Ask people to buy shit for you from ge and you can get it done without needing a bigger cashstack.

It would make sense seeing as how him and his team effectively reinvented and reinvigorated RuneScape. Maybe Blizzard wants that for WoW classic.
---
u/ModMatK i always had tremendous respect for how well you handled things publicly, even when people were so rabid toward you. Good luck in whatever is next. Selfishly i hope you return one day
---
I never thought I'd shed a tear over this, but wow, this took me by surprise. I'll honestly miss your interactions in the streams, you sounded quite genuine whenever you answered players.
---
Best of luck in the future!
---
tome of fire and bryophyta's staff, you'll have a 1/15 chance of killing yourself for free
---
Thank you for your response! I think I've determined I'm looking for the most afkable and XP/hour method and I'm okay with sacrificing gp. Barbarian is okay but i fill up so fast
---
More item rolls, more construction exp
---
Uses more food, requires more time commitment (a game can last from 30 to 240 minutes) and it's easier to mess up. A little less firemaking exp
---
Shit, fuck, ass etc isn’t the same as racial slurs
---
There wasn't a lot of backlash, just normal backlash compared to everything else they do.

I love castle wars, It gets even more competitive/strategic when teams talk with voice chats it has great esports potential. The original map is amazing! Wouldnt mind seeing some new maps/rewards tho. More people could participate in tournaments DMM can be to much for people with a busy lifestyle.
---
That's just hipsters these days
---
That's honestly a cool idea
---
yeah, ill be able to play it plenty, (no job life here) I just find it *slightly* misleading. thats all :0

She's nobody and has never done anything noteworthy. Ignore her lol

Haven't changed it back after recruitment drive haha lol

Well I like it sooooooo idk what you want me to do lol

He's got all the knowledge they need to help them spin up Vanilla and keep it running well.

trying too hard

Thanks brother, the grind is strong! I want to get rc to 77 so i can take a break from it for a while. But it’s so damn slow lol.

&gt;Have a laugh mate, it's ok.

&gt; The unknown code is only a rumor too

The free seeds you’re talking about from the farming contracts right?

hahaha it all started as a joke lol. I think im going to consider it.
---
How long does Emily have?
---
I wish I got this...

Also be warned that you’ll need an extra 6 levels (or however many mem skills there are?) in a skill after you reach 500 because the 500 is counting the all the level 1 member skills

Honestly I can't imagine it would be that difficult to fix either. If Graardor hasn't been hit in say, 2 minutes, his health and stats resets and the flag that says ironmen can't get drops is also reset.
---
Lmfao classic cheat client user
---
that would turn into people spamming hate speech at 10 year olds playing the game for the first time. horrible idea
---
Fake Runelite clients have built in screenshotters that screenshots every click of the mouse. Even if he had a pin, they would know it.
---
How hard could it be to make the defensive stats reset?
---
We love you MatK &lt;3
---
high quality
---
Ok thanks that does make sense.
---
Last question, I'm not a skiller by any means but blast furnace is kinda new (I think) as in the last few years prior to blast furnace the xp smithing gold at a furnace would have been half? so how was is deemed acceptable to basically double the max XP/hr for that skill?
---
When his IQ is lower than his runecrafting level.
---
Both are legit. runelite.net is RuneLite's website but the source code is hosted on GitHub.
---
How is using runelite cheating?
---
But everyone has to hop worlds to find a free one, normal and ironman alike. Why give ironmen an advantage by giving them a whole separate instance?
---
Do you understand how supply and demand works? The rings (and difficulty of the bosses) are what dictate the gp/hour. The rings have had plenty of time to settle, they are old. If the wildy bosses really weren't worth doing at all then the rings would go up. There is nothing wrong with letting the market dictate how much something is worth, or how worthwhile something is to kill.
---
🦀Emily isn't safe🦀
---
In all seriousness, it's sad to see him go. Hopefully it's a long time before we lose another one of our original JMods
---
Untrimmed hp is pretty legit too, just not to the extent of slayer, or even close to that
---
Tbh i don't remember much about overwatch, so I can't really argue much there, but a popular game is league of legends and the dragons are rng and while ocean drake is fucking dreadful earth and inferno are random objectives that you can play around and have to adapt your gameplan to, even ocean can be used as a decoy to put pressure in other areas, and being 'able to move a mouse around (with precision) and click fast' describes pretty much all pc games, theirs also the added knowledge of combos, gear set ups, micro-mechanics, tick manipulation, that would also relate to games like overwatch where you have to learn each heros dmg, cooldown, strengths and weaknesses, combos/mechanics, you could make the arguement that overwatch is more skill based then osrs which i could probably agree with but the same arguement could be made that csgo is more skill based then overwatch, neither arguements would be able to deny theres a degree of skill needed, mechanical or macro skill or both
---
I miss a fair chunk of it, but it was starting to get a little too close to the EoC/modern RS3 that I didn't like.
---
I liked the gameplay a lot, and even the rewards a little, but it'd need a change if it were to come to OSRS.
---
I, for one, thought the free unlimited runes were a little bit OP. Then again, mind runes are cheap now anyways. It was also really easy to cheat by running through the crowd constantly.
---
So theres like a osrs reddit artist team you can call to assemble? Neat.
---
I'd always heard that they went after RuneLite because they thought it was behind the ModJed hacks. Which is why once RL showed jamflex the code they backed off.
---
Rofl @ threatening physical violence over the internet because someone called you an idiot. You must be a real big man.
---
I've always wondered. At what point is a fighter torso no longer worth getting? I'm... asking for a 103 *btw* that rocks rune body and dragon legs friend. This *friend* doesn't enjoy BA.
---
Good to see it, i started well myself. I remember having 5 uniques in the first 13 chests. Hope the good luck continues for you
---
I like to think the logical explanation for monsters dropping random shit like bank notes is that lost adventurers came in with that stuff
---
There is a shortcut. I believe it's called 'games necklace' and it teleports you close to barbarian fly fishing.
---
If you find ironman mode too hard because you have to hop worlds to find a free world, much like every other account, perhaps try a normal account, join a clan and team up so you can crash whoever
---
how
---
This shit is dumb as hell Jesus.
---
Really? My ranged has always lagged behind my melees because it's quite a bit slower. Though melee is training three different skills as opposed to one. 
---
It does kind of suck that the skills take longer, but that's the game. This game is built around the grinds and enjoying the journey. I've been playing for a year now, and while I haven't been focusing on combat level, I'm only 112. My attack is 88, str is 94, def is 84, hp is 91. With the way the experience works, that means that I'm not even halfway towards having max combat stats. The math works out that getting a skill up 7 levels means that you need to double your total experience in that skill. Level 92 is halfway to 99, level 85 is only one quarter, level 78 is one eighth! 
---
I'm not trying to scare you off anything here, just trying to help you get into the mindset that helps people enjoy this game. Getting a lot of levels in the early game is great fun, but you'll have to wait longer and longer between those level ups. I'm lucky if I get 1 level a day now and I play a lot.
---
I recommend that all new players set some short, medium and long term goals to focus on. For me, short term is what I can get done today or this week, medium is this month, long term is 3-6 months. A great medium term goal for you would be earning that 4m to get a bond, while a long term goal is getting your barrows gloves (which take a crapload of skills and questing).
---
I remember being temp muted back in the day for quoting South Park, lol. I'll bet back in the day you coulda gotten permed for just about anything the average rev pker says these days, haha. Try tweeting Mod Ash directly, he's always responded to my tweets (usually within an hour, too)
---
Nothing sorry
---
Lol dude same. I usually have entity hider on as well for that ultimate immersion factor.
---
The entire point is that i want to turn OFF the ability to do so. I don’t want to move any of the prayers, i just want to be able to flick properly.
---
Although I often give the team a hard time in my posts, I wish Mod Mat K the best. He was a shining example of what a Administrator should be.
---
I loved castlewars. Loved being the keyword here. Because it actually use to be fun back in the day. It was my favorite thing to do despite having no useful rewards.
---
From an overall minigame standpoint, it been ruined by maxed barragers as no one can actually capture a flag anymore. Not your average player at least. Its honestly not fun when you constantly get barraged and piled by rangers and I think thats why its so inactive now
---
I don’t personally care about esports but I do think it could be a great competitive game. But something needs to be done to balance things out otherwise you will only have maxed players competing. With all the new gears being introduced, high level players are able to hit insanely high which os fine against npcs but against players you could take out a mid level player in just 2 hits. I think this is one of the biggest problems with the entire pvp meta. With BIS gear you can easily hit 50s yet our hit points are still capped at 99. Maybe one of the options is to make castlewars equipment used inside the minigame.
---
Yay
---
Sharing information about quests and Skilling isn't the same as using software to make you mechanically better at the game
---
One of us
---
Can't move prayers around in the normal client. Some features of runelite are definitely good for QoL but moving prayers is not one of them lmfao.
---
swimming is not hard.
---
low profit.. 1.7m gp/h aint bad tbh
---
Good for going for pet, otherwise bad idea
---
Yes
---
Pretty sure library ehp is 85k/hr which ks definitely above lavas
---
Not a chance, I'd support further nerfs, not buffs.
---
Fighter torso can be useful for all levels especially for slayer, I suppose if you had a bcp on your ironman you may as well just use that, but for normal accounts a fighter torso is always a viable body to use if you cant afford bcp etc :)
---
Oh that’s a nice idea...
---
Dude, it's a shoe.  You're the only one who finds a picture of a child's shoe creepy.
---
The problem with the high level community is that they feel the need to  "haze" anyone trying to level bad skills.  They went through it, so should you.  Any new content can't be best XP/hr, except when it's end game PVM where you get over the top amounts of money and can afford to throw money at skills.
---
At the end of the day I'm in no rush to level up, but it's silly to stop all new skilling content because 3 tick Barb fishing has always been best.
---
Genius
---
Considering GP is so prevalent these days just use the RC runner discord and hire a few lava runners. With raids 1&amp;2 being such good money makers 99 RC really isnt that bad, even with the recent zmi nerf.
---
If you weren't retarded you'd listen to what I'm saying instead of mindlessly downvoting and crying that I'm telling you that you're shit at the game for needing to even move prayers.. Turn of reordering prayers in your settings, viola.
---
First add some anti flee shampoo so we can give him a good scrub first
---
As long as you dont kill the healers as far as i know they shouldn't spawn more
---
We fish at the fishing guild for the camaraderie, fishing guild has the best people at it. 370 Fishing at the guild is the best
---
if you want high xp/h in RC your choice is lava runes, where you can get 70k+ xp/h and no profit
---
want profit, then 2x cosmics, natures, astrals or wrath runes is your option.. or if you want a balance of xp and profit, afk blood runes
---
because the majority of the playerbase actively hates the game and just uses it to supplement the lack of success and productivity they have in real life. therefore anything that gets in the way of fast afk ez xp gains is automatically awful and gatekeeping and should be destroyed in the name of QoL™
---
Players have manage to do 200m rune crafting off nature runes. Which is around 20k xp an hour. 
---
Lavas are about 50k xp an hour but more click intensive. Just because it’s one of the best xp rates in the game doesn’t mean everyone is doing it. 
---
It’s all about conveniency while training. Most players who do zmi aren’t paying runners because they can’t afford it or don’t find it necessary when they can just grind it them selves. 
---
You’re just wanting a more convenient way to train with having to put in the same amount of work others have.
---
They've said that a lot of these accounts aren't actually bots, just actual players farming gold, but they can't ban those players until they actually sell their gold because they're technically not breaking any rules.
---
The problem is though that it only takes a fraction of willing players to make MTX worth it. Iirc end of 2017 report stated that RS3 was still generating more money than OSRS did thanks to MTX despite RS3 having 2-4x fewer online players than OSRS.

what a cunt. Id be pissed if my husband messed with my non-ironman acc, let alone an ironman one.
---
Double nats is 1.1m/hr and requires 91 rc. Seems fair. There should be high profit/low exp/high requirement methods for all skills.
---
GE or farming guild if you want to maintain flips or contracts during your buyable grind. otherwise im a basic bitch and used crafting guild.

Have some class

Also make a high level lectern so we don’t have to have two studies like we had multiple portal rooms.

Dang small world. Did you go for 275?

Thanks mister K. You were always the one brought the bad news and the players crucified you for it, but you were always one of the best. Good luck man, I will miss you on the streams, especially your stories.
---
Remember when they added that duck unpolled? The community treated that duck worse than they did the entire dock and boat in draynor.
---
Having it competitive with fixed team size should help
---
Its fine as it is. Makes 99 rc more of an achievement compared to other skills, which is good. Don't want all skills to be similar.
---
It's not too late, it's just confusing/difficult to get into and get the hang of. Most of us started long ago when we had nothing better to do and long hours to figure the game out
---
This guy needed one more bone for level 70 prayer, so he asked for someone in the clan chat to bring him one. Someone brought him one, but the bone that he was brought, [Superior dragon bones](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Superior_dragon_bones), requires level 70 prayer to use; thus, it is useless to the guy with only 69 prayer :(
---
*FAKE* runescape players dont have girlfriends  
---
  ^a ^n ^d  
---
*GAY* he bought his "gf" for 10k on w302
---
My rc level is only 65. I don't think they should buff exp rates because it devalues the achievement for others and for me when I decide to one day get it up. That said I think they should add more exciting or less brain dead ways to train the skill
---
Lol @ this post
---
Ah okay thank you
---
1.49 per item? Okay bill gates.
---
F2P players just use f2p to avoid having to train agility
---
I thought they made lovakenjj more orange? Still not this ultimate of a flex
---
Gz on headband for the clue step.
---
this is not needed, just turn trade options off
---
but you have double cosmics at 59 rc
---
Slayermusic has some very good quest guides. (Avoid using Soups guides. Unless you wanna spend extra time forgetting items.)
---
20k?! Id steal her with my zammy kiteshield.
---
I feel like the point of my post is being missed here. Lavas are at a very strange balance point being low lvl rc req with high lvls in other skills to be efficient, and while being the highest exp rate for rc, 70k/hr is awfully low for being that click intensive.
---
See that sounds like a no brainer. But if you could afk 270k mining xp in a week I think I’d take the mining over hunter when I think about how long it takes to get 270k mining at mlm (6 hours at 97 mining)
---
When OSRS came out, the entire reason was because many players quit due to changes. So on release it was promised to be a community driven game. ALL changes polled. This was so we could prevent the game from turning into something we don't want. They said all changes, would always be polled. If they start doing that less and less, then the original idea and promise of this games release is broken.
---
How is using the normal client being elitist? Pretty sure the only elitists here are the nerds like you who cream over efficiency and can't stand to play the game as it should be played lmfao..
---
T H I C C 😍😍🤤🤤
---
arceuus library was 75k+ xp/hr with no pure essence needed
---
but regardless, just don't train the skill. you can just completely ignore it past the level 50 needed for quest requirements. there is no non-rc content that you can't do without rc
---
Huh.. we have nesrly the exact same pc, from the looks of it. My gpu is just mounted virtically. What cpu is in there?
---
I’m not aware of any guides off the top of my head. You can had me in game at Wo1v3r. I can answer any and most questions you have.
---
Thanks man, it has sentimental value to me. I had a stroke when me and my friend was going to GWD and thats what I said :P
---
Just makes users bring their own runes, simple answer to that if it were ever to come back (Not that I see it happening)
---
Thing is, both players have the same chances to do the same tactics. It isn't one-sided
---
Well if he used mith darts and an ava it wouldnt be much more expensive at 17 gp per dart, and would be much better xp per hour. Surely picking white berries for 1 hour and making the switch is a worthy investment of time.
---
Mmm, I'm not sure if people are just really big fans of th4 client or if my buddy bought a brand new Mac Book that somehow had a RS Keylogger on it 😅 he legit just got it the night before. I just asked him the link he used and he verified the official runelite link. 
---
We've both been around RS since the mid 2000s and and have seen it all as far as scams and phishing attempts. He swears the only thing he downloaded was Runelite.
---
Seems like quite the coincidence. But then again it seems like alot of you use it with no problems.. just seems weird man.

yea, I also started as a HC, but lost it in the first 5 minutes when I had to regain my HP after pickpocketing man in lumby castle :D
---
Shut up, It’s like 1b gp to get 99 with runners. A skill shouldn’t cost 1bill to get it to 99 when 99 does literally nothing besides give you a cape.
---
Just watch b0aty, he usually restarts his progress every 6 months or so.
---
It's pretty easy to safespot with crystal bow too. but also yeah the best method is just to let him pull you repeatedly. you get like 1 tick between pulls, you either get an autoretaliate attack off, or you get to eat one food or potion. sometimes you'll have to just keep eating and won't get many hits off which might be the rng you're referring to, but after a little bit you should get the rhythm down.

Sad to see him leave on his birthday ):

Name him Sir Mat Kay.

Sir Kay is an npc in King Arthur's Court. His brother Mat couldn't cut it with the Knights of Sir Arthur so he joined the white knights. Boom lore.
---
Dude i had rates of 33k xp/h average (all time included) at lvl 70 rc on an iron lvl3 skiller (if you wonder why that's relevant it's because i could not just buy stams and i could not range imps that ran too far away from the traps (btw the time for imp box hunting part is included in the xp/h aswell) so i didnt have any energy pots or stams and had worse imps/h than normal accounts.)
---
If i had 99 rc i would get rates of 46k rc xp/h in average. So you are way off lmao.
---
Just checked the ge site and it’s called “ magic shortbow imbue” goes for around 27k.
---
Do we really think he would move overseas to work on WoW
---
Poor, hahah SIKE nice
---
I get what you're saying, but I think ether the experience rates aren't out of line (stacking books), or the cost is so much that it isn't necessarily an issue (ZMI with runners).
---
I don't think the fact that ZMI runners were a thing at one point takes away from the RC cape as an achievement.
---
started them a while ago yes, but i haven't had rangers
---
I miss the days when Mod Mat K would stream OSRS on Twitch from his living room back in the early days x
---
&gt;  could’ve it had happened? Possibly.

Why would him exploiting a bug in the game possibly cause another employee to lose their job as well? That doesn't really make sense.

Mate go eat a Snickers or something.
---
Got a question tho, for the gmaul pure what is the 82 mage and 31 prayer for
---
untrimmed is nooby because it shows you only have 1 99

literally any trimmed cape is better than untrimmed

---
&gt;  It just seems like the vocal majority on this site is more happy when a update is different to how it was polled rather than getting the update how it was polled. 
---
The vocal majority is happy for the game becoming easier/less grindy while operating under the **appearance** that it isn't. If they poll a 40k/hr xp rate method that passes for runecrafting, but it accidentally becomes 60 or 80k xp/hr or more, I'd say the vast majority of people would readily take advantage of it, despite it not being the polled result.
---
Also I'd presume that there exist a subsection of the vocal majority that are perfectly happy for the game to be easier regardless of appearances yet only become vocal when they perceive the game becoming harder. 
---
Either way, this is the internet, the same vocal group of people who cheer for one thing are not necessarily the same vocal group of people that will cheer for the opposite. This sub has 356k people. I don't really get the confusion?
---
“Buying gf”
---
Of course he's gonna say that knowing the players stance toward MTX, but if the higher ups want MTX there's not much he can do. MatK and Ash being the remaining og osrs team had the most influence regarding the issue.

Bank your shit, run out and try it. Worst case they kill you with nothing on. Best case you get candy.

Does this mean no more crack the clue?:(

That's illegal.
---
Upvoting for the bold words.
---
Oh you're right, ya looks like we agree with each other.
---
Lavas is still better RC xp with manipulation, and it's only better in terms of EHP and that rate doesn't kick in until 99 rc. And that's assuming you running both perfectly. This is nothing more than a very stupid vocal minority who has no fucking clue what their talking about bitch about methods they'll never use and cry nerf.
---
At least you can be productive in runescape too

I can't figure out how to drag it. I right click and add to canvas, but it's just stuck in my top left corner. How do you move it?

it showed up through twitch rewards dropdown for me, though it's not on the actual twitch prime rewards page yet.

I mean if the conspiracy is true, it’s understandable why she’s a little messed up honestly.

I honestly hope they add MTX so people like you can quit the game then we can all be spared from having to read more posts like this

Yes, that is the inconsistency in this story.

This comment right here officers
---
Zeah rc really isn't that bad, but it sure is slow. 
---
These stats are a bit outdated, but maybe still relevant: https://imgur.com/a/Op12Z
---
Probably you couldn't go wrong with either prayer or agility. You can only pick one untrimmed cape, so I'd go with whichever skill you like more.
---
Bonds are the definition of pay to win, they are MTX. The only difference is that the gold is technically coming from another player, but the product (membership) is coming from Jagex. 
---
You could say that cosmetic MTX benefits the game though in the same way bonds do. If you buy cosmetic MTX, you're directly supporting the OSRS dev team and Jagex. Same way if you buy bonds you're giving the dev team more revenue, to further support the game.
---
Atleast castle wars would work properly unlike dmm lmao
---
Library ehp is only better when you combine the bonus hunter xp with the  70k/hr for rc at 99. It is slower than lavas for straight RC xp at any level.
---
Poor Mod K, going to be made fun of.
---
Long read with a lot of good ideas. I like the cap at 60 for combat skills and the fact that training and rebuilding are pretty fast. Skilling being a viable way to play this mode is also nice for those that choose this route. Overall most of your ideas seem pretty balanced and I don't think it would take too much time to develop this on Jagex's end. From a viewers stand point it seems fairly simple to follow along with. Really great idea.
---
Sure, 
---
The 82 mage is for ice blitz, fun to do a little rushing. You can stack ice blitz and gmaul spec for 4 hits at a time and stack people out occasionally 
---
The 31 prayer is for item protection prayer if your risking something and more importantly ultimate strength. +15% strength and Addis’s fee max hits
---
😂😂😂🤙🤙🤙 It’s optional. So don’t worry 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
---
I think there would be problems on mobile. Much less screen real estate there, and smaller buttons are harder to hit (Try using a POH jewelry box on mobile)
---
Join us Matt k....
---
lmao i would burn her car, her clothes, all her stuff basically, and then dump her. (and i would still be the one that lost most probably)
---
Right, but some skills have fewer options than others, and runecrafting has 0 good options pre-77 to train it.  WC and mining are both cancer skills as well, but MLM and scullicip help alleviate it, alongside intense clicking methods to power through the early levels.  
---
RC has the activity level of a production skill without the rates, or variety.
---
But Crack the Clue 3... You will be missed Mat K, the CTC community loved going up against your mad genius levels of thinking.
---
Dude I’ll miss you and the memes surrounding you.
---
He tried so hard!
---
No, but if I had to guess I would say he will be replaced by Mod John C. Note this is not confirmed. My speculation goes as follows:
---
John moved to the mobile development team for OSRS mobile. Seeing as how that was a huge success and the app is pretty much complete at this point, I expect John to put a bid in for the senior product manager. To my knowledge there is not a junior product manager, and John has been with the team since January 2014, so he knows the role pretty well. He has a proven track record of success and has leadership experience. If I was the hiring manager, I know where I would bet my chips. 
---
There is also a possibility of pulling someone from the RS3 team, but I feel as though it would be a mistake. OSRS and RS3 are two completely different games at this point. Unless that person is a very active OSRS player who has been waiting for the right opportunity, I don't think it would be in the teams best interest to hire a RS3 manager.
---
&gt; But something needs to be done to balance things out otherwise you will only have maxed players competing.
---
This isn't a bad thing clearly. Nothing needs to be done lol.
---
The man is a elitist nerd who constantly cries and spreads false info. He's best downvoted and ignored.
---
I'd reckon it'd take at least 1-2 clues to complete it all.
---
I've always used more prayer gear in fight caves, even if it we're just monk robes. But depends on your def lvl I guesss

I think one month from the time you redeem it, but id like to know for sure as well.

Because the size of the spell button isn’t the issue

Thank you! :)
---
finally someone that agrees with me that legion sucked ass
---
Lol nice
---
Thanks!
---
You sure can! It just de-spawns the brother.
---
one thing people haven't been mentioning is that the library method relied heavily on the use of 3rd party clients to tell you where the books were located without having to search for them
---
Given that, as well as the fact that the activity itself doesn't really have anything to do with runecrafting, I definitely think it should have been nerfed although I do think Jagex should introduce other methods of training the skill for variety's sake
---
Completing the collection log is something I see as akin to 200m xp in each skill. It's a possible, but ridiculous endgame challenge
---
That's like saying "thoughts and prayers" for school shootings in the US.

99 fletching requires a far greater amount of time. How many people you know use darts to get to 99?  Seriously, that shit would be expensive to do in 4 hours anyway... I've been making darts on my ironman and 50-52 smithing was like 35-45 fletching but it was a huge loss of monetary value.
---
"I am one of you now"

😭
---
Good luck /u/ModMatK on whatever comes next! You were heavily memed but were like a father figure for the community. You made corny jokes on streams, rolled with the punches, and told long stories that even the best stream host could not stop. Most importantly though you had the best interest in the OSRS community and longevity of the game in mind at all times. Whoever takes the spot you've left has some big shoes to fill, and hopefully they'll do it with socks as fancy as yours.
---
Who refers to Kieren as Mod K?
---
Right, and here we are delivering a flat nerf to a method that's mostly dead because thieving xp is pretty worthless outside of the EHP/200m crowd. Its literally only a problem (not really but you could say so) to the post 99 crowd, like library and it's being nerfed. Meanwhile other updates have pushed methods up and made them low effort yet there is no cry? This seems more like people just making up bs.
---

I really don't see how [this](https://twitter.com/JagexGee/status/1128709908596183041) even remotely resembles an[ RS3 asset](https://runescape.wiki/images/thumb/2/29/Lady_Meilyr.png/320px-Lady_Meilyr.png?9b9ae).  
---
If anything, it reminds me of RS2's 2008-2011ish timeline, which I'm completely fine with.

I would strongly suggest getting tormented before suffering. I'd even be tempted to get imbued heart before suffering tbh.

Getting every piece of third age would put you somewhere around half a million clues lol goodluck doing that

Yea this used to be my 1 def pure so it had 99 range on it before getting def
---
zammy kite pff I'd give her the d-boots off my feet.
---
I agree but considering how far along the new models are I doubt they would at this point. I know they changed Ranis Drakan's model previously for Taste of Hope without polling, but that still resembled his older model albeit with a few more details, whereas the new elf models stand out completely compared to the player/humans.

Yeah like what? This is not professional. It's funny though.
---
That's out of date. Now, 80% of the subscribers are OSRS players, 2/3 of their revenue comes from subscriptions, 1/3 comes from MTX, likely meaning ~70% of their revenue comes from OSRS.
---
Jagex really just needs to adopt RuneLite as the official client.  It would give them more control on the most popular 3rd party client, would allow community contributions, and overall just give new players a better experience.
---
Untrimmed agility cape + dark blue graceful looks really nice imo.

Keep in mind OSRS has extremely popular MTX also through bonds, not that this is me saying that there wouldn't be further monetization. There's a reason you can get a month of membership in OSRS in 2-8 hours of playtime depending on your skill level and methods available. An absolute steal considering the amount of time the average OSRS players spends playing the game. You can sustain membs off slayer drops alone after a few HOURS out of a month. It's not because people don't want "free" membership, it's because so many bonds are bought and sold for ingame gold.
---
Equip him with good quips. Like dad jokes and stat jokes.  
---
We can also call him Statius, or Data.
---
ughhh
---
The most efficient way of getting 99 fletching is with darts. The fact that less efficient ways of training the skill exist doesn't really change this. You could spend months getting 99 fletching with oak longbows, but ultimately you would get the same cape as someone who burned through darts for 4 hours.
---
Making adamant darts is an extremely common method of fletching training. Any time you see someone trying to buy adamant dart tips at the GE, this is what they're doing.
---
Definitely fake.
---
No way a civilian understands what HCIM is or how to get to a boss.
---
Uhh.. ? Lol ok ?

AYEEEELMAOOOO

YOU RICH RICH BOW BOI
---
You know though, it'd be pretty funny if it was just a joke
---
Imagine being with a company for 14 years and entry pay somewhere else being higher is a probably a big factor as to why he left. Jagex should kind of be embarrassed about what it offers it's employees.
---
Oh shit this is good lol
---
Maybe if they made the client usable and not keep breaking it, people would use it.
---
At least he didn't get rid of the fire cape and void to put salt onto the wound
---
I know smelting gold at the Blast Furnace is one of the highest smithing XP rates in the game, but is the raw amount of XP different than smelting gold at a regular furnace? In other words, if I'm not worried about time, would I get the same training done at Edgeville for free?
---
Bulwark + karil top and bottom and pray augury and mage
---
No one will be able to kill you before you finish your bones
---
You're absolutely right, apparently you don't have knowledge of it yourself yet here you are trying to tell me it is the best exp/hr lol.  Lava runes are 75k exp/hr which is faster than this method.
---
This method was definitely polled into the game.  The teak update was hidden under farming update, whereas this method was polled saying it would give exp.  The bulwark was polled but did not suggest improvement in exp/hr, yet has by far the best exp/hr and nothing has been done.  It's also considerably faster than any other exp/hr.
---
Vigorra chainmace was polled but not with the insane exp rates it offers, being best exp/hr for all accounts (outside of the bulwark method).  Zeah content was polled suggesting exp, whereas those other updates were not polled with exp in mind AT ALL.  That's the difference.
---
Regardless the way they've handled this is awful, they didn't even give a grace period to the people who did use the method to cash in on the exp they got through their hard work using game mechanics that have been in the game for years.
---
Somehow still wrong

Ya exactly most people have optimal pking builds these days. It's hard for new people to  compete. I myself have a max main, a nearly maxed 75att pure and access to a maxed 60att 75 def pure. Currently working on a 50att 70str bh pure with 85 mage for tb/snare/zammy flames with 80ish range. 
---
I completely agree the meta for dmm being 99 everything is completely ludicrous even with the increased xp rates when you only have a week to obtain these stats. I still can't understand how people can drop everything for a week and focus solely on dmm. 
---
Whenever I watch dmm seasonals it seems like most people are less afraid to venture out and pk at your purposed caps. There's enough ko potential at these levels. People aren't afraid of dying losing big items and having to rebuild. I feel like jagex thinks people only enjoy high end gear/weapon fights. There's plenty of fun that can come for lower end pking especially when everyone is on a similar playing field because of how attainable these levels/gear are.

10% is too much it's supposed to be 44k agil/174k theiving. Please actually look into the underwater rates.
---
Sorry to get on my high horse but I'm going to have to let y'all know back in the day I was actually the first one to make a post on this sub about the existance of the NPC emily, along with figuring out you could use coins on her which she would just blatantly accept with a ''thank you!''

~3k in PC + Peripherals for OSRS PepeLaugh
---
I've been playing rs3 for years and literally all I've ever seen of Shauny is "I'll pass this on" and then when nothing happens and the community gets angry mod Shauny passes it on again. Rs3 mods are complete trash
---
Not consistency rates were repolled as part of the improvements to be around 44k/174k xp/hr. 10% nerf is too much. If anything it should be left alone.
---
why are you farming on your zerker? .-.  
---
Also i have level 24 farming on my main (100% lamps) with almost 1750 total level. Any tips for becoming motivated to actually level that skill since you seem to be pretty good at it? What are a few easy patches to start with so I can slowly start leveling my farming.
---
Fighter torso, obsidian legs, slayer helm, whip (abby dagger or bludgeon for strength training), dragon boots, dragon defender, amulet of torture, ferocious gloves, berserker ring (i)
---
D'hide, magic shortbow (I), slayer helm (i), barrows gloves, ranger boots, necklace of anguish, archer ring (i), Ava Assembler, 
---
Magic depends on task a lot. Bursting tasks you want to maximize magic damage bonus and prayer.  Anything with level 1 magic and no magic defense magic bonus means very little so, for something like Kraken, you want to maximize defense rather than attack bonus. For other stuff just use mystic, iban's blast, seer's ring, and whatever else magic attack gear.

You can youll just have to risk more

I recognize the strat, you're welcome for the guide ;)

Lmfao this made me laugh
---
People say that shit to me all the time too. They are just being obnoxious
---
"Oh you have XYZ, must be nice to have mommy's credit card."
---
Theres good and bad. 
---
Bad: cant kill someone without risking 2m. 
---
Good: need 2m risk to kill someone so u pk 2m more. 
---
What will happen is noobs get less kills so they dont make as much money so they pk less which is bad.
---
I’ve only had this happen to me once. It should open when you open the chest, unless it spawned at one of the doors on your way to the chest. In my experience in that case it did not.
---
Sleep tight, little goblin prince
---
It’s a slight nerf won’t make a difference if it’s going to be a pures +1 or a slight elevated risk to main pking but if the clamp turns out to be accessible easily don’t you think everyone will just use still ?
---
Awesome thanks for your help!!
---
its still some time of walking...
---
Ohh that, nice:)
---
Is it worth it to use a BP and adamant darts when doing barrows runs?  I know it'll speed the trips up, but its also gonna be a lot more expensive than MSB(i) and rune arrows, so I don't know if the time save beats the cost.
---
I propose a F2P goblin boss in his honor, 1/420 key drop chance when you kill a goblin or gamble a goblin mail

Try inferno then come back

I think they should add a certain way to get the old tutorial or skip the tutorial in a criptic way that new players wouldn't figure out, because some people do put in experienced simply because they've played other games.  So new players who don't know anything about the game are just straight up put into the new tutorial
---
😢 good luck mat on your future endeavors
---
Post your suggestion over at r/Runelite. Chances of the Runelite devs seeing it are higher
---
The skill in this game is timing, rythm, click accuracy and speed. There is a lot of skill in this game.
---
Osrs is a click game, rs3 a buttonmash game. They are different. You suggesting this and trying to convince the nay sayers is honestly baffling. In no way shape or form would it ever be added to osrs and you know it.
---
You don’t spend a lot if you only use it for ahrim and the 2 skeletons + bloodworm. I’d say it’s worth it
---
I mean August is just past the midpoint of summer so I don't really know what you're on about here.
---
They could make level tiers, it worked for pc.
---
yeah. there also exist people in the middle, too; i myself bought a handful of spins here or there every payday in rs3 just to see what i'd get. if it was a little bonus exp or a lamp, that would be a nice surprise. a few times i got some tradeadable items worth a few mill and i got a couple of the lucky items (bgs and arma helm). but i definitely wasnt p2w.
---
If it was nerfed right away its fine. Nerfed years after the fact is not fine because then you lost out on something. People dont like losing things.
---
Questions can be used to fear monger. Example: "Is it even okay to have kids anymore because of global warming?"

Lmao this comment made my day
---
This actually made me pretty emotional
---
I mean, the people who are upset about the nerf are actually the best pures. They're upset about not being able to stack msb and 2 gmauls in the same tick with pid, which is what the best pures do. The more moderate pures who aren't nearly as good are for the nerf.
---
Yup it worked. Thanks!
---
Then I'll melee you and use better tactics when it's my turn and win!
---
I'm an iron meme too but I think I'm set on irit seeds. I have over 600 of them lol, I haven't done medium contracts though, only hards
---
Lvl 40 chad
---
\^ This guy knows whats up, but he missed the part where you asked what is best to replace slayer helm with. I wanna say Helm of niez is bis for melee and range, and magic is going to be set piece for whatever gear you're using, honestly if you have magic void its going to be bis for most slayer tasks if you don't have slayer helm (i).
---
I had considered that. I am relatively low level for these activities (80's melee, just about to hit 90 ranged), so I think dhcb is the way to go and I don't think I could effectively afk rune drags. Plus the cost of max melee to make lance worth it sends the price tag way above just a dhcb with the setup I already have (using antidragon shield not ward). I appreciate your perspective though, the lance was definitely tempting as I was trying to sell off the last few items in my bank to hit 115m. If dhcb is underwhelming for my level I may sell it and try lance out. Not sure if lance with a welfare setup would be about the same or not?
---
So people will look at it, laugh and move on with their lives? You should’ve tried that with this post.

1b is nothing nowadays. Only 100 hours at raids 2. And thats discounting new updates where you make serious bank at new bosses.

Sometimes we do. We had team member once make a mistake outside of working hours that resulted in his inability effectively continue his job with us and jeopardized our reputation. He couldn't stay, but we all agreed to sign NDAs on some specifics because it didn't harm anyone or prevent him from doing the same job, just his ability to do the job with us and our clients.

Probably gonna get blasted for this but I have no idea what the story is behind MatK/Emily. I know it's a huge meme but I've never taken the time to look it up. Can someone link me?

What am I meant to be looking at here?
---
There was that post about how they should erect a statue or Mod MatK in the Falador castle courtyard... this should be the examine text.
---
Solid advice/perspective, thanks. Taking advantage of Twitch saves you roughly ~8M assuming you play through bonds. Be sure to be claiming your daily bstaves each day if you have any Varrock diaries completed because this usually goes back to my bond funds but if you're using that free month that's like a decent amount of money you don't have to put back towards bonds. A lot of people tell you to do it with Elite diary but even doing it with medium/hard tier is some effortless income and takes like 1 minute to tele to Varrock square, buy your bstaves, then put them on GE.
---
Thank you, for everything

When I first started back after 5 or so years, I legitimately thought they were pizzas. I was confused why someone was dropping pizzas training agility.
---
Luckily, the friend who got me back into the game informed me that they were in fact not pizzas. I only lost 10 or so, though.
---
contracts are still worth doing for ironmen. just because they arent as op doesnt mean they are dogshit
---
Ok, your opinion on the definition of a word does not make it so. Skill; noun; the ability to do something well. Woox can play RuneScape very well regardless of however many hours he has put in - putting in hours doesn’t make you good. Take you for example, you have have sunk thousands of hours into an education which clearly hasn’t seen itself through childhood.

Oh so mtx is coming and mat got out just in time well than. Were all fucked.
---
That's a matter of opinion, not fact. 
---
OSRS is comprised of core 'fundamentals' that define it as being an Old School version of Runescape. I see those fundamentals as the graphics, the combat system and the leveling difficulty/speed for each stat. Go ask the WoW players why they're so excited for classic right now - it's because classic will offer them grindy, difficult leveling again (something that was lost with each new expansion). 
---
If new methods come out that make a skill's xp gain faster than it was in 2007, this is eroding at one of the fundamentals of the game. That's something worth fighting to preserve. Jagex is really paying attention now which is great, and a trend I hope continues.

Thanks for the suggestion, however, I would like to focus on making this game as successful and great as the one in the link.
---
The whisper in the OSRS window.
---
Nope. It is "when it is ready" last I heard. Usually, they try to do updates at the start of the year, early summer, and end of summer, but SotE doesn't look to be early June like past year's summer updates. They also mentioned that if Warding passed, it would take them several months so it wouldn't make the September like previous years aimed for, so the old schedule may not be relevant for the rest of 2019 past Kebos.
---
But did you get it?
---
Now we know you're trolling
---
I thought just giving it to the other person in the trade screen was how that worked. They give it to you afterwards... right?

That's only partly true. The guy on the front page who lost 12m banked RC xp was a main. Some people just enjoyed the method - funnily enough because they didn't have to actually runecraft.

Lance at rune dragons is around 1.8m/hr, and safespotting wyverns without a dhcb last time I remember was around 500k/hr. I doubt the dhcb can triple the profitability of wyverns

Can anyone explain to me how she's still streaming? Seems like she's been universally hated by the OSRS community for years now. Doesn't seem like it would be profitable or worthwhile for her to be streaming anymore. I would've moved on to something else if I were her.

Absolutely and utterly untrue.

OSRS relies on visual tracking and fine motor skills to click accurately and swiftly. Some people despite putting 100s and thousands of hours will not be as good as the guy I linked( including myself). You actually have no clue whatsoever.

Maybe if jagex that state they want esports continued the jcup which actually has no cash prize there'd be a reason to replace the RoT statue but honestly if it's multi RoT will win every time and if it's singles Front Line will win everytime.

Pretty much yep.

Space bar spamming pkers are certainly included in my category of "noobs", as they are inexperienced in the majority of the game.
---
I mean jagex does ban bots ALOT, its just a human or even a machine cant ban bot accounts as fast as a machine can make them
---
"Who asked for this change Jagex?"
---
Any iron man who cared for the integrity of the game mode. Contracts doubled herb EHP and were stupid broken.
---
That applies to most of the other content you are saying nobody asked to nerf either.
---
It was also buffed since release with the intent of making it actually a viable thing to do.
---
all i can say is ow
---
almost hilarious except living on a prayer is by bon jovi.
---
It's not even a nerf. It's increasing the risk of taking a g maul. No one knows what that price is until they give us more information. If the clamp is say 2m good pkers will gladly take it. What's 2m more risk if you're confident in your abilities. I guess you do have a point that people who aren't as good would be opposed to this because they would be risking more. Since it's typical that most deep wildy brids take a ags/claws with a gmaul those who aren't are confident miss out on substantial KO potential. Again this is all dependent on the price of the clamp so we'll have to wait and see.
---
&gt;For someone who hasn't killed zolrah yet, how does this change the fight if he's dead?

Cant help but wonder what monitor that is? Nice setup btw

I'm pretty sure this is not bannable.

did emily quit RS or soemthing?

I'm pretty sure any macro is bannable, although it's a pretty grey area. I personally wouldn't risk it, although I doubt you'd get caught especially since it's a runelite thing.

Now he too, will make shitty crab rave memes.

Wait the infinite tab doesn't sum up the total bank value anymore?

This no idea why people want to watch somebody tick skill for 3 hours. Pking or PvM I can understand but when I skill I chose the afk method and type comments like this or watch streams of people doing the content I'm forced to level said skill for lol

I'm married so maybe it's a bit different, but if your SO is a jerk to you do you know what you should do? Be a fucking adult. You don't get revenge on a SO, that is extremely immature and if you don't like how you were treated find someone else. Seriously no one could be justified like this, though I know this situation isn't real.
---
Yeah 1b bank for a main nowadays is actually on the welfare line. That’s the sad truth.
---
Once you do herb/con/craft/farm and buy your gear gp doesn’t really matter much however you still have a fat gp income from pet hunting or raiding for fun .ect.
---
This leaves you in a weird place where you have boatloads of gp but it also has no use, so you may as well throw 1b at rc and save some time.
---
Big if true
---
The thing is that pressing a key bound to those key strokes and pressing those 3 keys at the same time is basically the same speed but just more annoying. I just don’t want to get banned on my Ironman as I go for 85 crafting

Why Karils?

Never did Gertrudes cat?
---
Nah, gratz
---
It's funny, but you won't find jmods making those sorts of comments nowadays. You can tell they've obviously got stricter over the years in terms of representing the company publicly.
---
If you need the g maul to kill someone, you probably arent a good pker
---
Private scripts are OP
---
Honestly? I hope so. Of course I want him to stay with Jagex forever, but Blizzard is equally important to me. I grew up on their games just as much as RS, and I have been very concerned about the state of gaming recently. I think classic WoW might be the catalyst that turns things around, and I think former Mod Matt K (fMMK) is the perfect person to go to Classic. I'll elaborate more.
---
Right now, it feels a lot like game devs have lost their way. Mega publishers have to answer to shareholders, and shareholders want to see ever growing quarterly reports. Thus, devs have to release content faster than ever. And the content has to appeal to as large a crowd as possible.
---
So games are becoming less about a unique concept that people enjoy exploring, and more about staying as close as possible to a formula that already works. Look at call of duty. They've released the same game a dozen times. WoW is no different. They've gone from having 9 extremely unique classes full of flavor to having 12 classes that more or less feel like having four unique classes with a few skins each.
---
How did they achieve this? By trying to appeal to as many people as possible AND maintain a subscription model by reducing the complexity of the game. Abilities too complex or with niche use were pruned. Epic gear became easy to get. Then legendaries became easy to get. Now legendaries are given to you. There is no reward whatever for putting in the effort, you get everything by basically logging in and clicking the right buttons in the right order, which basically makes it a prettier version of Cookie Clicker. It's not fun, and it's not bad. It just is. It's basically like Bud Light.
---
Additionally, some game devs at Blizzard (and in general) have become supremely confident they know better than the players. And why shouldn't they think that? They have consistently created the best games in their genre for decades. They have created whole new genres. Blizzard has the best talent in the world, and they know it.
---
Not to point any fingers directly at Jeff Kaplan and J. Allen "You think you do, but you don't" Brack, but some of these devs need to get their heads out of their asses. Which I know might be difficult given the sheer size of their heads, but it needs to happen if they're going to make anymore good games again.
---
I'm sure there are many more problems but watering down games and not listening to players are the two that I see and think classic WoW will help.
---
First, watering down games. Classic WoW was hard. Osrs is hard. Classic was complex as hell (talent trees, spell ranks, 40 man raids that required attunement and special gear, etc). Not everyone likes that, true. But apparently more people liked it than what we have now. Just like OSRS has more players than RS3, I anticipate that Classic WoW will see at least similar numbers as Retail.
---
Which I believe leads into my second problem, devs not listening. J. Allen Brack said in 2013 "you think you do [want to play classic WoW], but you don't." Now, not only is Blizzard releasing classic, but OSRS has held momentum and grown for 6 years. Brack is about to eat his own words. Whereas he could have listened to his players and saved himself some embarrassment (looking at you Kaplan). I think if devs see two successful examples of re-releases of huge popular games, they'll be unafraid of straying from their cookie cutter formulas and experiment with things players want.
---
fMMK has kept OSRS in line with players wishes while doing a pretty bang up job of maintaining the games integrity. I'm hoping some big wigs at Activision Blizzard will bring him in and set him to work on figuring out how to deliver player desires to devs and keep a pulse on the community. I think he will be able to say "look here, you might have created the best games in the world, but I saved Jagex and I'm going to save you and this is how and you will listen because I know what I'm talking about and you don't."
---
Of course, I don't think all of gaming's problems will be solved. But I believe we may find ourself wandering into a new era of gaming where choice is king.
---
The fickle tastes of consumers and the need for choice is something many industries have adapted to. Vlassic once hired a man to create the perfect pickle that would appeal to everyone. That man came back and said "you cannot create the perfect pickle, but you can offer the perfect selection of pickles." and BOOM. Now you can get huge varieties of any consumables. Coke, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Diet Coke, Diet Cherry Coke, and so on.
---
It's time for game devs to give us choices, and I can't think of anyone I'd trust more than fMMK to be deeply involved.
---
Imagine being this bent, over how another person builds their in-game house.
---
Nice to see Matt’s gonna go stream with his lover
---
Jagex's owners force them to pay minimum wage. The only people that work there are people that really REALLY love the game, and I gotta say that's one positive side effect of having a greedy soulless Chinese investment firm that doesn't even understand video games as an owner.
---
It should really be made so that for the 7 day trial you need to finish all f2p quests. At the very least it will raise the bar for entry and force account buyers to pay more and get less value out of their 7 days.
---
Also do something about the plank makers
---
inb4 "They ban them on the daily durrrr" The bots literally have 300+ hours of bot time on them.

That's not really in good jest, that's just edgy

That is silly, if you don't want your information given just use a fake one. I just saw this bot and played it once, I dont gamble in RL or the likes but its all in fun and games and passes time when you get bored. Grow up... is all i have to say.

No. It's Juul.
---
We’re talking about IT people tho... like he’s not stupid enough to just push shit through and be caught that easy...
---
his eyes wouldnt be looking up that much
---
Just got free month of membership from twitch, first time being a member. Anyone have some recommendations on how to make the most of it?
---
I'm with it, 100%
---
May i add that he saw most of us grow from child to man
---
Using it now, thanks!
---
Buying that GF for 5mil and a spade.
---
Ah was playing the vid without sound. Thanks
---
Wow.
---
Gimme all the armpit hair idgaf i'll slay her trimmed or untrinned.
---
Even without agility, taverly teleport gets you back there in like 1 minute 50.
---
Very beta male of you.
---
Wheres the casket?
---
You're a good man, sweedishfish. Thank you.
---
El white knighto
---
Bulwark would make it cancer tho 😂
---
Coal J?
---
10/10 ending
---
Thanks for all your hard work getting OSRS up and running Mat!
---
Under appreciated comment
---
One month from the time you redeem it.
---
There should be a monument to the mods, maybe in the wilderness. I am pretty new to the game but I love it and I know this guy Mod Mat K was a huge part of that. He deserves some kind of celebration from so many years of hard work. Thank you to all the MODS!
---
The Warrior guy never specifies that you need to die to the fourth stage to pass the third. If you leave by ladder you need to do it all again. It'd be fine if the guy told you need to die as well. 
---
Having just barely made it past phase 3 I took the ladder not knowing. It's just straight up bad game design.
---
Naw FairytalesRS will guide us
---
Mod G is a dirty cumdumpster
---
That’s unlucky :[
---
What can he still see? I dont get it
---
Not for me at least. I fucking hated to do raids with shit gear and zulrah with not max mage/range. It took away the fun of speed running.
---
I actually have faith in most the current jmods. I like Kieran, Bruno, and Roq a lot
---
good meme
---
he looks like a frog
---
So long Mod Mat K. Wishing you and Emily the best.
---
Never change tutorial island.
---
Konduit definitely had it :v)
---
How many kree kills do you get pere trip solo?
---
This is Runelites way of prepping us for MTX
---
The OSRS window, referring to the fact that 90% of the screen is taken by the streamers webcam.
---
Lemme tell ya pal,  some of the best memories you will make are being a new player in free-to-play. Your haveing fun, that's all you need for now. Enjoy the adventure.
---
You are most welcome friend :)
---
People in the comments say it's not one sound affect, it's the multiple sound effects from snake flute in Ratcatchers.
---
Yes, and in my eyes that makes them noobs in the context of 95% of the game. Not sure why people are disagreeing that pkers aren't noobs when it comes to lore etc.
---
Because I'm not trolling or flaming?
---
It works the exact same on linux
---
Grow up? Odd advice coming from someone positively reinforcing player-run scaming and rwt. If you can see whats wrong with it you're simply a dunce.
---
I feel like at that point you give up and go to mlm lol
---
We love you!
---
Not sure if troll or srs. I appreciate the read either way hahaha
---
That's what I'm saying - it filters output
---
What's that wallpaper
---
Good luck man, first time is always the toughest but something that helped me was knowing that the level 45 that spawns on wave 3 has the same spawn as jad in wave 62. You can just keep starting over until you get a good spawn. Always prioritize switching prayers over aggroing the healers.
---
Yeah fair enough. Without context it's a poor method to try and evaluate.
---
lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Nice. Keep it up bro.
---
Quest as much as you can
---
Just need 500k rc xp until I get the achievement cape, but then Im at a loss as far as what to grind towards next
---
Pretty boring qa
---
I hope you get banned. 
---
I'm jk...its still 20 minutes. And I dont think runelite does anything really. To change that. So really weird
---
I believe pokemon go can detect them because the gps data is not moving unlike real phones. This is possible to get around.
---
got your back homie
---
This sub is so paranoid every time a Jmod leaves, “jmod left jagex so that means MTX is coming”
---
F indeed 
---
We love you
---
Thanks for the enlightenment friend.
---
how about we ban RoT so 2200 worlds become playable in the wilderness again.
---
Yeah alts aside slayer is currently very well designed, though unfortunately without using alts it's very slow (but that's ok cause it only means more slayer :p)
---
I don't remember this episode...
---
Ask your mom LOL

It may not be efficient, but you play with the game how you want. It's not all about efficiency. :D thought at said, Dharoks axe alone isn't amazing.
---
Were you still splashing and gaining xp, or just being attacked?  After 20 minutes you should stop auto retaliating, but the npc is still aggressive, and you might stay logged in as long as something is attacking you.
---
During the Christmas event I would agro a man to afk collect snowballs for 20 mins. I would often come back a few hours later and still be logged in, not preforming any action, but the man was still attacking me.
---
Ahh I see. Got over 20m farming xp so I guess in the end it doesn't matter
---
you dont get logged out, you just stop auto retaliating. youll sit there for 6 hrs so long as nobody kills whatever you splashed on.
---
Thanks for putting up with this community's shit. We don't always show it but we do appreciate y'all.
---
Almost no kids buy MTX for videogames lol, most of the income for games like Clash Royal is whales that spend thousands of dollars
---
The original was polled at 30k + 110k, with the specific line
---
&gt;The experience rate provided by underwater Thieving is not comparable to the existing top methods. It will serve as an engaging, fun alternative which allows you to train both Thieving and Agility simultaneously.
---
The buff poll's XP/hr estimates are also under what they should be as players figured out how to get far more tears/hr by optimizing their routes and using Merfolk Trident, so the actual XP/hr ended up being higher than the buff poll's estimate too.
---
&gt;ZMI was an unintended mechanic of people working together, and should have nothing to do with the blog rates as its outside the scope of the average player. 
---
It was an unintended mechanic people were abusing to get far higher XP rates than expected, it was a justified nerf.
---
&gt;The library method is dumb, but if the plugins didn't exist, it should be allowed to exist, the initial creation of the method was amazing
---
I agree, the method is cancer af and was really interesting to see it innovated, and it's disappointing to see the method gone, but it wasn't intended to be in the game so it's fair that it's removed since it was never polled as such. Maybe they could re-introduce it in some way in the future.
---
I dunno if any of you play don't starve but that was one if my favorite parts of that game too. Chop enough trees and one of em comes to life pissed off and tries to kill you
---
I'd even be down with a miniboss themed in a similar way
---
He didn’t go to war, Jesus man
---
"Random" number generator.
---
You had an EXTREME advantage over people who didn't pay. You said yourself you got a few mill, bgs, arma all which someone who didn't pay wouldn't have the same chance of obtaining. It's not that hard to grasp.
---
what
---
At this point Jagex should just start implementing things that will benefit the game.... like paying extra money to use untrabeables past 20 wild and not losing items like defenders or void.
---
Brine Sabre until 60 att then descim for strength training.
---
If you're going to afk fish for xp monks are the way to go as well. Barb is far from afk
---
はい
---
sandwich lady was the worst. 50% success rate here... Honestly didn't know wtf she wanted me to pick. Not a bread/pastry expert. Always got smacked and had to run back.
---
This is why I log into world 303 as a 2095 total
---
Rune scimitar until level 60 attack
---
Then dragon scimitar until 70 attack
---
Then abbysal whip
---
It's a joke. Obviously it happens to other people... can you not?
---
Cremedelatim is my username, hit me up in game and ill help anyway i can mate. Happy hunting
---
r/whoooooooosh
---
While the first one is good, this one is quite the improvement IMO
---
Just for reference in any skill if you look up "&lt;Skill&gt; Calculator OSRS" on Google, there's a caluclator there that shows you how much it costs, how many you need, etc. 
---
So for this, search for Herblore Calculator OSRS
---
You better stick around and roast us still. Wouldnt be the same otherwise. And i am 100% legit going to miss the Data Stream.
---
The rewards other than membership are only available for rs3
---
Ask for evidence before you make your judgement
---
I believe you can still claim it. Just remember to cancel the trial after you do it so you arn't charged later.
---
am i the only one that hates jokes that are people making up stories about themselves that aren’t true to get the “woah i relate to that” reaction
---
Good riddance, but good luck.
---
Constantly making controversial, favoritism based decisions shouldn’t be tolerated. Perhaps he was the unlucky one who had to be vocal about the decisions Jagex made; but with his history with Emily and the Runelite situation, I don’t know.
---
Time spent in your mom's basement is worth approximately 0$ so I think your calculations are a little bit off buddy
---
I was expecting a crab rave remix at the end
---
One of the best mods a player could ask for! I’m excited to see what he does next!
