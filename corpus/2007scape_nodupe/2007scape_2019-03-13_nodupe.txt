The problem is getting it up to 77, I've been trying to get it up but after 10 mins of ZMI i want to kill myself

I like this so much better. The current Hosidius has always looked way too boxy to me, this looks way more natural. 
---
Fuck off.
---
Yes it's getting the cape legit. It's just easier than not using them. When you drop pots you still have to avoid clicking them, for example.
---
Yeah but he's asking a question
---
The lance is underwhelming if anything 
---
Keep 3 of each torch and glove, you will get better rewards after since they roll magic/torstol seeds after 3

That'd be awesome. Cosmetics for how far in you last.

Tithe farm changes need to be reworked. 
---

---
* The wiki states that 25 is the most plantable. It's more intense, but I'm sure some people like that.
---
* One of the ways of doing 25 plots is with 3 rows. This update only has two rows.
---
* Tithe farm is not player instanced, it's group instanced. With this change, it needs to be instanced to the player. There's nothing you can do about getting crashed there except move on (and it has happened to me).

Its a shame they literally give 0 fucks about LMS anymore. Time after time they said they would work on it/rejuvenate it but nothing has been done for a long time now. This is something I dont like about the game atm. They always want to release new content but with content that is buried in the ground they leave it to rot. 
---
That's only because people compare it to blowpipe and tbow, which are completely overpowered.

But if a jmod hacks you with authenticator, it still your fault
---
Yeah I can see how this happens I ended up turning 300m into 4b then I ended up losing it all even tho I had more than enough on the game but it will teach me nothing good comes from gambling so ive decided to stop playing rs so I don’t stake again 
---
What I meant by that is, it won't really affect PvP as much as people think it will. Power creep is a real thing but I think introducing BiS gear with high risk &amp; clear weaknesses is a fine trade-off.

I just find the concept of a hat destroying someone humorous. My grammar/spelling on reddit is atrocious, no judgment here.

ZMI is not hard to manage.  Once you have a good inventory and banking rhythm, you just follow people to the altar.

This wasn’t about hacking. You’re missing the point.

That account was highly contested because I was a young dumb kid that gave his password to all his friends, I wasn’t surprised. My point was that the recovery system is automated and if you remember when your account was created and the original passwords to the account you will get it back.

Yeah pretty much but doubt I’ll start over again just simply can’t be bothered I only started playing again in my free time

No, my understanding is you get an appeal button when the ban comes in, you need to use that. They have separate systems for support tickets and bans. That's why they do not respond to appeals through the support tickets.
---
I keep my runes, cash and teleport tabs/jewellery to the top sorted, and then have subsections for different types of things. There's a potion subsection with a placeholder for each dose, a tool section for stuff like hammer and chisel and all that, a gear section with all the juicy stuff, loottab section, junk section, etc. Try to put stuff you use together often in one tab, or close to each other
---
I completely agree.  It's deception and manipulation on a MASSIVE scale.  Honestly giving someone a child when they don't want one is literally probably one of the worst things you can do to a person short of killing them.  It's the largest possible commitment that the average person can ever make in their entire lives, and someone trying to make that commitment for them should absolutely be illegal in as effective and as functional a way as it possibly can be.  Especially if there are other laws in place that force the unwilling party to pay child support no matter what.  That basically amounts to scamming a person out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  There's no way that should be acceptable under the law.
---
yes
---
You're right when it comes to entitled people who don't know how to take care of themselves, but for a regular person 5k can enable them to make some moves that'll improve their situation. I'm about to be moving from one first world country to another, and the 3k i saved up is going to help me get situated and set up. Of course 5k isn't enough to ride on your whole life, but for a resourceful young person it can go a really long way.

Mine is the GE music. I can't stand it.

Good idea! While I'm at it, I'll just give everyone my bank and recovery questions!

Yes. The demand for chaps is higher. The supply for blessed chaps is **much** higher than the supply for d'hide (g) chaps though. Significantly so. There are too many of them in the game for pures buying them to influence the prices by any relevant amount. 
---
&gt;and zamorak + bandos pages are more expensive than every other book because they are bis items for pures.
---
Bandos pages are dirt cheap though. Zammy page prices are the only relevant point you've made this entire time, but you wanna know something funny? Individual zammy pages are traded less than blessed d'hide chaps too. The supply is lower, thus meaning higher prices. You're just focusing on the price and not the other relevant market data.   
---
It's not hard to find a spot.
---
Git gud and beat the crashers. 
---
The AMA was about diversity in the workforce and in specific the gaming industry. Please circlejerk somewhere else.
---
Skills are always worth more than gear my man.
---
Well if the price has increased for implings then the inherent drops should increase also.  If anything more then wave which would be more about luck to maximize profit. 
---
Lets say you are willing to spend 3.3k a jar and average 3.5k per jar   at 200 profit per jar you feel its worth your time. Now you have broke even with a ranger drop well before you finish opening jars so you would still make 200 more per jar instead of selling and have the chance to get another ranger drop. 
---
If he had no other interest then he totally could sell and rebuy later but say they spend a few days over his price threshold then he can't do content that he seem to deem enjoyable. Think of it like a toy building company they buy material at $60  and profit $20 dollars say they have the chance to sell the material at $80 that would cover their normal profit but you are then out of business till the price drops again if you want to continue making toys.

That’s an insane amount of clues my man.  Very nice!

I mean, how much money have you lost out on by waiting so far? Have you looked at trends? It'll probably go back up at some point i guess in the end it just comes down to if you want the money or not. Or if you can convince a merch clan to buy all the coal and boost prices
---
Original series? Who made the original area lock?
---
&gt; Every site on the web would be Fort Knox if there wasn't a usability tradeoff. If you want Jagex to lose a shitload of players, yes mandate all that crap and make people enter bank pin every time they move, the word for it is rs3.
---
Bruh what in the hell are you talking about?
---
Why would Jagex LOSE a shit ton of players for trying to increase the security on their end and what the hell are you talking about with entering a bank pin every time they move? Im talking about improving account security and recovery on their end..nothing to do with in game. There are simple and easy things they can do like add a delay to the authenticator and allow players to more easily be able to lock their account should it be hacked, and do something like Blizzard did like require photo ID for an account, theres A LOT they can learn from the way Blizzard goes about things where players actually champion their customer support and how they do their account recovery because its actually good. Why do WoW players not need to worry like RS players do, while also not REQUIRING to go through such extensive ways to try and secure their account properly?
---
&gt; It's also not fair to compare the security of rs (where people may have thousands of dollars worth of items) to other games where it's pointless to hack accounts so you never hear about it.
---
Again what in the hell are you saying? Not fair to compare? Are you even being serious? Its pointless to hack WoW accounts LOL? As if you cant sell WoW accounts for a pretty penny and like you coudlnt sell gold for a good deal of money before they introduced buyable tokens for gold, the gold farming market was MASSIVE during WoW's prime, so was the buying and selling of accounts which completely flies in the face of your crazy idea that its "pointless" to hack an account. The market was literally far bigger than the RS RWT market is right now. The reason you dont hear about it is because its MUCH more difficult for someone to successfully hack and take control of a WoW account, while doign the same for an RS account is FAR easier which is a large part of the reason why hacking and shit is such a bigger problem with RS and this is because of the systems in place. It seems like many people on this sub are completely clueless when it comes to WoW/Blizzard and how much more secure and better their system is as well as many people acting like there is no value in WoW accounts which is actually completely baffling given how big the RWT market was during the long tenure of WoWs prime where the market was MUCH larger than the RS RWT market.

When will PVM hi-scores be added to the game?

Can we make it so that once you receive one specific mutagen at Zulrah thr next will be the one you dont have? Currently you can end up getting multiple of the same one before seeing the other and with them being such a low drop rate it would help save some sanity.

Can we discuss "stackable" clue scrolls? The current system seems balanced in terms of xp/gp.
---
Whenever you get a clue scroll you're faced with 2 options: 
---
1. Break away from your task for a rare chance at a good reward.
---
2. Continue doing your task and gaining xp.
---
If stackable clues are introduced, players will be able to reap the benefits of both options.

Too hard to see your stats in that picture on mobile. Should do a screen shot of just stats up close if really want help

Did you have authenticators on email and account? Did you have a good password? Avoid phishing links? Not share your account with anyone?
---
No you should never have to pray melee at Vork. If you only use a super antifire pot, dragonfire attacks will cause damage. You need both the shield and potion. 
---
awfully presumptuous of you but ok
---
Why snitching cmonbruh
---
Check the graph from last 6 months. There are no updates right now scheduled that would boost the price so i would probably sell if they are in steady decline. But you never know man. It's not easy to predict the market. But chances are it won't go up. So unless the last 6 month's shows its been fluctuating up and down, I would assume its probably just down, so better off selling. 
---
Ive not seen the graph though so i suggest you do some research first. 
---
Yes yes, I was just jesting :)

How did it feel when your character got anally penetrated by the stinger?

Thank you all so much but mutedinlife helped me out I appreciate you all!!

It all comes down to the bottom line
---
Pretty sure they failed because of the way the polls were worded. People saw "remove the def req of these items that require 40 def" and thought it was equivalent to removing the def requirement of rune items, which obviously sounds ridiculous.
---
Seen multiple people say they didn't actually know blessed dhide chaps only gave +1 pray bonus over black dhide chaps which have no def requirement. Some didn't even know black dhide chaps have no def requirement so they thought 1 def players were getting t40 gear for no reason.

They stop agroing after about 10 minutes in which case you could just walk past the stairs that go down and back into the room to reset agro

Is there any update on herb sack accepting cleaned herbs

I can not stress how much more efficient the game becomes when barrow gloves are your first goal. I got them within 2 weeks of making my account (i grinded HARD for them lol) because not only are the gloves BiS pretty much forever, it also trains necessary stats and quests for you. Its Also a lot harder to do the grind once you get higher level lol. I was lvl 72 when I finished RFD and was so happy.

afk combat ahead: high prayer + str bonus armor, all melee only bosses on a hard rumble. only requires a click for overload every 5 mins and to peek at your prayer points every couple of minutes. alternatively, for worse combat exp but more afk and less expensive, fossil island crabs, full void + highest str bonus/barrows gloves/torture/prims/bludgeon get me around 70k xp/hr. only requires to reset aggro every 10-15 mins, personally i do this while working on assignments and use nmz while watching lectures. i generally find nmz to be more distracting though.

Can the magic whistle be re-obtainable post completion of the Holy Grail quest. It’s odd that the only way to get back to the fishers realm is by fairy rings which have very little to do with the quests lore. Just make it possible to get the holy table napkin from Galahad, then make that spawn the draynor manor magic whistle like in the quest. It’s currently impossible to get either item post quest completion. 
---
Sweet, farming patch is closer to the kourend tp, will cut my walking distance in half for my med clue grind. Thanks jamflex.

That's how I get with farming every few months. I'll refuse to train forever, but then I'll go for like 3 months where I set alarms on my phone so that I can get on to farm right when they finish growing lol

I meant used as in, viable for situations. I overlooked SoTD's DMG % for sure. As far as accuracy and price, this is an amazing trade off
---
would you say the dmg % on the spells would need to be boosted? Because with the same/higher max hit than Barrage, it would make more sense to freeze then Zaros (spell) until theyre unfrozen since you'll be providing a chance at extra damage overall
---
You do. It's not removed because it is offensive, it's because it's against the rules.

TBH for me I never do as long as I do something very afk. Thats why teaks are great, its one click every 10-20 seconds so its perfect for in between sets, but theres plenty of other things.

What’re those staves?

Q
---
Hmmm
---
&gt; viable for situations.
---
what does this mean, all 4 of the staffs kodai + 3 i mentioned have situations where they're viable. smoke bstaff for splashing/normal magics pking, ahrims for cheaper pking or set effect, sotd for pking with risk, but less than kodai, and venom effect
---
&gt;would you say the dmg % on the spells would need to be boosted?
---
no theres just no way to make them viable. either you spend 1 attack cycle casting it, then next attack cycle barraging with a bit more % dmg, and youre worse off, because doing 2 barrages instead would have been better.
---
if the dmg % is like 50-100% (the range where it might be mathematically worth it in some situations), then in pvp teams will do the zaros spell before hand for the boost, not cast the barrage, then take turns casting OP barrages on a target and it becomes basically impossible to tank

Engine work/10.

Lets say it was me that hacked you. I got on your account, took all your valuables, then transferred them across multiple accounts. Then i sold those items on the ge to whoever buys them. Jagex can take shit from my accounts but unless they take exactly what was stolen, they’re duplicating items if they give it back to you. 
---
Lets say you were a staker with 3 twisted bows. If i took them and sold them on the ge, they are either forcibly removing bows from the buyers which is bad for them or they are putting 3 more bows in the game than there were initially.

I have 4125 Vorkath kc after my last task and it does get to the point where saving food doesn't actually increase your kills/hour since you have to leave after a certain number of kills anyway since you'll be out of inventory space. I bring 2 doses of extended super antifire and in those 12 minutes of protection get an average of 6 kills per trip and the loot neatly fills my inventory unless there are multiple drops of 2-3 rune items.

Nope. You bought the gp, use it to your advantage. Screw what other people say about your gear it’s fine. Just get to the grind and start getting things in the game that truly benefit your account like a firecape, barrows gloves, dragon defender etc. Throw some of that gp into stats that really help your account more than gear ever would - 83 con for max POH, 70 prayer for piety (if you don’t already have it) etc.

did they take out the ability to talk to a mod in game? 
---
Fake, but impressive they got [noreply@jagex.com](mailto:noreply@jagex.com) on there. They don't send emails like this. 
---
You already purchased the bonds and use the GE to get in-game items.  You will not be able to get a refund.
---
Unfortunately they did. You can open a ticket and communicate with the ticket in game but that’s the same 2-3 day waiting period that comes with email because that’s essentially what it is.

It's said and done. Go run barrows 1k times and you'll understand what a hard grind for money is. Then lie and say you grinded barrows. Or sell all your gear, use that money to buy bonds and earn your gear legit
---
Obvious scam. Only trust things in your message center
---
Based on the vast majority of responses from the update thread as well as people chattering in Kourend.
---
Stats and gear?
---
I've honestly thought I don't have a chance with my defense level (91). Kinda want to do stuff on Mobile for the time being cause that's easiest for me while handling my newborn.
---
As for Apex, all my friends want me to play it and if I'm being honest I'm like 99% sure I won't like it based off other similar games I've played. But maybe it's time for a hail Mary 🤗

bond boi

Protect ya neck

I’m just sitting here staring at my character in the Ge, I just can’t Chief

I do barrows runs on mobile while at work. You would be surprised what's possible with too much free time and being bored at work will do. Ofc I would rather play on PC but can't have all that xp waste

there are no situations where the def bonus on dboots really matters and you'd be noticeably worse off using manacles instead of dboots
---
I didn’t DDS or AGS because I didn’t know what the hell those were. 
---
F2P as a child, definitely played like I was F2P for a few days at the beginning of OSRS because it was what I knew

Shocking to me Jagex can’t just send a Jmod over there and manually ban the accounts

Too damn clever dude.. always impressed

---
Morytania isn’t exactly a zone filled with meta training areas and so he’s really exploring ‘new areas’ for many.  In contrast to Karamja for example which in my noobs days have explored every inch of as it’s filled with many more quests and relevant areas.  
---
Maybe. I think it had a F2P weekend but https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Last_Man_Standing says it is P2P.
---

Regardless, what I meant is that P2P players and F2P players should both play on F2P servers.

Yeah def return it...can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that much on someone you trusted.

I can hear Tears for Fears playing...

Stop posting pictures of this kid you're obsessed.

You too bro

See also: Jagex should know how retarded I am and not listen to results of polls, because of that sever retardation.
---
It’s easy to come to that conclusion fucking two years later lol 
---
try taking a break when you get to jad, you can log out and pause the waves
---
theres also sites you can use to practice flicking
---
if you want to take a break before trying again, any higher stats will just make it easier so cant hurt to get your range up some more
---
you can 100% get it, after you do it the first couple of times you'll wonder why you thought it was hard its like riding a bike
---
When Will you guys add South American worlds? RS3 has 4 that never get more than 500 people online! The Brazilian community would love to play with a good ping &lt;3
---
Instead of using it on gear use it to get some helpful buyable skills like prayer and construction so you can work your way back up to it
---
Won't change PVP in the slightest, they will only be used in high risk fights as novelty items. 
---
To put it another way, if you hosted a pure tornament with a 10bil prize pool, no one would turn up with either of these. They just arnt good outside of melee training. 
---
fire bolt can't melt steel bars
---
Thank you, do you know around how much per hour this is? If I kept to timing the worlds?
---
No it shouldn't, it's a word.
---
I meant the rewards, are they OSRS?
---
Are you retarded.. OP is/was an ironman with low funds, the fuck is s/he going to do with molten glass. The only item that could produce some gp is/are orbs, but OP said they needed money; in order to use said orbs you need battlestaves. AGAIN I ask did you even fucking read the post or did you blurt out a kneejerk reaction without thinking. Fucking bellend.
---
If you go to an activity or boss page on the osrs wiki, they usually have a table of the top 5 items for each slot.
---
Lemme find an example
---
Please. 
---
I have rigour already. I got rigour and 84 con the first time I had 100m (back when dhcb was 105m...before the spike to 160mish)
---
im not sure how much competition there is at that spot ive never actually done it sorry. i know it can be upwards of 1m/hr but the more competition the less you'll make
---
Yeah, I had a desperate buddy and it was REALLY obvious he was juicing, he even admitted it pretty openly when I asked. Still, I don't really blame him, he was so huge he literally couldn't have gone further natty.

Do you know what the term ragger means? Someone with this staff would legit 1 item rag with a super restore/prayer potion and some food due to it being a FREE spell with ZERO costs. Granted no one would use it in pvp during the first few months due to how grossly overpriced it would be, but seriously no rune cost for magic; good luck getting that to pass a poll.
---
There is no way they will be 30m+... rangers being 30m+ is because of pegasians. 
---
Lmao imagine thinking that you can't have free markets and universal Healthcare.

Reminder to vote Trump in 2020, or be exiled to Hell!
---
this is such an open ended question its hard to answer, what do you enjoy doing in the game?
---
some potential ideas, just keep slaying, 5 more levels for the whip. get 99 (or just a higher lvl) in the skills you dont need other supplies for, fishing, agi, mining
---
do wintertodt
---
if you dont want to skill, you could go for completionist type stuff. get all the different slayer stuffed heads, kurask, cockatrice, basilisk, crawling hand. get champions cape. that kind of stuff can be stored in your poh
---
Thinking about making an ironman to play on when when im doing afk stuff on my main. 
---
Just not sure if ill like iron man mode as I rely A LOT on the GE ha, but the thought of earning everything sounds intriguing, but also overwhelming at the same time.
---
Just wanted to get some thoughts from people who've done this and that maybe had the same thoughts and/or concerns.
---
True but edgy layer is new, wasnt a part of rs2.
---
I disagree with how RS3 handled the lore.  Killing guthix was a mistake, and I dislike the focus on gods.  It makes me too important in a game where you click rocks for hours to train.  I don't want my character to be someone special.
---
Well, the thing is goldfarmers are just as big a problem. As depressing as it sounds, people manually farming the gold is a huge player in the economy. This week venezuala suffered wide power outages and the trade volume of many resources plummeted.
---
Muted at worst.
---
Yeah I don’t trust Jagex to not fuck that up.
---
16 def in a boot slot, yes thats a lot. 
---
following the lore of runescape as a whole, runes werent used for magic
---
People rag these days with range/melee. whats your point? Raggers will rag with whatever they choose.
---
That very poll was influenced by the problem it was trying to solve.
---
I don’t think so. I have never seen any “rewards” for OSRS.

This sub always confuses me when it hits /r/all.

No it's not bad. There will be lots of newbies there as well if it's your first time. Some people just play it to play it really, I mean of course they grind for all the gear etc and boosts for BA but otherwise it is always worth it. It's just that finding experienced BA players will be a lot more efficient.
---
Yep, stringing is the way to go because it's more profitable and 33% faster than cutting at the same xp.
---
Pkers make it hard enough to kill wildy bosses. Don’t need as many mechanics as normal bosses.
---
Lol
---
Thanks man!
---
Making it drain a prayer on turn on would still be exploitable though, people would just turn on something like steel skin (very slow drain) and flick their protect prayers. You would have to make it drain every switch to avoid that, what what I was saying. Which means every time you switch prayers on jad, you would instantly lose a point. It would make inferno a huge problem too.
---
I also would rather be Ragged with a staff that can max 30 rather than a D claw Balista combo

Is there any way to change the camera so that it moves immediately when the character moves? Like right now once you move the camera stays in place for a split second, and when you stop the camera glides to a halt right after your character stops.

I think runite ore mining is really great after Varrock elite and getting the best possible mining gloves.

yea its good and the dboots are objectively better. but theres no situations where you go "oh shit i cant do that content i only have manacles not dboots" or where you'd want to swap out the +4 str of manacles for the +2 str and def bonus of rune boots
---
Congrats OP! Keep it goin. I recommend getting going on farming too, I didn’t train it for like the first year of my account and now it’s my favorite skill. 
---
If you need to ask... then pretty much always yes
---
I like to use arma helm at raids

I fuckin love it

And getting such hateful DM's over a post like yours is never okay, no matter what the outcome is. Since no-one but you will ever know the truth, I'll apologize on behalf of the community. That's fucked up and I would not want to have to deal with that, and i'm sorry that you had to deal with it just to play osrs. 
---
That's exactly what I mean about the whole 'outrage' mob when shit like this goes down. People just want to be apart of the group, and when the group is swaying a certain direction, your gonna see an influx of posts related to recent events.

This whole “gives a strength bonus” argument is so dumb. You’re not always potted to the same level and as it goes down there’s levels your max hit will still be higher.
---
try `chmod +x $URSCRIPT.sh` and then `./$URSCRIPT.sh`
---
Who cares
---
Poggers!
---
Idk, triple jads is something that you get all at once imo.
---
But osrs accounts are the same as rs3 accounts? So they have different teams for each game or one central team? 
---
What I'm saying is that rs3 has mtx and still has shit customer service
---
You'd rather he get it way wrong by basing it on the inferior or superior races of amerimuttland?

Unsure bout the double RDT, I think RDT drops are highly overrated in general though, they're like 1/30 from most bosses.
---
Definitely!

I still got that one Nightwish song on my iPod.

How do I answer math clue scroll questions? Do I type the answer in chat?

Gold farmers in general make low level money making methods shit. Theyre making more bad than good to new players trying to get some starting cash. 
---
Unfortunately no. I think the death mechanics are such that if you die outside of wildy, the items just disappear if you don't reclaim them
---
What if we got the J Mods to play as the bosses, and have weapons that when equipped cause the boss to do a corresponding attack/mechanic?
---
Also yes I am aware that you can disable the custom window through the "Enable Custom Window Chrome" option to enable this in Windows, I just don't really like how it looks with the regular window. Plus this way it could be cross-platform
---
Number 1 tip: the wiki is your best friend. It has an unfathomable amount of info for everything you could look for. Oldschool.runescape.wiki is the URL, the "Fandom" link you see in Google sometimes is the old wiki, it's trash, and it's not supported anymore. That has pretty much everything you could look for when starting out. For anything else, YouTube is a great resource. There are a wealth of content creators that give a ton of general tips and guides on things to do. Slayermusiq is the God of quest guides. Asuyaken, Theoatrix, Autumn Elegy are some channels for skilling!/bossing guides and different general tips. It's a big(BIG) game, try and find something you think would be fun to do, and go at getting the requirements. My longtime goal from when I was little was to do Barrows, which is a great money maker for mid level accounts. Just find something that appeals to you, and try and get the things you need to get to that point, again, using the wiki and YouTube to help with this. Some good early goals to work towards are getting barrows gloves from Recipe for Disaster, getting a fire cape, getting all of your stats to 50, completing all easy/medium diaries, etc. These are some hefty goals to work towards, but that's half the fun of the game:feeling yourself getting closer and closer to goals you once thought were impossible. Good luck friend, it's a wild ride.

Most of us don't want filth on our Christian server.

alternative in what way? strength or defensive bonuses? fashionscape is subjective.  
---
obsidian platebody is the only other strength granting chest slot item in the game and it is almost entirely inferior to the torso besides magic bonuses. otherwise use barrows armour.

If a player were to grind towards obtaining the full black chicken outfit for the collection log, what would be an efficient way to work towards getting bird eggs?

If it’s a medium clue you just talk to the person who gave it to you to give the answer

It already is toggleable through disabling the plugin through the usual way of doing it, and I also have other settings to control it.
---
1. enable mouse window snapping
---
2. enable keyboard shortcut snapping
---
3. enable custom window size (which means when it snaps, the window will automatically change to the size that is user customizable)

hopefully that answered your concerns, thank you for the feedback

It's something in the works, as we've revealed during RuneFest. [Here is an example](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Abyssal_demon#Drops).

It's incredible, the fake text box looks higher resolution than the real one.
---
Good luck man it’s a lot of fun and worth the work 
---
This looks like fun - how do you move them? Trade and run?
---
Nope, nothing else compares. In most cases def bonus hardly matters but bcp also gives prayer so it’s always better if you can afford it
---
I'm so pissed about fishing trawlers and Lake Molch.
---
Fishing outfit used to take like 30 minutes to get, now it takes like 10 hours at Trawler. Lake Molch takes an unbelievable amount of time to get it as well.

maintaining prayer isnt as important when you kill jad like 2x faster. Even though your accuracy and damage per hit are lower, you're getting off three hits in the same time you shoot 1 bolt

What about the current design feels like RS3 to you?

RS3 seems to be really good about graphical and logistical design, for what little new places they've added to the world.

I can honestly understand where you're coming from but like damn man 300mill+ loss is a big deal, yeah you can buy all your shit back but an instant loss of so much is crazy.
---
On the real good shit if you seriously don't consider 300mill a loss. I didn't think that type existed, probably because I haven't ever had more than a 30 mill bank but I was thinking even if I had sparcmacs bank 300+mill would destroy me
---
So random question, I'm attempting to do a clue scroll. but its stuck in the elven region.  I'm at a 'huge gate' just south of the gnome stronghold but the Elf Warrior guarding the door says that I need documentation sealed by one of the great houses?  Is this referring to something in Kourend?
---
Adding it to your client is not feasible right now unless you have development experience. You have to build runelite manually to be able to add a plugin
---
You can argue semantics all you like, fact is that a multi million company is charging more money for a service that has become worse.

Oh man not only does OP buy gold but he uses auto clickers too.

I just wanna go ahead and say I wasn’t talking shit, it’s great art. But the people have spoken, and the people want tits.
---
I know this is only slightly related, but it would be awesome if you could make a plugin to maintain the aspect ratio of the window when resizing, not just the game.  I find myself having to line it up all the time so that there are no black bars below or on top of my game.

ah, must not be a thing for windows 7 then

---
Wow you seem like the most secure person I've ever met can I be your friend
---
Steam battlestaff I believe
---
Of course it’s not COMPLETELY protected, and I never said anything to claim it is? 
---
But it’s definitely in a better position compared to if your email is compromised with Jagex. If someone wants to try and change the name on the account and remove/change information so they can take complete control of the account then photo id needs be to be produced. People hack RS accs far more often because it’s simply a lot easier to do so, there wasn’t ever near the problem Jagex has even though there was a far larger player base because the system was better and their customer support was just leagues better. 
---
People are only downvoting me simply because this is an RS sub and people are Jagex fanboys and most likely don’t even have a single clue about WoW and blizzard yet anyone whose played both extensively will tell you Blizzards system and support is very clearly better. There’s a reason why Jagex developed their reputation and Blizzard developed theirs of being fantastic with support and securing your account. It’s legitimately mind boggling to me these kids are trying to deny and downvote something that anyone with an objective view and knowledge of both would very obviously say Blizzards support is/was MUCH better but I mean hey if they just want to believe whatever narrative they want to believe and delude themselves into thinking Jagex is doing just fine(which is so weird since for years and years people complained about these very things these people are trying to claim Jagex does just as well as Blizzard) then no problem but don’t sit there and act like you’re right when there’s such incredibly obvious evidence that they’re wrong even if they choose to ignore it or just be ignorant of it. I mean people are stating some ridiculously absurd shit and it’s actually being upvoted because this sub is rampant with bias and kids fanboying acting like Jagex is this super great company when it comes to this stuff when their reputation alone precedes that notion.
---
Is this assuming you have dragonfire ward and pray range with rigour? Because no matter the setup bp beats dhc by a big margin when it comes to raw dps on vorkath. 
---
Funny thing is you can talk to Seer to bank your items
---
Depends on where you work and what caused you to scream it out. I can think of a couple of situations where you probably wouldn’t get fired.
---
Also, holding onto the connotations of these types of words only creates more division. Let its meaning change naturally rather than being a little bitch when someone says it in an online video game. Chances are they said it with the intent of triggering you
---
Not saying it excuses this guys behaviour, but there is an ignore function for a reason.

You can even get banned if you say it alot

No you need Regicide finished IIRC

I'd recommend the clan osrs advice
---
1. Not at all hard to see, maybe change your settings / monitor colors. 
---
2. This would "crash" the raids market, as new purples would flood in the game quicker. 
---
3. This is a unique boss mechanic that takes a learned skill to overcome.
---
4. This is a unique boss mechanic that takes a learned skill to overcome. 
---
5. Use humidify. 
---
It sounds like you're just new and/or inexperienced/unskilled at Raids 1. It's not super easy, there is a learning curve and it doesn't need to be changed and made easier so newer players don't have to learn it, in my opinion.
---
What does economics have to do with fuck all of this argument?
---
That you're not paying employees to fill a role which would need you to pay them?
---
Hey buddy, did you realize that there is already customer support and they are already being paid without having MTX in the game? Who would've thought, clearly not you.

Dropped like 3k laws hoping I could box fast enough. Was not Muhammad Ali.

I tried luring them to dark wizards as well by trading, most stop at the GE steps. I got one as far as the varrock SW wall before it turned around. Tried tele other but they have accept aid off. 
---
Is there any other way to disrupt them?
---
Ahhh, the stream with no date. They’ll keep procrastinating that one until 2020 is my bet. They’ve known about these questions for 2 years minimum, and they still don’t have answers, I don’t think we’ll ever get them.

can you make inventory placeholders instead

Lol you don’t need 90 herb right away. Wait until you have a decent amount of GP to blow then get it, as only 1 person in a group needs it. I’d just sell the herbs from farm runs, then buy the potions that are the best GP/exp.

Lmao what's bothering you little Johnny? Why are you so emotional right now? Did you run out of pop tarts? Did mom say shes going to kick you out the basement?  Talk to me here. This is a safe space

If you're drinking an Anti-Venom+ dose per kill at a rate of 24 zulrah kills an hour the difference is only about 66k an hour for full usage. You're also only losing about 1/15th of your profit when not including unique drops.

You're right, i have brought up the hiding poll issue myself several times in the past year. Hopefully the drama sorrounding this doesnt die down anytime soon, it seems like the only way to get a response now days. Create as much negative publicity as possible.

Hey, Peter here this is a really funny meme about the game RuneScape. So the joke is that in RuneScape the company (JAGEx) spent multiple years teasing a rework for the in game banking system. Eventually however, they made an announcement saying that they were going to shelve the project for an indefinite amount of time. This post references that fact and alludes to the fact that osrs won’t get a rework either.  This joke was humerus, I hope you liked my explanation. 
---
I would immediately do a tournament of all the GWD bosses with their generals against one another’s

It's just a crab emoji, wth 🦀
---
There’s been a ton of drama about poll results for literally 2.5 years, they just don’t care. The drama won’t die down, they’ll just ignore us.
---
Just live with it.
---
Also people have always been able to look up your stats here: [https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore\_oldschool/overall.ws](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/overall.ws)  
---
Runelite just has a built in tool that checks the hiscores, why wouldn't that be allowed?
---
You could always sell your expensive shit and use it on buyable skills (prayer and construction are great choices here) if having the gear bothers you that much.
---
Finally, thanks for buying bonds so I can pay a bit of gold for my membership instead of having to spend real money.

The runescape economy is not centrally planned. You couldn't be more wrong. In communism you willingly give up everything you produce and you are "supposed" to get back what you need. 
---
That's literally what "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" means. It means you produce what you can (ability) and are given what you need (needs). Like just what are you talking about?

this. people think because it doesnt generate wealth that is doesnt count for some reason? Sure it doesnt hurt the game's economy but it is a pure MTX pay 2 win feature lol.
---
B ring i is still double the str bonus
---
Don't know what other people are on about, the accuracy bonus from melee void is better than any melee armor you can bring.
---
The strategy I was doing was spec once with bgs and if it hits decently save the second spec for another kill. If no specs hit just tele out and try again.
---
If you consider the average wealth for the players entering warrior’s guild, this bot did a 200 iq move

Is this a meme because it’s reposted every night, or is it just a constant repost?

I always watch movies while doing barrows runs or afk tasks I would kill for this. Currently I have to resize everything manually and it's annoying.

I kind of used the word communism for meme value, though socialism would be better suited here. Socialism is a very broad spectrum of ideas, and definitely not all include planned economies. Some don't even include states. The only real requirement is that means of production are publicly owned. As I said somewhere else in this comment thread, Runescape's economy could probably be best described as mutualism. That's a form of libertarian socialism.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory)
---
Just to be clear, I'm not a mutualist.
---
It used to be like you say, now its more elaborate on the hijacker side. Security layers turn useless to recovery claims and yes, account rwters lie about this, bur legit owners get hijacked too, thing is, security layers are meant to require you're really you even when some one can fake being you very good.

Right. Let me invest 1,000+ hours of tedious effort for $1600, no opportunity for advancement, no benefits, and no career path because RS gp is so valuable.
---
No.  It's valuable because it allows you to have fun and escape.  If you don't use it for fun or escape, you're taking away its main value.  Hoarding it and not having fun so you can have an extra grand a few years later is horrible time investment and a terrible use of your GP.

I wouldn't suggest void, I don't see how the offensive bonuses are any good at barrows, and its got bad defensive stats.
---
It really doesn't matter too much.  I've seen people wearing all kinds of different stuff in guides and in game.  I would suggest adjusting it to fit your needs.  If you run out of prayer, take proselyte, if you need to eat a lot take tank gear.  Take at least a dhide chest with you as a switch.

I, as another person who didn’t know, did not vote since I’m not a pker and didn’t really understand the implications of a change like that. There’s a lot of people who skip questions they don’t know. Unfortunately not everyone will, and this is an issue we still see often in real life.
---
Very doable as long as you can pray correctly

Thx nice silver ;)

i never understood the reason of that odd house at west of the railroad place in before rework. were they like: this area seems empty, lets place empty house that you can walkthough?
---
I took in rune packs to the fight, opened them and safespoted the npc with magic 200iq
---
Some Barrows brothers have zero mage defense so if magic accuracy bonus doesn’t effect hit chance, the void mage set effect is (one of) the only other thing that would make you roll a hit more frequently yes?
---
I am unsure of the number logic behind any of this. Basic logic behind Barrows is minimize the time you spent killing the brothers so there are less prayer drain effects so you only have to use 1 dose maximum of prayer potion on the final brother by the rewards chest.

YES. Always struck me as odd that it wasn't already a feature. Hell I didn't even know Windows didn't automatically do that for every window until rl

I don't know why the other two people are suggesting nieve and konar. I think Duradel is the way to go at 100 combat. Think carefully about which task to block and which to skip. Some tasks give good money and others are fast exp/points. I think it will suit what you are looking for as a 'good mix'.
---
I never did konar but i heard she is bad exp. And I did a lot of Nieve and I think the gp/hr is trash. Duradel can offer both good gp and exp.

For the love of Jesus please make this a thing. I hate how the window doesnt snap.

Gotcha, any idea why he breezes through my food? I make minimal mistakes, but I gotta take a few saras just to last 4-5 kills, where without them I can sometimes go as few as 2 kills, would 88 mage really do that?

Delete this before it is ruined
---
I have to agree. I hope Jagex sticks to the poll results. If the community (aka this subreddit) does not shut up, poll it third time and see how it fails again.

Can't wait for this, wasn't keen on this area when I first went there. The new update looks so much better! Can't wait for it to be released

If they repoll it now i demand we repoll every failed poll in the past again!
---
karambwans are pretty easy. they're right next to a fairy ring and the spot never moves so they're more AFK than monks. Also you can 1-tick cook them if you want, way faster than standard 4 tick cooking.
---
IF we repoll it we should repoll other "mistakes" also.
---
This is (at least as far as I can tell) a step in the right direction but still lacks one of the most important features of the built-in windows version. When I snap a window it gives me suggestions of my other windows to snap next to it.  
---
Of course I have had the window chrome off since about 30 minutes after installing runelite.
---
Once I'm done getting elite void I'm going to try zulrah

It got buffed a few months back.  Used to be trash, but they doubled the xp reward for handing in the stick, and it's now higher xp/h than ardy rooftop even, though it's more click intensive and can be extremely sensitive to missing ticks during the stone jumping and vaulting sections.

Seems like he mostly used the standard brushes, you can either start with flat colours and paint darker shades of colour into it. Or you could paint grayscale first and start adding colours after. There’s not really a special trick to this, just know your lighting basics and work on shading values. 
---
I guess working in a factory and not even getting 15mins of sunlight does that to people

Or you can take a Dramen branch from Lost City and fletch it inside the combat area to have a weapon in there.

lmaooooo
---
If I cared about their community?
---
First of all, the community is one of the worst things about this game. Every side wants something different and is toxic as all hell. I care about what I think is best for the game. If I voted based on “communities” then I’d be one of the people voting no to something just because I disliked one other section of the player base.
---
I also strongly disagree with the sentiment that any changes to PvP would be bad that break the “nostalgic old school feel” or that any changes are automatically “RS3”. It really is a weak argument when the best you can come up with is “let’s not be RS3”; it’s a straw man.
---
I agree with you, but imo this is something different. Imagine going to your country's election and right outside was a updated result of the standings.

I noticed that before that power outage nature runes were about 194gp each, which is a ridiculous low price

I always just wrote it down. But after picking it up in January and already completing it I memorized it this time and it kinda was an accomplishment when I put that lil bitch demon back into the stone trap it was in
---
I do see what you mean to be fair it is a bit iffy im for it not being revealed also i just don't like the precedent so it's two conflicting interests in my books which makes this whole situation a fucking mess.
---
They should of hid them to start with and not polled it.
---
Tell that to the people who are against mtx.. I'm not against bonds. I'm against double exp or directly buying exp or pointless cosmetics you can only get with mtx.
---
\*CLAP\* Finally some truth in here, why are people downvoting this
---
People did the same with castle wars items too. If im remembering correctly you could actually trade some of the items too and they did have a black market value. This was rs2 though around 08
---
Also, don’t use the soft round brush. This will make everything look airbrushed, practice shading with the hard round brush and pen pressure
---
Remind me again why you think Jagex should hide the poll results? If anyone is that easily biased by social influences, then they shouldn’t read ALL the current poll results before voting. Are you guys fucking retarded? You want Jagex to fix someone else’s fuck up?
---
Done well, there!
---
RuneScape is like economy for first graders lol
---
Let's be honest guys, you think Jagex can afford to support their player base with such a limited revenue stream? Yet you all meme about $11 membership and not wanting MTX but want all all the small updates and everything else QOL to be improved on a daily basis. Not to mention, constant witch-hunting on reddit, integrity issues on the game, and many more problems that need to be fixed. If membership was \*required\* I'm sure they would have much more resources to handle all these things 
---
It’s a stupid and worthless idea not worthwhile to anyone.

Yes, all software should support this.

---
Very much so. I personally use 15 FPS all the time. On mobile the change is minimal/barely noticeable in terms of performance and the battery drain is a nice chunk less!
---
Some people want Jagex to hide the poll results so they don’t “bias the opinions of others” before they vote, but they don’t understand that anyone who votes would have to read through ALL of the results before voting to be biased in any way.... 
---
it’s just ridiculous to think that the polls are passing because people are biased by the majority and not actually voting how they want to vote...

---
Leech 
---
Agreed, change to a white shirt and maybe also change the neck tie, because a strip tie doesn't go well with a striped sweater.
---
These people are ridiculous and I am in agreement with you. The only people biased by seeing poll results are the people that have room temperature IQs.
---
lmao got tangleboy at 71 farming from a willow tree in fally
---
I imagine its a collective decision and that they plan to address the other questions on stream but idk 
---
Should've done that indeed. 
---
Why is the base amount 75 exp?
---
(2-1+(300*(2^((2-1)/7)))))/4 = 83.0567135255 exp
---
It’s almost like we’re human beings and think imperfectly. Lots of people see that a majority of people are going X way so continue to vote that way because they want their vote to matter. Even if the results stayed exactly the same, why would we continue to want a system that could be flawed?? Seeing the results of a poll a week early isn’t as big of a deal as some polls failing because of a flawed system.
---
Isn’t this like 1/10k off task?
---
I don't think he plays rs3, from how the conversation plays out I'd say it's safe to assume he got the pic off of Google
---
Couldn't you free up some inv space by dropping what do you want, dying to zulrah and then picking up your stuff? Theres a guy that will auto pick up your stuff. Only problem is if you die again you will lose your stuff 
---
I dont get it 
---
Have you tried writing them down? Seems crazy right?
---
I have to agree, although this is something that came in Rs2 it was really useful especially if you got muted for swearing too much. 
---
My Herblore level is 94.
---
I may be in the minority here, but i feel like nothing would ever pass if they truly did hide the poll results, so im glad they dont tbh.  They need to add fuckin auth delay tho
---
Where should there have been a comma?
---
B O N D S
---
Thats the best part of linux though.  You don't have to.  With it being open-source you could have a ton of people test and work on it for all distros
---
Yeah, I saw the video after reading the title... no way is this specific to Windows, most DEs have done this in some form for ages.
---
Dunno why all the hate but make sure to not ever post you ign here. You just saved yourself a bunch of time and grinding. And those people bitching dont realize its jagexs LITERAL job to stop sellers and buyers so the fact that you still have your account and people still selling gold means... hah anyways cheers man dont do it too often!!! Enjoy.
---
Yeah pretty much the only reason to go back to fisher realm is for the hard clue steps. 
---
Pretty sure they are RIP anyway as +2 str isn't worth 15 attack levels
---
Wait what ?
---
God I love this track.
---
Lol, I lost my piece of paper that I put all my passwords on, Lol!
---
I just disabled the RuneLite Chrome, but made that exact color for Windows windows(lol). 
---
Works excellent! Also [Start]+[Arrow keys] works perfectly.
---
[Strength of Saradomin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeNRZI3dMiI) is a beautiful track.
---
That's what a few people in the cc said, had no clue it was even a possible drop. Was just running in there to grab the diary completion.
---
Passive, meaning not **actively** wearing the full set to receive the weight reduction and the 30% restore boost
---
I wear dhide mostly, nezz, with various melee switches for Str bonus because I'm a bit sweaty. Occult and torm ofc.
---
Why Fletch?
---
nty
---
The most I've seen someone trade one is 10m and it did not log out. The guy did however lose the bet lol 
---
Fun fact: this works with the vanilla client
---
even if you dont need the doses to actually make staminas you'll drink, they're massively useful for herblore xp. when you factor the herblore xp in, for irons, rooftops are more efficient than werewolf for irons
---
4!= 479001600
---
but I have no idea whats that have to do with HCIM
---
What
---
I liked the vid
---
Always fun having lower ping on American worlds than on Australia ones while living in fucking Queensland 
---
You still have to wear some pieces regardless. I'm suggesting that higher levels require less pieces to be equipped to get the bonus, not for it to flat out become a perma passive if you reach high enough agility.
---
Ahhh... I also dont understand the childhood memory part. Iron men weren't around 10+ years ago
---
I'm well aware. With 16000 I should be able to hit 99 herblore -- won't need more than that
---
Because there's already a graceful rework in the making
---
You could save some time getting the book from diango which teleport just south of champion guild 
---
Have you tried keeping relatively important things safe? It sound impossible but I know you can do it!
---
That already works for me ? 
---
Poor Venezuelans
---
l0l whats my ign?
---
PLEASE. 
---
It's from over a decade ago
---
12$.
---
Our Australian servers are back up to 260-350 ping, again. We literally get better ping on most american worlds, than we do on our own more consistently 
---
&gt; While Twiested Bow's can be bought with real money you can also buy them with in-game currency, therefore they do not count as "proper" mtx.
---
Economics have nothing to do with this lmao just how fucking braindead are you? It's your own thread and you don't even manage to understand it. You're a legit fucking brainlet. 1 nature rune 5 fire runes, get on with it.
---
Ifkr, jagex are dumb cunts 
---
You’re probably right yeah but the bot likely has an algorithm if someone bets too much to simply log off. The bitter then transfers the gold. Making bots like this isn’t hard as there is no skill requirement etc. 
---
Fuck man has he resumed the manga? its been so long since ive seen it ive legit forgot what happened, imma have to rewatch
---
Pretty sure it’s 1/2k on task an 1/10k off task lmao nice drop 
---
Disable custom window chrome in the settings
---
me neither
---
People actually scout accounts and are able to recover them based on getting to know in game details.
---
So you made all that up to scam a scammer into giving you somthing? I’m a bit confused but if that’s so that’s savage loool
---
I am at 35 kc and all my friends are 100+kc we ironmen though. I prefer void, all i bring is elite, rings, fury, anguish book trident blowpipe assembler dboots. I get the raid done and dont die. Clock in same times as those with more swtiches unless they have more than one t bow on their team. Stick to elite v imo
---
Elit3 bser lmao
---
It just means there's 700 more complete fucking morons like you.
---
Yeah google had a database leak a while back. I changed my RSN password like a year ago. My gmail password was never changed. Account was recovered, 2fa cleared, etc, all because of an OLD password

Sometimes you have these microlags in heavily populated areas. Could be that?

Currently trying to get tank legs and chest on my iron. Currently on 50 chests, hoping i wont go as dry :) Gz 
---
They usually lock accounts in case of ownership disputes. They even linked a post about 2 cases of false account theft claims and how they were solved. In both of those the accounts were locked, but not in this case. What is the reason for this?
---
All OP asked for was for them to do as they usually do and lock it for a few days until he can provide more proof.
---
what if they couldnt complete swan song
---
Well duh?
---
Or a tbow spawn that turns to dust/ashes when you pick it up. 
---
Nice acc. Im sure i can sell it for a good priceQ
---
Yesssssss
---
I've passed these comments onto West - he' much appreciates them. I like this point in particular about making areas feel "lived in" - I know he was going for that and agree that he's pulled it off.
---
you've peaked, get ready for hundreds of disappointing clues after this one as you start to realize the average value of an easy clue is a couple thousands
---
1000+ KC no uniques I cri 
---
Yeah don’t quote me but I do believe that’s the case since my iPhone is super smooth all the time. That being said I’ll always play on PC if possible even with 20 FPS lol
---
To his credit it was a scene of Hisoka, who **really** rides the pedophilia line pretty close in that show. 
---
Other than that though Hunter X Hunter is awesome. 
---
Thats true. I didn't realize 95 slayer was the req for the kourend diary. Yikes that ones steep. Better than 91 rc though. Well not really, im fairly positive rc is faster than slayer. 
---
And I see, there is typically 1 higher req in the elite diaries compared to the other steps. So i guess that's on purpose? My post may be confusing then - I just thought that the diaries were meant to be "rounded" or close together as far as the skill gap goes. So it seemed weird for one to consist of a lvl 68 skill, but needing 91 for another task. 
---
And i dont have a problem with elite diaries having such high requirements either. Those are very late game oriented tasks and give some more incentive to training a skill for that long. I wanted to make that clear lol, i think its great theyre adding more late game content for those who have reached the plateau. I just thought they were supposed to be closer together in skill level. 
---
Though I do still find some very odd, like the 65 fishing for a medium. That one should be in the hard diary, and the 44rc one be in the medium. Swap the 2 basically. 
---
That's my bad - the poll quest has been removed from the blog and won't be in the in-game poll on Friday.
---
Yeah this is the only line from the Crab Rave meme I don't like.  
---
r/nocontext
---
The bank pin takes a week to get rid of.
---
So you must have been logged out for that long for them to clean your bank.
---
Will anything happen? No, probably not.
---
Should you stop playing? No, get authenticator, make sure your account is secure and your pc virus free and rebuild! 
---
Yeah I'm not sure how I'd feel about mtx cosmetics in osrs.. They work fine in Dota, but they'd be very out of place in Oldschool.
---
If someone can equip a torture and is doing fremmy trials, I'd guess they are 43 prayer, meaning its a piece of cake anyway
---
They weren't mentioned in the other poll either.
---
Go play RS3 you child.
---
ha! or a small version of one that spawns there, like size of msb
---
Already showing the symptoms of withdrawal I see
---
Pass me the code and I'll pop it on my ubuntu machine and let you know if it works 
---
I'd literally sometimes IRL zoom until my face is like 5cm away from the screen, purely out of boredom.
---
Ten quio = thank you
---
He is typing English as it sounds for him in spanish
---
No. If you own a decent phone, the on time of your display and the brightness have a way bigger effect... on my note 9 there is verry verry little diffrence in like 7 hours of playtime vs 6.5
---
I've just logged in and the bank pin is still there. Maybe I have been away longer I'm not sure.
---
It's just a kick in the teeth having to rebuild 
---
That's not the case... If you wear the full set you get a 30% increase to energy regen. So everyone goes all or nothing with the set. Wearing 1-3 pieces is useless.
---
Shit up serene 
---
How do you move the windows without titlebar/border?

Ty for the free GP

678m payout, rich af

Yes please.

That’d be fun.

Haven't gave anyone my account details tho -.-
---
And the GE scamming begins
---
My first gave me a black kiteshield (g) and black robe (g). It's how they draw you in
---
Out of interest, how would someone else MTXing affect your game?
---
Pay by card
---
But in this example, a lot of the endgame is fashion wars 2
---
Osrs endgame is less fashion orientated I'd say
---
NOBODY gives a fck 
---
So the alt gets banned and your account has its 600m back?
---
Are you talking about urself? 
---
it'd make agility cape's passive pretty much useless in that case
---
Please do it !
---
Act like ya know mee
---
It's worth less than $200 with that fcked up def level
---
I do actually :) 
---
Swamp...
---
Nice bot
---
Also, giant seaweed is the best for tangleroot chance. Gl
---
Stop being a loser
---
Listen man. I didn’t buy the account. I just need to go through my files to find the original information from when I account shared with my clan!
---
Only reason I dont use it
---
its not worth cutting the trees down just pay the gp and get on with something else
---
They aren't *necessarily* scams as they are illegal, by game rules, slot machines. Their odds are always better, in the long run they don't need to scam- the house always wins. 
---
But maybe they do scam once in awhile enough for people to keep coming back; but the more legit they are the more people get hooked and keep coming back
---
Or just go to Waterbirth Island/Fossil Island/Morytania Swamp.
---
There are other places to train.
---
It's to bypass the hydras, that's it. Get over it
---
o i thought u meant locking it behind 'photo identification', sorry, ur wording is very poor
---
For 88 agilty quite a shitty bonus
---
A bot that takes 3 years to get 99 slayer. Nice.
---
It all boils down in how you interpret the original question.  
---
&gt;"are these scams or legit?"
---
I took it to ask if the bots actually pay out.  I fully understand the risks and dishonesty that can happen which I'm sure is a thing here.  The thing is, when these bots are compared to real players who say they double, the bots in question are definitely the more legitimate.  The commenter asked and I gave him a pretty truthful response.
---
So sure I'm an idiot.
---
Why do so many noobs bother to do this, just train while doing slayer
---
Dont forget the bleach for overloads and vodka for absorption 
---
Or perhaps you need to read carefully. My dig was at your insult for ops use of the phrase cutenoob.
---
Have you completed all f2p quests? If not, do then all and I'll give you a bond. 
---
His PR would still be really good for Windows users. I can confirm, it already has windows snapping on Xfce.
---
Amen. I love being able to be f2p in this game with all the members benefits. I paid for 3 months of membership then have been maintaining since easily on bonds. Between slayer, birdhouse runs, herb and limpwurt runs, nmz herbs, zaffs staffs I don't even remotely have to grind to earn my membership as well as increase my bank by a few mil per month. I am very glad bonds are a thing for this reason and I am sure there are thousands of players happy to be able to buy bonds instead of grind out money making methods to get their bis gear. Win-win.
---
Cosmetics, pets, buyable XP lamps to name a few.

mm1 gives either a 30k or 20k xp reward so you don't actually have to grind all the way to 60 before doing it!

Wouldn't you go back to the old situation then?
---
Absolute unit here getting a fury before the neitiznot helm
---
It takes like 13 seconds to cut it down lmao
---
There's two explanations for what's happened:
---
1. Someone has played on your account.
---
2. Since you 'think' the last place you left your character was somewhere around ge, and you found your character at castle wars, chances are in actuality you left your character at castle wars.
---
In any case, put an authenticator on your account to be sure!
---
Excellent cropping skills. 
---
This info is correct, but magic secateur effect doesn't work on seaweed. You also don't need secateurs at all to harvest it.
---
100%, I added a slayer staff to make my routine even more mind numbing. It’s boring compared to other money making pvm bosses but it’s also nice to have a good money making method that you can use to de-stress from skilling or grinding 
---
They are scams. They advertise false odds to win. You have a smaller chance at winning than you think. Player run games of chance are also against the rules and can get you banned for playing also. 
---
I put a fake one in
---
Tell me you lured him out to deep wildy for his rune chainbody after? 
---
I mean as an individual that has no clue how to gain the gp efficiently and just stakes normally sure but there are plenty of people running multiple accounts and even running fucking businesses off of making and selling RS gold. It’s something that can be done on the side of another job even. Saying RS gold has no irl value is a little ignorant but I do see what you are saying and I think it SHOULD be that way but it’s not how it works 
---
Sounds about right.
---
its not delivery its disappointment

More like the fastest cannon based exp/task time. Having 4 people last hit for you would be wonderful.
---
Well considering its the mobile game category and RS3 isn’t out for mobile, I can’t see how that would work
---
They'll have to make a few exceptions if they do. The mager will have to use ancients especially for nylo/crab room. Without ice barrage I don't think that room is possible. The other thing is they need DWH/BGS for Xarpus or I don't think they will be able to dps him in time.
---
Also Verzik is going to be a bit rough, but with those two exceptions I think it would be do-able for a team. I would expect some team wipes though if damage rng got really bad at the wrong time like late nylo/crab room.
---
Anime is for degenerates, not kids. Kinda like how bronys are a thing.
---
C'mon we all know the type of Micro's we are talking about here. The day anything more than bonds come that's it. 
---
&gt;They are scams. They advertise false odds to win. You have a smaller chance at winning than you think. Player run games of chance are also against the rules and can get you banned for playing also. 
---
As I said after the first 4 words
---
&gt;They aren't *necessarily* scams as they are illegal, by game rules, slot machines (with undetermined, nonpublic odds, illegal in the real worls sense). Their odds are always better, in the long run they don't need to scam- the house always wins.

I've never entered my osrs details into anything other than the osrs website to sign into account or the Runelite app. The only thing I've entered the pin into is the Runelite app too

It will be fun to se what they come up with. I have personally not done ToB but fell like there is no point in doing a morytania uim if you are getting carried. But have seen swampletics in unrestricted worlds so maybe he is trying to figure something out
---
There's a lot of reasons one could want to use the minigame teleport to castle wars, slayer being one of them.

check for twisted bow spawns too just in case

Rs3 bad give up points

A lot of Linux DE's like Xfce, i3, etc already support window snapping.

what about gnome :-) lol

Like Patrick with his rock, “It’s ok Settled, you release a video whenever you feel like it.”

He's saying that RS3 has microtransactions, you dong.

if you're not cannoning why would you ever do lighthouse over catacombs? It's literally the same monsters except you can get totems and arclight shards.

I like your item: Monkey Nuts 
---
They do. I remember a few years ago jagex mods used to comment everywhere, and more recently in that video that had zezimas chin shown i forget what it is called, the jmods admit theyre always on reddit and they see everything we say. One jmod wanted to roast the community but couldnt because its too colourful aka career suicide if he did
---
how would the 2nd target be decided?

but more importantly range is already by far the best combat style and has powerful aoe weapons, it doesnt need a buff

You still can if it's within 24 hours.

Yes.

Yes, so does NBA 2k19. Why didnt he tell him to go and play that? The ridiculous comment implied that OSRS with mtx would be the equivalent of playing RS3, which it isn’t.

This update isn't meant to be a rework for the Tithe farm, but we know it's something that's wanted. We're having discussions into how we can improve the Tithe in the future - we know that constantly right-click doesn't make for good gameplay, for instance.

Most people love to whine and complain. It feels good to express frustration. Especially when there are dozens/hundreds of other people who kind of agree with some of what you think and upvote your comment, making you feel like you have both a message and a voice. I believe that's why LIKE/DISLIKE internet culture eventually polarizes every discussion of every issue.

Should I house tab in between every kill to double spec each time?

But what about the OP pking plugins

Its very simple. Dont mention 1 def in the polls and shit doesnt have a problem passing. The majority of the community are brainlets and dont care negatively about anything so they vote yes unless jagex mentioned something they dont like in the question.

I agree that it may be impossible to work out ToB without ice spells. From my understanding the goal is to complete it without. Maybe snare the crabs (as ridiculous as that seems). If they do manage it somehow I’d expect plenty of wipes beforehand.

seems like a good tool. i use runelite on my 2nd monitor when im doing something afk but when 2nd monitors have a taskbar, runelite fullscreens to the primary screen size (1920x1080) while on a monitor that is like (1024x1080) so i always have to manually size it. good qol tool
---
bro its your birthday and you're sat clicking a knight in ardy to get a skill to 99 which every other man has 
---
Yes! Motherfucking yes! Why the shit is this disabled by default?
---
Gets every drop at 1 kc
---
16 def bonus on a pure decreases the chance they get hit from 99.9% to 99.87% so its pretty much true. 
---
A man of culture, that is what he is.
---
That would probably require a lot of work. I don't usually buy the "but engine work" excuse, but this would be a giant project.
---
They would need to hook in a completely new control scheme, stop bosses from following their normal scripted boss fight, and probably tweak several animations when using it in a way it wasn't intended breaks them. 
---
Hmmm, idk. Looks too easy...
---
Absolutely...
---
I mean I did say I thought it was a bit far but whatever. Also it absolutely doesn't require a tbow. A decent set up can be acquired with 200m and given this is an *elite* diary, that really doesnt seem far fetched. A lot more than 200 people have the cape

At higher level you dont need another acct to pk, but at low lvl nearly every1 in PvP made their acct to be as powerful as possible for their lvl, you can pk on nearly any acct(especially if you use a gmaul), but learning to pk on at a disadvantage is very tough, you can make a low lvl f2p pure in a few hours(in members), 50 range 30 att 45 str and 1 pray and def.  Personally, I hate f2p and I would quickly turn it into a gmauler 50att 60-70 str 70-80 range is reccomenned but you need at least 60, its easiest to learn on 1 pray accts and 1def is best until mid 80 combat range
---
Msb to gmaul is great combo at nearly every lvl
---
Perks for skillcapes were a good addition because, for the most part, 99 doesn’t award anything (substantial) in a lot of skills. So as an extension to a skill and not understating the achievement of getting a 99 in the first place, I agree that it is good content. 
---
Within that though, and maybe it should be this way, some benefits outweigh others. For example, herblore is underwhelming given its cost, cooking simply liberates the gauntlets which is a bit niche and woodcutting is also a pretty flimsy benefit on its own. 
---
Lastly, some skillcapes come with teleports and others do not. I think it’s reasonable for the master of a skill to teleport to their guild. 
---
I know it’s been contested a lot. I’m interested in hearing the latest sentiment.  
---
What?
---
I think you can afford another 420 xp.
---
Forgot to black out runenergy bye bye account!
---
True but you can pray one of those two, guess the other might be a problem but with another player you shouldn't be in toooo much danger.
---
Better 
---
OP name tho
---
And even if you do, you're punished by spending more on teleport runes than a low level would spend on food.
---
unplayable

eh
---
I'm not angry at all, you just dont have a sense of humor lol.

&gt;promised

You don't know how promises work in this game clearly lol. They'll come or they won't, no date will ever be given and even if one is given it doesn't actually mean anything.

Alright I get your point I did word it wrong I ment it as in changing ISP not just upgrading your existing plans

How can windowsbois even compete
---
My now wife actually said this to me a long time ago (in approx 2012) just before EoC came out, while clanning was still very prominent.
---
I actually quit clanning and mostly quit the game as changes such as hp to constitution came in. Then EoC landed and I quit for good.
---
And then OSRS came out...  :-)

... letics, my Morytania locked Ultimate Ironman. After recently maxing my Ultimate Ironman I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch. No banking, no trading, but this time I can't leave Morytania. All leading up to eventually taking on one of Runescapes biggest challenges, the Theatre of Blood.
---
Bro, that's what Pick &amp; Shovel is for.
---
I just want to make sure you're aware that things ARE repolled from time to time to see if opinion has changed. the recent Divine Spirit Shield poll was the third time we've seen it, for example.
---
It's not like saying "hey maybe we feel differently about this now" is some gigantic unprecedented leap of faith meant to invalidate previous votes. It's a reasonable occurrence meant to suit the game to the current population rather than taking whatever the community of X years ago thought was good and making it a gold standard that can never be questioned or changed.
---
Given how vocal the community seems to be(though you could speciously it's a minority) this issue in particular is more than deserving of a repoll.
---
&gt; He literally just loves fighting strong people. So its not a pedo thing, more of just a boner for strong fighters that Hisoka deems worthy enough to fight lol. 
---
I understand this because I've seen the show and talked to friends who have also seen it, but you should also understand that people who do not watch would think this way lol. I definitely understand why it would be fucking weird. 
---
Its the lighting bro
---
Foot pedal, fine. Using a fan for the footpedal, not fine. I footpedal'd the shit out of ardy knights before the nerf lol. 
---
Automating it with a machine, even a physical one, is liable to get you banned cuz their speeds are so uniform compared to a human's clicks. 
---
They're probably afraid of hackers taking accounts and implementing this.
---
I know just like winter 2017
---
cooking does much more than liberate the gauntlets. gauntlets only impact about 6 fish, and some fish never stop failing at 99 without the cape perk. cape perk makes you never burn anything
---
getting 99 (or post 99) in a skill should just be personal satisfaction, its silly to attach perks and incredibly useful to them. It incentivizes people who have no interest in the skills to do them, who in turn ask for things to be changed or made easier, drives up costs and can ruin the skill for people who enjoyed it how it was
---
I feel like he will have to tone it back from one video a week as his account grows. With a limitation like that the grinds are incredibly long, I just can't see him having enough content for a video each week later on. Has he addressed this anywhere?
---
Yes please I’ve been wondering why this wasn’t already an option!
---
There seems to be no bank for quite a distance from Saltpetre. Can we get a deposit box in that location?
---
They catch all botters, but since it takes a bit for them to get caught there are quite a bit doing very low lvl stuff in f2p

OP didn't complain that this is a jagex issue.

It is already Wednesday, 11:17 PM for me as I type this message. Now I have to wait until A FRIDAY! When I work all weekend!

But in reality, I'm glad he said something about it instead of just ghosting the episode for a day. Hopefully he's happy with the product he ends up putting out, I'm sure it'll be just as enjoyable.

I'll keep an eye out for your "Runelite hacked me" or "Jagex give me my account back!" Post.

ToG is a short minigame you can do after you finish the quest "Tears of Guthix" (I know, such a surprise!) where you can go in and collect tears (the blue ones) from dripping walls in a cave and you get exp in your lowest skill based on how many you collect in a short time period.

"their databases to be breached"  You have no idea what you're talking about.  When someone says a database is breached it means off some random fansite like Zybez where people used to sell shit before the GE.
---
For example, Billy is a retard.  Billy's email password is donut12.  Billy uses the password donut12 on a lot of things.  Including shitty Runescapes fansites that he logs into with the same email and donut12 password.  Eventually, probably long after Billy stops using that fansite, but still uses that same Donut12 password on his email the shitty fansite that never had good security to begin with has a list (a database) of passwords and accompanying emails among possible other things leaked.  Billy has no idea this happened because he hasn't even visited this site in a few years.  But some hacker can look through a list like this, see this email and password associated with a runescape fansite and use bots to attempt to login into the email and runescape account if the password is the same.  Since Billy is a retard, his password is still the same.

It is beneficial in a way that allows the community access to a system which allows people to keep on playing as F2P. Yes, some people will abuse bonds and buy gp with them, but it is very expensive to do so and while doing so they themself are driving the price even higher. Which benefits people who dont buy bonds to get gp.
---
Idk, Fortnite has slowed down dramatically in popularity thanks to Apex, and OSRS mobile gets more players each day. Worth a shot to vote for osrs at least.

You not getting hacked doesn't mean other aren't getting hacked.

Despite the hate I’m getting, I’d like to come out and say first and foremost;

I’ve only been playing as an Ironman for about 2 months.
---
I’m building a;
---
1 Attack, 1 Strength, 75 Defense, 75 Ranged, 86 Magic, 52 Prayer, 80 HP Ranged/Magic bossing Tank, and in all my training not a single IM has crashed me and some have even hopped for me, so when you say that IM don’t give af, I haven’t seen that yet.
---
But then again I could see how high level IM would just not care about lower level players the same way non IM are, but that’s just the player base in general, YOU CANNOT specify that claim to just IM because that would just be factually incorrect. Your preaching that only IM will out chop you at trees, outmine you at gold or gem rocks, out trap you at hunter, and out DPS you for drops is just scaring players from the game and starting them with an unfair bias against IM and it’s sickening.
---
This is amazing 
---
They don't, this is just the new popular thing to hate.
---
pmods are gay anyways
---
Oh, haha. Well, I was thinking about it and what if they Dorgeshuun take all the bones we bury and then repurpose them into bone weapons. If i'm right, they are a peaceful group so they wouldn't kill people/things for their bones

I don’t believe people play with in game music on and if they do it’s supposed to be ironic
---
When TOB first came out I did 25 kc before anyone realized that ice barrage would stop the crabs from attacking. We'd lose a pillar or two most raids, but it wouldn't kill us or stop us from wiping. It's definitely possible given that I've done it many times.

Yo you used to be maybe a YouTuber or something back in like 2010?

While I was making the map and getting reference shots of Darkmeyer, I got ideas for what the city could potentially offer. This ranged from simple things like a second mushroom patch, to more complex additions such as a POH and clothing store for Vyrelord/Vyrelady clothing. I mostly just played around with what could be interesting for the area really.
---
As for why these shops would exist, well I imagine there would still be some sort of Vampyre hierarchy within Darkmeyer. In RS3, the city was seperated into different tiers, which I took heavy inspiration from. The services offered in the higher tier are mostly novelties royalty can enjoy, such as Jewelery and clothing. While the tier below has more base essentials for those products, like silk and gems.
---
YES PLEASE I'VE WANTED THIS FOR SO LONG!!!!!

Actually used to do this just so they would log in, I'd force them off the account by logging in to RS3 where it would show me their IP address since they were the last one online, then just drop their IP off on the hack forum and let everyone there go to town. :D
---
Meet Cluethetics, he decided to up the ante by creating a clue only account...
---
Runs fine but FPS is shit. 
---
I feel like he does a really good job at creating narratives within his account that are far more interesting than they should be, but I do agree it will be difficult to keep this level of content running steady as he gets further into the endgame. Im still looking forward to it though! 
---
Why stop there? Just rewatch the entire series on an endless loop

Damn, you're right. I also forgot the second GE too, so now it will remain empty forever.

Well I mean if the shoe fits huh mate?

You simply don’t know toxic if you think that the rs community is toxic. Simple as that. Quit rs for a few months and play some league in low gold and try to climb to plat elo for me. Go play some eve and try to build up your own ship. Then you’ll see true toxicity. Then maybe you’ll open your eyes to how ludicrous you’re being.

Is there any risk to not being able to get your email back for a month though if someone else got it or the company went under?  I think old University emails are even better.  They usually get locked after 6 months of no password change  and you have to call IT to get them to reset it.
---
Microtransactions. Say you don't feel like training Runecraft as much today. No problem, pay 5 dollsrs and get a few keys that open chests that may give you a lamp for free experience without training.

There will be a lot of joking off going on

I didn't realize that my division managers were also involved in the OSRS community.

He wants to eventually start streaming though so he doesn't want to be far ahead of where his videos are

Thanks! Lastpass is a great choice. Also, good point as password managers should have 2FA as well.

I agree. Remove MTX from RS3!

Not at all. I'm just saying to get a cheap domain registered for a few years. For example get a .com or something from GoDaddy like thaggles.com and buy an Office 365 account for a month for $5. Make like thaggles@thaggles.com to make the account and verify the email. Then turn it off of auto renew and delete the email account. If you ever need to access the email for a password reset or anything just buy the plan and recreate the email account.

Tbh RWT basically is MTX. We've all seen a credit card warrior or two in game over the years.

The $11 we pay a month should cover that cost.

I don't understand why so many on this sub are complacent with Jagex' greed.
---
It’s not worth it.
---
:^)
---
well not every spider is female so it would make sense it's an uncommon drop
---
You are probably right, but you can't deny that official MTX would significantly nerf gold farming companies which I think would be an attractive prospect for Jagex...
---
Maybe I should delete this comment.

He appeals to mods. Mods say "we can confirm that this system did indeed ban you for botting", then gets 3x gilded and labelled as a smack down.

Bonds probably cost Jagex half their income, its ridiculously easy for players to make 3m in a MONTH (you can make it in an hour with bossing) so less people are paying $11 for membership
---
And the principle of the matter. They say they're going to send you something you've earned...they should probably do it.

i was speaking in the context of what your acc would be worth if someone tried to sell it. That def level lowers the value of your acc in the black market. Other than that nothing wrong with it.

Welcome to reddit dot com
---
Again. You know nothing about PK.
---
You seem to think there only exists one form of pure, and one bracket of pure. You are so damn wrong aswell..
---
We start off with f2p pking accounts, 40 attack, either 1 def, 20 def or 40 def, then mains then maxed mains.
---
Then over in members there are so many different builds. The lowest tend to be ~ lvl 30? This is when you begin to see 10hp dbow rushers, low level obby accounts, and low level def tanks.
---
Lvl 40s, tend to be baby pures, barely lvl 60 combat stats, usually people pk with mage this low cb
---
Lvl 50s, baby msb + gmaulers, obbys, tanks, fire surge pures 
---

---
But a month of income for thousands of hours of grinding? Not even remotely worth imo
---
All that does is make it even more pathetic that they haven't handled it yet
---
It’s the opinions of players that actually spent hundreds to thousands of hours in order to pk on specific account builds? Would you rather base it off of the players that didn’t make any pures and only go into the wilderness to pvm or complete a clue step? Whose opinions do you think hold more merit in a discussion about pures? 
---
Oversimplification leads to misinformation. Should have picked a better example. 
---
You are right. The game was made with no specific account in mind. But to ignore the popularity that pures/minmax accounts brought when the game was at its peak of 200-250k players is asinine. 
---
And yet we have sandstone coming into the game now? Tell me how many mains that are gunna use that update...

You can't make a claim about the difficulty of anything without knowledge... You know any of the challenges they faced building the app? You know any of the challenged they faced making the game interface correctly with the app? You know how much money they spent on any of this? 
---
I have a strange feeling the answer to all of these are no. How about you lighten the fuck up and appreciate what they've given us? The fact that we even have oldschool is a fucking miracle on its own.
---
Been doing this, way easier for me to do it than mlm. Thanks! 
---
It sounds like the real problem is your loneliness. 
---
I agree with you. On a pvp trip you use up a full inv of food, pots, arrows and runes within a minute. The same inventory would last an hour or pvming..
---
Pkers burn through the supplies that skillers sell. Pkers keep the economy going. And keep demand strong foe gear, food, weapons, runes, potions
---
How’s it feel to be a reddit clone just parroting what everyone else says? Must be a relief not having to think :)

Can a Jagex mod at least come in here, pretend to give a shit, and give a canned PR response at least?

How hard is it to just use the calculator? Do people really want Runelite to do fucking everything?

First of all, I know it’s stupid of me to ignore my email about the request of my authenticator being disabled, I ignored it because I thought it’d be fine since I also have 2FA on my email. I have tried to log in the account but it has Ben disabled, I have tried contacting Jagex but haven’t heard of anything from them. Is there anything else I can do?
---
There’s a character customization option for bigger arms. 
---
Account Recovery will still bypass all of this.

They're still here, they just wear robes and cast magic in the fight caves

We had to switch worlds because we had some trolls, but it ended up working out great. POH seems like it will be a good way to prevent that though.

There's a major difference in how it impacts game integrity when it's an official service provided by Jagex instead of a black market that is strictly disallowed.

On the Dramen staff questions, could you also change the way it works with Iban Staff so when you change back and forth between Iban and other staff the preferably spell would be iban blast?
---
Now if you're using iban staff with iban blast then change to dramen for example then change back to iban you would use the best normal attack spell available with iban instead of the unique spell.
---
That should also change with similar staffs like slayer staff.

Its in arabic and is read like this : *Bismillahi rahmani rahim* which means  "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" recited by muslims before each chapter of the Quran.

I would be strongly against that. I played RS3 over double xp weekend and honestly the worst part of it all was all the cosmetic bullshit EVERYONE had. they were all floating in the air with a giant dragon looking things behind them and you couldn't tell what they were actually wielding because of overrides. Also it would just be a step in the direction of more MTX

The retards that repost this constantly care more about imaginary internet points than the health of the game.

MMK has stated **several** times that there are no plans for MTX, and I *think* has the largest "voice" when it comes to the future of OSRS as its project manager.

I definitely agree with variety, I find if I just mindlessly skill, then I don't really want to play and I end up disappearing again. So I think I might try mixing it up between quests, diaries and some skilling for requirements. :)

I providee useful information for securing accounts. Youre on here fear mongering and claiming everyone ia doomed. You can't provide any proof of your claims. I work in enterprise envrinoments where password managers, MFA, etc is industry standard. If its good enough for Banks to use to secure your assets its good enough for your runescape account. Also would be happy to provide proof of my position to mods should this need that for some reason. I can't argue with you cause it wont do any good.

Make money on rs3 and buy bonds then.

I suppose so, though since stats do drain once a minute and fights can last longer than that, it's definitely optimal to have more strength bonus.  Even more so for regular training, where the boost will naturally degrade before being reapplied.

This is no excuse for jagex to not do this with their own game, but can’t you add two step authentication to email addresses?

um.. artist.. you seemed to have left clothes on her..

You do it early on for cheap for starting supplies or later on at a higher costs with higher rewards. Pretty balanced imo. &amp; this way skillers can do it.

I turn it on every so often, as well as turn on the game sounds. The in game music is actually good and it fuels my nostalgia. I just have to turn it off for tracks like Trade Parade, Country Jig, and Pick and Shovel. And I forget to turn it back on.

And your blowpipe has adamant bolts or better? Using ranging potions and eagle eye as well?

Yeah bonds seem like a good bet. Can just do dailies like kingdom on the main and maybe afk fish or cannonballs.

Ironman. Also I keep finding cash sinks for all my money (rune pick, arrows to raise ranging then bone bolts, runes, rune plate and legs, etc.). Also I kind of missed the window on wintertodt so I didn’t get that big cash influx in the early game. Money is a lot easier to get at this point since I can high alch but it would still prob take me 4-5 hours to get 100k

You literally have no idea what you are talking about. You still have no idea what the Account Recovery process is. Until you have done even the basic research into the topic, you have no business posting on this at all.

I find this very interesting and I look forward to see how, and if you catch up; also what you plan to do after you catch up in comparison to Settled. One question though: Do you plan to upload more than one video a week in this series (considering you’re going to be playing catch-up) or will you release once a week with a slightly longer video duration?

No problem man

I can guarantee I am much more versed on the subject of security than you are. A major city will have a few ISPs and some ISPs share infrastructure. So claiming one can recover an account by knowing which ISP you use it completely false. What if that user were to use a VPN? Traffic could show as Denmark, Madagascar, China, and have no relevancy to that account. If you have any shred of information you could share with us on how Jagex uses their account recovery criteria I urge you to post it because I am genuinely curious.
---
Full rune, power amulet, dhide vamps, rscim/r2h?
---
Yes, but no. Normal the NPC just gets teleported to its spawn. I've never seen an NPC no clip to get out of a trap, perhaps this one's spawn tile was right next to where it was trapped so it just walked to its spawn tile instead of teleporting
---
Yep. I do decent damage. Is Vorkath doable with god d'hide? It has better ranged defence, maybe I wont take as much damage then? Or maybe I just need to train ranged up a little more.

After grinding out eclectic implings for medium clue scrolls, and never getting one worth more than 10k, I started grinding woodcutting. Got an easy clue scroll from a bird nest. Worth 80k. An accidentaly easy scroll was worth 8x every single medium scroll I got from like 500 eclecic implings.

Which darts? As far as I'm aware most people use addy since rune is only +4 more ranged and 4x the cost.

The staff gives like a +10 crush +10 str bonus. Thus your dps is higher and it also allows for a higher max hit.

Broad bolts? No. Diamond bolts my dude. Also going to be really hard with 80 range. I'd shoot for 90.

What's the point in creating a separate email for an existing runescape account though? I was going to do this, assuming it would mean an entirely new login that no one would know, but it isn't. For me, it says changing the email only changes your communication preferences but the login email stays as the original email you made your account with :(

I feel like they should only hide poll results until you've already voted. After you've voted, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to look at the current status of the polls.

How many times are people going to post the same thing expecting something to change?
---
These bots are usually level 3 bots, and since making an account takes a minute you won't see them go away. Hell, if these bots exist that means they are making enough profit to cover the cost of a bond for a new bot when it gets banned and whatever GP they need to dress it up in clue scroll clothing items.
---
The thing that gets me is that people think that more PMods will do anything at all with how fast these are created, you'd have to have a guy standing there 24/7 to be anything close to effective.
---
Let me remind you that we are playing an old-ass version of a game with old-ass detection systems that only ban you in waves and once you have botted enough to be detected. This is a problem that requires a more modernized approach to detection, unfortunately banning bots means less revenue for them. Bots keep bond prices high because they increase they demand everytime they get banned, meaning that more people will choose to spend $11 over losing 4M on a new bond.

Hey, thanks for the question! The main reason for having a separate email is, odds are your primary email is used for a lot of other services (examples could be: spotify, facebook, etc) If one of those websites had a security breach and all of their users passwords and information were leaked someone could login to your runescape account. Having separate emails ensures that if that main email gets compromised they don't also immediately get access to your runescape account because it's on a different email address. Hopefully this makes sense
---
**Set Crystal weapons to 65 atk/ Ranged requirement paired with 70 agility.** 
---
**We currently have too many weapons at 70 &amp; 75 there is no reason to dump more.** 
---
**My idea for a Crystal Sword special attack damage could scale off your current strength bonus + agility level. This would give more incentive for players to train agility which could have use in pvp**
---
Would Jagex mute a player for this if they were reported? Or is this behavior deemed "fine".
---
I've seen some crazy stuff in OSRS, but back in 2006 I used to get muted for saying "lmfao".

Oooh! Piece of candy!

That's just the price the Devs set it at on release. The actual sell/buy prices was much different (as with all newly released items). Since the GE has a limit on how much it can update the price, it takes a while for the GE price to reflect the actual price. Usually by then, enough of the item is in the game that it stabilizes at a price much lower than that of release. Also, there's a lot of scams based on the fact that the GE price is not always accurate so watch out for that.
---
Which poll results are released tomorrow? If any?
---
yeah i've recovered my account before.  It's good to do to know you can do it when/if it ever gets stolen.
---
If you filled out the form with as much correct info as you can come up with and it's getting denied then you are either mistaken about certain things being correct or you've recovered your account before and your current appeal is far weaker.

The names of the accounts suggest they are made specifically for this rng game though. If you look up their accounts it looks like someone leveled their stats a big but they are never anything impressive. Their names are always "RNG &lt;insert number here&gt;"

Because 75 range is humorously easy to get. You shouldn't be able to get a nearly BiS range item that quickly. I'll grant you the difference between 75 and 85 for most rangers is just the cost of 20k cannonballs, but still.

The amount of pull we have is already vastly greater than almost every other game out there, which is why so many of us play osrs. The guy above you says it perfectly. All this fuss about hiding poll results is implying the *entire* osrs community are brain-dead sheeple who are incapable of making their own decisions, and will just vote for the majority every single time.

*Pushed as far as I can go**

No, no dear. This IS the ride.

Don't spoil it

Friendly reminder that questions which have failed have been repolled. Jagex ignored hiding poll results as a re-run in their most recent re-run poll in February: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/apgnxz/comment/eg83wqp?st=JT7KKT79&amp;sh=11218cee

I mean there are literally studies that were done for stuff like this that have proved the scenario. You're right that it's dumb but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You can't just ignore the facts or you look just as dumb as the people not voting.
---
Claiming that it's the communities fault that polls aren't hidden is pretty asinine considering the majority of players wanted them hidden in that poll but jagex is ridiculous and requires a 75% majority to pass

Why are you even commenting if you have nothing to say? Are you that bored

I believe in God so your assumptions are misplaced. I  thought it was funny because it was really random. I never spoke to this guy before and he started preaching to me in a video game, a kid's video game

it will still have the med dairy bonus, most people will still train in ardy until ardy hard which is behind a 65 rc check so I dont think you need to worry about that

You can probably forget your "regular or normal" farming patches if you plan to keep yourself fairly busy with other stuff in-game. They will help with some xp if you're trying to get as much xp as you can but they will become tedious. Plant trees and fruit trees. Trees can typically be checked and planted about twice a day I believe. Fruit trees can be checked and planted about once a day. It will vary depending on what time of the day you plant. For trees, I do falador, lumbridge, varrock, and gnome stronghold. For fruit trees I do gnome stronghold, tree gnome village, brimhaven, and catherby. These locations are easy and quick to get to without much requirements. I might recommend that instead of doing atollment, flower, and herb runs. You can herb run when you can plant profitable herbs, but that will mainly be for profit and not really for XP - think of the xp as bonus instead. This will free up the whole day for you to really focus on other things while leveling up farming fairly quick. I went from 50-60 in like 2 days (I might be exaggerating a little by a day or two lol but it was quick) when I began cutting out atollment and flower runs and running just trees and fruit trees.
---
Holy crap, Nieve with a normal human body. Quality contribution.
---
There are only about 40,000 people voting in each poll, so even a few bot farms of a few dozen to a hundred bots each could cause a difference for close votes. Plus, it's known that being able to see the effect you have encourages greater degrees of vote manipulation. That's why Reddit implemented the "fuzzy upvote" feature where vote counts are not shown exactly to discourage upvote hacking (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/10xoka/what_does_vote_fuzzing_do_anyways_all_it_seems_to/)
---
Furthermore, early votes have a strong effect on the outcome of a vote, which is why very new posts on Reddit have "score hidden". You might personally remember a time when you might not have upvoted or downvoted a comment because it didn't polarize you substantially, but seeing the vast swing in either direction tipped you towards acting. This "traction" effect is bad for polls.

Didnt jed steal recovery info, allowing hackers to recover accounts? Its unlikely pins are stored as plaintext within the jagex database anyway, same as paswords theyre probably hashed. 
---
Vorkath is an easy 3m/hour with good gear, zulrah is a very difficult 2-3.5m/hr. It depends on how focused you are and of course your gear and stats
---
Been there. You'll end up getting 2 in one task or none at all. 6 in 3k here.
---
Now this is gone viral am sure they will pay attention
---
Thanks for the advice everyone. Gonna start planting trees and fruit trees. Fuck strawberries
---
Depends a whole lot on scale prices. They're about even if scales are around 230. zulrah is better if scales are higher and worse if scales are lower.

Sorry. Dont deserve. My acc is still unfairly banned

I'm usually in favour of pking updates but this isn't about taking something away for pures or other pkers, it's about fixing what tier it should be in. These items are way stronger than anything in the tier below it (t70) which imo mean they should raise it to at least tier 80.

&gt;Why shouldn't someone with 75 range not be able to use the blowpipe if they can afford it?

---
It can be worth a try, I did it to a few and while they didn't follow me all the way to the wizards, they stopped moving, stopped spamming their messages and eventually logged out presumably due to being afk
---
That's not what I am saying. What is "worthwhile" and what is "pointless" should be determined through a lot of thinking and debate. Dismissing everything as "both sides are stupid whiners!" is classic rhetoric.
---
how do you get more into farming? i'm level 79 and can't be bothered to leave where i currently am in game to go on a farm run. also, its expensive! my herb runs really only pay for themselves, using ranarrs or snaps and ultracompost on 7 patches. papaya trees and a calquat once a day + herb runs seems like its a drag to train in later levels if you want to do it cheaply.

please help me see the light.

This type of shit is why I don't think some low level who found a Tbow, grabbed it, and dipped shouldn't be banned for bug abuse. People fuck up with this stuff, it happens.
---
A tier is not a requirement. This isn't any other MMO. D claws is stronger than ags in most cases, should it be raised to 75? Why does it matter what requirement it is, nobody but specific build accounts would get affected.

I think the people that wish for the results to be hidden are already the people who already understand what is good and bad for the game, and vote with those thoughts in mind. What people are worried about in terms of seeing voting numbers are the less experienced people who see “passing - 77%” and they vote yes just because it’s passing with a majority, when in reality, that small amount of people who voted yes just because they saw the numbers could have swayed the vote to a passing number, when in the first place it maybe wouldn’t have been, especially if it’s close to 75%. They’ve done some things to restrict the voting system to somewhat experienced players but it’s the wrong solution imo. It would be like making the voting requirements 40 years old with 15 years of work experience. New players (or young people in this analogy) should have the opportunity to vote on issues that will influence their game too.
---
TLDR: a plugin won’t help because the people who’d use it already vote without the numbers influencing their decision. 
---
Presentation is why this series is so good. Only region locked ironman I enjoy because of it.

Lol! Much effort, at first at was like meh wtf probably fake and then i started discovering all the thingies!

That sounds like a scuffed version of entrapment

Bro your seriously retarded arent you, I would get the xp from 90% of the kills and half the xp from the few they last hit.

Oh I completely agree with the idea of it! It makes sense to me, but I'm just betting that people will still bitch about polls being rigged despite that. Never underestimate weaponized autism.

No, his name isn't mentioned in the fairy tales quest guide, or the fairy rings page on the wiki. His own page doesn't mention anything about it either, but I guess I could give it a try.
---
Jesus that's brutal.  I remember one time I was afking ourania RC and suddenly noticed that I couldn't teleport or something, I guess because I happened to not get all the needed runes that time.  And I was like what the fuck where is my earth staff.  Checked equipment and I had nothing on, and was briefly terrified that I'd somehow died and not noticed (nor kept anything... didn't exactly think it through in that moment) and that my full graceful was gone.  Truly a horrifying thought, 50 hours of agility flashed across my mind before I realized that I was retarded and must've just hit the bank all equipment button on accident at some point.
---
that's not the case
---
I don’t remember their name tbh. I just thought I remembered someone having to give a brief rundown of the rings before you used them, an npc within 15 ft of the ring in zanaris 
---
If somebody is competent enough to run a bot farm, they are competent enough to change the script so next time they bank they vote. Or at least pay somebody else to do it.
---
TIL :D

this post is obvious from BIG HERBA, they out here tryna' get them p++ bullshit in our systems!
---
How often do you fat finger on mobile
---
I totally agree with that second part. However hiding poll results are not going to solve that problem. 
---
Once the owner of the bots votes on his main, its not like he doesn't know the results of the polls on all his other accounts lol. its still the same person. People act like hiding the polls is going to make a major difference, however I believe it will only ever make a small dent. 
---
Streamers will always vote on stream, showing the results to potentially thousands of people, which will eventually branch out to a thousand others by word of mouth. There will surely be reddit posts about the results asking people to vote which way, and depending on the importance of the poll I wouldn't be surprised if there were "advertising" bots like they have for house portals, that will display a somewhat current result in order to sway the vote.

There’s also ones for Remote Desktop

Isn't always true, I've personally dumped some money into random ones at teh GE whenever I'm banking, usually 500k-1m bets and I'm up money overall rn, usually by losing a 250k or two then yoloing the 750k-1m bet and winning. Certainly have won on the second game before, after losing the first.

YEAH just got it! It was my 7th or 8th attempt, lost count! Couple attempts I screwed up in stupid mistakes like forgetting to put scales into blowpipe and other stuff. Once I thought Jad will spawn where the orange 360 is, but I think it had walked a bit, and so Jad was further and I didn't see him and got killed right away. This time I had dragon darts for Jad and was praying Steel Skin and Eagle Eye. I managed to aggro all healers and even though 2 of them were adjacent to me (able to hit me and heal Jad) I didn't even take damage almost at all, and at that point things were so stable I felt calm, like for the first time at the healer phase I actually could see what I was doing and didn't panic! He was down really fast, and now I'm really happy. 
---
It literally doesn't matter because frankly it isn't happening at the scale you seem to think it is. Virtually no one does this, and it won't change results.
---
Not to mention we should be looking for the easiest solution to the problem, and the easiest solution is for those people to just vote. Nothing is physically preventing them from voting, so they should vote if they want their voice to be heard. It's illogical to make a huge change for a small group of people when there is in actuality nothing preventing them from voting.
---
wtf is this shit lol

But.. But.. What about the meme? What about the crabs?

It's a joke where people thought that in order to be eligible to receive draconic visages as a drop, players must speak to Oziach first.

Lol, just 2 months ago everyone was bitching how literally everything always passes because of new players and that the system needed reformed.
---
Took like a few weeks until nearly like 1/3rd of a poll failed and I haven't heard shit from those people since.
---
I feel like the people who jump on the bandwagon and bitch about this type of stuff are EXACTLY the type of people that just copy the poll results and are the sheeple they bitch about. Either that or they're just insufferable fuckwads that bitch about anything and everything and should probably just uninstall for the health of the community.

Yes, I hope to have the next one be GMT friendly.

Nah, 70 agility and graceful makes early questing so much better. If its their first account though they'd probably try much sooner, young me certainly wanted the Crystal bow with minimum skilling required.

---
Of course it can, but most people (I can't think of anyone?) would not look up the poll results to vote in the majority, they vote for the majority due to the subconscious bias induced by the results being in their face while they make the decision. If you go out of your way to find the results outside the game and vote based off the majority, you're an idiot and shouldn't even be allowed to vote lol. 
---
Well i love dag tasks :)
---
You can honestly make do with zammy hasta instead of lance, barrows or bandos instead of justicar, helm of neitznot. Everything else kinda gotta stay the same. Guess you can do barrows gloves instead of ferocious but thats just a whole other quest chain you gotta do and time is money when it comes to an alt
---
Gotcha. Im not too familiar with melee bosses. Maybe giant mole? 
---
Whats your slayer level?
---
I enjoy playing the finer parts of the game. I don't enjoy the grinding. I don't see anything wrong with how I choose to play the game. I'm just explaining how my method is far less sweaty and "degenerate" than grinding normally. 
---
$2500 at any time? Lot of folks aren't that fortunate. Many are, but life happens. 
---
Sure we can confirm our vote was counted under the current system but if we are going to go all conspiracy theory whats stopping Jagex from spoofing votes in the current system.
---
Either dont trust them or dont trust them but use the same mentality for both.
---
You can do this already you just need to change the title bars to windows in the runelite options menu
---
Copying what I commented elsewhere, but the concept art actually still exists lorewise in the book [The Turncloak](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_turncloak). Essentially, a Justiciar and her followers betray Saradomin to join Zamorak towards the end of the God Wars, dying their armour black and red, being tasked with rounding up the first people to become the human cattle now found inside Meiyerditch.
---
&gt; "At dusk we'll march on Drakans' host and bend the knee - my squadron will pay the price and I'll become a general to a god who provides." ... "Our armour is black and our clothing crimson, but they still know a Justiciar when they see one and they know it would be heresy to defy me."
---
I’d say just go void over dhide. Save you about 2m in god item upgrade, then just get archers ring.
---
You're full of strawman arguments and a fundamental misunderstanding of logical fallacy lol. No one is assuming jagex is guaranteed to rig the poll, literally no one said that.
---
I never said any of the following in any of my posts:
---
&gt;We have to stop jagex from cheating
---
&gt;The only two possibilities are jagex cheating or showing poll results
---
&gt;Jagex will rig polls if results are hidden
---
None of these have ever been my argument and i'm very sorry if you've misunderstood. My argument is not based on the idea that jagex *will* cheat. My argument is based on the idea that someone (maybe not even necessarily jagex, i.e. poll bots) *could* cheat. The risk that someone *could* cheat and we would have no way of knowing far outweighs the idea that poll results should be hidden for some group of people that can't even be proven exists.
---
If you're so into logical fallacies, you would know the concept of onus probandi - i.e. the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. If you claim there are so many people affected by poll results being revealed, then prove it. Show me where these people are, because so far I have yet to see someone say "I don't vote because poll results are visible". So prove to me they're there.

Void is only good for off-task training with a safe spot or prayer, so it really depends on if you do slayer at all.

So that noobs don’t get teleported into the ice plateau, how about suspected bots have accept aid turned off by default, instead of player below level 30.

I was under the impression OP was only asking about nmz training. I’d agree slay helm is 100 percent better on task

You can claim a space as yours but it doesn't give you a right to the space.

I actually personally do trust them. But the people that want poll results hidden clearly don't, which leads me to believe that these same people will scream rigged when polls don't go their way.

Not to mention my trust in them is not a reason to not check them. See also: mod jed.

my first easy clue scroll earned me 300k. 
---
Theres only one place the bgs beats the dwh and thats due to salve plus void stacking increasing max hit substantially as well as vork being much weaker to slash than crush
---
It absolutely is true, not to mention posts that get marked gold get significantly more upvotes. Sure, they usually have more upvotes because the comment is better than the others, but more times than I can count I subconsciously found myself upvoting a post just because it's gilded. Sometimes I even think the comment is funnier that I would have just because of that little mark that says "this one is more important than the others."
---
Tzharr area has the same thing
---
It's so bad, that I can't not like it
---
Because a huge part of osrs community already doesn't use their brain while playing, is it that bad to require them to make a conscious decision once in a while instead of voting for whatever's winning?
---
Dope
---
A good spec would speed up my kills by around a minute which leads to saved supplies. I guess its really just preference and how easy of a time you have getting to the boss. 
---
damn russian hackers
---
That’s not correct at all, what if I told you only a very small portion of the player base uses reddit/watches the streams. Probably 30% of players won’t even know what it’s related too.

He wasn't saying 41000 xp/hr. 41000xp is the amount of exp required before Talia stops burning herring.
---
Fairy tale 2 requires 57 herblore and 49 farming. 
---
I'm fairly certain they only poll things they want to add. If it fails they are like okay we won't officially add it, but we won't police verse it. Which means by default it gets added anyway
---
That window of time to make the forum post to get your xp rolled back already ended afaik but they may make an exception if you haven't played in a while and missed all of the news about it

---
I've looked them up, none of the codes I've tried have worked
---
&gt;First, polls tend to trend in the same direction after a sizable sample group has voted. In other words, it would be a huge red flag if the polls suddenly went from passing to failing after a few hundred people have voted.
---
They don't have to do that, they can just slowly drip feed in whichever vote they want through the entire duration of the poll. If Jagex wants to rig a poll without the player base knowing about it, it would be easy whether results are hidden or not, it would just be slightly easier with hidden results. 
---
But if we're operating under the assumption that Jagex would actually rig a poll, the slightly increased challenge of rigging with visible poll results isn't going to deter them.
---
The ONLY semi-valid reason to not hide poll results is that it once failed a poll. And that's barely a reason, as it's a game integrity issue that should never have been polled in the first place. And even if you think that it should have been polled, they should at least re-poll it, as they've done with other things that have failed/passed and then had a lot of controversy surrounding them.
---
Come on guys, the joke is getting so old. It was boring at first, now just worse. Few people care, just vite no on ezscape and pray, pray harder if votes are not on ur side

Oh ok Ill do that, thanks so much! :D
---
It really is just psychology. Even the most intelligent people are subject to their own cognitive biases despite knowing they exist.
---
It isn't a matter of the players being stupid or sheep, like you said. They shouldn't be exposed to the results beforehand in the first place. It's Jagex's incompetence to implement basic integrity. 
---
&gt;isnt that like -65 and you get 0 damage no matter what?
---
This is incorrect. For one, -65 magic would have no effect on the damage done, just the accuracy of his magic attacks. 
---
Secondly, Karil and the melee brothers all have zero magic defense, meaning no matter what your magic bonus is (positive or negative) you have the same odds to hit them.
---
Could be. Your dps will only go up if your max hit increases. Likely that the boost from Fighter Torso wasn't quite enough to make your max hit go up. 
---
ohhhhhhhh no no no no no no
---
Yep, But it can be done at 52 herb if you boost +5 with the spicy stews. Thats what I did :D

Lol yeah just use your crops on him

Dont bother trying, I already took everything out of that bank. Only had 6k gp and a bunch of vyrewatch sets for some odd reason.

I don't know if this was actually in the game, but it's funnier in 2019 than it was in 2007

If I was making an extraordinary claim sure. I'm not though. I'm stating common and basic fact.
---
What if Jagex find a way to increase max cash? 
---
Being affected by seeing poll results before voting has nothing to do with being dumb. Dumb or not, it’s a psychological effect which is subconscious. Voting to hide poll results until after a person has voted is not the same as saying ‘I have 0 faith in the playerbase’.
---
Hmm okay, Im just mystified why I always struggle so much with karil in particular :/
---
35 agi xor underground pass, no boosts and fell 0 times. Friend with me had 44 and fell 11 times at the bridge to the temple, I laughed my ass off with the microphone muted whiöe hearing him rage in discord :D

I wouldn’t care if there was a strictly cosmetic MTX shop implemented into the game, so long as it doesn’t become a slippery slope.

Bold of you to assume that any one that’s at Runefest is going to approach a woman.

Was this at draynor? Coulda been me lol, I saw 2 guys learning the game together, fishin shrimps a few weeks back when i was getting my wc up on the ironmeme. It was so cool to see them playing together and exploring i gave em each 500k

Doesn't really matter because most people just use Addy Darts anyways and the people that use Dragon and Rune usually have 99 Range anyways.

Iban's blast has higher damage and doesn't use up charges of tome of fire so it would be a good investment.

---
If you're someone who wants to know what the results are before voting, you currently have to look at choose to look at them first, you have to click the buttons.       
---
&gt; If you go out of your way to find the results outside the game and vote based off the majority, you're an idiot and shouldn't even be allowed to vote lol.      
---
It's the same logic for why you'd want to hide results at all though, you want to know whether your individual vote will matter. If the results seem to be near the 75% threshold, then someone who wouldn't normally participate might feel more inclined to vote.
---
Individually no, as a horde I’d imagine they would 
---
As someone who hasn't played for a while and doubly so hasn't been involved with the community - Why are people asking for poll results to be *hidden*? I'd imagine knowing what percentages are what are a good bit of transparency and shows what people want.
---
Also less chance of being fudged by Jagex right?
---
The guy who designed it probably only spent 10 minutes on this shit
---
Ye

I gotta clean that up lol

I'm having the same issue. I purchased $70 in cards at a gamestop (local gamestop was having a promotion). Advertised 100 days, getting 63/64 (I think?)

If it was a long time ago, it might have been before the burst meta, i.e. before catacombs. Tasks like nechs and dust devils are your best exp tasks now (along with cannon stuff ofc)

Still should go for a torso. Try inputting super strength pot in the DPS calculator and seeing if your DPS is still the same. Also unless you’re 99 str and have max str gear, as you level up and get upgrades, the torso can be the difference in increased DPS or not

Some of these complaints are legit, but the ones I've pointed out are really dumb.

Alright Mr. BTS.

I think i just had shit luck to be honest. I did Cerb and Sire as well
---
This post is gold! I didn’t even notice that! :D
---
So you see poll results *before* you vote? I thought that by "Hidden until after you vote" you meant the results weren't shown until you already cast your vote.
---
Says the guy who makes posts spamming about ELEVEN DOLLARS. 
---
I completely agree with you, but to play the devils advocate... all words were created at one point. We're in a generation where EVERYTHING is changing due to technology. Adding new words to the dictionary related to things that have popped up recently is a very realistic change to expect

Just because they don’t know how doesn’t mean they wouldn’t attempt it 
---
I can't stand my hair if I don't bath at least once a day. I really don't get it. 
---
Jagex could already do/be doing that. They would just have to flip a switch at the start of the poll that doesn't allow the poll to pass 75%, and adds artifical votes to prevent that from happening in real time (as opposed to it suddenly getting 5k extra votes at the very end or something)

Good to know , I’ll probably go for it in the near future , is the torso viable for all combat levels ?

Yeah but just moving the mouse to the side does that automatically

Exactly. The game has been around in one form or another since 1999. It’s not unreasonable to expect it to make another decade at least.

Yes

 Would love this tbh, an issue I’m constantly battling since I upgraded my pc is I only have 1 monitor now because I didn’t even think of something not being compatible.

Damn, Bwana.

Yes currently you see them before you vote. That poll that is in the picture was to hide them until after you vote. That poll did not pass so we still currently see them BEFORE we vote. 
---
We all want to see the poll results. Lately there has been an outcry to hide them until after you vote.

&gt;you get money, but in terms of how much u pay for how much you gain is pretty much you needing to spend a fuckload of money to get anything.
---
fuck load of money is a relative term, its not unreasonable for some people to be able to drop a couple hundred dollars on something.
---
&gt;Not only that it's just in-game currency which currency realistically isn't anything beneficial when it comes to certain things as you don't NEED something to do just as good with a lower level item.
---
money determines how fast you gain xp in a lot of skills
---
&gt; I forgot to mention, bonds have been in the game since 2014/2015, so if you're going to bring that argument up it's kind of a moot point.

just because something has been in the game for a long time doesn't change what it is, it is a mtx.

I do believe bonds to be beneficial to the game but they are mtx

People in my clan always say "just get a DHCB" but I'm a mid level player with 93 range. Bank of about 50m. The blowpipe from what I've heard is about as fast, and in terms of buy-in cost 4m is nothing.  Sure it's better gp/hr, but people are never factoring in that you need 140m to even buy it in the first place.

People arguing about stuff they don't know about is one thing that triggers me about this sub. For instance when Drew and his sandstone machine was being talked about, people came out of the woodworks claiming that it would be dead on release because at top speed it was as fast as gathering sand at charterships and that "people would stick with charters". In reality no ironmen that have access to lunars are buying sand from charterships, it's either getting it passively with Bert or gathering it at Yanille.

The narrative about BP and ranged in general being the go-to for every boss is also hilariously misguided.

Incel is short for "Involuntary celibate". Basically they blame literally anything other than themselves for why they're not constantly getting laid without having to put in any effort on their personal appearance/hygiene, and think that they're owed sex and if a woman doesn't put out she's being a prude. The whole incel community is extremely toxic; way more than OSRS can be even at its worst.

I always liked the idea of nerfing the blowpipes range to equal throwing darts, like 3 squares. Would make it more situationally useful instead of universally the best.

I'm actually currently a pmod, and I've every time I got the GE I mute 1-2 of these shits. Issue is the pmod system is flawed. What's meant to happen is I'll mute someone then someone higher than me reviews my report and makes action based on this. That's a lie. What actually happens is the bot will stand their wait out the mute. I don't hink in almost 2 years of being a pmod any of my mutes have been actioned on.
---
It is a shitty thing to do. In this game I've given away stacks of 10m on a whim, and I've also had people gift me ascension crossbows out of nowhere. It feels amazing, and the player interaction is worth more to me than the virtual gold. You don't want to be that guy who makes a fellow player hate humanity because someone he thought was his friend fucks him over.

Hey hey congrats. What cape at gargoyles?

They can fake it now anyway. Maybe your vote counted, but maybe the 3 in opposition to yours were planted by Jagex. Jagex is the only one with all the data. You already don't know if they're being tampered with and you never will.
---
Maybe you could look it up on Reddit, but why would you? The point of hiding them is to protect people from being subconciously biased when they vote. Why would you willingly subject yourself to it? And a few people willingly letting their vote be affected by a subconcious bias is much better than forcing that same bias on the entire userbase.

The IQ of this is too high for the average OSRS player buddy, you're gonna need to try again.

I've been playing both games consistently... League is far, far worse. League actually makes me think about scheduling doctors appointments to check for cancerous tumors in my brain.

Osrs has some asshats but I can leave or find a way to never interact with them much more easily than in league when I'm forced to work together with them in ranked.

It only cost me ~6-8m to go from 50-74 construction using mounted mythical capes. Then I used crystal saw +3 and spicy stew +5 to build the rejuvenation pool, which does just about everything you need it to except health, but it ends up that I just pool, eat 2-3 food, and stockup in lunar bank. The maxed out pool is expensive, sure, but that's why they have lower tier ones.

Moving the mouse to the side also cancels your previous selection of use item, which the cancel button doesn't.
---
i think 5 accounts is fine. But when people start swarming one person with like 20 it just seems ridiculous. also 5 was just an example for me the cut off is like 10
---
Greed dragonhide the poll results
---
i was salty indeed. MY cheeks still sting
---
Ahh, gotcha
---
Good loot there! Enjoy membs
---
Oh yeah it's certainly better than nothing, and still worth doing Vork if you only have a BP. 
---
That being said though, kill times are about 25% slower with the blowpipe, and you lose a lot of time running to and from the bank. And of course operating cost. Last I saw blowpipe is about 1.5m less gp/hr, so it's certainly not negligible.
---
Firstly, all bonds that enter the game are bought by someone.  So how they get membership is immaterial in this case.  
---
Secondly, what you are suggesting is pretty immoral.
---
Thirdly, They are not botting, they are farming gold manually, Jmods have confirmed this for us.  
---
Lastly, VPNs are super straight forward these days, it would be easy to circumvent your proposed plan (as it is easy to circumvent netflix's plan). 
---
Damn man you really got me figured out. I may hate my life, but at least I don't think it is remotely reasonable to whip out my cell phone a take a picture of my fucking computer screen like a senile grandmother. It's 2019 retard, there is a button on your keyboard specifically for taking screenshots.

Same here.. got 10 times as many Iasor as attas

Main reason I quit playing Magic was absolutely disgusting player base.

I once dropped a bowl of soup on the floor right as I started Tears of Guthix. You better believe that thing didn't even get looked at until I was done. Plus the soup was kinda thick so I didn't feel that bad about it

There's no defacto 'order' that things need to be accomplished in this game, that's the beauty of it. You can do what you want when you want. Set some goals for yourself and try to complete them, fuck around, bankstand and make some friends. It's your journey.
---
Given that you've got 70 combat stats and barrows gloves, you're in a solid starting position to so a whole lot of things. 
---
Do you enjoy bossing? Grind some Slayer and get your melees, ranged, and magic up. You could afk NMZ for this as well, but doing Slayer will unlock good bosses and tasks along the grind to higher stats. 
---
Do you enjoy questing? Start getting the stats for the QPC one quest at a time. QPC is extremely useful if you don't have the construction level for a fairy ring in your house - the legends guild has a fairy ring right next to it.
---
Want to try Raids 1? Aim for 80 combat stats, 78 herblore, a decent farming level, void and a few other items then check out We Do Raids - they host learner raids every Saturday morning at 11AM EST. Herblore and farming are not required for the learning raids, but they will help if you ever want to start a group of your own.
---
Do you enjoy Castlewars or some other minigame? Fuck it, go play that! 
---
If you had a weapon that was a bit stronger than the Blowpipe that didn't consume scales, would you say that is higher level? Because that is what the Rapier is to the Tentacle Whip and it is honestly a dangerous thing as its current level. If we say the Rapier is what a Level 75 weapon is supposed to be, that means a Level 80 weapon should be even strong... But if we say the Rapier is what a Level 80 weapon should be, which is justified given its perks, then it leads to less powercreep in the progression.
---
Because at the end of the day 99% of the issues that will actually be seen by anyone at Jagex that we post here will never be seen by anyone who could actually change things, and if told they probably just don'r give a shit. Our JMods are competent 99% of the time, its really the higher ups in management and the other teams that fuck up regularly.
---
You're right, and I'll have to grind that out, but I'm avoiding underground pass, not the agility grind.
---
Between a cock...
---
It would be kinda ironic if a third-party client hid poll results when once of the reasons against not hiding them is that third-party clients could track and show poll results...
---
The point i was making is that nobody who sells a tbow will put it in even on accident for less than 100m. And that if they really wanted this to work theyd have to go higher to get lucky
---
I dunno, it sounds like a slippery slope.
---
You’re basically saying: “Things are the way they are and because we didn’t ask for his, they should be the other way around.”
---
She faked having cancer and was white knighted by mod Matt k when people mocked her for it.
---
Basically she's an insufferable cunt. 
---
Any speech that does not have the ability to physically hurt another is allowed in the US.  Any speech that has the ability to emotionally hurt another is not allowed in the UK. You don't see the difference and that's because you're an actual mongoloid.
---
Devil's advocate.
---
Hiding poll results may cause a significant decrease in passing content. Personally I think all the content, save for a few specific examples, have been good updates. The things that were truly bad for the game have failed. 
---
I'd rather polls stay the way they are because the game as it is right now is the best Runescape has ever been.
---
Actually ge tracker price. There are a lot of merchers
---
Osrs streamer who draws on her face with a marker to make herself look like a cat.
---
Has faked cancer in order to get more donations/subs.  Thus causing this subreddit to hate her. (Rightfully so imo but I'll remain unbiased here)
---
Has been accused of viewbotting her streams and ppl have "proven" this accusation to be true. (Look this up if u actually care)
---
Somehow (dont recall how) a meme started where Mod Mat K had a huge crush on her. Believed it started bc he was always banning ppl in game for harassment bc they would find emily in game and make jokes about her faking cancer.
---
Her nudes have been leaked and are on the runescapegonewild subreddit.
---
I think ive missed other stuff but ya. General idea for ya. Hope that helps.
---
Damn, you always have good jokes. Will make sure to get decent video of this 
---
Still faster to just plug it in.
---
Sorry, little gay. You'll find your true love one day.

lol i wish i could find some of my old messages, remember when we would say "XD" all the time oh god

You ever get rid of it?

To be fair,  for the F2P scene ogress are OP as fuck and most people think they shouldn't have been added

This is why eoc came out in the first place. Most of the people voting for these things are brand new players that don’t know anything about the results of their votes.

It's a theme, I use chrome

Wait, so you're not a grill? :o

Oh look rs3 esque items...

I put a saradomin set in for 1m a little while back and let it sit for two weeks and it sold so its possible.

The bonus mining xp is the big part I think

Please make Farming Zamorak Wines worthwhile so players don't have to rely on the bot friendly Zamorak Wine spawn.

He started getting all "rules are rules" but then tried adding 10,000 exceptions so he didnt have to say "that's dumb I'm not doing that" when he couldn't justify all of them he disappeared. The secret is people dont really give a shit as long as it's in the spirit of the challenge

Found the better.

Updoot for the smackdoot.

Welcome to my jagex locked Ironman omg 
---
Most people who trade them are scammers alts "winning" money
---
What??
---
Needs hidden polls
---
I think I am most confused how a few clips and pics of you doing things on the account is any sort of proof it wasnt botted. Really makes it hard to believe you when your "proof" shows literally nothing

What abiut crab guy for the loadout tab?

yea it came on the radio the other day in the car and all i could think about was swampletics, also this is a really good classic song

Runes Cape.... RuneScape... :D

U know I can believe some one reported my mate who was on talking to me online as a bot because he was thriving stalls n not talking n he got temp bann. He did not bot shit but if some report You while ur in botzone it increases ur chances to get banned

7 year old me was too busy grinding out 21 magic so that I could use low alchemy to turn my armor into gilded armor. 
---
What an error
---
TBH it doesn't help that much. While yeah really there's no reason for it to be allowed, it is a tiny issue compared to the other things people are using rampantly with no repercussions like AHK. 10/10 would rather this not be the hot new issue than the ones that are real problems.
---
Lol, this was a ray of laughter in an otherwise joyless evening 
---
It's almost as if people were only bandwagoning onto it because a few big name streamers threw it into their rotation for a little bit.
---
I’ve had an sgs offer for 100k for 2 years.. I haven’t given up yet

Omg, yes. Please.

No problem

Erm, that's still skill.

Why scratch out irrelevant stuff lola

Looks very nice designed! Good to see some Hunter content improvements!
