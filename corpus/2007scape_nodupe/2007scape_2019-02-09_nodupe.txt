“Guides for us all” has some really good content, watched a lot of his stuff. Basically just an adventure series of him progressing his accounts.
---
0 to 100 real quack
---
I’m 188 quest points, lvl 55 combat. I do everything fastest xp possible and staminas everywhere (usually3-4 stamina’s per quest) I’ve used well over 20m.
---

---
But the account is 12 days old with 1100 total and 188 qp.
---
Not when there's literally nothing they can do about it

No but I got a minor in naruto and a lifetime of mmo auctionhouse training.

Correction, it's similar to the oldest scam in the book, but the oldest scam goes more along the lines of having one person on one side of the bank saying "selling X item for 500k (when it's only worth like 100k)" and you have another person on the other side of the bank saying "Buying X item for 2m" people will buy it for 500k thinking they can make a quick flip but the second guy never trades .-.
---
697.9 to be exact
---
Wrong. The pre-nerf collection method was 1.3 EHP when compared to charters being 1 EHP. In addition to that, it involves the best method to get tangleroot in the game (seaweed collection) and is AFK after you finish casting superglassmake, just AFK bankstand the resulting glass.

Go beg for 5 mins on a street corner, will buy a months members.

I'm not acting entitled to anything. I specifically said that PKers can kill whoever they want. I was replying to someone complaining about how hated PKers are and I explained why people don't like them and why people don't vote for PvP content. I'm not asking anybody to stop PKing, just explaining some of the consequences it may incur.
---
personally i've never liked any other mmo that i've tried to get into. not sure what it is about runescape that i like exactly but it doesnt feel like a normal mmo
---
True, they need to add back Falador Party Room worlds.

How is this even worth 530k? Seems like an overestimate. 
---
RIP tho
---
Ironmen are ruining this game.
---
"without any issues"
---
Lol yeah, say anything in chat and you get banned. Remember when Dunkey quit? Iirc, he said something not even remotely offensive in chat and got temp banned. And it was a big problem, not just for him.
---
Do you use Barrows tele tabs to get there?
---
no he doesn't he's bound by a lot of self imposed rules that's literally the point of the series
---
But it also has runespan and this subreddit would hate such easyscape xp
---
Yes
---
Tbh the moms credit card tier only applies if their slayer is below a certain level or if they're below 110 cb.
---
Good luck on your journey my friend. I was almost maxed like you and quit because of EOC. Took me 2.5 years after the release of OSRS to decide I would start again and grind out all those skills I had on my old main. It’s tough but definitely worth it!
---
Either sell and learn from your lesson or find another poor soul to pass it on to

If you lock your phone, it logs you out.

I have the client running on my computer at home, so even if I lock my phone, or switch to another app, it keeps running at home.

No one groups people like him with you Reverend, people understand brainlets very rarely travel in packs. They only congregate together on Reddit because their CC and Discord is sick of hearing them bitch about losing their completely free spade.(Thanks farming guild!)
---
/u/mathdude3 is the type of nigga to go in the wildy with 5m risk accidentally, get pked, then spend the next 2 years crusading about it on Reddit like people who participate in PvP are assholes.
---
Jedi Mind Tricks makes even the stupidest of brainlet think they are superior then you and they they understand logic &amp; the world better then your pansy ass. /s
---
And who set those rules? Oh yeah it was Settled... So in other words HE DOES WHAT THE FUCK HE WANTS
---
The game has already had years of ironman updates. It’s already built for ironmemes. 
---
What brain thought that adding the only boat that goes to a giant land mass to a little village right next to largest port in the game, instead of just leaving it at said port?
---
&gt; all 3rd age gear is so high
---
Some is almost worthless. There are pieces under 10m.

Look at the numbers of bloodhound pets released by jagex. As of may 24 2018 there were 739 bloodhounds in game. They are a 1/1000 drop rate, so let's say by now 1 million master clues have been done. Nearly all individual third age pieces are around 1/40,000-1/50,000. They are rarer in master clues scrolls because the master 3rd age table includes all of the pieces. 1 million divided by 50k is oh what is that? 20. So you are right it's not 50, probably even less than that.

He might not have, but he can if he wants to. It sells for that much, it's a fact.

for some reason that song reminds me of ice poseidon's old rs videos
---
i thought they were just making a joke about 1 kc being a grind
---
Why not move it back to Port Sarim? Port Sarim is still a f2p area.
---
They seem to be working just fine considering the game is more popular now than its been in years.  You seem to be contradicting yourself?.. I mean you say the j-mods know better, but the game run only by j-mods is failing miserably whereas the one with the poll system is constantly above 100k players?  
---
Again, look at RS3 if you want to see a game without polls lmfao, is it that hard to? Why is the game with polls doing so much better than the one without? Sheer luck? 
---
Their bot detection system is based on click precision and other common attributes of macroing software. If they banned you for it, its extremely likely there was botting going on on your account whether you were aware of it or not. Could have even been an advertising bot that didnt move your character but was just spamming chat. But I am 100% sure they didn't simply ban you for farming giants.
---
No idea? Maybe people assumed you were being sarcastic. 
---
God I wish I could play 4 hours a day
---
Im not saying it isnt bullshit. You could try emailing their support (preferably after calming down as to not say anything stupid :) )  and inquiring on the proof. Im not sure if they'll give any to you or even respond. But at least you could try.
---
Off the game for the weekend sadly but my next goals are getting more ToB kc, Claw/Head/Pet drop from Hydra, Claw drop from Skotizo and mutagens from Zulrah.
---
Yes, I am aware of the problems of closing the window and not logging out. That is why I log out using the designated button in the game.
---
This is fucked and puts into perspective that these dictators are not our friends.
---
Got to wave 47 missed a tick on Mager. Gonna try again soon. Doing it on obby mauler

Draynor is right next to port sarim it should of just stayed there tbh.

Get a torso and a nezzy/slayer helm and a dragon defender and fire cape. 
---
For the leggins, bandos tassets, veracs skirt, obsidian legs, dragon legs or torag legs are fine options. 
---
U ever gotten one on an obby?
---

---
I’m sorry in advance if this is a dumb question but what is the significance between 100 combat and 99? Or is that just a hard limit for your combat for PvP? 
---
20% left? stake more
---
So both?
---
Hacked, the bought bonds with stolen credit card.
---
RIP you pay them back or lose your account lol
---
It only feels small because it is. Same as osrs, I reckon they both have a similar sized overworld. You can always turn down your view distance if you want to maintain the illusion. 
---
" Along side that, power creep is starting to effect the game. New content  doesn’t need to drop new BIS gear to be fun. It doesn’t need to be the  best gp/xp per hour to be fun. It just needs to be engaging, new and  interesting! "  
---
They tried that and people flipped out over a dock lol
---
Yes you did! Am so happy for you
---
It's like 100m for the absolute fastest method
---
You can still get pretty good exp (600k+/h) for reasonably cheap doing like addy bolts.
---
Wines aren't bad either
---
Make the dock smaller and add a rowboat. I think it fits eith the Draynor feel to have a small dock for boats. 
---
Maybe even add a potato famine or 2
---
No, I did not close the client, I am fully aware of the result of closing the client. Also a correction, I did keep the standard 3 items, indicating a death. The problem is I logged out and this was the result.
---
That's still doable in poh
---
What a fucking moron lmao. 
---
Had a similar situation happen to me back pre Eoc
---
Guy sold me a regen bracelet much cheaper than what was shown for its current value
---
Little did I know that he was just selling it so cheap because nobody wanted to buy the damn thing lol 
---
Spent days trying to get that thing outta my hair 
---
Debs didn't poll a dock and a bar and Reddit is begin a big ass crying baby as usual
---
What world art thou in i want to see thyne spectacle
---
*Now* ***that*** *is some nostalgia.* 
---
Dolphin Park anyone? 
---
Another good indicator is their cape.
---
Did my cape using bandos instead of ancestral, got to wave 50+ way more consistenly with that setup and you barely splash more on the nibblers.
---
I would replace the Spectral with an Arcane and Imbued heart helps.
---
That isn't the same thing at all.  That's like expecting a PKer voting for a PvM buff, considering the items PvMers get do effect pking quite a lot.
---
That being said, no one is "baiting" pvmers anywhere, jagex put that content in the wilderness for pkers to do and to fight over.  Or are you saying that no content should be put into the wilderness?  The best PvM content remains outside the wilderness and the gap is considerably large.  Zulrah, vorkath, hydra, raids 1, raids 2 ALL completely SHIT on anything in the wild.
---
All BIS gear is outside the wilderness, what's the big deal in one of them being in the wilderness? Its literally a one time thing as well, I don't see the issue with dying 2 times to get your mage cape.  
---
Not to mention I've done like 10+ clues in the wild and got my mage cape and didnt even run into a pker lmao.  It isn't often you get pked and if you do, big deal, its part of the game.  You lose at most 300-400k if you're going for the mage cape, and 40k if you're doing a clue.
---

Game just keeps getting easier lmao. Giant seaweed is already the perfect update to make the process a little easier for ironman m, but now you want more? GG, this game is full of too many rs3 idiots it seems.
---
I thought about the clicking thing to, but I mean I would kill a giant and immediately click on another giant quickly with one click, I did do it with precision so maybe that had something to do with it, but I still did random events to make sure no one thought something was up, I mean hell couldn't a moderator come up to me and start talking to me to see whether or not if I was a bot, I've only had the account 3 weeks I don't think anyone would have hacked into my account, it just doesn't seem likely
---
I can't do Zulrah worth a damn, Vorkath is okay but not quite fast enough. I've been doing Raids 1 in hopes of a t-bow split etc, not sure what else to do though 
---
Stake or Riot

I would of been happy with the fuckin d mace

I am heated, sorry for that. Where would I go to email them about this? All I can seem to find is the appeals page which won't be helpful to me in this situation
---
How is he a moron if he didn’t know any better jerk off
---
So like... what’s the big deal here? 
---
I got a bloodhound on my 6th master, you got a 3a pick. I’m content with that. I’m sensing a pattern here

Found the 200 in guy. /a

Also no bgloves and or firecape 
---
I like the addition of sandstone being used for sand, but I do think the rates are a bit overtuned. You're looking at 5-6k sand/hr now compared to 2k/hr before. You're also gaining mining xp at the same time.
---
I think 3-4k/hr would've been slightly more reasonable.
---
Personally also think volcanic ash mining is being seriously overbuffed. 6x more ash/hr DOUBLED by the new bottomless compost bucket is honestly insane. I thought volcanic ash was in a decent spot after the release of the bucket. I think 3x more ash at lvl 92 would've, again, been more reasonable.
---
May be able to find in their support page. (Not able to get to PC atm)
---
I mean he was literally just uploading other peoples content and putting in about 8 ads per video, it seemed like a pretty scummy thing to do in the first place.
---
I like these memes but I've realised space horders are the main haters and it makes me erect 
---
Lmao he's probably doing a clue, hope he'll cry on reddit after*
---
go questing, work on journals, do a minigame you haven't done before, dont spend days training one skill, not trying to play efficiently and setting smaller realistic goals helps me a lot with burn. also it's important to remember it's a game not a duty or a job maybe go play something else if it's that bad.
---
Yeah I was on holiday at the time and one second it was fine the next it got banned lol
---
Take a seat, dear.

Let's be honest if u click anything on Facebook u probably deserve it

Was gonna say sorry man it's just not particularly relevant for most of us to learn anything but Spanish and French if you're Canadian. Can't really hate on people for trying though, right?

---
whats the new update with the dock/why do people hate it?
---
Or maybe different people can have fun in different ways or something lol
---
Only RS content I'm subbed to other than settled.
---
Assuming you're farming Vorkath, dragon bolts (e). You make up the difference in cost extremely easily compared to the extra dps which may mean an extra kill per trip.
---
At least it's not Jagex. Could you imagine how terrible things would fare if Chinese investors got a foot in that door? We'd probably have microtransactions and ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh wait a minute.
---

---
Wait, hardhats can expire? Are they not just good until they take a significant enough hit?
---
I only didn't bother to reply because they decided to straw man my argument, not seeing the difference in responsibilities between media and individuals and arguing against the literal definition of the "status quo" seemed boring to me. 
---
I do not agree that not wanting a pride event makes you homophobic. However, I would argue that not wanting a pride event because you find it to be "political" does lead to homophobic outcomes, such as continued oppression of gay peoples. I will concede this is definitely a huge messaging error by SJWs and Lefties because while the words "racism" and "homophobic" do actual have broad definitions they do tend to ignore the "scale" so to speak.
---
The only reason a pride event is seen as "political" is because it is not the status quo. At no point in time was there in riots over the Christmas event being added to the game. But there are people who do not celebrate Christmas and this could be seen as political to those people (this is in regards to the "happy holidays" drama).
---
Christmas is the status quo for western societies and therefore is not questioned like a pride event is.

Oh ya totally, I just think they need to sit back and take a moment to think more. Like the whole Konar thing is just given proof of that. They do accept they goof though so a lot better than most devs. 
---
I hit like 4 hours a month currently. Just no motivation and feeling meh about the direction of the game rn. I guess I’m still an addict though because for some reason I use this sub everyday.

This is exactly why I have an Ironman on RS3. No MTX, DXP, or anything of the sort. Some stuff feels like I'm being left out but I can deal with it. Some of the storylines for quests are actually quite enjoyable and being able to appreciate the scenery of some places on maxed out graphics in 1440p. Dont get me wrong, I like OSRS quite a bit but it's nice to play a game I'm familiar with but also having a difference in gameplay because of some updates.
---
Ya happened to a friend of mine who used someone's credit card for around 700$ goodluck!

I just watched all of your new series this evening after hearing about it on reddit and I was completely blown away by the quality and effort you've put into it from an editor standpoint let alone the amount of hours each episode must take. &lt;3 keep it up and thank you.

Trading bonds from a normal account to an ironman is perfectly supported by Jagex, so IMO it's a reasonable question to ask.

That is obviously not what i am talking about.
---
I'm not super worried about it. I'm pretty sure Tencent owns Grinding Gear Games, who make Path of Exile, and there doesn't really seem to have been any negative impact on that game at all. They also own Riot, which hasn't seemed to have any repercussions either.
---
It’s there for a reason. Otherwise this would be one of the nearest fairy rings to a teleport spot (ardy cloak). Devalues the quest point cape tele and the POH fairy ring

Hey!  Re starting again, I could really use some friends to help me get back into it.  I'm around 30 combat, following the optimal quest guide right now until I decide to do something else.

Is there a 2007scape clan chat to join, or anyone who wouldn't mind hangin' with a vet?  My account is about 13 years at this point, having fun just starting out in OSRS.
---
Huh... didnt know this was something I wanted, the issue I see with it is is it a post-MM2 or pre-MM2 quest? Having it be pre makes more sense difficulty wise as I imagine even the massive penguin wouldnt be as difficult as mm2 bosses, but having the penguins attack during the chaos of mm2 wouldnt feel forced in having them kidnap gnomes. Alternatively it could just be a post mm1 quest with a gnome in the hangar wanting to expand the landing sites and getting kidnapped.

He will then cast a spell on Bert's sandbox so that it'll fill itself to compensate Bert for his troubles."*

I do agree unlimited lamps would be an incredible gold sink for the economy, but I think most players are concerned this would create some OP account builds that could completely alter PKing, etc. However, with more players creating specialized accounts (ex: Swampletics, etc.) , it could add an additional layer of fun and excitement to the game. 
---
You insult me in all 4 lines you wrote and tell me to learn to speak to another human.  Hypocrit lmfao, I fail to see your logic.  You say polls suck and are a failed system, but play the game with polled updates instead of the one without polled updates?..

Did you autoclick alch? 
---
Thanks for the clip! Sounds good.

damn thats hella lit fam, ill check it out!

Seriously loved In aid of the Myreque way back when because I thought the quest series would end in a vibrant city east of the Salve.
---
I keep 2 trimmed caped and left 1 trimmed cape in my POH
---
I feel you, man. You know what always helps me? Some buckethead. Lotus island/crack the sky/siege engine etc when I'm mad. Throw is some RATM or sabbath or pre-sellout Metallica or even some SOAD if you're feeling a little more edgy, or maybe just not in the mood for an instrumental
---
Soothslayer, pandmasana, or electric sea (full album) when you're feeling bummed. If you're feeling even more sappy: wonderful tonight - Eric Clapton, Honeybee - steam powered giraffe, over the hills and far away - zeppelin, goodbye blue sky - pink floyd
---
Whatever music that helps you regulate your emotions. You don't have to be so toxic to people online like that, man. I understand the urge to do it, I really do. I think a lot of us are a little sadistic in at least some way. It's easy to let the disinhibatory/dehumanizing aspect of being anonymous on the internet affect the way you interact with other people. I get it, but all that kind of behavior does is reinforce and perpetuate that kind of toxic cycle. You're better than that! I know you are 
---
Just gotta channel that sadism/anger into something more productive or cathartic. Feel better! No more flaming 
---
YouTube rewards channels with shitty clickbait titles and key phrases by always putting them in your suggestions can you really hate someone’s channel for that? People in the thread think that cutting 100s of different moments from dozens of different streams that go for hours every week is easy. Man clearly was doing what he loved and spent a lot of time doing it hopefully things will work out. I don’t get much time to tune in for streams so it was awesome seeing what’s going on in the community daily gonna miss this channel.
---
the last time they reconsidered a poll (the spellbook icons' resizing) reddit threw an absolute shitfit, in fact i think they're still in the process of throwing it, i do not see that happening again. just learn from this and try to change the mods' attitudes so they don't poll similar things in future, because these days polling means passing and they at least have control over that part of it
---
But if you’re max it turns into “Virgin get a life”
---
This is against game rules. 
---
Are....are you serious?
---
It’s a joke my guy. But it’s interesting because he’s playing runescape completely different from anything we’ve ever seen. And he’s actually limiting himself, not making a ton of exceptions. 
---
...no?
---
The software is open source. If an update gets pushed with malicious code in it, literally anybody with an internet connection can see that without touching the program.
---
The guy is so driven and passionate about this series that it's really easy to get sucked in. The editing is also very good
---
I love my runescape and can definitely relate to other mmo survivors who are struggling with their game from EoC days. As some have stated I also believe we are in a golden age in osrs. Have fun bois and be too toxic
---
Not really a rip when you get the rarest pet in the game though 
---
good
---
Good thing that's not what I said. I said "calling it a terrible opinion is itself an opinion." I never said the command is an opinion.
---
If you plan on banking every inventory, then you’re not going to find anything anywhere near as AFK as chopping redwoods. You either fish and drop at stationary spots or you do barb fishing tbh.
---
no it is not lol
---
Blue cape bad! Red cape good!
---
You’re right! But it legit looked like the Runescape website. I guess I should’ve payed more attention to the link. Gg 
---
Oh no definitely, the pet makes that clue hella dope. But forgetting the clue, those rewards don’t look like they’d add up to 530k, that’s all
---
Make a plugin to put a bronze helm next to your name in chat.
---
nice
---
he doesn’t deserve money for stolen content
---
Yeah, after coming home from work, I only have a few hours to *responsibly* play games (6 or so if I want to stay on a shit sleep schedule) and the last thing I want to do then is do some super click intensive max EHP thing
---
Yeah, I mean best of luck with the rebuild. From here on out, never trust a link. Period. Bookmark the page for safe keeping if you want. 
---
I did it over the course of about 2 months?
---
I'm a simple man.
---
Stop attacking me like that

I started an rs3 Ironman 1 hour ago and I'm already 1800 total.

Happy Birthday!

---
Ahh a wise man
---
It's not important that he would care for each fan individually, the important thing is for his fans to like him individually. The content creator just have to care about his fanbase as a whole.
---
This way he puts out content the fans like and in turn the fans give him more exposure.
---
This is a simple concept. You don't need to be rude to others because you, individually, don't like settled.
---
You can easily safespot them in catacombs. It’s one of my favs to safespot. There should be a square of rocks at the end of the room against the wall. Go behind it and lure them on the other side. Easily can trap 3 to 4 at once in a line behind the rock.
---
I wouldnt buy it it's steady falling at 230m now, 3 days ago it was 275m its way to unstable at the moment to mess with, as good as it is it isnt worth losing money over
---
Free to play server dedicated to HAM membership when?
---
Uhm.. yeah, you should have to do the same shit everyone else has to do. Sorry that you're this late to the party and want an easier route. I mean 99 crafting is basically just filling buckets of sand at this point and now you're complaining that it's too hard still? 
---
No
---
Dudes gonna quit after a few weeks, the game isn’t fun like this. What a huge waste of money too. 
---
I mean, you're welcome to repost it without the asking for upvotes part if you want. Also, I wouldn't say Jagex being owned by a Chinses company is too relevant since the Subreddit isn't run by Jagex and the post would have been removed regardless of who owns RuneScape.
---
You say "get an ely" like they are just layin' around all over the place. Made me laugh. 
---
Yes. 
---
Well since they introduced giant seaweed, filling buckets of sand is essentially the only grind for 99 crafting. Makes sense to not devalue the skill more... although it's easier than wcing at this point.
---
Dave hasn't killed enough Chaos Elementals to win my love.
---
Thanks all!
---
doing quests to get unlocks and then reverting the xp that a quest gives you so your pure acc can have skills that normally it wouldn't access. makes a difference if you ask me
---
Imagine fishing whales 
---
Contact support, they'll straighten it out. 
---
He means not fast enough to fuel his addiction. 
---
Good thing I definitely wasn't being sarcastic then
---
the fact that it's a shadow of a gaming client, even when compared to steam
---
0 because the wizard shows when digging with spade on coordinate clues. Not a locked chest. 
---
I don't see why not personally, I mean it's more about QOL anyways since those trees obscure it and you have to go around them and then click on the fairy ring which is what makes it annoying to use. 
---
But I can respect that argument. 
---
Imo, I’m perfectly fine with the osrs tower, but adding the pre eoc runecrafting guild would be nice.
---
What are farming contracts?
---
Stop being racist in chat. 
---
Bank standing is ehp for a couple skills. Wtf
---
Still cant get on 2200 worlds. Yikes
---
Can't :/ I've been at limit for a while. Thanks!
---
I bet that idiot has a job too lmao
---
Port only?
---
This meme couldn’t have been worth it.
---
Not a KQ drop, that’s from Konar’s table
---
Which herbs should I grow in their place then? I usually plant avantoes/kwuarms in regular patches and snaps/ranarrs in protected ones.
---
Can I beat dragon slayer 2 with 70 range 70 defence ? 
---
A
---
What?
---
Without a fucking bank. 
---
That is the gameplay.
---
It does add though, it gives you a reason to do all of the content, whereas the most efficient way to play as a non iron is to find the activity that gives you the most gp/hr, then do that until you have that stats to the next best money making method. The entire game ends up revolving around how can you make the most money or drop the most in bonds.
---
Check [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Farming/Herbs) out and make your choice from it :D
---
You didn’t move your mouse off screen in between kills?
---
This was me until I no lifed all 10 episodes yesterday. It’s so good, and so bad. Like a nasty crash, you want to stop cuse it’s painful, but you can’t look away cuse it’s so good. Also, the guy is off in the head to enjoy doing it. 
---
&gt;one bad update turns the whole community against them. it’s bs
---
The whole community didn't turn against the devs. The whole community is thousands of individual people.
---
Take it to zulrah in a pvp world
---
R&amp;J only reward would literally be 1 quest point. That's... literally the least a quest could possibly give. The worst reward possible.
---
PK: If there was no challenge it wouldnt be worth getting and everyone would have one!
---
Also PK: *refuses to fight other PKers and only wants to kill PvMers*
---
I mean... under 10m is still quite a lot.
---
My whole bank, including the clothes off my back, would barely reach a couple million.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
YouTube “Swampletics” and watch #1-#10 from “Settled”
---
I'm not at all though. Usually when u get reported for foul behavior you get a notification or message in another inbox, which I havent. I havent been unkind to anyone cuz I dont ever talk to anyone
---
why?
---
I think the black med helm is a good start
---
Just because it's halfway in XP doesn't mean it's halfway time wise..
---
You missed the part where they say yes or no...
---
Absolutely fucking not. It's part of the controversial meme ban and link tax. It hurts content creators and protects big corporate entities. 
---
You know pepe? The dude who wrote it could get any non-approved derivative of feelsbadman removed from any website. It destroys free use. 
---
YouTube, reddit, facebook, etc in the EU have a legal requirement to stop hosting copyrighted content. Different than it is now. It used to be not their fault if someone uploads copyrighted material and they'd just report it and take it down. Now they can get in legal trouble for simply having it on their platform. So just delete anything slightly copyrighted instead of facing a potential legal battle. 
---
NO, but in all caps.
---
I thought you *Could* cook cooked food, turning it into burned food?
---
or is that only cooked meat?
---
i think this is a good idea why are you against it
---
What, do you think Tencent personally came over here and made the subreddit mods delete it? Lol. It probably got deleted because it has literally nothing to do with OSRS.
---
Saved the easiest till last lol ( laugh out loud) rc bad xD 
---
The devs could include Romeos outfit as a fashionscape reward to make up for the decrease in QPs
---
Been playing since June. I am so happy to finally be at mom's credit card level.
---
Moving the general store is more offensive than changing the house to the pub. 
---
Why does that work for you lad? I’d just entertain myself the opposite way ngl 
---
Edited pic of my stats from a gyazo to imgur
---
Especially when you can buy one for 10k smh...
---
Ikr, fucking normie dead mechanics
---
But chance to get depends on combat levels so it is more rare from kq
---
The modern abstract piece
---
I guess the highlights premise is kind of similar but some of the clips for GR's Top 10 things are *really* obscure and not just the most recent tourney highlights. Pretty sure they're respected and friendly with most tourney streamers to the point where they've got the okay to use content, unsure about monetisation though. 
---
probably only a handful. i remember seeing a post where this happened a couple years ago. pretty sure it was the same spot too
---
I take inspiration from the greatest artistic minds.
---
Honestly, take a walk. Don't even put headphones in just go outside, walk around the block, come home. Will take you five minutes and you get a breath of real fresh air and take in your surroundings. No music or phone to distract you.
---
Even if it's cold and/or snowy.
---
I don’t get it
---
yes. it will be hard, but you can very well do it. 
---
I dont really like the idea of balancing the game around the idea that every new player is a bot.
---
qq is like gmail for China
---
so yeah, probably, contact Jagex, you can actually get them to email you on Twitter
---
Why not just play World of Warcraft. Even in its shit BFA state right now it’s at least 15x better than rs3
---
Lol I got a super set from a hard clue yesterday and then disconnected while at olm today (hospital internet) 
---
OSRS He lost his bank OSRS He can't believe it OSRS
---
the fucking withdrawal symptoms that last until next Wednesday
---
He’s saying they’re basically throwing away money. 
---
Still a good chance more than one person has had to kill a wizard in that spot... 
---
They told OSBuddy not to have the feature, so do you magically think its OK for Runelite to have it? :D 
---
Hey Osbuddy you cant have Zulrah helper but Runelite can have Zulrah helper. 
---
Alternate skilling methods do come out. We recently got one with aerial fishing. We got an alternate way to train fishing that isn't awful to train like 2 tick fishing or purely afk. We got minnows, we got herbiboar. All of those are off meta and are pretty much exclusively used by ironmen, bots, or people exclusively hunting cosmetics like pets or the new fish backpack.We got amethyst mining, blast mining, volcanic mining. Volcanic has a discord of people who play occasionally but apart from that its impossible to find a team. Amethyst and blast are again almost exclusively bots and ironmen. 
---
The only methods that are widely used that arent the best xp are either much more profitable than the initial training method like wintertodt or are much more afk like motherload, zeah rc,  or redwoods. Trust me, I would much rather sit and do blast mining over sitting and mining at MLM. I'd rather 2 tick teaks than afk redwoods. Is a lot more enjoyable than spending time logged in and gaining xp, but it seems like a lot of people would are of the mindset that if they're required to pay attention, it should be the best xp.
---
Isn't that the point of this post? We don't play ironman to be a masochist, (unless you're a UIM), we play it so there's a reason to farm Dags and barrows and abyssal sires, and progress through the game. Doing tedious and boring things is not the appeal of the ironman.
---
PINKY UP

I don’t think I’ve ever seen more dislikes on a cake day post
---
Gf account

tbh idk why people will care dude just stole clips of twitch streamers and made money off them hell im sure he never ever ask 
---
omg I haven't heard Skychi's name in YEARS. I was of a very small, honorable group of those who were on HIS friends list.. 
---
Bless you
---
No just complete ratcatchers
---
Back to port sarim, but stick a veos copy at the gates to lumby or near the guide or something with a quest marker so you can start the quest there. Have him direct players to the southern most dock in port sarim. 
---
you must be extremely lucky or I must not be because ive done at least 20 tasks with one key and im not killing low level monsters
---
i hope we get a proselyte armor upgrade to the green trimmed one we can see the highest level white knights wear
---
Dock bad
---
I believe there's something that happens when "to much" loot sits on one tile that causes things to go away quicker.
---
R2h is the cool kid weapon so use it wisely ok?
---
I think it might even be a Khazard helm
---
would be a different story if he asked for permission to use other content creators clips
---
Then if that's the case, idk what I said to who, and I have no idea how long I'm muted for. For a first offense I've been muted for 2 months... I've literally never been able to talk to anyone since I started this game :'( I guess it's time to quit
---
He never said it did?
---
They probably used the new worlds where you can have anything and any stats
---
It would affect a lot more than just sub 32qp Dragon Slayer accounts. But I don't think we should justify a new "discontinued" just because it makes them "unique".
---
ok this is really cool
---
good, those channels steal content and profit off it

My plan when I was a new player was to learn the telegrab spell, and then become filthy rich off the loot in the basement. 
---
I was young and naive
---
well if you're doing it for xp, never. If you're doing it for food...asap I suppose.
---
somehow i dont think that was the guys point lol
---
Tbow is worth over a bil gp and he's high alching for 3mil~
---
Oh hell yea LOL 
---
i miss dungeoneering and summoning
---
We dont or atleast i dont 😅
---
I kinda wish this was a real game mode lol 
---
Nice. Im 23 kc and no bucket
---
Each tile can only hold  certain amount of items (128?). So when the tile exceeds that number it deletes items, starting with the lowest value ones. 
---
At a spot like barbarian fishing there are going to be lots of people dropping items onto the same tile which will push it over the limit. 
---
Jagex didn't ask OSB to remove it. OSB preemptively added a 1 tick delay voluntarily.
---
Thats cute you think you can make money ourside of pvm.
---
Terrible idea because the opening quest are all botted anyway. Majority of suiciders aren’t making fresh account and running them through quests every time. They buy accounts in bulk that finished tut island and then bot the f2p quest 
---
Gg thanks for the account Parker 
---
teach me how to raid pls
---
did he actually code the plugin or did he get someone else to do it for him? looks interesting
---
Yeah but how long would YouTube hold up? What if runescape dies, or what if his content dies? You need a backup plan and "being an internet star" is not a good plan
---
Q
---
I cant say that thought hasnt crossed my mind before but I'm not convinced. 
---
For one, I never had membership back in the day, or ever, so my nostalgia for the game is rooted squarely in the f2p side of things. 
---
Secondly, F2P has more finite and obtainable goals in my view, where as membership has so much more to do and so many more things to obtain that I know with the amount of time I want to put into the game I'll always be a smaller fish in a bigger pond there, when I could be a bigger fish in a smaller pond in f2p. 
---
Finally membership has always struck me as a bit of a trap/cycle. I feel like I'd have to commit to playing at least enough to buy a new bond every month, and while I understand that is a lot easier to do on the membership side of things than it is on the f2p side it is still a commitment. 
---
For example I put the game down for the better part of a year on my current character before I picked it back up in the last couple months and I was right where I left off. If I'd been a member I'd have been locked out of all of the membership stuff I'd done/had until I reupped. 
---
I suppose you could negate that by keeping a spare bond in reserve but I'm simply not convinced by the whole thing. 
---
Ultimately I've always figured that if I'm going to go for membership it would be after I already obtained all the things I wanted from f2p and then debated if I was happy with that or if I wanted more and if that desire for more was worth the commitment. 
---
What one has a better prayer bonus? 
---
tfw still 1750 dry of ahrims top
---
Oh that's funny, I mention because I felt you were hitting quite well despite it!
---
“Hope you get 3 defense you spastic”
---
I take inspiration from the greatest autistic minds.
---
Lol what? How could anyone have gotten that? You left out 3 and a half words... are you having a stroke?
---
This is satisfying for me, I cant even imagine how you were feeling watching this haha. 
---
I was afraid of this. It's just that 1 prayer looks so clean lol. It would seem like a waste to get prayer after maxing with 1. I think I'll just give slayer a shot and see how I do with the higher layer content. I'll max at 73 though tough so I can only to Chaeldor lol.
---
U really thought u had something with this huh
---
Never. 
---
Sharks are just about the worse thing you can possibly fish. 
---
If you want super AFK fishing do either monkfish or angler fish. 
---
Karambwans are even better but slightly less AFK due to the higher catch rate and need to teleport for banking. 
---
Kind of sad to see the mods having to hold the communitie's hand during this temper tantrum
---
Slayer meta moved away from SGS, with Expeditious Bracelets, it's better to just use Prayer Potions and DDS spec for more xp/hr.
---
Idk, it just does.
---
"pls am just doing clue"
---
Jon is coming for C Engineer's for sure
---
Literally no one mad about this monetization than YouTube. The creators he featured were fine with it and even gave them some attention. 
---
Granted they aren't his videos but you tell me it takes 10 minutes to go through heaps of videos and edit them together
---
RS3 is quite a pretty game imo, even if I like OSRS's look better. 
---
If you want the new continent to get more exposure, why not have a mage stand Lumbridge or Draynor who will teleport you?
---
How much time would training to 99 mining with a dragon pick compared to a rune pick take?
---
Great editing, subbed! 
---
ahh interesting. It's probably also why you only see piles of strugeon on the ground and less of salmon or trout.
---
The only defense people have to adding it is that "it doesn't stop bank clearing, it delays the inevitable"
---
But then why do we have bank pins removal delay?
---
?
---
If it does die, he can just go to college then, no real reason to go right away 
---
For Swampletics to smith his bars
---
Div isn't too bad now with Hall of Memories, not as good as caches but apparently they will be nerfed soon.
---
Menaphos rep isn't that bad, it's pretty quick now after the buffs if you keep doing the quests the moment you unlock them. Plus you're kind of inclined to do woodcutting and fishing there anyway.
---
But yes, dailies is the worst thing about ironmeme in rs3. It gets pretty ridiculous if you really care about efficiency.
---
So theres not 1 single grind on your ironman that you don't like doing?
---
You could play a main account exactly like your ironman, but skip the part you don't like. Nothing would be devalued, nothing would be lost.  The only value in your character is your interest and whatever the gold farmers will pay.
---
If you just dig the helmet by your name, well you do you.  But people with self control can do the grinds they want to on their regular account and skip the terribly tedious unfun ones using gold they earned while grinding.
---
Ironmen literally remove an entire facet of the game and don't contribute to the economy.  They should just play offline and save the $$ every month.
---
r/cutenoobs
---
I think so. Way back when I first started I thought it was supposed to be a pickaxe. I always saw the icon on the River Lum in Lumbridge, at the canoe station, and was confused why there weren’t rocks to mine lol.
---
Making money getting a fashionscape cape or doing boring content to min max? I'd choose skilling even if it's slow as shit.
---
aw shit, i need to wait for the birthday event in a few weeks to get the last piece to complete my fashionscape..
---
I tried that but it doesn’t recognize my email. 
---
[This is the ride!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShGRWM9dNy8)
---
I understand the bar as its the only one in lumbridge/draynor so chaps from both villages can go for a beer after work.
---
Just watched this today! Loved it man keep it up
---
I liked red cape Swampletics better
---
Paying for membership solely with GP is totally doable and gets easier the more you unlock things to the point where you just generate your bond money through passive things like Miscellania + daily battlestaves. That's what I've been doing for over a year. If you enjoy the game at all then you really should make membership one of your goals. 
---
1/6 chance to mine an ore one tick faster than the rune pick. So it’s definitely worth the investment if you’re going for 99 
---
RS3 is a different game though?? 
---
thank fucking god
---
awhile ago he posted a vlog about it 
---
Check his post history. I’m pretty sure it’s real. Although the image is kind of confusing :/
---
Photoshopped lol
---
I like this idea but I think it may break the game. For example needing 175qp for RFD, some accounts could end up with vastly lower qp with the gloves
---
Got mine at 1 KC venny. Such a dope feeling. Ran out the wildly so fast lmao
---
Leaping trout seems to have its own thing
---
to buy one you gotta spam at the ge for a bit which is xp waste
---
Up to 6% longer, actual time depends on what method you do. If you do MLM that could be like 15 hrs more? If you do something like Blast Mining or Granite, there'd be little if any difference.
---
INSANE LOOT BTW
---
I have been playing for 7 weeks and have 4.7m xp, i dont play a stupid amount. It's all about what skills you are doing. 
---
damage is halved during that phase, i think piety is still worth using though
---
don't really use twitter =/ i guess i'm just gonna lose the account. sucks
---
I'm mostly just confused about what is actually old school and what has been voted in. It's been so long since I've played I look at things, and can only question whether they used to be there you know? Obviously I remember some major landmarks all of Falador, West of Varrock(GE, Juliet, Gertrude), North Varrock, etc.
---
id advise having fun but that may be difficult if ur stuck in an rs3 mindset
---
Yo I'm 27, pretty much immature and too horny for my own good and yes I laughed a this post. I was partly joking. And people call me sense ...
---
Never a real point to fish sharks directly. If you want to afk fish then do monks. They’re decent food to stockpile and 35k exp/hr. If you need sharks for high level food then fish minnows at the fishing platform and trade them with Kylie Minnow for sharks. But that’s far from afk.
---
If you wanna break it just unsubscribe, what I did with Hearthstone to break that. Surprisingly RS is a bit better of a interest because it doesn't hurt my wallet so much.
---
Yup, that would be why. 
---
Mind blown.
---
Imagine being this desperate to fit in. Fucking loser!
---
There's the issue of completing quests then reversing the quest prerequisite stats after the quest.
---
Your entire argument revolves around uniques coming in price goes down you dense motherfucker. I've just given you 2 places in high usage with uniques coming out of the ass where prices still funnily stable or rise.
---
Let me guess. R u also a massive whale?
---
Would be so funny if Jagex were to lock uniques behind skilling.
---
Imagine having a mark of grace system in woodcutting that gives bis weapon to kill Ents/Tree Spirits and other goodies.
---
The Mark of Grace system is such a good way to make skilling worth doing and I'm surprised they havent added it to the resource gathering skills that get devalued by slayer.
---
I wouldnt mind Zulrah dropping a ton of sharks if it meant that I could still make decent money fishing sharks by getting skilling exclusive items.
---
Do you have gangbangs?
---
He's also really young
---
Well, that’s not entirely true. There are many more scholarship opportunities for traditional students as opposed to students who go back to college later in life. However, the opportunity to make a career with YouTube does not happen for everyone so could well be worth it for him.
---
https://imgur.com/a/vzeo9Qt
---
Tbh quest your ass off and start slayer once you’ve got about 65ish melees. Go for untradeables like bgloves, torso, and firecape. 
---
&gt;there are people voting who clearly shouldn't be voting and Jagex need to do shit about it.  
---
People don't just lose a vote in real life because you don't like what they have to say or they don't vote with the same affiliation as you. 
---
yeah the weapon unbalance is kinda crazy
---
Oh heck :c

When I restarted I focused slayer to start. It really helped get the cashflow to skill/quest without worries

He did it himself, he used to work for Jagex as Mod Ronan and really likes Runelite because he can fuck with it as a developer.

I don't think alching gives you ranged xp. 
---
No. I just wanted to point out the hypocrisy some people have in their reactions as they watch streamers who charge money to watch other people's videos.
---
I love having bgloves with trash stats and no actual good gear.
---
I wouldn’t recommend it. You’re gonna need the best gear possible and massive rng help against the two most mechanically intensive quest bosses. It’s not impossible but you’d be fighting a huge uphill battle

The guildmaster of the farm guild gives you contracts which are essentially slayer tasks but for farming. 
---
There is a longtime runescape player who, in order to present himself with a new challenge, created a character named Swampletics.
---
For this character, he setup a bunch of rules essentially saying that he will level every skill on that character to 99 without leaving Morytania (sans a small number of exceptions).
---
He is popular because he's charismatic and his streams are surprisingly fun.
---
Lore doesn't say they don't have them

But you have 3 skills left

Welcome to the light side, brother. Your long term goal should be completing Recipe for Disaster. 
---
In the meantime you can set your own goals, like getting base 60's in atk, str, and def so you can equip dragon.

Sucks i wasnt picked for the giveaway :/

ew look at this ehp grinding virgin, can smell your chair all the way here

Damn good start and really entertaining. Great job

You could do Wintertod for early gp. Its the firemaking boss in zeah. Use games neklace to get there.

Yea man, 1 month after hydra release people just suddenly decide to farm hydra more than usual
---
Personally I would level up your melee stats by training slayer, what I did is got all my skilling stats to quest reqs (So most relatively low). I got barrows gloves and fire cape around 100 combat and all I did was slayer and nmz to imbue my items. I got 99 slayer yesterday and the profits where around 185m. Now with those profits and the bank I already have I can take a long break from combat and pump gp into skilling. I have 99 con, herb and crafting banked. I'm currently going to work in specific hard diaries and push towards 2k total level. So if you can take anything from that sweet, also feel free to add me in game Est 199O (last character is an "oh" not a zero). Cheers bud and good luck.

It's kinda common sense bro...

Hard to call It doing what he loves when he stops the moment it becomes no longer profitable.
---
What's good my bwana?
---
I like it but I wouldn't want a limit on the lamps. I'd want to see an account go to max from start then back to 1 then back to max.
---
Its really not too bad and doesnt take more than a few hours
---
RemindMe! 2 days
---
Be sure to watch UIM NO DOORS
---
No. Small quests like Romeo and Juliet have their place in the game as quests that give good QP as their reward instead of gp/xp.
---
Gonna share this with c cc buddies :D

Or it's literally been spelled Tienamen in everything I've ever read it in ever until that Reddit post today so it's not uncommon for someone to assume that's it's accepted spelling and pronunciation in English. I could be wrong tho

Literally was told to “get a torso” today.
---
Really wanted to tell him to sit and spin its wasted xp.
---
This guy gets it
---
Bcp &gt; torso. Sorry torso manlets.
---
It's at 2:28/2:29 if you care enough to have another look 
---
So I relapsed and I started a new account for the first time in like a decade. I'm playing with friends and they told me to do waterfall quest since it boosted me to 30 Attack and Strength right away. Any other go to quests I should do that'll give me either a huge boost in levels for certain skills? Or quests that give me access to things that are really good to have early game that I might not know about? 
---
This is the same as the trout post.
---
I mean since when to games usually ever use logic for stuff like this? doesn't osrs have the same issue?
---
That assumption doesn't really matter if you're reallocating the quest points to other, more deserving quests. If a player likes the game, they're going to complete all the f2p quests anyway. If they don't, they won't. This stops bots from getting the fastest amount of quest points in the shortest amount of time, without increasing the time it takes to get the total amount of quest points. 
---
it’s real. I was there and he LOVES gems

If you have an internal cape you skip all these criticisms. In fact, you can wear any of these with infernal and be shielded from criticisms.

I just did it 2 hours ago. You can do it

Theres not much in this game that you can eat raw. Mostly fruits or vegetables. If you ever have another question you can PM me in game if I'm on. RSN: thorem
---
He hasn’t said he’d max though right? His end goal is theatre of blood
---
Not gonna lie, I made this low effort meme then googled “swampletics” (thinking to myself, surely it’s some sort of wetland themed Olympic event right?) Then proceeded to watch all 10 episodes in one sitting and it was the best thing that’s happened in recent memory. I see what all the fuss was about. Settled is a god among plebs. 
---
There is plenty of time for it. Try doing it when you have to work 40+ hours a week. Also, why does it matter what he does with his free time? Clearly if the guy is playing an online game and streaming or making videos he has a social life. Even if he didn't have a social life at all why would it matter? I love how some people think it's wrong to not be out in the world "doing things". Like whatever it is you do is so much better than what someone else does. Unless you are out there actively trying to make society a better place (and not by pushing your own ideals, but actually improving quality of life) then you aren't doing shit either.  I played a ton of video games in HS and I still did plenty of other things that weren't games. What do you do with your personal time? How do you have time for it? Your statements are not only confusing, but don't sound well thought out. 
---
Let’s be honest here. This is Ironman but you only have to grind for pvm drops lol
---
"Holy shit this is embarrassing I feel sick for being here"
---
Let me think--this was back in 2016 sometime, so it's been a while! As I recall, I started that grind at 70 cooking. I did wines to 80, then I did monkfish/sharks/whatever the other high level fish are at the Rogues' Den to 99, I think. Myths' Guild wasn't a thing and I didn't have the favor for the Hosidius range at the time so Rogues' Den was my best bet. It was pretty fast overall. I'm not sure it was actually a week--it might have been closer to two or two and a half--but it was definitely somewhere around there.

This is an update for normies too. Now sand will come from people casting lunars, not from bots hopping at charters or from dailyscsape.

It's part of RuneLite, tells me how many kills left on a task.

Firstly, clip cutters like these are a win-win for content creators. The streamers get more exposure, and they also have incentive for more entertaining streams even if they currently have low view count. It's also not taking clicks/revenue away from the streamers since most of their money is twitch based.
---
Secondly, RSMoments is one of the good guy clip cutters. He asks streamers to use their content before it even gets in the videos.

---
Witch's House gives a good amount of HP XP  
---
Tree Gnome Village, The Grand Tree, Vampire Slayer, and Fight Arena all give a good amount of XP rewards as well (Will put you over 40 attack)
---
Really you should do as many quests early on as you can stomach, the XP rewards are great at low levels but really don't mean anything later on and there's a lot of content unlocked by quests that will be helpful to you. Honestly starting your account by going for quest cape will give you a pretty big advantage over just regularly grinding and gives you a bit of direction if you're one of those people that never knows what to do.

I know a guy so it must be not rare but not insane.

Well now you can just pay and save a lot of time.

Idk exactly, it was just something to prevent him from

being too easy I guess. I understand lowering his magic level so that tbow didn’t make him more farmable than he already was, but making his magic resist so high seems silly.

How? They’ll still be buckets of sand...

Sandstone is 35 and Granite is 45. In the grand scheme of things that is basically the same level.

He decided upon leaving, he still does some work for Jagex, but he wanted to open his schedule more.

You would need 266k lamps for every skill assuming you have exactly the  xp u need for 99. The total amount of gp that would take is 59,550,000,000,000

His party was literally open to be attended by anyone

Exactly, clues overall are a waste of time in terms of xp and gp, but they're so fun and it's like gambling where you just might hit the jackpot.

Because in game items/features/whatever shouldnt need action to be taken outside of the game to obtain.

All this preparation and jagex's code couldn't handle it, smh
---
Its not just that its ugly af and out of place
---
No you didn't.
---
Jagex already does that and it sucks. Half assed solutions that just make it worse for real players and barely make an impact on the bots. Notice how RS3 dealt with it without any of this useless showpony bullshit. 
---
because long range gives 2xp per damage, and defensive casting gives 1. 
---
Sure why not! Move anything you like to RS3, just not the other way around. 
---
Are you really saying “Jagex get your shit together” because your dumbass probably downloaded something from the internet, which ended up being a keylogger which allows the person to see your screen, get your passwords to everything, etc. this person could have watched your screen while you typed your pin in. Don’t blame Jagex for your own mistake. These types of things don’t just happen out of the blue.
---
No worries its hard to communicate with you considering you’re delusional
---
The contracts themselves are just enjoyable to do especially since all the plots are in one centralized location. It’s not about the seed packs though they are fun to open. It’s more so just seeing one big garden grow and look nice while working towards earning seeds to fight a new boss

Shut up.
---
Now, my suggestion:
---
Download an antivirus (go on filehippo.com to find a trustworthy one for free. Maybe malwarebytes), run a deep scan on your computer. Chances are your computer has been keylogged. Remove the virus, ensure it’s gone by checking your task manager for running processes that were removed by the antivirus. Once it’s gone, change your passwords to literally everything and make it unique with capital letters, special characters, etc. ONCE you have all of this done, let me know and I’ll hook you up with some rebuild money.

I'm another guy, while I agree he can go to school later I think that last part is misleading. Abstaining from school in non extraordinary circumstances is not good. There are very specific fields it's ok, though even then only with certain contexts. One of them being business for example. If you wanna do anything STEM related good luck getting hired cause your priorities are straight. You need the degree or it's almost an instant no.

They made the right choice using Gordon for the premiere. It gave the channel tons of traction for the upcoming season. I doubt I would’ve watched a single video if it wasn’t for the viral premier. It’s a marketing tactic and it worked.

Well, even if I gave someone the answers, there should have been systems in place, like there are for literally every single other service that's out there, for example, if I live in aus, and all of a sudden I'm logging in fro Venezuela then it should probably cause an automatic lockout of the account. Or even an email saying, hey click here if you wanna disable all the stuff protecting your account.

You could start slayer now but if you wanted to level up your melee a bit more you could always go to rock crabs since no one goes there and it's still a great place for lower levels bud.
---
I got all the 99's in a matter of 1 minute, look at Crystal math labs, the game couldn't keep up, ya it looks confusing but it was open for anyone to join. Either way if you where there it was the best of times. I just thought reddit would enjoy seeing all that. Cheers to actually playing the game now :P
---
He was a content dev on the side, though never did anything major I believe 
---
Make a gmauler and be a pure at level 50. It's not that hard if you want to PK with a low-barrier.
---
If you want to PK at level 105-126, then yes, that's what you get. Every game is the same way. No one should expect to play **any** game at the highest level of depth before even learning the basics. 
---
Flicking all slayer tasks is pure autism

For example OPs post was in reference to nostalgic location changes and how everyone (on here) is throwing a fit about it which is stupid, however the ideas that players have come up with to silence the Reeeeee's are actually good ideas. Granted there have been some updates that I question but I havent hit anything that was a hard no for me yet.

Posting my comment from youtube: 
---
"Wow you mean you can't keep posting these derivative, formulaic, no effort videos and keep raking in the cash? We're all so hurt.. Maybe try some editing or something other than just slapping 20 twitch clips together in a row and calling it a day. This sob story seems disingenuous considering you have a channel full to the brim of 10:XX minute long videos with the same colored text titles for the past 50 videos, you knew exactly what you were doing. You can't milk ad revenue day after day after day then get all up in arms when Youtube decides your channel has little to no original value. Which is 100% true.﻿"
---
I mean look at this shit: 
---
[Same fucking titles, same fucking thumbnails, same content day after day.](https://i.imgur.com/UlUUQ2F.jpg)
---
I don't have anything against clipper youtubers, there is a way to do it without being a jackwagon. You have to take a backseat and realize that other people are providing all of your content for you. Look at Synapse, popular League of Legends clipper. Different unique thumbnail every time, videos aren't 10 min and 32 milliseconds long, actually edits his videos in a unique way every time. Fuck Runescape Moments.
---
go check kempq. He jus started completely fresh because his all other accounts got deleted. Youll get a few tips on how fast he is progressing.
---
This man capes
---
How about this, to make it the same as is, the three quest would give you  1 qp each and  for each other quest until 4 or 5 qp would give you an additional? Without those three counting for it.
---
So you could do all three and one more quest to get to 7, which would at least double the time required to make a sucide account. And anyone who now has 32 qp would not get affected.
---
Another similar option would be so they only give their qp once you have that much qp from non high qp quests.
---
Thanks
---
No. Does it matter anyway?
---
Whatt...?? Why not make a normal?
---
I prefer the Ironman gamemode because I can 'flex' on it and it's a bit more challenging.
---
He asked permission.
---
Honestly; No.
---
You sound entitled to sonething the Iron Man was made to NOT have.
---
You want to trade and beat the purpose of doing everything yourself as a true Iron Man? Regular accounts do that.
---
 Thats like saying im a girl even when i have a peepee
---
One of the challenge is "not trading"
---
You Won't Believe When He Gets His Ad Revenue Destroyed OSRS (10:02)
---
I see some suggestions to do it differently. But in reality i would go for this. Mainly because i think questpoints make no sense whatsoever. Some quests i take half a day to complete casually i get 1qp, others are likely: walk here, talk to that, make item, go back. 3qp and a shit ton of xp.
---
I can go for some redistribution even if it is only for f2p.
---
As for the change affecting existing accounts. I suggest just having it apply to new accounts if possible. As to not affect running quests with qp requirements.
---
Barrows teleport is only 1,045 gp or something around there, barrows tabs are around 2.7-3k. So if you average 12-20k in supplies per barrows run you can make that 10-18k just by using the actual teleport. 
---
The only requirement is 79 mage as you can use a magic potion(they are only 220 gp for a 4 dose) I usually buy up a massive amount of magic potion(1)'s for 30-42gp each once a month and I have enough to last me a while.
---
No but if you accidentally log out at crabs it's OK, whereas if you log out at NMZ it's another 25k to restart etc. That's the reason I was keeping away. 
---
I mean sure you can get good RNG like this, but it's far too inaccurate compared to sang staff during range/melee phases. The average kill time is definitely lower without tbow than with.
---
It's also true
---
It's my reddit name 'Z i g g e h' plus if you see my other posts as well you see the rsn

Good idea, sand crabs don't have enough HP.

There are no issues here, it doesn't need to be related to mm 1 or 2 and you don't need to fight a giant penguins. You're thinking far too deep into it.

crispmas
---
It is? I tried it on osrs and thought it was extremely slow. Maybe I'll give it a shot on rs3 when I've got the qc on my main.
---
I've personally heard use whip/blow pipe and Salve(EI). I tested it out and I 3 shot any skeleton with like 90% reliability, occasionally 4 or 5 hit. So just do triple skeletons and go for the meta standard of 88-88.6%. Maybe someone else has heard otherwise, but your DPS should always be better on skeletons with the Salve amulet.
---
also yes.
---
Live in the moment my man
---
Already failed the poll
---
Now you just need to level that defence and you're maxed.
---
Congrats, you certainly earned it!
---
Now tele the fuck out of here:)

Just look at the top twitch clips of the day instead then, that's all RS moments did.
---
Why not get varrock teleport portal in your house?
---
For me to vote it would just be the 7qp threshold, the original points being changed wouldn’t feel right to me. That threshold was made in the past few years and 7 was probably a randomly picked number so I think it’d be the least controversial area to change. Even making it 8-10 would be a big difference for those making multiple accounts a day
---
*swings wooden club around*
---
Because it is scummy? I am on other side compared to him. I'm creating content, not stealing it.

This isn't even useful, he just didn't use defensive styles. Defense is a good skill to actually have for most end game content

Congrats man. To celebrate this accomplishment, come trade me in game. I got 5 fire runes and a nature rune for you to alch yourself.
---
Jokes aside, noice.
---
Gz! You can pay the farmer 200gp to get rid of trees after checking their health just so you know.
---
pretty sure you didnt get a 95 jad kills as task?
---
Let me tell you a story of the time when I would buy and cook lobsters for profit in early rs2
---
That seems painful
---
You're wasting time somewhere, you should be able to get 50k+. I was able to without using MK/AHK so if you're using these then something's definitely up. Maybe record a few runs so we can see what's happening and where you're losing time?
---
Also, take caution. AHK is ban-able, and the 1:1 rule is more of a guideline than a hard rule. 
---
Y'all are bitch ass bwanas
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** Dead1ift! ^(hug)
---
lmao mom's credit card
---
Filthy bwana lover
---
Jokes on you, my run energy is covered. No way you can hack me without that. 
---
Fucking oof 
---
I would pay 2b for sure for 1 def b gloves.
---
Well, I  have spent 13m on herblore for this clue. Totally worth it.)
---
Downvote the post!
---
Oof.

Well, I have spent 13m on herblore for this clue. Totally worth it.)

What is Jagex customer support? Never heard about it
---
don't bot next time buddy. When it's permanent for macro, you know it's bad. Do you have authenticator on our account? if the answer is yes, you botted; if the answer is no, your account got compromised
---
Yeah, gonna flex on 'dem fishes. 
---
Great game mode idea and a great quality video!
---
I want to try and do Zulrah because the scales are so expensive now I have 86 range and 63 magic. With a blow pipe and ibans staff can it be done?
---
It is. And I love it, favorite interface through runescape history. 
---
Sell, that shit was 82m a couple days ago now it’s like 73-74m
---
The anti A Friend series.
---
Also, whilst he's at it, the plugin should filter out and remove and trade offer chats &amp;options to make it impossible to trade someone else.
---
you don't have a goal, that's the only reason 
---
Only if you put your draw distance on high or ultra. Keep your draw distance on medium or low and you won't have this problem.
---
Sick m8
---
Would be nice to see more birds nests from wc since most people afk and wouldn’t pick them up anyways rewards those who aren’t. More gems from mining. Maybe caskets for fishing.. items like rabbits foot makes the chance of getting an egg from a nest only 5% more likely buffing things like this would be nice during QoL updates
---
Fucking oof.
---
I'm 102 Combat with no FireCape (I use Ardy Cape), Barrow Gloves (Combat Brace) or fighter torso :c
---
The innocence..spend some time on reddit or in larger groups and see how common that type of thinking is
---
HaHAA!
---
How much gp is that
---
How is the n+1th error polynomial calculated when computing Taylor polynomials?
---
That's.... The point.
---
At first I was like not bad for that KC, then I saw your inv and was like wait a fucking minute this sick Cunt is a ultimate Ironman 
---
why not have anyone who started the quest can still complete it even if they don’t have the QP requirement anymore? I think that would affect a very limited number of players.
---
U foking wot m8
---
Would be cool if the plugin could be uploaded on github! Neat idea, if I could play it I would really play it!
---
You can't say the B word thats racist.
---
Holy Moley!

Didn't even notice. Jesus.
---
You said it, man.
---
What is a suicide bot and why do they have a limited lifetime? 
---
Glad to hear that clue hunter got what he deserved 
---
If you have barrows globes, you’ll know how to get a rock cake. You won’t need any ingredients this time though. Go back to the dwarf from the RFD quest near white wolf mountain in the underground passage, ask him to make you another cake. You WILL need something like ice gloves, or use telegrab and kill an ice fiend to be able to eat it. Either that or leave it in your bank for about half an hour. Hope this helped
---
Yeah, if this is bad, he shouldn't go meet the Ali's.
---
I don't really believe this argument. I'm sure there are some people that find a new streamer through these YT videos and start watching their channel, but I think most people were fine just watching the YT videos. In which case I don't see how they are helping the streamers at all. He is taking their clips, isn't sharing any revenue, judging by socialblade has &lt; 100k subscribers so isn't very big at all. This is the same thing as unpaid internships saying 'well look at all the exposure you're getting!' but it doesn't actually equate to jack shit at the end of the day.
---
-said the sub full of autistic white manchildren

Free 99 Magic, because any xp while sleeping/working etc is better than zero.

inb4 people get mad at someone dying in the wilderness when he could of easily not opened the casket and also running through a pvp hotspot (black chins)
---
Are you asking on reddit because we can’t report your rsn for scamming from here?
---
100% Worth it. Grats on the pet mate
---
They eventually get reported and their accounts are banned. That way they get the items, sell on the ge and trade to another account and the chain goes on and on
---
Gtzzzz welcome to the most hated account build on rs 
---
It's not like there is a downside to having more quest points. More quest points is always better. Being able to do RFD without specific combat xp giving quests could be an advantage for some pures but losing quest points doesn't affect them.
---
as an Ironman, could you revert the 3000-6000 pure essence scaling back to 5.... thanks
---
Locator orb from DS2. AKA better rock cake for dharok-ing.

haHAA
---
rsn is Farr, added to post

Just click the button. 
---
I disagree with this, f2p definitely is a bit content dry compared to members but it's perfect for getting a feel of the game. Completing all the f2p quests and getting 40s in everything minus prayer and maybe rc was, for me at least, a great way to prepare for the members content. 
---
Are you flexing on me with that membership duration?
---
If you do start, be wary of scammers. If anyone says they’re doubling money, they aren’t. 
---
If my job was to literally take 10 mins getting clips from twitch and 30 mins putting it together, sure... but that’s not a job that’s a fucking side hobby.
---
You get trade access after 24 hours played or becoming p2p so the "reward" isn't significant at all.
---
Love you 
---
I love you both
---
Why?
---
It's good that there are now 3 more f2p quests since osrs came out.
---
Haha, he might not, but I can! I'll just replace that little detail with your total experie-- _oh no_
---
Hey man you should come write some software for me. I won't pay you anything of course, but the real world experience will look really good on your resume.
---
I think you sound a little colder and more jaded than you think.
---
PM me to trade ign, I'd love to get on and chat while we grind out a few levels in whateverthefuck
---
If he makes money off of youtube/streaming he won't need a scholarship
---
Mate you simply dont have the stats to make 3.5m quickly on F2P, Buy membs for a month, get all your skills up then if you think you can sustain it start grinding for bonds 
---
Very cute dog!
---
Good, maybe stop stealing creators content to line your own pockets... smh.
---
It really depends on how much time you can put into the game, with your current stats you could kill green dragons. 
---
Do that until you reach enough go to cover your bond, then do slayer whilst getting your farming levels up until you can do herbs such as Ranarrs.
---
Then do herb runes between slayer tasks.
---
That is personally what I would do but there are many way to make money in this game, watch YouTube guides also they will help a lot. 
---
Good luck.
---
I would agree with you 99.9% of the time but the guy has 125k subs and a very popular series. If there was ever a time to give it a go, this is it.
---
oh no i am members, sorry forgot to mention. 
---
Idk who hurt him, but I know who hurt you 🙄
---
Is that for the trident?
---
RS3 already did prif so should osrs just leave that huge fucking blank section on the map as well? 
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. 5-10 minutes of work per day can bet 1m+ if you flip properly.  It's how I've made all my money.
---
If they wanted to play ironman they would...The GE is there for a reason, regardless of your level.
---
I will never understanding ambushing people who are clearly not other pkers.
---
Saying that someone elses way of playing the game makes them have no life when your still playing the exact same game is basically a cry to the world that you hate yourself.
---
If you dont think this unironically then youre probably not the brightest person.
---
No, my point in the wild was to finish my Earth warrior task. Not to be hunted down several times by pures who aren't good enough to fight other pkrs.
---
I didn't lost anything besides time walking back to warriors the 4 times I was killed. But I sure as hell will always vote to screw pkers in polls now.
---
Why not just raise the qp req instead of fucking up every classic qp reward?
---
Why are you downvoted? Almost 6000 accounts already and will be 10000 at the end of the year lol.
---
5300 kc, no pet, 16 jars :)
---
Rip the most retarded titles on Youtube
---
The old accounts are banned very quickly, so they will just move on to the next account.
---
99s*
---
Because the accounts are banned quickly, therefore named "suicide bots". The entire point is to mass-produce accounts and earn as much money as possible before getting banned.
---
You're allowed to spell out "nigga" and "nigger".
---
Hunting red and black chinchompas is easy noney, requires a bit of hunter though but its a fast skill to level. Early mornings are nice if you can play then, or generally low actove odd hours. I went from 76 or 77 hunter to 80 this morning and made around 3.5m, started off with red then went to try black.
---
While training hunter I'd advoce doing MLM during your first bond or bonds to maintain it. Gl sir!
---
Any idea why the clay price has dropped so much? It's made humidifying clay a really good money maker but I'm worried it'll impact the price of Soft Clay soon.

Max damage output for lowest combat, attack is 75 for elder maul and AGS
---
Some exposure is a million times better than no exposure when you're trying to get your feet off the ground in steaming. And 100k subs is a lot when your entire market is just people that play runescape. If those people were making youtube videos themselves and they asked him to stop stealing clips that would be one thing, but these people weren't getting revenue from their clips. Most however were getting viewers from people that hadn't watched them before.
---
That's like opening a 143 gp clue. At least one is OSRS but still... 
---
What about features? (Sorry don't mean to be bugging y'all for a whole patch list here) Is there a thread that has all the major changes listed?
---
2100 total is the Req. for Smiley in Olympus CC.
---
If you ever get your account back, feel free to apply on the forums!

I would go one further and say that Prince Ali Rescue is worth 1 or 2, and then give Ernest the Chicken 3.
---
I mean dogs is in their name, so it would make since...
---
You chose to limit yourself by being a lvl3. You choose to limit yourself by being unable to get anima seeds.
---
Fucking finally this content stealer can die, thank god
---
That's for GWD though. Not because of fashionscape.
---
Because they are *low level*
---
I would say the only difference is that there's less than 20 streamers he uses clips from. If one of the streamers did not want to be in the videos I would be certain he would stop using clips of them. The reason why streamers do not ask to not be in his videos is due to discoverability. I seen people excited that they made it into one of his videos. I seen small streamers getting featured for being scammed and then the next day viewers of the videos made a donation to him from what he lost. Recently he brought attention to the cheating clients. Personally, I hated runescape moments for his clickbait stuff but after deciding to watch one I noticed it's more than selecting the top clips of the day. 
---
Overall, I don't see it as stealing if the people hes using clips from is ok with it.
---
gp.
---
Do you at least have a bonecrusher?
---
If you're not a hcim you can just pull the die and tele back for your stuff strat

But does he pk is the real question 
---
Bah my eyes. I didn't realize there was a purple button. I thought there were only three. My bad.
---
Add Canadian 2k I have ornate bgs and arc light, no Deb tho :( I’d like to start doing corp! 
---
I have exactly 176 qp and would have 170 qp under this system, I really wouldn't want anyone to do more quests than I already have just for bgloves.
---
&lt;3
---
This makes me sick to my stomach lol.
---
I think it would only be useful for ironman* also it would probably ruin the prices of some jewelr
---
to answer your first question no, dwh is better unless you need to spec something many many times (aka corp)
---
Look up ingus uim he’s got a ports only uim series or something like that. It’s pretty good
---
Suicide bots do highly botted activities which get them banned within 72hours. The bot does quests so they can use the Grand exchange and sell their goods before being banned.
---
Suicide bots are F2P and typically do the following activities.
---
- Cut Oak Trees
---
- Collect Cowhides
---
- Collect potatoes
---
- Fill buckets/bowls/vials with water
---
- Mine Clay
---
- Mine Iron
---
- Smelt Gold rings or amulet (u)
---
Since last sommer. Just about the only thing i’ve did in the game since then. #Moleboii

Good, and hopefully the shitty meme dies with it.

Not proud, indifferent really.

It will remind me to alch myself.

Ask me to explain more if needed

But how will anyone else know about their limitations without that sexy Ironman chat icon :(

/s
---
Also it’s basically one pickaxes per 20 bloodhounds
---
You're using RuneLite, which has built-in screenshot capability and even automatically takes a screenshot when you get a pet, yet you decided to go with a picture of your screen.
---
Ikr. -_-
---
The traditional balancing of quest points seems to be good rewards and Less qp or bad rewards and more qps.  Dragon slayer only gives 1 quest point because it already gives several other rewards while Romeo and Juliet gives no reward out side of quest points. (5 may still be too many, maybe lower it to 3-4 but otherwise I wouldn’t mess too much with it)
---
Whip, so I can have some fun with my girlfriend.
---
Should’ve kept 4 of the combat stats too, just got max attack and hp before.

I hunt farming pet and would advise looking into seaweed farming. Ive done 21 hespori kills and got 90 more seeds banked, most of them were obtained from seaweed patches.

85fm at wintertodt and 82 thieving from blackjacking is practically all of it. Some of is it profit over buying a shit ton of runes at mage bank.

I wouldn't quit the game if I couldn't use runelite anymore, but I wouldn't be VERY annoyed at all the features I'd be missing for the coming week.. Until I'd get used to regular rs again. 
---
Fuck that guy.
---
Sorry big noob here. So I understand a pure account is when you don't level up your defense, but what's the point of it tho ? Do you get a bonus in attack or something when doing it ? Sorry 
---
I wonder where all these people are that actually watch any of the already saturated tens of thousands of hcim and uim series out there. It's just another restricted series and it's touted on this sub as if it's the second coming of The Godfather
---
Tell him to stop abusing people then
---
I mean the whole pure pking thing in runescape is kind of toxic that’s why everything favoring pures is downvoted in polls, they’re there to no honor pk, rush and kill lower level pkers or pvmers in the windy 
---
well first it's just a comic, I think you missed the joke on that... and there are 150,000 people playing at the same time, most probably doing the same thing getting the same results on clue scrolls.   
---
So if one guy's going through there house looking for clues and killing wizards in their attics, good chance other people are too.
---
The British pronunciation (remember, the game is British) of Ardougne is ‘Arr-doyn’ .. at least that’s what it should sound like! Lots of youtubers butcher this pronunciation
---
Another common on is ‘a-biss-all’ whereas lots pronounce it ‘ab-is-all’ 
---
The ‘h’ in Herblore is a hard sound, whereas lots of youtubers pronounce it as the Americanised ‘er-blore’ eg a soft ‘h’
---
Read that 1 unread message please

I feel for you, clicking the top clips by category link on twitch is hard

I think I fished lobsters for like 2 weeks straight just to get my first whip. I was so happy with it, I think prior to 2009 I never had more than 2mil bank at any given point for 2-3 years. Having a bgs at about 36mil was a distant dream for me.
---
Actually you only need to do romeo and juliet, cooks assistant, and witch's potion. I think that's even quicker than goblin diplomacy.
---
You said making money out side of pvm, not low skill requirement money makers. Mediums are about 2m an hour including ranger drops with a good set up. And an experience runner for zmi can make up to. 3m an hour but that requires 75 rc. I’m just saying you don’t need combat to make gp/h that’s all. 
---
Oh my god poor guy... years wasted 
---
If this is actually in the game that's wack as fuck lmao
---
the people who gives a shit about game integrity and not only whats benefitting them alone
---
I live with him and we sit and play OSRS together, under the same IP and ISP no VPN.
---
We were playing last night and then again this morning before work, we got to work and he received the email that his account had yet again been banned after about an hour after logging out.
---
After the first ban, I suggested doing a virus scan on the Mac \*possible keylogger on the device?!?\* 
---
But nothing came of that and he would check skills to see if there was a difference from when he last logged in \*being low level this would be easy to spot\*  but again nothing that we could both see.
---
*botting: minor*
---
If you're in nmz you can't see them typing... If you saw them spamming outside nmz it means you were not in CMB and could've easily just reported?
---
Ok been away a few months and decided to get back into it today, after a few hours my right click button suddenly stopped working on all accounts &amp; clients. The mouse works perfectly fine in other applications/desktop, any ideas. Tried playing with double left clicks but its infuriating. 
---
He said he was going to address this in the first ep but I guess he forgot.
---
In any case, he's aware of Framed's series.
---
But its an eyesore
---
Heat that shit right up to supper.
---
I completely agree with you, I watch similar videos for league of legends, but they have channels that aren't as cancerous. RuneScape is just not popular enough yet to have a good clipper on YT. I get that it fills a niche but someone needs to rise up and do that with better quality videos. Its clear to me at least that RS moments doesn't care about the streamers or community past what money he can make off of them. What value is he adding to the community by aggregating videos and profiting off their reupload? Like others in this thread have said you can browse recent twitch clips. If you enjoy those streamers then support them by using twitch.
---
adderall
---
Even though he puts the words on the screen for you to read as well
---
obby or dragon chain
---
You should train your defence! Training defence allows you to take less damage from your enemies in combat. Additionally, players with a high defence level can use strong armor like adamant, rune, or even the rare and expensive dragon armor set!
---
He is an UIM locked exclusively to content in morytania. UIM means he can't trade or bank any items. 
---
Thats literally the reason why pures dont get 61attack, 2 defence, 14 prayer. And you got downvoted LMAO the reddit circle jerk is real
---
Well, I am not sure if raising the total level req will change the Yes mentality much. Also, I'd argue it is the more time you spend with the community more so than the more time you spend ingame. I'd say I'm more likely to learn about the game chatting on external sites (like reddit) or looking things up on the wiki than ingame. And if you are chatting with players, it can often be when you are just bank standing rather than as you're gaining levels, so Time Played would be a bigger factor than Total Level if you want to go by that.
---
something called nmz? 
---
Fair i haven't bother since pkers always know when im there get like one catch and ice barrage.
---
Do you even play the game?
---
Pures like these are usually trophy accounts 
---
Idea: pay Max cash stack for an instanced entire world 
---
He’s locked to content that most people don’t know about/use. He is super detailed and it’s refreshing seeing somebody get super excited over an addy platebody instead of another “smithed for ags” video.
---
do any1 actually read the message there? i have never read a message.
---
Not much hoe
---
You mean like when you take 1 air rune, 3 fire runes, and 1 law rune when you want to go to varrock/ge 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
For me it’s a challenge thing. Pretty much a trophy account. We also get a big advantage in pvp for it
---
We're talking about a video game kids are allowed to play, not a country.
---
We don't allow 10 year olds to vote because we have standards of education, and anyone growing up in this country is likely to have received that standardized education. We don't let them vote because we know that, by that age, they will not have been through the part of their education that covers economics, politics, and the like.
---
There is no such standardized education in OSRS, nor should there be. Players are paying money to play the game, so they have a right to say what is done to it. That was the principle upon which OSRS was founded: giving all players a say.
---
Yes!
---
~~stronga~~ stronka
---
Is the bug ur gear?
---
Your friend is probably trying to not lol
---
we aight chat? CmonBruh
---
so sad to see the decline of osrs integrity over the years. the casual scapers who dont comprehend putting the game integrity before their own benefits
---
agreed
---
This is the real ezscape
---
I started my acc on Nov 20th and I have all F2P done and up to heroes done. It depends on the person really. Like guy said though, people actually doing quests wont be bothered by having a few more to do. Average players are members imo and do waterfall quest and then a bunch of members quests right off the bat anyways.
---
"clicking a tree" "clicking a rock" "clicking a brazier" "clicking anything"
---
Kinda makes me a bit sad hearing you spout misinformation. You spoke on an incredibly small % of pures, which at this point, would apply to all accounts in terms if toxity, no honor pking
---
Same, i don't play 07scape but watch 07 vids like settled's
---
what r u dumb haha y u wanna cook a cooked fish rofl
---
Go for that cape you champion! Got mine a couple days ago, looking good
---
Trophy account. Harder to do than a main account and get an advantage in pvp.
---
Months?  You can get 500+ per day with minimal effort/time.  With this buff you will easily be able to collect 5k+ buckets of sand per hour.  I have both 99 fm and crafting.  The giant seaweed and bucket packs were all the skill needed.  
---
Lmao ain’t that the truth
---
Cant trust no1 nowadays
---
I did them all the first week i made my acc lol
---
TIL gathering buckets of sand is equal to getting a tbow 
---
“All but useless” means the opposite of what you think it does
---
For pures that enjoy skilling and improving their account, it’s a trophy account. Sort of like a lvl 3 skiller, but able to do pvm and pvp in a challenging way
---
As far as i know that isn’t an option on xbox twitch. 
---
Add presets as well like eoc
---
Rng on point
---
I think that’s 50atk
---
Then you don’t have actual useful stuff, DS2 is 200 qp requirement
---
Probly not
---
Being 1 def is much more challenging. 
---
Funny comment but I think those flaws belong to you
---
In this game, there's maybe one or two things that are truly challenging. When talking here, people often interchange challenge thinking of the time spent. You're kinda splitting hairs when we all understood what he meant.
---
Ehh it’s okay. Used to use it over osb for pking when runelite wasnt a thing because there were free plugins that required osb pro on osb and mainly because it runs smoother/less cpu usage.
---
However, no real reason to use it over runelite today, the layout is very ugly and it usually takes a few hours before it’s usable after a system update.
---
Ill give it 7/10
---
Sup my bwana 
---
There are a couple of concerns I have with this. The first and the more minor one is that this would save a run back to the bank, which would devalue the Music Cape a bit. It would still be quicker to get there, but if you currently have to run from Seers to Falo, then bank, then back to Falo with the item, cutting it down to just run from Seers to Falo does save a good bit of time and makes the Music Cape save less time.
---
But my bigger concern is spoiling the Clues. They'd need to design it so you can only add the items after solving his clue or such so you couldn't tell what all the possible answers were by looking at the STASH Unit. Normal STASH Units get around this by requiring all the items and not saying what is needed; also Emote Clues tell you what you'd need. But if you could put in and withdraw items individually from a Falo STASH, it is trickier to do without spoiling what is required.
---
Ranging with void.
---
There are no better boots.
---
ur in the money bromie
---
For that reason I think fire cape and inferno cape are the best ones. Fire cape shows you’re moderately skilled and inferno shows you’re good at the game compared to a skill cape which shows you have a lot of spare time on your hands
---
Why is it that everyone is always shirtless in these old photos? :thinking:
---
Yes?
---
Konduit was never paid. All features were free and it was donation driven.
---
Jokes on you I fit all of those criteria
---
I'm at ten hours so far. Gone from 64atk to 70. Hopefully I get it before defense gets to 65 from 60
---
Just get 99 at level 40 to avoid anything.
---
ayyyyy ma bwana
---
PETA
---
Botters would just trade resources instead of gold to their mules... No real effect against botting
---
Well, what's the point of world of warcraft instead of gran turismo? You get to choose what kind of game you prefer.
---
I don't think what the title of the poll is really matters that much. I vote in all the polls, and anyone this concerned about every change being made probably does, too.
---
So it wasn't quality of life. Okay? *So what*?

For some reason i cant seem to install it, so i just play no plugin osbuddy
---
It was wrong chat 
---
shift+win+s is faster than snipping tool. Especially if you are just going to upload the image anyway (Reddit, Imgur, Discord, ...)
---
Yeah but 5 qp is ridiculous compared to the GE minimum. Should raise the qp minimum or lower Romeo qp 
---
Jackpot. Kc on those boots?
---
??
---
Coolest pet ever! I want 2 recieve one soon.
---
From the teaser the other day, this series seems really interesting. I've had an idea to do something a bit similar with an Ironman for quite some time; part of it is based on No Shop but instead of disallowing shops completely, I can only buy an item if I obtained it through other means first. So taking a similar concept to a non-Iron account and involving PvP seems really fun.
---
Genuinely curious question,  I didn’t know if there was some advantage to stopping at 99. I’ve never really tried to pk and never got that far on any pure acc build.
---
Ana in a barrel. No explanation needed.
---
This just made my entire morning hahahahahahahahahahahahaahha
---
Ok but he also compiles all the moments he seems important from the fast few streams and combines them all into one place for everyone to watch. Think of the hours you'd spend going through different streams just finding some of those PK clips, or the hours of B0aty or Skill Specs streams to find them putting their input on a topic. And then after finding all the clips, having to cut them down into a watchable 10 minute video almost daily. 
---
Yes, he's making money off of others' content, but he's also putting in a lot of effort himself to make it watchable for someone not willing or able to spend hours a day watching these streams as there is a lot of dead time on them. 
---
I just flipped the switch (flip flip)
---
Yeah, I'm okay with raising the GE minimum. But removing the only thing R&amp;J is known for (giving a bunch of qp) is kinda rubbing salt in the wound
---
We’re not taking about making the entire game 6x easier. Just an aspect of the game that literally doesn’t even earn xp. Restricting it for the sake of restricting it is stupid.
---
as I sit here grinding fishing on mobile for weeks straight to get a skillcape. 
---
you right
---
Oh sugar, what did he say?
---
How much did you make? And how long did this take
---
Why don't the mules get banned and generally accounts involved with who the gold is being transferred to?
---
Is he aware of the current state of the dumper fire his life seems to be in? And holy shit giving a guy like that money, who thought that was a good idea?
---
Hm you paying ;3
---
I had played a bit of f2p back in the day, but otherwise, I'm just good at working a wiki. :p
---
Wait. Plenty of sandstone vids circulating showing 8k Buckets of Sand per hour? How? This isn't even out yet. Do you mean people power mining and dropping the Sandstone?
---
Because that obviously doesn't account for time spent leveling mining, unlocking teleportation methods to and from the quarry or time spent walking, etc.
---
People actually do that? I thought everyone was a lazy bastard like me and just collected their daily buckets of sand... lol
---
Also Jagex conspired to shutdown Runelite over OSBuddy because OSBuddy was made by a Jagex employee who left, the same employee who reprogrammed the vanilla OSRS client to be resizable. In fact, OSBuddy's parent company is owned by the previous Jagex CEO and COO. That type of behind the scenes deal making is enough for me to never use OSBuddy. 
---
That's no different that current clues you can pre-store every STASH unit. This is to solve unnecessary bank space for what appears to be oversight. Everyone looks up what they need for the STASH units anyways so "spoiling clues" already happens.
---
They should let you combine them all and maybe give a +2 prayer bonus or something.
---

I had a dream I went clubbing with b0aty and I don't even watch him. 
---
I'm currently fuming at Hydra. I'm, as of right now, 1969 kills in, with 2 tails, 1 leather, and 13 ring pieces. No claw.  
---
Though I did get the pet, so I really shouldn't complain. :p  
---
I just did DS2 for the first time, probably one of the best quest so far. A lot of fetching at the start but the two dragon boss fights were really fun and for a noob like me it was the first real challenge the game gave me. I went at got my fire cape right afterwords. 
---
pretty sure fletching, and after make X cooking were the majority of peoples first 99
---
Idk about you, but when i was a kid i didnt put a shirt on any days i was off from school, i just woke up, got on runescape, and played all day. Nowadays, when im off from work or get home from work, i strip out of my work clothes, put on shorts, and get on my computer and play whatever game i want lol. 
---
How are those related in any way?
---
Its insanely crazy. You arent supposed to be able to reach maximum realistically, and yet, here we are, not only do we have a handful of players we have thousands of players that are maxed. It has nothing to do with there being guides for everything or the guide being out for 5 years, it has to do with the game being way easier than what it was on release.
---
If it was as fast as it was on release then we would have 300-400 players maxed by now. Not in the thousands lol.
---
Is osrs as different from rs3 as WoW is from Gran Turismo? I would think not, but I don't actually know. I'm just wondering what the difference is between them considering they've updated 2007 rs far past 2007.
---
Lmao that's way too high.  This game is supposed to be friendly and accessible to all, not just no life NEETs.  Everyone's opinion on the future of the game is just as important.
---
You should just doh the guardians. Although you will always hit a 0 the defense reducing effect still takes place and always beats out using the dragon pic spec.
---
Or just make the trade requirement 24h playtime? Or even 48h.
---
Doesn't mess with quests and real players are not very affected.
---
That’s why we have OSRS Mobile now
---
He didn’t watch the hard R
---
what are you doing in my swamp &gt;:(
---
\#TeamNoCape
---
just playing the game is an alcoholics paradise
---
Ring of charos(a). Imagine the possibilities.
---
why shouldn't it realistically be possible? sure when the gowers made the game they didn't expect it, but at the end of the day its just a time consuming grind
---
They really shouldn't instance gwd. Plus a big drain on net resources. 
---
Also OSBuddy is fully closed while runelite is partielly open source. Matthew on the osbuddy is known to harass and hack accounts before. Its why they renamed OSBuddy from Orion.
---
Real life tough guy holy shit dude. Captain minority is here to beat my ass irl. So scared dude. Alch yourself lmfao. 
---
True I’m not saying inferno doesn’t take a lot of time. Just sayin there’s more to it than mindlessly dumping hours into it
---
whats the name i wanna look him up
---
I'd like to interject. RuneLite is partially open source.
---
Were you in pvp world?
---
Hop?
---
Yeah and maxing prayer before there were alters. Dude was a legend.
---
So, let's summarize. We are comparing:
---
* 2k/hr buying from shops
---
* 6k/hr or 10k/hr at 76 Mining with a Rune Pickaxe, Camulet, 3-tick Mining, Elite Western Diaries.
---
And people are upset about that? Sorry, but I'm not too upset about people getting Buckets of Sand faster with all that goes into it. Frankly, skilling *should* be faster than buying from shops. 
---
But okay, let's just say it's too much higher. Vote no. Give feedback saying it's too fast. Why complain about it being called QoL?
---
Really not a big fan of T &amp; V :(
---
287m agi xp... lol
---
LMFAO
---
Man you're fuming arent you
---
IDE love instancing on my Ironman... even if it meant not being able to drop trade anything. Everyone and anyone can crash me with no recourse :( and they often do.
---
I use my own credit card, thank you very much 
---
I played in since a little after the start of osrs, and since 2005 until eoc in rs2. I quit back in August because no good pvp content/updates and pvp was/is pretty dead. But I liked this channel and it was the only way I really saw any osrs content anymore.
---
The dude seemed like he took time to compile the videos of popular shit from the day/week and that's useful to a LOT of people. Sure, it's on twitch, but I don't use twitch and I'd have never seen the content otherwise. I know I'm not alone in that.
---
So I don't think he was in the wrong, and the way YouTube is going downhill, there will be a mass exodus soon because of shit like this, and the censorship or demonitization. It's not a good thing for anyone that his channel has gotten demonitized. 
---
They be like “TBow’d 3rd Age god”
---
Agreed, therefore I don't want you voting.
---
See how that's not really a viable standard?
---
Technically yes, if you want 99 crafting to take 3+ years.
---
Most players agree that this is dumb though and not really feasible. (Maybe fine for 93-99, but forgoing Zenyte jewellery for years is stupid.)
---
Then why does it matter. 
---
Oh I thought I uploaded a screenshot, anyways the in-game name is KingOfCloves.
---
A few hours? You only use 1.2k karams a month?
---
&gt; You're just a shit person if that's how you find enjoyment .
---
Yet you write shit like this
---
&gt; You probably look like Asmongold ffs 
---
The double standard.
---
Ok cool thank's!
---
Based off your post chances are you were in a PvP world. 
---
That wasn't the only thing polled.
---
you could always chin, there's a chinning spot you can do without prayer.
---
Gotcha. Yea obsidian armor plus sword and berserker necklace is decent but idk how good it is outside of nmz
---
18 items isnt "taking up a large portion of peoples banks".
---
Alright, let's buff everything then and add double xp weekends.
---
Organized crime would be much faster if you find a good world order but it's going to be more preparation
---
I have no knowledge about those clients and I am kind of noob but are legit and not bannable and allowed by ToS?
---
Does anyone else see Gwen from Ben 10?!
---
Welcome to PvP worlds
---
Pretty much, that's why those BTW jokes, I mean, the idea of Iron man is nice, and I was honestly thinking of making one, but then again I realised I can play the game whatever style I want even on standard acc, I liked gathering my own resources for skills, but to the certain point. Same thing with the pvm drops, I liked getting those expensive weapons/armor to get myself as a drop, but when I got really tired of killing boss/monster I just bought it from GE. 
---
Must be nice having a pocket friend
---
Why is this sub so obsessed with trying to find casual ways to say the n word?
---
Aus words at 44's are usually packed in prime time tbh. I often play in aus time because of my work schedule and I often end up Pking on aus worlds. 
---
if only more people realized they can just drop items and keep the pet as the 3 kept items on death :(
---
To be fair if you mindlessly dumped enough hours into inferno you'd get it eventually.
---
Reported!
---
I played ironman for the pvm drops, not the mind numbing skilling.
---
I didn't know they had runescape in the 70s
---
oh wow you literally just started, sounds like fun
---
Your sense of elitism aside, just about every pker would rather fight another pker every time, but there simply isn’t that many around. So what happens is you’ve been hopping for 10 minutes and hit the hop cap so you’re just sitting there and decide to attack random people running by instead because anything is more entertaining than nothing. 
---
id rather not spend too much money thx though
---
Because the title of the poll is inconsequential. Vote on the issue, not the name of the poll.
---
Who cares what the poll is called? Frankly, they could just number them instead of titling them and solve the problem completely.
---
If you take issue with the question, that's fine. That's why you're allowed to vote no. But voting no because the title of the poll doesn't match the content of the question seems silly.
---
But that would... Be playing for fun? We can't have that /s
---
i wouldnt be able to do that for longer than 30 minutes i bet lol atleast you can chat with people in pc
---
Changing an iconic area for the worse, nearly removing it. It's not "taking care of the game" in this context; If this wasn't the intended context you said something even more controversial which would be you implying RS3 overall is better which you really shouldn't say in a community that intentionally abandoned RS3.
---
I do agree with a quest point change around the whole game.
---
I dropped outta college to focus on music (we actually got paid and played live gigs and shit) but that came back and bit me in the ass. Ofc he’s more successful at YT than we were in music lol. Considering YouTube pays less and OSRS has less outreach than a career making music, if I were him I’d get my degree ASAP so you have it in the bank *then* commit to a career in entertainment. 
---
Maybe it’s a tough situation where school doesn’t leave him with enough time to do YouTube, so he has to make a choice. I guess it’s unfair for us to judge
---
Alright fair I can see that 
---
Wtfs wrong with you
---
Hey man. Joining a PVM clan is the way to go tbh. I’ve been in a clan who does learner raids on a daily basis and one of our learners got an ancestral robe top yesterday on 2 KC! Feel free to join our cc at ‘empathy pve’
---
I swear this was implemented sometime back.. guess it wasn't. support
---
AGS so I can rush ppl and say ‘sit retard’ as they die until the police anti rush me
---
WoW is just as crammed as RS.
---
Dragon crossbow + dragon bolts would definitely help and aren't too expensive. Higher range level would definitely also help, that fight is pretty rough. Even 70 would be a pretty big improvement, just for the better armor.
---
As far as advice... Just practice and keep trying. Either you'll eventually get familiar enough with the fight that you take no un necessary damage, or you'll finally get a fight where all the RNG goes your way (Tons of bolt specs, low hits against you, etc.)
---
Jagex has said that 3rd party clients are allowed. It’s fine as long as you make sure to download the client from the clients real website, there are phishing websites around. Obviously they do say use them at your own risk.
---
Normal accounts have plenty of reasons to use superglass make. Its good magic and crafting xp and profitable.
---
Hahaha is funny when we pretend we no saying the n word but secretly 👀
---
Why is it blue?
---
You’re a god. Dragon Slayer 2 took me 20 attempts on the last boss, and 10m borrowed from a friend to buy the dragon crossbow 
---
Shit Bwangre that’s all you had to say 
---
This whole thing is aimed at promoting zeah to new players, even if it isn't exactly difficult to remember where he is it's a much better idea to have him out in the open in a place newbs go than tucked away in a corner of port sarim they're more unlikely to ever go to
---
1: make capital letters in password work. Password, pAssword, passWord is all the same in the login =&gt; password. So if someone think they're slick by putting password for website A Password, and RS paSsWord. it doesn't matter when Website A got a leak.   
---
2: Do what Steam do, set primary IP address. Any attempted login (site too, not just client) that not from your usual location would send an email to you asking for permission whether you got authenticator or not. Also warn you if the attempt login was with correct password, this should be your red flag to check your security. Steam save my ass with that one when the collection 1 leak.
---
Okay, so it's not QoL; it's a buff.
---
So what? Vote no if you don't like it.
---
Selling kills is not emblem farming. Having alts kill each other for free emblems is emblem farming.
---
The name of the poll isn't as big of an issue as the questions themselves, no doubt about that, but to lump something so meta-defining in with QoL is misleading and disingenuous.
---
I'd wager the average player has no idea how big of a buff the sandstone change will be. 
---
But they’re not even dry or cracked. 
---
I think the lighting just makes the textures stick out. 
---
I’m simply pointing out his hands look normal. 
---
So now you, calm yourself down, sir. 
---
 Nmz prod
---
It used to be cool but runelite has more features a konduit doesnt even work anymore because the devs abandoned it. You literally cant even look up someone on the hiscores with konduit anymore.
---
you probably think casual is playing like 4 hours a day
---
It’s not a career in YouTube unless he branches out from OSRS; it’s a career making OSRS vids which only lasts as long as the game does or until the novelty of his accounts wear off (which I doubt ever will, as long as OSRS stays around) 
---
M O D S
---
I’ve been using them for over 600kc at vorkrath. I sill make bank 
---
Don’t worry, begging at the GE makes 1.5m an hour 
---
People that want point and click skilling to be faster/more accessible are generally not the same people that want the most engaging combat. Runescape in general is more about fighting the interfaces and tick systems (in both games tbh) than completing the actual boss encounter.
---
Lmao, you don't just join a singles team bro. You gotta be active and the scene and know people. Chances are you're just going to get bs'd and dropped for your max set if you don't have solid refs in a team. 
---
No, you've got it all wrong.
---
The 2k/h is filling buckets at sand pits, no shops involved.
---
The 6k/h at 76 is high effort and does require camulet. But even without 3t you can get high rates, especially since you should include the fact that you're now getting lots of mining xp. I also think there should be a fast skilling method to get buckets of sand, but this is way way too fast. It increases crafting xp by crazy amounts!
---
Regarding the feedback: of course I voted no and gave feedback to Jagex too. But as long as nobody corrects people who are blatantly wrong about the impact of this change there will be lots of misinformation, hence my replies. Imo this change is going way too fast, from a suggestion on reddit earlier this week to a poll without discussion on the rates/balancing/impact first. I couldn't care less if it's labelled QOL or not, but more discussion on this idea was needed before it was polled to put in the game.
---
Nerd.
---
just hop dummie
---
7 curved bones. Unlucky bro. 
---
Mains are still better off using other crafting methods. For irons this isn't the case.
---
Every little bit adds up. The point is why isn't there a STASH unit for Falo's items just like there is for the rest of clue items?
---
The series wasn’t started until the blue cape. Change my mind. 
---
Valuable drop: 200 water runes
---
what is OSG?
---
Unfortunate. He could save others from the weird flex but couldn’t save himself
---
Ok you've peaked my interest... 3k? Whats the resolution and aspect ratio on that?
---
Watch someone make this into a new telegrab lure smh
---
Im an ironman.. lol
---
3000x2000, Microsoft and a few other companies have moved to that aspect ratio.
---
Well i guess still a secret since only 55k people can do it. 
---
As for raids its like clues its great money if you get a drop its meh otherwise.
---
Why can’t he see them typing? He said it was in an FC.
---
It's not just for exposure, it's for the consumers too. People that don't use reddit or twitch wouldn't have seen these otherwise, and it just makes it easier in general to watch all the good clips without needing to go through other platforms/channels to do so. And again, this isn't good for anyone, it only hurts us.
---
And to be honest, this dude probably didn't even start out to make money and likely did it for fun. Compilations are always nice to have, and i just watch the best ones, which happened to be his at the time. They could've been anyone's tbh. But they put time and effort into finding the clips, downloading them, compiling, then uploading them. We get to watch content we wouldn't otherwise see in an easily digestible way, streamers get exposure(doesn't matter if they big channels or not, exposure is exposure and anyone needs it), he gets views. 
---
He shouldn't be demonitized for it. YouTube is just shit. 
---
You can pay the farmer 200gp to comlpletely remove the tree after checking xp. Makes for MUCH faster farm runs.
---
Nice 
---
Got 3 in 36 kills when I first started DKs :D
---
&gt;I'd wager the average player has no idea how big of a buff the sandstone change will be.
---
I don't think that would change if the title wasn't "Quality of Life."
---
I'm sure most Ironmen would be happy to have another method, even if it wasn't that much faster.
---
RealScape is better than botscape.
---
Stomp stomp stomp
---
Woosh
---
No yellow text probably won't pass man /: 
---
I have same goal but with 1 prayer and and 50 attack.
---
Slayer is pain in ass.
---
I feel like at that point it comes down to compromising. Choosing to not spoil things for yourself by looking them up. And I meant asking for a riddle without having a clue for Falo, just to be able to fill up the STASH unit. Clues would still be random.
---
It was 100% from jagex. The password works for my acc settings but doesnt work to log in the gane
---
&gt;I'm sure most Ironmen would be happy to have another method, even if it wasn't that much faster.
---
I agree. I just don't think the new method should be 4-5x faster.
---
Augury is just as good as rigour when pking tbh. That accuracy is unreal. 
---
Tasakaal have [glowy eyes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten#/media/File:Konar_quo_Maten.png). I imagine that's hard to portray without just leaving them faded.
---
ur reading comprehension lol
---
how much did you lose
---
It’s the best. ;-) fyi, i did post a screenshot on Storgie’s twitter page... for those who really wanted it. (^_^) 
---
Sand collecting needed a buff desparately. Crafting was one of the slowest skills on ironmen. It’s a welcome change.
---
Well you thought correctly, that is pretty funny!
---
I skipped those questions because I'm not an ironman and I've never mined a single volcanic ash in my life
---
How long did it take you to get those pearls?
---
About $60M USD
---
To add to this, you could always just not participate in the double XP weekends if you don't want to, right??? 
---
Comment above yours is stupid and this is how the game is going to be ruined 
---
Some interesting stuff in here.
---
Thanks for explaining! 
---
Already a good amount of pvm in the relatively small wilderness zone, agression delay is dumb, people can already escape easily, antifreeze is dumb as it further discourages solo pk. Weight reducing is dumb already have stamina pots, clan tele is dumb it's already easy enough to get around the wildy dont need more ways for 50 people to appear out of nowhere. I kind of like the idea of poison teleblock but if your not bringing an antivenom out your chances of surviving are already way lower so kind of pointless.
---
I feel like taking away PvP could make this mode still really fun. Not as good as Ronan's version, but I think a lot of people would have fun
---
The best way without breaking your bank to get 99 crafting on a main still is molten glass. Source: already did it twice
---
Zet ff die instapost als reply dan. Ik wil wel zien waar ze dat zeiden.
---
Can I vote if I vote with the same mindset as you?
---
Easier = yes
---
harder = no
---
They're talking out their ass to feel better about themselves, the whole circle jerk idiots, imagine actually being empathetic and using your brain. But it's reddit. 
---
That shit takes time to make, and as I've said, it allows others to see content they wouldn't otherwise and sets bad precedents for YouTube. 
---
I checked, its legit. Maybe i should pm a jmod
---
Amulet of ghostspeak would be pretty cool to have
---
the point of the series is to make a gamemode with a runelite plugin so it wouldn't be pointless to further reflect his limitations with the plugin
---
He could get 54 to get his Total level to a nice 2110, or 59 to get to 2115. Those total levels would look nice.
---
log out for  couple days lol
---
Translation: can eat get 6x exp weekends for osrs pls
---
Take a break my doot
---
Or just use ShareX which clips a region and automatically uploads it to Imgur and copies the link for you.
---
I agree, if the math is correct. I just want a less cancerous method of obtaining Buckets of Sand, is all.
---
I think that's what most people who voted yes want. I don't think people necessarily want a faster method; just one that isn't awful.
---
Imagine having a Twitter for your RuneScape pvp account lol
---
Also, of those 18 a few you'd likely want in your bank because they are useful items outside of the clue. Some can even be stored elsewhere.
---
about 9m :( really not a ton but a good chunk of my bank 
---
As a new player I was sitting here thinking 
---
"Holy shit! that was like 3 million gold from high alchemy... what the hell item was that"
---
Then I had to go and look up twisted bow and was absolutely blown away by it's cost (Seriously, is it actually worth a billion gold? Does anyone actually have that much money or is effectively just "unsellable"?).
---
Then I came back to this thread to try and work out how anyone could possibly have ninety billion gold in items.
---
Then FINALLY I read the other comments and realised it was a joke.
---
SO!
---
With the benefit of all that;
---
Haha, +1 OP, I enjoyed this joke.... wait...
---
Why is using dragon darts in a blowpipe the same as turning a 1 billion gold item into 3 million?
---
&gt;resumes researching
---
Making a new account after grinding countless hours is not easy. No thanks.
---
Shilling runelite. Nice life.
---
I was wondering how many hydra you've killed after seeing your slayer and range xp 
---
Have you listened to him? He wants to pk and doesnt want to grind hours for supplies.
---
Dude why is your HP so low?
---
You deserve it for taking a picture of your monitor /s
---
Imagine willfully misinterpreting a situation in attempt to prove a point and accidentally doing the opposite 
---
That'd what jmods said about osrs mobile
---
I'd support a slight buff to filling buckets of sand if it gave decent xp in another skill.
---
IMO things like collecting sand from the sand pit or mining volcanic ash are grinds that ruin the fun of ironman mode. I'm not against grinds, I'm against bad grinds.
---
There's no panic worse than logging after a late night raid without claiming your stuff from private. Even with authenticator and bank pin it still scares me lol
---
Already powerful? Who honestly even uses it? 
---
Just get it done! It's a worth while excuse.
---
But no I don't think you can without.
---
No, mixed race. 
---
No, this isn’t a joke, this isn’t harmless. It’s deliberate marginalization under the guise of something harmless. The wide support for this shit on this post and the other creates a support system for pieces of shit like you. 
---
This post is trash, you’re trash, a significant portion of the r/2007scape community is fucking trash. 
---
Have you seen what happens to pvp suggestions in the polls? They get shit on by salty pvm'rs. If you think a pvp revamp to match any of your ideas would pass you're probably on meth
---
I actually started watching 25 buttholes with my girlfriend. She actually finds it funny despite not playing the game. those insults are top tier and even a normie can enjoy them. 
---
Devalues my mouse only ironman.
---
what freeze? all it is is a new form of ranging, there's no special effects
---
If any content creator did not want him uploading his clips then they have full power to prevent him. There's more benefits for content creators to be uploaded than not to be. I don't think any creators are angry at him for using their clips.
---
Suggestion: replace osrs by wow vanilla
---
It's also important to note that $3/1k views figure is entirely inaccurate.
---
You receive money based on the ad revenue, not views. You gain revenue for clicks in the ad(worth the most), and how long the videos are watched. Most people use ad blockers, and the rest usually skip as soon as they can. I can count on one hand how many times I've watch a video intentionally past the skip ad part on my phone before getting yt vanced.
---
This being an online game, where a lot of people play on their pc, most have ad blockers. So I highly doubt this guy is making even $2,000/mo, which isn't even as much as a full time job would make you. So he probably still just does this as well as working, which is a LOT of work to make as many videos as he does. 
---
eh :\\ i figured they wouldnt get me scrolls to get me where I cant go yet :P oh well... 
---
Lmao including shit runelite and konduit with the superior OSB. Retards play on those shit clients.
---
How do you know it was 100% from jagex?
---
are you sure it didn't just look like a runescape email, linked to to a page that looked like runescape and then you gave somebody your account?
---
Very possible they figured the community would handle the calculations for them. Crowd-sourcing is one of the fastest ways to solve a problem.
---
before ge there was no way to sell regular bones and they had no value lol
---
its more fun than not doing anything. most of the times ppl in wild dont find other pkers.
---
You know you think this a joke and "oooooh it's funny look at me violating someone's trust" but you probably gave this person trust issues for the rest of their life and that's really not cool dude. 
---
You can't just expose people like it's a Shane Dawson documentary like that
---
bwaner, you need a karambwan
---
Unlike you I think further than 1 month into the future, once everything is super easy to achieve what else is there to do?
---
u tried
---
I'd be all for that, in fact the extra effort from interacting with the game should translate to more sand per hour. Just not this much.
---
My mistake, I was thinking of bolas
---
That is true, and it does it make more click intensive without breaks I guess but I was demonstrating it is still very possible and pretty similar to doing it at lower levels - I just feel like a lot of people overstate the advantage of staying at 10hp and the like.
---
No, lol. That’s not what I meant.But ok... nevermind.
---
50k xp/hr is absolutely not worth the gp savings 
---
Try pking, try raids, pet hunting, set a goal of gp or killcount, do some relaxing slayer tasks while watching netflix, if you have never gotten the classic slayer drops such as whip dark bow etc. It can be fun trying to get them like the old days.
---
Do clan wars, explore those areas of the map you've always wanted too, hop around a pvp world in obscure areas you never know what you might find.
---
It’s not like slayer tasks. You can get clue scrolls you can’t currently complete
---
i just upvoted this from 2.9k to 3k, wow.
---
Ecstasy is against the ..........LAW!
---
Free membership with prime. If you make enough for a new bond great, if not don’t sweat it. Same deal if you buy a bond with gp. You don’t have to commit to anything, just give it a shot. If it works great, if not, continue as always. 
---
I agree, that's why I keep telling irons to use different crafting training methods :P
---
True. I’ve had close 
---
When people rave about how much money they make from slayer, what exactly are they doing? I pretty much cannon everything I can and it's rare that I break even except for some specific tasks. I do notice I'm making profit on tasks where I can't cannon like things in the Fremennik slayer cave. So are these people that are profiting just doing slow tasks and gaining shit slayer exp for the sake of profit? It seems hard to even break even while trying to slay at max efficiency.
---
Brainlet detected

Never intended? What makes you say that? UIM is ironman without a bank, and that's what it is now.
---
And it's Black history month to very topical.

Looks like that Dihn end well
---
isn't he the original area-locked guy? he's definitely up there with settled.
---
Is true, it's winter, the air is dry, I have severe eczema, and I'm often too distracted with things to put on lotion when I need to.
---
I always feel bad killing people risking items like that deep wild but I always think if they are dumb enough to risk their untradables what else could they be risking....
---
Are you an ironman who is using these ways of gathering? Or are you a main who is using the ge to buy the materials to level? Are you just against the bei g easier? Or why do you disagree with what i said? 
---
Naw mate it's just you.
---
Because if it waa a phishing acc i wouldnt be able to use the pass to login on the actual website... I didnt click any links
---
Why are you complaining about free membership? 
---
He’s salty because his Ironman series never took off.
---
Take a break, do diaries, do stuff you've never done before (I like doing obscure money makers personally even if they're somewhat shit), do clues if you enjoy them, grind out some of the collection log, learn a new minigame, learn PKing, join a clan. There's so many options but I feel like some people forget the game is for fun and you don't have to be progressing towards new goals all the time.
---
QoL can also be a buff, Jesus. This is typical “I had to do it so others should too” mentality. I’m always in the mind that doing pointless things like buying sand from a shop feels bad, having another way to do it would be good. Maybe the current implementation is too fast, but it needs to be clear that the idea is good and the rates are too fast.
---
Maybe full efficient 3 ticking should be 2k sand an hour to keep in line with buying from shops. This would mean casually doing it would be like 1.5kish so wouldn’t be as much but would also get the mining xp. It would still be a buff as you get the mining xp but honestly I think that would be 100x better than walking between shops for 40 hours or whatever it is. 
---
Pretty sure that’s widely known so you’d be able to look it up, Matthew was known as ghost and hacked a lot of powerbot users before joining RSBuddy iirc
---
Good shit fam
---
Was thinking the same thing
---
Then stop participating in it :)
---
&gt; It's literally designed for people who want to skip the skilling grinds and get straight into PvM.
---
welcome to osrs
---
Selling 100% genuine b word passes, 500k each. Hmu.
---
Not having to walk between a shop for 30 hours seems like a QoL update to me.
---
Nah, it gets me pumped to drop idiots. I think I would get a raging hardon if I ever dropped a HCIM doing imbued capes.
---
Half of those questions aren't QoL
---
Just like scythe and t now are required for raids now right? Gotta spend 2 bil to get that sweet 50k pure pk loot.
---
They shouldn't have adjusted a single thing anywhere in the game for Ironman. Any balance for an Ironman at all is wrong and useless
---
That is not fake news, RSbuddy was the name of the bot
---
Crafting has been almost 100k/hr on ironman for years, I don't see how it "needs" to be made faster.
---
Or maybe it could not be trash?
---
I’m sorry, I might’ve worded it a little odd. You’re totally right!
---
I just think that an UIM was intended to be played with an inventory alone - not with the whole Zulrah death chest and what have you.
---
I could be wrong though, as I might be biased and say that all those storage should be eliminated. 
---
How do you feel about the storage mechanics? Excluding the clue boxes etc of course
---
I've been using Excel spreadsheets for work and college for 8 years now and I don't know how to use "basic" formulas other than SUM.  Maybe the guy knows how to take a screenshot and just didn't want to.  Why do people need the need to get so pissy about it? You can clearly see the image in this case regardless.
---
He's been playing for longer than 3mo I think
---
I am 8k dry of the pet
---
I'd rather them not lure skillers and pvmers into the wilderness. Maybe add things that give pkers a reason to go there.
---
The wilderness is not specifically FOR pking. It’s FOR loads of other things, like training skills (prayer, fishing, woodcutting) with added perks in exchange for some risk. And I understand the idea of pking people killing ents or training prayer at the chaos altar for profit. But I was doing a Slayer task at ice giants, who have no good drops. I clearly had only three items on me and I still got Pk’d three separate times.
---
Maybe you should try and educate people on why you think what they're doing is wrong instead of calling people trash. Seems like a pretty trash thing to do.
---

He's not racist, he unlocked the pass.
---

---
What are you asking? Incoherent yada yada. 
---
All rune items are ~200GP profit per alch, but low buy limits stop it being viable for long term training. Dragon legs/skirts make close to 800gp per alch but again low buy limits
---
you lucky bastard gz lol
---
Anti venom to Sherlock?
---
Some people have more time than money, some have more money than time. 
---
yeh. 70 hours  = 200m+ with a decent money maker. 50m+ if you dogshit.

Definitely could, but a lot of the fun in this for me is doing random shit to accomplish my goals!

Agreed they should just take 1500total idiot suggestions.

Ur asbergers syndrome is too severe to notice the irony.

Thanks man!  
---
Crazy thing is; I got it on my phone, while at a convention with my GF- only realized it when I got home and it was in my inventory, really stoked!  
---
Love to feel the nostalgic rush of this game, that I used to grind as a teenager :)
---
how do i block this user?
---
My point is that you could do any number of money making methods to pay for a faster crafting method and save more time overall. 
---
Lucky drops! I got 2 magic fangs withing 45 kills but now I'm at 160 and haven't gotten a uniques since. But I guess im still over the drop rate so I can't complain too much.
---
What a freaking bwaner..
---
Yeh. Runelite trumps all. 
---
I didnt knew that entry swapping has been in the game so long, but the point is jagex knows about it and hasnt banned it.
---
But I dont really see how your comment makes sense? Entry swapping is literally a more convenient 1:3 AHK script. Allow one and you allow the other aswell.
---
ur a bwaner lol??

---
&gt;Allow one and you allow the other aswell.
---
they've explicitly said that specific menu entry swapper is okay. theyve also explicitly said ahk usage is not
---
God Wars Dungeon, Dagannoth Kings, Chambers of Xeric (Raids 1), Theatre of Blood (Raids 2) are the main ones I can think of. You could also do the Wildy Bosses (Callisto, Venenatis, Vet'ion, Scorpia), King Black Dragon and the Kalphite Queen in groups.
---
That's not a slippery slope, its a fact. Hey siri, define Fact!
---
you are retarded
---
Shut up mole
---
Is white the base set?
---
But hang on, we have zero evidence that OPs posting was racially motivated, do you not think its odd that you immediately assumed he was a racist? Doesn't that mean that anyone that isn't white can never be criticised because its racist?
---
I'm sorry, but if you immediately assume any interaction towards BME groups that isn't explicitly positive is racially motivated, you're in for a rough ride.
---
If you'd want to play that way then might as well play the ironman then right? 
---
It's definitely all relative to combat level. When you see someone at like 90ish combat in full Bandos, you know they're unlikely to have got it legitimately. Whether someone has a fc or not is a good reference too.

I personally couldn't care less for crafting. I enjoy like 90% of IM but crafting is such a huge roadblock im glad of anything that makes it faster.
---
Granted, I will not be playing until it is possible to AFK gathering crafting mats, but it is a step in the right direction regardless.
---
Why do you only have water air and fire runes in rune pouch and no secondary runes with house tabs. I'm legit confused lol.

Not even talking about laws, just in general

I don't know why people complain about Runecrafting's XP rates [tbh](https://i.imgur.com/Is7hHXn.png)

---
Considering the polled buff would shave off 40 hours I think the hyperbole is warranted.
---
Where do you draw the line with xp buffs? Should we be buffing other skills too? Why just crafting?
---
I’m a white gamer. That doesn’t mean racism isn’t a thing. Also my post was a joke. Stop being “so sensitive”. You all got quite defensive like you’re trying to over compensate for something. Maybe racism?
---
Surprise twist - you're ironman so you still got a long way to go.

Thank you for the well thought out response. You bring up great points. I think the quick noting stuff you brought up could be cool. 
---
A lot of people get upset about jagex "forcing" people into the wild with rewarding content but i honestly think most of the wildy rejuvination updates have been pretty good. The bosses are very fun content imo, the risk of someone lurking out there just increases the intensity (even though they are easy bosses) to a level not had in regular bossing. 
---
You don't *need* 99 crafting as an ironman, though. The highest crafting lvl you "need" to craft everything is 93 for the amulet of torture, which you don't actually *need* until you start doing serious high lvl content. 
---
Many ironmen also seem to forget that you'll be getting an assload of crafting resources from PvM. You don't need to do glassblowing until 99 crafting *at all*. The highest you'd "need" to is arguably 90 for the tormented bracelet, or 93 for the torture (which isn't that big of an upgrade anyways). After those levels you should honestly just be relying on resource drops from pvm.
---
I'm already on it
---
I'd imagine many just don't realize it. I've played this game a long time (both osrs and before osrs) and I did not realize it till a couple years ago.

ive never seen this many replies to one comment

That calculator is dogshit.

Lance +20% accuracy and damage or something I think
---
It’s that player mod invitation, I just know it this time!
---
Not at my computer so I can't use the spreadsheet, but it looks like the Lance will be slightly less accurate but have a slightly better max hit depending on gear than a normal whip. Tent seems to have better str bonus than Lance though
---
after i have the chance to get the imbued heart from each how would i put that into an equation to figure out the chance of getting 2 in 30 when the drop rate is higher? if you happen to know. please and thank you

how so? its not BIS for any GWD boss, not Bis for verzik, not Bis for raids? its BIS for slayer and a handful of midtier bosses. Dragon stick poker replaced its main moneymaking uses

It's 100% a phishing email jagex won't send you a temporary password. What they do is make another account and get you to send in a ticket, then they read that ticket and use that info to recover your account. What kind of info did you send jagex? Did they ask for your bank pin? 
---
Does my myths cape mean I'm moderate not bad at least?
---
Because in Bounty Hunter, you have mysterious emblems that you need to upgrade by killing your target while you have your emblem in your inventory. So for the guy that did the killing, he got his emblem upgraded (which results in more money for him) risk free, since you are letting him kill you without fighting back.  
---
Probably like 1/2 people that say they're going to pay you, don't. So the 1m per hour is not easily obtained unless you just get lucky with targets. However, I would say even if you don't get lucky, you can still make upwards up 400-600k an hour doing this, and it requires nothing basically.

Yeah, but 20% extra would still only be +78 slash and +84 str, vs the whip's 82 in both, which seems about the same

Reminder that this is the nigga that trash talked you on wildy...

Yeah you'll have your 43 prayer in no time

Ironman is not harder than a normal account. The only difference is you have to collect resources yourself.

a couple things.

first - you're too slow, you need to be pickpocketing the guy 2x when you successfully knock him out, so you need to start the first pickpocket sooner and the second one when the first animation is happening.
---
second - when you fail to knock out you should immediately pickpocket, not use the later
---
Tru
---
Yea and throwing away a $20 bill every time you get your paycheck is also profitable, doesn't mean it's as profitable as it could be.
---
I don't see why not.

Certain areas of the game are just way laggy. What ive done is decrease the render distance and/or turn on low detail. Works for me

Max autism levels! Kidding but gratz, that's pretty nice.

think its ok? Why wouldnt it be ok? If you dont want to be collecting sand for 40 hours then you know what? Dont collect sand for 40 hours because you dont think the input matches the output. A very simple and sensible system. If this very simple solution doesnt appeal to you let me suggest that you dont play ironman mode at all, its not for everyone, and I can already tell its not for a reddit baby like you.

Like others have said, the first thing to try is taking a break. Otherwise...If you haven't already, try doing all of the hard diaries, and maybe some of the elites as well. Likewise, if you haven't already, try completing the Quest Cape. Doing some clue scrolls for a while could also be fun.
---
You're so close to 2000 total level that it would be a good goal to work towards. Could maybe aim for base 80s since you're so close to it, or maybe go for like 99 slayer.
---
Alternatively, you can try starting an ironman account. Maybe even area locked. Speaking of, you may be inspired to continue playing or something by watching OSRS videos, i.e. Swampletics.

Because it's really the only formula I need, and I can Google the rest.

My college roommate inherited his grandmother's home in her Will shortly before graduating. In an area of Wisconsin where your choices are either $120 for super spotty 10d/1u from at&amp;t or dial up.
---
I can understand someone with that viewpoint, it has probably made the game type more accessible now. I personally enjoyed the start for the fact there was no real guide. It was a good test of your runescape knowledge and a new high score to race.
---
So you basically want an ironman with perks of a main so you can still flaunt off the fact youre an ironman, gotcha

I always wondered how they implement the prayer lore into this.

Like when youp see Jad stomp on the ground and turn on protect from range. In that split second is your character pressing his/her palms together saying "oh saradomin for all things good and holy please dont let this big red boi hit and 84 on me thanks k bye"

This is what i was thinking but why not make it so you just have to do x number of quests regardless of points

Because scripts literally teleport your mouse.

Grab a glory, magic short bow and 50 rune or amethist arrows and a burning amulet. Tele to lava maze and run to rev caves and fight goblin, imp and pyrefiend in NW corner of rev caves. Use glory to tele out south of level 30 in caves. Good luck! Should manage to get 100k plus per 20 min trip without risking much. You may die a lot but it's worth it.

Materials are fairly cheap, maybe a dollar or less for each. I'm not a professional at 3D printing, so setup can take up to an hour of labor and some labor to clean up at the end. I don't like the way the colors look, I used a fine point blue pen and I don't have any other way to color them at the moment, so I'll sell them without color and you can color them yourself.
---
If you really REALLY want them, I'll charge $4 per rune (UNCOLORED) with a $7 shipping fee.
---
I know it's not cheap, but if I'm being honest I'm a lazy guy and I don't really want to go through the effort of making these and shipping them out. I'll only do it if the price is high enough.

While that is good it hasn’t been updated in almost 4 months (though it does have some of the kebos items as how they were from the poll blog)

i dont really think time play should be one of those, as that could easily be raised without actually playing the game.

People that fall for stuff like this deserve it.

I tried to keep my pants off too lol

So you were talking out of your ass and there is not a single way extra quest points can be a negative thing.

The fuck are you talking about “wOkE” for. This isn’t progressive thinking here, racist fucks like you are just backward hillbillies who got inbred a few too many times to evolve socially and develop some empathy. Go fuck your mom again you piece of shit.

well yeah of course, unless you know what you're doing and have the resources then it's gonna take even longer, thats my point, even if you prioritize it still takes ages to get anywhere in this game

Yes. And even if you couldn't, you can just revert it to a normal cat by giving it milk.

RIP 10 hours

I maxed out my combat stats pre-eoc and never got the fire cape either. Just play the game how you want, there's plenty of high level players who can't or never bothered trying to get the fire cape. I'm currently 103 and I don't have it either, just don't try to let it drag you down.
---
Ty for proving a point, bwaner

Well, it is currently a requirement. Also like the OP said, "People that spend a lot of time on the game end up learning a lot about aspects of the game they've never touched". So you could get it up by just AFKing, but if you set it to a high amount like 100 hours, chances are most players wouldn't just AFK the whole thing. Even if they aren't spending the whole time playing, if they are looking stuff up or such while logged in that can still be helping them to learn more about the game.
---
Also, if you didn't include a fourth like Game Time, it could cause some problems for certain accounts. like if the Total Level is hard for your account type and you can't get the QP req, it puts us right back in the same issue. So I'd say just make the Time Played and Total Exp a higher req than the others so you're more likely to hit the others first, but they'd still be options for accounts that have a hard time with the other reqs.

When i saw the obsidian armour in the "get a torso" section i knew that OP was a f2p noob and knows nothing about the game

Last week I had to get an infernal axe. So not only did I need to get 85 fm from 65, but I had to spend 2 mil on a smouldering stone... the reward? 210k.

The number will always get higher because.... It cant get lower. (Unless people get banned, lol).

But thats not the issue. The issue is the rate at which people max. Its absolutely ridiculous, so many maxers daily. If we had 2013 rates we would have under 10% of the maxers we do now. And 2013 rates werent even bad imo.

Yep, you're an ironman alright.

Tbh I don't think everyone is saying they want a 2x-3x buff, but it's just that that's what Jagex is going to give us when we ask for a better, Skilling related method to gathering sand. I don't remember (and can't be bothered to find out) if it was suggested by Jagex or another user but I saw an idea of smashing sandstone with a hammer to fill empty buckets, and thought that would be a good middle ground. Very click intensive, and there's thought to it by getting the right sandstone to bucket ratio, and similar rate as grinding materials with pestle and mortar. Slow if afk but faster if clicking. 
---
Too bad Jagex hardly does polls anymore that are "Do we want 'x' added into the game?"
---
And then a separate majority poll of "How should we add 'x' to the game?" And offer different ideas to vote on, I think that would work well, especially for an issue like buckets of sand which have had many viable solutions proposed 
---
Quality.

Theres always the potential for one of them to think about it and realize that what I said is true. But you're right, most will probably just use it more. That's why it's such a big problem in the first place, it gets ingrained through generations of family and it takes someone to think critically and break the habit as opposed to just continuing the cycle. 
---
That's what I was thinking tbh

Til the word “players” doesn’t exist

ah. You'll be hitting the money levels sooner than later. You're at dust devils and those are decent. Kurasks at 70, skeletal wyverns at 72, gargoyals at 75, and nechs at 80. These are all fantastic money and as you level and get those tasks more often and kill them faster it will only improve.

I think more of its they're enjoying the content they're allowed to enjoy in a way that they want to, which partially means getting to screw over unprepared players. wildy has always been that way, it's a pretty unique concept for gaming honestly considering how old the wildy is

u/DovahDoRoh Would starting Taste of Hope and stopping after getting the pestle and mortar not be better than grinding it out in Tarn's Lair?

So why do you even bother arguing against it? If &gt;80% of people feel this is something that will increase the amount of enjoyment they get playing the game, why be selfish and argue for them to not get it? I seriously don't understand the logic.

Really cool idea, actually, especially if it upgraded the stats to match the tier of armor. Ironman armor looks neat and it would be nice to see it get more use outside of the first twenty minutes of play
---
Is rest those music players at capital cities that recharge stamina?

I'm totally in favour of bringing them back, and the visible veins in ore nodes too.

I got all of my sand passively from bert. That means I didnt go out of my way for 99 crafting, its coming naturally. I agree that going out of your way to obtain sand is abysmal, but its not the only way to train crafting and people act like it is. Sandstorm never had any support from me. Sandstone is better, but i still don’t support it.
---
 Crafting is in a fine place. Either actively train it gathering sand or whatever method you choose to do, or passively from bert and pvm drops. We already get more seaweed than we can use if we’re keeping up with our seaweed runs so why make that even easier?
---
2 minutes
---
Why did ya?
---
&gt;people being higher level doesn't mean they're informed
---
Why is everyone obsessed with something being 100% effective. Sure, there could be the occasional absolute brainlet with 1250 total, but it's incredibly likely that they know enough about the game to make not terrible decisions.
---
So you’re idea; going from over 12 years of a consistent, monthly payment based revenue module, to giving everyone unlimited members for the price of what used to be only 24 months.
---
How is that a win at all for a business?
---
$120 for a lifetime?? Are you trolling? Not to be rude or anything.. I understand your concept and how often you play but you should realize a lot of people have been playing for years and to offer a lifetime membership for $120 would be a slap in the face to a lot of players. Not to mention membership is already $6-11 a month based off when it was purchased

You can also argue from the other end and say they need to add more high end content because once you get there there’s nothing to do. It may not feel like it now but the majority or the game is late game and it doesn’t take too long to get to where you can do that content. Just saying that without adding more late game content the game would have died a long time ago

&gt; enjoying the fact that this was a finite game
---
Never felt that way and been playing since RSC... In RSC, xp rates were so slow that maxing was something I never even dreamed of. Hell, that was even back when the developer didn't think anybody would ever max. RS2 changed things a little and 99's became much more common with skilling menu changes (God, remember having to click 10 times to smith a single item?) and overall xp rate buffs, but there was still a ton of stuff to do that fully completing everything never felt like it would be achievable.
---
&gt; new high end content every month 
---
Not really sure where this is coming from... Most end game updates are few and far between, the vast majority of the updates are catered to the mid level bracket. End game content updates are things like Inferno and ToB... Pretty much everything else you can get access to with base 70 stats. In all honesty I wish there were more updates for end game players.
---
&gt; never be able to reach? 
---
Again, no... Considering how long OSRS has been out even the most casual players are starting to hit max combat and decent skill totals, giving them access to pretty much everything in the game (assuming they played smart and didn't bank stand for 80% of their playtime or take every valuable drop straight to the duel arena)
---
&gt; I feel this is slowly turning into RS3. 
---
Uhh... What? RS3 is meme-able because of how EoC was upon release (and first impressions are everything) as well as the heavy presence of microtransactions. I don't think what you're describing (there being too much content that's way too hard to get to) is something that's ever really been said about RS3.
---
As for the rest... Games have to evolve. If they didn't, then OSRS would just be like RSC when RS2 was released. Popular for a little while, then slowly fading away into oblivion until eventually the lack of interest and maintenance caused Jagex to have to shut the servers down. There's still plenty of nostalgia to be had for an OG player returning to OSRS, and the new influx of mobile players really has nothing to do with OSRS being updated rather than just frozen from the 2007 version it was originally deviated from.

i mean he did kill hitler so he couldn’t have been that bad

Whats the item in the bottom right  called?
---
leave and re~enter after showing each defender to the lady. after rune, the dragon defender is in the basement which is found outside the cooks room. you could spend anywhere from a few kills to a few hours getting it. personally got it just under 5k tokens down there alone.

Well played

Hell yeah brother, wish I could get 2 elites in 42 kills.

Man. The music cape is CLOUT.

I agree. Warding should not be added and instead they should expand runecraft/crafting and perhaps create a bridge between those two skills.

Stop giving your brainless opinions.

tbh I felt it was actually pretty fun. Took me a solid 4 hours to do on my main (wanted to pvp with it) but fuck that defender class that makes you trap those things. I've been called a lot of shit from pking but nothing was as bad as playing defender. collector, healer, and attacker were actually all pretty enjoyable
---
I didn't even do it so you're just blindly lashing out at this point.
---
How dumb it actually is that it supports keyboard but no mouse.. like... I wanna do some afk skills which I only need to click once in a while and can't but no problem guys, I can write faster because I can use the keyboard... *Facepalm*

Normally they'll pull out a tier 8 / 9, so I can only assume most of the kills up to a tier 8 is legit, the final 2 they pay for

That’s the task only spot, if konar said kalphite lair then it’s the other spot, where KQ is

So I'm considering doing fishing super AFK.  Right now I'm planning on Monkfish from 70-82 and then Anglers from 82-99.  Are sacred eels or infernal eels a better way to go at 87 if I'm looking for best profit?

it doesn't have to be like that but that's what jagex are offering so the majority are gonna vote yes, if they offered a buff that made it 2x as fast it would pass just as fast.

 To me, they are 2 faces of PvM content. Jad is purely prayer-based, using extremely powerful attacks that can 1shot the player with no chance of dodging. Galvek is almost purely movement-based, as all his 1hit attacks are dodgeable, but still checks stats like defense and ranged level. You can kill him if you dodge long enough, but you might run out of supplies if you mess up. The fight cave portion, while much longer than Galvelks instance, performs the movement-based (safespoting, focus priority) and defense level checks. Bosses like Zulrah and Vorkath often combine these two aspects (prayers, movement), along with ability rotations, (which is why they are generally seen as "harder"). 
---
Tldr: Jad is for prayers, Galvek movement. I suck at prayer flicks but am better at movement, which is why I have a mythic cape instead of a Fc.

Ironman here (btw). I play ironman not necessarily because it is harder, because it really isn't, but rather because there is a certain sense of accomplishment to grinding x in order to grind y, rather than spending money to grind y.
---
It's the difference between grinding money to buy molten glass, and grinding astral runes with rc to superglass make the sand and seaweed you got yourself to blow that glass, to get crafting levels.
---
The sand grind being painful isn't why I like ironman. It's having done it myself, whether that's 50 hours of sand or 12 hours of sandstone.
---
Is this too strong? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not at the point of the crafting grind quite yet on my ironman. But as a concept, something being unfun is not why I play ironman. If it's unfun, I just won't do it.

That would be... something. But I don't think the Music Cape part is too big of a deal. Also, given how you lose that whenever new music is added, it could make the storage a bit annoying. I'd expect it would still let you take items out if you didn't have the cape at the moment, but then you wouldn't be able to put them back in.

that sounds pretty similar to my experience, but i use void instead of dhide. since i mage everything except ahrim and tunnels, void is faster dps for both range and mage.  The extra mage bonus is definitely noticeable when you're maging karil for void vs dhide
