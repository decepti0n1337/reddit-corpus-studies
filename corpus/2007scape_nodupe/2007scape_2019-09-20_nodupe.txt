You should be using a normal anti-fire shield. It allows you to use protect from range, which is better than protect from mage, as the range attacks occur more often, and hit harder.

---
I too need this answer because I had the same question and never got a solid answer.
---
Arma is definitely better but you’ll still need Sara and zammy items, god dhide works good enough though
---
And only one sleeve at that!
---
0.005 or 0.5% then, 1/200 is more impressive.
---
BTW
---
"rc bad, rc slow" has gotten really tiring. Honestly, I'm waiting on more quests with actually decent level requirements. It's nice to see people actually have reason to train skills they might not have otherwise.
---
The gnomes captured a soldier at Port Khazard, using nearby rope to bind him. They brought him back to the village.
---
Ah gotcha. Yeah I'm using dhcb now so maybe I'll stick to range and get the blue dragon kills through there. Sucks that the slayer helm isn't able to be better utilized here at vork.
---
This is the main thing holding me back from doing this quest.
---
Does anyone know who it was that spent that $62k? For all we know it could've been some rich dude from Dubai who has "fuck you" money. I've seen a couple of news articles concentrating on that 1 dude who spent a lot of money, but I don't think that really  gives a lot of perspective on the problem.
---
He kills all the brothers and opens the chest.

Memorizing the last two zulrah rotations so I can stop teleporting out. I’m way late to the game getting a blowpipe..

I’m trying to get 99 herb and I’m 82 atm and I keep seeing people say at 84 do recovery specials but what are they I can’t find any info on them, sorry for being a noob
---
It's a cool idea, but in practice it would be a very abusable item, and make the economy worse off while also not really uniting pkers/pvmers.
---
Honestly it is, but the fact that he's being such a baby about getting it wrong is highly amusing
---
Your "logic" is garbage. If the seed is "too expensive" to afford it right now, go grind the boss until you can pay one.
---
if i have an ecu key i have to waste a restore dose, yes, but ill also brew up before i get to the boss room anyway, so ill need to do that anyway. if i dont and im getting killcount, then i put on rapid restore prayer and then pot up once my stats have gone back to normal, which happens within like 2 mins. otherwise, you could just begin getting killcount and use prayer, and once you need to restore your prayer back to full, drink the restore and then pot up. dont pot up before youve fully restored stats, its almost a waste of a pot dose.
---
That's an RS3 thing
---
if you want to save money and don't mind it being more tedious, you can boost with a botanical pie at 86 up to 90, and make supercombat potions. The preserve prayer will make this a bit easier.
---
atleast 67 of them had over 25m xp cause thats how many ranks i gained
---
Yep definitely packet loss i just tried this a no. of times, experienced a similar thing between 20-30MS now, 3/10 ping tests timing out w/packet loss I am sure this is a server issue I guess we're going to have to wait it out.
---
Great work on your first day! Glad to see you’re getting into the spirit of things! You should try to do some quests in the upcoming days. I recommend talking to the priest in the Lumbridge church. I hear he’s having a problem with a ghost.
---
&gt;As much as the YouTube videos tell you that you get 70k xp h you don't.
---
Yeah, not if you're bad.
---
Cool scouting bot
---
Sorry I should have made my comment more clear. You use two accounts, one which has not finished the quest, one that has finished either regicide of mep2.
---
Without using two accounts like this I believe it will not work.
---
Tears of guthix helps a lot. If you’ve been collecting Runecrafting XP for a year and started at level 60 (from quests and achievement diary lamps) it would bring you up to 71.
---
because the recording software doesn't register the mouse above non active windows, and the window is only active after the click
---
Just stop EoC, tell them to rebalance dungeoneering before releasing it, Free trade ban couldn’t be fixed.
---
I got a 0:54 pb the other day without wooxwalking using dhcb, probably could have been a few seconds faster if I did
---
Underrated comment!
---
I have level 61 Tears of Guthix

Wasn't Maz the dev on that? And she left?

Don't forget to click the link in the description for 2x xp!!!! 111

So is this why real issue are not being addressed because dev's are being forced to push out new shiny stuff instead of polishing up old content and making it shine?
---
It's for the oldschool feel
---
no
---
In 48 hours you could definitely:
---
Get 70 range, black D hide, MSB(i) or Karil’s crossbow (heavily RNG dependent), get 40 def or whatever D hides require.
---
The hard part would be getting enough brews and super restores to do it, but it’s certainly not impossible especially if you can trade or if you have another account training herblore.
---
You’d almost certainly have to use most if not all the time to do it though.
---
I once spent twenty minutes runecrafting
---
When you get to extreme/competition levels of low body fat percentage, they actually dehydrate themselves to get more definition.
---
Idk always gave me a good laugh much like Reddit does on a regular.
---
I highly doubt it. BIS gear was way worse (-22 str from what I can find?) and Slayer as a whole wasn't nearly as optimized. You can get 30k/hr with what you described, but that's because there are better xp monsters, more places to cannon, and better gear.
---
Nope I had a friend ask me about Stam pot sink bridge once
---
DUDE IM AT 52
---
wtf
---
brooooo
---
Just unlucky bro. People have gone way drier for more common items.
---
Didnt think about the price yikes! Resource area it is then lol anglers are the best thing i can fish atm aside from dark crabs (almost 86!) Afkish is a bonus though cause im catching about 200 through out my shift at work :)
---
FUCK YOU I'M GONNA BE FIRST

It's clearly not set in stone. $11 says it gets cancelled or just fucks up like Deadman tourneys

Lol get rekt

That's the way I see it

Calm your tits, fucko.

What about those of us that used a guide on release day 😎

If Jagex wanted to make it so their actual big-spenders had the opportunity to buy big lots of bonds, they could do what CCP does with Eve Online. They offer smaller plex packages, but they also say if you want to purchase more than a certain amount, to email their billing team directly to arrange a special deal. No reason why something similar couldn't be done here.
---
Wow, this is some interesting information about POH. Thanks.
---
They talk about them quite often on the Q&amp;As and it's pretty wholesome. They love the game so much some of the best stuff in the game was stuff they weren't even paid to make.
---
&gt;lol do you honestly believe Jagex would value bots bought bonds more than the quality of game and consequentially growth of legit and longterm playerbase?
---
yes
---
&gt;Don't you see people getting pissed with bots and leaving at lower levels or in f2p?
---
People get mad over literally everything, it'll only change when it starts to adversely affect Jagex's profits. And Jagex does not give a single shit about f2p players until they feed into their bottom line.
---
&gt;Not to mention while botting creates demand for bonds, it also creates supply for black market gp = cheaper rates = more incentive for people to buy through rwt.
---
Through bonds, Jagex has a semi-symbiotic relationship with rwting and bot farms as a whole. If someone spends roughly $2-2.50 on rwt'd gold and then buys a bond with it - Jagex still profits from that interaction. If all RWT ended tomorrow, Jagex would undoubtedly lose money.

They sure didn't add a system that allows them to profit from off-site rwting and bot farms either haha

or drive a whole iteration of the game into the ground for some quick bucks

Crazy account, I’m really impressed with the amount of work you put in. Champions cape is always the coolest to see.

What's the meta barrows gear and inventory setup nowadays? I know there are better money makers but my slayer is low and I don't quite have the range levels to do Zulrah with enough DPS yet. I need cash to level up more and barrows seems like a good intermediate moneymaker. 83 Magic, 75 range, and base 70 melee/prayer.
---
I've been thinking about blessed d'hide w/ a neitiznot helm, furry, and blowpipe and an accumulator. 
---
For magic I was thinking I'd use a trident of the swamp, occult necklace, and I'm not sure what else because I only have about 7mil to spend and most of that is going towards the blowpipe and trident.
---
For inventory just prayer pots, maybe a few sharks just incase, and barrows teleport tabs + a duel ring?
---
Nice
---
cannot unsee
---
You’re fired
---
how are you getting 20+? i can get 7 MAX i use full arma+tbow+pegs+anguish. I also pot up. blue phase zulrah hits me for constant 20s and 30s how do you not run out of food? unless you mean your house teleing after every kill because if you count that i can indefinitely stay.
---
haha!
---
i did that with slayer lmao i got 69 for mm2 or ds2 i think and i just never did it again
---
I believe it changes based on the knife type no? I thought you throw it from the heaviest end, which varies greatly.
---
Can jagex ban this bot?
---
Is it distance? I thought it was determined by the heavier side.
---
(Coughs in prayer and Herblore)
---
1:16, dhcb, elite void, 94 range, rigour, no woox walk
---
I mean shit if you turn it upside down that says 99 runecrafting. Don’t worry about it.
---
That is a good idea, fk I haven't  played eve for a while but I might just fire t back up, the depth of that game is crazy
---
god damn it.

Stop and just fix/improve the game we like from 2007.

One of the easiest things I'll ever due in life is not spend $62,000 on a videogame.  
---
You should try also not spending $62,000 on a videogame, it's pretty neat!
---
negative. In order for that to work efficiently it would have to be the pool beside the jewelry box. however since those teleports bunched around it is 90% of the uses of the house, youd have to go to the further pool every time you weren't using dh.
---
Also with how fast locator orb hits, and the fact it hits for 10dmg, youd be 1hp way before you got back to the mole. I could damage like 600hp in the time i got to mole.
---
no reason besides im poor. my whole bank is only 1b. I had 99 craft, con, fletch, cooking, and most of herblore banked and yeah i just can't afford it. If i could, i def would use tbow but i have no issue with acb.
---
Yes do exactly that and never login with that gmail on your pc or anyone elses. keep it on your mobile.
---
I set my esc and f1 to go between my invy and magic book at zmi. After while it came muscle memory and I could just watch Netflix without staring at the screen

move house portal outside of your 3x3 layout, then back to center. might have to do it a few times.
---
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally
---
I dont believe so but shouldnt matter for your auth.
---
the only place its actually useful (for the cost) is TOB and TOB is hard to do so not a huge demand now that most of the people who do it a lot have the scythe 
---
it will probably settle around 600-700m cause that's a lot more affordable for people to start learning TOB after being burned from CoX
---
&gt;So confused sorry this is new to me? Don’t log in with the new google email?
---
Create a NEW gmail account on MOBILE and NEVER use that gmail on your PC ever. Like I made a gmail strictly for my google auths and I haven't logged into it on my PC ever.
---
once you have a 3x3 or 4x4 house, just use the building viewer to move your portal outside of your 3x3/4x4 structure, accept it, then move it back. might have to do it a couple times or try moving it to different tiles. Just always keep it touching your house.
---

Here is a little img i threw together for someone else.

Alright check out this image.  [https://imgur.com/mYTDfWT](https://imgur.com/mYTDfWT)
---
Green = grass border
---
Brown/burgundy color = house
---
purple = exit portal.
---
Move the portal to the yellow tile in the grass, outside of your actual PoH layout. Then move it back.
---
He's not correct though. The rs3 theme is basically fossil island ported to their game but not the osrs theme.
---
For a host house to be efficient it requires all fastest teleports and other stuff like chapel, study room, workshop and combat room for all the players necessities, so thats at least 7 rooms. It is not a max efficiency house for a solo player, even tho the difference between 3x3 and 4x4 is 1 tick at max. It seems tho you didn't even check the load time in the video. Also take in consideration I had 150 ping in the video, which is the best I can get.
---
Sir Tayne, always sure of himself but ends up being wrong and fucking up the plan every time.
---
Even if something doesn't give a "max hit" it still increases dps.
---
If you virtual max hit would be 1.9 instead of 2 (thus rounded to 1) the "average damage per second" is higher than "0.5". there's a much larger chance to hit the "1".
---
I bought a bond to jump start my smith. I’m pretty much self sustaining at 70 mining 70 smith. I superheat addy bars for cash

That is strange

Should just do what rs3 did where the more valuable your gear the more you have to pay to reclaim it.

People did fight caves for fun? What's the point after getting fire cape?
---
I've been mobile afking for about 2 months now at work and I go for 15-20 minutes with no logout. Using super combats and absorbs
---
I did mage only for my first kill with a lesser set up than that. I camped mystic might on green rotation and hid on mage phases. After jad phase I just went straight for dps and it worked out. Not sure there's much more you can do. Toxic trident?
---
I had 99 Runecrafting before Summoning was released, and I have 80 Runecrafting on my current OSRS account. I know how the skill works, and I put that knowledge to use. It doesn't mean I don't still think it's an underwhelming skill with an unjustified XP rate.
---
Bruh fuck that. I would be so incredibly pissed. I dont want to grind out agility, such aids.
---
Maybe if it was a game that didn't d/c you at random moments. Only reason I'll never play a hcim
---
SOTE is wayyyy too much. MEP2 would be fine.

You forgot to post this from your main acc btw

I got it on 5 kc, my man. Just get it? I dont understand

---
With working fulltime aswell, guess it helps I can play mobile for 1-2 hrs a day while working though
---
You clearly have no knowledge about the skill if you think it's slow.  
---
It's over 100K exp an hour from level 50.
---
Doing something like a blackflip with fire coming out of your ass sounds like a good idea.
---
I’d recommend trying a small switch to blowpipe, it will give you some extra worthwhile damage. If not this and you’re just going for diaries hide behind pillars on blue phase and just attack red and green phases.
---
I *should* be but a few deaths due to crashes and disconnects just demotivated me.
---
replace the cape with max cape
---
Low/Mid level ironman wanting to do a couple zulrah kills to see if i get lucky. K Top or Blessed D Hide?
---
Fair enough, I can’t disagree with what you enjoy!
---
Training is also just *fun*. If you can find a gym you mesh with, with coaches and other fighters that actually care about training smart, fighting is fun as fuck.
---
In a game where you can literally do magic, why would you ever try to apply logic. There is none in magic. There is none in a lot of RS.
---
I think its been reduced down to 20 minutes  before your items respawn after death.
---
So there’s a chance?
---
Hi
---
You're the type of dude to believe everything he sees on CNN.
---
Jagex is a business, if someone spends 62k on RS it's their problem, not Jagex's.
---
Sounds about right
---
But won't buy my stock of 5000 water walking potions brewed in the mages guild basement
---
Finally getting around to doing mm2, about nearly killed myself after failing platforms for 3 hours. Finally got it and nuked that entire structure
---
Just like Bart!
---
I think you're just misunderstanding a lot of what they've said. None of their comments contradict unless you misinterpret them; except maybe Gambit's tweet. And their answers aren't "all over the place"; they've said the same things over and over across multiple platforms yet you are acting like it is super confusing and unclear.
---
I do agree that the whole announcing an announcement thing is a bit silly and that the reveal isn't the most informative on specifics. But we don't have the blog yet and the reveal was just introducing us to the concept, which doesn't conflict with any further details they've given. You don't have to track comments over 3 social media for days to know they are planning it to be worthwhile even if you don't no -life; they said that right from the getgo and repeated it like a dozen times.
---
And also the deadman comment you made completely misses the point of what was said. They never said it wasn't starting from scratch like you seem to be claiming. They said it wouldn't feel like starting a new main account from scratch because of the bonuses and perks that will change the gameplay. That is not the same as claiming you don't start on a fresh account like mentioned in the reveal and cropping comments to try and twist that into something else is either a failure to understand on your part or manipulative.
---
Exactly like me, I was mad when I got the pet before any claws, 900 kc. No leathers, not even a completed ring.
---
Same with Cerberus, 1 hell puppy, 4 pegasians, 600kc 
---
I just can’t make money lol
---
Those 1000 whales bring in more money than 1/3 of our player base.. so yeah they are important.
---
Why is the Kharidian desert the only area unfinished with those black boundaries, rather than a shoreline?
---
Yea that your a fuckin weirdo. Get something better todo.
---
Or you could just stop being a baby and crying about PvP occurring in the one PvP area in the game lmao.
---
I got this guy on kc 167 then I got supreme on kc 421, pretty lucky I think

What client is this??
---
Plot twist, this is the Asian guy trying to steal the account. Top effort!

I don’t think they design these because people get bored, but rather it’s something they think people would like and have asked for.

I probably won’t play it, but I still think it’s a good use of dev time
---
Some crops regrow such as fruits/cacti/bushes/trees but you can only check health once
---
Maybe, but I'm friends with several chubsters and there is a distinction. It still looks kind of round, whereas you can see some of that muscular tonality here typical of working out.
---
Did you mean to say thieving twice or nah
---
Pking is fun, its just a shame you need to grind to get the stats to do it
---
Ah so you're one of those ones who has an auto clicker on and died then stood in front of nmz clicking prayer on and off for several hours. Gg account.

Id probably finish the task without it tbh
---
Lol right this guy sucks

regardless of swearing, he's actually an amazing dad. I can vouch for this as I know him irl.

Fire runes are pretty chill, easy, and fast for your level. Just teleport to the Duel Arena with a Ring of Dueling, bank at Castle Wars, and repeat. Once you reach level 40, Astrals are a good option (requires Lunar Diplomacy). They're faster XP than most runes (other than combo runes), good profit, and you don't go through the Abyss so there's no risk of getting PK'ed.
---
Lavas are quite fast, but extremely click intensive, and magic imbue is basically mandatory. The idea is this:
---
* Instead of clicking the altar to craft the essence in your inventory, you use a stack of earth runes on the fire altar. This gives you a combined earth/fire rune (lava).
---
* Normally in order to do the craft, you must consume an Earth talisman. But if you've cast Magic Imbue recently, this requirement is removed.
---
* You only have a 50% chance to successfully create a combination rune for each rune you're attempting to craft. So if you have 20 essence in your inventory, on average you'll only get about 10 lavas (and you'll only get xp for those 10). Wearing a Binding Necklace increases this to 100%, so you'll always get 20 lavas and full xp. Binding necklaces have limited charges.
---
So if you've cast Magic Imbue and you're wearing a Binding Necklace, the only difference is that instead of clicking the altar you click your Earth runes instead, and use them on the altar.

If u get 91 rc before 80 con or 99 slayer, i guess sure. U just spellbook swap in house between tasks since ur teleing out anyway.

Make everyone ironman

So literally nothing?

Jesus man just buy gold for that first bond. don't grind f2p it's cancer

Oh I've always thought that people are just memeing, since its stupid afk after 77, but thanks for the insight!

Lms is a decent minigame but has no real rewards lol

Ok go and breach it and see what happens. Official or not you’ll get fucked.
---
Tbh I wouldn't bother with blowpipe, the cost isn't really worth it at barrows imo, I would just stick to trident (minus for Ahrim ofc). But the rest is fine!

I dunno man, ask her yourself.

Dude, if I'm a Knight I'm grey af.

It's just your grottiness that makes me look white in comparison.

If you don't feel like paying attention and stay quite efficient get yourself the stats to do barbarian fishing, it's quite afk and will propulse your early agility and strenght levels while also being the best fishing xp in the game

Worst insult ever
---
Proud to call W420 home
---
If you are doing it purely for money solo will end up being better. If you do duo you will have to try getting all the drops to you can keep getting the noted bones drop.

Well you still could farm it on your pure because sote doesn't hahe a defence req?

Oof sorry my guy, I got mine last night at only 3777 kc, still not sure it's real cause I drank a LOT beforehand
---
Same, he has been a really great father, since I have known him. I remember when I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in, but Austin.
---
I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Austin, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Austin put down his magazine, picked up my niece and played Sea Shanty 2 on his phone. He then lifted up his shirt while the song played and breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.
---

That's probably the joke dude, no need to be a dick. It's not like nobody realizes he's big.

Play rs3 then

It's a brand new account. Whatever stats I can obtain in a day or two.

Really against leagues but thats a fair point like

Just 24 years short of that 99 rc, baby!
---
is this fanfic
---
Looks like amulet of the damned
---
lmao sounds about right tho.
---
I have been troubleshooting for the past two days trying to fix this...   It's exactly as you describe, every 30 seconds just a few ticks lost. 
---
I only play on aussie worlds, so I wouldn't know if the lag on other worlds is normal behaviour. Glad to hear it MIGHT be Jagex's fault and not my internet being trash.
---
Nerf slayer and bossing (alchables and resource drops)
---
Put cooldown on POH pools or make them cost a little bit to continuously use
---
More skilling content eith unique rewards, stops repetive grinds
---
There's 21 different items on Rex's drop table with a 1/128 chance. Those 2 RoL drops could've been Fremmy blades or Warrior rings instead too.
---
They get banned and created every few hours.
---
W420 is home world for me. Doing zulrah pretty much every single day of the week
---
Agreed and it looks like an official sponsor too. 9 year old me definitely would have fallen for it.
---
I believe in a Q&amp;A a few weeks back the Jmods said they actually have content in mind where black graceful would fit perfectly. With Runefest coming up in around 15 days I'm guessing they may announce they they actually plan on adding it. Can't wait, for both black graceful and the Runefest 2020 announcements!
---
Leave it runecrafting is absolutely fine people have this idea that it’s terrible only because there used to high xp rates, if you sat down and grinded 99 runecrafting it would mean a lot more to you and anyone else compared to any buyable 99 or collector(minus mining, fuck mining)
---
I dont see why the us parliaments and such are after facebook for their use of cookies and perzonalized ads when scam ads like these imo are a much bigger problem
---
No Tzhaar Floors , start over :’(
---
That runelite feature also works really well with Zalcano. You have to individually mark the 4 possible ore locations when they do appear, but once you get them all marked it eliminates all the guess work in to what ore you should be mining instead of finding the slightly brighter ore, which is all the vanilla client gives you to find which ore to mine.
---
Sote?
---
RNG isnt really a factor for bot farms as they do so many runs that they should overall always remain really close to expected values per hour
---
Accidentally hit delete when I meant to hit edit.
---
It was a mistake to say animation smoother would ever make it to polls. Like Jagex would ever put time into that. Good thing too.
---
No, the game is still not for *you*. I'm the one who's actually playing the game as it's intended. You're the one using a bunch of plug-ins to change the game to your whims because you don't like how it's supposed to be played. And just because a lot of people use it doesn't mean the game should bend to your whims. The number also doesn't account who's using it for better performance with no additional plug-ins/people using plug-ins I *don't* have a problem with (plus whatever minority is using it because they're on Linux).
---
"A lot of us paying members want to see the game evolve beyond its roots and become more than a time capsule."
---
A game can evolve without changing it's aesthetic.
---
Alright, question for ya. What did you think of the elves new chatheads (the original new chatheads when SOTE launched, not the recent reworks.)
---
I'm with u in that one, although pre 77 I'm not so sure lol
---
How does it prove that? It's has alot of teleports because there's alot of different content and different areas. Yes it's very big, why is it "too big" ?
---
I'm 73 RC purely from tears and lamps. 2.7k hours played
---
Nah u a dumbass for sure
---
Its somewhere in the settings (wrench icon). Not exactly sure where but just poke around, you'll find it
---
People were doing it long before "a certain third party client" using a different third party client.
---
I believe Feldip hills and Piscatoris area were both like that too.
---
What difference does it make
---
it doesnt matter whether or not you agree with it, most people dont slay with an xp rate per hour that surpasses that of lavas.
---
Still better then rs3... feel sorry for new players.
---
I watch too many podcasts and YouTube/gaming drama videos at work lol
---
everything about this is wrong
---
It's hilarious that you've tried to spin it that it's a positive thing for the kid and that it's definitely not due to your lack of vocabulary.

Could be mistaken but I think you can also right click the high alch spell

---
I'm not sure how this is an example of poor communication as the OSRS League introduction blog wasn't intended to describe every detail about the rewards.
---
Jagex devs have said that there would be cosmetic rewards and that they would elaborate in detail in a future blog. Omitting something where it doesn't belong that will later be properly described later isn't poor communication.
---
Not really, they're showing the mtx is good af for the company. Putting added pressure onto the higher ups to get it into osrs

Is but not in osrs
---
Dude... have you even played lms in f2p recently. Legit 80% bots. Its a game of who can kill the most bots first.
---
This is also at the most western sulphur deposit
---
60-72 rc is still a haze for me
---
Dont close runelite for 1k kills. Bam.
---
Yes on mobile it even has a get bond button.
---
Yes but not is osrs and look at cosmetics in rs3 it’s a shit show
---
80% bots.
---
RC ok, 60 mining for lunar diplomacy is the real grind

You should pray mage at wyrms but buddy was so high he was praying melee. Not sure why you were downvoted

RC is faster than agility and you can alch/fletch while rcing.
---
I have beast net. But live in west Australia. I get 80ms to aus, 200ms to us, 300ms to eu and over 400ms on the other one. I pk primarily on us and eu worlds. If someone bitches about 150ms they are fucking pathetic.

So 1 out of 50 people will go this dry. It isn't even that uncommon to go this dry then lol.
---
They're 2M/H to run. The fact that you're not using it non-stop doesn't make that expense less absurd. If the extra income from maxed dps is smaller than the money spent on darts, it's not worth it.
---
If the time saved is not worth over the cost of using the supplies, it's not worth doing it that way. This is a rule. 
---
There are people bad with money and maths, I'm not arguing that.
---
lmao just get lucky??? idk why your whinin
---
The wilderness is designed for people to kill you. It's how the game is balanced
---
That's the lie. The purchase is always a choice, but the problem is that offers such as "Limited time only" or "Look what you can have" work best on people during times when they aren't thinking clearly.
---
I'm sure you have, at some point, impulse bought something after seeing a coupon lying around while you were upset about a break up or losing a job or failing a test. Doesn't have to be big, maybe something as small as a burger or a pizza as a little pick me up. Chances are also high that what you bought was something convenient and familiar. You definitely did not go to some hole in the wall you've never been to, heck you probably didn't even leave your house. You ordered Domino's or Pizza Hut because you had a flier lying around that they mail biweekly.
---
And with that, you fell victim to predatory advertising. In this instance, it was small scale, almost unnoticeable. However, maybe you had an entire week that was in a slump and during that whole week you just ate nothing but burgers and pizzas and burritos because they were easy and comfortable. You probably don't think your purchases were bad and they were, by all means, your choice.
---
Maybe another time, you were thinking about how you might need toilet paper and there was a flier for an econo-sized toilet paper bundle on sale at your local supermarket that was one day only! Wow! It's more toilet paper than you could ever use in a year! You probably bought it because hey, you don't need to buy toilet paper again for a whole year! You made such a good choice, right? Well, newsflash, you fell victim to predatory advertising.
---
When you apply the principals of a poor state of mind due to stress and depression with limited time deals, all while slapping them in your face, then it's not so easy to just say no. If your life is going poorly because your girlfriend left you, your parents died, your dog got shot by your neighbor and you got laid off and you just want something, anything to go right in your life and you see a promotion for triple keys during an erupting lamp promotion that could finally bump you into doing Plague's End, then by all means you do have a choice. You can choose to say yes.
---
Wow this is brilliant!
---
The second time I did it I did it in an hour on xanax

---
OSRS has tonnes of cosmetics, and you could definitely class the holiday event rewards as seasonal cosmetics. Just because they're not flashing heart trails and Dragonball Z run animations doesn't mean they're not cosmetic.
---
it's impresive how confident you're on that confabulation
---
Didn't happen - 1/100000000000000
---
Wrong. This child will be trained to train rc while the father sleeps
---
Biggest problem is you probably made a fresh account. There is a huuuuuge bottleneck for fresh acccounts. Mid level and beyond are infinitely less likely To get banned
---
Not probably true, you can literally see the dates on the tweets
---
Think more that theres a bunch of 17 year old deadbeats that are worthless that plays OSRS. theres so many factors so
---
The body and legs are useless at higher end play due to this, but the other three pieces are completely functional replacements for the original items, seeing as only the body and leg pieces can be augmented in the first place. There are far better pieces of gear to use in those other slots, but most aren't going to use hailfires for the boot slot or a tectonic mask in the brain slot since those have to be essentially replaced every now and again. Same for celestial handwraps in the glove slot, but if you can't afford 200k you've got a bigger fuckin' problem.
---
Is this real? It’s texas so it’s a legit question.

Lol this dude was live the other day on another fake account, just report it and move on.

What is the problem with f2p lms?
---
Literally gave you the solution but you're welcome to keep using your dumbass way of doing it if it makes you feel like you won an argument. Meanwhile I just got base 90s at work on my phone and had this entire Reddit conversation simultaneously. What a time to be alive!
---
Its not your kid, and she isnt getting harmed in this vid. Saying shit in front of a little kid isnt the end of the world and not going to corrupt her, dumb comment imo.
---
more like everyone hates everyone
---
There was one but they deleted it and made the only one f2p because it was so dead
---
This is the correct answer
---
Turning in fossils is a free 130k xp. Will also help the grind.
---
I kind of like it. The rng is sort of needed to not make it linear everytime, though sometimes you have a bad one and just feel super unlucky. For me the rewards feel rather lackluster though.
---
big F.
---
I bless thee with my luck of getting it within 20 kills.
---
Do people just see things on the internet and just assume they are true?
---
Wrong subreddit
---
You start the game and have to kill as many bots as u can untill you fond a real player which may have killed way more bots than you and heavily out gear you. 
---
Quick que times are nice but its fucking aids. Most the bots now just bolt rag with pray melee up untill they run out of food. 
---
It makes getting wins much easier too. Like i have about 15 wins that were basically free because the bots. 
---
And as much fun as it is, taking pkers out of the wild is not a good thing. We already have way to many worlds for the pvp playerbase size. 
---
Working on my 4th halo on my pure. I have played a lot.

It's called fat.
---
I think Jad isnt the worst content but its certainly pretty shit. 
---
Its half an hour to an hour of mind-numbing boredom followed by 15 seconds of high-stakes Simon says where the penalty for not doing what Simon says is the waste of that entire run.
---
Difficult bosses can work in osrs, Im a big fan of Galvek and raids.  Just when the main thing that makes a bossfight "hard" is that you have to waste time doing stupid bullshit if you fail/want to practice the boss - yeah no thats just anti-fun dawg.  Its necessary to make jad seem difficult because in the final accounting, the Simon says isnt a hard one, especially with bp, so if people didn't have everything they learned from an attempt rotted out with 60 waves of nothing every attempt, it'd be a joke to learn.
---
Long, boring grindups to re-attempt a boss is an example of fake difficulty, which is a failure of game design that differentiates good hard games (dank souls) from bad hard games (Takeshis challenge).  Considering Jad was the runescape team's first attempt to make anything remotely skill-based in a game that very much wasn't, this oopsie is excusable.   Nonethless, Jad sticks out like a sore thumb compared to newer content, for better or for worse.
---
What?
---
Wish they’d just make it “lowest time in game to get a fire cape during the season” for some middle ground

This changes everything

---
You enjoy spending 4 min in a world, then a lvl 3 bot calls out ur location. Followed by 50 people logging in spearing you to death and spamming #somestupidclanname
---
It doesnt lock away any content you need though elsewhere in the game. 
---
If you see a skill as a chore, then that's a you problem, you could apply that argument to any of the skills if you wanted to.
---
It's a grindy game, cant be annoyed when you gotta grind.
---
The only thing I think needs changing about runecrafting is the way essence is gathered, almost only for Ironmen, really. Of course it would benefit regular accounts but would benefit the btws moreso
---
It doesn't make sense to YOU.
---
If you're doing a 500k/H npc with a whip and using a scythe allows you to kill 20% more of that bitch in an hour, because of the 20% extra dps it brings in to the table, you'll end with 20% extra of those 500k, which would be +100k, so 600k/H total income now.
---
But you would spend 1200k on the scythe. So +600k -1200k= -600k/H
---
If the money making is 5,000k /H with a whip, and 6200k/ with a scythe, both weapons would be as good for profits, but scythe would be superior for pet hunt for example, without any opportunity cost as it wouldn't be losing profits in comparision.
---
You might be to dumb for this.
---
Hope, they will release you of this pain any soon.
---
I'd leave it as is. I briefly thought about what the skill could be if we were able to write a rune on other materials.
---
you need stats to be able to afford to get bonds every 2 weeks without playing 12 hours a day
---
Damn that’s crazy! If I did all that in wrath runes I’d craft 22.7M wrath runes X 400 each = 9.1B. Holy shit.
---
this might be a record tbh
---
Seriously? That is ludicrously dumb. Are they usable on the likes of vorago/araxxor as well? I only mention them as they were the last bosses released prior to me quitting the game so I'm unsure what if any new bosses came out.
---
I don't believe they're usable on rise of the 6. but then again what do I know L
---
I know, I've said this 20 times in comments, but there's no other rooms I need.
---
Just take brews. You shouldnt run out of supplies at all
---
host runefest at my place instead and ill give u a free glass of water and some doritos
---
Dad?
---
I hope so too :(
---
I'm already about 650+ skill just from mild grinding in the past month, other than wine farming I don't even play the game anymore. F2P is so shit so I often find myself logging into GE, standing there for 5 minutes and logging out lol
---
Yea you're right. Just on a maxed 60atk piety LMFAO.
---
Fair enough. But I do have to take into account that DHCB is more than twice as expensive as Rigour, so I would be able to take advantage of Rigour much earlier.
---
I like master clues and hunting for all the pets
---
I dislike the rev caves and pvping in general. Especially the pvper community
---
This. It’s fire
---
Elite Void will probably take the longest, though. And I hate the skills that need 70+. I should still get it, though...
---
just buy a membership, its cheap
---
I started vorkath yesterday and used blowpipe w/ eagle eye, elite void (melee swap for BGS spec), salve (ei) etc. 
---
I noticed I could only get 1 kill per trip, which is not a very good money maker. Especially since I was learning the mechanics of the fight.
---
I agree with you, I am selling bank to buy DHCB to exclusively grind vork to buy rigour &amp; do skilling when I burn out. 
---
Rigour is good for many things, but for vorkath specifically DHCB is much better in terms of DPS and kills per trip.
---
Hate both but Antifa is more autistic imo. "Everyone that is anti fascist belongs with Antifa. We're fighting in your cause"

The Scythe price crash started on August 26th.
---
http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/Scythe_of_vitur_(uncharged)/viewitem?obj=22486
---
Classic WoW was released on August 26th. If enough end game players moved to WoW, that could cause demand for the Scythe to fall.
---
The reason I’m pointing this out is that there could be other things causing this drop than just cheat clients.
---
You don't get them for logins. You'd need one dart for each phase too of raxx. There are 4
---
I would very much like both. Please.
---
unrelated, when is the osrs league thing coming out?
---
How much gp/hr do you profit with bp? And what's your ranged level?

Then nobody will want to start the fight because of the large disadvantage they'd be at

Oi you stole my screenshot... That I stole from YouTube! Scoundrel.

Agreed, totally kills the newbie old school vibe
---
fuck that's adorable
---
Imagine thinking swearing in front of kids was good for them.
---
Doing a lot of slayer tasks, it’s less tedious, you explore more areas, get good drops at times. Make sure you are using a slayer master suited to your combat and be sure not to let them ignore your combat level .
---
By doing slayer tasks you’ll be focusing on the kill count rather than how much xp until your next strength level, so you’ll feel you are levelling up quicker in my opinion
---
Ah, obviously you didn't read the story.
---
What a beautiful duwang.
---
And then with less activity on pvp worlds, an increase in pvm pkers would increase. Still sound good to you?
---
Yeah after seeing all these different comments i just gave up and said to my self “sounds cool, guess we will see what happens when they launch it”
---

Assuming 2.5m profit per hour. Rigour takes about 20 hours and it's a lot more fun to do imo. 68 farming, 69 hunter, 70 mining and 75 thieving are all skills I hate and most of them take a really long time (At least for someone that doesn't spend all his free time on the game). I think the skills take longer to train than it does to make enough money for decent gear. Anyways, I'll probably slowly build my character because I'm gonna need it eventually. Thanks for the advice :)
---
Open for criticism and further ideas. Since I invested like 30minutes to this idea, it is pretty likely that there are some major loopholes that could be used to gain an advantage. Feel free to point them out lol.
---
the odds heavily favour tanmans statement
---
RS3 is not a bad game, it's just that people don't want to try it out because they wouldn't feel the nostalgic connection to it like we do for osrs. I hate that some people just say that cause it's different and caters to an audience who would like to see the game advanced and move forward with new ideas.
---
\*chuckles\* nothing personnel, kid
---
Vork pretty easy. Although, he can hit massive damage if you misclick.
---
Remove non-skullers in pvp, it's time
---
Holy fuck, give this man a medal
---
I know!
---
Dude could've milked at least a week out of this. 1 day is weak shit.
---
You can switch what you’re doing every hour for any skill. Slayer just forces you to.
---
Thanks, you too.
---
Remember it’s a master quest, not a grand master, so people that attempt it will have lower levels in general than people doing ex. sote, and the early grinds are often the worst. I absolutely hated the thieving grind for desert treasure, much more than the 68 mining for ds2 or 70’s for sote, because those quest were the last steps towards endgame. 55 runecraft will, to many, be another obstacle before another obstacle before another obstacle. 
---
If I had 180 qp with 1400 total and 35 runecraft I don’t think I would bother unless the new helmet is at least as essential as the nezzy is now.
---
Yeah no I was pking. Good guess tho. That's a good escape idea if you were doing some pvming in singles and a solo pker got on you.
---
Tbh they keep saying contradictory stuff so I am just..l confused
---
Could have posted it yesterday. Fml.
---
didnt see you type the "say gz pls" so when it popped up it cracked me up.
---
gz haha
---
&gt; buff slayer profit
---
  
---
When does this shit end.
---
Currently using Vannaka as I am CB level 55ish. I find the tasks vary drastically from kill 8 cave bugs to kill 40 lvl 82 Ankous. But I suppose it is more fun than just sand crab farming.
---
In RS3, theres a fishing platform that occasionlly has a "Traveling Merchant" that sells darts for 1m I think. Maybe 5m, but its piss easy to make money in Rs3
---
Yeah I was pking, zgs has one of the best specs for multi pking with the 20 sec freeze. Also I with a clan that holds the same world's everyday so we have rules against big plus ones to avoid mace teams coming to our worlds.
---
Combat is actually AFK as Fuck especially for higher levels. Slayer just gives you that additional incentive to do it, and with slayer helm or black mask you accelerate the combat xp gains. Having said that slayer is indeed slower IMO but so fucking much easier.
---
Runecraft slow is not even the right meme. It's because it's slow and also one of the most intense skills for how much clicking  and paying attention you have to do.
---
I have no clue if a council is the right way to go about this. It's quite clear now that quite a large portion of the playerbase does not like certain pvp-updates. I think a large part of that is due to pvp, in it's current form, feels a lot like a pker versus a non-pker. 
---
The solution is to remove unnecessary content from the wilderness and make the wilderness fun and viable for pkers trying to kill other pkers. There is zero fun for the non-pker who is targetted because he will always be at a disadvantage. 
---
If I would be doing prayer, catching chins or killing a boss I *do not* like to be pked or fought. Also because I'm actively engaging in that certain activity I have a disadvantage fighting back due to having less supplies. Add on top of that the chances to get skull-tricked or "lured" into multi (if you're not in multi already) and clanbanged without anything you can do to prevent that. 
---
This causes frustration for non-pkers and friction between pkers and non-pkers. People are not going to vote against their own best wishes. Giving an incentive for pkers to seek out and fight other players with the same intent and who are ready to battle will ease this friction and increases the chances of pkers getting what they want. 
---
Note: This is all my opinion and I may be totally wrong. Please think for yourself if you agree or not.
---
Id say throwing knives at people that want to kill you, to try and kill them, youll not be able to take a step back or wait for them to be the exact right distance..
---
You go to the "create a new account" page.

is rapier not worth it here over a tent? any reason why it wouldnt

For the sake of the words themselves kids should have to hide their swearing until older.

If six year olds are walking around saying "this shit fucking sucks" infront of parents, then "this shit fucking sucks" is the same as saying "this stinks".

This whole segregating votes based on "not having to interact with content" is dangerous. What's next only max players can vote on new skills, because "you don't have to interact with the new skill". Same can be done for quests.

The irony is my fletching level is twice my range level... and my username contains the word 'Arrow'. The shame of it all.

People that have never played runescape before join everyday, and I assume many quit because there's no easy pointers of what to do

Everyone is equal, but the biggest whiners are more equal?

tracert shows my packets are getting sent to the US

Yeah that's kinda what i'm looking for, a tough fight which feels like a boss fight, not just mindlessly grinding mobs.
---
What if the council is a general player council, with a remit to discuss things like PvP, but is comprised of players from all backgrounds?

The whole point of bringing back old school was to retain the feel of how PvP and gameplay was pre EoC. Why did we bother petitioning...
---
Is there a Sir Rebral?
---
depends i guess i just find it easier/ more afk to woodcut yews and bank at the guild. keep in mind im playing at work and only tap the screen every few mins or so
---
Any chance deadman mode will ever be brought back? I feel like that's all pvpers had left and now its gone. Even short seasons, or even weekend DMM seasons would be a lot of fun.
---
This is exactly what I meant and exactly what the diagram shows. Further to this, it basically cuts the cost of all skills down to 1/3, which is a bit mental if you think about it
---
Sort of depends on what you're cutting/fishing but in general fish are worth more than logs.
---
we gotta restrict pvm updates so that only pvmers vote on it and we should get a pvm council to design stuff
---
high level content aimed at people with total level over 2k should only be able to be voted on by people with people over 2k total and we should have hlf for osrs 
---
i get that you guys are trying to work on solutions, i really get it and appreciate the effort, but you see how this is silly
---
why do we gotta worry about spite vote from one particular group? do you not think that other people spite vote? do you think that people not just genuinely think something may or may not be good for the game?
---
maybe we could detail pvp blogs some more so ppl out of the loop could have some more info. but otherwise why do we need to have a special council for pvp?
---
I feel like the idea is good, coming from someone who doesn't pvp.
---
Although I would like to point out one thing. I think (and someone can tell me if I'm wrong) that the reason LMS rewards failed the poll was because the entire osrs community in general thought they were just bad rewards. To be fair, you can't expect any game-changing rewards from a game that costs nothing.
---
Anyways, I'd love to see a barrows-style minigame in deep wildy, still fully pvp, designed to obtain those wildy weapons. Would be a great system I think.
---
Start your own and ask for +3 until you are a 4 man.
---
Or join a team when someone says world (x) +1.
---
Or say looking for team.
---
People don’t want to do zalcano with more than 4 people as it reduces the gp/h.
---
Mark the tiles in Runelite by using shift and right click on the tile and selecting mark tile.   
---
Then find a good rotation guide and follow it.   
---
I got my first kill the other day after about 10 attempts (some very silly mistakes in there). The first attempt where I managed to 'stay ahead' of the rotations and had in my head where I need to move, what prayer and what gear to use when it next changes was when I got the kill.   
---
You don't want to be thinking 'what am I doing now' because you'll spend more time eating than attacking.
---
Then remove all non PvP content from the wild also then, lol. The system isn’t broken, we all said it’s time to bring back OsRS now everyone wants it to change. The stupid thing is, half the shit that came into RS3 is now already on OS as a much shittier version, Dominion vs NMZ ect
---
Its on his stomach and parts of his legs they are like diamonds kinda and no i reddit on mobile
---
LMS doesn't need attachments to pvm drops....
---
It could work, but that is so many voices. You are going to have to parse everyone's opinions. And when you make your decision, someone is always going to be unhappy.
---
Wait, what setup did you use at Ammo crabs? 
---
I recall XP/h being much higher there. 
---
3-spot Spawn and void + Msb with Rune arrows should be &gt;70k XP/h.
---
When you reset, repot and use spec for even better rates.
---
I've always found it insane that PvP content is pretty much the top tier of marketing for OSRS, and people just act like it's this niche thing that Jagex pity caters to.
---
Like Torvesta is literally the most viewed OSRS Youtuber in the past two years, getting 300k+ views a video once or twice a week, and he is exclusively PvP content.
---
afk woodcutting at work yet again
---
Honestly I hope the scythe drops to 400mil. Why? Because then I'd be able to brag that I lost 1 billion gold on a single item. At this point loosing 800mil isn't impressive enough.
---
Tbh Kieren would kick that guys ass in real life and in game .. Kieren is a champ 🥇🥇🥇🥇🏆🏆
---
OHHHHHHH gotcha. Would the method I said work tho?
---
are you serious? Why would they poll people who dont PVP about PVP content. The reason PVP content barely gets passed is because of PVMers. Also Jagex catering to PVPers is soooo skewed. 99% of the content in this game is PVM. Just because Jagex finally begins to address the issues with PVP they are now catering to PVP is nonsense.
---
repost
---
But u get the pet faster.
---
If you can’t cut down a tree, using 1 hand, through a fence, then you don’t deserve to be in the WC guild to begin with 😤
---
a super majority voted for warding the only reason it didn't pass was because of the high bar set for content coming into the game. almost every quest that has been polled has passed because it's content people actually want to see. the player base wants the game to advance but stuff like MTX and EOC aren't an advancement. RS3 combat is basically just a shittier version of WOW so why would you bother with the inferior product when it comes to that? OSRS actually gives you a unique gaming experience that i haven't seen anywhere else and that's honestly it's biggest appeal so when jagex decided to get rid of the thing that made runescape so different from the competition they also got rid of any reason to play it over the other games.
---
Cool, it isn't your loot then since ironmen dont get to loot. Play a normal account lol.
---
Weren't those rock lobsters? Or am I thinking of crimson charms?
---
For sure. It's hard to know where to begin. Fortunately we've got valuable contacts at other studios who do use player councils, so we're keen to learn from them.
---
Imagine reposting someone elses exact thread from less than 24 hours ago 😁
---
Amen! If I want a battle pass I'll play apex, if I want leagues I'll play diablo or PoE, stop putting this shit in old school, they are so thirsty for new players who leave after 2 weeks that they are completely clueless as to what the dedicated playerbase wants. Deadman - dead, leagues - gonna be dead, oldschool if they continue to try to put in dumb shit - dead
---
I think they said they intend to bring it back at some point. Just not in the form of how it was previously since it became something either you played for an unhealthy amount of time or you joined a clan and became part of clanmanmode
---
problem with that is that ur not gonna be 100% honest ye, in a straight up discussion wit ppl only the most legit honest ppl are gonna say "well look i dont like this b/c the new pvp weapon will make it rly hard for me to escape when im doing x content in the wildy cuz its so much better then what ppl bring now and id get shanked" 
---
but thats how it do be and its a legitimate opinion to have and some ppl might vote on that and they would be entitled to their opinion (even if i would disagree)
---
dumbdowned copypasta version, 3rd time the charm. Hope a jmod read this.
---
Suggestion: Clan/Team battleroyale and tournament items.
---
This is my suggestion on how to solve todays stale gameplay and thus losing motivation to keep playing osrs (ref. point 3 and 4 in the pros section). 
---
By introducing battleroyale i think we can solve the current problems that we face today with osrs (ref. pros section).
---
Clan/Guild System
---
In order for this to work and log any achievements such as ratings, we need to prioritise to make a clan/guild system. If the answer is “engine restrictions, maybe in a few years”, can Jagex tell us what is currently possible to do with the engine restriction?
---
Team BattleRoyale
---
Introduce a clan/guild battle royale (100v100, 50v50, 25v25) with yearly competitions as an eSport. The battle/field map should consist of where you need skillers to gather supplies, PvMers to kill monsters for weapon/armour and then PvPers to duke it out with the opponent at the end. The battle map should have meta changes over seasons.
---
Make it so that everyone can participate regardless of combat/skilling levels (everyone has the same stats), but the tournament items used in the tournament setting will differ for everyone.
---
Tournament items
---
Also introduce tournament items that can be obtained from the main game by doing various activities (raids, minigames, skilling, etc), it will have a very low droprate, hardest to obtain for players to have ever seen. The tournament items will be specifically used inside the battle arena and anything outside of the arena, it will act as a cosmetic item.
---
For example, everyone starts with atleast a diamond pickaxe (tier 0), but if you obtained a diamond pickaxe (tier 2) in the main game, you start with a diamond pickaxe (tier 2). And when you are upgrading your diamond pickaxe (tier 2) to an obsidian pickaxe (tier 0), “note that diamond pickaxe (tier 5) will be WORSE than obsidian pickaxe (tier 0)”, if you have obtained obsidian pickaxe (tier 5) in the main game, the pickaxe will be upgraded into obsidian pickaxe (tier 5) instead of obsidian pickaxe (tier 0) ingame. You see where im going with this?
---
The strength of the tier progression will improve very little, but it is a necessity to have to solve the economical and powercreep problems of the main game.
---
The tournament items itself will be tradeable for all (including ironman), it can only be purchased or sold with a new currency on the grand exchange. You need to convert gp or high volume items to said currency (tournament gold) to make the trade, and converting is non reversible.
---
Step 4: Crowd funding the competition by releasing battlepasses. Non harmful rewards for the battlepass owners can be further discussed. One example is to make an another cosmetic item have the graceful effect (providing you have graceful), just to diversify the current state of fashionscape like the old days (right now the majority is wearing full graceful set for non combat activities).
---
Pros: 
---
1. Unite all players together and creating a true competitive endgame environment against others.
---
2. End the cycle of monotonous grind as in competing with yourself. Such as petscape, skilling past 99, making another account or doing ToB for a scythe drop so you can do more ToB.
---
3. More players to not quit the game when they reach end game and new players start coming in due to peak interest of a clan/guild PvP scenario where you team up with your friends and going against other players.
---
4. No more what new items should be released during new updates that leads to powercreep or dead content in the long run when you can slow it down by introducing tournament item as a drop. 
---
5. Players and clan mates would start doing various activities together trying to obtain tournament items and hopefully in the future we can get more group activity updates (its an mmorpg ffs). 
---
6. Item sink and gp sink from the main game if tournament items are introduced.
---
7. If battlepass are introduced and is successful &gt; higher pay for Jagex employers &gt; happy employers &gt; better updates &gt; more players &gt; more membership revenue &gt; more support for osrs main game &gt; longer life expectancy for osrs.
---
8. Does not affect the main game in a harmful way at all.
---
9. Most important of all, fun for the players and for the Jagex team since its a new project to work on.
---
Was the last quest I did too for same reason lol. At least quest itself was quite sweet
---
What kind of imperialistic gearbox is that.
---
Oh christ stop it. You'll say that for any fucking update you dont agree with. (I dont pvp, but this is a good discussion to bring up for those that DO)
---
Fantastic idea for truly new players. Any person that is starting a new account that "wants to remember the old days" will hate the idea of free stuff, but it gives items that generally aren't the BIS for those levels and introduces them to the early weapon tiers in the game.
---
Rocks were for crimson
---
Nice.
---
I am curious what you consider interacting with content. Hard clues and up on 50% of clues require you to go to wildy. If ironman wants a dock they have to go to wildy. Is that what you would consider the criteria? Or is it strictly pvp?
---
Yeah but that's only worth it if u don't have diaries done and need head
---
&gt;it's more important to incentivise PvPers to target other PvPers. 
---
Sure, but those updates don't get added into the game either because black chin hunters spite vote no to anything PvP related.
---
One day soon we shall ride alongside in Gielinor again my friend.
---
If these weren't polled for the wildy, then they wouldn't have been polled with such high rates of xp or gp/h. why do you assume they would've been polled as-is if the situation was 100% different?
---
I only play an iron and am loving it. Working on completing mid game now!
---
This cheered me up man thanks
---
I don't think most people spite vote. If it directly affects PvMers survivability in the wilderness I think most people would vote no but I choose to not believe that people spite vote to try and kill a game they pay for.
---
Whats the point on your comment?
---
I might be wrong in this but he’s not calling the updates themselves good or bad, he’s just saying that Jagex decided to involve PvMers in the PvP scene, and they cannot be excluding them from polls now.
---
Your argument is void.  
---
There are absolutely no Pvmer "victims" in LMS. No-one is being lured into LMS it's a consensual mini-game
---
The poll was purely "Pvp" yet NOTHING passed
---
The polling system favors the pvming majority (which was created through a history of Pvm-focused updates, while Pvpers were completely marginalized and ignored).
---
It's a viscous cycle at the polls, which only gets worse and worse with time
---
Honestly, this sounds good, but I just can't see it working this way in RuneScript. Mod Ash has confirmed that their scripting language doesn't deal in floats. Even something as simple as applying a 12.5% modifier requires them to do something like `x * 9 / 8`. This is also why you won't see an increase in xp/hr in a skill like woodcutting, because your chance to cut a log per tick is an integer out of 128, and it takes several levels to go from, say, a 50/128 chance to a 51/128 chance. There is no 50.5 in-between. Even your xp in a skill is stored as an integer. If you get 50.2 xp, the engine represents this as 502, and divides by 10 (rounding down toward the integer as always) when displaying it to you. This is why xp per skill is capped at 200m, because that number is actually stored as 2 billion, which is close to the signed 32 bit int limit.

I forgot to mention that I’m a duel arena addict who can’t catch a nice break. I’m cleaned &amp; don’t have 10m :-)
---
Task failed!
---
I would have some faith in the Jagex team if they didn't fuck up a lot of other things. 
---
However, after the multiple Deadman Finals that were absolute shit shows to due internal and external reasons. Lets not make a player council due to the community and Jagex knowing how people act when they have an opportunity for exploitation.
---
OSRS barely uses any bandwidth and can't imagine any "wifi admin" is checking every single connection unless it's using a ridiculous amount
---
Judging by your name, I would've guessed you would get 99 farming first, haha. I'm planning on getting 99 agility for my first too. Not sure if I should do prif or agility arena (don't have diaries done so probably prif). I think they're gonna announce black graceful at runefest so saving my marks for that. In any case, good progression bro.
---
Rs pvp is the premiere rs content. It doesnt make up &gt;50% but its definitely the biggest genre.  However, you arent required to do pvp in the game so it feels like some niche. You need to do pvm to get the best pvp gear (ds2, inferno/fight caves, mage arena 2) and you need to skill/quest to get the best pvp/pvm gear (heavy ballista, assembler, barrows gloves).  However there is no progress to be made in pvp, doing pvp doesnt help you do anything, not even pvp. This is an imbalance. 
---
The problem is no one is ever going to vote in favor of something they dont want to do. If you polleded vls to be locked behind 90smithing and crafting, the pvp community would vote bo but the skilling would vote yes because thats content for them even if they dont use it. And since they outnumber pvpers, it passes. Ely/dinhs are terrible designs for pvp yet passed. How is increasing defense by 17.5% in one update not a broken update? 
---
Im not saying make the new bis boots be solely unlocked by getting 1000 unique bh kills or something. But until dangerous pvp is intertwined with the rest of the game, people will treat pvp as some side game. Many will respond with “i dont want to pvp, screw that” but many will say the same about doing pvm for inferno or doing skills/quests for assembler. Thats not a good reason
---
As for the pvp council, i think if the right people get chosen then it could be amazing. Youd have to interview them each individually. I saw your tweet and you only had deep wild single clans. No multi clans, no pures, no zerks, etc. thats worrying me about your mindset. Also i know the people selected for the phone call. Many dont care about the health of the game and simply want to put updates in that cater to their specific style of pking even if it hurts others which I do not feel is a good approach. I dont think anyone in the call wants to sabotage the game but their critical thinking skills may be lacking which is my concern.
---
make more alts 
---
lmao
---
Shoutout to /u/EnixusQ for guessing it too
---
Specifically for the "PvP council"
---
LMS has the biggest potential to introduce all players into PvP and getting the community to better understand PvP.  Both PvP and pve players should be working together to make sure this is a success.  Pkers will always want easier kill methods or QoL to help them kill other players.  Pvers will always want to be invincible in the wilderness or be able to do the wilderness activities without getting ragged.
---
The council should definitely get top PvPers, but it also needs a few (minority) voice of reasons from:
---
1. New player experience.  Someone with less than a year of playtime doesn't want to constantly be oppressed by veterens.
---
2. Pvers with rounded game experience (without unwarranted hatred towards PvP)
---
3. Item balancing.  Can be either PvP or pve, but we can't have a bunch of people who want change for the sake of change pushing 100% of updates theough.  Warding got shot down, the community does not support new for the sake of new content.  We should not be making that exception for PvP either.
---
Overall, this council should be used for ideas, but mostly for refining ideas for Jagex before they poll it or determine it to be integrity.
---
yooooooooooooo HAHAHAHAHA
---
who
---
For what it's worth, I voted no to the clue scrolls because it thematically made no sense to me; I did vote yes to a few of the other rewards, though.  It really felt like some of their proposals should've came from something other than a minigame, in my opinion.
---
dont bother with a spec weapon, but dwh is probably best if you really want to use one
---
I’ve also been saying it for years — instead of focusing on improving PvP mechanics and rewards for the PvP aspect of the wilderness, they’re deliberately trying to get PvMers to the wilderness. 
---
The usual exchange between the two different types of players goes like this:
---
the pvmer wants to kill mobs in the wilderness, but the pker is just going to ambush the pvmer when he’s finished the kill, so the pker gets all the loot.
---
The pvmer complains about it to which the PvP community responds, “tough titties, sit nerd, etc.”
---
So the pvmer stops going to the wilderness, the pkers have nobody to kill, and they start frothing at the mouths, tearing each other apart and bitching *endlessly* about how the wilderness is shit, and nobody ever goes to the wilderness is anymore... and they wonder why(?)
---
Jagex wants to appease the PvP community, clearly. But instead of fixing their fucking game and doing something about the cancerous state of combat and PvP in this game, they deliberately lure pvmers back to the wilderness every once in a while with stupid updates that nobody really wants besides a handful of pkers who think it’ll work to their advantage. 
---
Jagex gets a lot of credit for their PvM and quest content because they deserve it. PvP content in this game is just... awful and inconsistent on so many levels, that it takes an outside encyclopedia and resources like PK videos and streams to fully understand the best ways to fight other players in this game.
---
Who
---
Thats what it was about for you. Bringing Oldschool back meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For many of us, PvP wasn’t even a factor.
---
If the problem is of balancing risk reward there could have been other ways or not added at all. 
---
The question to ask is the intention behind adding those contents. Did devs add it to improve the xp rate and balanced it by putting it the wildy or did they add it to improve wildy activity and balanced it by giving it higher xp rate? A lot of people see it as the latter and obviously not too happy about that.
---
Could've been useful three years ago
---
That is fair, but wouldn't a question that's been around awhile be more likely to have an answer than one that's new?  Having new sorted first makes it more likely for an unanswered question to be at the top and seen/answered sooner.
---
I've tried DWH a couple times and it didn't hit most of the time. Wasn't worth the inventory space unfortunately imo

Most of the time they'd be able to, sometimes they don't check without reason. We don't really check without a reason to here at least. OSRS also uses very little data, surprisingly. Discord uses up more of my data than OSRS mobile. (I have unlimited data so I don't play on wifi)

---
This is exactly how I feel.  Black chins are risky, superior alternative to something that exists, while Dragon Pickaxe is practically a necessity if you plan on doing a decent amount of skilling and Chambers of Xeric, even moreso since the advent of Zalcano and the Crystal Pickaxe.
---
Its a quote from 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell.
---
Then don't add skilling content to the wilderness?
---
the problem with fighting back is that in a number of wildly activities, the amount of inventory spaces you dedicate towards whatever activity you do puts you at such a disadvantage that its not really that great an idea to do so
---
ow well hope some 1 comments soon who knows about  it gl
---
change to a regular garden for your portal and plant a plant next to both your ornate pools, it prevents you from filling on the right side and having to go around it every time.
---
I appreciate being told to 'shut the fuck up' about something. 
---
But sure, I'll remove the word 'spite' from my comment to assuage your worries. 
---
What do you consider "content literally made to make killing PvMers easier?" 
---
&gt;I always vote yes to things like BH updates and QoL things like the looting bag changes when I think they're genuinely good ideas, but you can't just call any no vote a "spite vote" without any evidence to support it.
---
Sure, not all votes they make are spite votes. It's inarguable that some are, though. (Voting down removing a small amount of XP to resolve accidentally ruined Pures.)
---
That’s the point. That’s literally how it’s always been. The excitement of being alone and unafraid, running towards potentially your death without knowing. Back in the day the Wildy was lively all over, and tbf its getting back to that way now too. It’s empty for a reason: you’re supposed to populate it.

Np, thanks :)

[Appeal to tradition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) is a well known logical fallacy. Just because something had been done that way in the past does not make it a good idea, or even the best solution for a given problem.

idk man i voted to buff normals cuz it needed it even tho i thought it coulda used a different buff, so i guess i voted against my own interest?

---
So, what could be polled to swap out the dpick on the drop table and where should it be dropped from (a dwarf based boss, the motherlode or volcanic mine reward shop, etc)?
---
Yeah, those are the weapons. The plan is to have them be tradeable. 
---
What about in the example given in the post whereby they'd only work on PvP worlds or Bounty Hunter worlds (in the wilderness only)? That was skillers would have the option to be totally unaffected if they wish.
---
Great points. What do you mean by crashable at bosses?
---
Not everything should be end game content. Also the quest lines can't just have an extreme jump in difficulty. This is only the third quest in the Fremmy Questline (excluding Lunar Isle stuff). If this goes well and people like it, I'm sure eventually there will be a Grandmaster quest for it, which is what the ones you mentioned are.
---
He showed the drops both in runelite and his bank?

Hate this borderline gatekeeping mentality. Tutorial island sucks. This is just a little hand holding in the beginning of the game, not handing you a set of rune and free base 40s or anything.
---
If the monsters aren't large or weak to melee scythe wouldn't be BiS there. Rapier will most likely be used for minions/small melee weak monsters. Final Boss will most likely be weak to Magic (the new Staff) - Also I believe they have said that the next Raids will be based on defence instead of only DPS and scythe is 2h so you can't even wear a shield with it. Theres 400 scythes being traded daily and there's probably over 3k+ of them in-game, the supply is a lot larger than the demand ATM. 90% of the time Scythe is only used for Raids 2, if people stop doing Raids 2 they will sell Scythe and move to raids 3.
---
Thanks!
---
Instead of trying to lure pvmers to the wildy, give incentive for pvpers or current pvmers to fight each other/back. 
---
If you try to do any pvm in the wildy and you see a pker your only option is literally to run away unless you are decent enough at pvp to fight back. Even then, skull tricking is common enough that most players won’t even try to fight back. Fix skull tricking and people will be more willing to fight back knowing they can have advantage over the pker. Meanwhile, Jagex needs to also add incentive for pvpers to fight each other instead of just pvmers.
---
TLDR: stop lureinf pvmers to wildy and add incentive to fight each other/back.
---
Big fn gratz dude, one question tho, why do I see obby maulers wearing graceful legs/spottier cape? Seen a couple other guys use it on yt
---
Since you say you understand the math, if we use your max number of 35% more damage on a boss rather than the 20% that was assumed in the original post that you shit on, the new cutoff line would be 3.857M rather than 6M to make the scythe profitable. That still makes the original post correct inferring that the scythe is useless almost everywhere. If you're going to tell people they are morons, at least do the math yourself. Prick.
---
Feels like a step towards a battle pass...
---
As long as it stays a 1 time thing, teaches new players the ropes, and doesn't become a battle pass.. cool.
---
I didn't read it all, but I'm hoping the end product has an NPC you go and claim rewards from, not just fish appearing in your inventory. And I really would rather it be a shop mechanic. Like you accomplished this, buy these trouts for like 1gp each. Grats.
---
Naming logical fallacies doesn't make you seem smarter, quite the opposite.
---
On top of that, other PKers risk salad robes and, if lucky, the coveted spade. They have next to **0% incentive** to fight other PKers because PvMers risk more.

False it will be found you will be on the lists of the idiots speaking out there ass
---
Wtf r/Arizona ? you're falling behind
---
Thanks for the info OP. I'll check it out.
---
So I guess you vote no because you don’t want to die in a PvP zone as easy as it is
---
That's not a set number? How is that hard to understand? It depends on the boss. Why is person after person coming in disagreeing with this? 
---
I'm not being a prick, he called me dumb when I was completely right.
---
Well you just proved his point....
---
Dropping at the GE? Or going to tally
---
“Only a few hours a day”... oh hell who am I kidding
---
That’s at least $11 worth of lobsters! Shame!
---
Can you tell me how an emote not passing a poll was in any way shape or form "content which is literally made to make killing PvMers easier."
---
Can I ask the same question about blessed chaps, alternate route for ring imbues, amulet of avarice upgrade, thammrons set, unskulling scrolls and clue scrolls?
---
None of these "made killing PvMers easier", yet none passed.
---
Tell me this isn't the definition of spite voting.
---
I don't think there is no spite voting going on, I think it does hurt but the effect is exaggerated. 
---
I also think that players wouldn't be spite voting if Jagex didn't continually push PvM content into the wilderness.
---
Also to speak specifically to your chaps example, what percent of players who don't pk knew that black chaps have no defense requirement?  Personally, I didn't know that until that poll happened, and I found out because of reddit. Do you think that poll may have been more successful with a different wording that indicated they the requirement was being changed to match black d'hide?
---
I am really glad that the opinions which I have been voicing for years, have gone from being almost unilaterally ridiculed, to now, being almost unilaterally supported by at least the reddit community. Dev team hasn't caught on, but I guess you can't have everything.
---
You're comparing Representative Democracy and Direct Democracy. Two differing branches of the same political policy.
---
I'm still surprised the rapier doesn't have a similar trendline. Most of those facts are true of the rapier as well.
---
Those were crimsons
---
Yeah you're thinking of crimsons
---
I may be out of the loop here since I play UIM but how much are salad robes worth these days? PKers must be risking sooo much in order to be demanding so much.
---
F outta here with that logic
---
You can craft multiple sets of darts in a tick
---
What does she mean she’s not doing a raffle right now after that? By raffle does she mean RuneScape “giveaways” for free aka to gain  followers and subs
---
What is confusing is that you still take fire damage when you have three levels if the anti-dragon shield is not present.
---
How does it feel being mentally disabled?
---
Concealed carry without a permit, they'll expect to rag you but just get specced out.
---
I personally dont. But there's a lot of content that requires going into the wilderness such as clues, slayer, bossing, mage arena, ect. It makes sense that players who don't want to pvp would vote no on polls that make those activities harder for them.
---
It seems like the main groups you need involved are edgeville bh pkers, deep wildy hybrid pkers, and pvp world pkers. To my knowledge, the only one of these that has saved statistics unique to each account is bh, so it should be easy to require a certain number of bh kills, although picking the number might not be so easy.
---
 Personally, I might recommend polling it to everybody but being very clear about how it only affects bh and pvp worlds. It wouldn't cut out pure spite voting, but I don't think there are that many spite voters. Most people (myself included) vote no because a yes vote makes them easier to kill, directly decreasing the value of their time spent playing the game. By limiting it to bh/pvp, I can vote yes with the knowledge that it won't negatively affect me.
---
Couldn't they just add an option that when entering the wilderness it asks if you want to participate in PvP? The only way to re enable PvP would be to exit the wilderness and enter again. As a person who doesn't mind PvP but doesn't really participate in it I don't see how this could hurt any body.
---
Delete the wilderness, and at the same time add several self contained PvP environments with rewards that relate almost entirely to pvp. 
---
Bam, spite voting solved
---
you guys really need to stop crying. the reason that wilderness PvM content is some of the most rewarding is *because* it’s in the wilderness. the reward matches the risk. it’s not like any of the wilderness bosses are difficult on their own. you’re incentivized to engage with this content because the rewards are better than what you would find elsewhere, and the reason that it’s balanced is because you are at an increased risk. it would be fucking stupid if there was just a random altar somewhere in the game that gave you better prayer exp rates than anywhere else, because then everyone would obviously just use that one. same goes for bosses etc. 
---
it’s a game, remember? it’s supposed to be challenging at times
---
tbf if you get skull tricked you're dumb
---
That's why they vote no, you abuse berate those poor puppies
---
Low-mid lvl Ironman could find a lot of use for this, and while I don’t think updates should be centered around Ironman, I think this could be a great update because the Essence mines are a joke and the fact that the best way to get essence is to either do temple trekking or kill twisted banshees could be substituted for actual game lore.
---
One nice thing is that the price of essence is so low now that even if they buff the mines, it still wouldn’t become something bots would look to exploit as long as you can’t bank 50k essence an hour I suppose. But 5k/hr? I’d be down for that.
---
I’m literally talking to a bunch of 13yr old kids on reddit tf would I care you can figur it out
---
There is no video like that out there. This is like the 5th time you are posting about scythe price dropping.
---
You tell me
---
slim 2 none boss
---
Clue scrolls have always come from RNG drops of activities, rather than save-points-and-buy. The only ones you can "buy" are imps which are still initially caught. As far as the effect it'd have on the game, probably not much. Just a random weird inclusion. 
---
I sorta get what you're saying with the unfairness, and after all rune pouch was obtainable from PvP only for a while - but they fixed that since it was dumb for players to either pay a ton of gp or go PvP for a while for something that's universally useful. Since PvP is much less safe than PvE (you can't get your stuff back if you die), players shouldn't be forced into it to get better PvE gear. 
---
For something like a safe minigame, there's definitely less issue there, but still sucks to have to grind a ton of games because you aren't good at PvP and die early, to get something useful in PvE. 
---
Aye I do vote in my best interest, but it's not entirely selfish. If they buff pking to the point you can't get ecu keys without dying, it'll be way more difficult for players to farm Arma/Sara (fuck getting kc there) and those players will have less interest in one of the bigger things keeping them playing. Yes, there is alternative bossing, but why should some sweaty nerds after my dhide and 4 sharks keep me from being able to enjoy things? If I can't do one of the 3 big things I do without a bunch of extra hassle (that wasn't there before), staying subscribed is 1/3 less appealing.
---
*Weatherford and El Paso*
---
jerk off
---
Hmm obvious PvPer if you dont think its that dangerous risking your salad robes.  There are numerous BiS PvM items and 6 bosses locked behind PvP locations.  Even more so the point is that to enjoy the PvM content I have to be willing to be used for enjoyment of another player base (you) instead of you fighting someone who wants to fight you.  That ridiculous and I would bet a majority of PvM'ers would disagree with your entire statement.  I have no problem with people who want to PvP but they shouldn't be enticed to do that against people who don't want to PvP.   PvMers arent enjoying the encounters and if you don't think so, read the comments below where a heavy majority of them are saying the exact same thing my comment is.
---
It’s gonna be a no from me
---
Yes there is
---
So it isn't 1 in 50 people, it's 1 in 5000
---
The problem with your proposal is that wilderness is much smaller compared to the rest of the game, and pvpers as you say, probably comprise like 10-20% of the player base. Focusing that much dev time on PvP-focused content would likely force the game into stagnation with everyone who’d feel neglected by the update schedule and the game would quickly die off. 
---
And while I agree with the sentiment that certain loot and content should be unique to the wilderness, I think we’ve got a fine array of wilderness PvE content as it is. No need to force ironmen and players seeking PvE rewards to the wilderness, anymore than they already are. I mean shit, HCIM won’t even get the god capes as it is because the risk is too great. 
---
Jagex needs to stay with the horse they rode in on! Otherwise they’ll go the path of RS3... and we know what happened to the game back then.
---
support, this is cool
---
It was technically Orion back then
---
They were pretty fair, don't know how they failed the polls though
---
Avoiding slayer
---
Hard no.
---
well you've fucking decimated my 5 year old char
---
pokéscape
---
I'm so frustrated with the amount of griefing PvMers have done with pvp polls over the last years, but even then I'd rather not mess with the polling system and force the updates. Even if pvp is dying out. I'd rather keep the integrity of the polling booth and pk on a private servers. let the pvmers have their win tbh
---
Remember when ely dropped down to 300m.. scythe will be okay
---
Pls
---
you should prob practice pvp if you're getting clapped so often
---
It literally has a higher slash defence than a rune platebody, so don't know where the fuck you get your stats from lol.
---
I just checked the last two Q &amp; A transcripts neither mention the Scythe once, do you know roughly when it was?
---
The moment you take a step into the wilderness you are a pvp player. Just because the wilderness has shit you want doesn't mean you are entitled to it free from pvp.
---
I’m not worried just want to prove the clip exists
---
What were your stats and gear?
---
And I said in the last post that it’s not in the transcripts the transcript are lazy attempt.
---
I just don't like slayer.
---
Maxed combat for bossing.
---
I'm annoyed that new skills keep failing, can we also get a committee comprised entirely of people who want new skills who will totally vote in a nom-biased way to make those decisions?
---
You're implying these updates are to make it easier to kill PvMers. You only hear this on Reddit. Go to edgeville or the wilerness, Pkers tend to fight other Pkers. Fighting and scouting for PvMers and skillers is insanely boring and low profit as they usually don't risk anything
---
Currently sitting at my desk at work at this very moment but ok kiddo. Thankfully I'm valued enough at work that I can fuck around with impunity as long as I get my work done. Get fucked Zoomer.
---
The wilderness is empty enough that pvmers get upset when they get killed in a pvp area.
---
it does when the RSI sets in so you need to stop
---
Haha bet you'd drop me still though mate dont feel too bad
---
Alching is much less "efficient" in terms of xp per hour, fletching will provide much more, but it depends on what you want more.
---
Alching is profitable, fletching isn't. Alching is slow xp, fletching isn't.
---
Sorry if this is dead or if you are exhausted from all the reply OP, but how would you feel about this being tied to a diary update or something? 
---
I know the Ardy diary the guy there can give you free essence each day, which is kinda a joke at the volume you receive. But maybe using that tier system to determine mining rates, or the fused essence rate, or how much essence you can send to the bank. 
---
Thinking of that little creature in the Tree Gnome Village; with diary I those little guys will bank 5k essence per day. Diary II they will do 10k, and so on.
---
It would still require you to go and mine it, and use it like a dialogue or right click to have them send your in-inventory essence to the bank.
---
This info has been on the wiki for like 3 months
---
Well when was it roughly? The last Q&amp;A, the one before?
---
Hmmm... the fact you haven’t even killed a wilderness boss is showing.
---
I’m not sure I know of even one person who can consistently pull off 25+ kills/h, but I can see how looking up an efficiency guide or something Gabe you that number.
---
It’s the grind of constantly being chased off by pkers, unfinished kills that get tagged by raggers, getting shit loot most the time, and of course, the inevitable and occasional deaths. 
---
Bossing in the wilderness is aids unless you’re lucky enough to not come across pkers.
---
why isnt this upvoted more?? up up up
---
I’m glad that I don’t understand this.

You want op money makings without risk/reward factor go fuck yourself, pvmers became the vegans of this game, no one is forcing you into the wildernes don't like it drop the clue, go do vorkath/zultah instead of wildy bosses you cock sucking goblin bois.....
---
It could of been like up 10 ago def wasn’t the last 3
---
Isn't this REALLY OLD news?
---
I doubt I'll get an answer to this, but is there any changes towards incentivizing multi pvp or just helping the state of multi pking besides revs at all?
---
Right 🤣🤣🤣
---
&gt; PVPers claim game will die without them. Vast majority of the community continues to vote no on PVP buffs.
---
&gt; 🤔
---
Yes, PvP content is one of the biggest advertising factors working for OSRS, and a huge draw for lots of new players, a large supply sink, etc. 
---
Without it, the game will 100% decline significantly. It's possible it will still limp forward with a smaller, and ever-declining playerbase. 
---
Look at RS3, for example. They still exist, though only because of mass-microtransactions. 
---
&gt; Vast majority of the community continues to vote no on PVP buffs.
---
The vast majority of the community probably doesn't think beyond immediate benefits or negatives. 
---
Will this update make the game easier for me in a way I like? 
---
Will this update make the game harder for me in a way I don't like?
---
Etc.
---
So uhhh.... crayfish?
---
Neat, I've been wondering if this is doable on mobile
---
That many tasks and no elite? Rip. Also gz

Or at least 'your cat runs away in fear and returns to yoir backpack' or returns later/ escapes to your poh
---
Losing cat is frustrating.
---
Can you bring back the dueling anywhere option? 
---
Could even have wagers instead of full loss
---
make sure you also 2fa your email as only having it on your osrs isnt secure since it can be removed
---
It isn’t like those things even passed a poll.
---
How many keys?
---
What is haveibeenpwned?
---
I would do fletching. Magic will get 99 passively through slayer doing burst/barrage tasks.
---
Yeah, I don't get it. The Wilderness is one of the most iconic parts of Runescape. Removing Wilderness PvP was one of the changes that nearly killed the game, so it's crazy to see it getting so much hate now. There are tons of PvM bosses outside of the Wilderness for people who hate the Wilderness that much, so it's not like they're even forced to go in there. Plus, Revenants would just be another boring semi-AFK money making method if it weren't for the constant threat of PKing.
---
To be fair I don't think a top skilling item of any kind should be restricted to wild.
---
Look, increased gpm for wilderness activities is fine. Even combat rewards from wilderness are fine, because that's precisely what wilderness is all about, combat and fighting.
---
But skillers are literally the only account type you wouldn't expect to be in the wildy, aside from doing clues.
---
I don't think putting the best skilling item/s in wildy is a good idea, at least not as long as it's the only way to acquire them.
---
That being said, some skilling areas are of course fine and even encouraged, but you probably wouldn't expect much to be found in an area as barren as the Wilderness.
---
Gotta being a DWH or BGS to lower it's defenses
---
This has been legal in Tennessee for awhile.
---
I think you're making unfair assessments on the minds of other people and trying to pass it as facts when in reality, it's just your opinion.
---
Strange, I got mine all in the same drop, which you can see in the screenshot. The [wiki page on Kudos](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Kudos#Rewards) has info on the experience you get, but Hunter should be in the same batch as the other skills in the 151+ category.
---
Do you think people stay high during the day if you smoke in the evenings? Are you dumb?
---
Big F
---
Suddenly smokin on gas instead of the cantaloupe
---
I mean, maybe I'm jaded, but this isn't a crazy situation... it's mundane. You have 40 kc, and you have 9 drops with a 1/128 chance. There's nothing special about those 9 drops, other than that they're not a B ring.
---
If we assume 1/21 chance of receiving a B ring if we know we've already hit the 1/128 drop rate,
---
(20/21)\^9 = 64% chance.
---
You're statistically likely than not to have received this many non-B ring drops than to have received one B ring drop, or in other words, completely within expectations and not crazy at all.
---
Do you even need one small favour for the gloves
---
Meh abusing a main acc has very few niche uses. The game modes pretty secure.
---
I would love for craw’s bow or chainmace to work in PvP worlds on normal monsters. Would be awesome for some slayer tasks.
---
Lol technically being able to fight back and practically being able to fight back are 100% different things. Any pvmer in the wilderness will lose 99% of the fights they engage in because they have less inventory space. You're just never going to win a fight against someone who has 9+ inventory spaces on you because you're carrying pvm gear.
---
have you tried to get evidence? you are the only people able to do so. spite voting is definitely a thing.
---
Rag and Bone Man II is probably the worst thing ever created.
---
I never really though about it, but this IS a large part of why RC sucks so much. Something like agility has similarly low XP rates, but its so much more simple to train.
---
So that's what he looks like without his neitiznot
---
Dont use them if you dont like it
---
Yesss this is 100% true! Jagex should be looking into WHY Pvmers hate PvP so much.
---
Spoiler alert: it's because PKers have huge advantages over Pvmers
---
You can do alchgility and then it doesn't matter because the alching is 0 time
---
Absolutely! All 216 kills I have have been on mobile. Do it a couple times and have your quick prayers selected and get use to clicking the spawn and it'll be gravy after that.
---
If your email has 2fa, they can't access the email to recover it though.
---
I mean yes it was just my first trip and i was just expecting bones and mithril ore lol. Just wanted to share my first bossing experience
---
Imagine reading this then going look at the page and reading what happened knowing I’m not going to do so but reply anyway for no reason.
---
Yeah I checked out the wiki page, probably just some runelite weirdness that mine was separate. If anything, I'd almost expect each tier to have its own xp drop but that didn't happen.
---
Exactly. I enjoy PvP. I hate PvM. So when I do a quest, let's say for example monkey madness on a pure because the dragon scimitar will make me stronger in PvP, I don't have to do it. I CHOOSE to go through that boring grind of skills/questing to better my account for PvP. PvMers CHOOSE to enter the wilderness to get maybe a magic cape to provide them with better magic bonus. Neither of us are forced to do that, we could still play the game and just make do with the second best option, but we don't. Yet PvM players will throw a fit about being forced into entering a PvP environment to participate in a piece of content. I don't see PvP players crying about having to to grind skills/quests for hours on end to unlock rewards that Jagex have decided to lock behind content they hate. Nobody is forced into any of it, you just do it to put you on a level playing field in the aspect of the game you play for whether that be PvP or PvM. So what I'm saying is PvM players should suck up coming into our environment for beneficial rewards the same way we have to go into their environment to reap the rewards from the content they enjoy.
---
I'm fine with PvP updates being left up to the decision of PvP players as long as that content only affects them.  The problem is that Jagex is obsessed with driving non-PvP players into PvP zones.  
---
If a PvP update affects me, I should get a vote on whether or not it's implemented, whether I'm a "PvP player" or not.
---
You can fill pouches from the bank interface by rightclicking them if you have ess in your inventory.
---
What they can do tbh is enable shift clicking so the pouch fills up instead of having to rightclick that way you don't waste half a hour filling them and its faster then rightclicking.
---
Ok, call it a day.
---
That’s a lot of effort for ~500 karma lol
---
RIP :( we should have a halloween party there just to show off our fashionscape
---
&gt; You are incredibly dishonest in your arguments.
---
No, you're just strawmanning tme hard, I never mentioned any specific update lol.
---
I'm talking about the constant slippery slope pvpers are trying to push the normal spellbook down down. When people vote no they aren't doing it out of spite, they just aren't retarded enough to let it start rolling.
---
Also, funny you are making dps arguments and ignoring the ridiculous amount of extra damage you need to tank to escape through 30 wildy levels. Teleblock is absolutely strong enough to justify normal spellbook dps.
---
It's all about what you bot, what account you bot on, the quality of the script, and how long you bot. A fresh level 3 cutting oaks for 37 hours straight is going to get a ban. A high level account botting different skills or minigames for a few hours at a time likely wont get banned. 
---
Source: I botted extensively on RS2 for years without ban. Botted osrs for a few months without ban. All accounts are still going strong.
---
I have no problem with pvp being in the game but why would I vote against my best interest ever?
---
better off buying max account so you jump straight to end game
---
what?
---
99% of updates to pvp have been polled. It is the pvmers/skillers voting shit in. most of the stuff that doesnt affect pvm in some way fail. Shit like revs and wildy bosses passes because people want new npcs to kill. shit like tb in f2p fails because people don't want actual pvp updates. 
---
DMM updates are influenced by vocal majority, game updates aren't. IF they were, ely and dinhs would be out of the wild, people would autoskull/have risk, ragging would be gone, unskulling woulda been gone forever ago, world hop timer would have never been implemented, etc etc.
---
I think this is the exact opposite. Non-pvpers would be upset, because they don't want to be killed while trying to kill revs/gain xp. PVPers and non-PVPers should be separated from each other as possible. I think that any weapons or other gear that makes killing other players easier should only be usable in PVP/Bounty hunter worlds, so that non-PVPers won't feel the need to vote against it to protect their own interests. 
---
I would even be open to PVP being restricted to only PVP and BH worlds. That should end the spite between PVPers and PVMers once and for all...
---
This obviously would necessitate nerfing most wilderness content, but so be it.
---
this is my experience when i scape drunk
---
You don't have to exit the bank window to fill your pouches. Just right click when bank is open. You can also shift click the pouches to empty them instead of right clicking. Also without pouches your xp is decreasing by 30+% which would make the skill even worse...
---
The poor frozen black chinchompa! D:
---
Makes sense....thanks
---
I guess? D claws with a Ghrazi Rapier switch using the house method is pretty fast by itself.
---
Thank you for the projection on your part. It provides me with happiness when I play it. If it doesn't for you, fair enough, but don't put it on other players.
---
will there be snacks?
---
Ok my bad, so basically the shield + super anti has a ''combo effect'' that negates vorkaths dragonfire breath all together. 
---
Where as the super extended antifire gets halved if used with mage protection.

Makes sense.  I mean, who else would have so much exp that their tears contain it?

Good advice, I have huge lists of peoples logins and it's pretty shocking how many passwords are correct, if they didn't have 2fa no doubt people would have cleaned their accounts by now.
---
Rapier droped in price due to blade of saeldor hype, scythe is droping in price due to supply and demand, there are to many scythes ingame for the number of people willing to buy them.

I pay like $9.50 (on average per month) or whatever cause I buy the full year of membership lol

I love it when people call out unrealisms in a fantasy dragon killing game 😆
---
Imagine if the inventory space was increased to like 100 lol
---
h
---
This sounds like a desperate attempt by someone who bought in when they shouldnt have to try and recoup their investment.
---
Not sure if it was correct but when I went to do chinning I believe I went with a bit more of a range bonus with slight prayer bonus but that was because I was in MM2 caves where they drop prayer potion (1) drops so frequently.    If I was you I would probably go for a range boost and make the most out of your chins with the max hits they can do.

First time in my life that I hear someone claim that splitting the community once and for all is a "good" idea.

What the fuck.
---
Can someone explain what the harm is if a pvp update effects all players. Shouldn't the wilderness be end game content anyway? Full loot on death and actually risky content is what made runescape
---
&gt; This is all content that exists to encourage PvM players to be victims for the sake of the PvP experience, and it's not like that's an accident, that was your explicit intention when you made it
---
But it isnt either or, we're all players. wether you're a skiller, a pure, a main or whatever, its one game.

No. Plain and simple.

this is really good! do you happen to have a tab/sheet music for this?
---
Literally any big community with no moderation ends up the same.
---
No. You don't need regicide either.
---
why pray at nmz?
---
Is the current situation of making one part of the community be the prey of another part any better? We can all see the effects this has caused on the community.
---
lol try again

This is good stuff

And what about people like me? My main account is "UMD", my 60 attack 1 def pure is "Big Blue Hat"

I enjoy PvP and PvM

Please tell me how I vote

I just recently finished grinding for a dwh at shamans. Haven't done zulrah yet so was using a rcb and broads. To save prayer pots I was killing them at molch and just running upstairs to pray at the altar whenever I ran out (which also allowed me to do the entire Slayer task in one trip). 
---
I noticed that the rcb had a pretty high accuracy, and when I experimented with using a stole and God book instead of glory and dhide shield, there wasnt a noticable drop in accuracy, but it did extend my time before I had to go restore prayer by a good 25%. So that's what I did.
---
Beaides that one super niche use... they could also be used any time you are using prayer but not in combat. So think winterdodt, zalcano etc where you might want the 2x HP regen prayer on.
---
Why not just accept you have to go into the wilderness to get a ring/cape/pet/clue reward the same way we pvp players have to go grind shitty boring skills and quests to unlock a spell/item? It's not like the game is unplayable if you don't do the wilderness content.
---
Dude just go do any money making activity and in a few hours you can buy all the uniques from the wild and dont have to go in there at all lol
---
You found a whale in DH.. Pretty hard to do these days.  Free gp doe
---
Yeah I max out at Adamant Gloves, which are weaker than Regen Bracelet by +1 stab/slash/crush attack. Granite gloves are only strictly superior (offensively) to those two sets of gloves/bracelets for crush attack too; the other gloves are more accurate when it comes to using stab/slash. But when your main weapons are slayer staff and maul, this isn't too much of an issue
---
But that's what the wilderness is
---
What about recoil damage?
---
Caught myself confusingly looking at the well-cooked lobs for way longer than I would dare to admit
---
you don't take max gear as a pvmer or skiller into the wilderness, no, but the liquidity constraint of losing your entire bank is the closest equivalent I can think of to wilderness "politics" - it's possible for someone to try a boss or chinchompas or revenants five thousand times but be killed every single one of them. both of these extremely negative tail outcomes make people stay away from their respective activities more than the actual likelihood of failure should make them stay away.
---
in real life, people buy insurance for all sorts of things. when was the last time you heard of someone buying insurance for anything (besides pets, which aren't really the same thing) in RuneScape, rather than simply eating any losses that occur?
---
also, if doing the content takes five times longer in rags compared to max (good gear isn't that much better than bad gear) that still means you can farm it consistently in rags
---
Losable
---
Which has caused the current situation of Non-pvpers spite voting on pvp polls, and which I also proposed to preserve in the form of a limited amount of worlds for those who like it.

It’s 1/172 drop rate so it’s not really that rare, i believe it will settle around 300-400m
---
Phials*
---
no it's not, never said that it is.
---
Locking content to wildy only is stupid, I can agree with wanting to save time and get some more xp/hr for less gp/hr in the wildy like the altar is totally fine since no one is fucking forcing pvmers to use that content.
---
Same with clues, got a master step in wildy? Go do it, don't want to fine don't do it and drop the clue no one forces you.
---
Wines being noted in the wildy is part of the entire risk reward system. You risk being killed you are rewarded with not having to bank every 5 seconds.
---
Same with wildy slayer, want the best points in the game go do wildy slayer don't want well then don't do it simple.
---
having exclusive bosses in the wildy is a retarded idea and concept
---
fuck
---
C
---
Well first of all your point is immediately proven wrong by the fact that ironmen exist. Also I'll copy &amp; paste from my other comment:. 
---
Well the thread is for pvp polls posted by Jagex. And my point was that pvm players are drawn to the wilderness for no other reason than to be prey for pvp players. I agree that pvm content in the wilderness should be better for the risk it causes but this shouldn't be the only content Jagex adds to the wilderness because it promotes spite voting and toxicity from pvmers towards pvpers because Jagex's hands are tied where people want content for wildy/pvp but pvmers won't let it pass a poll. That's the whole point of this blog post if you read it.

People should not vote on issues they do not understand. I am fully behind people only being allowed to vote on topics they subscribe to.
---
I can't see any way that you could categorise people correctly.
---
* Play time spent in PvP areas - You don't need to be a PvPer to utilise PvP areas, and as shown by the current state of things, people that use those areas don't understand them. Not a good metric of understanding of issues.
---
* Number of players killed over a time period - Just because you're a PvPer doesn't mean you've killed anyone recently, some people might have perfect understanding of the issues and partake in PvP from time to time but spend the majority of their time raiding etc. Or they might just be bad. Idk. Not a good metric.
---
* Ask players to select which category they belong to - Would need a delay between switching as people would just switch then downvote to spite the issues they have beef with. Also, pretty much everything item and buff related has PvP impacts, hell even mithril seeds have PvP implications - who would have foreseen that? The only realistic categories you could have are 'PvM/Skilling only' and 'Everything'. People would just select everything because they don't miss out on voting for issues they are actually qualified to vote on but can still spite the PvPers...
---
PvP council? Hell no. Jagex might have a terrible grasp of the issues but players always vote in their own interest without exception. Price manipulation and clan favouritism inbound. 
---
Learn your game, study the issues and contemplate the consequences of your proposed changes. By all means consult the playerbase as a whole for feedback (and actually listen), but not select individuals - that is a path to ruin. Then enact your changes with integrity. Your job is to provide a balanced PvP environment, not allow the users of that environment to shape it to their benefit.

Yes he deserved to die, and I hope he burns in hell.

Jesus, you can actually make that much an hour consistently? Is it one big drop that averages out or like a 60m/hr vorkath?

The indian one?

Personally I like DWH better than BGS at Vork, so I would do it.
---
Whoever still uses Facebook deserves to be scammed.
---
I’ll tell my grandpa to watch out?
---
Is that Bacon on his left arm and crotch 🥓
---
Ur so misguided. A +18 boost to range accuracy is not what is make or breaking pures. Its the mage def that lets them at least compete with zerks past 80 cmb in tribridding. 
---
Mains are already better than pures of the same cmb. Its just pures do more damage. The reasons pures dominate is because u dont have to deathmatch so its all KOing, pures have more experience/combat level since they level slower, and pures min/max. Until ur acc can outhit food, u cant pk solo. If i fought my friend on level 60/60/60 accounts, we would never ever ko each other. A 60/60/60 probably hasnt even played the game for two months while a level 70cmb pure the same level is probably on that pure for 5months of straight pking along with experience from a main. Also these 60/60/60 can get level 80 range and mage but most of them only have like 40-50. It has nothing to do with d hide chaps. I mean its still better, but Look back at 2005-07 pk vids, most people just msb with full ghostly set no switch and still win. 
---
Meanwhile once mains can start hitting high or using good freeze spells, the d hide is the only thing keeping pures from getting destroyed, they have at least some defence. Then ofc it helps vs the higher levels which have the same offense stats but like 70 def.
---
DWH at vork is trash keep the bgs til you can afford dwh + dhcb.
---
Upvoted cause you are right
---
Check out LSoG, there's some guys in there who like to do PvM. Mostly higher leveled but they'll take people along for stuff.
---
I always found this the best option because rooftops are in that shitty in between place where you can't properly AFK like for WC or Fishing; You also aren't as active as something like FM or Mining.  
---
I have to sit there to click every couple of seconds but the rest of the time I'm just trying not to fall asleep. alching and fletching keeps me active so I'm not falling asleep waiting for my character to reach the next obstacle and i'm not wasting time and potentially losing marks of grace by afking like i was fishing.
---
Odds are like 1 in 1.2M or something?
---
How many people do you think really "spite vote"? Most of the "no" votes are from people thinking, "hell no I don't want to make it easier for them to kill me".
---
Shut her down around lunch time made 7.5m and got a few levels up. Not bad for a hard day of doing nothing
---
I have always hated the idea of "PVP" or "PVM" only content. I would 100% even though I'm a PKer vote no to the PKer only voting because of that, if it wasn't like that I would vote yes. I understand in that context it's not fair for other players so I understand why that cant be, which is why I suggest you guys go further with the PVP Council instead of restricting the vote.
---
Trident and Blowpipe having "Non-PVP" functions annoys me. Blowpipe should be nerfed outside of PVP, Trident is fine as it should uncharge and break (requiring repair) upon death so it cant be used as a ragging weapon like the Polypore was and it'd be fine. Justiciar is the only one that I'm fine with as we don't need players to be more tanky right now however I also feel it's not right that you cant use it in PVP. I also hated the idea of not being able to use ancient warrior equipment in PVM. If you are wondering why I don't dislike for example the Flail from Revenant caves is because it makes sense it wouldn't work on a player as it's intended for Wilderness NPCs just like the DHCB shouldn't work on players as we are not dragons; they are bane items but the Trident isn't.
---
On the low side even for entry level for my field.
---
With comments like these I have to assume a lot of OSRS players are in middle school or homeless 
---
why waste gp in bonds unless you are max combat and can make 3– 4 mil an hour.
---
RS3 was released in 2013 right, so maybe it wasn't filled but it did always have MTX.
---
I am one of these people. +22 levels.
---
I’m shaking
---
Yeah everyone knows it’s piss
---
Dragon pickaxe, best in slot rings, pets, revenant weapons, black chinchompas best gp/xp prayer training, best xp/hr Hunter training if you don't do birdhouses.
---
Wasn't the limit on not being able to lamp down past a certain level but no limit on lamps? I don't remember what the proposal was entirely but if I'm wrong then, well, my bad.
---
That is essentially the problem though.  They're not voting on the content, they're voting to not make the game harder for themselves.  It's kinda silly, the point of voting is to make the game BETTER, not EASIER
---
What's your plan for tackling cb? having 1att/99str or 99att/1str seems hilarious either way.
---
Literally all the wildy bosses are like this and it's dumb. There really is no good way to kill them without safespotting
---
Quiz game show in which the man pictured answers multiple choice questions to catch up to contestants answering the same questions to get to the bank to deposit their prize; if the guy catches up to a contestant, they don't earn any money, but teammates that succeeded may be able to earn money for the team prize pool
---
First thing a pedophile says...
---
&gt;And Jagex was stupid enough to think the playerbase would accept this.
---
Not really stupid when it was the most popular content for all the early years of RS2.
---
As for d pick, I don't see why they don't just add it to some other boss's drop table at a much rarer rate than the wilderness methods. Then it fits perfectly into the wilderness model of "better, but riskier".
---
Jagex trying new MTX bag space for inventories
---
I don't understand the comments in these sections. PvP has always been apart of RuneScape. "Cat and mouse tactics"? Does no one know what RISK VS REWARD is? Why do you want to have no risk in getting anything? That makes the game boring af. This isn't Zelda. This is quasi-isometric Dark Souls. Dark Souls isn't Dark Souls without invasions. RunEscape isn't RuneScape without luring, PKing, and clans hopping worlds for free meat.   
---
"Battles are just the bloody after-thoughts to the moves you've already made." Just because you didn't think hard enough about what you wanted and wanted to do, is no one's fault but your own.

Yeah so is drake but nobody cares and people still fuck with him.

Idk what those 100+ guys problem is, I had that shit at 64cb and 22 prayer.

No, Lobster (s)

Oh yeah, then I can finally solo bandos with an inventory full of swordfishies. Good idea!

Happened to my 1930 Total ironman. Rip status and bank because I was STUPID. (Happened during a few week break moving states) Rip Buq

Started new ironman n luckily they didnt get to change my name which was weird cuz 3 chars so atleast my new iron will be the same just starting over lool.

Gl on le rebuild add my exIron main if ya want name is SAKE BOTTLE and ironman is Buq

I busted out laughing. Good shit man

You can go at 57 and boost it

trade me ur bond at GE i double them

buy a bond

Hell no

requirement to vote on pvp poll: 1k kills in wildy or pvp worlds
---
+1 for guy wearing salad robes, solid meme
---
I knew I was gonna do this so I just bought membership lol. I’d rather play the game how I want than feel obligated to get money for a bond every 14 days.
---
The problem is holding rewards 'hostage' in polls through a lack of options. 
---
Most players would rather have voted for the new content (wildy slayer, bosses, etc) to exist outside of the wilderness but players weren't given the option. 
---
It's usually a "we'll give it to you in the wilderness, or not at all" option. Players like new bossing content, so they'll vote for it even if it isn't their preferred method of implementation (the wilderness).
---
And most players would be fine with reduced gp/h, xp/h, or efficiency if that content was located outside the wilderness. Players rarely vote for BiS rewards to be added with no requirements/catch.
---
Gear and buyables are intended to be grinded for, membership was intended to be paid for.
---
Progressing in a game via irl job isn't much fun imo.
---
Sadly that doesnt apply to a lot of people. Theres also display name glitches that show your original rsn every now and then.
---
Screw the Pack Yak, just buy keys :)
---
but the rates are .61 per mil bonds are too expensive
---
This community will love it as it makes things more "Efficient". When you really look at the updates/changes people ask for they just want things to be less click intensive, remove the tedious/grindy tasks, make the game more afk and to remove risk/reward. Basically EZscape. Games going downhill.
---
[deleted]
---
I had it as a pop up it seems to apear to some and some not ffs...
---
**You** consider it time wasted and as a result bad content, others like me consider it a fun interruption to an otherwise boring grind. Black chin hunting is one of my favorite types of skilling, precisely because I enjoy the times pkers attack me and I get chances for more loot. And nobody is "complaining that everyone hates the wild", the complaint is that **because** babied 2019 pvmers now hate the wilderness, they are voting no to all pvp-related polls and it's fucking us over. If all the "pker bad" slayerscape kids were to keep their fragile hearts away from the wilderness because they understood its not for them, then we wouldn't be having this problem. And this problem is an entitlement problem, the nonexistence of death mechanics has made non-pkers feel entitled to easy, risk-free, uninterrupted grinding even in the one place in the game that is the antithesis to that style of gameplay.
---
I was more meaning what do people think of the companies ethics trying to reassure their method of botting is safe. Was once a highly regarded company/client and now using shady tactics to bring back users.
---
Some people won't think much of it and just assume osb is legit so everything in their client is as well, use it, then eventually get hit with a ban unknowingly.
---
You neglect to realize that most of these activities are in multicombat areas. Escaping one idiot in mystic robes is usually pretty easy, but what about two of them? Three? Five? It's not about who has the best stats, gear, or mechanical skill when you're vastly outnumbered.
---
FUCKING TREYWAY
---
Really? I didn't know that banning knives causes more knife attacks in Europe. I know those bans happens (thanks to Skallagrim) and I find them ridiculous - they aren't against the root cause which is the saying: people kills people.
---
But out of context, should America make firearms legally to carry too if it worked on knives? It *could* work, but hey, I'm not a politic, and I already know that America has a lot to improve with their firearm laws and usage.
---
That only happens if you bought your account or gave out some specific personal info.
---
Before playing runescape I played a game called conqueronline. The way they incorporated PVP was incredible.
---
Basically you can pk people anywhere similar to pk worlds but they will only lose supplies in inventory like runes, arrows, food and recent loots are not protected for 10-20 min. You do not lose gear currently wearing.
---
If you attack someone (pk mode)your name flashes blue the other person sets (retaliation mode on) and can kill you without gaining points. Every time a blue flashing player kills someone it adds 10 points to your name, at 20 points your name turns red, and if someone pks you while your name is red there is like a 1/3 you lose your highest value item, 1/2 for 2nd. At 100 points your name turns black and there is 100% chance of losing highest and 2nd highest item when you die (no protection prayers) Points drop by 1 every 5 minutes or you can buy an item that clears 20 points with spending honour points (points you get from mini game similar to lms)
---
Some bosses when killed would add 2 points to name per kill, this prevents people from camping bosses constantly while still willing to risk.  
---
I think this would be great for wild so pvmers can bring higher level items to wild rather than black dhide. And would never worry about being skull tricked
---
Yo fuck you
---
Did that afking at bandits a few years ago. Learned my lesson that's for sure lol
---
Is there any video from there?
---
Unpopular opinion: I dont think balancing changes to PVP content should have to be polled. The Dhins Bulwark is a perfect example. Why would any PVMer vote to reduce their chances of survival in the wild? They wont. In every other game the meta for pvp is determined by the players while the devs try to balance. In our case, the meta is determined by the same people who decide what balancing changes are allowed. Nerfs and buffs are an integral part of PVP, but the current voting system counters the devs ability to think critically about what is NEEDED vs what is WANTED. Personally I think the devs should work with a community of players who are known to PVP and consult them on PVP only updates. Then either make the changes if they deem them ultimately necessary or allow for a PVP only vote.
---
what? there are 8 trees there. hop worlds until you find a good one... i've been afking at wc guild for months and never had an issue
---
**LITERALLY PLAYABLE**
---
They are absolutely pushing the envelope too much. OSB is the only reason 3rd party clients exist for OSRS and they continue to add features that abuse their knowledge of Jagex bot detection. It is absolutely immoral of them to ruin the game by using their insider knowledge of what is bannable to push their own product.
---
I'm not advocating for people to maintain bonds at low levels. OP lost a bank of 500M, I'm assuming he has high stats. It's not totally crazy to grind for 1 bond in F2p and then maintain it while a member. Varok elite and doing 2 crystal trees each day is enough to cover bonds 3 times over.
---
Lol you could fix the problem by removing pvm from the wilderness where it doesn't belong. But sure. Let's just let the wildy die instead and watch these two communities continue to hate each other. That definitely sounds like the better option!
---
Runelite doesn’t have these plugins.
---
oh, derp yeah you're right. but still taking off the 2475 from 1.8m or the 805k is a lot of grind
---
btw i'm in your boat too and it is no fun. gl on your pet my dude
---
This just in 6ix9ine reveals neive is member of Phoenix gang
---
its such a fucking shame that jagex will just blindly ingore this obviously insane problem
---
I *am* the council!
---
I highly doubt this will be hard for bot detection as they are instantly sending packets to "use" an item. I do agree with you though for sure. I'm waiting for the ban reports to roll in now.
---
99% of players are not OP and don't have 90 herblore
---
yup. Its the biggest issue this game has. No1 can care about a game that is so devoid of any value.
---
Aye just got 77 runecrafting yesterday. Still have to grind some rep tho before I can finally mine that sweet soft serve.
---
strawmanning? what.
---
How did you come to that conclusion? The government coming in and limiting corporations' ability to manipulate people at the extremes does not remove a person's incentive to better themselves.
---
The incentive to strengthening your willpower is that your life becomes better. That will always be the incentive and the end goal, improving your own life. The government coming in and stopping a corporation from going too far is a way in which the government tries to help you attain that goal, it doesn't remove the incentive of bettering your life.
---
When an addict tries to shake off their addiction, the best way to get them to stop is to heavily regulate their exposure to their problem substance, often avoiding them entirely. In most cases, former addicts have support groups or friends or family members that try to help them stay away. If you take a drug addict out of rehab and put them back in with where all their old drug dealers are then it doesn't matter how much progress they made in rehab, you can bet your ass they will most likely relapse.
---
The government stepping in to limit spending on RS3's TH keys is a similar scenario. They're not removing the incentive to strengthen your willpower, they're trying to help people going through the problem by limiting Jagex's ability to sell to these people.
---
This isn't a fantasy story where you're a hero that resists a sea of temptation to reach the end goal, this is real life where we aren't legendary heroes. We're just normal people with normal flaws and normal ambitions. The best way for us to deal with our personal demons is for someone else to pick us up because we are social creatures, and sometimes it has to be the government.
---
I'm telling mom &gt;:(
---
OSBuddy going back to its roots as a bot client
---
Wait so if I setup a cannon in Wild and get PKd, what will happen
---
Fair enough
---
This is just a step further from left click "use" bone, which was added in 2016. The justification behind this is that it doesn't automate requests to the server, it only removes the client interactions required to send the request. Anything that involves multiple inputs in menus per server request can be turned into a single input to simply send the server request, and they all fall under this umbrella.
---
This was my stream, not an actual fishing stream. Just did it as a joke
---
I'd imagine they are just desperate at this point - have to do something to try to retain/regain player base
---
Did he snitch in jail? Top tier shit right here btw

Literally the first video I clicked:

---
I'm going to stop wasting my time with you. Because I'm now 100% certain you're actually just trolling. It's as if you didn't even read the last paragraph I wrote in my post. 
---
People like you comment on every quality of life suggestion. They say things like, "*You specifically* are only suggesting this because *you're* lazy." Well I don't PK.     
---
     
---
Right clicking 20 items on the ground as opposed to just quickly-left clicking is inefficient. All quality of life suggestions are designed specifically to make gameplay more intuitive.  
---
You should be have the ability to easily pick up the loot you earn without accidentally attacking NPC's and players.   
---
Can I right click? Yes. Do I right click? Yes. Is this update necessary? No. It's just nice. I said that in my post. 
---
Quality of life updates are not needed. They're "Just nice" 
---
That's literally the whole point of them. They improve the *quality* *of* your *life*.
---
AMAZING
---
Runelite topples everything imo. Osbuddy is just a lite version of runelite that u also have to pay for
---
Honestly, I don't get it either. I've questioned a few mid level accounts that were stuck in the perpetual rat race of bond cycles and barely had enough money to keep themselves afloat. Their responses to my multi-paragraph inquisitions were one line, and more or less boiled down to they had never given it any thought and just did it presumably because they thought that was the norm.
---
Even though you and I can see the logic of buying bonds only when you can do high level money makers, these people aren't thinking at that level. They'd rather do something that they've seen endorsed by friends or by the community, much in the same way people buy into shitty products because of dodgy reviews and testimonials, or because their friends proclaim legitimacy. It's common for people to prefer to just go with the crowd and not question things, and there are plenty of businesses built upon exploiting this facet of human nature. 
---
If you're really interested in getting to the bottom of this, I'm sure you would learn a lot from talking to a person versed in human behavioural psychology or marketing. Would probably be more fruitful than Reddit.
---
Problem is it's either ban all clients or none.  This is undetectable.  I've personally used the construction 1 click to get into the high 90s.
---
Don't really see how it's more valuable to click a little bit more. It's still just as braindead. Stuff like inferno is a bit different, but this is just an action anyone can do.
---
&gt; we 
---
Oh, has the council already been founded with you as it's leader? Or do you just assume that you speak for every single PvMer? Cos you don't. Death is already meaningless enough in this game, wilderness content is some of the most fun in my opinion and I don't even PK. Plus, the game originally started with the entire world being pvp, and even in early runescape the only way to get rune/green dhide etc was to go into the wilderness. It's not new, it's not all bad, and your opinion doesn't count for every single player of a certain type.
---
lmao facts
---
Top tier bait
---
people have that thought all because some of the devs USED to work with jagex. They started as a bot client, went legit and got sponsored/affiliated with jagex, went downhill and slowly lost members, now going back to their roots.
---
big brain time
---
they can do whatever they want lmao i aint stoppin anyone
---
Piety eats your prayer as a light snack even if you have prostelyte. Plus, defense bonuses are a thing.
---
I don't think anyone was wondering if a +6 strength bonus could somehow out DPS a 20% attack and 23% strength bonus.
---
yeah its just super boring. talk to the same 4 people 4 times but with a very slight variation every time. boring design, boring quest
---
One of the reasons why I stopped PKing and started playing UIM. Let's not forget that it's these clans that are also responsible for the death mechanic (and huge inflation) because of their DDOS attacks.
---
The other turn off to PvP is when the content update is actually a PvM update in wilderness designed to attract people who absolutely don't want PvP into the wilderness to be prey to the salad robe PKers.
---
Bonds, girls streamer, etc. Money doesn't mean you know anything. Some skillers have bils, but  have never even touched a raid.
---
I think you're allowed to stop doing kraken now
---
it's essentially doing the exact same thing the bones is doing. so how is one pushing it, but one is fine?

The left click option on logs is automatically using them on the tinderbox, just as the left click on altar is automatically using them on the altar.
---
Honestly same. Only thing is I wish hovering items In regular client showed ge price and bank value.

On some real shit, my ex, who I've been working on getting back with since we only broke up over one of my fuck-ups just fucked her ex who's this millionaire Venezuelan (inherited wealth) and it's like damn. How the fuck was I ever going to compare in the first place? For some reason she's still really into me and gets jealous when I post pics with other girls and hits me up about it. But fuck man, not sure where to go from here.

lmao i have quest cape on my main and mith gloves on 2 pures

Rs3 is a continuum from rs2. Rs3 really changed very little; they just wanted to name it rs3 for advertising purposes.
---
It's a constant evolution and it technically "came out" in 2004
---
1 click to select the bone *and* offer it, a painfully obvious breach of the "one input has to equate with one output" rule. 
---
Jagex can't let this one slide.
---
Jagex (used to? possibly stopped) reviews every OSBuddy update and tells them to remove features if they aren't okay with them. If they're still doing that, then they won't try to detect it, because it's not against the rules.
---
never used it as a negative adjective, just a descriptor. is "roleplaying" negative as well? as if it were an fps it would be justified
---
Jagex calls it a macroing major ban for a reason, it doesnt matter if your botting/macroing/using AHKs. It all falls under the same banner to Jagex.

This sub has some of the best content. We're all like 25+ playing a 15 year old browser-based mmo so what else would you expect? Lmao

Wouldn't even bother with that useless cunt.

It's not like he's complaining because he actually skulltricks and may lose some GP, he's genuinely unhappy enough in his own life that making someone else's easier has triggered him this hard.

I assume most people make minimum to a few dollars over minimum /hour. On top of that people don't get as many hours as they want in their job. But I completely agree, it's faster to make $11 than in game currency.

They did add alternatives to the wildy though. May I ask, what did you find bad about 2008 BH and PvP worlds? Was it the fact that you couldn't loot what the person dropped?
---
If there is going to be a council pick a variety of different people and don’t have that many streamers or YouTubers. People who have high bh kills, maxed pures, maxed piety pures, maxed zerkers, maxed obby maulers, pick some of the best brids, and also pick a couple of noobs to get their opinion. I think for the most part people just want a longer pj timer because it’s ridiculous if you are a solo pker. You just get bullied. I can’t wait for this council though because I want the pvp community to thrive!

If u dont undestand now i dont think any other amount of explaining will do ya any good. Lets say me. I post a screenie of me winnig 10b. Then u ask people who is celtic legend, they say oh hes that dude from mm. Then u ctrl f mm forums and u got my login name from 2007. Nice.

I've said it before but letting players have the last say on updates was a mistake.

lol, stop projecting you 12 year old.

Unrelated topic, but what configs did you use on your launcher to have the UI look as nice and high res as this?

yes but jagex stated they don't mind menu swapping. this is performing the whole click on bone feature all together. This isn't just menu swapping. it's completely removing the drag mouse over bone -&gt; click bone -&gt; drag to altar.
---
I've always heard it stood for "Player Jumping".
---
Youre misunderstanding
---
Im comparing Runelites plugin for changing the left click option on bones from BURY to USE to OSBuddys plugin for changing the left click option of logs from USE to LIGHT.
---
Already said that the left click option on ALTARS was pushing it

Jagex. If you do 1 you have to accommodate the rest of us.

Look up a full Jad fight video without commentary, then open your game and go stand by an altar. Practice switching your prayers along with the video. You can pray at the altar to simulate potions. That's how I practiced and I beat Jad first try, good luck.

&gt;Because, as evidenced by the clear hostility between the two communities, it does nothing but drive a wedge between PvMers and PvPers while not providing anything that couldn't be provided elsewhere.
---
Why should jmods cater to every whiny minority that pops up in this community? I personally appreciate the fact that certain high-reward activities are in PvP areas, it makes the game more dynamic and fun, and I know several people who feel the same way. If you want to play a repetitive hugbox clicking game, go play cookie clicker.
---
&gt;Risk and reward aren't magical things which can't be balanced outside the wilderness. If we want to make a boss more risky, we could simply add a "high risk" PvM area with actual items lost on death. Or simply lower the reward while keeping the mechanics the same. 
---
I never claimed they were. But having high-reward activities in the wildy has been a balancing aspect since the game was first created, and people are acting like it's some awful new thing.
---
&gt;There's plenty of ways to balance content without using a pvp vs pvm cat and mouse mechanic that is inherently frustrating to the mice.
---
The purpose of high-risk activities is that sometimes it doesn't work out and you get frustrated/upset. Otherwise it's not risky.
---
&gt;Then we could actually focus more on true PvP additions like BH and LMS instead of PvPvM mechanics which most of the community hates.
---
Proof that most of the community hates it?
---
&gt;Otherwise, why would I ever vote to make content more frustrating than it already is? It's not out of spite. I don't dislike PvP. I dislike PvPvM
---
That same argument could be applied to any update that makes the game easier. "Should we give every player a twisted bow?" "HURRRR WHY WOULD I VOTE NO???? IT MAKES THE GAME MORE FRUSTRATING NOT HAVING A TWISTED BOW"
---
Nothing wrong with profiting off of Adam's high horse mentality over at RL. A majority of players want plugins like theae.
---
As you can see by my expertly drawn path, whenever I get teled to this spot I am forced to navigate the cruel Gielnor terrain, costing me valuable run energy.
---
If this spot is removed from the tele location, I will be able to run the farming guild seconds faster, allowing me to bankstand at the farming guild much quicker
---
&gt;Did you talked to oziach in edgeville and showed him the normal anti dragon shield?
---
&gt;Yes i did and i think it really helps.  
---
This was my favorite part of the FAQ in the description
---
What about vengeance + rock cake?
---
In my opinion your opinion is opinionated.
---
It’s not even close though. People drop things worth hundreds of thousand or even a few million GP all the time in wildy, and the amount of dropped supplies is staggering.
---
Damn, I logged in at cwars 2 weeks ago -70m, I feel you. I love this rebuild tho
---
Nobody would write a bot that does that, though
---
If by voices you mean wallets, then yes.
---
&gt; but you also can't shove PvM content into the wilderness and then cut the people who use that content out of the conversation
---
I'll agree with this, I think what people are upset about is spite voting. For instance, polled questions that, if anything, nerf certain PvP tactics, but that PvMers vote no on because a lot of PvPers think that those kinds of updates are good for the community.
---
I don't know how much that happens, only the jmods do. But if that kind of spite voting is a thing, then they should absolutely think of a solution to it, because it's bullshit.
---
I wish that was the max total emails
---
Still no hydra task

Lmfaooo

just rake leaves for the next millenia

It's a fantastic blessing that we managed to sneak our way up to this point before Jagex could do something about it. We're not kids anymore with nothing but free time. OSRS is literally unplayable without an "OP" third party client.
---
Says the troll who no doubt actively supports caging children who are legally trying to immigrate.
---
Is this guy still alive
---
I could swear this guy's from Toronto. I seen a guy few weeks back hanging out in Toronto that looked identical to him up town.
---
When you see your revenue drop 85%
---
Turns our it's both. Player Jumping is more like what happens on pvp worlds when you try to loot your kill. Deep wilderness PJing is more tag-teaming, unless you manage to time stealing someone elses kill
---
At the same time they have reason (RS3’s low numbers) to think that they shouldn’t do this to OSRS. Along with policy makers eyeing the heavily MTX driven content on RS3 it would seem pretty foolish to make the same mistake twice. Killing off RS3 and then OSRS would seem too stupid to come true
---
Because all pking is pker vs pvmer, otherwise you'd have the balls to play full time LMS.
---
You didn't tell him not to lvl your defense?
---
These damn developers pushing envelopes is gonna make Jagex take away our shiny 3rd party client toys because one kid kept trying to throw his at the teacher
---
Hahaha it’s pretty funny looking back at it, I think he might’ve been one of the first to hit 120 dung though.
---
A bit like the audio description setting on the TV?

To summarise, it was a woman in a hospital bed with a caption about how she had a bad infection after getting rattled in a swamp.

He wants a reward - either being new monsters in multi  or being in multi and killing people with his friends ? Right? that's so easy and boring why build new content specifically multi combat areas when the same man claimed he doesnt leave revs. Lol theres a whole bunch of multi combat zones ! They arent as rewarding as revs but hey why does everything have to drop so much valuables now ? What happened to just having fun. Smh
---
Mouse movement is an input, if it cuts out mouse movement it's 1:2. If you are literally remapping a key to another key that is perfectly fine
---
lol 50 constr
---
No, I'm saying that as person who has played the game, including both rs2 and rs3, since 2004. It has nothing to do with being 3d or not... 
---
The game content did not meaningfully change. All the same content was there. The "rs3" update was an arbitrary change that really didn't change shit.
---
Changing the graphics does not make it a new game. Your save persisted, and all the old content sass still there. It was an update, not a new game.
---
Fuck how'd I miss that? You're right thats awful
---
Cause those streams don't do anything to actually stop bots
---
if they get in legal trouble for putting them into rs3, theyll get in even more trouble putting them in osrs.
---
Argue the pedantics of my wording however you want, it doesn’t change the fact that ahk was seen by jagex as a problem when this prayer plugin is WAY worse. It’s not even menu entry swapper anymore it’s so far beyond
---
Mustache
---
Just remove ironman. It's a multiplayer game.
---
Pretty sure you can just wander back a bit and let Nieve do most of the work on those guys?
---
there are different sorts of lotteries. Small lotteries for like $500k are different odds than a $100m prize.

They cancelled like 2 important game updates, nerfed the hell out of a skill minigame, and then added mountains of micro-transaction events in all of that, one of which has Virtus in it.
---
Pking is simply too complicated for a casual player now. Back in the day everyone pked because it was fun and simple. Now everyone is so try-hard that it pushes most casual players away from pking. The more attempts to “fix” this problem just creates more and more decide between the player base.
---
Wilderness loot maintains its high value far longer than non wilderness loot.
---
The effect of these items being in the wilderness works.
---
-900k/h would be still bad
---
-800k/h also bad
---
It's time to abuse runelite+ now i guess. Cause with this, i feel jagex is finally gonna put a foot down on these super overpowered plugins.
---
I was on the fence, but now i'm gonna get myself 90 thieving finally at menaphites.
---
The craziness what made it fun for me. I also liked how lower levels can still help out your team by killing the npc for soul fragments.
---
It would bring back a fun and alternative way to level combat stats besides nmz or afking at sand crabs.
---
Never lucky
---
Yes, runelite removed it from the official release, but there are self compiled versions that have that and more. There is nothing on the technical side for Jagex to know what client you are using, let alone what plugins that client is running.
---
Did you set up two-factor authentication? Do you even recognize the value of your account after proceeding through the many levels of the Stronghold of Security? DO YOU WANT 10k???!!
---
Not sure what’s my humour here. 
---
The post or your photography skills.
---
You hit the nail on the head, it's a democracy and my vote should count because it's my game. Just because I don't PvP alot doesn't mean I won't when I get the stats I want either. The rs end game that sets it apart from other games that makes the grind seem worth it is largely the PvP benefits you get once you reach your goals. If the PvP community feels like they don't have much of a voice, it's because they don't, welcome to democracy.
---
Dude holy shit I was a forum mod for battlescape back in like 2011 lol. It was an awesome game tbh but it had a lot of trouble with getting ddosing, hacking, and getting shut down by Jagex. Same guy palidino was making it. It wasn't a scam, just another rsps. I don't know if that's changed since then.
