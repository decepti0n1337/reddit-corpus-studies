Could have been a runelite bug. Something else that led me to this is a problem I‚Äôve experienced for maybe a month now when I use the quick-hop tool on runelite I‚Äôd say 1/10 times it would kick me out of the cc and I‚Äôd have to re-log to be able to get back in.

I like the idea of the grand exchange, but it enabled the bots an easy way to annihilate the game economy with their farming. The grand exchange could have been handled better.

I love the idea of listing different clans honestly, maybe show the wealth of clans as well, and what players are affiliated with the clan. I kind of hated clanman mode, but if Jagex can embrace it and clean it up a bit I would be for it

By banning free trade. How else do you attempt to completely stop gambling?

I just did underground pass and regicide for an elite clue. Should i look into upgrading the staff. I don't remember much about how to recharge it.

How are Jagex benefiting if I may ask? Genuinely not aware of this, if they are indeed benefiting. 
---
I agree, the duel arena is one aspect of the game which can induce addictive behaviour but wouldn't you agree that there are other elements of the game which could be seen as similar to the duel arena? For example trading in wintertodt pieces for a drop-table roll, opening konars chest, literally every npc drop, etc.. 
---
Obviously these have less returns than the duel arena but they also have less risk. I'm not defending the duel arena as it very much is an example of actual gambling (and it doesn't make sense to remove other forms of gambling yet keep this in the game) however you're going about doing this all wrong. 
---
Parliament won't do anything about this. Mtx is another example of gambling yet it remains as one of the main sources of revenue for the company. 
---
Duel arena junkies are similar to actual gambling addicts as in, inherently they both display similar behavioural patterns. Sure, this is terrible (and probably not as bad as actually throwing away your life savings) but no one's stopping actual gambling addicts. No one's putting in legislations to stop the 40-year old gambling addict with a family from throwing away their son/daughters schooling fees (damn I got a bit too specific lol).
---
What I don't understand is the lack of awareness this receives. Not just in the game but in real life. These people are down right addicted and think that their big break is just around the corner and keep chasing the 'thrill'. I just hope that this kind of outlook changes, not because these people are almost helpless (and I guess that is a concern too) but because the casinos that profit from them are going to keep profiting from it and do everything in their power to stop anyone that could affect their total revenue.

It's not really fun because of the necessity of pray flicking which kills all attraction to casual players

i said stop gambling in the duel arena as thats by far the biggest culprit jesus christ learn to read.

dicing is a tiny portion compared to the arena, so get rid of the arena and youve done a massive step towards getting rid of gambling
---
theres no other way to gamble in game since they changed flowers ect in RS3 they could easily add all that stuff to OSRS then the gamblers have no leg to stand on
---
Unless someone goes out of their way to organize an event, no. It probably has something to do with the fact that even if 23 people somehow showed up at the same time to play, they still could start a game.

I‚Äôm 90% sure in OSRS it was brought in to combat Guthans NMZ. It was brought in shortly after the point where the OSRS server‚Äôs started back in the day, as well. IIRC, at the time it was an anti-botting measure specifically targeted at otherwise legitimate players who would log in and then deploy scripts (as oppose to having bot farm accounts that see the bot do everything). 
---
There are events, and during the event you can earn event tokens by completing objectives, and also purchasing token bundles. The prestige skins for the events require a token amount that can't realistically be gained through gameplay alone, so you need to purchase tokens to get the skin

Nice

Nobody reading this has had 3 ironman tbows so we'll never know. I'd love to have a constant reminder that I have 3 of one of the most sought after items in the game

Dude it‚Äôs a game, you shouldn‚Äôt care what other people think about the way you play it. Take a lesson from me, I think Ironman is a beyond stupid way to play the game, I also actively play an UIM. I don‚Äôt even care what *I* think about the way I play the game.

The playtime however is often used on doing multiple other tasks at the same time. You can't directly compare time spent in RuneScape with time spent in some other game like FPS's that require your full attention.

Were you on rs3?

Yikes

Not if you set the ‚Äúremember device for 30 days‚Äù before accepting login.

That rule was terrible. It only stopped legit players and people who played together irl. Botters will just bypass it like they used to.
---
Putting this game on mobile was not good for my "addiction" or my wallet.
---
Take WoW for instance, semi-similar situation here. It's an mmorpg that you pay for, and much like Runescape you play it on the computer. Now there comes a point where you just don't play as much as you used to for whatever reason, so you cancel your sub and move on happily. 
---
I've done this multiple times with OSRS, and once I have more time I'll come back resub and play happily. Unfortunately, those sneaky masterminds have now put OSRS on mobile. Sitting on the toilet? Do some runecrafting. On lunch break? Maybe enchant some jewelry. Can't sleep? Go to bed to the soothing sounds of fishing. 
---
Before when I would've unsubbed, now I don't because I still play this game on my phone instead of having to commit on my computer. 
---
Good game Jagex. Take my $11.
---
"Our game is not addictive. It also has 200,000 hours of content. Definitely not related. nope. next question"
---
yea exactly, noob jagex
---
OP made the post on 4chan for anyone wondering by the way.
---
&gt;enough money
---
Look man in the other game I lapped and quested out 1-99 RC. If it wasn't for effigies I wouldn't have gotten 99 rc until runespan came out. I effectively quit after that update because devalued.
---
50% of addicts are obese and 50% are twigs
---
I had too look up house edge as the only experience I've had gambling is literally for shits and giggles whilst I was drunk lol.
---
Does the tax really work like a house edge though? As Jagex aren't necessarily involved in a stake transaction between two parties, do they really have anything to gain as it's been confirmed that the gold leaves the economies circulation. The term 'tax' is far more fitting than a house edge, I agree it does work similarly yet not exactly the same as the tax is a fixed percentage whereas a house edge works more like an average.
---
I didn't think about the bonds being used to stake though, whilst the economy does seem to be benefiting from this (to an extent), Jagex definitely seem to be benefiting from bonds bought specifically to stake. The actual figures aren't given to us (as in, how many bonds are bought purely for staking). However, from a business standpoint, if this number was anywhere above 0 it would be daft to get rid of a potential source of profit.
---
It's shitty though, of course. If they really did care about the players addicted to gambling, they would intervene. But on the flip side, there are plenty of people that are addicted to the game itself too. The difference is that these people are losing time instead of in-game currency.
---
I don't really mind Jagex profiting, they are a company with shareholders after all. The problem arises when they're profiting over people with genuine mental health concerns (and gambling addiction is definitely one). 
---
And have literally gotten people banned in tourney
---
After unlocking 99 hunting through lamping, I can now hunt redwood imps, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

I feel more like RuneScape attracts people with the issues that Jagex is helping to fix. It's not like you just start playing OSRS and suddenly get the issues from it.
---

Doubt anyone would play the absolute same game, no changes, no new content, for 6 years straight. The game would be straight trash, it was fun back then because it was still new, can you imagine cycling through 5 slayer monsters persay for 6 years? Every single game has updates and new content, every single game would be dead without them. Jagex makes a lot of mistakes that they could definitely work on, but people really underestimate how different of a company they are in comparison to ANY other company in the market. One of only, if not the only game to have the community decide on every single update? Big or small??That‚Äôs why I came back to OSRS. 
---
I‚Äôve stopped browsing this sub significantly because of the crazy amounts of negativity and pure anger. I mean, really think about what you said, play the SAME exact game and do the same exact thing for 6 years? Imagine you eat the same exact 3 meals, wear the same set of clothing, go to work and back, go to only mcdonalds for fastfood, you can only eat a cheeseburger if you go there, watch the same exact movie or tv show for 6 years? Prison has more variety than that and that‚Äôs god damn hard to top.

Oh why you say that? I'm still trying to do bosses and stuff too not just pvp. 
---
 UIM BTW

I just finished MM1 and didn't end up using any of my super restores that I got from Zogre Flesh Eaters (managed to pray flick the tunnels so that I didn't need to sip). It doesn't feel right dropping them, and I don't really want to waste a slot for 6 sips. Is there any activity that I will need prayer / stat restore that I can do to use these and get that out of the way as well?

Alright man, thanks for sharing and goodluck with your other stats!

The route through zeah looks tricky because you'll unlock tithe Farm which could suck. You could head north to the wildy and get a mith axe from dragons. That could unlock the monastery and edge? As well as a better furnace, and food from trout and salmon if you take East swamp to fish.....

Nah couldn't. Just a mobile typo.

It can be considered Libel &amp; Defamation.

So theoretically, yes.

Wait, isn‚Äôt world 1 only on RS3? Or are you talking about 301? I only ask because I don‚Äôt play RS3 since 08, and don‚Äôt recall seeing a world 1 on OSRS.

Multi-logging to gain an unfair advantage shouldn't be allowed. I know people who play their main and have 3 rune dragon alts. That's not good for integrity.

Will there be International language servers added to OSRS at any point in the future? 
---
I would think the translations have already been done for most of the assets as they have been done for rs3, though I don't know how difficult it would be to implement them on a handful of worlds.
---
And then do it again as an IM
---
**This changes everything**
---
It definitely needed the flair, but the thumbnail didn't give it away for you?
---
Comparable to a 99, although some of the boss fights add some additional challenge (fuck sliske's endgame) 
---
Or people should be allowed to make their own decisions. 
---
Jagex just moves their headquarters to another country that doesn't rule that. Simple really. It will effect only players in said country at that point. If they rule company side limits jagex would just have to move countries and it wouldn't even matter to the players in said country. This is the problem with any legislation in any country involving technology. Our policy makers just don't understand it enough. Plain and simple and it evolves so rapidly it's hard to expect them to.
---
Do you know what, if anything, there really is to buy for free players in RS3? I'm not familiar with what content expansion has been made available for free players in RS3.
---
Im sorry but video games themselves arent addictive. You cant get addicted to a video game, its just not possible. Having a gambling problem is something else and isnt really much related to video games.
---
Just because you  enjoy a game doesnt mean you cant do without. Take a person that playa 16 hours a day for a year and cut him off completely. He will be 100% fine, only problem is he might be sosiacially damaged by the lack of human interaction.
---
Im so tired of people claiming video games are addictive, there is actually 0 proof it is. If you chose a game over other things you have other issues that are there wether you play a game or not. That being said, jagex responded like any company would, but gambling shouldnt be a part of video games. Gambling took a short stop by video games and will be gone soon, its already happending in many games
---
Interesting. I haven't started the Troll quest line yet, so I might actually jump into that. Thanks!

How come the Wiki doesn't list the drop rate of an item from a certain monster but other pages readily display this info for different monsters? For example, a hard clue scroll dropped by greater demons is simply listed as "rare" but with no drop rate.

---
Is it possible to change the sound system so that if I have "Area Sounds" disabled, I can still hear audio that is associated with my character? Such as skilling and combat.
---
Hearing the repetitive sound of other people mining, wcing, fletching and other player's pets is really obnoxious. But if I disable "Area Sounds", there are several bits of sounds that I can't hear my character doing and I find it a little hard to play. (sorry, I'm not one of those people who can play RS without sounds x.x)
---
To add onto this, IF this is possible, I would like it so that hearing other player's attacks done onto me is also still possible. Currently, if you have "Area Sounds" disabled, you cannot hear Teleblock, Ancient Magicks and other attacks.
---
Please consider looking into this. Thank you for reading. :)
---
For me the gray area has always been that because bonds (bought with real world money) can be traded for gold (usable in-game), that to me feels like there is an implicit real world value to gold. It's not exactly meant to be transferable in reverse, but one could say that a player buying bonds is kind of cashing out in-game digital resources for a real world benefit (even if that's just continuing the service that is RS). The argument against this seems to hinge on the fact that you can't officially convert gold directly to real world money, but it still seems shaky to say the extreme of no link. If real world money did not influence in-game at all (outside of stuff like subscription fees) I could understand that position, but that's not true.

I only do hards because i had 86 farming when they  released the farming guild an contracts. On average its like 100-150k worth of seeds per contract completed, there's always 1 or 2 valueble seeds given as a reward like 1 torstol/ranarr/snapdragon and then 2maples/yew/magic/redwood/dragonfruit. Just do inexpensive contracts like herbs,flower,allotment and lower tier tree/fruit tree. got 250 contracts and profited like 20m worth of seeds lol.

Unique email address used only for your runescape account. Authenticator on both your runescape account AND the email address. Get a bank pin. Don't enter your account details on any sketchy links you click on. In fact, don't click on the link to begin with. Double xp doesn't exist. Boaty, Sparc Mac, and/or Woox are not quitting.
---
Because the drop rate isn't known. The project we're doing to add these drop rates relies on a lot of drop data from runelite, and since you can't get clues if you already have them, we can't get a great estimate on the drop rate.
---
Having them completed feels better

Because you get to do more of the area's content that is usually locked behind trivial obstacles. Restricted ironmen are interesting because they make use of a lot of content that no one knows or cares about. If they can't access that content because there isn't a net spawn or drop in the entire region, then we're just losing interesting content.

Can we possibly get a pearl rod case for the poh? Currently there are quite a few pearl rods that can be purchased with pearls from aerial fishing and if you are an UIM it is a waste of space to get all of these for collection purposes.

I don't have base 70 yet rc is my arch rival!

Things are definitely harder as an ironman. Getting your fire cape with broad bolts and just a few sharks, no anti venom and no mage for zulrah, planning the next steps for your account... I've played both game modes to 2k+ total and now as an ironman I definitely look down on normies a little. I'm also having a lot more fun, if it wasn't for ironman mode I wouldn't be playing any longer.

People are so damn focused on authenticator delay they avoid looking at the real issue, which is being social engineered into an account recovery. 
---
No other mainstream service provider delays 2FA removal. Not Google, Blizzard, GitHub, or Microsoft, among other companies, and for good reason. It's a faux security suggestion that doesn't really solve anything (hijackers still potentially have your password and/or enough information to perform account recoveries).
---
Here's some useful security improvement suggestions Jagex could implement which would ACTUALLY make a difference:
---
* One-time random password being mandatory for account recovery. Generate it once you activate the feature, keep it safe (preferably on paper), never worry about getting recovered unless you lose access to your email. Would need severe warning due to the possibility of losing it and permanently losing access to the account.
---
* Implement government ID validation for account recovery. Expensive and a HUGE can of worms legally, but it'd also solve nearly all problems.
---
* Allow users to use custom recovery questions
---
* Allow ability to disable account recovery altogether (with severe warnings)
---
* Account setting change notification - Auth removal, password change, recovery attempt notification. A push notification is usually better than an email (which we already get), so it'd be a welcome change for people that don't check their mail often.
---
The following would be nice to have, but ultimately don't make a big difference
---
* Allow case-sensitive passwords
---
* Allow passwords with symbols
---
* Allow longer than 20-character passwords
---
(Passwords can't be brute forced with their heavy throttle, but I guess it couldn't hurt)
---
* Require 2FA codes on the website (minor because you can't remove 2FA instantly from the website without access to your email. Worst that can happen is change your name once, which is reversible, or getting banned from the forums)
---
* Optional authenticator removal or account recovery delay. It'd potentially lock you out of your account and make you lose some membership, and you really really shouldn't be relying on this to keep your account safe, but sure, ultimately it's a feature and could be useful for someone.
---
Game is not going downhill, it was going downhill in 2013. Game is fine, mods are new and too many mistakes are making past qa. Hopefully moving forward these mistakes will be a thing of a past. 
---
Generally, it applies when the monsters are aggressive, the monsters will aggro onto the pker and you allowing you to box the creature.
---
The biggest issue with it being an esport, is that the best way to win is have hundreds of people on your team. Building up a few people for singles, and locking down areas so other people can't actually progress.
---
If it was a serious esport, with serious prize money at stake, you'd get groups paying huge numbers of people to play to try and flood the tournament with their own people.
---
There is no solution to that, without just making it a head to head PVP event, which is already exactly what the pvp allstars was. And even then, if you have a field of thousands of participants, you'd get clans suiciding to their best players to skip rounds. Which is a huge benefit given the amount of RNG in OSRS PVP.

I think dmm could be a lot better if they made clans all share the same bank. Then if one clan member gets killed the entire clan loses their best stored items. It would put solo players and clans on more equal footing.

Thanks for understanding the question, though I don't think there is really an answer.

Gotcha lol mb 
---
Agreed the kill log and chat log not matching up drives me nuts sometimes and I‚Äôd vote yes to the proposed hydra change
---
GE was added early 2008 stop spreading uninformed bullshit. Probably took them a day to re-implement.
---
They would do it if it would work. But clans don't need everyone to be in the finals, they'd just feed their best players at the end of the season.
---
Go into the settings for the Ground Items Plugin.
---
Just above all the color settings is an option labeled "Hide &lt; Value" that defaults to 0.
---
Set it to whatever number you want to be the minimum to get labeled.  If you want only items labeled blue by default to be visible, set it to 20000.
---
Finally, there's an option higher up labeled "Don't hide untradeables".  If you check it then untradeable items will always how on the ground, regardless of the first setting.  If that's something you want, then check it.  If you want them unlabeled, then uncheck it.

I‚Äôve played since day 1 and don‚Äôt have it yet. I cba getting my mining up it‚Äôs like the only req I need

I‚Äôm guessing his account was worth a few bills then, if he had 3 tbs then i‚Äôd say his bank is like 4.5 bill, worth like $4000-4500. Not bad really if you‚Äôre broke and desperate.
---
Are you logging in on moblie through "game centre" perhaps?
---
Shortbow would have a faster attack rate, but I guess no ruby and diamond so it'd probably be close.
---
You lost me.
---
With the farming guild being added and herblore getting much easier you could use diary and fossil island lamps on it.  Early on thats going to save you a ton of time over gathering essence and the terrible xp rates of runecrafting in general.  There are only a handful of runecrafting requirements for quests and diarys.  
---
Otherwise I would put it off until you passively generate enough essence through slayer.  Then do ZMI.  IMO runecrafting isn't a super useful skill outside of blood runes for barraging slayer tasks.
---
Also tears of guthix is great for training the middle levels like 40-60.
---
I got the point, it was hella stupid. 
---
We've made significant improvements in advertising, etc. but I'll concede we probably wouldn't have the playerbase we have now without any updates.
---
I don't care tho, that was still the peak of the game to me. 
---
The implication that it's even possible to ignore the updates is ridiculous.
---
Only when you uncharge it to make it tradeable

Can we get a drop table for hell hounds? currently the only way to profit from them with a low slayer lvl is brimstone keys, totem pieces, and mysterious emblems in wildy slayer. Higher slayer levels get to do cerberus and have the chance to make a huge profit, meanwhile when getting a hell hound task at a lower slayer lvl you sometimes lose money. 
---
I think the overall point is that mtx is kinda seen as gambling made easy and accessible and isn't regulated with protections in place like the op out. Personally I see it as gambling but not in the same sense as you get something irl for it. Hell if anything the sand casino is more of a problem lol.
---
Oof. Friend was teasing me about my typing speed the other day. She said wow! You tupe quick , learn that from Warcraft? Said nope. Oh my bad It was RuneScape or LoL or tf2 then huh.
---
HEAR HEAR
---
Why not just spawn some dogs for Settled, and some low level Hunter things to?
---
The point of doing an account like that is that it's much more tedious to do stuff
---
This is why i dont fletch.

Mtx and I'm gone
---
For the record, I didnt downvote you. 
---
It's a recognised handicap. Slayer is for slaying monsters. They are not monsters just due to being less able-bodied.
---
Stole it from r/programmerhumor 
---
I don't think this would have the effort you're looking for. You'd still have the same distribution of players. If you have everyone in 1 zone, you'd have 30% in clan A, 25% in clan B, 20% in clan C, and the other 25% are solo player.
---
If you split it into 10 zones, you'd still have roughly those same percentages. Or, you'd have 1 clan get really lucky and have almost all their players end up in 1 zones, while other clans all got split up fairly evenly and lose most of their players. That'd just provide a huge RNG component.

Thank you for the input on the sacred eels! I had totally meant to include both them and internals as they each are fairly afk and require no post-processing. Bones is an interesting processing option I hadn't thought of since I haven't gotten around to building one yet.
---
I will have to look into Amethyst in terms of its uses for ironmen.
---
My overall goal is to max, and to that end your suggestions of NMZ and cutting yews/magic/redwoods would probably not work for me personally. My melees will be (2 already are) maxed through slayer, as will range to an extent. Magic is 0 time anyways. The trees cause frequent logouts due to highly variable afk times, and the overall efficiency is poor. WC Exp cutting is poor, fletching is 0 time through arrows and FM is done through WT anyways, making the high level logs (except the amount needed for birdhouse runs) not efficient.

If the account is still showing up on the highscores and you are sure you are using the correct email it is possible someone has taken possesion of the account and wouldnt hurt to try recover it.

Not sure why they didn't include that in the original Runescape app

After taking a bit of time off during uni, graduating, getting a job etc, whilst being in a relationship, when it comes to free time it just feels like 'What's the point?'. The grind is just too much for the (and I hate this term but...) "Real world". I think it would be very different if the friends I knew back in the day, before eoc etc still played osrs. I still keep up to date on news and content, browse this sub relatively often, and sometimes watch streams. However, while it's entertaining to watch clips, it's nearly impossible to justify hunting a single drop for several thousand hours when you take a step back and consider what you could be achieving with that time if you made different choices. For me at least.  
---
I'm not saying those that spend thousands of hours playing the game are wrong to do so by any means, and it's also different for streamers since they make a living from it, but taking that step back was quite the eye opener for me in terms of the time I was investing versus what I was getting out of it. I'm still enjoying swampletics though.

I learned to ignore it but I still felt the affects of MTX on ironman. I‚Äôve played ironman mode since day one on rs3 and quit my maxed main. I‚Äôm enjoying osrs so far. I play mostly on my ironman/ultimate but even mainscape feels rewarding.

Better for what, exactly? Potato cactus grow a lot faster so they're probably better for xp if you're regularly checking them, but regular cactus have a higher chance at the pet. I don't think there's really any point in doing either of them for money, so the only other reason I can think of doing them is if you specifically need either cactus spines or potato cacti for herblore or whatever, in which case you should do the one that gives the thing you need.
---
HAPPY! I was actually thanking Jagex :D

Sold for around 588k all together :)

Ugh. Lame. Botting really bums me out.

Wow nice 600k right into the stash gz

Can you be 15 and still have full range void on ?

You could ping test all the worlds in your cmd prompt should show which is most stable for you.

Before aus worlds opened up i had to do this everytime id play to find a world under 300ms
---
What‚Äôs the difference between me working an 8 hour shift to playing a computer game for 8 hours. The only difference is I am actually enjoying myself playing the game but they call it an addiction. The word addiction doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs a bad thing. It all depends on what you‚Äôre addicted to. I wouldn‚Äôt say my main source of entertainment is bad for me...
---
Same. It gives them a personality. Like they're staring outside longing for something lmao.
---
What does addiction mean?
---
Like some drugs are physically addictive. Your body craves more and more. If you try quitting, you go into withdrawl. That's clearly addiction. However, what isn't clear to me, is what makes runescape supposedly addictive. I have never heard of anyone going into physical withdrawl from being unable to play runescape. It seems to be a concious choice to play runescape so much. Perhaps someone who knows more than I do can clear that up for me?
---
Just take my upvote :)
---
I'm on the same boat, but ended up just stashing it in a looting bag and continuing with my plan to slay until higher combat so I can finish all the most important quests
---
So far my looting bag isn't even close to being full, so it hardly matters
---
I‚Äôm interested in using the crystal halberd for the majority of my melee training. What‚Äôs the lowest combination melee stats that I could have while also having 100cb so that I can unlock the CHADberd? 
---
Thanks. 
---
OSRS has a _lot_ of these kinds of references everywhere in the game. Like how Captain Khaled is a direct reference to DJ Khaled, for example 
---
They would be too small to notice the change anyway
---
Make It atleast usable in PvM
---
It was default in beta
---
&gt; since I haven't gotten around to building one yet
---
Are you an ironman? If not you can use someone else's altar at Rimmington World 330
---
Not to mention it pays for 1-2 months expenses so he can stream full time 
---
It is, but they made memes back then, now its literally a ghost town and many of them frequent the reddit even though they won't admit it, since there isn't really any old school runescape communities of forums anymore. Which is why everyone is on reddit.
---
that's more work than a lot of the capes out there though
---
Is it at all possible to add mouse support for mobile?
---
Some players can only play OSRS on mobile and trying to do some bosses, like zulrah or vorkath, takes extra effort to make sure you tapped on the right tile and your character doesn't start pathing to narnia. 
---
This was annoying asf
---
Reminds me of the end to Clue.
---
Congrats. Looks like justiciar worked out 
---
Must've gave you a heart attack lol 
---
What's up with the rocks on the ground suddenly being on top of my character every time he does any action?
---
I am sadly, I have done it on my main in other houses before but so far on my Ironman have gotten by using the wilderness altar since I am not a hardcore. I have also not leveled my prayer past 80 so far, opting to bank ensouled heads and bones for now for some unknown future bossing task.
---
Well maple shortbow and addy arrows are already the best dps by far in f2p, rune arrows and yew bow would make it even more unbalanced
---
Ya 301 I figured most people would know what world 1 is lol...I went there to drop some rune stuff to the f2p noobs and found this horde
---
nice good job buddy
---
I had the valuable drop and untradeable drop notifications turned on and it was great because they were red and stood out in chat, but recently for some reason they are now black and much harder to notice. Is there any way to change it back?
---
Agree with your point about MTX but I don't see how RS3 combat is "Bugged to shit". Imo oldschool combat feels more buggy and annoying but I know that take isn't going to get a lot of love here.
---
Y'all just reminded me to pk there
---
I genuinely thought it was 93 when I said that. It‚Äôs late, i‚Äôm tired, and don‚Äôt really care if it‚Äôs 92 or 93, since without looking at xp your visibly close to 99 at either. üôÑ

Thanks!
---
Not me I drink too much!
---
why are you crying about jagex's response? I swear you people will cry about anything ... do you want them to admit that players are RWTing to gamble with a house "rake" of 1%? do you think that is a good idea and/or reasonable? 
---
I disagree, not saying it would've been a good business decision, it'd be a much smaller game but that also translates to a fairly significant reduction in costs. I think it would definitely be profitable enough to keep up.
---
The way they run it now is much more lucrative so I can't blame them at all but I can't help feel a bit sad. I remember when the original runescape 2007 server poll came out I was upset that lower membership fees and a bigger dev team was part of the same poll.. When the poll came out I was so excited to vote, but then regretted it when I considered the consequences, because I would've happily paid $15/month extra in exchange for no updates.
---
Obviously there are different capacities at which you can play basically any game. I don't mean to suggest that you cannot play EVE casually, but that the competitive aspects of EVE are mind-bogglingly large and cooperative.
---
Only 11 days more for 99 for me
---
its not that mage accuracy does nothing, it just does very little. you want to use vestiments over prosy, the accuracy difference does matter when you are potentially casting 1200 times an hour against 9 targets.
---
Just wanted to thank everyone here for the down votes, it got me off of that cursed number. I am now at 69 karma :)

You have to have built up enough favor from Saradomin and Zammorak respectively to use the prayers.  Sara favor is gathered by going to the GE on f2p worlds and reporting bots.  Zammy favor is gathered by 1 item crystal bowing pkers.  Just do that for a few hours each and you'll be good to go.

Anybody notice the part where Jagex said:

---
You seriously compared playing a videogame 40 hours a week to a typical 40 hour work week?
---
A 40 hour work week makes you money. That‚Äôs how you survive.
---
Playing 40 hours of a videogame is just not healthy period.  You have 168 hours in a week. Considering the average, healthy person sleeps 8 hours a day, makes that go to 112 hours in a week. Let‚Äôs say you spend an hour a day total on eating, which is very generous. You now have 105 hours. 
---
You‚Äôre at 105 hours, and this is not even accounting for working a job, school, commuting places, various chores, exercise.
---
40 hours a week of RS means you‚Äôre pretty much dedicating 40% (38% exactly) of your WEEK to runescape. A video game.
---
What about having a social life? Working? Gym? Chores? Other random shit people do in a day to day life?
---
Playing 40 hours of any videogame a week is beyond unhealthy, period. Any sane person would recognize this.
---
Got it, any benefit to using the same log in for osrs and rs3?

Everyone had to start fresh in oldschool, so you'll have to make a new account. Start working towards barrows gloves and you'll get a good mix of activities, feel free to pm me. rsn:humblecanoe

So I already have the mining pet and runecrafting pet. I was wondering if someone can confirm which pet this is. I checked the wiki and it says that you can't get a mining pet from dense runestone but I haven't been able to find if you can get the runecrafting pet from dense runestone. Also anyone know the odds of this happening?
---
Just pay some lad 19 thousand pounds a year to hop the worlds and ban the bots

---
Not particularly other than it being the same old account, if it is old enough to be a username login then I guess just the fact that it isnt email. No real benefit other than that. Although I do believe username accounts (unless you have that same username in game still) are technically safer than email logins. Don't quote me on that one though lol.
---
pretty sad that you play an MMO and have no friends within it.
---
that was never against rules though. Playing multiple accounts at the same time to have more progress was.

I guess the gp/hr from hydra mainly comes from uniques then? Hydra seems to be about 100k a kill and Vorkk 150k

Then they'll just bot the next thing.

My point was about spending GP in both comments. Your comment was about "buyables". My last comment was just to point out that they are not the same thing. Yes, you do have to spend money on an ironmen just as you do on a regular account. But that doesn't mean the buyable skills are the same. It's a strict subset.
---
Well yeah, I figured that was a given. I'm weird about decanting maybe but I didn't know it was a secret ^woops
---
dang only 85 run energy gz man

Don't be angry I'm trying my best

I think the +1 carried into the tourney sould need more to be done to unlock. Maybe add untradeable boxes as a universal drop in DMMS, these boxes would have 4-5 tiers, with certain items being allowed to be stored in each. 
---
You would have to earn a box in DMMS to take a weapon into DMMT. If you only get a tier 1 then you're taking some shit gear, if you get a tier 4 you can take a VLS or something like that.

You don't get rc xp from mining so you can't get the rc pet from that. Either the wiki is incorrect (unlikely) or you didn't see the message from last trip to the alter. Either way fuck you for getting both pets already :)

It doesn‚Äôt have a reliable way to farm gp either...
---
92hp, 83att, 88str, 83 def. I‚Äôm gonna get those 3 to 90 in nmz at work. Should I use dharoks or whip? I used dharoks today with torture and I was getting insane xp. Would whip be better? (I can afford full bandos if I need to)

I‚Äôve done over 1B with Oakdice, they‚Äôre definitely legit. Also, as a rule of thumb, don‚Äôt use any service people spam about at the GE or in-game.  They‚Äôre mostly all scams.

Can't justify the cost or time. I can't put much time into the game, and I don't spend a whole lot of gp, so wines are plenty to sustain what I want to do without taking too much time

This scenario will always occur among high cmb level ish. The lvl 3 acc will pm'ed you if you want to win 100mil.Then his  "Bawr" ign main account suddenly appears out of nowhere to warn you, but there's a trick he claimed himself that he got 60m antilure and taught "victim" to antilure em 
---
i don't believe you.
---
hogwash.
---
this works too. idk why everyone else here has a hateboner for ironmen XD
---
It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want people to play that all day everyday, tourney worlds are meant for testing out the new gear. Not meant for people to try bossing risk free 
---
I tend to agree that gambling addiction isn't really Jagex's concern. If people make poor decisions, that's on them, not on Jagex.
---
However, if they're going to have gambling, they should be regulated as such.
---
Dude it's not even that. I know how to do that. It's a whoooole different level man. It's not even about killing the runners as fast as possible. You *intentionally delay* for certain amounts of time to manipulate who the healers aggro. The def job isn't even really def anymore- it's basically the healer helper. It's some really ridiculous shit that I do not claim to be good at but according to them it is mandatory to be a good defender lol.

Can we get the Legacy of Seergaze quest added to Old School, along with adding the Meiyerditch Laboratories and moving the blood runecrafting altar to the Meiyerditch Laboratories?
---
This area makes much more sense for a blood runecrafting altar to be at and is already there in normal RuneScape. Do we really need two runecrafting altars to be near the exact same place on Zeah?
---
I know that A Taste of Hope has already been added to the Myreque storyline. I don't know much about RS lore, so I don't know if having both of these quests would cause lore issues. But if both are possible storyline wise, then that would be awesome!
---
That would only move them to varrock

Oh no they say the N word. Plz make it stop.
---
I like open GL on osb makes the world look more alive 
---
Fuck that shit mate, it was wave 1 and I'm not gonna play with abusive dickheads. 
---
I think that's talking about the average account being 8 years old, not the average player having literally played for 8 years straight. Many, many people I meet talk about coming back from a very long (~10 year) break to play old school. My account is 14 years old, but I quit before hunter was released, and only came back for a month in 2012 when runespan was released.  I can almost guarantee my account is factored in as 14 years old, not ~4 years old (roughly the amount of total time I've been subscribed.)
---
EVE for sure, average age is easily &gt;5 although you have to discount secondary accounts ppl use in conjunction (it would mess up statistic)
---
I dont think you grasp the concept of MTX
---
Oh yeah and I assume you only browse text-only subreddits? Reminder that this isn't one
---
I was thinking they could set some slots aside for players with the highest combat skill level/xp to get through to the 1v1's. Say 1/4th of the slots? This would allow those who grinded the hardest to get a shot. Getting speared into the fog or losing 90 hp in a single tick is such a stupid way to die.
---
Yes, farming contracts OP
---
Don't forget that you can even get them on Irons....
---
&gt; The finest chefs
---
&gt; 32 cooking
---
Man would still be burning trout at that level lmao
---
Effectively losing 3 tbows on an iron is the same as losing 1.
---
The average time to obtain a tbow is ~500hrs doing solo raids.
---
So calling it "thousands of hours" isn't all that accurate.
---
Because ilI‚Äôm not going to dox people.
---
That's what happens when you use blowpipe without rigour
---
You just need 2 more of those and you can get a dhcb!
---
Bonds are MTX, TH is MTX. Difference is that one is cash ----&gt; coins and one is straight up gambling + allows you to buy xp.
---
photoshop btw
---
Thank you for taking the time to respond. I really do appreciate it. Mobile definitely makes some of the grind a lot more friendly. I‚Äôll update you once I‚Äôve killed Jad. Thank you for helping! :)
---
Nope :( except from the exp drops you earn from hits
---
That isn't the issue, the issue is that if it had any real use then clans could just farm it off each other
---
It would be like emblem farmers in BH worlds and would make clans even more powerful
---
I‚Äôll put it this way - Jagex hold all of the cards about how long people play, what works to engage the player base, how to get people returning to play again.
---
Big data. They control it and they said they don‚Äôt share it. Only Jagex knows what Jagex knows. Therefore, only they can be the ones to do anything to see if there is a problem.
---
Campaigns about addiction relief are ‚Äòreactive‚Äô. It sounds like you missed the MPs question line of ‚Äòwhat are you proactively doing‚Äô to spot problems.
---
Prevent. Not cure. In other words.
---
Wow how does this not havebmore uovotes ? Are the Pkers on only ?
---
I haven't touched runescape in years but Google recommended this page to me, what are the keys used for? Last time I played they'd just introduced bonds and had this really dumb wheel of fortune thing you could buy spins for, but the rewards were mostly garbage. Sorry if I'm asking a dumb question
---
I'm sure people are interested I know I am. Real question is how did you get that info?
---
Do ds2 asap. But until then even accumulator is better than range cape
---
Nice try Chris Archie
---
The range damage and accuracy from assembler is 100% always better
---
For what? Obor? That's already doable with bind or melee right?

Great, we are on the same page. You don't have shit. Now please stfu.
---
Thanks guys - it‚Äôs definitely on my list and in terms of skill requirements (with the exception of mining and smithing), I‚Äôm not far off. Just want to grind 99 first!!
---
63 chests done ever and no drops :( I don't do barrows anymore 
---
What are the team's thoughts on ironmen boosting kills to emblem farm, especially now that there are multiple other ways to get a rune pouch?
---
The detail above is the detail that was said.
---
We don‚Äôt know for sure. Only that it should be a combined figure for OSRS and RS.
---
Bonds could be considered MTX or could be considered Subscription.
---
Ah this really brings back memories
---
We just moved and finally had my own computer with internet access in my room. 14-year old me was euphoric ofcourse but I had school next day. My parents said I had to go off but silly me thought they couldnt hear me or be too stupid to think that I'd dare play while bedtime.
---
Anyways, I decide to go do some Kalphite Queen with some clanmates, it was our third time there. All was going well and we finish the kill. And then all adrenaline. A frikking d chain drop! My first ever valuable drop ever, worth more than my entire bank!
---
And then suddenly my door swung open and there was my mother yelling to get off immediately.
---
I was in such an adrenaline rush, but managed to pick up the d chaim, TP out, and log out. For my clanmates this was obviously looking like i was scamming them but didnt have any choice. I was banned for playing for an entire week bit couldnt care less, i had a frigging dchain! I did manage to get a message to my clanmates the following day, reassuring I wasn't ditching them. So in the end we all had a good laugh about the situation.
---
Good times, I still remember the daydreaming in class the next day, as it was yesterday...
---
I‚Äôm definitely more excited to get the blowpipe now lol! Would you recommend taking another bow or anything? Or just stick to the blowpipe for the cave? Appreciate your help! :)
---
you're a psychopath
---
Yeah exactly it's nice to afk while doing something else. It makes time go by faster.
---
That being said, it's definitely contributing to addiction. I'm gonna stop soon bc it makes it feel like not being on osrs is xp waste when I'm doing something boring or monotonous irl
---

Bye

Thanks
---
So I've started crafting nature runes as a way to make money and was curious which method is better. Should I be using glories as a way to teleport to Edgeville, or am I fine just continuing to use house tabs and using max houses?
---
If anything comes of it, yes. https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207256855-Negative-credit?

If nothing happens, keep an eye on the account and make sure you‚Äôre in the clear.
---
How do you think they get the logs off 
---
MM2. DS2 can be annoying from the pay-to-reclaim chests
---
The hunter xp though
---
Say that to my Ironman with 1.3k kc. 
---
It sure as hell is accurate to me. I'm pushing close to 1k hours (including scouting times) just at raids alone and I'm missing kodai, ancestral legs, dchb, tbow and pet.
---
I know the average is like 1/32 million points but I'm so unlucky it triggers me lol. 
---
Feelsbad. 
---
I get what your trying to do, but this is meant to be a skilling ‚Äúboss‚Äù so I‚Äôm not sure making it easier then it already is, is a good idea.
---
There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre at Ross lol. 
---
Hit the nail on the head about Jagex being reactive rather than proactive. 
---
Ive never seen a company fuck up more times and beg the community for help than they do. 
---
i will come raiding with you ;) 
---
The stream lasted 16 hours, but before Josh did Zulrah he did One Small Favour and a few other quests. I think the Zulrah part started around 8 hours in.
---
[Probably would have been better if I posted it like this from the start ey?....](https://i.imgur.com/X23iT1N.png) 
---
Thanks for explaining! That makes a lot of sense and corresponds with what I saw. :)
---
I agree fully about not taking items you wouldn't want to lose to PvP worlds! 
---
I figured I'd post what I had seen  since I saw quite a few low level/new players that had arrived looking for the drop party and then were easily fooled by the scammers manipulations. A lot of them had said during the conversations with the scammer that they had  joined in recent weeks, so I would guess they didn't have the wariness of a veteran player.
---
Thank you for the coverage. The last time I tuned in it was just everyone ripping on the snp and vice versa.  
---
Nice dude. I just got mine last week. Definitely the hardest fight I've ever done in the game.
---
You left your combat style exposed. You getting hacked muhahahaha
---
Hahaha man I remember doubling money back in the day and then running off with someone‚Äôs 50k thinking I was a genius
---
Fuck dude we all lived the same lives! Thanks for bringing up some passed/past? Memories :P
---
lol this dude plays osrs? Saw him on rajj royale but all I remember is his name, because he said literally 2 words in 4 hours
---
I actually find bloodvelds not to be bad xp at all tbh. But I'm also iron and never cannon so my view of good/bad xp may be skewed
---
&gt; handsome guys like me and my friends, with seven figures, a model wife and three phds. 
---
And a large population of liars. :^ )

Combat level 85 quest point cape, the lowest level you can get it. 
---
sure, but saying this is useless for irons because some choose not to do lavas isn't true.
---
Do you remember there names?
---
Someone told me that I shouldn't be wearing void without the full set once, so I explained the mage def, then he told me to fuck off if I'm not going to take his advice... he was getting smacked around in torags. I'm glad people like op exist to keep me sane lmao
---
Is there a dps calc that isn‚Äôt the spreadsheet one? That never works for me on mobile
---
Cool thanks
---
My father told me today, learn from the mistakes of people who take, or rather not, your advice.
---
You'll never save them all, and some children must really touch the fire to understand it's hot. 
---
I wish people didn't manipulate the games mechanics to take from others, but others will be less likely to be taken from, when they learn what hot really is.
---
Just another day in lousy players abusing new players. Unfortunately it's happened for a very long time.
---
Not OP but I disagree with it because they profit off it.  I firmly believe adults should be able to live, work and share freely, but I don‚Äôt believe they should be able to profit off anything freely.
---
Case and point: opiates.  Opiates are highly addictive and highly dangerous medicines.  I firmly believe any consenting adult who understands the risks should be allowed to have them.  In fact, I would argue any consenting adult should be allowed to have them without a prescription.
---
However, I don‚Äôt believe you should be able to make a significant profit off them.  The profit motive clouds judgement, encourages firms to misrepresent risks, and incentivizes deceptive behavior.  It makes pharm companies push the drugs onto everyone and everyone regardless of need or risk.  And it makes customers feel safer than they should while endangering them now than they should.
---
Likewise, I believe Jagex has a responsibility here.  Their profit motive for gambling has turned a daily activity into a CLICK NOW TO  WIN.  HURRY AS WE COUNT DOWN THE LITERAL SECONDS UNTIL THIS PROMOTION ENDS.  It is no longer a company offering a service to those who want to gamble.  It is now a company tricking people into developing a gambling addiction so they can reap all of its revenue.
---
So while I don‚Äôt believe the government should be policing video games for the sake of policing them, I think they should be policing companies like Jagex, and trying to stop them from giving kids a gambling addiction so they can milk their moms credit card.
---
Lmao dude I used to do the same thing. When I would get too loud and I could hear them getting up I would lay down and pretend like I was sleeping haha
---
Downvoted for title
---
lmao holy shit I think I literally turned off the stream while he was in the middle of buying karmabwans for this kill, I guess I was the bad luck charm
---
Thanks for making this. Got to relive some memories that I completely forgot about :)
---
I got so brave I used to sneak into the kitchen first to get a midnight snack
---
I honestly dont care what the content of the picture is. I only care if something like this pops out while im out in public like on a bus or eating somewhere. Thats definitely embarrassing
---
B T W
---
Probably mostly people still in school.
---
I tought I was Hella gangster when the 11 year old me was able to get in that place on 12 combat
---
I disagree. Wintertodt should not be made more AFK or any easier than it currently is. 
---
Yay, I've been looking forward to reading this ever since you mentioned it on stream during the tournament!
---
The only point I truly disagree with is #4. Honestly, I feel that the current list of quests that we have auto-completed is perfect. They unlock enough content for players to have an easier time, but don't completely open up the game without any effort. Despite how much ancient spellbook is "needed", a player can currently make a conscious choice not to complete DT and instead spend their time pursuing other goals... and I don't believe that taking away more choices is good for the long-term health of the game mode.
---
Other than that, the only other point with which I partially disagree is #2. I do like the idea of clue scrolls being shorter in DMM, but guaranteeing one-step clues is a bit much. Here's what I would do: 1 step for Easy clues, 1-2 steps for Medium clues, 2 steps for Hard clues, 2-3 steps for Elite clues, and 3 steps for Master clues (and I would also slightly re-balance the "3rd-age drop table").
---
Personally, my biggest issue with the current structure of DMM is that individuals can be fed massive amounts to soar ahead of the competition. I think that banning this practice should be the number 1 priority to improve Deadman Mode (I would allow it for the seasonal, because donation-man mode can provide entertaining content, but not during the tournament where $32k is on the line).
---
nace
---
Clues should be 2 step imo, more loot for wildy finish 
---
Alright man, thanks for answering that.  And yea, English is weird when it comes to spelling.  
---
On a separate note though, your English is so good I didn‚Äôt realize it was your second language.  Nice work :)
---
What‚Äôs the boxes in front of him towards the end?
---
The primary scammer's name was "Beauty Suzy" previously named "suzy reds", I wasn't able to grab the name of the Ancient Magicks individual, or the original person that advertised the drop party in the majority of the worlds at the GE. I reported the primary scammer as well when they were in the middle of trying to trick one of the groups (not sure if that will do anything, but it made me feel productive lol).
---
You do have a chance, ive been solo every tournament and last tourney i got to the 1v1s and was one of the 64 players left. Its not impossible you just gotta have a good strategy and play around the content that clans lock down.
---
Solo it and this doesn't happen. Don't even have to go for max points.
---
&gt;My father told me today, learn from the mistakes of people who take, or rather not, your advice.  
---

---
&gt;You'll never save them all, and some children must really touch the fire to understand it's hot.

---
That's really good advice! Thank you for sharing it. :)
---
I‚Äôm afraid that is not too quality censoring. Your 650 GP can be traced through the government‚Äôs FBI databases on level 3 of the kremlin in Africa. And then taken to the hacking overlords who will take your account. Gg

---
Do you know what a gutter is?
---
time to get next 70 agility,construction,farming,herblore,hunter,smithing,woodcutting,mining . Nothing is boostable in the incoming song of the elves quest.
---
I could keep playing the same 3 songs on guitar every day, it won't make me an amazing guitar player, that's what most people do with games.
---
terrible idea
---
I think both of those changes are fair. Will update this list as feedback is received :)
---
Why not imbuing the rings? 
---
not disagreeing with what youre saying. but str impacts dps ALOT more than accuracy, for almost all situations. your example doesn't make much sense even though i get what you are saying. Comparing accuracy to accuracy would be more relevant

Look if you are dumb enough to fall for these scams then you deserve to loose your stuff.

If you know the method and items I would suggest reporting it as a bug, using the ingame bug-report feature. 
---
If you don't know the items but do know the player(s) involved. I would recommend sending an email to tipoff@jagex.com with a brief explanation what happened, the exact time it happened and their names. That should get Jagex to investigate it... eventually.

*faints dramatically*

Do MM2 first. Keep your head cool on the platform, don't try to rush it. I managed to do it in 1 try! Remember that you will be reset to start if you get caught! Better be spending 30mins for 1 succesfull try than gambling on a 15min run.
---
As far as DS2 goes: Learn the different attacks the dragons do via YT. Zoom out all the way, so the whole battlefield (and artillery shots) are not out of view. Do not cheap out on gear: Use diamond bolt (e) and the bloodsucking ones (ruby e?)!

If you have any questions or want help, pm me your rsn so i can add you! Good Luck!

Gzzzz! 
---
My personal definition of best is comprised of two things. Does it make profit and is it cancer. If the answers are yes then no I like doing the thing :) 
---
The problem isn't MTX, MTX is just a symptom of predatory capitalism. You won't find any committees or inquiries being made into that, though.
---
Is this a scam? Guy at GE spamming "quitting rs, trade me for free dragon bones! please show your inventory so i know how many to give!" doesnt give any bones
---
Because he doesn't have them?
---
At the risk of sounding like a dick, I think it's up to you to make it unique and interesting enough for people to watch. As you say there are millions of ironman series on youtube so you need to find something that makes you stand out and I don't think anyone can tell you what that is, you need to find it yourself. Good luck.

If you have quest cape you can just use npc contact to repair pouches?
---
I still don't get why everyone assumes the player holds no blame. Like the companies are all at fault, but the player has no responsibility? Huh?
---
It's not at all obvious, because your first two comments are about moderation writ large, which isn't confined to offensive language.
---
This sentence from your second post seems unambiguous:
---
&gt;[TD is] not moderated at all, They ban all non conservative ideas but that doesn't make it moderated.
---
Maybe it's not your intention, but this sentence has only one meaning; banning content against the rules isn't necessarily moderation under your definition. That enables you to say things like "TD has no moderation," which is untrue. Maybe that's a different conversation than you set out on, but that's the position you take in your first two comments and it's impossible to construe it any other way.
---
If I were being a prick I'd say you're shifting goal-posts, but I wouldn't say that because this seems to just be a mutual misunderstanding. You're confining it to moderation of offensive language (which, btw, isn't explained by 'chat', as everything on a subreddit is inherently chat), which isn't what you wrote - but you've since clarified your intentions so we're fine.

It's probably not the Google bias; I've tried across multiple devices and browsers while in private mode. You're right that they probably haven't bought that keyword but you'd think community interest would drive the term up the search results. I play both RS3 and OSRS (RS3 mostly just because EZ GP means I can buy membership for OSRS) and it definitely feels like RS3 has run its course.
---
Even the video results for RS3 give Audi commercials. But if you look up BDO, Black Desert Online's official website is on the first page. And the recommended videos are all about the game. (Less competition for the initialism, sure, but it's also a less popular game).
---
Same, that's why I don't care that they did it even if it was just for him. It just allows him to do even more.
---
Nice, a spare pair for switches on Zulrah.
---
That wouldn't fix anything, you can always go and die in wildy to transfer your items from ironman to a regular account.
---
Incorrect. Irons benefit from the loot which otherwise most of it is a pain to get. 
---
How do you do this?
---
The problem wasn't about caps on trade.
---
It was that the cap on trade didn't really scale at all. Being a legit maxed account with all qp allowed you to trade 300k or so?

Get rigour. I'm not too sure differences between that and eagle eye though, I started vorkath with rigour and a dhcb. The added ranged attack bonus from both other items aren't that obvious for me after I upgraded to pegs. 
---
He broke rules that we all have to abide by and still gets to play the game and continue to make money from it.

Morals are also subjective. One persons morals might not be the same as anothers.

Worst case uninstall Runelite and reinstall, would reset it back to default settings and therefor fix whatever you tweaked.
---
In Tzhaar city, you can mine gold, forge into bars at the hot vents, then turn into gold bracelets, then high alch, It isn't particularly fast cash but you get mining, smithing, crafting and magic exp by the method. 
---
Agility pyramid is decent money, 200k/hour and earns decent agility exp at lower levels.
---
For me with any iron account (regular or uim) the best thing to do is to grind relatively high cb stats at sandcrabs (75-80) then do slayer.
---
Once you get 62 slayer you get wyrms which have good alchs, 70 you get kurasks, 72 skeletal wyverns, 75 gargoyles etc. etc.

As my grandma would say, it doesn't take you all day to do nothing.

Based on your comments you‚Äôve clearly never been funny yourself or had a funny friend who fucked with you and others.

Some people take everything so seriously.. care less what others say. Try it and I bet you end up liking most of them

OSRS feels more visually appealling to me.
---
RS3, even ui aside, is super cluttered. Ever since the dungeoneering update I feel their artists have had a massive disconnect with how the game is played; third person perspective almost birds eye view of the character. That new dungeoneering armor that became best in slot? Looked like static 99% of the time. That max cape that OSRS decided to carry over? Looks just like an orange team cape at a glance.
---
Idk; i've never been a fan of etching more and more tiny detail into things. I like the idea of color and shape being distinctive features.
---
RS3 to me genuinely looks and feels disgusting.

Tell to sleep on the couch til she pulls her head in

Weird combo, but ok

But I do Ranaar a for profit, are snapdragons decent profit aswell?
---
You had me at the first point. I seriously think the fact that clans held down certain objectives is sick as shit. If jamflex changed DMM even slightly every seasonal that's gonna mean new strategies have to be developed. It's a mmorpg, big clans that lock down sections of a game have forever existed and will continue to exist. Playing completely alone is a challenge you decide to take on, you know what you're getting into; the same concept applies to iron men. Clans will forever best a solo player, but being able to do well alone, even without winning, is an accomplishment itself

In fairness, there is a noticeable difference even moving around Windows with 144hz. At least there is for me and I think it looks way nicer so there is at least that. 
---
Personally still don't think it should be unlocked at all as its fairly easy to do for anyone wanting to win and its just time out of their day, and I don't necessarily think that you should just spawn with the spellbook that could win you 20,000 dollars, thats just my opinion though and whatever jagex decides ill be cool with and still play the tournament.

Yep exactly, and some people find scamming not morally gray because the people phished or scammed or hacked are dumb enough to get scammed

Why? Does it hurt your virgin eyes? Just an cartoon sitting.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I thought. He managed to unlock his slayer helm and several other useful slayer unlocks early on doing it his way, however by waiting until I have access to the Kourend master, I‚Äôve been able to maximize my points doing fewer, more difficult tasks, that pay really well. (Every 3-4 tasks has been Blue Dragons in Taverly.)
---
To further prove he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about, everywhere I read online says the slayer masters give you bonus points for EVERY xTH task, but he insisted it‚Äôs just the first time you reach those markers (10, 25, 100, etc.) I managed to have enough for a slayer helm in only 20 tasks using my method, which should‚Äôve been impossible based on what he was telling me (I was still pretty short on my 19th task, but the boost for 20 was enough to get me to 404.)
---
So yeah, clearly he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs actually talking about, and is just following a guide, or trying to convince me that HIS way is best, but for the way I play, I‚Äôve had no issues other than not being able to maintain a bond simply by grinding. Hell, i‚Äôm not even sure he‚Äôs able to, since his bank, despite being worth over 100M, is all expensive gear he‚Äôs using, same as me.
---
His benefit is having a job that pays decent and offers commission, whereas I‚Äôve been doing Rideshare, which pays well until you‚Äôre in an accident, then you‚Äôre screwed apparently regardless of who‚Äôs at fault.

Suggestion: can we have the ability to smash gold bars into gold dust then use that dust to make gold cannonballs. The dust can be made untradeable. The gold cannonball would be similar to the granite ones where the max hit is a little higher. 
---
This is fake news, it spawns a random rotation 
---
I'm dogshit in any game that is about multitasking, I can only concentrate on 1 thing at a time. Bosses are always about doing multiple things at once. Vorkath is nowhere near ez, he has so many damn attacks which all need some different action to counter which always throws me off. Best I've gotten him down was 80% and then needed to teleport, and that's just quest vorkath. Can't even imagine the post quest difficulty. 
---
So avoid the giant telegraphed attack? I kinda get your point but if you think wow involves any real skill your delusional. The only thing that makes wow hard is the brutal tuning of the bosses at release. Every single boss has mechanics so easy a baby could do it if it wasn't for the gear requirements. My retard guild clears mythic every tier once they gear up and no one one in it is a top player by any means.
---
The only thing that's hard in wow is going for world firsts.
---
&gt; they did a solid job at reviving OSRS and bringing it to mobile. That was a great move..
---
Yep, such a great move that even now Blizzard has jumped the bandwagon and is going to release Classic servers. Nostalgia = $

No its not considering op specified for standing still only. Which doesn't fall under "running / walking animation"

He got a couple after the kill but he ended stream soon after and not sure if those donations were the big amounts the people promised
---
Are they supposed to have fucking primordial boots or what
---
It's not tedious for the sake of tediousness. Teleports in OSRS are rewards. If you just gave lodestones to places that RS3 has, you destroy progression. Walking somewhere and clicking isnt the same thing as doing a quest. It isnt the same thing as getting a skillcape. It isnt the same thing as unlocking a difficult diary. It's trivializing the game for the sake of convenience which is against the mantra of OSRS design philosophy.
---
Why do you think fairy rings are such a big deal? They are basically lodestones but balanced. Unlocking staffless fairy rings is one of the best feelings one can get in OSRS and I cant explain it to you. I bet you're the kind of person who thinks dark souls is hard for the sake of being hard, completely missing the point.
---
If you want lodestones, they're already in the game. Train your magic level and get some law runes and you can go amywhere in the game.
---
Can definitely relate, I was multilogging 9 fishing accounts a day. Bought a bond with the gp, got a rl job and now I stop in to say hi to everyone else that's still there.

If PepsiCo or McDonalds are responsible for using deceptive labeling and advertising to get customers to consume large amounts of their products beyond a level that is clearly unhealthy, then I would say yes, and I think that is the intended point of the inquiry here.
---
Nice! Are you going to use it for that or sell it?
---
The only correct answer to this is whether or not you trust the source code and compile it from the source. Anything else is blind trust, and a lot of people will just outright say "yeah".

I thank you so much for that nice answer!

Keep up the agility training , maybe we see each other in some time even though I only started yesterday from 0.

What is the TIFU of this?

But anyways grats and im gonna learn bossing now too after getting an achievment cape today! was it hard killing zulrah??? I plan on doing zulrah and vorkath first, but need to grind out Void Equipment...
---
beyond world first you just do whatever DBM tells you to :)
---
tbh I'd rather see competitive cws as a seperate competitive mode, as for 1v1 I actually find that the most interesting/entertaining part. Especially when you can see the clicks.

You can put 20000 hours into something without being addicted to it.

Including higher rates it amounts to a whopping 1.3%

I dont understand how in your mind moving out of something is strictly harder than switching a prayer, its both just one action in response to one graphic.
---
Wow (lfr) is also a LOT more generous in how much time youre generally given to avoid said mechanic
---
I also saw you say that a big part of wows difficulty is optimizing dps and hps while doing mechanics, and i agree, but not at an LFR level. In LFR the damage checks are so low that you really dont have to be even close to optimal. And I dont think spamming frostbolt until ice lance lights up is harder than swapping between your inventory and prayers tab and clicking some things.

If you look hard enough you can find where the photoshop starts.

Doesn't have to be his review but it is satire.

By biggest issue is the addiction discussion. (I agree with MTX being gambling and predatory though) When it comes to addiction, the focus needs to stop being on the "drug" (in this case RS). If people really want to fight against addiction the focus needs to be on the causes of addictive behavior; depression, trauma, anxiety, etc. Videogames are an escape (Even pointed out during questioning) they aren't chemically addictive like, say, heroin. Even addiction to drugs is caused by the same trauma/mental health problems. Because that's what led someone to the drug to begin with. The idea that videogames themselves are addictive needs to end. It only hurts attempts to address the real problem.
---
Basically the latter.
---
This the one where you get booted while hopping worlds?
---
No
---
Wow has been dumbed down so much theres 5 abilities flashing on ur screen you press them and then you're doing competetive dps lol. If you were talking about PVP it'd be something else
---
i should start doing ZUlrah on my main (90 ranged, 77 magic)
---
96% of complains are dealth with - runescape is not an addictive game - Does not want to say how much paying users pay yearly - people only play 2.5 hours daily (sure!) - No gambling in the game? (fuck off). I call total bullshit on all of this. I'm inclined to send parliament a long letter regarding these topic this is just total bullshit.
---
Not really the passive effect of justiciar is what makes it worth it's price hence why the elysian is so high due to passive effect. If justiciar got offence bonus it would just shoot up in price and become best in the game. Imagine having best tank armour with decent offensive stats just too op bro

It took him over ten hours to get this one kill.

Could we be allowed to add salamanders to the menagerie? Those little guys are too cute, and they already have a walking animation.
---
It could be like the pet fish, where it's an easy pet to get but it can only be displayed in the menagerie and cannot be a follower, or it could be like the Herbi pet where there's a rare chance to get it while you're hunting that creature and it can also follow you.
---
Also, can we be able to put Eek in the menagerie? Similar to salamanders, you might be able to just take a regular small spider and turn it into a pet (but only inside the menagerie, not as a follower).

I can't remember exactly when it was brought into effect, but it was sometime in the past ~12 months.

lv 99 requires 13,034,431 xp
---
lv 92 requires 6,517,253 xp
---
aside from a 75xp difference, 92 is halfway to 99
---
Also, real math, 99/2 isn't 48.5. It's 49.5
---
I started recently by using Synq's guide to solo raiding from the getgo. I never could get myself started on the wedoraids discord or anything. I just decided to throw myself out there and learn it. My first raid took 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete, but after just a few raids it was reduced drastically. I currently have 56 KC (all solos) and probably average around 35 minute long raids now.
---
Just throw yourself out there and do it, it's honestly the best thing you can do. The motivation will come from simply improving and doing better all the time, and trust me, you will see improvement and it will be rapid.
---
It's probably daunting at first, and it will be frustrating until you get the it down, but when you get that first raid done it only becomes easier. 
---
What a coincidence I actually was wondering
---
That is how King Crimson works
---
i take the f if this is being troll: but at lvl 92 in runescape you have 	6,517,253 exp. and 99 is at 13,034,431 exp. so that's why 92 is half of 99.
---
A good clan to keep yourself alive another day and preventing the knife from slicing the wrists.
---
Lol, why would he say that? Also, WoW lets his clan do bug testing for the raids. So wouldnt that make him a professional? Lol
---
Don't forget the small (and niche) discord of Volcanic Mine. 
---
Honestly the best thing to come out of fortnite was this dance

100% rigour, youll be able to add an extra kill almost every single trip and its by far the most useful prayer for all end game content.  Priority is dhcb -&gt; rigour -&gt; DFW -&gt; pegs.  The first 3 will just help get more kills per trip and kills per hour.

From my understanding, jagex only sends messages though their own website. They do not send email for updates on account status. Sign in to their official website to see if there is an update, and do not click on any links in the email to get there.

Oh man dang. Luckily no PKers :-) your heart must have been pounding damn.
---
Yeah I played it safe too, because I was risking my black d'hide which I can't quite craft yet so I care about losing it. After every fight I used the royal seed pod to go back to a bank, duelling ring to Clan Wars portal, tele to POH, mounted glory back to Edgeville, lever to mage bank to submit the part. Took me longer than doing all three at once.
---
Also once I was in the mage bank I didn't just run out to the Wildy. I teled to POH, portal to Lumbridge, withdraw a bronze axe from RFD chest, cut down canoe, and go to Wildy that way with full inventory. This was so nobody would see me in Edgeville and think I was doing chinchompas or something (black d'hide). Surprised that I didn't see anyone since that area is near the rev caves too.

Oh good, so I just need to repeat every runecrafting I've ever done a little over 98 times and I'm there.

So 92 million is half of 99 million? Doesn't seem to add up buddy.

Maybe stop dying? Pets cost 1m to reclaim as well

I was under the impression that it wasn't the fact he couldn't do it because of his stats, but more that he couldn't do it as a personal twitch banter thing (Maybe I was ill informed of the whole situation, haven't managed to watch the whole thing) But I still believe he is one of those up there with the better side of PVM ability.

You don‚Äôt have to do any pvm to max an UIM. You just need free time. I‚Äôve raised with a maxed UIM that was dog shit at it 
---
You can use regular anti's to reset the vemom, 2 doses for full cure. 
---
It's how they get ya.
---
It's made that way so the game is less accessible for someone who's been an established member. You basically gotta buy members to play your account normally, now.
---
This is a bandaid, but it is far easier to implement than hunting all 3rd party sites. They have to double prong make the game less worthwhile to bot, and also make the gold more difficult to sell. 
---
yes.....i know this.....but thats not the joke......
---
It's a good point, but I think once you start talking about deceptive marketing you've started a new discussion that's no longer about how addictive a product may or may not be but have gone right into the realm of straight up fraud. 
---
It's just politics. Saying RS isn't addictive loses them nothing, nobody is gonna be able to prove RS is any more addictive than a pack of cards. Admitting it is addictive could have a host of unwanted consequences. It's the nail that sticks out that gets the hammer. 
---
Yeah that's exactly the way I do it right now haha, sometimes the hand just dies before I can set it up if the hits are just right.
---
Again, my first point is that if you want something focused on how well you pvp, then watch and support the PVP all stars.  Deadmanmode is interesting because these it not only shows their pvp skills, but also their resourcefulness throughout the week.
---
Yes, being resourceful includes joining a clan because being in a clan in almost any game is more advantageous than a solo player.  Clans have access to GWD because they're willing to dedicate resources to grinding that rather than something else.  
---
I understand your view, but at the end of the day you're asking for DMM to be something it's not.  You can push jagex to put more resources into PvP tourneys instead of DMM, which I can respect and would support as well, but at the end of the day this is what it is
---
He plays WoW and gets paid for it.
---
It would only work if it was permadeath. Which is something i think they should look in to. First day(or half day) of DMM is a protection state (So someone isn't rushing fire surge and one hitting half the world) rest is perma death. yes you can still technically swap stuff over but in doing so hurts your clan in multi
---

The real question is did he defeat zulrah or orgasm and put that over a clip of defeating zulrah?
---
Rule 34?
---
Would I be asking that specific question if I haven't?

It's 32,000 dollars. Clans will still pay to win the money. The reward prize isn't going anywhere

Find yourself the clue hunter set for free, and if you have below 18 health you only get hit for 1's.

Fill half your inventory with cakes or wines and go at it.

Fetching = points for drops (another roll every 500)

just.. no.

It gives significantly better range and melee defence bonuses than Armadyl's chest plate, which was my point.

Hey man this is awesome, I‚Äôm not quite at the requirements but glad you‚Äôre promoting this.
---
&gt;It is up to the players to decide what they want to do.
---
I think this is a perfectly valid response.  
---
The problem is on the users end here. If people have the disposable income to gamble and buy cosmetics, they should be allowed to do so. Because some people are unable and unwilling to sort their shit out, doesn't mean the rest of us should be held back by it.
---
I'd support any amount of opt in gambling/addiction help services. But if they can't or won't help themselves, that is their problem, not the rest of the worlds, and not Jagex's. We need to start treating it that way.
---
You probably shout Chop Chop! at WT yourself, regardless if you have a Daxe or not! Because the peer pressure from everybody else is to much for your no backbone kinda ass!
---
It made sense in like 2002 when those were some of the best items in game... now not at all
---
The moonraker
---
I got sudden flashbacks when he discussed/argued about 3-tick manipulation for 1-2 hours straight
---
You can also wait till he did a special (thunder/portal/spikes) and count. 
---
His cycle is 
---
1. attack
---
2. do nothing
---
3. attack
---
4. special
---
repeat
---
if you wait till he does a special, attack and then do nothing you can run to the middle safespot so he moves his head there and you're in the 4:1 cycle. It's a bit tricky because you need to know when he will move his head to the middle as you need to run as soon as he moves his head not once he moves it. 
---
Based off your stats, should definitely train a bit up first. Raiding may be fun, but doing it with 70s combat stats will make it a lot harder on everyone involved.

Wasnt this in rs3 for a short time?
---
I used to lay flat in my belly with my laptop where my pillow should be with my pillow right behind it, if I heard my rents I would shut my laptop which put my pillow in perfect sleeping position, never got caught 
---
i mean the characters in rs3 look fucking goofy and out of place, as do most things in that game. if they fixed those ABSOLUTELY GODAWFUL models then maybe, but until then osrs is unironically light years ahead. at least it actually looks and feels like runescape and not some run-of-the-mill rpg.
---
Good for you!
---
My first thought as well. Maryland is too much man. 
---
If you're done with it then mom says it's my turn on the vulva
---
Unless they decide that it‚Äôs not worth their time when they‚Äôre essentially on the same level as everyone else. Or maybe they will still have their members participate but not as large groups like we‚Äôre currently seeing. RoT is a big clan and even they stepped away from DMM because they felt like it wasn‚Äôt worth it for them to run as a clan, so I don‚Äôt think the prize money is enough to keep clans if you make the experience of playing DMM horrible for them.
---
The PvP allstars tourney didn't even include some of the best pkers. and Mammal was there for god sakes.   
---
Like that was a publicity stunt. It also didn't do that well overall. DMM would do well but you have to limit the clan mode so that your best content creators can go far.  
---
Torvesta will probably always be our best shot a solo player winning, and he got into a 1v1 vs a guy with the above stuff and caught 0 freezes and still almost won the fight.  
---
The worse player won because he was gifted an ACB by his team. In the end its about what brings in the most viewers, and having content creators like B0aty and Sick Nerd decide to play because they can win are what this game mode needs
---
He fucks iraq pussy
---
He‚Äôs george W Bush
---

Hey thanks =)
---
No you need twisted bow for green phase,  kodai wand for blue phase and dragon scimitar for red phase.
---
this is why I hate reddit
---
Most irons still do the 3 tbow grild before zulrah but its still possible, Some high level guys are developing a 2 tbow keris switch which mught be the new meta. I'll believe it when I see it though
---
At the options screen, hold L1 + R1 and press Circle(2), Triangle, Square. If you entered the code correctly, you will hear the sound of a horn. 
---
You say that but it took this man like 10 hours to do one zulrah kill
---
Scorpia
---
Not a bad idea. I‚Äôd make it available in all worlds not just pvp, or suggest making it take money from the coffee used to pay your Butler.
---
You log the alt out after every trade and don't let it get scouted - also don't put too much on the alt lol. It didn't die once in all the levels I was there for
---
it's called luck u cro magnon 
---
Sorry I meant kill two and leave one, I‚Äôve edited it since 
---
Shaq put it in me
---
And Wow
---
If it's winning you fights and isn't some crazy "nettle tea" stacking thing that has the trade off of healing less per inventory spot, I would doubt it's intentional.
---
There's not a lot of leeway in the PvP meta for stuff like this, and that's by design.
---
A new BiS healing mechanic would mess with the PvP meta significantly.
---
you get immediately revenomed
---
Rs is addictive as long as its better than your irl. It just happens rs is a very good game, not just meaningless action and fun.

At work dreaming about finishing my quest grind for b gloves, I'm so close!

"10am" doesn't really mean anything when people all over the world play this game
---
Mrs. Obwana get down!

He can‚Äôt until 30. 
---
GL with next grind 
---
He cashed out what was probably a few thousand dollars, some people would kill for that.
---
I'd love to go for a Quest or Diary cape. Huge challenge but at the same time I feel like it's a more satisfying grind than 99 capes because of all the perks you can unlock along the way.
---
What the fuck are they making now? Are they really still making shit? Didn‚Äôt they JUST release a statement that they‚Äôd focus more on existing content!?
---
It‚Äôs a shame the serene redemption arc was going so well too
---
Seems you‚Äôre talking about melee. Majority of slay tasks should be done barraging now (I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre asking about the efficient meta as opposed to casual slayer). Because barrage is meta, kodai is 100% the main weapon and the best weapon to have for slayer.
---
However if you‚Äôre talking about casual melee slayer, the other commenter is right. Rapier is the best but abyssal whip is second best. If you‚Äôre interested in training strength but can‚Äôt afford a rapier, then abyssal bludgeon, abyssal dagger, and saradomin sword are the next best options in that order.
---
This is assuming you don‚Äôt want to use a degradable item like the tentacle whip or the saradomin‚Äôs blessed sword, which would both be better than the bludgeon but I‚Äôm unsure how they compare to the rapier. Dragon hunter lance is only good for dragon tasks which you should not be doing if efficient slaying, but relevant tasks may include Vorkath for blue dragons, wyrms, drakes, wyverns, black dragons
---
All this ranking of melee weapons can be fact checked using Bitterkoekje‚Äôs DPS calculator. Put in your stats, gear, and any pots/prays you would use and choose the weapon that gives higher DPS
---
Does detract from blaming OP for editting
---
I mean it can still happen, just very difficult. 
---
Agreed.  They could lock mimics behind a miniquest in order to make people who don't want to fight it never unlock it, but adds an extra risk to clues.  But this is ezscape where nobody dies, so it's unrealistic to expect anything
---
Doing a similar assignment here at UCI, my task is to find a system that has flaws or missing features and propose changes to it, and of course I chose Jagex customer support. I definitely like the idea of being able to chat with a representative, you get helped instantly and it feels like you are being helped directly, plus you can ask any other questions that arise without having to submit another ticket and waiting days for a response.
---
It's a healing mechanic that consumes special attack 
---
It‚Äôs a joke poking at a recent Ironman who had 3 tbows. Brought all 3 to zulrah ‚Äúfor a joke‚Äù and conveniently got ‚Äòhacked‚Äô and they stole his 3 tbows and 120k rune arrows but left his hc status. 
---
Translation: He RWT‚Äôed the items and did a poor job coming up with an excuse.
---
They just need to change the name. If thats the way it has to work thats totally fine, but it needs a new name. 
---
Have you done all the quests that give early herblore xp? You can get 10k or so even before 30. You can also do Easy achievement diaries for 2500 xp lamps. 
---
It would require a lobby cuz otherwise what happens if you log in within the wildy. You could be killed before typing in your pin. 
---
Can't they just pick up pet and drop all their items to protect the pet?
---
Ah mb, yeah I remember when it came out I thought this too, doubt it will though bro
---
Childhood memories...ruined.
---
Might be wrong, but I've heard they changed scaling, so a 115 isn't a must have anymore
---
Congrats, your clothes have been put back in your inventory and you  are now listed as a sex offender
---
He is talking about the repair stand for items that go into broken for after pvp death.
---
Example: Void, fire cape, torso.
---
The danger is that you pull out your 100m cashtack, missclick the repair stand, and get dclawed to death. It sounds like a redarded mistake but 2 squares from repair stand is the dangerous area.
---
Its simple to avoid. (Just take out like 500k you never need more, and don't missclick).
---
Can confirm
---
Except over long term of farming a boss the average is all that matters. Luck isn't really a thing...
---
So if you calculate the cost of x kills, and factor in the chance of getting a shard in those x kills divided by the cost of the shard and that comes out to profit good. I'm aware that scorpia is technically profitable, I'm just saying "if you are lucky" is a bad reasoning to do a boss.. For example I got 3 rapiers in 4 kc at tob last night but I'd never plan for that. 
---
The war in iraq pretty much should never happen
---
Im surprised  We didn‚Äôt end it sooner
---
Technically what he said is still true  
---
What about Nieves Labia
---
&gt; The mainstream doesn't care as much about mtx as they cared about violence and mature content back in the 90s.
---
Well, no shit lol. Those people though video games were creating mass murderers. MTX at its base form is just online shopping, where you get a digital item instead of a physical one.
---
"But it can be gambling!", firstly no, what RS3 has is no more gambling than kinder eggs are. Secondly, all those people know casinos exist, and don't have an issue with those. Even a slight look into it could tell them that online casinos exist, and they don't care about those either.
---
So why do gamers actually care about MTX? Because they "ruin game integrity". And no one outside of gaming gives a shit about that, because it's not a real problem. If you don't like MTX that strongly, play a game without it.
---
I only made it to Rex before I climaxed 
---
upvoted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :pogchamp:
---
as long as saying "RuneScape is not addictive" do not increase membership with gambling tax I am OK with it.
---
That or a 19m alternative
---
Thanks for the in-depth response. I did my skills in the wrong order so ended up getting much higher combat than slayer, currently going from 1 to 70 for MM2. Not ready to go for efficient slayer yet but I appreciate the tips 
---
Yea, clues are currently in the game if you weren't aware.
---
Supreme is wearing an archer's ring. What an adorable little detail!
---
No wonder they added a Twisted Bow spawn
---
I like all the ideas that give the season a reason. Currently it feels so pointless.
---
Hence Reddit shouldn't take the speedrun this serious.
---
&gt;Also not every e-mails demand phone confirmation for login
---
True, I don't have a phone confirmation on nothing online. It is annoying and I'm not giving my phone number away on the internet no anyone. Also I don't see why you bring this up? It isn't required at all, just another extra step for security if someone logins from another IP.
---
&gt;If someone gets their password cracked with brute-force method or any other reason, the 2-factor won't really do squat.
---
You're correct on this but... Once again, is Jagex really responsible for their users choosing poor passwords that can be brute forced? 
---
&gt; Jagex not requiring authenticator to log in to homepage account is undeniably imperfect.
---
To some extend yes. But that is only if the hacker has login password and e-mail. At that point you already have to ask yourself questions on how the hacker is able to simply get your login data.
---
But then again, as long as you're not dumb enough to use the same password for the e-mail they can't do much harm besides maybe getting a forum ban.
---
To this day, I still have to meet someone who has been hacked and had an unique e-mail (with unique password and 2FA) and password for their Runescape account. Everything else I've seen narrows down to the user not securing their data online. And everyone on Reddit who claims otherwise can't provide me a decent case because all of them get either smacked by Jmods or simply have their fucking person information online for the taking.
---
I've put my trust in Jagex security measures and advice rather then some randoms online complaining and I guess it helped since I never got hacked once.
---
he just wants to kill dragons! why the fuck mage in wilderness no leave alone?

Truely remarkable sight.

You can literally buy them from the Grand Exchange. [Tier 1]

BCP is the only thing better, but your money is vastly well spent elsewhere considering how easy the fighter torso is to get .

I do fruit tree and special tree (redwood, hardwoods, calquat) runs mainly, and then sometimes herb+watermelon runs. And every once in a while regular tree runs too. I don't try to find an optimal invent setup or anything to do them all in a row, if I do regular tree runs I bank and have a separate invent for them. 
---
For fruit runs I have 5 trees and payment, 1 calquat and payment and tai bwo tele, spade and rake, house teles, gp. 
---
If I add herb/melon runs to it, add herb seeds, melon seeds, dibber, and tele methods (ardy cloak, lumby ring, ecto, etc). Then I do tree stuff first to clear up invent.
---
If I add regular tree runs, I finish the last stuff, bank, then grab trees, payment or ultracompost, and various teles.
---
I don't bother with making my own compost, or worry about maximizing herb profits. I mainly do it for bonus farming xp and do it when I don't have time to pvm or whatever else
---
Chop chop if your gay

They need to make the casket helmet a drop from this boss

That looks so cartoony. It's awful... Looks like they are trying to do retail WoW graphics in OSRS

well if they had said it is addictive

they gonna be raising taxes fucking regulations play hours limit
---
remind you uk already starting to ban porn
---
so jagex is doing us a great favor saying it is not addictive
---
rs3 graphics are kinda bland
---
Honestly, I'd completely wipe the hard drive and set the pc up from scratch there's really no knowing what kind of trash someone had hidden on their system outside of their knowledge. Try running malwarebytes too.
---
Since you're not a hardcore you could start by spam pickpocketing men in lumbridge to get a little starter cash. There are lots of good ironman guides and series out there!
---
&gt;the delay isn't really needed unless you literally give ur phone access to the hacker, which would be impressive to say the least
---
Oh darn my phone got stolen guess I still dont see a counterpoint for a delay?
---
Yeah but it resets the venom dmg. So you take like up to 8-10 dmg, then you take a sip to reset it back to 6.
---
ill toss in 100k

Ive been in there for months, not shitting on your cc btw. Still visit atleast once every 2 weeks if things have changed for the better.

Some friends and randoms joined over time. People were calling someone a retard if they said something wrong regarding xp/method/playstyle.  They weren‚Äôt joking either. A guy was asking questions and some others jumped on him for ‚Äúbeing an idiot‚Äù and a ‚Äúretard.‚Äù 
---
Lots of questions that cant be looked up easily get ignored. 
---
Ranks act superior to non ranks.
---
When giving advice you get flamed if its not best xp/h method etc.
---
This is not my personal opinion but of many im who left the cc.
---
Sorry you had to endure that for so long. 
---
And WHERE are your alch‚Äôs bwana?
---
You don't seem to understand how boss mechanics work. In order to kill the scorpian at Vorkath you have to successfully cast a crumble undead spell. Because the spell is not successful the game doesn't even check what spell was originally cast because *it wasn't successful*. The solution you're talking about is nonsense.
---
Make sure you have 2fa on your email addresses as well
---
I see it in the news post, yes. They will either make it or they won't. They weren't polled explicitly, just as part of an expansion, so it seems entirely possible to me they just won't make it. Has happened before and will happen again, I'm sure. 
---
I did 77-99 didn‚Äôt die once and would bring 500 bones per trip. Ely and arma helped i guess.

Surely the dad should be called Nieve's Ass, not the child?

But you‚Äôre our idiot 
---
Yeah some places look incredible in rs3! Like the legate caverns or tardidad. The jarring differences in art and quality is shit tho. Osrs is just so consistent and pleasing.
---
I would agree, but the willingness to do so could lead to a compromise   of cutting away and development. 
---
In its current state zeah feels like a rushed final school project that didint get enough time. 
---
Not to mention some of the decisions there really corner them in terms of content. 
---
Think shedding the fat and re releasing small batch handcrafted experiences like in the rest of rs would be better.
---
Looks great!

So expand the current team?

I was talking about LoL.

Normally its the chinner saying that while you kill him.

It‚Äôs not really crashing if there‚Äôs 15 monsters in an area and somebody is only killing 1 at a time. It‚Äôs taking advantage of wasted space

I don't stay at a low heartrate.  And to get it out of the way, it's a stationary bike.  I've been biking upwards of 6 miles a day and jogging three  for close to four years.  It doesn't take much to push out a hard workout. In fact, it's easier since I just zone out.  In between matches I adjust my speeds if need to.  
---
Also, let's say I was overweight and lacked muscle.   Even staying at a low heartrate that would be more beneficial than  nothing.

It is to my understanding. Don‚Äôt know what OP has

I just do the ectofunctus from morytania diaries, no risk and pretty much afk braindead for better rates than house altar (although limited in xp per day).

Wintertod helps with farming aswell. Gives good loot for it.

Going for "world first" Mythic difficulty in a new raid is much harder than the Inferno.

Well yes, he's playing a game with risks, and some activities have higher risks (and rewards) than others.  Should we blame Zulrah every time someone dies to her?

Definitely not if you use an alt to mule, house would only be marginally faster if at all

how many lines did you do before writing this?

Runescape was like a better poptropica when I started to play it was like oh I am playing the first game in my life with other actual people you know? That was the draw for me at first then that has worn off and now I hardly play due to the community being about getting that exp.

Hey, good on you.  Video game addiction is to real and serious. It doesn't get a lot of credit. I was also addicted to wow and black desert online.  My wife ended up taking me for a vacation with no electronics and it reset my life.i felt like.  Games were just, boring and not my interest.   I play osrs mainly when putting the kids to sleep or biking.    But honestly, good for you. 
---
Got it before getting trident of seas m8 :), fire waves with tome. not recommended.
---
I think it looks cool. I didnt realize it would be so big, but I'm ok with that. 
---
No chance for TL:DR ?
---
asking the real question
---
Why would they log him off on stream? 
---
They could limit the amount of certain items that new accounts can trade or sell. Combined with removing drop trading for these new accounts it would limit the amount they can offload per day and so the bots would have to be around for much longer to be able to make any sort of money. 
---
Yeah I think it was closer to like 280m he was saying.  And he was a uim.
---
He was only banned for a week and got unbanned a week ago or so.
---
The official client is fine as it is, theres very few things I would want added.
---
Being able to choose an activity?

Jagex needs to hire or promote artists that want to keep osrs style integral to the game, rather than evolving it. Also who understand the games color palette. 
---
We don‚Äôt need more mod ghosts. 
---
Thanks, I'll follow that sub. Didn't know about it.
---
Chaos is faster because it make your inventory hold 16 more bones. And unnoting them is just as close. 
---
I don't think Jagex will hire people to work on osrs that don't know Java
---
Having to gear up for a fight that probably isn't going to happen would get tedious real fast. 
---
Don't kink shame her.
---
A nice start up is really to get members asap. After that get started on doing a few quests. I personally rushed the gnome quests and waterfall for some combat stats, also allowing you to safespot fire giants for a rune scimmy.
---
After that I did the quests to unlock 'HAM store rooms'. These give alot of jewelry you can enchant for teleports or sell for gp. The guards also give easy clues while pickpocketing, these can give some more direction to your low level progression.
---
This definetely isn't the most efficient route, but I found it really enjoyable.
---
&gt; I think maybe guilds exploiting mythic helya on release had their gear removed too but I'm not 100% on that.
---
Pretty sure loot did get removed.
---
Why did you kill Giant Mole 20,000 times? Why?
---
Are you asking if it's doable?  If so then yes it would be quite easy on mobile.  Lighting redwoods when you get to 90 would also be an option when you get there.

when it asks if it's RWT related just click the 'no' button idiot

What the fuck is inside of a clue casket supposed to look like then? It looks perfectly acceptable for what it is.
---
Just put it in a way that its left click and right click at the same position on resizable. (Between inv and chatbox). 
---
Then you need no mousekeys to jump down.
---
I am all ears to content that allows a more level playing field between players of different skill levels.
---
There was mention earlier of an ELO system. So if we were to go down the periodic 1v1 tournament route then you could have separate tournament for specific ELO ranges, with varying levels of reward - with higher brackets giving better rewards.
---
sucks to suck
---
In those 200,000 hours playing casually you could get 200m all on UIM plus fill the whole collection log (every pet, every very rare item like tbow etc.)

Me looking at people who talk shit but have less karma. 
---
Generally less pkers in the high risk / pvp worlds I've noticed
---
I just use addy darts for everything

Osrs has too many clowns that worship this dude and his boring ass content. Anything that doesn't look like a swamp to out of place for them.

I read on the wiki that infernal axes degrade into an 'uncharged' infernal axe after burning 5000 logs and can be recharged with a smouldering stone or a dragon axe.
---
Is that information accurate? Can I recharge it by using a dragon axe on it? So the smouldering stone is never wasted?
---
US is good. 
---
not even max scales pretty bad imo.
---
How do you unote the bones?
---
Clue caskets don't only contain coins you absolute idiot. There can be piles of armor, books, clothes, runes, weapons etc. This shit looks absolutely ridiculous. Mod ghost should go to rs3 team
---
One may be the auto mod comment and flair. 
---
you can use addy for everything and its cost efficient, unless you make a ton of money per hour doing very efficient raids, or don't care about profit and want to prioritize pet rolls/hr
---
"Very cheap" varies between users. It cost 16m to go from 75 to 90 just for redwoods. Then you have another 6m for 99. 22m is a decent chunk for any people.
---
What amulet are you talking about?
---
It looks like kingdom hearts tbh.
---
he rwt'd, anyone who thinks otherwise is so stupid. Why is he still hc? the story is so bogus. What a fucking loser
---
Do quests that unlock important gear or things. A great start is barrows gloves, helm of nez, proselyte, and throne of miscellania. 
---
Saying how it's easy and not hard at all. 
---
its not 5x the price, when using  addy/mith darts your costs per shot are almost all scales
---
What would be the differemce between the main and iron one ?
---
The servers freeze and nothing happens when lag is from jagex, if vork was able to kill you while frozen it was your internet.
---
for the pet.. that is the whole point of this post
---
They obviously need to add more visible fire lighters. 
---
Thatll cost you a lot more than 1 mill.

Did they take out dicing because they saw this exact thing happening down the line? I mean it use to be a huge thing that and flowers.

Spending 200 hours to get 99 was maybe considered near impossible in runescape classic and 99 slayer in 2005

There's a guy outside the altar that unnotes for you for 50 gp per bone

Yeah, I would imagine if they were to do this, your first couple of days would be people grinding out slayer monsters to get whips/gmauls/ etc, and everyone would have access. As a solo player, this would allow you to do your skilling training during seasonals, so during the tournament week you would just have to collect your supplies. This doesn't really "devalue" the tournament week in my opinion, but I think everyone will feel less pressured to just only grind stats all week, and to do other things as well.  Maybe more strategies similar to the clans that locked down piety this past tournament would appear, and maybe also allow content creators to release some videos rather than grind melee for 20 hours a day.
---
Or just splash instead of cheating
---
clan chats ranked people

"bh and chill" or "emblem area" are 2 that i know of.
---
He‚Äôs killed zulrah thousands of times on his main uim I‚Äôm sure his opinion would be helpful

I see more harm than good coming from this. We'll  just end up trading "jagex how tf did I get hacked posts" for "I got hacked and then they disabled account recovery, ty for customer support jamflex"
---
Not saying Jagex has no room to improve where account security is concerned, but the primary responsibility falls on the account owner, not the company. Judging by how many "I got hacked wtf" posts end up admitting that they thought the bank PIN was too inconvenient to set up, or they didn't have 2FA for whatever reason, or they account shared just one or two or five times, I don't see a permanent lock on the recovery system as an ideal solution. One person falls for a phishing link, hijacker locks account recovery, and then you're out of luck...until the inevitable wave of Reddit posts complaining about account security and the broken system.
---
Also, I could be wrong, but if I recall, Jmods have said that most account hijackings don't happen through the recovery system. 
---
How many hours would you reckon splashing from  69-94 mage ?
---
Talked to an iron man catching imps, he had completed thousands of medium clues and never got rangers
---
Its not like hot/cold master clue, cabbage mage or ancient ambush. You KNOW it‚Äôll appear. Now hopping out of graceful every time just in case is gonna suck
---
I had this exact same lag while on mobile just after 10am this morning.  I was in the GE at the time.  It happened around 3 or 4 times before I logged off.
---
If most people are adults, they should be responsible for their actions. You can't baby everyone because there are people with issues. People with issues need to get help, whether its by themselves or with the help of friends/family. Its not on Jagex to do that. The same way you can't hold Budweiser accountable for alcohol abuse. Whatever product you release, there will always be some people that give it too much room in their life. That being said, some proper customer support could help prevent mental health issues  **ü¶Ä** 11$ **ü¶Ä**

Perhaps toxic and abusive are too big a words, but mean is too weak.  Somewhere in between then. Definitely a warranted mute though imo.

My point is that if you don‚Äôt want to use a cannon for some reason and don‚Äôt want to be interrupted by cannons, don‚Äôt go to a cannon spot. Go to places like the catacombs where they aren‚Äôt allowrd

Should have been a bigger priority. This shit was so annoying.

Damn, you've discovered my secret.

Isn't a humble brag more like someone saying something like "I hate being so attractive, I get hit on by creeps all the time"? I could be wrong, but that's how I've always heard it used.
---
Regular cactus has a much higher pet chance
---
This is 2007scape but even that idea is too acoustic for me. Making having an alt for babysitter duty meta so you don't lose tons of work is too much.
---
This very much sounds like rule breaking

People are downvoting you but they don't quite understand where simplicity works.
---
ah yea of course, lemme just help you with blatant cheating.

I was skimming comments and thought you were saying you have big hands and you suck dick
---
no?
---
I get that, but i dont get the point of having an option to make it permanent if you can just ask support to de-iron
---
skull forts, skeleton fleets, kraken hunting, megalodon hunting, skelley ship hunting, pvp, cargo runs, literally anything in the new map area. You were saying?
---
That‚Äôs my experience with Jad as well.
---
ikr? fucking massive ego, flexing an old record made by a normal account, on a thread admiring how a WoW pro who never played OSRS seriously, and plays mostly without guides, killed zulrah on an ironman with garbage gear and dying several times but never giving up.
---
because if you're in bad gear and not using a cannon i have already found an empty world

On the bright side you could get 99 prayer with that loot.

Remember that these are only in elite and master clues, which already have very strong encounters in them. Plus, by the nature of clues, chances are you're already doing something that requires you to have banked before, like slayer for instance. Not like you're carrying a spade on you on a task. You're teleporting all over the place and potentially buying the equips you need for emote clues, or at least pulling them out of your bank, unless you have literally every single stash unit filled (and can afford to on top of that, remember how expensive the items in the master clues are). 
---

Yeah haha idk if I was just bad but being in TS with Random‚Äôs and barely making it through was always soo intense. Especially with how easy it was to wipe.

He drop traded it?

It's used often when you need the crush bonus, but it's significantly worse than a fire cape
---
Okay so the other day I was on fairly late (2 am my timezone) and thought I‚Äôd be safe to do some wilderness bosses on a 200 people world. Ended up getting pked for the first time ever while bossing.

it's not morally right to only let half of the dmm finalists play their 1v1s for the chance to win 32,000$ because you can't do beta testing for shit
---
No, they are not meant to test out new gear always. That was the case a couple of times, but not originally. Originally, they were meant for people to practice pking in terms of builds and gear that they didn't already have. Soon enough, they turned into unrestricted worlds, which I think was a mistake. Having a permanent couple of tournament (pvp only) worlds would be nice.

Nobody buys magic roots because nobody needs them, the source of antidote++ comes from noted drops at zulrah, kraken, Corp, and venenatis.

No I actually do mean what I said. I'm attempting the fight caves using toxic from the serpentine helm/iron spear combo and the ring of suffering to attempt it.

Antitode++ drop noted from Kraken which is a super farmed boss. It's a lot more reasonable to get them there than it is to make them yourself.
---
Eh, wintertodt is chill I need 75 fletching for msb on my uim.   So I'll get a lot of experience and near 75 since I started at 52 fletching on my way to 99.

strong encounters? all i bring for an elite gear wise is a blowpipe, and i just pray for 10 seconds while i murder the guard. masters are another story

But some people can't just put it down. Not everyone who tries gambling gets addicted either. It's just a few but it's very detrimental to those few. And video games work exactly like gambling with the exact same mechanisms.

How long do stat draining special attacks (DWH, BGS, Arclight, etc.) last on a target? I notice that when I use them on Sire, for example, Runelite tells me that I have landed 2 specs at first but then eventually its not there anymore. Curious if it lasts for the duration of the fight or if there's a cap.
---
Now you're just making crap up lol
---
This is a really nice piece

What are the death mechanics in the wildy for noted items? E.g. if I had an alt with 1k dragon bones and 50,000 gp what happens upon death? I am assuming the single noted stack doesn't count as one item? Having a hard time finding anything in the wiki.
---
&gt;I willingly took someone‚Äôs spot and then was surprised when they reacted

the complaints are it's not what the people complaining want, so they complain about it.

Nope, notifications can't get you banned. it's an afk idler.

Not quite. I've recently identified this specimen as indigenous to the tundra of Northern Jatizso.

Find a good time where not a lot of people are on, total level worlds, walk instead of running therefore you have more time to log out if you see someone. Oh and

either you dont understand pvp at all or you are trolling at this point
---
exploiting a game mechanic = "just kill them lul" ?
---
you CANT kill someone who wont go below 100% hp lmao take away the heal other mechanic and we would LITERALLY steam roll them all no problem.
---
a game mechanic deemed to broken to be used in pvp worlds is the only reason they can keep their world in the wilderness, not skill- not numbers an exploit.
---
genuinely dont understand how u dont get it lol
---
Put the mouse down! We just want to talk! 
---
Fuck wildy master steps. Can‚Äôt stand those 3 bitches
---
You'll keep 3 noted dragon bones on death and lose everything else - I kept only 1k bones on my alt max at any given time just in case
---
Gotcha bitch! 
---
Yep, fucked up, sorry that I made you check your inbox.
---
They said the mimic is going to be easy to shred through anyways. And just IMO, the trio ambush can be really difficult if you're not prepared for it either, so I don't see any difference between if the mimic was unexpected and having to fight that trio.
---
Switch to dragon ASAP.
---
Yup. Pretty sure konar is 18 per task and 90 for every 10th
---
Claws wouldn‚Äôt last long either they are stronger than defender which make defender worthless before whip or they are wearing making the update pointless

Most don't know what they are talking about in regards to balancing content properly. Just making reactionary claims.

Doing clues in graceful is inefficient anyways, especially for the level of clue where you'll get mimics since you can be pulled into deep wildy.

No, it doesnt show buy limit. That is something displayed by the application you are running.

5 or 6 years ago I was perm muted for repeated harrassment of a player moderator and about a year ago I was sent a message in my inbox offering me a "last chance" appeal where they basically said they'll remove the mute but if i get another one I'll just be banned.

Thanks and as far as I can tell I'm immortal
---
context ?
---
You kinda are being a piece of shit by crashing. Doesn't excuse his response though
---
It definitely is. There's no need to use an alt. Just bring half and inve of brews food ect, and wear a bulwark and high magic defense gear. I did this bringing 300-400 bones at a time till 99 prayer. And I never got close to dying once
---
Wow you are so funny ans epic
---
How do you heal someone on osrs?
---
$6/month. Heh 
---
[H]
---
Because flair rules
---
Ouch that'd be a bad day. I'm surprised that doesn't pop up for "death mechanics" or "items kept on death" wiki pages.
---
Death mechanics are so different from back in 2007 days. I saw a guy die at metal dragons a few weeks ago and camped out his spot for like 10 minutes and was pissed when he mosey-d on back and regeared up to keep killing and I got nothing lol.
---
Completely missed that fact. thanks!
---
Rofl you think that getting revenomed lowers the damage? lmfao
---
Not sure if it is possible to unimbue stuff, but they could always just kill you in the wild for it and get it back that way.
---
This is so god damn funny and painfully relatable. Literally had to switch to Ironman because I couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation of a quick 5m which always lead to losing hundreds. Finally was able to quit gambling altogether but it took a long time and some professional help. 
---
That was me for ages
---
DELOOOOOOORES!!!!!!
---
the healers are 126, if we brought 126 the healers are 90s we would need 50 people to dedicate 20 hours a day to hitting the back; no one dying and a total waste of time.... or? remove heal other from wilderness like they did in pvp worlds so we can fight like men, not exploit like the rats ROT are

Put me in the screenshot but add authenticator delay.

There are like 6 or 7 places uim can do it already but yes making it so if you die to mimic you lose your stuff is the right answer.

Didn't you know? Everybody on this sub is an expert on visual art and  game design.

Aww guthans is so cute

So... maybe they should hire more Java devs? Except they can't, because competent Java devs expect and receive a good salary whereas Jagex isn't willing to pay that.
---
I got some bad news for ya chief... Imma need you to fact check.
---
It's not about how I do specifically, but about the contrast of possible benefit between film/tv and that of gaming as a media. RuneScape is often a repetitive grindfest while at least with film and TV theres more "new" content to engage with and depending on which content you decide to engage with can be a quite positive experience. The time spent playing RuneScape vs the time spent on another activity doesn't equal the same amount of time wasted depending on how you use it since in RS it literally doesn't change for dozens and dozens of hours of grind which just is not good for your mental health.

No neives ass was asking why a different troll was named ‚Äúmy arm‚Äù

Then he asked what about me in which then the father addresses him by his Guthix given name

Yes. The server runs in spite of people accessing it.

You must be quite fucking stupid to think I am trolling.

Sweet so they're just reusing old graphics to rush more updates that will probably have giant game-breaking bugs. Like usual.
---
Support spells (heal/veng/spec xfer ) working in multi is how theyre intended to work. You aren't in singles. Support spell spam in singles was patched because that was OP.
---
As for teams holding rev worlds, that's how revs were designed, no? The ideal rev scenario is groups of people holding worlds and pvming in them. 
---
Raids is cool but fam ain't always down and then it's either solo raids or vork and you know which one it really is
---
You only want it buffed so you can make profit 
---
Actually, if they hire competent Java developers (if they were willing to pay decent wages for said Java developers) then it would solve a lot of problems.
---
It was closer to 200$ iirc but yeah. I honestly didnt mind since I won most of the cash from gambling on a family vacation
---
Kebos has loads of unique assets though. Which is what makes it fit OSRS, Zeah's was that everything looked the same.
---
&gt; he was largely figuring Zulrah out by himself with the occasional pointer from chat
---
I took this to mean that you thought he was a first-timer that somehow managed to figure it all out by himself. I'm not saying it isn't impressive, just that after that much experience the rotations should be burned into your head.
---
Fuck dude, you're making me want to play again. I don't think I can juggle OSRS and Eve though

to 43 on my iron i used no tele, just walked back and forth from the bone yard. later on you can use burning ammy, but i prefer to just run from edgeville along the western cliffs, dont see any pkers there. I would bring 2 inventories of d bones and coins to unnote the second inv, suicide, tele to edge, repeat.
---
That's irrelevant. What's important is that the item is completely useless and should be made better...
---
I believe in the dream. You hit 70's like its nothing on Cerberus even in that gear.
---
That's a good idea. My only concern is my hp level. I was watching a guide on baby pures by purpp, and he said it's important to keep your hp low. Since I'm still pretty inexperienced, I don't know what's considered too high. I did cannon and alch a lot, but also did some slayer and edgeville pking which got me quite a few hp levels.
---
In purpps video, he has 67hp at 64 combat. I used a combat level calculator to estimate hitpoints for training strength for nh, and it estimates i'd have 69 hp if I were to train my strength to his strength level. Would that be too high? Or am I overthinking this?

Can confirm anyone still playing since 2009 is highly addicted to the game, many players from the beginning including myself have quit due to the deteriorating qualities of the game itself.

I got thieving pet from ardy knights at 75, so that was cool. I also got chin pet at 97, I was worried I'd max hunter before I got it. Now we're at 97 farming, wish me luck.
---
Yeah, so. 
---
Anyone offering free stuff who requires you show something first is trying to scam. They're hoping you put up items and then accept to get their items without realizing you had to give away something more valuable. Like the most common is something like "quitting giving away fury to first person to show me 10m" and you put up 10m then they put up Fury and accept
---
Prove it

Doesn't that make WoW notoriously toxic for groups?

Don't forget to put things into perspective - there are probably 10-20 or so people complaining every day on Reddit about getting hacked. Pretty sure that over 100,000 unique people play the game every day. Sure, there are also other people getting hacked, but its a pretty small number of people in the grand scheme.

Yeah people are so simple on here it's insane. The system literally knows that you've hit your limit, why is it so hard to display that somehow?
---
Yes, it's because of that.  Im pretty sure any bones lost to pkers is still less than the extra you would use on gilded altars
---
First off, we don't know the context and even if we did, I still stand by my point that we SHOULD tiptoe around the cops. Because you know what, they can and will powertrip regardless of what the situation is and there's nothing we can do about it. Who is going to be the judge on whether it's fair or not? And even if Jagex DID decide to pull up the chat log, you really think they would side with the non-player mod?
---
Secondly, to your point of the KBD example, if I was a pmod, that's an automatic mute from me. Sure, a lot of people, and maybe even the majority would say it's not "abusive" or "toxic" but it's not pleasant and in an ideal world, they don't say that.
---
My point is - don't piss off a pmod and it's very easy not to. Just bite your "fucking" tongue and realize that they are in a higher position than you are. You'll get around not only OSRS but also in life much easier as opposed to being a stubborn justice warrior.
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
How do i change my recovery email not the main one. Cant seem to find it anywhere.
---
Good luck finding a Senior Java dev who will work for Junior Java Dev salary*
---
"I can work at this place for $100k/y... Or I can work at Jagex for $60k. Hmmmm"
---
you really are clueless. keep trying
---
For sure. I‚Äôve never even opened one lol. I always horde shit. But this is inspired by ‚Äúmrnosleep‚Äù to be honest 
---
For normal training, I use torag chest and legs. But if you can stand doing BA, getting a torso is recommended. If you ever use a barrows helm, I use veracs. 
---
As far as an actual set goes, only use a set if you're 1Hp'ing with Dharoks set or using guthans set for the heal effect. Otherwise, torag set effect sucks and verac effect isn't really used for normal training either. 
---
playing in your closet?
---
Fighter torso is a lot better for slayer than barrows gear. 
---
You're right. Jagex are the experts and know best. Look at what a wonderful job they've done with RS3.
---
If you're doing the correct movement but at the incorrect time, it might be because you are relying too much on what you see visually. 
---
Your character is not consistently standing where you see it stand visually. It's kinda like when you use vengeance and run, because you are moving but your character is not moving visually. However, you should have an easy time getting to Olm in a solo raid, so I'd definitely suggest doing a solely olm practice session where you try and get the timing down, disregarding points altogether.
---
Why is rex a penis?
---
what do you mean "just another scammer" ?
---
I have a video from stream somewhere where we got the RNG guy to talk to us about his scam, was pretty cool actually
---
NEW THING BAD
---
OLD THING GOOD 
---
Can confirm did same thing
---
Yeah because RNG stands for R Number Generator
---
Typical set up for an alt account. The owner doesn't want to waste time questing.
---
I like it. The clues are meant to be a fun, jokey side part of the game. You have a bloody guy with a suitcase punching you 12s 
---

---
Did we literally already forget about an ex rot member j mod who hacked hundreds of billions of gp and reddit telling the people who got hacked there lying lol.
---
If you didn‚Äôt hide your name I‚Äôd add you and we could be friends! 
---
Why are we still recycling content from RS3 into old school?
---
I remember staying up late one night playing rs because my mom was out. So because she was out I didn't try to hide or anything and I had the lights on. She ended up coming home early and catching me red handed. She grabbed a glass cup off my desk and whipped it at my monitor. I'll never forget trying to fall asleep while this massive CRT monitor is creaking louldy and literally falling apart as I was lying there scared for my 9 year old life
---
Mod Ghost   - I like the newer art styles :)
---
Not sure what you meant by ‚Äú50% of your cash stack‚Äù, but to be clear to those reading, you actually spend half of the amount of money on bones because each indvidual bone has a 50% chance to not be consumed on use. This means that on average, due to this effect possibly occurring more than once per bone, for every bone you buy, you‚Äôre able to use it twice on the chaos altar. 
---
Just like in real life. 
---
Get range on par with combat stats, or at least 75, then go for firecape and monkey madness 2.
---
Yes lmao cause my 2 year old kept chasing me around messing me up so I hid in my closet for a minute to record it 
---
kril and pest queen are rarest but like nonpk said nobody cares about them
---
&lt;3
---
I'd probably cry.
---
I bet people would say the same about Lunar Diplomacy‚Äôs dream world and Tzhaar city if those were released today. They look different than most of Runescape, yet most of us like them.
---
The only thing in the game that seems ‚Äùprivate server-y‚Äù to me are the Catacombs of Kourend. Tons of square areas filled with most of the hostile species in Runescape. It‚Äôs like a damn zoo.
---
I love mrnosleep :D his loot from 100k goblins video was amazing
---
Fuck off you dumb Bwaner
---
A house with frog legs?
---
I do not see your reasoning.
---
Sorry I thought it was clear, people post phishing links on Twitch channels all the time. That in combination with stupidity leads to people getting hacked quite often. I am assuming that the reason someone reported you is because they thought you were doing this, but the reason you got muted is because Jagex doesn't allow advertising of other websites. 
---
Realistically it's impossible to apply a good / evil tag to Saradomin or Zamorak, and Guthix is more Neutral Good. Saradomin's entire shtick is being the God of Order / Lawful and frequently kneejerks between good and evil depending on his mood, being responsible for fucking up Guthix's homeworld / leading to it's eventual demise and the entire peace happiness help others of the monks. I guess Lawful Neutral due to it?
---
Guthix basically is a janitor. Came in, set everything up, cleaned it all when everyone made a mess and kicked out the perps then went on break. He's good because he's the bro of mortals, but realistically just took a millennial nap on the job
---
Zamorak is Chaotic Neutral for the same reason. A lot of his followers are asshats, but the crux of his argument is basically Zaros+: people who have potential should pursue it, and order eventually leads to stagnation which inhibits growth. 
---
Bandos is ??? / Evil because the only law he cares about is his own, and he's the only real individual who was just plain bad. Literally killed his entire planet in order to become a god and *revelled* in the destruction.
---
Good Guy Armadyl is Lawful Good, protect the weak and don't be a cock.
---
Zaros is Lawful Neutral sorta like Saradomin, wants order but does a ton of fucked up stuff on the side while his empire shines brightly.
---
 D
---
I‚Äôm working on it right now 
---
No git gud
---
Kinda looks osrs.  But what and where is this?
---
But when pkers do show up, are they more skillful than those in normal worlds?
---
If you log into your account on the official runescape website and go to account status you should be able to view the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for your mute (the chat log from the time you were reported). Its most likely the twitch thing though. There isn‚Äôt really anything wrong with what you did but the rule is there to prevent scamming like the other comment describes and/or widespread advertising. 
---
Which brings us full circle:
---
&gt; Having to gear up for a fight that probably isn't going to happen would get tedious real fast.

#SellOut :P
---
If you followed their news at all you would know they are working on remedying this issue. 
---
I don't enjoy it = game is bad
---
reee devalues my copious grinding
---
And then you smack them just to reaffirm you don't have the chain meanings backwards.
---
fair points. Penance queen is the second rarest pet in the game and looks pretty cool (subjective component of this analysis, of course, is aesthetics), so I think it deserves 1a, but if most people disagree it can be moved. For Hydra, I think tier 2a might be a good landing spot. Imo it's one of the best looking pets in the game and is technically locked behind the highest slayer requirement of any slayer boss
---
also isnt tangleroot tier 1b for sure
---
Yeah I have no problems with any other rooms solo. I have tried leaving earlier but then I seem like I am a tick earlier and the head doesn't turn properly.i have went in and ran the head for an hour before without really trying to kill olm to see if I could get it down but made next to zero progress so I'm not sure what my barrier is at the moment.
---
Good job buddy
---
I feel like you left the ring off the mage for some reason. Really unique tho, pretty awesome actually. 
---
A lot of people will say barrows, and they would be right. Except if you want to save the most money, your gear is fine for easy things. Torags would be good to get for harder things that require high defense defense. It's also not really expensive to use. Go for the proselyte armor for when you need to pray for slayer tasks. 
---
You're not gearing up for the fight, you should be in your gear already because the optimal clue setup is combat gear + teleport items like diary equips.
---
This looks terrible and doesn't fit the unique graphic design OSRS curates. The fact that the assets exists already doesn't change the poor visual direction. 
---
It really puts me off on what the game will look like in the future. Zeah was already a failure. Thankfully Mod West has the skill to change that, and the Hosidius rework is a step in the right direction. How many months and years of development time has Jagex wasted, because they didn't make an overall Design Reference? Who is the graphical supervisor for OSRS? The content is great. For the people that "like" the design, they would probably like alternatives too. It's worth listening to the criticism many have about certain art direction choices. 
---
I too like to crash and then cry wolf. 
---
Did they overreact? Sure. Are you still a dick? Yes.
---
Only 800m to go
---
I'm surprised Jagex never changed the font in all these years. Either that's very difficult to do for some reason, or they're in on the joke.
---
Oh I see. Thanks dude.
---
I do them on occasion 
---
Very interesting 
---
How has this gone unnoticed
---
Fuck efficiencyscape, nostalgia and fashionscape is where it's at. There used to be something prestigious about running around in your earned 99, not anymore I guess 
---
Link?
---
Do they have a minimum? Which site do u use?
---
Not only no firecape but in dragon armor and scimitar 
---
I had bandos when i was lvl 90. Idk how you can be high level and poor

IDK why this is nsfw but I'm bout to find out I guess.

In non pvp din gives an additional 20% defense bonus. When not in pvp it‚Äôs a regular shield but with 120+ defense stats excluding mage

---
The reason they should is because of money since there are more stupid people on this planet then smart ones it‚Äôs that simple 
---
It would actually be pretty awesome if they made it a dedicated clan man mode. Clan leaders would sign up for the tourney and be allocated 100 spots (or whatever is fair) and then each clan would choose its applicants. Even if a clan ended up splitting to get multiple entries, itd be fine as long as other clans can get in. I'd get behind that, but as it is now it just feels wishy washy with how entrants are handled. 
---
true chads bring the prayer cape for ppots sip switches
---
&gt; Graceful doesn‚Äôt make your run last longer though, it makes it regenerate faster. You‚Äôre looking for weight reduction, 
---
Graceful also provides weight reduction. And when you're doing clues, you're stopping from time to time. During which times you regen energy faster.
---
So yes, overall graceful does extend the amount of time you're able to run while doing clues.
---
it wouldnt pass atm

Seren's tricky because like 99% of her major screwups were all accidental or with pure intentions, and additionally her current demeanor is player-determined. She basically destroyed the Elven people by accident via getting them addicted to her presence, sacrificed herself for the remaining elven people, and then basically destroyed them again through the physical embodiment of her negative emotions, which she made to protect them against it polluting all her crystals. But then there's the question of whether Eluned and Haluned were always individually sentient or if that occurred after she shattered, because even for an extension of yourself it's pretty uncool to dump all your negative emotions into someone and have them sealed away. Depending on what you do with the dark shard is the big determinant imo; without the shard she can't feel regret or anger, which is imo pretty huge. While she's a little touchy with it, imo it allows for actual growth instead of being part of a whole.
---
Currently her plot purpose is being Dora the Explorer: "Zaros stop Zarosing!", so realistically Lawful Good?
---
Very cool you are basically cord noodling. Did you learn this by ear or is there a tab somewhere?
---
it's almost like
---
context matters
---
I've already acknowledged Jagex as an incompetent company, then and now.  The reason its desirable is because you can buy and sell all raid gear.  They should be focusing more on untradable raid drops if they want to reduce it in my opinion, but they'd rather see Tbows and Scythes break the economy.   Thats the biggest difference between runescape and any other mmo, and thats why people want to hack accounts so badly.
---
I did to 86 with superiors. I lost almost 2m in bones early on cause I didn't realize when you dropped them they'd disappear. Had 85 def but I didn't die more than once to a team. I got attacked close to 20 times. So all in all, I felt that it was worth it to risk a few inventories and just stay alert. Its hard af to die if you have a few brews and a stamina with you and 300+ def boosts.

Plsss make new content with rs2 style art, this just doesn‚Äôt look 2007 at all. I love that they‚Äôre adding new content tho
---
I think pest control can be pretty fun sometimes. The grind for void isn't that bad, and you get some passive combat experience while playing. It's a nice change of pace from the nmz and slayer routine. 
---
You should be able to party up with your friends though. Its frustrating when you get placed in the queue while your friends get into a game. I think if you're all in the same CC then it should put you in a party together that can't be separated.
---
IVE FUCKING DONE THIS BEFORE LOOOL
---
I learned from a tab years ago. I think like

Video game tabs website or something like that. 
---
Just like the simulations

I get it! Each try takes an hour or more, and it takes most people 3 or more tries. Plus cost of supplies.

I dont know what I think about this

Why do you care so much? It was an obviously a lie he played off as an April fools joke, but that doesn't mean he wasn't entertaining during the tournament. 
---
I can't fathom why anyone would care enough to make a reddit post about this though... 
---
.... ... he said he wanted to ‚Äúsave money in the long run‚Äù and not because he wanted 99 construction ‚Äúthe most‚Äù

This is what we call an assumption.

---
all gwd bosses are close depending on methods/alts or not, raids1/2, selling BA (boss? idk)
---
Literally the rest of his comments talk about how badly he wanted construction. How it was what he wanted to spend the money on. How he wanted a 99. 
---
Theres a bbq party
---
Over at the Walmart
---
Ironman btw,
---
Im currently working on getting enough giant seaweed for 99 crafting (5k to go) and i want to get a d pick before i start the sand bucket grind. I've never killed any of the wildy bosses before, which would be best to grind for the pick? 94 range 85+ melee stats if that helps
---
He is playing OSRS mobile yet he has a full battery, it‚Äôs never been done.

last second was satisfying, I was really expecting crabs and mentions of dmm tourny

yea i mean i focus too much on afking so sometimes it feels like im not even having fun just trying to make more meaning out of stuff in real life that i'm not enjoying.

Runelite doesn't actually know anything, it just reads from the game the same you can for the most part. For example if someone had dropped sire's def with dwh like 6x but you you were in varrock the whole time and then teled to sire after, runelite wouldn't know. You shouldn't trust runelite's evaluation over your own game knowledge.

Possible demiboss from the clue scroll update next week. Comes from elite and master clues but requires an opt in followed by going to a chest in Watson's house to start it

75 range 43 prayer as a minimum I'd say... higher with higher def to make it easier

I think willows are worse gp per xp than yews or magics. I was debating doing them for a while since I have 150ish willows from a ton of contracts  but it'd be more expensive in the long run 
---
The record for completed fire cape is 30 ish cb where the guy used bone cbow. Kempq attempted it (idk the progress) on a lvl 23 by poisoning the entire fight caves. I did mine with 44 prayer and 54 ish range. If you are good with your prot prayers, you could do it with basically any stats. The usual stats for someone doing it are at least 75 range and 45 def so you can use blowpipe and void or god d'hide.

---
Honestly this would be pretty cool.
---
 Like, you could set up certain pre-set inventory configurations for whatever boss or task you wanted. Like you could set up a 1. Range KBD setup or a 2. KQ Blowpipe setup and the game could pull from your bank all of the preassigned items if they are available and keep them in the order you save. 
---
I just realized this is not exactly what this post is suggesting, but I like my idea too.

No, my RSN has part of my name in it but I've a pretty uncommon surname and there's also a few digits in my email so there's no way it could have just been a lucky guess!

I think I share some gripes with the community on this one. The design and concept is cool, but theres something kind of RS3 about it. I think for me its the curvature of the chest and the smoothness of the circles. Feel free to point out examples, but smooth circles in large form isn't something we see everyday in OSRS, especially not for world graphics/objects, and I think the call that the area is over-textured is a good shout. The coins should be a decoration, not the main texture IMO. If it's going to be the main floor texture, I'd like to see them more jumbled around, have stacks that act as obstacles/ barriers to move around and not a flat floor-space to move across.
---
Fuck, I didn't specify enough again. It's meant to slap in a W whenever "q p" appears in chat, but the plugin typing the W itself is an auto typing no no. It sends a message to the player with what they need to type to line it up, I put it in trade chat so you can easily hide it. It works for your own messages, for other peoples messages, and even messages in your cc, but that can get messed up for people without the rank icons showing if you have a rank and the q p sender doesn't or vice versa.
---
Lmao, I had someone tell me that earlier. There are two posts in the pack so don‚Äôt worry it did zero damage üòõ

If you‚Äôre extra lazy, add ‚Äò-wikia‚Äô to your Google search.

Talking about scythe? Only buy it if you can regularly get groups and cleanly farm TOB. However if you can do that Scythe is mandatory for most clans. I know mine requires Scythe for TOB groups (unless you explicitly advertise that you dont require scythe, which no one does).
---
It's like 2-3 DPS more than void whipping, which is a lot considering we're talking that is like a 30 percent damage increase, vs all the bosses you use it on, per person.

Any reqs for swamp crabs?
---
Just use range and pay attention every 1/3rd of hesporis hp and yeah you'll be fine. 
---
&gt; And no one's bringing that setup to do wilderness clues either. Which you conveniently skipped over :p
---
Yes they do, this is a setup that protects 3+1 items that matter, BP + Claws are the only really important ones, then any 2 others that you want (Eternal Glory and Slayer Ring in this picture)
---
&gt;Just let people start them when they're ready.
---
Then don't open the chest until you're ready, and besides like the gank clue step, when you know it's there, you should be geared to be ready.

Fourth step.. Probably sandwhich lady random event.

Depends what you're doing, Obsidian + Berserker is better for training but you can't use the set during Slayer because you'll want the Black Mask buff. Yes, the next step up would be bandos.

Finding out that the master step next to the canoe spot can spawn a brassican mage if you dig in singles instead of the 3 cunts is life changing.
---
You could maybe do 1 or 2 kills per trip solo. I‚Äôd recommend going in a duo or trio and you could stay much longer
---
Because I accidentally missed a 0, people put in buy offers minus a digit relying on people to be as dumb as I was.
---
This is the best solution I have ever heard. If anything it will at least make it painstakingly annoying to make each new bot account. Would force someone to make a whole new macro to check for conditions and stuff going through tutorial. Especially if they always mixed around the order in which you learn the skills.
---
BUT, because tutorial is the barrier of entry for new players, and because it could become confusing and turn them away, and because tutorial island has been in this game for so long its nostalgic, and because it most likely will be figured out how to bot through anyway, I just don't see them taking this route.

Don't joke around Lil' Kebbit is fire

I guess ghosts ahoy but not really. I use ectophial and run south, or you could use fairy rings and run south east.

looks like they accidentally entered 300k selling price instead of 3m but still didnt get ripped off.

Malware bytes, then create a brand new email, with  new password, 2fa it, change your accounts email to the new one, change your password in-game not to the same as the email, authenticator. You'll be fine

Wait what??? I literally just died at that clue

Actually, -fandom is more effective since they changed their domain name a few months back.

This is the quality content I subscribed to this sub for.

I would say most of the osrs original content is not very saturated on the grand scale of things. Sure there are things that are not dull or dark, but zeah was kind of it own thing art style wise.

Do it.

I like this. Epically the fine print

---
I wear dhide and diary gear with a couple sharks and karambs in my invy when doing masters, I don't bank or regear for the triple mages. Would be a real pain to gear up for a boss before you even know if you're gonna fight it
---
Maybe the necklace is not suppose to be for DPS? Rather it's intended for places like cannoning dagganoths or bursting monkeys where strength bonus doesn't matter as much. 
---
Alternatively, you can make the necklace restore prayer without requiring equipping it.
---
Can we get an Ironman DMM with a PvP block in place? Throw in a max-hours timer (let say, 100 hours maximum to prepare) and then lock up the account until the day(s) before the tournament, then give each 5-10 hours to prep max, and finally enable PvP at the start of the tournament.
---
Then drop all sorts of high-end gear randomly across the map which they likely didn't have enough time to obtain, but not like air-drops. Just suddenly spawned all over at random intervals and spots.
---
And to say my crazy ideas: 
---
Maybe say fuck it and do it in the style of the Falador party room with balloons dropping gear.
---
Then instead of fog you spawn a horde of monsters of various levels all over on the outskirts. Toss in some high level bosses as well, just walking across the map like hell's broken loose. 
---
Then perhaps make all monsters aggressive to all levels like a disease breaks out. Throw in some actual poison damage that can be communicated to other players during battle like a disease. 
---
The point being to raise some unpredictable hell on purpose, forcing players to both fight each other and fight the game engine. And in the middle of all this, any glitches ca just be chalked up as intentional. 
---
With only 100 hours max devoted to the lead up, nobody can go waahhhhh about their maxed out account they spent weeks straight leveling up. 
---
What fucking site are they talking about?
---
This is not true of tsp or mypay.

If only it were that easy. Afaik there's no way to download a plugin on its own, so the only way other people can get it is if RuneLite decides to add it to the official release, or if I send the code and you toss it in a local version of RuneLite yourself.

t's not RWT you just have an agenda, stop fucking crying about some stupid game a streamer - fuck off you stupid white-knight lol your virtual e-girl isn't going to sleep with you because you defended her on a reddit post, nice try though.

Go show this post to her so you can have a pat on the back and a well done from your Queen.

I had not actually reported her, but you know what, I will do now and I'll continue to post about it, thanks.

Now the conversation is done because you couldn't help but read this.

Thank you. I thought someone would enjoy it

I just find it funny that it prefers a mark over a piece of the outfit. Kind of backwards logic

I did the same with 3 abyssal daggers (p+), not (p++) which are items rarely traded and at the time had a GE value above the p++ and regular abyssal dagger and i still only missed out on 2m for 3 items that at the time could be traded in GE for 21M

Changing things to BoE like in WoW would drastically change the way people play the game. There's no way a change like that would be beneficial. Just sounds to me like you're bitter about expensive things you can't afford.
---
And given 30% of the game is made of ironmen...
---
That definition makes the most sense to me. I guess my next question would be is it *runescape* that's actually addictive, or are people just using it as an escape, or does that distinction even matter. And what should/can Jagex do about it, if anything.

---
Obviously you never played rs3 or just don‚Äôt understand it because it wasn‚Äôt quality of life updates like this that ruined it. Rs3 was ruined because of micro transactions and not listening to their community.
---
And I‚Äôm wondering if you even understood the post because this is about inventory management. 
---
It‚Äôs about Jagex giving us the ability to organize our inventories. 
---
It‚Äôs about making it a better experience.

Extra Note: Even if you don't agree with the idea or stats, what do you think about the Mahjarrat lore theory?
---
It‚Äôs alright. With morytania hard diary you get 50% more runes which is where most of the profit comes from. Since you have fairly high mage you could probably get 1-1.5m/hr on average with it. 
---
What do you mean by find groups? Barrows is a solo thing. If you‚Äôre talking about pvm in general you can find lots of clans ranging from low-mid level players up to the elite of the elite. Just browse around, check requirements, and apply where you think you might fit in. 
---
Range is super useful at higher level bosses. But so is everything else. You can change up the order you train combat styles but you should eventually try to do all of them. 
---
If you want to pm me your in game name I can meet up and help you make a good gear setup out of whatever you have.

If we are talking about PVP, its more so because magic has absolutely zero KO potential. Sure it can do damage if you unskull with the 20m+ worth of gear to boost damage, but why? You can just bring a gmaul or AGS and have no risk. What magic needs is a spec weapon/spell of some sort, or something to that effect. 
---
Would be too hard to balance on current spell books, would probably need to be a new book implemented. Maybe buyable through BH store?

Isn't it to be assumed that all OSRS players are perpetually in the closet?

What's the best bet for getting herbs and secondaries? My current plan is farming tarromin and limps because I can farm both, I'm currently stealing from master farmers but I rarely get any of those seeds. 
---
Would getting guam and tar be better or farming red spider eggs?
---
I have been farming chaos druids for herbs but decided to put that on pause because I wasn't getting secondaries that way. 
---
That‚Äôs horribly over powered. I would kill one of my alts and then go do skulled revs for an hour, and then just repeat the process till I‚Äôm fuckin rich as fuck

Hmm that‚Äôs strange, I‚Äôm around the same stats and my kills take around 2/2:30 mins. Do you double spec vorkath or spec once per kill?

You like being bombarded by irrelevant and sometimes spoiler filled ads on a wiki that sometimes contains wrong information?
---
my mans
---
I try to double spec. Sadly vorkath likes to fireball me when I try to double spec lol. Are you using addy darts as well or DPSing during acid 
---
No, you still keep your +3, you just can't use the protect item prayer. I can't really speak to whether higher total level worlds pkers are better geared, my guess is probably.
---
Now that we know how it works I think the only problem is calling it a mimic. Having to enter the chests pocket dimension is a cool as fuck solution to the design problem and very runescapey too
---

Congrats man! I‚Äôve been hesitant snd scared to do it on my own even though I have very high combat skills haha. First time jitters I guess.

Honestly who cares if he rwt‚Äôd a couple bows, more power to him. He still has a sick account and I would do the same thing in his position. 
---
Saying 'it could' is far from a promise. It just means, it could
---
Yep like any business they'd have to justify the investment into the upgrade. The real thing also is that the engine is bloody ancient, and finding an experienced person to work on it is hard, and/or costs a fortune. 
---
I know where I‚Äôm pking tonight 
---
Yeah but by the same logic it could never happen and you could save no money. It works out statistically to cost you 33% less than if you used a gilded altar (if we use a base of 50% chance to not consume the bone)
---
Not that lucky. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a billion merch offers in the ge all the time to try and get a few mil off high ticket items. I‚Äôd say getting 118 is unlucky. 
---
Hmmm, the real question is, should we trust just some nerdy dude?
---
I'm pretty happy in my sysadmin job, lol. Just been playing for longer than you've probably been alive.

If you want an easy game with modern UI design maybe don't play a legacy version of an 18 year old MMO, retard.

YEET
---
I‚Äôm not sure, It also could‚Äôve been a timing thing 
---
it's owned by wikia
---
TRUE
---
Addy darts and I just walk around during acid. I think rune darts are probably a bit wasteful so if kill times are consistently long either train up ranged a bit or try get prayer up and invest in rigour if you have enough. I don‚Äôt think woox walking has a massive impact on kill times so don‚Äôt worry about trying it if it takes too much of your food when it goes wrong.
---
I can attest to this completely. I‚Äôm in college and didn‚Äôt play at all during summer or winter breaks because I usually always had something better to do. Now that I‚Äôm back in class, I resort to RS for my daily dopamine/serotonin fix, or mainly because I really don‚Äôt feel like doing work and RS provides me with the enjoyment I need. 
---
Just secure your account though

Save for an imbued heart.

Works for any level, but its a easy way to flex it without being wierd flex :)

The regular attack‚Äôs he does? I feel like I‚Äôm constantly getting 15-20‚Äôs from the mage attacks and range is hitting almost 30

Finally
---
I get the salt at how little Jagex pays but ‚Äújust hire more people‚Äù is such a lazy response even if it was possible, it‚Äôs so much deeper than just needing more devs
---
The vast majority of this game comes from mid 2000s era engine code that the current dev team inherited and had no part in designing, not to mention that broad engine work on a game that‚Äôs as expansive as OSRS, constantly live, and so outdated at the ground level would require an insane amount of time and effort invested just for the possibility to then spend more time and effort correcting small QoL stuff like this. Hiring a team of devs to go down that path who then have even less familiarity with the code and have to be let go after finishing the engine work would make absolutely no sense for any company...Why do you think WoW has only rarely done any engine work? Almost no MMORPG‚Äôs, and very few games in general, will rebuild their entire engine unless they‚Äôre launching a massive expansion or an entirely new game (like they did for RS3). It‚Äôs just not worth it for the payoff in most cases
---
Thanks I appreciate the links. After watching that and rewatching his first video where he says he paused the recorder it does seem unlikely that it's a joke. I'm sure dying was very embarrassing but lying is clearly not the way to go as it puts all past and future actions into extra scrutiny. 
---
Double it again and... it's gone
---
But god d'hide is the only upgrade you can afford with 7m cash atm.  You'll get +2 prayer bonus from it.
---
Why are you taking damage from the mage attacks? With mage prayer and super antifire it should only be the ranged attack that does significant damage (flames occasionally hit but not very often at all)
---
Not sure lad

One of my favorite tracks in the game. Great rendition!

---
Except it's really not. They have a lack of Java developers. Right now, they have 2 or 3 I believe? That's not enough for two games - OldSchool RuneScape and RuneScape 3 are absolutely massive games at that.
---
I apologised in my letter. I did something wrong clearly ‚Äúso what did you use?‚Äù That‚Äôs what I need to discuss with a mod.
---
It was a different client and that‚Äôs what I think they detected because if there‚Äôs a way they can check my gameplay they will see I didn‚Äôt have a script or whatever.
---
So I‚Äôm just putting it out here I apologised for using it cause it clearly mercd me, and gave evidence to show I‚Äôm constantly grinding.
