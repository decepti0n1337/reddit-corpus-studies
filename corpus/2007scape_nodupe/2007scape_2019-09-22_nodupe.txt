I've went over 7 hours without anything but then the next day got 3 drops in an hour.

Why not? It's an easy way to determine whether it's worth writing a two paragraph long post explaining why they're wrong. Anyone that debates politics online doesn't care about being informed, so I determined it was no use explaining why he is an idiot, as he would ignore it anyways.
---

---
The fact that his post is at +17 while being blatantly wrong and my later post actually explaining why he's wrong is at -6 says enough, no?
---
There are literally hundreds of RSPS that exist, it's not any more of a "scam" than them.

Sounds like guerilla war tactics to me.

If you honestly think this community would have a last exodus if 3rd party clients are bannable I’m going to respectfully disagree. This community is littered with addicts and NEETs. Sure some will leave but they’ll be back within a week.

Rune
---
agreed, its such an easy skill to train once you have supplies.  Its gotta be one of the fastest skills to train /hr

The moment this happens I'm rwting all my shit in a blink

Touchè
---
Doing zulrah right now. 1:10,000+ depends how long I want to run it
---
Jagex has a very hard time with gray areas.
---
Aren't you exaggerating a little bit. I doubt half the playerbase is going to drop the game when most people were doing fine without 3rd party clients back in 07.
---
GPU rendering and tooltips honestly are all I want
---
May get downvoted for this but I actually think parts of mobile need to use less clicks. The game is significantly easier to play on pc.
---
Seems like something that should be pay-per-vat instead of a one time purchase. Maybe lower it to like 200-250k per vat, and you could then also add unlockable criteria in order to purchase vats i.e. block list slots (quest points, certain quests, etc).
---
This is exactly why people don't want this shit. No one cares if you like his videos. Why the fuck should some random content creator be one of the few sole voices when it comes to pvp updates?
---
"Saruman's General Store" got me, amazing
---
I don't think you or much of Reddit has used the base client in a long enough time to realize how awful and unusable it is.
---
Regardless, even if just a few people leave as a result - there's still no incentive for Jagex to do it. Reddit is bitching, sure - but Reddit bitches about everything. In a week this will be a nonissue.
---
There's already a crab in-game named "ry" (probably cause of reeeeeeeee) lol
---
Thank you! :D
---
Please tell me what program you used!
---
Yes. Suicidal people are to blame for suicide. Addicts are to blame for their addiction. You keep saying the same thing over and over because you just refuse to actually take in what I'm saying. It's not a company's fault some people can't control their own lives, they should not have to change for that reason.
---
Most people were also 12 years old back in 07 and never had anything better than the default client.
---
As a mother of 6 virgin man children who are all at least 23 years of age, who spend their time unemployed in my basement, eating chicken tendies with honey mustard, all while 3 ticking on OSRS for maximum efficient for a minimum of 16 hours a day, I can really get behind an update like this
---
It’s not solely the fact Reddit’s bitching. It’s the fact that more and more plugins are being dropped that are just broken as fuck. If the J Mods value the games integrity of their game even remotely they’ll have to say something. What they say, who the fuck knows. But something needs to be done because I don’t care who you are these plugins are not needed in game or should they exist.
---
Youd think people wouldve learned from the last time pvp was taken away.
---
I mean if you try to do any skill with suboptimal supplies you’re not going to have a good time. But yeah I’m with you.
---
Maybe this could be expanded out into an entire herblore guild? You automatically unlock 1 vat every 20 levels, and have 5 total at 99, and you have to buy extras beyond that? Or maybe some sort of other resource sink, using planks with construction? This has a LOT of promise.
---
I hope they expand on quests. To give good lore and rewards
---
Like
---
Tower of life 2
---
Penguins quest (maybe something along the lines they infiltrate powerful figures like Kings and start making changes to benefit themself and the zookeeper is the only one that notices)
---
Void knights quest(but don't add the OP swords please)
---
Quest lock zulrah for a quest after underground pass.
---
New fossil island quest, since that's the theme.
---
Menaphos quest.
---
Like the quests don't need to have good bis, or good items, just lore and fairly decent exp rewards would be nice.
---
Also an updated client would be nice. I wouldn't mind paying more like 15-20$ a month for R&amp;D for a better client.
---
Primarkletics
---
f button doesnt collapse though. what plugin is that
---
Scazmatar
---
Since 28 March 2007, it has been considered scamming.
---
Straight off the oldschool site. It is against the rules completely.
---
xp lamps from random events and some quest rewards. Not very impressive given there are 3 skillers with 80+ slayer
---
You would pay $20 a month for osrs with a better client? You would be unfortunately alone in that
---
oh cool its keyboard im subbed to you on youtube
---
Love the idea. 10/10
---
Not yellow text. 0/10
---
Maybe next time.
---
Yeah maybe, i was in singles but yeah its pretty shit
---
So what’s the solution when the Pvm community are voting in their best interest and against the interest against the others: PvP community and Skilling community?
---
We’ve been talking past eachother this whole time. That question is the point ive been making. I don’t want to exclude PvM from voting, I’d rather not pk for the rest of osrs and pk on a private server before jeopardizing the polling system. But what I’m asking is, what is the alternative to the pkers getting fucked?
---
Ive said this with every comment and u keep going to the issue of baring pvm from voting, scroll up and realize I’ve never mentioned that once. Have you even been trying to understand my point of view?
---
I'd be ok with it if they made the official client good
---
kBD hands down 2b due to wildly risk/lack interest of
---
Nah, let’s just make a new game mode instead.
---
Who cares if these OP clients completely kill the integrity of the game.
---
Sorry if this is annoying but how long did the cannonballs take to make?
---
He is, and don't call him Shirley
---
Explain why should someone who only intends on pking has to be forced into questing, skilling, and pvming for pk gear? Because that's how the game is. You know what else is part of the game? Pking. Pk shouldn't be pker vs pker, it should be pker vs anyone doing anything in the wilderness. And I do believe players should be forced into the wilderness because its part of the game. Why is there no quest that forces you into the wilderness? Why is there such low gp/he methods (apart from revs) in the wild? Why should the majority of the wild be dead content? Having a few hotspots for pk activity in the wild considering how large the area is sounds like its missing an update.
---
make it to where you can toggle them on if they are steps you've completed
---
Nobody implied that, yet every single iron man is crying about "I'm not here for a fight, why do I get attacked!!!" "We don't fight back! leave us alone!" The wilderness provides some of the best money per hour, why shouldn't it be the most dangerous place?
---
Everything is a slipperly slope fallacy until you slide down. They are not magical words that make everything ok.
---
Did you feel the same way about NMZ guthans?
---
if jagex can detect bots via mouse movement, why cant they detect people gaing prayer exp without their mouse moving?

The skilling pets would be worthless because of bots. The wildy boss pets would be decent money. Corp, inferno, tob would be worth the most.
---

---
It’s white and gold!
---
Why is this subreddit such a circle jerk of the same shit ideas "osbuddy is cheating" we get it you spent 100 hours grinding and don't want anyone else to have a good time playing osrs, grow up, jesus why do you guys care so much if the game is easier/more palatable.
---
So you admit that it won’t be around long because it’s a cheat, so your thought is “wow I really should use this cheat?” Fuck you
---
What people aren’t accounting for is it’ll bounce right back to 900M+ when something new is released. Buy it while it’s low
---
I seriously love this!
---
Sure, but I'm talking about my own account.
---
Along with its broken ass features? Nty. 80% of the plugins are broken and the other 20%, we can live without. I think the smartest solution is to have OSB keep releasing botting plugins that don't get detected and hold all these retards who think Adam is some perfect angel when he released his fair share of broken plugins such as a menu entry swapper, hostage until they're all begging to ban everything but the Vanilla client. Give it a couple more botting features, I'm sure people will start supporting banning all 3PC and put up with the Vanilla client not even having GPU or stretched fixed mode if they absolutely have to.
---
losing pet in safe death??
---
Have you considered people who don't know about 3rd party clients? Someone new starts the game, is put off by the experience of the vanilla client and leaves. Jagex just lost money.
---
What guy? I'm not talking about any single person.
---
Plugins increase the speed you can do clues **significantly** compared to having to navigate around the wiki every step. It makes a big difference. It really isn't much different than plugins that significantly speed up thieving, prayer, construction, etc., yet most people agree those are too far.

osrs doesnt support fullscreen.
---
That fletching is 100% bannable and able to be caught lol
---
yes what plugin lets it collapse? default client sure doesnt.
---
damn skulling up with craw bow risk lol
---
why? its a safe death. it doesnt make sense to lose pet.
---
That makes sense, do the best pkers spend a lot of time pking with their huge clan in single-combat areas where the target can't fight back? That sounds satisfying.
---
Two weeks ago I'd tell you off, now whatever lmao
---
Yes, that sort of thing is what I was thinking of. Is that the thing battlefield 2/3 used?
---
Oh totally, no doubt that jagex would see you fletch ***8x*** what is possible.
---
Bro, I've got three full zammy sets. I could buy varrock if I wanted to

Nice humble brag
---
Devalues accomplishments og players made. Thats why a lot have left already. Plus most people are reluctant to start goin ezscape due to what happened to rs3 where a lvl 99 there is a lvl 70 osrs
---
Seasons in other games are just fuel to the addiction fire. Of course people love them, they get free or limited edition stuff for playing.  As a result they'll login more often just to get the free stuff or feel like they're missing out.
---
took ages, it's like 100k profit per hour
---
you have 2.5 mins of complete afk time between each inventory though, which is super low attention
---
Then my parole officer wouldn't be upset. Hope you bring your depends I play hard.
---
Your experience in the wild is brought to you by PKers, all those cool bosses and content that's way better than shit in safe zones is only there because you risk dying to another player. Shit like the chaos alter couldn't even exist in a safe area, gilded alters would be 100% obsolete. If you enjoy all the overpowered wilderness content you should thank the next PKer that kills you.
---
oh and you're totally acting entitled, you want the added reward of a dangerous activity without any of the danger. that's being entitled
---
finally? 1001 kc is under the droprate to get all pieces.
---
Because that should be a vanilla change, not modding.
---
What's the risk in doing that? 150k in supplies?
---
Rename this guide on "how to sell all your personal information for a couple pennies" that's more accurate
---
Better yet always remember.
---
Fuck dude
---
" las Americanos "
---
Do you really think America means the USA? As if I needed another confirmation that your average Reddit user is beyond stupid on a level science didn't even think was possible. Wow.
---
Not even to mention your stupidity to compare a Spanish person to a person of Puerto Rica. Without probally knowing, you're pretty much an ignorant racist. But I won't go futher into that topic as I can't help someone who simply can't help himself.
---
I just got to the episode where you talked about the normal trees and misheard it as 20 hours. Wow
---
;p
---
That's what PvP worlds are for m8. Leave the actual wildy to the spastics.
---
yea its not like fletching darts urself sucks? /s
---
how do u know i didnt have a bowl of adderall soup and im doing it manually?
---
This is my favourite track in rs. So many memories
---
lmao how expensive is it to make a new client? Can't be that expensive, and they make like over 50m PROFIt after tax a year, they can afford it easily.
---
because it's a game and he plays it for enjoyment, and con wasn't enjoyable
---
They would have to update the official client before banning 3rd party clients or there would be way too much outrage.
---
I’m not saying the risk is too high or too low. I’m just answering your first question. I personally don’t pk but I enjoy watching it so I think pking should have more incentive.
---
What high gp methods would you like in the wildy?
---
Sounds cool! I want higher max hits 😉
---
I just recently started playing again on a fresh account and goddamn isnt runelite such a big quality of life upgrade, it would be shame if it got taken away after I returned from such a long break.
---
He made it? I thought you made it.
---
If he is I hope he makes a f2p pk video. I want to see him meme this game lol
---
literally all skills are monotonous doing 1 task over and over again, thieving is no exception.
---
Dude it’s a runescape meme about a rapper with 69 on his head, if you’re looking to be an elitist you’re in the wrong place
---
How your only answering a survey.
---
Two things..defensive purposes and more importantly, can restore prayer points.  Kinda handy to all of a sudden have som prayer points when a pk’er shows up.  As an achievement diary reward, there is als9 the perk of them being free.
---
It started out as 20 hours haha. I was very naive back then
---
Is it wrong to bot if your over 50?
---
Cause unless you're Todd rogers or using some tas bullshit you cant hit 8 ticks in 1.
---
Also cause y'know, you're joking and all.
---
~~I think~~
---
I know, ai didn't think of that part. But for the people complaining about it, there's virtually no risk in doing that minigame. The people I've killed doing that have given me 150k or less in supplies.

2.5m and 3.5m gp/hr for regular and corrupted respectively assuming you can do them efficiently.
---
This post is very clearly written by someone who does not and has not pked as it contains the same sweeping generalizations and misinformation that people on this subreddit constantly spread.
---
* Pking is terrible money for the vast majority of pkers. Pking skillers and pvmers, while "safer," is even worse money than fighting other pkers. To suggest that hunting easy targets for profit is the primary motivation for pking is ridiculous. People pk for fun, with profit being at best a secondary concern.
---
* Most pkers are hunting for other pkers, either those that can fight back, or those lower down the "food chain." Only a small subset of pkers who are at the bottom of said food chain actively target non-pkers.
---
* Outside of things like riskfighting (for obvious reasons), things like ahk and prayer scripts are exceedingly rare. Reddit would have you think that every pker in the wilderness is using these scripts but anyone with any level of experience pking could tell you that most people are terrible mechanically and most definitely aren't using any sort of cheat client or script.
---
There are a ton of other inaccuracies regarding how pking works but i cba getting into all of it.
---
I am curious though, what sort of changes would you vote yes to for pvp? You don't want rewards that affect pvm/skilling like the dpick, you don't want rewards that solely affect pvp like the elder maul attachment (apart from flinching tek this is only used in pker vs pker fights since it is a terrible +1 for deep wild, where people hunt non-pkers), you don't even want purely cosmetic things like taunt emotes. When people are voting down literally every suggested reward from **a fully optional pvp minigame that gives everyone the same gear and stats to ensure an entirely level playing field**, the logical conclusion is that people are simply voting no because they don't like pvpers.
---
i dont understand the rage when its faster to do this without the plugin
---
You are wrong dude, all of those new players move on from killing defenceless low risk people and do join single and multi clans. They do go to bh and pvp, they do lots more types of risky pking. Eventually theyll play for years, get really good and have many builds. Get bored and quit or take a long break and come back randomly.
---
There is a cycle. The "pkers" arent just always the same group of people. New people constantly move through and older ones leave.
---
The wildy slayer, bosses, clues, revs, prayer, fountain of rune etc. Have all helped with the long time issue for osrs pvp, the barrier to entry. It is insane the amount of new people in clans that ive asked how they got into pvp, almost always something like "I was at X place and got killed".
---
So imo its a mindset problem of a majority of the playerbase that has been super catered to for the last 7 years with the poll system, twitter discussion with devs, Hiveminding on reddit. These along with constant updates for such a long time, created an overwhelming entitled player type for runeacape. They mostly do pvm, with slayer and bossing while building their bis gear. I am not trying to take a poke of anyone that plays or thinks like this, i just feel it is a product of how the game has been ran since osrs release.
---
Charging air orbs, most likely
---
umm you can get the last piece for the collection log?? u ok there?
---
What does that do exactly?
---
Wasn't pking meta basically rushing in classic? Since you couldn't eat during combat you basically had to ambush them and try and kill them in 3 hits with r2h each time
---
You can get the drop again (currently)
---
I cant imagine playing not on rl. They would need to do a really good job with thier client.
---
Crab rave, anyone?
---
Imagine following someone just because you think they're attractive
---
A shitty sub that reaches hundreds of thousands of members of the community isn’t good for anyone. You’re not wrong that nobody is stopping people from leaving but even after that the people who come here for information or because they’re interested in playing get nothing of value and typically receive misinformation.
---
YUGE
---
?
---
Can you boost from 20?
---
Either way that’s sick man!
---
Runelite obliged when they were asked to remove the Zulrah plugin so they're good guys imo.
---
Collection log talk to some guy in varrock museum.
---
Okay mr "notabotting" who seems like the best way to play the game is to literally not play at all.
---
No reason to stop but might be gone soon which will make the game so meh.
---
So...is this bannable atm or not?
---
i laugh even more hysterically because there will be somebody who will ask help of /u/skillbert_ii to create similar to alt1 for osrs.
---
btw mr skillbert, why _ii and not using the original /u/skillbert ?
---
Who cares
---
Uhm jars are jars why should hydra be different from any other boss..?

Yes you should quit using it because it’s a bullshit cheat client - get runelite

---
imagine thinking you're worth anything as a person just because you ran a script to play a videogame for you.
---
I think I'd behave like a little brat on the internet too if I hated myself as much as you must, lol.
---
It's the same for all the jars, just feel bads. Unfortunately we are already down this road, can't really go back. All the jars should've been untradeable from the beginning. Not sure was jagex was thinking
---
I think the value would be relevant to the rare drop value considering it's more rare and wanted.
---
i just hope all the PvMer complaints don’t end up forcing jagex’s hand in a bad direction. it sounds like a lot of people want wilderness content to be more accessible, which would be nice, but i fear that some would have it removed from pvp areas entirely. (i’m talking mostly about boss/skilling content but it applies to clue steps as well) this in my opinion would take away from what makes this content—and the wilderness in general—such a special part of the game. 
---
i have an idea. a lot of people seem to want to make it *harder* for PvPers to kill PvMers, but this would mean annoying nerfs that will obviously upset PvPers. why not instead try making it *easier* for PvMers to defend themselves. or even just make the prospect less risky. if you ask me, the number one problem is _skull tricking_. why would i bring good gear with me to fight back if there’s a possibility that i could be unwittingly skulled and lose everything?
---
as it was intended, skulling is a fabulous mechanic. it encapsulates the inherent idea of PvP which is if you want to engage in it, you should be ready to lose everything. i don’t know how skull tricking could be fixed, but imo this is the biggest obstacle to PvMers wanting to enter the wild with anything that would make it feasible  for them to actually engage with any of the content there.
---
You already had ur chance. Jagex is finally doing whats been suggested for years.
---
Found the guy with 'PvM' in his name and 0kc at raids &amp; gwd
---
I love your humility.
---
I think all jars should be untradable. It would be a nice showoff item for the house and it would also be a nice drop to get instead of a troll drop. 
---
I've always treated them as untradable and gathered them myself just cus it feels more fun that way.
---
It's literally part of the main game. Play resizeable with stones down the bottom and allow f keys to close interface.
---
That's macroing though

it’s probably from solo wt which racks up tons of points and gives more than 3 rolls

---
That's fair, even though I'd argue most stashes are still available at a medium level
---
You act in disbelief. Have you not seen instagram thots?
---
if that were true AE wouldn't have been flamed into the ground by this community.
---
Okay so you're a bad troll talking about actual topics? Ever heard of resizeable?
---
Lol
---
How is this macroing? You're litterally clicking and spam clicking something. You might as well call pickpocketing ardy knights and master farmers macroing as well then
---
F1 is my f key for inventory. Should have specified that.
---
You set it to allow it to close your interface. You line knight up with your first inventory space. You spam F1 and click. Pouches open and knight is thieved. Coin pouches did nothing to change that method. Stupid update.
---
1. Its not in most of their best interest. Lack of  pvp in the game would be advantageous to them.
---
2. Many updates fail that do not involve baiting them to the wilderness.
---
Do you see why we are in this position now?
---
Mod Ash has specifically tweeted this reason as acceptable to keep the plugin permitted.
---
You were only there for two hours look at the points and points per hour who u tryna kid

I don't think that is an exclusively rs related term

You did a good job of doing the opposite of that, so I thank you for your assistance.

I feel I should also let you know that the term "damage control" implies that you (or those you represent) did something wrong and are trying to lessen the negative impact on your reputation. Again, you did excellent in opposition of that lol
---
A really weird weapon called a Dragon Cane. It has stats of a dragon mace but no spec and it has no quest requirement.
---
I'd argue that the ornate pool is a hard requirement before even starting questing.
---
Thanks! Appreciate it!
---
I like it too
---
Do you think that the wildy still needs more PvM content to be added?
---
shows what influence can do.
---
agreed
---
Why?
---
Full ankou looks pretty cool, and ranger boots are a staple. That and a good skill cape and or pet.
---
The con one also wasn't totally busted like these ones. Just saves your wrists and it actually seems like the way it should be programmed.
---
I think you can pick more than one up at a time now? correct me if I'm wrong.
---
This is mostly in reference to the nerf to Dhin's Bulwark and the other wilderness-focused changes that were forced through as "integrity changes" clearly designed to make it easier for pkers to kill defensively-focused targets that weren't going to fight back.
---
&gt; a huge item/supply sink,
---
Weren't PKers crying about "spite voters" voting no to item keys that allowed you to take a guys entire inventory with you, removing this sink entirely?
---
&gt; Hmmm my reply was the risk of the gear set because even in the most raggy gear its still a lot more than what they are hunting.. which is normal monkfish and dhides lol
---
Implying a majority of pkers don't wear salad robes/mystics with black dhide switches while risk at most 300k. lul ok.
---
So it's okay to trivialize aspects of the game as long as they aren't literal skills? I guess the boss plugins are okay then.
---
Not like the current system matters when there's hardly anyone to fight. Don't complain about no one to fight if you're making pking exclusive to the sweatiest of players.
---
Doing them individually is faster because you skip a tick iirc.
---
Yeah, I'll cash out a few k and dip as well. Vanilla = cancer
---
ohhhhhh shitttttt
---
People do this at black chins for my 250k loot even

You're trying to convince the rabbits that the wolves need sharper teeth, knowing full well that the wolves don't want to hunt other wolves. **Of course they're going to vote no**.
---
But, you can't take their vote away from them because they both live in the forest.
---
You dont give up after trying one or two times. You keep going. And learning how to improve everytime you die and everytime you bank loot. After a while you'll understand pathhing, where clans log in. Be super fast at logging. Hide behide walls, camp below 30 after a kill or 2 and be ready to tele. 
---
Make sure you have player indcators on so you can see when lots of names log in or run towards you. 
---
Once you a beast at tanking and escape and antipking the solo noobs. You'll most likely join one of the clans and continue to improve your skills, make friends that you chat with in voice everyday. Build team strength by working together under the same leadership with others for a long time.
---
Then you'll go back to pvm, but you'll take a couple of clan mates and anti pker gear. You'll talk shit while listening to music in discord. You clear out any unskulls or even ko them with yah bois. Escapes will become legendary, you taking the L and your 2 mates getting out.
---
You might get high total and join a paid protection total world clan. You might make a level 68 alt with 89 agility to camp the rev dark beast.
---
Dont give up lad, there is so much potential in those caves.
---
There's already so many options for PvP, just **stop forcing it in PvM**. PKers should only be fighting other PKers, period.  
---
There's PvP worlds, BH, Deadman, Duel Arena, Castle Wars, Clan Wars, LMS, all that... If people want to PvP they should not be looking towards Wildy in normal worlds, I'd argue that shouldn't even be a thing. Having so much exclusive PvM content in Wildy is what makes RS PvP so obnoxious.

99% of the time PKers are just looking for defenseless PvMers risking little-to-nothing to waste their time, usually with massive groups of people helping them so you can't do anything, and the game is already a massive time sink, so it gets very frustrating to potentially lose tens or even hundreds of hours to something barely within your control. They're not looking for other PKers to kill, otherwise they wouldn't be in Wildy. It's *pure* toxicity, nothing good comes from it and it puts people off of the game.  
---
The only reason to force PvMers against PKers is to get cheap, free kills. That's the opposite of a fair or satisfying PvP implementation. I guarantee you it annoys more people than it satisfies.
---
The question is if osrs releases it's on client, will it have all the features runelite has?  If it doesn't have certain features that runelite has, does that mean jagex deems that plugin against the spirit of the game?
---
Looooool
---
Darn that would be nice
---
thanks but i'm also near the Italy rock through most of the time in fight caves. I assume there these npc's spawn at the same spots every time so there should be a guide of some sort. When I try finishing the rangers first I always end up untrapping the lvl 180
---
Wholedeerass
---
Nice
---
Jagex will never do real work lol
---
Amen brother, I too loved the quest. First got to play it about a year and a half ago. I felt the typical guilt you get when playing a game and make bad choices that would make the other npc mad, when I had to kill those paladins.
---
The story is what gets me. Lathas sends you on two whole quests that frame Tyras for dealings with Zamorak, and did it so well I was ready to finish Tyras and get a reward. But I just did Regicide a couple days ago and holy cow, what a plot twist. Working for the bad guys the whole time but not in the typical "rebel against them and come out a hero" story you get in spy movies. It's kept all under a blanket so well. I wonder what's gonna happen next. I don't know who to believe anymore.
---
Well made, but I physically cannot upvote this
---
Guess  a work around would be buying gold then buy a bond with said gold but you can get ban for rwt.
---
They would have to do it in phases: 
---
Phase 1: Shut down egregious offenders (ie borderline bots)
---
Phase 2: Hire/contract (and obviously pay) people that originally did work on the legitimate plugins. For bonus points, prevent a Mod Jed incident by isolating them from the rest of the team and allow them to work from home.
---
Phase 3: Poll new features to release to the official client.
---
Phase 4: Continue to work with the plugin creators, preferably recycling the content that they used.
---
Phase 5: Announce a date that ALL 3rd party clients will be replaced with the RS Client.
---
Phase 6: Roll in new client. Encourage plugin users to switch, and give a short time before issuing punishment.
---
This would obviously take a while, but it would be what I think is the most effective transition, and it helps the original people who worked on the plugins in the first place.
---
Thankfully, this sub doesn't actually represent the majority of players.
---
It’s only racist if you talk about the blacks or the yellows
---
they've been the core features of clients from the beginning, a majority of players love ground items plugin
---
it's very customizable and allows you to see specific items easier
---
***one of the many reasons why I hate player killers***
---
How’d you stay motivated all that time??
---
Gee you really love to say you have 99 con/fm banked, and call everyone NEETS everywhere
---
500k isn't a lot for a gold sink. If you can afford thousands of potions to fill the vat, 500k is nothing.

Here's the thing you need to understand about PvMers and Skillers vs. Pkers. 
---
PvMers and SKillers don't make anywhere near the amount of money, at the same rate, that Pkers do. Pkers are able to go out into the Wilderness make +1 mill in a single kill, sure sometimes it takes a while to get a worthwhile haul, but making, say 10 mill as a Pker, is infinitely faster than making the same amount as a PvMer or SKiller. 
---
PvMers might get SUPER lucky and get a really rare drop from a monster or boss that's worth way more then you could ever make Pking, but comparing the luck you would need to get said SUPER rare item with the time you invest, it's a lot  easier to just PK for that value.
---
Skillers are in an even worse position. Skilling is the least profitable method of making money out of the three. Skilling hasn't been updated in forever, so any methods of making money, while some are quite viable and decent, fall way behind that of PvM with it's rare drops, and Pking with it's lucky loot. Rightfully so, skilling unlike PVM and PvP doesn't risk a players items or life (unless you're in Wilderness) and so it shouldn't make as much as the other two. 
---
All this being said, that means that whatever money PvMers and SKillers make, is more precious and not so easily replaced as it is for Pkers, which is why they get angry when they spend 10 mill on dragon bones to use at the Chaos Alter only to have half of them taken by Pkers looking for easy kills. 10 Mill might be nothing to an experienced Pker, but it's still quite a bit, even to higher lvl PvMers and SKillers.
---
only once you use the dust on it
---
Main reason I use runelite is the Gpu feature. Something that should be in the main game but I don't see happening in the near future. If they added gpu, hiscores and ground overlays I would be fine with them banning 3rd party clients

---
Oak dungeon doors cap at like 400k per hour. You're limited by how fast your butler can fetch planks, even if you're not tick-perfect.
---
you can, may take you a few attempts. 
---
bp and best range gear, switching with trident and best mage gear.
---
zulrah is like 90% memory and 10% luck so if you commit to learning you will become more familiar with it over time. Otherwise you can pretty much bruteforce a kill if you have enough attempts
---
Since Ardougne is P2P they would be purely cosmetic. This is perfect.
---
If you die in F2P, can you lose your invisible pet?
---
Even with the left-click construction plugin you still need to manually tell the butler to get more planks by moving your mouse.
---
Would love to know that one too. Probably multi logging is frowned upon when you have several accounts. I just got encouraged by the rules themselves.
---
" You are free to create as **MANY** accounts as you like and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other legitimate player. "
---
I've seen them there and at ge. Honestly though if you've played long enough that youre consistently doing cox and you fall for this scam then no psa is going to help you, you're dumb.
---
You seem very invested in PvP, and probably know way more about it than I do, or the vast majority of PvM players. Why do you feel that the success of the game as a whole hinges on PvP?
---
I like the menu entry swapper as a QoL personally. I used to use it with my bones even before I knew how hard you could exploit them because I wanted to avoid burying them. For the most part it's a perfectly fine feature.
---
they already do by bringing gear. Jagex fucked this up by trying to force people to bring their banks into the wilderness.  Revs are a good example of how to do things right.  You bring minimal (or no) real risk, the only risk you have is the time spent in the rev caves that you havent banked.  
---
PvP and PvM deaths used to be the same risk and now they arent.  
---
People dont seem to understand that PKers are an intended mechanic to discourage people from doing that content.
---
Yes, but it allows you to get more kills per trip vs only using 4 doses of antivenom. So in the long run you make more profit using a serp helm over antivenom, especially if its only an extra 30k. Also, verac's helm degrades so repair costs tally up.
---
So basically how it works?:
---
- pop items in lootbag to open inventory for skilling.
---
- later on just die any old way? And have 60 min to go pick it all up?
---
Pretty nice
---
Panic buy kumquats
---
Exactly my point. They know it will cause outrage, but if they allow clients to get out of hand people will begin to change their minds (as they already are)
---
thank you for saying this im sick of people bitching about intended game mechanics.
---

---
if you don't have both kodai and torm, then use a prayer bonus cape over the ma2 cape because it won't give you a max hit
---
Assuming jagex sees shit like this, comments in joke posts that get upvotes this high, I'm hoping they take it as that many people will do the same. 
---
I aint got that much on my account but I wholeheartedly agree.
---
Rev caves but single combat.  
---
I like the idea of tossing it under the Mage Arena 2 and forcing it to be a mage-only dungeon.
---
Yup
---
Then pk in pvp worlds
---
&gt;skmitar
---
dragon defender is better than obby shield and also free (assuming OP means base 60s with some skills higher, rather than flat 60 combats)
---
dragon legs are unnecessary, especially at such a low budget
---
I tried clicking here to continue twice 🤦‍♂️
---
You bring in low level prey by offering a low risk high reward area. Jagex keeps freaking trying to get PvMers to bring their banks into the wilderness but the fact is the wilderness monsters should be LOW RISK and high reward.  Disencitivize them from banking and noob pkers will target them and the pro pkers will target the noob ones.  
---
PvP and PvM deaths also are now treated differently and thats changed the whole way the game is perceived.
---
29 upvotes and yet you’re wrong. Anyone who thinks attacking a player who’s geared for PvMing is somehow going to help them learn how to attack a player who’s willing and geared to fight back is either dumb or just not thinking.
---
this lol
---
So what's up with Zulrah? I see youtubers go there. I would just as well get low hp and poison myself in a safe spot closer to lumby.
---
hes prob just splashing on it
---
Not all pkers want to fight other pkers. Theres a whole heirarchy of skill in the wilderness.
---
You'll find the symbol at 2h town
---
I had a sliding puzzle during an escape room and was like “holy shit I’m using runescape skills in real life”
---
&gt; Moving PvP away from the Wilderness and into more structured programs with their own rewards -
---
This comment alone shows you have no idea wtf you are on about.  
---
LMS and Deadman have both shown forcing PKers to only target other PKers wont work.  Jagex needs to stop forcing players to bring their banks into the wilderness and do a low risk high reward SINGLE COMBAT area.  Maybe 2 or 3 in the wilderness.
---
Yep just like AHK, and still some things don’t have QoL changes like superheat item. That will give you carpal tunnel, and my wrist started to hurt within 30 minutes of superheat.
---
That spot isn't multi ;)
---
What situation? Sometimes this sub is like a fuckin TV show and I can't keep up
---
And thats what makes it great. This hierarchy and food chain keeps things interesting and gives everyone something to do regardless of skill level or risk.
---
true, didn't notice the chaos gauntlets first time
---
To put it short, I completely disagree with your comments on how to fix things.  
---
Jagex fucked this up by trying to force people to bring their banks into the wilderness. Revs are a good example of how to do things right. You bring minimal (or no) real risk as the bracelets arent required just helpful. the only risk you truely risk is the time spent in the rev caves that you havent yet banked.  This is how wilderness PvM luring should be done.  Not this Multicombat, hard as fuck bosses, or larrans key shit where the PvMer cant even fight back against a PKer. Put some new single combat monster spawns around the wilderness with bomb ass loot and you will see massive changes.  
---
I personally love catching black chinchompas because people attack me without me needing to skull. I can bring better gear, and risk next to nothing.  Ive pked multiple 20m+ full ahrims idiots who had no idea what they were doing and all I wanted to do was catch some chinchompas.  The point im trying to get it as claiming you cant fight back is an invalid argument. If you cant fight back against your opponent you didnt prepare for the wilderness activity properly.  
---
PvP and PvM deaths used to be the same risk and now they arent. This has caused a massive shift in players mentality towards PvP deaths and content because it is now MUCH more penalizing to die.
---
People dont seem to understand that PKers are an intended mechanic because the content itself is supposed to be really easy to farm.
---
How do I get my 3x3 poh to only have one layer of grass around it? It has an extra row on the south and east side and its driving me bonkers.
---
yikes
---
Zulrah, and some other bosses like Vorkath and Hespori, have an NPC that collects your loot when you die.  They'll hold onto your stuff until you collect it or die again. UIM use them as a sort of temporary bank. Bit risky though cause if you die you lose everything they're storing.
---

Making cig hoops because his hand is still moving and can't stop
---
I think you're missing my point as to why it can be considered good QoL if not for the fact it's exploitable;
---
Right click to bury = Good QoL
---
Left click to use for intention of sacrifice = Bad game integrity
---
I'm just saying that, for example, if you were a pure hearted individual that would never use this for the purpose of speeding up sacrificing bones then I can see how this could be good QoL
---
How bad is horrible? Blast mine is like 550k an hour with 75 mining, fishing is like 200k, but yeah wc is trash
---
I mean, they already got a great reference in RuneLite for what people want in a client. Use the plugins that are pretty much just QoL and just dont add in the "controversial" ones. It's that simple really.
---
Uhh ya that’s his point lol
---
He’s just saying that 3P clients are more useful for non-pvp stuff than pvp stuff

Isn't 13,5k points 28 rolls? First 500 points is 2 rolls.
---
Ha ha ha. Right on the head mate. I posted a suggestion a while back that would cause the skulled players to potentially risk an item from their bank. Wouldn't you believe it but they voted it down to oblivion because they really don't want PvP content that requires them to risk as much as their targets. They only want to be able to easily kill players, take their banks and yell the obscenities you mentioned.
---
Lol what a comical argument.
---
Joke is supposed to be 99 range not hunter
---
You cheeky noob, I'll find you in cc and kick your butt.
---
Suggestion: If Jagex does ban all third party clients they should try and buy the Runelite client and turn it into their official one by just taking out all the "controversial" plugins. I'd imagine they could buy it for cheap seeing that there's really no point for the owner of Runelite to not sell it to them (except out of spite) seeing that it'll be worthless anyways if it's banned.
---
i never posted an opinion about him at all.  i said he did not get views for his personality.  they watched for the content (guides and efficiency tips).  this has nothing to do with me liking him or not.
---
torvesta gets views for his personality, as a contrast.  people watch his content for him rather than for what hes doing.  autumn elegy just happened to not only not get his viewership from his personality (as in people dont really care about his opinion on anything other than giving them tips or learning how to 3t), but many people did not like him (his personality) despite using him to learn 3t etc.  so it's easy to hate train someone who doesn't really have any fans and does have some people who really dont like him.
---
that concept of pvpers doing non pvp activities won't get through the "us vs them" mentality of the people here
---
oh my days wot it's literally torvesta oh my god CMON ugh
---
Well Jagex has had their systems for nigh on 20 years now and they're still seemingly as adequate as they were back in the day.
---
So I don't see any changes on that front, hence my idea.
---
Ironman cc
---
So his post about these people wanting their cake and to eat it too is right. You want to do the activity AND kill anybody that attacks you. To say you have no chance to fight back in every situation is just ignorant.
---
This reminds me of how long I’ve been playing this game.... stop reminding me of my age.......
---
In bh worlds your target just teles to you mid fight and that's super cancer. Kinda unfortunate tbh
---
It's not ignorant, it's a fact. The thing is, it doesn't matter what me or you think, the problem still exists, that is pker vs pvmer in the wilderness and it's rivalry because of a broken concept of "pvp" that exists only there. Nobody likes being a victim, especially one that have close to no chance of fighting back (for fearing of skulltricking, or just because it's usually better to run anyways), so people will still vote "no" to pvp polls and the problem will never be addressed. 
---
I'm just trying to see why is there a problem in the first place. You can deny it, sure, but what's the point of denying it if you can't think of another cause for it?
---
Lol what activity requires u to bring ur bank pvming or what was suggested. Everything in wild right now is sub 100k with most being sub 10k. 
---
I agree there should be low risk high reward (for everyone on the food chain) but they havent ever pushed for high/med risk. 
---
Ok scorpia is over 100k. Was a terrific design back when shards were 3m+7m and cacti spines cost stuff.

ill give u 9m for them if youll accept payment in the form of fire runes
---
You know you can just say things without the childish insult thrown on the end?
---
This is about 100M FM xp worth of solos :D
---
Or maybe instead of such drastic changes they make it easier to fight back without getting skill tricked since apparently people are very afraid of that.
---
The only time you won't want to use a Slayer helm is when you're fighting undead creatures and using a salve (e/ei)
---
Basically. The bitter part don't mean shit when you can just integrity hotfix shit as needed and no one quits over anything. People are gonna cry for a week when Runelite gets banned along with all other third party clients and then get used to it. The only suicide attempt is letting shit go on for so long.
---
I mean look at the PvP council being proposed. All we're seeing are a buncha memes and no one quitting. The only players lost recently were because of WoW classic which was bound to happen regardless.
---
People just love to cry about everything and threaten to quit when they ain't gonna do shit in reality.
---
That would be a nice update
---
I just did it a couple days ago, haven’t ever done the 1 click before and managed it in two tries, not too bad tbh, you have a window of a few ticks to time it it
---
Why not have PVP toggleable in the wildy so before entering, you can choose to either have an attack option or not. If you do, you see better loots than current, if you dont have the option to be attacked, then you will recieve reduced loot.  
---
Have demi bosses fightable while safe, but wildy bosses are in areas that are always PVP.  
---
Fixes so much and allows everyone to be happy. People can enjoy wildy slayer and doing clues without fear of being hurt.
---
Fighting back isn't worth the increased risk + less inventory for e.g. bones. I can bring gear when I do a wildy clue step but why? I risk nothing with a dds/crystal bow, my clue and a spade.
---
I don’t even know how they caught unidan or why they bothered
---
Agreed, I didn’t realise this was all the things I that was wrong but I knew something wasn’t right.
---
Also, big side note - if people want to fight each other randomly while somebody is trying to skill or pvm, this should just belong in PVP WORLDS!
---
There are damn worlds dedicated to fighting each other while your going about your day, people logging into these worlds accept that risk. Maybe we should incentivise PvP worlds with slightly better drop rates? Then there is risk and reward and people choosing to do it...
---
I think a drastic change could be great though, being able to shake up the PvP scene with the support of the PvM community behind it. Being able to add in new content to the wilderness that encourages killing other players that also want to kill players themselves. There are so many possibilities/opportunities for great content if you just wipe the slate clean of all the PvM garbage in the wilderness. Half the shit is broken lured bosses, and the other half is broken xp rates. Clean house, and build it the right way around the community in my opinion.
---
Thanks for giving Jagex money.
---
Na, i fought him twice he's not using an autoswitcher.
---
Bossing with multiple accounts at the same time is alot tougher than you would think. Also while stuff like bandos would be doable raids are impossible
---
I was the fastest typer in my class at 80wpm using just my two index fingers. I then ascended by learning how to use asdf/jkl; while I was there.  After that i was at 140. Would do assignment then sleep for an hour while everyone else was at like 20-40 wpm. Good times. No one could do 80 even after the semester ended...
---
You mean the cheat client runelite ? because runelite has this aswel, only not visual on your charachter.
---
How much harder is pking on vanilla client than on Runelite?
---
How did you think this was news worthy to anyone?
---
I’d quit.
---
&gt;Bring the downvotes
---
As you wish.
---
 Chad.
---
Oh yeah because it's so fun being barraged.
---
You're wrong, you just don't see the forest for the trees. It cuts down some bullshit on some skills while the endgame is still impressive, Max cape.
---
It doesn’t matter both remove clicks why is one the lesser evil? Just because one takes more effort it still doesn’t take away the fact that it reduces the number of actions used which is one of the main argument against these other op plugins lol. 
---
Look I’m not saying these plugins are not OP I’m just saying that MES functions the same way fundamentally
---
Which is why they introduced eoc which then killed the game
---
Subscription was still running :(
---
I've haven't  seen something so misguided and blatantly wrong as this in a long time. You clearly don't understand the PvP scene whatsoever. I hope Jmods aren't listening to this.
---
Yea, it would make it less responsive. And how would you search for items that are in another tab if they aren't loaded? Honestly though, to me the whole bank system seems quite impressive even by modern standards. You can have 800 different items and up to 2 billion items in a stack.
---
I use the default client, but I understand that people would be hesitant to switch even if it was improved. Out of curiousity what clients would you need in a new default client if you were to switch?
---
I think it’s pretty fucked up. even though that acc is funny as fuck, I hate when he does that shit
---
I know, because most are clueless about survival, player indicator plugins, min max gear...
---
pkers risk nothing to be fair, whats 600k "full geared"
---
self defence needs incentives &gt;&gt; just getting away
---
You’re in denial 😂
---
Post below your favorite memory of RuneScape.
---
Mine: After years of grinding I was finally able to enjoy the game until they took out the wilderness which became the result of me quitting and finding myself in a mysterious place called NRPK where I met some of my closest runescape and online gaming buddies. Who to this day we game together and play OSRS and others.      
---
Also the picture post is from a forum signature I really admired.  I actually miss when people did this Microsoft paint runescape art
---
Between 1 and a number
---
Johnny tsunami you mean? Yeh man he’s clan warlord
---
Whoa, not everyone is richy mc rich
---
so you take out the potions, decant them into 4-dose and go out on a trip and you come back with a few 4 dose potions, a 3 dose potion and two 2 dose potions
---
do you then have to trek all the way back to the GE to decant those into 1dose again before you can bank?
---
Great video! Can't wait for more. Definitely going to bring exposure to the game/community.
---
Could we change relics into a race or class system? That would add more of an RPG feel into the game mode.
---
This post gave me anxiety
---
:P weapon/body/legs is 1 more switch than void, and you have a lower chance of being instantly stacked out
---
I personally think you should have to bow  to initiate a pvp battle and if the person wants to fight they bow back.
---
But youre right the wilderness is just pkers attackin pvmer/clue hunters/skillers 
---
Only time pkers fight other pkers is when they run into them while searching for pvmers.
---
And to be honest bossing isnt even worth the risk besides pets. Why should i risk being attacked by "Ragbolter420" for less gp when i can comfortably kill vorkath without fear.
---
Looking to make a return to the game and build a range tank. Has the meta changed at all? They still viable? Cheers
---
Light all 4 til WT is 5-10% then stay on one brazier til 13.5k pts
---
Every time at zulrah I always drag my 3rd item on my switch it's well annoying because I am clicking and not holding it down at all, ive bought a new mouse and stood at bank just switching and nothings changed its doing my head. There's no setting on windows cos I'd rather press like shift to be able to drag something instead
---
Things would be tweaked of course, like rev cave having gas so potent you couldn't stay for more than 7 minutes or something so people cant camp the place. Probably a poor solution but a good example. It's not fitting when you have this whole world and then boom, an open pvp area. People keep saying pvp is dying and it's because no one wants to go into the wilderness, so they have to keep putting content there to keep people from completely abandoning it. It's not pvp, it's people geared to pk vs people geared to pvm
---
Wrong name
---
True, I definitely see that happening. But hey, it'd still be better than the vanilla client.
---
Spoiled.
---
No pet?
---
The game would be fine tbh... just the truth.
---
Dope, pineapples or just cook food there?
---
Funny how this sub like to complain about keeping things oldschool yet fight for their futuristic client with a thousand plugins.
---
Old osrs was dying before they started updating it.  Maybe you want KQ to be the pinnacle of end game content but most people don’t.
---
2nd person today?
---
I never said you did, just called you a brainlet. Still feeling pretty confident in that assertion.
---
it is?
---
Since nobodies given it up yet:
---
Construction skill just came out, unpolished but still very releasable.
---
Somebody realized when teleporting from inside of a combat ring, pvp did not disable.
---
Thusly, a few high level people were able to kill any and everyone in falador for a short period of time indiscriminate of their levels. 
---
Did I get any part of that wrong? It has been over 13 years
---
By that logic, boss plugins shouldnt be banned since after learning a boss and doing it a hundred times you've already mastered it and it gets boring
---
So how are you planning on killing bosses in that gear?
---
Looking at this makes me feel sick
---
when the crop is shite so you don't bother.
---
Who would even downvote your comment
---
Had a Moto Z to start. Switched to a Pixel 3XL
---
Crabs. 11 dollars and all that jazz
---
How long would you say my kill times would be, because the guides say 75/75 is fine to start with. My barrows runs with iban blast are 5min roughly.
---
*me returning from Area 51 with tears that hive you XP in the highest skill*
---
&gt;buffing entangle would change that from 5 times a day to UNLIMITED times a day.
---
i don't think you understand the difference between a 15 sec freeze that does 0 damage, has a longer casting animation making it easier for your enemy to gap you, has a cooldown feature that blocks you from casting the spell &amp; wasting combat ticks and a 20 sec freeze with a 30 base maxhit and featuring none of these limitations. 
---
&gt;From what I've seen though my own experience as well as lots of youtube videos. Unless you're in a PvP world, Pkers vs PvM is significantly more common that Pker vs Pker. (Revs, Callisto, Wilderness Slayer/Agility, KBD, etc, the list goes on)
---
your evidence seems anecdotal aswell if you're referring to pk videos - all which cut out the waiting periods, only feature the best loots &amp; clips, don't show the times where the pker died often times etc. it all also depends where you're currently located in the wilderness - telespots usually have pkers around at all times. and don't forget about the wilderness foodchain.
---
&gt;Its not that our opinion is more worthy. Its that we have an opinion at all. If there is nothing but negatives to an update for a PvMer, it makes sense that PvMers wouldnt want the update to pass and would vote no.
---
you're right, it makes perfect sense. why wouldn't a clueless player vote entirely in their self-interest - it's human nature in general. but that is exactly the reason why certain issues shouldn't be put on a public vote - it's because people who don't understand the problems and only vote in their self-interest are inherently toxic for the games longevity. just imagine if they polled each and every integrity change - almost every single one of them would've failed because of these reasons.
---
the pvp council would solve this issue of uneducated people deciding matters by popular vote and would leave the decisions among experts on the matter. and as the final decision would still be made by jagex, there shouldn't be too much fear about updates that would only benefit specific individuals - i.e "let's revert changes to dragon spears" etc.
---
👊💥
---
Edit: should I just play EOC?
---
I would feel so filthy. It would hurt my feelings to play a split game. I know for a fact playing EOC I could NEVER claim that I play Runescape !
---
You could have range only, melee only, and magic only caves where protection prayers don't work to force people to fight in only one style so as to force people to just practice one type as an introduction.
---
Nah mate
---
Where’s the rest?
---
Just clean your fucking bank
---
I’n not a bot, but I’ve been cutting teaks for two hours and am commenting during my smoke break.
---
I'd still take it
---
Chjöp chjöp
---
I remember spending 900k on a d med, my entire bank
---
Yeah I completely agree with you that the game needs to evolve and add new content to keep people interested. Raids/slayer bosses etc are great for end game content and they should be in the game. My issue with the game right now is I think getting from new player to end game isn’t even difficult anymore. You can afk NMZ to max combat in a couple of weeks. Splash your way to 99 magic almost completely afk. And now they have things like blast furnace/tithe farm and wintertodt which just makes it too easy in my opinion. I just wish they’d make getting to endgame hard again. And not everyone was a kid back in 2007.
---
 r/boneappleteeth
---
Don't worry. Our mobile new friends outnumber us now, so the "a lot of clicking" will only be true for one more year tops. Making the game play itself while getting tick manipulation xp rates is just mere QoL after all. Wouldn't want to be too sweaty!
---
I don't think you read my original point.
---
Oh boy you sound like someone who would call other clan members "opps"
---
Would love this
---
OSRS &gt; Ultima
---
Fite me
---
Keep up the awsome grind! Been following your progress for a while now
---
Well I don't claim to be good at the game myself, but find something you like doing and just go for that. If you like killing things then go round doing that for a while with perhaps a map of monster locations until you start to learn them ultimately trying your hand at slayer. If you like to quest then it's usually quickest with guides but if not there is usually enough text in the quest to complete the quests with the help of the quest log in game. And finally if you enjoy skilling just pick one you like and start doing that, experiment on different methods until you find one you like best. This game will get boring fast if you aren't doing stuff you like. That's why the guides are there, the quests can be a bit of a slog without them unless you enjoy them.
---
Just play the game that you want the play and play it in the way that you enjoy the most. Don't feel ba for playing EOC, it gets more shit than it deserves, the gameplay is actually really fun. And don't be afraid to look up guides.
---
Enjoy the game :)
---
I will cry

You can actually drop a good portion of a tribrid setup and run back within 2 or 3 minutes if you know you're about to die. The idea is to make as much as your setup untradeable as possible like spending 60k on a d boots ornament kit, you can drop the d boots (g) and nobody will see it.
---
Not talking about overnight, why can't Jagex put more people on the engine team? and with loading it would load as fast as opening a shop interface. The only reason I could see why the client can't handle an array of 1000+ objects that are little more than an id and amount is that they load all the sprites at once too.
---
Thats 16 hours a day that they wont be able to work on in-game updates
---
Underground pass to get Iban Blast + Occult Necklace (800kish) for barrows. with mediocre magic you can still tear through them pretty well with Ibans Blast.
---
If you want to train magic high alching yew longbows is pretty profitless but not a huge profitloss either.
---
Such a gay insult
---
But...did he get the pet?
---
It actually does the opposite.
---
Prices of the items rise because people want to be able to loan out the item for profit.
---
You posted something online about why people argue online without any point? Please re-read your own crap and you know why.
---
Right so challenging I can go AFK in NMZ for 20 hours and do these quests in a blink of an eye.
---
I never said clicking and running around agility is challenging its dedication you dumbfuck learn the difference.

You are in need of some help IRL it seems because you have issues reading.

I’m still a Zulrah noob but I’m guessing that either they think it’s dead and it’s not and don’t switch prayers, or get hit hard by the range attack in tanzanite form (you pray mage during this form but it can still attack with range and hit 30+)
---
The range attack can also be combined with attacks from the snakelings so you can get stacked out for 50/60 damage if you’re unlucky or get multiple range attacks in a row
---
You would have to download the source of a private server for that.
---
Pay for membership with IRL for the first 2-3 months. Having money early on is gonna help you so much in the long run.
---
That is exactly how I'll feel if I ever get one

i mean calling it not a real term is kind of silly, words get created for all kinds of things and with consistent use become a part of the language. the use of the term photobashing is common enough to the point where id say it's reasonably classified as a 'real term'

you could say the same thing about overpainting, it's not overpainting, it's painting over something, same thing, seems pretty dumb hey haha

Iron man on rs3 is pretty sick. One big thing I’ll say, the community since it’s a lot smaller is so much nicer. Like you’ll find the odd dick but pretty much every bit of content in game people are willing to help you out, and people share wealth for stuff like it’s Christmas. Big issue on osrs is the wall you have to break through to join Cox/tob cuz of elitists etc and that’s the only late game pvm worth doing
---
Nothing would crash, increase if anything. Chambers drops, ToB drops, Zulrah, Demonic Gorillas, etc. anything with a decent learning curve that the clients have devalued.
---
But Google does exist. And people will use it solve clues if the plugin didn't exist. So removing the plugin has no effect other than annoying people by removing the convenience. So you're not making people solve clues the old fashioned way by removing the plugin, you're just making them spend 5 extra seconds Googling, so it serves no purpose to remove the plugin. 
---
This isn't the same as making a macro that does something in-game for you, which wouldn't normally be possible in one click.
---
Can I buy runecoins with EBT??? Pls

They're not very popular, but a range tank is definitely viable. Torvesta recently did a video using a ranged tank and had some success with it.
---
Wow that’s not cool.
---
Zulrah is much more gp.per.hour then barrows. But takes forever to learn easy a few weeks of deaths unless you play everyday.
---
Thanks! And grats on your achievement! That seems so far away! My next step is 70 all skills and so you’re many steps ahead of me. I only get to play a few hours here and there on my mobile!
---
out of spite?
---
??? Pkers typically have to risk more than pvmers in wildy. You clearly don’t have no idea what you are talking about. The most complained about scenario on this sub is a pker killing someone doing a clue risking nothing. The pker risks more in tunes than the target usually does. Let’s look at another example, a main level pker attacking someone doing black chins, almost always the pker has to risk mystics to catch freezes on someone in black dhides so unless the chin hunter hasn’t banked for hours, the pker is risking more. Sure you can be a fucking shitter in salad robes and attack someone tanking in armadyl top/bottom and a bulwark but you’re at a minuscule chance of ever killing the dude. Most of the time, pvmers don’t risk jack shit and they are complaining about the time and effort wasted tanking the pker for a bit and teleporting out to rebank.
---
Congrats on passing your first class of compsci, but that's not at all how it works.
---
Firstly, the engine team is split between both games and attracting engine developers is hard enough, then they get lower salaries than jumping to some start up or market leader, as well as having to dredge through antique code.
---
Secondly, the items aren't displayed as sprites, they are fully rendered items that are displayed from an angle that makes them look like sprites. Can't thing of any exceptions, but there might be.
---
Finally, if it's that easy, go join them or post the code on Twitter @JagexAtlas before he leaves so he can slap it in.
---
If they could fix the issue, they would. 816 is the limit they can make it load reasonably at the moment, it's not some arbitrary number they plucked from the air.
---

I don't understand how people are acting like OSB is this big bad monster killing the game when RL+ has been doing it for months
---
Coke and bal
---
Need to train some attack levels so you can hit the fucking thing
---
Osb devs said they ran it past mods first before publishing it
---
Single combat teams are more like a couple of dudes in max gear and 50 other leech members who box NPCs.
---
Thats a blatant lie though. People hunting the pvmers might only risk that or people who are out ragging other fights but that's not a true representation of what pkers tend to risk. Feel free to visit any clan site or discord (single or multi) and see what their gear requirements are.
---
You made a reddit account for this, outstanding move
---
Link this when you’re begging Weath to look at your banned account.
---
I somt think the community could decide on that. Who gets to pick?is it yet again another UK world? Even the bh and pvp worlds rotate. I mean I get what you are saying but most pkers are seeking other pkers deep. They just cant find many people and attack anyone they see. Also some pvmers/skillers/clue hunters carry ridiculous risk. I pked a naked dude for a 21m cash stack. Homie was buying a burning amulet at g.e and didn't bank it.
---
h
---
It was actually Dragon Slayer 2, Part 2.

If only more bank space was a thing. Even with membs I don’t have enough space.

I bet you the overlords have stopped them from making group Ironman, and they’ll release when play count drops to increase it back up again

Ahrim's robetop and robeskirt are like 3.7m combined, that's not a cheap risk at all. People who clan might bring an expensive +1 but they're rarely wearing karil's or serp helm in addition, it's usually d'hide and nezzy helm.

Thanks!

I feel like all this needs is like even more over the top zoom ins and even camera shakes, maybe super epic orchestral music to just to waaaayy over hype just clicking and such.

You should definitely release it as a trailer (ps jagex take notes)

I lure and am always at the grand exchange looking for potential targets. Meaning that I constantly hop from world to world, right clicking everyone, looking for specific combat levels. It is unbelievable how many people just stand around at GE doing absolutely nothing.. except for trying to show off their accounts. That and orbiting “females”. Some people I actually feel sorry for, most of which have the ol’ infernal cape and tbow.. just standing there.. all day, everyday.. hoping for a compliment. The character I use to target potential victims is of course female.. whenever you try to lure these guys they literally spam click the log out button at grand exchange the second they feel as if someone’s trying to scam or lure them. I sometimes try to imagine what they look like irl..

---
No u
---
Ouch, your insults tear through my very soul!  So you're saying its like 80 seconds or whatnot. Thats a lot longer than previously implied.
---
But suddenly you're saying that the discussed accounts are both sub-mid level (below 1250)and at the same time relatively higher level that can bother with trying out pvp. And earlier you were calling 75 mid level and now all of a sudden its a low level. Im getting mixed messages here and it looks like you are hand picking level and ability based on wether we are talking about transportation or the actual killing. You keep calling it lower and lower and when told low levels dont have the means they suddenly get upped to higher med levels. Like the "week of casual agility". Thats something the higher echelon will posess but the lower wont. And yet they are simultaneously the same and different types of players we're talking about here, if what you say is to be believed. Please read your own writings again carefully and tell me you're not contradicting yourself?
---
Add to that the fact that it started off with "almost any mid-high level boss" and we've since narrowed it down to 1 or 2 arguably higher level bosses that are viable for the scrubs.
---
Im starting to seriously question the integrity of this story you've constructed.
---
Ok I will then

Only ban is jumping on the band wagon and using it before you get banned

Why play a game if you just find it “bearable”? Find something better to do with your time then waisting it doing something that you don’t enjoy.

It was pretty buggy so they scrapped it. Doubt it would make a come back for the 3rd time.
---
You’re from Venezuela? I’ll probably end up selling my gold to you when I’m done luring
---
Do they ban you for stumbling onto it or do they ban you for stumbing onto it, abusing it, THEN reporting it?
---
facts
---
4m is massive loot for the average pker?
---
when i was a kid and played classic it was even more interesting because you couldnt leave combat until after 3 hits
---
Hmm, seems like you were heavily implying it. My bad though
---
Huh. I don't know why people hate PC so much, it's quite chill. Drop in, run to your favourite portal(mine was always blue/yellow), kill shit mobs, kill the portal and repeat. Very low intensity and can easily watch content on the side.
---
Chompies i somehow stomached, i did it to 35 for easy, then to 100 for medium and 300 or whatever it was for hard. Can't go for the maximum milestone at the start or you'll burn out quickly.

Aw I miss this. F2P clan wars was so fun

When I had low mage I struggled to get the dps down with void mage, try using ahrims if your 70 defence but mystics will be still better than void. And definitely use a toxic trident.
---
A small portion of the osrs playerbase is Apple mobile.
---
600k in 15 minutes is entirely achievable by a mid level account I gave you the kill times even added in banking times and at most your still spending a max of 18 minutes, you are being an argumentative cunt just to be a cunt. You are trying to argue low level accounts (Under 1k total) are doing this content to go pk both of which are dumb points to even be trying to make because no one at that level is going pking unless they are a mains alt account pure, at 1250-1500 total level (low --&gt; mid level) the times I gave you are accurate. If an account has access to zulrah/vorkath and the gear to do it they have the other very low stats to hit these times.
---
Then they log off and cry themselves to sleep
---
Only if there's a chance it explodes and you lose it.
---
yess man fuck the single teams
---
nice post. The only issues I have with it, is it kind of had that feeling like this is why Pvp is broken, but in fact I would say that the bullet points you mentioned are the minority. Like, its not really a Pvp thing, its a cheating thing. All these things are very much so against the rules. 
---
We need more emphasis on Anti-cheat focused solely on the wild. So I think you actually hit the nail on the head. The wild would be a lot more active and fair if only the cheating wasn't so prevalent. 
---
The problem isn't the Pvp, its the cheating.
---
No worries. I’ve been there/am there so I understand. Keep your head up and one step at a time.
---
I remember staying up super late when my parents were asleep just walking around and telling my friend in PM's how scary it is, we would just walk around all the time looking for stuff we've never seen before, don't remember his name, but I wonder if he remembers me, because travelling through the wildy as a young kid is definitely some of the most memorable moments I had
---
Well that True but pvp also make it awesome to be pvm in willdy becaus it is dangerous which give US *afraid feeling while Being exciting*
---
Good job on the models
---
Its actually Dartifact, the dragon slayer card game.
---
Sick repost
---
I agree; people can say it’s “macroing” and not botting, but Jagex has been very clear on their stance of anything that reduces the number of clicks/mouse movements the player has to do to achieve their goal. It’s the same as an auto clicker: it’s not a bot script but it’s still bannable and so should be this new OSB feature.
---
I called bullshit and the bullshit has been proven. Let it lie, my friend.
---
Yeah they said they didn’t know, but were trying to get as much information as they could, things like seeing how people with high numbers of BH kills voted compared to people with none, that sort of thing. 
---
So basically they’re trying to understand who voted for what to find if there are any trends like what OP claims.
---
The main reason I dont like mobile is because it's the base client. RL got me spoiled.
---
Oh so it has to swap prayers *and* not fight back lmao. No wonder so many pkers are dog shit, their practice doesn’t even hit back.
---
Alch yourself mate
---
I this the paid version of OSBuddy?
---
That I can understand.
---
You can go to it in f2p, just can't enter due to a hurdle. Should be a simple fix, yes?
---
Guy with chefs hat is rotated even more than that?
---
You all see the analogy here is that behind that player is a lone person doing nothing with his life but clicking an imaginary crab. Maybe one day the player will hang his helmet and go out into the world, and not as a pro of runescape but a noob leaving tutorial island.
---
After my farm run tonight I'll be over 26,068,862 farming xp. I'll have gotten tue equivalent of 99 twice in farming before getting any other 99 and still no pet.
---
Literally all I do any more is farm runs. I just want the pet so I can quit playing this game already.
---
Oh I totally understand that you're saying it's a possibility.
---
I agree with that. I just find it to be a highly unlikely possibility. Ever since RL's popularity spiked, being free and offering features OSBuddy charged for, OSBuddy has been on the back foot.
---
When Jagex threatened Runelite, they fixed what Jagex wanted and complied, but the community pulled through and called jagex out on their bullshit by attacking runelite (free) and not OSbuddy (free and paid options). Jagex backed down.
---
Sure, nothing says they can't just do what they want (integrity changes lol), but they really do have to be careful of the community's backlash. 
---
The way I see it: if they threaten runelite again, they're going to be bashed on once again, and I myself find playing on the normal client to be... unbarable.
---
Time to ban all third party users ever I guess.  Menu entry swapper is literally the exact same thing by no longer having to right click.
---
Not saying it wouldn’t, I mean they dont hurt me whether it’s added or not.
---
Don't you mean spiraled to the right? If they would spiral to the left it would mean their right hand is furthest from the pillar of the stairs.
---
Wow a whole 30 minutes? Savage bro

Are you living in 2004
---
I wanted the boss to be farmable for players. The random Spawns are more for pkers themselves. They can come across the boss while looking for other players, kill the boss and receive the amulet to get a buff for a while, as well as a chance for good loot
---
Since the amulet is a 100% drop i dont think it needs more value.
---
Oh and I forgot to mention, for text.. this is a bit long to do.. but I will tell you now in case you wonder how to do it. You need to download Runescape UF font. After you did so, and installed it, go to word. Write your text, make it big like 36 size. Then, change font to the Runescape font. From there, you can change text colour to yellow.. or for even better accuracy, you can do this: go on runescape, type something, print screen so you have a photo with you saying something random. Then, go to paint. Post the screen you printed there. With the pen thing, click on the yellow text to get the colour it is. Write the colour code down. Then go to lunapic, upload the text photo, and replace colour. Type the colour code there, click the text, replace colour, adjust it, apply. Then go to transparent background and remove the white. Apply. Now you have one sprite of text. As you saw in the video, it took an eternity me doing that. It’s lots of work... but sometimes it’s worth it :) it takes trial and error sometimes when you click on text, as it doesn’t replace all sometimes.
---
Haha cool man ;)

i can’t speak for everyone but most of us have grown up and work jobs and when i come home from work i just wanna relax and play some rs and some of the runelite features just make the gameplay more smooth and enjoyable

Okay.

The legal system in China is completely opaque, sure there is no law that expresses that there shouldn't be skeletons in game. But to a publisher the 'fear' of having their game removed from a market of 1.2b people due to legal backlash and consequently censoring it is the same as just having a legally defined law.
---
Okay, that's still what I do soooo
---
Thank you!

You say that as if its some kind of outlandish idea, when in reality Runescape is in the minority. Obviously it wont happen, because its been the way it is for so long that people eother forgot or didnt realize that one account per PAID user is pretty ridiculous.
---
That's only 1 item
---
The problem with your logic is that you're ignoring all the other rolls on the table. It also has a flawed utility function for discussing profit, since it uses profit as a tiebreaker when XP is the same and ignores it otherwise. 
---
I'm not saying "I can get 30 magic seeds in an hour". I'm saying that turning in 30 warm gloves is like getting an hour's profit with normal rolls, and the alternative is simply keeping them for seeds. Yes, one hour of WT won't give you 30 sets of gloves. I know that. But 30 sets of gloves is an hour's profit, and 30 magic seeds is far better than an hour's profit.
---
Please look up "opportunity cost".

closest casino to me is a couple hours aways as gambling is illegal in my state so we have to go to the neighboring one. I play online black jack a lot tho at work
---
It's different when 1 character can do literally anything in the game. It's not like other MMOs where you have classes and are limited in what you can do on a single character. If I roll a warrior in other games, I'm a warrior. In RS I switch my weapons to whatever I feel like at the time.
---
Not uk bro
---
Really? Apparently I didn't look up Ham joint's price well enough.
---
But I believe that's the thing, or maybe the style: Swift blade is capable to stab and slash, but not crush like joint can.
---
Ps: I find it silly how Swift blade is faster to use than other weapons, from realism perceptive. Even regular daggers are smaller AND 3x lighter than Swift blade.
---
Maintaining a community of 100k+ people, regardless of the context, opens the door to profit in many different ways, I don't follow them close enough to know if they are currently capitalizing on their playerbase though
---
Holy shit you are one lucky fucking dog. that's a lot of uniques considering your still only 1/3 way to drop rate!
---
I spent 1.2m on mine after weeks of chopping yews. Kept chopping yews until I could afford a Saradomin platebody, platelegs, a dragon square shield with a dragon battleaxe to top it off. Gods I was strong then...

There’s some videos on YouTube about it.
---
Huh, that does make sense. Why disturb one's mind with hobbies when their point is to relax it?
---
No it doesn’t. 
---
The quantity of those buying to loan was shallow in comparison to the masses of mid to high tier accounts that opted to loan instead of buy. It has huge ramifications on the market and is an all round terrible idea.
---
Left click bj has been around for a long time, osb wouldnt add plugins that are bannable
---
It wouldn't happen. It could make sense as a premium type fee where you can only log into one account at a time. Multi-loggers would still get multiple memberships. I personally know casual players that would probably take advantage of that but never ever buy two+ memberships at the same time.
---
Again, I'm not trying to say this would ever actually happen or anything.
---
OK and now look at your two examples. One is a skiller and one is a clue hunter. Neither of those is a PvMer so get outta here with that logic. Most PvMers risk more than most PKers, this is a fact. It also happens to be that most PvMers are at rev caves so this is an undisputed fact.
---
I like the concept of Rev caves, but it kind of just turns into me running into a PKer or massive clan honestly too often for it to be worth it. On paper, rev caves are absolutely insane gp an hour. In reality, you're running from being killed pretty much every 5-10 minutes.
---
As for turning PvMers into PKers, you're probably just going to turn PKers into into PvMers.
---
The real best thing they designed was wilderness slayer. It just happens to require you to complete 5 tasks before you even see points, so that turns a lot of people off.

Yes it does. Download the APK off your phone using estrongs file explorer. Move it to your chromebook. Done.

Nice vids I subbed
---
Yep all same drop rate
---
I understand. I’m still most likely voting “no” across the board because I don’t want dev time going towards some cosmetic bullshit when there are so many updates that *need* to be made in main game. This seems like a huge distractor and a huge waste of time.
---
Last bullet point is such a good point.  The only time players ever have to lose anything is when they die to a pker.  Death and loss used to be pretty common, and people were therefore ready to take responsibility instead of blaming others.  
---
For the record, I'm not a pker and rarely enter the wildy, but I'm very bothered by this whole mentality on reddit that identifying as a "pvmer" should somehow entitle you to safety.  That was never how my RuneScape worked...
---
Sure, but I bet half of all ironmen wouldn't link accounts so they can continue multiboxing. That's a huge part of rs alts
---
So arbitrary rules people choose to impose once they get bored of the base game? Yeah that falls under "you need a second sub for a second account."
---
No, you turned 4.2m to 30 rolls both are just things with value, it doesn't matter how long it takes to get them rolls if you aren't Ironman. So you basically lost 4.2m in 30hours  which isn't fucking 2.4m
---
Would you look at that, nice find
---

The sad thing is that this scam must be working since it's so popular. I see it constantly at the arena and at the ge.
---
2006scape had 500k+ signups before even fully being opened, and it was advertised by everybody in the pking community. If you were in a pking stream/yt comment section, people were talking about 2006scape. PvMers and skillers were fine with eoc. Literally nobody would sign up for 2006scape to pvm/skill, it was just popular because of pkers. *in fact, if you search up reddit posts from 6-7yrs ago, you can see PvMers and skillers shitting on the idea altogether
---
So yeah it's what I think because it's true? After jagex shut 2006scape down, they announced osrs shortly after. And again, the osrs voting was 100% advertised by pkers. Without pkers there would be no osrs
---
What is opportunity cost anyway, right??

runelite has staight up banned from them entering to their main client, nothing prevents somebody making their own fork from runelite and add plugins they want.
---
I wish at least that an Ironman could be tied to membership on an account, since they can't exactly trade anything or be used to make money for your main.
---
My spot. I was here first. Please hop bro, I was just resetting.

Good find - I think they might say they meant they don’t poll changes to Dmm.

But.. they do that too (g.e.)

Any time u got money for it and range gear and wish you had it. You will earn the money back. Just do it if you want it.

What an unnecessary comment.
---
So you went into an area where players are supposed to attack and kill other players, and then you got attacked and killed by another player. It's not some machismo thing, it's the entire purpose of the wilderness, to fucking kill other players. Nobody gets a free pass because they ask nicely, holy fuck.
---
how are pvmers this entitled, I don't understand
---
"I'm getting my main."
---
Lol the plugins are what people are upset about.  Why would it solve anything to move them to the main client?
---
I respect that runecrafting level
---
Penalize players that macro, and tell OSB to remove the feature.
---
I love this!
---
depends on the npc
---
Nah, look at the comments. Most of the community is too fucking stupid to realize the damage it would cause. Too many comments on here: "IM FINE AS LONG AS I GET GOLDEN DOGGO HURR DURR"

I hate stupid people so god damn much

This is awesome! You should do commissions!

Actually, Jagex made it clear that they don't believe in the spite-voting theory.  Personally, I agree with what you're saying as do most people.  Reddit would have you believe that all pvp updates would get 0%, Warding would get 100%, etc.  It's not the reality, and Jagex knows this luckily.
---
I am not in support because I know alot of features I like from runelite will not make it over to default client. Like menu swapper and Mark tile
---
Just make it so you can only be logged into one at a time.

It was never a "grey area". When you are banned for botting, it's literally listed as "Macro - Major/Minor". Under the rules, they are both treated the same and are thus bannable. At no point in RS history was macro'ing to "save movement patterns" a "grey area", and you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about if that's really what you think.
---
Lol fucking loser OSB devs are mad as fuck so they did this to get back at runelite, immature pieces of shit
---
Am I the only one who thinks this is a waste of dev time?
---
By RS I meant Jagex. 
---
And OS Buddy being closed code was good, not bad. It prevented people from making unauthorized plugins and made it significantly more secure. 
---
OS Buddy never had a breach where player info was stolen. To date, Runelite has had several.

---
It already has that, if you go to the settings in game it has exactly what your asking   - and this more directed to the new OSB enhanced features that,  for one example, lets u click on a log to light it (instead of using a tinder box in it)
---
menu entry swapper has always been the one thing that felt too far for me in runelite. Like it literally removes an action you'd otherwise have to do, I don't know how it's allowed.
---
Brilliant
---
Electronic and digitial billboards ussually have like some glaring led and pixelated lights to stay back against the sun like a road sign. No way it's real and come out looking like that in the sun without some intense glare or a 60 foot wide plasma tv board, but it is pretty cool.

Runelite doesn't have Freeze timers multi lines etc but nice try, I don't really care which client you use but at least be honest about what it is ;)

oh cool, haven't played in a while off of runelite

The Fighting Mongooses
---
It is outlandish for Jagex. They don't want to lose the $44/mo they make from people like me who play 4 accounts (not at the same time).
---
Just wanted to say, you're speaking about 'people' whilst talking about your opinion. Not everyone in this game plays it just to progress and level up, some people like me play for fun as it's a video game, not a chore!
---
If you only view this game as 'clicking the same thing for 4 hours a day' then you probably should consider quitting, unless that's what you find fun. This is a form of entertainment, and as I said in the post, it can be fun to mix up the grind. Not everything has to be in the name of progress! 
---
That being said, your lack of enjoyment of the game is yours, and differs from other people's, so if it's not your thing then just don't play it, no harm done

It's a finger, right?

Remember guys, /r/2007scape says it's mere QoL so this is fine! Bunch of ezscapers that were attracted to the funny autism on Twitch and Reddit have become the majority and Jagex has decided to focus on them. Nothing will be done about this; even this is considered to be tedious by the modern mobile gamer.
---
 This game is dead. This community is dead. Jagex is dead.
---
The average estimate is 15 exactly between 12-18 you dumb cunt. I kill zulrah in 1 minute so 600k takes me 6 minutes, a mid level account can pull 2 minute kills hitting 600k in 12 minutes with 3-4 kill trips before banking. Your assuming a low mid level account cant figure out a rotation and minimize damage it isn't hard.
---
Because it's a cheap low effort TRASH update that is made to get people to buy membership for multiple accounts. They don't want to risk free revenue failing a poll.

I’ve thought about this before and really think it should happen.  Idk about making multiple characters on one membership but I’d be down for a discount so it’d be more affordable to play my main and pure

I'm sorry would you rather 10m or nothing?

One of my “friends” I knew in real life gave me one of his alts and I remember playin on that account for like close to a year before i was suddenly locked out of it. Had to beg my dad for membership and everything (I was 10).

---
  It still puts you at risk of punishment for macroing. A macro that turns a multi-click action into a single click action (regardless of whether you wrote the macro yourself or got it through a third party client like OSB) is a pretty blatant violation of the macro/bot rules. Use at your own risk.
---
one small favour, every aspect of it was so enjoyable.
---
yeah i farmed hydras till close to 99 and missed getting black demons, but thats the trade off.
---
i was dreading dt because everyone shit talks it, but damnit i had fun during all the pre reqs and the quest itself, only thing that sucked was the end in the pyramid.
---
the mongooses, no, wait, the fighting mongooses

*shrugs* haters gonna hate :p.

I cant wait to do ds2! Gonna take my time and read it all like i did with Lunar and DT

This is like the eqvuilent of saying a aimbot in a pvp game would be justified. "But.. But! It doesn't increase the max exp/dps rate! to have a 100% triple efficency headshot rate! Why would a aimbot be bad?" line of thinking.

---
they dont do it the same way people constantly make rs3 jokes, but you can definitely find the occasional client joke on /r/runescape
---
now high alch all of it
---
Why are they holding staffs like they're holding a members item in a nonmembers world?
---
Thank you for your hard work.
---
We don't know if it will be or not, it's all speculation at this point. It's more likely that Jagex won't punish people for using it, but technically it is a macro so I wouldn't bet on it.
---
I hope we straight up get a rollback to the 20th. Or that everyone who has abused this shitshow gets the ban hammer
---
"he's done DT"
---
So because it’s single combat people shouldn’t work together? That’s insane lol, teamwork is part of a MMO. If you don’t like it don’t enter PVP zones.

Jagex is such a shit ass company, lets be real :/

Yeah the pyramid can be brutal, but luckily it isnt 2007 and you dont even have to revisit it for book swap if you dont want to!
---
If you can do bbd you can do ToB
---
i dont buy it, i think matt just genuinely doesnt see an issue with these. if they knew the end was coming no matter what why not lock the feature behind premium and make 2$ off everyone who wants to use it, rather than just putting it in the free version and hoping people stick around/upgrade
---
understandable, a pet is a blessing and a curse.
---
I like the option 2 idea of it acting like the Ring of wealth.
---
Personally I want a 3rd option;
---
Option 3: be able to have multiple rune pouches, so you could have runes for ancients in 1, lunar in the other etc, BUT you can only have ONE in your inventy at a time.
---
Edit: Grammar.
---
That was always the best one. Especially when they actually did lol.
---
Reminds me of Into the Breach, really cool
---
How so
---
if you really enjoy punishing yourself its lovely. all jokes aside, if you use slayermusiq1’s guide its not too bad, just 45 minutes of aimlessly walking around.
---
Why not just sue OSbuddy?
---
Will randoms still occur? Randoms seem like an rng way to plan some things/get ahead. I know you said it wasn't going to be stupid competitive, but would still want it to be as structured.

When I started feeling like a pro I camped the gaurds at Al kharid palace and got 40 attack there and felt so good. But I also trained on men and picked up the herbs and got enough money to afford my first rune scimmy. I remember being so excited I was telling my mom about my adventures and it's when I fell in love with RuneScape. Preciously I would play with my friend but this is when I branched off and love it. When my friend got his first whip I was in awe. Those were my best memories, also when I found out about rock crabs I camped till 50 qtt 50 str then used gmaul constantly
---
It definitely *does* put me at risk, but afaik, Jagex and OSB have (or at least had) ties together, so it would be a risky move from either side to take drastic action over this.
---
i was always discouraged by my irls because they told me its only worth playing if you started years ago, thats a load of horse shit though, ive been playing for around a year and a half now and im 1850 total level and im having a blast.
---
Something something holy magic
---
So you just watched aaty’s stream lol
---
You only did 33minutes ofmit, the sample size is miniscule.
---
congrats dude, btw you posted this twice.
---
As far as I know, Matt simply notified Jagex that they were putting these plugins into the game, and didn’t actually get the “ok” or “seal of approval” from them. He’s just saying it in such a way to make people think that these were approved when in reality Jagex is still writing up a statement for this situation (according to a Mod Ash tweet). Despite Jagex being pretty quiet on this topic I have no doubt in my mind sometime this week there will be SOMETHING from them, be it good or bad.
---
I too would like to know the answer to this
---
What on Earth are you trying to say?
---
Might as well make getting 1-99 one clickable while we're at it. You click once and then the character levels itself all the way to 99 with automated movements. We could call it Better Optimized Training, or BOT for short.
---
We finally did it lads.
---
Its all or none lol. Jagex cant tell what client you're on.
---
&gt;goingcrazy201
---
oh shit that is one old name, best quest guides of the real old runescape.
---
It'd have to be worded to make it sound appealable to pvmers so they don't automatically shit on it making pking easier. 2nd option is a definite yes because its ass having to keep 2-3 placeholder runes in one's inventory on slayer tasks.
---
Even if they don't want to fight PKers, that is OK. If there were no PKers in the wilderness, I'm sure there would be constant complaints from pvmers that "revenants are too OP and devalue other money making methods" or "why are black chinchompas the same price as red chinchompas?"
---
spaghetti code. stuff that's been in the game since it was rs2 isn't going to get changed now. in fact i'd be surprised if anyone currently working at jagex even remembers *how* to change it
---
&gt; What rules?
---
  ...the rules of the game? I'm not sure if that comment was meant to be sarcastic, but Jagex does have a written set of rules for OSRS and macroing/botting is literally the first one. Three lines into the game rules:  
---
  "Types of disallowed third party software: ...  
---
  3) Software that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses."
---
Or you know people will start keeping them till they're over grown, then bank them and get a kitten, with intent of getting a massive amount ammont of runes as soon as they get membership
---
Combat stats?
---
3x 70(atk, str, def)
---
I want to get good melee gear now
---
Until I get all of the requirements and 185 QP, it's gonna take a while :D
---
But yeah, I have it in my mind
---
If someone does a name change, as long as the previous name still shows up next to their new name, then adding that previous name to your friends list will make the new name show up, and you'll see that the name you added was their previous name, still being held.
---
An example would be if I added "Bob". Then "Joe" appears on my friends list however when I hover over his name it'll say "Previous name Bob".
---
Yes, it has been discussed on Reddit before
---
Actually, I do not wanna do this BA stupid minigame.
---
Isn't it better to get Bandos Chestplate which is like 18m now?
---
What I find weirder is you being so eager to defend a corporation that's creating undetectable botting software and thus ruining our game.
---
Thanks! Yup, my defence is 70 too, but I have yet to complete Desert Treasure though. I will have to bite the bullet soon cause those spells are always nice to have.
---
Your goals seem fine to me, quest cape should be high up in the list of goals imo. Also if you’re new to bossing you might want to start faniliarizing yourself with that. Maybe start with doing dagannoth kings occasionally.
---
It doesn't take much to test it, get a kitten, go to f2p, die, go to members
---
Should be a "Sort by # of Amenities"
---
&gt; Just ban all 3rd party client already for god sakes
---
Would you be available for taking part in a research project I'm doing? It revolves around using simple statements like this one to determine early childhood brain trauma (ie being dropped on your head as a child). Participants like you will pave the road to new diagnostic techniques for these sort of brain injuries that have life-long consequences.
---
It increases the number of alts people use, not the actual player base.
---
No, I autoclicked mage for like 30 hours on my main.
---
I don't recommend it tho its not worth it.
---
It’s fixed ever since they updated the launcher. In order for it to work though you have to uninstall runelite and reinstall it to get the new version
---
Switching attack styles is irrelevant. Weapons save the last attack style it was used on.
---
You think the size of the playerbase makes a difference in this? hah. Tell that to 2012's playerbase.
---
Also, I don't think increasing the amount of online users would have the effect you're expecting.
---
Yeah and EoC ect was shit but not game integrity. The only ones i can think of were bugs like RoW, The Crucible ect and they were all fixed quickly
---
uhhhh, because they made the plugin?
---
You mad your stupid ass cant play without some shitty overlays buddy?
---
Sorry your brain cant comprehend more then 2 things at a time my bad.
---
There's a reason why there were tons of RS3 features that made in the clients. Our childhood were thinking that Green Dragon hunting in rune/Dscim was great money and bursting with an immediate dds spec was skilled pking. We were all different back then.
---
Definitely agree on ironman. The progression feels better too. I felt like my main progressed past GWD1, QBD, KBD, Dagganoth Kings, and the Giant Mole too fast. They became easy because I could make gp skilling or doing slayer and then buy gear above their level-range. Now, Im planning on facing Kril with a tier 75 and tier 60 power armour with basic prayers and limited stat boosting capacity. Just need 70 constitution requirement haha
---
The mechanics of Salvation would ensure a lot of +1s by singles/ancient mace smiting teams.

Edit: omg if I type my password it shows as asterisks!!
---
Jagex probably needs to add some extra server-side validation to block these hacks.
---
Not comparable at all. Different times in both the games life and actual time.
---
Yeah the bone offering one is what I was referring to. That's 100% just a textbook macro which is turning a single click into multiple game inputs. There's no way the OSB team or anyone using that plugin can argue their way around that:  
---
  "Types of disallowed third party software: ...
---
3) Software that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses."
---
When really lucky people give you advice about RNG
---
Why are they so shit assy?
---
It's really not that bad, in fact it can actually be fun if you find a group of friends to do it with. And no, BCP is not a good investment when you only have 20-25m to spend.
---
im confused, where did all those nezzys come from?
---
If the community wants it
---
Yeah I don’t think that is abnormal. Try adding in a bgs spec at the beginning of the kills if you’re not already
---
Doubt
---
[X]
---
I can't speak for other players but it's definitely more fun fighting random people than your friends
---
I remember after this happened I was on a camping trip and me and a buddy spent like hours planning how to pull off something similar. Kids are fucking stupid lol
---
DWH and Ham joint belong to the same weapon category so you can't have them remember different styles
---
They're not bad with a lance, but I keep em blocked to have a higher chance at getting a hydra task post-95.
---
400k×14=5.6M 
---
Bond= 4.65M
---
In comment section here, people recommended me free Firecape and free barrow gloves(which I will work on in a long term), so the money is still in my pocket.
---
&gt; I find it hard to believe that crossing a ditch suddenly makes it so you can attack other players.
---
Good point. Should be PvP everywhere then. Nothing physically would prevent you from attacking someone else outside of the wilderness, so it would make sense.
---
Speaking as someone that experienced the first iteration of EOC, EOC was part of it. It was largely unbalanced and made the game even easier. Also it was fully manual at the time (revo didn't exist) so I found it to be a chore when I wanted to train but relax, there wasn't really an option. All the other parts of the shitty transition from rs2 to rs3 were just icing on the cake.
---
Nowadays EoC is mostly fine, there are some quirks to it I don't personally enjoy but it's not entirely grating like it was at first. There are plenty of mobs that are trivialized by the new system that make them a lot less threatening than they are on OSRS, but in their wake there are new things to kill to balance it out.
---
Nice one!
---
You have to drop all Nezzy helms or he won't sell you another helm. Someone was buying all the Nezzy helms and forgot to pick up their helms.
---
I don't use OSB, i use runelite. I don't feel that this plugin is ruining my experience at all. Also, hard to call this bot software when you still have to perform actions. I do agree that this is skirting a line, especially seeing that OSB and its creator previously made RSBuddy, a botting client. 
---
I love that you think this ruins "our" game. I won't let it ruin my game, I could care less what others do with their time in the game unless it's heavily abusing game breaking bugs. This will have minimal effect on me so I choose not to let it bother me, you should try it sometime because you seem real worked up.
---
lol? dont compare this to us we dont use third parties to cheat at our game
---
we pay for spins to cheat at our game
---
seers requires kandarin hard while GE only requires varrock med. Getting 70 prayer and 75 smithing on an iron sucks
---
Except that was not fair use at all
---
Be like that guy who spent 5000 hours each for 200m attack, strength and defence, afk at stronghold spiders
---
Is this some form of money making? What’s the point?
---
So you’re complaining that they hesitated to offer a free game? The entitlement is strong with this one.
---
Good man
---
I agree op could of got lucky a good number of times with a few of the drops. If you only do 30 minutes of loot testing, then try to use those rates to figure out the go per hour you are going to fuck it up. The rates will be even more dramatically off the more time you multiply I to it. It's like a vector that's 2 degrees off from being a straight line. Sure that line looks straight when it started, but If you follow the vector down the graph you can slowly see that that 2 degrees turns into a mile of a difference over time.
---
I'd you really want to provide a updated prices of a loot table you'd have to kill like 2-5k+ for any information that isn't garbage.
---
oooooooof thats tough.
---
Paying for an inferior service that you got an upgraded version for free.
---
With those stats a 2 kill trip is definitely possible, but it's not abnormal to only get one. 
---
Also using salve ei? Praying eagle eye for the entire kill? If you're using void you could try switching to blessed D'hide for a few kills until your range level is higher to see if it feels like the increased accuracy is making a difference. 
---
What's your average kill time? Without that it's tough to say if you're taking too much damage/using too many supplies because you're taking too long to kill him, or if it's something else.
---
Ni69ce
---
yea, 50k from the shop, 56k from the ge.
---
Item names on the ground = game breaking amiright?
---
^^^please ^^^consider ^^^helping ^^^my ^^^study
---
I was gonna say gold, but I guess it just changes hands.
---
Tbow only zulrah is easily possible on a few accounts at once but not 12 so I think all pvm except mole would be borderline impossible for you haha
---
I see good to see it in that perspective
---
Very low chance they ban anyone or even suspend for this until they release a statement.
---
not really, I'd say stealing someones spot and then insisting that they've been there for 3 hours is more pathetic
---
You also don't to bring a light source
---
Maybe it takes longer for your arm to go foward and back with a dagger
---
I wish Samsung pass would work, the option comes up the password doesn't filter in.
---
People do/buy 31pray fire capes to flex, after that getting overheads would be a waste of the massive ammount of time/rsgp spent on the cape.
---
If you legitimately think either of those two are remotely comparable to Jagex detecting someone using a junk client that's sending perfectly legitimate game inputs then I don't know what to tell you. On Jagex's end this is no different from something like RuneLite menu entry swapper and all of the ones shown are actions easily accomplished by a real human using the default client
---
Those things only exist because osbuddy had them b4 runelite so runelite's dev has to add them in to get ppl to switch
---
He's expressed wanting to remove them a few times actually. He also said that all this was gunna happen about 6 months ago and here we are
---
first result for a magic only kill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5lN2JcPhRY

haven't watched it, see how you go

Clue Solvers just get rid of the eventual looking up of all the anagrams, coordinates, etc. up online. 
---
The irony is that people will always whine about these types of updates but will more than likely use them anyways.
---
The irony in this comment is kind of unreal
---
Mine did this literally for about 2 weeks and then eventually just stopped. It might be that I logged into pc for the first time in a long time and it somehow fixed itself.
---
30.2m here
---
How would this buff your XP rate you clown you still have to run to the altars that consist of 99% of your xprates rofl.
---
You mean profitable pvm*
---
Also you have a massive advantage over people too cheap to use it
---
Don't understand why people use video guides when Wiki quick guides exist.
---
I got it from OP's comments you fucking retard, they're all solo kills. How else would he get so many pyro pieces? 
---
Also I don't care what kind of seeds it is, why would a UIM waste 8 invent slots on that shit?
---
1) I don't think ammunition even has a level requirement, just that the weapon you use dictates the maximum ammunition tier you can use.
---
2) Crossbows can use bolts up to the same tier of metal. So an Adamant Crossbow can use any bolts up to Adamant, including enchanted ones made from lower tier Bolts like Steel -&gt; Topaz (e), Adamant Bolts like Ruby (e) and Diamond (e), but not Onyx (e) or Dragonstone (e) which are made from Rune Bolts. And a Steel Crossbow can use Topaz (e) which are made from Steel Bolts but not ones made from higher tiers of metal like Ruby (e).
---
Additionally, there's a variant of all the gem-tipped bolts made from Dragon Bolts instead and they can only be fired by Dragon, Dragon Hunter, and Armadyl Crossbows.
---
3) I know it gives you XP, but I'm unsure which skill
---
4) Diamond (e) for most enemies, Ruby (e) for high HP monsters, although depending on the boss, people sometimes bring Diamond (e) too so they can swap bolts when the boss HP gets low. For low DEF monsters where range doesn't matter like Barrows, something  like MSB (i) is preferred.
---
5) It's always better to use the MSB (i) or Rune Knives for training.
---
Runelite's dev called this like 6 months ago
---
He also said that 3rd party clients were gunna be the death of osrs.
---
Kind of scary when it's coming from him
---
lol OSbuddy is just a bot client now
---
Not super interesting. It’s been said before.
---
I guess this proves the dumb reddit theory of jagex colluding with osb wrong once and for all then.
---
Yeah, I was thinking maybe to do the same, just exploring, do you suggest looking up how to do quest on the internet or doing them alone?
---
Lol dang I see cause I was gonna say like fire capes would be pretty challenging without protect prayers I am definitely leaning toward 45 prayer maxed 50 attack im in the works I think I’ll do BH and maybe some pking by GE
---
You'll also miss having a playerbase to play along with.
---
He never said that tho
---
He said they have no way to detect this stuff, and he's kind of right
---
They either ban all 3rd party clients or none, because they have no way to tell if you're using runelite or osbuddy
---
Some people understand better with visuals instead of text.
---
Either i overestimate or you underestimate the companies way of detecting stuff. 
---
Honestly i wont be surprised if they can rollback accounts who have abused these mechanics. Im not really fond of some of the things on runelite, granted i dont care about xp/h so i just afk prayer when i train it. 
---
But it wouldnt be a problem if they would put a little bit of work into their client. Im at the point where i cant play on pc without animation smoothing for example.
---
vork - buy supplies - buy some skill supplies - chuck the rest of the profit 
---
is my current loop, 85-95 con, 70 - 99 smithing, 90-92 herb banked with all other buyable at 99.
---
I stopped myself getting 99 defence for a long time in osrs but as soon as I got it I started staking.
---
it was when worse when I played rs3 since I'm already maxed on there, I'd just double up chuck my entire bank until I went broke
---
haram
---
I mean depends what you condider PvM, I suppose killing goblins is technically PvM too so in that case yea
---
You should stream on twitch so everyone can criticize your every move, then you’ll be set in a few hours of playing!
---
I wouldnt play anymore because all I still do ingame is CoX, and it's literally impossible without a scouting mechanic from a 3rd party client. Jagex should allow us to pay a dwarf or something 500k gp for a random 3c chosen puzzle rota
---
Runelite was around then too
---
I mean its pretty obvious some morons thinks they wont get banned or cant get banned for whatever shit osbuddy added
---
Just watch the pickachu faces when jagex surprisingly decide to ban everyone that abused it
---
Thats awesome man, exploring the world for the first time is such a great experience, I wish i could relive it. There are loads of new areas, quests, bosses and even skills open to you now! I hope you enjoy the journey as I have and wish you the best of luck.
---
They can ban certain plugins like they did with runelite when it blew up. They dont have to ban a whole client just the "gamebreaking" plugins.
---
Damn.. I've been feeling like playing on my (pretty shit) UIM again and now I want to even more..
---
Turning off anti-aliasing worked for me when I had an AMD gpu.
---
I think that argument was brought up before and the main difference is that runelite has a menu changer which changes the order of items in the context menu whereas these all require clicking multiple items or something along those lines
---
They can tell if you're on a 3rd party client
---
Which is the point he's making  they either ban all 3rd party or leave all of them.
---
Osb is being really selfish and ruining it for everyone for a quick buck
---
REEEEEEE
---
Yea it's a bitch lol. I just started a baby pure and I'm probably going the same route
---
I appreciate this high thought, it's not entirely necessary, but I still appreciate it.
---
Ty, to train agility I first need to do the tree gnome village quest in order to unlock the spirt tree right?
---
You're the cancer of this sub, just so you're aware.
---
And a significant number of people will quit. This isn't like RS3 where MTX can keep the boat floating if lots of people quit.
---
The only solution to stop people from complaining about third party clients it to become the third party client. Just put plugins on the official client and limit it's capabilities to only reading and writing UI elements on to the screen. The biggest reasons people use third parties is for basic features like floor item text, or repot timers, and Slayer counters.
---
You put in the longer time to develop plugin capabilities and make a official web page to add them and download them then you future proof yourself for whatever creative updates the third parties make.
---
Then from this point you could ban, or shun third party use. If you just ban third party clients people are still going to use them, you just force them to play on clients who are more likely to do shady stuff sense they're banned anyways. It's like adding bonds in game to combat gold selling. You have to become the gold seller, but in a controlled, safe, and ethical enviorment. Player made plugin are a feature on many MMOs like Elder scrolls online, and do really well there. 
---
If setting up a web page for the mods are too complicated a RuneScape mod page could be made on something like Nexus, but I don't like the idea of RuneScape working outside of it's eco system to avoid phsing link confusing.
---
Was to emphasize the fact you said engine updates were simple, i could have kept ''client'' in and underlined engine or written it in bold but removing one word seemed easier without changing the meaning of your comment.
---
Engine updates are not simple
---
But the B O O T S
---
What's worse is when you're peacefully doing a task when somebody shows up, drops a cannon and has the audacity to tell you to hop. 
---
Bonus points if it's in single way.
---
I hate zulrah now tbh. It has been over 600 kills since I got anything from the 1/128 unique table. The majority of my kills result in scales, flax, and snakeskin
---
Did you not read the comment I replied to?  He stated he hoped Jagex would stand up to OSB alone - it's not possible for them to do that as you and I have both stated.
---
They can't
---
They can tell if you're on the default or a 3rd party, but not what 3rd party.
---
I’d say trying to get all 3rd party clients banned in response to a better, free one is pretty immature
---
It's amazing how few people understand that
---
I say skip them and go straight to Barrows dragons.
---
Hm plus I figured with the damage boosting prayers it’ll end up being better DPS with MSB or for tri bridding at the cost of only 1 CB maxed
---
NGL, I stole that way of saying it from a mudkip video
---
Riposte was in a clan with me for about a year. He’s actually a really good dude, and never abuses his pmod status. People are allowed to be annoyed
---
Wasting their time writing news on filthy casuals
---
It was an example. Menu swappers save a click every once in a while. It's not comparable. Christ you guys just love nit picking.
---
"Arachnids of Vampyrium" is amazing, goes absolutely perfectly with the nylo room
---
If you want to style without risking the handle, d knife spec into gmaul spec into light ballista.  It’s so much damage in like 3 ticks
---
Nah they should ban ppl using these features
---
with bad enough luck you'll end up on torvestas next video haha
---
LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
The reason they wanted to shut it down was related to easy accessibility to macros (something like that). Its very easy to make op shit on runelite no matter how hard Adam tries to stop it
---
Join w 385 cc
---
Yeah I really need to get it done. Been putting off suffering through it with randoms lol
---
Not setting your bank pin? That's a paddlin'
---
That's usually how it goes, and when it doesn't you usually keep going untill it does
---
I've watched a whole clan ruined by the sand casino. One after another quitting cuz they had a gambeling addiction and lost their endgame banks
---
You could maybe spin some flax? Probably not a long-term money maker, but you could get some easy cash starting out. 
---
Simply buy some flax at the GE (3gp each), spin them at a spinning wheel, sell the bowstring (185 each at the moment). Actually not terrible XP for early crafting training, and it's pretty AFK.
---
Tbh jagex should sell a server clients for like 20 bucks on the side that requires membership to use.
---
The client will let you pick from any update they have made from the start of osrs, then be able to host it, or join other people's servers. I think there is a chunk of like 15k people that only play on private servers on and off which makes them download sketchy ass clients in Java which is like one of the most vulnerable languages for privacy leaks. 
---
I think it would future proof the game, and people would feel less likely to leave the RuneScape enviorment if the live version of osrs is "ruined" to them in whatever regard. Often I hear people practice for pking on these private servers too because there's less risk and have interesting reward systems to keep it fresh letting you avoid any Skilling or pvm.
---
Even if in 20 years old school RuneScape is dead they could still change membership fees to use the server client, or even move on to letting you rent your own RuneScape server. The game could be timeless even giving future generations a "retro" game when they're all burnt out forkknife 4.
---
most people who autoclick/use extreme AHK don't get banned as long as you're careful about it.  I've autoclicked 99 mage on so many accounts it's a fucking joke dude, redditards vastly overestimate Jagex's ability to detect this stuff
---
Made that mistake early in my iron Man. So much gold lost...
---
RuneLite still staying non-shady, yes?
---
If I have to play on an undersized client... game ruining tbh
---
Not necessarily, fall back to the last statement.  "If it's not 1 to 1, it's bad."  Still applicable.
---
"just because the best methods are in the wild doesn't mean you have to use it" seriously, just listen to your argument. Irons should not need to do pvp, they play a solo game mode and only get emblems from pking on bh only. Your argument is ridiculous.
---
It's cheating and everyone knows it. Hope Jagex bans all the accounts abusing this stuff.
---
Ironman mode doesn't fix any of the issues that this post is about? The problem is with non-ironman herblore.
---
What do you mean nah?? You get 2 rewards for the first 500 points, and then 1 guaranteed reward every 500 points after that. so 1k points is 3 rewards, 1.5k points is 4 etc. 13k points is 27 rewards and 27 is the max. How am I wrong?
---
13pray 42def 50attack is pretty OP, and maxed voiders shit all over me. I do pretty well at 60attack 1def 52pray though, claws into gmaul is awesome
---
Fukong being the orcs is 10/10, the rest of the scene would have all made sense aswell
---
edit: I guess the orcs would be Jagex, and Fukong Sauron
---
but its like 5th grade reading comprehension level to use the quest guides.
---
This makes the most sense as Osbuddy's endgame. They want to get bought out by jagex and become the only allowed premium client. 
---
Otherwise their behavior doesn't make sense, they're going to destroy their buisness if they keep pushing more and more OP shit.
---
Still 4x more than a PvMer risks doing “top tier” content like Tob lmao.
---
Tbh it was probably all just lawyers. I think legal teams only make money if they're working on something, so they'll go for everything.
---
iirc they said something about demonics being crowded enough or popular enough without Konar assigning them.
---
Haha yeah that combo is sick I see man thanks for answering my questions btw
---
Why risk an account you put hundreds of hours into?
---
My iron has surpassed my "main" in the majority of skills and general in-game achievements, and it's been a hell of a lot more fun.
---
Would you say that the change is positive?
---
Jagex has said multiple times that use third partys at your own risk and to use your own brain. This is the very example of it. Give 1 week temp bans for people abusing this shit. You can get inhuman levels of experience with some of these "plugins"
---
It seems to be you that is the one who can’t see common sense.
---
As someone who can now actually train herblore and buy potions for not exorbitant fees, yes.
---
I’ve been saying this . Would make for fun group Ironman with all your boys as well
---
Yeah I dont think Mat K had anything to do with it either
---
There’s healthy buisness competetion and theres unethical buisness competition, this fals under the ladder
---
I wouldn't know i used the quick guide and finished it before slayermisc put out the video. My reasoning is im always watching something else while i play and a video guide just takes me out of the stuff id rather pay attention to.
---
The cloud looks like a cock and balls

Vampire Slayer gets you like a good chunk of attack exp if waterfall is a bit too much for you at a lower level.
---
Usually when people suggest water fall quest they know about the part where you have run past monsters that can 2 hit you if you're around 20 health. It's easily do able, it's just you might want to watch a video guide, or read ahead when doing the quest guide.
---
No worries dude, if you wanna add me in game you can hmu with any questions about pking or fcapes or shit. my rsn is just defy
---
Jahahaha I hope I do 8)
---
I agree your original comment was stupid and I continued the stupidity.
---
People who disagree with you aren't immediately stupid or "EHP nerds". You seem to only want things easier. That is stupid in my eyes.
---
Right now they're interested in finding out what PKers want in-game that could pass a poll, not scheming behind our backs.
---
I keep house teles on my account whichever one is training on crabs so if I get crashed and they feel high spirited I send the trade offer and I show the tele and tell them to "go home your momma's calling"
---
There were initially plans to have a demon boss there, but that was when the area was added, which was quite a while ago.
---
Thx man I’ll keep that in mind! Gl bro
---
Yea I mean, when you create cheating plugins for your client others will do the same.
---
If you think demonic gorillas plugin isn't cheating then idk what to tell you
---
The same for wilderness altars? That's where it's predominantly used. No real point training in houses unless you're purely looking for XP/hr and money is no obstacle.
---
why does the person in that meme look like they can erase time
---
If Jagex doesn't take a hard stance against OP plugins then the game is basically dead.
---
Also something serious needs to be done to the accounts that chose to abuse these clearly busted plugins.
---
Understandable, it feels really good when you have it though!
---
Good for you. I hear there's things called bots that can get you to 99 without playing, someone with your mindset is probably interested there.
---
Seriously, you want it easy, it already is. You just are lazym
---
Lol what, bbd is afk.
---
Yeah. Downvote me without saying shit. Your upset but you cant deny it.
---
Yall remember when they update it and it looked like a German shepard for some reason
---
But what is the point of a poll if you only poll the people who will say yes. It would be like the next warding poll you have to have previously voted yes on a warding poll. It isn't a poll that reflects the community when you only let the portion of the community you know already wants it vote.
---
Incorrectly I guess
---
I would say wildly Slayer is easier the lower level you are especially if you range and mage everything. Everything in the wilderness Slayer tasks is safespotable. A bulk of it you just use stumps. And the only thing that's not safespotable for wildly tasks scorpia which you aren't going to do at that level anyways.
---
Essentially just stick to the low level monsters. Even things like anokus are fine if you fire strike. If you get fire Giants, greater demons, or anything like that just skip it at burthop which would probably be your Slayer master anyways.
---
Meanwhile, I made a way to have more fine-grained control of music, sound effect, and area effect volumes.
---
Slayermusiq has new guides that are all up to date
---
Yep it seems the reception of me saying they are making a mode without polling it because higher ups want more profit and they can't do MTX is not good.
---
Group ironman mode is more profit in my eyes. I know everyone I play with would be making a second account and paying for it. Can't reuse an account for that content. Exactly the same principle they're doing with leagues. Can't play main game and leagues at same time on same account, so if you wanna keep progressing but Wana check leagues out... Guess you'll buy another account.
---
If u do il take ur bank 👍
---
This could be album artwork lol
---
A guy in the craft guild I just randomly saw :P
---
&gt;Drakan (or one of the other vampire dudes)  
---
  
---
This dude is Count Draynor, one of the Drakan siblings.
---
Yeah the same company that killed off their entire game when about 90% of the playerbase was against eoc.
---
The same company that killed the entire wildy in rs2.
---
Dont underestimate on how far they go.
---
Unlike these updates some shitty client isnt going to make everyone that use the clients quit.
---
Hold on let me put my glasses on I can’t read it
---
&gt;R
---
your mom
---
I can't wait for you to simultaneously gain two levels at once
---
\&gt;I think we were definitely on the wrong side of the protests lol  
---
I mean runelite and the features it has that the base client should have are one of the single biggest factors in why player count and retention have been so high in osrs in the recent bit of time.  Letting it exist was one of the best business decisions jagex ever made, since osrs was dead in the water.
---
But sure, a separate client is intentionally griefing out of spite for being worse than runelite so I guess Jagex's incompetence and an ex-bot creator's shitty morals means we were all wrong /s
---
Question should be, why include stats..at all lol
---
The werewolves are also under Drakan's domain, and therefore subject to blood tithes, so I suppose it would make sense that they would do whatever they need to do to avoid that, even if it means tempting the start of another god war.
---
Selfish bastards those dog people are.
---
Right, I misread rolls as crates. My mistake.

Deleting your post isnt going to make it suddenly get upvoted
---
Didn't realize. That's a great way around getting content you know won't pass to pass I guess lol
---
You like that a guy who used to make bots is mad that a free client is better than his so he's now abusing Jagexes incompetence to make life worse for everyone?  
---
The level of derangement....
---
Edgy comment gets an edgy response.
---
&gt; seriously: why show of something when others do it better? Just be fond of your own process but don't share it with the public.
---
Cool, I'm glad we're on the same page now. By your own terms, you should not be posting.
---
Big yikes if you need to be banned to consider yourself out of a "waste of time". Should be a leisure activity, not an addiction.
---
No. Mobile doesn't have a the 50fps cap tho, people want that on desktop.
---
Don't have a source but Runelite has had it for so long that they'd definitely have taken it down if they weren't allowed
---
Ring is just a random dice roll bud no need to be so salty
---
The Badgers
---
No lol. I want a crackdown on third party clients. Apparently this is the only thing that will get jagex to address them
---
Yeah sure
---
You can't use runelite now?
---
one click con/blackjack has been a thing on runelite for over a year and I've never heard of anyone getting banned for that shit
---
People pay for this kind of company?
---
Language used included "Perks" that would make it "worth your time."
---
Cant imagine any cosmetics making it worthwhile but guess we'll see.
---
Game just isn't made for twitch viewership. Lots of repetitive actions and boring gameplay TO WATCH. Game's pretty healthy; maybe not rising, but at the worst, stable.
---
Wait what,it isnt called RunEscape?!!
---
I'm sure new players who are worth having in our community don't care about getting help from others when barely starting to play.
---
Eh Matt dodged any direct question of "did they respond" with dumb legal talk like "I won't speak for them". So no, they didn't respond. They just didn't say no.
---
He likely also has more insight into what talk is going on in regards to clients as a whole. Might be going nuclear with the OP plugins while he can to rack up a bunch of subscription sales before clients as a whole get banned.
---
I reread and it says it was Drakan who did it back in the “War of 164”. Apparently it was from one of the old RuneScape novels
---
I recall that. Maybe I'm remembering incorrectly then.
---
The only rng to complain about in osrs is for duel/staking. The fact that a 85/85/85 can beat a 90/90/90 11x in a row is insane amounts of bullshit that it aint funny. 
---
Now pvm rng such as drops..pets, etc - that's how rpgs usually work my man.
---
im at 7k kc now and i just do 3 kills every trip thats just enough time for me to only consume 1 extended antifire, venom and bastion dose on each trip so i dont have to go bank when im not even halfway a dose of extended antifire.
---
banking only takes a minute so your not missing out on much.
---
For real, did not expect to see Adore when I came into the sub
---
The answer is kinda lame lol, I died for a mug mining pure ess in varrock, as I don\`t play that much with this acc I dont bothered on making another hc lol
---
fucking brapposters
---
Does it matter? Is the only reason you don't bot because you might get caught?
---
To answer your question you probably wouldn't get caught if you did it right
---
I ran into that npc for the first time yesterday and thought it was a really good set up for a demon slayer boss like kraken or cerb
---
Made that same mistake lol
---
You know java coding existed without runelite right? People been making "OP plugins" for 2 decades. They're called bots.
---
I think I’ll just switch to vanilla now and use google chrome for everything lol.
---
Cheat clients existing is the only thing that will get jagex to make a probably shitty and incomplete decision, yes.
---
Why are you cheering cheat clients existing again?
---
I enjoyed Zulrah, and I will go back cause it’s fun- but Vorkath is objectively easier. And it’s also kinda fun.
---
I think technology (and especially the Internet) has caused a loneliness epidemic for our generation and the next. As our ability to survive increases, the need to interact with others to survive decreases. I guess common threats were responsible for a lot of our social interaction... lol. Social interaction isn't just a way to survive, though. It's also a reason to (debatably the only one). So now we're left with a social culture that's running on fumes and excessive isolation that continues to increase because we don't have a good enough *excuse* to talk to each other. Because you want to. There is no reason.
---
They cant catch you though. What do you think they do, screenshot your screen and send it back to them?
---
They can only send back a super tiny amount of data. They dont record mouse movements(because mobile), they dont record your screen or any overlays you have.
---
They record clicks, and check for patterns. They do not have a anti-cheat optimised for catching cheating humans, only bots.
---
I mean, blind to the effects of what *could* happen. 
---
Not really a great argument, considering that the osb new plugins are mostly across the line of what is reasonable customization; however, jagex isnt gonna make something nearly as good as runelite if osb does get 3rd party clients banned. 
---
No win situation.
---
Because I hate all third party clients and want to see them removed :^)
---
When should I use the ham joint in Tob? Whenever I'm melee role at nylo? I'm 95 attack and 99 str currently if that matters
---
The only case I don't use it is pickpocketing, other than that I think all the uses of it are reasonable
---
\&gt;I don’t understand how people can make the argument equating these plugins  
---
A game where a sizeable fraction of the playerbase is mentally ill doesn't attract people who argue in good faith.
---
... one is a visual overlay on a screen aiding you in what to choose to do, the other is literally halving your actions if not more and making normal tasks absolutely brain-dead 
---
Scroll wheel fletching would be like 1.5 to 2m xp/hr by just flicking your scroll wheel and not moving your mouse..
---
The fact you compare these and think informative overlays is problematic is the real problem. 3PC are a good thing for the game and the vanilla client is garbage and unusable for plenty of people using any sort of modern equipment from the last 5 years.
