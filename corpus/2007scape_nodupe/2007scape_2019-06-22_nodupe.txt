He's just been extra serene-y lately. Almost like he's trying to replace him.

You have a crown beside your name. Thats your flex. Shouldn‚Äôt even have ironman armour but you do so be happy with that.
---
And they say pkers aren‚Äôt toxic #deadcontent
---
I'm sorry can you help me understand how I was being an ass? Are BR's or MOBA's bad. I'm sorry that I came off sounding the wrong way.
---
RL has nothing to do with ppl making cheat clients LOL people are going to do that shit regardless
---
Nobody can relate because bots don't mess up
---
slayer bad
---

---
hunter good
---
I don't have a tbow but I would sell mine. It depends on the person.
---
Firemaking, smithing, and then fletching
---
To be fair, it's more than 95% likely that those are the exact kind of people that are doing what OP is describing.
---
Save for DHCB, it's crashing hard now. You might be able to pick one up for cheap. It's almost 15m down from 2 weeks ago.
---
This is legit me
---
I feel like if you're an iron you shouldn't have to split since you cant get lost from the other people's drops anyway.
---
I kinda wish you could permanently keep your run energy on for moments like that. Not like you really keep it off in any situation unless you're doing Vorkath or something similar.
---
Time for 85cmb max cape
---
Best for last.
---
Idk man today I got 2 in my seed pack and I was ECSTATIC. I don‚Äôt want that feeling to go away. IM btw
---
Although a cool idea, how used will this really be? What benefit is there for an Ironman to PK? They cant collect items and all they do is waste their own supplies.
---
When they kill you they will often advertise the clan as well
---
You pay a premium for the best XP. It's perfectly fine imo, though that comes from a guy who got his 99 farming from magic seeds at 200k and palms at 75k.
---
Ayyye congrats! I just finished desert treasure for the first time and freed all the dudes for rfd! Now i just need to get that 175 qp and ill finally get my barrows gloves! Next step is the fire cape!
---
Mm2 is easy compared to ds2 anyways just a bit of a pain
---
Wouldn‚Äôt bother selling it. You‚Äôll make the 5m back in 2 hours at vorkath. Just use it.
---

So basically fuck anyone who wants to save money?

Pretty good üëç

Thank you, at work so can‚Äôt watch the video. Much easier to hide reddit.
---
Jokes on you. 
---
We say the same to pvp polls üòÇ
---
The way this game is there will always be a huge jump between the best xp or bis and second best even if that gap is very small

If someone can't secure their e-mail, that's 100% on them. There's a financial incentive to steal a RS account, so the least someone could do is protect their e-mail.
---
This is more for ironmen doing PVE in the wilderness who anti PKers. Currently PKing ironmen is low/no risk because even if you die you can go back for your items
---
Yea I never had an issue with Jagex customer support. I even had my old rs3 account stolen and used for botting, which was perm banned and thru their support page i was able to contact them and they investigated and returned my account.

Most definitely. At least he's not blowing up the comments like before

We are live FloridaBoy96 on twitch drop party soon!!! 6 followers away!!!

You can do whatever you prefer. Theres unlimited possibilities to the direction you build your account. You can level up all evenly or even do a 99 one at a time account.
---
That's not what they mean. Literally all the content is doable without pray flicking, especially without clicking to metronome (lazy flicking). When they say it's balanced around it, they mean that they know it's a method that's in the game and they're allowing it, unlike certain other bosses where pray flicking is heavily nerfed because of prayer drain mechanics or hitting with multiple styles at once or unpredictably.
---
Reddit will crucify me for saying so, but I feel like the Slayer cape has lost a lot of its prestige, as opposed to the old days back in actual 2007. So many people train slayer purely for their max combat stats, and as a result there are TONS more Slayer Capes in the game. Still a great looking cape, but a little overdone now and not nearly as prestigious as back in the day.
---
I would agree with the naysayers if I was required to completely read and respond to every single thread before being allowed to move on to the next one, but it literally takes me 20 milliseconds of looking at the thumbnail to know whether or not the thread is for me. Achievement posts have wasted maybe thirty seconds of my life, maximum. Move along.

Ur a squid bro

&gt; God, I have had it with EVERYBODY poking fun of my damned runecrafting cape. GUESS WHAT? Not all of us sit with our families, using a couple thousand fish on a glowing fire for 99 cooking. Not all of us shit and piss in toilets. Some of us have a ton of free time, and yet people won't stop fucking making fun of me. You know what takes skill? Mastering the art of runecrafting. It's hard to make runes, yet stabbing a stupid sword into a turoth is impressive? I'm damned fucking proud of my cape, and I'm not going to let any of you jerks tell me other wise

Not only that its good because u have a unique build like u can make a high dps acc and keep demolishing people in pvp worlds/wilderness or u can make a tank build so u can farm black chins and easily escape if pkers start hitting u
---
Better thing would be to pay x% of total value risked.
---
HAHAHAHAHAAH
---
Unless youre making a PKing account there is no point to chinning
---
What are you killing/dying to?
---
Can also confirm. Got engaged a year ago, what even is sex?

My rs3 accounts are x3 more unique than any osrs account you can find.. Know your place.

I see, thanks for the insight!

You could toss in some thieving levels if you didnt care about getting value out of some of the skills like 90 herb for Cox. you could just get like 85 herb and get 5 thieving levels etc.
---
This is roughly what I would do probably. Easily done in a week.
---
Waterfiend slayer task. i'm not actually dying, but i would if i didn't eat.
---
That's not really an argument.  Every single account is tied to both RS3 AND OSRS.  By supporting one, I'm indirectly supporting the other.
---
"Loved every minute of it", I call bs. Nobody thoroughly  enjoys mindlessly clicking continuously. You loved the achievement of completing it.
---
like a world just for under 2000 total? like we don't let them in? I'm all for it, who needs em anyway!
---
Why care what people think?
---
Thanks for the reply! Are there many restrictions by not having some skills like magic for example?
---
I picked them up and dropped them. I moved them to the chest and dropped them there. I did prep and filled vials with other guys while one guy got seconds. It despawned as nobody knew where they went.

For banking at vork, currently I do the lunar isle banking method as don't have the fremminik elite diaries done. But, I'm planning on getting the fremmy elites done soon, and then I won't get to use that method anymore, are fremminik boots 4 faster than the lunar isle method by a lot? because they also take an extra inventory slot.
---
You‚Äôre a god thank you
---
Get to questing then my dude
---
I just did Nature Spirit and this was pretty much me jumping over the bridge, especially bc I started playing due to swampletics.

Is it really 2 step when jagex remove your authenticator if you ask them nicely on Twitter?

Imagine what the next stage beyond blackout drunk would be like; that's how I've always described a mid-level dose of ket. Except there's no nausea or dizzyness, and you will remember the trip for the most part. Every movement you make feels either amplified or minimised, familiar places seem alien and unrecognisable, objects feel heavier or lighter than usual, and you get strange mental hallucinations (can't think of another term for it) where you interpret things in completely ass-backward ways. It was fun as fuck when I was a teen although I tried some recently and not so much. The funniest thing to me was always watching horror movies on the stuff; normally I hate the genre but on ket you might as well be watching a soap opera because nothing makes any god damn sense. People take it to go out apparently but I've never understood how that was possible.
---
This is why it‚Äôs best to practice clicking ‚Äúall but 1‚Äù instead of ‚Äúall‚Äù, because you don‚Äôt want to lose your whole cash stack
---
So I looked at the wiki and it appears they are mostly magic based, so they shred through your melee gear but as your range gear is dhide it‚Äôs more resistant to the magical attack‚Äôs. 
---
Ideally you should kill these with range as your dhide will give better protection and some range attack bonuses
---
yeah but what about the bots and the noobs and dicing?
---
Gz /.-.
---
That‚Äôs because the ‚Äúrange attacks‚Äù you‚Äôre taking are actually magic attacks. Range armor has a high magic defense bonus which is why you take no damage while its equipped. On the opposite end, melee armor has negative magic defense bonus which is why you‚Äôre getting slaughtered while you have *that* equipped. Hope this helps.
---
Ok, I'm really bad at stories but here we go. So I had just came back to OSRS after taking about a year off. Noticed some of my friends still played so I joined the same clan chat aa them.  Met a guy named Aaron. 
---
Overtime we made a good friend ship did alot of stuff together ingame and would jump in VOIP on discord and chat a bit of crap with each other while we played. I've lent him a bond occasionally when he was short if he couldnt play much that fortnight  Fast forward 6 months we started playing ironman he had a normal ironman that he stopped playing and I made a fresh HCIM because I wanted to try out the game mode.  About 2 months he disappeared for a couple weeks. I just presumed he was busy IRL. 
---
He comes back online and messages me ingame telling me his Iron got hacked and they deironed and cleaned it. I felt pretty bad for him. I've asked him if he's secured his account etc. He said he had done that prior to messaging me. He said he was going to play the ironman account over his main because it had alot more questing and skilling done etc. He then was doing dragon slayer 2 which I had to help him work out the puzzle about who stands next to who because he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. He asked If i could lend him a DHCB at the time. I didnt think anything much of it because I had lent him gear in the past with some decent value. Give him the DHCB and 20 minutes later he goes I'll be back mate just going to the shops need to get some milk and food. 
---
That was the last time I heard of him and at the time didn't think much of it because I presumed he was busy IRL. I've tried messaging him on discord asking if I could grab it back to afk Brutal black dragons at zeah while I skilled on my HC.  No response obviously for over 2 weeks. I started looking up his account and noted his overall xp.  Noticed it was going up pretty much in just range mainly. Messaged him again on discord when i noticed it had been going up while I was playing a the same time. I worked out quickly he's probably yoinked it.  The whole getting hacked thing was probably a load of crap etc.
---
Now this is where it gets a bit strange randomly on discord a few months later I get a message. I knew it wasn't Aaron because the grammer and punctuation was really good. Aaron never used a full stop or a comma once in our messages and often mispelled words.  The message said somewhere along the lines I'm sorry Aaron scammed you, he's done it to a few people I know.  Oh and I've forgotten to put this in but Aaron doxed himself on twitch he had his full name and the year he was born in as his username same as his discord. Anyway back to the messages. He said Aaron will no longer be playing his account again ever. I'm a bit dumbfunded and going what do you mean? The person asked me to get in a voice call which I refused because I was unsure of this was an attempt for an IP grab or something like that.  They wouldn't go into much detail about it in text chat. Then they said good luck and I'm sorry for Aaron scamming you. I'm going to delete the messages of our conversation from discord. I thought that was really really weird.  
---
Later on I log onto runescape and seen his main account has been banned and the iron that he deironed to scam me had his name changed to RNG with some numbers behind it. Still to this day many months later that account has not gained 1 expierence point. So its a feelsgoodman for me that someone got him back. Sorry if this is a bit hard to read I've typed this just as I've woken up.
---
I mean, saying that "nobody enjoys mindlessly clicking continuously" is DEFINITELY a false statement. Runescape literally revolves around the grind, most of which involves continuously clicking mindlessly; take ardy knights for example.
---
The achievement doesn't mean much when you've gotten over 20+ 99's over the years, it was a genuinely fun skill.
---
This hits too close to home
---
now someones catching my wave, i just want a world that I dont gotta grind for 2000 total levels (which is a lot btw) but without the noobs
---
split i tb'd
---
Yes exactly. So instead of shift clicking every single item, these are bad items u can just add to the list all at once.
---
We won't crucify you for saying that, but I will point out that every single cape has less prestige than back in 2007. And the distance between 2004 (when RS2 was released) and 2007 was about 3ish years. While the distance between OSRS release date in 2013 and now is 6 years. So even with the reset there's been twice as much time for leveling and QoL updates.
---
you better win!
---
Thats not how PKing works, If someone attacks me im being PKed, fighting back isnt PKing, 99% of players arent going to be able to kill a PKer, especially if they are taken by surprise by people hoping worlds, PKers take specialized gear, weapon swaps, specific foods... If im farming archeologist and get attacked i might as well pack it in becuase im not going to be able to beat that with my full mage 1 spell setup designed to kill aboss.
---
But i dont expect people to understand that, PKers will literally make up any bullshit reason to never allow PvP change, unless it directly benefits them, like taking out emblem farmers, or preventing rushers and other TPers.
---
The tried and true, "It hasn't happened to me, therefore doesn't exist". Americans sre dumb lol.
---
What's the current situation with Warding? Are they mainly just focusing on Priffdinas and player support before talking about it again?
---
3.5-4m an hour withiut rares. And with rares ir varies soooo much
---
Ah bet
---
Grow a neckbeard and you'll have something in common with all the pkers who hate pvmers
---
Sounds like somebodyyy needs to get laid
---
Most first-time players don't specialise really, every skill in the game is needed somewhere, and by not training one you might restrict yourself from certain content such as quests or minigames.
---
Likely not. What setup would you be going with?
---
I think the "Useless" part is the bit that kills my enthusiasm for the skill the most. There's basically always something better to kill to farm runes, rather than making them directly. 
---
If I was the one in charge of remaking rune-making I'd probably drop the reqs for a bunch of runes and make the multiples come into play a little earlier.
---
Yeh as previous comment have stated some monster can have attacks as such ‚Äúmelee based magic attacks‚Äù so you may think it‚Äôs obvious what you have to pray but sometimes it‚Äôs not. Look on the wiki and it will tell you what to use.
---
Even if I have a spirit tree in my house?
---
I don't miss volcano personally.
---
Combat in RS has always been boring to me. I stopped being a lvl 75 scrub when I saw there were some challenges that were not simply a matter of time and actually challenging (ie; not everyone has an inferno cape, and raids are very MMO-like and not a solo experience) so I became invested in learning it more seriously. Never really understood all the tricks with prayer or enemy pathing so that was nice.
---
But I still always thought runescape's combat was... Like... If that's a major reason you play, I feel like there are hundreds of MMO's with much more involving combat.
---
Lol who is this
---
They‚Äôd probably spending more on electricity keeping the bots running tbh, how often do ironmen even pk?
---
Do u actually have 1 con or did u edit lol
---
In most practical terms, people don't include scythe as max melee since you probably wouldn't use it for general (non-boss) slayer/training. Same goes for infernal cape, though that's because the gear and skill reqs to get it are pretty out of reach for most people who can get the other parts of max melee setup.
---
if anything they should have them doing bot busting or something, ban all of the filth at the GE spamming, that would improve the quality of the game so much with almost no real effort since they don't have like any active pmods doing it from what I can tell
---
that or train them in customer support/have people working to fix the broken system :^)
---
it's less cheating than other clients, so it is more legit. it's more of a justification than anything else.
---
Yo I'd love a link if possible :)
---
A few months ago I kept getting a bug where adding a spammer to my ignore list also ignored the chat of a few other people in the vicinity. Not sure if they ever fixed that
---
Why is herblore so expensive?
---
From an economic perspective its basically the same as cooking, but is much less afk and has lower experience rates, and is much more expensive.
---
Think they didn't want people abusing it for xp. Kinda outdated position now though seeing as there are like 5 new tree patches that give way more xp than spirit trees would.
---
&gt; Now i have no background in economics, but wouldn't a spike in players also mean more demand for that item, causing it to go up? 
---
You would be correct, but many players aren't buying these items because there aren't any big pvm updates or ulterior reason to buy them. So, what's actually happening is more of these items are coming in than usual, but because there's no emergence to buy them they're all taking a pretty big dip.
---
People should be using a fresh email with absolutely no ties to anything else and a secure password. Check everything against Have I Been Pwned.
---
&gt;It might take a day or two for botters to write a script for it
---
Or they could not write a script for it and just stay in the worlds that don't require extra effort. Sure, some will bleed into these worlds, but far fewer than normal.
---
how‚Äôd you afford 82 con?
---
Haha I plan on it; we still need to think of a punishment if you have any ideas. So far I was think the loser has to stake 1/4 of their bank and winner gets it if they win the stake
---
Thanks for this post, I couldn‚Äôt agree more. There‚Äôs an awful lot of asskissing in the comments here still.
---
Reality is though, unless people vote with their wallets then nothing will change. Some folks are addicted to Runescape, there are no substitutes. It‚Äôs something like a monopoly. But that‚Äôs the price we pay for capitalism. Which is a flawed system, but the best one the world has known.
---
This pasta leaves a bad taste in my mouth
---
I like how Konduit used to do it. You had to hold shift for it to work. So you could still deposit your equipment when you needed to but would never accidentally click it.
---
It's probably lower but when you do certain things at fossil island house gst small medium large fossils which can be built into displays in the varrock museum when cleaned, I remember checking when I was but a small noob and remember 500k xp as the total reward.
---
I was getting 25k/hour at ZMI from 60-77 but I was semi-afk and not using stam pots
---
Don't remember where, but I remember reading foot pedals were legal as long as it's 1:1 actions because some people actually use them for actual accessibility issues.
---
Hahaha oh man that's brutal!
---
The one that says fandom is an old/outdated one.
---
Is that with sgs?
---
I usually bring 8-9 ppots, one scb and one range (using preserve the whole time). Usually lasts about 25 kills.
---
‚ÄúTLDR: The less you have to pay attention to something while maintaining a decent/high xp rate = more afk‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you would turn it into a precise number but it would be the intensity of attention required for decent/good outcome. Lower intensity would of course be higher rating.
---
I believe construction was originally designed as a gold sink, so a cheap way of training kinda defeats the original purpose (not that this would be a bad thing, with all the new stuff added to the skill)
---
Maybe it's time to upgrade from picking flax.
---
something something hitler
---
Ya.
---
even without SGS you're really only limited by scb/range pot. If you tryhard and do offensive prayer switches you can be ppot limited but obviously you can just bring rests/more rests
---
This deserves so many more upvotes
---
What about them?
---
We used to be active on the FANDOM site, but we moved to the new site after being fed up with their consistent track record of lack of care towards editors and visitors.
---
You can see a [detailed list of reasons](https://runescape.wiki/w/Forum:Leaving_Wikia) for our migration.
---
Me too my dude.
---
Nope probably thinking of someone else. Me and the guy who‚Äôs competing for first both started level 67 and both around 80-81 now
---
*Laughs in fire cape*
---
Sorry overlord robotto-sama I will go back to editing the wiki UwU
---
Chinning to 99 is going to fuck your mom‚Äôs credit card statement
---
wow dude nice
---
I‚Äôm not using rl+ only heard of it few days ago. I‚Äôm a raiders mostly on my other account so have tob plugins
---
i wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say a tough 99, but definitely a very time consuming one, im always amazed when people‚Äôs first 99s are farming, gratz OP.
---
Can't trade on a jmod acc, also 2 corrupt is 2 too many
---
Thank you for your kind words &lt;3
---
Really not sure man. I was excited to finally get cape and everything and nervous about boss. And watching Slayermusiq's guide. Just distracted I guess. That's why I was so confused at first. Kept saying "there's no way I didn't notice it in here."
---
really? why is that?
---
no
---
If you mean Why can't trade. Because of exactly what OP said, generating gold and selling it.
---
we dont do that here.jpg
---
rs3 says hi
---
quality meme üëå
---
I love slayer so much that when I hit 99 slayer on this account I started slaying in my alt. Just hit 99 slayer on the alt about a week ago.
---
both of them, separately
---
i stand corrected, i was at 2k with some stats in the high 70s but forgot i had max combat and didnt take that into consideration.
---
God I hope not. I don‚Äôt want to have another long grind like runecrafting and mining...
---
Iunno bout dat one m8
---
Cool story bro
---
What is that
---
I think it's most important to remember that this is a game that will take thousands of hours to "complete," even if you do everything with the utmost efficiency. Just chill out and relax. Unless you know exactly what to do every step of the way and play the game like it's your full time job... It's going to be well over a year or two (Or 12, in my case) before you see the end game content.
---
You can see this as a daunting task, or a nice adventure. Just depends on the way you look at it.
---
99 farming at 72 combat holla
---
That‚Äôs a 99 I can confidently say i‚Äôll never get, but  congratulations!
---
I cried when i was 8 because i kept losing in fist of guthix
---
I think 700m in 15 years says enough bud.
---
This isn‚Äôt a conversation about people displaying their accomplishments its about shoehorning it into every aspect of the game. Keep up.
---
Lol are you comparing your stats to op's?
---
My younger brother had his acc hacked, they did nothing but ignore him until he quit.
---
When you get 75 and can use giant pouches you can get over 40k/hr at zmi if you pay attention but yeah the rates are awful, even lavas which are 5x more click intensive and lose gp are 50-60k/hr if you sweat. Fastest method is lavas with runners but will cost &gt; 1b to 99
---
It hits its dead body
---
Yeah I can tell. I'm so close to 99 mage haha
---
I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else, but the closer I get to max (2220ish atm), the less relaxed about it I become. 
---
I think it‚Äôs the idea that the finish line is in sight so now it‚Äôs time to go extra hard. Probably bad for my mental health tbh
---
Yes. Turn off the RuneLite GPU plugin usually helps. Also zooming in a lot helps.
---
In my mind it‚Äôs better because at least it‚Äôs not drugs or alcohol.
---
Life bad
---
RS good
---
Then don‚Äôt do the clues lol
---
Less - it only was averaging like 120k players on at any given time and had been declining for many years. Doubt it will pull pull any more than like 60k.
---
I mean, you can pick up planks at BA I guess
---
do it u god dam cowards
---
Sell your bank for irl  cash and then rebuild .....then repeat
---
Im pumped for this!!! I use loudout.tf for my tf2 needs so this will fit right in
---
Yeah these are definitely big deals for people, especially first timers
---
I know how it felt and I still have plenty I've not done yet
---
I think reddit though is the last place to share, cause we're less of a community more of a forum
---
My first 99 on OSRS as well. I really enjoy the teleports to the guild for banking and the spirit trees planted all over :) 
---
Untrimmed farm cape bros
---
Forgot about curved/long bones. I have a bunch of those cause i havn't done the Dorgeshuun quest yet. Guess that gives me a good mini goal, thanks.
---
I think there is a lot of fun content before base 70 stats. Void would definitely not be needed there. Members is just a lot more fun when training those levels than f2p. If you don't have so much time to play, I don't see what's wrong with wanting members to spice it up, even if you aren't "ready for the real grind".
---
I enjoyed grinding and merching to buy my membership with bonds, but others might not. If you're playing more casually, I could see, why you'd not want to kill ogresses for 30 hours. That's a month of the same thing, if you play osrs an hour every day
---
Global, with the exception of Krystilia, who has a completely separate tracker.
---
That‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs still alive kek
---
Or not lol
---
Meh
---
So go do them and unlock more quests? I'm not seeing the issue.
---
Hahaha this is Jagex fault?
---
I'm well aware, that doesn't change the fact. Runlite and runelite plus are still partially closed source. That's not a problem if you trust the maintainers, but I personally don't trust a client that was created solely because they want to break rules set by jagex and they can't do that on the standard runelite.
---
haha i realized how painful it must have been once i failed 2 out of the 4 times i went over the bridge at 40 agitlity.
---
Awesome thanks man!
---
makes no sense. seems private server ish.
---
Can we call the skeleton ‚ÄúLil‚Äô boner‚Äù?
---
Yikes
---
Yeah, this function was known as ‚Äúrest‚Äù and was added around 2009ish, not 2007. You‚Äôd recover run energy faster and they added musicians around the world that you‚Äôd rest and to regain run energy even faster.
---
Also, you didn‚Äôt mention raids. Lots of pvmers really want 90 herblore for overloads. This is seen by the potions at 90+ netting a profit while also having better xp/hr
---
This is literally one of my only complaints about the game. Everything is behind locked doors upon locked doors and 90% of those doors are members only which is understandable. My problem came after I bought a membership and literally just tried exploring the world and seeing what's where.
---
Your name is fucking amazing
---
q
---
It definitely wasn't in 2007. I think it was added around 2009-2010.
---
Aggressive
---
I wonder what kind of effects this would have on the economy and such. 
---
As I type this, there are probably botters trying to see if they could exploit this by camping the party room.
---
???
---
Yeah they do. The healing effect allows the player to stay for about 150% of the time compared to when you wouldn't have it. It's overall DPS is higher thus the kills are faster too. If you're looking at pure profit you might ever out on profit when using it, though I certainly know that you get more kills per hour because of it. I don't know the exact math though.

I expected to see all levels at 92 for some reason

Apologies. I use a script that when a Jmod replies to a post I see it as a "J-mod reply" then a jmod crown next to it. Often you see replies to big ticket posts, but I like to see the jmods interact with post like these.
---
Go for it. If it's really bad your post will just get deleted, no-one gets banned here.
---
Anime level story.
---
That‚Äôs why I use slayer staff (e) which does more damage than trident and costs less.
---
You talking about Colorado? Sounds like Colorado paying $1700 for a 2 bedroom
---
Just raise membership to $15 already. No one's gonna quit over 4 bucks.
---
The cannon is atrociously frustrating and buggy, and perfect exactly how it is.
---
Nah in Washington state, Kitsap County (Seattle Area)
---
It's attack is a tick slower though so in total does quite a bit less dps than trident still.
---
&gt; Definitely a crazy first 99
---
I don't mean to be a dickhead, but it's incredibly common
---
It's like the Slayer of skilling- many mobile users mainly just do farming and birdhouse runs
---
Or their bot detection is already okay and they just keep making new ones? This game *has* been out for awhile and it is technically really mechanically simple. It's not the easiest thing to distinguish some of the more advanced bots. It's also sort of like evolution. It's really quite fascinating. Majority of a species dies out, only the ones with better random adaptations wins. In this case, the bots with better human like behaviors are more likely to survive. Only in this case, the evolution is trying to actively work against them. But kill them too fast, instead of slow like a poison, they'll know what adaptations to keep and which to get rid of, making their job exponentially more difficult. Banning them right away creates a sort of super bot (like a super virus) with advanced abilities to avoid the bot detection (like antibiotics).
---
Well I end up with a huge profit so idk
---
Hey get an obsidian sword if you can, the armor will give it a 30% damage boost
---
It‚Äôs probably a book with a similar name
---
Yeah, I'm sure you end up with more profit per task than with a trident.
---
It would just be slower, so profit/hour is actually a bit less
---
Just attach a very sensitive button to your eye lashes. Only problem is no sleep. Who needs sleep though
---
Oh fer sure lmfao I'm nearly 73
---
Oh I'm relatively new to the game and forgot about raids. thanks for the addition.
---
Ive played so many years and never once heard this. Thank you!
---
Kurask use snore!
---
Anti-Cheat is another one of those teams shared around the company. That said, expanding it would likely help with the bot issue. Still, not directly an OSRS staff thing even if some of those teams could do with expansion too.
---
Perhaps it'd be best to try it out? 
---
I think you deal significantly less damage to the respiratory systems (if any) if sire is awake, so mage is probably pretty beneficial. Not sure if the respiratory systems are in reach of melee. Might need to use a halberd to hit them if that's the case. Gl
---
This whole situation, to me at least, feels very situational.
---
Let's say that I take time to orchestrate running a raid with a dedicated team of people. If we schedule time to practice, take on individual roles, master the roles we dedicate to, and gear specifically for those roles, that means we are taking the time to work at this as a collective group. If this is the case, you better damn well believe I'm going to be open to splitting all the loot. If I know a group of guys well enough to dedicate scheduled time to a singular cause, I would be more than happy to ensure they get a fair share of the large pot, especially if they pull their weight and contribute to full clears with minimal deaths.
---
On the other hand, if I'm in a PUG with a bunch of randos who I don't know or barely communicate with, FFA seems much more appropriate. Leave it to RNG to dictate who gets what, especially if that main dictation is based on performance. If I am lucky to snag a TBow when another groupie died four times and didn't get a purple...Why should I have to share my loot with that guy? 
---
I don't know. I don't think there is a common ground in either situation. Me personally, I'm the kind of person who will usually suggest the split in any group, regardless of how much I make when nobody else gets a drop. But I understand where the hangups can be. It's not a black or white issue. It's pretty grey.
---
I'm surprised nobody else associate him to the bodybuilder because  Zyzz was a pretty big runescape player , everyone knew about him/chestbrah back then
---
You're actually 100% right, I'm not used to games like this. And i definitely do not want to down on people who do enjoy these kinds of games. But I just think back to how it almost made me wanna quit. I obviously didnt, I stuck through and got where I am. But how many people do quit because of this?
---
I know it's a meme but being at 56 from only doing tears starting earlier this year...this post gives me hope for bloods in the future
---
Gz dude. Your RNG is insane. Hope I get that pet soon!
---
nice
---
Did this ever work? did you use a clan? I need answers lol
---
But what's the chance of losing 10 duels in a row?!? /s get out while you can
---
I think it fits that role perfectly. It wouldn‚Äôt really change xp rates realistically either, but would keep me from getting so annoyed at seeing ‚ÄúFILL‚Äù when they are full. Or not seeing ‚ÄúEmpty‚Äù when they are full.
---
I didn't think of using a halberd. Thanks for the insight
---
This game needs a good item sink BAD
---
Ok but it‚Äôs BiS for 388 def exp lol. Idk if this really falls under ezscape
---
you have a firm grasp on sarcasm
---
I did bone voyage on the third day of a fresh account. Stop complaining and start grinding.
---
love it and down for it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty much just a cosmetic armor for photo op moments
---
Hopefully not :)
---
you right. I'm curious why the cooking page is not up to date. I don't have 99 cooking, forgive me.
---
** C H E S T B R A H**
---
I never try for pet. It‚Äôs a cool reward if I happen to get it, but I‚Äôll never boss in order to get a pet, I‚Äôd only go for the loot.
---
Not an issue imo, the issue is what the other dude says, palms are cheap af now. It's like any time there's a good expensive item that's used sparingly as a good item in drop tables, jagex makes a new monster that shits them out and crashes the price, ruining it for any old monster that dropped them.
---
Nah
---
Was exactly what I was thinking too. This dude realizes 90% of Ironman aren‚Äôt going to kill anyone in the wildy. If they do 99% of the time it‚Äôs going to be like black d‚Äôhide and mystic because most irons aren‚Äôt killing anyone in halfway decent gear unless they dc or something.
---
His username is in the screenshot, check hiscores. He actually has 1 construction. Funniest shit I've ever seen tbh
---
"I haven't experienced the specific problem you have so therefore it's clearly not a problem dummy"

nice.

Better not catch any black arm gang over on my block üò§üò§
---
I'm upset

 A
---
Keep deluding yourself man. I don‚Äôt use 3rd party clients, don‚Äôt visit shady sites, and don‚Äôt do stupid shit in general with my account info. I‚Äôve never needed to worry about getting my account stolen in 16 years of playing.
---
Haven't trained since 40 I'm now 74... every time I forget to check if RC is my lowest skill and get xp in prayer I die a little.
---
Like when people flame me for wearing my obsidian helm with bcp and tassy. I love my lobster head.
---
It contains 3 months of membership.
---
You only pay for 2. Thats it.
---
Frick, I doubted it was an original joke but gave it a try anyway
---
U need to get 4 onyxes to make your zenyte so just keep it for that, 1 onyx is 360k tokkul btw
---
U mirin??? Come at me
---
I support the top comment but we all know this won't happen because the game needs item/money sinks
---
i forgive your english
---
but only have 750 total level is an unforgivable sin
---
Aroo-dah-nooge
---
You can tailor your account to do medium clue scrolls. [Here are the requirnments](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll_(medium)). I'd also recommend [the falador medium diaries](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Falador_Diary) so you dont waste all your gold on eclectic implying jars.
---
Nah, most people prefer to invest hundreds of hours doing something fun which probably doesn't make billions of gp, otherwise everyone would do it and it wouldn't be so profitable.
---
Yeah now that I'm thinking back to the old cartoons. This makes sense as he usually just tied people up for the cops to take care of them. I can't think of a time he killed anyone.
---
Didn't know he was ham strong af though lol.
---
I thought that was why he was called chestbrah lol because he is the 'brother' of Rendi helping him get gains.
---
C
---
It's too late, they should have culled that shit right when the first 3rd party clients started showing up. But they just let it, and it just got to a point where banning them would hurt more than it would help.
---
&gt;without properly thinking them through
---
OPs justification for buffing prayer armor
---
&gt;feel free to suck my nutz
---
Thats true, but dont forget some people are not veterans and these messages truly help them out! :)
---
There‚Äôs only one way to build a pure. /s
---
Compost potion I think
---
It's one of the reasons I filter out anything flaired "achievement". Kinda sucks cause I miss the crazy 50 combat infernal cape kinda stuff, but in return I don't need to see 20 fire capes and 50 1 kc magic fangs
---
r/modashgifs
---
I mean no one cares about them either way so it really makes no difference
---
Voor deze Comment kwam ik, bedankt!
---
You don‚Äôt have to train agility at all till like 36
---
It's hard to think of an RPG where maxing a skill takes 100 hours alone lmao.
---
However you wanna justify it I guess, but its still super shitty. If you agree to split and then take off with a tbow you're a piece of shit in my book.
---
I just discuss it whenever raiding with a new group before we enter. Takes any misunderstanding out of it.
---
It‚Äôs the summer
---
what are you laughing at bro? rwt is not a laughing matter kid...rwt helps fund bin laden u idiot kid bet u dont evan have a 10 million coin bank (i have 1.2b just so u know)? What does "Make America Great Again" mean? Some people think this means getting rid of gay rights, bringing back segregation, taking away women's voting rights, ect. How about none of these things? Maybe getting rid of Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instragram, ect. would be a catalyst for making America great again. Working class adults were able to function just fine without social media in the past. If we are less distracted, we have more time to focus on the economy and improving America. Social media is not a part of our every day lives. We don't have an urge to 'check in' every 5 minutes or check on everyone else's status. We don‚Äôt give two shits about if you like our post or not. Social media is a rolodex to us.
---
Gilded 4 times LMAO
---
Just remember a combat level 18 fire cape is out there and UIM Verf did it with leather and bronze knives. So it should be a breeze for your btw.
---
Yeah fuck you OP, fucking retard
---
  
---
Wait
---
Yeah. And he didn‚Äôt even use that he drank a strength def and attack pot.
---
I've never smoked crack, but damn I SMASH the run button when I'm out of energy.  I could use my ornate pool, but nooo I'd rather limp along going from 0 to 1 energy like a binary.
---
fire cape was the first task i did for the elites. GL!
---
For real, I chill in a smaller Youtuber's cc sometimes and I've legitimately seen some kid call out \*every single\* construction level from 50 to 83. Blows my mind.
---
First post to make me say "ooo I actually love that idea!"
---
Women cant resist a Slayer cape
---
It‚Äôs ok still respect you for at least having your facts right....kudos to you sir
---
Honestly this, OP almost sounds bitter cause he's bad at the game lmao
---
damn, gotta take a break
---
Cb 18 with a firecape.. fk ledge
---
Thank you :)
---
14.5k upvotes off a random idea we tossed around my guy, I think it has potential!
---
When it hits something 3 times, all 0‚Äôs
---
Very lucky lol
---
Dead ass. If you get hacked it‚Äôs because you‚Äôve been pwned or give enough personal information out.
---
Next month some time.
---
Ah gotcha, hadn't thought of the pvp aspect with smite
---
bro.. thats pretty fringe..
---
I have a background in computer science, and took modules in crypto. No one is getting hacked through computational power, no matter how big. The problem space is too large. People get hacked because they do not practice good security tips. Jagex gives them away for free and stronghold of security tells them how to be secure - but people don't take the advice.
---
Is that not who Rendi named his character after?
---
From your point of view, please tell me how customer support is lacking?  
---
If were purely judging it from twitter or reddit posts, there have been more smackdowns than actual "we'll investigate this for you".
---
Ik Reddit like to slob on the RL devs dick but they aren't fully open source. Their injector (the most important part) is closed source. RL+ is fully open source. Stay safe kids.
---
The wilderness slayer tasks can be accessed by anyone &amp; isn‚Äôt stuck behind a level requirement. 
---
Each task will be in the wilderness, so there‚Äôs a convenience buff due to how easy it is to get around.
---
The rate at which you receive points for completing task is much faster than other slayer masters (especially at low level).
---
The thing people need to eradicate from their mind when playing this game is that you HAVE to use one method for doing EVERYTHING.
---
Nobody is suggesting you spam wilderness slayer all day every day to make the most money in the game... this is just a slight update for the people that want to do it/haven‚Äôt given it a shot already
---
It is stored clientside in memory in plaintext. During the login procedure it is encrypted, sent, and the encrypted password is discarded (as it serves no purpose to the client as it cannot be decrypted without the private key).
---
CryptProtectMemory can be decrypted freely by the process that called it.
---
Ah ok
---
Do whatever you enjoy imo. If you want to make some money, try bossing. Zulrah might be good to start off on since there's not really a penalty for death. If you want to stay up to date on the new content, I believe Prifddinas releases next month/some time this year and to access it you need to finish Song of the Elves, so you can also work on the quests for that:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song\_of\_the\_Elves](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Song_of_the_Elves)

I was surprised to learn that potato foods were not added until 2005. Tbf I don't think I ever used one until osrs, but I assumed it was an rsc item honestly.

To efficiently tank bandos 90 def is a must

I see good luck with your grind brother I got bored of the max grind and started a UIM instead
---
&gt;based on science
---
Would love to see your sources :)
---
Theres a bit of everything in the wild haha, thank you
---
So you don't mind slow xp rates then?
---
Honestly RS is the only MMO i've ever played. Other ones seem too...I dunno toxic I guess. Up until I got my RS account, I've been a single player console game type of guy.
---
Suggestion:shut up
---
I choose to believe this is one guy with 46 clients open.
---
provided you have the level do sharks in the hosidius kitchen with cooking gauntlets. I did 70-99 cooking in like a week and a half solely while playing league of legends
---
Of course this varies how much hours you spent into the game. But the grim truth is, if you want to success in OSRS, you either have to spend thousands of hours for exp gains or be a good learner for doing skill-determined stuff like PvP or end-game PvM.
---
Truly the hardest part of early ironman
---
snelm
---
Ye sure, but it's not a hard req. And currently you're not doing Bandos at all, so how efficient is that
---
I approve this, but only if done correctly. Usage of hues is key factor to make this work and appealing to one's eye.
---
As for the armour itself, it wouldn't make them any better nor worse - just gives an opportunity to show your Ironman status without screwing up your combat stats too much.
---
?
---
Honestly one of the best, if not the best OSRS videos ive seen
---
How do I get the Items, Skills and Minimap on a seperate box on the right like many people have?
---
I assume it's a runelite plugin, but I can't find it. I thought it was interface options.
---
get in a clan lol
---
He made the account with 7 years old then? People can have typos too.
---
Keyboard warrior over here. Knows nothing about my acc, but thinks he knows all my stats.
---
But my quest cape
---
Make sure you drop and telegrab that cape before your future 99s to keep it untrimmed! That‚Äôs a cool untrimmed, id get a few in case you lose one
---
????????
---
I couldn't tell them apart
---
You are the proper definition of arrogant.
---
Just add PvP armour/weapons
---
Statius, vesta etc
---
I've tried many addictive things and video games (specifically OSRS) is by far the most addictive
---
I got from 6m to about 89m woodcutting at redwoods and trust me, they are not as relaxing.
---
suggestion: shut the FUCK up
---
Rune armor on an ironman isn't an achievement lmfao
---
why
---
As someone who has done both can confirm rs is probably worse than the drugs.
---
Big adventure**
---
Lol I had some dude I met like the day before ask me to be the third for a bandos trip I said sure why not I'll come for a trip or two. Get there and they both expected me to tank without ever telling me that before lol
---
When does this happens? Sorry full graceful owners can't relate

T
---
The guy you replied to is on about RWT you smeghead, not OP  
---
How can you be so thick?
---
Par-dug-knee
---
In a pvp world this would be insane
---
English might not be OPs first language. Or he might just be 12.
---
I remember seeing this posted on forums.
---
Alternatively the items get moved to the chest in Falador, and the ironman can trigger it when they want. To let loot build up or wait for enough people to arrive
---
You can set chrome to do this as well as I and many others have and you don‚Äôt even need the exclamation mark
---
D
---
Nice
---
Elaborate?
---
üëå

How so? They increase dps by a fair amount

---
custom search engine you can set up on almost every browser, you choose your own prefix or what it's called. I have mine set to 07 so everytime you wanna seatch wiki you type 07 or whatever you chose

To be fair you could probably pull off any 3 at once.

Nice try duckduckgo marketing employee

yegg please hire me

RoosterTeeth Podcast as well. Maybe backlog and they are almost all in their YouTube channel.

woah that's cool

---
pretty sure the meta is to swap between accurate and defensive when attacking/geting hit
---
Wtf is this shit
---
I find that foreigners have a better grasp on rules like that when learning the language, compared to many of the dumber native speakers. If you study the language it's pretty obvious the difference between stuff like two/to/too and there/their/they're.
---
Couldn't you just go pick it back up
---
I had exactly the same experience, and I got to keep my 99 melee stats that the gold farmers got for me lmao
---
Grind some Hill Giants, they poop out a lot of them.
---
Are they going as hard? 3 days in nearly at 1.8m+ rc xp :c
---
What are your stats?
---
I've just finished DS2 with 70 def/75 ranged, and I'm kinda scared to attempt post quest Vork lol
---
No, never.
---
LOL!!
---
You definitely need higher range and magic
---
I think I did do that when trying to recover the account. My situation is really complicated because the player created an oldschool account but I owned it back in rs2 days. I think they looked at more recent information after so many years and only the oldschool client information and not the original information.
---
I used to sell unidentified herbs and knowingly excluded rannars. Then ID'd them at Talvery and sold them at full price. 
---
circa 2006.
---
why not
---
Yeah it worked I used oak dice and it went smoothly.
---
As the US has shown us that democracy is a joke, I wholeheartedly agree.
---
not nice

And its gone

Stop... He's already dead üò≠
---
Did you have a specific or favorite tile on which you placed the cannon?
---
Only reason I still use catacombs is ancient shards but I have like 30 banked and 7k charges inside. Finished skotizo the other day also. I really like how most monsters aggro you so you can afk for 5+ mins with prayer pots
---
Need moar ezscape
---
Idk why beggars don't just find an ultimate friend, plenty stuff that I don't need and give to normies.
---
When magic staves were first added back in the day (the ones with the black orb) I bought up the shop stock and sold them for like 10-20k each lol
---
Nice guy, last time I was trying to be friend with pker I got killed on wildy agility course with nothing than sharks and summer pies, he didn‚Äôt even bothered to respond üôÉüôÉ
---
Aye - there's one you can double hit on from the starting safespot - you can find it easily just Google "twisted bow cannon giant mole"
---
Going to try do more solo raids - also complete Breath of the Wild
---
Is that a fuckin white beret
---
Do it and you will be able to afford good combat gear soon enough
---
i think cannon is overpowered anyway
---
i agree. they just lack a jmod with pvp knowledge altogether.
---
Please dont
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be the most efficient no but it‚Äôs a good place to start, other than that I guess get 99 Hunter ticking Black Chins for gear money
---
1/1024000 *** although each duel is just 50/50 so
---
I hated doing Lava runes... the need to be extra attentive to a skill that's bare bones monotonous and degrading enough does not make me want to push any harder on it... I would rather run through the abyss 1000 times than do that.   
---
At this point I don't care how slow it gets, as long as it gets done...
---
Watch literally any Rendi video and you'll see.

Rendi emphasizes CHESTBRAH's name in a funny way every time he says it.

Tbf, you should've reported instead of posting. If everyone posts stuff like this then what are potential new players supposed to think of this community?
---
thats some determination lmao
---
Made it out of high school with stellar grades.
---
Made it to university, played video games and RuneScape everyday. Took a 3 year hiatus after failing some classes across a couple semesters in my 4th year of university ‚Äî to save some money and finish on my own terms when I was confident enough. 
---
Working crappy min. Wage cooking job, to barely making much more managing the restaurant. 
---
With some good connections and some help, I was able to find a tech role at the university I went to (surprisingly not requiring a degree). Over the past couple years, I‚Äôve picked up a few trades, made a living as a subcontractor, handyman, roof repairman etc., and I finally have a good amount of money put away to take the next step in my life when I start school again beginning next year.
---
School and work proved very challenging for me, the same way it does for everyone. Life happens in different ways to different people. I‚Äôve met a wonderful girl who we‚Äôve recently found, is pregnant with our child and I‚Äôve never been happier. 
---
Even this goof found love, and all I‚Äôm saying is, I thought it‚Äôd never happen just a few years ago. I still play RuneScape, not daily, but multiple times a week!
---
I think the P/E ratio you used is a bit too high for a company that‚Äôs not a stellar growth company. Yes you are right they were sold for a decent amount when they were less profitable but that price would have had a ton of future potential baked into it.
---
Tell me how you've ever tried using support
---
*insert crabs* * jagex bad crabs gud*
---
The ‚Äúreduce run energy depletion‚Äù effect is from STAMINA potion, graceful only increase run energy restore rate when walking/standing. Basically useless for every single activity that includes running. Have you even played the game i wonder?
---
Once they start dropping more people panic sell and they drop faster. It will stop eventually and people who dumped their gear will want it back
---
I took some creative license with that one, a diet Sprite instead.
---
Just get some money. What's up w/ people saying they don't have enough money, just get some then. In rs it's eaay to make a couple mill while getting levels up. You're decently leveled as well.
---
Didn't you get recovered for that tbow? lul
---
O my god nobody cares
---
That‚Äôs false.  The invisible boot from the attack style change is either +3 ***levels*** to Attack or Defense respectfully.  That‚Äôs a pretty big change in odds against someone ***who doesn‚Äôt*** flick.
---
Chesty brah I‚Äôm mirin‚Äô. Chuck us a muzz while we are in between sets
---
Jagex kind of update their game in a stupid way in that they try to keep all this old content relevant where as other massive gaming companies simply accept there's going to be dead content and move on with the game. 
---
There's no reason they couldn't add basically an expansion worth of material every year in terms of increased level caps, tiers of weapons/resources, quests/bosses, etc... This even comes with the advantage of if they screw up it doesn't ruin the game since every expansion is basically a reset button for the game/economy. 
---
But yeah it's hard to tell what the right thing to do would really be. I certainly question whether this iteration of OSRS where they just let the players decide is really the best way to do it considering no other game/business operates this way.
---
The main benefit to developing RS2 on the OSRS path would be that they would have had developed mobile for when smart phones were taking off where runescape would have been in a prime position to be a dominant phone/tablet game where as they instead decided to try and compete with other PC mmorpgs with EOC/Graphics updates that literally lost them players.
---
It was the healers that would make me freak out and fuck up. A black chins switch made them really easy.
---
&lt;&gt;&lt; lvls?
---
*Do stuff*
---
what are you on about idiot its 2\^10
---
Checks name out
---
If I‚Äôm understanding some of the other comments, the player who was pked can just go get their items right now off the ground
---
And it's a pretty decent game that no one wants to give a chance to. I also quit when EOC came out as it felt garbage back then but the current PVM is actually really fun. Shame about PKing though.
---
This is amazing, good work! As a web dev, I love the community coming up with these projects. Keep it up!
---
Zyzz's IRL older brother.
---
counter point: would you come to this sub if it was just achievement posts? no because no one actually gives a fuck we come here to talk about the state of the game updates and to shitpost memes
---
You can be a male character, you just can't complete that part that requires you to be a female.
---
he took like 100 hours to do fire cape. Inferno will take him like 1000?
---
Now someones speaking my languaGe
---
lol botter
---
Nahhh steroids aren‚Äôt that bad just don‚Äôt mix your drugs too often
---
I know its not much but I just brought gold and got 99 cooking!
---
Yeah, so being able to run longer distance with that run energy restored would in long term save up on potions you'd have to use.
---
Why so triggered?
---
yeah a fire cape difficulty compared to most modern games isnt actually hard. We just thought it was because we were kids
---
Should reupload hiding ur username bud
---
:crab: 11$ :crab:
---
Hes talking about zyzz. He always would go zyzzbrah and would say catch phrases such as sick cunt. He was an aussie bodybuilder who died.
---
How do you highlight your range switch
---
The cannon absolutely hates rats, I‚Äôve come to find out
---
Its not even that toxic
---
Yeah I know but the person who took the account from me made an osrs account with the login name. You can use the login name for both rs3 and osrs. So technically he still has it but I‚Äôm the original owner
---
why are you using increased performance mode in resizable
---
Lol why
---
Thanks :), and what kind of equipment/gear did you use?
---
1-1.5m
---
the only new armor is crystal armor, which is for range.
---
doing mods work\*
---
Sir Ni Ger
---
Max range I could with tbow and amethyst arrows :)
---
BP - 3.4m
---
Supplies ~ 1m
---
Void (elite) - free
---
Salve - free
---
*Noticing bulge* 0w0 - priceless
---
Try again
---
Idk teleports, spade, staminas and dds. Graceful optional.
---
*laughs in btw*

No it‚Äôs not one clearly ends with a ‚ÄúC‚Äù
---
There is an NPC de-agro timer if that's what you mean
---
Fuck me. I was getting 30k an hour and I was tryna sweat. Don't have magic imbue yet tho
---
got serp helm on kc 20 the other day was stoked
---
Because it takes patience? Certainly more respectful than cooking or fletching
---
How is wildy slayer OP lol? Its less XP than regular slayer and way less profit too, the only benefit it has is better points. And if you want to try to make it close to the same xp rates as regular slayer you have to cannon and use craws/chainmace and that means youre probably going to profit very little, if any since basically the only profit you get is from emblem drops unless you do wildy bosses for tasks...in which case youre getting shit xp.
---
I thought that had gotten nerfed recently?
---
Welcome aboard, destination is someonewhowilltellus-island
---
I would also like to know this
---
Still better than traditional Runecrafting...
---
Those were the days. I keep my RS3 account around just to look at the stats of where I stopped in OSRS before coming back just to look back and see how far I‚Äôve come and how difficult the game was for me back then
---
Pizza is fringe for members maybe, but used literally all the time in F2P for pvp. Ironmen constantly use potatoes as well, as well as boost giving pies, so I wouldn't really say fringe in that either.
---
What price falls exactly and why?
---
Its not a repost if you change the context slightly... hurr durr
---
Despawn timer for the food on the ground I believe he means
---
Wonder how many ironmans have the pet.Last time lottie tweeted it 8 ironmans had it.
---
Sauce for this?
---
2nd best would have been when you are first called out years ago, 3rd maybe a bit after, "now" is more like after having been blown up about it for years and hurting your playerbase and yourself you finally attempt to do something and despite being a billion dollar company are making near 0 fucking progress.
---
Damn, didn't profit from the implings, rip
---
Dude you wont lose your loots value in the drop what are you doing like 100kc lol I got 70m from 500kc from just the normal drops stop crying and go make some cash with it
---
I love you.
---
Rich get richer smh.
---
That's a horrible way to measure effectiveness of percentage boosts because 2-3 hits says absolutely nothing about the accuracy or max hit bonuses from piety.
---
I did some quick calcs and got that you do around 9.1 dps with piety + super combats + arclight + task at 95 str and 90 attack. 60% of 9.1 is 5.46 per tick, around 22 damage per hit since arclight is 4 ticks. Without task you'd do 4.26 dps and you'd do 17 damage per hit. On average you need 3 hits with both to reach the threshold but without piety you'd do 51 damage in 3 hits while with piety you'd do 66 damage with three hits. You get an additional 15 "overkill" damage which is roughly 29% more damage than without piety. 
---
I mean you can 100% disagree that using prayer pots is bad for your gp/h because piety drains it like mad, or that on an ironman you should save pots for cerb/hydra but you literally can't disagree that piety gives you more kills per hour.

Hahaha, that looks like a PvM pet. Even more so when you think about how everyone is trying to get it.

Just apply that grinding mentality to other aspects of your life. Workout each day for a bit, learn a new skill. You'll find you get slow but steady results, just like RS.

BOTTOM TEXT
---
That's sort of what I mean - a normal mouse would have tons of micro movements unless you blocked the sensor. So if there is literal zero movement and the exact same pixel is clicked every time I feel like that's sus
---
That's literally the fault of the owner. If you fall for social engineering, that's on you. If you provide enough info on your Reddit account, that's on you. This isn't quite the same thing as victim blaming but if you want to call it that, then sure there is ultimately more blame on the hacker, still not on jagex though
---
It's scary how you think drug users wouldn't play osrs
---
Priority: spade, whip, teleport runes(law/fire/dust/ water)
---
Additional: black d hide top/body, food
---
The reason why i dont bring the additional stuff is because i dont bring my bank if clues are in wildy.
---
It's kind of mad how you can be about a third of the way through an average lifespan and already think it's too late to do owt, but here I/we are.
---
A friend of mine just sent me a code for a one-month membership, but do I have to redeem right away/pretty soon? I have a lot going on at the moment and won‚Äôt really be able to play much, if at all. Will the code still work if a wait a couple months and then redeem it?
---
No slippers?
---
Someone hasn't tried cocaine
---
Does anyone know if keeping all 3 bludgeon piece uncombined remove them from the unsired table? Or do you just cycle through them again
---
I skipped torso lol... Proselyte is a godsend for afk slayer for those who like to afkscape a lot
---
I think Zyzz had some kind of heart defect as well. I can imagine that + steroids + party drugs + sauna can be pretty lethal.
---
I learned this 13 years too late. I used to hate questing but just started playing on a new account a couple days ago and am loving the quests. My last account was banned (botting, I was a stupid and lazy kid) so with my new one I decided to become a member. I've never been a member so I'm taking time to read what's going on. I never realized how much story I missed since I last played in like 2006
---
No.
---
Everything tanks then goes back. Don't worry it's you guys who panic sell which make it worse play the game forget about GP
---
Calm down dude
---
Just right click anywhere. No harm

Damn also 51 mins is pretty fast! Gzzz

Sweet, I added you. I'm not sure exactly what time I'll be able to get on, but if I see you online I'll shoot you a PM!

Me, but with Hunter. At least smithing you can get 300k xp an hour
---
Use watermelons on compost bin, when u do ur next farm run use volcanic ash on it and it turns into ultracompost.
---
121 and i still pick up beads too cuz sex sells.
---
Dope I‚Äôll keep my private on public!
---
Seems like you‚Äôre browsing in the wrong place if you don‚Äôt want OSRS content ?
---
It costs nearly nothing to upgrade from spear to hasta and you get an entire dragon defenders stats as an upgrade. There is no reason apart from corp beast to use spear over hasta.
---
Sweet thank you for sharing the source!
---
Could some sort of graphic be drawn over the items that indicates they can be clicked and dropped without any warning when the click to drop option is enabled?
---
No, I don't think you get it. I'm the one not in favor of RWT. That's the cutoff.
---
The opposite for me.  The past few weeks I‚Äôve been spending 40 hours a week at bloods where I‚Äôm operating at 50-60% efficiency.  (18k - 24k xp/hour)
---
I‚Äôm able to do this while I work or while playing xbox.
---
So because I value my time I‚Äôd rather get 1/4 xp while I‚Äôm doing more fun or more important things
---
do you know his new one?
---
You cycle through them again
---
If \_Civilized\_ account didn't exist I would think this comment is ridiculous

I do birdhouses so it's easy for me.

Join my cc "07 Bossing" we are free speech and bossing focused. Ranks are based on bossing and splitting drops, you won't gain a rank any other way, but there is no requirement to join and just hang out and chill with us. Half the members are social and the other half do bossing and raids. 
---
We have an active discord, our own facebook group, and plenty of bossing trips to go around. 
---
We also pay tanks a 10% bonus on trips. For example, if there is a 3 man trip to bandos and the total loot is 20m, 2m will be given to the tank then each player would get 6m each of the 18m left. 
---
We are also probably the only cc who allows dark and offensive humor. We have just one rule for speech: do not harrass people in the cc. If you go too far by making it personal or just spamming something racist we will warn you and kick you if you dont stop. Just dont be a dick. Lol. 
---
Anyways, if you have any questions lmk. :)
---
U done drugs bro??
---
he's not accusing him of anything, he's just posting a screenshot of what he said.  very different
---
Yep this guy definitely plays OSRS
---
According to Jagex, lower one is equal to konar but without konar‚Äôs uniques, and then the deep one is the same items as the lower one but in higher quantities on average
---
That's exactly what I used to think until I did a pro gamer move and immediately switched to the spellbook tab after supposedly equipping my greegree.
---
But actually though, I think it's just the routine. You don't really look at yourself equipping things, you just autopilot. No visual feedback loop after a while.
---
Yeah but the game literally starts at the endgame, osrs is about the whole game
---
what
---
Don't allow untradables to apply to click to drop.
---
I think these sorts of pieces are more about the overall expression and feeling of the painting rather than the minute details.
---
Is 69 woodcutting a joke to you?!? I‚Äôve been stuck at 69 wc for literally years. Sure, do I laugh when I look at stats? Yes. Does it even give me an erection? Sometimes. But have you ever stopped to think what its like to be one of these players? 
---
I feel more content locked than that nerd in Morytania.  I can‚Äôt even complete the all the hard diaries, do you know what that does to a man? I can‚Äôt sleep at night and when I actually do I dream of magic trees. Have you ever tried to smell a magic tree in your sleep? I have. It‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve ever gotten to cutting one down.
---
So OP, how about you get off your level 70+ high horse and farm some empathy instead or herbs for once. I get PTSD every time I go outside and see actual trees. So to combat this I log into OSRS and what do I see? More goddamn trees. It‚Äôs a living hell. If Dante‚Äôs Inferno had level of hell for this, well you can guess what level it would be.
---
So next time you ask ‚Äúwc levels‚Äù

Always kill the guy in full addy with a d scim fighting ice giants
---
Yeah but why zulreh when you can vorkath, also mage in cox is just for olm since there's 2 main magers I melee/mage
---
No there doesn't - that would be terrible in my opinion - would lower the pet from its true drop rate
---
No I just don't kill the eyes.
---
Nice writing OP. 
---
Sorry for your loss, I thought there was a warning before you dropped untradeables, or does that not work mobile?
---
I hate ironic weebs, fuck off
---
What? Did I not use capitalization and punctuation properly?
---
Prayer is quite afk though. Click the bone. Click altar. Wait like 30 seconds. Run out. Unnote bones. Repeat to 99.
---
You can PK at any level honestly.
---
I would bring 8 sharks and stay for 3-4 kills and then bank. Did that to 99.
---
I love this community.
---
Wouldn't I get creamed by people with high strength and range though? Since my defense and attack are pretty high it would put me in a bracket with high strength and rangers
---
Your friend casually took a beating from a mugger you brought to him?
---
Show text for ground items so we can see what's on the floor?
---
70 prayer for piety, 94 magic for veng, 75 attack for ags, and atleast 90 strength

if you can afford dclaws they help get him dead b4 digging too

dds works too

I got a lvl 66 or 67, can't remember. Shoot me a pm on here if you wanna do some stuff =]
---
I dont lose RS gains. When i have a surplus of GP I usually buy 3-5 bonds and use them in packages to get a few extra days. Never am I under about 100 days of members. Assuning within the available days I'll get a good drop or something to reup on days. üëÄ

not you, the OP

will keep that in mind, thanks!

He used to have skin on that skull

---
In case you're unaware, group ironman has already been talked about a few times on stream... when we will actually get it is another question
---
Man already has 27 pets; we actually talked for a bit as that was the starting topic of it all
---
Apologies, miss‚Äô
---
Or grinding herbs for seasoning like a normal person.
---
Problem there is the crates don't stack.
---
This is the best thing that could've possibly happened to you.  Walk away and don't look back
---
What are you trying to show here? You are 238 kc and didnt get the upgraded backpack?
---
Or a white trim for us UIMs
---
I do agree with your first sentence, however not the the second. Having a threshold doesn't mean you automatically get the pet after 3k kills, it just slightly increases your chance.
---
So as an example the drop is 1/3000. Once you hit 3k kills without the pet the drop rate becomes 1.5/3000 or 2/3000. The numerator can be increased by any number really. 
---
All this does on average, is that it allows people with super bad RNG/luck don't have to go 1/15k for a 1/3k pet, rather they get it around 6k-8k at most. 
---
Pets are cosmetics with no monetary value and dictated by rng with such low base drop rates so much so that I see no harm in just slightly increasing drop rate for people who are well passed the expected drop rate.
---
Touch√©
---
Their DIY support system is full of dead ends like this.
---
? What is the point of this post? You lured a mugger to a mining bot?
---
 Really good job glad you had fun 30 more will be deployed in the following minute
---
What the fuck is pog
---
text on ground items on official client like every game out there
---
Sure, it happens haha! It just gets posted so much that I feel like some people are just going to do it to get infamous on Reddit
---
Trimming armor scam. RIP
---
Legit every PC or Laptop my parents had I'd install Runescape and they'd always blame me for that shit. But everybody including themselves would always use limewire, my older brother was also downloading porn to sell at school lmao.

I hope so too would be nice to have some friends lol
---
Spacecake?

most reddit threads end with either a jmod smackdown or the jmod telling op to check their inbox and that their problem has already been solved through official means.

Pain to get to?  You just use burning ammy to lava maze. It's like a 10 second run.

Go as high as you can with range too, money permitting

I think what you are seeing as lips is supposed to be a big toothy grin, that‚Äôs how i see it anyway. Dudes excited to get the pk
---
You don't need a special set of armour to tell me you're a fuckin ironman, you can guarantee they'll tell you in 3 seconds of meeting
---
Nothing. People just collect them to have an absurdly high stack of weird shit.
---
A yes, the most logical argument of all time
---
thats only like 2,5 hours a day, so not that bad honestly. I think the average person watches more TV a day than that.

Autoclicking 50 milion exp while my whole clan chat reports me for 6 months straight and literally nothing happens

you only need brews if your solo/duoing

pog champ

Yeah I wanna smack people in the head who just put it on lash. Its so stupid... At least give yourself plus 3 att or def.

Ground item text like all good clients use. Different colours for your items vs other peoples for a start since you can't do colours for prices.

Yep - same with my account. Tried to appeal it the other day with no luck... Super frustrating.
---
Just make things not drop ya dummy lmao
---
its very little time and the sooner you start the more free xp you get

theres a tele right to the thing so its like no time investment for free xp
---
With a tbow/scythe youre still a long way away from all items
---
what about the bots
---
Haha I have, but 5 years of adderall as a kid gave me a mental tolerance for stimulants like that
---
What's top end? I bought a d hunter crossbow for like 115m the other day am I a fool?
---
Oh holy fuck that completely changes it. The color was so dark I just never interpreted it as teeth. You can see how that looks like straight up blackface though if you consider those as lips right?
---
the entire inventory glows red dude...
---
Well that sounds dreadful
---
No, im talking about their unannounced new rpg that theyve been recruiting for on their job listings page for the past few years. Idk much about it but ive seen posters for "runescape remastered" appear before.
---
Taken from either CS or CoD, cant confirm which came first....

This might be a dumb question, but can only members fight the mole? Or can you do it with F2P

You do them in a minute

Not your fault lol people are just idiots
---
I have 10 you better luck the balls too
---
And it's still a max of 4400 xp an hour.
---
You can set high alch to give a warning for untradeables btw so this could work the same.
---
He peaked March 23rd.  He now gets less than a quarter of the searches he did that week.  Even his spikes (when he released a LONG AWAITED video) barely managed to garner half that amount of attention.
---
I love his goal, but it's on it's decline.  Especially once you consider his "team" also needs to complete all the goals he does - which will be almost no one.
---
confirmed not, thanks.
---
&gt;ripped off
---
I haven't taken a close look at what it claims to do, are you sure it's not a fork that takes credit?
---
I heard the name and knew it was either a fake password stealer client, or an obvious fork like lizardlite
---
US citizen here, can agree wholeheartedly as well.
---
Not you, OP used "it's" where it should be "its".
---
No, not really. I had actually bought everything back not too long after I made that post and my bank value is still going down lol.
---
Why not make it so you could lock items? Like adding a safe option, could use the same method for preventing an accidental alchemy.
---
This is Sonic Adventure 2 Battle IIRC. This quote is from the improvised fandub, which is am absolute blast.
---
"doesn't like pvm" - 99 hp
---
At this point his goals are so lofty that he can‚Äôt release videos quickly
---
If he hadn‚Äôt picked lofty goals in the first place he would have never had this level of success 
---
What exactly do you suppose he should do? Start a new side series?
---
Voice sounds like A Friend

For one, the keys don't need a unique. I did a fuckin ice giant task and made over 600k from 100 of them.  One key, 3 emblems. Granted I was lucky on the emblems that's still 600k from a task that would normally produce less than 30k. We don't need more incentive to wildy slay. If you are high combat doing wildy slayer these tasks will take less then 20 mins mostly. No way this needs buffs
---
They're similar.  Edging is when you get close and ease up.  You do that repeatedly, that's edging (not so much a bad thing).  Blue balls is basically just not reaching orgasm (bad thing).
---
Okay, I‚Äôm that case. Do monkey madness, and then long term work towards getting barrows gloves with the FULL recipe for disaster quest. A fighter torso from barbarian assault is useful and so is void from lest control! Look into buying a whip when you can. Unlock piety with 70 prayer and King‚Äôs ransom, do desert treasure for ancient spellbook.... do varr medium diaries to make your varr feel straight to the ge and there‚Äôs SO much more
---
9 days
---
He looks translucent
---
But you can just do it while you do something else, so every hour you use 1 minute to gain 4k xp
---
Unfortunately only members! Wouldn't be very pleasant as a f2p either even if possible
---
Yeah, also he says that like there is a problem with wanting an alt to pick up loot you worked to get, but you can't pick up with your ironman.
---
I agree, it‚Äôs not even remotely in the same class as heroine, cocaine, amphetamines. Not at all similar in addiction potential or it‚Äôs effects on the body. I was only suggesting from my original comment that it‚Äôs unfair to write off someone‚Äôs experience and struggle with quitting. It‚Äôs not even fair to compare opiates or stimulants with weed. In states where weed has been legalized, I‚Äôve only seen positive outcomes. Same with Canada. I‚Äôm all for legalization. Just suggested that it‚Äôs not harmless and is in some ways addictive. But like you said, there‚Äôs not too much to be concerned about when there‚Äôs much worse out there.
---
Amazing thanks,!!
---
The log will only record things from the collection logs release 2018
---
At least they got it some people cant even do it. :/
---
Thanks! Would you recommend to a new member to have a goal of doing all the quests? Or I guess that could be hard because of skill prerequisites?
---
Because it can be used for fashionscape and it‚Äôs a cool untrimmed that most people don‚Äôt get, you can get trimmed ones after a second 99 but you can‚Äôt get an untrimmed again

Annoying trash youtuber

Yeah you‚Äôre not getting that back haha

No - As I said above with Rendi - a huge portion of his viewerbase doesn't care about his accomplishments - they enjoy how he makes his videos.  People will watch him do tasks as long as he's commentating it - no different than streaming.
---
Wow reddit cant take a joke thats the atrocity, fsct is the wife plays runescape with me
---
Just read they use magic and I find non-melee tasks unprofitable nearly 100% of the time, no way I'm carrying all kinds of food to heal magic damage and going back and forth for that task.
---
Nah, I added the three on the bottomest slide myself :P
---
you probably looked like a free kill and they are mad because you skipped

Sounds like they have access to your email. Does it have 2fa on it and are you sure it hasn't been leaked?

How many times you gonna delete your reply and post something else?
---
chu sayin' my brother? we aight
---
I hate realizing you need something that's on loan and they arent online
---
I think you need 65 for thebquest cape. I could be wrong though.

Screw it just turn the GE into a Buffalo Wild Wings.

Smh in the end pkers always win

osrs wiki will always have my support for quest guides &lt;3

It's not slow do you have any idea how exp/hour works? If you spend 5 minutes in total to a birdhouse run and for the other 55 minutes are doing another skill it's still 48kexp/hour hunter exp.
---
wtb balance pls jagex
---
For me it's construction. It's 51, RCing is 54. I should really level construction to around 70 soonish...

elevator pitch -- remove the tap to drop mode, and add a toggle setting for "hot drop" instead. If enabled, hot drop gets activated after dropping an item, and while it's active you only need to tap to drop something. It gets deactivated after short amount of time (couple seconds) since dropping last item (both via long tap in normal or single tap in hot drop -- while you're tapping the hot drop mode stays on). This way you have to explicitly activate the dangerous tapping; but at the same time it shouldn't make it much longer to drop than now (now it's 28 taps; with hot drop it'd be 1 long tap for the first item context menu, and then 28 taps)
---
Try out Barrows
---
How does other people playing video games affect you playing games though?
---
&gt; changed the inventory to glow red.
---
You're actually wrong. The inventory doesn't "glow." It's just tinted red. There's two problems with this: 1. If someone has been doing an activity with tap to drop on for a while the red background can start to look normal. 2. If someone is using something that redshifts their screen at night, the red background might not be noticeable (and I imagine color blind users might not notice the difference at all).
---
Maybe try adding an actual glowing animation or a more noticeable visual indicator like an icon or patterned background that is a bit more distracting. Another idea would be to decouple the drop interface from the inventory. Maybe it'd be a separate tab or even change the icon on the inventory to something else.
---
Last idea would be to make text appear on the screen that says "Dropped &lt;Item&gt;" and have it scroll up and disappear kind of like how XP drops appear and disappear.
---
Sorry what?
---
Is this a joke or are they really that rare? Been a while since I did that quest but you cam get loads of em while getting kril kc

Gaming addiction is easier to fix than a chemical addiction. You can die quitting the latter.

Do you use F keys?

I‚Äôm boutta slap you

That seems like more work than just clicking on the bolts in your inventory
---
I rather watch a teletubby
---
Youre work has helped all of so much!
---
Thank you!
---
I found out I cannot put 2FA on the email I currently have linked to account, my stupidity. I'm going to change the email to a more secure one if I ever get it back. I changed the password for my emails, and I'm not sure if the hacker went directly through my email, or just recovered my account with old information. This account has been hacked before, so i'm assuming they just recovered it.
---
I see you.
---
I can't believe they even have to ask, this is just so obvious.. 
---
What next? 
---
"How can we improve account security??"
---
You could use the Microsoft authenticator app.
---
I tested it the other day thinking no way it could actually happen, but if click to drop is on, and you click a tbow, it just boops onto the floor. No warning. Surely this could and should be fixed with a warning?
---
I bring a couple brews but i never use them at 99 hp. Maybe 1 dose every 10 games
---
Holy shit are you kidding me? They wont even remove the use of recovery questions even tho we cant update them at all? Jesus christ Jagex.

And, similar to high alch warning, for items above a certain gp value.

There‚Äôs a ridiculous amount of bots f2p with lots of arrows.

We're you planning on flipping it? Then yes, you a damn fool.

We're you planning on using it for a long time?

Then no, go get gains my friend and don't look back.

This makes things more affordable for me.
---
I have the new surface go, I play on runelite client. And enable the side bar gpu option in the client setting and don‚Äôt get much or any improvement. 
---
You will get 40-50 FPS in non crowded areas and solid 24-30 in crowded areas FORGET ABOUT PVP WORLDS. I do not recommend the surface go because I have issues when trying to pvp. Extremely laggy and almost useless. For questing/skilling it would be great. I‚Äôm already looking to get a laptop with i5 because of this very reason.
---
Seems like every week theres a major post on here regarding mtx or other complaints that have been going on for years. Nothing changes, and this post isnt going to change that pattern

30m isnt really enough to capitalize on the situation. you cant really afford any of the big ticket items quite yet

Just get 99 slayer

ez
---
Alt method really isn't high effort, it's 2 clicks per kill instead of 1. 
---
Chinning an alt to max range really doesn't take much time and is very easy to do while playing your main account if you really wanted to.
---
The timespan of a grind isn't really relevant when posting an achievement. Just because you've killed mole under 20 times a day on average doesn't mean your pet is any more impressive than someone who killed 15k at once - in fact I'd say it's less impressive if anything.
---
It's only natural I guess, technique is only getting better so people are scientifically learning how to do the most damage to another. Less people got punch drunk in the past but they fucking sucked compared to todays fighters.
---
I really wonder how many years into the future before governments stand in and just say nope you're an organisation that takes mentally and physically well adolescents and makes them retarded in the span of 10 years, no more.

The wiki states they lose essence storage when decaying. I thought that meant the longer you run without repairing it, it's degrading storage every few runs for lower and lower output. When the pouches are storing less, is that when they are degraded? It's not a gradual storage decay?

I have 99 hp. I carry one brew in my inventory just in case, but typically only sip on it \~1/10 games.  I use hp cape/obsidian brace/redemption  + poh pool tele

It's my last champ scroll left and I'm grinding them at a rate of 200/hr max with a cannon, and like to think I am the one single handedly crashing bead price. every time I stop by GE and see one to kill I think about how crazy it would be to get my last champs scroll right there but alas, nothing yet.
---
Right click the game chat and enable boss killcounts, you probably filtered it before
---
tbh id advice buying some stable items like zulrah scales. they are going to shoot up very soon ( twitch prime membership for bots ended/ is running out). there are still ways to increase your money during these days, just invest in supplies rather than items

How the fuck do you crop something this badly and think
---
‚ÄòThis is fine‚Äô

It‚Äôs pretty useless

As a reference for that last bit, I lost 17 trees total from level 1 - 99 farming using ultra-compost and iasor plants constantly. Never once paid for protection.

I feel like gnome child is more on it for /r/dankmemes than it is RS. I imagine if you asked most /r/dankmemes subscribers what gnome child is from they wouldn't be able to give you an answer.

Crackhead will

it doesn't do anything for rc if you bank quickly.
---
Keep us updated! This is honestly really like exactly what I needed for the fashionscape
---
Where does this meme even come from
---
And why does the dude look so smug
---
What the fuck is a bald taboo rafael?
---
It's f2p in RS3.
---
Well, the time saved from slow skills could make you more money than the lamps in construction would save
---
Yes. Xp/hr doesnt mean that from 1 to 2 pm you gained x amount of xp. Check play time at hans, then only log in to do birdhouses and log out as soon as you're done. By the time hans adds 1 hour to your play time, you've gained 100k+ xp in hunter.
---
The xp/hr doesnt change just because it takes you days to do this. Play time =/= real time.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the chestbrah meme, was hoping someone would fill me in but naw people just want to downvote haha.
---
If they shortened the run by an amount I wouldn‚Äôt hate it as much.
---
Yeah I really want to do that for all of the unlocks, although I would probably stop at 77 or 78 so I can boost for fairy ring and/or fancy jewlery box. I imagine that alone will take around 5m to 10m though, and I'm saving for amulet of torture atm.
---
I'm so glad it's on steam, it's great to go back and play it for nostalgia.
---
What's your gear setup? How many kills can you get per hour?
---
The taboo of being bald. And don't call me rafael ;D

It is until monday. Got some new falkens, decided to burn off these old Ironmans.

I know this was meant as a joke but, if you‚Äôre using runners the xp/hr is on par with other gathering skills. (Directed to those who kept crying)

its ancient alien technology from classic. its bad don't worry about it.

Just curious why you typed an edit if you hadn't posted it when you made the edit?
---
You mean life goals are getting in the way of 99 slayer
---
Lmaoooooo
---
let you lock items from being droppable?
---
Looks like a guy who doesn't know shit about the game he's playing
---
Yeah, you want some ranch or blue cheese wit dattt??
---
rc........ bad
---
Maybe release a new skill that acts like a money sink ? I even got a idea: archeology.
---
It‚Äôs really fun for me being on fossil islands, so why not introduce a skill based on exploring the past ? 
---
Imagine finding ,,fossils‚Äú from the 666 Falador massacre. 
---
We could mix that with the construction skill where we would idk, own a museum or build bigger homes / whole landscapes. 
---
It‚Äôs just an idea you know.
---
I jus rush so much that I enter the wrong number before it‚Äôs even started.
---
i dont know why people feel the need to do everything at once or fastest way take your time with the game play when you want and dont when you dont feel like it im60k from 99 slayer and havent logged in 6 days i enjoy the game much more
---
Yes but how many times do you think they can pull that off? Their power over this system is very, very limited.
---
And remember that the supply of items is basically unlimited.
---
That's interesting, I've always thought BWW's sauces tasted awful. Dry rub is where it's at for me, every time.

It is. The original says addicted to heroin

but theyre both 1 because agility and rc bad lol upvotes to the left

Cha-Ching.
---
filled in the things i could awnser thanks wiki guys.
---
Sounds like a scam dude, not gonna click ur links, reported
---
How is it hard to learn? Put on welfair gear and tele to the lava maze and start killing noobs. Pking has not massively changed in years, its simple to understand. Do damage, try not to die. The hardest and only difficult part is clicking (reacting) fast and accurately. You can literally risk 300k and be competitive.
---
Risk fighting (veng style fights) and dhing is a little more complicated, but standard tribrid is pretty simple to wrap your head around. And then its all down to the clicks.
---
Be the change you want to see

ohhhhhh im an idiot thanks

Pointless since you can activate a skull in Edge.

But if you could deactivate a skull then that‚Äôs a different story with the recent skull update. Maybe make it require the cape and a ~20m fee for a gp sink.

Optimal Quest order from slayermusic

It's an optional cosmetic. You seem legitimately angry about it, and that worries me..

I wouldn‚Äôt know what the other sauces are like cause I only ever eat parm garlic when I go to BWW. If I‚Äôm not in the mood for parm, I go to wingstop and get classic lemon pepper and Cajun.

You got experience for 99 Runecrafting but you still leveled 99 Cooking?

What is this supposed to be?

i just thought of something. if condoms are only 99% effective thats still good odds in rs terms.

Cool?...
---
Obviously?
---
I‚Äôd imagine it feels pretty amazing.

Wat.

---
He is talking about the wilderness: run and escape
---
Revs helped pking massively. Id like to see another rev type area added to the game. How can you possibly argue it "doesn't help" when I can easily tele in and find a defencless pvmer to descimate at any time I want? Where else in the wilderness can that be done?
---
I got it at 4th kill
---
yea let me just take pictures of random mens ass cheeks at walmart. you thought this was it didnt you?

Rinse the bank and ditch it. Account will be recovered eventually

thanks peter

I have 99 and didn't know this :) :) :)
---
Having con high enough to make your house a hub with regen/teleport is game changer. Now, I don't go anywhere without a stack of house tablet.
---
No matter how you train Runecrafting, tears are involved.
---
And also the Part with the 666 massacre bones was a joke/ should still come in the game as a joke.
---
But the serious part should be finding old history ( godwars etc )
---
Maybe real history too, like the hanging gardens of Babylon ( ikr I can‚Äôt stop talking about it, pls give me the gardens)
---
If you want to summon it yourself carry one of the gems from DT with you,  also dont forget to carry your cashstack.

Smoking anything can be addicting, I was saying THC isn't an addictive chemical. But you should know all about being addicted, with all the pole you smoke ^_^.

There are other easier ways to do this

---
Bet you won't spend it all on mineral packs
---
Hey man, I'm kinda being a dick. A seed sink sounds cool but you got to think about the fact that most seeds are absolutely useless, and that is why they are worthless not only because there's too many.
---
Also, gold can leave the game and that combats inflation but as more and more items enter the game the value will lower more and more, regardless of the value of the GP. The way the game is now all items are bound to reach high alch value or lower eventually unless those items leave the game somehow.
---
Again sorry for being a bit of a douche.
---
seconded as a newbie as well. I was doing wildy slayer literally afk. Look at the other side of my screen, see 2 white dots standing still. Thought they would pass me up. They waited 45s then finally killed me for my black dhide and 150 cannonballs. Absolute brainlets needed to figure out how to pk or something in multi. Cost more in runes teleblocking and spashing then anything. 
---
But ofc it's 3v1 while Im lvl 40 combat LMAO. Like okay, I didnt risk anything and I get that I could potentially be risking something, but sheesh, at least get good at pking.
---
I also accidentally dropped pieces of my graceful for the same reason. Why is there no warning text?!
---
It's faster than slayer at least
---
impressive
---
I think he is German. That's how you would say it, if you were German. "He made the account when he was 7" is what he meant. In German "with 7 years old" is a common way of saying it

You can attack others in the wild. Shocker they attacked you man

No

Lmao this actually happens
---
F
---
What lol
---
Welcome!
---
Yeah no. Player count is down 30k since the start of the year.
---
Less people are playing
---
that just means you get to kill zulrah for 50 more hours to make up the difference now.
---
Why get so mad I usually just cc
---
Got on my 18th. Get gud kid.
---
Well if course not, and the 70m is a theoretical value, because you cannot continually check spirit tree health for an hour in one go. 
---
These are all theoretical values, but they still are still taken into consideration because if you add up the time spent just doing this activity until it reaches an hour (which will of course take a few days to a week or longer, depending on your playtime), you will get a high XP per hour. But over the course of this week, you did actually only spend an hour of your time on it, and so it's a value you can use.
---
After starting to use it, i‚Äôve already noticed quite a huge difference with how long my run lasts! Kinda crazy!
---
What's the best setup for melee vork? Avernic and pray mage?
---
If only they were still at 33
---
I did, it‚Äôs just been a very long time. Think it was a fluke lol. I think it‚Äôs my inventory that gets messed up. I always take too many hits and I‚Äôm out of the minimal food I take by wave 55ish and have a shitton of prayer left
---
Oh my b I‚Äôll fix it
---
So don't complain then lmfao
---
That's actually kind of interesting could it work to trade gold sink for item sink?
---
Bit of a sausage-fest.
---
No one's ever seen the two in the same room
---
I could be wrong but as long as you have +1 mage attack you will deal the same damage to them because they have 0 magic defense. So if you used and ancients staff it would have the same result.
---
"Creative"
---
&gt;70m is a theoretical value
---
So is anything above 4k Hunter xp.
---
&gt;You cannot continually check spirit tree health for an hour in one go
---
You cannot continually check bird houses for an hour in one go. 
---
Birdhouses are 4k an hour, but very fast. Notice how people don't talk about how much gp per hour it is to get daily battlestaves from zaff? It's not "5k gp an hour" it's "70k a day".
---
Smh my head he is a NMZ prod

Appeals are more or less an automated process.

Where did he suggest to make rev caves single?
---
Kills without spec are trash, nty.
---
It's banter if the last 15 lines before we see are the other dude saying more of the same.
---
It's not at all banter if this is the first thing said in a pking situation. 
---
Geez bro when are you gonna grow up and realize context matters and OP has omitted the most crucial part, THE BEGINNING.
---
Wtf am I looking at?
---
Rough, addy cane is the most essential medium clue item for an iron man
---
&gt;I use justiciar
---
Just camp pray mage lol
---
The 15% damage boost applies to bursting
---
He said a naughty word, offence and drama ensued.
---
No wonder the sub is trash now
---
So basically you regret selling the pieces back to get some quick gp with amylase packs.. well played
---
The bank is right outside though.
---
Although stretched fixed mode on Runelite helps you have it be full screen
---
Ditching the justiciar and using ahrims instead so you learn from your mistakes. Spend the money on an acb and supplies
---
