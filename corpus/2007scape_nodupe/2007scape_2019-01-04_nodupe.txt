Thats now how you use a bong NERD

Rewards should also vary based on the monster's combat level as well. Maybe even some RDT-only rewards.
---
Did he also give you a budget of 200k?

fair enough
---
Yes it's bad manners. Either ask them and accept the inevitable 'no' or keep hopping.
---
Thank you Maxy!
---
Alching seriously brings in a fuckload on money into the game.
---
Everyday I buy my battlestaves from Zaff, turn them into air battlestaves, and then alch them while doing agility. This is about 130k new gold added to the game per day.
---
When I do slayer I alch most of the drops, that could easily turn into 1m new gp.
---
Sometimes I google which items alch for profit and that sometimes ends up in 10m+ new go added in a day.
---
Hundreds of thousands of people play this game and are likely doing similar things
---
I’m erect 
---
Wow. I don't feel so bad on my account hiking of doing the kill
---
lmao it hurts tho
---
Rune items are ~30k sometimes, most resources and drops that aren't useful armor and weapons will eventually make it's way to someone's alch pile. Every one and log has a good chance of being processed by production skills and alched.
---
One of you is going to end up getting a majority of the drops so almost everyone will consider this crashing and it’s very annoying.
---
Kinda both. I enjoyed slaying stuff (particularly in wildy), but I also spent fair amount of time in nmz.
---
Go to runescape official site, go to your account and check your message centre. The email is probably a scam and whatever you do don't click that link. 
---
The good ol days. 
---
Leave it... Gives a reason for lower stuff.
---
My biggest regret in this game was way back when i used the rfd 20k lamp on slayer. Really missing that now that im 3 levels shy of 77.
---
Did you even read this post dude?
---
Just some fashionscape
---
Sub human iq to think that is one leg. 
---
Farming is good for this. You can grow ranarrs and make 600k-1m per day if you keep on top of it.
---
I work at home, i play while working and I started with mobile. At first I did NMZ and got 99 str and 75 in attack magic defence and ranged. Since then I afk slayer, up to 81 now with 90 attack, 83 defence, ranged and 80 magic mostly all from slayer
---
Heh
---
I completed all the fossil exhibits for this same reason.

If your not in a clan join “average joes” and if you meet the requirements we will teach you.

Where do I go to submit a review? It says my ban is unappealable :(

There are a lot of people on this world. You might want to switch to a quieter one.

You can do so by using the world switcher in the logout menu.

ikr. so paranoid of the impending random event

how do you +5 the nats? can you make that run before the first boostdegrade?

Good job man. I wish the actual login screen to be extended to include that whole image

Btw here, I have 4 d bodies and 0 d chaps from clues.

Well now my expectations are sky high for chrissimpsonsartist x osrs crossovers

I don’t even know what that ring is

I wonder what kind of vulgar objects are hidden in this

Thanks. Since the time of this post less than two minutes ago, all forms of scamming have ceased to work on anyone, all scammers have been banned (even future scammers), and all bots have neen banned

you realize people CHOOSE to watch the person right?

Wiki says the hydra boss drops the drops of regular hydras plus gloves and lance add-on.

if you could raise a pet dog and get 201 death runes it would immediately become the new meta for ironman

Those folks can keep their fans. They attract a certain type of person.
---
I never AFK train melee, slayer all the way. The only thing I AFK trained was ranged for a few levels at crabs when I was lower level. 
---
This but I'm adding barrows gloves.
---
i hate crashers  best thing i do is say nothing and just hop or go instance mode
---
Definitely. 123xp per wheel per load? No brained
---
Die at altar with ess on ground or trade someone after boost is obtained.

I hate you

You can remap so long as each input is only one input.

Shut up serene

If I was following him, wouldn't have I replied to him, and not the wrong person?
---
As a matter of fact I did go back to toontown! Jagex has not earned my $.70 today, and will not during any other day that they choose to impede the games playability like they have today. They may as well have taken all the servers down at once; I’m done with runescape for the day.  As for the servers, I have absolutely 0 hope that this will fix any of the problems that currently exist. It’ll likely be only a bandaid when a replacement is needed. Also, you’re a cunt!
---
Fuck sake I knew I was missing a slot lol. Yeah thos and Barrows gloves. 
---
What lore? You mean a completely different game? Too funny. 
---
You can’t misclick if you just use the keyboard. 
---
Impersonator? We're not even from the same country
---
&gt; One of you is going to end up getting a majority of the drops
---
Call me dumb, but i don't actually see why this is the case? Would you mind going full Eli5 for me?
---
100% agree
---
The very word justiciar comes from justice, of which zamorak is not big on. Calling anything related to zamorak "justiciar" is foolish
---
Exactly. And if you’re cool with not getting rich quick it’s usually really easy 
---
Best one yet imo
---
I wouldn't be so sure. You still see threads about people falling for double XP/quitting streams every now and again. 
---
Then we should rename it to 'Little Bonus Table'
---
lmao this dude so broke he went from selling bootleg Chinese gaming consoles to plugging Chinese gold farmers. 
---
Still heavy af?
---
no shit 
---
Awful xp rates, do absorption pots or camp melee pray, it'll be 5 mins afk and way better xp.
---
100% agree 
---
Do you train herblore?

Avantoe = af en toe = dutch for "now and then"...

A lot of the top-tier Ironmen do, like MMORPGRS, Alkan (big daddy), etc. they get it all through alchs

Have you tried to login for double exp recently?
---
Projecting much?

TIL that 1x23=32

After the next update, I imagine they'll be.

Speaking of Jebrim, did anyone see him tweet There's no such thing as raping your wife. It's logically incorrect...
---
He's got hundreds of takes just as bad. Fuck that guy, we need a new agility god.
---
Resources and gp are separate things, sure there’s infinite resources but there also needs to be a good way to go from those to gp (alchs)
---
Maybe that’s the secret to getting good drops. I’m almost 5k kills dry of a pet or skeletal visage
---
We're not talking about the real life meaning or application of the word here. In RS lore, Justiciar is a title that refers those granted power by Saradomin and chosen to make decisions on his behalf. The Justiciar in the actual *in game lore book* is literally referred to as still being a Justiciar after defecting to Zamorak.

Nmz just needs 5 quests with bosses that are included you should look at the wiki for more info. Well I started combat stats about a weeks after mobile started and I got 99 str a few weeks ago, since then I finished recipe for disaster and been grinding slayer since then

I like settled, fatnooblet and EVscape when he uploads.

Sorry for poor formatting. You explained selling beautifully. So when buying or selling it finds the closest offer that is lower?

Yeah, some NPCS are not as appealing as others.

But i kinda like it anyway, the text on her face at least.

I could be wrong about this but I think all of the us-west servers are offline. So if you're near the west coast you'll likely experience significantly higher ping than you're used to.

Shhhhhh my child.

I only do 2 kill trips and bank between them so I don't have to delete all my food. Bgs will significantly shorten your kill times though. My fastest kill is 1:27 without woox walking.
---
That's incredibly vague.  Will you tell me what end game content is? Crafting wrath runes? Cutting redwood logs?
---
You can reach endgame content without max stats, you don't have access to every little thing in the game but you will have access to most of it.  Most people who achieve 99 rc don't ever do it again anyways, and with  good reason.
---
Na it's fun
---
Engine work

appreciate it

wouldnt fury be the better thing to sell. Can sell the god hide as well if you need more.
---
Remember that mouse pad drama tho

Good to know.

All the content we already had on Wikia was ported over to the new site when we moved. So yea, we have gemw.

To respond to ur comment finally I am nearing 1750 total with 266 quest points. I cant post a pic of my stats but I'm 81 range and mage, 92 hp, 75 att, 85 str, 99 def, 70 prayer
---
Watch YouTube tutorials, stats and gear are fine IMO 
---
slayer to get your money up, and then probly dks-gwd-corp
---
Or if you prefer vork/zulra to get gear
---
It depends on how well you can boss
---
tfw these people get to vote on polls
---
That's incredibly shitty logic saying I need to runecraft for 100+ hours to have an opinion on the matter, when the end result isn't a runecrafting benefit or even relevant to runecrafting in any way shape or form.

If I’m cannon training at cage ogres does it matter what gear I wear? Should I be worried about range bonuses

You will be banned for accepting gold from him if he gets caught for being a RWTer.

Why not just altar in house then just house tele?
---
Damn I should sell my ahrims
---
lemme rephrase, for olm in solos and in cm its better than the scythe on avg.
---
the scythe is the big megarare from tob. it's an extremely overpowered item and its going to be beaten out by probably a 20-25 hour item.
---
3 week old account with b gloves? That's pretty impressive. How much do you play?
---
This guy crashed me at dust devils once, yikes
---
How is this pointless? I thought it was kinda funny and upvoted before I even saw it was serene.

Can anyone else see the hidden face on the bottom of the volcano in the blue lava? Or is it just me?
---
dhcb isnt on par with tbow. tbow beats dhcb pretty handily at olm, bbds. its not at all near tbow anywhere where tbows decent.
---
lance is better than scythe for cm and on avg better than scythe in solos for olm.

Oh cool! Thank you very much

I've lost at Jad about 4 times watching different guides. I'm pretty bad may need the bp :'( 
---

---
He's right, it's trash...
---
scythe is still much better in many other places. It's not a niche weapon like the lance is. still not on par with a scythe. the price will even reflect that.
---
Euthanize that fool 
---
one of the most crowded worlds due to people hosting houses in rimmington

you use houses for ornate pool (restores all health, run energy, prayer, spec), teleports (portal nexus and ornate jewelry box), spellbook swaps at occult altar, etc

I hope he doesn't do the fortnite dances in your face mate RIP :(

its okay bro, its not your world either. i know its not convenient to hop but if its gonna turn you from a sour puss to a happy chappy its always worth the 30secs imo

New login screen submission when?
---
Agility is even slower!

Unlock Tzhaar task and wait til you get a jad task + blowpipe.

LOL!

Not sure if this is a serious picture or a troll..
---
When I was f2p I camped the imps South of falador for like three hours for their beads and blue wizard gear. Got atk/str/def to 30 and sold everything for like 150k, used some of that to buy better gear and then camped Hill Giants for runes and limpwurt (you can sell their bones too, but I trained prayer with them instead). By the time a/s/d was 50 I had made like 500k additionally after like six hours total of camping. 
---
Always pick up coins, and always pick up drops people don't do long as you can sell it. About 1/4 of my runes and limpwurt was from neglected drops. 
---
Nobody NEEDS it.

Eh, I don't get stressed, because like you said, it's only a game. I enjoy fighting back because I know they get annoyed when they don't get me to leave, as that's what they want. And when I get them to leave, I'm really fucking happy :).
---

I just got proselyte yesterday and have been praying some slayer tasks, but man its expensive. I still go through a ton of prayer potions. Would it be better just to bring food?
---
Been working on this quest the last few days. Pretty cool
---
Third of all, alch urself. Fourth of all, nice dude(tte)!
---
Givem a sock he'll be happy
---
Well you're using a 3rd party program to let someone mirror the game and play it for you.
---
yeah im the same, but sometimes i just wanna get on with the boss/task
---
Can we slightly buff granite while we're at it so the full set is at least between Rune and Dragon/Obsidian. 
---
Let's go with the 14th, already too much competition on release day as it is
---
You don't NEED it but it makes it easier for me. Especially on a laptop with no mouse...

yes officer, this man right here.

This is just a copy of a recent front page post: https://reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/a98lof/just_got_my_first_fire_cape_ever/

You don't get banned for buying gold.

Nah I'm waaay too stubborn to let them win :P..
---
It has to be farming. It's the first member skill I go for every single time. Shortly followed by herbs, but they go hand in hand really. 
---
I’m at the same level you are right now, but lower combats, no fire cape, and higher skills, and reading your post just motivated me to get back on the grind tomorrow, so thanks
---
Please do this

I've got a tip for the bolt.

---
20 years? dragon slayer came out in 2001
---
Man those have been blocked forever for me. Bad xp, no drops, boring ass tasks. Well besides unblocking hellhounds when I was able to do cerberus
---
I feel like a lot of the time though, these people with the evidence are often leaving a lot of the story out, too.  Like how they botted or rwt.
---
I’ve been trying to train construction on my pure and it’s so slow and frustrating
---
E N G I N E W O R K

Then you get pked by some guy who used a teleport blocker and rage quit.

( brazillian question about membership payment)COmo q eu faço pra pagar membership por boleto? Eu li num forum q dava por paypal, mas ele me obriga a pagar por Cartao de credito
---
Yes. Or Guthans. Some tasks prayer is still much more convenient though so it can be worth it. 
---
I hope that, when you submitted it, you didn't have the flames on the braziers; they're added automatically and having static and dynamic flames in the same spot might spoil the effect somewhat.
---
I've never seen you post here before but ty for everything

100*(1-(1/512)*((511/512)^(6445))) = 99.99999934%

worse
---
the new meta is full justiciar and praying magic. The defence bonus + soak ability is OP. Plus the mage minion won't hit and when kril does his special attack, it won't drain the shit out of your prayer. 
---
This is a work of art. Well done op.

It's part of runelite and runelite always listens to Jagex when it comes to legal and non legal stuff

You should definitely look into grinding slayer. since you’re constantly assigned different monsters to kill it doesn’t feel as grindy and is actually fun to train. you’ll make a ton of money at later levels when you unlock new slayer monsters and is the most efficient way to train combat stats anyway.
---

Guthans is a slayers best friend (for tasks where you don’t need the slayer helm on). It’s over 5m right now though. 
---
How is hunter a lowest skill? Birdhouses are passive XP and money. People must not care about free passive XP as much anymore I guess
---
Why would u be that dumb though
---
The investment is going well
---
people like their crappy afk poh methods thats all rly

Have you seen lumbridge? There are tons of goblins lol.
---
Look up YouTube guides, get a blowpipe, use that special to your advantage and take 2 hours if you need to. I find it incredibly hard to believe you did dragon slayer 2 and are having a tough time killing jad.

Get out of void ASAP. It’s not good, and stop cheaping out on food, you’re already going to make a ton of money use manta rays. Plus that will give you the most out of those zulrah tele scrolls 
---
Elaborate?

Lol
---
Ok well dont change it. RS3 reworked the drop table and look how that piece of crap game turned out. Keep the drops the same or we get ezscape

now you've done it. one of the mods will read this and make this quest.

dat thot stole romeo....................nice

Wouldn’t mind this on the desktop version as well tbh.

Keep rwt. Please we all want to see you banned!

The only way would be with a poisoned weapon, unless the boss monster has an accelerated health regen mechanic/is immune to poison.
---
(To get a poisoned weapon semi-easily, get 32 thieving and pickpocket Rogues in Wilderness for Iron Dagger(p))
---
Yeah that sounds a lot better than trying while f2p and cramming lobsters down my throat and hiding behind a dumb orange box that did NOTHING to save me from the fire. But I'm glad you had a good time of it. 😊
---
There is an image of basically all the gear/spells/etc to go after/unlock in a sort of checklist style and I can't find it anymore. Anyone remember what I'm describing/have it saved?
---
Ive learned something new today, thanks bud
---
Yeah you got it backwards, especially since Myles Morales is the best spooder.
---
Killing Catacomb nechs over Tower nechs for shards means you value shards VERY highly.
---
And if you value shards that high why wouldn't you mage them and get them ~3x quicker?
---
So i'd suggest you take Shawns advice. 
---
No feet? You've changed man 😢

Why are d hatchets so cheap now? When i started playing osrs a few months ago i saved up over a mil for one only to see it was like 40k. In 2007 i bought mine for like 1.5M

I think it increases average profit for easy clues, but not any others. Could be wrong though

Seriously aside from the helm upgrade for shamans who even gives a fuck for this rewards

The obby cape is a nice touch

I got 3.5k gp from my first barrows chest. Felt pretty good after using a teletab and a prayer pot

This is the correct answer

Yea but twitch sucks at enforcing or even understanding their own rules lol 
---
Have you heard of our Lord runescape 3 ?
---
How much gp do you think he’s going to make from this?
---
I haven’t done the event, how much are the rewards worth atm?
---
is it worth going after full grace ? ive heard different opinions from very expd players. Some say its imp for skillers, not worthwhile otherwise, others say you should get it asap. I've already started working on it, but its getting a bit grindy, n idk if i wanna continue &gt;.&lt;
---
Is there a way of finding out if my RSN is too offensive other than waiting until it gets changed?
---
Is this vaping?
---
It's not a career it's a game. Also learn to screenshot you mong
---
:D
---
Find a trusted firecape seller on scythe, it’s like 10m osrs or 10$ at your level, you can just buy all the cheapest gear like black d hide and Karils crossbow 
---
I wish they'd rework the catacombs, it's ridiculous from a worldbuilding perspective and imbalanced from a gameplay perspective. Why are all those creatures gathered in the same place? And didn't they break up Nieve's cave because it was a one-stop shop for slayer? The catacombs are basically the same thing but even better with shards, totems, and prayer restoration
---
It still pops up first cause of this reason. If people made a point to stop using the old one, the new one would become first result.

Except that toadflax is the most profitable herb to plant in normal patches using ultracompost

Not really. And what name is offensive is completely arbitrary. There are hundreds of account names that are sex jokes that go completely ignored, while names that may mean something serious but vaguely sound like a kind of bad word are banned.

protip make the order of the clicks the rainbow ROYGBIV to be able to easily tell which one is next at a glance
---
Well unless you are ignoring agility forever, you will need to get the outfit eventually. It's just advisable to do it asap because it does make a difference when doing things like questing, farm runs, runecrafting, etc.
---
Ezscape smh
---
i went from 22-26 rc doing it, it only takes 10 minutes (quest and mini game. game will only take &lt;5min once a week). also use runelite plugin to show you how long the tears have left until they turn into green ones or disappear. it'll explain itself once you do the quest.

Hi masters1777!

Just safe spot them. You won’t be in combat so can easily log out before they’re within range of you. It’s very hard to get pk’d there unless you’re afking.
---
Are you telling me it doesn't count as combat if the dragon doesn't hit me.
---
H
---
I think it only works on desktop right now. 
---
Don’t think it’s even that much XP 
---
Even then, it will probably only take you like an hour to build the computer from scratch if you know what you’re doing 
---
Make life optionable
---
Got mine at 121 kc.
---
Is he though? Plenty of people actually believe that, and the fact that he seems to be a newish player leads me to believe otherwise.
---
Oh my fucking god what the FUCK
---
Wait, this new wiki is the wikia one with it's own domain? If so, did they make it actually work on mobile?
---
I don’t believe you can get the wc pet from the roots, but I’m not 100% on that. People holding the torch likely just don’t have the attack level to hold the axe they are using, but still want to have something in their hands - that’s my best guess, since you are right that you only gain warmth benefit from up to 4 items. As for food items, I used brews all the way to 99 and found them very efficient - I can’t think of anything off the top of my head that is better for healing per slot, so I think brews are your best bet :)
---
mega jelly
---
This is a legitimate question. And it's not fair. Looking from another perspective it can open the door to more activity in these worlds as well.
---
Is that real?
---
I mean this sub has corrupted my thought process of these kind of things so much that all I see are those white/pink looking things are basically women legs up in the air.
---
This should be for every multiple choice option screens 
---
I now see that it does change the color of the checkbox to white on hover but this still may be a little more clear on which one you're hovering over.
---
We left the old Wikia wiki three months ago under a new site, https://oldschool.runescape.wiki
---
It has features such as dark mode, reader mode and the quest checklist feature that would be impossible to do on the old Wikia wiki.
---
And most importantly, no ads, so mobile is (as far as I can tell) much better than the old Wikia wiki's.
---
Just look at the fucking homepage. 
---
https://oldschool.runescape.com/
---
Yes, not sure about the exact reason but it probably has to do with the worlds that are down for maintenance, might be as simple as the remaining US worlds having more players than normal.
---
Hate to burst your bubble but only one hammer is a hitting hammer. The other is just for show/balance. So dual wield only gives you one extra hitting hammer, hence a double.
---
If you dont get hit, you can log
---
Wow thanks lmao idk how I made it to level 55 without realizing that
---
I gotta do the math, but I feel like the price of the seed vs herb makes toadflax better
---
Até onde eu sei, a única forma de pagamento que não é por paypal/cartão diretamente com a Jagex é via Boa Compra. Se não me engano os pacotes do Boa Compra podem ser pagos via boleto.
---
This is on the new wiki. I'm not sure about the mobile support.
---
the chance of getting no drops is ((1023/1024)^(2))^(3223)? difference is insignificant with the s.f.'s.
---
Even veterans learn something new every now and then
---
Wow it's almost as if taking the good things from RS3 is fine and leaving the MTX and EOC shit behind is why OSRS is more popular. 
---
No chance for wc pet from bruma roots - https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Beaver
---
No extra benefit from 5th warm item, just fashion, maybe they don't have the attack yet anyways.
---
Brews are your best bet for not banking too often, though you can get several rounds on 5 sharks if you're careful to not get shrapnel or a 3x3 snowfall on you. Regen bracelet and either rapid heal or hp cape helps too.
---
no voting competition is needed this is fucking perfect
---
They only give pmods to content creators, who, for thr most part, don't do anything with it. 
---
w h o a
---
literally pay 6 dollars for a bond, then work to earn them continuously using members methods
---
???
---
inb4 this gets polled for desktop version and it passes even though it shouldn't
---
just buy it off the GE 
---
Dungeoneering, MTX, EOC are all what ruined the game. Dungeoneering was ignorable at least. 
---
rc is easier and people bitch about it all the time
---
ask people at the ge lol
---
It's lvl*10. At level 1 you'd get 10 xp per genie.
---
its down for maintenance it will be back up soon
---
imo current justiciar looks great (especially with weapons etc on) but yeah that old design was really fucking cool and better tbh
---
The way the best players innovate the game is usually very different from what jagex have in their mind when they create new content. Is justicar even used anywhere now? I guess it could be useful for zammy and bandos, but not much else until they release something similar to the gwd design again where you have to atleast tank something (of course unless you can tick eat at woox lvl) you get my point
---
Link by any chance?
---
Lmao it gives a ghost speak amulet I’m DED 
---
Nibba if you don’t get some better food
---
There is a clan chat to find people for this. Cant remember the name but a simple google search will help you out.
---
I still use old wiki because its calculators are auto-updated and cover many topics. Could be something to work on
---
Making bowstrings for fletching training
---
Void mage is good unless you can afford a tormented bracelet and imbued heard. Void range sucks. Blessed dhide is better. 
---
Great idea! Another way around misclicking is to long press on the jewelry while it’s equipped, and not let go until your finger is on the correct location. It’ll be highlighted yellow. 
---
b
---
Yes
---
Can you elaborate what you mean by this? They should be the same.
---
Boosted 2 lvls aswell. So worth it
---
Its kinda concerning how many people assume shit talking must mean that person is worked up/salty/angry etc. 
---
Like do people really struggle staying calm while typing out random trash talk? I'm usually just fucking bored any time I care to make some kind of a comeback.
---
Classic joel
---
Except lunar staff for whatever reason
---
He said it was his prayer dropping, not cause of antifire.
---
Your flair is straight up dehydrated arthritis patient level cancer
---
Would require a completr rework of the engine. The amount of work it would take would completely detract from content updates.
---
You mean the client that was around and then disappeared? The answer to that, is Jagex asked to see their code for their client. They never presented it then they just dipped. Most assume the client was fishy due to using assets from the actual HD update more than likely stolen.
---
Now if you're referring to us getting an actual HD update, the answer is too much engine work. Would have to remake all the game models. Most to all updates would be put on hold. Would have to get outside help with development.
---
Can we also flip the chat box jamflex pls
---
He has risen!
---
Hotboxing his diving helmet
---
Looks like I need a Total Level 150 for that. Guess I'll have to level up a bit :)
---
Gotta be something to do with the level of stupidity on this sub reddit that rises everyday. Constant reposts of pathetic memes and constant requests for everything to be lewd. 
---
Let's go for 5 boys 
---
Use salamaders low risk, safe spot and tbh not that worth imo tried it a few times even if u don’t get pked they rag and annoy u
---
runelite tells you how much its worth
---
RuneLite has a plug-in that gives you an ‘estimation’ of total bank worth. It even gives you the tab worth as well. Check it out
---
Just wanna say mlm is cancer
---
The reason the servers are more stable now is because of the death mechanics. If we didn't have safe-ish deaths then servers would be getting DDOSed all the time, just like they used to.
---
i just delivered it :p
---
A lot of pmods hang out on specific worlds. That's generally the issue. They don't go around world to world silencing every bot. They'll only silence people on their home world.
---
346 has quite a few pmods that hang around the GE. Iirc there's also a world in the 370s or so that has a pretty large home world community with high levels/pmods.
---
no you are still wrong. somebody who spends all day playing runescape because they’re depressed, can’t find a job, directionless etc isn’t doing “what they want to do right now” 
---
Don't sell it in that world brudda
---
yeah I'll be doing Nechryael tasks at the slayer tower moving forward lol :)
---
cant find it
---
How do slayer *rings* not count as rings? That makes no sense.
---
idklol
---
then go play rs3?
---
Rank 1 alive and will be actual rank 1 easily sometime soon
---
They said it was for lore reasons but like.. Jagex makes the lore lmao. Just make a different reason for dark armor.
---
Also, love the username flair. I have a quest cape on my main lol
---
I always upvote MM
---
I like to think my portrait represents hardships in the Industrial Age. 
---
Goodbye
---
I honestly need this.
---
So rank 2
---
gf account
---
Just don't die. I've seen somewhere where since it technically is still following you if you die you lose it. Not sure about if you have pet insurance when it pertains to this situation though.
---
Yeah, I love quests, they're really what made me keep playing for a long time and I had the quest cape at one point, but then stopped playing for a while and then dragon slayer 2 came out and i'm too scared to finish it lol
---
and f2p dosent have much content that requires players to be spread out on different worlds to do that content, whereas members has a shitton.
---
Ah, I haven't checked pc prices in like ~2 years tbh, but when I built my pc it was definitely cheaper to build it at home
---
Its used to tank gwd as an alt or just to tank for friends at zammy and bandos I think.  I think some pieces could be used in inferno as well but I haven't tried them out there.  So pretty much yep lol, useless
---
You should talk to my [farming guy](https://m.imgur.com/a/FyeQ2Tz). He’ll hook it up
---
Physical maintenance maybe? 
---
Don’t be, the final boss technically safe because if you die, all your items are stored with Torvinn at the Relleka docks. I say “technically” because you have to pay 100k to get your stuff back. It was an infuriating fight for me though, I tried it at 79 range and I died 19 fucking times before I finally won
---
Your stats seem ok, usually people want 115+ combat so the raid doesn’t get downscaled but it looks like you’re about 110-111 so you might be able to get away with it. Construction doesn’t matter much for raids, but the higher your farming level the better if you plan on going for efficiency eventually. I would also suggest getting a dwh as it’s incredibly useful and super worth it. Things like ACB and Armadyl aren’t required until you have extra money to blow. 
---
Order of progression for gear should be something like dragon crossbow&gt;tort/anguish/tormented&gt;Abby dagger/elder&gt;bandos/prims&gt;pegs&gt;ancestral hat&gt;acb&gt;ancestral top and bottom&gt;Armadyl 
---
Roughly. 
---
Big yes, nothing more irritating than fat fingering the wrong teleport lmao
---
nicee now start crossing em off!
---
Any update? 
---
How? 
---
.....until it dies.....
---
how is it ?
---
I agree with everything you said, plus sometimes I just miss selling a boatload of coal or swordies outside the varrock bank, seeing people sell abyssal whips, rune scimitars, kites and that great  achievement when you finally complete Dragonslayer and get to shop around for your first rune plate body; if you hadn't bought it first and kept it in your bank :p
---
My account has 70 attack and def, 65 str. Max hit doesnt increase every level so theres no immediate need to keep training after certain levels
---
The extra rolls per hour add up if you're hunting something specific, wouldn't recommend it unless you want phoenix or are an iron with 99 fm and really want something from there.
---
We would vote against it like we did for resizing spells. Because we hate ourselves. 
---
Oh my Saradomin 
---
That's what I heard but that was a while back and I was just curious and wondering if theres been any developments regarding the client. We've had no word for many months from either the dev's of the client or jagex for that matter.
---
I’ve had that issue with low detail mode on. Some areas don’t work with it. 
---
I'm a pmod on my pure. I basically sit exclusively at the woodcutting guild and afking, so sorry boys.
---
Yup that's enough internet for today...
---
What is the method of determining 99.82% chance? Ive been wondering this for a long time for my own tracking methods
---
What automod said. We moved to our new platform on October 2nd to get away from the abhorrent host that was Wikia, who hindered us by placing unwanted ads and features and using outdated core software.
---
All content released to OSRS post October is exclusive to the new site, as the entire editing community has migrated with us. In addition, several useful features have been added, such as dark mode, quest requirement checklists, etc that would not have been possible to create on the old website. With the community having moved, the old site is vulnerable to vandalism and often has incorrect info and messy pages, as the Fandom staff who have taken over don't actually care about the site.
---
ME2 no thanks just yet
---
I'm doing MM2 and DS2 currently just finished bgloves and void
---
No matter how many times i see this one it still makes me smile.
---
Makes good sense. Thanks for the reply
---
I'm a pmod on my pure. I don't know any other pmods nor do I stream. I don't know and mods or anything either. I report when I can and hop worlds  when I'm at the ge to get bots and dicers, but other than than that  i basically afk while I play my main. 
---
Isnt the berserker necklace still good against easy to hit opponents like sand crabs?
---
Maybe that's it. It worked on mobile then I jumped onto RuneLite and it was off. I'll double check! Thank you
---
The time/gp is trash
---
do you have low detail mode on? could just be a texture not loading properly, try turning it off and on
---
Yeah obviously. But you have to admit it looks a little ridiculous having so many overlays and markers for something as mindless as agility. Swear nobody can do anything in the game anymore without needing some sort of overlay
---
Why would you use it when a strength amulet cost 3M less, has 3+ strength bonus and doesn't have negative attack bonuses?
---
60 con for t2 chest is usually fine.
---
Looks more like a half concussed Johnny Knoxville to me 
---
Not sure if you’re aware, the wilderness rune shop only stocks 20 cosmics max at a time, so 11 isn’t terrible
---
You don't sit there and wait the whole time. It's 5 minutes for ~100k
---
Pretty sure it's cookies like how the lightboxes work, that way you don't need to sign up to use the feature
---
sapphires - buy uncut from al kharid or great kourend gem traders and cut them
---
you can also get sapphire necklaces from H.A.M store rooms after the death to the dorgeshuun quest, it's how i got early game dueling rings/games necklaces on my iron. you also get some other assorted jewelry you can sell to the jewelry store in port sarim for some spare cash
---
Same
---
Wouldn't making the icons bigger decrease the skill ceiling when teleporting away from a fight? REJECT
---
this guy scapes
---
“massive defensive stats” lol it’s useless nearly everywhere
---
Did I say y'all were denying anything? Degenerate fuck.
---
Thievving armor has gloves right...
---
Yemalo Shi Cardito 🍆💦
---
It’s what I do best :^)
---
I think it was just to notify you that server maintenance is going on. No update today.
---
probably shades of mort'ton minigame teleport once every 20 minutes
---
if you have morty hard done the burgh de rott teleport on the morytania legs 3 are decently close
---
otherwise i'd fairy ring to canifis and use the myreque shortcut route through the swamp
---
What does he do? I need to get his job lol
---
Ive tried contacting them on everything possible bro they haven't fixed anything 
---
Thought it was 250 like the other runes lol 
---
Imo, the easy/medium diaries should definitely be on the goals list. They really dont take that long because many are done through quests, and others are like cut 1 log. You'll get some nice quality of life benefits you never knew existed. Varrock is a nice one just for the battle staves because you'll get some easy money every day.
---
Yeah, just died at vorkath bc of lag lol. Thanks bro
---
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lundail%27s_Arena-side_Rune_Shop
---
It’s unfortunately the only rune that isn’t haha, makes it quite difficult to get a large number of runes
---
Thanks
---
They essentially had a weird way of using licensed assets to render over the real graphics. "you couldn't tell the difference between this client and a bot"
---
Meaning it was most likely injection based client. Which put a bit of it's self into the client to achieve things, rather than just reading off the client and displaying game data. They where told to stop and did.
---
Probably had to do with the membership price involved in it, and I think personally a friend was a patzi and had to be banned to make a point for oshd.
---
Tbh rather have a third party make and profit off of hd rather than osrs team. Not a big fan of it personally rather see a lot more other updates considering how big of a job it could be. 
---
Besides all that though that's probably their legal team doing what they have to do, which is be dicks. It's not winning for them if someone use's their assets without giving you a bit of the money, or working with you in some way.
---
His history is full of racism. What a filthy human
---
That is actually disgusting
---
If you have the gp and task, there's a slayer cave east of shanty pass which makes dwarf cannon very viable. 
---
For real dude? What does that add to this convo...
---
Shades of Mort'ton minigame teleport or Morytania Legs 3 teleport to Burgh de Rott
---
And then you are the danger.
---
New quest I'd be down with
---
0ne of the first things i used to do as a kid when i played on a new account, or died was kill goblins until I at least got a brass neck. Bothered me to not wear a cape, or a neck slot even if it was 30 gp of value.
---
well his suggestion was added to the conversation for starters, what did yours add? Mine added a clarification.

Wait its a public forum where we can say what we want as long as it's related to the topic and within the sub rules

Your old account isn’t going to work with osrs or if you recover it you will only get the name osrs isn’t 12 yet unless I’m losing my mind. 
---
If you just want membership, give the gold to the account you want membership on and buy bonds in RS3, they will also grant oldschool membership. If you want to swap for gold in oldschool, you'll have to find someone you trust to swap for you.
---
I don’t think it’s a terrible idea, but the big reason people prefer the tab is that it’s one click. Even with hot keys for your worn items tab, you still have to switch tabs, right click the ring, and select your destination. Teleportation jewelry with only one destination kind of defeats the purpose of the teleportation jewelry in the first place. Really all this ends up doing is freeing up an inventory slot, which removes one of the pieces of planning. The advantage to a house teletab is that if you time the ticks right, you can be at your house when you die if you lose a fight, making your items safe and convenient for you to collect. If you’re using a ring of dueling, you’re forfeiting an item slot that you could use a ring of recoil or any other boosting ring in, as well as removing that mechanic from your inevitable deaths. It sounds to me like the problem isn’t necessarily the way the system is set up now, but more with your habits as a pvp player. If the ring of dueling works for you, go for it, but it’s kind of completely missing the point of the home teleport tab.
---
Wholesome, congratz. No more d chain noob look!
---
OR CLIMBING BOOTS. Never forget 
---
its cheaper
---
I kinda wish instead of adding more worlds to add more world capacity. I remember the days where you had to get really creative about training skills because all the popular spots would be too crowded. Like going to entrana and crafting your bow and arrows there to kill the lesser demons simply because everywhere else would be too full.
---
Lol. I love these
---
The drop chance is 1/512 every time he kills the boss. You could also take (1/512)^3223 and find the chance of NOT getting the item is effectively zero. 
---
thats 5 fangs, 4 onyx, 2 vissy and mutagen by 811 xD I'm sorry brother
---
Imagine not knowing how to take a screenshot 
---
ops username checks out

Look at the pm’s lmao 
---
It's a binomial distribution. Used to determine probability of successes in independent trials. 
---
His 99.82 means that say 1000 people killed zulrah as many times as he did. Then .18% of those people wouldn't have a blow pipe. 
---
Doesnt really work quite that way, but good for illustration. That's why unless there's bad luck protection on a drop then you're never any closer to getting a drop. 
---
Yup, "hand-picked" is complete bullshit
---
::bank
---
There's not much I wouldn't do for some canes chicken. Better get that extra sauce tho.
---
I was easily getting that by monopolising the bronze/iron arrow market in the Varrock archery shop on F2P worlds.
---
this is why ppl get rsi fucking clicking 15 times when you could have clicked 1 or 2 times lol
---
I think you mean 50%
---
I'm a dumb ass with the cboots update. Thought there was a glitch so alched around 500 of them for 46k not knowing their price was actually 76k when update hit...
---
i mean, everybody can but people choose to go on the path of least resistance, if they can make a boring grind a bit easier then you bet they will.

“Where The Wild Things Are”

u r lucky , not for ur drop but having the possibility to make this long term  iron man with ur brother

But you can make them
---
Tbow and a charged blowpipe both give range strength. Bow has 20 and bp has 40. This is then combined with the strength of the darts. 
---
A blowpipe with bronze darts is better dps than throwing dragon because of the extra range strength and accuracy the blowpipe gives

Can't believe you got downvoted for this

You need to find your self a girl mate

Don't do what the other guy said, too much risk and you're going to die a lot. I'm assuming you're talking about pking in the wild and not BH or PVP worlds. 
---
 You didn't mention your range lvl but just grab some d hides, rune crossbow, dstone bolts, and a range pot. Congrats you're a bolt ragger. Hop around at chaos altar or chins to get your feet wet. Maybe bring a dose of super combat, a dds, and some snare runes when you feel like risking more.

[An evil justiciar](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_turncloak)  is part of the lore, so never say never :)

I do have a design in place for how it could be obtained (barrows armour sink) but lately I’ve been of the opinion that we should slow down the rate in which we’ve been adding BiS items. I wouldn’t want it to replace Bandos either, but perhaps offer an alternative focused on accuracy rather than strength (and degradable - I may be in the minority opinion on this...). Also, I’d want it to be released as a set of 3 armours as that was the original plan, but the chances of that passing a poll is unlikely.
---
Nothing is scheduled (design is quite incomplete) nor has it been pitched to the wider team, so take all this with a grain of salt :P
---
This cunt again?
---
Or much in general tbh
---
How do you unlock the dagger and not the long?
---
how would you define mutually exclusive?

Amazing! Thank you! :)

Thanks guys i feel like a star⭐
---
I'd rather shoot my dick off with a crossbow than build a birds nest.
---
That being said I had a fucking blast hunting kebbits with a falcon.
---
That's about a 34% chance for someone to get a drop in that amount of kills. 
---
You just find an online calculator, plug in the probability, number of successes, and number of trials. 
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply.
---
50 att, 82 str, 85 range, 15 prayer.

Well we don't know the mechanics but dhcb is bis against most dragons if you use dragon bolts.

It is a lot of money to your average redditor. Show me your trillion bank big guy, you dont have shit.

If you win a ferrari, you wont drive and show it? People who are lucky with their drops are not especially bragging, more happy to show it. I’ve also gone dry on other drops so.

So why is this in this sub? This has literally nothing to do with OSRS besides the fact that he's "playing"? OSRS. None of this video has OSRS in it.

Honestly really disappointed, I thought he'd be flossing his teeth.

Pm me mate I'll spot you 10m 
---
Fair enough 
---
I mean I can see why he's upset. 1.4b is potentially hundreds of real-life hours of work to get to. That's hundreds of hours "stolen" from him. Especially starting from scratch, but the fact that he feels blameless is the issue.

Now requires 81 slayer.

If purely MTX cosmetics wete to become a thing, that's not terrible. But as said with other comments Jagex has a bad reputation to turn MTX into buyable game.
---
By cosmetics I do not mean shit like the fish mask(a tradeable thing)  or lucky items. Untradeble 0 stats 0 requirements purely for fashionscape kinda things. Perhaps an item used to perm unt capes giving skillers a viable option.
---
Just did the math on it for fun and it doesnt even out. There would be around 5 completely empty members worlds with that player amount if you want to have 1k players on each world first. Still what Op claimed was far from truth, 1k players on almost all worlds EXCEPT on thos worlds where There arent 1k players....
---
Maybe, but if people can easier explain to others *why* these scams are 100% never going to be legit, perhaps they can spread the word to people who are about to fall for them. Begging and doubling in particular are almost always successful because people have this stupid "but what if..." mentality.

No, it isn't. Ever since RWT has taken ahold of the market, it's actually been quite the opposite. Back in the day, it was hard to get GP because there wasn't any outlets to sell and Buy GP. Nowadays, you can chuck 10B at Sand Casino and buy it back in minutes.

Best in slot for 70 mage?
---
Is Aharims and Occult the way to go?
---
All you have to do is buy the outfit,  do the hard diary task involving it and then sell pieces back to buy the upper level. Your advice might slow OP down from finishing diaries
---
If you are open to deep wildy pking then 94 mage would be great. I have a maxed 50 attack pure and I only can take so much of edgeville. I find most of my time is spent in pvp world's now
---
Did you include members worlds only into that? Cause I think that’s the big point here, as FTP is just bots anyways.
---
But after looking back at it I didn’t even notice how fucking low pvp/dmm worlds are. Like those really take the average down a lot.
---
It isn't a lot of GP, since you can buy it off the street so easy.
---
And, you insult me, then want me to give you free handouts? LMFAO.
---
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
---
Doubtful :) this IS Jagex 
---
Lmao what?? They don’t literally mean a person sift through thousands to find a selection just for you...
---
Set your guy splashing then have a quick one
---
Why would you spot him 10m? He'll just get scammed again.
---
"so easy" So spending 1,400 on a game currency is easy to you. Ok trump
---
I have a feeling it is a feature. I noticed this with cooking and it is a little annoying so if there is a solution I would like to know as well. I like to watch youtube or browse reddit while cooking but I can’t cook a full inventory. When i log back in 1 item will be uncooked. The log out timer is longer when in combat, i was training at bandits so the consistent aggressive mobs  probably helped?
---
Imagine falling for one of the most common scams on the game lmfaooooo
---
I don't think you watch Alkan if you think he's better than most. He overreacts to pretty much everything with his stupid laugh. Work hard and get an infernal cape? Laugh for 20 seconds. Get a whip drop from an abby demon task? Laugh for 20 seconds. Get an orange boater from a clue? Laugh for 20 seconds.
---
I really like his content, but someone complimenting Alkan on his reactions is... *laughable*
---
Yo the ads that pop up and take you off the page gotta go. I know you want money but fuck man, the wiki loads slow already bad enough to have to load it twice and then have an ad take up the whole page and then take you to a Ad website with popups.

I got 99 farming a few days, yet still no pet :( Trying to do as many seaweed runs as possible to maximise my chances

? Easily maintainable playing 10h a day lol but yeh

lately people have been trying to crash me at dust devils a lot more
---
Go do the Regicide quest. They want to summon a dark lord, just like the newspost said. But the dialogue is about how "zamorak fury will be upon us" and "if the gates to zamoraks world is opened we will all die!". Are you the guy that just holds down the spacebar during quests?

Unless you use good bots.

Silly billy,you have a small willy

Mate once you make some gp back come trade me at duel arena so I can give you some arrows and a bow and we can stake

**kill this bot already, please.**

You’d pay 1k for that? Eh, best I can do is 250
---
Ya it honestly sounds pretty weird to play runescape in a co-op setting. I mean whenever I play I only interact with my alt account talking is just stupid and ruins your general efficiency 
---
At not for. However , yes yes it is.
---
Just got my quest cape tonight. The 3 worst quests in the game as far as annoyance are MM2, Mournings 2, and Darkness of Hallowvale is the absolute worst by a long shot.
---
for me it only screenshots if the game is not in focus
---
What is black sally's niche?

It's nothing to do with pathing. There's an obscure interaction with some doors where when they've been opened and closed x number of times there's a refractory period where they won't close again for a few seconds.

That quest is absolutely the worst. Ran out of pies and had to completely leave the area and get more. Never again

No it's not staged, and it's not the "first kill" either. Most of those episodes consist of hundreds of scuffed clips that don't get put in.

To be fair, the first poll was 5 min duration. The second was an1 min TB scroll obtained from Revs that they packed together.

I’ve been F2P only for a while now and it’s almost game-breaking not to have in the PK scene. Sometimes the community as a whole doesn’t actually know best. The same people who vetoed it are the ones on here that tell F2Pers to get members when they ask things like “Hill Giants or Zombies?”

Why the fuck do you care about graphics on a game like this? and aside from the environment details all of the models and animations that came with hd looked fucking disgusting anyway.

I still haven't beat the fight caves and i'm cb 120. Getting to Jad isn't the problem. You get your supplies, and afk most of the waves - nothing more than a huge time sink. Then after finally 1h~ he spawns and for someone like me, who can't get used to the games tick-system, gets buttfucked because i just cannot switch prayers properly. I'm bad at prayer flicking. I'm bad at tile movement. I'm bad at changing gear mid-combat. I'm bad at concentrating on multiple things at ones.
---
Yes, Jad, triple jads and zuk are hard as fuck. For you, who beat the inferno, it's not, obviously. For most people, it's something they will never beat.
---
Does that mean i'm just bad? Yes and no. I'm bad at this game, even after trying each boss 20+ times. But souls bosses are easy as fuck for me.
---
I beat all 5 Souls Games on NG+ and even for the hardest bosses i didn't need as many tries as in this game.
---
Maybe if i didn't need to pay for each try so damn much and waste time i would finally get a firecape. But after so many damn failed attempts i gave up. It's not fun. Whilst with souls games, i needed like 20+ tries for fume knight at NG+ but i didn't give up because it was fun. I actually felt like i was improving after each death and i could try instantly again. The Souls Series is a joke compared to the bosses in this game.
---
I cannot beat vorkath and get my questcape (it's the only quest left for me and i will never get it).
---
I can only do 3-5 demonic gorillas per trip, which is why i blocked black demons.
---
The only "bosses" that are actually possible for me are Barrows, Skotizo and the giant mole. That's it. 
---
Not everyone has the same skill level at this game as you, and even after trying hours and hours they will never achieve it. Look how much of the playerbase has an infernal cape.
---
2mill isnt really much, depending on your levs you can make 2mill in a days work
---
We already have the stats required as well as all the quests needed on the official wiki. It tells you every requirement you could possibly need. Haven't you used the wiki before?

you will probably need two recoil rings
---
It's not a fucking barrage spot you spastic. What if he wants Totems or Crystals or he's using Bonecrusher? There's many reasons to use catacombs which don't include barraging to 200M slayer until your neighbors can smell your chair. 
---
Imagine making a new acc just to post about your obsession about some other autist on reddit. Nice.
---
With slayer (at higher levels) you can make 2m or even more off one task. If you can kill kurasks id say do that in the mean time off task till you figure out what else to do

I only had 9 mill gp. Can you look me up and give me some advice on money making? RSN vamplord111

It’s not a mage intended area. Is mage the meta and what a vast majority of people do there? Sure, no doubt. But jagex didn’t create this area with the intention of it being where people will only use magic there. 
---
The dude called him pathetic and to fuck off because he wasn’t being efficient/playing the game the way that he himself believes is the right way to do it. This game is about playing it the way that you enjoy doing so. Shawnbay is everything that’s wrong with the elitist mentality many have in this community. If you see nothing wrong with him shaming and being an asshole, then you sir, are apart of the problem ^.^

make sure to pray melee
---
&gt;Only thing that has me a little nervous is the fact that they even have my email. When signing up for various services I NEVER use this email. I only give it out for important stuff. How would they have gotten it? 
---
You must have given it out at some point in the past. Clan sign ups? Buying gold? Displayed on social media/youtube and you 'liked' or posted on a phishing post? 
---
My suggestion is change your registered e-mail address and use it only for your runescape account.
---
I started barrows on my ironman on new years and got guthans top on my 4 chest!

99% sure he's meta for fast points

Thanks Mrjew
---
Pro tip. Dont trust a single soul online. Not one person, (runescape or not)
---
Sure. There are some really good, awsome, honest people, good hearted and down to earth too. But for every one good, there are 50 thousand bad people that just fake it till they make it. And you(not just you, but me too and him an her as well)responding to them and falling for their trap makes them multiply,  because they brag about it, other ppl see that, and they wanna get a peice of pie too. So be careful,  i wouldnt hit the trade button with a random person unless i knew what i was trading is gone forever.

Hard to tell if he's being sarcastic or not tbh. Imagine thinking that talking in an MMO is 'just stupid'.

yeah this whole "what if"-ism is stupid when you are to look at it from a fundamental level. If you are barraging, should you be barraging in catacombs? si senor, this is correcto. If you are meleeing should you be meleeing in slayer tower because its more efficient? si senor, this is correcto. This whole "but what if" is stupid, what if someone likes to hop in an afro and green dhide body and rag everyone he accounters and disguise it as "what if he just enjoys it" lol. I dont think the person has ill intentions, but saying its "logical" is laughable beyond reality when its the most illogical thing.

You gotta be in the right mood. Using RuneLite shift click remapping helps a lot. Just mellow out with some music and eventually it becomes pretty brain dead like every other skill.

---
I agree those items all look great (scythe looks good too) I think by far the worst looking items in the game are the odium/malediction ward ornament kits, and the dragon pickaxe ornament kit.
---
Also I think they do a great job with some of the monsters, such as cerberus and the new hydra. They look great, but the environments and most of the items, not so much. TOB in general looks pretty good imo but COX looks stupid
---
Also I think it does affect performance. Go to zeah in arceus library top floor, or mushroom forest in fossil island, and fps will drop to single digits on weaker CPUs in resizable mode.

But everything is setup to leech you off via inflation/taxation, and the rules are in there so you're a salaryman instead of a bussiness person because it incentivices centralized nodes for taxation (big corporations, handicaps for small/new agents - anti competition -).

Can't get totem parts or shards in tower, better drops in cata. Nothing says you only burst/barrage in the catacombs either. If you don't like it that's fine, but you're one of tens of thousands of players, and some people are going to play differently than you, and there's no problem with that.

When i say bank im talking cash, because you dont plan on selling those items right? You use them right, so cash stacks about 10millish 7-10, which isnt bad at all mine is 15m cash unles your doing end game content or high risk pvp 10m is all you need atm

Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the sandwich lady so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I get the random event I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with the sandwich lady. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of sandwich lady's tight pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/bread babies.

Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with my body pillow. I went to town on that thing until it's one rock solid insult to god's green Earth. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my PC. I might not ever get to see the sandwich lady again.

I changed it to be much brighter back then too. Can’t stand dark games

It's the exact same design problem, but harder to solve since the dialog options can be like 4 lines of long dialog.

Oh I thought when people say my bank is 10 mill or what ever that they were adding up all the valuables and their gp together like their net worth.

Most people keep them on the entire time, even when killing monsters in single combat, because it's just not worth the effort to switch back and forth.

The Note series is a godsend
---
I agree, getting to jad isnt hard. However, you would find jad laughably easy if you were able to practice it with a souls pace, as in spending mostly a few minutes getting back to it. The timegate is there to make the content require some effort even in learning, where most of the difficulty of rs has to be taken from. Most content doesnt require anything close to good reactions or precise clicks, because osrs is such a simple and solved game.
---
The same thing is with triple jads and zuk; triple jads give you a few seconds to react to each, and I think anyone could do it if they were just able to go in and start with triple jads. Same with zuk; it's a 1-hit killing, time consuming boss to get to, but the _boss itself_ is not hard. You just run from a shield spot to another, and if it wasnt for the time needed to actually get to the fight the challenge would be laughable. So you have to master all of the individual challenges and perform them in a series, so that the whole challenge can be considered hard. 
---
I'm not saying that the fight caves or the inferno aren't challenging as a whole, what I'm saying that the bosses inside are not actually that hard, and the challenge would be ruined by being able to practice the bosses with no timegate.
---
I'm sorry you don't enjoy the challenges presented to you or that the games engine doesn't click with you. However, fire and infernal capes would be devalued by a ton if the practice wasnt as it is now; slow and nerve-wrecking. This is the nature of the 2000s-era java game.

Just turn the steel skin prayer (or other defensive prayers) on with 50+ combat stats and bring some food. Overhead prayers dont work against him since he just changes attack styles to the prayer you dont have active. Stand against the wall so you are not knocked away too far away. He can hit something like 23-26 so make sure your health is above that. 
---
We get it. You read the wiki. Stop trying to flex basic knowledge.

You're ignoring that I'm saying at 92 attack he's not going to be at rock crabs so your original post is retarded and just looks like you're being one of those "well actually!" types

Farm the highest herb you can grow, teak trees, willow trees, orange (curry once hit 42), and strawberries. Use ultracompost for all and ur crops should not die that often(expect 5-10% chance).

It's literally the same concept. Watching someone play a sport when you could play the same sport yourself but you aren't. Same goes for Runescape, you could be playing the game but you're watching someone play it. Why? Because you are entertained by them. That's why people watch anything it's so they can be entertained.

I like watching rs videos because i get to see parts of the game that are more or less unattainable for me. I have maybe 4-6 hours a week to play, whereas these guys are playing 12 hrs/day. It’s cool to see how they progress so quickly (compared to what I can manage) and I like seeing how the end-game content works.

Not really, yesterday I was just helping a friend who wanted to train in NMZ and was asking the best methods. The obby set-up is really good but once you hit those stats its better to swap to DH.

I'm guessing if an item is 989k, you mean to input 1m but you put in 100k instead.
---
Theres no use for shit click remapping at zmi lol
---
No thats if you actually train it.
---
You only need to get 77 afterwards it's trainable skill
---
Ye, the irony of you not being able to interpret an A-OK joke!
---
We have the same information as the old wiki and then some... what exactly were you looking for?
---
How did I not think of this myself. I make constant jokes revolving my boy Chris. smh.
---
All of them are still just as afk, only Dad makes it annoying. Definitely worth using Ice Troll, Moss giant and Arrg. Next best two is Count Draynor and Sand Snake.
---
rip. If I'm on my btw I just bring my main while I find a new world lol. Im petty as shit
---
well? 
---
The point isn't to get the loot. It's to annoy them til they leave. 
---
Yep, do you? Cmon, you've discouraged and condemned tons of my humorous jokes.
---
Jokes founded in reality must include some logic and accuracy as well. That's how you create a original and highly relatable joke, with *excellence*.

I’m not that sure, they’re all fairly expensive so I personally don’t use them. The upside is that u can get 200-300k xp/hr if u do. U can check the wiki for the runes needed. If you are casual, I would prefer u kill lesser demons. 
---
nope, sadly.

It's extremely funny. Your lack of creativity and your uncalled for bloodthristy nonsense is showing. Respond with some humor if you're gonna respond at all, other refrain. I don't want to see your idiotic hatred here.

No...it was way back in 2008

no shit now stop posting phish links retard

Yeah most likely. It was all of their servers located in Cali iirc.

I can't block like 75% of the userbase here, every page would be empty. They're the fools who have to block/ignore me.

Great, now it’s legal for Jagex to FUCK RuneScape.

sorry for the heads up

hell nah, pets are already annoying as fk.
---
Playing it on pc(if you have it) would make it easier. Just relax, prayer is more important than seeing jad’s health go up due to the healers. Just pull them one by one and kill them.
---
oh shit, been a while since i did nmz. u/maxuelos look at this guys comment.
---
Listen, I know you have the best of intentions, but firstly, there have been about 5 scam streams a day for the past 3 years... secondly, they get reported here 10+ times a day and finally YOU INCLUDED THE FUCKING LINK ON REDDIT. 
---
Just stop. 
---
The

teh repost is strong.
---
Surprised you aint seen me around there xD
---
Every thread. Someone compliments Serene, a mindless bandwagon-user claims that it's an alt!
---
Used to be a funny joke, but some people seem to legitimately believe this nonsnse...lmao!
---
Just shut the fuck up and let people have features that dont fucking negatively affect anyone else without being a critical contrarian dickhead?
---
My whole point is that it's something a new player would say lol. They fall under the misconception that essentially any task that requires a decent amount of running means graceful = bis if there's no combat.
---
They don't realize that graceful has no extra benefit after you drop below 0kg, and that the run restoration set effect only kicks in while you're idling or doing some kind of action. If you're simply just running everywhere it doesn't do much at all.
---
Torag's hammers do about as much DPS as an adamant scimitar.
---
So the video I posted is legit?
---
Which farmer? Because the only one with a shop I could think off is the farm between Draynor and Falador
---
I wonder if it’s selfish to want your achievements to be time and skill related only? 
---
If you feel that time towards creating these items and systems doesn’t take recourses away from the experience and game then you are wrong. 
---
Dose the sense of competition with the current community drive you to play or is purely personal? 
---
The way I see it, why do we find the need to add MTX when we can just add? 
---
I like the idea of more cosmetics but I want to play the game to get them. Seeing someone with a shiny helm that was bought will never compare to seeing someone with luck or skill of getting something cool. 
---
MTX have a hollow feeling to them. 
---
Thoughts? What is best in the spirit of the game? 
---
Haha the sex story omegalul

Welp..update your senses and renew your perception!

You can buy them directly from Amy farmer by a patch. It was a recent change.
---
couple things, firstly, don't try to out dps the healers unless you're in absolute max.  Second, don't try to use sound, animations are superior, lastly, just keep trying, it's all about nerves and comfort of execution.

What stag bonus and strength bonus will the dragon hasta have? Thinking of using it to farm green draggies

Try and put the political disagreements aside for once. I assume that you're insinuating, liberal. Don't try and backtrack this one!
---
This is a great route since you have to do legends quest and all the quest pre reqs. This is a great start, But you'll need 175 qp total to complete rfd. 
---
Check out f2p quest "speed runs" most can be done in 45 minutes total to get you to dragon slayer at 32 required qp.
---
This is why :
---
- I did not RWT
---
- The email is sent to my personal email
---
-This email is not sumbitted at my communication prefrences in my account settings
---
-There is no offence in my account settings
---
-The email doesnt adress my account name
---
Why am I telling you guys this ?
---
-&gt; The email is not telling me to click anywhere. The links are also leading to real osrs links. The email is from noreply@jagex.
---
Do you guys think this is a joke or a really bad phising attempt ?
---
For real dude? What does this suggestion add to the game? Re posting it every couple days and getting nowhere, why dont people try asking on the QA sessions? Probably because of small brain.
---
I question if some of the people who QQ here actually play this game sometimes
---
It’s not that we cant find/see it. It’s just some stupidly simple QoL that would improve everything about looking at loot. 
---
You should develop decency and an advanced desirable moral compass before responding!
---
Depending on range and mage levels I would throw some money into those on mm2 tunnels. Levels are best dps upgrade there is. That's if you boss at all. Got 84 con? Save for rigour? R
---
Do you have a little brother? He probably looks up to his big brother and wants to do what he does. And guess what, OP is a good big brother and actually is sharing something he does with his brother. Phishing is literally something that affects people of all ages, remember the fappening, that was phishing emails sent that looked like iCloud to celebrities, are you going to tell me those people are too inexperienced to have iCloud accounts?
---
This is a very wholesome post warning the influx of new players about stuff like this, and there's no point in being this pedantic about it. OP isn't begging for GP or anything, he's explaining what happened.
---
Kettle black. Your “opinions” are contrarian elitist bullshit and the way you express them is holier than thou and you REFUSE to see that and that’s why people on this sub _fucking hate you_.

What I did. Then I spawn under centre ketzek and get hit by his melee for 54
---
How much u make from flipping that?
---
This is 100% favored by the OSRS community. Yes we like new slayer bosses here and new areas etc but this is literally a new look to the game. A multi-million dollar like Jagex should be able to afford the leg work for this update, i know it's not a simply copy/paste but majority of it would be utilizing previous codes pre-eoc and then polishing it, i'm not saying it's the easiest thing on the planet. But for people with the skillset of the developers who created HD and worked on it should be able to implement it without that much hassle.
---
Thank you very much , I appreciate your insight.
---
Thank you very much

240 qp, only 73 range and not enough money for BP :/
---
Autism
---
Totally appropriate usage for those who have fallen for the hivemind.
---
Not anymore, it’s just frowned upon because things like this happen but they changed the rules a while ago
---
if you max doing only slayer, you’d get 99 slayer before 99 all combat stats. How are combat stats the passive ones if it takes longer to train them, lol..
---
Or go grab some chaos gauntlets and kill fire giants with fire wave (I think). It won't be as quick as enchanting bolts or Teleporting, but you can make some money back and you'll get hp exp.
---
Seek help psycho, and develop decency!

Yes, thats default game behavior. Its been a few months since they added that.

Indeed, I'm not the one issuing hateful ad-hominems towards others. That's on you. Change, or stop responding!
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly I can forgive my brother for naivety in his young age. And I learned to keep my ac safe a long time ago. Still though people are inherently imperfect and no amount of Jagex security measures will prevent someone from giving their ac away. Ultimately despite there being crappy scammers in the community i'm just glad that the majority of people involved with osrs are a fantastic bunch just looking to enjoy the game and help others do the same. 
---
I'm wid it
---
I've recieved this same email multiple times since 2011. It is indeed a phishing email. 
---
I think they meant don’t post the link.
---
This isn’t news if you browse the sub at all, there’s literally hundreds of these fake giveaways/double xp/ quitting giving away my bank streams.
---
Found the person without 99 agility in 2019. Nice try, you're unable to establish the high ground!
---
There's so many spelling mistakes there's no way it's legit. The "real os pages" often have a very similar looking url, and look identical to the is pages. You can always check your inbox when logging in to the game and that'll reflect any legitimate info with your account
---
Unless you're absolutely committed to efficiency (which can get unhealthy), I'd suggest you take it easy. Poke around, see what you need to access new areas or items and work towards that. You'll always run into "obstacles" you'll wish to overcome. Eventually you're able to tick off entire achievement diary levels, fight bosses with actual mechanics and get into some group activities. 
---
Once you're running dry on things to do, you might want to consider turning around one last time before selling your soul to getting all 99s lol.
---
For money making, Blast Furnace is really nice early on (gives reason to complete the hero's quest for ice gloves), Motherlode mine is a decent relaxing alternative.

Yikes.

SUGGESTION: stop mentioning the fucking coloured whips on mobile. They know.

Thanks, I interpreted that as "we are going to ban you if you do it again"

Well, the thing is I started like 8 months after hardcore ironman was released. Also I don't really care for being rank 1 too much, I enjoy training the skill and that's it. Same as mattizilla really.

It turned into RS3

"Games are supposed to be fun".

It’s a phishing attempt. I get these aswell every now and then. Its very easy to change the the email adress from where the email was sent.

I agree. I honestly can’t remember my order but I brought ark up first a lot for weapons.

Desert Treasure is a good one to get done as soon as you can. Provided you have the skills for it ofcourse.

Its not impossible, theres Runescape private servers that either have group ironman already or are currently making it...

They can make it and they should make it.

The economy of osrs is fucked, and this is a good way to let people play the game how it used to be played without taking out trading completely.

EOC is one of the best things to happen to RS3. They just released it in a horrible state and lost all their players. The system is super nice know and it so much fun to play. I cant imagine going back to click and afk.
---
Why are you proud of this
---
You can easily check if they are real just by logging into your account on the real RS website.
---
You're not too far off so I bet you can get it before him :P
---

---
Yeah changing the layout from vertical to horizontal will bring hundreds, nay thousands of new players!
---
Why is this removed?
---
Do you comment on every post on this site?
---
Or just make it like a glory amulet and let us right-click teleport
---
this is not long term, trust me i have a wyvern alt. only 92 range is early game.
---
After losing money you wanted to lose more. Nice
---
1. Sounds are really only necessary if you're not in-sight of Jad at any point, although they're useful in conjunction with animations.
---
2. Idk how big your phone is but tagging healers might be difficult on mobile. I feel like misclicking can also be an issue with mobile.
---
3. Don't try to out-dps the healers. If that's your plan right now, I'd watch more guides on how to deal with them before another attempt.
---
It's a blessing and a curse that we have so many new players here; on one hand the playerbase expanding serves as incentive for Jagex to pump out more and more good content, but on the other hand some of these people (like OP) are asking for the exact same things that killed the original game that led to 07scape's creation in the first place. Lest the day comes where enough of these people come along to the point where things like Summoning and overloads actually could pass a poll and we have to reboot 07scape V2...
---
What the fuck is an advanced desirable moral compass. You’re just making shit up, serene. 
---
Why didn't you use plant cures ?

wow. amazing. incredible. fantastic work.

Did they implement text over drops yet? I stopped playing mobile because its so annoying to right click on every drop to see if theres anything i want in there.

Just to clarify and stop the salty comments, this is NOT my screen. It’s from google. It’s a joke. Calm down lol 😂

As someone who melees the nechs in catacombs, I refill prayer at my home and run back with kourend tele in the house, takes me like 15 seconds to refill. I don't want to burst because I wanna Max my melee and I don't want to have to swap spell books/not have the ability to alch. I don't want to go to the slayer tower because to bank or refill take like 30 seconds-45 seconds and they have worse drops. 
---
o no my fragile masculinity 
---
Nice man, I lost motivation a few months ago to keep questing and haven't played since ):
---
Yeah bro, add me cause Idk how to do that lmao sorry for your bad experience 
---
This is especially important when you get into tob/cox on the iron, because the good teams split. So people just raid on the meme and payout splits from mains.
---
ah yep. i know a few people like that. you have the honesty to admit when you are wrong and they see it as a sign of weakness. 
---
damn that's cold. well fuck serene i guess.
---
Uh, yeah it took me 12 attempts on task.. Some advice:
---
Use sounds. If you're anything like me, the animations are too similar until it's too late and the range bullshit already fucked up your day.  
---
Default to range prayer, and if you hear the sound for mage, switch your prayer. That's the easiest thing to focus on in my experience. 
---
Do not try to out DPS the healers. I was 93 range in nearly maxed gear when I got my cape, and even with only 2 healers on Jad it seemed to take too long. Focus on your prayer switch, poke a healer, focus on switch, poke next healer. 
---
Don't second guess your switches once you commit. If you do, it'll be too late anyway and you're gonna end up missing your next switch if you didn't already die. 
---
Final tip: Drink a beer and take a deep breath. Getting twitchy is the easiest way to blank out and get 1 hit.
---
Good luck brotha.
---
Nope. You train combat and get slayer xp as a bonus.
---
I hope this is one of those AMA's
---
I wanna know how I can blow molten glass I heated 3 months ago. That shits cooled down now no doubt but somehow I can still mould it

This is how I've always felt about rc and agility.

But yesterday I did agility for 3 hours straight to go front 68 to 71 just for zulrah.  It's a lot easier with an accrual useful goal on the horizon
---
I enjoy reading your comments as well. However I do continue to dislike all of them for the fun of it. Plus, it makes me feel better about myself. Woo!
---
Are bloods really that tolerable? Do you profit or lose  money doing them?

Ugh, when you’ve got a whole community against you, maybe it’s time to take a look at yourself.

Look like what? Its default.

---

---
Regular drops are about 8-10k each on average in my experience.
---
They used to hand them out like candy to players who spent too much time on the RS forums (like 8+ hours a day of posting and reminding players of rules...). It started with good intentions, but ultimately, once the thrill of “unpaid moderating” dies off, then it was just unnecessary power given to a handful of players who didn’t use it correctly anyway. Instead of muting players for breaking rules, they used it as a means to flexing their silver crown around. 
---
They’d regularly visit their favorite friend chats and use their powers to mute anyone they felt like. They’d have a gold star in all these chats, they muted people on a whim, and whenever they felt like it. In one example, I talked in a friend’s chat years ago, with a few people, and a P Mod would pop in from time to time. He played like 12 hours a day so when he wasnt in our chat, he was in another. The dude literally said “mute spree!” Out of nowhere one time. Unfortunately I’d spoken a couple minutes before, and me and like 6-7 buddies in the immediate chat box got a 24 hour mute. And that was it. Nothing ever came of it, and he remained a P Mod for years after. 
---
This started becoming rampant almost immediately and I think around 2010 - 2011 was when they realized granting P Mod status to people who spent literal days playing RuneScape and moderating forums for free didn’t deserve P Mod crowns. They were revoking crowns left and right suddenly, after years of damage done to the community.
---
Then, they became a dying breed. Nobody to give silver crowns to that they could actually trust because apparently it’s not the slumlords of the RS forums or JMods friends... until they decided content creators are the perfect compromise. They spend a shit ton of time dedicated to RS (without pay by Jagex), and they *actually understand* what it means to be a community, and how they can help make it better, by providing interesting content that entertains all of us, and encouraging players to play by the rules. 
---
Or at the very least, they understand the importance of it, because we are literally the community that makes them successful. They have an active stake in making this game and the way players interact with each other, better.
---
P Mods are honestly a cancer upon this game. Unfortunately, most of them simply aren’t cut out for it. They mute people willy nilly. They’re childish. They don’t understand *why* they are PMods beyond having the ability to mute whoever they deem necessary, and unfortunately, they don’t have to follow any sort of guidelines, even though they should be acting in correspondence with the rules. Until PMods are actively moderates themselves, we’re simply better off with as few of them as possible. 
---
My fucking 10hp hcim died last night stealing cakes... Dc'd.

Why would you go looking for this post from 2 weeks ago
---
404 Error: Two drops found.
---
I agree, it would be nice to see them added quickly, but to give them the benifit of the doubt, i'd imagine that a game change like that has to be thought over quite a bit.
---
I mean argue what you want but EHP rates for combats on CML are ridiculously high for a reason. It's cause half of your melee xp is passive from slayer. Meanwhile slayer EHP rates are 90k xp/hr and that's with a spec transfer alt and an alt to lure dust devils and smoke devils, which requires super mega autism.
---
Faster kills, so yes.

Hold it up to a mirror
---
It is in the plugin list though. If you turned it off in there you lose the button for it on the sidebar. You need the sidebar button to make screen markers and choose which ones are visible, but once you do that you can just turn the plugin on or off if you’re going to be doing the same activity for a while and want to take a break and turn them off temporarily.

The cost of runes/tablets vs free cape tele... not to mention leveling up construction if it isn’t level 45 already. 
---
Ardy cape = free unlimited prayer tele
---
PoH = initial cost of leveling cons and building chapel plus every tele costs between 300-700gp
---
Not saying that should break most banks... but still $$$ is a valid answer.
---
Also what is the benefit of taking your approach to a player who has neither cons level or ardy cape?
---
I like doing nats. Everyone says it's aids until 77 so I should loooooove bloods lol. The Xp rate is a lot better. 56 rc btw lol

There are several ways to train magic, perhaps you should visit osrs.wiki.
---
I'd also like to note that alching for profit isn't a viable option in most scenarios, and if you do get hold of an item that alchs for profit, it'd be too slow to acquire plenty of (due to GE limit).
---
Rats - highest ratio of exp/gp, afk, about a day or two or so of splashing. 
---
Teleporting - a few hours, relatively expensive
---
Pick which is best for you.

RS is alive and well. Not "On life-support" as I've heard some people say.

Hahaha awesome comic as always. :D

It was one of the many factors that turned it into ezscape and OSRS does not need to follow down the same path or it will end up like trashscape

yeah then you try to tank it and wait for barrage timer and run again...

Zamorak creates chaos so civilization can grow stronger. He's more chaotic good. He doesn't want to control people like Saradomin or Zaros. He just wants people to grow stronger and believes chaos is the best way to do it. How can you argue that's evil.

Slayer is one of the best money makers for combat post 77, and one of the most efficient ways to train combat and still have some reward. That being said, runecraft is easier because it's constant pace. Nothing changes, and as long as you stay focused it's very mindless. 
---
Slayer is one of the longest 99s. Grind it out man, it pays in the end. 
---
Aren't the methods that make money from slayer much slower exp than cannoning everything? Sounds like OP is looking to max and just wants the best exp rates possible.

So what you're saying is that the built in function for the game to alert you for any untradeable drop or any tradeable drop above a set value of your choosing isn't enough?? That you absolutely require playing with the keyboard closed and leaving it open is simply too inconvenient? 
---
Idk dude I'm pretty sure I know what qol is and I also know that qol and game-ruining-easyscape exist on a spectrum. Now I'm not saying this is all the way in one camp, but I am saying that every update that passes should consider where on this spectrum it lies. Because with every inch down the line we go, we get closer and closer to our game being shit.

---
It normalized DPS across all weapon types. Tier was the only differing factor. So all t70 weapons (whips, hastas, barrows, etc) did more or less the same DPS.
---
Not to mention power creep (tier 75, 80, 82, 85, 87, 90, 92) caused more of these items to be dumped into the economy and plummet in price.
---
Similar to how, today, Rune items are all alch price compared to 2006 times. 
---
yeah i feel the same way. i hate having to constantly move and regear and kill stuff that drops absolute trash.
---
Sounds really neat
---
Please, no. 
---
Imagine if the cost of an instance was detetmined by the number of other instances currently being used in the same spot.
---
So the bandos instance would be expensive, while the zammy instance would be cheap.
---
idk i did it for a while and didn't see any bots or other players near me, but that was only for like 2 hours so probably not representative.

They dont tell you the date of your offence. They take time to accrue evidence then ban you at a later date

Did you actually just call someone an animal....holy fuck you're honestly unbearable
---
It really is. We have so many storage options- poh cabinets, hidey holes, diango for holiday items...not to mention wise old man removing all outdated quest items from your bank. 
---
No matter what number they give you, you will always fill it and complain tbh. Well documented result over time, we all do it. Just clear some space and make it work. 
---
They also literally can't render more objects on screen at once so it absolutely isn't happening lol. 
---
That’s what I said when I reposted a meme
---
Are you sure about that 
---
This is why pvmers are actually pathetic virgins for life.  If a pker was in my pking spot I'd just pk him and then flame him to show my true alpha status.
---
True, and I suppose we'll see. They said it'd be around cerb tier difficulty so I don't envision it being a big deal either way honestly. 
---
What are your stats? Are you boosting? What are you using for gear?
---
Hi broswae!

---
Yes 1000x this.
---
correct, it’s actually 19 now but i haven’t gotten on the desktop version to change it 
---
just why
---
you also have to take into account things like over-killing. if something is at 6 hp and you wouldve hit max, the weapon with the faster attack will be able to hit faster, resulting in a gain of dps over the slower, harder hitting weapon. For training you should use a magic shortbow (i) over a rune crossbow (and dark bow)in most situations.
---
shut up serene
---
What you dislike about slayer is what most people like about slayer. It's one of the least monotonous skills, in the sense that you switch it up all the time; different mobs, different bosses. That being said every skill gets boring after a while.
---
Real name Cole Gate
---
Yeah I watch Netflix no matter what I'm doin on rs but it doesn't matter.  Shit is still boring as fuck
---
He sets up five computers in a circle and spins around in a chair while clicking each one through the Ardougne course. It's xp efficient because it also trains IRL agility.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but I believe around your combat level you could do barrows and maybe some giant mole as well. GWD would just depend on if you plan on doing solo bosses or group. If you plan on doing solo then I personally wouldn’t start until 90+ combat stats. You could do zil with 90+ range and 70+ defense kiting her. People usually start zulrah with at least 85 range and magic. The I’ve only ever seen max players do raids lol
---
What do you do while training? Netflix? Podcasts?
---
Any recommendations?

Finally, a wild revival update that makes sense
---
It doesnt?
---
Talk to Oziach in Edgeville.
---
imagine how fragile your sense of masculinity and self worth is to try and do that
---
At level 81 you can solo some wilderness bosses, and you could try zulrah if you have a decent magic level
---
I suggest that you stick with slayer for now to make gp and as your melee stats all reach 75 you can try to look for teams to do bandos
---
And what’s the problem with that?
---
You might be on to something...

What's your favorite skill?

You used to take a dry erase marker and actually mark your screen before screen marking was an app lol

I like your idea but I think it should be a bit more specific so that you don’t end up confused over what’s stored where etc.
---
If we had a new option on the banker for collecting items that are untradeable or quest items. Main reason we don’t dump them is maybe one day we will need it.
---
Also it would help to be able to “sort” out banks items by value and then empty out the trash - even a feature such as delete all items that can be bought worth less than X.

&gt; The Mount Karuulm Slayer dungeon is single-way combat throughout and includes a task only area. Cannons are allowed in the entire dungeon, aside from a separate chamber where the Alchemical Hydra can be found (see "Alchemical Hydra" below for more information). In order to stay inside the Karuulm Slayer Dungeon safely you will need to wear Boots of stone, Boots of brimstone or **Granite boots**, else you'll take consistent damage until you do.

Me thinking you're retarded isn't "false" because it is an opinion. You dope.
---
Not new, and I disagree.  EoC and free trade limits were what caused mass quitting and rs *riots*, not graphics updates and Summoning.
---
Those updates came *after* things already went to shit and the playerbase was dropping like flies, and I feel it's incorrect to compare Eoc/trade with something like a skill and graphics updates.  
---
Could just be me, but I remember things *very* differently.
---
This is deliberate - to avoid door-close trolling.
---
It would be much longer than the 3 4 hours that dumbass claimed. Absolutely nothing comes anywhere close to daets xp per hour, and a 10m total xp dude does NOT have the funds for that.

I don't know tbh, I feel like it's just really chill to train plus the fact that ardy rooftop is really easy to stay at "high" xp rates. other than that I've liked the skill pre-eoc too, even tho I didn't get 99 back then, I guess I'm just weird and enjoy clicking in circles lol.
---
I find them fun to do and not too challenging or long with cannon and BP. I just did a task of 140 and profited somewhere around 400k I think? Regular drops aren't bad (rune items, lots of death/chaos runes, ranarr seeds, etc.) They even sometimes drop food for you to extend trips. 
---
Aside from those items, there is still tons of items that they have that can be alched or dropped. Ive seen lots of high level ironmen who collect addy items and mithril items....all that can be alched. Most quest items can be dropped once quest is done. Most keys are useless. They keep every tier of arrows, darts, etc. There is plenty of things they can do to make bank space apart from clue items but instead of cleaning bank they would rather complain for more bank space.
---
Zaros... I need you 😭
---
Combat bracelet though
---
Mlm rocks use the pet rock model iirc, so they get hats. A lot of pets don't get hats because of design restrictions (poly count).
---
How many agility levels are you using? Also most people do this pre-80 if that’s the method you’re using
---
Also now with collection log, they can just drop that shit and just show collection log that they got the items lol
---
It’s the hcim version of jebrim 
---
im gonna record it now.
---
Another important thing: dessous is so weak to magic, that you don't need to wear magic armor. You can wear full rune to have all that defense and still get hits using magic.

Teaks is 80-90k an hour @ lvl 90 and up semi afk just drop logs and make sure you are woodcutting as the trees disappear often. Redwoods is 58-63k an hour afk. Up to you

You get up to 10% more xp at Slayer tower than in catacombs. Better to get more xp than get a totem in my opinion and I only really use shards for sire/zammy so I am not very worried about running out personally.

It's only as monumental as you make it out to be by not following best practices. In the end, SOLID et al principles are ultimately there to ease up code refactoring, since it's always inevitable to some extent. 
---
&gt; involves the system that stores the players' items
---
So what? Different environments exist for a reason. You code against development environment, QA test it against (usually) close replica of the real thing in testing environment, and only when you're sure it's all good you deploy it to the production environment.

How do you get scammed with 13 years of experience under your belt.
---
Yea man, but you are forgetting that this is Jagex logic :)
---
Your range/2h account build will work in f2p, however if you want a similar combo in p2p you'll want to get 50 attack for the range/gmaul. If you want to do the 1tick be within 2-3 spaces of your target then switch to the gmaul double click the spec bar thrn click on your target. It will take you a bit to get the exact mechanics down but when you do it will open up a lot more for you.

It's hard for me as a new player because I don't understand most of these storage options. For instance I only use the tool leprechaun for composts and for a tool that I might have forgotten. It's too convenient to have all my items in one place instead of checking my POH and the confusing wardrobe stuff.

I didn't claim to own the lair, just a little upset on getting crashes with a few kills left, no biggie :) 
---
No I mean how many do you use up when running the course? Certain obstacles reduce agility by a few levels which worsens loot. If you do lots of em it can add up.
---
Thnx
---
Shouldn’t have got lvl 2 m8. 
---
This works for now but even with a totally cleaned bank, my Ironman is at around 730/808. What about the new update? That adds 5~ new items from Hydra alone. Imagine all the farming guild seeds and resources, now introduce the elf quest items and rewards. It's getting dangerously close, you can only tell people to clean their bank for so long.
---
It was already expanded to all quests. 
---
Potions alone make up 150+ spaces. Runes 15, ammo idk 15?, farm supplies is like 30+, etc etc. shit adds up. Im at max bank space and i have zero items i can throw away or else im losing a lot of progress. U can make do with 500 because you do less things. 
---
Shut up, Serene. 
---
cianan get in ts

You give him far too much credit
---
I just wished I remember my account information from 16 years ago.
---
I’m so thankful for the stronghold of security. I made my little cousin write down every security question so the lil dude doesn’t get scammed for his 27k. 
---
Stupid fucking comment. How can you be this oblivious? 
---
No
---
Good
---
There are some insane collectors who crave for that bronze or iron, therefore always having that G.E. offer in.
---
Do 50-99 there but don’t open the crates till you have higher lvl skills 
---
And trolling. People with high pid could spam click to keep doors closed indefinitely
---
Hehe
---
&gt;It's only as monumental as you make it out to be by not following best practices. In the end, SOLID et al principles are ultimately there to ease up code refactoring, since it's always inevitable to some extent. 
---
And how well designed do you think an 18 year old game created by a young team of developers is?
---
&gt;So what? Different environments exist for a reason. You code against development environment, QA test it against (usually) close replica of the real thing in testing environment, and only when you're sure it's all good you deploy it to the production environment. 
---
And that takes lots of time and man power. Because sure you test in QA, but as soon as you're in prod you have basically just exponentially increased your test cases. And with the bank system, any error could be catastrophic to the well being of the game.
---
So for any type of bank system update they will be testing likely for many months and I can bet you they will still be nervous as shit to go live with it
---
That’s rather annoying. 
---
Mod Ash went full fucking beast mode on it and fixed it. What a man.
---
Also this. =)
---
its mostly the last 2 days its really bad cuz a lot of worlds are down for maintenance. 
---
Spotted the newbie!
---
Im making cow hide into hard leather for money, but idk weather i should go to GE or a general store to sell. I already have some for sale at GE but only one hard leather has been sold, and it doesn't seem like its too big on GE anyway.
---
My man, I would strongly suggest you say you would like to see someone. There is nothing wrong with looking after your mental health and lets be real having suicidal thoughts isn't a small issue.
---
As someone who has been cleaned of 1-2b my bank is currently pretty healthy again. Gp comes and goes, don't go to the sand casino if you're not prepared for that.
---
Now I saw you wanted to get into slayer. Believe me when I say you don't need a 300m bank or max gear to do this and you can make a healthy rebuild from it. I make at least 1m each gargoyle task and theres plenty of other tasks that drop plenty of alchables. Try learning Zulrah and Vorkath, they were a huge chunk of my rebuild.
---
That's guys accounts are on almost every world. 
---
Pick Chungi on log
---
Yeah its not as if we want the engine team to do anything for the next year anyway 
---
Thanks professor dipshit. 
---
Did you have a stroke
---
Lol I just read these comments on twitter and switched to reddit and here they are
---
&gt;not to mention wise old man removing all outdated quest items from your bank. 
---
Say what now?
---
Fighter torso is next step
---
I have noticed this a lot
---
Are dks worth doing without noted bones? I always think about doing them but I end up cannoning the lighthouse instead 
---
At work with a cold wishing I was home 🙄
---
Thanks, I always wanted the best melee items for Slayer and I think I'll probably not kill myself and just go nolife RC nats for the next 3-4 months lol...
---
Level 50 in the reward-respective skills. Then hit up the Todt.
---
Superglass make is an option that makes money
---
That logic doesn't follow at all. If we're talking price, the only things that you can point to to present something as losing value are inflation of gold and the price of the item. If you wanted to talk inflation, then yeah, the stuff is worth less, but that is irrelevant to the port. If we're talking gold prices, it's kind of disingenuous for you to look at most of the sets increasing in value and two decreasing and still stand by ports being the issue. If you're gonna talk about Barrows items and their non-gold value in relation to better items, that conversation has nothing to do with ports at all.
---
Even if you still want to talk about stability, instability was present for these sets before ports too, so what exactly is your point?
---
Status bars on Runelite.
---
Not sure what you mean lol
---
Trying to fix this issue by manually banning/muting these accounts is like trying to stop a river by throwing rocks into it. Unless it's an automated system that bans them, you're just wasting resources trying to compete against something that can automatically create new accounts

I was scrolling through 2007scape by top of the month

Awesome thanks for the response! I wasn't sure if it was just me, or the app.

It's not a bug. It's because the cash stack can't past max. Is it bad implementation? Sure. But not a bug.
---
We all have that junk tab. you know? Look through that.

Thanks, i hate it

I had 30% supplies left and died on Jad on my first attempt because I was too slow at flicking I'm gonna cry.

Hey, I know this might sound but since I you didn't even know who I am

Fair enough. Just bring a couple regular antiposon in that case. I'm not an ironman, but is there any mobs that drop like a (1) of antivenom at all? 
---
Nice.
---
Ye people that are buying these items are likely hoarders.
---
Kudos on the pink jumper btw. 10/10
---
To make sure you don't forget anything....really? You can't go down a list buying stuff from the GE and pulling stuff out of the bank without a checklist lmao?  How am I braindead because I can remember the last thing I bought in the GE? You have to be baiting.  
---
I know right? Idk if anyone else has noticed but it has seemed like to me that there were virtually no gambling bots a month ago and then all of a sudden there is one in like every world...
---
You seem to have this autistic obsession with having a 1B bank.  
---
It's virtual money, and given your habits you'd probably just blow it all at the sand casino.  
---
Shut the fuck up. Get a job.
---
If you're still having bank issues after the Wise Old Man update you're just bad at managing your bank. Ironmen have construction and stashes to help save space, and on top of that i'm pretty sure Jagex said they'd introduce a few more bankslots in the kebos update. 1000 sounds a tad too much
---
You wouldn’t be able to play on your old account anyway because osrs was released in 2013, everyone starting from scratch
---
More like ring of dirty pussy
---
I mean, are they really that wrong?
---
I did all the shit with minimum for bp and some decent cmb. It's like jad. Easy as all fuck unless you panic.
---
..You need 150 slots for potions? There are only like 40 makeable potions in-game, and *maybe* ten of them useful for top-level players.
---
Like, do you have separate slots for Attack Potions with 1, 2, and 3 doses or something?

Actually a 2m loss

This is just objectively wrong, by default members in RS3 have 771 by Default. And if you buy all the expansions (very bullshit by the way), you can have up to 1271 spaces.

Yes. But all your profit is rng based some trips make nothing some trips make 10m.

a bunch of old, rich bureaucrats can send a bunch of young men to die so they can make more money. Propaganda is working well tho since a lot of people are choosing to join the military 😂
---
I'm for it. Not planning to get a quest cape anytime soon anyways.
---
Apart from the fact that it's rather slow, it's a pretty nice skill. No items required, fairly slow clicks, very regular, perfect for watching a film or show.
---
If you don't mind the fact that it's slow, I can imagine it's really fun to train!

damage in osrs is just all individual rolls. loot = whoever has majority.

So close yet so far

I was just guessing, but 700 is still way to fuckin low :/ I don't have any of the expos tho ty for fact checking

Could just be me, and I haven't bossed in the last 2 days, but I haven't found it any more or less hard to find a world for KBD compared to before mobile released.  GWD could be different, but considering how popular KBD is I doubt it.
---
And yes, I do feel like not changing PvM and therefor the market *is* worth it.  
---
You’ve never served so you have no idea what good being in the military can bring. And 97% of the military is non combat jobs. Thanks for showing your ignorance though

sounds interesting, i would never do it but im sure alot of people would hate it

Yeah, even Sire was packed a few days ago which is normally quite empty.

Working with the API would be a much better programming exercise anyway.

I don't think new content should be designed with various account restriction sets in mind. If you limit your account, it is your own choice, it doesn't mean that all new content needs to conform around that. If changes to existing content were being made then possibly I'd agree (would depend on what the change would be)

See this is what I mean when I say you can make space. If you're taking up hundreds of spots with the same potion, that's just bad organization on your part.
---
A lot of Ironmen have uncompleted clue sets that take up spots. I'm stuck using a looting bag for some pieces... 
---
You're such a fucking retard its insane. Even a 5 year old kid would be able to understand it can be useful. Alch yourself idiot.
---
Quite frankly what an individual JMod says on this subject is irrelevant, Jagex's official statement is that account sharing is in fact against the rules. If it isn't, then they should update the rules.
---
The statement you are referring to is outdated. I am not sure why you even brought it up, as you gave two examples where Jagex does take action. JMods have also confirmed that people got punished for it.
---
&gt; The two don't necessarily go hand in hand. 
---
Obviously not, as you can get hacked without ever sharing your account. 
---
The point is that by sharing your account details, you're willfully compromising the security of your account. The irony is that the community appears to find this perfectly fine and acceptable, while also blaming Jagex for their poor account security system.
---
The Customer Support Managers, Mod Infinity &amp; Mod SteveW, made a bunch of excellent threads and comments on this subject. In those posts they really explain in dept their what their (read: Jagex) stance on this matter is and how they enforce the account sharing rule.
---
I do encourage people to read them, so for convenience I suggest these two posts:
---
* [Accounts Stolen: The Inside Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/4m0nno/accounts_stolen_the_inside_story/)
---
* [Lifting The Lid: Account Ownership](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6hhjy7/lifting_the_lid_account_ownership/)
---
(Note that they're both consistent with being against account sharing.)
---
For the record: I am absolutely in favor of better and more security features, as yes there are flaws with Jagex's current system. 
---
theres a global increase in herb yield and i think another patch.
---
so profit per run wont change all that much, youll just pay more for seeds and get more herbs.
---
It's youtube, not twitch, so no unfortunately 
---
Well the military and marriage could be a mistake, depends on the lens you view it through. 
---
Thank you for the wonderful advice :) I'll take that into account, I don't think I can entirely afford rigour atm without selling off other gear. Although I can and might save up to it :/ and yeah I'll avoid mm2 as you say :D slayer should cover me fine and I'll probs put the money gained towards rigour. Con seems like it's gonna be heavily expensive too hmm lol I'll need to think this over
---
Any quest that has multiple cutscenes makes me want to kill myself

One of those wankers that wears the iron man armour around the game to let everyone know.

Didn’t watch it till now but yeah, that video is correct. He only has ahk remapping key presses which is completely legal as outlined in the official jagex stance he showed in the beginning

---
Currently very sick and this sent me into a laughing/coughing fit thanks.
---
So then why are you so upset..I dont think you actually took a 2 year break if you decided to stake after 2 years, lost it all but now youre depressed over it? That doesnt make sense. You really need to go back to school or find a job though man. Being depressed over runescape is not healthy. At all. Im a huge weeb/gamer nerd myself but come on bro, thats pretty sad. A game you havent played in 2 years has you upset enough to kill yourself? I hope you realize how absurd that sounds..

if nobody replies here there are clans that recruit on the official forums, many streamers and youtubers have casual clan chats, there are open ccs like deliveritems, ironman cc, etc

RS3 has some amazingly well-designed content, and a lot of the OSRS community's favorite updates have been adapted from RS3. I pray that RS3's dissasembling makes it to OSRS in some form, Warding or otherwise. The dissasembling aspect of Invention is one of the best updates to ever be introduced to either game.
---
A lot of people hate RS3 because hatred is easy and comfortable. It feels good to come together as a group over the hatred of something else. It's true in real life and it's true on the internet. Hating something and seeing the world in black-and-white is easier than actually thinking and forming your own opinion and looking into the grey-area that makes up the majority of the world. It doesn't help that RS3's MTX saturation is readily apparent as soon as you log in, though.

In previous threads I've challenged people to show me a bank without junk to justify adding more bankspace. So far no one managed to show me one and convince me otherwise. 
---
Most people are just hoarders wanting to keep their random assortment of items, they'll never use or want to keep as a placeholder. Adding more bankspace wont help for them, as they'll just find more junk to collect. I am almost willing to bet that if Jagex gives them unlimited bankspace, they'll still complain. 
---
If you live by others it could be wireless interference. A good way to test that is to download a Wifi analyzer app. It'll show what channel your WiFi is using and all the networks around you. Channels 1,6, and 11 are the only channels non overlapping channels, but it's very possible someone thinks they're being smart and avoiding interference by switching to a different channel that still overlaps with yours.
---
5Ghz has 23 channels that do not overlap. Use a 5Ghz network if you can.

I had 60 agility and underground pass was pretty straight forward. Only failed a couple things. Regicide was also not bad. MEP1 also bit bad.MEP2 kinda sucked balls due to one specific grapple portion with an incredibly high fail rate. I’d say get 60 agility before underground pas for minimum annoyance and you can ride it out for the whole elf quest line.

This works in the vast majority of cases, especially if you aren't a public figure. Social engineering and using the recovery system to get into the victims acc does unfortunately still happen however. But it's incredibly rare if you're staying on the safe side by having every single secure mesure in place.
---
I do have a gambling addiction but it's just I get mad and tempted to kill myself everytime I lose a stake let alone a double your bank or cleaned stake. But I'm over it now. Starting to make GP again with RC. Thanks for your non-hostile opinions, though. Appreciate it.

military is not just war (atleast in my country). the military has units to support the general public in case of floddings, earthquakes etc. A friend of mine was rebuilding collapsed bridges, bringing food and medicine to towns cut off and they often work to secure cliffs which have a high chance or falling rocks or small avalanches. there are probably a lot more things that i'm missing, as i've done civil service myself.

No its where the lizardmen are at. By the battlefield with the fire and blockades around. Up top you climb down a rope to get to it, theres a dig spot for a hard clue there.

---
I bet you think that this Farm_Master_Flex guy is a dunce who can barely speak English since he typed "poles" instead of "polls." I'm here to tell you that's not the case. Although he could have easily referenced the regular content polls by instead typing "polls" in that sentence, this shrewd poster employed all of his wit and cunning into making a more complex and interesting reference.
---
In a race, the "pole position" refers to the starting position on the inside of the first row. As you can imagine, this is the most desirable position to be in. To determine who gets the coveted pole position, typically there will be some form of qualifier. The competitor with the highest rank according to the qualification rules is the one which is allowed to start in the pole positon.
---
In the fast paced world of RuneScape content, you can think of these qualifiers as being analogous to this forum. Ideas are bandied about, competing for upvotes. The top finishers are given positions in future content polls. Therein lies this clever pun. A position on the content polls (a "poll position") is the equivalent of achieving a high rank in the qualifiers of a race, thus earning the coveted pole position in the main event!
---
In the above post, where the poster suggested that this idea was good enough to "skip the poles," I believe this is what he was getting at. This idea is so good, it doesn't need to care about the pole position at all. Even if it started in last place in the race, it would still win. We ought to just stop pussyfooting around and hand it the trophy now.
---
this but unironically
---
Same thing happened to me a few months after DS2, but I've just gotten back into it about a week ago. The want does come back.
---
*Block user*
---
Yup, instead of bringing the super combat and all the melee switches, bring more food. Then instead of an unreliable spec melee spec that may or may not hit, you can just use the blowpipe spec which will end up giving you even more sustain.
---
This has been an issue for pretty much over a decade. Seems impossible to stop from a long term's perspective, unless they dedicate resources to eradicating these sort of accounts rapidly. Probably not prioritized or deemed as too much of an issue.

Thanks a lot, one last question tho - before I do all the quests, what would you say is the best, rather afkable, way to get def and atk xp?

Good luck him.

Hope he enjoys the game and stays and doesn't leave because people bitch about what gear they use 
---
It's OK, you learnt an expensive lesson which everyone has experienced before. Part of osrs
---
Um yeah when a fantasy mmo that's doing just fine making its own identity decides "whoop, let's introduce hotbar abilities and combat rotations and taunt mechanics and create multi-phase bosses some requiring a (get this) RAID team to take down" its an obvious similarity. 
---
Or how they add transmog (sorry, appearances)
---
And achievements, titles, shit ton of new pets all around the same time frame.
---
But you're right, this was clearly a coincidental, natural progression of RuneScape's lifespan and not a knee-jerk reaction from Jagex to imitate the world's most successful MMO when their company was on the decline and switched investors.

It's 303.5 xp per log. Depending on how much non-decimal XP you'll have after the drop, the XP will change visually.
---
Shit the fuck up, Serene. 
---
If 304 pops up every other log then it's probably 303.5xp per action, from my understanding the amount of xp isnt always a round number so the xp tracker has to play catchup sometimes

Decimals aren’t displayed in xp drops. So you’re getting 303.8 xp per magic log burnt but it displays as 303/304 and splits the xp every other log. 
---
That's literally not at all how sarcasm works

He isn't even connected to the plague series...

only ranged and magic for combat stats

As someone who just finished a 2 month grind of vorkath today, I find this top tier content
---
F for respects 
---
It could mean she's got money though right?
---
Get a fighter torso. I think it's very similar defense to a rune platebody but adds a strength bonus
---
Do RFD for barrows gloves. Until then use a combat bracelet.
---
At 60 defense you can use dragon and obsidian. Obsidian has awful defense but gives a strength bonuses. Dragon offers no offensive bonus but much better defenses. Dragon boots do offer a strength bonus though. I think Rune boots do as well.
---
At 70 you can use Barrows which is awesome defense but no offensive bonus (Except a full Dharoks or Veracs set).
---
At 130 attack + strength you can get Defenders from the Warrior's Guild which are offensive offhands. They add accuracy and strength bonus.
---
It's the small things that make the rs community so friendly

I feel like 1 Small Favor was built around a day at Jagex HQ....

"Hey can you take a look at this model for the upcoming Kebos lowlands?"
---
"Yeah sure, but first I need you to talk to Jake at Varrock State Farm and ask for the money he owes Joe"
---
"Hey Jake, I need the money you owe Joe"
---
"Oh sure, but before you get that money I need you to get the money back from that evil chicken that took it from me, but watch out it attacks with magic!"
---
I just harass the shit out of people who pay into them. Constantly laugh and taunt when they continue to food 200, 300, 500k into the bots. 
---
It can go 1 of 2 ways...She either got the dope cash or she blew the cash on RS3.

Pick your poison ma dude!

You could at least have plenty of pmods so they can mute them the second they start spewing their ads

The rules are literally on the right side of the screen.

"Rule No. 5. No accusing players of wrongdoing"

Let the poor kid play how he wants to play, it's not hurting your gameplay at all.
---
huh, that's pretty neat I can come back to it and finish it off! I thought I had to do it in go. Good to know, thanks! 
---
u jelly
---
Room to improve this piece of art :)
---
I would have agreed with you, but then I did underground pass. Then I heard mournings end part 2 is even worse. 
---
Head on 9 kc, nice. Still convinced they're more common than whips.
---
If you haven't done the waterfall quest that gives a good chunk of atk exp. I'm not sure for defence if there are quests that will give you a ton.  Monkey madness will award you some though.  You could also train your def when farming for your defender on the cyclops in the warriors guild.  If you wanna straight afk it though I think sand crabs would be your best bet but it can be hard to find a spot.  Or you can do some low level slayer since it looks like you haven't done slayer before
---
Please don't discourage Serene from making relevant comments.
---
Alchemise yourself with a quickness, SickFez.
---
They're nothing a like, how can you even refute that when you've literally just admitted you've never done rs3 bosses. You're admitting you know nothing about it yet you expect people to take you seriously? 
---
I've played literally thousands of hours of rs3 pvm and hundreds of wow. They're nothing alike. Diablo 3 is closer to a clone of wow than rs3
---
Definitely sounds like a non bias point of view, thanks!
---
Haha $11 what is this meme??

You can tell Mod Ash is a smart man with a good head on his shoulders for being uninterested in 2-D cartoon porn

You replied to my reply, i knew you would kiddo, relax yourself you kiddo, kid
---
Unfortunately getting hacked means you messed up at some point.
---
The only time that isn't the case is when a Jmod goes rogue.
---
Hard to comment when you haven’t done it. An outsider’s perspective only goes so far
---
Just when i think this sub cant get better, here comes the impractical joker memes
---
Just build lol
---
Well only pures take ZGS in chambers of xeric, because other players just pick barrage.
---
So i disagree,
---
I was thinking of a sort of poision effect on the ZGS like the zamorak boss can do himself.
---
This way it is a better pk weapon and aligns with the AGS.
---
Gold sink. It consumes the scroll. 
---
Imagine wasting logs on firemaking when WT exists 
---
Thanks, I'm currently RCing to 300-400m and vow not to stake again. Cheers.
---
Have you done an AMA?
---
Cuz ur a normie
---
You probably got the xp drop and didn't notice. 
---
You may have even selected a different skill than the one you thought. 
---
Also if you were level 1 runecrafting it would have only given you 15 xp, which is not enough for level 2. 
---
If you still think it is a bug then you can right click the report button at the bottom of the game window and submit a report. 
---
So you just listed out most of the main farming supplies and teleports yet you aren't even close to having an argument that 800 is to little.
---
type this in on your cmd window
---
ipconfig /flushdns
---
Lol how? My bank is never above like 400 items unless I’ve saved up a huge loot tab then it’s maybe 450
---
No spaces, five letters, shouldn't be profanity filtered (very similar to my reddit name)

Scrumptious

You like bread?

---
no man i live by myself in a student apartment , could someone mess with my ip if it's static and block websites ? 
---
Maybe you were using Quick-Prayer and had the wrong one setup?
---
If his account sucks, I'm curious about yours, please post it up.

You can always get her on the right side

i have watched it, alot. Didnt get past wave 34 today(even tho pb was 54 yesterday). I think i watch potupson-s full inferno run before going to sleep and and continue tomorrow.
---
The only thing im confused about is dropping extra fruit on the ground? Each bone takes up one inven slot and so does each fruit. How would you have extra?
---
Literally none apparently
---
we dont do this here, Just bring us a sexy sandwhich lady and we will be pleased
---
Jail guards are just high level highwaymen, change my mind.
---
Thank you for all the replies everyone! Makes a lot of sense now lol

---
Nice ely 
---

---
Buy steel bars, make cannonballs 
---
Gz but could have potted atk to 69, brew str to 69 and ancient mace pray to 69 :\
---
Yeah, Neive does have a nice Ely
---
Not the worst, probably should mention I got 99 in all cmb skills except prayer (77)
---
This is high quality you noob
---
kk sorry if i came off rude just seems highly unlikely you can get that without rigour even if you have rune darts
---
This would be worth more cut.
---
Such is the cost of crafting xp
---
What
---
If they just let us store parts of sets it would solve this issue
---
