I've never gotten void before so no, I'm not fully aware of the effects.

That's what I was thinking lmao
---
There are clans that have their own calenders with events and social events to join. Definitely look up some clans and join their discord and start getting involved in their community. Keep looking around until you find one you can enjoy because it'll make a huge difference when playing the game!
---
I stand in a corner and semi-afk and switch corners every now and then. Could you show me where you're standing?

nah, you’re the pathetic loser who’s deflecting his insecurities on the internet.

I’m only 22 and I make $24 an hour, nice try bum.

meanwhile, you’re a sad fuck who probably lives on government paychecks, faking a disability. if we’re not considering severe autism a disability, that is.
---
Lol ok. Thanks, Jinxa!
---
I’ve been trying but i can’t find a link to the actual API webpage. As it is right now, i have absolutely no idea where to get the API data.
---
Some fire spits, good shit
---
My wife always makes dolphins on her take-home boxes, so I had her draw a crab on mine :)
---
I will have everything there except rigour.
---
If only Runelite would ever release any API data
---
I disagree. There's no need to panic if there's minimal risk to die. Also, cause we're exaggerating anyway: someone like a firefighter literally risks his life as a job and he's expected not to panic. If you put it into perspective like that staying alive on what looks like a mid level hcim doesn't seem that difficult. Of course I personally don't play a hcim so I can't speak for OP but I think anyone with tanking experience who's fully focussed would be very nervous, but not panicking.

Sorry for the fucking paragraph, I should probably go to bed but I hope it made sense lol

How is that any more real than gambling on table top games like the ones in actual casinos? You read the stuff you write online before pressing send lol?

What did it originally say?

literally unplayable

---
That's crap.
---
Yes, but when you don't skip the fire phase then you have plenty of down time to eat. Its not even that common to skip the fire phase unless you have a Tbow.
---
Yeah. And then you open a door and have to click through it without clicking on the door spot to walk through. 
---
It’s so fun closing the door in your own face. Or slamming the camera into the building to temporarily make the roof go away.
---
You all are right. I was just being a whiny biznitch cause I didn't want my first 99 to be Firemaking. Just have to weight the importance of tome of fire vs another 99.

The actual interesting part about the tournament is seeing clan vs clan fights during the week.

But unless you see some 30sec twitter video on a random 20 follower account you probably wont ever see any of that action
---
I have extracted all character bigrams and trigrams from the GE items, bigrams are every two subsequent characters in a string and trigrams three (e.g bucket: bu uc ck ke et, buc uck cke ket) and do the same for the search query. Then just count the number of bigrams/trigrams that occur in both the query and in the item and sort all GE items based on this count. This is of course a very simple model and could be extended to be much more complicated, but this already gives quite good results. Sorting on total count it has a bias towards long item names, which can be taken into account. Complete word matches can be taken into account. Items that do not match to a certain degree can be left out (instead of giving all items in a sorted list), etc.
---
Granted, but it exists solely in my fantasy

This is like when you pay the hooker to do some freaky stuff.

 Never give up, never surrender!

Not gonna lie, that was pretty close

Pretty well done

Lmao you got smited so many times and they caught every freeze because your Mage level was so low.

I made 7 accounts just to downvote you take that L

I would suck dick for this

I suppose that may be true. I've only done t bow hydra so even when you don't skip you can keep dpsing it

Sad tbh

and click "no" for both questions. Then the "maybe we can help".
---
Ahahahahahahah holy fuck
---
They are going to be changing the way it works, so this is the last DMM with these rules.
---
Just sayin, you wouldn't be eating on the fire phase if you skipped it
---
Lol, that’s not a Runescape meme. Politics don’t belong in the sub regardless.
---
Also one of the pkers runs off when he's still in multi.
---
If the meme featured Trump I'd still think it was funny. Not everyone comes to reddit to argue about politics my dude
---
alright thanks
---
Very clever catch, seems like a slight oversight on OSRS team when coding the UIM QoL update. This is also further indication as well that WT loot is rolled at the time of opening and NOT at the time of earning the crate which is something people still seem to argue from time to time. Hopefully the fix for this is a “fixed” roll the first attempt at opening the crate and not a blanket fix of giving all crates from WT fixed loot upon completion of the boss, saving those crates can have pretty decent early btw benefits.

The comment you replied to already answers this.

Your proposed changes will make the Hunter Guild essentially Wintertodt for hunter training. For that kind of reward, I think it's worth having to catch a few salamanders. Maybe just make it 50, like WT.

Nah I’m quitting, games pissed me off to much and I’m just not having fun playing anymore kinda feels like I’m forcing my self to play lol.

Oh yeah void I totally forgot about that, no blowpipe just because I don’t want to have to spend a lot of money on scales

Rune crossbow is fine, dragon is only +4 over it. Twisted buckler is decent for less than 6m since it is +18.

Pegs and anguish over armadyl just use blessed dhide get assembler if you dont have it and use msbs (i) with rune arrows if you dont want to use blow pipe

Like a karambwan poison, but for bolts? Could be neat, but risks stepping on emerald bolts

Yes you're wrong. Manked was all but done for when the guy threw the fight. was down 4-0 on sharks. And we know it was on purpose because he literally stopped attacking in robes and let himself die

10x airs, 8x minds, 6x waters, 3x body, 2x law, 2x death. Runecraft actually has quite a bit of 90-99 content.

If you do slayer or something you can make a lot of that money back, and in NMZ herb boxes help with the price too. It really speeds things up

Did you follow one of those "search xxx on youtube an get free 200m" on youtube?

I'm more curious about that line 👀

Probably ogress warriors by Corsair Cove.

If you wanna fight Elvarg straight up I’d recommend 40+ in each combat stat for rune equipment. There is a flinch method that you can theoretically use to kill Elvarg at any combat level though.

If blowpiping, learn to wooxwalk once you have every other mechanic down. It's tricky at first and you'll always die occasionally from a slip up or lag. But for me, it reduces the stress of Vorkath considerably because you don't have to be constantly scouting for a clear path in poison phase. Just find 2 safe spots and click them. It also speeds up kills considerably.
---
Here's some tips for that:
---
1) Use the lowest ping world you can. I find 40ms to be fine for wooxwalking and 100+ to be significantly more annoying. I couldn't do it at all til I tried a low ping world. Runelite world switcher displays pings if you have the option turned on.
---
2) Use sounds to learn the timing. Vorkath's fireballs fire every tick, and makes a sound. It's a metronome. 
---
3) Start by placing Runelite tile markers in a line (perpendicular to the line of fire from you to Vorkath) at precisely the maximum range of the blowpipe on rapid. So standing on this line you can shoot, but if you stand behind it you'll step forward to shoot. This is the central mechanic which allows wooxwalking with human reflexes. The tile markers make it easier to learn.
---
4) Keep run OFF at all times til you're comfortable enough to decidenotherwise.
---
5) Always stand on the max distance line during non-poison phase. 
---
6) When poison starts, walk 2 tiles away (you can add more tile markers if it helps) and click Vorkath as soon as you hear the second fireball sound. Click 2 tiles away again as soon as you hear the blowpipe sound. You will be clicking away before your character model reaches its destination. Your character's actual position is always slightly ahead of the model.
---
When you're fully comfortable with this timing, you'll only need to walk 1 tile away, click vorkath, click away, etc., and that timing will be again based on the sounds until you have a strong internal metronome.
---
7) I think there's always a poison splat on the spot you are standing in when the poison starts. So it's good to walk one step away from your current position before starting the above routine. You may need to walk a little bit to find a suitable place to wooxwalk.
---
8) At first, if your health allows it, don't mind walking through poison splats to get to a safe line. Their damage is VASTLY smaller than the fireballs, so you should never stop moving.
---
Why do you play with roofs on?

Personally, I've tried both with justiciar but my preference is DFS. I'm pretty engaged while grinding Rune Dragons as well and try to avoid the lightning attacks as much as possible just to make it more fun on my end. I like the idea of not having to pot up as much with DFS set up. But to each, their own.

I’m trying to decide if I should drop my master clue. I’m thinking I should keep it, my levels are mostly 50s with a few 70s and one 43 (rc). I’ve gotten six steps done and this last one needs me to go to the sarodomin area in the gods war area which needs 70 agility. Im at 60 right now but I HATE agility.  I’ve been doing a couple laps here and there but it seems to be slow. I’m thinking I’ll keep it, as I’ll probably not be able to any steps on the next one I got, just wanted your ideas.  Thanks.

Ahaha thanks for trying, not the end of the world. I think I remember runescape having a login location tracker last time I played, wish that was still a thing...

Please do and feel free to let another staff member or I know if you have any questions or if we can help you with anything!

It's okay she replied.

This is good but not complete advice. Bear in mind sharks heal 20hp. If you sit at 33hp and get hit for 32, then eat a shark, you'll only be at 21hp and it's not a long shot that you'll die.
---
If you want to be very safe, you should eat ASAP below 13hp, else you could get unlucky and die with no way to save yourself. Between 13 and 32, eat if you see a ranged attack. 
---
If you want to be really safe, bump up that 32 to a 45. At 45, you can get hit for 32 and you'll be back up to 33 by the next hit. There's not a big difference DPS-wise between eating below 33 vs eating below 45, but you get 1 more max hit's worth of protection.

I’m sure he’s called her worse for less

Some of you guys are literally cancer. Keep driving people away and this discord won't exist for much longer. I'm thankful for all the friends I've made on this discord but honestly, some of you can just fuck right off and TBH I would have kicked you all off LONGGGGGG time ago for some of the rude and insensitive comments you have made towards some other people in this discord. We try to keep it civil in here but  a lot of you love to incite drama and honestly it's frustrating to deal with, especially when it's the exact same people over and over again doing it. You guys don't deserve a discord like this. It's a privilege to be here, but all you guys do is complain and complain. There's a reason there's no more race bot. There's a reason why you've driven so many people away. Why don't guys try to appreciate what you have here? You know what, why don't you all become mods? Then you'll see how truly annoying it is to deal with people. Anyway, I'm done with this shit. Peace

Imagine wanting to make the most out of your limited free time. Runescape is way too much of a time sink to figure everything out on your own if you want to get anywhere in a reasonable period of time. This isn't a 10 hour game you don't want spoilers for. It's an infinite gameplay time game. Use your brain.

Is it normal for an account made on mobile (NOT with game center, regular login email) to have no progress and be back on tutorial island when logging in on PC? I made my account on PC and have had no issues with my account's progress syncing, but my girlfriend started out on mobile and she's back on tut island when she tries to log in on the PC client. We've confirmed she isn't signing into the wrong account, since she only has one anyways.

Was involved in bug abuse to gain heaps of gold and sold it. I believe he also knew a lot about what some of the bug abusers were doing, and did nothing to stop or report it because they were friends.

Some say he intentionally made the bug, but those he abused it with say he didn't. Also I'm pretty sure Ash also tweeted that he didn't.

Jagex statement was that he was fired for "misuse of jmod privileges".

Outside of that though, he was always turning into jad in game and having fun with the players back when osrs was new.

I'd say not, but if you have experience with RS and interested in grinding you should be alright

The game is objectively easy, bar some late game bossing and raids, but you just need to come up with goals in the game on your own since there isn't much direction. Players mostly lose interest since there isn't something telling them what to do at all times like most games.

Lance + BIS melee gear is hardly cheaper (in startup costs) than dhcb. If you skip the dragonfire ward and pegs they might be about equal. You can use scuffed melee gear for nearly-as-good performance on a tight budget, but watch your magic attack bonus. Crumble undead can splash around -60, and it's triggering.

Thanks for the reply. I do have full void now, that's one of the main reasons I want to get this Diary done so I can upgrade to Elite haha. I do have Trident and Blowpipe.

IMO, wooxwalking is more mindless than not wooxwalking after a few hundred kc of practice.

Who cares? If someone took the name “B0aty” I would 100% want Jagex to return it to B0aty. Streamers are more important than us stop being so ignorant. They SHOULD care more about streamers than average players. Streamers bring in viewers and advertise the game on Twitch/YouTube for Jagex. The deserve special treatment.
---
Stop.
---
3-5% better than the previous tier, not 50-75% better like Blowpipe, Trident, Scythe, Prims, Twisted Bow.
---
Blowpipe and Twisted are the biggest problem items and seriously need a nerf regardless of how much of an impact it has on their value. They harm the games power flow and hinder future items from being well designed.

Why have fucking 1v1s then if it's clan based

That's not the point.  The original comment was essentially "If you have the requirements for this quest, you probably have the requirements for this one too," which I was refuting.  Whether or not people can grind to those levels (which of course they can) is irrelevant.

I love how all these replies are so toxic. I didn't just run up to Lumbridge and ask to swap, they were advertising at the G.E. - I guess toxicity is rampant in this sub for people like you because you literally play this game all day. ;-)

This is true. Why are you even getting mass-downvoted, lol.

Bernie Sanders a presidential candidate, (ran last election and was popular but got screwed out of his spot for the Democratic party) has started playing games on twitch as part of his campaign, or just to connect with people on the internet because he sees the platform as a good way to get himself out there a bit more. 
---
He's a rather socialist leaning candidate, and you'll see 1 of 2 views in comments  Either he's a benevolent man who wants to redirect some wealth away from the ultra rich, or Hes a demon who wants to tax everyone for his own personal gain so he can build houses.

&gt;Not really, the original ones were all multi fights at the end and it went fairly well 
---
It was literally just ROT vs. Everyone else running in a circle barraging for an hour until there was like 20 people in the same clan left and it was over.  How are you complaining about clanman mode but thought Multi finale DMMS were good. Multi Finale was peak clanman mode where nobody but clans stood a chance.

Honestly.. Is that the whole point of rev caves? to be contested all the time...

Yeah I love SirPugger. Never saw a video about swapping clans though yet. I wouldn't say it's "exposing", but they did try their hardest to seem professional with fake messages in clan chat that did look believable at first.

They aren't hard, just tedious.

Eh, I paid attention when the game was new. Far as I can see it's still the same shit. Both teams turtle up and play scared until they have their ults, then whichever team stacks Ults first and better wins. Not much to enjoy as a viewer

Using Lord Shayne's defender role guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSur4bZ4qvo), I made a visual guide to make completing the role easier. I watched his video over and over but felt there was too much to remember, so I wrote a couple things down on a notepad (just small notes) and made this image in paint, to quickly look at and use as a reference.
---
I thought I'd upload it here in case it helps anyone else going for the diaries/bits of the barbarian armour.
---
It's not going to make any sense unless you've watched the guide btw. I found that in spot 1, I typically dropped a couple of bad foods to lure the runners back up. Regardless of the wave number, I dropped 4-5 good foods on spot 2, and then the rest of the good food on spot 4, so it was less complicated to remember how many foods I was supposed to drop, just for the sake of forming a habit. 
---
Although spot 1 and spot 5 are optional, I always placed bad food in both spots just to get naughty runners back where I needed them.
---
I'm no expert at all, I'm really not the most efficient at the role, but I found this very helpful to use as I got lvl 5 def in the role.

Ah yes, that definitely makes them sound trustworthy and reliable - Advertising with the Dicebots and Join-my-scamtwitch spammers in a place where literally anyone can make any claims they want.

My dude that's more than fine. I've done dozens of barrows runs with around 60ish stats or so. Just use the Iban staff on literally all the brothers except for Ahrim, use a rune crossbow for him. You'll be fine as long as your gear is tanky.
---
What I generally do is pray melee for Dharok, run over to Kharil and pray ranged, and if there's any prayer left I pray magic for Ahrim. After that it's just a matter of mopping up the last three, easy.

I was thinking the same thing. Then again teams already happen in the game mode. Teaming in real esports of any kind will  dq but its a slippery slope since teams are allowed through out the whole competition. It might be a little weird or even hard to regulate during the final fights.

&gt;     2) Starting tile. Many people start north of the north pillar. You should not do this, and instead start west of the north pillar, on the northmost tile. This way you are protected automatically from the east spawn. If a meleer is approaching, run north and it will be safespotted.
---
After wave 50 you should be starting north of the north pillar because this significantly lowers the odds of getting hit by the ranger on wave start.
---
I've seen more posts of trump, crowder, and shapiro than anything left leaning on this subreddit, I refuse to believe that's because there are people trying to influence others' political beliefs. There are simply more potential applications of Crowder's Change My Mind meme, or BEN SHAPIRO DESTROYS, etc
---
why should it be an individual focus? it's a multiplayer game cooperating with other people is just better and more fun. Look at the GG clan who were all solo players originally who banded themselves together because they didn't have a clan and now they're making it o the top 4. Really don't understand this antisocial mentality of insisting on playing a multiplayer game by yourself

I tried that world hopping double chest thieving method a few times with the high tier ones in there and it wasn't bad until the world hop timer kicked in.  Held a chisel to cut any of the uncuts I received too.

Nice
---
I know this is a meme but to be clear, this is such an inaccurate and unfair way of characterising Bernie’s policies. The creation of wealth is not a zero sum game; rich people generally aren’t stealing from a pie and leaving less behind for everyone else.

You are going to really struggle with this concept but the average rich person does more for society in a year than you will ever do in your life.

Best case scenario, everyone knows their roles and you do 1-3 egg queen kill. ~15 minute run.  
---
Average scenario, you’ve got an okay defender or healer and rounds are somewhat slower. Maybe 5-7 eggs for queen. ~25 minute run.  
---
Worst case scenario, very bad teammates who don’t know their roles. Takes you 40 minutes to get to the queen wave and then someone quits right before wave 10.

Yeah let me bet on people staking.

i just use her for point boosting and see the keys as a nice bonus

That was throwing a league match because they bet on themselves to win stealing money from other people betting as well. If there were people betting on the dmm tourney there MIGHT have been a cause for action, but if the two are just going to split the pot after it doesn't matter who wins.

You can't use NMZ without quests - but it puts you right into Yanille. People that haven't done the right quests completed can just teleport directly there. Granted, you can purchase a duelling ring, teleport to castlewars and run from there, but even then you're foregoing that time wasted running and buying that ring.
---
This is just one example - a teleport like this should at least have Watchtower completion to use

There are castle wars streams, and there are rarely over 20 viewers. There's also a castle wars community and it's incredibly small. DMM was flawed but it was by far the best thing Jagex has ever produced, and the only thing to ever bring OSRS a lot of views on Twitch consistently
---
Guess you didnt watch the stream since it was shown and explained. No drama there.
---
Dont get me wrong. I also really like Priffdinas. And I also get that it doesnt make sense to not have anvils and furnaces together.
---
But it makes sense from a gameplay perspective. Making people explore the world, and also slowing down the grind a bit.
---
Personally, I dont think Runescape was ever really meant to be played the way people play it nowadays (hyper effeciency and only focused on levelling). Its supposed to be an adventure about exploring the world and doing whatever you want. This is also why there are quite alot of players who despise quests I think. "It doesnt further my levels very much, why should I do it unless it has OP rewards which does?"
---
Im trying to see how this is related to OSRS
---
And it has a decent song too
---
if you're under 90 range use rune dart tips, bgs is a higher probability of hitting than dwh against vork. the freeze and the spawn phase are always switching and take place every 6 attacks you can time your prayer to turn it off to conserve during these phases just make sure to renable right after the spawn falls over.make sure to also keep run off unless you're woox walking which is difficult. if you're good aat clicking away fast enough u should be able to walk out of the mortar fire balls in time.
---
Ahh fair. I didn't even pay that much attention to it lol

I'd watch that.

No, there doesnt. This is 2007scape. We already have it easy with rooftop agility and graceful. Enjoy the immersion or play RS3.

5. You're a bootlicker that thinks a system that skims money off the top for profit works better than a non profit system in which we pay for the care to the care provider. Insurance companies are  a massive scam and you're retarded.

---
&gt;You got a study that says we're not in a massive deficit? These tax cuts combined with unfettered capitalism thanks to Trump's deregulation are the recipe for a repeat of the 2008 recession.
---
Nope, just my opinion as someone that actually knows what they are talking about
---
There is nothing wrong with ignorance, but deliberately failing to recognise your own ignorance is pretty gross. Do some actual learning/research before you speak on a topic - that's a good life lesson for just about everything, actually.
---
I'm not lecturing you, let alone talking to you in specific. If you can't handle arguments with substance or without making it personal you should retreat. The marginal rate of 91% was in fact paid, but only by a select few. Apart from that, many reached rates of 70-80%. The high-tax and strong-union were marked by spectacular widely shared economic growth: nothing before or since has in the US matched the doubling of median family income between 1947 and 1973.

grinding is a BIG part of the game. everything is locked behind a requirement, every requirement is locked behind a quest, and every quest is locked behind another requirement. you can play casually, but you will not reach the upper levels of play without investing some serious hours. it has taken me at least 3 months of at least 3 hours every day to get to 105 combat myself (126 is maximum). and i am super far away from getting the best gear, to the point where i don't even want to go for it any more.  
---
in guild wars, which is what i used to play, if you want to PvP, you can make a max level character with the best gear in a few clicks, and jump into pvp right away. not this game. it takes a long, long time to max your account to do high level pvp, if that is what you want to do.
---
it is true that the game has a gimmick where if you have a certain total level of skills (for example, if you have level 60 in all 23 skills, you'd have a total level of 1380) you have access to certain worlds that new players cannot access. there are much fewer botters and trolls on these worlds. on the internet, where people have no name and no face, they start being respectful real quick when they have something to lose. i'm not sure ive seen this gimmick in other games.
---
you can try it and see if you like it. there is a lot of content in the game that does not have high requirements. also, you can do PKing (pvp) in the free-to-play game at low levels. that is a challenge in itself.
---
youtubers are coming up with new ways to play the game every day, and you could find your own way to do it that avoids the grind completely. but that's certainly not how the game is designed.
---
Not sure. If I heard right in the video, that's what Lord Shayne said to do? But maybe I'm dumb and misheard him.
---
Come to think of it, I think there's only 2 runners in wave 1, so yeah, idk why you'd need logs.

&gt;The high-tax and strong-union were marked by spectacular widely shared economic growth: nothing before or since has in the US matched the doubling of median family income between 1947 and 1973.
---
Absolutely none of this had a significant contribution to the economic growth postwar in the US. I've actually written a paper on this very topic. To dumb it down (extremely,) essentially, the US  had thousands of factories that had been pumping out Shermans that could now start pumping out Buicks. 
---
That's a metaphor, but that's essentially what caused the US postwar boom.
---
Two economics degrees aren't a study and don't even work in your favor. The only people who think an economy is capable of infinite growth are economists because they're fucking retarded.
---
Let's also talk about your "TWO" degrees. How's that work? Most colleges won't let you major in something similar to your current degree because getting the second degree would be a joke. Example, I major in computer science. My college won't let me go for a bachelor's in mathematics because I've already done 90% of the course work.
---
The education system in your country must just let you print a degree after taking unproctored tests. If you're not in America your education system is a joke and you can fuck off.

It'd be cool to see Jagex overhaul and improve existing Guilds to be as useful as the Farming Guild, and give incentive for players to train within them by using contracts which seem to be well received based on general opinion of Farming Guild contracts and Slayer Assignments.
---
If this isn't possible however, new Guilds like this one you've suggested will always be a welcome addition for me.

The saddest part is that so much focus is on new content and security is a joke. In the last 5 years it’s been a joke
---
They don't pay they go to jail, same as you and me. It's that easy! 
---
Workplace regulation is done by the department of labor, not the police. Don't conflate the two.
---
I'd still murder to play on that acc. Lots of people bally gmaul even people @ 60/75atk
---
It’s pretty evident whenever someone posts an update request on items like that. Someone made a LENGTHY post showing it was like three or four people with a ton of reddit alt accounts posting and upvoting these suggestions solely to make GP off of. And then they post the same suggestion, Day after day after day after day. This guys 611 Torags hammers are nothing compared to the guys who have 10K+. I think a JMod even checked the bank of one guy who was suggesting an item buff relentlessly and said the guy had over 1bil GP invested in the time hoping for it to be buffed and make 200-500% on them

Only faked miscarriage once
---
im about to do what you call a pro-gamer move
---
Or every 10th task  is good too. Or basically every milestone point bonus task.
---
Hmm.. and who would come to their house, arrest them, and take them to jail?
---
Also, who would come to arrest the business owners who don't comply with DOL regulations?
---
It's police power of the government all the way down friend.
---
Taxes are taken at the point of a gun, even if we have politely masked that gun behind a couple layers of bureaucracy before you see it.  Same with every other regulation that has any actual force.
---
On the Iron i've just started doing Sara GWD, and I was wondering, would it be worth it to bring onyx dragon bolts instead of diamond dragon bolts? I feel the healing might help quite a bit.
---
Im only about a month old to this game. When I am out in the Wilderness I see alot of people with skulls on top of their characters (Skulled). I was wondering how you gey skulled, what are the consequences and how to avoid getting skulled. From my speculation, I think you get skulled when you PK someone.
---
Yeah that definitely got patched like the next day
---
no stop
---
2 tries. It's just really getting all the way up to Jad's wave, then making sure you keep calm and getting the prayers right. When healers come up, just hit them once per healer, then go back to attacking Jad. Right before Jad's wave I brew up to above 99hp, full prayer, sip range pot, and go time!
---
Omg dude youre so great thank you for being so good congratulations
---
Yeah but the problem is you can't use it during slayer so the only real use is NMZ, which makes it a bit niche.
---
Hang on he actually plays games on twitch? I thought he did an interview there or something and that was it.
---
If you're in f2p you really don't even need that much money tbh. There is a pretty hard ceiling to the things you can do with money in f2p. 
---
I suppose if you want to f2p max you could blow it on buyables- prayer, firemaking, crafting etc. But there's not really a "good" way to spend that much money in f2p.
---
I feel if you actively use the items being able to buy them for cheap is very nice but them crashing isn't rly a big deal since you need the items anyways
---
You've claimed that the marginal tax rate of 91% was never paid at least 5 times on this post and haven't provided a source. Your ass is not a credible source. Stop pulling things out of it.
---
Maybe try not being fucked up
---
I didn’t know I wanted hunter themed rugs until now
---
Yeh I feel you, but I find that hards are easier to obtain than meds because most people kill monsters that drop hards and not meds, there’s only a specific amount of time when you kill monsters that drops meds and that flys fast.
---
You get skulled by initiating combat with somebody- attacking them first. Instead of keeping your 3 most valuable items when you die, you no longer keep them and lose everything.
---
then dont typo
---
Make them all ironman and upon death the items they carry would be instantly deleted (no dropping on the floor so they can get it back). People would be killing eachother simply to slow them down, not to get items from it!

I honestly don’t see that dude on that frequently. Didn’t he try to shit on other house owners so people would only use his house?

&gt; Haha I don’t know man WC has helped me get through a lot of shitty movies.

why would you willingly watch shitty movies?

Wintertodt East obviously (who even goes west smh)
---
Fatwrecked style. 
---
Congrats!
---
Even better.
---
The 4 dragon axes though 1/10k :(
---
But spectral, you don’t need hasta just shield switch for ghosts. Bring a looting bag full of supplies and an invent full of supplies and suicide  to have 3 invents worth of food
---
it's halo 2 all over again
---
It depends how the value of GP is derived. In game the buying power of GP shouldn’t have changed more than it normally would in any given time period since the sigils are the only item with a non organic increase in supply but the price of GP from black markets could and probably did decrease from this since the amount of gold available for sale more than likely increased.
---
Oh wow I didn’t know you need 99 to catch those
---
nah thats the moon
---
Take this with a grain of salt, but the strategy guide on the wiki seems to suggest that it's doable with barrows top/bottom and a hasta. I'd give the strategy guide on the wiki a look and see if you can pull a setup that fits your budget from there. I'd imagine the first upgrade you want to focus on would be DHL.
---
It's likely someone has just copied the RS3 for the wardrobe, it's word for word the same. If you look at Ghrims wiki page there's no mention of it, nor does the diary give you that reward is OSRS.
---
Ooooooly cow. I was stressed out and didn’t even realize he was an Ironman 😶
---
You do for barehanded, 92 with a butterfly net which he cant get
---
Be super careful right now or you will get burned easily
---
wishes of good luck and out best mathematician to calculate odds for you are on the way. ETA 1630.
---
Falador for exp at falador farm. Ardy for tps. Fremennik(?) For agility pass (hard).
---
Lol like what you said afkness doesnt have a good correlation with profit. 
---
Melee wyvern is not as afk as ranging them because you have to bank and wyvern do occasionally freeze you which can delay kills and is annoying. If you want afkness i would highly suggest ranging them.
---
You can fight the Evil Chicken over in the Champions Guild btw.
---
Just get the spectral and use a hasta, it's like having a dhcb at vorkath, just so much easier and more chill! I generally use 1-2sharks and 2-3ppot doses per kill and with melee got around 12 kills a trip. 
---
Guthans can also be handy for getting an extra kill per trip whilst using on the crush style. Since cerb has extremely low defence you are bound to hit consistently. 
---
Spectral and practice is the main thing i recommend for now. Once you get that down you can switch gear and weapons to get more kills each time.
---
Gl buddy :)
---
around 45 mil. Next time just google "osrs gp/exp calculator"
---
I'm super unlucky on keys and have come to conclusion the huge xp losses aren't worth the small gp gain from doing konar.
---
Sorry, babe, but the roofs stay ON during sex.

Help a black man out, this could change my whole status quo, my family’s life and my chirren
---
Wasn’t this posted earlier?
---
Keep at it, man. I got vorki way under drop rate. I am sending to telepathic RNG favor
---
Every time I look in /r/2007/new I see one of your stupid threads. You post them every 10 minutes, delete them and repost it
---
The question is, why do you care so much? Whatever your agenda is, stop pushing it. It will never come back. It is impossible to come back.
---
If you're looking to afk, Dharok's isn't ideal, since you'll lose dps as your hp goes back up. Torture would be a good upgrade. After that, I'd get ferocious gloves.
---
Isnt scorpia boi deef af but people still do that
---
Isnt chaos elemental boi deep af but people still do that
---
Ahhh okay
---
Sure, here's help: Avoid Wintertodt. It's inefficient, boring, and a waste of time. Apply opportunity cost.
---
Bear boi is hella deep. No escaping if you get caught trying to slay the bear boi
---
That used to be loot from like 8 konar drops

All serious, influential, and successful economists learned the basics from trading on RS.

Tell that to people who spend months grinding pets

I came here to try the exact same thing, nice

What part of Dragonball had elemental weaknesses? Do you mean pokemon?

Every 10 minutes? What a joke. I can post whatever I want when I want.

No scamerauni plz.

I see the issue, but with somethkng as small as this it's rediculous lol

Honestly thought this when i ran by it doing wildy diary 😆.
---
Please upvote me, I need to feed my family.
---
Nah.
---
+ you already made more then enough that you shouldnt care about price crashing.
---
No one ever quits. But when you come back, you always have the option to get that "bond money" - https://youtu.be/pUd5G3xTxa0 - to get you back on your feet quickly. But in all seriousness, I play pretty frequently and could always give it back to you if I am chosen as the winner. I know what it's like to quit and then come back to nothing. It's easier knowing that you can have some insurance if you choose me :)

wooden-blanket: I’m quitting the game. who wants my last 100m
---
They pretty much all use discord servers. The osrs forums are inactive
---
&gt;Hopefully it comes back better than ever as something even its detractors can enjoy
---
The problem is the premise of DMM doesn't appeal to me. I'd rather watch small teams of 126s play castle wars, clean wars, or some other minigame than any iteration of DMM. 
---
Props to Jagex for not fucking up this time round I guess?
---
Give it to me, I’ll stake it and give away 200m.
---
How many times did they put 100 hours into DMM tho.

Runecrafting is bad

1/65 drop rate, ~1.5% chance of getting it on 1kc. Not flame-worthy at all
---
Gratz tho
---
In going to agree but that may be because I'll never own infernal.
---
wtf
---
I luv gpeez, Eddy!
---
Im lvl 96 an i still have my obby cape. 80 ranged, 83 hp, 75 def, 50 prayer. According to the wiki i should be able to do it with ease, but i guess im just bad.
---
They can't even ban bots, there's no way they're going ban beggars
---
Just did barrows for the first time yesterday and this happened to me lmao. He hit like 5 zeros in a row so I got cocky, then he slapped me for a 45 and KO'd me.
---
Yeah I had one, I’m talking about when I had to buy more supplies off the GE
---
I'm f2p yeah, looks like I'm stuck killing cows
---
IGN hurleee
---
Bah.
---
Borrowed my friends t bow when it was 1.15 sucks ro be him.
---
Runelite tells you
---
In the second image we can see a piece with 2 white faces which makes the cube impossible to solve. Since the cube is solved in the last image, I am inclined to think that the cube isn't really solved and that you BOUGHT the infernal cape.
---
Ah sorry about that, if it's the Sara GWD clue then it can't be boosted unfortunately. TBF there is another breakpoint of 76 Agility for Zulrah ahead of that, so 71 is a decent milestone as well
---
Nice.
---
Wheres your herb sack
---
Do it with ease really just means those gear and stats will get you to jad with enough supplies left over. You still have to lean to kill jad! If you had max gear but didn’t pray correctly you can still get 1 or 2 hit by him :)
---
Some of us can't even flip in RS.
---
That's what you get for playing with roofs on retard

The 1 input to 1 action was an unconfirmed rule back in the day, but the rules now are that [only windows mouse keys are allowed](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Mouse_Keys_-_Changes_%26_Clarification).

Hell yeah boi

lol
---
I just tp back to house at the end of every kill. Usually I can do 16 kills without having to bank.
---
thought the idea of that spell book was just based around necromancy, like lunars is utility based and ancients are combat based?
---
I do like the idea though :)
---
Yeah but you can do 3 of them with 50+ prayer without needing to pot up
---
Stooooooooooop. Everytime someone posts this i feel im getting the ad now T_T

---
Rather not waste talent on this bullshit. I prefer abstract art
---
Really op saved me I think. I deleted my old Reddit account that had a lot of pics of my old pet along with a help post I made when I had internet trouble (shows my isp). Someone could easily see when I made my account too because of my first osrs posts many years ago. I deleted that shit because I'm not getting hacked for my tbow and sythe.  So fuck off with your sarcasm. Not everyone knows about this stuff.
---
90+ def and tank gear he's so inaccurate you can usually say fuck it. Hell pretty much never hit you more than once.
---
Even if he does, first hit would probably be &gt;50%, so he'll only max a 45 or so. If that happens, then youve gotta either eat up or pray. Just stay above 70ish hp and he won't 1 shot you. 
---
He attacks so fucking slow you have a fucking eternity to react to actually being hit.
---
Honestly, generally ahrim and karil do more avg damage than dharoks in the tunns once you're tanky
---
Tried to suss the subreddit couldn’t find it, I’ll delete it though
---
Did you stop hunting to do another activity and returned to hunter later on? Reset your tracker. Also consider western hard diary
---
Aight dude, think you should win this, ign: kaizen1
---
Spec transfer alts is only 300-320k melee exp, defensive chinning is 360k+. So you're right for attack and strength training, but not for defense.
---
Agreed, black chins would be dead content if there's a better, non-wildy alternative.
---
It usually gets burried. This community posts a lot lol
---
Because the team has grown a shockingly small amount comparied to how sucessful its been thats why, its clear jagex still want to put as little resources as possible into OSRS... but I guess thats just Jagex being Jagex, besides the "original" Runescape back from 2007 OSRS has been their only project to see success yet the put as little funding and development into it as possible
---
Awesome, thanks for the insight. When I revise this, I'll include some changes.
---
Ironman btw
---
Hm u payin
---
Same boat as you, 1k kc with everything but pet   :(
---
That's when you get another skill really close to level and just level up that instead without telling them lol
---
A few people have brought that up, and I'll try and revise that in the second version. Thanks for your feedback! Anything else you would change?
---
So the fight pits?
---
Devalues my ironman
---
How much you want for it?
---
quit the game months ago but still lurk, never bothered with pets or even getting to end game.
---
and yeah, I'm doing fine actually, thanks for asking
---
Democracy in action.
---
Yeah if you have the insane amount of money needed to do that though
---
The point is that combat capes are ridiculously common and AFK thanks to NMZ. AFK and over 100k/hr XP is a lil nuts. At least fletching you're clicking for that time and very few people do darts to 99 so it's like 140k/hr doing bows but you gotta click decently often
---
Or just type it correctly the first time
---
Farming hurts my soul.
---
Looks cool imo. Minor details like rune cost, numbers, max hit are whatever - but the concept is something I can def get behind.
---
Thanks! Edited
---
What you mean “not even close” you legit got smited 5 times lmao
---
Personally: i tend to sell bigger items that are volatile. When i stopped playing rs3 lets just say i shouldve sold my third age... Osrs weapons seem to be dropping abit but i have 0 idea if theyll climb high again
---
Lightning stun seems too op
---
Oh God
---
I definitely saw your idea, and at the time I was drafting my own idea. I started drafting whenever talk of Varlamore and the mention of a Hunter Guild in the Q&amp;A came out.
---
I hope Mod West remains receptive of at least some of these ideas, where mine or yours.
---
Nevertheless, thanks for your support. But, what would you add or change? For example, the Butterflies are pretty underwhelming. And I've been getting feedback that some of the Cooking Items might be overpowered or knock out a niche.
---
look at those nice graphics, to bad well never see them again.
---
Thanks! What would you change or add?
---
This man stonks. Tbh this is a very simple market strategy. And anyone who’s looked at previous summers knew about said drop.
---
Ok that was a good one.. take my upvote
---
Arceeus spellbook is not packed. Half of the spells are animate spells which could be easily grouped into 1 spell (like enchant bolt). The new all-in-one animate spell could scan inventory for heads and cast corresponding spell automatically, so no xp rates/effort is changed
---
Arceuus spellbook doesn't have many spells right now. Most of them do the same thing anyway.
---
look at all those minimum wage slaves! 4Head
---
Sure bud. IGN: Simly Wimly
---
It works or they wouldn't do it. I've seen tons of people in outfits like full ankou begging for fury's vaguely implying a player will be rewarded for donating. 
---
It's a scam it always has been
---
I haven't done a farm run in 2 years.
---
its okay son, i forgive you, now go do some RC for papa.
---
I think they could just reduce the number of reanimate spells into low, mid, and high tier reanimate spells since they do pretty much the same thing.
---
What sort of stats would you recommend to do Vorkath regularly?
---
Lvl 17 magic - max hit 14. I kinda wish this so there that would be a method to easily kill looter bots
---
Ez win
---
Yeah untradables from pre-log are still recorded in the log, because if you have them the game knows you got the as drops
---
Whats your prayer? I have everything around 75 except prayer 57 and for the first 30 waves I drank one super restore. 
---
I died 2 times. Once at wave 45 and once at wave 60 (lol I know). The mistake suck, it's like you said. You play for 60min and one misclick and you loose it all. I do it in parts. In the morning I go wave 1-20 than wave 20-40,40-60 and take breaks in between so it doesn't feel that long.
---
It's worth a shot really. I used toxic blwp as a weapon. Felt really good to kill Jad.
---
Q
---
If you attack another player I. The wilderness a skull and crossbones appear above your head. If you die while you have are "skulled" you will not keep your 3 most valuable items like you usually do. However if someone attacks you first, you are allowed to attack them back without getting skulled

Never did I not admit I was scammed, if I wasn't going to admit it I wouldn't have made this post buddy. I brought it up because that's what happened? Why would I do research to swap chump change. I am not forever ruined because I lost such a shit amount of money from RS3 which I don't even play anymore.

clan wars is already in osrs my dude lmao. most clans do fight in the wildy, cwa is a different environment completely and allows wars to happen in ways that are unique from a typical wildy fight.
---
Yeah, dealt with it in crypto alot. you'd never hear about stuff dropping and to buy in/sell out until AFTER the big boys had their fill
---
Yeah, that's what I hope too.  Games shouldn't be about politics. Since people have different world views, one view shouldn't be forced on everyone, even if it's a meme. Just my two cents. Hope you agree. I didn't mean to sound hostile. Have a nice weekend everyone!

Nah, I only trust people with your name to double my money.

Nmz still base 80/90s then start slayer as you'll get XP a lot faster than of you were to start combat training with slayer.

Dont mind ppl attacking you for wanting to play multiple accounts. It's very enjoyable and makes it all that more interesting. Gl to you

It's not that there isn't dead dino oil it just that there are way more dead plants than there ever were dead dinos so the odds are very low that actual dead dinosaur juice made a batch of oil. Plus most stuff nowadays is pulled from way off shore and all that is almost guaranteed 100% dead algae oil.

I was able to accomplish it on my 5th try with 58 prayer and 75 range. That said, I didn’t make it to him at all on my first try. My second and third I panicked immediately and got one shot on his first attack. Fourth try I made it to healers, panicked and switched FROM the correct prayer and died. Fifth time I got very luck with where he spawned + how healers pathed to him. Long story short, you gotta fucking breathe and realize you’ve done harder things on RS or other games. It’s entirely just not feeling the fuck out. That said, I fucking almost had a heart attack toward the end. I would reco a little higher prayer for you that way it last longer and pots are more efficient!
---
Your sister is fit
---
Yeah but after a while you’re playing blast furnace for the majority of your bond duration and only get like maybe 5 days of membership to do as you please. It sucks. They’ve made the bonds really unaffordable. It’s because they want people to either no life the game go play for free, or they want you to pay them
---
Efficient for Ironman yeah, but it's much more bearable than logs for normies
---
Community estimates were really fucking close.
---
We now also know the impact of each death which is nice.
---
YIKES, That's too long of a break for me

That's what I was thinking watching this. I know nothing will be done but Ice Barrage is fucking bonkers.

Would love for them make the points visible during or after the raid
---
The runners should never eat that food so It doesnt really matter if it's good or bad. The reason people say to drop a bad food there is so you have more good food to drop at the other placements.
---
Alright this may be a stupid question because I haven’t kept up with the game mode and its updates over time, but couldn’t making everyone an Ironman help solve clans pooling items for everyone?
---
Simple ags gmauls even if ahk are hard to detect. It's the 8 way switches that happen in all the same tick then switched back b4 next pid. That are easily detectable. If someone is switching that fast they are being assisted some how. Even youtubers who do these type of switches for content. If you watch their large switch many times the 7th or 8th won't be registered when they attack. They normally have trained themself to wait the ever most slightest after their large switches b4 their attack to confirm all their gear is on. That's why they have little pauses in their tribriding. Ahks they wouldnt have to pause at all.
---
Easy when you stake chump change
---
Ah woops, missed the text on the bottom that you already new about the upcoming Hunter Guild. :)
---
The only thing I don't like are the new pets (because hunter already has enough pets). I am also a little iffy on the butterfly jar effects, since I'm a bit nervous of messing up the potion ingredient economy further. Maybe if the butterfly jars could combine with the original potions somehow?
---
I'm personally not a fan of adding more stat-boosting and I sort of which new food had more interesting effects to give them niche uses (eg restore an interesting combination of health, stats, prayer, restore poison, temporary effects, etc) but I don't have any well-done ideas how to improve those now.
---
I really like the hunter crossbow expansion and that was something I almost added to my previous suggestion. I thought about using the different coloured feathers to make bolts with different effects (similar to gem bolt tips) but what you have here is quite interesting.
---
Make sure you tag Mod West (either here or on twitter) so he sees it tomorrow when he's working :)
---
Thanks!
---
Legs are overkill and just wasted time.
---
The tail
---
Would have been cool
---
Now its just a kids drawning
---
It gives enough loot as is and a bank run takes far less time than it would to get back to dks
---
Wintertodt wouldn’t be bad. For money
---
Market rebound is the best, feels so good to have your liquid cash stack again

Do y'all have a discord?

Thought the same for the guy who posted 150ish vorkath kills with 2 draconic vissys, easily couldve been several places but these posts keep comin up
---
Can u show how u Fletch? I struggle to do it fast on mousekeys
---
I'm yet to try anything like that yet. I started playing like 15+ years ago with massive breaks in between, so that shit is all new to me. Definitely need to try my luck there though haha.
---
Upvote me just that this kid below doesn’t get anything
---
need to buy smithing from 52 to 70,
---
do i buy gold ores and just get xp from making bars ? 
---
seems odd.
---
never bought smithing before.
---
cheers.
---
I feel I've been robbed of that. If my RNG was normal and I got a decent drop that's great. But when you've been spoiled it's kinda like oh.. cool.

Yep

I mean the point of 345 is not to reset. I specifically enjoyed 345 because it didnt reset.
---
To some people that would be like losing their main
---
The sex skill duh
---
63* looks like you can't count either
---
Yeah thats what seasonal was. Some people play 345 as a main game tho
---
What about all the people who play it as their main game?
---
Great content! I'd love to see any of those things happening. Hunter feels to me like a skill with endless options! I love the minigame concept you made. If fine tuned I would definately vote yes
---
You can set home world on mobile bro
---
Some things have odd apostrophes that can be hard to remember even if you know what the item is called. And of course, we all make typos sometimes, would be a nice QOL in those cases.
---
Ah, didn’t realize that bit about the unique chances. Cool, will just kill the generals too then. Thanks!
---
I have no problem with 45 being perm but I would love to see a separate world with monthly resets or even quarterly
---
There should be no penalty on death when in PvM
---
You should be fine, I have straight 59’s right now and the fight is easy. I started fighting him around base 50. Having prayer for protect from range is nice, but not absolutely necessary.
---
Make sure to bring emergency tele runes, and an inventory of swordfish is a good idea. A strength pot might also be a good idea but not necessarily needed.
---
I always meleed him, I’ve heard magic is technically better but much harder to do.
---
So why exactly are you quitting? Im.curious because most people who quit do come back at some point.
---
I don’t think they’d mind that much surely, the player base is practically dead and they’re all over powered to fuck, potentially brings new blood to the game. 
---
I tried joining but it was so disheartening getting fucked up by people with max stats and gear
---
How? The only thing I have found is the favorite worlds
---
Back in 2008-9 you could set a home world to always load to that world, but mobile atm just loads a random world based on ping.
---
91
---
What? Why not. Literally take your entire bank to a boss and die and not lose 1 item? What kind of easyscape game is this?
---
Trust me the loyal players would love a reset, I've talked to a lot of them, even ppl going for post max exp and they wish there would be a reset
---
show your dks log
---
I'll need a genie random for XP in that
---
60+ prayer would help, don't have to restore as often
---
That'd be fun if I could even get the fire cape lmao
---
imagine a runescape player doing the same thing over and over
---
One time I camped DK Rex for three hours straight and left with 5 B rings. Or my 63 KC Chaos Ele pet. Both pretty crazy to me.
---
Next time you will be more careful and maybe not risk void. If i take void to 30+ wild, il lose it too. But im not crying about losing it. Why should the game be easy for pvmers? Every boss is literally made easier with people bringing max gear and max wealth with zero risk. RuneScape is probably the only game to have that type of easy mechanic
---
Merely joking I just think spelunky is an underplayed game
---
And the best part is at least 2 of them are b2b from items. Cant be sure for the first pet. But if it is  b2b2b pets from items is crazy lucky
---
What was so interesting enough for 6 minutes other than osrs??? How can you do this to us???

]Here's a link to a more conservative edit that keeps Arceuus's blue terrain](https://i.imgur.com/rcwXtYg.png), since I don't know how easy that is to change in game
---
With Hosidius getting the Forthos Ruin, I thought it was only fitting to give Piscarillius and Arceuus each a cool new area as well. 
---
The key thing I took into consideration with these was condensing down and then making use of empty space, and making the terrain more naturally flow between areas. In Arceuus, the Arceuss houses were all condensed to the Necropolis in the north, and in their place is now a Rellekka "Witch's Woods" like place, fitting both in climate and atmosphere. Along with small ascended Arceuus living there, there are also foreigners who live in a town(it'd make sense that the Ascent of Arceuus is a form of enlightenment that requires dedication and training, and they even mention the Church as being where souls are still currently being freed from their bodies, so it stands to reason there are unascended Arceuus civilians who have to live somewhere). 
---
Given how deeply spiritual the Arceuus people are, I gave them small monasteries throughout the Dark Mountain, along with reforming the terrain to be more mountainlike, since a major complaint about the mountains was it was impossible to tell what was elevated and what was walkable before, and given the currently lone look-out at the border a full outpost, since the north is so dangerous.
---
Meanwhile for Piscarillius, I've shortened the number of buildings and condensed them to one port town, along with adding a market for thieving. The houses as is do not have the apartment-complex-like design of multiple rooms sharing walls like you see in Varrock and Meiyerditch, so I made them have more rooms, along with more doors(this place is the crime capital of Geilinor, why wouldn't they have doors?)
---
Lastly, I made a huddle of houses to the northeast a den for crooks and criminals, along with turning the lagoon into an actual fishing area, made the terrain more bay like and connected to the south, and added a new fishing spot, Whitesea Isle. 
---
There's room for other content to be added, too, but admittedly content designing is my weakspot compared to mapping so I'll just leave it at that aha.
---
69 for inferno
---
Didn’t you hear the man? No further explanation or reasoning required.
---
The only reason I have it is because I got lucky and tanked a couple jad hits lol
---
All 45 of them xD? I know it wouldn’t be the most ideal for the few who play it as their main game but it would get more activity on the world and it’ll probably be the best route to preserve the game in the long run by bringing in a new wave of players who won’t die to max CB after their 6 hours of protection
---
And that's exactly why he stopped, he realised that's not how he wants his channel to be. And is clearly trying to improve.
---
Looks like you're ready to start using a blowpipe
---
Roofs are those top parts of houses or buildings that protect the interior from the elements.
---
Inb4 woooosh.
---
Understandable
---
Dh is based off of your HP level as you know, but the higher level your HP is the higher you hit, assume you are low HP
---
People used to just mass at the portal every day.  It's very dead compared to the 2008-2009 era.  As far as clanning goes, that's very dead in comparison too.
---
Thanks for the further explanation and reasoning. Even though it was unnecessary.
---
What world
---
All of these spells are ridiculously OP in multi pvp
---
Clear title that explains exactly what happened
---
I've cosplayed some RETAAARDED shit in my  day but this is next level
---
That sounds extremely difficult only thing you ever find upstairs is men or women and NPCs that don't do shit lmao
---
Your first trade and you buy in that many? What was it trading at to begin with?
---
I always play with roofs on. Probably because I have a good computer that can handle great graphics! And roofs make everything look nicer. I pair that up with GPU and skyboxes.
---
It would be easy to see percent of damage done by you as a player though and then easily estimate if you had top points per room.
---
Ahrim dies too fast to deal damage if you use a blowpipe
---
Punishing someone for a thing they didn't do it bad, even if you do end up stopping their punishment. That's the scenario in both examples. It's a perfectly apt comparison, don't be obtuse.
---
The difference between the two is that an undeserved permaban that ends up being reversed is a gateway to undeserved permabans that aren't.
---
If Jagex had an excellent customer support system and a 100% perfect task record of fixing every mistake they make, you'd maybe have a point. But they don't.
---
And no, I don't agree that everyone who bots in any capacity should be permanently banned. And Jagex doesn't either, which is why there's a difference between macroing major and minor, the latter of which carries a much lesser punishment, and why sometimes permabans are reversed despite the acknowledgement that they were genuine.
---
Yea. And the population being so low, no need to diluate playerbase.
---
All for this!
---

---
&gt;	Why are you suggesting healthcare is less important than funding trillion dollar war campaigns?
---
You literally pulled that entire sentence out if your ass.
---
&gt;	You seem to think caring for humans will cripple your society as if Europe hasn’t been doing it for a while now.
---
So you imply I don’t care enough anout humans? Classic leftist argument. “If you dont agree with me on how we make life the best for humans, it’s because you don’t care about humans.”
---
&gt;	financial instability of a president is very important in regards to how he does his job.
---
If having debt and taking out loans is the standard for “financially unstable”, then nearly all people are considered financially unstable.
---
&gt;	. The fact you’re ignoring the implications of a American president being in the pockets of Russian billionaires is pretty bizarre.
---
Yeah, ya know, good point. Maybe we should open an 2-year investigation Trump and Russian collusion to make sure nothing nefarious happened. Oh wait.
---
&gt;	the position of president should be for the people with no billion dollar debts looming over an already conservative leader
---
Why should having debt disqualify you from being president? Seems like your arbitrarily applying requirements to the position that the current president would not theoretically meet to retroactively say he doesn’t fit requirements for office.
---
Thank fuck I got mine at 13 KC. This grind seems terrible

So then not afk?
---
It's called a clan or a home world. Doesn't add anything that doesn't already exist
---
Cool idea and i love the design but i dont think it needs another dungeon, zeah already has alot of dungeons it will feel clustered.
---
ty! tbh the waves weren't really difficult after the first time, i just ended up choking on jad a lot once the healers came
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvdlx-wsGG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvdlx-wsGG0)  is a decent beginners guide. There aren't really any meta guides because the meta is different for every combat bracket or even every build within a combat bracket so yeah.
---
You can't really PvP on a main unless you're maxed. I mean, you can play PvP minigames just fine (like Castle Wars) since most of the people there are also regular mains and not just pures... But going into a PvP world / wilderness on a main account that isn't maxed means you're going to be fighting accounts specifically built for PvP so you'll be at an inherent  disadvantage. Add that to the fact you're probably less skilled than them as well and you're just not going to be in for a good time. For example, if you're 80/80/80 with 85 hp and 70 prayer you're lvl 100. If you're 75/99/45 with 90 hp and 77 prayer, you're level 99. The 2nd account will have a major advantage, since the max hit with 99 str (v.s. 80) is much higher and has 77 prayer for rigour/augury so if they're tribriding then their range will hit much harder and freezes will land more often.
---
Excuse me what the fuck.
---
thanks broski

Fuck oak

i had 3, kinda forgot to drink up until the last few waves lul

LOL how misguided can you be

Theoatrix has a decent guide on pvm/bossing moneymakers. The route I took was barrows &gt; trio/duo bandos &gt; vorkath and I'm making a few m an hour at vork

It’s not concrete, you have nothing but a set of screenshots lined up to paint a picture. What actually happened may have been different than what your screenshots are telling, which is why I recommended you record the whole process. And then I wrote the other comment when I saw what a stupid, terrible person you were.
---
Or all the ironmen. If you had to farm hards for rangers it would take like x10 as long
---
Fally guards are 1/106, eclectics are 1/25 and you can spam click at the spawn location to get them quickly

I'm out of the loop. What happened during DMM?
---
What'd it say aha I'm tryna find the most fucked comment on this thread lol
---
If you doubled your money by deciding to play roulette, that was literally a profitable decision lmfao.

You can die and still have done most of the damage. Granted that would probably be a late death

That is an amazing sub, thank you.

if you make a runelite account your settings will be saved

You shouldn't give money to scamming bots

6+ is an onion, so no one has been.
---
It said "Id bang your sister", pretty tame but still disrespectful
---
It’s when you only play while you’re going p
---
I don't remember what the exact fix was, but it had something to do with running it in 32bit.
---
you dont need to complete lost city, the tornado thing spawns randomly in wheet fields around the game
---
It’s a box what you need an examine for
---
A level 17 magic spell that maxes a 14? Yeah i don't think so.
---
Lmao when all the xors have the exact same stats. I wish that dude would just make a youtube video or series explaining himself already. Until then i think im thinking the same thing as everyone else lmao
---
Basically like me saying lets reset the main game I want it cant make new servers because it will split the player base bye all your progress
---
Oh nevermind, runelite seems to have a "show impling spawns" in the Impling plugin :)
---
 It's better to not treat it as making money in any way shape or form and rather as enjoyable time because the money is so pithy it's not worth mentioning. It's well less than $5/hr btw given how many tournaments the clans win nothing in.
---
Wait is keyring already a thing
---
From what I've gathered the deaths are from lag. 
---
I've also gathered from reading your prior comments that you say some rather nasty things to others. I feel sorry for you, mate. Appears you are pretty insecure. You should get to working on yourself. You need a large amount of help.
---
Wouldn't the fire cape be more powerful than the infernal judging by Aesthetics. Because the fire cave is Flowing lava that has not cooled and the infernal cape has begun to cool which means it would be less hot and make you deal less damage? Or maybe I'm wrong and those are chunks of obsidian floating at the top of the lava that will both burn and cut the opponent. Anyway you slice it whenever I think of wielding something made of lava I just think of daenerys's brother
---
&gt;a month's worth of Saradomin
---
FTFY
---
Lets do it
---
Id honestly recommend a used low end gaming or similar one. Runelite doesnt run very smooth on the cheaper chromebooks and such, getting 10-15 fps on mine and it freezes on top of that.. Thats a 2year old 280$ one..
---
OR going in your upper range with a new one, maybe 450$+ id say...
---
Found the incel
---
It died once and came back though
---
It's not impossible to say it's relatively easy. You hook into the typing interface, have the items names as a dictionary (likely around 1kb compressed...), then you run it through the functions I have linked in this thread, display results sensibly. It honestly could probably even be done as a Runelite plugin.
---
Niko, it's Roman! Let's go bowling.

You ape, no wonder you haven't gotten the pet. Go west.

I think we all want a relationship like this

The skill is only activated in p2p mode. Therefore the run energy doesn’t affect your character when in f2p.

Yeah sex is cool and all, but have you ever gotten a pet drop?

Being young and poor changes you, i remember in the school yard in 2003/4 we had 8 of us playing regularly.

 We would try get info out of each other during the day and once we thought we had someone's password without them realizing we would wait til an evening they have sports practice and then go into their account. It was great splitting up the 150k cash lmao

Now a days im not tempted at betrayal by some pixels.

Ive never killed any gwd bosses, I should probably get on that.
---
The scary part is calling it a cave..
---
You're skills intrigue me. Why are you focusing on mining and smithing
---
The Arceeus spellbook is exactly as it should be. 
---
It's very much centered around death in both its teleports, and reanimation spells. 
---
The only type of spell I'd add to it is a stronger version of crumble undead. 
---
Ancient and standard spellbooks are for combat.
---
I suppose it's fitting that /r/2007scape has memes that look like they came from 2007 too.
---
I was doing irons and bronze at 80 combat with a dragon hasta and it wasnt too bad.
---
Yeah you dont need lost city but kinda bit annoying to look around for all the spots if ur going for a lot of imps
---
Yea lmao,you can add all useful keys there, like dusty key for taverly dungeon.
---
Make Smithing materials at blast furnace its alwasy profitable by several hundred K and gives great xp towards a 99 that makes money
---
Ya bro. N don’t worry about how close it was. People can heckle me if they want, but I finally tried the caves at 92 range with good gear lol! And it still took me a few tries! A win is a win haha. Gear helps but it just takes time to learn and kill jad. Congrats again bro! Fire cape is still one of my favorite accomplishments!
---
Thought he was around 170 ish
---
THAT cave but you forgot inferno!

Cant just say that and not explain the maths. It leaves dinguses like me confused and wondering

Think i made 40m doing blood runes to 86
---
We need to learn from the flaws DMM has and move on, rather than repeating them and waiting for inevitable. People will lose interest again.
---
Exactly. He’s talking about how dying should have more risk because he wants the game easier for him since he doesn’t even boss or pvm. He’s comparing dying in 30wild and getting smited while lagging to lagging at vork for some reason. If you lag and get smited in the wild you should lose your shit. If the fucking server nose dives you shouldn’t lose your void.
---
When you get banned for rwt and wanna try a new method of account recovery.
---
Haha.  I sometime set an alarm on the fitbit for birdhouse runs when not actively playing.
---
A good quote for the ‘old tomb stone, I reckon.
---
I like salt
---
Same reason I don't think everyone who swears should be perm muted or everyone who has ever rippef someone off should have their rights to trade revoked
---
Breaking a rule definitely warrants punishment, but that you think even the slightest infringement justifies permanent removal from the game regardless of the actual impact it had is incredibly unfortunate. And like I've said, Jagex seems to agree with me on this, not with you.
---
You're also dodging everything else I've said by refusing to address it, presumably because you know you haven't got a real point but don't want to admit it. I'll at least say that doing it so blatantly takes an almost commendable level of delusion, though.
---
If this is sarcasm this is top tier

Really? I haven't seen the original. Can you link me? If it's not OC I'll remove this post.

You just confirmed my earlier comment with this one

Go to tab 2 for tob and edit your average completion time (in minutes) and average deaths and team size.  J11 is your personal gp/hr from uniques.  FFA or team split doesn't matter.
---
Not if you use a client like RL or OSB that can accelerate w/ GPU
---
11mil an hour. Nice
---
Anything with a pet will never be dead content.
---
you're calculating it wrong. 
---
when the base chance is 10% and the group point are 16/20 then that makes a 16/20 * 10 = 8% chance to see an item as a group.
---
hower splits are based on your share compared to the group points and no the max possible points
---
if you compare to the max possible point you get the numbers you commented. if you compare to the group points you get mine

In 20 minute 3.5 man teams :P

Get Mory diaries easy too medium done asap.

Shit I just got a peg crystal and can’t imagine doing 2k mediums.

Nothing jut the deal

I do have kill count in almost every boss except raids and tob. But the most fun thing about pvm was back when loot would show up after dying. This is far too easyscape now

Still made me laugh, but jeez that picture quality

Just go to Molch, where it is single combat o.o

Honestly, why are people so obsessed with this grind? Just stick with blessed dhide boots, hardly any difference..
---
I bet they pay income tax getting paid under the table and have no problem owning land for a house. Lol.

Good point. I did some math in the thread which amounted to about 1/8533 chance of getting a Bird's Egg, meaning that it would already be incredibly rare.

Maybe players should pay an NPC a decent amount of coind to undergo the incubation? Say, 100k? What do you think? Thanks for your feedback!

Most people won't bother if they have to choose the world manually when they load up the game, especially on mobile where the app can easily crash or get restarted.
---
There's probably a reason we don't have it yet, and that probably boils down to "engine work"
---
You're assuming that a vast majority dont get paid under the table fam. How is it possible to hold the position that they do hard work for less wages illegally while also believing that they pay income tax?
---
The cunt tobs with void and not bandos and thinks he’s good too omegalul. Trash player for sure.
---
its literally never worth it to bank bones. I'd trade the use of boots for noted bones any day. Or just make it 1 noted bone vs 2 un noted
---
I got mine 2 days ago! Jesus it was stressful.
---
If you can't put the key on the ring, its safe to drop it I do believe
---
Does the slayer staff (e) do more damage with magic dart than a staff of the dead? don't wanna commit ~7mil if the sotd isn't worth it
---
🦀🦀6+5= 11 minutes 🦀🦀
---
agreed very boring content and toxic too
---
I've had a complete key ring for several years now. I cannot think of ONE time where I needed a key that wasn't on the key ring. You can safely drop all of those.
---
yeah, that's what you do. It's never worth it to tele out and bank the bones.
---
The mute is gone now and I figured since I had the Google authenticator stuff like that wouldnt happen
---
As a team too. Personal would be 1/850ish
---
&gt;Why was he doing his first master with a pet out? Lots of questions here
---
Ha it was my first masters. I had no idea that could happen. I thought I was safe. Also I didn't insure it because 500k for me is still a lot of gp on my iron. I have a few screenshots
---
Those things break?
---
Does the summer special apply to bonds as well or just for subscription membership?
---
Here Iam sitting here with an obby cape 😭
---
Oh man... to me, it just makes SO much sense to include Birdhouses in this Aviary! But I do see your point. I will brainstorm other alternatives to make this more balanced. What kind of ideas would you have, as far as Birdhouses in the Aviary? What if there were only 2 Birdhouse hotspots?
---
Cheaper than condoms (or childcare).
---
the fastest defense training is chinning mm2 on defensive
---
Funny, I haven't called for anything at all.  Just pointed out that with your love for things that expand the police power of government, you're the one that seems to have a boot fetish.
---
/r/banktabs might like this too
---
Crossbow is shit dps, use a bp and make sure you're ranged potted. Kill mechanics are simple, whoever deals the most damage gets the kill
---
Not op but yes, my prayer usually ends up running out right around the same time I finish karil

Almost all the books can be found on the bookshelf in a poh 🤗
---
Test it. Run in p2p to 75% and see how long it takes to replenish and repeat in f2p. A 10 minute experiment
---
We know.
---
OP wants to suck his dick
---
Pm me if I can have it
---
Gz got mine on attempt #3
---
Honestly dude looting BH/PvP worlds is probably better money than green dragons, and you'll just blend in with all the other looters/bots
---
Damn that’s a good post
---
Run some barrows or do the slayer
---
I can't imagine runelite being the problem. 
---
Another thing you can do is lookup your email on haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email has been compromised, it's pretty normal. I would also suggest you to have different passwords for RuneScape and your email, and maybe even set up 2 step for your email. Good luck
---
In the same kill I got an occult necklace, pet and a hard clue scroll from thermonuclear smoke devil. 1/108m drop rate
---
I have like 12 days of membership left and like 30 slayer

in what world is falling down an agility obstacle 20 times in a row in the underground pass "emotional support" lmao that shit made me want to break something
---
Fucking dick fuck.
---
But Warding is dogshit and the community shouldn't be denied quality of life updates such as wizard robe bottoms because we don't want Warding. Spined armor is also horrible right now too
---
Respect
---
why are skeletal wyverns still agressive toward me after 15 minutes?
---
Sex is for small brain normies

😂

In. GL

Join Skulled Revs cc, ask for trial..  You'll make enough to pay 3m for the first week within trial.

These bugs were definitely coded in on purpose. The Corp beast bug went alongside the pest control bug where these bug abusers would create countless accounts and train them indefinitely in pest control where they would bug out the minigame and cause it to never end with portals never losing hp either. They would rock cake down and dh the portals for insane exp n hour to quickly get them ready for corp bug abusing.
---
Anything non-pvp related? I just wanna kill monsters for loot
---
Whats your mage lvl and budget for gear, have you rfd and underground pass done?
---
what stats are we dealing with here? and how much bank value do we have to work with?
---
Mis-click brews, now I have even more health muahahaha
---
So don’t do them? I don’t get why people complain about this...
---
I have different passwords for everything and I appreciate the help thank you
---
looting bag takes 15 minutes of thugs (generous estimate) while rune pouch takes hours of BH or slayer. Once again, totally different and you're missing the point.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
If your stats aren't very good that won't be too efficient
---
Daaamn
---
*distant reeeeeeee-ing*
---
Sorry if I'm wrong here but isn't this an independent probability , meaning it doesn't matter how many clues you do, the probability of landing the boots is always the same?
---
Chaos ele is absolute trash money
---
The only people who would vote for this are people who don't play on W45. This is a horrible suggestion and is really unfair to the active players who only committed so much time under the impression there would be no reset.
---
No support.
---
If you wanted to make a new world, by all means. But don't touch people's hard work just because a streamer said it'd be neat.
---
I've killed thousands and thousands of green dragons at the central spot, north of the graveyard. Saw like 5 pkers in total, 4 of which I could tele before they even attacked. 
---
Best way to get there is carralangar teleport, either as tablet, house portal or regular spell. I've seen other people use games necklace corp beast teleport, but you have to walk a short while through multi if you use that teleport.
---
You’re delusional if you think someone could bang out a video, everyday of the year and it be top notch content. The effort alone was focused on actually getting a video out everyday. 
---
I’ve had another mate that tried releasing 1 vlog a day and it absolutely destroyed his relationship. Give the man some credit.
---
Damn throws me back to when I took my friend to raids cause he was maxed cb and had a tbow... came w arclight to spec olm lmao
---
Would love to know how you've edited this.
---
But it would be something passive during slayer etc instead of a seperate grind with eclectics because nothing you kill drops mediums anymore...
