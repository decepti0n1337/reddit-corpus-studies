Possibly because you’re the noob screenshotting  (badly) random players to shit on them on reddit and assume they bought their gold with a credit card, when he’s not even wearing anything THAT expensive.
---
---
---
too*
---
mobile good
---
&gt; All the players that have played OSRS  
---
  
---
Ehhhh, that sounds like it will be skewed by things like bots, alts, and one-time-players.
---
Dudes good for a bit he got two extra vissys lol
---
you hear that suckaaa,  everything been had been made.
---
Consistency separates good pkers from great pkers. You may get a couple clean gear, pray, and barrage switches, but can you keep it up throughout the entire fight when its neck and neck?
---
I think he's saying every player gets the same build but it would randomize which build that is each game.
---
Why make the effort to respond then?
---
People doing black chins or chaos altar
---

---
The d pick costs 6m, who the fuck is using it at PvM
---
So im basically paying either 5 dragonstones or 100 dragonbones to use the altar? That's gonna be a hard pass from me instead.
---
That means they'd also have to remove items from the chests, right? I mean, can't have a 1 def build with Torag legs.
---
Never would I of thought my home-state would be mentioned on this subreddit. 
---
Shut up, and take this upvote sir! Haha
---
I would get tired of that clicking noise after 8 teleports.
---
Or.
---
The ability to remove/add runes from the bank.
---
I mean, I'm a skiller. I have vested interest in Jagex not nerfing it to make my life a lot easier when doing wilderness content.
---
But as it is now, it's not hard to tell it's pretty unhealthy.
---
I would never want to swindle the almighty H8's gp.
---
You kill the boss faster, meaning you do get more rewards since you can make more gp/hr. What idiots are upvoting this? 
---
There is no risk in pvm outside of wilderness, and risk doesn’t equal rewards in wilderness. It’s easy to see how pkers find this unfair
---
Hacking you now, gg.
---
Nope. Not yet anyway ;)
---
You don't own 6m?
---
I understand wanting to avoid confusing players, but seeing people splashing also teaches them what that is. I think it’s pretty weird to restrict areas where we can do things we can do in others, or could previously do in those areas. This seems like a heavy bandaid fix for a niche problem if you’re looking at the player experience as something that needs to be heavily guided. OSRS is a MMORPG and so many of us LOVE it because of the different play styles it offers. People play all sorts of restricted accounts and have so many goals; there are people who have gotten 99 stats without ever using an “intended” method (pumping blast furnace as an example). *BOTS* are a problem that new players shouldn’t be exposed to, players using valid methods of gameplay aren’t, new players should see these players and learn that they have those options.
---
Should we tell him?
---
Who are you kidding? Not expensive? It's obvious he didn't earn it.  I only reddit on phone not pc btw.
---
Its even worse than the repost. The original was a maxed main
---
no if/when i ever do it ill just boost it
---
wc?
---
its a bgs fool
---
It’s him, I do not see a amulet around the neck and there is a salve in his inv and camera angle looks about right to where he is
---
Very well drawn. The expression is perfect.
---
Oof
---
Honestly made the wilderness more sp00py and less empty.
---
Thoughts?
---
Looks like he’s having fun while you know, playing a video game.
---
I personally think any PvP with 99 defense is quite boring. I’d say cap it at 75. This was also a problem in DMM and other PvP tournaments - everyone had 99 or near 99 defense. Bunch of 0s makes for boring gameplay.
---
Feet gets an upvote
---
But who is using this shield...?
---
&gt;Reworked the requirements of the Elf City quest to remove the defense requirement.
---
Why are low level pking accounts getting to decide the requirements of an end game grandmaster quest?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
By this logic, why are PvMers allowed to vote on PvP updates if it's not made for them? The simple answer is, is that everyone in this game gets an opinion on how updates roll out, regardless of whether you PvM, quest or whatever.  You can't just decide that this grandmaster quest (which obviously is made for an endgame area, it's a GM quest) is ONLY for people that decide that their accounts are not restricted. 
---
I'd also like to remind you that this community is one of the most toxic ones i've ever seen when it comes to ANYTHING PvP related - do you not remember when the adamant gloves poll came out? Pures got shot down then, pures got shot down again when the KQ head poll was announced.  Everyone shits on pures just because it is a different way of playing the game, but why does this matter? While our accounts are limited, does our opinion not hold just as much weight as yours? 
---
Can't speak on 2, as I don't know enough about the new area - but the mod talked about it below on why. 3rd one I can't see being a huge problem if it's put in correctly!
---
No I don't mind it. It's just silly to say it's *not* an ironman-focused update.
---
[removed]
---
I dont mind dying and losing my stuff, im a garbage player so 99% of the times i die its my own fault. The thing i dont enjoy is being forced into the wilderness to get items i kinda need on my account and have no other way of getting. Like i guess if i want 99 mining ill just use a rune pickaxe or grind out master clues (and drop the ones that put me in wildy) 
---
You shouldnt be shoehorned into the wildy to progress firstly and secondly they shouldnt nerf defensive items so that you can die easier when you get pk'd
---
Then one guy has a thing he shouldn't for 1 day until someone else notices and he gets banned for bug abuse and it gets fixed. What on earth is the big issue?
---
Very good. Expecting more, bub.
---
I think you need to log out completely, you can't switch world's in game
---
it's 2/772. or, simplified, 1/386.
---
or, if you're smart, it's 50/50
---
No, you just clearly want PKing to be too easy. 
---
I never had a problem taking down bulwark with a small team other than a select few times, mainly by my misclicks from my excitement of getting his bones; which was my fault for screwing up. 
---
I also don’t wear full welfare and expect to demolish him and catch every freeze.  
---
Nor do I want my small team, or a PKing clan to have even  more of an advantage than we already have in this dying state of the wilderness. 
---
These changes isn’t going to bring  fresh meat to the wilderness, it’s going to stop even more people from going there due to the ridiculous changes.
---
"I only risk my own bones"
---
-death
---
"Really? Again? You know I have no risk."
---
"Fine, I'll hop."
---
This but unironically, thouse of us with littereally zero interest in pvp gaming should have the option to opt out.
---
Sure, but things have changed. It's now an official game mode that something like 30% of the playerbase actively plays, so it's a large enough fraction of the community to warrant *some* attention at this point. Pures who want to engage in pvm content are a much much smaller fraction, and not an official game mode.
---
It was too random before. This is more randomizing the class everyone is playing in. Some strategies would change depending on the starting gear and upgrade paths
---
Because he wants to?
---
got your ip already thanks for the account
---
Good to know that real noobs still exist
---
Careful with that. I’ve seen posts and comments about people geting banned for using that foot thingy.
---
Yeah me either. Lol. Maybe half a fight
---
My mistake, forgot that part.
---
Yeah, that's when you tell them to give you their rune armour and after they give it to you just sell it and ignore them.
---
This seems good.
---
D
---
If there's players that we "shouldn't be catering to" it's those who are so pathetically bad at the game that 200k worth of dragon bones is something to waste a sentence complaining about.
---

---
It never stops, there will always be new ways and that requires dev time to iron out every small weird interactions about quest xp and items you wear that you can no longer wear for little to no benefit.
---
Never trust a South Carolinian!
---
You have to actually go fight a boss (stronger enemy) and kill it. Like i said.
---
I cant just go hit target dummies or goblins and claim i deserve bank because im wearing good gear
---
Yall complaining about pvm players not dropping millions is like me complaining that i havent gotten any good drops from the goblins outside lumbridge
---
&gt;id probably play an iron if I wasn’t so far in my main
---
Haha do I feel you there. I said that for 2.5 years, until I maxed and made an iron. Try it. You'll wish you had done it sooner. And gathering quest items is really not a big deal. Everything just take a slight bit longer but that's well worth it.
---
Yeah that’s pretty much all I did! Just used AHK to remap my numpad keys like that video. Haven’t tinkered with the program beyond that. I have a feeling it is indeed a hardware bug with my numpad, which is why I followed that AHK route. 
---
Appreciate the heads up though man!
---
What if some areas single and some multi? Multi areas can have a slight increase in luck, maybe like 10%.
---
Not everyone wants to just hop worlds all the time, its inconvenient and Id usually expect not to be killed twice, or more often in a row. Sometimes I have to.
---
Level 3s don’t have armor unless their main acct gave them it
---
I don't follow. What's 2/772?
---
Why couldn't they just update magic so that there is no negative magic bonus to allow you to always splash, i.e. There will always been a small chance to hit.
---
Ooooof
---
The changes don't seem ridiculous to me
---
The guy running south from black chins will die like 20% more of the time, still not lose the item, big deal.
---
The new LMS is a good start. Would like to see different gear setups. You risk nothing and can practice. Also, you can play got money as well. It looks great.
---
No they are the east and west bank.
---
F, my phone missed the 'us'

Wait..... people use left click attack options?

Chose a different world, bottom left

---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
We are trying but apparently all pkers are too stupid to understand words longer than 5 letters long.
---
I see. Thank you very much
---
idk, with boxing, freezing and logging, creature agro, and the bulwark(even after nerf) it is incredibly difficult to kill a person in the wildy that knows what they are doing. I think its much better to let the average player lean how to escape, instead of adding ridiculous defensive items that just make the pker hit 0 after 0.  The wilderness is a pvp area, if you are there for pvm you should naturally be at a disadvantage.
---
Referring to antimen?
---
Thank you so much, sorry for being an idiot!
---
check varrock sewers then ;)
---
Isn’t he from Ice Poseidon CC
---
Pvp can fuck right off that's why.
---
Was waiting for a Picasso-esque pronunciation or Ardougne, ngl. Nice vid! Hope people stick out the 6min and watch the whole thing!
---
While I was against the dihns nerf as it was unpolled, lets be honest. Would you vote in a VLS so it could be end-game offensive gear?
---
You SHOULDNT base your opinion on youtube videos where most youtubers wont put in clips of people escaping/tanking in a dinhs and hides because tbose clips are boring to watch. Dinhs is strong vs max gear and any pker who pks in max like monni will agree
---
15 minutes? Man that sounds so fast! I remember when I had an hour to play and getting to the login screen took 40 minutes.
---
does a tank at bandos get traded alchables/bones usually/how does it work? Sorry I've never done gwd
---
green pixel pet has a green pixel pet in the last panel
---
People watch videos for highlights and good points unless a bad point is special in some way. It's part of pking, but just like any other montage style video in any other game people want to see the sick kills.
---
The thing is they don’t agree, some may but a lot don’t. Hence why they’ve made things easier lol
---
We could make them run into the walls of their cages if the community wants it
---
100m isn't a ton of money but that combo of gear means 1 of 2 things. He's either wearing that stuff as a joke to look like he bought gold, or he bought gold.
---
You actually seem pretty worked up over this which kinda makes me think you bought your bank too :l
---
I play in huge spurts tho. So I won’t touch the game for 2-4 weeks at a time then I’ll play every night for like 2 straight weeks 3-6 hours a night haha. I made an alt and an alt Ironman at one point. My alts almost 1400 total and my main sits just around 1930/40 area. Meanwhile my Ironman has like 50 wc and sub 40 melees from whacking on cows. I really only log on my main now and my iron has never been a member. I’m quite enjoying ezlloring more of the wildy on my main. But the constant ballista barrage teams any time I step into a multi area make me want to just stop for the night. They spam their clans like they just took down a giant. While they gotta split 100k 5 ways. Sad to see but if that’s what gets their rocks off, I’m glad I’m not a PvP main.
---
Isn't the dps counter change insignificant?
---
H
---
Feels weird seeing someone using osrs followed my username lol
---
Don't be an ass about it. There's a ton of jargon in game and getting confused is normal.
---
Yea that was kinda why I hated bg's. Literally zero skill/teamwork with retards and as a war literally no chance solo unless it was 1v1. mostly did duels/bg's, could beat any class consistently no matter how good they were unless extremely good frost mage/dk. i never tried pve though, might be really fun but that's another thing i love osrs for. you don't have to rely on other people to do content, everything is solo'able/duo'able etc if good enough. in wow to get a few pieces of gear would take literal months of being with toxic retards who think they're good for pressing their 3 button pve rotation when i had 70+ keybinds as arms war lmfao.
---
Only if the pathways are randomized each lap.
---
I've never seen a username more obviously belonging to a bigot in my life, who proudly has pragger in their name?
---
Dude what combat style do you want the pkers to hit the guy using the bulwark with? A tank setup with low risk has +350 to melee and range defences ffs
---
Alt title suggestion: Psychopath uses this health bar design
---
Dinhs is amazing in pvm, Its got a massive Aoe special to agro a bunch of monsters in multi.
---
Nobody has ever willingly been skull tricked otherwise ot wouldn't be a trick would it? The very name implies you have exploited others.

For real
---
You do realize you hopped into this conversation because something I said bothered you, right? 
---
Why would I buy gold? I’m an ironman, you silly goose. My main is maxed.. what are you even trying to assume?
---
You can’t tell someone they’re triggered, when you’re triggered yourself. ;)
---
funny thing is, since no one but rushers are gonna risk 4m, all weapons that take up 50% spec (claws/dragon Warhammer/ags/bgs) will now be SIGNIFICANTLY underpowered and even weaker than the cheaper alternatives since you wont be able to stack damage with the (new) instant maul special. for pures especially, the dragon dagger to granite maul will be the new meta and still have potential to stack someone out from full HP. the sad thing about all of this besides the oldest weapon in the game being changed is that dragon claws especially are going to take a huge hit since no one in the right mind is going to die to a single or double spec in most cases.
---
Hey, thats pretty match my level!
---
I have never commended on anything thougt.
---
idk maybe because 13 do 50?
---
Just when you thought reading this sub couldn't kill any more of your brain cells you see someone genuinely suggesting to use "pk skills" which amounts to be using entangle instead of barrage and dumping specs... I need a lie down jesus christ
---
Use common sense. If it says it's changed and it's not why would you think legit. 2nd after knowing that why would you click the link. Gg account

This dialogue is also a reference to the Explosion of Anger speech from Dragon Ball Z, when Frieza asks Goku (as a Super Saiyan) what he is:

could search the cape for a chisel like you can search the herblore cape for a pestle lol

It looks like it used to, I think. At least, I cant remember it looking faster than 12 fps.
---
When I played wow I went hard, I liked to try every class so I’d level every single one up. Definitely always a fire mage fan but they always get nerfed early since their power creep is strong as well. So strong in the start = op in the end. Which makes me hate the starting of xpacs. Plus the new Artifact pieces of gear are the literal worst concept i troduced to wow I’ve ever seen. The weapons and class design in legion actually felt like you were progressing on your character. BFA felt like a horrible, repetitive grind in the worst sense. And that’s coming from a long time RS player. (Fuck eoc btw it ruined this beautiful game. So glad they revamped osrs. As is this community I’m more than positive lol)
---
Its a joke calm down
---
Honestly the playerbase at the end was so small. Less than 2 dozen of us legit players and countless bots. Doubt it would make very much money, if any. Cuz anyone playing legit isnt gonna bother with mtx most likely and anyone botting has all the time in the world to get levels.
---
Lmao
---
so it turns skeletons to a pile of bones ?
---
You expect me to believe they put yellow shoulder pads all on ALL 4 of the capes in rsc?
---
Good point. 
---
They didn’t say anything about the previous counters being brought back in though (not saying you’re wrong or anything!), but reduced the binding from 15s to 10s.. but if they bring the same counters with it, it won’t be as big of a deal. 
---
It just slightly ruins the whole Magic/Range/Melee triangle in my opinion. 
---
Rangers not being able to run from melee,
---
Mager’s not being able to run from ranged (with Long Range attack style)
---
Melee typically not being able to run too far from magers. 
---
HOWEVER, if I can narrow it down to 2.5 to 5 seconds bind with the previous counters.. I probably won’t have a problem with it.
---
I work in the oil field, flowback to be exact, and 80% of my day goes into osrs. 12-16hr days at work.
---
played it a bit recently pre-update. was ridiculously luck based. I got 2 kills over the course of like 20 games. This beta is awesome. Just got 2nd place in my most recent game. I fucking love this update
---
It turns them into a weaker version of that boss from rfd
---
I’m 126cb and another 126 gave me 10m for no reason at edge today
---
agreed, tried out the beta today, and there were so many people with pking clients it was stupid. Many people were new to tribrid and you could tell in the way they pk, then you had those that were experienced and you could tell from a glance, the switches, the way they faked, and then the other 80% of players who would use clients to lure you into a safespot. Not to mention the fact that the player base who uses clients like those are hella toxic because they can beat noobs and those who aren't using such clients. Once the new version goes live, it'll be a way for cheaters to test who has the better cheat client.

Is staking for friends allowed or is it commission staking?

I found it lol you have to choose from the login menu thanks though

Fight caves arent that hard. I did it with blowpipe and 80 range. You can also use the jad sim from rs3 to practice. It's not the same graphics or layout as mobile, but the animations are close enough and prayer switching works the same. You got this dude, go get your cape
---
I know the feeling. Don’t worry though when I design it I will do it in such a way so as to do like half the area single and the other half multi. It has to have some part of it multi.. it is the wildy. IMO multi makes it more fun.
---
yeah???? why on earth would letting your hitpoints fall to zero have any consequences?????

Nah dude you're one or the other, pick one...

If you want to equate item value to risk, why is it that a 15m(AGS) item cannot beat a 7m item (DB)? How about a 60m (DClaws) or 80m (Kodai)? DB is too good.

Nice
---
I am fine with most things becsuse pvp does need a revamp. But I dont know how I feel about negetive xp lamps. The point of specialized builds is limiting yourself

* Using a newspaper on Sraracha, the pet for Sarachnis, results in her saying "Don't you dare!"
---
* Once you complete the miniquest In Search of Knowledge, as well as having used the temple coin on the Stone Relief, you can tell the Knight of Varlamore in the Kourend Castle about the Forthos Dungeon. He will then travel to the Altar of the Sun within the dungeon, and the animation when you pray at the broken sun altar changes from a regular praying animation [to this one](https://i.imgur.com/QAgiQHn.gifv), a reference to Dark Souls.
---
* When you ask Brother Aimeri who he is after healing him, he says that he hopes you and he can uncover the secrets of the dungeon for the greater good, to which the player responds "The greater good". This references the movie "Hot Fuzz", where the main character travels to a small town where they are weird and act all cult-ish, and often say the same line after one another.
---
* There's an egg sac in Sarachnis' lair that can be examined, which is the exact same message that shows when checking the status of a Pokémon egg that will hatch soon in Generation 2 games.
---
* The strange passage examine text references Stranger Things
---
* The gods of the sun and moon, who were worshipped in the dungeon long ago, are called Ralos and Ranul. When you reverse the spellings, it spells out Solar and Lunar.

In-game they’re like 4.5-4.6m. Otherwise they’re about $6 or so? I haven’t bought any in a while
---
Depends on the situation
---
Old news
---
Can he teleport after 2.5/5 minute teleblock? And can he also run away the entire fight until you’re unable to atk him
---
He covers a pretty solid set of information in each video. His gear, why, his inventory, why, the mob he’s fighting/ info on them. His voice is pretty easy to listen too and he adds a little bit of personal touch each video. Only thing I don’t like is his plugs but I get a guys gotta eat.
---
They still do have an advantage
---
They can either fight in turn for maximum efficiency, or  try to smite the player 
---
You’re still effectively fighting a player with double the health
---
Yeah I am not sure either. I asked my brother maybe he used it a long time ago or something. It never asked me. I assumed it would eventually but then I realized I was kinda stuck with what I had. It was odd. Ill probably just pay the $6 later on. Kind of frustrating I can't just create a new character though.
---
But if you are fighting only 1 person you can easily just run if you are prepared to do so
---
Me too. Looked way too cool to be a one-off monster.
---
Jesus that in game price. I havent played in a while so i don't know if 5mil is a lot of in game money anymore.

Yeah the percentage is a bit too high

We’ve had barely any updates in 6 years, cry more.

Way too overpowered and this would take the place of all 3 protect prayers. I like the idea of a scaling prayer but this is not it
---
Fuck it. Only 200m xp in all skills should vote
---
Only noobs know where they spawn
---
Well this is where freezes/binds and teleblock come into play 
---
Nothing too different from normal as far as I can tell
---
Why should you be able to be borderline invulnerable in an area that gives higher reward due to higher risk
---
Depends on how easily you can earn in-game money tbh
---
Honestly the pray drain from preserve is so negligible you might as well just keep it on
---
You can choose to be ignorant to my point if you want, doesnt do me any harm.

I wasnt using the matchmaking system, I was going on community lobbies to play retakes/casual scrims vs those who were much much higher rank than me.
---
My point was if you face those who are better than you, you could take it as an opportunity to learn and improve yourself. It's really not that difficult of a concept.
---
idk how that would even be possible , it defys odds by a shit ton lol
---
Regular trident and msb (i) zulrah
---
Well assuming no bots, which are they still a big problem? I feel like when I last played they started to mess with the economy a bit. Yeah so I'm level 4 right now. Not really a big money maker lol
---
it sucks ass. I love doing barrows but it is so unrewarding at this point. I even tweeted at mod ash to see if it was a glitch but it's not lmao. tempted to level my iron up and see if I get better luck
---
No it's not.
---
He looks similar to Tarn from Tarn's Lair, after he transforms.
---
I had one of those growing up. It’s called a Virtual Boy. The one and only game I had on it was Mario Tennis, and it was phenomenal.
---
hes probably a pker
---
Yeah its because now you use email addresses to log in so cant re use them. Its actually safer in the long run if you get into the game to have a seperate email for only your rs account as its a lot harder to social engineer or get your passwords/email leaked from other websites that may have been comprimised
---
 You'd think, but they'd rather waste their own time and ruin the game for other people.
---
I know but he always mentions him, I want to see what CHESTBRAH is up to.
---
There are a couple of remakes in the making. Such the arcanists or funorb subreddits and you should find them easily enough.
---
This would only take precedence in multi-combat encounters I would say
---
.4 dps is still a 13% increase in dps which is pretty significant considering we're already over 5min mark. with your gear, I didn't get 2.9, I got 2.707 https://i.imgur.com/km27PrH.png which would put us at 391 seconds, another 70seconds. and that's on the rag gear, not the 4 item gear. 
---
I'm sorry to trigger you, i just wanted to show the extremes because the MOST common argument is that the pker isn't risking enough to kill a bulwarker. and with my point, the bulwarker can risk nothing and the pker can risk everything, and it won't matter. 
---
it's easy to escape with a dinhs. that's kinda my point why it needs to be removed. you can still escape without a dinhs (or ely). lynx titan got 200m at black chins before either were in the game and we had staff of the dead and ags and kraken. And ofc this was a 5min tank test face tanking. you can run around in hobs and hug a door to make it even more aids, but that's not really a dinhs problem. tho together, the problem is exasperating
---
Should I just bring another ppot then? Previously was able to reach 5-6 kills pretty comfortably but with rigour was running out of ppots. I tend to keep rigour on the whole time other than during freeze attack
---
I only have 300kc, so I'm not sure if this qualifies as experienced but...
---
Normally, I find preserve's prayer drain to be minimal compared to the other 2 prayers. I bring 1 ranged pot, and 4 ppots(4), with my food being monkfish. 
---
Normally I don't use the 4th ppot. What I do is, during acid phase, I turn off my quick prayer, switch over to prayer to turn on only preserve, while walking back and forth. Once vork is done, I turn quick prayers on and rinse and repeat. 
---
I have 99 range, so pots bring me to 112. Once I hit 109, I tend to use a dose to put it back to 112. This lasts me about the 4-6 kills per run.
---
account made in January so unfortunately not
---
This
---
Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.
---
If you have a decent job and can afford $11/mo for membership you can change your name once a month as a member, otherwise the best f2p money makers are gold necklaces (I think) and drop parties
---
another side note is this would allow people to smite players that are running, but maybe redemption and preserve should remain locked.
---
Might be one kill away too. 50:50.
---
When you say clans, what are you talking? 3 guys in xerician or absolute max 20+ man teams? Because I can assure you real clans have way more interesting things on their radar than a dude in veracs or some random guy doing a clue. They might try and skull trick you if you look juicy and they randomly find you but they aren't hunting you lol.
---
It's ridiculous that people are saying it's his fault, even he didn't buy the cape it shouldn't be stripped from him. Plain and simple maybe Jagex needs to take a look at their process for finding cape buyers. If this truly is a legit player, who legitimately  acquired their cape then Jagex has done them dirty and should make it right. That being said, if he is in fact a cape buyer then he deserves the punishment, but maybe Jagex should still look at their methods for identifying cape buyers to make sure no legitimate player is stripped of their cape. I would rather a few cape buyers keep their capes than even one person unfairly punished.
---
Not even close. Zerkers, Meds, Piety builds, obby tank, etc.
---
i dont think they should cater to either, but i dont think they cater to pures lmao, but they definitely cater to iron men even tho they specifically said they would not
---
Is there any place (available to non members) where it’s a little more vibrant with fun players? I seem to be stuck in noob land
---
Gotcha. 
---
What I’ve been doing is turn off all prayers during freeze stage, and during acid I would keep just rigour (and preserve) on so I can woox walk some extra dps.
---
It looks like I’ll just start bringing 4 ppots so I can get 6 kills per trip without that bottleneck
---
Yeah that makes sense I suppose. Didnt think that through too much. I don't plan on becoming some sort of powerhouse player. But who knows.
---
The desktop client, even Runelite, is limited to a max of 50fps.
---
&gt;you can't seriously pvp in rs the combat is so poor all the skill is from exploitation of the poorly coded mechanics
---
Sounds like literally every single skilled activity in the game
---
There it is, this is what this is all about: wanting the wildy to be safe like the rest of the game. Too bad. Jagex has realized what this subreddit is doing. Integrity change is coming :D
---
   
---
Pkers use the shield too btw
---
Besides getting varrock med armour I don't think you can even do 1 def addy gloves with 500 xp.  Come on smart ass.
---
better magic defense yea, if you have black dhide and a bulwark you will also be near unkillable to melee and range
---
Yes because Jmods watch every youtube vid.
---
When I got my first elemental whip I had such a boner omg.
---
Also remember it being the first time I ever saw a k/d ratio in "runescape". I think it was the summer of 2008 when I played. Good times.
---
I chose 50 because I figure pures would want to have this as well, and considering a good majority of pures have Smite, I figure this was around the right figure
---
Yeah I was going to get membership once I finished a bunch of free stuff. I wanted to do the quests. Will really depend on if I get some people I know playing in the long term.
---
Be interesting to do a big checkerboard collage of all of em
---
Which is good...
---
time to sell my stack of gilded chainbodies
---
The GE always has a ton of people in it, other than that just stick to the most populated worlds and you'll run into people all over. Granted, a lot of them may be bots or mobile players and thus not juch for chatting.
---
Yeah, those are types of pures.
---
Bones To Big Macs*
---
Someone should not have to spend another 10-20 hours to get another cape because jagex may have made a mistake.
---
Hey, at least it’s not fire-making?
---
Why do people keep floating the 6 mil number like it means anything? One that's dirt cheap, two it's irrelevant how much it is because you aren't risking it via skulling up if you're in tank gear at the chaos altar anyways.
---
Do you have a torso?  Bandos chest is one of the smallest upgrades to your melee setup, it has the same strength bonus as a torso so its just defensive bonuses and the one prayer bonus.
---
It does look cool though.
---
Blessed dhide is going to be better in most situations. Void is only better in some niche situations like vorkath, tob and chinning
---
Sounds good to me, it's not any differeny than slayer alchables
---
Right...but they aren't trying to fight. So they do need to risk. If you try killing someone with that shield you need to risk more if YOU want to kill them. They do need to risk to be killed.
---
Clip is gone
---
yep i agree, however one should probably not get their first cape on a new IP knowing that it'll be sketchy.
---
realistically if you completed inferno the normal way it'd be another 90-120 minutes. not 10-20 hours lol.
---
I've always put off getting the torso just cause barb assault looks so off putting to learn and play, but I'll just start it up soon. At least I save my cash stack!
---
Magic isn't slow at all,  it that shouldn't matter anyways, you like using it, so who cares if it's slow. You also profit on nearly every task using magic anyways. It's how I got 99 magic.
---
Unless....this was all bs and you just wanted to bot a skill cape for no reason.
---
That's the point
---
Boot camp and windows 10
---
Yes friend they are.
---
If you dose constantly you get pot locked and can't eat as quickly
---
It can but if you know you're full hp and you'll just be attacking the guy you don't miss any ticks potting between attacks.  This would just add an unnecessary nuisance to the game mode.
---
How will gold sellers abuse this? It's no different than doing a trade. Open location PvP transfers are not ideal for gold selling...
---
Thanks PAL
---
Wtf downvote this i dont follow for content.
---
Good idea!
---
Range doesn't need a buff
---
Lvl 1 wildy on a low population world would be pretty easy
---
Gonna need a lott more scales but gz af dude. Some are dry 5k+
---
yeah just think of it as making 20mill in 2-3 hours so easy with the pain that is Barbarian assault. Im close to 2200 total with 2b bank and still never owned a BCP. BCP has a bit more defence but thats it, and defence rarely matters in this game. GL!
---
It could go in the blessing slot
---
I don't think Jagex would like to subject themselves to public embarrassment. Especially after polling for partnerships.
---
Interesting idea but it removes the need to pray switch so the 1 person in a 2v1 has an advantage except for less supplies. Maybe maybe it 25% or 40% and. Requires 3+ people on you to activate
---
The truest F there ever was.
---
Fm actually makes some good GP
---
Hunter training tho,
---
Runescape *is* tedious work my B
---
If he could reasonably fight back, sure I'd agree. But since they can't, you aren't actually risking *anything* during that fight.
---
I also got 5 zenyte shards in 300 kc...
---
Not to worry, were also playing here at the hospital until you guys bring us patients.
---
Nah verac skirt has better mage def, range def and pray bonus
---
Completely different
---
Make it a beard slot item like barb assault roles. 500k to toggle on autoskulling, automatically toggled off on wildy death with 400k cash dropped on death
---
Someone shouldnt be scared to play runescape on a different ip because jagex may fuck up again
---
I’m literally bubbling right now
---
This is it. This is the funniest thing I’ve seen on this subreddit.
---
I am a little butthurt about my 2 def account. I'd change it. But it will entirely change the available pure builds. Will change pvp completely. I'm not sure.
---
It is for inferno apparently. Ask anyone else who account shared for a cape.
---
tldr, Ironman mode was polled to NEVER receive dev time or updates.
---
Do you have a recommendation for a cc? I've been jumping between several youtuber cc's but I haven't found one I've wanted to stay in
---
Gratz!@ but rip come july 25th
---
Bots can give PvP opinions?
---
A very nuanced and mature response as expected, No wonder why that part of the community is dying.
---
q
---
Not sure if joking or not but that would be a pretty lame AMA, lots of people on here that are qualified and would be happy to do so. I'll do my best to answer any questions you may have about getting started, in case you're looking for another hobby. Prior programming experience is helpful but not required.
---
Keep for raids
---
l0l0l yeah dude i logged in once in 2005 dude yeah, but my totla lvl is like 115 and 5 hours ingame time bro, im such a VETEREAN BRO. PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 15 YEARS BRO IM SUCH A RS GAMER.
---
im gunna start my opinions with "veteran here" cus i logged in once 15 years ago im such a gamer, my opinions matter so much
---
same... just watched someone die afk in full ancestral... rip my free 300m+ :(
---
It's being nerfed because it is way too OP in single combat. Also Tbh if you get caught by a team in multi you should die. Who tf thinks its realistic to escape a 10 man team. Use your brain
---
You can only loot gold up to the # you have in your own coffer. ie if you only have 100k in yours, you only loot 100k out of u/scadizzly there.
---
I'm skeptical how many pk'ers would actually use this instead of just hunting spades, but I don't see any real harm coming out of this. It's not like gold sellers are any less powerful now
---
Any time! Learning to Pray Flick was super daunting for me, and since I am more of a visual rhythm kind of guy, when I discovered this was an option, I immediately latched on. I can flick for hours and never miss a beat because of this plugin.
---
This is kind of silly but because of the mediocre laptop I'm playing on I have to use the Low Detail setting on RuneLite, which changes how the BA stage looks, making it hard to find which square is suggested in the videos and guides I've seen, especially because it has to be done in real-time. Wish there was a way to practice solo or something!
---
Lmao this is my cc
---
Your chance at escaping is your reflexes to tele out or have the agility short cuts. It is ridiculous to think you should be able to tank 10 people. Just stop
---
Agreed lmao I don't agree with this recent circlejerk, I've used dinhs and the only pkers I've ever had trouble with are ones in max risking 500m+, that's honestly not balanced at all for bulwark price
---
Lol!
---
Love how they continue to add more Monty Python references within the game. Look at that Knight, tis but a flesh wound.
---
Here's your setup. Void gear (elite pref). Salve amulet (ei). Rune crossbow with diamond &amp; ruby bolts. Dragonfire shield. Ava's. Snakeskin boots. You're ready to farm vorkath
---
That's true. I'm okay with people fixing a mistake, just not with changing the meta.
---
Upper level is way better than lower level. The veins run on a timer and each one lasts 15-27 seconds once someone starts mining it.
---
This just sounds like sand casino with extra steps
---
Ok I can see you are too unintelligent to have a conversation with
---
Does this mean ags and dds prices will rise?
---
Is there anything I can do to avoid PKs at Lava Dragons or is it just the cost of doing business? My only risk besides the drops from farming is a couple hundred Chaos.
---
I'm pretty new and low level and people just Login on top of me(sometimes in groups) and I die in 1 or 2 bolts.
---
only if you are a dirty pker that wants to STEAL from a pvmer
---
Reeepost
---
I mean isn't it mostly cosmetic? Also I don't really pk at all but i have no problem with pk updates.
---
Perhaps try and use tile markers
---
I would like OSRS to have a large agility course as all the ones we have are so short and repetitive. Even RS3 recently got one in their version of Fossil Island.
---
&gt;5 years ago
---
I'm gonna guess this isn't the one OP was talking about
---
Do you expect to get claws or ags too every time you pk another pker? What is the consequence of them dying with their +1? Why is it different for the shield.
---
Pure spam or w/w had youtube videos of playing on his friends pure w/ inferno cape and nothing has happened to him
---
Ooph that's rough...
---
Anyone who knows what they’re doing NH bridding in high cb brackets will NEVER die in a 1v1 without a g maul combo to finish them off. This is a terrible change unless they maybe make the attachment like 2m points not 10m. It’s honestly ridiculous that jagex and this community is so disconnected from the pking scene that when they finally make a pvp update, it’s actually going to kill pvp even more lmfao.
---
Yep that’s true, that’s why I made the comment lol
---
this sub seems to be filled with a lot of kids/teens addicted to the game. I let this game take over my childhood, take it from me: this game is not worth it. 
---
you can play the game without letting it become an obsession
---
If you have done any programming before it's even simpler - just importing a library. All the fancy math is abstracted away, you just need to know enough to chose the appropriate method. 
---
The hardest part honestly is cleaning your datasets, there are tools to help you escape excel hell but it's still the most time consuming part.
---
Yeah, can you take extra time on the first round and find and mark the tiles for yourself?  That could work maybe.
---
sounds like an intern at funimation wrote it, maybe even an intern's ten year old son
---
You can just use Binding Shot if you are using range, but the pker can just Freedom that and start chasing you immediately.
---
That's a bad decision. 42-45 defence, 70 defence, or 1 defence.
---
Other unique builds:
---
65 atk 13 def 88 combat
---
60 atk 20 def 88 combat
---
You want your max cb level, if you're not a zerk or above, to be between 83 and 88. All other hybrid builds are terrible.
---
If 70 def, 60 attack.
---
later virgins
---
Is no option supposed to be no opinion?
---
They nerfed them?
---
Using a $150 phone thats 3 years old, just go get a new phone you cheap ass
---
Sell it. Items like this go down in price. Sell it and upgrade your gear and stats.
---
id actually use gear to hit on it though...-\O/-
---
its not really a buff to ranging its more like giving PvMers an escape in the wildy with the nerf to the shield
---
I'd say 25-30, 100 is actually pretty time consuming if you're a pvmer and don't have any reasonable stats for pvp.
---
I tried castle wars and didn't like it very much. I tried the LMS beta and thought it was pretty fun.
---
Different strokes, I guess.
---
The mage defense of a dinhs is a measly +18, if you can't hit a barrage on that, you have your own problems
---
Runescape for sure, i've been playing since 04/05 (had some breaks), other than that i had over 4000 hrs of wasted time playing Europa Universalis IV according to my Steam account before i realized i was a game addict and i deleted my Steam account.
---
They're not active humans who should have a say how the game is run, as in get to vote.
---
This creates a new problem of someone wearing a piece of gear, or doing a quest, and then losing the level requirement. How would that patch into things!
---
So just risk like 500k, which is easy to get, and just increase it when you get paid out.
---
Do you normally not use gear to pvm?
---
risking 500k+ in chins usually which is more than the salad
---
Yes what boss is 50 kills an hour?  And what boss is 5 kills an hour?  Oh you mean the better bosses take longer to kill and drop better gear.....weird.
---
A1 my guy
---
Shut up
---
Yes. And they have access to that.
---
And finding an empty world that they can pvptransfer the money isnt hard.
---
???? Go to the lava maze. Or the lava dragon isle. Or chaos altar. You'll find 4+ member clans killing everybody they see

"Does it make you choke on ritalin and question your life?"

"No"

*pushes down mining*
---
It is.  The only nuance is that going from +18 magic defence to +8 will result in more freezes being caught.
---
I love a good username that just screams "crybaby"
---
Larrens keys are incredibly hard to pk number one, and number two zammy wines spot became dead content in release. 
---
If you’ve ever pked, you could hop for an hour at points and not find a single person at either.
---
Fun fact, about a month before this update I asked mod ash about adding content for the ring of visibility
---
The point is the most expensive defensive gear you can get still gives a pker a reasonable chance to kill you because they aren't insane leaps above their predecessing gear. Dhin's is an insane leap and isn't expensive. That's the issue.
---
Then why point it out?
---
This is why inbreds like you need to be banned from polls. You vote with a stick up your ass and ruin content for one side of the game because you follow the “pker bad” motto. How pathetic.
---
I mean are you really expecting to tear through a 6m shield in your salad robes and ancient staff/dhides and rcb now in singles? no you shouldn't be. The real trick to it would be oh i don't know nerfing black hide. This would cause everyone to have to risk more for better mage defenses which the bulwark doesn't have to begin with really. Or better yet remove most of the sub 30 wildy teles as those have made most places in the wildy worth going to safe cause you can insta tele the moment you see a white dot most times. The exceptions being mage arena, wildy rune fountain, and chaos altar which is borderline a joke to escape from anyways
---
Except that you can
---
Is it fun to train?
---
No.
---
Flip everything down but slayer.
---
Every time I think I've heard of the dumbest idea in the world, rs3 comes along and puts my ass back in place
---
Why continue to cast doubt after the CEO himself says NO MTX? Why play if you do? Jagex are aware of what they did to RS3. You have to give them the smallest amount of credit that if they're going to put it in writing that they aren't planning on bringing in MTX, then they won't, surely?
---
No....Why would I play LMS...it doesn't look fun, want to know whats fun? Soul wars.
---
character is left handed when it comes to bow :^)
---
if i told u the footage you see in my videos already happened, would u believe me -j1m
---
Everyone who has ever used a dinhs in PvP knows it's overpowered, I don't understand why you pretend this is so unwarranted. 
---
I'd love to see any of you try to kill someone in a dinhs tanking all your hits all while camping mag e pray.
---
Damn so 20k..... there goes my plan to rebuild my bank lol

Agility shortcut. Level 41 agility. Real life backyard elite diary required.

---
You can’t splash Lumbridge anymore, it gives you no xp. You have to go somewhere else
---
Also you: Ironman btw
---
Would like to see it tho im not as fussed as i was a few months ago. Jagex reset almost anyone who applied so got a few friends back though not all. Negative xp lamps only help the game by not makig people raqe quit.
---
The funny thing is, a book of balance and ancient staff have more magic defense than a bulwark
---
I think you cant splash anymore in Lumbridge or its suburbs
---
THEY MAKED IT A REAL TING LOL
---
Wtf is this game
---
lol I wish my stats were that high.
---
Its not a big deal. Could also just code the game to unequip things.
---
Thank you m8!
---
Thank you!
---
Ahhhh damn I knew it was so familiar but I haven't watched the dubbed version in so long I couldn't put my finger on it. Thanks hombre!
---
It's actually open source. Their code is clean and maybe one day they can infect anyone, but I doubt it. I've spoken to the admins before, they're really nice people. 
---
They just do this for fun, really. The main point was to make it one client where people can use OP plugins which are usually sold. As a result, making it very hard to profit from custom runelite plugins. If anything, they've made it safer by allowing all plugins to come from one client, rather than multiple people (who can infect the plugins easily). 
---
As it currently stands, they could've hacked all 700+ players using it ages ago if they wanted, but haven't. Seems they have ethics, unlike others.
---
got it back 2 back finishing my task
---
I have reported  him in game, just thought Reddit was the best place to get JMod attention as this man states that JMods always remove his ban.

Lol watch as jogflex does a hidden update to add the whole farm to the no splash zone.

Mage bank clearly

I made money when I got 99 cooking on my normie account

Only failures don't have an average level of 92 across the board.
---
Good thing I don't care about failing.
---
Damn no Monty Python. I am disappointed in Jagex.
---
The problem is that if you have dinhs you don't need to know whay you're doing to survive, that's why it's being nerfed.
---
Is this a reward from elite?
---
real throwback to rsc
---
This isnt mobile
---
It depends on the bot completely. If you make a custom script and try to make it seem as legit as possible you can make it near undetectable. But then the suicide bots that are seen in f2p are detected almost all already on tutorial island and banned all within a week.
---
yeah just wondering if i should by rigour now or save up for a dhw

Just like the simulations!

Fear and loathing intensifies
---
Best one I’ve seen nice
---
&gt;So, you might say there are currently consequences for your actions?
---
I knew there would be consequences for my actions. When I killed him, that consequence meant dumping an extra 100 bones into the altar before I got the unlock. And now the consequence that I thought I was getting for my actions just got way harsher. 
---
Like, sure, there are consequences for my actions. It just would have been nice if those consequences didn't up and change halfway through me doing the thing. Guess I should just wait a few weeks before doing any new content so I won't get fucked over or something.
---
Isn’t that collectively more than half of what you do in a farm run?
---
My point was sarcastic, I don’t actually see removing nmz items and making a new way of getting them an ironman cater. Anyway, even if it was a fully cater, kinda? Because it is now an official gamemode. If it still was just something people did for fun, like pures and zerkers and other account builds, yes i’d be just as against them catering to them, because people chose to limit themselves just for fun. So what if you can’t use an altar because you chose you can’t get prayer exp anymore and didn’t pay dragonstones, that was your choise.
---
All i’m saying is that, your 15 year old ancient account build is self limited and built for PvP. 
---
So what if you cant do a new master quest, or use an altar, it doesn’t affect your pvp, but oh dear the moment you get 2def and maybe an extra cb lvl, account ruined. 
---
I get it, self imposed restrictions are fun to create and to see just how far you can get with them. Ie swampman. But just because you created limits, doesn’t mean the game should ever cater to them. No matter how old the roots go. Just because something is old or “exploited”, doesn’t always mean it’s good.
---
did you just rewatch this?
---
But you can set your respawn there as well
---
efficiency =/= Fun IMO especially first starting out. I think it is good to kindle the love for the grind early on.

wonder how mant times he fell down at underground pass

It honestly leaves me disgusted with the  word "community"
---
Oh i missed the pineapple memes
---
Jogflax look!!! He’s running!!! I can’t kill him cos shield!!!!
---
Litterally a nerf
---
As well as screen capping the whole thing, I use a program called Lightshot. Allows you to snip a smaller portion of the screenshot
---
Definitely doable at those stats, higher melees would be nice but 99 range offsets that a bit. Mage level is largely irrelevant at gorillas
---
Personally I bring a slayer helm, blessed d'hide body/legs/boots, blessing, and barrows gloves. For switches I have arclight/ddef/fcape/fury/berserker ring for melee, and blowpipe/assembler/anguish/archers ring for ranged.
---
For the rest of the inventory I generally bring a 4-dose super combat and ranged pot, 4 super restores, rune pouch (alchs or vengeance depending on how tryhard you feel like being), royal seed pod, and the rest sharks. An SGS is a big QoL increase and will extend trips, but it's probably out of your price range.

I, for one, cannot wait to see what's next

Guess we can also nominate this art for the golden gnome 👀

~$5 if you're serious enough. Or ~10m a month if you're a mercher/exceedingly rich

U also have to chase it down, and if u splash/it gets away you have to hop worlds

Like the true friendships you'll make along the way!

Wow nice new jmod, looking for more of hiz projects for late game..
---
Compare his dung with bullshit slayer caves
---
1m seems low because of Cosmic crafting
---
Was the someone you..
---
Yea well one way I look at it is that you will most likely get it passively if you were a newer account. I realize that the grind is quite massive if you have to just grind for that, as is your situation. But if you were to start a fresh account now, you will probably get the mimic before you have all the other requirements completed. So in the long run, considering the whole game and all the players, I don’t feel it’s that absurd.

ancient staff to burst dust devils or nechryaels
---
Problem with Bulwark is that people who use it need no skill to get away. I have literally had chinners that just put on pray mage and run from 35 to 0 wild tanking a full on team without changing a single prayer.
---
What we want to see is PvMers actually taking the time to learn defensive mechanics in PvP. Once they start investing time into it (because they dont want to die), they will also become more eager to anti PK or learn the offensive aspect of PKing as well. 
---
Right now they just put on a Bulwark, pray mage and every time they get attacked run down. They will get chanced along the way but because the PKer needs some godly RNG to stack them out they won't die and tele out.
---
They don't learn anything by doing so.
---
Imagine using a weapon in PvM that allows you to do ToB without learning the mechanics. PvMers would get mad as well.
---
RC is way too high. 25 ?? what is this almost maxed account
---
That is how the skull mechanic works. Correct.
---
If you want to try and kill someone you are going to have to risk more than they are to be on equal ground if you attack first.
---
Im still waiting for someone to show us "slayer while slaying"
---
It literally makes zero sense that fairy rings without staffs are locked behind Lebeidge diary, and it pretty much ruins the lore behind fairy rings.
---
But noone cares because "Its a good challenge” and "staffless fairy rings are op" (really? one inventory slot). At least in 2007 jagex somewhat cared for the lore
---
yes please. literally no game has this and as a lefty it's annoying as fuck
---
Outdated meme, currently, we're on Pvp bad, pvm good.
---
Yeah, the post was literally the title.  Good one bud!
---
It was like hitting a rock wall. Really caved in her world. Absolutely crushed her.
---
You most definitely can complain. Falls under player harassment
---
I think you have to talk to that person to start the slayer skill, after that, you can use her
---
Sure, but the only reason to ever kill goblins like that is for the champion scroll and music cape, whilst you’ll do masters/elites passively doing literally any activity that earns you them - so you can’t compare a passive grind to an active one like that
---
It's old news but please check your PC for malware like keyloggers, then change your password and make sure you have a pin and an authenticator for both your acc and email.
---
&gt; Gold Decorative Chaps require 40 Defense to wear. 
---
yeah, SUCK it pures B\^)
---
Meta is used to describe what most/a large number of people do to train the skill. Most people don't splash.
---
But jigglypuff who will keep the Lumbridge rats busy??
---
Why the heck does things have to be locked behind cash? Thats like the other. suggestion about having to pay for an agility shortcut. How about we put cool rewards on quests instead of wasting them on dumb stuff? (cough, fairy rings being on a lame diary instead of quest)
---
then you haven't really bitten into runescape yet, wait until you go for your first 99
---
Aren't there hundreds of other places you can splash outside of this zone?
---
You could just attain another goal and have that a side goal, especially since it seems to be getting under your skin.
---
Do slayer or something and do the clues from that. It's one of those things that will happen when RNGesus let's it happen.
---
Because this sub is filled with people just like this guy.
---
I hope you’re trolling...
---
That is, indeed, what the title references.
---
improvise, adapt, overcome
---
Not impossible, just a bad idea.
---
I remember I told my mom I had a gf in rs when I was 13. Gf said she was 31. Mom freaked out lol
---
wildy altar and black chins was essentially it.   A few mains here and there would just carry it always in the wildy just in case, but mostly the 2 reasons I listed.
---
Sotd gives 15% more dmg, =15% faster tasks (or very close to). Also the list of barrageable tasks is much bigger if you know what you are doing
---
But thats how it works and how itll always work :)
---
What are you really risking skulling on a naked though? Nothing, there is zero risk Vs. reward. Zero risk, for usually zero reward(sometimes a big reward if they’re stupid) this is objectively poorly designed, no one can dispute that this goes against the philosophy of risk vs reward. You risk 15k for a small reward. If they have higher tier equipment, use higher tier weapons, you’re risking more, but if they have a higher tier weapon, your reward will be greater. I know the bitchy papers are the vocal minority but my god guys you’re already heavily favored and you want to nerf on of the only reliable tools people have against you, you want even less risk using a water staff and salad robes. Just leave it as it is(IMO they should make it easier to not die to pkers because they’re in favor already but that’s just me) there’s a reason the wild is dead, you killed it by over centralizing the meta on yourselves and now pvp is dead and the closest you get is poking innocent pvmefs and skillet with jack on them.
---
Duo force spawning, I averaged almost 5 dragon imps per hour. Then I somehow went 49 imps dry on glories / dstone amulets, so it still took far longer than I hoped
---
Yeah I get what you are saying but you cannot actually call that meta. Meta is a pretty strong tag to put onto something as menial as splashing. Splashing is a waste of money, and you gain the smallest bit of exp. It's a horrible idea really.
---
sans
---
ah yes, but me running with ancest 110m kodai 75m arcane 100m ma2 cape torment brace 15m occult 1m eter boots 5m still splash 15 times in a row solo so whats the point of bringing up value lmao
---
Yes its very fun. The whole flaming annoys me slightly though, people are so cocky...
---
Non skulled get to never risk 3 items, i pick 3 good items, im not here to fight back, the trade off is im not as good offensively as you, amd for that occasionally ill risk my hides, climbing boots and if youre lucky a glory
---
Ohh great, yeah I already had elite void and salve ei, and after a couple hours I can get blow pipe probably
---
As long as it's one press for one input it's fine because it's you doing to clicking.
---
Haha brilliant
---
what a fucking shit title
---
Pls.
---
But it’s kinda short game design that pvp is so dead that the only way to breathe life into it is to pure pvmers into the wild with content only to have them killed, I think even most pkers would agree that’s kinda dumb
---
For the lump of RC xp, since there's nothing else I know that can give that much in 1 action. Obviously the xp/hour is wack but the 100k xp in 1 action I can't explain otherwise
---
sotd doesn't autocast ancients so you need to be pretty sweaty to barrage with it
---
ofc you can technically barrage any task in multi if you have the patience/alts but the person asking doesn't know what barraging is so those two are the most common/easiest tasks
---
&gt;defensively oriented boss
---
This is one of the things rs3 fucked up massively with how accuracy etc works in that game. Many bosses were just hard to hit on if you didn't have the accuracy aura and bis gear. So the entire fight was just a splash fest, which isn't fun
---
That's fine, just keep em out of Lumbridge Castle
---
I will never understand how a pvp system where you deliberately have to put yourself in danger of dying is a “good pvp game”
---
Bwana she has a bf already

I think this happened to sparc mac recently lol.

Lowest. Barely notice the difference after 5 or so minutes. Would rather the extra battery life.
---
I do have a job, social life is a little neglected, im not sure about my future cuz my job sucks big time.
---
Yeah but its just not a good look on the game from a new player perspective. Nobody is "bothered" by them. But if I was new and on F2P worlds, sent to lummy I'd be confused as fuck. Plus they're all mostly bots

Looks like you need a new alt Serene

---
You think this is not as ethical as it seems because you don't seem to know the market for this. 
---
People were selling plugins for as much as a fucking AAA game, that was for something so basic. Runelite+ literally fucked them over on every level. This had made it harder for people to sell private plugins that don't automatically PK for you. 
---
Because of  how Jagex's anti-cheat works, you cannot get banned if you are playing legit. Even menu entry swapping is not bannable, they cannot tell the difference because on their end it just shows as an interaction, not an interaction on menu index y. Because if that was the case, then they'd need to have very accurate maths to determine how fast someone can truly right click, which can cause some major accuracy problems for those who are super fast at clicking. 
---
Literally everything within the client is client sided, nothing can be done about it. Even if Jagex shut down runelite+, they can just make their own client. This is time consuming as pointless, so that's why they just used runelite as a base. What they're doing is no where near as sketchy and detrimental as others. 
---
I've seen people use the runelite client as their private server client and much worse. 
---
Before you think "I'm in on it", I'm not in on anything. There's nothing shady (that I know of) that's going on. 
---
All the best devs from every bot client I've seen are also contributing towards it. To them, it's just a fun little side project, nothing more. 
---
Trust me, with their talent they can easily make more money doing something else than hacking people's accounts for rsgp.

Assuming you're killing every brother you are getting unlucky. I think it's a 1/17 drop rate for gear with every brother killed.
---
I think she doesn't like salad robes
---
Lol what a piece of garbage
---
That's coz you're doing it the worst way. You average one master every 1.5h doing meds (possible to do quicker), so for 15 masters that's 22.5h. Still a long time, but almost 3x quicker than what you're saying, and it's not a steep increase from hunting a 1/5k champion scroll. It also averages 1.5 m/h profit
---
Brb I'ma test this real quick
---
They are doing fine, but just because a business is successful doesn’t mean they can’t grow, I mean why update the game since it was a perfect nugget back from 07. People don’t want mtx cause they are scared it will turn into rs3, but that doesn’t mean it will happen, we already have cosmetic items in game, we already have a source of mtx, and people don’t care because it doesn’t matter, why isn’t everyone rioting about bonds, they are literally pay to win, especially compared to cosmetic.
---
But.... PVP bad
---
I remember being a f2p peasant and having chad p2p players coming onto your world to buy your feathers before the grand exchange
---

I am killing all brothers and with 90-100% loot potential.

So basically: I'm unlucky

lol

"It suits me so go away with your logic"
---
So when I say I want different weapons for different scenarios you think it means I want the same dps on all weapons.  The mouthbreathers in this sub is exactly why Jagex needs to remove voting as the method by which they add content.  What I'm talking about is different stats for different dps depending on the monster you attack.  For example, make claws have terrible fucking accuracy, but high str bonus.  Make spears have incredibly high accuracy, but a terrible str bonus.  Make warhammers have high accuracy but low str bonus when compared to battleaxes.  Make battleaxes have a very high str bonus but lower accuracy.  Daggers could have low accuracy but a much faster attack speed.  Make a two handed sword have a higher str bonus than it has now, lower accuracy, but hit slower.  Make a mace have a higher accuracy and str, but be slower.  Give the med helm no negative to magic defense and a bonus to range accuracy.  Give plateskirts a higher stab and crush bonus and less range negative while also giving it less range and slash negative.  Give the chainbody an even better crush defense and higher range defense.  
---
It's not hard at all to vary the items so their dps is dependent upon the enemy you fight as well as that enemy's defensive stats.  Just because you're an idiot and have no creativity doesn't mean others are the same.
---
Hell ya
---
Bank Pet-pet? 
---
NeoPetScape?
---
&gt;they already gave us bonds which I’m sure cut deep into their profits
---
No. Bonds only enter the game by paying real money. Even if you bought them in GE then some had paid real money for them.
---
that's the first thing I thought when I saw this map...seemed really odd they left that specific spot.
---
You’re not even that dry lol
---
You're actually trolling lol. Sandstorm spell was what people asked for every single week which is even more of an easyscape update than sandstone. They wanted a spell that would just fill all your buckets. Ironmen then COMPLAINED that the sandstone update was too harsh with the gp required for it and didn't think that the DOUBLE amount of sand/hr you could get previously without tick manipulation and TRIPLE the amount of sand/hr with tick manipulation was good enough.
---
Depends on the task really, but it’s normal just barraging or using the trident where I can, dust devils and nech tasks are super good mate exp, I see people do Abby’s as well though I’ve never done it myself
---
Kindly desist from talking, serene.
---
No actually, the crybaby pvmers who ended up making the game a pile of poo
---
Where do you have a civilized conversation with an average pker?
---
That's exactly why it's there, so you can't spec tab.
---
Grinded my way to full graceful and was excited to get a green hosidius recolor, then I found out that it takes another 90 marks to recolor the full outfit ;-;
---
Fair point I didn’t fully realise that, but how are bonds ok and cosmetic mtx not, seems like bonds would effect the game a lot more than cosmetics ya know?
---
the absolute best money maker in the game results in less gold per hour than a minimum wage job in a lot of the western countries. being able to pay for membership via ingame activities is a nice feature, even if it's not a good return on time investment
---
Most people know rendi is one of the best mechanical players in the game I think.
---
You won’t get any magic exp for splashing within the blue zone. It’s to prevent splashing bots all over Lumbridge. As a new player the splashing bots are really confusing.
---
15% dmg boost most certainly doesnt mean 15% faster task lmao.
---
&gt; means osrs can make more money, meaning more staff to work on the game
---
oh yeah because execs reaping profits and putting into their pockets never happened, right
---
&gt; they already gave us bonds which I’m sure cut deep into their profits
---
you aware *someone* does pay for a bond with $? And that bonds cost more per membership time given than direct purchase? Bonds don't appear in GE out of thin air. 
---
&gt; If it’s cosmetic and it doesn’t affect the game
---
https://gfycat.com/negligibleantiquecutworm
---
MLM is better exp than RC though right? 
---
And wayyyy less click intensive. 
---
Everything in this game is tedious to a degree
---
I think this will be for a quest, just like Prifddinas finally has some use instead of being inaccesible and used for nothing.
---
I give up, some of the comment replies I'm getting like this one just scream "I've never been in the wilderness"
---
There’s no wrong way to do this game, yes people have worked out that if you get graceful and agility up ASAP it will decrease your walking time significantly but most people don’t enjoy that at all but do it anyways for “efficiency”. Don’t get me wrong I literally have done it on every account but you don’t have to just play the content you want if doing bosses or pking is what you want focus on the combat stats. You wanna mine and smith? Great mother lode mine and blast furnace you can do a lot of stuff with or without the agility I find if I focus on a crap task to much I dread it but if I do some pking some bossing then hit a couple hours on the roof treadmill then I’m more satisfied with my day in gielinor  I might even touch that dog shit skill rune crafting
---
I don't use this site that often
---
Great use of gay cunt
---
Are you okay?
---
Depends. 
---
Skilling is pretty much the same, just grind the same pattern over and over. 
---
Combat on the other hand... lets just say from cows (no prayer + single combat style) to barrows (maybe prayer but easy to change between brothers + multi combat style require but again easy to swap) to demonic gorillas (requires swap of prayers throughout fight + multiple swap of combat style throughout combat) to real big bosses like godwars and chamber of xeric.
---
&gt;they already gave us bonds which I’m sure cut deep into their profits as a lot of people like to pay for their membership with in game money.
---
Where do you think bonds come from? Who do you think is paying real money for them to enter the game?
---
They already make enough money without more unnecessary mtx. If they want to earn more they should rather fix the game instead to appeal to new players as well as veterans. More people buying membership is the way to go.
---
is it still 20min until log out? since he doesn't attack you back I thought it would only be 5
---
No
---
Probably both
---
Did you even go to Watsons house to be able to get mimics?
---
I got the pet at 70 and now I don't want to level more but I want to train thieving :(
---
I love doing clues on my iron because you get shit like this that would normally just be a disappointment but it's amazing
---
Big Shaq
---
Maybe you shouldn't try to go for that prod spec and insta tab then if you don't want to die.
---
I was being  sarcastic to show that the methodology was wrong. Everyone knows that whip + defender is better DPS than AGS in a vacuum with 0 defense.
---
Guess I didn't make it clear that assigning arbitrary weights to a stat don't work as well in this game as they do in other MMO's like WOW where you can boil every single number down to a single weight that determines DPS.
---
Won't people just circumvent this by using slightly less negative mage bonus so they rarely deal damage, and do it against mobs with high hp?
---
Locking stuff behind gold is boring. I'd much rather any fairy ring expansions to be locked behind fairytale pt3
---
Yea and pvmers are 200 iq chads xd, imagine killing virtual monsters and hoping for item drop when you can kill actual players for guaranteed items
---
Worms is fun but its not arcanists level of fun :(
---
Currently in the hospital now about to pop mobile on
---
Super xp. I use defensive casting atm as I need def xp.
---
The shape really reminds me of Manus for some reason
---
theres a % to hit
---
I mean I have tiles marked and take the same pct every time which doing RC, does that auto make me a bot?
---
As much as you have the screens, smithing between the bank and back isn’t a hard thing to do.
---
I wasn't offended at all, I couldn't have cared less. Just giving the fella a heads up
---
What does it bring to the table for trios?
---
You only get protection for the splashing poison attack, you still need normal poison protection
---
They need to implement sunlight blade which does extra damage based on your prayer level
---
Indeed
---
i went 181 chests dry on any item besides key halfes or d meds. THAT is a damn dry streak... you are just kinda u lucky because rngeezuz likes to mess with us
---
Sup gay cunt
---
I got muted for calling one a noob lol.
---
Not if he’s getting 350m a week from welfare lol
---
If you literally have no chance to escape of curse people will be mad
---
You get protection from the damage the poison splat deals, which would do about 30 damage. Now it just poisons you, but the splash itself doesn't hurt you.
---
How many other in game activities take time and dont pay for membership ?
---
Plus you get average range xp and a chance at a vissage and pet
---
It's not hard to sustain your membership with bonds..
---
650K is still pretty low end. You'd need to find 5 kills an hour without going down once yourself to make killing pkers worth it. Is it any question why people aren't bringing gear to fight back rather than turtling and running?
---
Your risk as a pker should easily be 3-4x that of the pvmer if you realistically expect to get kills.
---
So your not gonna reply just make a statement, can you see how mtx in rs3, and what they propose as mtx in this game are different?
---
Ponds are gayy
---
Yeaaaah so I’m really thankful it doesn’t say how many hours I’ve played total (oh wait... Hans)
---
Such a gentleman aren't you Spit
---
Keep it if you ever want to do bossing. Its special attack drains 30% target's defense and it stacks with multiple AND other players' hammer special attacks
---
next time make an easter egg require you to have a 420 nature runes and some other obscure trash in your inventory
---
No it doesn't but I bet you would say something to a dude laying bird snares and box traps and cannons around you trying to disrupt your skilling, wouldn't you? I've also played since 05, I would like to think there are some differences in a broken bot and someone skilling without public chat on.
---
I didn't do any of that today, other than speak to the firemaker about this dude and he comes to his PC hurling abuse at me and the firemaker saying everything short of admitting it directly, obviously for bringing to light his activities.
---
I know that but I just think it's too much. We should decide what gets into the game, no the balance per se
---
I’m on the same path friend.
---
Training method for magic where you wear metal armour and a goblin staff to give you a huge negative magic bonus, which guarantees you won't do any damage, thus allowing you to keep autocasting on the same target forever.
---
Magic spells have a base xp that you get even if you do zero damage, but now if you're guaranteed to hit a zero, you won't get that base xp within these confines.
---
Not even close! I'd say in the 70s, maybe?

Bro I got mimic on my first master clue and I don't even want it I can't beat it :(

Because it would break combat mechanics if hits could be predicted like that.

Ah ok makes sense.

On a side note, unrelated to the person who actually answered me, good to see this honest question got downvoted , once again another solid reminder why I don't interact with this community. Cya nerds.

If you want to talk about shitty appearances, I started a btw the other week and I literally can’t find a free to play world to mine iron on without there being 5 obvious bots. Their names are all 123 firehose 765 and shit like that. How are these not super easy to ban?
---
&gt;Rwt does exist and it still does post bonds so as much as it helps it doesn’t cut it out entirely, so that’s not the strongest argument 
---
Unfortunately, you'll never remove RWT 100%.  However, a *lot* of people buy bonds still.  Even though it's more expensive, it doesn't carry a risk of getting banned like RWTing.
---
&gt;Why not let some credit card warriors get somthing more out of it, if they’re going to drop their money on the game they should be rewarded
---
The gp is plenty of reward imo, it allows those people to skip hours of moneymaking and just buy gear and go do fun things instead.  A cosmetic thing wouldn't be much more 'value' on top of that.
---
&gt;And they have added that purple skin which was only for twitch prime members for a period of time, how come no ones complaining about that, that is exactly what they’ve done here if I’m not mistaken, just given more options
---
People definitely did complain about it a bit, just not as much since it seemed like a one-time thing and not "here's 23 cosmetics we'd like to add".  Also a ton of people probably already had Twitch/Amazon Prime and didn't mind getting something extra; they might have cared more if it were something different that required a less common 3rd party purchase.
---
&gt;I don’t think the creators of the game would introduce stuff that breaks lore, they seem to love the game, and if you’ve seen their latest stream, they clearly state that they wouldn’t do anything like that, sure you might not believe them but also they are making the game you kinda have to take their word for it
---
Many people here lived through basically the exact situation with RS3. Devs promise that they care about the game, but eventually upper management get greedy and force them to add more and more MTX until the game is where it is now.  Unfortunately it doesn't matter how much the developers care if people above them who make decisions just want more money.  People here just don't want that to repeat, and will take a hard stance against monetizing content/items in any form.
---
&gt;otherwise why are you playing a game that you dislike? I get nostalgia but in that case why release ANY updates, they all kinda ruin osrs in a way don’t they
---
We like the way the game is now.  We aren't anti-update, we just don't want updates that move the game in a potentially bad direction.
---
bulwark only has one use and now people want to have it nerfed might as well just chuck the fucker lol

Doesn't change the fact that he's a bit of a dick. He made a video about an insanely cool accomplishment he did and turned it into a video about how he "beat" KempQ in a competition he made up. Like half of the video was about Kemp lol.
---
So if I shit on you in a game and call you a bot that means you're running a script? Or is it more like I beat you like you're not even functioning behind a monitor? Hmm that's kinda like a splasher... Not really giving any human attention to the game.

Ehm, I don’t think that’s the point the guy you replied to is trying to make.

Its not 10% dude its -10 in all defensive stats. It goes from 150+- to 140. Stop whining really. The development team is trying their hardest to bring us a nice game and all this subreddit does is whine whine whine. The worst of all is that  you're all 20+

That's kinda irrelevant since there are tons of other splashing locations where you don't need to factor in health regen. They just did lumbridge so it's not fugly for new players

Plus the 3m an hour I make rev pking lmao

Heavily botted items (like pure essence) were added to many drop tables to make them not worth botting. For example, Zulrah commonly drops 2500 essence at a time.
---
If you give pvp a chance 100 kills is nothing
---
Interesting
---
I would personally not recommend doing this. If a hijacker somehow gets access to your account, it's harder to recover without an email associated. As always the best security is to have 2FA on your email, 2FA on RuneScape associated to that email, and have a different and unique password for both. This way you guarantee a higher security while maintaining the ability to recover your account.
---
It's really fucking slow and you do have to click every few minutes
---
For reference, I have 8k kills
---
But... There is chance that I lose a arrow and hit 0. There for I lost arrow that cost me either time or coins but I didn't get anything back, not even exp. Meanwhile mages gets ALLWAYS exp no matter if they hit nothing, 0 or 1+. I understand that melee does not gain experience at 0 but rangers should if they lose arrow, i mean when the arrow doesn't end up just to ground but vanishes from the game rangers should get exp based on the lost arrow /bolt/dart/knife that hit 0 and vanished from game based on what material it is made from. Enchanted bolts would give same exp as non enchanted of the same bolt. Similar to the mages getting exp based on what spell is used.
---
not 10% just a flat 10 to the defensive stats. It'll give around an additional 2% chance to hit on it around the board.
---
I have seen him aswell. I actualy though it was an NPC for a few days... rofl

Yes you are missing something. Because they don't want to nerf splashing, they just want it to not be in Lumbridge

It's a cool idea but I think it's numerically too strong as it is. There should still be an advantage given to a group attacking you, even if this really helps against them. The prayer level would probably be better in the 56-58 range, there's kind of a lack of prayers in there anyway.

Manual casting cancer? Yeah i figured that would come up and i agree that you have to click much more during tasks. On the other hand, manual cast is not that bad in some barrage tasks, seeing how often you have switch your target (abyssal demons, lizardmen).

When I say come prepared to fight I mean full rune (g) and a dhally not something that's actually useful you asshat.

Yes, and if they relog they must change name

That money grind is. What you hiding behind that big shield of yours huh?! You stacking chins?! :P
---
Yeah.. I'm not even an avid pker like that man. I still try though, the clan I'm in does rev runs 24/7 so I try Bounty Hunter to practice 1v1s. Anyone can pile in a clan. I think pvp is held back by both the game and the community. With the combat system theres only so much we can do, but the community makes it worse by only wanting ez fights. Fuck stat look ups man

And if you die and lose the cape, can you get the untrimmed version back from the original npc?

TIA!

If you can buy it and still have vork gear, bgs and bp etc. Do it. Shaves so much time off the kill.

i just wish they went in a whole article detaling their reasons, the data, the expectations, context, etc instead of "heres the change, thoughts?" we're only left to assume outcomes based on our own experiences.

&gt; A list of a few things Jagex has done recently to cater to pures:
---
You mean to tell me that a handful of updates in 5+ years that affect ~10% of the population is a lot? In the hundreds of updates we've got? Really? So we should just shut the fuck up and get nothing forever?
---
&gt; Reworked the requirements of the Elf City quest to remove the defense requirement.
---
You mean remove the requirement to talk to 1 NPC *once*? Oh my god, game breaking.
---
&gt; Why are low level pking accounts getting to decide the requirements of an end game grandmaster quest?
---
Low level pking account? The low level pking account with Mourning's End completed? How about the hundreds of 2k+ total pures that are maxed except for defense, attack and prayer? Are we 'low level pking accounts'? I say hundreds, but chances are it's more like 1k+, since there's over 100 of us in my CC alone.
---
&gt;  Removing the prayer exp from the first 100 dragon bones after CHOOSING TO ATTACK Olbertus.
---
You mean correcting the mistake of having it award prayer, making it work as intended? That prayer exp?
---
&gt; This negatively affects all players.
---
Oh, fuck off. No it does not.
---
&gt; Trying AGAIN to bring negative exp lamps in the game.
---
I agree with you. I'm a pure, play exclusively on pures and I do NOT want negative exp lamps in the game. I worked hard to keep my combat how it is, why would I want everyone who did not limit themselves to gain every advantage I made sure to maintain over literal years? The pure community does ***NOT*** want negative exp lamps in the game (for the most part).

This is like when people complain there is too much traffic while being part of the traffic they are complaining about.

I play exclusively on pures and I'd love that. 99% of the time an update like this comes out we get shit on despite never asking for it. Why do people assume we're some kind of boogeyman? Is it because it's easy to hate pures due to most of us being PKers?

Except this is my first time on this sub in like 6 months and it hasn’t changed a bit

The only reason the servers are stable is because people don't see a need to DDOS anymore, they don't get the items. If it's brought back I guarantee you it'll start happening again.

It will be a maximum of -500 exp, once.

That takes effort and skill.  Why shouldn't it be rewarded?

Jmods have acknowledged prayer flicking anyways, and new content is balanced around it (see: inferno).  It won't get nerfed.

You can also use RuneLite's screenshot feature. No need to prtscrn + crop.

Splashing is done to train mage. You need -65 magic attack bonus (any full armour set) and you never kill the rat/chicken/whatever you're casting on, and you dont get hit because they're so low level. [Here is a full description](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Splashing_guide)

I'm serious, and don't call me Shirley.

&gt;Feathers used to be around 10gp each and pure essence was around 30gp each
---
Uhh....when did you play exactly? Like 2005 maybe? Things have changed really a lot, there are a lot of things that have changed to impact these two items. Specifically pure ess quite a lot.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cbbsvf/herblore_pet_wtf_im_shaking/) was the original post from a couple days ago, then someone came along and made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cbwgj1/alternate_reality/) swapping around the person and the sara brew yesterday. Then, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/cc72zy/alternate_alternate_reality/) was made a few hours ago, swapping around most everything, so I decided to 'up the ante' as swamp-man likes to say.
---
People still do this copy paste? Oh wow lol.
---
Bolas allow them to stay on normal spellbook so they can use tp block. It's also drastically cheaper than runes for barrage.
---
The crossover we never knew we needed
---
What good is 250k when the possibility of a skull trick exists and could cost anywhere from a few mill to 100m.
---
You are looking at convenience mostly, you weight prayer very highly even though it just reduces the rate at which prayer drains. I suppose that's relevant for a limited account that can't get a hold of prayer potions, but if I had a choice between an Avernic defender and infinite prayer I would always pick the defender. Meaning that no amount of prayer bonus is better than the 8 str and 29 slash.
---
 &amp;nbsp;
---
Think about this on the extreme end, if you could equip a 2h shield that give you immunity to damage but you could only hit for 1 would you ever use it to train with? No of course not, but it has infinite defense and according to your stat weights you should wear it over the offensive option because it weights higher.
---
I'm not trying to be mean or anything I'm trying to show you that the entire way you approached assigning weights to things is wrong from a pure time efficiency standpoint. If you want to do it this way because you don't care about time efficiency however then have at it there is nothing wrong with that.

This in addition to getting the drops? Or would you always keep your items?
---
If in addition to drops, I don't think anyone would risk it because you're effectively risking extra and might not get returns on it
---
If that becomes the new looting, then you could walk in with max gear and an empty coffer and have nothing to lose, which sounds busted

Thank you Mod Acorn! I thought it would make for a good laugh. (:

Yeah that's pretty solid, I think I'm like 850 chests and missing 3 items, but those three items might take another 1000 trips, so.

50/50 on if it's posted or not

The bulwark thing isn't getting polled so why use that as an example?

Wow huge difference stepping that 20k risk up to 80k surely you deserve to 1 bit anybody in any gear with this huge upgrade to mystics

i can completely understand the mindset of bringing your best gear for effeciency and not fighting back, but if your entire plan is to lie down and take it and never fight back then how can you complain that it is too easy to kill you?

I normally play the game on mobile and don't like doing bosses on my phone, so I can only fight the Hespori on my days off work on my desktop. I didn't have time to fight it last weekend, so this Hespori has been planted for ~2 weeks. I tried to fight it this morning and this happens. The flowers just keep opening and closing and I can't click any of them to attack them. The most attacking I can do is by auto-retaliating on the Hespori itself, but it doesn't take damage due to the flowers glitching. I've tried about 5 times today and nothing seems to work.

Theres another way you can do dks and you wont use as many supplies, but you will miss out on some drops..
---
 Take all the gear you currently have and go down. Kill supreme, then rex, then prime. Now stay in the corner you killed rex in and dont go near supreme.
---
 You wont agro him. You can pull rex back into the corner to kill him and prime will only attack if he gets close enough, in which case you should be able to attack him without agroing supreme. 
---
I started doing this after I got supreme pet so I could just grind the other 2. But it may help ypu get into soloing easier

It feels lame to trash on someone else for playing differently than you.
---
If youre praying mage the anti fire proc doesnt hit real hard anyway (which you can honestly just camp if you want since your range def is so high) and the amount of damage it does is rolled against that massive range def bonus. So the chances of a proc even hitting high is EXTREMELY low. The only people using d bolts are people with RCB anyway and that shit aint hitting through that ranged def, people using DCB/ACB are using opal bolts so thats irrelevant anyways.
---
&gt;Also science shows melee can not possibly hit on bulwark.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Sorry, no. Ur actually just trash at PKing. Sorry. Truth hurts
---
Im confused....what part was the truth though?
---
The argument isnt that melee cant hit AT ALL (I mean he did say PRACTICALLY, I guess you just selectively read) its that it is true that it wont hit WAY more often than it would. Theres also this thing called Melee pray, that setup+melee pray= Yes, practically invincible to melee damage. Have you ever actually even tried killing someone in this setup or tanked in this setup before? It sounds like you havent. 
---
So I guess youre trash at pking if you cant hit through this setup and prayers, no matter what gear youre wearing? Ill welcome you to to get in max gear and ill get in my dinhs tank setup and you can see how hard it is to hit even with max gear. If you know how to actually tank and switch prays, good luck hitting on that.

How to be a pmod these days: be a popular streamer.
---
I've been in your boat, but I'd suggest getting a torso regardless.  BCP and tassets were also a goal of mine, but I only bought it after my bank was worth 500m since there are dozens of better upgrades.  BCP and tassets honestly aren't used nearly as much as things like blowpipe, rigour, DHCB, occult/anguish/torture.  But depending on your other goals, you can certainly get it early, but just know it's not valuable in terms of helping you make more money.
---
Especially these days
---
Imagine working a minimum wage job for one hour and being able to pay for a full month of membership.

Its a completionist item lol. Sometimes u gotta grind

Cause putting personal information on reddit is 300iq.  If we could get a jmod to look over the information I could show them
---
No worries haha, I believe we've all done this at some point 😂
---
Who bothers for 2m
---
I wish there was more mid level content, as a skiller the only thing unique to the Wilderness is locked behind such high levels such as Rogue's chests, Dark crab fishing, Runite mining, etc.
---
I wish there was some sort of XP buff or something that encourages going into the Wilderness and doing stuff there, even if it means to fight, people can learn
---
This works. Even for nmz
---
I would of fell for this when I first started playing (mobile releases). But I only watch twitch via my Xbox and it actually wouldn’t open the links on the console. So after that I started doing research and learned it was a scam. So luckily me being a peasant on console saved my runescaping career.
---
Occasionally no I don’t. I give out food and gp here and there, gave a guy some full armor as well when he needed it

People keep saying this but are we sure we're not just projecting our ruined nostalgia on actual new players

This post was so confusing, then I realised you're talking to yourself with the second part.

How many people you know are camping a boss on 5 accounts at the same time without botting?
---
I do, and the way 70% of pkers run when you fight back shows how true this meme is
---
In members you can pretty much quest your way to 45 combat level in about 5 or 6 hours, and get all of your non combats to 30+ just through quests.    
---
That alone is worth it.  The alternative is like 2 weeks of grinding those skills.   
---
You can wield addy weapons without ever doing a single bit of combat.

Not many hopefully, at least two now though.

Lol everybody is happy about both

Go to wilderness altar in 2k and 2.2k worlds. Every now and then you'll see a full team come through and try to take people out. It's very possible to tank a team with Dinh's.
---
Or I guess you could just think about the defensive bonuses of bulwark (very good for everything except mage) combined with how magic defence works in the game. The bulwark is irrelevant when it comes to magic. It's just ridiculous against range and melee. 
---
Now think about how it's very common for people to bring claws or AGS as melee spec weapons with a tent whip even if not in max. It's also very common for pkers to bring dcbs or ballistas even if they're not in max.
---
This is the problem with having an open world esport where anyone can play, no way to make sure people aren't cheating. I guess Jagex could require in game footage of the winning player?
---
They've announced they'll be bringing on figureheads from e-sports, so hopefully they'll be able to fix the issue of people cheating.

im a cunt and i also give a pass.

Anyone who tells you they were falsely banned for macroing is probably lying.

Wasn't someone able to get bots up and running again after the original bot nuke? I feel like the nuke would only be a temporary solution.
---
If this meme is false explain why someone with no risk, dihn's and black d hide enrages so many pkers. Hint: it's because it's not about the challenge or the loot, clearly.
---
he wasn't banned for multilogging. He was banned for macroing.
---
I guess I should have been clearer about a few things.
---
* I settled on a gold boost because ultimately, if wildy fights (PKer vs. PKer) are to become more popular, the PKing needs to become a positive-sum game. The mechanics were designed to be somewhat hard to prevent farming.
---
* Totems only need to be awakened once and they only need to be reactivated when you die. You can leave the wilderness with active totems and come back without having to reactivate them. Shards break upon leaving the wilderness, but totems remain active. You can also activate them one at a time.
---
I’m sure some people do. Nobody however, sees the point you thought you were making.
---
I played for 3 and a half months, for a total of 750ish hours. Quit a few months ago but I'm still glued to this sub.
---
gl with that
---
Hot take: If pkers really wanted fair fights then they’d all meet up at duel arena and just fight there and make wagers
---
Ok ill add you
---
Didn't they poll this year's ago? Maybe remembering wrong but I think it was overwhelmingly no
---
Don’t need it, but thanks
---
probably being the operative word. except I've already been FALSELY BANNED AND uNBANED SO my record is 1 - 0 right now.

If a Jmod actually decides to acknowledge my existence i firmly believe we'll be going 2 - 0.

keep up the hard work and you will continue to improve :)

As opposed to the pvmer toxic majority on reddit who would literally use their voting power to remove the wilderness if given the chance?

There's always a multitude of free corp worlds. It's not as if he's ruining anyone else's experience by playing 5 accounts.

Eh, even with bursting tasks I haven’t had to buy chaps runes since like 65 slayer. It’s a useful way to go through the stack that bursting doesn’t use.

---
Yes, you can get muted. Most people who lure rwt and get banned as well.
---
Id rather that then changing game mechanics in certain areas
---
What a shame. All that work down the toilet. I hope you get this sorted out friend. So, certain ways of clicking or the way you play could be logged as botting?
---
mind = blown

thanks

The main function of defense is that you take less damage

same, i've actually been keeping busy with some productive things since monday so the soul crushing aspects of what is happening hasn't really hit me except for like right before bed and other random times when I think in depth about this.
---
yep. this is what i want. a fast boss where the goal is to outlast it while still actively engaging with it as opposed to just smacking away at it until it dies
---
John Maynard Keynes predicted that by this point in time we’d all be working 15 hours a week. With current wages, that would not be feasible without UBI. Fact of the matter is not that people are lazy but that automation and increased productivity has cut the number of available jobs, especially for unskilled laborers. UBI is probably the best solution to automation killing jobs I’ve heard besides FULLY AUTOMATED LUXURY GAY SPACE COMMUNISM
---
Im just here for the smack down glhf to all participants.
---
Yeah, you admit to using AHK about a minute into the video on your first post.  Jagex has said that AHK is sometimes indistinguishable from botting and I'm betting that the bans were deserved.
---
Yes you need 6 best in slot items for 1 best in slot item. Thanks for agreeing with me.
---
Easy to bring better gear when you don’t risk a single piece of gold in pvm.
---
It’s actually quite interesting how stupid you people are. The mental gymnastics resulting from the hatred you have for pkers is almost sad.
---
same
---
I'm amazed that to this day people still think the Wilderness is meant to be a fair and safe place
---
I rarely ever believe anyone about this, but I’m like 99.999% sure you’re telling the truth. You’ll definitely get it back, don’t worry
---
That's not pking /s
---
Smoke devils are garbage money but great xp
---
If you want a tip as I've figured out how Jagex's macro ban detection works it's this:
---
Any macro input aside from windows keys is a +1 to your session macro limit. I want to say around 3000 inputs but it could be reasonably less, and the moment you lobby your account is sent to the shadow realm with the quickness.
---
Doesn't matter if it's as simple as keybinds or remote play for actually making the game more manageable to enjoy, still triggers their own filthy bots.
---
Thank you, I guess?
---
damn son you going in
---
Every pker ever would tell you it’s the most broken item ever
---
I can say that it is an unorthodox method to play the game and at a cursory glance (i.e. unprofessional) it might appear to be macroing, but assuming their system is more than just blindly banning thing, a thorough review of the accounts should reveal that all the interactions with the game are manual and result in the bans being quashed.
---
you know, in an ideal world.
---
Who hurt you?
---
what many people are saying is that the shield should be strong as you have no intention of fighting back, but that its TOO strong. one guy said that top ranked hunter skillers dont even need to bank anymore because they can tank to the wildy ditch even against a best in slot pker
---
let me ask you this, lets say there was a shield which LITERALLY made you unkillable. like 100% of all types of damage was reduced to zero. would you agree with that? because that is what this shield is almost like, it is too powerful
---
Automation killing jobs is a meme. We're still using conveyor belts ffs
---
Those 3 banned accounts sure have a high magic level....
---
No, just regular accounts. You can just stake and win a bunch of money and buy everything on a regular account, else you're just wasting time in the salt mines. And if it isn't already, the collection log will soon be client side so once you wipe your PC all that data will be gone anyway.
---
Wtf really... that’s what’s up but than where am I going to feed my kitten at?
---
I hate to hear that you've lost your cousin and from the sound of it one of your best friends. The just glad that reddit isn't being its usual self, but instead giving you and Shane the respect you deserve in such a time of tragedy. I hope you and your family find closure soon.
---
The shipping tool does automatically copy it to your clipboard, or at least there is a setting to make it do so. Which means you can then go to any image hosting website you want and just hit control+V. I like the snipping tool
---
yeah lol i mean i played a lot when i was 12 but i didnt play from  the age of 13-25 so i wouldnt say i played 10+ years...
---
Support but only if each jump has the chance of failing, you have to navigate the entire perimeter of the city, and graceful only spawns on completion of lap at the end of the course.
---
Now that you can play on the phone, I have no place to escape this game 😬😬😬
---
I usually pk with around 80m risk and 200m gear since i always bring kodai/arcane and dihn still tanks it easily, so making the "gear cost" argument is just dumb
---
Brimhaven blue. Or that black model that has been designed!
---
It's used for simple 50/50 staking and you're not going to get that idea out of people's heads.
---
I'm not sure about old polls but if so, maybe it was guided towards actually lowering the whole level? My proposal is only lowering it to the lowest xp possible for the "current level" that you have. 
---
Example: if you happened to get 61 attack, these lamps wouldn't get you to 60. I'm not sure if it was polled this way in the past or not. I don't see this hurting anyone, especially since there is no level reducing.
---
Love it!
---
It’s not, but many of the complaints I’ve heard from the PvP community are that there aren’t enough other pkers to fight
---
Stop making stupid people famous
---
Reread what i said u idiot
---
Soo basically what every Jmod 'smackdown' amounts to then? What's your point?
---
The wild is better loot with more opportunities to kill. Pvp world are used mostly by rushers/voiders/dharoks etc, and duel arena is for staking, not tribridding. The question should be reversed actually, if pvmers don’t want to get killed for spades why do they want a dead wilderness where You can chase people through 40 levels of wild without seeing a single other pker
---
Because he's full of shit and doesn't actually know.
---
You're 100% right i got the best items i could to continue grinding zulrah so not mad at all. I really want the pet so i don't mind grinding zulrah for a long time.

You can solo raids 1

There is no "anti bot camera change" anymore. That was a thing a long time ago

---
What will your plans be if you don't get them back? Do you think you'll call it a day with RS and move onto something else? Or?
---
If you had bothered to read the whole thread you'd see I calculated the proper possibility of getting a B2B in 771 attempts by first calculating the odds of not getting any
---
1 - (8999999/9000000)^771
---
It just coincides that, for very rare events, you can approximate it by the number of attempts times the probability. But I even comment to the other guy that it doesn't make mathematical sense.
---
It just so happens that the answer to the question the poster asked on the title should be the odds of getting a B2B in however many attempts he's done. So yes, the events and independent and the chance of each will always be 1/9m, but the overall chance of it happening is much less rare since he rolled it a bunch of times.
---
Private is set to friends already
---
Just keep setting goals, diaries are super long term, it took me 6 months when I set my goal. You'll need level 5 in all roles in B.A., you'll need a kq head, you'll have to gradually get 77 runecrafting before the real grind begins, you'll need to kill a lot of chompies, full Angler and Prospector, there's so much diversity in diaries :)
---
It took me 15 min to walk across the map for the video, i can only imagine how long it will take to drop across it

Not applicable here i think

Why not? Why would you want people to know that youre just gonna scam them out of g? Thats hiw you make less money.

fucking hell. amazing meme but too relevant

Gilded D'hide would be the Gold Ranger (Power Rangers Zeo).

I still have a large number of decent accounts beyond these three that were lost but yes. I can not in good conscience continue dumping 2/3rds of my day time into something that can arbitrarily be denied by the powers that be.

Maybe I will make my own RuneScape :)
---
Haha would be fun tho.
---
When have raids ever been considered a minigame for all levels?
---
Only if we buff dds and nerf g maul too
---
"that would make it easier for cheaters to cheat"
---
Its not really a 'mini game for all levels'. Its a very PvM heavy dungeon to complete, with skilling aspects. Its not meant to be easy.
---
dam, tru.
---
I know Reddit’s opinion doesn’t matter but the fact is people post “false bans” every day lol go post on their threads that Reddit’s opinion doesn’t matter I’m just using fair judgement rather then accepting what is told to me at face value.
---
I think it would be terrible to be falsely banned. I like to have some hope in the jmod team to do a good job with this kind of thing. I understand no one is perfect and false positives are a reality but the facts are you are presenting to us your side of the story and no one here outside of a jmod has any way to determine it being true.
---
I can respect that decision. As much as I imagine it sucks for you cause you clearly enjoy the game. I can understand the thought process that would've led you to make it. Have you tried tweeting at Jagex or any of the Jmods?
---
ahuh this is the only game to ever attempt to balance its content ay
---
They said in their last QA the bot detection had been increased because of the free membership thing
---
I cant do raids and i have high stats (mid80's) you just gotta know yo place till you ready fam
---
legend for typing this up. completely agree.
---
Absolutely lol
---
Because there are items that you can make with as little as 20 herblore or 20 fishing?
---
I think raids 3 should scale down to most level brackets... but since when is endgame content for devoted players a bad thing?
---
I was, on my alt account. I never even used it so I didn't pursue it, but I found it strange they didn't even let me appeal it. Like "Nah 100% banned mate, we caught your ass botting" on an account that had negligible stats.
---
Minigame for all levels?? Since when? It is and was always meant to be an end game game PvM experience.
---
Had same thing, this made me realize appeal system doesn't even work or anyone actually looks at the accounts. No idea how could they think i was botting, and even after "checking" which they most likely don't to confirm it
---
Doing strength to 99 first would be the most efficient if you are staying at NMZ, but it's not a big deal if you want to get them all up to 85/90 before starting the 99 grind.
---
How so? I barely played FoG back in the day, so the memories are FoGgy and I don't have a good point of reference.

You just said that PKing isn't for profit, so it doesn't matter how much the PVMer is risking. If your gear isn't worth the same range (not the value you'd drop on death), then you don't have room to bitch about struggling to kill people going tankmode.

I mean, obviously seeing cheating amounts of progress is going to be more fun than playing normally. Just playing Devil's Advocate. Your case doesn't look as strong from the outside.

Yea, tbh I think they all have me muted or are just selectively ignoring me.

Anyone knows if you unlock music in tournament worlds thar you keep on regular worlds? Cause it's the only thing he can do to prove he never left.

If it makes you feel any better I did it fir reddit karma. I dont actually play rs while running the combine

I mean it still helps pkers more than that fucking Zammy wine spawn that they considered to be a PvP update. That was pretty insulting.

That would be nice tbh, but I've already got one foot out the door at this point.

Nice repost m8

A trim on your cape means that you have more than one skill at level 99, so you will only be able to get the trimmed version of the fletching cape. Once you get 99 fletching, your cooking cape will be automatically trimmed as well, unless you do some fancy jiggery-pokery.
---
this guys a troll, don't feed him
---
I was just joking in regards to their comment about the investment. Was the first thing I came up with then thinking of completely useless items that some random person probably has stocked up
---
How often have you tried? The problem with ba is that once 1 person leaves, you basically have to start over. Could've just been that you had some asshole teammates, but if it's like this for more than 10 games the only common denominator is you and you're probably performing worse than you think.
---
Just keep on trying, and try to get teammates with around the same combat level as you so they don't feel held back by you.
---
This isn’t about pvmers. I was just asking why don’t people tribrid fight at duel arena
---
This is footage of you killing the Corp. I’m not naive enough to think you are botting the boss lol. The fact that you’re playing 5 accounts that needed to be trained/quested/geared/whatever any step of that process of readying the accounts of anything else you do with them could have been done with macros.
---
These posts literally happen every day and you are acting like people don’t bot stats on alts or even their main.
---
Strawman
---
If something is too hard, what's the point of playing any game then? Make goals and challenge yourself. Go for achievement diary if you enjoy the grind. Go for inferno cape if you want a challenge. Learn CoX (seriously its not that bad. Im still a newb at it and managed not to die to olm by 4kc. Just get a good teacher).
---
Also if you're willing to wait, the gauntlet from the upcoming quest had some good feedback from the internal playtesters.
---
Not enforced at all
---
legit
---
Only if the account has existed for more than 30 days. If it’s brand new you won’t be able to change names.
---
I do tbh, but that's why I'm a pker. Only real reason to pk tbqh
---
Thanks for your criticism. 
---
However I don’t agree. Teams could camp locations but only one person would receive points. If multiple people would be in the area no points would be acquired. Therefore it would be kind of useless to bring a whole team as it would only be around 1-1.5m per hour for the whole team. 
---
About the lvl 69 dominating, I do agree this could be a (minor) problem.  This issue was also with bounty hunter back in the day, but I still loved it. In this situation lvl 90s could still come and kill the 69 just so they would receive his keys and loot.
---
Just stick to vork and wyverns, rather than flooding reddit with nonsense.
---
Hey man, i recommend covering up your total xp if you don't want your account to get hacked.

Friggin sweet lois

Forget swampletics, the storming of al kharid is where it’s at

&gt;Nobody's whining, but Jamflex is just randomly putting the change through as an unpolled update
---
D O U B T
---
well, I don't have 5 years worth of footage to show you the arduous process of creating the accounts to the point that I can do this but suffice to say, THIS IS MY LIFE.
---
Smokes break even assuming you pick up drops and occults.
---
Why not bring better gear into the wildy?  If you're trying to kill people in strong gear, maybe you should also bring strong gear.  Or do you think you're going to die in the wilderness?  Kinda like the rest of us.  Kinda like those who decided to bring tank gear and *not* attack other people to take their shit.
---
If you want to attack people, you have to risk stuff.  If you want to attack bigger targets with better gear, you'll have to risk better stuff.  It's pretty simple.  If you're not willing to risk it, stop bitching about it.  Maybe the wilderness isn't for you if you're too scared to risk it.
---
Not gonna lie, I had the same reaction.
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
fucking love the snipping tool
---
I’d join you. Add psacz.
---
Are you an Optoma UHD60? Cause you sure are good at projecting.
---
ITS NOW OR NEVER!!
---
You could argue that, absolutely. 
---
Firing an arrow with the intent to miss is incredibly easy and requires almost no experience and wouldn't net you a positive experience for doing so.
---
Casting a magic spell still requires you to convert the components of the spell into magical energy. That's where the experience comes from.
---
Love how retarded reddit is as usual. Pkers are the one that asked for the gmaul nerfs u stupid fucks
---
I call blasphemy on them for that. This is absurd, and your accounts look so colorfully sound as well.
---
There are a few factors you're ignoring. 
---
What if they got hacked on their main and had to start from scratch?
---
How would we even verify total level? Should everyone in this subreddit have to get it touch with a mod in game and have the mod look them up in hiscores then tell them their reddit username? Then the mods have to keep track of all of these names and update them when the player levels. 
---
Then why does total level matter at all? I could be lvl 126 and have a low total level but still be able to do end game content. But because my total level was too low, I'm a noob in your ideal subreddit. 
---
Also (bear in mind for this one that I'm fairly new to reddit) is there even a way to filter someone out based on a made up filter?
---
“Did I stutter?”
---
Again, irrelevant. There are numerous samples of people getting temporary bans strictly for using his method. Why didn't they receive the same punishment? Because there is more data that is not being disclosed to us. Until we know what it is, we can't conclude anything.
---
Pkers bad, pvm good
---
this is exactly spot on. death in this game meant something when I was a kid, now it is a minor inconvenience at worst. This mentality has rooted itself deeply and now anytime death actually has repercussions it is seen as a terrible thing rather than business as usual.
---
I don't need zammy wines so i'm voting no
---
nooo for so many reasons!
---
A couple:
---
Not everyone wants their reddit account linked to their osrs account.
---
I can't even imagine the amount of effort that would be required by  the mods to do this.
---
Looking back at the blog post you are correct the limit I’m talking about isn’t mentioned. It was in the original idea that was polled to stop OP account builds from happening.
---
Good, can only hope the rest of your accounts get perm banned soon as well.
---
Cuz if you ban one there's another there within 3 minutes.
---
Well I'm voting no because I'm 99 Herblore already.
---
no it isn't, they've said they do every single one manually
---
I have 73M gold yea i did a lot of skilling
---
Right.  But if you're all novices you have no one to rely on.  And that's the Skilling requirements. Combat wise it's designed for 115+ combat level players (and there's actually a penalty if your group's average combat level is below 115).  It's not mid level content or content for all levels - it's endgame content, a goal to aim for at the end of your journey
---
The last time I Pk'd was probably in 2007, on a pure. I hopped onto a beta world yesterday and had a blast. I am terrible at it, but it was fun and I could feel the improvements I was making.
---
Oh, thanks, thought it was odd
---
While I agree it's a false ban, I can totally see why you could be banned.  It looks VERY suspect until you actually see it visualised.
---
Too bad you don't have to learn anything other than auto casting barrage.
---
I think you're a bot.
---
How does this even work?
---
Remind me! 1 day
---
YouTuber KempQ rwt'd a bunch of gold on his main account resulting in a permanent ban of said account (all of his alts were left untouched).
---
Do you have rigour? Much better investment than chins especially if you have a low slayer lever
---
Not really an option within that Lumbridge area, the only thing that would regenerate fast enough to survive would be mobs with high magic levels or naturally boosted HP regen, neither of which exist there.  Also the intent is just to force splashers to not be in Lumby, nothing else.
---
Hilarious but more pve players use combat bracelet than pvpers
---
Yea i did a lot of skilling before i did combat stats and i have some gold im at sand crabs afking for 75 till i get blow pipe
---
Unless there is a better way to train ofcourse and faster way
---
you didn't read the entire thing did you
---
Did they even say "no racial" in the ban reasons
---
Sorry what is Rigour?
---
I've messaged the JagexSupport reddit. Runescape official website just keeps sending me in a circle. I need some technical support about an account registered with an email I'm not using anymore (no longer have legal access to it). I'm still new to reddit as far as how the posting of such comments go. Send halp ples.
---
Mod Mark probably.
---
&gt; Judging by the ~~boots and cape~~ everything, he doesnt know wtf he is doing.
---
Fixed for you.
---
You can't recover runes like you can with arrows
---
&gt; That takes effort and skill.  Why shouldn't it be rewarded?
---
did you not read what I said? " pray flicking allows you to have an infinite amount of prayer pots but using 0 inventory space "
---
what does effort and skill have to do with anything? It's just plain broken. If there was an GP dupe in game that required *effort and skill* to pull off, would that be ok? Well no. What if there was an item dupe? No, that wouldn't be OK either. What if the item dupe only applied to prayer pots? N..Yes?! What do you mean a prayer pot dupe is ok? "Well it takes effort and skill  to pull off so it should be rewarded" No. It's broken.
---
&gt; new content is balanced around it (see: inferno) 
---
This is also incorrect.
---
once a day plant the best fruit tree you can plant, bring money and stuff to pay the gardener with, and don't forget calquats too. It doesn't take more than 5 minutes a day man...
---
Right, but again, literally **every** smackdown has just been the Jmod saying words. They don't offer screenshots, logs, not a single spec of actual *PROOF* someone botted, just their word, and you accept that as gospel. 
---
You didn't answer my question. How would you prove that you didn't bot?
---
You just got banned for it, Jmods said you botted because of something they detected, but you know you didn't. Now what? How does anyone actually prove their own innocence unless they were recording every solitary second of their own gameplay? Why are you so quick to dismiss other peoples' word for not being proof when there's absolutely no way to give proof that they didn't bot sans that?
---
I wanna know this too
---
They also kick puppies
---
Ahhh PVMers still salty as ever. I will make sure to throw some extra colorful insults at you when I pk your spade next time
---
Hahahahah, youre right, sorry.
---
you take so much more damage with bp. 6 kills with dhcb is way better than 3 kills bp. plus you have to constantly tele out and respec. dhcb will be more kills per hour.
---
If you hate farming, I'd prioritize the following:  
---
Mahogany/Teak Trees &gt; Hespori Boss when possible &gt; Regular Tree Runs &gt; Fruit Tree Runs &gt; Adding Snapegrass to Herb runs &gt; Herb runs  
---
I used to hate farming because it felt so slow, when I was only doing herb runs. Adding in the various trees made me blast through levels like crazy. Somehow it's at 86 and my highest non-combat skill now. Regular trees are super expensive and not really worth your time *unless* you despise farming so much even after doing all the other things in that priority list.  
---
If you don't mind, what's your farming level?
---
Literally everyone said do slayer
---
Go for 99 agility
---
True, but you do have the staves that save you like, all of your runes, so the only cost is the one rune per cast that isn't covered by your staff
---
If i get slayer tasks like cows its not effective for me
---
Uh, any links?
---
Want proof?
---
What is my flawed opinion?
---
Wtf thats just dumb
---
A prayer that boosts your range accuracy, damage, and defense at 74 prayer. Easily worth the investment for the pray levels and rigour will help you get ranged levels much quicker, as well as help with killing bosses and whatnot. You have to unlock the prayer by consuming a dexterous prayer scroll that is a reward from raids and it cost a little over 50m rn
---
Grind crafting for a jewelry upgrade, do you have baseline end game barrows items? (V skirt, k top, etc), fire cape? DK rings? Slayer grind for uniques. Brah you have so many things
---
And beside i dont even know where to find all the monsters
---
Is there a list or something where i can search the monster and i shows me om the map where they are?
---
nobody asked you
---
You don’t understand the game fundamentally and when people tell you what’s best you decline to do it because you think you know better despite claiming to be new
---
What is it? 
---
Are you new or an expert?
---
Slayer is effective training at all combat levels and is some of the best money in the game. The longer you wait to do it the dumber you are without exaggeration
---
I mean I've seen many other people as well as myself die asking slayer tasks
---
I don't want to live forever?
---
Back around 2005 i was at my friends house watching him play runescape when we saw a level 30 something thieving from master farmer, i told him to go call her a noob, he did but with more explicit language, and it was a p mod, he got muted
---
Taking screenshots with phone to trigger people, or stupid you decide....lol
---
I have only got 64 Prayer at this moment
---
I was buzy getting full void and afking at sand crabs
---
Yea I got super spooked for a second. Game would not be where it is without him. If he ever quit it'd be a major setback for the company.
---
It's weird that Jagex doesn't consider this cheating. I'm okay with people playing multiple accounts if they're say playing OSRS and RS3 at the same time, playing a main and an iron man, or just 2 accounts with no interaction. But, I feel like using multiple accounts in cooperation with each other or trading all the wealth onto a main for more gain is definitely cheating.
---
Most of which are pretty awful to watch anyways. Skillspecs particularly can go fuck himself.
---
Trash account. Should’ve got it at 69 or 73.
---
The must never ever ever ever ever ever visit the GE, then. Or if they do, then they don’t mind the bots there 24/7 using macros and running games of chance.
---
Your logic is bad and you should feel bad
---
Believe the word of obvious botters over Jagex if you want, it doesn’t make any sense but it’s your right I guess
---
Never said i thought i was a veteran but i know im sure as hell not a new player lmao
---
If the man said he didn’t but Jagex said he did, he did. This isn’t some conspiracy
---
I disagree on a couple points. The cosmetic rewards were designed to fit the theme of the game because once the promotion is over, we're stuck with them as a permanent part of the game. We're going to have ugly ass purple dudes running around Gielinor until the end of time because of that Twitch promo. If they're going to add any cosmetics, they need to fit in with the game.
---
When it comes to attracting new players with a promotion, it doesn't really matter what the exclusive content is. Like you said, if someone who has never played the game sees their Twitch Prime Loot gives them something on OSRS, they won't have a clue what any of the loot actually means. It can be total trash, because they won't know the difference. The whole point is just to add another bullet point to the page of rewards.
---
Jagex did extensive focus group testing to determine what rewards players would be okay with. They specifically tried to find worthless shit. According to Mod Ash, it was Mod Mat K running these focus groups, so it's not even like it was the greedy evil execs at Jagex trying to bleed us dry. It was the mods we like who genuinely thought this was going to be no big deal, which is why their follow-up blog post was so passive aggressive. They singled out players in focus testing and they all said "yeah that's fine" but when they presented it to the playerbase as a whole we assumed it was a conspiracy theory to put XP lamps in McDonald's happy meals.

Yeah, except Area 51.

Right but what does wearing it at the altar of sun do?
---
Tbh 1 will get me from 13 to 11 def that may still be a combat level I believe so I'm happy with that

It was in my fucking bank. I hate myself. Thank you so much, I didn't even think about that because I'm a dummy. Thanks!!

I didn't even realize it being in my bank already was an option. I hate myself lol. Thank you so much.
---
Plenty of websites sell them if you just search for proxies, but proxyfish is the most common one I believe you just check 'bulk order' to get a good deal its pretty much the same on every site.
---
It was in my bank and I'm officially an idiot. Thanks!
---
I didn’t see this earlier but did you use anything that would allow you to click the same place at the same time on multiple clients?
---
so photoshopped
---
Yea kinda too now you say it.
---
There will never be balance in pvp a game like this. Yall just have to accept runescape pvp is outdated
---
If they ignore me long enough eventually I'll just go away, probably.
---
dude this is some genuine bullshit, so many people use more than 1 acc at a time, i don’t understand why yours have been banned, im actually upset for you and i hope everything gets resolved.
---
How are they supposed to see macros? And mutes only last an hour so chances are the gambling bots you've seen have been muted a few times already
---
Idk lol 🤷‍♀️
---
Just get used to F keys where escape is log out :) Takes a day, quick log outs for life.
---
I uninstalled, don't worry
---
no, all my clicks are manually sent to each individual account serially.
---
Im gonna go with the latter
---
oh my god....
---
Reee anything that adds difficulty makes me mayud
---
sad to here man
---
Shit happens!, all that matters is that you got it and can complete the quest :)
---
lmfao i literally do the same thing. even a 3 hour drive would save me a few hours.
---
Oh, definitely.
---
A blowpipe kill is about 30k cost in supplies.
---
too bad the only actual recourse is to stop playing but everbody is too addicted to RS to go this far, especially for someone else.
---
Might need some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help fix that...
---
I got confused cause I am so used to reading panels right to left.
---
dude ive been thinkin this forever, having to tote around a neck of passage everywhere is so inconvenient.
---
owes?
---
Didn't realize he had been around for so long.
---
OSRS takes a sip still the goat from smokey
---
I think either Menaphos or they've said they wanted to add some quests and lore to the area added with Raids 2. I'd be happy for either.
---
Lol are you saying the pvm community isn't just as toxic?
---
You went to GE and didn’t add the dice bot to ignore?
---
It was probably just auto removed because enough ppl reported it
---
No I use the dice bot
---
what does the word "mainly" mean to you and how did you get that im pretending the wildy is only pvp.
---
Also yes i accept my risk is from other players just like they have to risk from me, but you should not be able to run around doing stuff that makes good money or xp gains with 0 risk yourself since you are carrying a dihn's. Its like imagine if Revs were in a single target non pvp area, it would be so fking broken, but taking down a dihn there is impossible as a solo pker. and before you go and say "well maybe you just suck" ive put over 2k hours into pvp and made top 16 deadman 3 times playing solo with no swapping or getting fed so i like to believe im decently versed in pvp
---
I would personally absolutely love this!
---
Kind of hurts the "high xp rate but click intensive" idea. Probably gonna vote no unless it includes a small xp nerf
---
The plank has a green pixel on it!
---
Use ahk to bind keys, I do this to use bottom row keys instead of f keys
---
This would stop me dead in my tracks.
---
you'll have to tweet @jagexsupport as reddit doesn't really do the Customer Support job
---
Jokes on them I don't check my email
---
That’s every subreddit. Reddit as a whole is an echo chamber driven by mass opinion (upvotes)
---
Now there's a true player that enjoys the game without caring about xp rates.
---
Good rule of a thumb to spot real email from Jagex is that the email speaks to you as your in-game name. Scam emails obviously cannot do so, so always check does the email contain your rsn before you open ANY links on it.

---
you can try asking on their support discord, though it's honestly no help. I've been asking the same question about a pretty major bug for a few months now and not a single person ever responds to me there.
---
Bonus cause I'm bored and technically you asked:  
---
Herb runs:  
---
Tools: Spade, Rake, Seed Dibber, (Magic) Secateurs, Ultracompost for each patch  
---
Seeds: Ranarr, Limpwurt  
---
Locations:
---
* Northern part of Catherby
---
* Southeast of Falador at the farm (north of Port Sarim)
---
* North of Ardougne
---
* Northwest of Port Phasmatys
---
* In Zeah southwest of Xeric's Talisman (glade) teleport. 
---
* Farming Guild (once you have high enough farming level to access)
---
* Trollheim patches (once you've done the quests to access it)
---
Actions: Plant seed into herb patch, ultracompost it, limpwurt into flower patch, ultracompost (regular compost works too) it, go to next location. Rinse and repeat for a free 50-100k per run.   
---
Pro tip: you can Use herbs, fruit, etc on the Tool Leprechaun to note them, to save on inventory space.
---
Yeah, that point is probably now. 
---
Up until evidence/reddit/twitter etc gets involved they probably just consider the auto-ban a "job done"
---
Plenty of clicking still.. it doesnt make it anymore afk, just less tedious
---
&gt;but you should not be able to run around doing stuff that makes good money or xp gains with 0 risk yourself since you are carrying a dihn's
---
Why not? You already waste a ton of time world hopping to avoid griefers so that hurts efficiency enough already. Plus there actually is some risk of dying, even with the shield.
---
I was about to suggest this because the same thing happened to me with a different bone a few hours ago
---
You could flick for a kill or two if you only need a little extra prayer, but maybe that's too tryhard for Vork
---
This guy posts nothing but troll topics. Way to go m8
---
Ahh the good old days where if you wanted to buy full black gold trimmed you had to sit you ass in a bank (fally West Bank or varrock  West Bank) all fucking day just to buy that or other items that was the shit....
---
you could have near max on all necessary skills for raids 1 and be around 1400 total. Your point isn't really a point.
---
With that setup the chance that you splash 14 times in a row is roughly 0.0061%, that's some though luck.
---
🦀W🦀H🦀Y🦀
---
You could, but then you’d have an otherwise generally shitty specific built account. That’s not realistic for the average casual player.
---
This but unironically.
---
I have had people tell me to stop safing when running away with a bulwark.
---
Way less braindead in terms of combat and skilling
---
I agree with your disagreements :)
---
As I said to another commentor, I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm62FB3Q6fQ) to be very helpful in explaining why new players have such a hard time getting into the game.
---
This is bullshit. Plenty of people play more than 1 acct at a time
---
He should've started slayer first. Noob mistake sadly.
---
explaination: https://twitter.com/skill_specs/status/1148943370422591489?s=09

Unlocked it, logged into a P2p world and it told me to log into a f2p world. That's when it stopped making sense,
---
When the only thing you do is play runescape and the game may become slightly easier, the result is a bunch of losers taking actual offense to it.
---
Accurate. Half the time Im grinding something and I hate myself for it.
---
Yup, but you just gotta keep at it for years basically, lol
---
Didn't realize there was even a difference. That's -2 ranged and no damage bonus instead of +3 and +15% damage. The ultimate unit.
---
Im pretty sure you get the nest when you open the clue nest, same as with seeds
---
I unlocked it with my email.
---
I don't know, I really love this game.
---
To be fair I've gone out with Staff of Light, Mystics, and a Seers Ring, and still just don't bother with Bulwark users
---
Lol for sure. I don't even have a pure anymore but a max 75 attk and def med to pk on while mostly playing a hardcore. My med was a pure a couple years ago but it was just so depressing to everyone pures get new and cool stuff constantly and pures never getting anything. All while being treated like you're entitled. There was a top of front page post with a shit load of upvotes whining that jagex should stop catering to pures all the time... the level of delusion in crazy. So anyways I'll always keep sticking for the 1 def bros
---
Hmm its friday 8pm for jamflex. You might have better luck on a monday morning.
---
Full Obsidian, zerk necklace and obby sword has a str bonus of 63 plus 30% for effects makes it +82 str. The whip alone also has +82 str not including any armor str upgrades. Why is the Obsidian better than the whip? With the whip, I can have a fury and barrows to get way more str and def. Right?
---
Right... But their point is you can get attacked by others. Also, they might just want you to risk more because they’ll anti you
---
ya, i'll just go into hibernation for 1,000 years and maybe jagex will have customer service in the future. wish me luck
---
When goals unclear, do slayer
---
You can get it up passively if you play for a long time. Just dump all of your xp lamps from genies, the museum, and diaries on rc. Keep it as your lowest skill and do tears of guthix weekly. I didn't actually train it at all until the low 70s. I could have gone all the way to 77 like this but I got impatient and it was one of my last remaining goals I was working on. 
---
Zmi is like agility for me, not great but it's easy to watch a show on the side while keeping good rates.
---
Reddit: Hehe epic he lures kids for their gp. Thats what rs is about hahaha! Did i meantion I started playing rs in 1993?
---
Also Reddit: Pkers attack me when I have 500k worth of loot on me REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
For maintaining membership look into passive dailies like herbs, birdhouses, and battlestaves.
---
Also youll get a lot of hate on this sub for this but begging in the g.e can get you some gp pretty easily.
---
Sand casino, pest control then BA
---
&gt;You can max in under two years as a casual player. Main thing that slows down the maxing grind is money really.
---
This is a really loose definition of "casual" player, considering that pretty efficient players take 3000 hours to max, which equates to just over 4 hours a day, everyday, for two straight years.
---
Even just flicking it off right after your shot and on before it will help tremendously, since for the first phase your shot and his are sync'd (or one tick off if you're slow)
---
So this was an afterthought I had, and the way I see it, this is an effective 1v1 
---
Because either
---
A. The player would run 
---
Or 
---
B. The player would kill the boxing players (who would still occasionally hit the player anyway, and probably wouldn’t be carrying anything to make them difficult to kill other than food) 
---
Chances are in this situation, the player would just run 
---
This is no different than current 3v1 scenarios
---
Pker here. Gmaul nerf is unfair.
---
All the way here to Alabama
---
Imo, 90+ strength is invaluable to DPS. As for attack, depends on how far you want to train it. In FFA raids, I've seen plenty of pures do fine since a lot of the damage can be avoided and you don't really need anything beyond 75ish attack for BGS. But I don't really know how impactful it would be on your solo experience. It'd certainly help you hit DWH specs, but if you're dedicated enough, you can probably do without the attack levels.
---
Some solo raids only players are insane, doing 14-15 scaled Olms solo deathless, which involves 1.5+ hours on Olm alone. If you get good, I'm certain you can do solo raids with 72 att/str, but you would need a ton of experience to make up for your less than ideal stats.
---
It’s a really recent update. They changed unimbued helms to closer match the Smoking Kills version

Haha hell ya. I was actually thinking of doing this also! I’m glad someone else thinks this way also lol.
---
&gt;... hibernation for 1,000 years and maybe jagex will have customer service in the future.
---
Well lets not get too crazy here. At least 10,000 or another ice age. Hell would freeze over first.

Tears of guthix won't keep giving rc xp, better do slayer first.
---
How does someone with vork slayer helm and elite void do this
---
I don't have anything against pking. I'll always be of the opinion that if you're in the wildy you should be prepared to lose what you take in.

Or that you’re not talking to any actual pkers and everyone on this sub is a PvM prod who votes no on every PvP poll
---
He used cannon for 99 ranged, then used ranged to get 99 hp.
---
I only play this game to PK. My main is a maxed combat 1 defense build.
---
The gmaul is stupid broken in PvP. You don't have to be a pker to realize that.
---
I'm in the same spot but the whip is just too good so I might do atk to 99 first. What wep would you do str with? I think the whip/Barrows is better than obby sword/obby/berserker set up, but unsure
---
Where is Brad tho. You cant have Chad without Brad.
---
U get the same drops anywhere.
---
LMS is amazing!
---
Yeah, becomes pretty demotivating when you have a stat at 91 and it takes you 10 straight days of playing 1-2 hours a day just to level it up once, before realizing you still need 6.5m+ xp before its 99.
---
Specific ads are targeted on your browser history/Google searches, are they not? 
---
So if you have bought gold no wonder that ad comes up
---
Wow nice so training those two to 99 without doing any constitution then using them to do it to 99 then melle.
---
Thats a nice work around there.
---
The only right way. Imagine doing it reversed.
---
just got to bloods. Super afk-able and easy to do on the phone too.
---
Bought account LUL
---
Alt accounts would probably be difficult to manage, as they’d have to be able to hit the player
---
And if they were boxing, they would at most have weak defensive gear on 
---
But this argument is kind of moot, it may as well say just bring more people to fight with you
---
Deffo not modern pvp where everyone is totally min-maxed. LMS is way better.
---
Oh really? Wow
---
It is perfect. Realistic enought so someone who doesn't know what osrs is would just think that it is a regular fighting/fantasy scene and a osrs pleb would melt from it &lt;3
---
Reminds me of LoZ: Windwaker for some reason.

True, havent dropped for me yet!

PVPERS R LITRALY 2STOOPD 4 LIF LMAO

(upvote if u agre)
---
Just decline the gift?
---
Flipping is merching..?
---
They look like power rangers
---
&gt;U get the same drops anywhere and emblems anywhere killed in bh world
---
??? I don't care lol I'm just saying it happens a lot.
---
Just did slayer task there on alt. Can confirm.
---
Camelot on pvp world is even bigger eye sore
---
Rs3 is first of all alive, and second of all it's suffering specifically due to mtx. Continuing to milk it to oblivion is the most disrespectful solution imaginable. Only someone with no love for runescape would agree to something so calloused. 
---
No cosmetic cash shop. No mtx whatsoever. No milking osrs. Raise the membership fee to $12 and I'll pay it. Introduce angel wings and other dumb cosmetics behind mtx and I will sincerely lose interest. I don't want to lose interest, but it happened before. I'm not paying for a product I don't want.
---
This needs to be the top post of all time
---
Wrath runes are for fire surge
---
Congratulations.
---
I love this but genuine question, why did you put a signature in every panel?
---
I'm not surprised by any of that but all i can do is laugh at them and the rest of the shitty pvp community and the state pvp is in. They fail to realize most of the issues with pvp is due to themselves.
---
13 medium clues done
---
Is there a matchmaker to ensure people of similar caliber are up against each other?
---
Compare to K/D ratio? Would enough people play it to make it viable if there was only really 1 world for it?
---
It is though. Because when do companies actually like to admit they're wrong in a situation? 
---
This is someone dedicated to what they were crafting that has mounds of words that any Jmod would be so happy to "smack down", but hey look at that, they're either ignoring the thread or miraculously haven't seen it yet. 
---
The point is that this could happen to anyone, and has happened before. Quite a few people have been falsely perm'd with no appealability or explanation without having to come here.
---
There's a lot wrong with their current bot detection system which is why it's so ineffective. The fact that he's had to make three posts about this one issue should be speaking to you but you just want to tout your nose in the air and act like anyone against Jagex is automatically wrong without question.
---
Bob and Fred are going to meet each other at the beach. They both live next to each other and decide that regardless of this they’re going to take their own car, their own paths and meet at the beach.
---
Bob drives down the freeway and takes the direct route. He likes driving fast and not really having to work hard to get to where he’s going. Bob drives 10 miles and arrives at 10am.
---
Fred  drives his own way, he likes the scenic route. He doesn’t mind the slower roads, he actually prefers working out where he’s going and stopping off places. Fred arrives at 11am.
---
Bob and Fred both enjoyed their trip to the beach and the time they spent there.
---
So what have we learned? That perspective is everything and no matter which way you do something it’s about whether or not you enjoyed it. 
---
Long story short, we all play the same game and enjoy it differently. Just because somebody does things differently doesn’t make them wrong or inferior.
---
I seen a dude flexing over 120k Kc mole the other day in the g.e couldn’t believe it. Has to be some other nuts one out there
---
Yeah, I was trying to assure it wasn't an alt that got locked. Not schizophrenic myself luckily, but I have had a psychoses a couple of years back and it fucking sucks that you have to live constantly fearing losing your sanity. :( Would opening a support ticket take too much time?
---
Hes gotta hold onto any relevancy he can get, riding the coat tails of settled is only helping him so much.
---
No fucking way. I have burned like 2m moving my shit
---
the health bars only appear when the npc/player takes damage, including 0's
---
i think the solution is that this prayer isnt viable
---
&gt; I wouldn't mind at all if they removed splashing altogether
---
Instead of  removing it they should turn it into something more coherent with the game.
---
It's in RS3, it's basically a ranged weapon that casts entangle/ensnare.

They are all individual drawings with signatures in case I post them separately so that you could scroll through them.
---
Account security is fine, no customer support is the problem
---
You didn't answer his question. Which is the same question we all have: 
---
When you type your credentials into the runescape client, are you typing your EMAIL or your ORIGINAL USERNAME. 
---
You can end up with two accounts - your original can ONLY be accessed using your original username. If you're trying to use your email you CREATED A NEW ACCOUNT. You will never be able to log into your old account using your email, only new accounts via email. 
---
Accounts are not wiped, reset, and put on tutorial island. You're not accessing your old account file. **It's probably perfectly fine you're just not logging into it.**
---
Meet Stitchletics
---
Yeah that was 6 hours dude, people would go to sleep in NMZ and wake up 6 hours later with their xp gains. I don't think you could ever stay online longer than 6 straight hours.
---
Bulwarks melee and range def makes you forced to mage as its the best dps. Except that dps is still too low.
---
Don't bring your cash stack: if you die and your internet stops for an hour you can lose it all.
---
How do you chin or burst when you can't gain range or mage exp?
---
I mean, he made and built up those accounts. If someone wants to play 5 instances of OSRS to get an advantage, I think they have every right to do so. They're paying for 5 subscriptions after all, and it's not like they bought the gold for it.
---
In rsc you'd occasionally fail a spell and wouldn't be allowed to recast within x amount of seconds. Having your magic bonus too far in the negative could result in you failing to cast a spell like it did back then. Problem solved.
---

I haven't gone into the wilderness in over a year. I'm unable to do clue scrolls, I'm unable to kill any wilderness bosses. Why? Because the wilderness is a toxic dungheap that I would vote out of this game tomorrow if I had the chance.
---
No one seems to get that. Your splashing all your freezes because of the high magic defence. The shield contributes little to the defence. It’s the hide that is the issue.
---

If that’s what it takes to get this shit shut down, then so be it.

Why are you complaining about high end gear that you also have equal access to? 
---
Why are you getting specced out? Pray melee dawg.
---
The old game mode was a dogshit pray flicking simulator that was more tedious and annoying than it was fun, hence why no one played it.
---
Tbh doesn’t give me much of a runescape vibe... but it still looks fucking sick, nice work
---
Was on computer before
---
you don't have to really actively make gp once you're endgame main. gp basically just comes in 
---
and if you buy gold then why even play the game lol. you're gonna bankstand in your max gear with obby cape with 0 kc's of any boss and 0 clue of anything lol. making gp is a HUGE factor of the game unless you're iron.
---
Not sure if you are aware, but no one every has used water over fertilizer to protect a patch. Water only protects from disease for ONE growth cycle (for reference, herbs have ~6 stages) and you have to rewater it every few minutes to keep the immunity up. This means unless you spend ~40 min at ONE patch to ensure a complete disease free cycle for two allottments, a herb patch and a flower patch, instead of ~600gp for the best fertilizer you can buy, and supercompost is even cheaper and still better than watering. Tithe farm is the only patch where a watering can is used.
---
Yes
---
If people promise you gp, items or anything but say you need to go into the wilderness, they're gonna kill you out there. Simple rule to follow, if it sounds to good to be true, it is
---
If it's a 5x5, what's to stop someone from standing in the area and, it being single combat, boxing their friend wasting everyone's time to make others forfeit to take the area for free?
---
You’re going to need to find someone that’s willing to let you leech a raid. That is, you’ll go in and basically do nothing. Shouldn’t be that hard, I would check out the “WeDoRaids” discord.

you heard me you gay cunt

Yeah if shrunk to size itd be spot on m8 i think jagex would ahrink it n compact it down and then itd be aet to go nice work man
---
You sound like it. "Well, unlike you! I don't go around spewing stupid stories that nobody cares about". Find something better to do, I found that shit funny. When a shit PKer kills you for no reason, you get that look.

I'm currently having a similar relationship with Monster Hunter World. I've gone through the phase of playing 6+ hours/day on RuneScape, and I could *very* easily see myself doing the same thing in MHW, but I'm purposely not doing that because it would ruin my life.
---
They could put tiny cooldown on teleporting to the same place, like 15 seconds.
---
Can even say that "it's to prevent using it twice in a row on accident"

why

You seem pretty fluent in English as it is! I remember pre EOC playing on german servers because I took 2 years in school and can kind of understand it. The world's were always less busy. I hope it comes to OSRS

The pker also has a 0% death chance against he Bulwark user. If you want it to be greater than 0, you need to stop giving one sided advantages and make it riskier for everyone involved, like what I proposed.

The last decade the gaming industry has become an utterly poisonous environment, praying on the vulnerable left and right, adding gambling mechanics, nickle and dime mechanics, sunken cost mechanics, often aimed at god damn children. And when its not down right exploitative, its greedy. 
---
We have the games we love cut up and sold back to us, the pacing and progression fucked with a crowbar only to be “fixed” by slinging a few coppers at it, all the while titles are now pushing beyond $60 with micro transactions, day one dlcs, etc, etc. the day the bloated industry, a one we all used to love, lays down and dies will be a sweet one.
---
Its no shock Jagexs is testing the waters, and to be totally honest I believe you’d be a fool to think if they were given a chance they wouldn’t try.
---
Rant over

Fuck yeah I’d buy that

People like you vote in polls? Jesus

You can say "Reported" all day long. That's not helping anyone.
---
Tell me what I'm doing that's against the rules?
---
AFAIK everything I'm doing is allowed.
---
That’s not bad, it’s actually quite an elegant solution.
---
My alternative idea is give no magic xp for teleporting, say that the benefit of teleports is the fact that you didn’t have to walk.
---
Idk why people care about this you can literally splash anywhere else
---
What if I'm using a 60% keyboard. THEN WHAT?! (Snipping tool is the answer)

I think it's just vague terminology so they can justify banning whomever for whatever.

The skill ceiling already isn't very high.  Once you get pretty good at switching even an above average pker can beat someone who's been pking for years with good RNG.

Hahaha that’s because I am. I’m learning German :)

he prob the kind of guy watching CBT porn though ngl.

---
Didn't think about revs. Feel like Dhins should be always-risked in Rev Cave personal, that place is completely designed for the PK experience. I always think bosses when I read PvM.
---
Why tf are you wcing in that gear tho. Trying to flex? It's not working.
---
i agree completely. XP only hiscores are boring as fuck. PvMers deserve love too
---
Yeah that email saying it got changed was the phising email that got you just so you know for the future
---
&gt; I know a Mod posted a picture a year ago that showed the highest zulrah kill was 29k 
---
there's a person with over 100k zulrah already.

While I can see why someone may enjoy his content, I routinely avoid sending his videos to even my newer friends due to them being inaccurate or just not that great of a method. I also just dislike his style of videos, but I do respect his benefit to a new player who doesn’t really care how or what he does.

Ok fair enough, still bad

Looks great but too clean imo and the placement of the braziers and stuff don't really match well
---
1850 and 200m isn’t a huge accomplishment, sorry. Learn some raids, zulrah, go for accomplishment capes. If none of that tickles your fancy then I suppose you just need to take a break from the game.
---
Have to get on from the main logon screen

If they nerf dinhs, im getting a buckler and will exclusively say "Go twisted fuckler yourself" as i run away from pkers

It doesn't need to be an event like RS3. Just make them give good XP and that's it.

I don't get why NMZ is one of the best zones to train combat despite being horribly designed instead of that privilege being given to the actual good activities.
---
Don’t forget the tome of fire
---
DHCB. Sometimes kills take as long as four minutes too if I'm really unlucky.
---
Curved bone at bandos... :(
---
Face-palm. Sure you may get a let's say 10% more splashes, but as soon as they land a freeze you're done. Not to mention many clans use zgs for freeze specs and guess what, you now have no melee Def lmao.
---
Buckler is nowhere near the same field as a dihns as far as tanking goes.
---
Yeah good point, boxing to grieve others would be a problem. But it is a bannable offense afaik. They should not receive points if others also stand in the zone, but I get your point. Not sure what else they could do besides what they already try to, making others able to tag off when not enough damage is done. Even though that doesn’t work that good either.
---
Trying to find the right ironwoman for life. Sounds like a new quest?

Well I love you and the cc so turn that frown upside down

---
You've never butt chugged something before? One shot straight up the ass will get you fucked up.
---
even I did it the "hard way" but it's not really hard... I will probably vote no just because it's easy as it is. Full farmers outfit + gricollers can + seed box + auto weed can be unlocked in 5 days easily.
---
And that RuneScape HD. Man this is a big throwback.
---
I wouldn’t risk my account boxing or splashing for a few Larran’s keys tho.
---
I'm not trying to be that guy either. Genuinely curious.
---
Then bring a spirit shield switch. K top, k bottoms, dihns, and +1 crystal shield. Pray mage and augury, almost never land a splash and if they do, switch to the crystal shield until you unfreeze. 
---
I have never been ZGS'd at wildy altar, the only wildy content i really fuck with

Damn story of my life, kinda turned me into a savage and given the chance id lure someone.

Alch it in front of their faces to add salt to the wound
---
Your opponents typing made that much better, it was pretty good regardless though gj.
---
Yeah I know , I like it just the placement looks off to me maybe because it looks so clean. Amazing job nonetheless
---
poetic justice for boatman
---
Damn y'all kept this going? I went to bed because I have a real job but props to you 2 butt-buddies for keeping this shit alive. I've probably gotten more kills in one night than you 2 queers have in your whole life LMAO. 
---
I can almost guarantee that you wifed up the first girl that ever touched your dick, I genuinely feel sorry for you. And that's me giving you the benefit of doubt and believing that you're actually married and not just living in your moms basement like your post history leads me to believe. 
---
Either way I'm heading out to get fucked up with the boys, and y'all are going to keep getting angry at very trivial runescape posts. I'm out for the weekend but if you see this please reply with your kill count, I'm actually really curious.
---
Stay mad &lt;3
---
-10 mag def
---
V
---
Just stop while you're ahead and admit you know not of what you're speaking on. I've pked a ton, led a large clan, had massive pk trips etc. dihns is a very special shield. I both love and hate it. It has its place. It can be great to use for baiting, we've smited plenty, we've also lost many kills due to it in small man's.
---
Thanks mate all downloaded, I'll give it a go
---
void ranged would like to have a word with you
---
did you miss the lev 41 part? I would even try someone with the req to wield the shield... but i guess you cant see the point that people at level 30-40 are risking more then 20k salad robes so im trying to see where yall are getting your estimates from. However if you think a lev 41 (48 now) cant hit through what is it 80 def then yeh sure lol. Who risks less the 100k at those levels? Just for me to bring 150 amethyst (with posion not P+ or P++) is 40k add in a 31-31k gmaul gear an food an you are easily pushing more than what yall are saying on a LEVEL FORTY ONE!
---
Ironmen stand alone
---
Could try lurking in the gear discord or skulking discord. I can get you the invite links if you want.
---
Agreed
---
I don't agree. They have an incredible superior and can be seen as a "point boost" task because they're assigned in such small numbers.
---
Not every slayer mob needs to drop a hoard of skilling supplies and rune items out the arse.
---
&gt;Or maybe its dying because people like you have abused the polling system to spite vote every single PvP update from the game for OVER 2 YEARS?
---
This is because the polling system is literally flawed and harmful to the games health because people are selfish. For all their mistakes, developers are unbiased, meaning they will make updates in an attempt to improve the game.
---
Players on the other hand will always vote against something which makes the game harder for them, despite it being better for the game.
---
People wont vote for something getting nerfed because its op and helps them kill things. People will not vote for drop table nerfs because it will reduce the money they earn, despite bosses like Zulrah still completely fucking the economy even after nerfs (Coal is worth fuck all for instance).
---
Polling is going to kill this game in the long run
---
This is probably the dumbest comment chain I’ve seen on reddit so far. Teles aren’t afk. Inputs are required, there’s no way to argue that.

Is there a bug involving the viggoras mace losing charges outside of the wild? I was on a troll task in koureand and my mace had 90 charges on it, part way through the task it ran out of charges.
---
Yeah maybe that's pretty steep for wha th I need it for, but i am certain i want a nice desktop PC
---
Definitely post 99 ranks. For example, if I share an account with people from all different time zones and the account was logged in nearly 24/7, we’d be able to reach 200m all in a short amount of time. This wouldn’t be fair because nerds like Lynx and Jase played only by themselves to achieve this (Jase not yet but in like a month or two)
---
Wait FM xp is only gained from wt? Strange for some reason I thought you could burn logs to get FM xp I will have to test this once I get home. Thanks for letting me know wt is the only thing that gives FM xp
---
As deep as this is going, it just feels like the issue with capitalism. Seems like this kind of system wasn't designed with our future in mind, companies trying to grow infinitely doesn't make any sense. Disney, Amazon, Walmart, and even in the video game industry everyone's trying to pull more and more profit without a goal in mind besides let's keep growing. In the end making more profit can only translate into fucking the consumer and companies that make games we love will soon outgrow their humble beginnings into becoming corporate power houses trying to suck us dry.
---
Haha lol omg good discernment. There’s a difference between a few minutes and 20 minutes.
---
Barbarian assault is the best. I’ve done hundreds of high gambles. It doesn’t need xp bonuses

If you die not in pvp your loot will never show for another person

What do you mean? This is the customer service department!

Or what about the desert gods? That would be dope.

Now let's consider the alternative: not attacking the clue scroller and making 0 gp/hr

You should get your sister to play RS also. Couples who game together , stay together.

Oh wow didn't know that was a thing. Thanks

Clash royale is on the dashboard but OSRS isn’t?! 😵

Brother you are a nannerpuss but check my page cause I’ll post KC there. Cba is to post in comment due to link requirement. I’ve forgotten my imgur account.

What?

You're something quite unique, arent you?

Cause osrs is open I think, not sure why but the dashboard changes every time lol
---
It's fine. He's got two working hands.
---
SwampIetics btw
---
Basically did the same thing 😂
---
Well you said 22m FM xp shows his wt kc so that must meant wt is the only way to get FM xp right? Otherwise FM xp does not equal at kc
---
Lol wut, how? Anything you can take a screenshot of you can also a picture of.
---
wtf when I splashed at ardy, no one offered me any bonds :/

Man haha u got rekt with the downvotes. Thought it was pretty funny

Gotta love the "this guy is soooo stupid lmao" from people who can't read
---
Yes, it doesn’t affect the amount of people coming in or out of the wilderness. Bots move to a new location and people slaying, well there were already people slaying to begin with. The numbers will rise more in the first few days then stabilize out to what it previously was. 
---
Yes, the first few days made more people move into the  wilderness, however it soon became dead after a few days. 
---
So in no way did this content reflect any variation of PvP additions. It just gave wilderness slayers their emblems back (emblems dropped over 100k, larrans key averages about 150k) and bots a chance to telegrab more wines, even when the new location is leagues further from a bank.
